BEEx.org is a free service that helps people raise money for the nonprofits they care about by declaring and performing personal challenges. For example: "I will shave my head if $1,000 is raised for CARE International. The declaration spawns a challenge page that is easily promotable around the social web: Facebook, Twitter, email, blogs, your nonprofit's website, etc. By 'clustering' challenges together, BEEx can power the online fund raising solution for large events like a marathons or be utilized to create collective action campaigns.<br />
<br />
<h3>Background</h3><br />
BEEx is a radically transparent for profit company that creates fund raising tools for individuals and groups who want to raise money for nonprofit organizations. The company was founded at Northwestern University in 2007 by a group of friends who thought they could help make nonprofit fund raising more efficient by enabling individuals to raise money by mobilizing their social networks around action. This past winter we launched a prototype of our site at Northwestern University where we were able to raise over $20,000 in just a few months of limited operation. Users of our site experienced an over 40% increase in donations and won numerous campus fundraising awards.<br />
