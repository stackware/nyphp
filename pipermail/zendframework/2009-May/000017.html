</I>&gt;<i> Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> $loader = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then register your namespaces with calls to registerNamespace()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a minor code change really, and it's worth it especially

</I>&gt;<i> it back to 1 warning in 1.8.1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now as for Zend_Tool and Zend_Application... totally not necessary, and

</I>&gt;<i> now I am revamping my ACL, and I really don't have time to consider
</I>&gt;<i> redoing the way my app bootstraps, or learning how to make Zend_Tool
</I>&gt;<i> write code for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, the parts you aren't so happy about are Zend_Tool
</I>&gt;<i> and Zend_Application... the framework itself hasn't gotten more complex
</I>&gt;<i> really. It's just got a couple of brand new components that (in my case
</I>&gt;<i> anyway) would make my job harder and not easier (easier work... isn't
</I>&gt;<i> that the point of the framework anyway? haha).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, your application bootstrap might not need to be complex and object
</I>&gt;<i> oriented like Zend_Application. In fact, my bootstrapping is done in a
</I>&gt;<i> few lines, to load my config file and set up the auto loader, that's
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much it. Aside from my main application I have a ZF XML-RPC
</I>&gt;<i> server and that entire thing including the bootstrap (but not including
</I>&gt;<i> the class containing the actual methods that are called) is about 15-20
</I>&gt;<i> lines. Sure, it's not the most flexible bootstrapping, but it works and
</I>&gt;<i> there's no reason for me to change it right now  - Zend_Application
</I>&gt;<i> being released is definitely not a reason for me to break everything by
</I>&gt;<i> trying to shoehorn it in :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get caught up in the hype of new components, and the framework's

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Points well taken. I figured out about the autoloader on Day One with 1.8,
that's not too big a deal.

As for the rest, yes -- I think I am a little prone to thinking there's an
obligation to master all the latest bells and whistles and shoehorn them in
whether I need them or not. Psychotherapy, anyone? Seriously, though, the
power of all that Bootstrap stuff is seductive. The use of _initFoo in the
bootstrap class that automagically stores the resource in the bootstrap,
that's just too cool. But do you really need it, if you were happily storing
globally-necessary things in Zend_Registry until now w/ no problems?
Especially considering that internally that's just what the bootstrap thingy
is doing, according to the docs.
