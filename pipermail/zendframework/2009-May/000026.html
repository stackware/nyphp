 About the Book
 ===============
 Easy PHP Websites with the Zend Framework
 (<A HREF="http://www.easyphpwebsites.com/">http://www.easyphpwebsites.com/</A>) shows you how to build websites fast
 using PHP and MySQL, two of the world's most popular Web development
 technologies. What's more, you'll learn how to supercharge these
 technologies by taking advantage of a powerful, free web development
 tool known as the Zend Framework, which helps developers build
 websites with amazing speed and efficiency.
 
 This book embraces a teaching strategy of learning by doing, showing
 you how to build website features you'll actually want to use within
 your own websites. Among other things you'll learn how to manage data
 submitted through web forms, interact with MySQL using the Zend
 Framework's powerful Zend_Db component, send unformatted and HTML
 e-mails through your website, manage user registrations, logins, and
 recover forgotten passwords, and even create the structure for a
 simple social network.
 
 Along the way, you'll learn how to take advantage of popular online
 services such as Google Maps, Amazon Web Services, the Facebook
 Platform, and PayPal to create even more compelling websites.
 
 Every purchase of &quot;Easy PHP Websites with the Zend Framework&quot; comes
 with access to a downloadable DRM-free e-book and almost five hours of
 online instructional video! Check out the downloadable sample chapters
 and free videos at <A HREF="http://www.easyphpwebsites.com/.">http://www.easyphpwebsites.com/.</A>
