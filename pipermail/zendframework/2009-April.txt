Hi, I am new to zend framework but I believe it is the only one out there to
support the ISeries and as such would like to get started using the MVC and
especially the form components.  I  have been viewing info at
framework.zend.com but am looking for a highly detailed example in order to
get this working right away.  I am running the latest ZF and ZC on V5R4.
 Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome.  Thanks!
