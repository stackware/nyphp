I wonder how you guys weigh in on this question. ZF 2.0.0 is out and,
although I confess that I have only read a bit of the code in the sample
app, I can well understand why some people are complaining that it is *
really* complicated.

Too complicated? I know that's a subjective question whose answer depends
on what your background is -- skills and knowledge you bring to the table,
understanding of MVC and OOP and so forth -- and what you intend to use it
for. But I'm interested in hearing what you have to say.

FWIW, I have managed to live perfectly well without Dependency Injection.
How hard is it to use ZF2 without using DI?

Another question is, say you've built an app in ZF1. Try to migrate, or
leave it be? Again, I know the answer is "it depends," but I'm still
interested in hearing opinions.

I must say that I haven't used ZF2 yet so I am not an expert by any
standards.

The fact is that I have some ZF1 applications that are quite big and I
actually read somewhere "ZF2 is completely new system compared to ZF1, I
don't think you can make such kind of migration without decent amount of
recoding". Even if it seems to be more of a refactoring than recoding, the
fact that the new framework cant handle, even partly, php code written some
months ago is very frustrating.

I am so glad that I decided to not use a lot of view helpers and action
helpers.

For now the framework stays ZF1 for me.

You can't deny though that ZF needs to keep evolving. No need to
upgrade an already released product right?

I am curious as to what is in the new version. I hope it lends itself
better to rapd application development.

David, my plan is to learn as much as I can during this year's ZendCon, 
which will focus heavily on ZF2. I know several of us NYPHP'ers will be 
attending. Perhaps we should do a ZF2 topic when we return.
