Hi,

Does anyone have a soup-to-nuts example of a file upload form using zend
framework?  I am looking to use it to upload an ascii delimited file which
is to be saved to an array to do price look ups by line and part#.  Seems
like there are a number of ways to do this.  The simplest will suffice as
this is an internal app.  Thanks!

Nick
