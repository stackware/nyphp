Subject: [zendframework] calling RPG programs on ISeries
Message-ID: <3719ecad0911230939g1d60befby58aba1f483db258d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We are looking to create a php program to not only call an rpg program but
to be able to do so using the existing dds or program input screens.  Not
sure if this is possible in ZF.  Zend sells something called WebEx which is
supposed to include APIs to handle these kinds of ISeries program calls.

Any info on this or related would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

Nick

Hi, Nick,

How many IBM i (formerly called AS/400 or i5 or iSeries, for the 
uninitiated) 5250 screens do you need to web-enable? If it's only a few, 
you could use Zend's "5250 Bridge": 
http://www.zend.com/products/platform/i5os/5250

If you want, come to our ZF SIG meeting tonight at TGIF after NY-PHP. We 
can discuss this in more depth.
