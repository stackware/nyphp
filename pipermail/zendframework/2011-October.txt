Subject: [zendframework] XAMPP file into htdocs permissions
Message-ID: <CALewKSyDmC_2yX_2N1XMX0aa70V=j4mH=Ju2SogLnAJZqji0oQ@mail.gmail.com>

permissions pain


when i am in the process of placing -

a textmate file into XAMPP/htdocs i receive a password dialog window to do
the password thing.


the message is:

Type your password to allow TextMate to make changes.


What sticks out here is the words"  to allow TextMate to make changes ".


i could do a screen shot of the window, it has a image icon of textmate and
a lock icon together. so it would "seem" to be a textmate issue ??.


i see that the directories in XAMPP are guarded in root and Admin.

i could change permissions, but , should i.



could a script to allow TextMate to enter do the trick.

i am new to bash. i have a book on bash on the way.

i have been working in PHP, MySQL and some Javascript, i know a little on
functions and such all. i have been trying to get thru the bash man pages.
i could spend a few months learning bash to circumvent having to enter a
password every time i would like to place a file into XAMPP/htdocs

any suggestions besides going to the state mental hospital.

Thank you.


here are some file permissions.

$ ls -la /Applications

drwxr-xr-x   3 moonspoon  staff    102 Mar 14  2011 TextMate.app

-----------

$ ls -la /Applications

drwxr-xr-x@  8 root       admin    272 Feb 27  2010 XAMPP

----------------------

$ ls -la /Applications/XAMPP/

total 32

lrwxr-xr-x   1 moonspoon  admin    17 Feb 27  2010 htdocs ->
xamppfiles/htdocs

-----------------------------------

$ ls -la /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles

drwxr-xr-x@   9 root    admin    306 Oct 30 13:15 htdocs

Dear Sasa

I feel that i did make a mistake of posting the post that i did post at
zend  frame works.


I am learning to develop HTML Documents either static or dynamic 100
percent by way of books and some online material.

And i see now that i am needing to go into the back, back end, way back
there in the land of command line and its jungle.

I was pointed towards the domain of NYPHP by XAMPP and while scrolling down
in there while i was in a hurry while stressing out while ?

At the time that i did see the words zend frame works , a thought came
across my mind, while i was in a hurry , while i was stressing out while
??????..

 add infinity????????.

that zend  frameworks could be or would be the place to place a question
post in regards to XAMPP.


after i made the post.

i did look into zend frame works to receive a definitive understanding. and
saw that zend frame works is geared towards PHP.


i made a mistake.


I do not have unlimited time to spend 12 hours a day at the computer.

yad yada yada.

Thank you

 your words as copied from above:

Please let me know do you need help about, no matter do you want

To cooperate with me.


cooperate ? do we get to wear leather.
