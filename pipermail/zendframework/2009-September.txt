Subject: [zendframework] Zend Framework Meeting Tonight!
Message-ID: <5D10A4BD-A4C3-448A-A8AB-38D7BCC8DBB4@nyu.edu>

Alas, our Fearless Leader, Alan, will not be in attendance tonight,  
but we will be gathering after the PHP meeting at TGI Friday's, for  
those of you still interested!

Tonight, we will set a course for the upcoming weeks! Bring your ideas/ 
questions/suggestions, and we will compile these thoughts and  
requests, and use them to set up a discussion agenda for the group.

See you later,
Best,
Shari

Subject: [zendframework] Ideas for Zend Framework Meeting Topics
Message-ID: <CB3ADF03-F541-43E3-BF46-1DCA5F52F666@nyu.edu>

Hi All Zend Frameworkers!

Well, we had a good, if quick, question-rounding-up meeting last  
night. Below are a few of the topics that the members would like to  
see covered. If you have an additional topic/topics you would like to  
discuss, please respond to this email and add in your ideas/requests!


******* Possible Topics for Upcoming Meetings********

Tutorials/Beginner pointers (e.g basic bootstrapping, what is a "real"  
QuickStart?, or bare bones Framework, without modules)

Integration with other helpers, e.g., Smarty for page templates  
(pagination), or the Navigation Module for Site Maps, or just  
generally, how one can hook in other resources, like Doctrine  
(database ORM) into the framework.

Useful Modules, like AMF, Google Data, etc. Perhaps members who have  
used a good module can talk about it and share their experiences.
[data generator, for scaffolding]

Routing

Zend Form

Managing Database through Zend

Caching
