Thank you NYPHP for creating a ZF list.

And thank you for subscribing :)

We've got about a dozen on this list already so things are moving well.

Any questions?  Ask away... a dozen folks should be enough to field some
technical questions.

If anyone would like to see a SIG for another framework, let me know off
list.  I'm working on reaching out to the other framework groups/meet-ups
but if anyone knows of them already, please ping me.

I too agree this is a great idea! I've been hanging out in #zf-talk on  
freenode, and subscribe to the "official" ZF lists, but it's nice to  
see that some local folks are getting together. Here's a question for  
the few subscribed already: anyone ZF certified? Anyone want to be?  
Thoughts? I'm thinking about Zend Certification as well as Zend  
Framework Certification... not sure if both are necessary? Not sure if  
EITHER is necessary (tbh). Just throwing it out there....
