Subject: [zendframework] ZF + Doctrine, Monday, Aug. 30
Message-ID: <4C6ACC90.6080304@alanseiden.com>

August's NY-PHP SIG meetup for Zend Framework

Join us at TGI Friday's after the regular NY-PHP User Group meeting
(http://www.nyphp.org) for August's Zend Framework Meetup/SIG.

Guest host Isaac Foster (http://www.linkedin.com/in/isaaczfoster) will 
lead a discussion of how to use Doctrine with your Zend Framework 
applications. Doctrine is not only a powerful object relational mapper 
(ORM) and database abstraction layer (DBAL), but provides a framework 
for building your models as well as some administrative tools that can 
reduce development time and developer hair-pulling. Doctrine integrates 
with ZF easily, so with a few lines of code you'll be up and running in 
no time.

As always, feel free to bring your ZF questions for the group to discuss.

Date: August 30, 2010 (a MONDAY)
Time: Approx. 8 PM, after the regular NY-PHP meeting
Place: TGI Friday's, 56 & Lexington, NYC

Hope you can join Isaac for a very interesting discussion.
