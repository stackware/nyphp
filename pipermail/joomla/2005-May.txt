Community,

    I am looking for a way to extrapolate metadata about content and 
place it nicely within my template.  For example, I would like to be 
able to tell what section a given content item is attached to and make 
logical decisions about images etc accordingly.  I could write the logic 
if it was documented what some of these variables were.  Any guidance on 
the best way to approach this problem will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Hey Ed,

This is all tied around $Itemid (which tells us how the content was
navigated to).

This is a legacy deal, as Mambo completely decouples content from
navigation. In fact, you can have one particular page, navigated to
from completely separate menus where the content appears like it is in
completely different sections.

Don't forget, you can also assign templates to sections, so instead of
writing all that checking stuff in your template, just create a
different template for each section. That way, you can move content
and sections around, and even change templates, but not have to recode
all that logic (that figures out where you are in the first place).

The current documentation is located here:

    http://help.mamboserver.com/

...and you can also browse the generated API docs online here:

    http://help.mamboserver.com/api

On a related note, I'm working on some training materials for 3rd
party developers, and will be making announcements as soon as things
are lined up and solidified.

Hey gang,

Was just pointed at this post on our forums today:

   http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=42100

Points you at many different sites, all with very helpful information
covering a wide range of topics.

For those of you really having trouble getting started, taking a look
at MamboTemplates sounds like a great fit - they provide flash

Subject: [mambo] Mambo Menu Question
Message-ID: <428D7EFA.2090303@maas-nyc.com>

Community,

    Here's an interesting menu question and I guess a good question in 
general.  I love mambo's emphsis on text and flexible text placement, 
but is there anyway to add graphics elements as well.  For example place 
an image in a left right bottom or top position.

    Specifically, I would like to add an image to a menu because my menu 
titles are done in a non-standard font and have a gradient behind them.  
I already have them prepared and in the correct directory, i just can't 
find the right kind of element to add to my menu to easily display an 
image.  Could this be easily done via an add in ?  Would this be better 
as a mambot or a module?  Or shoudl I just hack the menu component ?

    All input is appreciated.

Ed Maas

The easiest way to accomplish this is with CSS, although you could
also implement a dynamic menu (such as suckerfish which also leverages
CSS).

I believe that if you worked with JSCook menu (from the Display Menu
project on mamboforge.net) you could tell JSCook to replace the menu
items with graphics, but I honestly have not gone far enough to
replace the text as well myself.

If your menu is not going to change any time soon, then it is also
possible to manually create the code for the rollovers, and just
create a static HTML module that is published at that menu location.
To try it out, go to Module Manager and hit 'New'...

I looked at doign this via css.  I am not however looking to do a 
rollover.  I already do them essentially with css.  I want to add a 
header image (ie a separator or something, but make that separator an 
image not text.  There is an option for the "bullet image" though it 
doesn't seem to work, but overall that is the look I am looking for.

I will take a look at JSCook menu.

Thats kinda no fun, plus is a bit of a pain to copy all those "mambo"  
urls accuratly.  Plus  these menus might change pretty frequently.   If 
I were to engineer it I would add a new type of item to be placed on the 
menu.  Call it image, and then just reference one of the images.  
Instead of placing text in the space in the table I would place an "img 
src tag" and let the rest be done.  Seems like a good feature, can't 
believe it hasn't been done.  Maybe i'll take a whack at it.

Has anyone been able to get the simpleboard forum component to run with
Mambo 4.5.2?  I've installed the latest (simpleboard 1.0.4-Beta2), everyone
is happy, no errors during the install.  I just can seem to add any
users/moderators or get the forum topics to appear on the front-end.  

Noticed there was a fix on twoshoes for 4.5.2 - which patched into
simpleboard.php -but that did not address my problems.

Thanks,

Mark

Not experienced with SimpleBoard, as I exclusively use SMF from
SimpleMachines.org and get the Mambo<->SMF bridge. That way I have a
full-blown forum available, and it has integration with Mambo for
accounts.

Highly recommended :-)

I've done both, as www.mywebsite.com/forum and forum.mysite.com.

Also, would like to point out that not only is SMF feature list
comparable with VBulletin, but the guys at SimpleMachines are great to
work with and I consider them a very good group of people.

This is a quote taken directly from the Two Shows Mambo Factory forum. I 
have applied this fix and it works. 
(http://www.tsmf.jigsnet.com/component/option,com_simpleboard/Itemid,50/func,view/id,8888/catid,38/limit,10/limitstart,40/)

    get mamboexplorer here

    <http://mamboforge.net/frs/?group_id=866&release_id=3411>

    install it and then inside the mambo backend open maboexplorer and
    edit the simpleboard.php file on line 48 as described by jan to

    *Code:*


|  } elseif ( $mambo_release == "4.5" && ($mambo_dev_level == "1" || $mambo_dev_level =="1a" || $mambo_dev_level == "2" || $mambo_dev_level == "2.1") ){|


    then save

This is a quote taken directly from the Two Shows Mambo Factory forum. I
have applied this fix and it works.

Subject: [mambo] Component generator component
Message-ID: <330532b6050525065553a7a0ce@mail.gmail.com>

Hey gang,

A former core developer just came out with an online component
generator, which will create a data-entry form, management interface
and display interface - all through the web.

When you are done, you receive a complete component package that you
can install with Mambo's web installer.

Really a great idea:

I need to add two variable to the session in mambo.  Is it really true 
that I have to add two columns to the session table?  Are there 
instructions for what else needs to be modified for this to work?

By the way, Mitch turned me onto a book a couple of weeks ago: The Art 
of the Start.  It was an amazing book that changed my outlook on a lot 
of things.  Check it out if you get a chance, it is a fast read.

What are you trying to do? As soon as that is clear I can answer your
question ;-)

I need to store something for the duration of a session and refer to it 
through out the life of the session. Essentially, I have to store the 
state of whether the user saw something or not in two different places 
in the app.  Once in the PMS component and once on the index page.

I need to show an intermediate page the each time someone hits the site 
after they have logged in and before they see the home page.  But only 
once per session. If you are not logged in you are redirected to a 
landing page with a login form.

I also need to do the same sort of thing the first time they get to the 
PMS component.  But only once per session.  I want an easy way to store 
and expire the state of whether they have seen the intermediate pages or 
not.

Anyone identified/used a good Paypal module for donations?  I've found one,
Donamb, which appears to do what I want but has not documentation.  Looked
high and low.

Thanks,

Mark
