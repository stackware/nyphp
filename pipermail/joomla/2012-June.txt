Hi Janet!

First of all: which Joomla version are you using?

There's no problem using more than one menu in the same position. As well
as there's no problem assigning these menu modules to certain pages.

Using module sufixes you can style them differently, which can be a plus
when it comes to designing an user interface.

Look at this example: you have a site with four menu itens: home, products,
services, contact.

Products has two sub-menu itens: Product A, Product B.

Services has three sub-menu itens: Service 1, Service 2, Service 3.

You decide to create separate menus for products and services containing
these sub-itens: menu-products and menu-services. From the menus you create
the modules with a similar name mod-menu-products and mod-menu-services.

Now you assign these modules only to the menu itens related. That means,
mod-menu-products will only be visible when your visitor enter the products
area of your site and visits either page of Product A or Product B. Same
for mod-menu-services.

If you have further questions, just ask.

It sounds like all you would need is a wee bit of CSS to change this. Can
you post a link to a site using it?

Best,

Subject: [joomla] Subscription standards?
Message-ID: <1338823815.98753.YahooMailNeo@web160406.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

In searching through the JED for plugins, modules, etc. I notice that several commercial 

offerings are available via subscription for as little as a month or two, but don't really explain
what it means to "subscribe".

Is there a general understanding within the community as to what rights come with the subscription
and what rights, (if any) persist after my subscription period is over?? 

I.e., Can I continue to use the software after the subscription period for websites created during the
active subsciption?? What about using the software in new sites after the expiration of the subscription?

I assume support ends and I can't get updates after the expiration of the subscription...but what about bug fixes?

Thanks to all on this forum. It makes getting started with Joomla a lot easier!

While there isn't any standard, typically subscriptions allow access to
downloads and support. You are generally free to use the software on as
many sites as provided by the license for as long as you want, even after
the subscription expires.

Most developers will detail what the subscription offers and limitations,
if any, after expiration.

Hope that helps.

Hi Janet

Using the software in new sites ? always.

Support ? often ends. Not always, but more often than not.

Bug fixes ? not for small things, but good developers will always offer important security fixes, even to expired members.

A wee bit. I like the way you put that. :-) Thanks.

No, I can't post a URL for it because it's on the intranet. I got the
software from addthis.com.

I just discovered I installed the plug-in version, but they have a module
version which would allow positioning so that might solve the problem to
get it flush-right.

I tried a few other addthis extensions this afternoon and each had it's own
problem.

Subject: [joomla] CiviCRM and Joomla -- Brian Shaughnessy at JoomlaDayNYC
	2012
Message-ID: <1339161116.71480.YahooMailNeo@web162806.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Great News -- Brian Shaughnessy will be speaking at JoomlaDayNYC 2012! 

Brian wrote the book on using CiviCRM with Joomla (literally, he has a book).

CiviCRM is an essential tool for project implementers, organization leaders, staff, and volunteers in advocacy, and non-governmental organizations, elected officials, professional/trade associations, political campaigns and parties, government agencies, and other similar organizations.

It is very difficult to find developers who work with CiviCRM in Joomla.? CiviCRM is used more with Drupal.

I wanted to update everyone on my journey here to accomplish this. The
Mission Control admin template from Rocket Theme looks like the winner. I
was easily able to remove a bunch of stuff from the back-end for the
'newbie' user without having to make any code changes. I also disabled some
modules that cluttered up and could possibly confuse a newbie.

I have one task that remains:

I've been able to remove many things from the webpage for the 'newbie'
user, but the EDIT for the 'newbie' profile still displays and is enabled.
I would like to remove the EDIT option from the web page. I don't want the
'newbie' to change any of the settings for their profile.

How could I best accomplish this? I have looked in the code for the Mission
Control template, and I could put in a check if the user is not Super User
then the EDIT would not appear, but I can't help wondering if there is a
better way or if I have overlooked a way to not display the EDIT option?

I could just assign the custom modified Mission Control template for the
'newbie user' and the default Joomla admin template for the Super User, but
wanted to check on my approach here first. Thanks!

I'm not sure if I understand exactly what you mean, but preventing an user
from editing his/her own profile doesn't make sense to me. Say he/she
changed his/her email. What would be the procedure to perform this action?

Have you tried using a template override to reduce the options visible to
edit?

This is for a non-technical user who needs access to the back-end to edit a
few Articles and nothing more. The Administrator would change their
password if needed. Their e-mail address wouldn't change, and they would be
registered by the Administrator. This would be for only one or two
non-technical users at most, so there wouldn't be much for the
Administrator to do past setting up their login to the back-end.

A template override would be a good approach but it didn't look like this
was available to do for this feature. But I'm new to the Mission Control
template so I certainly could have missed something.

If you want to simply not display the EDIT button, go to your site's joomla
roo then:

administrator > templates > rt_missioncontrol > lib >
missioncontrol.class.php

Just place // before the following line:

$output .= '<span
class="mc-button">'.$edit_link.JTEXT::_('MC_EDIT_BUTTON').'</a></span>';

It should be line 181 or around it.

Upload this file and your EDIT button is gone for good.

Make sure to back up this file prior to making changes, just in case.

I REALLY don't know if this change could affect anything system-wide.

G'luck!

ALSO you can use CSS to not display the button.

In core.css change this piece of style on line 17:

#mc-frame .mc-button{display:inline-block}

to:

#mc-frame .mc-button{display:none}

EDIT is gone for good one more time!

Subject: [joomla] OT: Looking for surplus wireless routers
Message-ID: <4FD757B7.8040300@gmail.com>

I figured I'd ask here as my collection of "dead" routers is low[some 
used, some not working, some lost in various moves].

I'm looking for wireless routers.  Preferably the Cisco/Linksys ones - 
anything from the x54G models oneward[Exxx models, WRTxN models, etc].   
Basically, anything on the DD-WRT list: 
http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices

Summer's coming up so I want to do some electronics and other projects 
with the kids, and I'm looking for zero cost as these things are likely 
to end up broken/taken/etc.

I've had good luck with seemingly dead/glitchy routers sticking DD-WRT 
on them - and to make it vaguely Joomla related, I'd like to install 
apache/php/joomla and hack around a bit with that as well.

So I figured I'd ask if anyone going to the next meeting has some they 
are willing to part with and can bring to the meeting for me...  I 
figured there might be some people here like me...everytime I upgrade my 
wireless, I just can't bear to send the old routers to the landfill but 
no one wants them...so they accumulate...and accumulate...and accumulate.

Does not need to be Linksys/Cisco - their just the one's I've mucked 
with in the past, anything on the supported device list would work.

Subject: [joomla] Want to expand you CMS skill sets.
Message-ID: <4FDB7020.6020402@wolpow.com>

Joomla is a great platform as we all know.
It does not hurt to add another major Platform or two.

The NYC Drupal Users Group Presents a free event (though it would be 
nice to donate something)

DrupalCampNYC 11 - The Unconference

Do you Drupal? Do you wonder if maybe you should?

In keeping with a long-running Drupal NYC tradition, our next 
unconference (DCNYC11 for those keeping count) will take place on 
Saturday, June 23rd in its long-time home at Polytechnic University in 
Brooklyn!  Registration for this event will be FREE, but we suggest a 
donation of $25.00 to help us to continue funding these types of camps 
in the future.

What is an unconference?

In an unconference, the event content is suggested and chosen by the 
actual attendees on the day of the event.  First thing in the morning, 
we all gather to find out what everyone wants to talk about, set the 
schedule, then allocate the rooms that we have rented/reserved.

There is usually a nice mix of talks covering a variety of skill levels 
and topical areas including development, theming, and business.

Visit http://dcnyc11.eventbrite.com/ for full details and to register!

Thanks

Scott Wolpow

Last nite at the NYC Joomla User's group, a very smart women, named Elin
presented on core Joomla topics....There was also a reference made to books on Joomla that she authored...
Problem is, I didn't write down the name of the book, and I didn't get her last name....

If someone who was at the meeting last nite knows who I am referring to, please email me...

Thanks!
Have a great weekend, and Happy Father's Day to all you dads!

Subject: [joomla] Mission Control template by Rocket Theme - How do I change
 the menu top of page?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv9ABnmET+_kNPs6b4hNy=FHCK=RB4Rvd4aV26LRJHP0tg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm making a simplified version of the Mission Control admin template by
Rocket Theme for a newbie. It's a requirement.
I need to make changes to the menu top of the page. When you go to the
Article Manager: Articles Across
the top right of the page is:
New | Actions | Edit | Featured | Check In

Below Article Manager: Articles there is:
Articles | Categories | Featured Articles

I need to remove Featured from the top right menu and Features Articles
from the left side under Article Manager: Articles.

As far as I have gotten is in index.php, line: 64


   1. <div id="mc-submenu">
   2.      <?php $mctrl->displaySubMenu(); ?>
   3. </div>


If I remove the line of code for $mctrl->displaySubMenu();, none of the
three menu items below display. But I don't know where these values are
being set. Likewise, I don't know where $mctrl->displayToolbar() is being
set for the top right either.

I'd appreciate help with these two places. I'm new to the Mission Control
template and until now, I've not had a reason to modify an admin template
for Joomla.

Thanks!

Add the following line to your rt-missioncontrol/css/menu.css

li.li-featured-articles, .mc-toolbar ul li#toolbar-featured.button
{display: none;}

That should do the trick!

Thanks for the reply.

That will cause it not to display, but the link for it will still be on the
page for the newbie to click on totally causing them to freak out and worst
of all, phone me! :-)

If it's not displayed, how can the link be still on the page?

Or do you mean the link to the page that displays the featured articles in
the admin submenu? You have a simple choice here: unpublish the Admin
Submenu module. Drawback is that ALL Admin Submenus will not be displayed
anymore.

I stand corrected. While that medtho didn't work for me with the EDIT of
the Profile, it did work for Features! It removed it from display on the
page and there is no link to Features. Excellent! Thanks!

I should point out to anyone else interesting in doing this, that this
isn't secure because the HTML code and javascript for this button is still
available in the View Source. However, that isn't a concern for me since
the newbie would be logging in from an .htaccess secured back-end. My main
concern was to remove things do the newbie doesn't get very confused or
mess up things.

By the way, I did an override to remove other things from the page. But I
guess this being part of core Joomla, it simply wasn't available for
overrides.

Hi all,
Just wanted to forward this over to the entire group.  If you are using
joomla 2.5.4, it is time to upgrade to joomla 2.5.5.  Good news is that you
can do it with a click of a button!  So click away!

Please be aware that there are known issues when upgrading to 2.5.5 (i.e.
http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&tracker_item_id=28684).
It took down two of my sites yesterday and many users can't upgrade until
those issues are fixed. 2.5.6 is coming soon.

I updated 20+ sites yesterday with no problems.

This is just an issue with some individual extensions, right?

We don't know yet. It could potentially be any third party extension. I
believe the issue is tied to use of registerEvent.

Subject: [joomla] How to override the Newsflash module HTML?
Message-ID: <CAHM6=OAJtqjFZJrguXzgMWnL+LPge4t8xP=tQdoRCSykUT9Q-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

I need to make a change in the HTML output provided by the newsflash module
in J 2.5.

I thought this would be easy, but in the module files all I see are
function calls that I have NO idea where it's retrieving the HTML code to
display the module on the page.

Can someone shed some light on this for me?

Thanks a million

Hi,

Can you provide an example of the HTML output that you want to change?

Best,

Matt

<?php for ($i = 0, $n = count($list); $i < $n; $i ++) :
    $item = $list[$i]; ?>
    <li class="newsflash-item">
    <?php require JModuleHelper::getLayoutPath('mod_articles_news',
'_item');
    if ($n > 1 && (($i < $n - 1) || $params->get('showLastSeparator'))) : ?>
        <span class="article-separator">&#160;</span>
    <?php endif; ?>
    </li>
<?php endfor; ?>
</ul>

I'm using the AllVideos plugin to display a youtube video:

I want to get rid of the <p></p> tags, so I can reposition the h4 tag on
the side of the video.

I can't find where it's coming from.

Thanks a million!!!

You need to edit the file _item.php, it would be in the tmpl folder of the
module but you should put it in you templates html over ride file not the
core module

I've tried to, but I can't find the <p></p> tags in it. The ones I want to
get rid of.

This is the code in _item.php

<?php if ($params->get('item_title')) : ?>

    <<?php echo $params->get('item_heading'); ?>
class="newsflash-title<?php echo $params->get('moduleclass_sfx'); ?>">
    <?php if ($params->get('link_titles') && $item->link != '') : ?>
        <a href="<?php echo $item->link;?>">
            <?php echo $item->title;?></a>
    <?php else : ?>
        <?php echo $item->title; ?>
    <?php endif; ?>
    </<?php echo $params->get('item_heading'); ?>>

<?php endif; ?>

<?php if (!$params->get('intro_only')) :
    echo $item->afterDisplayTitle;
endif; ?>

<?php echo $item->beforeDisplayContent; ?>

<?php echo $item->introtext; ?>

<?php if (isset($item->link) && $item->readmore &&
$params->get('readmore')) :
    echo '<a class="readmore"
href="'.$item->link.'">'.$item->linkText.'</a>';
endif; ?>

Thanks you all!

I just realized the offending <p> was placed automatically in the HTML code
when I created the article where I put the AllVideos plugin code. Switched
to <div>. Now everything's OK and I can style the page as I wanted.

Thanks for all your help!

Subject: [joomla] ordering modules?
Message-ID: <1340290225.74570.YahooMailNeo@web160405.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

I have multiple modules in a sidebar position, each module is displayed on one or more pages.
How can I specify which order they should appear in?
If I use the arrow keys to move up or move down the module ordering, the modules move up or down
one or more places in the stack....
I tried specifying ordinal numbers in the "ordering" column, but I can't figure out how to save my 

forced ordering.!? 

Help appreciated!

Hi Janet,

 

There is an old untouchable Joomla joke: Darling, you know what is new login
of Joomla site, don't you know, it is day when we meet.

 

Best Regards,

Sasa

As a plus, if you're using 2.5, you can reorder collumn order by clicking
on the header titles: Title, position order, ID etc. Either decreasing or
increasing. Such a handy feature!

I do not know if this has been considered but may I suggest that the icon
be changed for re-odering anything in Joomla CMS. This "diskette" icon
frequently is missed (no seen) by new users. I have been teaching Joomla
CMS for years now and this issue is very very common. In fact, it is on my
" must show/explain list" to new users.

Does anyone know if this has been considered? It is such a low-tech
interface issue that it seems to me that it could be easilly changed once a
better solution or just icon was found.

My two cents

As a new user, I'm baffled that there isn't just a "save" or "save and close" option!
Simple and consistent.

Subject: [joomla] How hard can it be to make an override?
Message-ID: <CAHM6=OChLOZMfySedyrnbOG6dhyC8ek2g40x4gour7YjUo1o6g@mail.gmail.com>

I just started a project where I needed to do some overrides.

I've been doing this for years, as it was extremaly easy find the piece of
HTML code I wanted to change, then do it, while keeping functions around.

Now, with 2.5 it seems things have changed drastically. I cannot find the
HTML as easy as I used to. Thus, it is impossible to change things to look
like I want to. If this is true, Joomla won't be a flexible CMS as it was
before because non-programmers WON'T know what and where to change.

As I am NOT a programmer, I'm having a hard time with this issue, that I
never had before.

Geez...

Are you speaking of template overrides?? If so, which template are you using?? I noticed on the Yootheme templates the template overrides were not where I was expecting them to be.? This was a function of their warp system, not Joomla.

I agree the new YooTheme templates undergone major changes. The 2.5
versions are far more code heavy than 1.5. The Warp framework has added
another layer to figure out.

I am pulling my hair out trying to make a custom background work in
Symphony. YooTheme says you can create a "styles" folder and override the
CSS, but it doesn't work.

As for the regular HTML overrides, like com_content and com_contact, I have
noticed no or very little difference between the two. It is not a problem.

Usually the overrides are in the folder called "html" under your template.? I have found with the Yootheme templates, there are sometimes overrides in the "layout" folder of the template folder.

I'm referring to 3rd party extension overrides. Here and there I noticed
it's harder to find quickly where and how to change things.

As Stephen mentioned, extensions have become more code heavy.

I must say I'm not a programmer, but I feel it's taking longer for me to
figure out how to make an override than it was in 1.5.

Stephen:

I'm using a "son of yoothemes" template,? that also uses the Warp framework. In order for the "styles" folder to work,
you need to duplicate the "empty-style" folder in the framework, rename it to something - (like my_custom_styles) then 

ftp my-custom-styles to the Styles folder within the template folder, and it seems to work.?

I agree the new YooTheme templates undergone major changes. The 2.5 versions are far more code heavy than 1.5. The Warp framework has added another layer to figure out.?

I am pulling my hair out trying to make a custom background work in Symphony. YooTheme says you can create a "styles" folder and override the CSS, but it doesn't work.?

As for the regular HTML overrides, like com_content and com_contact, I have noticed no or very little difference between the two. It is not a problem.

One aspect worth noting, regarding frameworks, is that many of them were
originally created to make it easier for user's to modify and customize the
template through an administrative interface. One side effect of that a few
of them had to create their own unique solutions to accomplish this, which
resulted in a more complicated code base.

Some users that need to modify custom templates, might find it easier to
avoid frameworks like this and build a template from the ground up. Other
frameworks are more easily modified on the code level.

It's sort of the yen yang of code complexity versus user experience.

I agree with Matt, Years ago I found the tempting frameworks very useful but as i started to develop my own templates I found them very frustrating  to develop custom code into. 

I now always just use joomla native templating

Yes Chris and Matt. That is what I done too.

I got tried of spending time trying to work with  commercial templates and
two years ago created my own "minimal" Joomla template that borrows from
the 960 grid system CSS framework and some code from Matt's Construct
Framework.

There is no javascript, Mootools, and jQuery, just a basic stripped down
layout with about a dozen module positions and a Suckerfish CSS horizontal
menu. Then depending on the project, I can add Mootools or jQuery menus if
requested.

I am currently updating my framework template with the Twitter Bootstrap
framework, which has jQuery features, but they are very basic.

Matt, do you know if the templates shipping with Joomla 3.0 with be based
on Bootstrap?

There should be a one page quick start guide shipped with each template at
the very least.

Yep!

If you take a look at this presentation from Kyle Ledbetter, Bootstrap will
be all over J3.0

Getting anxious here to learn it ASAP!

Subject: [joomla] Send registration email but without the password
Message-ID: <96807a2fcb9e7c8452ed82aa02f4deb5@joomlaconnections.com>

Dear NYPHP SIG:

I have a client with Joomla CMS 1.5.X and Virtuemart. I want to stop Joomla
CMS from sending the new user registration email with the password embedded
in the email message. It is fine with me to send the email but just not
with the password. This is not a Joomla CMS parameter setting but a Joomla
CMS code hack. I hate to have to hack the code due to the obvious updating
problems but it must be done. Perhaps it is easier to just stop the sending
of the registration email?

Also, does anyone know if Joomla 2.5.x would require the same kind of hack?

Thank You
Bob Rynkiewicz

Hi Robert.

You can stop the sending of the registration email through the back-end
with Joomla 2.5. Not sure if this option was available for 1.5 or not:
http://learning.cloudaccess.net/knowledgebase-documents/98-joomla-functions/user-manager/228-how-to-select-the-new-user-account-activation-process.html

There are 3 New User Account Activation options to choose from in the Users
Configuration area. These include the following:

   - None - no activation is required and the user can log in immediately
   after registering.
   - Self - users will receive an email that offers instructions and a
   token that is needed to activate the account.
   - Admin - an administrator of your site approves the account.

=+=+=+=
If it's set to None, then the user won't get an e-mail. Self was the
default. Admin might be an option, but I don't know if it sends the
password through or not.

The problem I see with using None, is that unless Captcha is used for
registration the website might be left open to a 'bot' doing something
nasty like registering a zillow bogus users.

Hope this helps!

Hi Bob,

If I recall correctly, you can remove the password from the registration
email by modifying the en-GB.com_user.ini language file. I don't recall if
there is a better way to do this in 1.5, but you can just edit that file,
or consider using something like
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/languages/language-edition/13147.

Joomla 2.5 supports language overrides in the core.

Hope that helps.

Best,

Hello Everyone,

I'm working on a new clients website and they had issues with their main domain which required a reboot of their server. So thankfully I used Akeeba Backup. But now I'm stuck at this screen:
http://thecaskeygroup.com/newsite2/installation/index.php everything is great except that php version shows a red NO. On that server I was able to install Joomla 2.5 just fine but now I cannot restore it???
Has anyone had this problem?  Client is using CentOs with Plesk 8.6 hosted with Media Temple.

Thanks!
Kenny

Hi Kenny.

"PHP Version >= 5.2.7No"

It looks like it's complaining about the version PHP which is installed on
that server. See if you can through find out the version of PHP being used
through CPANEL or if you have shell access enter the command:

php -v

and see what version of PHP is being used. I think Joomla 2.5 requires PHP
5.3 or later.

That screen is just a version of PHP info and has nothing to do with Akeeba.

A reboot of the server would not affect anything that was installed.
Do you mean you reprovisoned the server?

If you are using a cloud server and you did not make a new image, then 
you have wiped out any changes.

You need to upgrade php.
I suggest you just upload a php info to the server and run that.



|<?php

// Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
phpinfo();

// Show just the module information.
// phpinfo(8) yields identical results.
phpinfo(INFO_MODULES);

?> |

David,
Thanks for the direction, client is using Plesk 8.6 and it says version 5.2.6-1.el5.art in the components list.
Weird how I installed Joomla 2.5.4 just fine on this server but cannot restore using Akeeba Backup now?

Thanks,
Kenny

Hi Kenny.

I was so focused on Joomla, I didn't consider that Akeeba might have a
requirement of what version of PHP it was using. I'm not that familiar
with Akeeba and thought perhaps that was the shared web hosting's panel.

Anyway, to help solve your situation contact the web hosting service and
see if that can upgrade the PHP on there to a later version. Hope this
helps!

Scott,

No reprovisioning done on the server. Just a restore and reboot of the server.
I understand that a php upgrade would probably be helpful but I'm not a network engineer and I don't know how to do what you mention below 
'just upload a php info to the server and run that' 

how can Joomla 2.5 have installed fine and now I'm trying to restore with Akeeba Backup and it won't work?



Thanks,
Kenny

When you restored your server, you erased all the changes to php that 
had been made since it went up.

Best bet is to call media temple and ask them.

Scott,
Okay media temple says its outside their scope of support since it involves Plesk.
I'm having the client upgrade their version of Plesk (8.6) which is old anyway. 
Then I'll revisit the Akeeba backup installer page and try to continue the process after they upgrade php version.

Thanks for everyone's help on this issue! Its really nice to know that this community is here to help

Regards,
Kenny

Matt,

Thank You but I tried to edit the en-GB.com_users.ini (it is not 
"user.ini").

If you take " %s\n\nUsername: %s\nPassword: %s\n\n\n" (located in that 
file) and remove any of the "%s\n\n\n" variables. Joomla CMS will not 
send the email. It seems to just fail. I assume it is something to do 
with the coding and perhaps an array of values. At least when I tried 
it. Perhaps I will try again.

Seems as if there is not much on this topic out on the Net yet I would 
think it is not new ground to be covered. Is this some kind of BIG 
secret that only money will loosen ones lips or fingers?

LOL

I just came across another extension where the output HTML code instead of
being into a default.php inside a tmp folder, is in helper.php. Which makes
it impossible to override. Solution? Hack the code...

*sigh*....

3rd party components range from amazing to awful.

Hi:
Can anyone recommend a component that will take the article headings
from all the articles in the newsflash category and display them in a rotating marquee
on the home page?
I would want to click on the marquee titles to open the full article

Thanks!

Subject: [joomla] Form autofill
Message-ID: <CAHM6=OCOEXS6NvUY-WGScewprU_=VGjYmpKBFPVVdOxjO2jduQ@mail.gmail.com>

A prospect (a school) contacted me and asked if it would be possible to
have a form with autofill, where only current and former students would be
allowed to register.

Something like this:

   - Student fills out name field and year that started in the school
   - Form autofills with student's school registration number
   - School registration number and student name database would be included
   previously

Can this be done? It looks a little TOO much for my Joomla knowledge, as
I'm not a programmer. :-)

This could surely be done but will require a bit of programming, this idea
is basically the same as checking is a email address or username is already
registered, however if it does you return the extending info in your ajax
call.

You can use RS Forms Pro and some ajax calls. Look through the RS Forms 
forums

Usually I put my Joomla websites in a subdirectory so things don't get
messed up at the root directory level.

Question is:

Is it possible to display the site URL as www.domain.com/contact.htmlinstead of
www.domain.com/*site*/contact.html, even though the Joomla instalation
remains under */site*?

You should be able to do something like this with a rewrite rule in an
.htaccess file. See
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3542280/how-to-remove-directory-from-url-using-mod-rewrite
 and
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9516852/remove-directory-from-url-htaccess-apache
for
a couple of examples.
