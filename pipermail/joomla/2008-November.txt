Subject: [joomla] Joomla 1.5 Bug: site suddenly goes blank
Message-ID: <978286.50295.qm@web35602.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I've had this happen several times on different sites and webhosts.  I see messages in the forum but it's hard to search for "blank" in a large forum.

A site that is working fine suddenly goes blank.  I tried echoing text at the top of index.php to debug but nothing is output.

Does anyone know anything about this bug?

It's listing all the good Democratic ideas for a stronger economy?  :)


Is the request hitting the web-server logs, and are there any error
codes? I've not seen it but if it is duplicated from one client to
another I'd check the logs.

Addendum, have you tried different client versions? Mitch and I went
round a problem that eventually pointed to my OS/Browser combination.

Ok, finally getting back into developing with the CMS, after a couple
years doing only framework-based stuff - and I'm coming to the
conclusion that mod_login SUCKS.

Looking around for something to customize, and not finding much of
note. Are any of you enamored of a particular login/logout module?

No it sucks.
One major issue is that you are forced to always go to the same login 
page. You can not give any page in the members only and get there by 
giving a link.

There are also bugs with AOL browser and sometimes with IE.

Really?  That's the first I've heard of that... Infact, the code says otherwise!!!  (You can do it via the return url parameter)...

Yes, but that complicates things.


Lets say a lay person read a nice article in the members only area.
He sends that link in an email to another member, but that link will 
not allow them direct access to that page.

I know in the login module I can specify the page I want them to see 
first, but that is not what I am talking about.

verify, and then create your extension record :-)

Hi Mitch,
I did register an account and verified, 
but I can not find the entrance to submit the extension.
:-(
Thank you for your help.

Message-ID: <330532b60811060934t41ed0b6doc5c1f85fc03ae639@mail.gmail.com>

Here's an interesting thought. Had someone tell me that it is smart to
put the title of the website (sitename) in an H1 for blog lists, with
each article title as H2, but then when you are reading the article
the article title gets H1 and sitename in H2.

Is this really worth it, and are there any smart ways to accomplish
this? You'd need to put logic in your template, as well as core output
overrides.

Yes, the engines give you more credit for the keyword based on text size.
Of course your site, article name must reflect your topic.


Cryptic domain names or trendy article titles will not result in what you want.

Subject: [joomla] Virtuemart -- anyone else having SERIOUS problems with it?!
Message-ID: <436540.55378.qm@web35603.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

The "new" Virtuemart (1.1.x) seems to have some very SERIOUS problems -- such as I go to checkout, type in my bill-to/ship-to info, click "Continue" and the next page in the checkout process shows me someone else's account info!

That's pretty serious.  One person checks out and someone else gets the bill/receipt.

I'm looking at IXXO Cart which is expensive but I would expect that it works.

Anyone have any experience or heard anything about IXXO Cart or the problems with Virtuemart?

Wow, Magento has a coupon configuration I need -- "buy x get y free".  I'm going to download it.  But their paid support is quite expensive!

Unfortunately Virtuemart DOES have serious issues. For one project in particular we ended up spending a ton of hours to fix it.
We've been working with Magento. It's a great product IF (noticed that big IF!) you will basically use the features as-is and just need to reskin it. 
If you need to do some reengineering...be prepared for a steep learning curve and lots of complexity.

You can definitely lose a big client because of VMart.

Magento has lots of great rules that go beyond Buy X get Y Free. There's a video on their site that goes into some detail.

Agreed 100% - but most folks doing serious commerce can afford to hire
their own development team to do complex development. The small fry
has to use what they can get :-)

Yes, but you say that about almost every 3rd party extension! :-)  And then don't give us any of the juicy details about who's doing what in the dev community.

What's with all the high ratings and great reviews for VM on the extensions directory?  I can't be the only one having problems with it.

I have never used Virtuemart, but the problem smells like a residual 
cookie. It might only be occurring because you logged in and out as 
different users, maybe as the admin, or perhaps you were testing it in 
ways that the end user does not. I'm not advocating the acceptance of 
security problems. Just saying that the problem might not be as bad as 
it seems. Something as serious as that would probably make it to the 
front page of the VM forums.

This happened to an actual customer, not just to me testing it out.

And when I tested it I created a new customer account and it billed an actual customer, not one of my testing accounts that I had used on my computer.

So I don't see how it could be a cookie problem.

Message-ID: <642abf2e0811132334j777cec74r5a8229c8874956ab@mail.gmail.com>

I have a cron job on Linux that runs to do an external backup, and I would
like to include the functionality of JoomlaPack to do the same, but run
automatically without the need of an Admin. For those that don't know,
http://www.joomlapack.net/, backups the entire Joomla web site and MySQL
database into a single restorable .zip file. It is also a good utility to
use if you want to make a backup for your Joomla development before you try
out something new on it.
Anyone have suggestions? Or are people simply doing a tar and a MySQL dump
for script run backups of Joomla? Thanks!

That's funny you should mention JoomlaPack.  We just had a discussion about that last night at the Joomla meeting.

Last month I gave a presentation on how to setup an automated backup to a remote server using JoomlaCloner (the slides are online at our website joomlanyc.org).  Last night Brad mentioned JoomlaPack and said he liked that better than JoomlaCloner.

Hi everyone!

I'm looking for a Joomla 1.5 book to recommend to Webmasters. For Webmasters
who are primarily concerned with content management and not programming. So
the Webmaster has an explanation of how to customize the template. Also how
Sections, Categories, Articles and Modules are related and their
capabilities. Tips like how to change the title on the home page, for
example.

Thanks in advance,

David Roth

I'd like to see that discussion happen too; the docs could use some
work. Very difficult to figure out how to set things up initially,
content wise.

Trying to find a way to economize and move forward to Joomla for a

they allow PHP 5 and Joomla. 

Anyone have issues with GoDaddy, or have a better solution that provides
phpBB2, Joomla, and the ability to ssh in and fix things?

Unless you have a small, static website, stay away from Godaddy.  I used to use them for my clients on a tight budget, but it's not worth it.  They don't do backups, yet they also don't allow you to ftp to a remote server or to schedule cronjobs, so all your backups have to be manual and if something happens to the server it's your problem.  They outsource their database server and it's slow.  It's a hassle to get into phpmyadmin -- you have to go through your account, so if you have someone else working on the site they need access to your entire Godaddy account.

i've been using dreamhost for years for small projects and testing  
large sites near-line.  they allow access to everything and have a  
pretty good extensive panel but i would stay away from the one-click  
installs except for initial installation because the upgrades just  
overwrite your tree which makes no sense for joomla.  what i like  
about them is the that the simple $5.95 per month account has  
unlimited domains and subdomains, mysql databases, users and emails,  
ssh etc... which means i can work on anything and everything at once  
in one account and allow friends and family to share in my hosting  
plan with their own users.

they also have a good affiliate program so if you decide to use them  
sign up with my link and i'll get some credits for my hosting and  
domain renewals.

here is the affiliate link so i get credit:
http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?85196

i have many friends who have switched from godaddy to dreamhost  
because they hit a wall really fast in their discounted plans.  hope  
you find one that works for you.

You can still get it from their site, but it doesn't seem to be  
listed on joomla extensions directory anymore

Has anyone tried Joomlearn's online webinar, or heard any feedback about them?

They are having a 4-hr CB webinar this Saturday and it's only $35.

Subject: [joomla] Web Links under articles?
Message-ID: <1227470862.3084.3.camel@leam>

Learning how to set up th emenu to go to a page with articles. So far it
seems I can only have the "Menu Item Type" as only one type, an article,
or something like that. It is possible to have the mainmenu -> Link go
to a page that has articles on top and then a list of "Recommended
Resources" (web links) at the bottom? That would let you put Section
specific links in.

The answer is probably staring me right in the face, but I'm a slow
learner...

Maybe someone has made a module or plugin for the weblinks component.  If so, it might be in the extensions directory.

I think I have it figured out. Mostly just making a new menu and moving
it to whereever I want.

Subject: [joomla] Columns in user3?
Message-ID: <1227483530.3614.6.camel@leam>

Okay, next menu question. I have 4 "Sections" and want to list the main
menu in user3, the bar on top. That part works, but when I add what
should be a drop down or vertical list item under a Section they crowd
the Section items. 

Under "Menu Item Manager" -> "mainmenu", the "Sections" are listed as
"Article >> Section/Blog". Each one has a few sub-headings, and each
sub-heading is "Articles >> Catagory/Blog". Click the sub-heading and
you get the articles and the menu of related links.

Make sense? I've been playing with the new site for a few hours and
might be a bit wonkier than I thought.  :)

Don't forget different templates deal with objects in different ways.
I prefer to have customers pick out the template style they like then
work from there.
If you go to extensions / template manager then select the template
you are working with then click on preview it will show you the layout
of all the objects . Using this it will show you all the locations of
each object.

David, it's not a book but I've recently found the Joomla Quickstart
guide very helpful. The video section ROCK! Check out the first
paragraph of this page:

This book is nothing more than back hack of the help files and
expensive. I gleaned a couple of details from it and donated it away..

http://www.joomlabook.com/ this book is far different..
Its cheaper and addresses many issues it maybe a little deep in places
for content managers tho.

I like the one at joomlabook.com ;)

Seriously, you can get the ebook at informit.com, and here is a coupon for
35% off JOOMLA08

Good luck!
