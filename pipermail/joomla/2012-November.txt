Subject: [joomla] Global Configuration page missing tabs etc
Message-ID: <CALfVZ3_DJQbR6nNoCt=QBq+XO5tQeOxu09sSGAeExJ5O6Wk=sQ@mail.gmail.com>

Came across an odd issue with a Joomla2.5 installation. When I am in the
back end and navigate to Global Configuration page, it shows up as if it
isn't calling the css for that page--no tabs etc. There is also no way to
save it even if I made some changes in the un-styled mode. All other pages
are fine, so I don't believe it is a missing css page. I tried uploading
the bluestork template and the com_config folder  via ftp to overwrite any
file that might have been corrupted, but no change.
I have cleared my cache in my browsers, cleared and purged cache in joomla.
It is a simple site with just a few basic extensions--JCE,Akeeba,RSForms.

Any idea what is causing this and how to fix it? If you need to look at the
backend, I will be happy to send the site name and login info privately.
Thanks,
Ellen

Hi Everyone,
I recently decided I needed to change hosts and decided to go with a
sponsor of JoomlaDayNYC, Bluehost. I reluctantly signed up as a reseller
since I was acting as a liason between my clients and host anyway. Well, it
feels overwhelming to me and I was wondering if there is anyone in the
group who is also a reseller and can help me understand some of the
reseller features, especially the ClientExec billing feature. Looking for a
mentor who can show me the ropes.

I plan to be at the next meeting, weather permitting, and can come in early
to meet.
Ellen

Subject: [joomla] Google Results & Keywords - How do I get listed?
Message-ID: <CABr9RmnD=n_D3S4-bHF8orgvYqU=ebYHd0tV7-9rWqz+cyv4bg@mail.gmail.com>

I've been trying to get my site to appear in Google when searching for
certain key words, and I seem to be getting stumped - I'm showing up on
page 2, not near the top.  Posts by myself or friends about the site appear
before the site itself in the search results.

The key phrases I am looking for are "larp nj" - where the term "larp" is
the kind of activity the site is promoting (it's a kind of game / sport),
and it's based in New Jersey.  Searching on "larp nj" turns up all
our competitors, but not our own site.

I've designed the site with a SEO-friendly template, filled in site
keywords, made sure the front page has text and isn't just a splash page,
etc. - but I can't seem to get the site to come up on results for those key
words.

What am I missing?  How do I get those words to trigger a better result
with my site?

The site itself is: http://www.knightrealms.com

(The odd thing is... we're one of the biggest games out of all
our competitors, DESPITE this ranking thing.  It's more a matter of
technical frustration at this point than a marketing issue... ;-)  )

There is a lot more to real SEO than the basics.

It has a lot to do with the actual content, how you write it. Placements 
on the page etc.

Looking at the source code you have a lot before the any actual content.
You also do not have many inbound links from quality sites.
That is just for starters.

A few suggestions for ?some seo help?

1) use article directorys ?and post original quality articles with a link to the site( or even a page of the site)
?link the keywords

?
?2) make a few web 2.0 ? posts ?that link with keywords to your site !

?3) maybe adjust some of your keywords use Google adword tool it may help also ,I would also place in a better order ?most important to least important?

These are your keywords from the view source :
larp,nj,pa,ny,nyc,new jersey, new york, new york city,pennsylvania,game,fantasy,role playing,knight realms,knight,realms


4) ? join a few Game ?forums and ?post a bit ?get into some conversations( most forums allow a signature link and even a link in your profile ( ?even if link is a no follow ?G sees it !)( also if not allowed a signature link ?no need to join)

5) trade a link with other sites in that niche?

6) ?search for a ?few gaming link directories( must be niche specific and do not do a recipriacal link ( google not like)

Hope that helps and also ?Google is slow so be patiant ?do not expect it overnite or in a week or 2?

Not sure where the glitch occurred, because I have had internet

Geoffrey:

SEO is a process, not a destination.

There are many different factors that google considers to rank web pages.? And no one can give you the definitive
formula, since google holds these secrets close to the chest, to prevent people from gaming the system.
That said, google's goal is to deliver the *best* search results to retain its spot as the the #1 search engine.? Here
are some of the things that will help boost your page rank, while maintaining the integrity of what search is supposed to
be about:



	1. how current is the site:? is the content refreshed regularly?? Or is it old?? this could be why the posts by you and your friends show up first....they are more recent than the site itself.

	2. Inbound links:? from *quality* sites using relevant anchor text.? This is like an independent "vote" that says to google: "hey, we think this site has great content"? links from home page are more valuable.

	3. keyword density:? using keywords that match the pattern of natural language.? don't duplicate content in an effort to boost keyword density.
	4. use unique titles for each page;? meta keywords don't count anymore (they say) but they don't hurt either.? I would use them.

	5. how easy is it for google to index your site?? consistent, clear navigation is the key; large complex sites should include a site map

	6. staying power:? Has the site been around for a while?? and does it plan to stay around?? You can't do much about "back dating" when the site came into existence, but you can buy the domain registration for multiple years out.
there is not a definitive list, just a few suggestions.? good luck

?

Subject: [joomla] Global Configuration page missing tabs etc
Message-ID: <0b6201cdbf5c$99f1ceb0$cdd56c10$@com>

This is my first post to the Joomla list, so please let me know if I'm
following the correct protocol.

 

Hello Ellen,

 

About your configuration page issue: 
Based upon your description, I wonder if you have recently upgraded from 1.5
to 2.5. If so, there may be some old 1.5 files lingering in the folder and
creating havoc. If this is not the case, please describe what has been done
to the site lately and feel free to send me your login information.



Thanks,

Mary

 

Mary Layman

President, TriMedia

Sorry if this comes as a new entry and not as a thread to responses to my
original post, but I can't figure out how to respond to a thread[?]. I get
the digest in my gmail and I can't find a respond link.
Anyway,
It turns out that I had a php.ini file in my
libraries/joomla/database/database/php.ini

 Once I removed it my Global Config. page worked fine.
It turns out that I inadvertently chose to put a php.ini file in all my
directories when I changed my php version with my host. instead of choosing
to only place one in the public_html folder.

Thanks for all the feedback so far.  Here's what I have got:

   - I'm running Google Analytics on the site, and have been working with
   PageSpeed to improve the experience over the past few weeks.
   - For a long, long time, I hadn't known that keywords needed to be
   comma separated... that's been fixed, about 2 weeks ago.
   - Content is semi-regularly updated, and there's a very active forum and
   photo gallery.  We get a LOT of traffic from existing members (Usually
   about 600 visits a day).
   - The site's template is optimized to put the content before the menus
   in the actual code - the central DIV comes up before the two side DIV areas
   do, so content should come first.  The only thing that comes before content
   is the heading banner and the page headers.
   - I'm using Xmap already, and have submitted it to Google.
   - The site's been around for 10 years now, and refreshed regularly over
   that lifetime.

I know I'm short on incoming links, and will be addressing that with our
Staff at the next meeting to get a "quality links campaign" going.

I'll have to re-work some of the key words I am looking to use into
headings - it seems meta & keyword tags are not enough.

The thing that's stupefying me is that our competition is, from what I am
seeing, using static HTML pages run by amateur coders.  The fact that they
are all on the first page, while we're back on page 2, is quite a punch to
the gut... ;-)

I may need to do more snooping on my competition's sites, and figure out
what they are doing that I am not.

Thank you for the advice!

I have enjoyed reading this thread especially since the information 
given is not only very useful but also it is honest and ethical. What 
has not been mentioned are the unethical ways to get higher ratings and 
I greatly appreciate the community for not suggesting these other 
methods. I recently had an incident with a new customer who had his site 
hosted by a Company in the mid-west. He was not happy with service so he 
called me. I created a new Joomla CMS site from the content and design 
he was using with this other company. When the new site went live, I 
noticed something pretty fascinating.  You could do a google search with 
legitimate search terms that you would expect to use to find his 
business. When you got Google search results you also got hits for URL's 
that made no sense at all such as example: http://(Company 
Name)/Rhianna.html or http://(Company Name)/ Christiana Milan.htm. There 
were literally 15-20 hits listed in the google search results that made 
no sense at all.  Of course, these hits were broken once we went live 
with the new site. I did not create redirects on the new site for these 
bogus url's but did for legitimate ones.

My client was paying for SEO and high google ratings from the previous 
web company. I had to explain to him why I could not guarantee those 
same results.  I will do all I can to get a client listed as high as 
possible in search engines but I will not do the unethical redirects and 
garbage that I see people do to get higher search results. Some of these 
SEO Companies are just snake oil salesmen.  I will not charge and/or 
promise something that is basically undeliverable through honest means. 
Luckily, my new client appreciated my honesty and is not interested in 
higher search engine rankings through unethical tricks.

There is so much more to SEO than what you get from most articles.
Having now started to build my own Search Engine bot, I am beginning to 
create formulas to find what I want.

The results I get from an index tells me so much.

I can target a page that has what I want and I often do not get what I 
want from KW.

I need to move a joomla site from one hosting server to another hosting account
AND in the process, I need to change the domain name of the website.

Luckily, both hosting services use cpanel interface, which makes it easy to move the
site...however, how do I change the domain name.? I thought there would be something
in the config.php file, but I don't see it..

?
Thanks!

if your site is built correctly you should just need to point any domain
name at the site and it should work out of the box.

I actually ran into this myself, and this DID work.  I had a site set up as
www.domain.com/test, and then converted it to test.domain.com - all I had
to do was set up the subdomain to point to /test, and it worked.

If you want to be EXTRA sure, you can use an extension to check for broken
links after the move.  I purchased this for sanity's sake when I was
maintaining a very large Joomla site with a ton of documentation, and it
was a life saver:

http://www.qlue.co.uk/joomla-extensions-15-a-16/joomla-broken-link-checker.html

If possible, can you point the old domain name at the new server, at least
temporarily, so that both domains resolve to the new cPanel account? That
might help.

If you're using Google Analytics / Web Tools, you can tell it your site
moved and changed names, which might also help.

NoNumber DB Replacer is a powerful, if slightly less scary way, of doing
direct changes to your DB - just back up first!

Also, Akeeba Backup will, I think, help you reconfigure your Joomla's
settings for a new domain, hosting account, etc. when you restore a site.

Hi Janet.

It depends on how the website we built if the domain name is referenced in
the Joomla MySQL database tables. To see if this is the case, I recommend
doing a mysqldump of the existing Joomla website. Then bring it up in an
editor to search for the name of the domain. If the domain doesn't occur
anyplace, then you don't have to be concerned about the database part. If
it is, then you will need to do a change. Be careful as a global change
might not be what is best.

Then check the configuration.php file for db, user, password, tmp and log
files path. Even though they might not be related specifically to the
domain, the new environment is going to most likely have a new directory
path to host Joomla for you.

Then re-create the mysql databases on the new hosting service, making sure
you change it to their new name in the mysqldump output (.sql) which was
created. Then load the changed mysql back in. Pay attention to the full
name the shared hosting service uses for the MySQL database. They often
pre-append your account name, which MySQL treats as part of the MySQL
database's name. For example, if your account name on the shared hosting
service is foobaz and you filled in though CPANEL that you want the name of
the database to be tux, the MySQL databases it creates on there will be
called foobaz_tux. Make sure this is correct in your configuration.php.

With the linux command line you can create a compressed tar file of the
entire Joomla root directory and copy that over via sftp.

Hope that helps!

Subject: [joomla] What's a good SEO / SEF tool for Joomla 2.5?
Message-ID: <CABr9Rm=iCPmUyridmsM5O1TU_ax280-_8q0wSZytEotLLWmxkg@mail.gmail.com>

I've been working on improving my site's ranking, with a lot of help from
this group - thank you all!

One of the big things I did recently was get rid of an older component
(JFusion) that had ugly URLs, and replaced it with something with more
clean & friendly looking URLs (JoomGallery, instead of using JFusion to
bridge to something else).  In addition, I've done a bunch with image
optimization, etc. to help speed up the site, and other things recommended
by PageSpeed.

I'm now looking for a good SEO / SEF utility for Joomla.  I have Xmap
installed already - I'm looking for something that will help with metadata,
keywords, etc.

I was looking at MijoSEF, which is free... but it breaks JoomGallery unless
you pay for a plugin.

Can anyone recommend a good component?  Even if it's not free, if it's
worth the money, that's a good thing!

Hi Jeffrey,

When I need to use a SEF extension, I turn to MijoSEF. I've used a number
of the well known ones, and MijoSEF works great (better?) and the support
is very good. It is true that you need to buy extension specific plugins,
for non-core extensions, but only if you want MijoSEF to interact with that
extension. If you don't buy their extension plugins, you can configure
MijoSEF so that those extensions use core SEF URLs instead.

Best,

Matt

Head over to the JED and check out AceSEF and the classic sh404SEF.

If you are using Joomla 2.5 and 3.0, I personally think the native features
work as well as any extension/plugin. You can manage meta information and
create SEF links without the extensions so why bother to add more code to a
system that is already in place.

As for increasing performance, JBetolo works very well - it does things
like combine multiple CSS and JS files and can make your site download
faster (or at least appear like it does :-), But it is super easy to screw
up your site with JBertolo. It is not well documented and you have to
experiment. If you use JBetolo test  it first before moving it to
production.

Just a side note, AceSEF is now essentially replaced by MijoSEF. My
understanding is that all of the developers at AceSEF left that company and
started their own, due to differences of opinion... kind of like Mambo and
Joomla. Since the split, service and support is much better, and they seem
more open to new ideas and feature improvements.

I do agree with Stephen about not using SEF extensions,
and personally prefer not use them when I can. But, they do help resolve
the inherent issue with Joomla having multiple URLs for the same page and
do allow for more granular customization of non-menu item URLs.

Thank you Matt for the update on AceSEF. It can be difficult to keep track
of all these extension companies.

Thank you, guys - because this is a large site that I took on long before I
even heard the term "SEO," I need some help - Mijo sounds like it's the
tool for the job. :-)

Thank you!

Hello,
I hope all is well with everybody.
I need to set up a site so unwanted visitors to the admin login (www.domain.com/administrator) are redirected to either a 404 page or Not Found page.
I currently have SH404SEF installed but I do not know how to set this up.
Plus, i'm curious to know how i will have access to the admin login after this is set up.
Thanks,
Paul Elliott

There's a commercial extension that will help with this along with other
options (such as logging and email notifications):

The last time i used jSecure, it was buggy for me and a lot of users.
Do you know how to configure this in SH404SEF?

Subject: [joomla] Published, but Pending
Message-ID: <CABr9RmmyWy1Heg41tuV+Fy-ABtzW0ZNE==rbV_JskFWdG7SKGw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a Joomla site where registered users can publish articles.
 (Registration is only through LDAP back to a corporate domain, so it's not
completely open...).

When a non-Admin user creates an article, the status goes to "Published,
but is Pending" under User Article Manager.

I googled this up, and the common cause seems to be that it's set to be
published in the future - i.e., two hours from now.  I checked the Time
Zone on Joomla, my cPanel, and the PHP configuration, and they are all set
to America/New_York

When I check the article in the back end, it shows up as being published at
13:13:59, and the current (last edited) time is 13:20:00, so
it's definitely after the time it should be published.

This is on Joomla 2.5.8 - any idea what's causing this behavior?  It seems
to resolve itself after some time, leading me to believe it's time related,
but I can't figure out what's triggering it.

Thank you!

If you redirect www.domain.com/administrator to
www.domain.com<http://www.domain.com/administrator>,
no one will ever be able to log into the back end ;-)

My recommendation is to use Admin Tools,
https://www.akeebabackup.com/products/admin-tools.html, which allows you to
require a secret key to access the admin login.

I got this figured out - it was a combination of server time, and the time
setting within Joomla.

Originally, both the Server and Joomla were set to America/New_York - I
embedded a time function into a module, and saw PHP return a value that was
the current time, but in GMT instead of EST.  Once I changed Joomla to be
GMT, it returned the correct time, and the article published normally.

Is there a way to set up a global redirect that essentially

redirect them to the website home page?

If you use sh404sef, you can redirect them to a custom page that says something to the effect "... the page is not available but here are other similar pages you may be interested in..." and a list of links to some existing pages that may be of interest.

Hi Janet,

You could use an extension like sh404SEF and map all the individual links
to the new pages.

However, as you mention, there will be many old pages that won't be
republished. In that case, I would create a custom 404 page - error.php and
use the search module.

There is a good tutorial in Joomla docs that explains how to do this:

http://docs.joomla.org/Creating_a_Custom_404_Error_Page

All best,

Steve

Ah, essentially a custom 404 page. Good idea!

You can even do something like that with adding an error.php file to your
template if you don't want to install a SEF extension.

I posted a similar question earlier today.
I want to have the admin login page redirected to either a 404 or Not Available page (as you mentioned) that still has the header to top content of the site.
The main reason for this is to avoid uninvited guests to the admin page.
How do i do that using SH404sef and still have access to the admin login myself?
Thanks,
Paul Elliott

1) how many pages do you have to redirect?
2) How are they set up? Static HTML or do the old pages have parameters?

This extension will also help - I use it on my sites, as it gives a much
nicer page, and it's still in Joomla:

Sounds like this could done easily with a system plugin you could make or
check for a secret key so you would have to login like

The primary concern right now is the admin login page on this particular site.
I want to hide it with a redirect but still have access to it myself.
There are no other pages at the moment but i wanted to be prepared for the near distant future.
How do i do this with SH404sef (or is there a more common way of doing it in Joomla)?

The reason I said to use sh404sef -- You can create an article page and Joomla and use that as your custom 404 page.? It doesn't have to be a static hardcoded page.? It will have your Joomla template -- header, footer, etc.

I posted a similar question earlier today.
I want to have the admin login page redirected to either a 404 or Not Available page (as you mentioned) that still has the header to top content of the site.
The main reason for this is to avoid uninvited guests to the admin page.
How do i do that using SH404sef and still have access to the admin login myself?
Thanks,
Paul Elliott

Paul, you will have to use an extension for that if you're not going to code it yourself.? There are admin tools for that.? I think RSJoomla had a security tool that did that.? I don't know off the top of my head if Akeeba's Admin Tools do that, but someone did mention that component.

I'll give those a try. I tried jSecure some years ago but it was very buggy.

Did you try rebuild menu when you go to menu manager ,
  I was having same issue with sobioPRO and
with diqus

and then rebuild fixed everything
but first you have to check in averithing clean cache and to purge 
expired cache

It's easy.

Delete the old menu and then make sure you delete the deleted menu from
trash.

Then build a new menu.

My bad. I thought you were talking about regular menus. Sorry.

Where is this site located? Is it local, like on your Mac or PC or is it on
a web server?

I have been using Joomla for a long time and this is the first time that I
have heard of someone having an issue with an admin menu.

You might be better off starting over rather than trying to fix it.

What version of Joomla are you using? 1.5, 2.5 or 3.0

And if you are using 2.5 are you using the default Bluestork menu?

You can also try switching to another admin template. Joomla usually ships
with two admin templates - Bluestork and Hathor.

It would be easier to help if you could provide more details about your
project - Joomla version, templates being used, where is the site being
hosted? etc.

2.5 bluestork
I just uploaded a new version of the template and it seems to be functioning better.
I think it was a template issue.

I would agree with Donna, discuss this with Akeeba Backup... I would be
concerned as maybe the install didn't work properly and that is why the
menu item isn't there...be careful with just 'rebuilding', when something
else could be going on.

Akeeba said its a joomla 2.5 issue that they have been dealing with for months. I've never seen it outside of this template.

Actually, I believe it has more to do with the template (joomlxtc). The same thing just happened with another component.

Thanks for sharing. I've used Akeeba on 1.5.x sites only. Didn't know there
were problems under 2.5

Steve,
I like your suggestion of creating a custom 404 page....I've had too many experiences
with plugins and components and modules causing conflicts.? The tutorial you reference 
doesn't work for yoo themes....And while yoo themes does provide documentation on
how to create custom pages, the docs are not updated as there is no offline.php file in the layouts folder...


Following is a quote from the yoothemes doc page at 

http://www.yootheme.com/themes/documentation/customizing/customize-the-error-pages

*************************************************************************

The HTML output of the error and offline pages are located in /warp/layouts within your theme. 
	* Error Pages: /warp/layouts/error.php
	* Offline Pages: /warp/layouts/offline.php
***********************************************************************************

Anyone know how to create error pages for yoo themes?

?
Janet

Hi Janet,

You could use an extension like sh404SEF and map all the individual links to the new pages. 

However, as you mention, there will be many old pages that won't be republished. In that case, I would create a custom 404 page - error.php and use the search module.

There is a good tutorial in Joomla docs that explains how to do this:

http://docs.joomla.org/Creating_a_Custom_404_Error_Page

All best,

Steve

I have to admit that my experiece with YooTheme is limited, but I would
think that you could just go into the error.php and edit the file. Have you
tried that?

Another suggestion is if there are not a lot of "dead pages" that you could
use Joomla's built-in Redirect Manager.
http://www.siteground.com/tutorials/joomla25/redirect_manager.htm

I would also check with YooTheme and ask how you could set up a custom
error page.

All best,

Steve

Subject: [joomla] are these hack attempts?
Message-ID: <1354019726.53014.YahooMailNeo@web122306.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

I am seeing "expired links" appear in the redirects component for a redesigned/updated website
using an old domain name.? I can't figure out where the expired links are coming from, and I am
wondering if the links are possible hacks or attacks on the site?

the format of the links are
www.valid_domain_name.com/frontend/personnel/valid_name_of_staff_member.php

there is nothing on the old site or the new site with? "frontend" in the url AND the site
does not use the php extension for any of the pages.? Could this urls be some sort of attempted
attack on the site?? I haven't installed admin tools yet, but plan to do so in the next few days.
Thanks!

?

Hi Janet,

Yes, they are attempts to discover the presence of certain files to be
exploited. If you monitor your error logs closely, you'll see numerous
attempts like this every day. I wouldn't worry too much about them, but
certain tools will monitor these attempts and block the IP addresses of
repeat offenders .

By the way, my favorite is http://example.com/wp-admin

It may be a bot-generated attempt to index your site, or something
similar - it costs very little to input names into a script and run
such searches.

That being said, I recently came across this tool for running a
security audit on your own Joomla sites:

https://audit.myjoomla.com/

The first audit is free, and you can pay either per-audit after that,
or get a subscription (monthly) to run as many as you would like.  It
works by uploading a component to your Joomla site, and the audit site
connects to it and runs checks against your site / server for known
issues (exploitable code, bad / good practices, versions of Joomla,
PHP, etc.).  The service is run by Phil Taylor, whom I have seen in
the Joomla community for a while - I feel the service can be trusted,
and is not a hack / vulnerability itself.

Subject: [joomla] Video consultation plugin for CMS
Message-ID: <CAMp_=PVugAsQABeDf0Xdk6KkGfv3SuFnF5q6KFFNcz0qKaZt7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone, I was wondering if any of you know of a good video
consultation software plugin for all CMS's. I have an educational site
under development in WordPress where a video "classroom environment" is
needed. We've been testing with Video Whisper, but it is very slow, and
they don't provide a support phone number, only tickets, which usually has
a long response time. So far the other video plugins that I've found are
outside of the U.S., and if they have a support phone number it is costly
without an international calling plan.

Thanks in advance,
Thad Jasonis
