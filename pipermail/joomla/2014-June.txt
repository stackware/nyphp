Hello everyone,

Till a little while ago when I did a search for my website and the google
serp showed a link or links to my site the google+ box would show on the
right column of the google page. Somehow it no longer shows. Any one have
any idea why? And maybe how I can re-instate the relationship between my
site and google+.

Yes I have a google plus account and page and webmaster tools account.

Subject: [joomla] error when upgrading from 2.5 to 3.3
Message-ID: <CALfVZ38YLnRK68pZH1Q8V-=1xk1q=4oCj1XgSe9qjTFG=Z-WqA@mail.gmail.com>

I recently upgraded a Joomla site from 2.5.22 to 3.3.1.
When I log into the back end, I get the following error message:
1054 Unknown column '' in 'order clause' SQL=SELECT * FROM
`irzeh_postinstall_messages` WHERE `extension_id` = '700' AND `enabled` =
'1' ORDER BY `` ASC
Under it is a button to go to the control panel. It does not go there (that
is where the error occurs) but it does enable the navigation, so i am able
to navigate everywhere in the back end except the Control Panel and the
Components>Post-Installation Messages.
The front end is functioning fine.
Does anyone know what might have caused this and how to fix it?
Ellen

I recently upgraded a 3.1 site to 3.2 and had a similar symptom.  The font end up and the back end was down.

 

I found an answer here from

===========

 

The best thing to do in these cases is search google, removing your table prefix.

 

In other words, you are more likely to get a match on 

 

_postinstall_messages` WHERE `extension_id` = 

 

than

 

irzeh_postinstall_messages` WHERE `extension_id` = 

 

since other people don't have your table prefix.
