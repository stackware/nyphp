Hi
I am considering hiring someone to 
develop an extensive online quiz program 
with php/MySQL.  I am not sure if it 
would be a good idea to use Joomla as 
the website for this application or if I 
should leave it up to the developer to 
create a new website.

Are there any considerations I shoudl be 
aware of if using Joomla?

Thanks
Gene

Hi
I am considering hiring someone to develop an extensive online quiz 
program with php/MySQL.  I am not sure if it would be a good idea to use 
Joomla as the website for this application or if I should leave it up to 
the developer to create a new website.

Are there any considerations I shoudl be aware of if using Joomla?

Thanks
Gene

Joomla! could be a good place to start. 

However if you go the Joomla! route you could just extend  another polls project and offer it back to the community.  

One consideration is if you go that route, hire someone familiar with Joomla! not just php.

Dear Gene,

Joomla is a great framework and I would probably use Joomla for this quiz
program.
All my new Joomla projects are for Joomla 1.6 and I recommend you to do the
same if you decide to use Joomla.

Kind regards,

Joomla would offer you a method to control the users, but the quiz part 
has other considerations.
Is the test going to be progressive?
Will each question depend on previous questions?
Will the questions be weighted in terms of difficulty?
Will they be random?
I once designed a quiz system that allowed for different variables so 
that no two tests were every the same.
ie if Bob left NY at 8:00 driving at 55 mph heading south on 95 and 
George entered 95 north 100 miles due south and he was traveling 65 mph 
what time will they pass each other [no traffic or tolls].
The test would change all the numbers each time.

Limesurvey is THE PHP/MySQL open source survey application on the web..
http://www.limesurvey.org/

<http://www.limesurvey.org/>Joomla integration for it is....adequete.

Outside of that, consider Joomla components that provide what you need.

RedComponent has an interesting module for running competitions,
http://redcomponent.com/redcompetition

Having run a few of these "draw a random user" competitions, I can say that
having it all pre-packaged is certainly convenient.

Perhaps a Inned to better explain what I'm trying to accomplish by 
having someone create an extensive Quiz/database program for my site.  
The following link shows a few sample tests, similar to what I'd like to 
use on my website.  In addition to that, you can see that, on that page, 
several quiz links are listed along with stats for each quiz.  I would 
probably have about 30 quizzes per page based on topics.

Woudl it be easy and feasable to incorporate that page into my Joomla 
site?  Would I use a wrapper to display a page like that, if I have 
someone else create a program for me.

Sorry if my questions seem "novice-like."  I am only an advanced 
beginner with Joomla.

Gene

I suspect you could take advantage of an existing extension for Joomla
and save the effort. There are several forms extensions, and I do
believe some of the CCKs are smart enough for something like this as
well.

Anyone else on the list have a strong opinion on forms extensions -
what to use, what to avoid?

Message-ID: <AANLkTinGyrxg3_8NsZ-GoCPKsGgQXE23_=jL9m6gbQM5@mail.gmail.com>

I hope I am not breaking any protocols with my question as I lurk more than
post.

A week ago I was handed a project at work (United Nations Division for
Sustainable Development) so I put together a Joomla site based on their
concept. The site has been well received with new request and my own
concerns.

   - Adding extensions, community, ACL, forms, surveys, blogs
   - Access to documents and multiple languages
   - Security
   - Linking to static sites and converting a large static site to a CMS

There are two sandbox and a live version running. We expect to have multiple
contributors adding content. I think this is the first site here using a
CMS. Only recently there have been evaluations here using PHP based Open
source platforms and the results were in favor of WordPress and Drupal.

If you have time to chat maybe lunch in Manhattan, I would be most grateful
for any insight.The project is for a conference on sustainable development
in 2012. I think Joomla is a great fit and would like to provide a good
solution here at the UN that will portray Open Source and Joomla positively.
We are located at 44th st. Two United Nations Plaza.

Thank you in advance - Bill Bly

Hi William,

I have been working with Joomla since late 2006 and agree that it is
probably the best for your purpose. If you want to develop a
community, there are several good extensions available. I like
Jomsocial, but it depends on the scope of your project.

Your plan calls for multiple contributors and Joomla's admin
structure, based on the newspaper editorial model, with Registered
Users, Authors, Editors and Administrators, is well suited for this
project.

I have done projects with Drupal, geared more towards coders with
extensive its database hooks, but not as user-friendly with a steep
learning curve, and WordPress, which is easy to extend and works fine
for blogs, but doesn't support the hierarchy framework that your
project requires.

It sounds like you have already done a lot of research on Joomla. Like
most big projects, it is best to have a good idea of what the audience
wants and how the contributors work before coming up with a design.

If you would like to talk more, I can make some time next week for
lunch. (I am not expecting much. A hot dog, a bottle of Poland Spring,
and a park bench in the shade is fine with me.)

You should also be aware that there is a very friendly Joomla user
group in New York. The next meeting should be next Thursday. You might
want to attend to meet other Joomla developers.

Let me know if you would like to meet and which day is good for you.

All the best,

Steve

I know when we first started the Joomla NYC group, which meets every 
month at Lincoln Center currently, one of the members there worked at 
the U.N. and had deployed Joomla internally.

That said, I will say that the most important factor to me in choosing 
between Joomla and Drupal would be to evaluate what is already being 
used internally and to go with the CMS being used internally.

 From an end user point of view, Drupal is laid out in an easier to pick 
up on and use manner than Joomla[end user being your content editors and 
publishers].  From a configuration point of view, you will likely be 
able to get Joomla up to speed and running much more quickly than Drupal.

I recently posted my own comparison on these items.  You can find the 
same modules or components for both
CMS's....  Joomla will be much easier and faster to setup and configure, 
with less need for custom programming.  Drupal will take longer but for 
some of the more extreme intricacies will actually be faster to custom code.

>     * Access to documents and multiple languages

Joomla seems to have the edge here....being built with multiple 
languages in mind.  Though that may just be because I have yet to look 
extremely deepling into Drupal's language capabilities.

Both Drupal and Joomla have import programs.  Also interestingly, if 
your running on Apache the default htaccess files, designed primarily 
for SEF links, have an added interesting component.  Both of them are 
designed to check for the existance of a file FIRST and use that, then 
if not found, redirect the connection to the CMS.

So, for example, say your structure is:

www/index.php <-- CMS entry point
www/articles/aboutus.html
www/articles/contactnumbers.html

Now, if someone is to try to go to:
http://www.mydomain.com/articles/aboutus.html they will be given the 
aboutus.html file
if they went to
http://www.mydomain.com/articles/about.html, since no about.html file 
exists, instead the index.php program is executed


So in the end, it is more about what is the best tool for your team, as 
either tool works.  My tendency is to use what others are using 
successfully if there is such deployed internally rather than create 
competing systems....that way internally it is easier to transfer skills.

Hi Gary

Thanks for the feedback I would certainly like to meet them especially if
they are still working at the UN. I am new here.

There is no Open source being used or CMS similar as far as I know.

I read your  post it was helpful. I went with Joomla having used it for a
while since 2006. We were able to go live quickly last week and the site has
already been noted

Well according to those I am working with, we are breaking ground using a
CMS like this. I know there are many features that may suit our needs. I
offered a fast track solution that can be customized moving forward. I also
mentioned a terrific community that shares as is my experience attending
events and these replies.  - thanks   - Bill

Hi folks,

Just to hop in out of the blue, the US has a JDay in SF on Oct 1-3 and  
one here in DC on Oct 16. Have you all solidified a date? If not, any  
chance it can be on a weekend other than those two?

Cheers!

I just came across Gantry.

Haven't really looked INTO it, but read 1.6 will be able to do what Gantry
does.

As a web designer, I like things that allow me to move stuff around, change
colors, place things etc.

Is J1.6 to provide the same as (or close to) Gantry?

Thanks

Dear Helvecio,

I have J!1.6 beta 5 installed and I've just checked and it does not seem to
have any of the Gantry features.

I'm not a fan of Gantry because I'm not a designer like yourself and mostly
because my users have to disable the Build Spans feature in order to work
with MooFAQ<http://ideal.fok.com.br/joomla-extensions/component-moofaq.html>
.

Kind regards,

Douglas Machado

Gantry and Joomla! 1.6 are two different animals.

Gantry is a free template created by Rocket Theme. It is based on the
960 Grid System. http://960.gs
Basically, it is a Joomla template covered with modules. I have tested
it and it's fun to experiment, but I would never use it for a project
because it would require too much modification. I find it easier to
code a custom template than to work with Gantry.

As you know from using Joomla. A Joomla template is only two files -
index.php and template.css (I don't want to forget the XML file too!).
And if you have a good understanding of CSS and where to place the
jdoc files, anything is possible in Joomla.

As for Joomla 1.6. I have been too busy to download the beta, but I
have heard that most Joomla 1.5 templates work in Joomla 1.6 or will
work with minor modification. I think the big improvements with 1.6
are geared more towards developers and end users than designers. Among
the additions (and subtractions) are extended ACL (access control
levels), elimination of the three level category system, a revised and
renamed front page manager, and many other things that I can wait to
try out :-)

I think he's referring to the new template structure and functions available in 
1.6 vs. Gantry.

My experience with all these template frameworks is that their a nightmare
to work with.  Instead of dealing with a few php files and a few css files,
suddenly you have css files being included in other css files dynamically
and a whole new system to learn.

I figure if I am going to learn a whole new system, I'd rather learn
something more generic like HAML and CSScafold....  at least then instead of
inventing my own system from cloth, I'd be using an existing system with
rules and such.

Does anyone have experience using Rochen? We used akeeba to move a site
there and now the editors are not working?
Joomla FCK "The server didn't reply with a proper XML data. Please check
your configuration."
Joomla CK - link path are incorrect. Rochen "it is a scripting problem"
The same site was also moved to another server and works fine.

We chose Rochen for security but if we can't use the editors or link
properly we are stuck.

Anyone with a similar experience moving a site anywhere? thanks - Bill

I am a new user to Joomla and I am
looking for a source to either create or
download templates. 
My friend referred me to
www.artisteer.com.  

Is this a good choice or should I be
exploring other sources first.

That's interesting because I had some strange problems with them years ago, and 
I moved back to my current host.

On another note, I would recommend using JCE Editor over JoomlaFCK.  I used to 
use JoomlaFCK until I realized how good JCE was and all the options available.

Joomla CK - link path are incorrect. Rochen "it is a scripting problem"
The same site was also moved to another server and works fine.

We chose Rochen for security but if we can't use the editors or link properly we 
are stuck.

Anyone with a similar experience moving a site anywhere? thanks - Bill

I am a new user to Joomla and I am
looking for a source to either create or
download templates. 
My friend referred me to
www.artisteer.com.  

Is this a good choice or should I be
exploring other sources first.

Hi Sue and welcome to Joomla! 

I've used Artistseer for many templates and as you learn more about css and other aspects of template design, it's a great tool to get started. Many are far more advanced with Artistseer than I am and you can browse their gallery. 

There's many sites like Rockettheme, JoomlaPraise, JoomlaBamboo to find templates, some are free and some are by subscription.

Had to do over, I would have started with Rockettheme and Artistseer, personally.

Hi,

Sorry but I prefer www.joomlart.com or www.gavick.com, i don't like the
Artistseer results. ;( we found the commercial templates more professionals
and for me is better use a commercial template and modify than anything
maked with Artistserr.

You can find all the templates clubs and free templates in
www.bestofjoomla.com

Lucas

I like JoomlArt
Templates<http://www.joomlart.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1191_0_1_15>,
because they use the Joomla framework and don't add JQuery or hard code
MooTools 1.2.4 to their templates.

I don't want to discuss which JS library is better, but I suggest you to run
away from Joomla templates that use other javascript libraries other than
MooTools, which is the default default javascript library for Joomla.
I've had many problems with some templates loading over 300Kb of javascript,
which for me is just unacceptable.

Kind regards,

I'm a big fan of:

www.yootheme.com
www.joomlashack.com

The yootheme templates are beautiful out of the box.  

The joomlashack templates are a little more 'flat', however they are very easy 
to edit and modify if you know css, especially optimuspro, it is amazing what 
can be done with a simple template.

I have tried RocketTheme, YooTheme, JoomlaPraise, and JoomlaBamboo.  

I have had much better luck working with YooTheme than any of the others.  

However, RocketTheme's support is incredible.  

YooTheme's support is smart-alecky.  

The recent JoomlaBamboo template I used was buggy, had to submit bug reports.

Hi,
I had posted an earlier question but need clarification.
I am interviewing people to create a php-MySQL Quiz program.
I am not sure if it will be better to have them create a Joomla module 
and component or if a separate
core php website would be easier.

I am aware that there are several quiz components for Joomla, but they 
really don't have the
functionality that I desire.

I would like a pop-up quiz that displays one question at a time then 
displays feedback after that.

Would there be any significant limitations if this were to be created 
inside Joomla?
Any suggestions woudl be most welcome.

Thanks,
Gene

That would not be the cause as it is a front end issue.
The same template is being used on a second site without any issue.

I also changed the template, same issue.
No one has access to the site, but me.
Not a permission issue.

I need to make changes to a website that is using mosets tree.

I need to stop the system from emailing the administrator whenever a new
user registers on the website. I didn't find any setting to turn this
off. Perhaps I missed it somewhere. I'm thinking that I have to override
the com_user view to stop this.

I also want to change the onscreen registration greeting. I want it to
greet the new registrant by their user name and not their real name.
Again, best to override com_user view?

I'm using JCE for the editor for registered users to post. I've stripped
it down a bit. Problem with it is that it uses a <br /> for carriage
returns. I want it to use <p />. Even though I set that int the JCE
configuration, it seems to always use <br />. Any ideas on how to change
this behavior?

Thanks,
Mark

The total history::
I first noticed a problem that articles were not displaying, under one 
menu class. Articles were displaying everywhere else.
Now ion all other cases there was no real content, so I just had a 
couple of characters so I could save the article.
In testing the same articles in the other menus they also did not appear.
I the template I was using worked fine on another site I had just 
built.. The main difference was that in one case I uploaded via ftp the 
Joomla core and in the problem site I used command line. That should not 
be an issue. The two sites were on different machines.
I then uploaded com_contents from scratch. Still nothing. I uploaded the 
entire core again and still nothing.
I then realized that one article was showing. It was on I had added. It 
also had just a few characters. I soon learned that it was the amount of 
characters (19).
I switched servers and still had the same issue.

Finally I decided to start from scratch. I will preserve the weird 
installs and try and find the issue.

I used to have a small tutorial on how to do this, but I lost it.

I have a 3-collumn layout and I want the left collumn to dissapear entirely
on the front page. The content collumn should flow to the left and take the
space left.

How can I do that? Help please!

Thanks in advance!

As long as you don't have any modules published in that column for that page, 
the column should collapse.  Unless you're using a very old template that 
doesn't allow for collapsing module positions.

Go to Module Manager and see if there are any modules published to "All" pages.  
If there are not, filter the list by the name of the left column (usually 
"left"), and open each one to make sure it's not set to display on the home 
page.

Actually I'd live the <div id="left"> tag to dissappear entirely, when there
is no module assigned to it.

You should use $this->countModules('left') in template to conditionally 
render the div.

Just found the answer.

<?php if (JRequest::getVar('view') != 'frontpage'): ?>
<div id="xxxx">
<jdoc:include type="component" />
</div>
<?php endif ?>

SOOO easy! Works like a charm!

Hi all -

What is a good online resource that can address newbie problems?  I'm
building a site using various modules, (menus, image sliders, etc).  I'd
like that when the user clicks on an option from a drop down menu, the
selected article is slightly redesigned.  (Specifically colors, backgrounds,
icon specific to that selected article..  The actual structure from the main
page does not change).

Thanks! Looking forward to replies...
