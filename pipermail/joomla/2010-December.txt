Subject: [joomla] Observations at Noble Desktop's free Joomla seminar
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=ycuQ0Sie-FMHHhNtDkR9JkTPUTFWRgO=wmosn@mail.gmail.com>

I was in SoHo today meeting with a potential client and noticed that
Noble Desktop was also holding a free "Build a Joomla website in an
hour" presentation a few blocks away so I checked it out.

The place was packed. Every seat was taken. I estimate that there were
at least 40 people in the room. All newbies and all asking good
questions, including the usual "How does Joomla! compare to Drupal and
WordPress?" Fortunately, the person giving the seminar is a Joomla!
fan.

It would be great if we could get more people to come to our monthly
meetings. As much as I enjoy hanging out with the dozen or so folks
who attend every month, it would great to expand the group. I know
that the WP Meet Up attracts between 60 to 100 to its monthly meetings
and between 20 to 40 people attend Drupal NYC.

We need to think about attracting new members to Joomla NYC in 2011.

I've LOVE to see new blood in this group - so go ahead and promote the
meets. What do we do when 100 people show up?

That's pretty much been our problem from the start, we've never had a
space big enough to accommodate that many people.

Also consider how to tackle the conundrum of folks with very different
interests: newbies, gearheads, designers, managers..

Definitely food for thought, and answers to the above challenges are desired ;-)

Message-ID: <053801cb9298$81bd1d10$85375730$@com>

Good evening,

I want to include Vimeo videos in line with content in a 1.0.x version of
Joomla!  I was wondering if anyone could point me at a mambot or alternative
solution for making it work?

The client is using TinyMCE and we want to include iFrame content.

If not, I will be forced into coding something and I am not really that
interested in doing that work right now.  Please help...


Thanks in advance,
Hans

I think if you disable the editor you can include the iframe manually.  In
the text area and it will load.  So for a specific use make no editor and
try the post

That was  a brilliant idea!  Thanks...  I am done posting the videos.  What
a relief that there was no coding required tonight.   Long live the Joomla!
list at NYPHP.

The Drupal group adheres to a strict schedule. They also have a break 
out  session for newbies and other topics.
But to grow requires people committed to growing the group.
That means active campaigning and promoting.

Personally I like the intimacy of our group meetings.   Over 30 people means
that you really don't get to know each other etc...we would also have to
find a bigger space...

I am sure if we have an intro session we will draw a lot more people for
that specific session.

Maybe once 1.6 comes out we could have an intro on 1.6...overview...

Bigger is not necessarily better.
I think we could do some more events geared to specific areas ? newbies, development, a specific component.

Maybe if you keep the core group as is and have JoomlaDayNYC type events on a monthly or quarterly basis.
Just a thought.

If we can line up a space that would facilitate the creation of small groups
we can prepare each month to have presenters from the core with material
suitable for each identified interest group.
Have a featured presenter but if there are newbies or gearheads or
designers, etc. that want to breakout in a session more specific to their
interests they go with their small group presenter.
Once we have the space and the presenters lined up then we make a push to
market JUG more aggressively.
I don't know about securing space but I'd be happy to present or
brainstorm/implement marketing JUG.

I've LOVE to see new blood in this group - so go ahead and promote the
meets. What do we do when 100 people show up?

That's pretty much been our problem from the start, we've never had a
space big enough to accommodate that many people.

Also consider how to tackle the conundrum of folks with very different
interests: newbies, gearheads, designers, managers..

Definitely food for thought, and answers to the above challenges are desired
;-)

What we need is people willing to put in the time to make sure we have 
presentations.

After the new board, we need to form groups that will get the job done.

Subject: [joomla] Always use SSL?
Message-ID: <AANLkTim8t73WbmnBXDHHa3pnQFhCOAv8hHyqcceh8rJr@mail.gmail.com>

With the release of Firesheep....and my nomadic system lifestyle, I am
seriously reconsidering my former view of "man in the middle" attacks as a
low priority issue.

Looking over the Remember Me plugin, I note that it is easily hijacked via
Firesheep to allow a user without too much technical sophistication to
impersonate someone on a Joomla powered website if it is connected to
through normal HTTP instead of HTTPS.

The simple solution, which I am implementing for myself, is to setup a VPN
to an external system on the internet and tunnel all my traffic through
there.  That at least removes the issue with open wifi access.

While self signed certificates can cause general users to become
uncomfortable and not wish to continue on a website, for my own sanity I'm
thinking a short little plugin that always redirects specific users who log
on to the https connection to log on again would be in order.

I am glad you mentioned Firesheep.

I have warning clients not to log in through the admin panel when
visiting public WiFi places like Starbucks and Barnes & Noble because
there is a good chance that bad folks are trolling for passwords with
Firesheep.

It has caused me to spend more time working from home where I use a
wired connection than from my local Starbucks because I don't have a
secure way to access Joomla admin panels. I am thinking that Firesheep
is going to sell a lot of SSL certs. I am suggesting SSL to clients if
they need to use wireless to access their sites.

I like having the events twice a year...as it takes a lot of man power to
run these events...we have joomla day this weekend (which hopefully every
one is going to)....then keep your ears open for Joomla camp this spring
(march 2011), if we can get the space of course.

I used OpenVPN and a NetGear home router (WNDR3700), and dyndns.org to setup
secure wireless access to my home workstation so I can do my Joomla work
from the front porch (my summer office) or from Starbucks in the winter.
If anyone is interested I'd be happy to share what and how I did it.
Cheers!

I am glad you mentioned Firesheep.

I have warning clients not to log in through the admin panel when
visiting public WiFi places like Starbucks and Barnes & Noble because
there is a good chance that bad folks are trolling for passwords with
Firesheep.

It has caused me to spend more time working from home where I use a
wired connection than from my local Starbucks because I don't have a
secure way to access Joomla admin panels. I am thinking that Firesheep
is going to sell a lot of SSL certs. I am suggesting SSL to clients if
they need to use wireless to access their sites.

We also need to know where we are going to accommodate more people
before we bother with efforts to expand the existing group.

There's no question we have four, five people that are perfectly
suited to market and evangelize the group, but we don't have anyone
involved that can get us a much larger space.

Does anyone know the proper term to describe an ad banner that  moves the content of the webpage down when it expands and brings it all back up when it collapses?
i-e.- http://www.cbssports.com/

Thanks,
Paul Elliott

 I am pretty sure they call them annoying :)

Thing i think is funny is how people try to sell these codes for them.


but really I think they are just called push down banners

http://www.devcomments.com/Expandable-pushdown-banner-in-jQuery-to51228.htm

Or Expanding banners

Hi,
Do any of you consider yourselves expert, or at least proficient, with
Regular Expressions?
I have a client that hosts his site on a FutureQuest server and I've run
into problems with redirect statements that work with other hosting
services. My current level of knowledge with regex isn't sufficient for me
to figure out what I'm doing wrong. I'm migrating a TypePad blog of his to
WordPress and the blog will be in a sub directory of web root.
I'm interested in lining somebody up in case I run into problems with the
redirects.
If anyone is interested please contact me with your hourly rates.
Thanks!
Herb

Message-ID: <AANLkTikFQVh=VcPaD6YtAN5sxYt9fczEx==pU2MQS4ej@mail.gmail.com>

Does any one have experience with modules not showing? I am working on a
site where yesterday it seems many of the modules are no longer working.
This site is based on a Joomlart template Teline III and features like
Acajoom, J cal, Google Translate, Tab panels, Whos online, Front page slide
show, and news are not displaying with likely a few others.

Also has any one used Rochen Vault for a back up. I could use help with the
process. Monday  the site  is being reviewed by staff
http://www.uncsd2012.org/ any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance -

You're best off doing some scanning on your own, if only to be
slightly edumucated on such practices. There are great free tools out
there too:

nmap - http://nmap.org/
nessus - http://www.nessus.org/nessus/intro.php

I've had access to five- and six-figure security assessment platforms
and toolkits and can say emphatically that these two, combined with a
bit of reading on your part, are just as effective.

Mitch is right, 

If you are interested in security you can help yourself 1000 fold if you just read a little bit about security and the web with joomla specifically your worst nightmare is bad file permissions, if your setting anything to chmod 777, You are setting yourself for trouble. 

Second you need to update joomla as soon as a new patch comes out the same goes for your components as well. 

You should also check this out 

http://sectools.org/web-scanners.html

I haven't used most of them but they could help you.

Ahh, that was the link I forgot.

Nikto has a plugin for Nessus, so you can use Nessus to call Nikto...also
their current data on Nikto is both accurate and inaccurate.  Nikto itself
is fairly long in the tooth and dead, but Nikto2 is active and current.  And
the link for Nikto takes you to Nikto2

Actually, unless it is for your own personal use[ie not scanning a client
site], nessus costs about 1200/year.

If you really want open source, OpenVAS is currently active[currently
working on v4 beta].  It was, initially, a fork of Nessus 2.0 back in 2005
when Nessus 3.0 was released under its new closed source model.  As of 2008
Nessus no longer provides an 7 day delayed  feed of security tests and will
not include any GPL tests anymore.

So OpenVAS is probably your best bet.

Thanks Chris. I was refereeing more to the actual server, than Joomla 
itself.

Is Adobe Business Catalyst a threat to Joomla!?

I have a colleague who now prefers it to Joomla for her clients.  Her comments 
when I asked her about it:

"...it does cost more per month, but I appreciate having tech support and 
upgrades being done by Adobe instead of me installing patches. I like that you 
can do real preview  of pages or save drafts of pages for internal review before 
publishing  it. And I really like their web apps feature which allows you to 
easily  build your own components. So I built a custom portfolio for my site,  
job boards, staff listings, etc. I am also thoroughly impressed with  their 
ecommerce so far. I find it really easy to customize will great  functionality 
in terms or cross selling, attributes, and grouping  products."

How much does BC cost per month? I am also wondering if it is anything
like Yahoo Stores, which I find confusing, difficult to design and
program, and uses code that is not search engine friendly.

The thing that scares me about these software as a service (SOS)
e-commerce programs is you don't have control over the design and
other features, like being able to connect to certain payment
gateways. Also, what happens if the client wants features like forums
and galleries?

I personally would stick to Joomla! with Tienda.

Subject: [joomla] expanding banners (again)
Message-ID: <C0D2B5FD-AE0D-4A1D-ADEA-0DFDE85F7524@upshotmagazine.com>

Ok,
I have to revisit this.
I'm trying to find out if the expanding banners can happen in Joomla.
Yes, I agree the banners that expand over your page content can be annoying (...now that we agree on that...).
I do however, like the ones that actually push the content of the webpage below it down when it expands and resumes positions when it collapses.
Here are some examples:

http://www.cbssports.com/

http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/ (click the ALL SHOWS button)

The closest i have found in Joomla was the old Rocketthemes Solar Sentinel template with its micronews module.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Paul Elliott

Lynda.com has a tutorial on BC and using Dreamweaver.

It seems like it might be a good fit you are building your grandma a website to sell yarn balls, but it costs 50/month for the basic use of a store.

I could see it being OK when you are really looking for something simple that you can set and forget, but it isn't really competing with joomla i don't think.

While Joomla or any website seems easy enough for most, many simply want
someone else to handle it all. In those cases I feel it could be a business
opportunity to offer a monthly charge to maintain client web sites.

Hi all,

I've just added K2 to a new install - and when trying to create a category I
get the following:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function mb_internal_encoding() in

ategory.php on line 49

Anyone know how to deal with this fatal error? I'm trying to stay alive
here.

Thanks

I believe Adobe BC is a real threat to Joomla.  If you read my friend's email, 
you DO have control over the design (she's a graphic artist), the ecommerce has 
all the bells, whistles and functionality you could want, and you can *easily* 
build any component you need.

I think one of the biggest hassles with Joomla is keeping up with all the 3rd 
party component upgrades.

>From this developer's experience, I would say the convenience of a
SAAS CMS is offset by future risk... on doing a brief tour of this
offering it doesn't appear to be particularly easy to export a site
from BC.  BC looks nice, frankly, but what happens if Adobe decides
again to turn off the BC switch or nudge users to yet another service?
 How easy would it be to migrate the legacy site into another CMS?
http://blog.mogulmarketing.com/2010/04/adobe-folds-incontext-editing-into.html

The maintenance effort to patch the core CMS and 3rd party plugins is
a non-trivial consideration, hopefully this will become easier not
more cumbersome moving forward.

Hey joomla users...

I have a question for you on the beautiful snowy day...

Login and registration from Firefox and IE work fine.

But when my client attempts to register from Safari on the new MAC, she
receive a cookies error...

site:
http://174.122.174.162/~suzanne <http://174.122.174.162/%7Esuzanne>

Joomla 1.5.22
community Builder: 1.3

Could this be because we are currently not running off of the proper domain
yet?  And once I point to run off of the proper domain we will be good?

thanks,
Laura

I just tried to register with Safari on my MacBook and got the same error.

But afterwards, I was able to register using Google Chrome on my Mac.
So it is a browser issue.

Who made the component? Maybe you could send support an email or go
with another form?

Can't wait to wake up tomorrow morning and make snow angels!

Are you running redirect with sef?
If so the ~ may be causing issues.

Yes.

In fact, you cannot run Joomla! without a database.
