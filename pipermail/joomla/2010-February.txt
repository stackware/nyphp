Anyone look at Walter Cedric's website?  http://www.waltercedric.com/

The dude has some seriously fascinating dev stuff up there.  He has a
mindmap module for Joomla.

He also did a lot of setup for Joomla component/module development and
integrating it all into a continuous build server environment[using TeamCity
and a lot of other tools].

He even posted to the Joomla developers list offering to help set something
up for the Joomla core...but I get the feeling his offer was ignored.  Kind
of stupid when one considers how many bugs they could avoid using such an
environment.

I believe it.  You remind me of my brother Ken....  Except for one instance,
even when he is "speechless" he has a vast reservoir of BS to spout in it's
place.  :-)

Subject: [joomla] Component hunt: favorites and switch user
Message-ID: <4bffc351002030551g24a7b5b3lbccf6ce67247ea96@mail.gmail.com>

I could swear I saw some decent ones...but I think a lot of stuff has been
removed from the JED making it harder to find.

I'm looking for a "my favorites" component/plugin that would allow one to
interoperate with multiple components AND have multiple favorites lists AND
mark lists as public and private.

I would ALSO like to find a component that lets the admin switch to being
logged in as a different user on the front end for testing purposes.

Lastly,  a decent Sifr component would be nice.  I ended up using JSIFR from
club freakout, http://club.freakedout.de/jsifr3-and-jsifr3-pro.html and it
works quite nicely with SIFR files converted from TrueType:
sifrgenerator.com

But it is a plugin and has limited features do to that.


On the plus side, I've found 2 very nice looking tag components to try out
and will post reviews shortly.

Hi Gary,
I just finished using Ninja Super sIFR for a site and it works great. Has a
lot of customization options and the developer was very accessible for
answering a couple of questions I had.
Cheers!

Subject: [joomla] source control for Joomla
Message-ID: <905478.62634.qm@web53806.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi Everyone,

I have a Joomla site hosted with Godaddy. I'm looking for a good source control solution. I am happy with Godaddy so far (although performance can be a little better at times), but I'm open to switching host providers if there are any that provide easy to install source control software. I would like a free solution, preferably one that doesn't allow others to access the code (i.e. some open source sites won't work), but I am also open to paid plans.

Any suggestions?

Best regards,
Sean

Subject: [joomla] Joomla Slide Extension
Message-ID: <037f01caa51d$cc84a480$658ded80$@com>

Can anyone tell me what extension is being used on the www.azrul.com
homepage in the top part of the page where it says JomComment, MyBlog,
JomSocial and NiceTalk?  I like that the thumbnails at the bottom fits the
width of the graphics, unlike the FrontPage Slide Show extension.  Barry is
using something similar on the homepage of www.joomlashack.com.  I can't
seem to find a Joomla extension that does this.

 

Thanks in advanced for any help you can give.

Hi Dre,
You will need to modify your .htaccess file in the root directory
(public_html) so the apache server mod_rewrite will point to the
subdirectory.
Check out this article with some info on how to do it;
http://www.drichproductions.com/random-knowledge/rewrite-root-directory-subd
irectory.php

Here is a copy of my .htaccess redirect from a bluehost server;

Hope it works for you :)
Herb T

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Use PHP5 as default
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php
# Bluehost.com
# .htaccess main domain to subfolder redirect
# Copy and paste the following code into the .htaccess file
# in the public_html folder of your hosting account
# make the changes to the file according to the instructions.


# Do not change this line.

RewriteEngine on


# Change yourdomain.com to be your main domain.

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?covenanttek.com$


# Change 'subfolder' to be the folder you will use for your main domain.

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/covenanttek/

# Don't change this line.

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# Change 'subfolder' to be the folder you will use for your main domain.

RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /covenanttek/$1

# Change yourdomain.com to be your main domain again.
# Change 'subfolder' to be the folder you will use for your main domain

It's a screenshot, I could  make any CMS look like that.  No branding, no
idea. :-)

However, you can give Wappalyzer a try:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10229

It's a fun little app for firefox, checks for common well known items on a
website and tells you what it knows.  Can detect joomla, drupal, wordpress,
jquery, mootools, and a lot more.

When looking at a web site through the web browser, do a view source
and see if there are generator tags or the like that give a clue to
what CMS it might be. I know with Joomla, if looking at a Joomla web
site this information is available. Unless it was removed for security
purposes.

When I've been curious about a web page, I've e-mailed the webmaster
to ask and often get a helpful response.

If you have not already done so, do a whois on the domain and see if
there is any contact information there.

I know who owns the site. That is not the issue.
I knew I had seen it before, had to recall it.
It is an older version of phpcms.

OMG, this is why you should only use open-source: I bought a (non-GPL) component that was on sale for $160 and the code is full of typos.

css "height" is spelled "hieght" and db inserts are not escaped.

Another reason why I find myself in the usual position of just rolling
up my sleeves... I know most folks don't code but this is a huge
incentive to learn ;-)

On a slightly related tangent, I'm thinking about a way for 3PDs to
package their custom code so it's easy to share.

That's exactly what I'm going to do, make my own version of it, but with features that people actually use and want.

It's such a big undertaking, but this is a component I like enough to keep motivated about.

Subject: [joomla] Hunting for a fix
Message-ID: <4bffc351002100501g42cb7465u4faeea7760df533e@mail.gmail.com>

Ok, this should be easy, but I just can't concentrate long enough on the
site to figure it out:

http://www.huntingforacure.info/

The menu here, using RocketTheme Hive template, is just offcenter, too
short, and ugly.

Any ideas how I can fix it quickly?  Preferably changing background to brown
to match the theme and text to some bright yellow?

I've got the guestbook setup[K2 with a completely neutered security
check.... ok, not completely neutered, it just sets the userid to a specific
"guest" account if no one is logged in....but only for K2, not logged on to
the site!  And the redirect when posting now goes to view the item posted
instead of editing it, since guests can't edit!

Next step is to completely maul the K2 comments section so it only works in
one category and turn it into a silent auction bidding system.

How can I make my K2 articles have a transparent bg? I've tried editing the style.css:
line 23: #k2Container {padding:0 0 24px 0; background-color: transparent;}

But it has done nothing. 
This is getting in the way as my site color and the K2 bg make the site look like a disaster. 

Thanks for any direction!

You also have to edit the dss files for the Khemri administration template.
 Or you can do what I did and delete those 3 style sheets from the code
because they were pissing me off.

What is a dreberry bold?

Hi Dre,
Do you use Firebug or Web Developer for Firefox?
Check to see if there is something in the cascade that is overwriting your
style.
Also, check the <body> style. If your container is positioned you may have a
higher z-index and your looking through your transparent container and
seeing the <body>.
Hope this helps :)

I am using ArtForms on a site and I want the form to be over 2 pages. In
other words, I want the visitor to fill in some info, click on 'next step'
button, fill out more info, upload an attachment and then all of that info
is submitted into the database (and emailed) as if it were one form.

Any suggestions? Is ther another form component that does this?

I had a similiar problem, and found it more difficult then it needed to be, what you can do is some fancy html to make the form really wide, using javascript for your next button to scroll your div over into place and the last side has the submit button.

We got a rinse and repeat coming next week two, I hear.

I'm hip, we definitely need to start getting presenters lined up in
advance. On the one hand I like the adhoc approach but it does get
harder to plan when you aren't sure who's showing up and whatnot.

Well, I have a bunch of presentations I can put together so there is always
something in the pipe for last minute cancellations.  I think there are a
number of people who could do that.

I always liked to have 4 30 to 45 minute presentations scheduled for the
next 2 months, with the option of pulling one from next month to this month
as needed.

Subject: [joomla] Oddball joomla extensions
Message-ID: <4bffc351002120850t17fe06bcjbdedd72afba3ff9b@mail.gmail.com>

Before I reinvent the wheel here, I was wondering if anyone had suggestions
for some nice plugins in the following vein:

1) Googla Analytic event/goal tracking:  I've done this manually three or
four times now and it get's old.  I want a plugin & component system so I
can define events and goals in one component, and then when calling the
system plugin it checks the page and adds the regularly google analytic
tracking as well as the event/goal tracking to the end.  It is simplisity
itself to add it, the main thing is a friendly gui to add it.

Moreover, it should utilize the javascript console.log function to spit that
information out for Firebug to pick up on[speaking of which, anyone know if
a decent version of Firebug is coming for Chrome?].  I Despise having to
wait a day to see what logging information should be going to google, so
this is helpful.

2) Debug to console: instead of sending debugging crap to the screen, I want
to send it to the console.  That way I can leave debugging enabled while
testing, move from network to network, and it doesn't affect the view of the
website.

3) Advanced email functionality.  Choosing email libraries.  Setting a
message queue, etc.

4) Webthumbs image repository: a simple system plugin to check for external
url's on a page AFTER the page is rendered[no reason to slow down the user]
and submit  webthumbs capture based on some rules...  I'll use a callback to
pick the webthumbs up later and update the database[then leading to item 2,
a before render plugin to check for links in the database and swap them out
with webthumbs].

Simple, small, effective libraries.

Message-ID: <4bffc351002131252m632d39ffm4f7293a56a60b79b@mail.gmail.com>

Pandastream seemed to be a really cool video encoding server.  It runs by
default on the EC2 cloud, uses a lot of cool features, is written in Ruby,
and will convert video automatically for iphone, android, and web[note:it
creates flash for the web and something called h264 video which most mobile
phones will play].

But....but...its ruby... do I really want to learn Ruby?  NO!

Kaltura does all that AND is PHP based AND has modules to plugin to Joomla
already.

Kaltura is expensive.  I'm sure it's worth every penny but you need deep pockets.

Video Platforms to integrate. I like Kalatura. If want you set up your own
Kaltura platform you have to set up a "Drupal based implementation" which we
all might not like but you can put it on your own inexpense steaming host
and so does not have to be that expensive has the Joomla module integration
that works.

This begs the question - if you gotta go through all this effort to
host streaming video, why not take the step to a proper CDN (or at
least Amazon S3) in the first place?

Hi all!

I've been trying out XAMPP in my Mac and it works like a charm! Easy
installation, easy GUI (could be improved).

Once started, it doesn't matter wether I close or not my browser, it's still
there.

Database and Joomla installations are a breeze. And I've done those more
than once just to make sure.

I even realized how EASY it is to work on a Joomla site locally then
uploading it to a remote server!! ;-D

I'm a more hands-on kinda guy, but I can't get enough of macports. I
get everything, even the "hard stuff" that most folks never bother
trying on a Mac. I'd also like to point out to my good friend Gary
Mort that macports has...MongoDB. :-)

Yes - unfortunately. If you check the support forum, its had the full-on

I've never had any of my Macs die on me, but I'm not waiting for this to
happen.

That's when all those back up sessions come in handy! ;-)

And I've just found a component called JoomlaPack which is quite easy to
handle out of the box and backup a Joomla site.

So, why worry?

Message-ID: <4bffc351002150959p78a07f7dma6fa50bd7fc9e258@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks, I'm giving redmine a try..... I figured I'd leave it open for
others to try out as well.  So if you want to sign up for an account on my
redmine install and play with it, feel free

http://plan.catskillcrafting.com/

Note: it's running on a subdomain of my still not up yet personal
website.....

Note2: I'm running it on it on Media Temple just because their easy and low
thought:

http://www.mediatemple.net/go/order/?refdom=catskillcrafting.com

*
*I use their GS account with the Ruby container add on. I installed it using
the 64MB free container.....but had it crash a few times as it ran out of
memory, so I upgraded to the 128MB 20/month container.*

That's why I always setup svn on a remote, BACKED UP server. Has
nothing to do with operating system though :-)

For the Mac, I setup MobileMe for a previous job, and liked it enough
to keep it. You got TimeMachine on a local backup drive, iDisk for
important stuff (stored on the internet) and source code repositories
via svn/git on external servers. Now that's cooking!

You can also run your own Redmine/RoR server at Heroku for free:

* http://heroku.com/

And if that is too much work for you, you got two companies that host
your redmine for you, with additional goodies too:

* https://pmphq.com/
* http://plan.io/en/

Not affiliated with any of the above, just happy to see people FINALLY
attempting to actually manage projects and code :-)

Maybe you don't need to worry but I have dozens of sites to manage. Your computer is not indestructible and it can also get stolen. 

Where do you put these backups?  On your computer or on a backup drive?  Every backup drive I've had has failed within months, so I don't count on them  either.  

I cannot afford to lose an entire day's work so I keep my remote webserver and local synchronized while I'm working.

This is actually solid development practice, something I've been doing
for years, and it's the way we managed development of Joomla (and
Mambo before it). If Git is too modern for you and you just gotta
stick with subversion, you can try one of these:

* http://beanstalkapp.com/
* http://unfuddle.com/

If you develop websites for a living and don't use some sort of source
code revision control, you're making a HUGE mistake.

I setup subversion to run on a server - usually at ServerBeach - and
also provision that server with automated backups. I then checkout my
project on the local machine (laptop) where I do development. Whenever
I finish something, I simply commit, and that sends the new code up to
the subversion repository on the server, which in turn gets backed up.
I have a local external drive that I use for TimeMachine, more than
anything as a precaution in case my laptop gets too much coffee or
falls down the stairs late at night.

In the end, the likelihood of the following all happening at the exact
same time is very close to absolute zero:

* external drive fail
* laptop fail
* server fail
* datacenter backup systems fail

And after some thought, if all these things failed at the same time
then I probably got bigger problems than some stupid website.

For all the mac-users out there, would you be interested in me giving
a session on setting up a MacBookPro for web development? It would
cover using macports, and setting up PHP, apache, MySQL and svn/git.
Also would include how to manage your development workflow with remote
servers and whatnot.

I could probably host it at an Apple Store.

If there's any interest I'll take a look into it.

Maybe you don't need to worry but I have dozens of sites to manage. Your
computer is not indestructible and it can also get stolen. 

Where do you put these backups?  On your computer or on a backup drive?
Every backup drive I've had has failed within months, so I don't count on
them  either.  

I cannot afford to lose an entire day's work so I keep my remote webserver
and local synchronized while I'm working.

And I've just found a component called JoomlaPack which is quite easy to

So, why worry?

Yeah, working locally is great, until something happens to your computer

This is actually solid development practice, something I've been doing
for years, and it's the way we managed development of Joomla (and
Mambo before it). If Git is too modern for you and you just gotta
stick with subversion, you can try one of these:

* http://beanstalkapp.com/
* http://unfuddle.com/

If you develop websites for a living and don't use some sort of source
code revision control, you're making a HUGE mistake.

I setup subversion to run on a server - usually at ServerBeach - and
also provision that server with automated backups. I then checkout my
project on the local machine (laptop) where I do development. Whenever
I finish something, I simply commit, and that sends the new code up to
the subversion repository on the server, which in turn gets backed up.
I have a local external drive that I use for TimeMachine, more than
anything as a precaution in case my laptop gets too much coffee or
falls down the stairs late at night.

In the end, the likelihood of the following all happening at the exact
same time is very close to absolute zero:

* external drive fail
* laptop fail
* server fail
* datacenter backup systems fail

And after some thought, if all these things failed at the same time
then I probably got bigger problems than some stupid website.

For all the mac-users out there, would you be interested in me giving
a session on setting up a MacBookPro for web development? It would
cover using macports, and setting up PHP, apache, MySQL and svn/git.
Also would include how to manage your development workflow with remote
servers and whatnot.

I could probably host it at an Apple Store.

If there's any interest I'll take a look into it.

Yes. You can count me in.

For the past few years, I have been using Coda (a basic CSS/HTML/PHP
editor), MAMP (portable LAMP set up), and Filezilla for FTP on my
MacBook Pro.

What are you using Mitch?

To all,
As a suggested future JUG topic, source code revision control would be
something I would be very interested in learning best practices and best in
class technologies.
I have my own on and off-site backups but I don't currently have a
formalized src version control. Any pointers or directions as to where to go
for more info would be appreciated as I want to get this setup for my
workflow.
Thanks,

Hi folks, I'm giving redmine a try..... I figured I'd leave it open for
others to try out as well.  So if you want to sign up for an account on my
redmine install and play with it, feel free

http://plan.catskillcrafting.com/

Note: it's running on a subdomain of my still not up yet personal
website.....

Note2: I'm running it on it on Media Temple just because their easy and low
thought:

*I use their GS account with the Ruby container add on. I installed it using
the 64MB free container.....but had it crash a few times as it ran out of
memory, so I upgraded to the 128MB 20/month container.*

That's why I always setup svn on a remote, BACKED UP server. Has
nothing to do with operating system though :-)

For the Mac, I setup MobileMe for a previous job, and liked it enough
to keep it. You got TimeMachine on a local backup drive, iDisk for
important stuff (stored on the internet) and source code repositories
via svn/git on external servers. Now that's cooking!

You can also run your own Redmine/RoR server at Heroku for free:

* http://heroku.com/

And if that is too much work for you, you got two companies that host
your redmine for you, with additional goodies too:

* https://pmphq.com/
* http://plan.io/en/

Not affiliated with any of the above, just happy to see people FINALLY
attempting to actually manage projects and code :-)

This is actually solid development practice, something I've been doing
for years, and it's the way we managed development of Joomla (and
Mambo before it). If Git is too modern for you and you just gotta
stick with subversion, you can try one of these:

* http://beanstalkapp.com/
* http://unfuddle.com/

If you develop websites for a living and don't use some sort of source
code revision control, you're making a HUGE mistake.

I setup subversion to run on a server - usually at ServerBeach - and
also provision that server with automated backups. I then checkout my
project on the local machine (laptop) where I do development. Whenever
I finish something, I simply commit, and that sends the new code up to
the subversion repository on the server, which in turn gets backed up.
I have a local external drive that I use for TimeMachine, more than
anything as a precaution in case my laptop gets too much coffee or
falls down the stairs late at night.

In the end, the likelihood of the following all happening at the exact
same time is very close to absolute zero:

* external drive fail
* laptop fail
* server fail
* datacenter backup systems fail

And after some thought, if all these things failed at the same time
then I probably got bigger problems than some stupid website.

For all the mac-users out there, would you be interested in me giving
a session on setting up a MacBookPro for web development? It would
cover using macports, and setting up PHP, apache, MySQL and svn/git.
Also would include how to manage your development workflow with remote
servers and whatnot.

I could probably host it at an Apple Store.

If there's any interest I'll take a look into it.

Heroku looks quit a bit better in terms of quality, setup and support.

I had to really bend Media Temple in a few places to get this up.    I think
after doing that...I might go to Heroku's personal account instead and save
some time/effort... of course, then I have to figure out how to export what
little I have first. :-)

Sounds like the digital version of turducken to me!

Doesn't Mac have apache/php/mysql? If not, why not just run a LAMP
server?

I run MAMP Pro......  why MAMP instead of just running my own?

Because it makes it very very easy to add new virtual hosts...sure I CAN
edit the config files, but for 50 bucks I save myself a few hours of
remembering each time.

I also do it a bit...'weirdly'?

For mydomain.com I have the following subdomains now setup:

*.site.mydomain.com
*.test.mydomain.com
*.dev.mydomain.com

These are wildcard entrees up on my DNS provider[DNS Made Easy] - they match
ANY domains under those subdomains.

both site and test point to my hosting provider's ip address.

all devs point to 127.0.0.1

So, now when I want to do development, I add a virtual host to my local
system, somewebsite.dev.mydomain.com
On my own webserver, I also add somewebsite.test.mydomain.com AND
somewebsite.site.mydomain.com

So now, any changes on my local system can be tested and played with
there[and I can even setup a local hosts file for offline testing].

Then I push changes up to dev when I'm ready to test there, and site for the
client to be able to look at.

Everything is under MY control.

Ready to deploy?  Just joomlapack site and then restore.


As for version control...shamed to admit I just haven't used it.  Finally
getting that in sync and am moving towards Bazaar.  It seems to have all the
benefits of git without the weird structure enforced on you based on
assuming you are developing an operating system.

Interesting choice - did you look at Mercurial?

Yes, Mercurial was high on my list.  Bazaar just feels right.  I'm still
flipflopping though, there are more people using Mercurial than Bazaar and
Pragmatic Pub has a book in Mercurial...so I might end up going with it
instead.

I just have to stop stressing and decide.

Dead as a link to CB Simulator on Compuserve
No power no light no nothing power supply is OK

What to do now  ? swap hard drive  to know good machine ..
Drat dreaded 000000000007x error. cause the drivers etc are not even close


http://www.knopper.net/knoppix-mirrors/index-en.html  get a knoppix live boot CD

You could boot from flash also ..

attach flash drive

Boot live CD select 12
Nice gui interface ( a tad clunky at times ) turn off screensaver.
start
system tools
PCMan File Manager  will give you a file manager which you can move
the files to the flash drive.
Or you can map to a network share etc..


Maybe it a good time to make a txt file with the arcane paths to your
stuff and put it in the C drive makes it easier to find when under
fire  LOL

This is for windows I am sure a Mac is very close to the same except
for different file paths.

Oh if the drive is dead as in physically this will not work , but its
worth a try..

Hi All,
Mitch managed to put a bee in my bonnet about version control of my project
files and I've spent the last 10 hours reviewing different options and have
done some tests with Mercurial and TortoiseHg.
What I've run into is an issue with versioning binary files. 
I would like to know how people are handling this. Hg, Subversion and CVS
seem to provide some work arounds but they all look a little ugly and if
there is a better way I would love to hear about it.
Thanks,
Herb

Sounds like the digital version of turducken to me!

Doesn't Mac have apache/php/mysql? If not, why not just run a LAMP
server?

I run MAMP Pro......  why MAMP instead of just running my own?

Because it makes it very very easy to add new virtual hosts...sure I CAN
edit the config files, but for 50 bucks I save myself a few hours of
remembering each time.

I also do it a bit...'weirdly'?

For mydomain.com I have the following subdomains now setup:

*.site.mydomain.com
*.test.mydomain.com
*.dev.mydomain.com

These are wildcard entrees up on my DNS provider[DNS Made Easy] - they match
ANY domains under those subdomains.

both site and test point to my hosting provider's ip address.

all devs point to 127.0.0.1

So, now when I want to do development, I add a virtual host to my local
system, somewebsite.dev.mydomain.com
On my own webserver, I also add somewebsite.test.mydomain.com AND
somewebsite.site.mydomain.com

So now, any changes on my local system can be tested and played with
there[and I can even setup a local hosts file for offline testing].

Then I push changes up to dev when I'm ready to test there, and site for the
client to be able to look at.

Everything is under MY control.

Ready to deploy?  Just joomlapack site and then restore.


As for version control...shamed to admit I just haven't used it.  Finally
getting that in sync and am moving towards Bazaar.  It seems to have all the
benefits of git without the weird structure enforced on you based on
assuming you are developing an operating system.

Interesting choice - did you look at Mercurial?

Yes, Mercurial was high on my list.  Bazaar just feels right.  I'm still
flipflopping though, there are more people using Mercurial than Bazaar and
Pragmatic Pub has a book in Mercurial...so I might end up going with it
instead.

I just have to stop stressing and decide.

Should we have a presentation on versioning?  I don't think that would be off-topic since one of my Joomla books has their first chapter about SVN and JoomlaCode.org -- setting up a JoomlaCode.org project.

Seems like he treats them as any other file, doesn't do any workaround and
Git, Mercural, and Bazaar all do pretty well.

I've seen on dell laptops, battery connected to motherboard, under the
keyboard. That goes bad and laptop won't start. sometimes remove them
and laptop will work again, but not keep state information. Othertimes
need to replace that battery (not really a cmos battery)

All workable, but just as easy to remove the drive from the laptop,
attach a ide / usb adapter, and copy off the data that way.

I use subversion with binary files (Word, .zip, images, etc) all the time
and it just works... no workarounds required.  Can't the same for CVS
though...

Thanks for the feedback on binary files guys. As I did more research I found
that SVN, Hg and Baz don't have problems versioning binaries, the problem is
the diff and merge of those file types. 
Today I started using TortoiseSVN and SVN has a nice system that alters the
file names of the binary files that conflict during a merge allowing the
user to eyeball them and decide which to commit.
Another question as far as best practices.
How much of the Joomla directory should I version? I wouldn't mind
versioning the entire directory but in practice I know that out of those
5-6000 files there will only be a handful that actually would be modified
and creating a working copy approximately doubles the size of the directory.
I'm only beginning to think through all this and it would be great to hear
what other people are doing.
Thanks!

One of the things I like about Bazaar and plan on experimenting with is the
multi parent relationship.

IE, I can take the stock Joomla setup files out of SVN and save them in one
branch/tag/whatever.

Then for a specific install, saying I want to keep it simple, I can setup a
second branch/whatever and /exclude/ all the joomla core files from that
repository.

Finally, I can take the website itself and make a THIRD repository of it's
files and tell it that it is a child of BOTH of the other repositories.

So, files that get changed on my server and checked in that overwrite the
parents will be checked in to the website repository and stored there.

Furthermore, I can periodically refresh my Joomla core repository from the
core code to pick up any changes, and then use Bazaar to merge them back
down to the website[or, for that matter, to 6 websites if I have 6 children
of that parent].

So joomla core function is stored seperately from everything else.


Now, if I want to get REALLY complicated, I could create a repository for
every component, module, and plugin that gets installed and make the website
a child of all of them.  So if I use one component on 3 sites, when I
upgrade that components repository I can then push them down to all the
websites using it.

Bazaar is also able to import from other repositories systems, so I can just
point the parent repositories to the SVN/GIT/CVS repository for the
component/core code and have it periodically refresh the code.


In the end, I think Mercurial, Bazaar, and Git make fine systems and any one
of them is great.  Bazaar is just more.....erm... fit for the way I think so
I'm going with it[despite the lack of books regarding it]

Thanks for your feedback Gary.
I'm going to play around with Bazaar today. I was looking it over again last
night and I've been having problems with SVN in checking out files with file
corrupted messages. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, kept my anti-virus
inactive during the process, run as administrator, etc. and still getting
odd behavior. I'm running Win7 x64 Pro, so I don't know if SVN may have an
incompatibility with my install or what. If I get some time I will set up a
VM with another OS and try it again. I'm thinking before I do that I will
try setting a repo on a server as I've also been running the repo on a
separate drive via file:///.
I've read in a few locations on the web about folks that are running a VCS
on their production web server, where the working copy files are the files
being served and the repo resides in a separate directory on the server.
Pushing/checking in files to the repo automatically initiates a pull/update
to the working copy via a hook.
Are any of you doing something like this?
Cheers!

Hi All,
I came across a decent primer on version control for anyone that looking to
get an intro to the concepts and terminology that will help as you make a
decision about which system to go with.

I took a brief skim through it, and it really is addressing the traditional
CVS and Subversion models.

And there is nothing wrong with those...for what they were and for what they
are.  You KNOW you will always have CVS and Subversion on any server you go
to, so you can create a repository of your code there.

But I truly feel that the distributed model just works better.  Whether you
decide to use Git, Mercurial, or Bazaar - those systems have many additional
features that just make things work.

The biggest problem I'm finding is that everything is an 80% solution, so
you have to decide WHERE you wish to put your empasis on learning..

Your repository can be configured to do all sorts of things when you
checkin, automatically update a bug tracker, run unit tests, run system
tests, run documentation processes and syntax checkers,trigger an automatic
deployment if everything works, etc.

By the same token, most bug tracking systems can ALSO be configured to
monitor the source code repository and perform these functions.

And then you may not like working from the command line, so you can use a
web server front end to the repository that may also have wiki and project
tracking functions[for example, http://www.indefero.net/ is a web front end
for Git, Subversion and Mercurial].

It's gotten to a ridiculous point at times[for example, GitHub as a service
provides a project tracker, wiki, forums, lists, and version control...and
often people use one, maybe 2 of those functions but they sign up for the
whole service.  So you go to a github repository for code, and then click on
project tracker and it's empty because that is hosted somewhere else]....

It can get further confusing...for example, do I go with Redmine as my main
item and learn Ruby....or Mercurial and learn Python, or use something like
Indefero because it is in PHP and I can hack it more quickly.

What you go with will have some repercussions, for example Indefero looks
really cool, but then it means I can't use Bazaar it's either Git or
Mercurial.....

At the end of the day... I keep coming back to the most important thing is
to use version control...so I am starting with the system which sings to me
and moving on from there.

Hey Gary:

Great article, thanks for sharing...and, yes...it can be dangerous to look
in the mirror...but if you're willing to fix what you see, it can also be
rewarding.  I definitely picked up a couple things I need to improve from
the article.

Off Topic, but I figured I'd post this in case anyone is interested in some
of the items on the list:

As I believe I posted about previously, their doing a fundraiser to expand
the cancer center at the local hospital my oldest brother passed away at
last year.
http://www.huntingforacure.info/ is the basic website I setup for them
because I just couldn't bear looking at it much[and it looks MUCH better
know thanks to Laura Gordon going in and applying a much better template and
layout!]

Today is the fundraising event[though we are almost at the goal already!]

They have a number of items they will be running a silent auction on:
http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=427194725514&topic=1179<http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=427194725514&topic=11790>
0 <http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=427194725514&topic=11790>


Which includes some items that might appeal to a broader interest:
Sports memorabilia (baseball signed by Mickey Mantle and Willy Meyes
*Guitar signed by Bono
[I am assuming those were pulled out of some personal collections by family]

**Spend a day with a chef! (this includes a $500 food and wine allowance) -
Chef Elizabeth E. Briggs a 23 year Chef / Professor of the Culinary
Institute of America and Chef Owner of Cooking For Transformation LLC. Will
spend the day with you and your 6 guests in your own home kitchen.
 <http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=427194725514&topic=11790>[and a lot
of favors and a lifetime of good karma cashed in]

So if there is something on the list that you would like and your not going,
feel free to email sales at huntingforacure.info and let Danielle know!

The first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging you have one.... me?
 No, not me.  I have no problems.... no sirree... :-)


But seriously, yeah I was reading through that article and going "that's
me...me...me......ouch!"

So it is good to reflect on...and easier when your reading about someone
else.

That's a brilliant write up that exposes the vast chasm of
understanding between the designer/developer and the client. Good
reading for everyone from both sides of the fence.

Well, people will be happy to know I'll shut up about this now.

Between a sizable last minute anonymous donation and the high value items in
the auction, they made the goal of 10,000 since starting this fundraiser
officially back in January.  10,000 in 2 months that I credit mainly to a
lifetime of good deeds and a lot of energy on Danielle's part.

So I am a mostly happy camper tonight.

I'd like some recommendations for an extension for a website that needs its users to apply for registration with information about who they are and what their business is.  Once their registration is approved, they can login and view info that is not available to the general public

Thanks,

Community Builder.  :-)

Though personally Community Builder seems a little long in the tooth to me
and needs a complete rewrite.

Things I would change in Community Builder:
1) Drop support for Mambo and Joomla 1.0 and as such, get rid of a lot of
version checking code
2) Move to using Joomla 1.5 input sanitizers instead of the CB ones.  Where
CB has a better sanitizer, promote it as a patch to the core files instead
of having a seperate setup
3) Drop a lot of the CB events....or if maintaining them for backwords
compatibility, at least adopt a set of plugins to have CB events trigger
Joomla events and vice versa[for example, when the CB before and after
registration events get triggered, they should also trigger the Joomla ones.
 And if the Joomla one gets triggered, it should trigger the CB one.  With
recursion checking of course. :-)
4) A decent CB User api to load the CB user info to the Joomla user profile
so it can be accessed by other programs.  Also a decent api for registration
of new users.
5) Move rules to configurable options instead of buried in php files[the
regex for verifying user names is buried in a mess of if/then version
checking and the rules vary depending on what CMS your using].

In short, CB either needs a complete overhaul...or it needs something else.


Fabrikaar also has some custom user profile form logic/configuration.


Once a user is actually logged in, then it's a simple matter of setting
anything which is for registered users only as for registered users only.
 More fine grained control can be found through things like the CB plugins
which set access to Remository and Docman based on fields in CB.


Hmm... CB is still the best choice out there I can see......  But then I
won't pony up to purchase the other products like JomSocial.


K2 DOES have an interesting take on user registration.  It also maintains
it's own set of tables for user registration and uses the Joomla plugin
system to extend user registration with their own fields, and update that
data on submit.  Also with K2 you have the ability to set "Categories" of
postings which can have files, images, image gallery, extra fields, etc.
 And you can define access to those categories by K2 user group[so "Members"
can read all posts, but can only post to the car for sale listings.  Wheras
realtors can post to the house for sale listing category as well].


Lots of ways to skin this cat.....  and I suffer from PHP
developer-ites[also called Mitch's disease] and don't like any of them. :-)

Subject: [joomla] Extension for website access?

 

I'd like some recommendations for an extension for a website that needs its
users to apply for registration with information about who they are and what
their business is.  Once their registration is approved, they can login and
view info that is not available to the general public

Thanks,
Donna

If K2 has an extended registration system, then I'll use that because I am going to be using K2 on the site anyway.  Haven't used K2 before so I didn't know.

CB seems like overkill for this purpose.

Community Builder.  :-)

Though personally Community Builder seems a little long in the tooth to me and needs a complete rewrite.

Things I would change in Community Builder:
1) Drop support for Mambo and Joomla 1.0 and as such, get rid of a lot of version checking code
2) Move to using Joomla 1.5 input sanitizers instead of the CB ones.  Where CB has a better sanitizer, promote it as a patch to the core files instead of having a seperate setup
3) Drop a lot of the CB events....or if maintaining them for backwords compatibility, at least adopt a set of plugins to have CB events trigger Joomla events and vice versa[for example, when the CB before and after registration events get triggered, they should also trigger the Joomla ones.  And if the Joomla one gets triggered, it should trigger the CB one.  With recursion checking of course. :-)
4) A decent CB User api to load the CB user info to the Joomla user profile so it can be accessed by other programs.  Also a decent api for registration of new users.
5) Move rules to configurable options instead of buried in php files[the regex for verifying user names is buried in a mess of if/then version checking and the rules vary depending on what CMS your using].

In short, CB either needs a complete overhaul...or it needs something else.


Fabrikaar also has some custom user profile form logic/configuration.


Once a user is actually logged in, then it's a simple matter of setting anything which is for registered users only as for registered users only.  More fine grained control can be found through things like the CB plugins which set access to Remository and Docman based on fields in CB.


Hmm... CB is still the best choice out there I can see......  But then I won't pony up to purchase the other products like JomSocial.


K2 DOES have an interesting take on user registration.  It also maintains it's own set of tables for user registration and uses the Joomla plugin system to extend user registration with their own fields, and update that data on submit.  Also with K2 you have the ability to set "Categories" of postings which can have files, images, image gallery, extra fields, etc.  And you can define access to those categories by K2 user group[so "Members" can read all posts, but can only post to the car for sale listings.  Wheras realtors can post to the house for sale listing category as well].


Lots of ways to skin this cat.....  and I suffer from PHP developer-ites[also called Mitch's disease] and don't like any of them. :-)

	or another platform suggestion?
Message-ID: <0605FFD2-62F4-4252-83F1-9C3503542871@gmail.com>

I have a project I'm prosing for a new non-profit and I think Joomla  
may be well suited for it. I'd greatly appreciate any opinions on this  
such as "David, here are five extensions that do most everything you  
asked." Or constructive comments like, "Wouldn't your time be better  
spent not trying to cram this thing down Joomla's throat and instead  
use X?".

[Short pre-ample:]
A non-profit group is forming and building a membership. They have a  
list of people they would like to become members, but they don't have  
contact information for them. So the concept was to set-up a web site  
which would both manage the membership database and make it easy for  
new prospects to join and associates of theirs update their contact  
information and be able to send them an invitation to check out the  
web site, update their own contact information and join the membership.
[/Short pre-ample:]

The primary requirement for getting things started is to have a  
"Looking for..." section. This would list the prospective members by  
name and what information is missing, for example:

	Mickey Mouse 	- Need Phone Number and E-mail address
	Donald Duck		- Need Postal mailing address.

	The visitor needs to be able to select a name displayed, supply the  
information and confirm their update via e-mail confirmation.  Of  
course, there is a concern about security here and to prevent  
malcontents for entering rubbish. I've not thought about how to solve  
that yet, because we would like to be able to do this without  
requiring visitors to register unless it's a simple registration. Or  
maybe an audit feature, where the new updates don't take effect until  
they are reviewed by the Admin. I'm certainly open to suggestions on  
how to handle this best.

The membership is expected to be in the thousands and they will want  
to be able to send e-mail newsletters and alerts to everyone. What are  
people doing for this, so it gets past the mailers so it isn't flagged  
a SPAM? Are you using something like Exact Target  (http://email.exacttarget.com/ 
) or are you able to have the e-mail sent out N number of messages  
every X seconds according to your service providers restrictions?

Although not discussed yet, I imagine as things progress they are  
going to want to be able to do accounting functions for the membership  
such as tracking payments and sending out reminders. Of course, that  
can be another module down the road which would key this existing  
database.

So tell me straight is this good for Joomla? Anything out there so the  
wheel doesn't need to be re-invented? Or is this a job for a good PHP  
frame work?

Thanks in advance to any kind souls that offer helpful suggestions!

 The most popular CRM in the non profit sphere is CIVICRM,
http://civicrm.org/

That said, *I* would use Joomla because it is 10 times faster for me to take
some existing components and add/tweak them.

As for email campaigns, again I would use PHPlist because I know how to go
through and setup all the whitelisting, feedback loops, domain key signing,
SPF/Sender ID domain records, etc to minimize email being marked as spam.
 And PHPlist has throttling built into it.

But I recommend MailChimp since they have an easy to use api and a PHP
library so you can integrate it with Joomla sign up processing fairly
easily.

Mosets Tree is a directory component that has a feature called "Claim this listing", where the owner of the business (or whatever) can click a button saying this is his/her listing and he/she wants to update the info.

Even if you write your own component tailored to your needs, Joomla is a great framework to build on.  There are functions already in place for the admin part of the component for "New", "Save", "Delete", etc., as well as the sortable grid listing.

Subject: [joomla] New guy - Looking for user upload strategy
Message-ID: <002701cab48a$8e292c70$aa7b8550$@com>

Forgive me if this is the wrong place to ask! Just found the NYC group, and
hope to attend soon. 

I build/maintain a couple of church websites, and have been using PHP/MYSQL
for some of the automation. Found Joomla, and looking to see if that will
work for me, as I need to add the ability for church staff to add content,
without my intervention. I took a Joomla course on Lynda.com which got me up
to speed pretty quickly in general.

Things I can't seem to clearly find searching through the doc and
extensions/modules:

1) Would like to be able to lock down the secretary to only be able to
upload to a specific category (weekly newsletters in PDF format). Then add a
module that only displays articles in that category. Seems like
upload/managing attachments is not as straight forward as it should be? Are
there some recommended ways of letting end users manages file attachments?
2) Add a calendar, which display the next 'x" upcoming events on the right
side, and links to a full calendar of scheduled events. Seems like there are
a ton of add on calendars, which might you recommend? Or are most people
using Google now, and just linking that in?
3) Are there plans to allow more granular security? Like user groups that
can do/see certain things?
4) Just how risky are some of these add-ons? It looks like there is quite
the market for these, and one hopes they are stable!

Thanks much.

Paul.

1) Use Docman for pdf uploads and display.  You can restrict uploads by individual or by group.

2) Try JEvents for the calendar.  The calendar is a component and the module will display upcoming events which can be configured as you wish.

3) Granular access levels are coming in Joomla 1.6, project to be released this year.  In the meantime there are extension for this.

4) This depends on the developer.  Docman and JEvents have been around for quite a while.

If you haven't found it already, the Joomla extensions directory is located at http://extensions.joomla.org

So let's say you use usermeta to assign users to a group (I suppose you
could just wait for 1.6, but let's assume you want to do this before the end
of the Mayan calendar?) You can also use usermeta to give users a couple new
fields, say a profile picture for example which they don't have OOB.

What's the best way to generate a page that lists all the users in a given
group as well as selected specific fields for these users?

Message-ID: <670973.48249.qm@web31804.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Just a thought to the entire joomla list group...

It would be great to schedule at a future meeting another presentation of a joomla system from an end user/client.  If anyone has a client that would be interested in showing off their system, perhaps we could schedule it for a future meeting.

I think from a developer perspective it is great to see what a client thinks about their system, how it was built, and the nooks and crannies about it...

fyi: registration is now up for the march meeting (3/11), so sign up!

I'd just make a simple front-end component for that. Although that
sounds like the beginnings of a rich profile and user group extension
suite...

Re:Gary Mort on Baazar distributed version control

Gary thanks for the suggestion of this system on the list. I have been
trying out the Baazar version control system and think it is very cool. It
is amazing how it is virtually ubiquitous on your local machine and then you
can sftp, webdav, ssh to remote installations. I am really thinking of
adopting this as our main version control system.

Best,
Fred Sullivan

Hey Fred, any reviews on how your doing your setup and such, what apps you
use to help manage things[or which command line commands you use most], etc
would be great.

I'd love to see more info from people using Bazaar....of all the ones out
there it is the least documented, which is a bummer since it is the one that
sings to me most.

Post em here, or the nyphp talk list, or even just up online and ping me!

[on facebook you can find me at....oddly enough, garyamort] :-)

Hi, all.  I'm using K2 for the first time.  I don't see where the user registration fields can be modified or controlled. Are you supposed to do it in the code or through the admin?

They can't.  :-(

If you can't get by with what they give you... I REALLY recommend switching
to a different user registration package.

If you MUST use K2, you will need to make changes in the following areas:
1) System plugins: K2 uses system plugins to detect when a new user is
registering and modify the registration form to add their fields
2) User plugins: K2 uses the user registration event to then grab it's own
fields[see system plugin above] and add that data to it's database
3) K2 user controller, model, and views: K2 information which is displayed
to the user, searches, etc are all done in this code.

The upside of K2 is it has a very nice ACL system for itself which is all
leveraged off it's user system

The downside of K2 is that even if you neutar the user stuff and use
something else, you still need part of it to handle the user groups for the
acl.

I can get by with just renaming the existing fields.  That *should* be simpler.

To clarify, I meant relabeling the existing fields, so user sees "co. name and address" instead of "description", etc.

Message-ID: <c2f754301002281230m102e5674j8a97d2355d13be77@mail.gmail.com>

Hey, What are people using for a carousel where the images are linkable?
Most of the carousels on JED seem to be galleries where the images can't be
used as hyperlinks.  CEO has one that you can give an xml list of
hyperlinks, but it only displays a single image at a time (and not, for
example, 4 in a horizontal row...)

Anyway, just wondering if anyone had come a cross a decent carousel that
allows you to display several thumbnails in a horiz. row, hyperlinking each
one to a target URL...?

cheers,

Are you sure they're not linkable?  The ones I've used are all linkable.

I usually use YooTools Carousel.  There's also YooSlider.  Both of these take whatever HTML is in a content article from a specified category and display it as an item in the carousel/slider.

If you don't want YooTools, there's also Frontpage Slideshow: http://www.joomlaworks.gr/

Silly me, I didn't specify JED only, GPL + non-commercial.

So no, I haven't found any non-commercial extensions in JED that incorporate
this relatively simple JQuery.  :-o

Hmm,
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/ads-a-affiliates/banner-management/4378
 perhaps?

I dunno..  I'm slowly giving up on the JED.

I myself prefer to use a mix of licenses..... in fact the license I use MOST
often is Public Domain and I really resent having to put a GPL wrapper
around code I have offered to the public domain just to satisfy some license
fanatic's idea of what is correct.

My second preference is a Creative Commons variant.
Creative Commons, Attribution being the first one on my list for
preferences.  Technically GPL is /supposed/ to be attributed, but quite
often they drop it or bury it[see the Joomla project itself that demands all
attributions be stripped from the code and just a reference placed in the
contributors file for everything].  As an example of this, technically you
could not submit /anything/ for inclusion with Joomla core code using Jquery
since they as that
"You don?t have to do anything special to choose one license or the other
and you don?t have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are
free to use a jQuery project in commercial projects as long as the copyright
header is left intact."
http://jquery.org/license

Since the Joomla team specifically instructs people to strip that header -
which to me is a form of theft and I have found actively encouraged by the
GPL community at large.

Sometimes I go with Creative Commons, Attribution, No Derivatives - the
point of this code being when I have something that is a little 'wonky' and
I don't want someone taking my code, bundling it into something else, and
then get angry emails from someone downstream when something breaks[note: I
don't consider it 'distribution' for someone to download and install my code
on someone else's website..... that's doing work as contracted....
distribution is when you add it to your zipfile and then let people download
it].

Now, naturally this does mean that to do this, I have to be scrupulous clean
about writing every line myself and not copying from some example file where
there is a GPL license floating around[after all, that is the point of COPY
right...to prevent or restrict copying].

Oh well...hope my initial sentence helps you out. :-)

Does anyone else find it......incomprehensible how the Joomla Core team
interprets this?

When you receive a full copy of Joomla, within that file are image files for
the Joomla logo as well as many multiple references to Joomla!.

The GPL license insists that it applies to every item in that zipfile.  Not
just code.

Therefore technically, Open Source Matters is blatantly violating the GPL by
including trademarked images and names in a zipfile with GPL items.

Every now and then when I feel snarky, I feel like doing something with the
Joomla Logo and challenging them to finally come clean and settle the issue
in a court of law....instead of using their "we're GPL but we're not GPL"
contortions.

You can get the carousel code from dynamicdrive.com and stick it in a module.  I used their script in my pre-Joomla days.

So no, I haven't found any non-commercial extensions in JED that incorporate this relatively simple JQuery.  :-o

I'll weigh in on this one as I'm not exactly famous for not having an
opinion. (cough)

Trademark and copyright simply means OSM owns the name and logo. GPL
however is a software license, which simply means you can do whatever
you want with said software, as long as you comply with the GPL.

Where is there a conflict between trademark and license regarding
Joomla? Pretty sure naming the software joomla and shipping it with a
GPL license doesn't mean you can apply the GPL to the copyright or
trademark.

"?Copyright? also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks." - nope, quite specific that it does not
apply to only the software, but to everything included in the package.

"To ?modify? a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
copy. The resulting work is called a ?modified version? of the earlier work
or a work ?based on? the earlier work."

Such as changing the logo included in the software in some manner. :-)

Though :
"e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or"

Does leave a lot of wiggle room....   Of course, the same wiggle room has
been used to include trademarked items which are then used by the program to
check for before being able to run.


Basically, what you have is a legal grey area.  It's so trivial no one
actually wants to go through the motions of having it decided by law....  So
the "rules of the road" are basically whatever the GNU.org asserts they
are...or whatever others get away with.


And again, GPL does insist that you can require your copyright notice on
your software...but the Joomla Team routinely removes those.  Hopefully with
permission.

Ok THAT is a good question - I wonder what other FOSS CMS platforms do
regarding copyright notice consolidation.
