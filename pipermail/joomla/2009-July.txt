Subject: [joomla] Happy Fourth
Message-ID: <4A4FD4AF.5070707@wolpow.com>

Since it is a quiet day I thought I would play with 1.6.

Downloaded files fine, uploaded and went to the web install and got a 
blank page. It did go to the installation directory.
Solved it by renaming the configuration.php-dist to configuration.php

Then once done I copied the new configuration.php to root. There was no 
file there with the installs.

I like what I see in the user management area.
Will play with it and let all know when we meet next week.
Have a happy 4th

Hope everyone enjoyed the holiday!

The discounted rate for JoomlaDay only has 15 tickets left!  The discounted rate is only $69 per person!  That includes bagels, lunch and a full day of workshops!  www.JoomlaDayNYC.com

Once the 15 tickets are gone then the rate will go to $89 per ticket...which is still a great deal.

There are still sponsorship spots available, Silver, Gold, Platinum & Plumb...affordable options for your company to reach out to Joomla programmers...

To: Joomla! CMS Development <joomla-dev-cms at googlegroups.com>



A short time ago, Andrew put together a free extension called the
Advanced Administrator Menu. Check it out here...

http://www.theartofjoomla.com/extensions/advanced-administrator-menu.html

It allows you to create a new top-level menu and add preferred items
to it. This is great for two reasons:

1. When your Components menu becomes too long to handle, this is a way
to move some things to a specific menu.

2. You can set up customized workflows by creating a menu that has a
step-by-step process. Advanced users and site admins can help
beginners with a separate menu for them that guides them through a
particular process.

I'm sure there are may more uses, but these are the obvious ones to
me. I'd like to propose adding this to the core of Joomla 1.6 if
Andrew will allow it and wanted to see what others thought about the
usefulness of this extension. Please post your thoughts and ideas
here.

Ok, asked the almighty Twitter for what topics would be of interest,
and got nothing but crickets.

Now I'm trying the list, hoping for more ;-)

If you were to attend a session called "Joomla for Entrepreneurs",
what topics would you find the most interesting or valuable?

I would like to learn how to generate streams of income through my

like to learn how to set those things up & how to keep track of  
referrals from my site.

Mitch,

I saw your tweet and I have been thinking about it for a couple of days.
Over the last 5 years we have been approached to build websites for
start-ups many times.  Usually, the entrepreneur has an idea for a business
online and those ideas come in a few general forms:

1. They want to build content and generate advertising revenue.
2. They want to build a community and generate advertising revenue.
3. They want to build a custom application and generate subscription revenue
or licensing revenue.

Typically, their ideas are not that well formed and they do not have ANY
experience building/running an online business.  Entrepreneurs by their
nature are idea people or visionaries not managers or technicians, thank you
Michael Gerber.  So, the planning and development process becomes extremely
iterative as they seek out their path and the truth about their business.
They lurch from idea to idea as their vision comes to life.  They don't have
much experience so they don't really anticipate all the nuts and bolts that
need to be built into the site.

The other truth about entrepreneurs, who find us, is they have NO MONEY.  Or
they are unwilling to spend a lot of money to test their idea out.  So
version one of their idea needs to be boot strapped with open source
technology.  Technology in which most of the fundamental requirements are
already implemented.  By boot strapping with open source technology, we can
focus on building out just their idea, not all the foundational stuff like
ACL and content management.

To serve this type of customer, we have found that deploying a CMS or an
application framework, like Joomla! is the most productive and delivers the
fastest results.  Joomla! handles many of the core requirements out of the
box.  We just build components and modules to implement the idea.  Granted
sometimes we have to modify the core to meet specific needs, however
generally we do not.

The question I have for you is, who is the target of your talk?  Is it
Joomla! developers who have to deal with entrepreneurs?  Or is it the
entrepreneurs?  In both cases, I think there is a great talk to be found in
my observations above.  How can Joomla! developers better meet the needs of
entrepreneurs and make more money?  On the flip side, how can entrepreneurs
be more educated about development using an open source platform like
Joomla! and how can that boot strap their business?  Is your talk a business
talk or a technology talk?

Answer some of those questions and I think we have the opportunity at some
great dialog!

Hans

Hmmm...... If only this could be taught.  Maybe I should write a book about
this.  I could make a fortune selling it through my Joomla! web site.  And
in the process I might setup a merchant account, shopping cart, affiliate
tracking system and a web analytics to track and monetize the crush of
traffic referred to my site.

I agree with Hans...Mitch maybe your discussion could be 2-fold:

1. How developers (small ones) can work with our entrepreneur clients who think a website can be built for free...how do we manage that, and what ideas can be used to work from 'both sides'...

2. How to convince our 'small clients', the ones that don't want to spend $100 +  a month maintenance to pay just to upgrade from 1.0 to 1.5...and that the joomla system can not run completely without any costs...if they had a physical store front they would have to pay for rent, plumbing, electrical, etc...but with this virtual front many think it should be free...

3. Maybe from a 'client's' perspective of what is realistic as far as costs to run a simple joomla site, with having a programmer assist you...what are the 'going rates'...

Again, from small clients, as many not for profit small businesses are turning to joomla because it is much less expensive than a custom built system, but it can't be built for nothing...

My reply is very similar to Hans.
Are you talking about how to make money with [selling] Joomla or how to 
make money using Joomla?
The later has far too many other variables. Lets face it, you could have 
the best looking most functional site and you will still not sell many 
giant blackboard slide rulers.

In selling you have hosting, design, customizing and component creation.

Yeah, the people who make money here are the ones selling the teaching.  Like the "4 hour work week" book.  I've had many clients who wanted a website based on this type of selling and they have all failed.  They thought "if you build it they will come".  No one came.  They fused over the tiniest details on their site but had no marketing plan or budget.

People are making money selling books saying your website can run itself while supporting your early retirement.

I would like to write a blog about what *not* to do or expect from your website business.

Question:  How are you going to keep it down to *ten*?!  I have ten real-life stories just off the top of my head.


(btw, I meant "fussed over", not "fused over".)

Some partly coherent thoughts...

For the entrepreneur:
	1. How do I bring together joomla, a shopping cart, a forum, etc, and 
make sure the look and feel stays the same without manually configuring 
each CSS file every time?

	2. What hit statistics are available? How are they graphed?

	3. If I hire a Joomla programmer for one project and 6 months later 
hire a different one, how much time/cost will the second programmer 
spend figuring out what the first one did?

	4. I want to move to "Mitch's Awesome Hosting Company", how hard will 
it be to keep my site intact and how difficult is it to clone?

	5. Most sites seem real slow, how do I use Joomla and still make sure 
my site loads quickly?

	6. What's the top end of Joomla capacity?

For the Joomloid:
	1. How do I deal with YoMomma and other half-baked mega hosting for 
free options that install crippled PHP/Apache/MySQL functionality?

	2. What are some big wins I can discuss with a client to maximize their 
site development ROI?

	3. Auto mechanics have a book that says how many hours to charge for 
each job. Is there a similar thing for Joomla tasks so I can price work 
I don't yet know how to do without making the customer pay for my direct 
education?

	4. What are some awesome sites using Joomla that I can learn from?

	5. How do I show the client the dollar value of decent hosting plans?

That's all my workday worn brain can come up with. Some of the other 
responses have been great! I'm enjoying reading as much as contributing.

FYI as recovering mechanic . The rates are the book rate or whatever
it takes Bill the longest .
If you come to me and want a custom exhaust I am going to charge you
what it take to make that exhaust.  Your car off the showroom floor is
the Joomla std package. Any options will be billed extra and just like
you car I will have to read the instructions and figure out how to
install the roof rack.
Figuring stuff out is part of your job and in any other trade you get
paid for your time so why should working with Joomla  be any different
?
When you come to me and say I want a 3 " exhaust with this carb and
that cam etc I will charge you time and materials as I don't know all
the implications.
After all a doctor gets paid for diagnosis , so should we !!!
Consider yourself architects and you are creating the master blueprints
Even is the house does not get built you should get paid for your time.

There is actually a book on this topic at Amazon but the reviews not good:
http://www.amazon.com/Joomla-Cash-Money-making-weapons-website/dp/1847191401

A good list of things to start when it comes to actually getting visitors:
http://www.seomoz.org/blog/why-does-your-search-traffic-suck-the-6-most-likely-reasons

I haven't read it myself, but a friend liked that "4 hour work week" 
book. The actual title is a sales gimmick but the gist is ... stop 
reading blogs, stop twittering, stop watching TV ... just go out and 
start building websites and learning from the experience.

For Mitch's talk ... should I trust Joomla for ecommerce? It can do most 
other things but is Virtuemart actually a good choice?

Yeah, Virtuemart is good if you want your orders all screwed up.  Wrong calculations, wrong user applied to order, etc.

http://www.amazon.com/Joomla-Cash-Money-making-weapons-website/dp/1847191401

A good list of things to start when it comes to actually getting visitors:
http://www.seomoz.org/blog/why-does-your-search-traffic-suck-the-6-most-likely-reasons

I haven't read it myself, but a friend liked that "4 hour work week" 
book. The actual title is a sales gimmick but the gist is ... stop 
reading blogs, stop twittering, stop watching TV ... just go out and 
start building websites and learning from the experience.

For Mitch's talk ... should I trust Joomla for ecommerce? It can do most 
other things but is Virtuemart actually a good choice?

Promotion! You forgot promotion! Unfortunately, a lot of the general
public thinks that 'If you build it, they will come'. Getting on the
first page of Google is very difficult, unless you are bidding on
Adwords, and that takes a lot of management. It was a lot easier to get
on the first page of AltaVista ;)

Mark,
That is a totally different subject, save for Joomla and SEO practices.

I'd disagree, as many consider SEO part of a marketing exercise.

But knowing how to use SEO within Joomla and the settings. ie SEF page 
component, blanking out items in global or where to put the meta data in 
content.
That is all part of Joomla, but is perhaps 10 minutes max. in a session

Subject: [joomla] tip on module naming
Message-ID: <1247941475.20217.28.camel@jersey>

I made two modules for my website, but they would not display. It took
me a while to figure out the problem. At first I thought the problem was
that they had hypertext links to outside sites, or javascript code in
the modules, but that was not the case.

The problems were the names of the modules. In both cases I included
special characters in the name. for instance, you cannot name a module
Joomla!DayNYC 2009. The exclamation point will keep it from displaying.
Likewise, an ampersand in the module name will keep it from displaying.

I found that renaming the modules did not help. In each case I had to
delete the modules and create new ones with names that did not include
special characters.

Don't know if this is an issue with article naming, but would assume so.

Subject: [joomla] sef issue
Message-ID: <1248058595.20217.40.camel@jersey>

I'm having a bit of an issue setting up a landing page that I don't want
on my menu system. I'm using sef in Joomla 1.5.10 (I know, I'll update
this one a little later on tonight).

Unfortunately, I can't get to the page using short urls unless it is a
page in the menu system. I just get a 404 error. I would have thought
that I could use an url like
somedomain.com/section/category/landingpage, and that would get me to
the page in question.

Anyone have any suggestions on how to handle this? Do I have to make a
menu item and hide it somehow?

Thanks,
Mark

Yes, you can create another menu with the link you want but don't publish the menu module for that menu.

Which leads to a barbaric practice known affectionately within the
Joomlaverse as "the Hidden Menu." Man, I wished there was a more
logical way to take over the sitewide router without hacking the core.

Yea hidden menu works great use it all the time. Just remember you did  it
sometimes I come back to a site and forget about them, I started to actually
calling the menu "hiddenmenu", or "router". You can add as many links to it
as you want,  as you are not ever sending to the front end.

Subject: [joomla] Performance question
Message-ID: <4A648953.7030108@waynorth.com>

Will Joomla perform adequately as a publishing platform for a news site 
that has the potential to reach at least 50,000 views a month. I would 
appreciate having any insight into resolving potential issues?

Here's what I consider the four features that have to be robust:

I realize these point to extensions, but can a system that meets the 
feature requirements handle the load?

* Stories ? Current content, plus archive content quickly accessible
* Calendering ? flexible, attractive, fast
* Search ? responsive, intelligent, relevant
* Ad serving ? full featured, responsive, reliable

I also wonder whether the answer ultimately rests on how well the server 
performs.

thanks,
Mark

The Joomla.org site gets much more than that in day.  There are Joomla sites getting 300,000+ hits a day.

It is also a question of where you host. A cheap shared hosting package 
will not support that traffic.

        I found two extensions that appear to help solve this problem.
        One is
        JRedirect, and the other is ReDJ. I'm now conflicted as to which
        to use!
        
        The hidden menu trick sounds like it would be easiest and
        quickest for a
        small number of landing pages, so I'll try that first and test
        the
        others at a later time.
        
        Thanks so much for the help! Greatly appreciated!

Even a shared host should be able to pump out 50k views in a month.
However if you really worry about scale, a good bet is to get a
dedicated webserver, and a dedicated mysql server. Then trick out your
webserver to have a php cache (like xcache, which is my favorite) and
also a cache (memcache is my favorite for this).

Those things should provide a Joomla site that can scale well beyond
what you are talking about. Keep in mind that Joomla can only go as
fast as the stuff you make it do - and there are plenty of 3rd party
extensions (templates are the biggest source of pain IMHO) that will
severely limit your ability to scale.

Just setup a datacenter with three webservers and three database
servers, expecting to exceed 40 million page views in the first day.

I'm not able to see that in practice unfortunately.

Do a quick scan of that template using Anthony's performance grader:
http://www.joomlaperformance.com/component/option,com_performance/Itemid,52/

Use their demo URL: http://demo.yootheme.com/index.php?show=jul09/

Much slower and heavier than they claim.

Hi
I created a site www.melanomapictures.org, and installed the SH404SEF component for SEO. When I enable the module, a large portion of my site links will not work. I get the following error msg "404 not found." 
ANyone has any idea to fix this problem. 

Also, are there any downloads for creating SEF site map?

Many thanks
Steve

Actually, the link to the template is http://demo.yootheme.com/jul09/

http://demo.yootheme.com/index.php?show=jul09 contains the frame that has the navigation through the various templates.

I'm not able to see that in practice unfortunately.

Do a quick scan of that template using Anthony's performance grader:
http://www.joomlaperformance.com/component/option,com_performance/Itemid,52/

Use their demo URL: http://demo.yootheme.com/index.php?show=jul09/

Much slower and heavier than they claim.

Hi Donna

I think the performance issue still applies without the navigation.

Building on Mitch's original point that "templates are the biggest 
source of pain IMHO", if you're interested in performance, Anthony's 
tool is really good for testing templates before you buy.

Regards

Steve

Bear in mind that probably 60-80% of a Joomla pages speed is based on
content rather than the template. To do comparisions, you need to set up
copies of each template and measure with the same content and server.

That's what I did here:

Looks like you disabled sh404sef for now, when you enable it what do
your menu links on the left look like?

Subject: [joomla] Multi Site Possibilites
Message-ID: <SNT117-W46EE0097D8A1ADB678453FBB1A0@phx.gbl>


Hello everyone,

I have been doing some research on using Joomla in a multi site scenario.  I know Joomla does not support Multi Site, and the scenario is more about singal install, multi "customer" site.

Here is what I would like to achieve:

1) multiple customers having isolated Joomla website (no data sharing)
2) single install of the joomla codebase so that upgrade mgmt is streamlined
3) each customer would have thier own isolated db, not sinlge db with appended table names
4) each customer will have thier own linux user on a multisite VPS

Thanks in advance for your help and insight.
Tony V

There are several multisite extension solutions:
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/multiple-sites
(google too, some got de-listed)

I am not sure any of them are robust enough to scale. We built our own from
Scratch for Simplweb.com

Hi Steve

It will likely take a several days at least for search engines to update 
the listing.

You've done right thing by removing it from Global Configuration. Now, 
its just a question of waiting.

Hey Steve,

To set the site's title:

    Global Configuration -> Site -> Site Name.

Your template typically determines what gets put in the html <title>
element though, I would look there.

I believe there's a couple of bugs with the 1.5.13 release:
http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=430&t=423159

Might be good to hold off for 24 / 48 hours before updating. The Bug 
Squad is apparently busy getting the fixes ready.

Thanks to the security team for their diligence in releasing 1.5.13.

 From the  joomla.org website:
This release contains 26 bug fixes, two moderate-level security fixes and
one low-level security fix. It has been 3 weeks since Joomla 1.5.12 was
released on July 1, 2009. The Development Working Group's goal is to
continue to provide regular, frequent updates to the Joomla community.

I think that many of us who manage multiple sites are wondering if an easy
updater (a la Magic Updater, or whatever it was called) will be included in
the core at some time in the near future since the stated goal of the team
is to provide "frequent updates". Anyone know if this is in development?

Hi,

I placed this phrase ("Pictures of Melanoma Skin Cancer - MelanomaPictures.org") as my site name in the Joomla's global configuration. 

It shows up on the front page (http://www.melanomapictures.org/). Is there a way to keep the phrase in the global configuration and not making it show up in the frontpage?

best
Steve

Hey Mitch

Normally XMap, as it's pretty straight-forward and has the most plugins 
for other extensions:

Answer to my own question; courtesy of Mark Simko
go to administrative console.
go to Menus > main menu
open the menu item 'home'.
on the right side, under system parameters, there is an
option to turn off the title. That'll do it.

Subject: [joomla] JTable method
Message-ID: <1248794229.20217.291.camel@jersey>

I'm currently struggling through Packt Publishing's 'Learning Joomla 1.5
Extension Development', and I'm finding that the text frequently uses
code that remains unexplained. The author also makes method calls to
classes that get defined in the next file he covers, but at that point
it's not explained. I wouldn't recommend this book, but enough rant.

Here's my question:

He uses this code:

$row =& JTable::getInstance('Review', 'Table');

The $row object gets passed to a class in another file, so I wanted to
know what this object was, and how it is being created. I have no idea
what the 'Review' and 'Table' parameters are. So I tried looking them up
here: http://docs.joomla.org/JTable/getInstance . If you look there, you
may understand why I'm having trouble understanding even the official
documentation.

If anyone can give a brief 'splanation of this method's usage, I'd be
much obliged.

I'm also wondering if I'd be better off just using the direct calls to
the database from a database object created with JFactory rather than
use this class.

And just to throw a log on the fire, I'm not all that big a fan of MVC,
all the time. I think sometimes it just makes the code much harder to
follow. ;)

Thanks,
Mark

I have a love/hate relationship with JTable. It was created primarily
as a way for simple, canned access to database objects, like a
simplistic ORM of sorts. However it has some glaring shortcomings due
to the "no sharp corners allowed" approach.

I find myself jumping to good ol' JFactory::getDBO() more often than
not, as I'm happy doing it myself.

JTable is also very handy for whipping together admin screens,
assuming you have a very flat schema ;-)

Sometimes it's easier to make the direct calls, sometimes not, depending on what other data you need.

If the table's key consists of more than one field you cannot use JTable.

The table class for that example is probably in administrator/components/com_reviews/tables/reviews.php.

I have that book, too, and didn't get it from reading the book.  I didn't get it until I had to do it for real.  And it's faster to do $row->store than make db update calls.

Based on the documentation, what's to love?

I'm not finding it all that simple.

Yeah, I think I'm more comfortable doing it that way myself too. Found a
helpful tutorial on making custom modules at joomladin.com. I wish this
book had that kind of straightforward approach. I think I need a better
book.

That's what they are doing at this point in the text. Eventually, the
two components that I have to (read: hope to) build will have rather
complex schemas. One of those planned has about a dozen tables just to
be normalized. >8-0

Thanks for the feedback.

Yes, there is a file there, but at this point in the text of the book it
is basically empty; Just the defined /die statement.

So in this line:
$row =& JTable::getInstance('Review', 'Table');
does that refer to the review.php file in the table subdirectory. I
thought that might be a possibility, but the capitalization is wrong and
I'm on Linux where everything is case sensitive.


> I have that book, too, and didn't get it from reading the book.

So it's not just me! Thanks, I feel much better now. Do you have any
suggestions on what book I should get?

> I didn't get it until I had to do it for real.  And it's faster to do
$row->store than make db update calls.

So there  is a place for the JTable class. Thanks for the insight.

Mark

Oracle owns MySQL now.... And MySQL is in all likelihood the mostly widely
deployed DB in use with Joomla!  Not to mention the fact that MySQL is Open
Source.  Oracle also owns Sun now, which has Open Solaris and some other
major open source projects.  I think we want Oracle on our side.

Okay, I was thinking "Oracle db" which has nothing to do with open source or Joomla.
