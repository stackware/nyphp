Subject: [joomla] Quark to html
Message-ID: <663575.10262.qm@web35605.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Has anyone converted quark docs to html?

I have a client whose print newsletter is done in Quark and they want to have it on their Joomla site and searchable.

Their old newsletters are in pdf and I bought the pdf indexer but they don't like it because it doesn't find the page where the keywords are located.

I downloaded QuarkXpress and tried exporting to html but it exported the text as a graphic image, which of course is not searchable.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Wow, this question takes me back a few years! I used to use an plugin 
from Extensis to do this over 10 years ago. It was fairly reliable but 
did require a lot of tweaking. Unfortunately, they no longer make it.

Couple of options: easiest would be to copy and paste text into new 
Joomla content items. You'd lose the formatting but that helps keep a 
site looking all the same. There is an HTML export feature built into 
Quark called the HTML Text Export Filter. Finally, there are plugins 
currently being developed and sold that do the Quark->HTML export...more 
info available here:

Too bad the PDF indexer didn't work - that would have been the best, I 
think.

Wow, this question takes me back a few years! I used to use an plugin 
from Extensis to do this over 10 years ago called BeyondPress. It was 
fairly reliable but did require a lot of tweaking in BBEdit to make it 
work. The best part about it was that it pulled the graphics and text 
out in a reasonably succinct manner setting up tables, etc. 
Unfortunately, they no longer make it.

Has anyone else found Joomla's new forum to be difficult to use and search?

I try doing a search of keywords and I get very few results, which when I click on doesn't show me anything.

And the notifications from the subscriptions doesn't give the text of the post, which is not helpful.

We've talked about this at a previous meeting.

The search function on Joomla forums is typical of many many large sites--
it's embarrassingly bad. The list of major sites with large user bases and
completely useless search functionality is really, remarkably long. One
reason for this is how efficient Google site search is, which takes away
alot of incentive for improvement, given limited site development resources.


So the short answer is, just use Google site search and fine tune your
queries to hone in on exactly what you need.

I do wish there could be improvements on site searches using  a sites's own
search functionality, but I don't see much of that happening. If anyone
knows of an example of a site whose own search is equal to Google's let
alone superior, I would be interested in seeing that.

As for subbscription notifications, that was probably the contribution of a
junior developer who thought it would be a good way to "drive people to the
site" if the actual content weren't included in the email. Hopefully they'll
get spanked for that at some point, as it flies in the face of the direction
content driven development is headed.

HTH,  (& with apologies for the top post...)

Adobe had the chance to make pdf the format of choice for moving print media
to the web.

They dropped that ball long ago. pdf's work for what they are --portable
documents-- but are completely inadequate for websites.

Since indexing doesn't work, you're just as well off to go with Flash. Oh,
and lose the Quark too.

InDesign supports XML templating for print and while it has an export
function for web based workflows, IMO the better solution is just to call
the same XML from Flash that you call from InDesign for print. Easy peasy.

Obviously this leaves the indexibility problem unsolved, but preserves the
design. Fixing indexibility may likely be a matter of passing off the XML
page to the correct handler. If anyone is really interested in this, I'll
save it for another email.

HTH,

I have a Joomla component that does that.  It's called PDF Indexer.  It creates a searchable text file for the pdf.  When you find it in the search results it tells you which pdf it's in along with a link to open the pdf.

But this client wants the search results to take you to the location of the keyword in the pdf.

You can take the user to the correct page in the pdf file?  For example, if the user searches for the phrase "Hello, World", the search results will show a link to the pdf doc that contains that page, and when the user clicks on that link it will open the pdf to the page that has that phrase?

The Joomla project switched from Simple Machine's SMF forum to phpBB.
That is the biggest difference that you are all seeing, which is
simply a disparity between features as implemented between the two
different systems.

I find the content-free emails annoyingly bereft of useful information
too, just for the record ;-)

Message-ID: <352c93420803050311r50487459p61b9d2806f14e653@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Maybe one of you can help me, because Im starting to pull my hair out!

I'm trying to upload flv (flash video) files to the media manager and
no matter what I do, I keep getting this error 'Unsupported media
type.'

In global setting I changed the upload max to 30mb (the files I try to
upload are 10 - 12 mb)
In php.ini I've changed the upload max to 40mb

In global settings I've added flv to allowed extension and video/flv
to mime types.

Just to make sure that this was not registering properly I went to the
database and checked the media manager paramns which reads this

upload_extensions=flv,bmp,csv,doc,epg,gif,ico,jpg,odg,odp,ods,odt,pdf,png,ppt,swf,txt,xcf,xls,BMP,CSV,DOC,EPG,GIF,ICO,JPG,ODG,ODP,ODS,ODT,PDF,PNG,PPT,SWF,TXT,XCF,XLS,FLV
upload_maxsize=30000000
file_path=images
image_path=images/stories

upload_mime_illegal=text/html

does anybody know what else I should / can do?

Subject: [joomla] OT: mac dvd ripping
Message-ID: <47CEDDA0.6080106@nuthinwerked.com>

I'd like to rip content from a DVD onto my intel macbook for editing and 
eventual display on Google Video. I am creating the DVDs with a 
stand-alone JVC DVD burner.

I've tried Handbrake and had trouble with the audio dropping out on 
multiple machines. Ultimately, I'm hoping to rip particular segments of 
the video rather than the whole thing. As long as the program rips to a 
format that will load in Final Cut or the iLife
editor I can crop it.

Suggestions on software, free or commercial, would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance-
Graham

I generally use Handbrake - but I close all programs and dont use the 
machine while its ripping since its a pretty CPU-intensive process. Maybe 
this is the problem you're having?

Handbrake allows you to pick the chapters so there should be no need to 
rip an entire DVD just to pick out a segment. Once ripped, I use iMovie to 
select and extract a segment using markers.

Well, in Gary's stay, I guess I'll announce the March
meeting.  The meeting will be March 13th, at the usual
Robert Half.  Topics are as follows:

Oliver Rockwell:  A simple component to bypass the
vanilla content browsing of com_content

Anthony Ferrara: Performance with the Joomla CMS. 
This includes server side tweaks and alternative web
servers (Apache isn't the only one out there).

Mitch Pirtle: Taking the Joomla Framework beyond the
limit.  Leveraging the framework to build a high
traffic, highly scalable website.

As usual, there will be the "after festivities" at TGI
Fridays.  

If you havn't come before, please email me you name so
that I may place you on the list.

my company had some special needs of the category index pages which  
required a simple component to address. for instance we wanted content  
separated by month since we print monthly magazines and we wanted the  
current month's content to be more prominent on the index page with a  
cover image.

next meeting I'll explain how we accomplished this and what resistance  
joomla gave us along the way trying to bypass com_content. also some  
ideas we've had about an index page template concept since we have  
multiple sites having the same or similar requirements.

unfortunately I'm out of the country next week... hoping to finally be  
around in april to start sharing some of our development efforts with  
joomla.

Message-ID: <c2f754300803071121y5b436861k73f889fe1a8ca947@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Mitch or anyone--

     Just wondering if there are any Flickr or Photolog streams (tags or
groups) from a Joomla Event (such as the one we had at Google last year)
that have a decent number of photos?

     Our friends at WebTechNY.com, who also use Robert Half for their
meeting space (the day before our meeting, as it turns out) are demo-ing
some plugins, and I'd like to hook them up with a photostream like that to
use in the demo. Looking for a fairly large photo set which will really show
off the app.

best,

Forest

My apologies on this, but there was a mixup in the
meeting room for this Thursday at Robert Half (Someone
else was booked instead of us).  (The mixup was partly
my fault, so go ahead, throw eggs... :D )...

But the good news, is that we are booked for next week
(The 20th).  Sorry for any confusin that this may have
caused.  

Again, the user group meeting for this week is moved
until next Thursday.  Sorry for any inconvience. 
(I'll change it on the site as well).

Also, I will be in the city this Thursday night, (I'll
be in the lobby at Robert Half, incase any of you
don't get this message, or just want to hang out for
the night).  I'll be in the lobby until about 7:00pm,
and then move over to Fridays (it's at 47 East 42nd
St, between Madison and Vanderbuilt).  If you want to
come hang out, let me know.

If there are any issues, my cell phone # is
908-938-0042...

Hi guys,

Sorry with this is not a good idea, but I am a little desperated. 
I want to build a Cb for a company, but everything seem to be going wrong. I went to the forum, but not one single reply.

If one of you can give me some clue, or a place to get some clue it will be already a good help.

I implemented the CB, but lots of things are not good. Here are a few:

1) My user admin is showing on the list of members. I have tried everything I know, but still cannot hide.

2) don't know where I have to go to approve the images.

3) Everytime I click on a profile, it sends me back to the front page.

That just to begin with. If I have to go for a pay site, I inderstand, just give me the link.

Thank you

Anna

My apologies on this, but there was a mixup in the
meeting room for this Thursday at Robert Half (Someone
else was booked instead of us).  (The mixup was partly
my fault, so go ahead, throw eggs... :D )...

But the good news, is that we are booked for next week
(The 20th).  Sorry for any confusin that this may have
caused.  

Again, the user group meeting for this week is moved
until next Thursday.  Sorry for any inconvience. 
(I'll change it on the site as well).

Also, I will be in the city this Thursday night, (I'll
be in the lobby at Robert Half, incase any of you
don't get this message, or just want to hang out for
the night).  I'll be in the lobby until about 7:00pm,
and then move over to Fridays (it's at 47 East 42nd
St, between Madison and Vanderbuilt).  If you want to
come hang out, let me know.

If there are any issues, my cell phone # is
908-938-0042...

Subject: [joomla] 1.51 sef and images still a problem
Message-ID: <21159140.477891205464528014.JavaMail.root@vms068.mailsrvcs.net>

I have a website up that has the 1.51 patch, but if I turn on sef, the images in articles disappear.

I've looked at the source, and the src reference in the image tags are exactly the same, but for some reason the system does not display the images in the article when the sef options are turned on.

This is what an image tag looks like in an article(sub * for <>):
*img src="images/photos/ChrisDiTusaEagle/ce1.jpg" border="0" width="700" /*

This has got to get fixed. Anybody have any clues as to what is going on and how I can fix this?

Thanks,
Mark

Message-ID: <252213.94431.qm@web35607.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I'm getting a stack overflow at line 0 on one of my sites, but only in IE.

Does anyone know how/if this can be fixed?   Someone on the RocketTheme forum who was also having that problem thought it had to do with the host.

By way of follow up to our thread on the Joomla.org forum and the maddening
disfunctionality of its search function, I just noticed they have ripped out
their search engine and are using Google's site search. I didn't notice that
they did this when they switched over to phpBB, does anyone know when they
did that?

As a well-known and animated Warner Bros. character was known to remark
"well, if you can't beat 'em, join em!"

cheers,

Well, the meeting is scheduled for April 10th, in New
York.  I'm looking for presenters for the meeting (I
didn't get what was scheduled from Gary).  If you're
willing to present, reply with the topic, a brief
(paragraph at most) description of the topic, and the
estimated time (10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc). 
Thanks!

Anthony.

I could easily do 30 mins on my talk, even more if you need to fill out the
meeting.

There is a lot of ground to cover, although I'll make sure we don't lose
anybody!   ; - )

Well, with your topic, I wouldn't be surprised on 1 to
2 hours :-D... (Why not plan for 1 hour... If we go
less, then great)...

Forest, I don't know if you've talked about this before, but I'd be
interested in your take on the differences between Joomla and Drupal.
