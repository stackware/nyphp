Anyone have an extension or method they have been using successfully

Message-ID: <CAGgpsmqK6to613fE=5a21R+gn+5DgKt5HPuQTV83zwcVQT6ayQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've got 4 Joomla sites, of medium-complexity that I'm maintaining and
doing Joomla upgrades. Code is basically the same on the 4 sites. I've been
doing the system maintainance, development, and content updates myself for
a few years but now I'd like to hire a person/company to take this over. We
would continue doing template changes and content changes in-house. I work
for a research center with a small budget. What recommendations do you
have? How much would you expect to pay for this service? Is there anyone on
this list with the capacity to handle this work?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

Hi Gang,

Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving.

Want to let you all know that the December Joomla NYC monthly meeting is at
6:30 PM this Thursday at the usual spot - Lincoln Center, 146 West 65th
Street. For detailed directions, visit www.joomlanyc.org

We have a star-studded event for the final meeting of 2011. As always, free
admission, food, and bottled water.

Chaired by Donna Marie Vincent: Scott Wolpow will present the popular code
sharing system, GIT, Donna Gordon will demonstrate how to use Firebug, the
popular Firefox plugin used to troubleshoot CSS\HTML\JavaScript, and I will
show K2, the component that ads some CCK functions to Joomla.

There will also be the infamous Lightning Round. So bring your questions
and our team of Joomla experts will answer.

Hope to see you all on Thursday. (Dec. 8, 2011)

Best regards,

Steve

I'm curious to how many people here are familiar with using SSH and 
running commands from the linux command line?

I'm working on putting together a CLI Joomla Installer similiar to 
Drupal's "drush" - which can install Joomla! into a folder, upgrade 
modules, etc from the command line - and I'm curious if there are enough 
people familiar enough with running from the linux command line on this 
list, and interested, to play around/test it.

Re an SSH installer:

Hi Gary,

If your goal is wide usage of your tool, then I'd recommend against solely
using ssh. -- Maybe use ssh as an alternative interface.

Many hosting sites don't provide ssh access to their servers these days.
And, in general, I have not seen admins with knowledge of ssh or command
line tools.

I'd look at the WP model of  adding more advanced abilities to the admin
interface.

Regards,

Larry

My goal is about half a dozen people so I don't face the mind suck of 
building a tool that only makes sense to myself.

Primarily though, it's a tool for my own use because jumping through the 
GUI install steps is tedious and boring.  I'd much rather run
"jconsole.phar -i /var/www/mynewsite.com -d joomladb -u dbuser -p 
dbpassword"

And have it install everything and setup without doing the step by step 
install.

Mind you, for others, remembering all that stuff[or looking it up each 
time] is more time consuming and tedious than using the web installation 
package - so that should still exist.

Shell-based installs are a great idea. Would make maintaining multiple

I would love to have an official "blessed" install script. Whenever I
cobble together one of my own, I always fear getting it enough wrong to
matter. So, count me in.

Subject: [joomla] Reminder: December Joomla Meeting is tomorrow night
Message-ID: <CABcNofPD=davWphv5n2=JHrga97jRS3eTka6FvT5GB=Z=hkHNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings!

This is a reminder that the December Joomla NYC meeting takes place
tomorrow (12/08/11) at 6:30 PM at Lincoln Center, 146 West 65th Street. For
directions, consult www.joomlanyc.org

I recently heard from Scott Wolpow that he will be unable to attend the
meeting and give his GIT presentation.

However, I will present the K2 component and discus other CCKs (Content
Construction Kit) that can be used with Joomla. And Laura Gordon will
demonstrate how to use Firebug and Firefox. As well as the Lightning Round,
where you can bring your questions and get answers from Joomla experts.

Admission is free and there will be snacks and bottled water.

Hope to see everyone tomorrow night!

All best,

Steve

Hi Gang,

One last reminder about tonight's December Joomla meeting. As always, we
are going to meet at 6:30 PM at our usual place in Lincoln Center, 146 West
65th Street. (For detailed directions see www.joomlanyc.org )

 And because there are now only two presenters rather than the original
three, each presenter will have more time.

Laura Gordon now will present Mosets Tree, an excellent directory extension
that works with Joomla 1.7. If you ever need to display thousands of items
from a database, this is the tool.

I will present the K2 Joomla component, which brings CCK (Content
Construction Kit) to Joomla. This extension brings many of the content
presentation features found in WordPress and Drupal to Joomla. If we have
time, I'll show you how to build a blog using K2, complete with features
like comments, etc.

A great way to finish 2011.

Hope to see everyone on Thursday night.

Message-ID: <CABcNofMH5sYvCSi+R_u=L4eQpA+V9aJtg_3=VXBuc83NyZsbww@mail.gmail.com>

Wow!

I want to thank everyone for showing up at tonight's Joomla Meet-Up.

I really thought that the meeting would not be well attended due to
Christmas and holiday parties, but it was a great crowd. Every seat was
filled. I am thinking 25 to 30 Joomla fanatics. The group has grown in the
past 12 months.

Hopefully, I will see everyone at the next meeting on Jan. 12, 2012.

As promised, here is the list of websites and contact information for K2
and the other Joomla CCKs that were shown.

K2: http://getk2.org

Content Builder: http://crosstec.de/en/extensions/joomla-cck-download.html

Zoo: http://www.yootheme.com/zoo/

Seblod: http://www.seblod.com/

And the Mosets Tree directory component, which Donna Vincent and Laura
Gordon did a present job presenting, can be found at http://www.mosets.com

I also want to point out that Fotis Evangelou of Joomla Works and the
developer of K2, has posted an excellent group of how-to K2 videos:
http://getk2.org/documentation/videos

Happy Holidays and hope to see everyone in 2012.

Best regards,

Steve

I just got an email at 8pm last night, that I wish I saw during our
meeting.  some of you may remember that Donna mentioned the concern about
Mosets tree was the lack of being able to have different designs for
different categories, and different fields by different categories...guess
what, they are addressing that exact issue in the next release...see
comment below.

thanks,
Laura
------------------------

Hi Laura,

 Thank you. Yes, Mosets Tree 2.2 does work with Joomla 1.7 and will do too
when Joomla 2.5 is released.

 I'm also currently working on a new version of Mosets Tree that will have
some very exciting features. One of them would be the ability to create
category specific fields, essentially allowing you to create 2 or more
directories with a single installation of Mosets Tree. Stay tuned for more
information on this.

Best regards,
Lee Cher Yeong

Hi everyone!

I've been comissioned to redesign a website in Joomla.

My client loved the flash-based site of an advertisement agency and she
would like her site to have the same look and feel. In short, when clicking
a menu item, content would slide down and be visible. Sort of an accordeon
effect.

This is the link: http://www.brunofree.com.br/dezaff/

Any tips on how I can accomplish a similar effect with Joomla?

Thanks!!!!

Chris,

Could you point me somewhere I can find an example or further information?

I'm not a coder, so JS is somewhat of a mistery to me...:-)

Thanks!

Off the top of my head, I would look at the various menu components like megamenu (I think that was the name). And also check out the templates at http://themeforest.net/.? Some of them are pretty cool.?

Your not going to find an extension that does this because it's going to 
be very graphic intensive and highly individual...at least that is my 
experience with people who want fancy sites like this.

Yootheme and Rockettheme both have themes where they have accordions and 
other fancy javascript effects that will probably cover 70% of your 
needs.  For example, check out spotlight in yootheme: 
http://www.yootheme.com/widgetkit

That said, your still going to be stuck with having to customize the 
other 30%... so at the end of the day you might want to take a pass on 
this site.

I would also add Joomlart's templates as something which is worth
looking at for accordion style dynamic menus.
http://www.joomlart.com/demo/#templates.joomlart.com/ja_kranos

Factor in the learning curve (as with all template vendors) if you
haven't worked with their framework before.

Cheers, Terry

Actually, this is a job that is already paid for, so I can't take a pass on
it.

On the bright side, I warned the clients that the example website runs on
flash. Cue to "and flash doesn't run in iPhones and iPads...", which always
brings somewhat of a terror looks on their face... :-) So, I warned them
I'd probably not be able to come up with a solution just like that, but I'd
look around for alternatives.

Thank you all for the input.

All the best!

Yea I am out right now, but hmtl5 and javascript is almost a replacement
for flash, donmt get my wrong there surely things that only flash can do.

One thing you won't find is any component or wysisyg editor that will give
you this effect, you are going to need a developer to build it.

If you search for html animation both google and adobe have created amazing
things without flash

Hi Gang,

The long awaited, Joomla 2.5 beta version 1 is now available for download.
http://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5397-joomla-25-beta1-released.html


Keep in mind that this version is just for testing and not yet ready for
actual website building.

Looks like there are a lot of goodies in the new version. We owe the long
list of programmers many thanks. On the site, you will see information on
how you can help with testing.

Hopefully, you will make some time to install it locally and see how it
works.

Wishing everyone Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah!

All best,

Steve

Installed it locally. Sounds promising. No problems so far. Things are
going smooth. Loved the new smart search feature!

They have decided to go with a random number version system. :)

It is the goal to catch up to the correct number which should be Joomla 4.0

Joomla 1.x is 1
1.5 should have been 2
1.6 should have been 3
Just my opinion.

1.6 and 1.7 were transitional versions to 1.8. 

1.8 is now being called 2.5 because the numbering was off since 1.5 which should have been 2.0.

I want to have an Article that allows for extra fields for the Joomla

that does this? Thanks!

There are a bunch of Joomla extensions that can add fields to Joomla.

The most popular is K2 at http://getk2.org

And there is also Zoo by YooTheme, Seblod and ContentBuilder from CrhssTec
http://crosstec.de/en/  and more.

I am also hopeful that adding fields, and comments will be part of Joomla
2.5, but I did not see them in the first beta of Joomla 2.5. Maybe next
time.

Happy Holidays!

In case you haven't seen this, there's a discussion about 2.5 Beta in the
forum:

http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=683588

Regarding the version numbers, I came across this video where Ron Severdia
of the Production Leadership Team explains it.

We may understand this,  the biggest problem is the paying client.
They do not get it.
I had clients who wanted to update to 1.7 from 1.5.
Now they want to know where 2.0 is.

Why re-invent  methods.
The odd-even works.

ie 2.0 is unstable, 2.1 is stable.

Easy to explain, easy to remember.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla 1.7.3 - warning about PHP temporary directory
Message-ID: <4FA3A383-BEE5-4018-8388-BA38B5F9B56E@gmail.com>

I installed Joomla 1.7.3.  I noticed a warning in the Extension Manager: Warnings

The PHP temporary directory is the directory that PHP uses to store an uploaded file before Joomla! can access this file. Whilst the directory not being set isn't always a problem, if you are having issues with manifest files not being detected or uploaded files not being detected, setting this in your php.ini file might fix the issue.

This is on my in-house CentOS server, and everything is set to 755 on the path. I've not seen this message with  previous versions of Joomla. I Googled and see people have had this issue before and most reported that changing permissions didn't fix it. 

Is there a fix for this, or is this a bug that should be reported? Thanks!

Subject: [joomla] Joomla 1.7,

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv9g39Lx2495MrxgUiMuwT6um1BuwHtd4G+18qwDxiCyQw@mail.gmail.com>

I've gotten a template from youjoomla.com and while it does install,
their demo version supplied with .sql files doesn't. I never had this
happen with Joomla before. However, I can login as admin and access
everything in the demo version, but the main (front) page won't load
and display. It comes up with a server 500 error which doesn't make
sense to me because I have another installation of Joomla 1.7 running
fine in another directory.

I've not run across this problem before so I thought I would ask here
to see if anyone has some suggestions what might be the cause of this.
Again, as admin I can see all the demo data in there and access
everything there, the site pages just don't work. Thanks!

Hi David,

See in the public_html/error_log to see why do you have the error 500.

Thanks for the reply Lucas. Error were enabled for this Joomla
installation so I turned them on and found this in the log:
[26-Dec-2011 18:24:44] PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function
mb_internal_encoding() in
/home/www/html/youplusdemoj17/components/com_k2/helpers/route.php on
line 52

I'm not familiar with the internals to Joomla, but here is the PHP
code leading up to line 52. Line 52, "
mb_internal_encoding("UTF-8");" is the last line in this code
fragment.

        function getUserRoute($userID) {
                $needles = array (
                        'user'=>(int)$userID
                );
                $user = &JFactory::getUser($userID);
                if(K2_JVERSION == '16' &&
JFactory::getConfig()->get('unicodeslugs') == 1) {
                        $alias = JApplication::stringURLSafe($user->name);
                }
                else if(JPluginHelper::isEnabled('system',
'unicodeslug') || JPluginHelper::isEnabled('system',

                        $alias = JFilterOutput::stringURLSafe($user->name);

                        mb_internal_encoding("UTF-8");

I got it solved, thanks for your help Lucas.

This was the fix:

yum install php-mbstring

I will look again, but I don't recall seeing documentation that says
this is what was required.

Subject: [joomla] K2 and Allvideos - How to do a Youtube thumbnail?
Message-ID: <2E344C2D-DC65-4CA2-9513-9B9EFF159E0D@gmail.com>

Anyone familiar with K2 and Allvideos? I installed K2 and it looks very useful.  (Thanks again Stephen Britton for recommending it.) I then needed to install Allvideos so it would work with media.

I want to be able to have embedded Youtube links with control over the thumbnail being displayed, but since Youtube limits your selection to three random video frames to act as the "poster" or thumbnail, I'd prefer to select my own graphic and have it displayed. 

So I have been checking out K2 and Allvideos. On Joomlaworks.gr they have as an example of a website using their Allvideos plug-in here:
http://www.impactwrestling.com

Look in the above URL and see on the right where it says Video Gallery. Notice how a graphic is displayed first in the youtube video before it's played and then it proceeds normally to play the Youtube video. That's what I want to be able to do, create my own graphic to display before the user clicks on the video.

Since I'm new to K2 and Allvideos as I mentioned, it's not clear to me how this is being accomplished to display these Youtube videos with the thumbnails. I poked around a little in the HTML but that's only going to show me after it's been processed by the plug-ins. 

I've seen example code like this:

{youtube}heu37ej3qs{/youtube}

which embeds a Youtube player. But I've been unable to find an example of where a graphic image to be used as the thumbnail is being specified.

Any brilliant insight to this would be greatly appreciated.

Hi David,

I am glad that K2 is working out for you.

As for AllVideos. I have never used AllVideos with K2, but AllVideos is a
very popular extension and I am sure that there is a way to fix it.

I suggest that you contact JoomlaWorks.gr, the developers of AllVideos. It
is interesting to note that  JoomlaWorks also developed K2. There should be
a way to make AllVideos work with K2.

I am also not sure about the source of your video, but if you are using
YouTube or Vimeo, you should be able to just paste the video links into the
document editor (on the side without formatting).

Let me know if you find a solution.

Best regards,

Steve

David,

I believe with a locally hosted video you place a .jpg with the same 
file base name as the video, and it becomes the poster image (image that 
displays before the video plays).

My first instinct would be to try placing a jpg with the same name as 
the YouTube video in the base folder for the locally hosted videos - as 
specified in the AllVideos plugin.

When I used AllVideosReloaded with Joomla 1.5, (either from their doc or 
the JW Player site - I don't remember which right off) code like this 
would work {m4v img="poster/testimonial-poster.jpg" width="440" 
height="266"}sbhc1{/m4v}

if the structure was /images/stories/video
then poster would be /images/stories/poster

Whether you can designate a poster image regardless of whether you are 
streaming a local or remote video I can't say. I never tried remote.

Hope this spares you the several bruises I suffered banging my head 
against the wall on this problem.
Mark

Hi all,

We are in the process of putting together ideas for Joomla! Camp 2012.
This event will be a small event sometime in March for 50-60 people.
(Hopefully Sunday, March 11, 2012 or March 18, 2012)

If anyone has contacts with any organizations that we might be able to get
space from, please email me.  We are looking to keep our costs as low as
possible for this event to keep it affordable for everyone to attend.

Thanks for your help and support! :)

thanks,
Laura

Thanks for the reply, Mark.

I looked at AllVideosReloaded and it doesn't look like it supports an img for use with Youtube unless I overlooked something.

I use hwdvideoshare because it does use images for videos. But can you not use youtubes embed code in K2 instead of allvideos? That would do it.

Hi Donna.

Thanks for your post.

This is my understanding, which could be totally wrong but here it goes.

I installed K2 for the first time using Joomla 1.7.3. When testing it out to put in a Youtube video link, it complained that Allvideos wasn't installed.
So I installed Allvideos, but still have not been able to figure a way to have my own thumbnail/poster image displayed with the embedded Youtube player.
I saw on the website for Allvideos they mentioned a high-traffic website that used Allvideos, located at:
http://www.impactwrestling.com
While looking at the website, I noticed on the right hand side of the screen they have labeled a "Video Gallery". It appears to me they are able to have a thumbnail of their own as the poster for the Youtube video, and when you click on the video it starts.
I did a View HTML Source and could see they use the K2 routines and also make reference to vidthumb (which I couldn't find as part of Allvideos) with a link to a JPG for their thumbnails.

You can do with K2 and Allvideos this:
{youube}id_code_for_youtube_video_goes_here{/youtube} and it will take care of the embedded video player for you. I have seen some examples where you can pass the width and height of the player window through, but no way that I could find to specific an image to be used as the poster/thumbnail. I'm guessing that it supports doing this locally hosted videos such as M4V, because it might actually insert your graphic into the player.

Subject: [joomla] K2 templates - documentation?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv8Qa0hhJhyrKk_XCjVCsN92W6bnBxaeCtgo2bJVdKHS+Q@mail.gmail.com>

I need to modify a K2 template and I'm having a hard time finding any
sort of documentation or tutorials on how to do this. Maybe I'm
looking in the wrong places. So I thought I'd ask here to see if
anyone has an information source for modifying K2 templates.

Thanks!

if you check k2 website for the "override" package there is a package available that is basically everything you put in the HTML folder in your template you can go ahead and do whatever you want in those files without breaking anything.

Thanks for the reply, Chris. I had the impression those files were updates
and those were included with the latest release of 2.5.4. But I will check
them out.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla 2.5 features explained
Message-ID: <CABcNofM7VUmg4LzMGHiDmcsrBKmjRNN7G95u8cV=71EvuX+=Bg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings All!

Joomla developer Andrea Tarr, who you may remember as a presenter at Joomla
Day NYC 2011, has done an excellent write up about all the features in the
Joomla 2.5 release.

http://bit.ly/sS8Ptk

There are many new features. Among the ones that I am most excited about
are:

* Multiple database support. Along with MySQL, Joomla 2.5 supports
Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres, SQLite, and PDO (PHP Database
Objects).

* A new and improved site search engine.

* CAPTCHA is now part of core and will (hopefully!) keep spammers from
abusing forms.

* Built-in update notification to let you know when the latest Joomla
updates are released.

Usually at this time of the year, I am skiing with my brother in Utah, but
the snow has not been great so I have keeping busy with work and
experimenting with the latest versions of  VirtureMart 2.0 and SobiPro. We
have some great new toys to keep us occupied.

It looks 2012 is going to be a banner year for Joomla!

Happy New Year! and I hope to see everyone at the January Joomla NYC user
group meeting.

All best,

Steve

Hi Gang,

Our friend Hagen Graf - you may also remember him from Joomla Day NYC 2011
- has released a book, "Joomla! Development - A Beginner's Guide." And
right now the book is available for free as a PDF.  http://bit.ly/uL3w8E

If you ever wanted to make a module, plug-in or component, this book will
give you a great overview and even if you do not want to become a Joomla
developer, this book is worth reading for a better understanding on how
Joomla works. I am not sure how long this book will be free so download it
now.

I also came across another interesting read that is not about Joomla, but a
topic that you might be interested in - "9 Surprising New Facts About
Social Media in America." http://bit.ly/tDnOe0

All best,

Steve
