<PRE>

I have enjoyed reading this thread especially since the information 
given is not only very useful but also it is honest and ethical. What 
has not been mentioned are the unethical ways to get higher ratings and 
I greatly appreciate the community for not suggesting these other 
methods. I recently had an incident with a new customer who had his site 
hosted by a Company in the mid-west. He was not happy with service so he 
called me. I created a new Joomla CMS site from the content and design 
he was using with this other company. When the new site went live, I 
noticed something pretty fascinating.  You could do a google search with 
legitimate search terms that you would expect to use to find his 
business. When you got Google search results you also got hits for URL's 
that made no sense at all such as example: <A HREF="http://(Company">http://(Company</A> 
Name)/Rhianna.html or <A HREF="http://(Company">http://(Company</A> Name)/ Christiana Milan.htm. There 
were literally 15-20 hits listed in the google search results that made 
no sense at all.  Of course, these hits were broken once we went live 
with the new site. I did not create redirects on the new site for these 
bogus url's but did for legitimate ones.

My client was paying for SEO and high google ratings from the previous 
web company. I had to explain to him why I could not guarantee those 
same results.  I will do all I can to get a client listed as high as 
possible in search engines but I will not do the unethical redirects and 
garbage that I see people do to get higher search results. Some of these 
SEO Companies are just snake oil salesmen.  I will not charge and/or 
promise something that is basically undeliverable through honest means. 
Luckily, my new client appreciated my honesty and is not interested in 
higher search engine rankings through unethical tricks.

My two cents
