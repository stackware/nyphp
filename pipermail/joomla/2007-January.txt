Subject: [joomla] Trying to get "From Scratch" template to have a menu like
	SolarFlare's template Main Menu
Message-ID: <f8a0c59c0701022136p3b552a3brc3416e4b01c7ad2d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All!

Hope everyone is enjoying the New Year!

I am building a template from scratch.  I would like to get the menu
to display with the colors that change like the SolarFlare template
Main Menu.

I do not know where to begin or where to go to get information as to
how to do it.

I played with a SolarFlare template previously and was able to alter
the CSS and Menu Link Image so that I could change the colors for the
Main Menu.  However, I cannot figure out how to do this from scratch.

If anyone can provide some direction with this and/or suggest a
Tutorial that I could read to accomplish this, it would be
appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

You can experiment with CSS to do this, mainly a:hover and using
classes for your menus.

Barrie has provided a real nice tutorial (actually several) as linked
in another thread, and you can find CSS tutorials all over the web.

I cannot think of a specific tutorial that covers Joomla menus and CSS
though. Anyone?

Hi!

Thanks for responding Mitch!

My problem is, I cannot figure out what code in the CSS should be
written to affect this type of menu.  I understand enough CSS to write
the code but I am having a disconnect with which class/id affects this
type of menu.  Maybe I will just try a cut and paste CSS from the
SolarFlare template that has a similar menu in the template.  I might
be able to use it as an example.  Will post the results here.

One option for you is self experimentation, which is my favorite way
to figure something out. Create a blank index.php page for your
template, and only have the base XHTML to start with. Then, add the
PHP code for Joomla to render the one module position that has your
menu in it - and nothing more. Then you can write a simple CSS file
that works specifically with that markup.

Sounds simplistic, but if you are trying to figure out something that
doesn't make sense, I've learned that making things as painfully
simple as possible speeds up the understanding ;-)

Message-ID: <f8a0c59c0701040940o2e0adf48p954ca0ae81220df6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All!

I sure will be glad when I can finish this site.  This is a learning
experience.  I am having fun, but sometimes it can be exasperating.

I have been trying to get the CafePress module and component which is
an older mambo module and component to work with Joomla v1.x.  I was
able to get some help with the module and that is working fine now.
The component is another matter.

The component installs with no problem, however when I try to refresh
the cache in the back end I get the following message,

"DB function failed with error number 1146
Table 'msessie_joom2.mos_menu' doesn't exist SQL=select m.id from
mos_menu as m inner join mos_components as c on m.componentid = c.id
and c.option = 'com_cafepress'Cache Refreshed."

Also, there appears to be an image missing in the front end of the
component.  You can see what I am referring to at this post:
CafePress module not working
http://forum.joomla.org/index.php/topic,42462.msg626134.html#msg626134

Otherwise the component appears to be functioning properly.

Does anyone have any experience with the Cafepress Component on the
list?  I have also placed a zipped copy of the component file into the
Joomla Forum post noted above.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to
(1) How to fix the database problem?
(2) How to get the image to display on the front end?

Does anyone know if CafePress changed its code so that the missing
image is no longer supported/displayed by CafePress?

I have not been able to get a response from the scripts' creator.  I
am hoping to
(1) Repackage the scripts and post them at the "Forge" if I can get
both to run properly.
(2) Try to get someone who knows what they are doing to volunteer to
maintain the scripts.

The scripts will probably work with Joomla v1.x.  I dunno about v1.5.

There is another option provided by a group called PrestoGifto.
PrestoGifto provides a free CafePress Component and Module for Joomla
and WordPress at PrestoGifto.com but, it comes with the condition of
the PrestoGifto rotating their PID in 1 in 5 times.  I do not think
that I want to go down that road but, Anyone on the list who is
interested and wants to check it out can do so at: :
http://forums.cafepress.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/594104/m/45210898?r=39610898#39610898

The default table prefix in Joomla is "jos_" and for Mambo it is "mos_" so 
if you are using the defaults for Joomla then the MySQL query above *will* 
fail since its looking for a mos_menu table. Educated guess says you can 
probably replace all queries with "jos_" instead of "mos_" in the table 
names.

Of course, Im assuming the table structures (number of fields, name and 
types of fields) is the same between Mambo and Joomla but that my not be 
the case.

Subject: [joomla] Subscribe to a BLOG feature for Joomla?
Message-ID: <16f162f88eca5e33d9c6fc0f3933eb10@comcast.net>

I'm building a site in Joomla where the client wants to have a blog of 
company news items/announcements, and be able to have visitors opt-in. 
I know there is a login form for users to register in Joomla, but I was 
wondering if there is a way to be able to have them sent an e-mail 
letting them know that the blog or news item has been updated or that 
in general there is new content added to the web site. Also, we need 
for these registered users not to be able to post blogs or follow-up 
comments on the blogs.

Is there something out there already that does this? Or have I 
overlooked this feature already in Joomla?

Thanks!

That would be the RSS export module. There are also many other 3rd
party RSS feed generators available on the forge, that let you
generate many types of feeds for many types of purposes.

There are mailing list managers available too, but to me RSS feeds
were meant for this exact kind of purpose.

Subject: [joomla] mp3 player
Message-ID: <459DCBAD.9050005@gmail.com>

I'm sure other may have come across this and can offer a solution 
(hopefully different and easier to implement than what I'm thinking).

I am building a joomla website and part of it needs to have an iTunes 
like interface where visitors can listen to music, and buy it. I'm using 
virtumart for the shopping cart. I can't seem to find an mp3 player for 
joomla that keeps the locations of the files completely hidden from the 
end user, thus opening up the possibilities for people to steal the 
music. Here's the conclusion I've come to: a flash interface (because if 
the results end up in the swf, and not the html, then they are not 
visible to the end user and they don't show up in the page source) that 
calls the database, and stores the data within flash or through a 
temporary xml file (created by a php script) that the visitor would have 
no knowledge of, and that also acts as a music player, with each row of 
the database results being a particular song/piece of music that can be 
played by clicking on it (or preferrably double clicking, if possible) 
and added to the shopping cart with another click.

I've looked at the available mp3 players for joomla and they do not fit 
my needs. Am I missing something? Have I overlooked something?

Also, does flash integrate easily into joomla in a component? Are there 
other issues I should be aware of as I build out this project? Thanks,

Seizo

Hi,

I am a bit new to joomla.  The default security for the admin side seems
strange to me.  You have to be super admin to change the template but you
can add components.

How would I remove the installers for components, modules, and mambots from
the admin?  I want to add the ability to upload and change the template.

Thanks
Alvin

How do you mix the colors of the text or fonts in the menus? For 
example, "everything" where "every" is one font, and "thing" is another 
font? Or instead of fonts, different colors?

Thanks in advance,

You can try putting html code straight into your menu name like every<font
color="red">thing</font>, if this is what you mean.

Hi Everyone,

   Can someone clue me in as to how to increase the inactivity timeout for
the admin login? I'm using Joomla on a development box and its getting to be
an annoyance to have to re-login every single time I switch screens for too
long.

   Thanks very much!

Subject: [joomla] How to handle many friendly URLs to specific pages in
	Joomla?
Message-ID: <1de528c8f25ceae72d54a3ab314ae0f5@comcast.net>

(As I continue to learn by mucking around...:-) )

A domain has an FAQ, where the URL needs to stay as domain.com/faq.

What is the best way to do this? Enable SEO, copy htaccess.txt to 
.htaccess and do a redirect of of domain.com/faq to 
domain.com/content/category/1/1/2/ ?

If so, this sounds workable for several menu items I think.

What about this example, a Joomla web site where many alumni profiles 
will be created (based on data collected from a survey form.) How can 
this be made to friendly URLs such as
domain.com/jerry
domain.com/elaine
domain.com/kramer
domain.com/uncleleo

instead of URLs like domain.com/content/category/1/1/2/ etc?

Is the solution to set-up a huge redirect list ?

Thanks in advance,

That is one option, another is to try one of the SEF enhancements
(like OpenSEF, SEF Advanced, or many others) and see if they can do
what you want. There are other, more drastic measures, but you should
work with something that is easier to maintain for now...

For a more automated approach to url rewriting you might want to try  
some of the existing solutions.

opensef is open source and quite flexible although not as easy to  
implement with some third party components, but great with joomla  
standard components

http://projects.j-prosolution.com/projects/os-projects/project- 
opensef.html

SEF Advanced works extremely well with most of the components that I  
have played with although not as flexible as the one above, plus it  
is encrypted and cost around $50. http://www.sakic.net

These are interesting questions.  As an aside, I think that the lack  
of built in "aliasing" as SEF Advance calls it really hinders  
Joomla's potential growth.  It's been difficult for me to convince  
small non profits that their URL's might lose some flexibility that  
basic HTML in Apache provides.

For example, if you have:

http://www.svots.edu/Library/index.html

in straight HTML, your user can typically enter the following in the  
address bar:

http://www.svots.edu/Library

and get to the appropriate page.

I haven't found anything in months of forum-hopping that would  
describe how to make this functionality work.  The best I can do is  
create an alias in SEF advance like:

http://www.svots.edu/Library/index.html/			[the trailing slash is  
there on purpose]

Maybe I just need to learn some Apache rewriting rules..?

Message-ID: <c2f754300701291418r9f49148gb13424f5ee112990@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I have a quick and I think easy question about linking to a calendar module.
We're using JEvents with the Events Component linked to mos_mainbody and the
JEvents Module linked on the side navigation. Whenever this page loads, the
Component part doesn't actually display anything until the user clicks some
day in the Calendar Module, ie the main content area always loads blank.
Once the user clicks a date in the module, the Component calendar loads up
nices with its own navigation (view by day/week/month/etc.)

My question is how to set it so when the user first lands on the page, the
Component displays content (either the whole month or the current day.) It
seems funny that the Component would load blank, but after checking all the
configurations I can't see what is making it do that. If anyone has any
ideas, I'd be very grateful.

(PS/btw- we are using ExtCalendar for a different site, but this one we want
to stick with Jevents so events can be added via the admin interface.

TIA,

Frest

Thanks for the suggestions by everyone. I installed OPENSEF and it 
solved the problem. It does allow you to take a menu item, such as the 
FAQ example and be able to have it referred to externally by whatever 
URL you wish such as /faq/my-faq.html. It also does some intelligent 
naming based on the title for other pages URLs as well, but you can be 
specific of what you want for each URL. The elegant part of this is 
that it doesn't make the user aware that a redirect (even if it is) is 
taking place.

Login as admin then select Global Checkin from the System menu.

The expired logins will disappear when the session lifetime has been 
exceeded - dont worry about those
