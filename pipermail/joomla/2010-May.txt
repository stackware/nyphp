I created a group lastnight for joomlanyc, but it is waiting to be approved.  I then saw that in their group policies that they are waiting to approve all future groups until they can put guildelines together, so my guess it may take a while.

I will let you know when it is up on the joomla.org site.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinkGbpbtYqnwpDu02X7eX6ghrEPpdPY1snZEZxz@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all.

Is it possible to assign a module to a Joomla article which has no
menu link?  For example, on the below URL
http://bit.ly/csV1Sd

I would actually prefer to assign a custom module for all articles
displayed in a table format under this category, as opposed to
globally assigning the main menu module to all pages.  However, I am
unable to do so, as from the menu assignment for this module the only
options are
- all
- none
- select menu items from list

with more granular options not being available (all articles in category XYZ)

Thanks

Subject: [joomla] component to create" templated" articles?
Message-ID: <4BF49BAD.9010107@omnistep.com>

Before I potentially embark upon recreating a wheel, does anyone know of 
a Joomla component that will iterate through rows in database table 
merging the data into designated fields in a template (template in a 
"general" HTML sense - not a Joomla template) then export the result 
into Joomla articles?

The database information may be updated by a custom component within the 
Joomla admin or perhaps though a external non-Joomla application ( the 
database/content management  is separate and not within the scope of 
what I am asking above).

An example application for this would be a series of bio or profile 
pages which should have the same structure and layout: 
name,photo,description, contact information, links, etc.

I am envisioning an admin component which contains a "export database to 
articles" button that will take the database data, merge it with the 
template, create the articles, then save the article id's. Any 
subsequent exports will save updated data to the same article id so as 
not to create duplicates.

I am leaning towards this method  instead of creating a custom end 
user-facing component because that would involve writing additional 
plugins to integrate with the search and other components.

If there is a better way to implement what I am asking? Suggestions are 
welcome.

Yeah, was wondering if you really just needed an import to a CCK
extension like K2 or FlexiContent.

I paged through all the Joomla extensions last night and arrived at the 
same two candidates: K2 and FlexiContent.

Digging into Flexi, I was a little turned off by the fact that the meaty 
part of its documentation is still only in French.
K2 looked like it could work but might be overkill.

I'll probably toy with K2 this weekend.  If it's too bulky then it might 
be time to get my feet wet and jump into the Joomla component 
development pool.

Every cell phone manufacturer generally provides some form of 
"emulator", usually a java application where you can load an "image" of 
the cell phone OS and then pretend like your using the cell phone in a 
little window sized to the cell phone.

Sometimes they will allow "developers" to download those images for 
free, and sometimes you have to download it off an existing phone.

Blackberries:
http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/resources/simulators.jsp

IPhone:
http://developer.apple.com/iphone/index.action
[I believe you need to sign up for their developer program at 99/year 
for access and the emulator only runs on a Mac]

Android:

Or you could use something like DeviceAnywhere which basically gioves you 
virtual access to almost any popular mobile device.

100$/month plus 20$/hour..

Or if you don't need Blackberry, just android and iphone, 30$/month and
20$/hour.

Worth it for general all cell phone testing needed, not sure if the cost is
worth it for just 3 emulations needed.

I would make it a hidden field on the form and give it a value, like "User".  The name can be duplicated, it's the username that has to be unique.

Subject: [joomla] Removing name field from user registration

I've spent the better part of a weekend tracing through the convoluted mess of MVC coding, trying to remove the required name field from the user registration component.

There are several recent posts on the Joomla forums looking for a
solution to this exact problem (removing the name field from
registration). There are no posted solutions.

Gary had suggested that I create my own registration form, but there are so many links to the registation page throughout the site that I felt this was impractical.

I've removed the input field from the form, but the validation process spits back a request for the name field to be filled in. I've tried to trace back where this gets validated. It looks like somewhere there is a validate.js file, but I cannot find it. It is possibly part of mootools.

So now this is what I think I am going to do. I'll go back into the form and assign a value for the name field - something generic like 'left blank'. However, this is something that may be overwritten with a Joomla update, so it would be best to do this as a template override if possible.

Any thoughts on template overrides? Where to put it, how to structure it.

 Any thoughts on the original track, which was to eliminate validation of the name field? How it gets requested. Changes that I might be overlooking such as in an xml file or class file.

Thanks,
Mark

I would agree this is very simple fix, you really shouldn't be hacking the core if you don't need to.

Oh, I don't want to hack the core at all. What Donna described is what I
had in mind. Touching these files at all is 'hacking the core'. Getting
at the field validation is just way too invasive. Hopefully the template
override option will work out and I won't have to leave the core hacks
in place.

Every time I tackle one of these problems I learn more, and realize I
know even less. It's like an adventure into an abyss. I'm gonna have to
start using a version control system to leave digital breadcrumbs. I've
got backup files all over the place.

Yea just do an HTML override for the register component in your template html folder and you are good to go.

Actuslly, only if you are making the username field hidden and filled in
with a predefined value..  I've discovered something "new" while doing hacks
of K2[cloning it to have 2 versions installed, K2 and K3, and making mods to
one].

Most Joomla applications use children of JTable classes to define MySQL
table structures.

One of the things that you can do when using this class, is add extra
validations in those tables themselves.

So Mark, I was completely offbase here on my suggestion.  After doing a
little extra digging, I find that in
libraries/joomla/database/table/user.php there is a function called "check"
starting at line 136 in the version of Joomla installed on a server I am
currently working with.

Lines 141-144 are the check on the users full name,
// Validate user information
if (trim( $this->name ) == '') {
 $this->setError( JText::_( 'Please enter your name.' ) );
return false;
 }

The positive of doing things in this manner is that instead of spreading
validations throughout the code in every place a user can be updated or
created, it is in one function and all those places can call it.

The downside is you are well and truly stuck in that you either HAVE to hack
the core code to remove this check OR you have to completely duplicate the
user module to fix this.

Note, there is a way to "hack" the core code without actually hacking it.
 Joomla is "smart" about including class definition files, when they are
included using the Joomla Loader, Joomla will first check to see if the
class exists, if it exists it won't load the file a second time.

As such, if you can setup Joomla in such a way as to "beat" the system to
including a class file and include your OWN version of the class file, you
can override/trick Joomla into using your file instead.  That's what I did
with the plugin to display HTML comments with the template filename before
and after every view template that is loaded as a way of tracking down which
templates are being used in my plugin:
http://gothaminformatics.com/our-extensions/corehack-debugging-plugin

It is a system plugin that has to be set to the very very top of the system
plugin loads, and it will grab the Joomla loader class file, dynamically
modify it with my code and save it to a temp directory, and then include it.
 Thus beating the system and getting there first[I did the whole dynamic
thing so if that file is changed in some way upon future upgrade, even with
the plugin enabled you would still be using the latest code... If you are
planning on running this /all/ the time as opposed to when debugging/testing
than you should save a copy of the user.php file above and use that instead
of dynamic hacking....  you could even include a subdirectory for every
version of joomla and include a version specific user.php table file, and if
there is no version specific file, then let Joomla use the base one and send
an email to the system admin to remind him that he needs to update the
plugin.]

At least, that is the way I would code it and set it up if I was being paid
to code such a plugin. :-)

Ease of use.  That's a reasonable investment if you create screencasts frequently and need them done quickly.  

Adobe CS *upgrade* is about $600, and it's a necessity for me to upgrade at least every other year, to be able to modify template graphics, to open files provided by clients, etc.

I just paid $195 for a template subscription for *one year*.

Can anyone suggest an extension that gives a schedule of events similar to this one at ESPN3 (http://espn.go.com/espn3/)?

Hi all,

 

Over the past couple of months I have been working to update the site for
the water advocacy group World Wide Rescue Foundation. The group is 10 years
old, responsible for the United Nations Decade of Water program and is
closely affiliated with Pete Seeger. (and yes - their old site hasn't been
updated for years). When we started the project we had no idea that it would
so timely.

 

The site is scheduled to beta launch on June 13th. It will be a central
resource for water advocacy, it contains JomSocial, 2K, Mosets tree, AV
Voice and additional functionality.  I am currently seeing someone with very
strong Joomla chops to help out on high level sys admin functions,
virtualization, deeper component integration, cloud hosting, etc. 

 

I am also looking for a coder with good SSL and templating skills for a
paying gig.

 

Please let me know if you are interested.

Hi Donna,
Thanks, I thought I'd reset my limit but I obviously didn't do something
right the first time. It's good now.
Thanks for taking the time to look the site over :)

http://www.alltogetherasawhole.org/profiles/blogs/are-we-hurting-our-clients

I find this an interesting discussion.  In the end I'm not so sure it is
hurting clients to support them on cruddy hosts, but I certainly find it
hurts /me/ in hours of time trying to figure out cruddy setups and such, or
a new interface, or anything else.

I've often felt like getting into the web hosting aspect simply to
consolidate things on one platform...something like 50$/month for website
space and support in an environment I choose and control so I don't have to
figure out all those oddball settings.

Roll it up as part of the delivery package so they get between 4 and 6
months free upon delivery.  After that, they either will appreciate the
service and want to continue, or they can joomlapack[erm Akeedo backup] the
website and move it.

I am busy building out my new platform.

I do not want to compete with low cost hosting, but want clients that 
need and appreciate stable platforms.
The trouble is many are driven by just price, not quality.

Very odd. I wasn't even near a computer this afternoon. At first I
thought my account might have been hacked, but then I remember my 2 yr
old was running around the house with the iphone. Now I have to go
through the sent mail to see who else I have emailed.

Hi

Home Page: needs evening out, seems to be a lot of empty space.

Our Story (and child pages): Organizational?Effectiveness box, title needs shortening to fit box. Why have a flash banner - top drop-down?menu disappears behind it.

Approach: Information at the top needs evening out, 3 columns?, or unnecessary as its on the front page in any case.

Services (and child pages): these pages look good - one point though, menu missing Transformation?Leadership page.

Results: Boxes on right hand side could probably be re-thought, no need for scroll bars and go too far down the page, makes the page look a bit unprofessional.

Ideas & Insights: Tab box and text overlapping at the top.

regards

Owain.
