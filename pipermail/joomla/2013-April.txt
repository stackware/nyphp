Hi everyone.

Not sure if we are all on the Yahoo Groups yet, so I posted to both lists.
I apologize if you are annoyed seeing this message twice.

I was looking over the products sold by iJoomla and was wondering if anyone
has any experiences using their products that would like to share? I'm
mostly interested in their iJoomla Ad Agency. Thanks!

Not sure if I'd say it is the "Best" but I do have a beta of Raptor 
working on Joomla 3.0 and hopefully can polish it up and release it soon.

It's more the "funnest" editor I've used in a while, because it gets rid 
of the clunky little menu bar on every edit box and instead moves all 
that functionality up to the top of the screen.  Whats really nice is 
that I find you can really "see" what your edits will look like using it 
because you can edit things in place.

Gary,

That sounds really cool. I would enjoy taking it for a spin some day. Is it
available for download somewhere?

Best,

Subject: [joomla] Where did the domain name go?
Message-ID: <1366026680.84687.YahooMailNeo@web122304.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

I am moving a joomla site to a new domain.? In the past,? I've used essentially these steps
http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?t=187461

Note the last step is to edit the config.php file in the site root folder and change the domain name.
The site I am trying to move is version 2.5.9...
but there is no domain name reference in the config file, and the site is not working
in its new location under the new domain name.....

Any idea where/how to change the domain name on the site?
Thanks!

Message-ID: <62CA4794F28F4BD393A22BB8658656CA@OwnerPC>

I just installed the RSForm Pro and not happy with the "look" of the forms.
RS Joomla does not provide adequate tutorials on how to do it.  

Anyone knows where I can find tutorials on how to customize the forms? 

 

 

Best regards,

Hi Marcos.

I don't know of any tutorials, but that would be a great idea!

Depending on what you want changed, some of it can be done with CSS. Select
Properties and there is an HTML layout to change that part of it. You can
put in CSS internal for the form, but most favor to put their CSS in an
external file.

Their technical support has been good, ask them questions if you get stuck
with things.

Hope this helps!

It's very simple to change the layout (under the Form's "Properties" tab, in Form Layout):? Where it says "Auto-Generate Layout", say "No" and replace the layout with your own.

Mark,
Thanks, 
I have the site working now, 
And, (as you probably know)
the $live_site parameter
doesn't need to be edited...

My problem was cockpit error (as these things usually are...)
Appreciate the input.


Janet
