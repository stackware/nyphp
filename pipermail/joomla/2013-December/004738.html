From: &quot;Unitel&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/joomla">unitelny at gmail.com</A>&gt;

No matter what I do I keep getting bogus SERP in google for unitel.biz.

Issue #1

Page title is correct. But in &quot;indented results&quot; I keep getting pages that
do not exist in website. Right know only the following page-links are
correct;

1. SL1100 - &gt;&gt; &quot;unitel.biz/products/nec/sl1100.html&quot; 
2. Ipitomy Telephones - &gt;&gt;
unitel.biz/products/ipitomy/ip-telephones.html 
3. IP PBX - &gt;&gt; unitel.biz/products/ipitomy/ip-pbx.html 
4. Q Manager -- &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unitel.biz/products/ipitomy/q-manager-acd.html 

So, out of ten entries only four are correct. 

There was a time -many months back but not more than a year ago - that the
indented links where correct

**********


What you have are obsolete indexed entries in the Google database
You can handle that in several ways


In Google Webmaster Tools you can have pages removed from the index
but ...
I wouldn't do that. You can use this to your advantage instead by either
making entries in your .htaccess file that redirect these entries to the correct landing page or
use SH404SEF from <A HREF="http://anything-digital.com">http://anything-digital.com</A> to redirect these to the correct page


Issue #2

There was a time -many months back but not more than a year ago - that the
indented links where correct and more importantly when I did a search with
key words relevant to my site my site did come up. And it was coming up on
the bottom half of the first SERP page, which I thought was pretty good for
a newbie like myself.

Now no matter what keywords or phrases I enter my site does not show. It
only comes up if I enter my domain name &quot;unitel.biz&quot; in the google search
area

Any idea whats going on??

Google is always making changes to the algorithm that serves up web pages.
And there are new web sites popping up all the time.
So your web site is floating in a seathing cauldron of web sites and Google has to decide from your search
what you are interested in seeing. They use many cues in their secret sauce. Some of those cues may be your own
past behavior. If you've searched for your site, seen results, and not clicked on them, Google may have surmised that you
are not interested in seeing that web site in the results.
Try using a service to keep track of your web page rankings for different keywords.
try: <A HREF="http://rankcheckerace.com">http://rankcheckerace.com</A>

Other factors that can affect your SERP position are:
click through rate - so make your meta description attractive or descriptive
social popularity - so make your content sharable (of value and social share buttons easily accessible)
proximity - more important for Local SEO
backlinks to web site - the original main factor for Google ranking

There is much more that goes in to SEO as well, some conjecture. It is always changing


That your web site came up high in the rankings when new is of note.
Google has stated that content freshness is an important ranking factor.
Although Google may have newsworthiness in mind, I suspect there is another factor that is unstated.
To get a feel for how a web site may do, they may throw new web sites up high in the SERPs to see how
they perform for CTR, and drop them down once they make an assessment of the site. Otherwise, if a new web site
was never seen, and CTR is a ranking factor, then new web sites would never get a high enough SERP position to ever
get any clicks.


My site is hosted by cloudaccess.net. Speaking with one of their support
people I was told the issue was with the google search engine and indexing.


Yes, and you can address it with one of the methods mentioned above.


He did fix an incorrect sitemap entry on their server


Sitemaps are unnecessary unless you have a JavaScript menu that the robots cannot read.
You might as well just use Webmaster Tools and request a crawl. 


 (my error) it had one
forward slash too many and suggested I go to google webmaster tool and erase
old site map and re-index, which I did. He tells me that cloudacces had and
still has exactly the same issue. 

Cheers,
Mark Simko
