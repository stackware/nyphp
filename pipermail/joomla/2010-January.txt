Message-ID: <330532b61001061618l23570958o95f1cc72a0a9c6f0@mail.gmail.com>

Hey gang,

I have a client with the most curious problem, and she's trying to
create a SuperAdmin account for me to look around. The second she hits
save however, the account gets deleted somehow. Trying to get around
this hurdle, I did the following:

1) Register for an account on the front end
2) Login (works)
3) Logout
4) Login (works)
5) Logout

She then goes into user manager in the admin and promotes my account
to Administrator or Super Administrator, and *poof* the account is
gone. Like, TOTALLY gone, not in the database, zilch, nada, nothing.

Anybody heard of something like this or have any idea how to make this
stop? I'm hoping it is just some silly plugin or something, but not
having access to the site makes it impossible for me to debug...

-- Mitch, hoping this is a simple setting that can be changed somewhere

I don't know but how about promoting the account via the database?  Just so you can get in.

I have no idea. I know it is Joomla 1.5, and as long as nobody
promotes me I can login and logout all I want to the front end. The
second she promotes my account - by using the Joomla User Manager OR
the Community Builder User Editor - BOOM! I'm outta here like the
spice girls.

That was the plan, however this is a production site and the fear is that by
changing the password their account would end up getting the axe, too.

I've never heard of anything like this before, and am hoping that it is CB
related (and therefore an easy fix).

Message-ID: <6142ad2c1001131601w74e8db32u85f4d1d52055b6b2@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone!!

I was checking my pendrive I got at JDay and found there's a version of
Server2Go in it. I'd like to understand how it works. I visited the
developer website, but the tutorial page didn't load at all.

Can anyone give me some hints? I tried to run it and all I got was an IE
screen telling it couldn't a page.

Thanx in advance!

We use for our training classes and would be happy to help.

However, we'll probably move away from it at some point this year because,
as you noticed, development stopped a couple of years ago now.

And to answer the actual question, leave Drupal for the gub'ment. Most 
developers develop arthritis and three career changes before the 
government actually fully buys into anything.

Small businesses are the numerically larger target, require less process 
to be implemented, and word of mouth marketing goes a long way. You also 
don't have quite so many regulations and IA audits to pass.

Once Linux World moved to Boston, the NYPHP crew seems to be the only

There was instructions distributed with the pen drive. I think there may
also be a txt file on it explaining it's use.

Server2go provides a web server for Windows, so first you run the .exe
on the thumb drive, and that provides the web server. php and mysql are
also provided.

Once the web server service has started, you can access the the served
web pages by opening a web browser and typing in 127.0.0.1:4000 or
localhost:4000. I'm not positive of the port number. It may be 4040
instead of 4000

On that thumb drive, I moved the phpmyadmin folder, but did not make the
changes to the http.conf file. The easiest fix is to move the phpmyadmin
folder from the htdocs folder back to the root folder.

You can add other cms systems to the drive if you like. If you'd like to
monkey with Drupal or modx, you can add those in folders under the
htdocs folder. You'll have to add databases for them using phpmyadmin.

Hey Steve!

Thank you. I didn't realize its development had stopped.

I just found XAMPP and it might be a solution for what I need. It's
multi-platform and I just have to find out if it's easy to run.

Yes - unfortunately. If you check the support forum, its had the full-on
spambot treatment.

Apparently the developer got sidetracked by another project, Symfony.

Thanks all for coming.  It was quite fun and enjoyable.

Sorry for my lackluster presentation on Sobi....I get better with time, I
promise.  And a special thanks to Forest for pulling my chesnuts out with
some incisive commentary on the features of Sobi I glossed over.

Looking forward to the next meeting.  Since we don't have the room early
next month, I'd ask if anyone has some advice on where to grab some chow
before the meeting?

I apologize for missing my first meeting :-(
The good news is I signed a client for 3 websites but he wanted to talk shop
and, well, I didn't get out of his office until almost 6 and I'm in NJ.
God Lord willing and the creek don't rise I'll be at next month's meeting.

So, I've been mucking around trying to find a decent template to give a try
to "release early, release often" for a friends website.

All the templates out there are too too too much.

On a lark, I used the default rhuk_mikyway template.

It's perfect.  Background and foreground color control, easy to setup, basic
function and extendable.

Perfect!


Now if only I could find a decent image editor like fireworks..

When you apply a Joomla patch, sometimes the default templates are overwritten and you lose any modifications you made to the template.

For the first time ever I decided to take a differente approach when
developing a new project in Joomla: I didn't install the template created to
the project yet. Thus, I started realizing how the ones that come bundled
deliver.

For my surprise, I noticed one huge flaw: titles are displayed differently
in blog style and article pages. I configure both CSS classes to display the
same, yet it never comes out looking really good. Why not use the same CSS
rule for all titles?

Did everyone enjoy the InstallFest as much as I did?

I think this was the best Joomla event I've attended.  It was the best of JUG meetings combined with the best of JoomlaDay.

Thanks to everyone who made this happen and everyone who attended.

Let's do it again soon!

Thank you to everyone for a great installfest today!!!  

Especially the mentors such as Donna, Mitch, Scott, Elin and Jon for presenting and assisting others!  I learned a ton myself as well!

Now, since we didn't get a chance to answer questions on the forums sign on to joomla.org now and visit the forums and help out...and those of you that know php...follow Mitch's lead and squash some bugs so 1.6 can come out sooner!

Special thanks to Oracle for giving us the amazing space, and Kim Marie as a great host!

Yes!!! I did enjoy the Install fest...I'd wish we had more newbie
events...just like they used to do with the Linux Install fests for
newbies...that's how I learned about the latest in the OS...too bad they
don't do it often now...lol

Message-ID: <4bffc351001190014wd481f52s735e2ee20338b107@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone know of a tool like:
http://colorschemedesigner.com/

Where you can actually get the css/html for the sample?

On that website, after you have your color pallet you can click on dark or
light example and it will give you a sample of what can be done with the
colors.  I'd like to be able to take the css/html that would be used to form
that page and save it.

So far...for the weird image my friend likes,
http://www.degraeve.com/color-palette/index.php seems to give me a good
initial selection of color choices..but I find it easier to have a program
distribute them on a page like the sample in color schemer.....and then
tweak slightly than to do it all myself.

I like iconico's color pic.  You can save various pallets and test the colors with different hues, etc.

Installfest was fantastic! I was a little concerned where I would fit in
when I signed up, but it was just as I had hoped! I learned a lot and at the
same time was able to help others.
I especially liked sharing experiences about different extensions. Someone
suggested an ExtensionFest in the future...great idea!
Thank you Laura and all the organizers and participants...it was great!

Subject: [joomla] IMIS authentication with Joomla
Message-ID: <C77C9048.5D90%kellir@nacm.org>

Does anyone know of an affordable solution for integrating IMIS with Joomla
so that you can have a single site login for access to members only type
pages. I have found a couple of solutions but they are in the 4-6k range.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Kelli

Subject: [joomla] Any K2 experts on the list?
Message-ID: <4bffc351001210311maeeaa5dt6842f305113aa2a5@mail.gmail.com>

Gah..  I'm wrapping up some K2 mods for a client.....coming into this
project in the middle...and I have a specsheet for a second round of
changes.

After going through it a second time...  I think a third of these changes
are for features K2 already supports and has built in!

So I'm wondering if we have any K2 experts on the list...

Things to consider:
K2 groups: restricting access to forms by cagtegory/user group for viewing
AND for adding
K2 Forms: adding new sets of forms to K2


I mean... I can hack my way through it and figure it out in the end.  But
I'm thinking this would be better served by a training session on the power
of K2 specifically geared for them.

Note: training may require a trip to the Duchess area to go onsite for the
day, so anyone open to that?

Subject: [joomla] Oddball tool recomendations
Message-ID: <4bffc351001210331j23463b16hbc23514bbf339906@mail.gmail.com>

First off, thanks to everyone for the image colorscheme recomendations.
None of them provide precisely what I'm looking for, but there was a lot of
interesting tools I hadn't looked at before, and I think with my wife's help
I'm getting closer to understanding theming.


Second off, I thought I'd throw out a couple oddball tools of my own I've
started using.

The first, and most important, is Evernote:
https://www.evernote.com

Now, I've seen a lot of tools like this one's bookmarklet before, where you
can hit the bookmarklet and your data goes up and is stored on the server
along with the url.  So, nothing new here[very basic fieldset: notebook to
put it in, some text on the note, some tags, a title, and an option to take
a snapshot of the page).

But what I like about evernote is that it has an actual CLIENT for offline
use.  They have a client for the Mac, for Windows, and for my G1 Android
phone.  And they have a powerful API so the few things I want it to do but
can't, I can probably code myself!

So all my notes are not only organized on the web, they get synced to my
laptop, my wifes laptop[a mac and a pc] and my phone.


Now, give it a few months and I'll see if IO'm really organizing things or
just stuffing them all in the evernote closet.



The second tool I'm not as gung ho on at the moment, mainly because they
promised an API over a year ago and have yet to deliver.  That one is Reqall
[http://www.reqall.com]

It's a task scheduling/calendar app with a decent set of bells and
whistles.  Integrates to your Google Calendar....can search through your
evernote trove of files and show you documents related to keywords in your
task...can send you reminders by instant message, sms, email, etc.  You can
add/change/interrogate it by instant message.  You can call in a
note/reminder and it will transcribe it into text.  All in all....pretty
good.  I think if they had the same app they have for the IPhone for the G1
I'd be hooked[a GPS aware scheduler, so when your at the grocery store
getting milk, it can remind you to pick up your RX from the pharmacy in the
same plaza]

And for the guy looking for something to do with his freetime...as for
ideas, combine evernote with reqall and add a few extra features and I think
that could be a killer app. :-)

Define affordable....

I see here that they have a PHP toolkit,
http://www.imiscommunity.com/php_toolkit_talked_about_at_innovations so it
should be childsl play to create an authentication plugin based on the
gmail/openid/whatnot plug ins so that Joomla users would use their IMIS
passwords to log on.

However, at the same time it seems to be wrapped up in some specific project
so getting it might be difficult.

However, there is what looks to be an open source Drupal module,
http://drupal.org/project/imis_auth for doing that - so it would be possible
to lift the code from one to place it in the other.

Basically, I see more time spent going through the drupal module code and
setting up FTP and testing environments, than the time that would be spent
actually coding the plugin for Joomla..

That could be...1 hour....it could be 3 days...it all depends on how
organized you are with all the data at your fingertips and just needing a
nudge, to having to ask 50 questions to get ftp, test account, etc before
finally writing the 3-4 lines of code needed.

Subject: [joomla] K2, what where they thinking?
Message-ID: <4bffc351001240755pd6c313he9f26dd8741451bc@mail.gmail.com>

Doing things differently for the sake of different is silly.

They have some really nice clean code there.

Then they do weird things like use an MVC framework for 80% of the code, and
then one vital function which if they had used MVC could be easily adjusted
with a template override, they stick the html output in the controller.....

Their field definitions are very basic...no harm there, but WHY do their own
coding?  Joomla already has a built in set of field definitions that are
much richer, why code your own when you have it sitting right there to use?

Oh well....  I feel like by this time in a week and half I'll have the K2
system I want.....    but then what to do with all those hacks?

Message-ID: <329fadf41001241318v63f1fb47k21a8832ba67eefbb@mail.gmail.com>

Though I am not as familiar with the plumbing details, I have to say I am a
bit torn over K2 and most all of the other new "CCK" (content creation kit)
solutions, as well as some of the old directory solutions now "re-branded"
as CCK.

The biggest missed opportunity to me with with having the ability to create
new content types is the seemingly obvious capability to also define new
organizational models, specifically multi-categorization which all of the
new solutions miss. Both, having more than two levels (e.g. section and
category in joomla core) for each content type, as well as the ability to
have one piece of content appear in more than a single category. This is
already possible with the major directory extentions (Sobi2, Moset tree) for
listings, but it is dead on arrival in all of the CCK solutions except for
one, which happens to be the only ioncube ecrypted and of course commercial
solution (Mighty Extensions Resources). ME Resources is actually really good
for exactly this, but you are stuck with there environment for most every
thing else (community, media, listings, comments, etc.). I have heard that
sobi2 could be tuned to publish articles, but just as ME Resources, if you
go that route you are restricted from using the wealth of com_content based
modules and plugins looking for joomla core sections and categories.

I have heard different things about what to expect in J1.6, some of which
says it will natively handle multi-mapping (improve on the current one
content, one category model) and support category nesting (sub-categories),
but I have a feeling it may just be the later.

If anyone knows of any other solution/hacks for multi-categorization of
joomla com_content articles (Jseblod cck is close, but no multi-mapping),
please point me to it.

Thanks.

My perspective is completely different.  I think that this solution already
exists for almost all of them, including regular old Joomla content.

A complex many to many categorization system is best done via tags.  You can
setup a tag system where only you get to create the tags, and only your
authors can pick them.

You can do multi-levle cagtegorization by borrowing a simple trick off of
venerable old Lotus Notes and name your tags
<category><seperator><sub-category>

For example:
Apparel\Shirts\Fancy
Appare\Shirts\muscle

Then it's just a matter of a few modules and display layouts to explode the
tags.


For my own personal use, I tend towards the following section/category
structure:

Ideas\Site
Ideas\Articles
Ideas\Blog
Ideas\Pages

then

Draft\Site
Draft\Articels
Draft\Blog
Draft\Pages

to

Ready\Site
Ready\Articles
Ready\Blog
Ready\Pages

and then someday

Archived\Site
Archived\Articles
Archived\Blog
Archived\Pages


Where Site is for articles about the company or site.
Articles is for general informational stuff
Blogs is for "blog" style articles
And Pages is for static pages


The benefit of this system is that you can setup your search plugins so they
only index ready and archive items.  While you can still "publish" ideas and
drafts and send direct links to others to solict feedback without having to
give them an account on your site.

Message-ID: <4bffc351001250552s200aa4f2j568001f6b55ac7ef@mail.gmail.com>

Been using Chrome for about 4 days.

Ok, there is a LOT I hate about it.  It's too small and compact and harder
to read.  Or it's too big and sprawling and pages go off my screen!

BUT, it is FAST.  Blazingly fast.

I finally gave it a try when I was helping a friend tune up her daughters
netbook because it was slow, and I had to go to a website.  I opened both
Chrome and Firefox at the same time and Chrome zipped open and loaded it's
page....Firefox.....draggggggged.

Sometimes speed is good.

I ESPECIALLY like to use chrome for Joomla backend admin.  Even if I decide
I can't stand the interface, I'll still keep it for that because it is much
zippier.

I had the same feeling when I first started using it. But after a few months it did eventually slow down. I also found that Chrome doesn't handle multiple tabs as well as Firefox. Yes, if one crashes, then it's just that one, but that really doesn't happen that often for me on Firefox. If I remember correctly, after spending a lot of time in one tab on Chrome, when you tried to return to another, it was blank and took a really long time to come back. Very annoying! And last thing, some sites weren't showing properly. So I went back to using Firefox. Keep in mind though I use bookmarks extensively so I don't know if that's what's slowing down both browsers. Besides that and the fact I always open up many tabs, I can't think of why it slowed down. I keep running virus and malware scans and nothing. Oh well, good luck!

Subject: [joomla] Chrome: wow...just.....wow

Been using Chrome for about 4 days.

Ok, there is a LOT I hate about it.  It's too small and compact and harder to read.  Or it's too big and sprawling and pages go off my screen!

BUT, it is FAST.  Blazingly fast.

I finally gave it a try when I was helping a friend tune up her daughters netbook because it was slow, and I had to go to a website.  I opened both Chrome and Firefox at the same time and Chrome zipped open and loaded it's page....Firefox.....draggggggged.

Sometimes speed is good.

I ESPECIALLY like to use chrome for Joomla backend admin.  Even if I decide I can't stand the interface, I'll still keep it for that because it is much zippier.

I've been using Chrome since it was released. While it does have
trouble rendering a few sites, they are few and far between. I've
never experienced a tab issue. I've never experienced a slow down. I
open it first in the morning and close it last at night (if I close it
at all). Firefox, on the other hand, I have to close several times
throughout the day to free up the memory it uses (I used to think
Outlook was a memory hog, but Firefox blows it right out of the
water). If I don't, Firefox will usually crash (which takes care of
freeing up the memory for me and takes all of the tabs with it).

My only complaint about Chrome right now is that the Firebug extension
isn't as good as the Firefox one. Yet.

There's no reason a browser should need 750mb of RAM. Ever. Besides,
my PC at work is already maxed out. It also likes to max out one of my
four processor cores. Should I just add more of those, too?

Right now I have 10 Chrome processes running. They're using up about
235mb of RAM right now. Firefox, with one tab open, is using more.
(Although as I type this I clicked on Firefox to check the tab count
and see that it has since dropped. Maybe consuming RAM is Firefox's
way of saying it wants you to pay more attention to it.)

I strongly suspect that at the end of the next few weeks I will go back to
Firefox as I am a creature of habit and I LIKE Firefox.   My recollection is
that I moved from Firefox to Opera because of the tab function which was
important enough for me to switch.  Once Firefox got a tab function, I moved
back.

Chrome is fast.....  and I will use it for when I need speed[backend admin,
quickly checking a page, etc] but I'm just not sure I can make it my main
browser yet.

Firebug is a BIG complaint.  The other one is I just /like/ the way Firefox
looks.

This Joomla website: http://www.huntingforacure.info/

It is not pretty...but then I didn't pick the colors, nor solicit for
donations...and I'm having a little trouble figuring out what they want to
do to put up content.

I'll be using K2 for the "guestbook" soon...and then I need to figure out
how they can prepost things for the auction[probably just content].


This website has been one of the LEAST fun things I've ever done.  I hate it
with a passion.  But that's because it is a memorial/fundraising website for
my oldest brother, John, who passed away last November from lung cancer.

John was, quite simply, one of the best people on the face of the earth.  We
had VAST differences in political and religious views, but he never
dismissed another person's views - nor pushed his own - and he was always
very good at listening to your problem and giving advice[and by listen, I
don't mean the 'listen to poke holes where he disagrees'....but rather to
LISTEN and look a things from your point of view].

At his wake, my sister in laws sisters apparently tried to keep track of the
number of people who came to pay their respects...but they gave up when the
number went over 500....  People waited in line...out the door in the rain
to come through and pay their respects....One of the longest, most tediously
dreadful things I've ever gone through....and yet still it makes me glad to
know how many people loved John and came out to honor him.

In any case... as you can tell, I have great difficult not going on and on
about my favorite brother......so I'll close it there.

Message-ID: <329fadf41001251111i773c52cer1e6164c987c424ba@mail.gmail.com>

hey Gary, thanks for your response. I hear what you are saying that using
tags is a way to go. A tag solution was my first approach, but I could find
no way to create tag menu items (to mimic sec/cat) for addressable tag
labled article lists/layouts. Do you know of a solution/technique to do
this?

Plus, all of the cool news article layout modules (JXTC/Gavick News Pro,
etc.) all only supported (as in "loodked for") joomla sec/cat, with the
exception of RokNews which could also support k2 elements. I am sure there
is probably a way to do this by combining alot of the techniques mentioned,
but it just seems to me that when creating a new CCK capability it is a
missed opportunity to not also improve and make an easy way to handle
complex categorization, especially since it has been accomplished with the
directory/listing solutions.

Obviously I am not an extension developer and there could be very good
reasons why noone except one develper has attempted it, but it sure would be
nice. :-)

Umm.....  I copy the code for article list/layouts and make a quick tag
display function. Probably not the answer your looking for. :-)

Well...my own thinking is that no one is EVER happy with one way of doing
layouts, so I always end up having to tweak it anyway at the end of which I
have a small bit of custom code for a specific situation.

As such, going through the effort of packaging it up with an XML file,
zipping it, posting it, begging Joomla Extensions to list it...... and to
get only 1 person giving you feedback if your lucky?  Not worth the time.

And I don't see any commercial value to it... I mean I can't imagine anyone
paying even 3 bucks for such a thing...let alone the 5 bucks I see as the
minimum payment to make setting up a payment system worthwhile.

Would you pay 5 bucks for it?  :-)

What I see is that there is an obsession over having a "better"
section/category system but in the end the one we have is quite adequette,
what we need instead is a decent, built in tagging system.  And a decent
built in comment system.  And a decent built in message queue system.  And a
decent built in Cache system.

In order of priority, I'd say tags, comments, than either caching or
messages.

I tried Chrome just last weekend, and found it ugly and clunky. I find
Firefox a memory hog (even with a clean .firefox/.mozilla folder) and
it takes forever to load. Safari fires up wicked fast and just feels
"right".

I suppose I am a creature of habit as well but I would be actively
looking for a replacement if I found Safari that lacking, and I really
don't. I use Firefox for those companies who were stupid enough to
hire 13 year olds for their corporate sites - banks, I'm looking at
YOU - and their insipid "sorry you have to use IE or Firefox or our
crummy little $15 website won't work" error popups.

Actually really digging the HTML5 stuff that is starting to pop up out
there, especially on Safari.

I use extensions.  Last time I checked, Safari didn't have a massive
database of extensions like Firefox and Chrome do.

However, even that said, the last time I seriously used Safari was over a
year and a half ago when I used windows.  Safari for Windows was
just...brilliant...  At the time I'd use Safari as my personal browser, and
Firefox for it's web developer features.

However, when I started using a Mac I found Safari clunky, weird, and
odd...  it's like for Windows they took the best of interfaces for both
Operating systems and created a gem...  For Mac it's....clunky.

Oh, and for websites I am going into the admin tool on a weekly basis... I
tend to use any browser I don't normally use.  IE I keep Opera around just
for admin work.  By using a completely separate browser for admin as I use
for personal use, I avoid any cross site scripting attacks[if I never log IN
to the admin site in my personal browser, than nothing can hijack that
logon].

Subject: [joomla] PHP IDE
Message-ID: <4bffc351001271022q6b852758k3b689db3e110ec92@mail.gmail.com>

I'm curious how many of you are using an IDE these days and which ones you
favor?

For the longest time, I used Komodo IDE and it was great.  Then they had a
big leap to version 5.2 and the benefits of 5.2 outweighed losing the IDE,
so I switched over to Komodo edit[free] with the idea that if projects ever
take off I'll upgrade again.

I've tried Eclipse....hated it.  Clunky and junky - made for Java developers
by Java developers.

I've used the UltraEdit IDE and it is fantastic, but the IDE is windows
only.  I want cross platform these days.

I recently took a look at the latest feature set in NetBeans and it's
looking very very attractive.

Any thoughts?

I just had a great discussion about PHP IDE's with some of my team mates at
NinjaForge. I think PhpEd from NuShpere is the best I've used on the Windows
platform. It has pretty much all the features you need for efficient PHP
development. I created a basic tutorial on setting it up for Joomla
development and they published it to their site, I believe it's still there.
The tutorial is for Joomla 1.0.x but the same idea applies for Joomla 1.5.x
development with PhpEd.

I highly recommend taking it for a test drive, and even purchasing it. It
has saved me countless hours and is a worthy investment for the serious PHP
developer.

Depends on the OS for me. I left windows behind in the previous
millennium and don't go there anymore. For OSX, I hop back and forth
between Netbeans and eclipse/PDF for project work, and use Smultron or
vim for quick edits. On linux, I usually gravitate to KDE and a mix of
Quanta+ and Kate, but have tried Aptana and eclipse/PDT as well with
mixed results based on linux distro and version.

I had a college team of undergrads do some research on a few IDEs for me. I forgot which ones they reviewed but they ended up selecting NetBeans and received compliments from one of the tech professors on their choice. So I'll be trying that next. I had Eclipse installed but haven't played with it enough to give a good critique.

Cross platform is a high priority for me.  I use both Mac and Windows and
don't want to switch gears between them.

Linux is a nice to have.

I'm using MAMP to work on my Joomla sites locally. After I upload the files to the server, I can't see anything. It comes up with a page referring to the mysql.
How do I fix this?

Most of the Joomla Template clubs are no longer supporting IE6, but
now that you can throw Google into the ring, that pretty much settles
it for me.

Subject: [joomla] LAMP server setup
Message-ID: <4bffc351001301326g3048aad4gf68c81fce204dbb0@mail.gmail.com>

Generally, I don't have a choice of webhosts, it's whatever the client has
already signed up for...so it goes.

But because of that, and my rusty LAMP server skills, I'm a little behind on
"ideals".

So...presuming you get to control the server environment, and we're using
Linux.  What is the ideal way to configure your server so that:
The web server can read/write/edit files for the virtual host joomla is
being installed on
Multiple users can ssh/ftp to the server and read/write/edit files[including
ones created by each other and the webserver] for that virtual host[and can
edit any files the web server created]

AND
you can have a second virtual host that the web server can read/write/edit
files in and other users can as well but programs in the first virtual host
can't be run by the server and edit files in the second one.


The first part tends to be easy to setup, but since it's always either been
no decision, or a dedicated host where all users can edit the files, I'm
unsure how one goes about that.

First up, does the server have some sort of control panel like Plesk,
cPanel or whatnot?

Second, what is the base OS? I'd do things differently on Debian vs. CentOS...

Not a specific server, just looking for general ideas.

Gawd I hope it doesn't have a control panel.  I hate those things with a
passion.

hope to hear more from others too. I'm definitely headed that  
direction. i think it's great to see the big corps going that way too.  
now developers can explain why and point to YouTube google and the  
rest. I'll be sure
to offer ie6 support as an extra cost to a client. but I still  
encounter clients who run ie6 and of couse know little of browser  
world in 2010.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by the second virtual host not having 
access to run programs on the first virtual host. Do you mean that the 
second virtual host's web server running joomla should not have access 
to the files in the first, but the first should have access to the 
second? If so, then you might be able to get away with creating a 
symlink to the second virtual host's joomla content directory. Place 
that symlink under the first virtual host's <joomladir>/images/stories 
directory. What you would end up with is the second virtual host's 
content accessible as a subdirectory under the first, but not the other 
way around.

This is only secure for users on the "front" web facing content 
management end. For users who have access to upload scripts executable, 
it's a security "game over". They have access to everything the web 
server does for for all directories and virtual hosts managed by that 
web server (eg. upload a "php shell" script).

I will recommend Red Hat/CentOS for package management and general ease 
of finding server assistance. However, if you're familiar with another 
distro, use that. Ease of use is the name of that game.

To answer the "second virtual" question, you don't. You run a second 
Apache instance on the machine and redirect to a different port or IP. 
Generally the latter. The issue is that one Apache instance runs as the 
same user and has write rights to both directories. So unless you can 
use authentication to limit what the web pages serve and thus what they 
can edit, the Apache process can do either.

I avoid centos like the plague.  CentOS uses PHP5.1 as their v5 package,
which has just enough bugs and oddities in it as to be not worth using.
 There are a couple other oddities with CentOS and it's default repositories
that I have run into that I just avoid it entirely.  While I can[and often
do] compile PHP 5.2 and the latest MySQL on CentOS by hand[after having
taken on a project, and been told the server was all configured and then
discovered their using CentOS and did not realize that when I asked for
PHP5.2, I /meant/ 5.2 and not 5.1] I don't recommend it.

My own unix distro recommendations are as follows:
Debian for servers if you are familiar enough with server management to
figure things out
Ubuntu for servers if you expect to need some help from time to time and
want to be able to use a GUI on the server[I find Ubuntu to be an easier GUI
to learn, and you can setup VNC to remotely invoke and run the GUI so you
can manage things from a "desktop"]

It is also slightly easier and cheaper to find people willing to do
consulting admin for Ubuntu than Debian.

Fedora is you are a windows shop, are setting up a server you will have
physical access to, and want an interface that is easiest to learn going
from windows to Linux.

CentOS if you want a more secure linux setup, as the reason they are
versions behind in most of their packages is they only place trusted,
reviewed, and approved packages in their repositories.  CentOS is great for
the corporate environment willing to pay to have an outside consultant come
in and troubleshoot/tweak as needed[just get someone reputable who isn't
going to just add some untrusted repository to the list of repositories,
thus blowing away one of the reasons for using it in the first place!]

Both suPHP and suExec are solutions to this problem.  They do, however, also
introduce additional oddities and such based on their configuration.

For example, suPHP in some configurations will refuse, entirely, to serve
any file that is world writable or world readable or a directory that is
such.  Wheras many extensions have instructions to make the directory that
uploaded images will be stored in permission 777 which stops working.

Suexec has added issues with making sure that the "jail" includes access to
the PHP libraries..and if you plan on installing additional PEAR libraries
that area as well.

In addition, both of the solutions "recipes" generally include the idea that
you will have 1 user per virtual host.  So while the web server and the
primary user can then both read/write files in the virtual host, if you add
additional ftp users for a virtual host I am fuzzy on how to make it so that
a group of users can all edit files for the same virtual host[another
frequent issue I run into is when someone creates an additional FTP account
for me on their virtual host.... I can add files to the server, but then if
any of them need to also be edited by the server...for example configuration
files... there is a problem.]
