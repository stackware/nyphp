Message-ID: <20050419004856.GA2898@leitz>

Okay, so the admin interface still hangs with Mozilla. Wouldn't be an issue except that I use Linux and Firefox/Mozilla are the browsers of choice. Konquere has trouble with sliding bars, My wife's Safari has ssue with the HTML editing, and I really don't want to have to use a Windows machine connected to the internet. 

Any thoughts? ANything I can try to tweak to make it work on the javascript stuff?

ciao!

I know that firefox on the mac works fine, you may need to use a
different WYSIWYG editor though.

I have a client that works with Mambo on the mac, I can ask them to
see what their experience is.

For the record, our previous project leader lived on his mac, so I am
certain that mambo works with the mac.

Firefox definitely works with htmlarea3 and tinymce and wysiwygpro. 
There is also an old version of mozilla hanging around that will allow 
you to run in os9 on a mac.

Safari won't run any of the wysiwyg editors.

Subject: [mambo] slow mambo 4.5.2 possible solution
Message-ID: <352c93420504240522518fa5c1@mail.gmail.com>

Maybe this is a solution for the slow mambo loading, i spent a few
days trying to solve this problem.
First of all i turned of all the mambo admin modules and turned
caching on, like it tells me in the forums.
This brought back the loading time from about 4 minutes to 1. After
this i tried a lot of stuff, optimizing mysql server configuration,
cleaning all unused files etc with no noticable difference in speed.
In the end what solved my problem was to turn KeepAlive in httpd.conf
to on, now the sites and the administration load in seconds.
I havent yet tried turning the admin modules backon to see if
keepalive is the main culprit.

Hope it helps a few other people using mambo 4.5.2
regards,
D. Salemink

Message-ID: <426BCB58.8040707@nuthinwerked.com>

 From the Apache documentation 
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#keepalive):

    The Keep-Alive extension to HTTP/1.0 and the persistent connection
    feature of HTTP/1.1 provide long-lived HTTP sessions which allow
    multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP connection. In some
    cases this has been shown to result in an almost 50% speedup in
    latency times for HTML documents with many images. To enable
    Keep-Alive connections, set |KeepAlive On|.

    For HTTP/1.0 clients, Keep-Alive connections will only be used if
    they are specifically requested by a client. In addition, a
    Keep-Alive connection with an HTTP/1.0 client can only be used when
    the length of the content is known in advance. This implies that
    dynamic content such as CGI output, SSI pages, and server-generated
    directory listings will generally not use Keep-Alive connections to
    HTTP/1.0 clients. For HTTP/1.1 clients, persistent connections are
    the default unless otherwise specified. If the client requests it,
    chunked encoding will be used in order to send content of unknown
    length over persistent connections.

Has anyone used webedition CMS?  My boss just got a flyer from this

a while now. He feels that this will get us a CMS without the hassle of 
customization.  I feel it would be taking a step back. Let me know the

to demonstrate it to him.  I rather use the money for a couple of Zend

backwards or sideways, you would have the same set-up/customization as 
mambo and a healthy learning curve on top of that.

John, 

You could spen the money that you are saving from buying a CMS to pay a 
company or consultant to do the customization. 

I know of a great company with some excellant programmers and designers on 
staf :)

I think your going to get more out of mambo for cheaper in the long run. 

1. You will get all the open free components and modules that people activly 
contribute

2. you will get free upgrades as the product continues to grow and mature. 

3. More importantly you will be using a product that is very popular among 
web professionals so you will easily be able to find new employees with 
mambo experience, free technical support from user forums and user groups, 
and extensive online documentation that will only continue to grow.

Also when selling mambo to the boss you might mention some of the industry 
recognition it has received. I haven't been keeping up but it seems like the 
awards are just stacking up.

I say the clear choice is mambo..

This is not a troll.
I have been wondering why.
The were the only out of the box CMS at those LinuxWorlds.

I have tried a few cms projects, and prefer Drupal and Geeklaw.  
The biggest things that bothers me about Mambo are the browser
compatibility issues.

These issues include lockup of the admin pages when using Mozilla or
Firefox, and compatibility of their editor with Opera and the Mac
browsers.

Since I am in Linux most of the time, I need a CMS that works with
Mozilla.

The Zope Corporation was in Boston with us, so there were two FOSS CMS
there. Also I know there were some commercial ones, but I don't pay
much attention to them anymore for some reason ;-)

Don't forget Plone. Thanks to their environment, they can do stuff
that the rest of us still cannot. But the gap is closing fast ;-)

I am an exclusive Firefox user, on both Windows and Linux, and we also
have developers that work on the Mac platform dedicated. I'd love to
hear your exact problems, in a way that I know I can reproduce them,
as I guarantee that they will get fixed by the next release.

Really, honestly, if you can prove there is a compatibility issue, and
give us instructions on how to reproduce, we will fix it.

I don't put them in the same category as the other cms projects I
mentioned.  They require much more work to make a real system out of the
box.

I looked at Plome.  A few years ago Plome had a bunch of requirements
that made it difficult to install.

I don't have experience with the incompatibility myself, but there are
users complaining in this list almost weekly that the Mambo admin screen
is locking up under Mozilla.  If I am mistaken, please accept my
apology.

Again it is only what I read, but is there a problem with different
browsers and the edit used by Mambo?

I do but I'm not sure where the incompatibility it and what is causing it. The two things I've hit are some editor issues on Mac OS X which I believe are elimininated by not using one of the editors, and the admin interface hanging which I've not yet resolved.

I think it is less "users complaining almost weekly" and more "one user whining incessantly". ;) I've been meaning to track down exactly what the issues are life and job-hunting have gotten in the way.

ciao!

On the subject of compatibility, yet another of the core developers
has just bought a dual G5, and that is our graphics guru. So if there
are any warts on the Macintosh side, I suspect I will be hearing all
about it on IRC...

With the solid support on firefox (I have never had a problem with
firefox and mambo, on ANY platform), it is hard for me to believe that
Mozilla is a significant issue. I'll install it myself and test from
time to time to make sure, but I would wager that most Mozilla issues
are either version-related, or tied to the implementation on a
particular platform.

Basically, I need:
* operating system version
* browser version
* exact step that causes the glitch

I'll file the bug reports myself even, but I need those three things
in order to reproduce.

Working on that very thing. At the moment is seems that if the admin interface chokes on writing the config file it can't recover well. "Choking" caused by a permission issue.

I'm not sure this is Mozilla specific, but I'm not sure why it can't recover. Mitch, can you try to duplicate that part? Meanwhile I'm going to call my hosting provider and see why Mambo and php are now changing everything they write to the apache user which means I can't edit my own files!

I do *not* see that last bit as a Mambo issue, though it will cause Mambo to have issues, I bet.

ciao!
