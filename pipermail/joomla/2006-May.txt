Woah, this is very weird.

I sent this email on 11/20/05 and it's just now being posted to the  
list?  Weird.

Hey better late than never!

We're doing some spring cleaning and there was apparently a queue problem.
Well, hope the problem was resolved...:)

Hi Folks,

Trying to determine if Globodigital's Support Center component for Joomla is
rock steady.  (not like breakin', like "solid as a...").

It's very reasonably priced for the feature set it offers, but I want to be
sure and the trial I downloaded is not installing properly.  Corrupted
files.  I tried both normal browse / upload / install, and "from a
directory.  

Anyone had experience with this? I could really use it on an upcoming job.

Joel.
