I have a client that has been regularly adding articles from the front end .
All of a sudden,  the save and cancel buttons disappear from the text editor
(JCE) in IE8. It doesn't happen in Firefox. When the editor first loads, i
see it, but then it disappeared.
Any thoughts?

Message-ID: <9ACD2396-D054-4F9E-8ACC-1EDBA17BB2C4@gmail.com>

In Joomla, is there a way to be able to change the article title  
style? For example, using Joomla for a blog...

First Blog Entry Title (color of text orange, font Times)

Second Blog Entry Title (color of text green, font Courier)

I know a template would make this static, but how could this be done  
to be user selectable? Is there a way to easily select from several  
templates to do this? Thanks!

I'm interested in talking with people who have:
1)an in-depth understanding of the differences between community builder and jomsocial, the limits of both extensions, and how they can be customized 
2)a strong programming background and an understanding of custom extension development
At this point, I am looking for a (paid) consultation to assist with site planning. May lead to custom development work.

If you did a template over ride for com_content in your html folder in your template. You could probably come up with a short foreach loop or something to give one class to the first  instance of title and than a different class to the rest. 

That is how you would have to do it. 

as for "selectable", you could hard code the classes in the template and  use something to select different CSS files. 

I forget the name, but there was a component that would let you select different CSS files to be included for your  different menu items. 

that might work.

Well, neither integrate directly with Joomla, but either
http://fudforum.org/forum/ FUDforum for complete control

or Google Apps[educational groups and non profits can use their advanced 
service for free], which includes google groups under your own 
domain/control which has all the forum functions you could desire.

Hi Everyone,

Is there a consensus on the best shopping cart to use with Joomla? I'm
quoting a specialty clothing site with lots of SKUs (style, size, color).

Pro ans cons would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

A lot of Joomla consultants are gravitating towards Tienda lately.

I have found it is a really good place to find developers in other countries how will work for cheap. 

Not really recommended for most projects atleast for what I normally work on.

I have used Joomlancers for 2-3 years and have established a great
relationship with one team of developers.

In addition to finding good developers, in places that credit card or paypal
payments to offshore developers is problematic, such as Vietnam,  the
Joomlancers escrow system is reliable.

Hi,

I'm trying to decide whether to set up PHP as a CGI for a server to host 
multiple instances of Joomla.

According to Joomla docs, CGI appears to get a nod due to better 
security. But  the docs don't recommend one or the other.

For PHP as CGI, are there implications  for SEF URL rewriting? For one 
thing,  .htaccess won't work.

Are there other considerations?

thanks,

Looks like the maker went out of business and now someone else has their

I can find download sites with it, but I'm leery of their 
legitimacy......   It's great to setup multiple chrome profiles, so I 
can run a "user", an "anonymous user" and an "admin" account and view 
them all at the same time.

	more" link?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikzzJ+4cf+akP5vrcBF+A4X3Wg3fKBNAqLfr_gs@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, sorry for the cryptic title.

I have a client site running on Joomla 1.5.22, www.koreanamericanstory.org.

We've noticed that although the main menu on right appears as expected
when viewing either via blog view of category, or article view, it
doesn't appear when clicking the "read more" link on a module
displaying the article on the homepage

The menu module itself is configured as in attached screenshot.

I haven't yet tested Advanced Module Manager, it may well be that when
configured this issue would be resolved, the current config is rather
kludgy.  However, any idea whether it is possible to configure a
module to always appear, except for the homepage?  Having written this
email, I have pretty much answered my own question... install and
configure advanced module manager, but I'd be interested in comments
regardless.

Message-ID: <4D7EBC8B.1010907@gmail.com>

When configuring a module to display on specific pages, the issue is one 
of menu's.   Modules are configured for pages by using the menu, a menu 
has an "itemid" assigned to it[you can see this in the url when SEF is 
not enabled].  Joomla checks the itemid to see what page it is on and 
thus displays the modules.

When someone clicks the "read more" link they bypass the menu...if that 
specific article is not on the menu's, there is no itemid and thus no 
way for Joomla to display the module.


There are a number of ways to do what you want,  in this case it is 
fairly easy.  You wish to only display a module if it is not the homepage.

You could create 2 Joomla Templates, one for the front page and one for 
everything else[the default].  Publish the module to a module position 
which is only on the default template, then assign the front page 
template to the homepage[which does have a menu link].


So your normal template would have 2 sidebar position: LeftFrontpage and 
LeftDefault stacked on top of each other.  You publish modules that 
should not appear on the frontpage to LeftDefault, and modules that go 
to each to LeftFrontpage.

You could also have a single template where you check to see if the 
program is on the frontpage and if so, don't load the module position 
LeftDefault.


What you can't do, out of the box, is assign a /not/ statement...so you 
can't say "Publish this module if the page is NOT...."....   which is 
why you have to work around that limitation in some way.

You can check out Modules Anywhere by NoNumber, Pete makes very well coded
extensions and Modules Anywhere should do what you want to do.

Message-ID: <135122.23069.qm@web35601.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Does anyone know of a pre-existing component that lets user submit a form 
requesting a quote, and when admin reviews the request, can turn the quote into 
an invoice?

I looked around the extensions directory and the closest I got was VM + ccVAOM. 
 Which would work if I were using 1.5.  This site needs the ACL of 1.6.

TIA.

Nothing that is 1.6, JAccounts is the closest thing.

Fantastic.  Maybe I can modify it to work with 1.6.  Somehow I missed that one 
when looking through the thousands of extensions!

Hello everyone

I want to ask you what's your opinion on the subject line of this message.

Do you get feedback from your clients telling you that their businesses grew
a certain amount AFTER they switched to Joomla?

If so, was it because of Joomla itself or any action you suggested your
clients to use?

Thanks in advance!

Many thanks @Herb and @Gary, both were excellent suggestions.  I did
end up going with advanced module manager instead, and the below
solution instead, as we will later begin using it for displaying
section submenus anyway
http://www.nonumber.nl/component/kunena/4-advanced-module-manager/9825-only-publish-on-home-page

Gary's explanation was particularly helpful, I didn't realize what was
going on behind the scenes with menuids until now.

Subject: [joomla] JOB: Project Manager at PICnet
Message-ID: <C9AE3FC5.7173%cozimek@picnet.net>

Hi Joomla friends,

The PICnet penguins are looking to add another ** project manager ** to our
team!  Please feel free to forward on to all those you think would be
interested.

Details below and at http://www.picnet.net/about-us/jobs.

Best,
Ryan

---------------------------------

PICnet (www.picnet.net) is an energetic, innovative Web development firm
changing the face of the online non-profit world using open source software.
We're looking to add another stellar Project Manager to our team, delivering
the high-quality service our non-profit, association, and advocacy clients
expect.

We're specifically looking for fun individuals from our non-profit sector
with experience in the Web development process (Joomla experience is a huge
plus).  Additionally, with our extensive Salesforce.com integration,
experience with Salesforce.com are points in the candidate's favor too!

Our Non-Profit Soapbox platform (www.nonprofitsoapbox.com) is a Joomla-based
content management system used by non-profits and socially responsible
businesses to easily manage their Web communications. ?We're looking to keep
up with demand by adding the right project management talent to our team.


*** What you're in for ***

At PICnet, we provide a unique environment for non-profits to build their
online presence. ?Our high-touch, high-quality service is what separates
from the crowd and keeps our client list expanding.

The individual who takes this position will have basic knowledge of the Web
development process and stellar communication skills. ?Juggling multiple
projects at the same time is the name of the game, and working alongside Red
Bull craving developers brings to life the solutions our non-profits need.


*** What to bring to the table ***

Although the position does not require a Web programming background, a
strong understanding of the Joomla CMS is definitely helpful. ?You should
have a bachelor's degree, great references, and excellent communication
skills. ?Experience working with Joomla at a non-profit, or delivering
awesome services to Web or communication consulting shops, is also a big
plus.

After all the hard work, you'll need to be willing to have fun, play
putt-putt golf in the office, and enjoy the sight of 3' tall inflatable
penguins. The right applicant will not only have the basic tech
qualifications, but will truly enjoy working for the non-profit sector.

You've gotta have heart. ?You've gotta be passionate about public service
and the social sector.


*** The not so fine print ***

* Position will be in-house, at our Dupont Circle location (no consultants
please), doors away from our CEO's favorite burrito shop in DC

* Salary commensurate with experience

* To apply, please send cover letter and resume to jobs at picnet.net,
attention Julie Dennis. ?IMPORTANT: Include your salary
history/requirements.

* In resume or cover letter, explain your past work experience in either the
non-profit or public service sectors. Also, please list any content
management experience you've had, particularly any you've had with Joomla.

Hi All,
I've used Joomla Bamboo and RocketTheme templates and I'm finding that I
would like to use something that is lighter weight than the RT templates,
something that is highly customizable. I would love to hear your
recommendations and thoughts on whose templates to use. Most of my sites are
SMB, Ma/Pa type businesses that may include ecommerce, content downloads or
simple billboard sites. 
Thanks,
Herb
