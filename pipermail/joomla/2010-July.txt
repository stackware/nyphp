Subject: [joomla] Code tip: Clearing errors from display
Message-ID: <AANLkTinf71NElq4DUiH189AetORtySjRLf4Ke_MXNq6g@mail.gmail.com>

   I am putting together a SSO set of plugins for IIS using Windows user
   accounts.

   As such, I am trusting that any user who connects is a valid user and
   allowing them to logon.

   I have a system plugin which fires first, it checks to make sure we
   have a REMOTE_USER set, parses out the username from the domain[using
   either slash since Windows except either and lowercase the username].

   Then it checks to see if that user is already logged on, if so no
   reason to keep going. If not, and the override is set, it will check
   to see if the user exists, if the user doesn't exist it creates the
   user, and then logs them on[and of course there is an IIS logon module
   which returns success for REMOTE_USER's that exist in the user
   database].

   All good. The only issue I ran into was that the user lookup function
   keeps throwing a warning that no user was found[basically, anytime you
   use the


   Joomla API to look for a user, it generates a user error message


   when no user is found.  This makes sense when a user is logging on,


   it is USELESS when you are looking for a user for other reasons]


   Despite auto logging the user on, there still is displayed an error
   message that no
   user was found.

   To work around this, I used the following code:
   ----
   // save the current warning handler
   $warnHandlers = JERROR::getErrorHandling( E_WARNING );
   // ignore warnings because we expect some users to not exist
   JERROR::setErrorHandling(E_WARNING, 'ignore');
   // lookup user by name`
   $finduser =& JFactory::getUser($username);
   // reset the warning handler(s)
   foreach($warnHandlers as $mode) {
   JERROR::setErrorHandling(E_WARNING, $mode);
   }

   // if this user does not exist, create it
   if (!($finduser)) {
   // first we need to clear the error
   $userError = JError::getError( true );
   jimport('joomla.user.user');
   $newuser =& JUser::getInstance(0);
   --------

   This resets the warning handler to ignore, runs the lookup code, then
   resets it to whatever mode(s) where set before. Finally, if the user
   did not exist, I know there is an error at the top of the error queue
   about that, so I call getError with true set to pop the error and
   remove it.

Message-ID: <4C2D07ED.50505@zooluserver.com>

Hey Everyone,

Wondering where everyone stands with Joomla and CCK extensions.  
Currently I see the top being K2, FLEXIcontent, Zoo, and JSeblod.

So far JSeblod seems to the best, with the most functionality, clean 
admin interface, and the ability to create custom templates per new 
content type.  Also the ability to package content type/fields together 
for reusability.

I guess the question I have is that, you need a good community behind 
one of these.  Which one allows the most flexibility but doesn't put you 
in a bubble.

I am using a news ticker on a site. It is based on a certain category.
When you click on the link, I want to take them to a specific nav, that 
contains the article
If you go to the home page jfkenterprise.zoeticdev.com and click on the

http://jfkenterprise.zoeticdev.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=113%3Ajfk-receives-achievment-award&catid=1%3Alatest-news&Itemid=67
I know I can use another type of slider to simulate the effect, but the 
client will add new articles with time.

So that makes it difficult to use.
Currently it will load into its own page.
Thanks

Hi,


So I was hired on months back as a freelancer to manage this New York school system site. I wanted to reach out and get some recommendations if Joomla would be up to the task of managing this site.

This current development of the site is a hybrid of using simple machines forum for forum and the user database, and than a wordpress blog. All of this is wrapped together running a custom CMS, and  this crazy index12.php file.

I am tasked with making a development proposals, so i would be looking for componet developers and a graphic designer  hoping to get someone from the list as everyone involved  so far is New York based.

I am wonder anyone else know of site  running joomla that gets  around 7 million page views a year? i am hoping this to increase after the upgrade to over 10 million. I am worried about performance. maybe joomla.org<http://joomla.org>?




Other questions.

The Main focus  of the site are the school profiles

Example: http://insideschools.org/index12.php?fs=1262&all=y

This I could only imagine being a custom built component,  this would need to include an advanced search function example: http://insideschools.org/?f=adv, Search Module, and a recent comments module. (Each school has comments.)

what do you think the estimated Development Costs for a component like this would be.

-----

Anyone from the list have Joomla Template Design experience  want to  send me a few work examples and the layouts and some cost estimates?

-----


I have already talked directly to a few people on this list offering work on this project and it actually comes into a go status I will still contact you directly about it.

I am just trying to get a total estimated cost for the over hual and a feature list of "why" to justify that cost.
Chris

I agree with Mitch, I have Joomla realty website that has millions of records and high click rates per day. Scalability is not a problem with Joomla, but with such high click rates please take of all the security exploits and file permissions.

I have a good hand on experience of Joomla component and module development. I am in India and I attended the CMS expo at Chicago this year too. If you are willing to outsource any development work (website, custom component, module, plugin, extension specific plugin and others) you are most welcome. We have good competitive rates and support

Thanks
James

Yes and no.  Here is the issue, a lot of the functionality on that site is
actually straight component stuff.

For example, any of the CCK's, moset trees, sobi2, k2, etc could be used for
that directory you mentioned, and there are comments and search modules for
them already.

While I have worked with sobi2 and k2.....I would actually NOT recommend
them at the moment as both are designed very much with certain 'mindsets'
that just would make life more difficult for that function.  As such, I'd
recommend Mosset's trees as I know it is used successfully on the Joomla
extensions directory[which has comments, favorites, etc built in]...as such
I'd suggest reaching out to Donna Vincent, http://www.iteachme.com/,  as she
has done a lot of work with Mossets and you want someone who can hit the
ground running.

Also, knowing that the extensions directory get quite a bit of traffic, you
know that you should be able to handle the traffic issues with Mosset's.

So you can keep using Wordpress for the blog, as it can integrate to Joomla.
 Continue to use SMF for the forums.  Add in Jfusion to link all the systems
together and your good to go with just replacing the CMS part and making it
the hub.

Yeah, I should not be recommending Wordpress for the blog, it feels
"cleaner" to make the blog in Joomla, but end user experience after end user
experience says Wordpress is easy to use and intuitive for users.  And if
they already know how to use it, why bother forcing them to learn a new
system?  In my book, minimize user learning, don't complicate it.

As I said, talk to Donna I think her experience is right up your alley.
 She's worked on high traffic sites with Mitch Pirtle and is very familiar
with Mosset trees which implements the directory functionality you want.

And hey, if you have some custom coding bits and pieces, I should have free
time next month...once the kids start camp and my current projects get
closed out. :-)

Joomla.org is a good example of what Joomla is capable of in this traffic
range.  Note, Joomla.org doe

The why is a good question.  Personally, if their site is working now why
should they upgrade?

Perhaps a better question would be what are their needs short and long term,
that their current system doesn't provide that they could get initially with
low cost from Joomla?

For example, the favorites list, rating and rankings, reviews, etc.  All of
this has already been done with Joomla and mosset trees, so they get it for
"free".

Plus allowing user tagging of schools would be good.  For example, I know
there are a number of special schools in NY dedicated to promoting specific
topics.  Brooklyn Tech and Bronx Science for example emphasis the
sciences[no debates over which school is best, it's obviously Bronx
Science.]

There are other schools that emphasis arts/theater, or take strong stances
against bullying, etc.

Being able to tag school specialties would be good.

How is their tracking currently and what future needs do they have?  There
are a lot of Google and other analytic functions with components for Joomla.

Social website integration would be high on my list, and with Joomla and
wordpress you can do that.  Don't require people to have a unique
userid/password but let them reuse their facebook one.  Use a module like
Plaxo Auto Invite to integrate OpenInviter and let users invite their
friends to the website.  Republish content to a Facebook fan page, twitter,
etc.

What are their goals for the site and what sorts of expansions are they
considering?  For example, when I was in the city, I'd love if that website
also included a section for private schools and philosophies.  As a personal
example, my family homeschools and follows the unschooling method[no debates
please].... as my wife's back has gotten worse, it just wasn't feasible to
continue...  As such, I would have loved a central website that consolidates
private schools in the city and also had them tagged so I would know, for
example, that the Booklyn Free School meets my educational preference[and
also would have a place for reviews as I have heard from many that there are
'issues' but without a lot of detail].

Obviously a mailling list would be good too[but then, I always plug setting
up mailling lists....  they are an easy way to entice return visitors]

Also a centralized calendar for those schools to post open houses and
informational meetings to[and heck, if we're going for wishes, if they
expanded here it would be great for InsideSchools to organize an 'open
house' meeting for schools city wide to send reps to and describe their
schools to parents!]

All this could be done with, say, mosset trees, their claim your listing
function to let schools claim their own listing and add rss/ical feeds to
it, and some tags for public/private schools.

Do they like the idea of private schools, but not on the main site?  Well
then, various multisite Joomla solutions could be used to use the same
database but restrict public school info to www.insideschools.org and
private school info to private.insideschools.org [though I would recommend
including the various charter schools, like Bronx Science, in both
categories].

And for my own "now" purposes, it would be great to have a "greater metro"
section...perhaps even broken down by county/region for data as well.  For
example, a duchess.insideschools.org, ulster.insideschools.org,
westchester.insideschools.org for regions of the state that contain a high
number of both weekend city residents and commuters.  As many weekend city
residents don't know of the educational options in the area weekend
at....and if they had options they liked in the region they might consider
changing to commuters[my own kids school, Hudson Valley Sudbury School, has
had a number of weekend residents join as their main reason not to commute
was school for the kids...knowing there is an economical[4500/year for the
first child, 75% of that for the second, and 50% for third+ children] option
THAT THEY LIKE makes all the difference for them.

Note, the multi site options in Joomla are on the weak side and require a
good bit of custom coding.  Wheras something like Drupal has quite a bit of
it almost "built in"[hey Forest, if your eyes have not glazed over yet, can
you take a look and let us know how much of this would be easy to do with
Drupal?]..... with Drupal though I find that implementing ANY function
almost always requires a coder to make some tweaks....maybe not an advanced
coder but a coder.   Wheras Joomla has lots of things that can be configured
by an implementor.

Lastly, I would strongly encourage considering upgrading the whole site to
HTML5/CSS3 and making it compatible with smartphones where possible.

Dear Donna,

As an extension developer I wish all Joomla developers used only MooTools,
the default javascript library for Joomla, in order to improve performance
(because we'd be loading only one js library) and especially for
compatibility issues;

If you do use JQuery, *please* also use this feature:
http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries

I urge all developers to use the Joomla framework.

Thanks for the link Donna! As it seems everyone but joomla is now
using jquery nowadays, it's always helpful to understand what jquery
can do, not only to "keep up with the joneses" but to learn from
others, as well as satisfy the client that has already invested
significantly into jquery.

I would like to use only MooTools, but because 1.5 is still using an outdated, 
backwards incompatible version of MooTools, that is very limiting and not always 
possible, especially when the client explicitly requests JQuery, or requests 
something that cannot be done with the old version of MooTools.

Dear Donna,

If it is a mid or big size project you can develop for Joomla 1.6, which has
the latest MooTools version. I believe the RC will probably be ready in less
than 60 days.

Kind regards,

I  would have loved it if joomla went to jquery with 1.6  or  if there was just both  installed as plugins would double the work thoughf or the admin templates

Dear Donna,

As an extension developer I wish all Joomla developers used only MooTools, the default javascript library for Joomla, in order to improve performance (because we'd be loading only one js library) and especially for compatibility issues;

If you do use JQuery, please also use this feature:
http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries

I urge all developers to use the Joomla framework.

A while back I recall someone mentioning wanting to assign templates by user
role, a feature I recently discovered in Drupal using the Sections add on
module but that Joomla apparently lacked.

Well, I was wrong.
http://www.metamodpro.com/

MetaTemplate adds the same sort of functionality for Joomla and much much
more.

Assign templates to specific content items.

Assign templates with start/end dates.

Assign template by geoip location.

Etc.

I have not(yet) reviewed the component but all in all, it looks like the
perfect solution to a rather sticky problem.

Oh I'd love to....but I suspect the likelyhood of me coming down to the city
during the summer is slim to none...  At least, not without bringing
kids....and I doubt a 2 year old would be conducive to a meeting. :-)

Well, if your going to do it remotely, I would recommend inviting them
directly then.

It looks like a great component, but I'm unlikely to do more than scratch
the surface by next month. :-)

Using Joomla built in search, is there an easy method to make the SERP 
be its own page instead of loading into current page?

I can change  the default_form.php and change the path for action, but 
was looking for any other choice.

That is overkill.
What I did was modify com_search/controller.php

Lines 72 and 74 and hard coded what I needed.
The module should support choosing what page you want search to show up in.

Hi all,

Peter from Microsoft shared this link with me, a must for all Joomla! 
programmers, as we always have clients in different browsers, this way we can 
see what they are seeing:


http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8e6ac106-525d-45d0-84db-dccff3fae677&displaylang=en


There is a professional version that includes firefox, etc...but at least this 
shows you ie 6,7,8 in 2 different screens.  It is standalone and you can compare 
side by side.

Thanks Peter!

Subject: [joomla] Style debates
Message-ID: <AANLkTin_fA4_Q-ZRcLuQrnwscEG8bdBmvV2_iv3L=BzB@mail.gmail.com>

A few style questions:

I was curious how others felt about the great fixed vs fluid width debate.

On the one hand, a fixed width site lets you place things PRECISELY where
you want them on the page as far as the left/right corners are concerned.

On the other hand, I frequently run 2 browsers side by side and fixed width
websites makes it much harder to work with them.

I am leaning towards a fluid width with minimum width hinting.....


Another question is rounded corners.  I LOOOOVE rounded corners, but I hate
the javascript/images that one uses to do them.  As such, my own inclination
is towards using the webkit/mozilla rounded corners CSS styling and just let
the chips fall to square corners in non-compliant browsers.

And here is one for Mitch, gradients.   I really hate using image background
gradients, but now that CSS3 will allow one to specify gradients, I'm
inclined to use them because they just LOOK so much nicer.....but again only
for browsers supporting the CSS commands, let other browsers have the older
ones.

Then there is transparent backgrounds...where you place a transparent
background on your main content area so it floats above your background...
 they simply look cool to me....but my wife tells me she has a lot of
trouble reading text on transparent backgrounds so I'm thinking out they go
personally.

So, I figured the Joomla list is a nice mix of coders and designers to get
various ideas from.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla vs Drupal, a coders perspective
Message-ID: <AANLkTindy3JBPnjBdiOsF1y15zFYATnmq3D+1fQi+aor@mail.gmail.com>

I thought since I've been working with Joomla a bit, I'd post some
comparisons from a usability/coding standpoint:

1) Joomla has components.  Components are mini applications which do things.
Drupal has modules. Modules are mini applications which do things.

2) Joomla has modules.  Modules are little blocks of content that are
displayed on the screen, dynamically or statically generated content.
Drupal has blocks.  Blocks are....little blocks of content that are
displayed on the screen, dynamically or statically generated content.

3) Joomla has plugins, plugins respond to "events" in the system.
 Components, modules, and plugins can invoke other plugins, so they can add
their own "events" to the default set of events.
Drupal has "hooks"  Hooks are functions that are invoked based on the end of
the function name.  Modules, blocks, and hooks can invoke other hooks[PHP
when executed has a global array of all functions...in drupal, a "hook"
would have a specific ending name, such as
mycoolcomponent_generate_tracking_hook..... when the "master"
generate_tracking_hook is run, it will search the array of all functions for
other functions that end in generate_tracking_hook and it will call them]

4) Joomla has templates used to designate display style.
Drupal has themes used to designate display style.

Joomla has a single template system....one template is active and used for
display.  Drupal uses a multiple theme system, every theme gets a
ranking/score and when a display view is being called, Drupal will work
through all the themes to determine which one has a view that matches and
displays it.   Sort of like template overrides, but with more depth[and
themes can be designated as "subthemes" so that they use other themes
automatically.]

5) Joomla has adopted an object oriented style of coding.....  Drupal
follows a function/array oriented style of code*2.  In Joomla you might
have:
$user
$user->type
$user->name
$user = JApplication::getUser($id)

In Drupal you would have
$user[]
$user['type']
$user['name']
$user = application_get_user($id)

6) Joomla does not "eat their own dogfood"...they rely on many external
third party apps for development[JoomlaForge, phpBB, etc]
Drupal does eat their own dogfood.  All their projects are managed using a
Drupal module called Projects, which includes Version Control hooks, issue
tracking, component packaging, API documentation generation, etc

7) Installation/configuration
Joomla has an installer system that most components utilize to
install/configure components by uploading an archive file and letting Joomla
automatically install it.
Drupal requires manually upload and unzip into specific directories....plus
often configuration by editing config files.

8) Upgrade/maintenance
Joomla does not automatic maintenance
Drupal will autmatically check modules, including the core files, against
the latest published ones and even offer you alternatives[ie published
version is X and is installed, beta version X.1 has been released]..  You
can automatically extract and install updates to code.

9) Scheduled tasks
Joomla does not do scheduling
Drupal includes a cron task out of the box

10) Input forms
Joomla has built in functions for generating fields for input*2
Drupal has a rich set of functions to generate complete forms, along with
the ability to override field definitions[for example, it is SIMPLE to
extend Drupal to support HTML5 field definitions by overriding the current
html field generation]

Looking over it all, Joomla has a "cleaner" style of coding to me and is
overall better.  What it does not have is the maturity of drupal. Many many
Joomla components re-invent their own "plugin" system because they do not
know that they can merely extend the Joomla plugin system to do the same
thing.  Joomla's API documentation is produced manually
occasionally....Drupal's is produced automatically every night from the
current codebase.    Joomla's developer docs are scattered in 3 or 4
different places, plus finding docs for different versions is a pain.
 Drupal not only maintains documentation automatically, you can easily
browse documentation by version[4, 5, 6, 7] and when viewing documentation
you will see what versions of Drupal that doc applies to.

Drupal is a much richer, mature environment.  Where it fails is that to make
minor modifcations[add some blocks to the screen] really require a web
implementor to do.  Wheras in Joomla, clients can easily add and configure
new modules to the screen[on the website I setup for fundraising for my
brothers memorial.....his niece who is not a computer person was able to
download, install, configure and publish a fundraising tracking thermometer
with the only help from me being "here is a link to one you can use"....  on
Drupal?  Not a chance...]

I prefer empowering the users[ok, honestly I prefer not getting called to
implement crap like the thermometer], so I prefer Joomla.  But I see a lot
in Drupal that Joomla should be learning from.

*1: Drupal 7 is migrating to object orientation in many ways
*2: Joomla 1.6 adds a rich Form API...which ironically seems to be
struggling from the fact that rather than reviewing how Drupal does things
and avoiding pitfalls already encountered and worked around in Drupal
someone decided to roll it himself and is making many mistakes that Drupal
already dealt with

2. Joomla vs Drupal, a coders perspective (Gary Mort)

Amazing post, Thank You! I went to one day of the Drupal Camp NYC 2010 to
learn and observe. In the days before the camp installed local version and
created a test site. It had been a while since I had done that with Drupal.
>From an integrators perspective it is mature and elegant in it's coding,
documentation and user community a much higher percentage of the attendees
where actual coders/developers than at a equivalent Joomla event. But
compared to Joomla as far as getting up a basic site to do many things it
was much more time consuming and involved and takes a much higher technical
proficiency. It is reflected in the book shelf at say Barnes and Noble
almost all Drupal books are for developers, almost all Joomla books are end
designer and users manuals.

Joomla's object oriented approach is much more advanced and abstract and
has  been much more and it has been set up to be more designer and user
friendly thus there are more users less community. Drupal much more on basic
level programmer friendly for a beginning to average programmer. Joomla as
percentage has in number fewer coders and developers that participate in the
community but the ones that do are very advanced. The Joomla community needs
to work much harder at Joomla developer training of beginning and mid level
programmers to flourish. Drupal needs to work much harder at getting a
friendlier interface for designers and users probably by including more in
their core to grow their end user community.

Excellent! Gary, can you put this up on the JUG website?

To be fair, the whole "not invented here" syndrome is prevalent in the
web development world overall, and plagues a great many more projects
than just Joomla.

I still think that completely sucks though. :-)

I really want to clean it up a bit before posting it far and wide. :-)

But I've been sitting on my thoughts for about a week and a half now after
doing a bunch of custom coding to get Ubercart to work the way I wanted it
to.  One thing I found nice was that it was a HECK of a lot easier than
Virtuemart to customize...and a LOT more nicely integrated than Magento[in
fact, we are currently using Magento and it completely sucks]

So I figured I'd let em out in case others had their own input on Drupal vs
Joomla....  terminology is a real b......i....t......c.......you know what.
 Since both Drupal and Joomla have "modules" but they do completely
different things.  Plugins in Joomla are self-documenting to an extent,
while hooks in drupal you need to lookup.  The Joomla extensions directory,
for all my complaints, really shines while Drupal's you have to know what
your looking for more clearly.

All in all.... I have a real appreciation for the power of Drupal....but I
still prefer Joomla.
