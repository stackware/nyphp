Subject: [joomla] PHP developer needed for CMS (Joomla) work
Message-ID: <4997F4BA-A89B-4554-9A46-5C93E9ACCC9C@abpi.net>

Midtown Manhattan B2B magazine publisher seeks LAMP developer to join  
and become integral member of online content team.  The ideal  
candidate will contribute to the development of Joomla 1.0.x CMS  
components, modules, mambots, and templates - requiring PHP 5 and  
mySQL 4.1 chops as well tight html and css skills.  Areas of  
development will span ongoing maintenance and workflow optimization  
projects as well as time sensitive development relating to sponsored  
content and microsites.

At this time three of our publications have been migrated to Joomla  
with four more transitioning by end of year.  Parallel to this effort  
is the development of online content and email blast ticketing tools  
for integration with PHPList for a 100k+ user base.  These tools will  
support the circulation, editorial, and marketing departments.  We  
also have a long list of exciting features to be worked on once the  
nuts and bolts work is completed.

Become part of this energetic team that rounds out the efforts of a  
company with over thirty years in the hi-tech/engineering publishing  
field. This position reports to the (hands on) Technology Director.   
Competitive salary is commensurate with experience.

If interested, email luke at abpi.net.

Since PHP4 support is officially ending in August, anyone know what the 
Joomla folks are doing about that? I was on the gophp5.org website 
yesterday where a lot of open source applications have pledged to abandon 
PHP4.

As far as ending in August, it's already ended... 

Support for PHP 4 has been discontinued since
2007-12-31. Please consider upgrading to PHP 5.2. The
release below is the last PHP 4 release.
http://us3.php.net/downloads.php#v4

I do not recomend php 4.x to ANYBODY for any reason...
 The backwards incompatabilites between 5.x and 4.x
are so small that upgrading and incompatible script
should be relatively easy... 

If your host still runs php4, have them upgrade.  If
they won't, find a new host...  It's that simple...

That's all very good but it doesn't really answer my question.

(Oh, and releasing security fixes does not mean it's

Does anyone know what it is I could be missing on my hosting account that prevents pdfs from being created?

Well, as it has been pointed out, the meeting falls on
Valentines day.  Now, the way I see it, we can do 1 of
three things.

1. Cancel the meeting.
2. Try to push the meeting back a week (to 2-21-08)
3. Have the meeting anyway.

What do you all think?

#3 (having the mtg on 2/14) is okay with me.

I can't make Thursday, and this week is tough for me as I'm going on a
trip this weekend. I can do any time past next Tuesday though.

I just spoke to Gary Mort. He is backed up on reading his emails. I told him
there was a discussion of canceling this month's meeting, and he said it was
all right with him - he is not able to attend this month.

I've made arrangements so that I could attend this Thursday. I suppose I
could rearrange my schedule to attend next week instead, but that is
going to push up close upon my preparations for an out of town
conference I must attend at the end of next week.

Is V-day a big deal anyway???

Well, I've always considered Valentine's Day and my birthday to be the two most important holidays of the year :-) but since the rest of the world doesn't seem to share my point of view on this, I've learned to accept it as fairly ordinary days. :-)

I think we should do it, even if it's an informal meeting, just to make sure these meetings don't fall by the wayside.  There's always going to be scheduling problems with some people some months.

OK, I'll be there. December's meeting was also a small one, but I think
it is important to keep a regularity about the meetings anyway.

Are there any issues with Joomla! that anyone wants to address at the
meeting?

Hey guys,

We may have met in the past, I work here at Robert Half and normally
coordinate with Gary Mort for the meetings.  If you guys are going to
meet, please let me know as soon as possible so I can put your names in
our security system.  

Also, there were 4 or 5 people from the Dreamweaver/WebTechNY group last
night that were planning on coming.  If you are not going to meet I
would like to let them know so they don't show up!

Thanks,

Well, 
I've 
always 
considered 
Valentine's 
Day 
and 
my 
birthday 
to 
be 
the

> 
two 
most 
important 
holidays 
of 
the 
year 
:-) 
but 
since 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
> 
world 
doesn't 
seem 
to 
share 
my 
point 
of 
view 
on 
this, 
I've 
learned 
to 
> 
accept 
it 
as 
fairly 
ordinary 
days. 
:-)

That 
is 
just 
too 
funny! 
roflmao!

want...

> 
I 
think 
we 
should 
do 
it, 
even 
if 
it's 
an 
informal 
meeting, 
just 
to 
> 
make 
sure 
these 
meetings 
don't 
fall 
by

wayside.  
There's

some 
months.
>

OK, 
I'll 
be 
there. 
December's 
meeting 
was 
also 
a 
small 
one, 
but 
I 
think
it 
is 
important 
to 
keep 
a 
regularity 
about 
the 
meetings 
anyway.

Are 
there 
any 
issues 
with 
Joomla! 
that 
anyone 
wants 
to 
address 
at 
the
meeting?

Thank you Gary for the heads up.  There will be at
least a few of us tonight.  You can contact me at this
email on the side if we need a list of people
(ircmaxell at yahoo.com), but there shouldn't be anyone
new that wasn't on the last list.  Thanks

Anthony.

Subject: [joomla] help fight the death of gigCalendar
Message-ID: <47B478A4.5000603@nuthinwerked.com>

Hello friendly Joomlers-
    I manage a project called gigCalendar, a popular Joomla extension 
for listing events. With the release of Joomla 1.5, I'm concerned that 
the project may die out because there are no developers on the project.

    Are you interested in coding for Joomla 1.5? If so, gigCalendar 
might be the perfect project to join. We have a huge installed user base 
and are eager to continue development. Please feel free to browse our 
website for more information on the project:

    * http://gigcalendar.net

    Thanks for your interest. I believe that gigCalendar has helped 
bring a lot of users to Joomla and would like to see this continue. 
Please send your response directly to my email rather than clogging up 
this list.

Best-
Graham Spice

Subject: [joomla] Meeting Recap -- Feb. 14, 2008
Message-ID: <391033.56426.qm@web35609.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

We had a nice meeting, even though it was "cancelled", of 6 people.  

Anthony showed us some of his sites and an extension he is working on -- to describe it would diminish it.  :-)

We also discussed various issues and ideas we had, and gave and received feedback.

I'd like to see more of Anthony's dynamic Google map with locations of fires.
