=====================


We are meeting tonight, Thursday May 15, 2014

This month we will be meeting 4 blocks away from our usual Touro College
address, and instead meet at the Hive at 55, where we have in the past held
JoomlaCamp events.

Pre-registration is not required for building security, but we would
appreciate it if you signed up at Meetup.com and let others know you will be
attending.

<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Joomla-Users-Group/events/182634862/">http://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Joomla-Users-Group/events/182634862/</A>

We are looking for more presenters for future meetings.  Let us know if you
can present or if you are interested in particular topic presentations.

Location:

Hive at 55
55 Broad Street, 13th Floor
New York, NY  10004

Chairperson: Stewart Newfeld
6:00 - 6:15 - Introductions
6:15 - 8:00 

Presentation 1 by Stewart Newfeld: Two very powerful Joomla Extensions are
available for creating forms and form applications: RSJoomla! offers
RSForm!Pro (Prices starting at 19 Euros), and Chronoengine offers
Chronoforms and Chronoconnectivity (Free version available).  RSForm!Pro is
one of the most clearly documented Joomla Extensions available.
Chronoforms' most basic functionallity is documented in FAQs, but for
anything advanced you are left hunting through the forums, posting questions
to the forums, or like Stewart did, hiring a person to train you.  These two
programs take very different approaches to creating forms.  Stewart will
compare and contrast them, and demonstrate a few case studies for
Chronoforms.


Presentation 2 by Stewart Newfeld: Did you ever need to generate PDF
documents from within Joomla?  When you need to generate documents in a
format with predicatable, controllable printing, you can't beat the PDF
format. Stewart will discuss some possible solutions and demonstrate
creating fundrasing letters in .pdf format, from form input data, by
restoring the fpdf library that used to be in Joomla 1.5, but was removed in
Joomla 1.6. 

8:00-8:30 Lightening Round Question and Answers, Networking.

 

Stewart Newfeld, President

New York City Joomla Users Group (NYCJUG)
