<PRE>Mosets Tree is a directory component that has a feature called &quot;Claim this listing&quot;, where the owner of the business (or whatever) can click a button saying this is his/her listing and he/she wants to update the info.

Even if you write your own component tailored to your needs, Joomla is a great framework to build on.  There are functions already in place for the admin part of the component for &quot;New&quot;, &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, etc., as well as the sortable grid listing.

Subject: [joomla] Membership extension for Joomla, or another platform suggestion?

I have a project I'm prosing for a new non-profit and I think Joomla may be well suited for it. I'd greatly appreciate any opinions on this such as &quot;David, here are five extensions that do most everything you asked.&quot; Or constructive comments like, &quot;Wouldn't your time be better spent not trying to cram this thing down Joomla's throat and instead use X?&quot;.

[Short pre-ample:]
A non-profit group is forming and building a membership. They have a list of people they would like to become members, but they don't have contact information for them. So the concept was to set-up a web site which would both manage the membership database and make it easy for new prospects to join and associates of theirs update their contact information and be able to send them an invitation to check out the web site, update their own contact information and join the membership.
[/Short pre-ample:]

The primary requirement for getting things started is to have a &quot;Looking for...&quot; section. This would list the prospective members by name and what information is missing, for example:

    Mickey Mouse     - Need Phone Number and E-mail address
    Donald Duck        - Need Postal mailing address.

    The visitor needs to be able to select a name displayed, supply the information and confirm their update via e-mail confirmation.  Of course, there is a concern about security here and to prevent malcontents for entering rubbish. I've not thought about how to solve that yet, because we would like to be able to do this without requiring visitors to register unless it's a simple registration. Or maybe an audit feature, where the new updates don't take effect until they are reviewed by the Admin. I'm certainly open to suggestions on how to handle this best.

The membership is expected to be in the thousands and they will want to be able to send e-mail newsletters and alerts to everyone. What are people doing for this, so it gets past the mailers so it isn't flagged a SPAM? Are you using something like Exact Target  (<A HREF="http://email.exacttarget.com/">http://email.exacttarget.com/</A>) or are you able to have the e-mail sent out N number of messages every X seconds according to your service providers restrictions?

Although not discussed yet, I imagine as things progress they are going to want to be able to do accounting functions for the membership such as tracking payments and sending out reminders. Of course, that can be another module down the road which would key this existing database.

So tell me straight is this good for Joomla? Anything out there so the wheel doesn't need to be re-invented? Or is this a job for a good PHP frame work?

Thanks in advance to any kind souls that offer helpful suggestions!
