<PRE>Forgive me if this is the wrong place to ask! Just found the NYC group, and
hope to attend soon. 

I build/maintain a couple of church websites, and have been using PHP/MYSQL
for some of the automation. Found Joomla, and looking to see if that will
work for me, as I need to add the ability for church staff to add content,
without my intervention. I took a Joomla course on Lynda.com which got me up
to speed pretty quickly in general.

Things I can't seem to clearly find searching through the doc and
extensions/modules:

1) Would like to be able to lock down the secretary to only be able to
upload to a specific category (weekly newsletters in PDF format). Then add a
module that only displays articles in that category. Seems like
upload/managing attachments is not as straight forward as it should be? Are
there some recommended ways of letting end users manages file attachments?
2) Add a calendar, which display the next 'x&quot; upcoming events on the right
side, and links to a full calendar of scheduled events. Seems like there are
a ton of add on calendars, which might you recommend? Or are most people
using Google now, and just linking that in?
3) Are there plans to allow more granular security? Like user groups that
can do/see certain things?
4) Just how risky are some of these add-ons? It looks like there is quite
the market for these, and one hopes they are stable!

Thanks much.

Paul.
