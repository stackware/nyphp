<PRE>If K2 has an extended registration system, then I'll use that because I am going to be using K2 on the site anyway.  Haven't used K2 before so I didn't know.

CB seems like overkill for this purpose.

Subject: Re: [joomla] Extension for website access?

Community Builder.  :-)

Though personally Community Builder seems a little long in the tooth to me and needs a complete rewrite.

Things I would change in Community Builder:
1) Drop support for Mambo and Joomla 1.0 and as such, get rid of a lot of version checking code
2) Move to using Joomla 1.5 input sanitizers instead of the CB ones.  Where CB has a better sanitizer, promote it as a patch to the core files instead of having a seperate setup
3) Drop a lot of the CB events....or if maintaining them for backwords compatibility, at least adopt a set of plugins to have CB events trigger Joomla events and vice versa[for example, when the CB before and after registration events get triggered, they should also trigger the Joomla ones.  And if the Joomla one gets triggered, it should trigger the CB one.  With recursion checking of course. :-)
4) A decent CB User api to load the CB user info to the Joomla user profile so it can be accessed by other programs.  Also a decent api for registration of new users.
5) Move rules to configurable options instead of buried in php files[the regex for verifying user names is buried in a mess of if/then version checking and the rules vary depending on what CMS your using].

In short, CB either needs a complete overhaul...or it needs something else.


Fabrikaar also has some custom user profile form logic/configuration.


Once a user is actually logged in, then it's a simple matter of setting anything which is for registered users only as for registered users only.  More fine grained control can be found through things like the CB plugins which set access to Remository and Docman based on fields in CB.


Hmm... CB is still the best choice out there I can see......  But then I won't pony up to purchase the other products like JomSocial.


K2 DOES have an interesting take on user registration.  It also maintains it's own set of tables for user registration and uses the Joomla plugin system to extend user registration with their own fields, and update that data on submit.  Also with K2 you have the ability to set &quot;Categories&quot; of postings which can have files, images, image gallery, extra fields, etc.  And you can define access to those categories by K2 user group[so &quot;Members&quot; can read all posts, but can only post to the car for sale listings.  Wheras realtors can post to the house for sale listing category as well].


Lots of ways to skin this cat.....  and I suffer from PHP developer-ites[also called Mitch's disease] and don't like any of them. :-)
