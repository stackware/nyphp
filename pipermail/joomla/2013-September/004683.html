between Rector &amp; Exchange Place
New York, NY 10006

Chairperson: Stewart Newfeld
6:00 - 6:15 - Introductions and Miscellaneous Business
6:15 - 8:00 - PRESENTATION #1:  Normally, only Superusers can login into a
Joomla site that is taken offline.  Stewart Newfeld will show how easy it is
to assign &quot;offline access permission&quot; to selected non-superusers and
customize the Site Offline Logo.  This lets you stage a site and keep it
away from the public until you are ready to launch it, or to create a site
to function as an intranet site.  In addition, Stewart will explain how to
make different menu items available to different groups of users.  An
example would be to create items only accessible to an organization's Board
Members, or to stage additions to a webiste that only a few people can see
while it is undergoing development and before the material is approved to go
public. The techniques demonstrate apply equally to Joomla 2.5 and 3.x

PRESENTATION#2: Creating interactive forms fill-in forms like an IRS 1040
Tax Form, that can be downloaded from your website, is an often requested
website feature.  We'll have a quick demonstration of how suprisingly easy
this is to accomplish with Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat.


8:00-8:30 Lightening Round Question and Answers, Networking.

 

Stewart Newfeld, President

New York City Joomla Users Group (NYCJUG)
Meetings 6-8:30 PM every 3rd Thursday of the Month
