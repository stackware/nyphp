Subject: [joomla] Need Joomla 1.5 book recommendation for Webmasters
Message-ID: <642abf2e0812011638h5cb925aeveb75c2971aaaee2d@mail.gmail.com>

Now I read this. :-)

To follow-up my own postings. I'm like most of us, I tell people about
Joomla and then would like to turn over good resources to them so they can
get going on their own. I decided to explore two Joomla books for
recommendations to Webmasters. One is the Visual Quickstart Guide Joomla! by
Marni Derr and Tanya Symes published by Peachpit, and the second one is
Joomla! A User's Guide by Barrie M. North published by Prentice Hall. Both
of these books arrived today so I've not been able to examine them closely
yet, but I did skim through them. North's book in Chapter 11 titled,
"Creating a Restaurant Site for Joomla!" looks like an excellent guide for a
Webmaster. I also like the areas called "The Least You Need to Know" which
is exactly what a Webmaster is looking for. Before anyone gets huffy about
the job title of Webmaster, I am referring to those who are not programmer
types but have responsibility to control content on a web site. The Visual
Quickstart Guide Joomla! is what the name implies as the rest of the Visual
Quickstart series where there are many screen shots with text next to them
briefly explaining each item such as a parameter.

I'm going to turn these two books over to a Webmaster and see how they do
and what is found to be most useful. It might be the combination of these
two books or merely specific sections from each.  I've professionally
enjoyed the work of Barrie North and dig his newsletters and web site.
However, I am looking for Joomla resources for Webmasters as I defined above
since like all of us I want to see Joomla continue to grow and one way is
for the Webmasters to be sold on it. I had a Webmaster search Amazon.com and
come up with these two books independently of my influence.

It's a follow-up not a review. If people are interested, I will ask
the Webmaster I turned these two books over to for comments after
allowing enough time to get familiar with them.

If anyone knows of other Joomla resources that are good for Webmasters
please let us know. Thanks!

Subject: [joomla] Wrapping an ASP script
Message-ID: <29210.62165.qm@web35601.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

A website I have has a page that wraps an ASP script from a Windows server.  The iframe src was something like "http: // xx.xxx.xxx.xxx/SciptPath/script.asp" where xx... is the IP address.

Everything was fine until the IP address of the server was changed.  I updated the IP address in the iframe's src but am getting a message "The system cannot find the path specified."

They're telling me that I have the correct new IP address and that nothing else has changed with that Windows server.

Does anyone have any ideas about what might be going on here?

TIA.

If you type http: // xx.xxx.xxx.xxx/SciptPath/script.asp

into your browser what happens?

It is possible that they changed the path or screwed up the IIS configuration.

When I type the IP address in browser I get the same thing that I get in the iframe: "The system cannot find the path specified."

They said the only change they made was the IP address of the server.

can you ping or tracert to the server ??
if not then download this  http://www.elifulkerson.com/projects/tcping.php
and try to hit the server using port 80 if that fails the web services
on that server are not running

Also you might want empty out your browser cache. remember the address
in an iframe is just code . The url is still the same so your server
maybe serving up cached info or your web browser.

When I did a DNS lookup for the IP address, it was mail.mydomain.com.  Wouldn't that be their mail server???

Could be, perhaps their zone records are screwed up.

That's not the real name of the path.  That's dummy text I used.

Anyway, their path didn't update, just the IP.

If you type http: // xx.xxx.xxx.xxx/SciptPath/script.asp

into your browser what happens?

It is possible that they changed the path or screwed up the IIS
configuration.

I an up to Chapter 6 of "Barrie" and am enjoying it as a read. In th
enext couple days I plan on re-starting the Joomla based web design I
had gotten confused on before; that should give me a better feel of how
much I've learned. 

While I'm sure there are web resources that cover everything Barrie
does, I save money by spending a little. Keeps me from Googling and
trying and then having to Google again. Besides, I can read my book in
the living room and don't have to worry about the dog or kid breakig
it.  :)

A lot of places only have one machine exposed to the outside. Mail, web,

They are mistaken. :-)

If you cannot go directly to the URL they are telling you to use, why
would an IFRAME going to the exact same place work? They have to
figure out what they did when they broke it, and unbreak it for you.
As long as that URL doesn't work, your IFRAME will never work.

Then it has to be within the server configuration.
What type of server are they running?
I am guessing IIS or Apache.

If so, did they change the configuration and host files to reflect the new IP?

I am having issues with an internet connection. Can anyone think of a widget
that will continue to scan for connectivity... kind of like Pingdom but in
reverse?

I suppose I could use ping :)

Why not? Sometimes I run 'ping -i' in a window.

Unless you want to graph the latency?

Doh ' I just realized thats an internal IIS error..
They have a / when the should have a \ or vice versa
A bad drive mapping , internal connection to a data source., missing folder..
That's the system being IIS says I can't find my way to that resource.
Sorry for being so brain dead

The connection is really inconsistent and I want to track it some. Tech
support (of course) say there is no problem.

I want to be isolate specific times of day it was down.

if its a server running that widget would show up in the Apache logs.
If its trying to test connectivity from host to internet. then  just
use a ftp client to connect ot ahost and have it set to try every 5
minutes . you will have log from the ftp client

or http://manageengine.adventnet.com/products/netflow/download.html

the free version allows 2 interfaces

Message-ID: <1229003667.2963.15.camel@leitz>

Okay, I'm in the same straits as the economy. However, I want to have
two Joomla based sites on the same hosting package. The sites will not
be large but should be totally separate from a web client view. 

Is the possible? Possible but difficult? Never been done before but
can't say why not? Already done the world over?

I seem to be the early bird sans worm on #joomla...

Joomla is self-contained within the directory it is installed. The only
external requirement is the MySQL database which simply needs to have a
different name for each Joomla installation to keep them totally separate.
On a web hosting service which allows virtual domain hosting, you can have
as many Joomla web sites each with its own domain as allowed. If you must
only have one domain, Joomla can be installed totally separate and
self-contained in multiple directories.  For example:

www.example.com/website1 (website1 would be a directory that the first
installation of Joomla is installed.)
www.example.com/website2 (website2 would be a directory that the second
installation of Joomla is installed.)

I hope you find this useful and this answers your question.

Whoa hold up there Sparky..

One issue will be security . if your ISP only runs PHP as an Apache
module and NOT CGI, you can expose both sites to huge security issues.
Something tells me that 777 means sign of the devil to you and in this
case it will be.

Some extensions can browse directories and if not running CGI all
directories will be exposed.
Also it would not take much for some php scripts to mangle a a bunch
of stuff. Just because Joomla can live in its own country and be self
contained , however it still is ruled by a world called Apache PHP sh
perl etc..
In the interest of truth justice and the comics , if you want to
succeed you need to invest a little in your environment, spend $20 a
month and get yourself a virtual server. A good provider will set it
up correctly for you to use CGI and then should any client grow and
need HTTPS, you can meet their needs. Also you could run as many sites
as you wanted ( subject to hard drive space CPU and RAM resources ) as
www.whatever.com, www.mysite.com  etc all totally independent of each
other..

Your customers are clueless for the most part , they rely on your to
provide good council. Doing it wrong to save a few pennies and expose
the customers is bad for them and you. And Joomla per se..

Last but not least many ISP's are moving to  PHP as a module because
it saves resources. Of course many of the first level people you will
talk to don't know either so you will just get the propaganda.
The more I think about this the more I can write . but I have work to do..

Hey Oz, valid points. Let me ask though, if both sites are under my sole
control is there as much of a security issue? 

Workload wise I'll use maybe 5-10% of Joomla. The personal site is
mostly a demonstration of my work, the second site is an opinion/help
site. If the second site *can* make enough to support itself I'd rather
make them separate. However, right now anything that goes into the
sites, dollar wise, comes out of my son's Christmas. Geeky as I am, I
have limits.  :)

Leam

p.s. Sign of the devil is 666. "7" is the perfect number, or so I'm
told...

Umm I have learned over the years to never 'negotiate' an opinion.
It's up to you to decide whether its secure or not   ??
Good practice / best practice earns that title by its own ability..lol
If you are to embark on career doing Joomla your should really make an
effort to understand some of the stuff I pointed out.

Hehe...I'm still learning a lot.  :)

I *understand* what you wrote, at a basic level. Don't fully
"comprehend" it such that I know best practices and see the pitfalls
before I falls into the pits...

Most likely it will be secure, but it depends more on what type of 
platform you are on.

A shared hosted is quite insecure depending on host company.
But most people will not know you exist, therefore not much to worry about.
But you need to learn.

If security is not an issue, leave all your doors open and tell me
where you live ?

The intention here is not to share the Joomla database with another
instance, but to keep them separate. If the MySQL database created has its
own name to match the instance, then this would prevent each instance from
interfering with another which is the objective. The purpose is to have
these instances behave as if they were on totally different machines with no
relationship to each other. Here is a detailed example:
www.example.com/website1 with a Joomla directory name of website1 using a
MySQL database name of website1_db, website1_usr for the MySQL account to
access it, with a table name of ws1_ (instead of jos_).

www.example.com/website2 with a Joomla directory name of website2 using a
MySQL database name of website2_db, website1_usr for the MySQL account to
access it, with a table name of ws2_ (instead of jos_).

Creating a different table name for each instance so there is no mistake in
what is being referred to.

The above is how I have been doing this where I have several instances of
Joomla on the development server so I can keep a demo instance, development
instance and a staging instance. I then use the Joomla backup component,
JoomlaPack, to easily move an instance to another server.

You have given me an idea. If someone has several related Joomla instances
where there was a need to share the user registrations amongst them, then
what you are suggesting would be useful, although I've not done that myself
yet.

Is that a note to the community that security best practices aren't
standardized? Anyone have a script that will go through a Joomla
instance and find vulnerabilities?

Matilda the puppy had a rough time last night so I didn't get much
sleep. Spent a few brain cycles on this and what I hear you saying is
that the regular hosted instance of Joomla is very security vulnerable. 

I've already run into instances where PHP writing files to the server
requires overly open permissions. My hosted directory runs under my
username but apache runs under it's own name. While I can accept that my
scripts need security it sounds like there's a larger issue.

Can you elaborate a bit when you have time? I understand your concern
about Extensions showing directory and thus file contents. With no extra
estensions outside of 1.5 base, is the vulnerability still there? I
believe the hosted Apache instance runs php as a module, but they've
done some stuff to PHP and then bother telling us after the fact. 

Your note does press on a larger issue; how is security in Joomla
documented and nurtured in the community?

Leam
  
p.s. Hope this both makes sense and avoids offense. Matilda really did
have a rough night and so did "daddy".

That's the best way so each DB is unique, easier to manage and less
resources used.
Using a db as single sign on means then you have to use one master db
then use table prefixes to keep each site unique. Its way too early in
the morning to think about how this would impact session id's etc.Also
if the sites are physically remote from each other now you have to
authenticate across the internet versus locally.
HTTPS would be fun...  heh

Hey folks,

Last night we discussed the need for an online document management
system that was aware of versions and whatnot. This morning I took a
deeper look at OpenGoo (mentioned by the friendly fellas at Net at Work)
and it looks to fit the bill. Would love to hear what the rest of you
think about OpenGoo, as it looks quite promising.

Looks cool but it would be a pain for me cause it overlaps with basecamp .
I can do all this stuff in basecamp, dotproject or vtiger and a whole
bunch more ..
I am struggling a little to understand their market basecamp I would guess..

Do you mean a different database for each instance, or a different
prefix for the tables?

My point was for those on a shared host, which may limit the number of
mysql databases available with the account. If necessary, the database
can be shared between Joomla! systems. I didn't suggest that this was
ideal, but just that the flexibility was there.

I don't think so. The user tables are stored in the database, with the
table name having the prefix of that particular install. You wouldn't be
able to share the user list.

I was using runphp in a 1.0.15 site and everything was fine.  Now all of a sudden nothing from the content item displays, whether in the include file or in the content item.  So I installed jumi and tried that and same thing.  The mambots are published and were working before.

Anyone have any ideas?

What are you running within runphp and is that

I was in an elevator with them back in the 80s or early 90s.  When we got out of the elevator my friend said to me, "That was RunDMC!".  I said "it was what? I can't understand what you're saying.  Run, what?".

What are you running within runphp and is that 
any relation to RunDMC? [BTW sorry I could not 
make it, I was at a launch party for a client whose work features Run DMC]

I use RSForms for all my forms.  Easy to use, you can format it any which way, it sends html emails, and saves to the db.

Hi all,
?
I have RSForm installed on my client's 1.0.15 site, and he is getting spammed about 10 times a day, even with the captcha on.
?
On RSForm's site forums they mention this problem, with different 'solutions', has anyone else had this problem?
?
The problem is on the site: http://www.knowpci.com
?
Any ideas would be appreciated!
?
thanks,
Laura

I have that problem with one of my sites.  If it's a human filling in the form with spam, there's nothing you can do to stop it.  I don't know how a robot would get through, though.

RSForms records the IP address.  Maybe you can block the IP addresses, especially if they're out of the country.

you could try with Akismet, www.akismet.com, they have an API that can be
implemented wherever you can use PHP (will submit the message to a server
and receive a true/false spam either if the mail is spam or not)

remember to send as much parameters as you have, you can read how to use it
from here:

http://akismet.com/development/api/


(it will not succeed 100 % of the cases but you will reduce significantly
the ammount of spam)

you could try with Akismet, www.akismet.com, they have an API that can be implemented wherever you can use PHP (will submit the message to a server and receive a true/false spam either if the mail is spam or not)

remember to send as much parameters as you have, you can read how to use it from here:

http://akismet.com/development/api/


(it will not succeed 100 % of the cases but you will reduce significantly the ammount of spam)

I have that problem with one of my sites.  If it's a human filling in the form with spam, there's nothing you can do to stop it.  I don't know how a robot would get through, though.

RSForms records the IP address.  Maybe you can block the IP addresses, especially if they're out of the country.

Subject: [joomla] question about RS!Form



Hi all,
 
I have RSForm installed on my client's 1.0.15 site, and he is getting spammed about 10 times a day, even with the captcha on.
 
On RSForm's site forums they mention this problem, with different 'solutions', has anyone else had this problem?
 
The problem is on the site: http://www.knowpci.com
 
Any ideas would be appreciated!
 
thanks,
Laura
