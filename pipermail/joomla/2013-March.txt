Hi Joomla Fans,

 

I am looking for a template to implement a left-column menu like the "see
All Categories" menu on http://www.discountmugs.com/.

 

I've been doing all my Joomla sites with Yootheme templates but don't see
one that does this fly-out of the second level as you roll-over the first
level.

 

It might also be nice if the template plays nice with K2 because I might be
using K2.

 

I'd appreciate any suggestions.  Paying for a template or template
subscription is totally acceptable.

I've never seen a template that had a flyout menu.? I've only seen flyout menus as part of a menu extension.

In the old days I used swmenufree and swmenupro.? There are probably others out there now.

That way you don't need to limit yourself to a template that includes it!? I know swmenu has styling options built into the configuration settings.? You say what color, how much padding, etc.

Ooops. My bad. I didn't read the whole post before I responded.

I did see the "View All Categories" menu mid-way down on the left side of
the page.

I have never a vertical menu like this built into a Joomla theme. It seems
like every fly-out menu is horizontal.

You might be better off sticking with Yootheme and making your own menu
using jQuery - you can find lots of neat vertical jQuery menus on the web
at places like DynamicDrive.com

Also, looks like a neat idea for a Joomla module - a fly away vertical menu.

You don't need to get the javascript code from dynamicdrive.? There are extensions that do that already. They've been around since 1.0.

Hello everyone,

 

I'm experimenting with the JCE "Insert New Layer" feature. It creates an
absolute positioned div on the page. Is anyone familiar with this feature?
Is it a good idea to use it?

 

 

Best regards,

As I mentioned in my previous post, swMenuFree and swMenuPro (http://swmenupro.com/) have been around for many years.? There may be some newer ones that I haven't used yet.

The flyout menu is shown here: http://swmenupro.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=41&Itemid=111
But don't be turned off by the style of the samples, they can be styled however you want in the configuration settings -- colors, padding, fonts, etc.

Subject: [joomla] Div versus Tables
Message-ID: <F1D36EECAA914EA98B717CA8B4BDC915@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone;

 

So far I have been using div's to divide the page (article), I go to "Toggle
Source Code" and create my div's and style them and so far so good. Now I
would like to divide my page/article into what could best be described as a
"newspaper" page style. With div's that could be a bit of a nightmare for
me. Would tables be the best choice? And if so, would the html/css goddess
reprimand me? 

 

I am using JCE extended version, formatting tables with it is not the
easiest or prettiest thing around. Is there a table creating extension that
you could recommend? 

 

Also is there an extension for dividing the page newspaper style (not k2
please). It would be ideal if I could divide and style my "featured
Articles" page, but that maybe too much to ask. Yes I did look at the JED,
besides k2 I didn't find much. K2 is to complex and specific. I just want to
div and style my page. 

 

 

 

No, at this stage I don't want to fiddle with the Joomla code. Are there any
extensions out there that would accomplish the task?

 

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Yes, you can add any valid HTML and CSS in the articles. Just toggle your editor so that instead of showing
the ribbons associated with the text editor you are using are turned off, and you will see just a plain boxed in area
where you can add html and css.?? To create a newspaper style page, I suggest using columns and floats to achieve
the desired effect.?

For a 'newspaper like page', I would consider using module positions and
'structure'.

For example what information do you actually want to display in each
column, such as, list of 'related items', images, etc...

Not sure what you mean by "structure". Can you elaborate?

Joomla 2.5.9

 

Working with JCE extended in article manger:

 

When I apply H1 tag to text it displays in black in article manager. However
when I click on view site H1 text displays in blue which is correct as per
template (artisteer). Unless I'm dreaming I though JCE had been displaying
the tags (h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6) with colors assigned to H tags in template. Is
anyone familiar whit this. Maybe I changed a setting in JCE?

 

 

Best regards,

Yes, there is a setting in JCE that allows you to use your template's style
sheet. I don't recall where it is, but I do believe it is documented fairly
well on the JCE website.

I second Matt's recommendation. It's hard to beat JCE.

If you're looking for one inside Joomla, definitely JCE.

If you need a desktop / external editor for non-Joomla reasons, I went with:

http://www.w3.org/Amaya/

Handy for local desktop HTML files (simple splash pages, etc.) and
supported by the WWW Consortium, so it *should* be compliant...

Hello,

I have a client who is using Joomla 3 as their administrator. I was wondering to make it easier for this non-technical client if their is a way to ONLY show Content and Menus and hide everything else from them to avoid confusion while they are logged into the CMS???
I see their are user access level controls but not a way to hide Joomla admin menu items while logged in.

Thanks,
Kenny

I wouldn't. I have tried both.

JCK is great but lacks a lot of features JCE does have.

JCK is entirely based on TinyMCE, while JCE is kind of a fork.

JCE's greateste features is document/image management, easiness on creating
a lightbox link and a K2 plugin that allows us to easily link to K2 content.

These are my thoughts.

JCE has a major advantage / feature, that no other editor I have found has.

In JCE, you can configure the available styles, to make use of the styles
in your site's template.  So if you define some custom styles in the CSS of
your template, you can use it in JCE.

You cannot use this in JCK, meaning you cannot see how your articles look
without saving them and looking them up on the web, first.

"Available Styles" well that is the reason I started to look around for a
different editor. I'm using artisteer to develop my templates and when I
apply styles such H1, H2 and son on the styles form the template do not
display in the editor I must save and view them on the browser. 

 

After looking at the JCE documentation it's not clear to me how to make use
of the styles in my template so they display in the editor. Can you help
with this?

 

 

 

Best regards,

Geoffrey, you said it right! The possibility of using CSS styles within the
editor window is fantastic!!!

Marcos, you can configure JCE to see your template.css file, though I don't
find this the best choice.

You REALLY need to know your CSS and how it works. Together with Firebug, a
Firefox add-on, you find the IDs and classes used by JCE within the editor
window, add them to your template.css file and BANG! True WYSIWYG in
Joomla!!

You can also make him a Publisher, so editing is done through the frontend.

Of course, he should receive the administrator username and password, just
in case.

And tell him/her the difference in plain and simple words: "use this
frontend access username and you'll never put your site offline!" That
usually does the trick!!

Hello everyone,

 

A search for "average font size of H tags" comes up with following;

 

1.	H1 = 24PX
2.	H2 = 22PX
3.	H3 = 18PX
4.	H4 = 16PX
5.	H5 = 12PX
6.	H6 = 10PX

 

Are those sizes reasonable?

================================================================

Assuming I set up my H tags in my template as per above. And in the article
I decide, for asthetics reasons, to change the size of H1 from 24px to 18px
and change the color to blue. It is still an H1 tag? No matter the size
change or that it's the same size as the H3? -

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Hi Marcos,

All this stuff is controlled by CSS. If you want to become a Joomla pro,
you need to learn about CSS and HTML. Once you master the basics of
CSS/HTML, you can do almost anything you want with Joomla. There are lots
of tutorials on the web. Just Google "CSS tutorial".

Check the CSS style sheet in the template and see what styles have been
assigned to the "H" tags. You can also find out the styles by using the
Firebug extension in Firefox.

Also, please, please! do NOT send out email to this list with a blank
subject line. It makes it difficult to sort and organize email.

All best,

Steve

Ops forgot subject line.

 

The question is not about css. The question is about average/standard/or
most current used size of H tags. And whether changing the style, be it the
size or color changes the value of H, 1,2,3,4,5,6.

There is really no "standard" size for "H" tags. If you look around Joomla
templates, you will see that some designers make H1, a 34pt font and some
go as high as 42pt. Some designer use px, some use em and some use pt.
There is no set way to use H tags (It would be great if there was a
standard.).

As I mentioned in the last message, you have to look at the style sheet or
if you are making your own template, set up your own rules. But you might
want to download a few templates and look the templates that come with
Joomla, like Beeze and see how they set styles for "H" tags.

I think what you are looking for is a forumla for design which is going to
depend on the design concept of the Joomla template's CSS. In general, the
H1 tags are largest and the H6 the smallest but they can vary greatly
depending on what the designer did in the CSS. This is also true of the
color as well.

HTML itself has a default value to use for the H tags, but most Joomla
templates override them using CSS to follow the art of the design.

If you look at a bunch of Joomla templates like those commercial found in
places like shape5.com, you will see the sizes vary to match the design.

Yes you're absolutely on the money (you both) is a question of design
concept. What about my second question? - If -in my css- my H1 tag is 26px
red and my H3 is 16px blue and in the actual article I decide to change the
H1 form 26px to 16px and change the color from red to blue in other words
same as H3 - I think it doesn't change the actual H1 value (in terms of seo)
even thought I changed style to same as H3? 

 

I hope am making sense.

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Hi Marcos,

 

All this stuff is controlled by CSS. If you want to become a Joomla pro, you
need to learn about CSS and HTML. Once you master the basics of CSS/HTML,
you can do almost anything you want with Joomla. There are lots of tutorials
on the web. Just Google "CSS tutorial".

 

Check the CSS style sheet in the template and see what styles have been
assigned to the "H" tags. You can also find out the styles by using the
Firebug extension in Firefox.

 

Also, please, please! do NOT send out email to this list with a blank
subject line. It makes it difficult to sort and organize email. 

 

All best,

 

Steve

Hello everyone,

 

A search for "average font size of H tags" comes up with following;

 

1.	H1 = 24PX
2.	H2 = 22PX
3.	H3 = 18PX
4.	H4 = 16PX
5.	H5 = 12PX
6.	H6 = 10PX

 

Are those sizes reasonable?

Changing the appearance of the Header tags will not change the fact that
they are headers, no.

In the HTML output, they will still appear as H1, H2, H3, etc.  The part
that determines what they look like, if it's in the CSS, won't even show up
in the HTML.

Just remember to stick to reason!  You don't want to make your H1 tiny and
unreadable, H2 to be bigger than H1, etc.

If you try to do keyword stuffing, by putting a bunch of Headers in a
document and then hiding them, Google might pick up on this and lower the
site's ranking.  But changing the color and size shouldn't matter, no.

In Joomla, the main controlling place for H tags, font color, size, etc is
in the CSS usually found in template.css in the template's directory. You
could use HTML in the Joomla Article to override the CSS, but there is an
easier option. You can define custom CSS to use which can be selected as a
Style in the editor.

Here is an example. I'm not using actual CSS syntax, just a way to explain
it:
So let's say you defined H1 as 26px with the color red in template.css for
the whole template so each time you do an H1, it produces that size and
color. Then you have custom situations where you want H1 to be 16x and the
color to be blue. You define custom CSS and give it some name like
H1BlueSmaller or a name which might have more meaning to its use such
as Testimonial_Header. Then within the Styles which you can select in the
editor you select Testimonial_Header for the highlighted text you want to
appear just as H1 16x and color blue.

Look up Joomla tutorials about creating custom CSS and styles. As I
mentioned, you could put this to override in the Joomla Article as HTML but
it becomes a mess and it doesn't go to helping build a library of the look
for the template.

Subject: Re: [joomla] H Tags

 

Changing the appearance of the Header tags will not change the fact that
they are headers, no.

 

In the HTML output, they will still appear as H1, H2, H3, etc.  The part
that determines what they look like, if it's in the CSS, won't even show up
in the HTML.

 

Just remember to stick to reason!  You don't want to make your H1 tiny and
unreadable, H2 to be bigger than H1, etc.

 

If you try to do keyword stuffing, by putting a bunch of Headers in a
document and then hiding them, Google might pick up on this and lower the
site's ranking.  But changing the color and size shouldn't matter, no.

Yes you're absolutely on the money (you both) is a question of design

red and my H3 is 16px blue and in the actual article I decide to change the
H1 form 26px to 16px and change the color from red to blue in other words
same as H3 - I think it doesn't change the actual H1 value (in terms of seo)
even thought I changed style to same as H3? 

 

I hope am making sense.

There is really no "standard" size for "H" tags. If you look around Joomla
templates, you will see that some designers make H1, a 34pt font and some go
as high as 42pt. Some designer use px, some use em and some use pt. There is
no set way to use H tags (It would be great if there was a standard.).

 

As I mentioned in the last message, you have to look at the style sheet or
if you are making your own template, set up your own rules. But you might
want to download a few templates and look the templates that come with
Joomla, like Beeze and see how they set styles for "H" tags.

The question is not about css. The question is about average/standard/or
most current used size of H tags. And whether changing the style, be it the
size or color changes the value of H, 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Hi Marcos,

 

All this stuff is controlled by CSS. If you want to become a Joomla pro, you
need to learn about CSS and HTML. Once you master the basics of CSS/HTML,
you can do almost anything you want with Joomla. There are lots of tutorials
on the web. Just Google "CSS tutorial".

 

Check the CSS style sheet in the template and see what styles have been
assigned to the "H" tags. You can also find out the styles by using the
Firebug extension in Firefox.

 

Also, please, please! do NOT send out email to this list with a blank
subject line. It makes it difficult to sort and organize email. 

 

All best,

 

Steve

If you visit my site > http://www.unitel.biz <http://www.unitel.biz/>  < and
Hover on HORIZONTAL menu PRODUCTS and click on SL1100 and go to bottom of

But, but , but.

 

Go back to home and hover over vertical menu and click on SL1100 (which goes

that page content somehow slipped underneath the pdf links. What gives?????

 

Hopefully someone may be able to help?

In article source code I have a couple of divs with some styling. I looked
at source code for page but don't see multiple html, head and body tags.

 

If you look at my code (attached notepad file) you'll see at the top of the
source code the following  

 

 <html>

<head></head><body> 

 

If that's what you're referring to JCE gives me that when I open a new page
- before I enter anything on page.

Or maybe it's because I'm using SP Tabs which is a module that appears with

Is your horizontal menu and vertical menu the same menu? or do you have
them as 2 separate menus in Joomla?

if they are separate, check your the menu item's page class.  If you have
the page class on one menu set but not on the other one, it could display
differently even though it's going to the same content.

I think before you start worrying about your pdf links you should first
clean the other code up - a list of errors can be found at the w3c
validation site -
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unitel.biz%2F
<http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unitel.biz%2F&charset=%2
8detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0>
&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0

Yes I see what you mean. Right below the <div class="custom" > entry is code
for the SP Tabs.   Every appearance of <div class="custom" > is an SP Tab>.
Hey I learned something today!

Yes they are two different menus. Can I have 1 menu for both horizontal and
vertical?

 

Where can I find the "menu item's page class".

Is your horizontal menu and vertical menu the same menu? or do you have them
as 2 separate menus in Joomla?

 

if they are separate, check your the menu item's page class.  If you have
the page class on one menu set but not on the other one, it could display
differently even though it's going to the same content.

Go back to home and hover over vertical menu and click on SL1100 (which goes

that page content somehow slipped underneath the pdf links. What gives?????

 

Hopefully someone may be able to help?

Yes that's it. If each menu has a different class when you view the source it will affect your CSS

Well you where right on the money. I have two menus - which artisteer
created - horizontal and vertical menu. I went to module manager, vertical
menu and changed Select Menu from vmenu to horizontal menu.

Problem disappeared.

 

Now is easier to deal with menu. Before I had to add same link to each menu
now its only one change to horizontal menu. Before the alias for each menu
item could not be same so I had to Mickey mouse with the link Type Options
in the Edit Menu Items. 

 

Thankx!!

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda
