Subject: [joomla] mosListMessenger hebrew?
In-Reply-To: <17E96ED2-480F-4B3F-A18F-15AF31BBA560@enorm2.com>
Message-ID: <003501c75e46$ba0ca120$6423a8c0@monsterxp>

Hi All!

 

            I'm working on a project for a client and he want to use
mosListMessenger but all his outgoing messages are in Hebrew. I've tried
messing around with the character set/encoding in mosListMessenger config
but there is no setting for hebrew (windows-1255) and all other settings
just convert his hebrew text to gibberish. Anyone have any suggestions?

 

Thank you,

Ben

Subject: [joomla] site path missing a 'dot' -- how to fix ?
Message-ID: <c2f754300703070819l4574d7d2x7ca92ba451e8b1cc@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

A joomla site I am working on has decided it wants to point to "127.0.01"
for the live site instead of "127.0.0.1"

(I am not sure what caused this, but of course it keeps it from serving
pages correctly.)

Under (global) configuration the live site address is readable but not
editable-- can someone tell me where on the back end I can add the required
dot back in?

Thanks to anyone who knows this one,

Forest
Compustretch at gmail.com

ps- I lost track of any upcoming Joomla meetups, planned or possible, but
still looking forward to a live get together with other Joomla-ers sometime!

Have you looked in configuration.php? Maybe mosConfig_live_site setting?

Thanks Ajai, the answer is no, I didn't look in configuration.php until
AFTER I had my coffee and also after I sent that email.

We apologise for any inconvience and return you to your regular programming.

Hello

My name is Lara Thynne and I am a PhD candidate at Deakin University
Australia.  I am currently researching the boundary between work and
leisure activities directly related to the open source community and
open source program development.

As part of this I am running a survey at the following address.

https://dcarf.deakin.edu.au/surveys/oss/

The survey is completely confidential and looks at your views and
motivations to use Open Source software and to participate in the
community.

It will only take a five to ten minutes to complete and your contact
details will not be recorded. You can withdraw your participation at
any stage.

I sincerely apologize for the spammish nature of this e-mail - I
don't mean to abuse this list.  I am trying to collect responses
from as many open source developers and users as possible and a
mailing list like can be the only way to reach many developers.

Thanks again

Lara

P.S The program that I am using is open source, of course
(www.phpsurveyor.org)!

Subject: [joomla] Site Server Migration ? (can't log in to Administrator

Message-ID: <c2f754300703300930q3a912190yb4733e3c2c8560d1@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

   I am attempting to migrate a Joomla site to a new server. After copying
over the root directory, and then copying over the mysql database, the site
is up and running on the new server, and registered users can log in. good.

   However when trying to log into the administration console it keeps
coughing, saying the session is expired. It does this for any of the
administrator accounts, and I have tried migration to more than one machine,
and it does the same thing.

   I've been all thru includes/joomla.php, but before I start tearing
anything apart (or tearing my hair out) I am wondering if anyone has
experienced this or knows the obvious reason for this behaviour I am
missing.

appreciatively,

-forest

ps- did anyone goto the php thing last night at Suspenders? I couldn't make
it, though it sounded fun!

I had the same problem once which turned out to be solved when i changed the
RG emulation value in Globals.php, hope this helps.

Thanks, I was just about to post that I had figured it out.

Has anyone been to Joomla Tuesdays? I notice the webpage still says NY
location TBA, even though they were supposed to have had a few already.

The next one is supposed to be on April 10th.

Anyone know about it?

cheers,

F.

Did you try deleting your browser Joomla cookies?

Problem solved as noted, but the interesting effect is that once it got a
session expired error on the backend, that cookie caused the front end to
not work. That did add a small wrinkle to troubleshooting the problem!
