Message-ID: <46B0BEE3.6080602@beezifies.com>

I was wondering if any NYC area Joomla users would be interested in 
having a monthly meeting or occassional adhoc meetups.

Been discussing this over on the Joomla forums, finally figured I'd bite 
the bullet and see what sort of interest there is, and what sort of 
space can be arranged.

If your interested, please fill out my polls at http://www.beezifies.com

If I'm reinventing the wheel here and there is a monthly meeting, please 
let me know!

Subject: [joomla] is there a better way to accomplish this?
Message-ID: <46B20E80.6080306@omnistep.com>

I implemented a design such that my com_content articles are enclosed in 
a lighter shade rounded-corners style box as can be seen in this example:
http://www.omnistep.com/joomlamods/

The css and html code to generate the rounded corners box was taken from 
http://www.spiffycorners.com/

To make this work across for the joomla content, I modified 
/content/com_content.html.php by hardcoding the css into the "function 
show()" script as can be seen below.
I thought this was kind of a dirty way to accomplish the task. Can 
anyone offer a better suggestion? I don't want to have to manually 
insert the rounded corner box html code when creating the articles. That 
would be too complicated for the end user content managers. Is there 
some sort of postfilter or mambot that can be used to accomplish this in 
more simple manner, perhaps one that would not require modifying the 
joomla source?

I would be interested, too.  I don't know where people are situated,  
but if Westchester County is convenient, we could offer space (at  
least occasionally) at St Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary

I'm not too familiar with it, but on a per content basis, you can go to 
Parameters and set a CSS suffix to be used for the page when the content 
item is displayed.

So if you set that suffix on a content item, you should be able to 
compare the source of content with and without it and locate the class 
that is set for the content item itself and style that with your rounded 
corners.

The difficulty is in the fact that the rounded corners can not be 
created purely in a css class, it requires insertion of some html 
objects (assigned the css classes) before and after the content to 
create the top and bottom of the rounder corner effect.

Ahh.. As I recall there are a number of javascript solutions for rounded 
corners that work on the class.  So you just need to give your content 
the appropriate class and have the javascript run onload(easily added to 
index.php) and it will go out and update all those content items for you.

If you really like this particular implementation of rounded corners for 
the way it looks, than I'd recommend modifying one of the java script 
solutions to implement this one.

Just a reminder, if your in or can come to NYC and are interested in 
having a monthly meeting, please vote in my poll so I can find out how 
many people are interested.

http://www.beezifies.com - Select the meeting poll at least, and if your 
interested in an adhoc get together, let me know what days are best.

So far only 7 people, including myself, have voted.  Thursday seems to 
be the best day.

Hans Zaunere from the NY PHP group was kind enough to reply to my post 
finding out about space to say the PHP group had office space available 
that we could meet at.  So it looks to me like a strong possibility that 
we can get a meeting going.

I'll run the current poll for a few more days to see if we can drum up 
any more interest, than run the top days past Hans for availability, and 
then put up a couple new polls to see which week is best for meeting for 
the top days(I guess it would go first Xday of the month, 2nd Xday of 
the month, 3rd Xday of the month and last Xday of the month?)

Also if the space is available, I'll see if we can go ahead and have an 
ad hoc meeting sooner so those who want to get together sooner can while 
we wait to settle on a day.

Well, there is definitely enough interest to have a meeting.  Right now 
after looking at the polls,  Thursdays look best. I've talked with Hans 
over at the <a href="http://www.nyphp.org/index.php">NY PHP group</a> 
and they have generously agreed to give us space on Thursdays evenings 
to host a meeting, so it's a good deal all around.(I'm sorry to those of 
you who indicated Thursday wasn't the best day. The next best day seems 
to be Saturday, so maybe once we are up and running we can have the 
occasional Saturday meeting somewhere as well. Hosting space is more 
problematic for Saturdays. And my daughter would kill me if I committed 
to give up one her days every month.so it will have to be occassional - 
or a family friendly locale)

The next poll is up to find out which week is best! So go fill it out!   
http://www.beezifies.com

If you have a suggestion on a place to meet informally, shoot me a 
contact using the <a 
href="http://www.beezifies.com/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;task=view&amp;contact_id=2&amp;Itemid=3">contact 
form</a>. If there are no suggestions, my own inclination would either 
be the lobby at the IBM Building (590 Madison Ave) or the Barnes and 
Noble in Union Square.

We will plan for our first official meeting to be next month, however 
THIS month is a summer party being hosted by the PHP Group!
"At 6:30pm on August 23rd, we&#39;ll be getting together on the roof-top 
lounge of The Delancey, in the Lower-East Side. The roof-top is a small 
piece of tropic serenity in Manhattan, with a relaxing fountain, lush 
plants, and a great view - and of course WiFi."

See their website, http://www.nyphp.org/index.php for more details. This 
seems like an excellent time for us to get together and have an initial 
meeting, as well as finalize the results from the next poll and see what 
day we want to meet.

Just a reminder everyone, we will be holding our first meeting on

as well as decide on a week of the month to meet.

If you can't make it, please vote in my poll so I have feedback from 
everyone(poll is on my site, http://www.beezifies.com)

I'd like to meet Joomla users of all skill levels, not just PHP geeks!  
I figure it is a good way for all of us to learn something, if nothing 
else the geeks can learn why our overlycomplicated little tools and 
snippets aren't used by anyone else, and the users can get an idea of 
just how complicated changes are.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla meetings, your feedback needed
Message-ID: <46BE58E6.80805@beezifies.com>

As some of you may be aware, I'm trying to get Joomla meetings going in NYC.

NYPHP will be providing space for us for a monthly Thursday meeting.
I've been running polls on my website(I have been setting it up lately
for my independent consulting work, since I have the space there anyway,
I figured might as well use it.)

 From the poll feedback, it looks like either the second or third week
of the month is likely to be the week of choice.

I will be at the NYPHP event on the 23rd of this month to meet people
interested in going to monthly meetings so we can finalize a week.

I have also setup a new poll, slightly longer this time, to get some
feedback on what types of presentations people are interested in.  For
the most part, I've listed things I have done, or am in the process of
doing, so if no one else wants to present I can at least plan on
reviewing something of interest to the people coming to the meeting(just
don't expect a "professional" presentation - I'll try to be informative
and not withhold "secrets" - as I've found most Joomla books seem to do.)

The polls are under NYC Joomla SIG on the menubar, and active polls are
displayed in the right hand menubar.  My website is http://www.beezifies.com

So go ahead an give me some feedback  - the only way we can do things
you find interesting is if you tell me what you want.

Hi,

I fell in love with Joomla about 10 months ago. I'd love to meet on the
23rd. I'm a non-PHP type. I went to a few NY-PHP meetings just to meet
Joomla people, but I didn't meet any. Where are we meeting? The Delancy at
6:30?

Yes, we will be combining the summer party with a meeting to get to meet 
other Joomla users and determine which week of the month we want to meet on.

Right now it looks like any week but the fourth.  My own leaning would 
be the second or third week of the month, only so that there will be at 
least a 3 week gap between the 23rd and the first official stand alone 
meeting.  In fact, I will try to send Hans a message later tonight to 
find out if any of those weeks would be a problem for starting in 
September(I'd like to start ASAP to keep the ball rolling)

I'd like to have some sort of presentation for the first independent 
meeting, so I'm soliciting feedback now for the types of presentations 
people are interested in.

I've primarily listed choices for items that I can speak to directly 
since I figure the chances of our getting anyone more experienced at 
speaking and willing to do so for the first month or two to be slim.

 From my own focus, the main idea would be to discuss how/what I did 
related to the topic with an existing website.  As what I've done there 
has covered the gamut of setting up a theme club template, modifying the 
template to accomodate specific needs(generally adding at least 2, if 
not more, module positions to the layout, as well as removing some 
"features" I am not enamored with myself, and making some changes to the 
layout of some of the module positions), installing and configuring a 
number of modules and components, debranding said modules(and setting up 
a credits page), integrating components together(primarily making a 
component aware/use the secrurity settings of a subscription module as 
well as making custom components and integrating them with the original 
components), and creating a component.

I've found that with Joomla, while all of the above might sound like a 
lot of work, it tends to be a lot less as you only have to deal with 
small, manageable bites at a time - as well as being able to borrow at 
least 75% of my code from existing modules(this does have copyrwrite 
implications)


I'm not sure how other people feel about theme clubs, my own feeling is 
that while I COULD do the same thing, provided I wanted to spend the 
time doing it(over a week to do for a decent layout).  At the end, I'd 
have a decent Generic template tuned for a specific need.  With an 
established template club, I get at least half a dozen templates for 
different purposes, for minimal cost(there is the issue of picking a 
template club, though.  As there is a great amount of reuse from 
template to template.  I've seen sites with over 50 templates, that when 
I really look at them turn out to be variations on 2 or 3 templates with 
different graphics and color schemes.  I don't want 50 templates, but I 
do want at least 5 unique templates that are generic enough to be used 
on many different sites).    I still end up modifying and changing it 
quite a bit, but time wise it turns a large project into a manageable 
one.  (and to be honest, their ui design skills are better than my own, 
so why not leverage it?)

I've only dealt with 1 theme club, so how that compares to others I 
don't know.  I do find the community of the theme club has been very 
helpful when it comes to layout and presentation.  Moreso than the 
general Joomla community . I can understand the difference, as a 
programmer, I find layout and presentation to be mindnumbingly boring 
and I have little interest in making minor positioning changes.  What's 
worse, is when someone comes along who is clearly getting paid to do all 
this and than demands free help on a forum.   With the theme club, 
everyone there is doing it commercially so they lack the general 
attitudes you find on GPL focused forums.  And the employees of the club 
itself are amazingly helpful in handling things outside the scope of the 
template itself. 


If I want coding help regarding a component, I ask on a component 
forum/  If I want layout help, I ask on a theme club forum.  If I want 
general coding help, I ask on the Joomla forums and don't get any replies.

(and keep in mind, when I say help, I don't mean "write my code for 
me".  I mean: I would like integrate this component/extend some 
functionality.  What is the API or function call for the base function I 
should be using/modifying.)

Thanks for all the info. I filled out your survey about presentations. I use
a template club, just because I don't know how to write a template. I've
learned enough to make some adjustments to templates. It's true that there
end up being sites that look very similar.


Anyway, I'll see you on the 23rd, then.

One thing I'm finding increasingly frustrating with Joomla is the lack 
of documentation on how to code for Joomla.

I spend half an hour hunting through the Joomla site, and then I 
remember that Joomla(ver 1.0.x) is a fork of Mambo - so most of the 
documentation is on Mambo, not Joomla.

Though even there, documentation seems pretty sparse at times.

Am I missing the obvious or is there just no good Joomla dev docs?  
(This does appear to be rectified with 1.5, but I just started with 
Joomla and I had a few must have components that weren't even going to 
try to make 1.5 versions untill the API got finalized.  Justifiably 
since they had spent time working towards one API that was scrapped.)

Right now, I'm not even bothering to look at 1.5 untill it reaches 
maturity and is out for while.  It has a lot of gee whiz features I 
like, but I don't want to be the one to find the bugs on production 
client sites.

I have to totally agree here, the docs are basically awful.

Also, up until now there were no decent books either... Apress have 
recently published a book which is a good start.

There is a new Forum on the Joomla site specifically for developers who are
starting to code for Joomla called Joomla coding 101. 

http://forum.joomla.org/index.php?board=452.0

Lot's of people willing to help.

I get the impression that the people on that forum are really interested 
in discussing 1.5, not 1.0.x

Don't get me wrong, 1.5 is a massive leap forward in terms of making 
Joomla developer friendly, so I can see why a lot of people are jumping 
there.

But I tend towards cautiousness, 1.0.12 works and is well supported.  I 
see no reason to upgrade until the 3rd party extentions are there for it.

However, that does lead to a problem as the tips exchanged for 1.5 won't 
work for 1.0.12  - and writing code in a 1.0.x format for 1.5 is a 
monumental waste of time.

Subject: [joomla] Where to post new extentions?
Message-ID: <46C2D8D1.5030200@beezifies.com>

I'm just curious, what are the good places to post news about new 
components?

On my own plate, I've got the following I'm working on:

A Smarty Mambot library(to use smarty in other components)
An extensive set of modifications for the AdsManager component
***Using Smarty to display ads to give me more control over layout
***Enhancing the search functions
***Using Smarty to display search results
***Better Community Builder integration(AdsManager to CB)
***Better CB integration(CB to AdsManager)

A CB Plugin(this one is really really stupid)
A function to register userids(basically, all I'm doing is taking the 
userid creation function and rewriting it so it can be called from 
outside CB itself.  As an example, AdsManager will create a userid when 
they post an ad if the user doesn't have one - if you enable it.  But 
the way it does it sucks, it bypassing all the CB functions and just 
creates an approved user profile.  If I can get the user reg functions 
seperated, I can then call them and use all that good functionality.

A Virtuemart shipping calculation module
(speciality Australian shipper using a web API)

A Lightbox mambot
(see recent post to the Joomla forums.  Lightbox/Slimbox in Joomla is a 
stupid way of implementing lightbox.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's 
great that developers added this function to different bits of code, but 
they keep repeating themselves and stepping on each others toes - plus 
they push work the server is perfectly capable of doing onto the client)

An alt text mambot(a lot of modules post images with no alt text.  From 
SEO professionals, I've been told alt text is a good place to shove 
keywords for search engines.  So why not post process the page and 
update your keywords?)

An ecards component(I'm really hoping to find a good one that I can use 
so I don't need to fiddle with this one)

A page cleanup mambot(just a general mambot to run to clean up the 
source of the page before it goes out.  Configurable by the user for 
what to clean.  I'm thinking things like:
Check for duplicate javascript libraries and remove the duplicates.
Check for specified tags and remove them(like a certain extentions ugly 
little ads)
Strip HTML comments and compress the page down in size.
Configure it to replace lines of CSS code with a combined file(ie if 
your using 5 CSS stylesheets in a page, have a configuration where you 
enter those 5 sheets and the mambot will replace the include with 1 
include of a file which combines all 5 sheets, in the order you specify, 
and compresses them)

Most of the big items I'm doing for a project anyway.  The little items 
just look good to do. I think someone else posted an idea here for a 
mambot that looked pretty simple that I was thinking of doing as time 
allows.

Most devs like coding... documentation is boring :)

Its also a very different skill/brain set.

This seems to be a symptom of a volunteer project that is still in its 
infancy....

I would love to do that but would have to focus on 1.5. I haven't
really worked with 1.0 in quite a long time, and also think that once
folks understand what 1.5 brings to the table everyone will adopt it
as the series of choice.

Heh. Well, many years ago, when Ronald Reagan was still president, the
techs that worked in the server room were referred to as "monkeys". As
I was the strangest of the bunch, they claimed I was a "monkey from
space", which eventually simplified itself to "spacemonkey". I haven't
lived it down since.

Nice to hear my tip helped you out, and welcome your webmaster to the
linux world :-)

Chicken! Ok, seriously, this is going to be a somewhat painful period
for some folks as there will of course be a delay between the
extensions being available for 1.5, coupled with the unbridled
enthusiasm of the developer community wanting to work solely on the
1.5 series. I can only hope that we can channel that unbridled
enthusiasm to get those extensions ported (or even better) ASAP.

I'm also wanting to do a workshop on framework application
development, as I'm currently involved in creating a high-traffic
website based on the 1.5 framework that gets 40+ million page views
every week. Not only is this a great candidate to discuss development
of framework applications, but it also makes a great subject for
high-scaling Joomla websites in general.

I hope to attend the first Joomla/NYPHP meet but I will be coming back
from playing a concert and don't know if I will be able to make it :-(
If it is at all possible, I'll be there though :-)

If you host your development on JoomlaCode, you can make an
announcement there, as well as making an announcement on the Joomla
News site, the Joomla Extensions Directory, and (depending on your
license) the Joomla forums.

I could announce it on my blog as well, but other than my Mom it won't
generate too much traffic for you ;-)

Honestly I can only think of a very few projects that have adequate
documentation, let alone great documentation. The biggest problems are
compounded:

* The code changes quickly
* The people that write documentation are usually not developers, and

How about a series on what the difference is between 1.5 and 1.0.12 
programming.

A lot of it seems to remain the same.  The big difference seems to be 
where in 1.0.12 you do table lookups to make certain determinations, 
Joomla 1.5 has added a bunch of API's.  That and the whole idea of 
turning it into an event driven system. 

But outside of certain items, event driven systems are overblown and 
often used just to be used.  The more events that need to be checked, 
the more the system get's bogged down.  But where it makes sense, it 
shines(the user events system makes me drool, it would be soooo perfect 
to integrate Joomla with Kickapps as an example.  I'm seriously 
considering setting up one 1.5 site just to do that)

I for one would appreciate knowing what is in 1.5 for developers, as 
while I might not use it, if I know that there is a function that does 
X, than rather embed code that does X in my own code - I'll make it a 
function call so it is easy to swap out with the 1.5 code to upgrade.

I think 1.5 brings a lot to the table, but I'm not gonna wait for them 
to get developers to upgrade, especially since the Joomla team seems to 
have down a good job of annoying a bunch of developers for no reason 
other than stupidity(there was no reason to get involved in a 
philosophical war.)

What I do find amusing though is I keep seeing 'that's on the table for 
1.6" for ideas I'm looking to do in 1.0.  Ain't gonna wait for them to 
get that finalized either.  I'll do my own thing and than play catch up 
when their ready(and of course their free to take my thing and polish it 
up and make it 1.5 compliant and turn my code into decent code if they want)

Anything I do is built on the works of others, so it's GPL, I don't see
a reason to change the license.  At the most, I will license some of it
as LGPL just because it makes since and it will surely irritate some
people who have a different opinion than me about how the GPL license
works. :-)

However, I won't host development on Joomlacode.  I take certain aspects
of the GPL seriously, wheras most developers don't, and for me an
anonymouse download such as Jomlacode is an unacceptable moral burden.
And Joomla has this whole bug up their tush about trying to define what
is commercial and what is not, what is open and what is closed.  I'd
rather just avoid the whole thing and do things my way. :-)

I dont mean to pick on Joomla (though it has caused me to click endlessly 
on the developer and docs site trying to find something). But what 
would be more useful (and maybe easier from a documentation standpoint), 
is to have both a wiki and a code snippets site. Sometimes its better 
to have a piece of code showing an example rather than several pages of 
explanation. A wiki / snippet is also easier to update for both developers 
and documentors.

Im using symfony (symfony-project.com) in my day job - not only does the 
symfony site have excellent docs (the Apress book is available online) but 
they have forums, a wiki, a snippets site, some excellent tutorials and 
examples, as well as the usual news feeds and a blog. I have an old site 
originally built in Mambo which Im considering rebuilding in symfony 
purely because I know it will be easier to find the information I need 
rather than for Joomla.

Im sure Joomla has many more developers than for symfony which makes it 
all the more galling.

Message-ID: <43186900-58D4-4C23-BC44-A43E69FC46EB@comcast.net>

I was talking to a friend of mine who is a Linux admin who I have  
introduced to Joomla. He had some suggestions, which may or may not  
be in the works, but I wanted to share them. If there is a more  
direct place to make such suggestions please kindly let me know. :-)

There should be a movement to include Joomla as an extra for the  
Fedora distributions (and other Linux such as CentOS). Installing it  
with an RPM and during system setup would bring over a lot of people.

For example, Fedora 7 installed the latest version of MediaWiki  
during his last installation. MW is probably more difficult to  
install than Joomla.

It would also be very helpful for it to install by default with the  
demo data for Joomla including handling the creation of the MySQL  
database.

While many of us consider an installation of Joomla to be a simple  
thing, if it were already there it is more likely that the users  
would try it out.

Why not build an RPM for FC?

Packages do exist for other distros (Gentoo has an ebuild which uses the 
excellent webapp-config tool). But I dont think its a good idea to have 
those be part of the core packages though.

I cannot talk for the folks working on the 1.6 series, but I hear the
extended ACL is already in a waiting state for 1.5 to get finished.
I'm personally working on PDO integration and as soon as that is done
we can support multiple databases - even if it is not added to the
core for the 1.5 series.

Just having an error class makes me drool. Think about integrating
Joomla with systems management tools, so Joomla can send a message to
your management console "Hey man, somebody broke this menu link..."
Nice.

Of course there's the Joomla forums, there's a board there for you to
make such suggestions:

We're already taken care of with common control panels like Plesk and
such, and that should take care of the people that cannot install
Joomla on their own. If you cannot figure out how to install Joomla,
chances are you aren't managing your server at the operating system
level either - you got a control panel.

Problems I've had in the past was that everyone wants to install their
Joomla site in a different directory, and an RPM doesn't make that all
that easy. It can be done, but it might be more complicated than just
untarring the archive where you want it and running the web installer.

OK, here is something driving me crazy:
I can set a Module to only be displayed on 3 menus.

That works fine.

I can also have a module that shows the latest X.  For example, the

That works fine.

The problem is when I have a module that should be displayed on certain 
menus, take the Joomla SIG for example.  And I have another module that 
displays quick links to deeper content, say the list of Polls on my website.

If you click on the list of polls on the right, it takes you to the item 
- but it also leaves the module display in the same place it was before 
you clicked, it doesn't change to the Joomla SIG display options.

So, what am I missing?

Since you associated the Modules to a menu, when you click on the Module 
Item there is no effect to the Menu structure, I had a similar issue and 
had to hack the Module to make menu changes as well.

How do you do that?

I am assuming there is some function where you can "assign" what menu 
link is being displayed, so than at the top of a module you have to 
specify the menu item being displayed?

Ok, and I know why I'm up at 3AM but why is anyone else that crazy?

Do you have a sample site with this issue up?  It has been some time since 
I wrote that hack.

How do you do that?

I am assuming there is some function where you can "assign" what menu 
link is being displayed, so than at the top of a module you have to 
specify the menu item being displayed?

Ok, and I know why I'm up at 3AM but why is anyone else that crazy?

Ok, I think I see the problem now:

In joomla.php there is a function called mosMenuCheck.

When it's done doing it's thing, it calls $mainframe->set('menu',X) and 
tells Joomla what menu item is being displayed.

So I'm assuming what you did was add to the module being displayed a 
$mainframe->set('menu',X).

Hmmm.......

Perhaps I could extend mosMenuCheck and add an extra paremeter.  So that 
on the links coming IN if you placed ?dspmenu="Polls" for example, it 
would force a fake to the Polls menu.

Than I would need to find some way of forcing a component or module to 
add that paremeter to all it's URL's.

Which brings me back to modifying every module and many components to 
add in an option to display "pretend to be menu" field.

Or maybe it would make more sense to have a Mambot which can be 
configured to check all the url's on the page, and based on it's 
configuration, append the parameter to them where it's useful.

Ehhh...what a bad set of choices, either hack core Joomla files or hack 
every module I want to make this change to.

OMG, I've actually discovered a point in time where it would be usefull 
to program in an object oriented fashion.  If I could override that 
function instead of changing it, I wouldn't need to hack the core file.  
Heck has frozen over. :-)

I have nothing but a sample.

What I tried to do, is I wanted the Joomla latest news stuff to only 
appear on the frontpage, and when your in the Joomla sections.

What ends up happeneing is if you switch your menu context to someplace 
it doesn't show, than click on any Joomla menu choice - latest news 
shows.  If you click on a poll link I just got that working using a 
dummy menu item hack.  If you click on the Joomla article categories, it 
doesn't show.

I think I could use the menu hack there as well... I'm not sure yet.

Something like that.  I only had to do this for one Module.  What you 
trying to have is a module that will display a Module and have menu Module 
results as well.   Maybe we will talk about this at the meeting...

Moreso I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.  It isn't an issue for 
me yet.

I was making some tweaks to AdsManager and someone else needed to get 
ArtioSEF working.  I had recently done it on my site, but couldn't 
remember precisely what I did(I had my changed file, but what changes 
where simply to get it to work, and what changes were for my own custom 
needs?)

So I gave him the bits and pieces of code I thought he needed to make 
the sef file compatible with ArtioSEF and he tested it out.  Worked 
fine.  He then brought up this module issue which I had noticed as well.

For his particular case, he could do it at the top of the AdsManager 
component and be fine(I think).

The trick with the fake itemid menu won't work because adsmanager 
doesn't really HAVE itemids(0 and 1 as far as I can see.  0 won't work, 
and 1 will hit a bunch of other components).

Subject: [joomla] Speaking of SEF
Message-ID: <46C571B1.2040908@beezifies.com>

In 1.0.12 I'm rather unhappy with how SEF has been implemented.

It is good as far as it goes, but than it hits a brick wall.

Take AdsManager for example and ArtioSEF for example.

ArtioSEF has some default rules for a bunch of files.  It also allows 
you to install extention specific SEF files.

Those SEF files will translate urls according to internal, hardcoded rules.
So, for example, AdsManager translates a directive to show an ad into 
the ugly:
/com/adsmanager/page/cat/<catname>/show_ad/<headline>-<adid>.html

Now, as a generic SEF program, this makes sense.  Lowest common 
demoniator and all.

What annoys me is I don't see a mechanism within ArtioSEF to allow a 
plug in to have configurable options(am I missing it?)

For example, in my case, I wasn't using the headline field, I did not 
want to stick numbers onto each url, and I most definitely did NOT want 
such a long url.

I built up a little switch statement to reduce the url to:
/<catname>/s/<something>.html

Where <something> is dependent on the category id.

This means that for one class of users, instead of sending their URL 
with a long meaningless string to others, they can send 
http://www.mydomain.com/fighterprofile/s/nickname.html

(I'm considering shortening it even further to just use initials for the 
category name).

My main point though is that most of this should have the possibility of 
being configured in the admin pane itself.

Am I missing something in ArtioSEF and does it give such a capability to 
developers?  I don't object if no one uses it, as it is extra work for 
little gain, but having it there would make me feel better.

(Ok Mitch, feel free to tell me how in 1.5 all these sort of functions 
are built right into Joomla...  though I seem to recall reading some 
threads a few months back and they still seemed stuck on using user 
meaningless but unique data.  The idea of having just a simple field 
where someone can enter what they think the shortname for the item 
should be seemed to be foreign to them.   Actually, my impression is 
that with Joomla most of the developers seem fixated on making processes 
which are automated without user intervention.  Good as a general 
design, but why make it as the only option?)

Absolutely - both 1.0 and 1.5 have examples. Which version are you using?

Hey Gary, I just wanted to tell me how in 1.5 all these sort of
functions are built right into Joomla...

*rimshot*

Ok seriously - even in the 1.0 series there are SEF extensions that
provide the means for you to define an arbitrary URL scheme that gets
translated into internal gobbledygook (index.php?blah=1&foo=bar)...

I don't understand what you're missing, or what you're trying to do
that these cannot accomplish. Am I missing something?

I'm about to undertake the buildout of 3 Joomla backed sites, and 1 of them
will involve quite a bit of custom module development.  I'm looking for
experienced Joomla hackers to fill a variety of roles from Senior Developer
to Project Manager, or even just to drink some beers with me and review my
approach and muse about silver bullets that Joomla might have in store for
me.

Please feel free to contact me off list if you are looking for Joomla or PHP
work, or just want to kick the tires on what we're building.

I'd love to kick off a thread of 'Joomla gotchas' from our collective
experiences using Joomla.

I'll start:
Joomla isn't great with REALLY big numbers of pages and/or categories.
Things to look out for:
I was using Joomla 1.0.11 a while back with OpenSEF.  I had a pile of issues
with my site and the time it took for page loads with 20,000+ pages in my
site.  I tracked it down to a faulty design in how the OpenSEF stuff was
loading , caching (or failing to), and rewriting site friendly urls in my
pages.  I posted some bug fixes on the OpenSEF site and I think the problem
as been resolved.  What didn't get resolved, and I'm anxious to check out
the 1.5 stuff to see if it has, is that when you are on the admin side of
things, lots of categories means HUGE drop down lists.  One of my sites had
30K plus categories, and it rendered the admin inoperable as it was trying
to load a category select list of 30K items on a bunch of the admin pages.
One thing that helped my pages load MUCH faster was enabling query caching.
With Joomla, sometimes with all your plugins, and 3rd party modules, you are
using 'sub-optimal' code, and sometimes queries get run repeatedly on a
page, or across a session.  With most sites, where content isn't really
changing that much, turning on query caching in MySQL helped a bunch in
speeding up page load times, especially with very large numbers of pages and
categories.

Thanks for any advice you may have,

This Thursday, make sure you attend the NYPHP meetup at The Delancey -
there will be the first NYC Joomla meet. I'm hoping to be there.

> Joomla isn't great with REALLY big numbers of pages and/or categories.

That's not entirely correct - Joomla is great at handling lots of
content and lots of categories, it is the admin interface that isn't
really suited for it (by default, that is).

Perhaps it is time to create a second Administrator Template that uses
a different method to display and browse long lists, as opposed to
monster dropdowns that kill your browser... :-)

There's quite a few things you can do to tune up a busy Joomla site,
and MySQL query caching is just the start.  An even bigger performance
increase can be found with PHP accelerators like XCache, APC and
eAccelerator. And when you go to 1.5, it's almost required as
everything is heavy on objects, and therefore gets the biggest boost
out of a cache and accelerator.

With memcached available in the 1.5 series, you can now cluster your
Joomla sites across many systems without too much effort.

*spacemonkey smells another article coming

And one quick note on the query cache - that's no good on community
style sites, as the tables are changing too rapidly for MySQL's cache
to be very effective. It is wicked fast on more typical,
corporate-style sites though.

Is there anything that is great with REALLY big numbers of anything, by 
default out of the box?

Anything can be made to work depending on how much effort you want to 
put into it, the financial requirements, and the simplicity of a user 
interface that you need.

Heck, if you have infinite money, store everything in memory and that 
will speed up your performance a good bit. :-)

Nope. That's the point. However, unlike a lot of platforms, the
solution in this case with Joomla is to just make some modifications
to the admin template - and maybe customize one or two admin
components. Not exactly a budget-busting effort, especially on a
project for a website that supports a bajillion users/pages/widgets...

Why yes, looks like you finally got it. Memcache it is!

Subject: [joomla] Embed PHP in Joomla's HTML?
Message-ID: <401B0F64-1DD0-42D6-8FF8-97A8F2D5436E@comcast.net>

I am converting an HTML based web site to Joomla 1.5RC1. In the body  
of the HTML, it has about 10 lines of PHP code which grabs a number  
from another web site so it can display this number in the middle of  
a sentence. Something like, "...with the current member now at 810  
members...". The number 810 is grabbed from an external web site  
which gets updated when the number of members increases or decreases.

OK, I thought about how this might be done. One was to write a Joomla  
Module to do the PHP, but didn't want to deal with the formatting of  
the rest of the article to make it look like a natural one that  
Joomla does so well.

The other idea, is that I went to Edit the article and select for it  
to display HTML. I then inserted the PHP code such as:
<?PHP

php code goes here
?>

I saved that and proceeded to reload the page in Joomla and no output  
was generated from the PHP code. I returned to the article, had it  
display HTML once again, and my PHP I included was gone.
Now I never did this before in Joomla 1.x, so I don't know if insert  
PHP is supported in this manner or not.

Q: Can PHP be embedded into the body of text in Joomla as I described  
above to carry out its task?

Q: Should I be forced to write a module and include the whole article  
inside the module just to do the PHP?

Q: Is there a more clever Joomla-like way to accomplish this in the  
manner similar to how mosimage (jpgs) are inserted into the body of  
text, but executed a PHP script?

Q: And what of Timmy, trapped in the well with Lassie distracted by a  
ripped box of vanilla flavored Frosty Paws?  that fell off the truck?  
When will help ever arrive? :-)

Thanks in advance,

Well, there are mambots for doing that.  I'm not sure
if it's 1.5 compatible, but check this out for a
start...

By default, Joomla is not going to run PHP code embedded in articles.  
Remember the security structure is based on the magazine format of security.

IE you have readers, authors, and editors
And then you have managers, admins, and the super admin

Your authors and editors are trusted to write articles not code.  If you 
let them write code, they could really muck up the system.

So in answer to the first question, yes you should be forced to write a 
module or do something else deliberately to bypoass this security.

Well, a clever way to avoid writing module after module just for small 
tasks is to use Jumi.
http://www.vedeme.cz/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=10&id=41&Itemid=123

Jumi is a swiss army knife of a module, where you can embed various bits 
and pieces of code to make numerous custom modules using Jumi.

Alternatively, if you want to place it in the content, than use a PHP 
running mambot.

Lastly, if you want to place it on every page in a specific spot, you 
can edit the index.php file for your template and place your code there.

I use the kl_php mambot (http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=39551)  to include php in content items:

{kl_php} ...some php code... {/kl_php}

or write the php code in a file, then include the file wherever I want it.

NYC Joomla Special Interest Group
First Monthly Meeting,  August 23rd 2007

Summary:
Between half a dozen and a dozen Joomla users and coders met at
the summer event hosted by the NYPHP group and we
got to exchange tips and talk about Joomla.

For lack of any objection, we settled on the third Thursday
of the month.  So out next meeting will be Sepetember 20th,
2007 at the NYPHP office in Manhattan(55 Broad Street).

I would like to begin at 6PM so we have time to cover 2 presentations 
for different types of members.  So our developer presentation would 
begin between 6:30 and 7:00.

Thanks to everyone who replied to my posting.

I installed the plugin and the module. So far, I have not been able  
to get the plugin to work. The module works fine, and prints out  
"hello world" as a module. But any attempts to insert code into an  
article such as:

{kl_php} echo "Hello out there"; {/kl_php}

outputs this:

{kl_php} echo "Hello out there"; {/kl_php}

I did see the suggestion on the Mambo forum that the editor might be  
inserting some formatting. So I selected No Editor, and tried it  
again not allowing any sort of HTML to reformat this little bit of  
instruction and the results were the same. The System Legacy plugin  
was enabled.

Wondering at this point if it might be Joomla 1.5rc1, I installed  
just the mambot plug-in and enabled it with Joomla 1.0.12 and then it  
worked!

OK, I want to be a good citizen here within the Joomla community and  
report this so it will work with Joomla 1.5. I would like some advice  
here, since I know this isn't part of the Joomla core. What is the  
best way to proceed? Post to a Joomla forum? Contact the authors (see  
below), but which one since this isn't a Mambo concern?

Did lassie ever show up? Is timmy still trapped in the barn? The guy  
that developed klphp has been awol for quite some time, I don't know  
if he was around for the transition to joomla 1.0.xxx

Here are a couple fo links if you want try and track him down.

Here is the original thread for the mambot release

http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=39551&highlight=konlong

On a side note, would be kind of nice to include this functionality  
in the core of Joomla and say, let the super admin decide what level  
of user can use it.

If that's what it's outputting then you probably didn't publish the mambot.

Subject: Re: [joomla] Embed PHP in Joomla's HTML?

Thanks to everyone who replied to my posting.

I installed the plugin and the module. So far, I have not been able to get the plugin to work. The module works fine, and prints out "hello world" as a module. But any attempts to insert code into an article such as:


{kl_php} echo "Hello out there"; {/kl_php}


outputs this:


{kl_php} echo "Hello out there"; {/kl_php}


I did see the suggestion on the Mambo forum that the editor might be inserting some formatting. So I selected No Editor, and tried it again not allowing any sort of HTML to reformat this little bit of instruction and the results were the same. The System Legacy plugin was enabled.


Wondering at this point if it might be Joomla 1.5rc1, I installed just the mambot plug-in and enabled it with Joomla 1.0.12 and then it worked!


OK, I want to be a good citizen here within the Joomla community and report this so it will work with Joomla 1.5. I would like some advice here, since I know this isn't part of the Joomla core. What is the best way to proceed? Post to a Joomla forum? Contact the authors (see below), but which one since this isn't a Mambo concern?

Subject: [joomla] Embed PHP in Joomla's HTML?

I am converting an HTML based web site to Joomla 1.5RC1. In the body  
of the HTML, it has about 10 lines of PHP code which grabs a number  
from another web site so it can display this number in the middle of  
a sentence. Something like, "...with the current member now at 810  
members...". The number 810 is grabbed from an external web site  
which gets updated when the number of members increases or decreases.

OK, I thought about how this might be done. One was to write a Joomla  
Module to do the PHP, but didn't want to deal with the formatting of  
the rest of the article to make it look like a natural one that  
Joomla does so well.

The other idea, is that I went to Edit the article and select for it  
to display HTML. I then inserted the PHP code such as:
<?PHP

php code goes here
?>

I saved that and proceeded to reload the page in Joomla and no output  
was generated from the PHP code. I returned to the article, had it  
display HTML once again, and my PHP I included was gone.
Now I never did this before in Joomla 1.x, so I don't know if insert  
PHP is supported in this manner or not.

Q: Can PHP be embedded into the body of text in Joomla as I described  
above to carry out its task?

Q: Should I be forced to write a module and include the whole article  
inside the module just to do the PHP?

Q: Is there a more clever Joomla-like way to accomplish this in the  
manner similar to how mosimage (jpgs) are inserted into the body of  
text, but executed a PHP script?

Q: And what of Timmy, trapped in the well with Lassie distracted by a  
ripped box of vanilla flavored Frosty Paws?  that fell off the truck?  
When will help ever arrive? :-)

Thanks in advance,

Try using this native Joomla 1.5 mambot

To Use:
encase php code with 
{php}SomePHP Code;{/php}
OR include a file with
{phpfile}/path/to/some/php/file.php{/phpfile}

I wonder if my atachement came through... I wrote a

It restricts it to articles authored by Admins or

Lassie was a no-show, however Anthony Ferrara showed up and saved the  
day. (More on that later). Timmy, oddly enough using a stolen  
Blackberry was cranking out text messages and was finally rescued and  
as you would guess, arrested for being in receipt of stolen property.

I agree, this would be a wonderful featured to have support in  
Joomla's core for 1.5 and beyond. I also like the idea of letting the  
super admin decide what level can use it. Hopefully it can also be  
used regardless of what editor is selected in Global Configuration,  
or at least have an easy way to toggle between them. Or have some  
icon displayed to let the person editing the document that it  
contains embedded PHP code.

Thanks so much for writing this and making it available for Joomla  
1.5, Anthony Ferrara!

I downloaded, installed it in Joomla 1.5rc1 and it works!

I tested it as {php} with some PHP code and also including a .php  
file as {phpfile} and worked with no problems. Good job!
I also like the idea of having {php} for inserting code and {phpfile}  
for file includes.
