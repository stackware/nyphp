Subject: [joomla] Advice on calling video player
Message-ID: <CAAUuzMTh-07bsWgy9gBwK106+PuSGN28T0WNAy25cKAuzRif7A@mail.gmail.com>

Folks

   I'd like to call a video player from a module link and have it appear in
my chosen position on the page, *without redrawing the page. *I I want my
player to appear in a chosen position (think mid-right) overwriting what is
currently in that position (probably, an earlier player.)

   In other words, I want my video player to appear on a given position on
the screen when I call it from another module. Widgitkit does something
similar (and is great) but I need a little more flexibility because I need
to create a special menu according to my client's request.

   I know this is possible in javascript but I'm hoping there's something
that will avoid my writing js code.

   It may be that a megamenu could instead do what I want. Has anyone had a
good experience with one to recommend that's highly flexible?

  All help and pointers appreciated.

AFTER the module has been loaded in the page, check any tag, css classes or
id's that might help you accomplish that.

I've done it more than once.

The preliminary schedule for our 2 day JoomlaDay NYC has been posted! We
still have room for movement on the schedule with the exciting
possibilities of last minute additions. Take a look at the speaker and
topic lists - this promises to be a very interesting weekend with great
speakers, workshops, and plenty of time to network.

Registration is open - purchase your one or two day tickets online.  I
think you will want to attend both sessions. And remember - there is
something for everyone - from the most advanced Joomla users to beginners.

Consider sponsoring our JoomlaDay NYC. Each sponsorship helps us bring
excellent speakers to NYC, which we all know is a very expensive
destination. You will see your company name and a link on our website - and
so will many, many of others.

Check back to the site to see our additions.

Subject: [joomla] Test your passwords
Message-ID: <CAC4OfRgovz=-iYDQ+u=41UHHaVDBZ3ED=BN5Ta=0wkGTm+9ExA@mail.gmail.com>

Think your Joomla! password is secure?  Here is a simple test[assuming it
is under 15 charectors long]

Go to http://hashcat.net/hashcat-gui/ and download hashcat-gui for your
operating system.

To check just YOUR password, run the gui , use either plus or lite, and
enter your password hash[from the database] in the field.  Select the
Joomla hash type - and then go ahead and run the cracker.   See how long it
takes to figure out your password.

If your using a dictionary method, you'll need one or more wordlists,  you
can get some dictionaries from
http://www.skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Passwords

If you have a website with lots of users that you want to check, instead
you can run
select `password` from #__users [replace #__ with your prefix. :-)] - and
export the list to a text file to give to oclhashplus

Most password crackers around are limited to passwords of less than 16
chars[because beyond that, the algorithms change for efficient lookups] -
so while making your own passwords greater than 16 chars doesn't mean
instant security, it does mean that it is beyond the scope of script
kiddies who just download crackers from the internet and don't know how to
write their own.

We know the MD5 was vulnerable.

All the more reason to move away from it.
Or better yet, be able to choose our own hash.

For added security I protect the /administrator with .htaccess username and
password.

For MySQL I use one of those long password generators for th db user.

16 characters or more sounds like a good idea too.

.htaccess is a function of the Apache server which runs on Linux and the
Mac. You want to create a file named .htaccess and place it in the
directory you want to protect. In this case it would be /administrator.
Google for how to password protect a directory with .htaccess. I'd give the
details now but I'm away from my desk on my cell phone.

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv9w1cce9NE0AbAZga6d-xpL__F8jqF7sbZw+PkPbj+9ug@mail.gmail.com>

I've always had to place modules in a position on a Joomla page with an
existing something, such as an Article. What if I have a custom HTML module
(or some type of display module) and I want to give it it's own Joomla page
and link to it from a menu in the Menu Manager. Can this be done without
putting in the direct URL in the link field for the Menu? Or is it better
to have it appear as one of the Menu Types?

One way to accomplish this would be to use {loadposition} in an article and
then to create a menu item pointing to that article. See
http://docs.joomla.org/How_do_you_put_a_module_inside_an_article%3F

Matt

David, I'm not really sure if I understand what you want to accomplish.

If you have some custom HTML PAGE, it's best practice to have a menu item
pointing to a wrapper that will load the custom HTML page you want to
display.

Also, Joomla is very flexible nowadays with regular HTML. You can simply
create an article and paste all there is between the <BODY> tag, using the
HTML editor.

All the best!

Hi! It's not a custom HTML page, but a custom HTML module. As in a Joomla
module. For example, K2 is a module (assuming you have it installed) that
appears when you select a Menu Type in the Menu Manager such as a K2 Item
or K2 Category. Those modules already make it easy for the Admin to link to
those from the Menu. You don't need to already have an existing Article or
anything else on the page. Since those modules can be placed on their own
page, I wanted to know how to do this with other Joomla modules.

Best regards,

David

Subject: [joomla] Transactional email tracking
Message-ID: <CAC4OfRgvxhqcy_rFCLJxfoSMhG6pjUfNS6-Gp=CcqwRwH3XW4g@mail.gmail.com>

My favorite Email Service Provider has launched a new service for tracking
transactional emails.  Mandrillapp.

https://mandrillapp.com/

Transactional emails are all those system emails sent for password resets,
new user confirmation links, order checkouts, etc.

And beating me to the punch, there is an EXTREMELY nifty plugin from
Compojoom:
https://compojoom.com/about/blog/entry/mandrill-for-joomla-say-hello-to-transactional-emails

Sign up for an account with mandrillapp, install and configure the plugin,
and not only do transactional emails get routed through mandrillapp - they
will also be taked with the component and task called that sent the email!
 If there is a failure from Mandrillapp[say your above your initial limit
of 25 messages/hour] then it falls back to using the regular Joomla mailer
functions.

Extremely nifty to give you some added insight into those persistent client
problems:
User X tried to register but never got a confirmation email...[check the
mandrill dashboard, find the email, and discover it was bounced back!]

Or "Why can't user Y reset their password?"
Check the log and see that not only was the password reset link sent but
the user even opened the email!  They just didn't actually CLICK the link
to reset the password.

The reported fix is to

I can't find where to enable in the theme or disable it in each module...any hints on where to look?
Is? the enable/disable? theme specific?

Hi Janet,

As Joomla does not load jQuery from the core, at least not yet, the
template would likely have its own technique for loading it. I'd start by
checking the template parameters.

Best,

Matt

Thanks Matt...so it would be possible that the template doesn't even load it at all?
And it only is being loaded by the module extensions??? 


Seaching around I found these two extensions:
jquery Easy 

http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/performance/jquery-scripts/18327

and SC jquery
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/performance/jquery-scripts/7230

and this plugin to disable mootools
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/performance/mootools/15748

I've tried all of them, some of them in various combinations and haven't found a solution yet.

The web is full of conflicting information about javascript and whether mootools should? be disabled or not.
Some say its the only way to make the website work, others say removing it is the only way....

With so much conflicting information, I would love to see a subject matter expert speak at
Joomla day NYC to separate the facts from the fiction on this topic.

I'm certainly no expert, but I find it odd that people develop plug ins 

to remove/fix core components......
And why are the javascript libraries so problematic?


Any one else interested in this topic?

?
Janet Sullivan

Janet,

I've had this same problem before.  it was the same conflict between Jquery and Mootools.
In my case i had Jquery included my template file (index.php), once I took it out of the template file and only included it on the modules that need Jquery, it worked.   However i also received the guidelines below from an experienced jquery extension developer, it may help you.


1. include mootools first
2. include jquery after that
3. include jquery noconflict code (google to find it)
4. use the 'jQuery' instead of '$' in all the codes written for jquery (plugin or custom code) because '$' is reserved for mootools

this is just a summery. you should find many articles on 'how to use jquery with joomla'


- Todd

The best way to have jQuery in joomla is to run jQuery in no conflict mode,
and make sure all your jQuery is setup to support noconflict mode.

You should not try to disable mootools unless you know exactly what you are
doing because you will you have things break and not know how to fix them.

Todd:? Thanks! 

Sounds like a non-trivial undertaking, but I will give it a go.
The template developer confirmed that the template does include 

jquery to support accordian menus and a few other things, however,
had no idea how to turn it off.

In the meantime, adding all of the modules to fix problems with other components
wound up exactly as I expected.....One big mess, with nothing working right anymore!

The good news is that when things get this screwed up, you wind up learning a ton of stuff!
Still would love a subject matter expert to speak on the topic at NYC Joomla day, even if
it were a cookbook approach, similar to the advice you have given me.

? There? is no shortage of conflicting information on the web about jquery, mootools and joomla.
Janet

You may find the JB Library
Plugin<http://www.joomlabamboo.com/joomla-extensions/jb-library-plugin-a-free-joomla-jquery-plugin>from
Joomla Bamboo very handy in this case.

It will not only load jQuery for you, but remove other references to the
jQuery library to help avoid conflicts.

I was poking around in K2, and when I had it print out via 'echo' a link, I
noticed it didn't include the domain. It included everything after that.
While I was playing with this K2 template I thought I had left something
out. Then I did a view source on the page and all links didn't include the
domain, but they work just fine.

How is the domain being inserted when it's displayed as a web page? I am
guessing this takes place as Javascript someplace? If so, where?

Yes, I know we get this done for free and should be thankful, but I'd
really like to know how this work. Thanks in advance for a
kind explanation.

Hi David,

Without seeing an example of the page source, I can only guess that K2 uses
relative paths for the links. Can you post a link to the site in question
and cite an example link from that page?

Are you seeing something like this:

   - /directory/content.html
   - ../directory/content.html
   - ./directory/content.html

Instead of

   - www.yourdomain.com/directory/content.html

?

If so, you are seeing relative paths.

Yes, that's what I'm seeing.

I just looked at the Joomla 2.5 demo I have installed. The View Source for
the "Getting Started" looks like this:
<li class="item-437"><a
href="/joomla25/index.php/getting-started<http://sammy/joomla25_acl/index.php/getting-started>"
>Getting Started</a>

Even though it is displaying when you mouse over it domain.com
/joomla25/index.php/getting-started<http://sammy/joomla25_acl/index.php/getting-started>
and
the link works.

I never looked at this before. So if they are relative paths, how and where
do they get resolved in Joomla?

I just found this:
http://docs.joomla.org/JURI/base

So the base URL is being done by a call to JURI someplace. Maybe all
templates do this for us?

Hi Matt.

The mystery to me is that in the code I was writing I never did a call to
JURI, so it must be done further up the chain or the Joomla template does
it. Either way, it was alarming to 'echo' the variable only to see it
didn't contain a full URL.

I  never paid attention to the relative paths before because they were
working so I didn't bother to examine them until now.

Thanks everyone. I learned something today. If the base URL is not working,
then a call to JURI is needed. If it is working, it's because someplace it
has already been taken care of by a call to JURI.

I'm writing a simple module to display the last five K2 Items and want to
have links of the titles and categories.

Something seems not right about this.

Relative paths are not a joomla thing they are a web thing, putting the
domain in the href isn't only not needed it is not recommended because what
if you change your domain name?

Now this wouldn't be as much of an issue if you were using the juri to
generate but still this is 99% of the time not needed.

You should post the code you were writing and the problem and we can fix it
for you

And the links are not working?

You may actually need to pass the urls through k2 route helper

I was working on another K2 module months ago (which I've since found a
commercial extension to use) and the links were not working, which in that
situation now that you mention it might have been a K2 route helper issue.
I will have to go back and look.

But I kept in mind while doing this simple K2 module to display the five
most recent, I decided to have it print out the links for debugging
purposes. When I saw they weren't full URLs that would work, it concerned
me and thought it was related to K2 itself. After I displayed them
surrounded by <a href> to make a link out of them, the base url "magically"
was inserted when the user covers over it on the web page, and the link
does work. I had not paid attention to links in Joomla before, so I thought
this might be the way K2 works. Now it appears this is just the way Joomla
works to construct URLs using a call to JURI, which after a 'grep' appears
in many files.

I understand what you are saying. That makes a lot of sense.

At the root directory of one Joomla 2.5 installations I did this:

grep -l JURI `find .` | wc -l

And it counted 184 files which JURI is used. So it is being much more than
I would suspect. There might be other situations it is needed which I've
not come across yet. Here is a code snipped from K2 where it is used in a
/components/com_k2/views/item/view.html.php:
                // Absolute URL
                $uri = &JURI::getInstance();
                $item->absoluteURL = $uri->toString();

for a K2 extension like this and was delighted to find it. The

That is weird,

if you are using the command line   just ad -f or --force to your import and it should continue passed it and  your install will probably be fine.

Thanks, Chris for the reply.

I've never had to use those options on MySQL before. I will give it a try.
Any idea what this error message is all about? Thanks!

No idea why it is happening, but  it has to do with #__redirect_links  if you not making heavy use of that  you should be totally fine forcing the import. 

Here is a reference to it 

http://phpcrossref.com/joomla/installation/sql/sqlazure/joomla.sql.html

 SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON;
1208  
1209  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[#__redirect_links]') AND type in (N'U'))
1210  BEGIN
1211  CREATE TABLE [#__redirect_links](
1212      [id] [bigint] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
1213      [old_url] [nvarchar](255) NOT NULL,

1226  (

1228  )WITH (STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE  = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF)
1229  )
1230  END;
1231  
1232  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.indexes WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[#__redirect_links]') AND name = N'idx_link_modifed')

I have phpMyAdmin installed. What do I look for in the add/delete tables?
What might be out of place? Thanks!

Try using the custom for export.
Then create a new blank db, import into that,then switch dbs.

Thanks for the message, Laura.  This is the third one I've received.  If I

Subject: [joomla] sitemap.xml redirects to map.xml, is this correct?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv93qSS8MEcxZRJs9E0_zHzjb64Er94mxFTHAKr1zCxySA@mail.gmail.com>

I was given a sitemap.xml to upload. I uploaded to a Joomla 2.5 website,
and it wasn't found by Google. I then did domain.com/sitemap.xml and it
redirected to map.xml giving a 404 error of not found. I looked in the
.htaccess and I don't see a mod_rewrite doing a redirect for sitemaps.

Is this an internal Joomla thing by default that anything coming in for
sitemap.xml gets redirected to map.xml?

Figuring that things go better with a Joomla extension, I found xmap:
http://joomla.vargas.co.cr/en/downloads/components/xmap

Is xmap what most of you are using for a sitemap to keep Google happy?
Thanks!

Hi David,

I'm not aware of anything in Joomla's core that would redirect sitemap.xml.
I use that name on a few sites and have never had any issue with Google not
funding it.

That said, Xmap works great as well as AceSEF (
http://www.joomace.net/joomla-extensions/acesef-joomla-seo-sef-urls).

Hope that helps.

Best,

Matt

Hi Matt.

Thanks for the reply!

Your response reminded me to look elsewhere and I found the solution. A
wildcard redirect was acting a little too wild! :-)

Thanks for the recommend about the sitemap extensions, I will check out
AceSEF too.

Hello Everyone,

What is the best way to password protect specific pages in Joomla 2.5.6 without using the default Registration system within Joomla?
Since I really don't need to collect user data I'm fine with not using the Registration system of Joomla.

I found MosPasswort Joomla plugin but its old.

Thanks!
Kenny

My vote would be for .htaccess too. I use it to protect /administrator. I'm
wondering though, with turning on SEO, can that still be used if there is
no real directory to put the .htaccess in? For example, you create a Joomla
Article with an alias of foobaz. So that the URL of domain.com/foobaz finds
the Article. But since there is no actual directory called foobaz, mot sure
if .htaccess would be helpful in this regard. Or am I overlooking something?

Maybe something with ACL could be done for a specific page or two? So that
only registered users can access it? But doing that might be too high of a
bar for some users for Kenny's purposes?

My vote would be a content plugin.

if what you are trying to do hide a com_content article you could also do
the same thing with menu items.

You could in the content plugin check for a session variable.if it doesn't
check if there are POST items.

If so it checks if the post items are the assigned username and password.
If so it creates the session and loads the content item if not it either
loads a form instead of the content, or it redirects to something else.

I would be willing build this plugin for a donation to some charity or
something probably take an hour.

This sounds like a good solution. Just curious, would this be a plugin or a
module? Can you direct which pages you want a plugin to be enabled like a
module? Might want to do this for more than one page with different
passwords perhaps? (Sorry if it sounds like I'm creating more work for you.
:-) )

Well, plugins can't be assigned like modules but they could be assigned a
list of content item id's or probably menu item id's, however it does have
draw backs it the content way it would do that both on the main view, and
category views, and probably even content modules that.

Menu item id's might be less problomatic

Ha 50 minutes, could have done it faster but I got fancy and added both menu ids and content ids

https://github.com/AmmoniteNetworks/Joomla-Content-Access

It checks if the current MENU id is active and if so it replaces all the content items text with the contents of the default.php  in the plugin folder.

if it is the content ID it only does the  content item with that ID. 

If you  find this useful please donate to this  wonderful place

Subject: [joomla] JCE WYSIWYG addon component?
Message-ID: <1343572209.2801.YahooMailNeo@web122301.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

I want to add an image map to my joomla website and according
to an (old) forum post, the JCE WYSIWYG addon component can be configured
to allow the inclusion of the elements (area, shape, map, etc)

But I can't seem to find such a WYSIWYG addon component for JCE.
Anyone know what I need to do so that I can add the image map code to my Joomla
website? 
Thanks!

Welcome!

I think the poster is referring to JCE itself as being the addon component.
The last time I checked, which was fairly recent, there wasn't a JCE
WYSIWYG plugin for creating image maps. But, maybe something like
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/style-a-design/design/17880 will
help.

That said, that procedure should work with the current version of JCE when
creating the image map code offline.

Hope that helps.

Best,

Matt

Thanks so much Matt, I considered that since the post was so old, that the functionality may have been rolled into
the basic JCE editor.? But because I wasn't able to find any configuration to tell JCE not to strip out my code,
I was hesitate to stick with that assumption.? 

I'm using (or at least trying) to use fireworks to create the image map, so I think I'm good.? 

Actually, I can do the image map by hand - what I need help with is figuring out how to set
a: hover to effectively *change* the image from Image A to Image B....not so intuitive....but I *think*
fireworks can help.....if you have any advice on this its greatly appreciated!
Thank for your help!

Janet Sullivan

Hi Janet,

Glad you're getting there. Yes, you can change the image src with a bit of
JavaScript. Take a look at the page source at
http://betweenbrain.com/clients/linearacoustic/image-map/

Best,

Matt

Subject: [joomla] Converting a HTML/JavaScript page to be a module in Joomla
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv8xOtrY2quYtgatH0mWbH9umDJ1uapy_v5S_3RBz6OHsw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a JavaScript program which does some simple calculations. It
emulates what you would do in a spreadsheet. It isn't fancy, but it is
functional and I want to make a Joomla module out of it. I didn't write a
CSS for this because it was intended to be used in Joomla from the start
and I want it to inherit the Joomla CSS that's resident.

My first thought was, create a custom HTML module, go into HTML editing
mode and paste the HTML page with it's JavaScript in there.

The result is, it didn't work. It kept the HTML formatting of the page, but
it filtered out all the JavaScript. There are no external files referencing
the JavaScript and jQuery is not being used. Maybe it needs to be an actual
mod_david_calc and that will do it? But I must be missing something else in
order to do that. Can't imagine getting away from free in Joomla without
having to call some Joomla function to make it work. :-)

So then I spent time searching and it appears some sort of special
treatment is needed for your own JavaScript to be available in Joomla.

Why I'm posting about this, is that I would like to get some direction as
to what is the best way to do this. Is there a favorite Joomla extension
people use to help make all this happen? Also, should it be a module or
can/should it be a Joomla Article for this JavaScript calc program? It only
needs to appear on one page. Thanks!

Subject: [joomla] Captcha - recaptcha image not showing
Message-ID: <1343738061.62504.YahooMailNeo@web122302.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi 


I am trying to use captcha-recaptcha on a simple joomla contact form.
But the captcha code is not showing up.
Here are my settings:
The Administration Control Panel (ACP) has the following Captcha settings in various locations:


Global Configuration: ACP > Site > Global Configuration > Site tab > Default 
Captcha: Here there are 2 different options: (1) ?- None Selected -? and (2) ?Captcha ? Recaptcha?

Contacts: ACP > Components > Contacts > Options > Form > Allow Captcha on 
Contact. Here there are 3 different options: (1) ?- Use Default -?, (2) 
?- None Selected -? and (3) ?Captcha ? Recaptcha?.

Plug In: ACP > Extensions > Plug in Manager > Captcha ? Recaptcha plug 
in: Here one needs to enable the plug in and insert their (1) Public Key and (2) Private Key obtained by registering at http://google.com/recaptcha.


User Manager: ACP > Users > User Manager > Options > Component > Captcha: 
Here there are 3 different options: (1) ?- Use Default -? (2) ?- None 
Selected -? and (3) ?Captcha ? Recaptcha?
Currently, I have the following settings applied:


Global Configuration: Captcha ? Recaptcha
Contacts: Use Default
Plug In: Public and Private Key entered correctly
User Manager: Use Default
I have also tried the following settings:


Global Configuration: Captcha ? Recaptcha
Contacts: Captcha - Recaptcha
Plug In: Public and Private Key entered correctly
User Manager: Captcha - Recaptcha



I have a global key from google? (just acquired it, has not be used on a site before)

There is a long discussion here 

://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=615&t=690921&hilit=recaptcha&start=30about a catpcha problem and a temporary fix, but 


That fix seems to have been made in release 2.5.....(I am using a fresh install of 2.5.4)


http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&tracker_item_id=28075

Any suggestions from the Joomla veterans for this newbie?? Is there a better, more reliable captcha plugin that people use?

?

1.? You can set your editor to *not* filter out the javascript.

2.? It is very easy to create a simple module and put your code in it.? (I have a tutorial for it but it's not updated for 2.5.? The main difference is that you now need to register modules in the database in the #__extensions table.)? There are probably up-to-date tutorials on YouTube for doing this.? Once you see how easy it is, you won't both spending time looking for extensions that fit, you'll just make your own!

Hi Janet.

Hope you are having a great summer.

It looks like you are doing everything right. When I use captcha-recaptcha
I just check the box in the Global Configuration panel and turn on the
plug-in with the appropriate public/private keys from the Recaptcha website.

I would check your settings with the ones on Steve Burge's captcha tutorial.
http://www.ostraining.com/blog/joomla/captcha-joomla/

Also, is this site running on your local PC/Mac using WAMP, MAMP. XAMPP,
etc. or is it on a live site? I have heard that the captcha feature does
not work well on local servers. If possible, try to test your settings on a
live site.

All best,

Steve

Thanks, Steve, its on a live site.???????? 

So you agree that I don't need to mess with any of the "fixes" posted to the Joomla forum?.
It appeared to me that the proposed patches were already in the recaptcha.php file that I am using.
But a second opinion is always a good thing.

I try to avoid "work-arounds" and "fixes".

I just completed a J1.5 to J2.5 upgrade project (500+ pages) and the
previous developer used too many work-arounds and core hacks. We wound up
practically rebuilding the site from scratch.

If you have issues with captcha, you might consider using RS Forms Pro or
Breezy Forms rather than the built-in captcha feature before you start
messing around with PHP code (and if you do, be sure to do it with HTML
overrides.).

Your probably best to just make your own module.

Make a module in joomla is very easy it is the easiest thing to make.

You could just copy a module xml from another folder or download a hello
world module.

At the most basic level you could just copy an xml file from any module
than,

Put in a folder name it mod_david_table.xml open it up and change the info
to yours

Create an empty file called mod_david_table.php in the same folder and just
copy all you html and javascript right into that file and just have no php.
As you learn you can update your module to use templates helpers and
caching if you want.

That is better than disabling js in your wysiwg editor.

Last sstep is you zip of your two files and install them
