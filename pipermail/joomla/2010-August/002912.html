I know when we first started the Joomla NYC group, which meets every 
month at Lincoln Center currently, one of the members there worked at 
the U.N. and had deployed Joomla internally.

That said, I will say that the most important factor to me in choosing 
between Joomla and Drupal would be to evaluate what is already being 
used internally and to go with the CMS being used internally.

 From an end user point of view, Drupal is laid out in an easier to pick 
up on and use manner than Joomla[end user being your content editors and 
publishers].  From a configuration point of view, you will likely be 
able to get Joomla up to speed and running much more quickly than Drupal.

I recently posted my own comparison on these items.  You can find the 
same modules or components for both
CMS's....  Joomla will be much easier and faster to setup and configure, 
with less need for custom programming.  Drupal will take longer but for 
some of the more extreme intricacies will actually be faster to custom code.

&gt;<i>     * Access to documents and multiple languages
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Joomla seems to have the edge here....being built with multiple 
languages in mind.  Though that may just be because I have yet to look 
extremely deepling into Drupal's language capabilities.

&gt;<i>     * Security
</I>&gt;<i>     * Linking to static sites and converting a large static site to a CMS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Both Drupal and Joomla have import programs.  Also interestingly, if 
your running on Apache the default htaccess files, designed primarily 
for SEF links, have an added interesting component.  Both of them are 
designed to check for the existance of a file FIRST and use that, then 
if not found, redirect the connection to the CMS.

So, for example, say your structure is:

www/index.php &lt;-- CMS entry point
www/articles/aboutus.html
www/articles/contactnumbers.html

Now, if someone is to try to go to:
<A HREF="http://www.mydomain.com/articles/aboutus.html">http://www.mydomain.com/articles/aboutus.html</A> they will be given the 
aboutus.html file
if they went to
<A HREF="http://www.mydomain.com/articles/about.html,">http://www.mydomain.com/articles/about.html,</A> since no about.html file 
exists, instead the index.php program is executed


So in the end, it is more about what is the best tool for your team, as 
either tool works.  My tendency is to use what others are using 
successfully if there is such deployed internally rather than create 
competing systems....that way internally it is easier to transfer skills.
