Hey All,

A few years my hero Mitch showed up at a tradeshow with Mambo running  
on a cd in a windows/xp environment. Does anybody know how to do  
this? I have a client that wants to have his site running off of a  
cd. I do have a budget for this.

Thanks for your help

Norman

XAMP + Ampstart
http://ampstart.com/

 From checking the docs, what you do is setup XAMP on your system, 
configure and install everything, than copy it all over to a CDROM along 
with AmpStart.  You need to update the INI file as the MySQL database 
will need somewhere to store new data(Sessions, logons, etc) - so what 
Ampstart actually does is copy the MySQL database over to a directory 
you specify on the PC and runs from there.

As an alternative, use a USB drive, you can get 1G drives fairly cheaply 
and then you will have read/write access to the drive and no need to 
depend on the directory existing.

I imagine a more involved solution would be to run MySQL and have it 
place all the tables in memory, so any updates will be done to the 
memory versions and when you stop the program running it reverts to the 
default set and does not require a directory on the hd to store data.

Actually, it's not hard. Just change the table type
for the session table to "Heap".  That's it.  Any
changes will be stored in memory...

Joomla has a number of tables which get data stored in them based on the 
component, if your doing anything more than just demonstrating the system.

So they have to be stored somewhere editable, and you need to a method 
of preloading them with existing data.

Not that it would be hard to setup, I just don't know offhand what is 
involved.

Of course, that begs the question of whether or not it is a good idea to 
tie up a largish chunk of memory on tables.  I suppose it depends on 
what the reason for doing a CD Version is.

But I do like the idea of having a USB version.  Especially as I got 3 
1G USB drives when I only needed 2(I want to setup a couple of linux 
installs for my wifes laptop and my home system so I can swap to linux 
and get used to it before making the major install.  I was thinking of 
using the 3rd one as a data drive to share between the 2 systems, no 
reason I can't throw XAMP on it as well.)

Typically the reason to run a server off a CD (live cd) is for security
reasons.  Basically since it is a "read only" media it is harder to
compromise than a system with the OS on a hard drive.  Putting it on a
USB drive would compromise that advantage.  If the site is broken into
there is a limit to what can be changed.  If you put it on a writable
media, more can be changed.

The only other reason I could see for running off a live cd is for demo
purposes.   You do still need to think about security.  Just because you
can produce a working XP live cd does not mean that it is secure.

There are some issues with using Joomla this way.  As the last poster
pointed out, you would need space for your database to store
information.  On Content Management Systems like Jumla all the content
is stored by default in the database.  That means that if your site is
compromised, the site can still be defaced.  It means that you can
easily restore the system by wiping out the database, but you would
loose all your content.  You would still have your skin and your basic
site, but it would be like restoring your site to it's initial
condition.  You would loose any content added after the CD was burned.

If your reason of a "live cd" is security, and it is going to run only
or mainly a Joomla website, why not use a Linux live CD?  There is more
expertise available to make a secure site that runs Linux from a CD.
Joomla is the same and once the site was running you would need little
or no Linux specific knowledge to run it.

Sorry Norm, I only had Linux LiveCDs, they were put together by Brian
Teeman at UKLinux. Oh, and one more thing - usually the linux-based
LiveCDs are based on the Knoppix distribution, which comes with a
boot-time option to load everything into RAM:

> knoppix toram

And that tells the kernel to initialize a RAM disk for the operating
system, file system, the whole shebang. Takes ages to load, but once
you're up, the machine absolutely screams.

At LinuxWorld in SFO (the last Mambo expo for me, the one we learned
we were picking up our toys and rebranding to Joomla) the LUG there
had us three machines with 2GB of RAM each, and everything was loaded
on RAM disk.

People were so impressed with how insanely fast our software was. *giggle*

He'd be my hero too if he sent me a synopsis for next thursday's 
meeting.  Hint hint.  Nudge Nudge.

Clue by 4 to the back of the skull(had to borrow that from my wife.  
Sorry it's so dented, she uses it on me a lot).

Ok, so I won't steal Gary's thunder by announcing it here, I'll send
to him first so he can post :-)

My wife is from Switzerland, so she can resort to cheese or yodeling.

I wanna Calendar for the Joomla events. :-)

Also can I migrate the stuff off my own site and over to there that
pertain to just Joomla in NYC?

I stuck it there out of sheer laziness, but I'd love to see it placed
somewhere without a commercial interest(or at least a blatant one tied
to me).

There's a part of my presentation on Thursday that discusses this
need, especially regarding Joomla User Groups (JUGs?) and the need to
share resources to make it as easy as possible to manage your own JUG.

Anywhoo, I'd like to keep it in the presentation and discuss then,
hopefully I can have an announcement or two as I'm still putting
things together...

So, um, is this called the Big Apple JUG?

Cool, Anthony!

That opens the discussion to how the web site should be managed.

What about running it on a Windows server and using FrontPage??

See you guys Thursday!

I don't recall seeing anything about Joomla! Day USA East posted on  
this list. I just registered this evening for this free event and  
encourage others who can attend to do the same. It's free, but you  
must register and it is limited to 125 people. I was number 24, so  
sign up quickly if you are interested. According to the web site it  
is early enough to provide input for what is referred to as an "un- 
conference".

I have nothing to do with putting the event together, just a fellow  
NYC JUG'er passing along what looks to be a great idea. See for  
yourself:

Message-ID: <46F3B50C.6030203@beezifies.com>

I was wondering if anyone here is familiar with the Sphinx full text 
search engine?  http://www.sphinxsearch.com/

Looking at it, I was thinking it might be possible to work out an 
interface to programatically convert Joomla searchbots into Sphinx full 
text search capability(or maybe just create a specific extention and 
leave it up to component authors to integrate their components).

Like memcache, Sphinx search is for the more medium level of Joomla user 
- you can't run these types of apps on a shared hosting environment, but 
require a dedicated/virtual server to run them on - but it looked like 
an interesting project to try.

Using Sphinx on that monster project I mentioned last night at the JUG
meet. If you really want search on your site, and it is a high-traffic
site or just has really high-falutin' requirements, then Sphinx is for
you. Very, very impressive.

I'd love to see some sort of joomla<->sphinx integration, that one
might be worth creating a project for on JoomlaCode. To be honest
though I'm not sure how you would integrate the two, as they are quite
separate and distinct beasts ;-) I'll look at it over here and try to
come up with some ideas.

Well, I've been fixing some code that does searches of data in a Joomla
component(AdsManager), which also comes with a really messy mambot to
plug into the regular Joomla search.  The default searches are really
really bad(price fields can be searched for EXACT price, not ranges).

So I started looking at how to make that advanced search mode a bit more
friendly, when I ran across Sphinx and looking at it, it has every
advanced search function I would want.  Since all you need from your
search result is an id number and the component it is in, it seems to me
Sphinx could be easily integrated with a server side search, so the
server checks the Sphinx system based on the parms, and returns a bunch
of data, than back to the Joomla MVC component to format the display of
the data.

I have a good idea of how to integrate my component with Sphinx.  And I
see how to do the Joomla content component.  The big problem I was
looking at was how to make it painless to integrate everything else?
Something that would take all the search Plugins installed for each
component, and build out the Sphinx index(though worst case, I think
that can be handled just by saying "hey, here is a neat tool if you want
to write yet ANOTHER search module")

The only downside I saw with it was requiring a server to run the daemon
on(yeah, I'm a shared hosting guy.  I just don't have the time to deal
with the hassle of setting up, configuring, and securing a server these
days.  Other than periodic refreshes on my MythTV/router I don't worry
about it much.)

Still, it would be a fun project to work on, providing I can find
someone who wants to handle the headache of maintaining a linux server. :-)

when you say headache of running a linux server, what

Making sure it is secure, periodically checking logs or whatever your 
preferred method to track security incursions, installing and 
configuring a web server, installing PHP & Perl along with a basic web 
server configuration.

It's not so much time consuming, once your doing it, as time consuming 
to get your head(or at least my head) into the mode of remembering all 
this stuff, building a baseline system, yadda yadda yadda.

Or to put it another way, I'm feeling lazy.  Given a choice for my 
personal projects between coding and admin, I'll do coding these 
days(I've had a third cell line not in use much(kids line) and unlimited 
messeging for the past few months I'm just itching to hook up and fiddle 
with Kannel and Mbuni(SMS and MMS messaging from your computer using a 
cell phone)

But sitting down to work out the web server setting involved to properly 
connect up to kannel just pushes the project lower and lower.

Interesting.. I was not aware that Kannel supports US mobile handsets. 
One of the projects I'm exploring is a solar powered weather station 
which sends the raw weather data to an internet connected server. We 
have a site at the top of the mountain for the weather sensors and the 
server is over a mile away at the bottom. I was considering long range 
wifi or a ham radio, but if we used a mobile phone, we could do away 
with the server at the base of the mountain (which has flaky DSL 
connectivity).

If you simply want to send SMS and MMS, most carriers in the US allow 
you to send data to phones via their own email->gateways  ( @vtext.com, 
@tmomail.net)

About 5 years ago, I wrote a php function which would accept a phone 
number and submit to all the major carrier gateways (since we don't know 
which carrier to use based only on the number).

At the last meeting, we raised the issue of the meeting time as there 
were some unable to make the third thursday of the month.

As such, we decided on moving the meeting permanently to the second 
thursday of the month.

This means out next meeting will be on October 11th.

Meeting space wise, our first meeting overflowed the conference room by 
3 people, so we are looking into securing a permanent long term location 
with room to accomodate many more people(especially as the 11th meeting 
coincides with Joomla Day in NYC so we are expecting a greater number of 
people).

Sometime in the next few weeks we will be setting up a NYC Joomla 
SIG/JUG website.

A question was raised on whether or not there would be interest in doing 
some regionally team based projects.  We could get together for a day, 
or organize online, and work on components, extensions, non profit 
sites,  etc as a team - letting new Joomla developers learn the ropes 
from some experienced developers, giving Joomla users a chance to 
influence the direction of projects they use, and hopefully getting some 
people to provide documentation. :-)

There are plenty of minor projects I can come up with off the top of my 
head(and I'm not an old Joomla hand!) that we could do as a group just 
for experience and credit(taking stalled Joomla 1.0 components that are 
in use and updating them to 1.5, documenting them, and providing minor 
enhancements.  As a simple example, there is a popular banner module for 
Joomla made by JoomProd which is badly in need of a few minor tweaks.  
Combining this with a rewrite into the Joomla 1.5 way of doing things 
could be a fun way to kill an afternoon as well as learning from others.)

It would be nice to do some major projects for bragging rights for the 
City, but I figure we could start on some minor ones to get a handle on 
who likes doing what, and go from there(and we could even insist on 
doing things write and build out unit tests for all our components so 
going forward they become easier to maintain).

So to sum up:
Next meeting October 11th

Just a warning, if you want to attend the event you better register ASAP here:

http://www.joomladayusa.org/

It is free, hosted at google, but we got a limit of 150 people due to
space and we're at 135. I predict by lunchtime registration will be
full...

-- Mitch, looking forward to the event :-)

Then you will fit in just fine. The whole purpose of the project is
for everyone in the user group, at ALL levels, to participate and
learn with each other. As well, I hope that our diversity of talents -
Joomla attracts some pretty awesome designers as well - will make our
projects stand out as really great collaborative efforts.  :-)

Subject: [joomla] Joomla SIG website features
Message-ID: <46FCFBED.3040103@beezifies.com>

We're setting up a website for the Joomla SIG, I was wondering what 
features people would like to see, and what components they like for 
those features?

Off the top of my head, we should have:
A forum(fireboard?)
A notification list(yanc?)
An event calendar(???)
An RSVP system for signing up for meetings(???)
A PMS system of some sort

Whatever we use should work under legacy mode on 1.5 at the least, and 
perhaps for our first few projects if we use GPL components we could 
upgrade them to the 1.5 model.


So any thoughts on the best/simplest modules to meet these needs?

Subject: [joomla] October Joomla Meeting
Message-ID: <46FD2BC2.2030100@beezifies.com>

 From October onwards, out meeting date is now the second thursday of 
the month.

Date:
October 11th
6PM to 8PM

Location:
Robert Half Technology
245 Park Avenue, 25th Fl.
46th - 47th St.
(near grand central)

We have room for 50 people.  People will need to RSVP in advance so we 
have a list for security, and you will need some form of photo id onhand 
for security.

We will be setting up a website and an RSVP form over the weekend, for 
now you can simply email me your RSVP and I'll manually add you to the list.

Schedule:
Our last meeting was a long presentation about Joomla in general.  So 
this time around, I'd like to aim to have a number of quick 
presentations and we can alternate meetings going forward(big 
presentations followed by short presentations, etc). We will aim for 4 
small presentations, with the first 2 being geared for a more user 
level, and the last 2 for developers.  Anyone who willing to do a short 
15-20 minute presentation, please contact me.

Therefore, our schedule will be:
Session 1: 6:00-6:20 - Community Builder, what it is and what it is not
Session 2: 6:20-6:40

JUG/SIG Planning: 6:45-7:15.
To discuss: Community Website plans and needs
Community Projects

Session 3: 7:20-7:40
Session 4: 7:40-8:00


Presentations:
At the last meeting, I noticed some discussions on building a 
"community" website, and the component that get's mentioned frequently 
is Community Builder.  Community Builder, by itself, doesn't provide 
much in the way of "community" features, but it is a strong basis for 
such websites.  So I'd like to do a brief review of the features of CB 
to begin with, along with thoughts on what it allows you to do as far as 
community websites are concerned.

Message-ID: <46FD39D2.90808@beezifies.com>

If there is interest in it, after the meeting those who don't need to 
rush home could go over to TGIF's (or suggest an alternate?) to hang out 
for a bit.

The nearest one seems to be:
47 East 42nd Street
http://tgifridays.know-where.com/tgifridays/cgi/site?01606

After all, not having run a meeting before, I believe I made a mistake 
and owe Mitch a beer for being kind enough to do our first 
presentation(and yes, I suppose the offer extends to anyone presenting 
at the next meeting. :-))

Let me know what the level of interest is and if it is large enough we 
can make sure to get a reservation(and if any of you NY natives have a 
suggestion for someplace better, feel free to speak up!)

I have some experience with this as I helped setup www.nnjastd.org (drupal version due oct07). There is also a good article by Ohio State http://webgarden.osu.edu/buckeye2007.pdf   They used Joomla to build up their community site.

  A forum(fireboard?) -YES
A notification list(yanc?) - YES
An event calendar(???) - YES
An RSVP system for signing up for meetings(???) -YES
A PMS system of some sort - Don't these things bug out on a monthly basis? ;P

    Mos Def put some tutorials up or at least some good feeds.
  How bout job postings and member dir for prof networking?
  Maybe a cart for purchasing training events even if $0 (be nice to have some free training events hosted by volunteers). I'm biased to training b/c I'm in eLearning.
   
  speaking of which Colin Moock is giving a FREE, that's right FREE training on AS3 http://www.adobeas3tour.com/

  If you do a presentation on Community Builder, don't you need as well:
  CBJuice: a great product to import user records into community builder
  JACL Plus: I think that is it, to actually work with groups, etc. 
   
  At another section you may want to focus on shopping carts, such as VirtueMart, which is fantastic!

We're setting up a website for the Joomla SIG, I was wondering what 
features people would like to see, and what components they like for 
those features?

Off the top of my head, we should have:
A forum(fireboard?)
A notification list(yanc?)
An event calendar(???)
An RSVP system for signing up for meetings(???)
A PMS system of some sort

Whatever we use should work under legacy mode on 1.5 at the least, and 
perhaps for our first few projects if we use GPL components we could 
upgrade them to the 1.5 model.


So any thoughts on the best/simplest modules to meet these needs?

If you do a presentation on Community Builder, don't you need as well:
CBJuice: a great product to import user records into community builder
JACL Plus: I think that is it, to actually work with groups, etc. 

At another section you may want to focus on shopping carts, such as VirtueMart, which is fantastic!

>From October onwards, out meeting date is now the second thursday of 
the month.

Date:
October 11th
6PM to 8PM

Location:
Robert Half Technology
245 Park Avenue, 25th Fl.
46th - 47th St.
(near grand central)

We have room for 50 people. People will need to RSVP in advance so we 
have a list for security, and you will need some form of photo id onhand 
for security.

We will be setting up a website and an RSVP form over the weekend, for 
now you can simply email me your RSVP and I'll manually add you to the list.

Schedule:
Our last meeting was a long presentation about Joomla in general. So 
this time around, I'd like to aim to have a number of quick 
presentations and we can alternate meetings going forward(big 
presentations followed by short presentations, etc). We will aim for 4 
small presentations, with the first 2 being geared for a more user 
level, and the last 2 for developers. Anyone who willing to do a short 
15-20 minute presentation, please contact me.

Therefore, our schedule will be:
Session 1: 6:00-6:20 - Community Builder, what it is and what it is not
Session 2: 6:20-6:40

JUG/SIG Planning: 6:45-7:15.
To discuss: Community Website plans and needs
Community Projects

Session 3: 7:20-7:40
Session 4: 7:40-8:00


Presentations:
At the last meeting, I noticed some discussions on building a 
"community" website, and the component that get's mentioned frequently 
is Community Builder. Community Builder, by itself, doesn't provide 
much in the way of "community" features, but it is a strong basis for 
such websites. So I'd like to do a brief review of the features of CB 
to begin with, along with thoughts on what it allows you to do as far as 
community websites are concerned.
