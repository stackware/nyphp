<PRE>Good Evening,

Just noticed that updates to both Joomla CMS's are out. Both are security
releases so you would be wise to install these ASAP.

I'll also use this opportunity to introduce the new board of directors. We
were fortunate to have seven candidates running for seven positions, so no
election was required.

The new seven member board is:

Fred Sullivan
Marian Konop
Laura Gordon
Sebastian Duque
Donna Vincent
Scott Wolpow
Stephen Britton

The next move for the board is to figure out who will be the new president,
secretary, treasurer, and web master/mistress for 2012/

There are also three honorary  board members. The board has decided that we
should honor those that have contributed to the success of the NYC Joomla
Users Group and the Joomla CMS.  Honorary board members do not have voting
rights and are not required to attend meetings. But they have a great title
:<i>-)
</I>
The honorary board members are:

Elin Waring - former president of Open Source Matters and currently very
active in the development of Joomla 1.7 - 2.5. She has also presented at
many NYC JUG meetings and NYC Joomla Days.

Mitch Pirtle - a founding developer of Joomla and among the first to help
organize the New York Joomla Users Group. He has also presented at numerous
NYC JUG meetings and Joomla Days. He currently lives in Italy with his
family.

Gary Mort - a founding member of the NYC JUG and frequent presenter at NYC
Joomla User Group meetings. He currently lives in Woodstock, NY with his
family.

Have a great week!

All best,

Steve
