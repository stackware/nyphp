Subject: [joomla] Google SERP's
Message-ID: <B6E8901A433942B4AF6F6D0A7EE0B969@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone!

 

My site was appearing in the Google serp, first page bottom. Our google+ was
also appearing - now "for the last few months" our google+ has disappeared.
My site rank is 0/10 - it was 2/10. And when I do a key word search my site
does not show on page 1, ,2, 3, 4, 5..does not show at all.

 

Anyone have hint of what's going on. I did have duplicate url but I fixed
them (Thankx Laura Gordon) by using "Menu Item Alias".

 

Is anyone familiar with issue?

Next Meeting


Thursday May 15, 2014

This month we will be meeting 4 blocks away from our usual Touro College
address, and instead meet at the Hive at 55, where we have in the past held
JoomlaCamp events.

Pre-registration is not required for building security, but we would
appreciate it if you signed up at Meetup.com and let others know you will be
attending.

http://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Joomla-Users-Group/events/182634862/

We are looking for more presenters for future meetings.  Let us know if you
can present or if you are interested in particular topic presentations.

Location:

Hive at 55
55 Broad Street, 13th Floor
New York, NY  10004

Chairperson: Stewart Newfeld
6:00 - 6:15 - Introductions
6:15 - 8:00 

Presentation 1 by Stewart Newfeld: Two very powerful Joomla Extensions are
available for creating forms and form applications: RSJoomla! offers
RSForm!Pro (Prices starting at 19 Euros), and Chronoengine offers
Chronoforms and Chronoconnectivity (Free version available).  RSForm!Pro is
one of the most clearly documented Joomla Extensions available.
Chronoforms' most basic functionallity is documented in FAQs, but for
anything advanced you are left hunting through the forums, posting questions
to the forums, or like Stewart did, hiring a person to train you.  These two
programs take very different approaches to creating forms.  Stewart will
compare and contrast them, and demonstrate a few case studies for
Chronoforms.


Presentation 2 by Stewart Newfeld: Did you ever need to generate PDF
documents from within Joomla?  When you need to generate documents in a
format with predicatable, controllable printing, you can't beat the PDF
format. Stewart will discuss some possible solutions and demonstrate
creating fundrasing letters in .pdf format, from form input data, by
restoring the fpdf library that used to be in Joomla 1.5, but was removed in
Joomla 1.6. 

8:00-8:30 Lightening Round Question and Answers, Networking.

 

Stewart Newfeld, President

No, but what you are describing seems to be the Google+Your World feature:
http://searchengineland.com/examples-google-search-plus-drive-facebook-twitter-crazy-107554

IE what is displayed on the right is matches for the search you made 
from YOUR google plus network.  It would only show up for other people 
if they had the Unitel google plus page in their circles.

 From the link you sent, you haven't logged on to Google before 
performing the search[when you have you will see icons to enable/disable 
"your world"]


Also note that you MAY want to add authorship links to your content 
pointing to the unitel profile page[and the converse link on the unitel 
profile to point to the website]
https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1306778?hl=en&ref_topic=6003069

Honestly, I have no idea if this provides ANY SEO benefit, so I wouldn't 
spend a lot of time on it.
