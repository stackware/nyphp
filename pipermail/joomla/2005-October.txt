Subject: [joomla] Joomla! 1.0.2 release is out
Message-ID: <330532b60510021755o4ebdb803l45ec9c26ace8d5f0@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks,

We just released 1.0.2, which is a stability release:

http://www.joomla.org/content/view/274/52/

This one has no new features or critical security issues, but is a
general maintenance release and closed quite a few bugs. You can get
it as either a full download or a patch for 1.0.1 sites.

Last week was wickedly busy for us as well, as we are getting quite
busy with the new forge at developer.joomla.org and watching our
forums absolutely explode with new growth and activity.

This community rocks!

Next up is the LinuxWorld Expo in London, followed immediately by the
Joomla! Core Developer Summit. Expect a flurry of announcements both
this week and the next, as there is a tremendous amount of activity
going on.

Message-ID: <330532b60510060952y318810c6l127bd2e25c60844b@mail.gmail.com>

>From www.joomla.org:

"Joomla! has been awarded two prestigious awards at the Linux & Open
Source Awards in London.

The Joomla! project won "Best Linux / Open Source Project" for 2005.

Joomla! project lead Andrew Eddie said the award demonstrates the
level of faith and support the Open Source community has in Joomla!.

"The past two months have been astounding," Mr Eddie said. "To win
this award on the back of our first releases means a lot to the team
which has worked so hard for the community."

The second award which Joomla! figures in was won by core member Brian
Teeman. Brian won "UK Individual Contribution to Open / Source" for
2005.

Mr Teeman said he was honoured to win the award and said it recognised
"you don't have to be a coder to contribute to the world of Open
Source".

More news from London soon..."

w00t!

Hi Hans K.

try this: http://www.joomla.org/content/view/14/28/

But of my chats with Mitch I think they are pushing hard to bring it up
sooner than later.

Hope this helps.

Hans,

There's been great work by hackwar at the forum thread below, who's working
hard to do a faster integration of phpGACL:

Joomla ACL enhancments
http://forum.joomla.org/index.php/topic,3391.0.html
 
Looks like hackwar's gotten quite far in his work.

Best,
Ryan

He's actually coding like a man posessed...

Hans, for the record we have caved in to community demands and focused
the next point release on translation of the backend (this will be
1.1). 1.2 will include ADOdb, and lay the groundwork for phpGACL (or
whatever ACL we end up implementing). In fact, I know that the 1.2
release will incorporate the first stages of phpGACL implementation,
and will include custom groups.

I'm writing this from the UK, where the Joomla! core developers are
having their summit to make just these decisions. First, some beer.

*spacemonkey is very thirsty

Tomorrow the roadmap will be discussed in the afternoon (GMT), and I
will update as soon as I have access to the internet.

Sorry if this is OT, but I'm having trouble getting into my project account
on svn.joomla.org.  I'm relatively new to svn and tortoise.  Have set up the
network settings on tortoise to use svnplink along with the option switches
and path to my private key.  Have upload my public key into my personal
account at http://developer.joomla.org .  When I try to browse directory and
log in at:

svn+ssh://scm.joomla.org/svnroot/joscommerce/svn_jos 

Which is where I believe my repository is set up, I keep getting a password
challenge...of which I've got no idea what that might be.

Sorry for the newbie question.... I'm soooo confuuuuused.

TIA,

Mark

Hello, Mark.

I use Eclipse with subeclipse and works fine, so I haven't tried tortoise.

There is a thread on the forum that helped me establish the
connection, and I hope it helps you.
