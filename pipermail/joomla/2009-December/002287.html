<PRE>Hi,
As a new user of Joomla the list Marc put together was dead on. These are
all the same things I've been working through and some of them I'm still
learning.
If I knew that I could pick up some pointers at the JUG meetings it would
have motivated me to take the trip into the city from NJ. I am planning on
getting to the meetings in any case but that would surely have got me out
the door. I know somebody can show me how to do something in a few minutes
that will take me an hour to read and research the web to figure out.
As for the meetings being just a beginners workshop, that doesn't sound so
good, but with the RSVP option being discussed and targeting what people
have questions about, a 10-15 minutes at the start of the meeting as
breakout mini-sessions sounds cool.

Yes. IF we do beginner demos, we should direct people to some of those

both great resources and perhaps the newcomer hasn't found them yet.

So many! How to choose with such limited time!

Since Steve is sponsoring our refreshments, how about if we do one of his
tips-and-tricks for 5 mins. at the beginning of each meeting as a teaser for
his training.  He has a newsletter he sends out with these tips.
