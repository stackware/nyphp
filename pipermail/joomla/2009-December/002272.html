</I>&gt;<i> 2) There should be a history page covering the founding of the group through
</I>&gt;<i> organizing NYC's second JoomlaDay
</I>
Neat idea.

&gt;<i> 4) Encourage people new to joomla or considering Joomla to RSVP and ask them
</I>&gt;<i> to make a note that they are new to Joomla[perhaps set a checkbox] - and
</I>&gt;<i> place a count on the website of how many newbies are coming.  If we KNOW
</I>&gt;<i> there are 3 or 4 complete new people, than schedule a short 15 minute
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;welcome to Joomla&quot; demo for them.  Things like &quot;this is how you can
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically change the menu&quot;...&quot;this is how you can edit content on the
</I>&gt;<i> frontpage&quot;..&quot;this is how you add new content&quot;...  Really BASIC stuff.
</I>
This is a nice idea that can quickly go badly. I think that if there
were prior requests put in, through the website, we might be able to do
a short demo. I think we might be able to briefly cover some tech
questions for newbies. I think that some problems can get very sticky,
though. I saw one last night, where the owner had a problem not with his
Joomla upload, but with his host properly directing traffic to his site.

I'm also aware the my efforts to help him were disruptive at the
meeting, and I apologize for that.

So perhaps we could have people announce their problems, followed bya a
10 or 15 minute breakout where others could help them along. We could
hold strictly to that 15 minute time limit. Those in a position to help
could approach those requesting the help. Others also interested in the
announced problem could come over to watch and learn.

For those interested in demos, perhaps we can direct them to helpful
resources on the web.

&gt;<i>    I
</I>&gt;<i> know this was one of the things I did at the start of meetings, because
</I>&gt;<i> quite frankly this kind of demo is not &quot;sexy&quot;
</I>
Perhaps you should try to sex up your demos then! ;)

&gt;<i>  and it doesn't show off your
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;skillz&quot;
</I>
That sounds lewd!

&gt;<i>  so it is hard to find people willing to do the basics - but these
</I>&gt;<i> basics are what really really attract new people to Joomla.
</I>
We do get newbies. If we help them, perhaps some will stay. I've seen
others move on after they solved their problem.

&gt;<i>   The fact that
</I>&gt;<i> once a site is up, they do NOT need to call a web designer for every little
</I>&gt;<i> content change.  Of course, this also means you need a few volunteers to
</I>&gt;<i> present this - which shouldn't be too hard, just have a standard demo site
</I>&gt;<i> everyone can use and run through the basics.  If there is a page where
</I>&gt;<i> people can tell if newbies are coming, then a volunteer will step
</I>&gt;<i> forward
</I>
I like that basic idea. I think it would be helpful to have a form for
that month with several common issues for newbies. We could address the
most common one for that month and provide a list of resources to
address the others, or if there is enough left over, address the next
issue the next month.

&gt;<i> [I'd also say take it to the next level and 2 or 3 days before the
</I>&gt;<i> meeting, have the volunteer be able to send an email out to those newbies
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Thanks for your RSVP, Marian Konop from Gotham Informatics,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gothaminformatics.com,">http://www.gothaminformatics.com,</A> has volunteered to give you a brief demo
</I>&gt;<i> at the upcoming meeting on X at Y time.
</I>
I like that idea! Then Marian will have to give all the demos! I never
would have thought of that! Good thinking, Gary. I hope Marian likes the
idea too!

&gt;<i>   Please make sure to come or let us
</I>&gt;<i> know if something has come up and you need to cancel&quot;]
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Irregular presentors
</I>
Somehow that sounds wrong!

Thanks Gary, I think you gave us some things to think about. How does
this fit in with our mission, or do we have a mission?


&gt;<i> From: Donna Marie Vincent &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/joomla">donnamarievincent at yahoo.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as gathering info from the RSVP and developing a presentation or demo around the requests, I believe that would be a job in itself.  Are you volunteering for the job? ;-)   I believe that decisions about what presentations we are interested in should be done at the meeting by people who are participating in the meetings.  People volunteer their presentation, or volunteer to arrange for someone outside our group to come in and give a presentation, and we decide whether it is something we want at the meeting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For people to email in and say I want to see this and learn that, and the rest of us jump and do it, I for one am not fond of that idea.  I think the group is based on mutual sharing, that people need to take the initiative to go on the Joomla.org site and other resource sites, and then follow up with discussions in the group.
</I>
I understand those concerns. However, right now we are just guessing at
why newcomers show up, and what they want to learn at the meeting. Some
sort of information gathering regarding newcomer interest would help us
to give relevant demos. Presenting is still voluntary, and knowing there
was interest in certain basic subjects might encourage more of us to
step forward and present.
