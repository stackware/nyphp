&gt;<i> Gary,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that we should add an About Us page (#1-3).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And we do have a bio page and presentation page.  The bio page is called
</I>&gt;<i> Card Exchange, for anyone who attends a meeting.  And all presenters are
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged to add any materials from the slideshow to the website's
</I>&gt;<i> Meetings/Presentations download section.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We don't have &quot;regular presenters&quot; and I don't think we ever will because
</I>&gt;<i> people come and go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm..  Hearkening back to 2007, Laura, Anthony, Mitch, and yourself
regularly presented on topics.  I define a regular presenter as someone who
does at least 3 presentations in a years time.    To me, having a page
dedicated to those people lets those looking at the group over time see what
has been happening, and it's a bennie/thank you to the regular presentors as
it does add to your resume/cover letter to be able to say you present
regularly on Joomla at the NYC meetings. :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as gathering info from the RSVP and developing a presentation or
</I>&gt;<i> demo around the requests, I believe that would be a job in itself.  Are you
</I>&gt;<i> volunteering for the job? ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>  I believe that decisions about what presentations we are interested in
&gt;<i> should be done at the meeting by people who are participating in the
</I>&gt;<i> meetings.  People volunteer their presentation, or volunteer to arrange for
</I>&gt;<i> someone outside our group to come in and give a presentation, and we decide
</I>&gt;<i> whether it is something we want at the meeting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Not all presentations, I'm speaking here specifically of a general overview
of how to edit/maintain a basic Joomla website for new users/prospective new
users.

One thing I learned at the Dreamweavers meeting, I had a whole presentation
prepared on Joomla and I didn't get past editing content and menu's.  That
is an EXTREMELY powerful feature that I think many of us take for granted.
But new users don't really understand/realize the power.

It is also /boring/ for those of us who are already familiar with Joomla.
So it can be boiled down into a 15 mintue presentation to be done at the
beginning of the meeting only when we know there are people new to Joomla
coming[ie we have that one question on the RSVP asking if their new to
Joomla and encouraging them to RSVP so we can arrange it]

Those who volunteer to do it can have a rotation.  For them, it's a big
benefit because it means the presentor gets to talk directly at the meeting
to what are basically prospective clients.  The presentor gets to send them
an email a few days before the meeting reminding them that there is a
presentation geared specifically to them, and at the same time gets to
basically promote their own services with a brief bio of themselves.

The downside of doing these presentations is that it somewhat dillutes the
presentors reputation as more advanced users kind of associate them with
&quot;beginning Joomla&quot;... so it is a trade off professionally, but it does help
the group expand appeal and attract new people.

Now, this one idea does require a bit more in setup than the others - since
it requires some coding to setup the email communication functions and the
page to check on how many newbies are coming[which is also useful to others,
if you go and see that there are 5 new members coming, you know you can get
there 10-15 mintues later because there is a presentation you have no
interest in at the start of the meeting. :-)]

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can shoot an email to Hans Z. asking him to make the change.  I've found
</I>&gt;<i> the NYPHP folks very accomodating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a PHP programmer first and a Joomla user second, I've always found NYPHP
</I>&gt;<i> as the logical home for the Joomla email list... but based on the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> many Joomla users don't even know, nor do they need to, that it is written
</I>&gt;<i> in PHP perhaps it's not. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the website, I've been mulling that for a while and have a few[aka
</I>&gt;<i> many] suggestions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) There should be an about us page with a general overview of the group
</I>&gt;<i> 2) There should be a history page covering the founding of the group
</I>&gt;<i> through organizing NYC's second JoomlaDay
</I>&gt;<i> 3) We need to stress strongly that ALL skill levels of Joomla are welcome
</I>&gt;<i> at the meetings.  One thing I recommend is strongly encouraging non-coders
</I>&gt;<i> to come early to the meeting and schedule the non-techie stuff for the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning and save the techie stuff for the end
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Encourage people new to joomla or considering Joomla to RSVP and ask
</I>&gt;<i> them to make a note that they are new to Joomla[perhaps set a checkbox] -
</I>&gt;<i> and place a count on the website of how many newbies are coming.  If we KNOW
</I>&gt;<i> there are 3 or 4 complete new people, than schedule a short 15 minute
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;welcome to Joomla&quot; demo for them.  Things like &quot;this is how you can
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically change the menu&quot;...&quot;this is how you can edit content on the
</I>&gt;<i> frontpage&quot;..&quot;this is how you add new content&quot;...  Really BASIC stuff.   I
</I>&gt;<i> know this was one of the things I did at the start of meetings, because
</I>&gt;<i> quite frankly this kind of demo is not &quot;sexy&quot; and it doesn't show off your
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;skillz&quot; so it is hard to find people willing to do the basics - but these
</I>&gt;<i> basics are what really really attract new people to Joomla.  The fact that
</I>&gt;<i> once a site is up, they do NOT need to call a web designer for every little
</I>&gt;<i> content change.  Of course, this also means you need a few volunteers to
</I>&gt;<i> present this - which shouldn't be too hard, just have a standard demo site
</I>&gt;<i> everyone can use and run through the basics.  If there is a page where
</I>&gt;<i> people can tell if newbies are coming, then a volunteer will step
</I>&gt;<i> forward[I'd also say take it to the next level and 2 or 3 days before the
</I>&gt;<i> meeting, have the volunteer be able to send an email out to those newbies
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Thanks for your RSVP, Marian Konop from Gotham Informatics,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gothaminformatics.com,">http://www.gothaminformatics.com,</A> has volunteered to give you a brief demo
</I>&gt;<i> at the upcoming meeting on X at Y time.  Please make sure to come or let us
</I>&gt;<i> know if something has come up and you need to cancel&quot;]
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Regular presentors should have bio pages on the website.  Something
</I>&gt;<i> like:
</I>&gt;<i> Laura Gordon of RyTech Sites, <A HREF="http://www.rytechsites.com/">http://www.rytechsites.com/</A> is a regular
</I>&gt;<i> presentor at Joomla NYC.
</I>&gt;<i> [brief bio]
</I>&gt;<i> She has recently presented on
</I>&gt;<i> X - brief description and date
</I>&gt;<i> Y -brief description and date
</I>&gt;<i> Z -brief description and date
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Irregular presentors should be able to put up a bio page the month of
</I>&gt;<i> and the month after a meeting.  Something like
</I>&gt;<i> Rafael ??? of Dioscouri Designs, <A HREF="http://www.dioscouri.com/">http://www.dioscouri.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> [brief bio]
</I>&gt;<i> Demonstrating their new online shopping system Tienda on X date
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of this stuff is basic content editing, a directory component of some
</I>&gt;<i> sort[SOBI2, K2, etc] and then a little coding on the RSVP side which I could
</I>&gt;<i> work on during my dead week at the end of the month.
