Subject: [joomla] Can the admin user login be deleted?
Message-ID: <1373403940.51905.YahooMailNeo@web122305.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

The software that my hosting provider uses to do a joomla install 

automatically sets up a user "admin" with super user privileges.

If I add another user with super user privileges, can I safely delete the "admin" user...
I feel like it's a invitation for someone to hack into the site....
Thanks!

One of the common security tricks is to A) rename the account, so it's no
longer Admin, and B) Deactivate it.

In the event something goes wrong, you can edit the DB directly to
reactivate the account, but no one will be able to use it until then.

Subject: [joomla] The admin user can be deleted safely.
Message-ID: <CAMtoWUHaSCZEr2R5+5hFpd864tMDZQ0L5yUT99eAuqvuWmRhFg@mail.gmail.com>

If you have direct access to the database you can delete the admin user
that was created for you without creating another administrative user. If
you wish to use an administrative user at a later time you can insert the
row containing an administrative user into your #__users table (replace #_
with your Joomla sites database prefix this is the way you will see table
names referred to in Joomla and component source code). If you use the same
user ID as the original administrative account you will not need to modify
any other tables. However, if you wish to use a new user ID you must also
modify the #__user_group_map table to assign Super User group privileges to
your new user.

Some installed components may only allow special privileges, to the super
user who installed them (e.g. VirtueMart, I believe they check by user ID)
or other potentially quirky or otherwise bad coding practices so be warned.

You can very easily create a new Joomla user admin or otherwise from
another Joomla installation; say one on your localhost. If the one you use
is a copy of the Joomla site you are working on the group privileges will
also be created for you properly. Simply insert the rows associated with
that users id into the site you wish to update's user and group-map tables.

For simplicity and most purposes, however I would agree with the first
response; that changing the username of the super user should be sufficient.

Subject: [joomla] Slideshow
Message-ID: <89138C8CC2504C5EB11ED26B4249D4F5@OwnerPC>

 

 

Hello Every one;

 

Question:

 

In my home page I have slideshow. The first slide is a pgn file I made in
Fireworks. Below the slogan "SL1100 Communications System" - I would like to
add an interactive button which when clicked will take you to a page in my
site | http://unitel.biz/ | <http://unitel.biz/>  Simple!

 

I am able to make the interactive button with the link in Fireworks, no
problem. But not able to figure out the next steps;

 

1.     Once I make the button how do I add it to the original png/slide in
fireworks.

2.     I think I have to "export" the file in a particular way and if so
what are the steps or configuration setup. 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Google search needs help. You need to configure a few things before you can
expect good results.

Have you put content in the description meta tags? This is information that
should be displayed in search results once your site has been indexed.

And have you uploaded an XML file to your Google Webmaster Tools account?
This tells Google when and where to search you site.

Yes I have put content in meta-tags - somewhere I read that meta tags in
Joomla are hierarchical - in other words menu meta tags are at the top of
the list and everything else follows, so if you have meta tags info in your
menus you don't need them in articles and so forth. Do you agree? Yesterday
I did enter meta info in articles - just in case. What had me confused was
the source of some of the entries for example this entry >> SL1100 System
NEC SL1100 -  SL1100 System Pos.15 NEC SL1100 VoIP Digital Hybrid ... <
OOPS I just realized where this info was coming from. For testing purposes I
had setup custom html modules and assigned them to different positions in
the template. They are now deleted.

 

Can you suggest a sitemap extension for Joomla - am told that Xmap by VARGAS
is the best?

 

Thank you for your response to my question <<

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Not sure what is going on with the meta description tags on your site.

I always fill out the description tags found in the "Site > Global
Configuration" and then on the first page, you will find "Metadata
Settings."  I put the general site description here.

And on the Articles page, I use the "Metadata Options" and fill out the
description based on the content in the article. Limit content to three
sentences or less. The fewer characters the better, but make sure the
sentences make sense because they show up in the search results. Also use a
different meta description for each article.

While you are filling out the descriptions, you might as well put in some
keywords too.

Generally Google search works like this: when it indexes a page, it first
checks to see if there is content in the meta description tags and if so,
it uses those in the search results. If it cannot find the description tag
or content in the description tag then it looks for content on the page.

Do a "view source" on one of your web pages and see if there is a meta
description tag in the header (or head) section. It should look like this
<meta description="This is a description tag" >

And yes, I highly recommend the Xmap extension. I have been using it for
years and it has always worked for me.

Stay cool!

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv9mcAjtmxCpXv_qwM0C0ew5RJ=CErWC0aSUf7v74vXKHQ@mail.gmail.com>

I installed SobiPro's latest stable version on Joomla 2.5.11 and it's
very slow. I have their Cache On and the SobiPro Data Accelerator on,
but it's still slow. I confirmed that SQLite3 is installed. I don't
even have many records in it since I'm still just checking it out.

Anyone have any experience with SobiPro? Could I be overlooking
something? Thanks!

Message-ID: <36257ED3-6D30-4BE8-B7F6-42C8A722350C@whyknott.com>

What component does everyone recommend when setting up one Joomla install and having 10 other real estate agents have their own space on a subdomain like agent1.mydomain.com when you visit their page it only shows their content that resides from the main Joomla site. All 10 agents would be handled the same way and I'd only need to manage 1 Joomla install for all agents but to them its like they are managing their own website.

Any advice after reading what I mentioned above would be great!!

Thanks,
Kenny Berwager

Message-ID: <2E6797E27FA54538B972D552D9549858@OwnerPC>

Hello Everyone!

 

Joomla 2.5

 

Is it a good idea to install one of the SEO extensions, such sh404SEO or
MijoSEO. Can someone recommend one that they are currently using? Also
should I install xmap from Vargas even if I install an seo extension.

 

 

 

Best regards,

I know there are others who think differently, but I have found that Joomla
2.5/3.1 does not require the SEO extensions that were necessary in Joomla
1.5.

Just using the features built-in to Joomla 2.5/3.1, you can create SEF
friendly URLs, unique page title tags, and meta description tags. And it is
also possible to re-map URLs. Right now the only "SEO" extension that I use
is Xmap. I always try to take advantage of the native features in Joomla
before I start looking for third-party extensions. It cuts down on code
bloat.

As you may have heard, Joomla 3.1 now includes article tags, and there are
article tag extensions for Joomla 2.5 if you want to put tags on your site.
I have never bothered with article tags, but now that they are part of
Joomla 3.1, I have started using them. So far, I have not seen any SEO
benefits from tags, but they are helpful for on-site search and organizing
articles.

As long as the site has good content, good meta descriptions, unique title
tags on each pages, and the sitemap XML file has been uploaded to Google
and Bing webmaster tools, it should rank well in search.

I do agree with Stephen, and I generally use those extensions as a last
resort. But, one thing that Joomla has yet to address, in core, is having
true canonical URLs. If you do find yourself in a situation where that is
an issue, you might evaluate whether or not a SEF extension is then needed.

Subject: [joomla] Site Map - Webmaster Site Verification
Message-ID: <88B8E90D6BE84D74904A1E009108A094@OwnerPC>

I submitted my site map to Google and Bing/Yahoo. Any suggestions regarding
other search engines I should submit to?

 

Webmaster Site Verification: I listed with;

 

1.      Google

2.      Bing

3.      Alexa

 

Is there any special need to be listed with different search engines? Or one
is enough, for example just Google.

 

For site maps I used the xmap.

 

For web Master Site Verification I used extension from Bybe, listed in the
JED.

 

Any comments will be welcomed.

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Not sure what is going on with the meta description tags on your site. 

 

I always fill out the description tags found in the "Site > Global
Configuration" and then on the first page, you will find "Metadata
Settings."  I put the general site description here. 

 

And on the Articles page, I use the "Metadata Options" and fill out the
description based on the content in the article. Limit content to three
sentences or less. The fewer characters the better, but make sure the
sentences make sense because they show up in the search results. Also use a
different meta description for each article.

 

While you are filling out the descriptions, you might as well put in some
keywords too.     

 

Generally Google search works like this: when it indexes a page, it first
checks to see if there is content in the meta description tags and if so, it
uses those in the search results. If it cannot find the description tag or
content in the description tag then it looks for content on the page.

 

Do a "view source" on one of your web pages and see if there is a meta
description tag in the header (or head) section. It should look like this
<meta description="This is a description tag" >  

 

And yes, I highly recommend the Xmap extension. I have been using it for
years and it has always worked for me. 

 

Stay cool!

Yes I have put content in meta-tags - somewhere I read that meta tags in
Joomla are hierarchical - in other words menu meta tags are at the top of
the list and everything else follows, so if you have meta tags info in your
menus you don't need them in articles and so forth. Do you agree? Yesterday
I did enter meta info in articles - just in case. What had me confused was
the source of some of the entries for example this entry >> SL1100 System
NEC SL1100 -  SL1100 System Pos.15 NEC SL1100 VoIP Digital Hybrid ... <
OOPS I just realized where this info was coming from. For testing purposes I
had setup custom html modules and assigned them to different positions in
the template. They are now deleted.

 

Can you suggest a sitemap extension for Joomla - am told that Xmap by VARGAS
is the best?

 

Thank you for your response to my question <<

Google search needs help. You need to configure a few things before you can
expect good results.

 

Have you put content in the description meta tags? This is information that
should be displayed in search results once your site has been indexed.

 

And have you uploaded an XML file to your Google Webmaster Tools account?
This tells Google when and where to search you site.

Can someone explain what's going on?
