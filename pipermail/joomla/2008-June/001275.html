<PRE>I will chime in, I guess we just have to focus on getting a new home for the joomla nyc group.
&#160;
Although we can be gracious, I personally think it is unacceptable for a company to volunteer to host a meeting, and not to have a person from their organization available just to let us in at the door.&#160;&#160;If there was a rep. from RH available at 6:30, we would have all been able to get in, that was all that was needed.
&#160;
Hopefully we will find a new home for our next meeting for 8/14.
&#160;
But, I must add that the out door joomla brain session was great!&#160; The chips were great too!!!&#160; Light and crispy!

Yes, I too find the scraps they throw to us to be delicious, arf arf!!

But seriously, I would give them 'cordial'&#160; but let's face it, RH is a staffing company, they are looking for bodies to place, and it's in their interest to have user groups meet there to get some fresh meat. 

Until I know exactly where the ball was dropped I certainly can't rule out that it was actually just due to outright neglect on their part, based on us not having a packed room of potential job takers. So I'm not going to give them 'gracious', at least not for nothing. 

That doesn't mean I'm not grateful, however; in fact I am. I understand it's not always easy for groups to find places to meet. I just wanted to draw the distinction between being 'grateful' and blindly crediting them with such beneficence. 

In general I take a more programmatic approach to things, and when my code throws an error, it does me very little good to &quot;try to be understanding&quot;, however finding out what when wrong and how tends to keep the same error from happening again. 

Or maybe I'm just being too logical....

cheers, 

Forest

============

It should be noted that Robert Half has been very gracious in allowing
NYCJUG to meet in its facilities. Also, the building security staff has
always been courteous and accomodating, as far as I know. The security
snafu of the other night was inconvenient, but the staff does have
strict rules which they must abide or risk losing their employment, and
these are uncertain times. If the security measures are too much for us
to cope with, then another space is certainly in order, but we should be
grateful for that generosity which we have been shown.
