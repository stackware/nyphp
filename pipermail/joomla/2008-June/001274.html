<PRE>Yes, I too find the scraps they throw to us to be delicious, arf arf!!

But seriously, I would give them 'cordial'  but let's face it, RH is a
staffing company, they are looking for bodies to place, and it's in their
interest to have user groups meet there to get some fresh meat.

Until I know exactly where the ball was dropped I certainly can't rule out
that it was actually just due to outright neglect on their part, based on us
not having a packed room of potential job takers. So I'm not going to give
them 'gracious', at least not for nothing.

That doesn't mean I'm not grateful, however; in fact I am. I understand it's
not always easy for groups to find places to meet. I just wanted to draw the
distinction between being 'grateful' and blindly crediting them with such
beneficence.

In general I take a more programmatic approach to things, and when my code
throws an error, it does me very little good to &quot;try to be understanding&quot;,
however finding out what when wrong and how tends to keep the same error
from happening again.

Or maybe I'm just being too logical....

cheers,

Forest
