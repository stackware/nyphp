<PRE>Thanks Gary. I think that helps many people understand what is going on.

&gt;<i> When you download Joomla currently you get 3 application in one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, in the include and library directory, you get all the code that
</I>&gt;<i> is used to build a Joomla application to begin with.  The database code,
</I>&gt;<i> the table code, sessions, plugins, etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then in the main directory is a file called index.php, and the
</I>&gt;<i> directories: administrator, components, modules, plugins, templates, and
</I>&gt;<i> media
</I>&gt;<i> These files constitute the  joomla application - what the general user
</I>&gt;<i> sees when he goes to your website.  They are built using the &quot;base&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then in another folder called &quot;install&quot; is yet another Joomla
</I>&gt;<i> application which basically is JUST a set of screens to gather data,
</I>&gt;<i> create a Joomla database, and create a Joomla website
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible to take the base code and create a completely different
</I>&gt;<i> set of code which will function like Joomla in many ways, but have a
</I>&gt;<i> different interface for controlling it, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the things to understand is that there are certain common tasks
</I>&gt;<i> when building a PHP website.  A PHP website often has to connect to a
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL database for data.  It has to provide a system to allow a user to
</I>&gt;<i> logon and a way to check to make sure the user has permission to do
</I>&gt;<i> various things[edit content, post comments, etc] on the website.  It
</I>&gt;<i> frequently needs some form of skinning/templating so the design can be
</I>&gt;<i> changed without changing code.  It needs some way to send system
</I>&gt;<i> generated emails to users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are thousands of ways to do all of that.  And every coder
</I>&gt;<i> developes his own 'favorite' way to do it.   For some things there are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;best practices&quot; on how to do things.  On others, it is very up in the
</I>&gt;<i> air.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So freelance PHP developers that go from project to project are often
</I>&gt;<i> having to learn what the &quot;right&quot; way for doing something is in that bit
</I>&gt;<i> of custom code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's where &quot;frameworks&quot; come into play.   A framework basically means
</I>&gt;<i> a collection of functions to do some of that stuff.  Frameworks can be
</I>&gt;<i> developed independently of any application[CakePHP, Symfony, Zend, etc]
</I>&gt;<i> - and they can be developed specifically for an application[Joomla,
</I>&gt;<i> Wordpress, Drupal].  Frameworks are documented, so instead of having to
</I>&gt;<i> work through the code to figure things out, you can look at the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.  And wheras there may only be three or four people in the
</I>&gt;<i> world that understand all the functions and such in a custom application
</I>&gt;<i> so users are locked into them - with frameworks you can find many more
</I>&gt;<i> developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The independent frameworks generally suffer from having too many
</I>&gt;<i> features for things which are rarely done, and being somewhat overly
</I>&gt;<i> complicated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The application frameworks generally have a problem in that often it is
</I>&gt;<i> not possible to separate the framework from the application[you can't
</I>&gt;<i> just use the User/ACL system from Wordpress, you have to have an entire
</I>&gt;<i> wordpress site].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Joomla sits somewhere in the middle.  About 60-80% of the &quot;framework&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for Joomla lies in the include directory.  Depending on what pieces of
</I>&gt;<i> Joomla you consider base[the file management system for images is
</I>&gt;<i> managed by the media component for the most part - which is stored
</I>&gt;<i> outside include.  The user system also has a lot of needed code outside
</I>&gt;<i> of include.  Same with the content component, but it is debatable
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not you /need/ a content component.  And the same with the
</I>&gt;<i> template component.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using frameworks frees developers from a lot of the &quot;boring&quot; bits of
</I>&gt;<i> code and let's them focus on what they like.  It saves time and money.
</I>&gt;<i> The more familiar with a framework, the more time and money that can be
</I>&gt;<i> saved[or alternatively, spent on extra features]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All your Joomla Core developers also code PHP for a living.  They either
</I>&gt;<i> do so as freelancers, or serial entrepreneurs, or other processes.  So
</I>&gt;<i> even if a project their hired for is not a right fit for Joomla the CMS,
</I>&gt;<i> it is still often economically efficient for them to use Joomla the
</I>&gt;<i> Framework and build code on top of that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So as time goes by, with each new version of Joomla, they aim to provide
</I>&gt;<i> a clearer separation between the framework and the CMS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also keep in mind that, in my opinion, the core developers make most of
</I>&gt;<i> their money through other projects.  So while they have a need for a
</I>&gt;<i> strong Joomla Framework...they really don't care so much about the CMS.
</I>&gt;<i> Their main economic benefit of having a CMS is name recognition and that
</I>&gt;<i> more people using it means more weird esoteric bugs are found which may
</I>&gt;<i> be in the framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's one of the reasons why there is such a long dev lag between
</I>&gt;<i> versions at times.  The core team have economic motivation to keep
</I>&gt;<i> improving the Framework, but none on building the CMS.   So once the
</I>&gt;<i> Framework is done, they only devote their spare time to the CMS. [In my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion, this means Joomla has reached a point where they need to split
</I>&gt;<i> into 2 teams, CMS development and Core development..]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By splitting releases/updates into the 2 streams as they are doing, I
</I>&gt;<i> think there is a good chance that both will benefit.  It means major
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the CMS can now be made without having to wait for the
</I>&gt;<i> Framework changes to be ready to be released....and vice versa.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> According to the release notes, you will be able to upgrade directly from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Joomla 1.6 to Joomla 1.7 through the control panel. It sounds similar to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> WordPress upgrade method.
