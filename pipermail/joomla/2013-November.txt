Subject: [joomla] November meeting
Message-ID: <52792EB2.1000704@gmail.com>

Trying to plan out my schedule in advance, get back into doing something 
with my life, etc.

Is there a meeting in November?  I see one is scheduled for the 21st.

If so, anyone want to meet earlier around there and discuss using 
git/github with existing joomla websites?  I'd love to bounce some ideas 
off others and learn how others use it.

Using GIt and my own hub, doing fun things with it.
We have automated the process sop when you push to the repo it gets 
pushed to the site and the db autoloads and updates.

Subject: [joomla] Presentations in the "greater" NYC region
Message-ID: <528CFFC7.7090904@gmail.com>

I have a good bit of time available these days and am happy to meet to 
go over things like this.  Things like this being workshop style 
presentations where I can put together a set of notes on how to do 
something, and then go through them in a presentation.  That way when 
things are too detailed for the group, they can be skipped over, and if 
there are questions in a particular area it can be gone over in depth.

I live in the middle of Dutchess County, NY and to me about 2 hours is 
the farthest I really want to travel for a one day event[IE it's going 
to take me under 4 hours round trip so that I will not be getting home 
too late] - so that puts an upper northern limit on it of Albany, NY - 
Southward limit of NYC, but still covers a good bit of CT, NJ, and MA: 
http://www.freemaptools.com/radius-around-point.htm?clat=41.77643254375405&clng=-73.7486457824707&r=90&lc=FFFFFF&lw=1&fc=00FF00


On the downside, I'm not in a position financially to pay for the travel 
and such, so that would have to be reimbursed.  [I know NYC generally 
runs $50 to get there and back again....so I would assume the same for 
anything in my "nearby" range.

Due to an incredibly stupid oversight on my part - I am not able to make 
it down to the city this evening.  I am available for a web conference 
though where I can go through the presentations.

Subject: [joomla] SSL virtual hosting
Message-ID: <529352F7.3090505@gmail.com>

I hadn't looked at how SSL works on web servers for a number of years.  
The last time I worked with SSL the common rule was that you had to have 
a  distinct IP address for every domain name that you wanted to use SSL 
for[so you could have an SSL certificate for each different domain]

Heck, even the Apache Wiki still states it in some places:
http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/NameBasedSSLVHosts

However, when poking around I ran across references to SNI and using 
multiple certificates for the same IP Address. 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4366.txt This dates all the way back to 2006, 
so it has been around for quite a while!

Browser support for it goes back a good way as well:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#Browsers_with_support_for_TLS_server_name_indication.5B6.5D

Interestingly, for Internet Explorer it isn't the browser version which 
matters, but the operating system, IE uses the operating system to 
perform SSL encryption.  This means that it won't work in IE on Windows 
XP or any earlier windows operating system.  It will work for Internet 
Explorer on Windows Vista[released in 2007] and any later windows 
operating system.

As such, it's a fair to say that SSL for virtual hosts will work for 
almost all users these days - and there is no reason not to enforce the 
use of SSL for the Joomla Admin section as well as make sure that all 
your admin users, at the very least, use SSL when they log on to your 
websites.

This may be old news to everyone here, but since it was new to me I 
figured I'd pass it on.

Gary,

Do you recommend an SSL  be purchsed for every site? Or would 
self-signed certificates be acceptable?

If there is an SSL covering the entire server, accessing the Joomla 
login  page  via the virtual directory can be done securely. That is, if 
you have not canonicalized the site's default URL using .htaccess

For this purpose a self signed could work.
But if you have email issues with Outlook or with Merchant Services you 
need to list with an authority site.

I'm perfectly happy using self-signed certificates.  Or more accurately, 
I create a self signed CA for my own usage and use it to sign all the 
certificates I use on my sites.

It depends entirely on your use case.  I use SSL to protect the admin 
section of my Joomla sites and for any site management id's I use a 
simple system plugin so that all users in that group get redirected to 
the SSL site.

My personal concern is that I use my laptop everywhere I go.  I logon to 
check my e-mail, make changes to website configurations, etc.  Ever 
since Firesheep was released back in 2010, 
http://codebutler.com/firesheep/ it has gone from 'possible but requires 
some work' for anyone else on the public wifi to 'steal' your logon 
session to 'ridiculously easy'.  Personally I found that a good thing - 
it's not like firesheep was some new hacking method, it was just a tool 
that made it simple for anyone.

Since I'm using SSL solely to prevent theft of user credentials on wifi 
networks - I am perfectly content to tell people "you have to add an 
exception to use SSL, and all your admins need to do so".

If I was building an ecommerce site for someone else....well, I'd still 
recommend self signed certificates.  I find the "protection" offered by 
the various SSL authorities to be a complete joke[they don't seem to 
really do anything to actually verify identity] - and most small 
ecommerce sites end up having their certificate expire and not get 
renewed anyway - without having an appreciable impact on their sales.  
So why bother paying a lot of money for an SSL certificate?

But I would at least give the client a heads up that not using a 
purchased certificate /might/ affect their conversion rates.  They only 
need to use the SSL cert for the checkout process, everywhere else they 
can use straight http.

With SSL your really at the mercy of the creator of your web browser 
anyway.  Google could, for example, provide a false SSL certificate for 
/any/ website which would appear valid.  The same can be said for 
Microsoft, Opera, and Mozilla. [And case in point, Nokia actually DOES 
do this.  In order to allow them to cache and compress data from 
websites being sent to their customers browsers on their cell phones - 
Nokia used their root CA to create fake SSL certificates for https 
sites.  See https://www.grc.com/fingerprints.htm for fun details]

Subject: [joomla] The SSL Certificate Scam
Message-ID: <529385B1.6010202@gmail.com>

Warning, this a a length rant/vent on the state of SSL certificates as 
used on websites today.

https://plus.google.com/117506461184749864074/posts/PqHMSjsY5hp

The summary is:
I don't feel that purchasing SSL Certificates from "Trusted Third 
Parties" as defined by Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla is currently 
worthwhile.   If your using them for security, set up your own internal 
CA with a couple of roots and issue certs for your own usage.  It's more 
secure because then YOU are the one who decided to trust the CA.  
Moreover, it is more secure because YOU can set much shorter 
expiration[why wait a whole year?  Expire it in a month and generate a 
new one!] so if a cert is stolen it will expire soon - and YOU can 
revoke certificates that are being used fraudulently.

The only benefit to purchasing an SSL Certificate is marketing. There 
are a few people who will choose not to purchase a product if the SSL 
Certificate doesn't "look right".  However, considering the large number 
of active e-commerce websites taking orders today using expired 
certificates - I think the number of sales lost is minimal.

I do see a purpose to trusted third parties - it is just the current 
system which is flawed.
