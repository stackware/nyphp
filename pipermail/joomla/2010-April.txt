Subject: [joomla] K2: is it really confusing or is it just me?
Message-ID: <n2t6142ad2c1004041616tf19b9f2p9a689c2fd6c9e87f@mail.gmail.com>

Recently I discovered K2.

I found it very complex as there's very little documentation on it and
waaaaay too many parameters to configure.

I'm working my way through it, though, but I wonder if it's worth to use it
on 1.5, when I've heard 1.6 will have most of K2's features.

I've also heard K2 is THE must-have extension!

Thoughts?

Thanx!

Message-ID: <o2x6142ad2c1004050457n968015d9j9917113d51d1ccf0@mail.gmail.com>

Recently I discovered K2 through all the buzz there's to it.

I found it very complex as there's very little documentation on it and
waaaaay too many parameters to configure.

I'm working my way through it, though. So far, it's got lots of interesting
features for bigger projects, but seems a little too much for what I've been
doing lately (mostly small companies, with few products and little text).
Anyway, I've been studying it.

I've heard K2 is THE must-have extension, but wonder if it's really worth to
use it on 1.5, when I've heard 1.6 will have most of K2's features.

HI,
I am looking for a Joomla programmer to create a web site on educating the public on skin care. I have some training in Joomla web design, but like to hire a joomla professional. Please let me know if anyone is interested in this project.

Steve,

Its poor netiquette to hijack a thread and doubly so to hijack this one.

If you have something to say unrelated to this thread then start a new 
one in future.

I'm sorry I haven't posted in reply here....I've just been
overwhelmed.....and overwhelmed by all the offers of help.

"Let me explain.....no, it is too much.... let me sum up" :-)

On Saturday we moved to our new rental house in Woodstock.  Moving out of
the apartment in Kingston which was in a....not so good location.....  move
prompted by the gang member from poughkeepsie[yes, they do have gangs
here...somewhat more dangerous in some respects than NYC gangs because their
not only violent but stupid too]...... who came to Kingston looking for the
kid who testified against his brother and shot him 10-20 feet from the door
to my apartment.[yes, life has been a little unbelievable this year].

Beautiful house, great landlords, the kids loved their new rooms...safe....
 *sigh*..

We had a really efficient move and everything was in.

I had put my bed up against the electric baseboard heaters, making a note
that it would have to be moved come winter... but it was so nice and
beautiful we would not be using the heaters for months.

Somehow the heat was on....so when the temp dropped overnight the heater
turned on...... overnight it set the mattress to smoldering but I thought
the smell was from hair or such... turned off the heater and went to get
some more stuff.

While I was gone, Sandy got very uncomfortable due to fumes....and when she
noticed Laura[the 2 year old, not the one on this list!] hands were blue she
sent all the kids outside and looked throughout the house.  Then not finding
anything, went and got the landlady and they searched and found the bed
which was smouldering[no fire at this point].

My wife suggested calling 911 and the landlady didn't think it was a big
deal.....  Then her husband decided to move it.....my wife suggested hosing
it down first but they didn't think it was neccessary[hey, I'd do stupid
stuff like that too!  The main diff is I listen when my wife tells me I'm
being a dumb ass.]

As soon as the bed was moved and air was let in, it flared from smoldering
to fire....  They dragged the landlord out[who kept thinking he could stop
it] and called 911.....in under half an hour it spread throughout the house
and burned the entire insides out...

TPK

No, we just moved in, rental insurance was to be setup on the next paycheck.
 Complete wipeout.   Including our laptops.

I've got replacement systems[though my wife's wireless is flaky] and working
through things slowly.

Immediate clothing needs are covered.......  Couch surfing and such for the
next few weeks.

So we have immediate issues to deal with, mid term, and long term.

Fun fun fun.

On the upside, I am overwhelmed by the offers of help from not only Sandy's
friends[who I expected them from], but from my own contacts and such....and
also complete stangers!

It is......beyond humbling.

Here is my wifes livejournal post about needs and such:
http://sandramort.livejournal.com/2300176.html


In short, we are going to have to completely refurnish wherever we move to,
right down to bookshelves[though not many books left!  *sigh*.....  I love
books] and wall hangings.

Kitchen stuff, ironically, had not completely made it over so we might have
that stuff...still need to take stock there.

Hello everyone,
My name is Yuki and I just began using Joomla recently. The version I'm using
is 1.0 and I was having trouble uploading youtube videoclip to the website. I
did try copy and pasting the html code of the youtube video to the html source
in the editing screen of the Joomla, but it did not reflect on the website. I
would appreciate if anyone could educate me on this.
Thanks!

website. I would appreciate if anyone could educate me on this.
Thanks!

Actually it is the brain-dead filtering of script in content items by
1.5 by default. You know, the one where in order to turn it off you
have to search the internet for three days straight, with each
suggestion a complete and total opposite of the previous suggestion,
and when you finally get it turned off you have no idea what you did
to make it leave you alone.

Nah, do I sound bitter?

Subject: [joomla] Joomla component developer needed
Message-ID: <C7EC8B5D.19BF1%russelld@panix.com>

I am seeking a developer who is experienced in custom joomla component
development. 
The component needed could be built using a cck solution, but we would
prefer to have this built specifically for the clients needs.
This component would require up to 10 fields of information (including 2
images and text based content) and need to have two modules for displaying
the appropriate category based content on the frontend of the website.

I am a frontend developer with experience in building brochure-ware based
joomla sites looking to expand my business to include custom joomla
component development.
I currently have more projects than I am able handle and will need to
collaborate with another developer.

Ideally, this person would be located in the NYC area.
 
Please contact me directly:

1.6 will not have many of the features of K2.  1.6 will have ACL's....

K2 has a user profile system, basic ACL, and a CCK.

That said, I have found it to be somewhat inflexible and javascript heavy
and while it is a great system, just like sobi and all the other CCK's I
find myself having to make too many hacks to be usable.

Also I really don't like an all in one integrated system....I prefer my user
profile system seperate from my other systems.

At this point, or at least right before the move and the fire, I was looking
into Phing to make a generic component creator[there are a couple online
ones but their not advanced enough for me...I want one that creates a basic
CRUD system for a basic 2-3 table layout]....

That way when I need to "clone" the component, I can just use the template
and create another one.

Use very basic database fields[text and integers is enough for most
applications, and custom coding can handle the complex cases].

Of course that project was shelved....along with my entire redmine project
system that I had setup on my laptop and had not had "time" to push to my
server yet.

Message-ID: <l2x4bffc351004212307nea738dccy587c320e728c763@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry, it has been EXTREMELY busy these past few weeks so I have not had
much time to send out updates.

For those who don't care about the details, feel free to stop reading now.
:-)

For anyone receiving this who was not aware:
On April 3rd we moved into our new rental house in Woodstock.  On Sunday,
April 4th, Sandy called me while I was on the way back from the apartment to
get some last stuff to inform me that the entire house had burned down and
that everyone was safe.

So, working backwards:
We signed a lease for a house in Kingston over the weekend.  We move into it
this coming weekend.  It's small, but workable as a short term[6 month]
solution.  Enough space for those who need it, and let's us take our time
looking for something more long term.

I prefer the Kingston/Woodstock area as it is close to school, close to the
bus, etc. So while Saugerties is nice....it puts me just a bit too far away
from my parents for weekly visits.

Thanks to Temple Emanuel and Rabbi Romer,
http://www.templeemanuelkingston.org/ we have been able to stay in the
Kingston area so we did not have to choose between seperate places or not
taking the kids to school while we located something more permanent.

Thanks to everyone at school, http://ww.sudburyschool.org, Raffi really
seems to be getting through the upheavals rather well.

I need to go through and send out thank you notes individually, but just
have had ZERO time to do anything but catch up on work.  Also if I have not
replied to an offer of help, mainly it has been because I have been
overwhelmed by day to day items and not even able to think of "after we
move"...  I will get back to you....just bear with me.

I've also been overwhelmed by all the well wishes, offers of help, etc.  Not
just from Sandy's friends[who I expect it from] and my families contacts,
but also from complete strangers and my OWN personal contacts and coworkers!
 It is just extremely.......humbling?

Thanks to Sandy's father, everyone has more than enough clothes that we can
simply wait till after we move to figure things out.  I suspect clothes are
not going to be much of a problem.

The biggest issues I see facing us in the next few weeks are:
Sleeping arrangements.  Fortunately the frames for the beds my brothers and
I slept in as kids survived, and my parents have my fathers "youth bed"
frame, so we're all set there.  Just need to work out mattresses and such
and the kids will be set.

Then there is just Sandy and I..... and while I can sleep anywhere, Sandy
needs something with a lot of back support.  Our nice, firm, solid King size
bed[thank you Grandma Alice] is gone.  So I'm hoping to find at least a
decent twin sized captains bed[solid wood backing] and firm mattress so
Sandy has somewhere to sleep that won't kill her back.

Outside of that, of course we will need to get bedding, linens, pillows,
etc.  So if people have those sitting in storage they would be good.

And the only other thing I can think of is actually kind of odd.  We had a
bunch of different artwork[kids, a little bit of purchased, etc] which we
always plan to hang...but never seem to get around to it.  It mostly got
moved over, so it's all gone.

Note: not looking for "professional" artwork, just homeful, cheery,
pictures, paintings, etc - things that not only look nice and turn the house
into a home, but remind one of those who sent it[May, if you get this,
something of Sarah would be nice...sadly I think that was in the boxes that
made it to the house]

I find the oddest thing is, that while I certainly could have lived without
this event, it is in some ways freeing to have a "reboot" in many ways.

That code there is for a find/replace function.

Basically, what happens is when Joomla runs the a plugin, a lot of plugins
will go and check the html that has been generated for the keystring and
then replace everything in the {} with the results of a script.

However, such plugins have to actually be triggered by an event in order to
run.  I'm guessing this is a content plugin?  Content plugins are only run
by the content component and components that have been specifically enabled
in their code to run them.

Here is a good article on various plugin magic and how to work around these
limitations:
http://www.howtojoomla.net/how-tos/development/how-to-fix-joomla-content-plugins

The SHORT summary would be to do the following:

$findSnapshot =
"{product_snapshot:id=$prod_id,showname=n,showprice=n,showdesc=n,showaddtocart=y}";

JHTML::_('content.prepare', $findSnapshot);

This should trigger the content plugins and generate the html you are
looking for.

Greetings,

Someone suggested I post here to look for help, and since I have a few projects going on I may have just skimmed the requirement for this group and if I?m posting a question in correctly I apologize.

That being said I have a problem with the Autothumb plugin for Docman. Both from http://www.joomlatools.eu/products.html

I posted a thread on their support forums which can be seen here:

http://forum.joomlatools.eu/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=5936

I need this problem resolved quickly and am willing to pay to get it resolved.

Thanks,

Subject: [joomla] Non-profit open source CMS meetup in NYC - Wednesday,
	April 28
Message-ID: <3DC53C2BA9764E40935E34CD16E988F8@RWOLenovo>

Hi NYC folks,

I'm out here in SF right now, but just saw this run across one of my
non-profit tech lists, and wondered if any of our Joomla! friends in the NYC
area could attend this meetup and lend a hand for some non-profits looking
to learn more about Joomla!

Developing Websites with Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal
Wednesday, April 28 @ 6pm ET
http://www.grassrootscamp.org/calendar/13190459/

"The survey results are in, and an significant majority of you wanted to
learn more about creating websites with some free or cheap open source tools
like Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal. So that's what we're going to be talking
about."

"This will a basic to intermediate level presentation, and we'll talk about
how these tools can be useful both for new organizations that don't have a
website yet, as well as how they might be helpful for making microsites or
independent blogs for specific purposes, like fundraising campaigns or
particular topical issues. Of course, this is high-level stuff, and we're
not going to get too far into the technical aspects of the development, just
enough to make some decisions about what platform might be best for your
use, and what sort of benefits or problems might come up with each one."

Merc Bar

Can anyone make it to share the Joomla! word?

Cheers,
Ryan

Dang, I'm gearing up for MongoDB SFO myself or I'd come! Sounds cool,
hope someone from NYCJUG can make it.

Message-ID: <w2webd63fae1004281405zbe0549b3hae559b17073c44de@mail.gmail.com>

I have a weird situation. I have a new install of Joomla on a shared server,
in a test directory. When I am in the administrator back end, which I log in
to with http://www.domainname.com/test/administrator, I have no problem.
BUT, if I click on preview, or type in http://www.domainname.com/test I get
an Error 404 Not Found.
If I add index.php after the test/ I get to my site, but when I click on
Home on the navigation, I get the 404 error page again.
Any ideas? I have 2 other test sites in other test directories on this
server (and 3 databases) and they all work correctly.
I am using Joomla 1.5.15, the host is 1&1.

WOW, looks cool indeed. I wonder what they've done to provide support for
CMSs. Really curious.

After speaking with the host, it turned out I erroneously had an index.html
file that it was reading. Not sure how it got there, but when i renamed it,
my problem was resolved.

There are sample apps and clients for PHP, Python/Django and

Sorry, it has been EXTREMELY busy these past few weeks so I have not had
much time to send out updates.

For those who don't care about the details, feel free to stop reading now.
:-)

So, working backwards:
We signed a lease for a house in Kingston over the weekend.  We move into it
this coming weekend.  It's small, but workable as a short term[6 month]
solution.  Enough space for those who need it, and let's us take our time
looking for something more long term.

I prefer the Kingston/Woodstock area as it is close to school, close to the
bus, etc. So while Saugerties is nice....it puts me just a bit too far away
from my parents for weekly visits.

Thanks to Temple Emanuel and Rabbi Romer,
http://www.templeemanuelkingston.org/ we have been able to stay in the
Kingston area so we did not have to choose between seperate places or not
taking the kids to school while we located something more permanent.

Thanks to everyone at school, http://ww.sudburyschool.org, Raffi really
seems to be getting through the upheavals rather well.

I need to go through and send out thank you notes individually, but just
have had ZERO time to do anything but catch up on work.  Also if I have not
replied to an offer of help, mainly it has been because I have been
overwhelmed by day to day items and not even able to think of "after we
move"...  I will get back to you....just bear with me.

I've also been overwhelmed by all the well wishes, offers of help, etc.  Not
just from Sandy's friends[who I expect it from] and my families contacts,
but also from complete strangers and my OWN personal contacts and coworkers!
 It is just extremely.......humbling?

Thanks to Sandy's father, everyone has more than enough clothes that we can
simply wait till after we move to figure things out.  I suspect clothes are
not going to be much of a problem.

The biggest issues I see facing us in the next few weeks are:
Sleeping arrangements.  Fortunately the frames for the beds my brothers and
I slept in as kids survived, and my parents have my fathers "youth bed"
frame, so we're all set there.  Just need to work out mattresses and such
and the kids will be set.

Then there is just Sandy and I..... and while I can sleep anywhere, Sandy
needs something with a lot of back support.  Our nice, firm, solid King size
bed[thank you Grandma Alice] is gone.  So I'm hoping to find at least a
decent twin sized captains bed[solid wood backing] and firm mattress so
Sandy has somewhere to sleep that won't kill her back.

Outside of that, of course we will need to get bedding, linens, pillows,
etc.  So if people have those sitting in storage they would be good.

And the only other thing I can think of is actually kind of odd.  We had a
bunch of different artwork[kids, a little bit of purchased, etc] which we
always plan to hang...but never seem to get around to it.  It mostly got
moved over, so it's all gone.

Note: not looking for "professional" artwork, just homeful, cheery,
pictures, paintings, etc - things that not only look nice and turn the house
into a home, but remind one of those who sent it[May, if you get this,
something of Sarah would be nice...sadly I think that was in the boxes that
made it to the house]

I find the oddest thing is, that while I certainly could have lived without
this event, it is in some ways freeing to have a "reboot" in many
ways,,,,, .
