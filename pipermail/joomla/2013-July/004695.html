Description and Keywords: Are coming from my Menu/Home/ Meta

concerned?

Not sure what is going on with the meta description tags on your site. 

 

I always fill out the description tags found in the &quot;Site &gt; Global
Configuration&quot; and then on the first page, you will find &quot;Metadata
Settings.&quot;  I put the general site description here. 

 

And on the Articles page, I use the &quot;Metadata Options&quot; and fill out the
description based on the content in the article. Limit content to three
sentences or less. The fewer characters the better, but make sure the
sentences make sense because they show up in the search results. Also use a
different meta description for each article.

 

While you are filling out the descriptions, you might as well put in some
keywords too.     

 

Generally Google search works like this: when it indexes a page, it first
checks to see if there is content in the meta description tags and if so, it
uses those in the search results. If it cannot find the description tag or
content in the description tag then it looks for content on the page.

 

Do a &quot;view source&quot; on one of your web pages and see if there is a meta
description tag in the header (or head) section. It should look like this
&lt;meta description=&quot;This is a description tag&quot; &gt;  

 

And yes, I highly recommend the Xmap extension. I have been using it for
years and it has always worked for me. 

 

Stay cool!

Yes I have put content in meta-tags - somewhere I read that meta tags in
Joomla are hierarchical - in other words menu meta tags are at the top of
the list and everything else follows, so if you have meta tags info in your
menus you don't need them in articles and so forth. Do you agree? Yesterday
I did enter meta info in articles - just in case. What had me confused was
the source of some of the entries for example this entry &gt;&gt; SL1100 System
NEC SL1100 -  SL1100 System Pos.15 NEC SL1100 VoIP Digital Hybrid ... &lt;
OOPS I just realized where this info was coming from. For testing purposes I
had setup custom html modules and assigned them to different positions in
the template. They are now deleted.

 

Can you suggest a sitemap extension for Joomla - am told that Xmap by VARGAS
is the best?

 

Thank you for your response to my question &lt;&lt;

Google search needs help. You need to configure a few things before you can
expect good results.

 

Have you put content in the description meta tags? This is information that
should be displayed in search results once your site has been indexed.

 

And have you uploaded an XML file to your Google Webmaster Tools account?
This tells Google when and where to search you site.

Can someone explain what's going on?
