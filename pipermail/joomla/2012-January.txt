Subject: [joomla] Display module positions other than Home Page?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_M_O=T6k8MarNsNXF6gVcqcJ2W7OkD8wFChz0YCPXk7w@mail.gmail.com>

I am aware of appending ?tp=1 to the Joomla URL to display the module
positions. However, this works only for the Home Page. How can I
display the module positions for the pages other than the Home Page
(aka Front Page).

This is with Joomla 1.7.3, if that matters in your answer. Thanks!

David Roth

Hi David,

Unless you are using more than one template on your site, the module
positions should be the same on all pages.
Remember that you can control the look of the each page by turning the
modules on and off.

All best,

Steve

Hi Steve.

I'm aware of that, but it would be easier to see the module names
displayed in the various positions on pages other than Home Page. Just
wondering if there is a way.

Best regards,

David

the ?tp=1 will only work on the home page because of how get variables work. 

for inside pages you need to change the ? to  &  and it will work, 

This is true if you are using SEO urls or not. 

&tp=1

I want to add, that for this to work the
template manager -> options -> template options -> Preview Module Positions
must be set to Enabled. At least it is required in Joomla 1.7.3, not sure
about previous versions. I imagine out of possible security concerns some
Joomla websites might want this disabled.

This is especially helpful to have when working with a new template and
also it makes it easier to see what parts of the screen are not controlled
by the Joomla template but by K2.

Subject: [joomla] K2 thoughts and questions
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_6h4QnqB76O8PVxDCSd=aMhzxShk=xiBWo-Nr-5KMazw@mail.gmail.com>

I've been using Joomla for years now, but until recently I had not focused
on K2.

A few things which are wonderful about K2. First of all, the extra fields
which helps to add additional fields to K2 Item. I think the use of
sub-categories is also good.

Some things make me uncomfortable and I wanted to share those here to see
how others might be handling them. There is the Joomla template and then
there is the K2 template. The K2 template controls that part of the webpage
like the body of it, for lack of a better term while the Joomla template
handles the rest. So the K2 template for a K2 item is like being able to
have your own template for each Joomla article. This sounds amazingly
flexible but with this comes what I find to be a disconnect and enter into
a very un-Joomla-like area. If you don't like the layout of the K2 template
such as it's order on the sections on the page page, you have to resort to
editing a PHP program (item.php) in order to change this. K2 doesn't have
modules like Joomla does for the templates so you can't go in as
administrator and change the ordering of the modules because there are no
modules.

I started to wonder if there might be a K2 Template Manager which might do
what the Template Manager does for Joomla. I've seen one online but I don't
think it allows ordering of the K2 part of the page unless I missed
something. After having looked over the item.php code this past week it
doesn't look like there is any other way to change the order of what is on
the page than to edit item.php itself. I've also not been able to find the
kind of documentation on K2 templates like there is for Joomla templates.

Even with Joomla templates no programming is required to move modules
around on the page such as top, bottom, etc. How are people managing this
with K2? Is there a better way?

I haven't had the need to move things around in the K2 template.

What I usually do is turn on/off whatever I need in the item view and item
in category view settings. I've used CSS once to move things around a
little bit.

But it would be nice to have a visual scheme of the K2 template where we
could drag things around and have it our way.

I am new to the group but I would like to know if 10 minutes could be put
aside to discuss Drupal and Joomla at the next meeting.  I am new to CMSs,
but they all seem to do the same thing (organize data with MYSQL and
display the content in defined html <div>s).
What I've come across in my research is the notion that Drupal is more
powerful than Joomla. I don't think so, but beleive the:
Drupal community is "smaller" and more "Enfranchised", and the
Joomla community is "Larger and less Enfranchised".
Is this by design?
If we can start to answer this question I think it will broaden our
approach with Joomla.

Hi Anthony,

Have you tried Drupal yet? If not, I suggest installing it on your local
computer using MAMP or WAMP and trying it out.

The Drupal vs. Joomla debate has been going on for years and will likely
continue for a long, long time. It is not a topic that can be resolved in
10 minutes.

I don't think it is wise to spend meeting time discussing Drupal. I have
worked with both and prefer Joomla because it is easier for me to
understand and I can build sites faster. But for others say it is the
opposite.

See me after the meeting if you want to discuss Joomla further.

Best regards,

Steve

Drupal and joomla are both good,

Personally I feel like if you just know php you cann write something for
joomla, but with drupal you need to learn the drupal way

Hello Anthony,
I think this list may be an excellent venue for you to solicit a discussion
of Joomla vs Drupal as many people on the list are cross platformers. It
may, in fact, be a more appropriate venue than the monthly meeting. In
addition, Scott Wolpow, who has offered to speak to you at the next
meeting, is an excellent resource.

See you Thursday

Hi Anthony.

There is logic to selecting something which has good documentation, is
widely available and well supported. While several of my friends who I
greatly admire their skills prefer Python over PHP, and Postgres (and
others DBs) over MySQL, emacs over vi, I find life generally easier
sticking with LAMP for the reasons I just mentioned. There are times when
the need is highly specialized and after careful study something which
isn't popular and might very well be in beta will do.

As for a CMS, yes, you are right they store information in a database and
display it on a web page. But the same could be said for accounting systems
and there are tons of those too with different interfaces and features.
What it comes down to is you are the developer or user, which is going to
make things easier for you to do what's needed. Think about what kind of
web projects you want to do, see if there are websites done in Joomla and
others doing what you want. Then look at it from a developer's prospective.
As for a user, I'm referring to the administrative part of the CMS. Whoever
is going to be the Admin for a CMS is going to have to learn how to do the
job and there is going to be a learning curve regardless of the CMS
selected. An Admin for one website might be an actual webmaster while at
another it might be someone who's computer skills so far have only been
using a Desktop system running parts of MS Office. So while we might feel
as a developer the given CMS is great, someone given the task of Admin
might feel more overwhelmed with one CMS than another so this has to be
taken into account.

Just a few thoughts to ponder. As they say, your mileage will vary. :-)

When I tried to install Drupal once, it came to a certain point where I had
no clue what to do next. It was installed and ready to use, but I couldn't
figure out how to go to an administrator panel or insert content in the
site. Actually, I didn't even know exactly what I was seeing (some kind of
splash screen with no further info). From that day on I never used Drupal
again and moved on with Joomla. Nowadays I use Wordpress too.

If you want to go ahead and use Drupal and Joomla, go ahead! But consider
what you do, the time, skills you have and the use of your CMS to make the
best choice for the moment.

For example: I'm a graphic designer. In time I found Mambo (Joomla's
previous incarnation). It was easy for me to understand how to put things
together and I grew from there. I was amazed how I coud be able to offer my
clients things that until then I'd have to turn into a programmer to offer.
I'm not a programmer. I CAN'T code PHP. So I resort to Joomla Extensions
Directory everytime I need to add an extra something to a project. And it
has dissappointed veeeeeery little in time. I run my own business, so I
have focus on what I want and need to learn. I came to a point where I
don't want to use my time to learn the nuts and bolts of things that I
won't use everyday, like REAL PHP coding. BUT I am always learning a little
thing here and there as I delve into Joomla. I have a curious personality,
so I feel good to learn Joomla. I live in a country where not everyone can
ACTUALLY speak english so there's a demand that Google Translator can't
handle. :-) I help translate some extensions, I'm great at HTML and CSS
(LOVIT!) and there's a demand here in Brazil from people and
micro-companies who can and want to use a CMS.

All this put together made ME stick with Joomla.

If you have PLENTY of time on your hands, embrace both worlds and find
what's the best you can extract from each of them.

Good luck!

I am really appreciative to the organizers of the JUG. And lastly, as
participants we are previledge to see the entire scope of CMS all
represented in one room (developer-user, expert-novice, multi_platform -
single).

Subject: [joomla] REMINDER: January Joomla NYC meeting is tomorrow!
Message-ID: <CABcNofMRYFfWHyju98MeRVHH1pX32Nwxmz1-e7RcokEOOqpkmw@mail.gmail.com>

It's Joomla NYC User Group monthly meeting time.

As usual, we will meet at the usual time and place - starting at 6:30 PM in
the subterranean conference room at Lincoln Center at 146 West 65th Street.
(For better directions, check out the home page at www.joomlanyc.org.)

This month, Donna Marie Vincent will present twice: "Using RS Form!Pro to
create, update and modify database tables" and "How to use the Joomla
Framework outside the Joomla CMS."

Keeping with the RS Form!Pro theme, Stuart Newfeld will present "How to
customize RSForm!Pro user and admin email notifications."

Scott Wolpow has ordered pizza and spring water. No one will leave this
meeting hungry.

This will also be a memorable meeting for me. As some of you make already
know, Marian Knoop is the new president of Joomla NYC. I am now the Joomla
NYC web master. Scott is the Joomla NYC treasurer, and Sebastian Duque is
Secretary.

The other board members are Laura Gordon, Fred Sullivan and Donna Marie
Vincent.

We have a feature-packed evening for the first NYC JUG of 2012 that cannot
be missed. Please try to make it.

Should anyone have problems finding the location, feel free to call me at
the cell phone listed below.

All best,

Steve

Drupal cannot be installed without a good deal of technical competence, 
know how, and at least a passing familiarity with PHP.
Drupal "components" [called modules] can't be installed/configured 
without the same level of knowledge.
Drupal "components" often are far from being complete mini-applications 
and require a coder to complete them.  They are solutions that worked 
for a specific use case and can be made to work with others.
Good Drupal "components" are generally all freely available.

Drupal provides an extremely mature, rich and consistent programming 
platform, which makes it easy and fast to extend it with new features.
Drupal has an extremely user friendly /end user/ interface for adding 
new content, editing things, etc.
Drupal coding is functional in nature.

Joomla can be installed and configured with a much lower level of knowledge.
Joomla components are simple to install and configure.
Joomla components are often full fledged, featureful mini applications 
which are easy to configure for specific usage.
Good Joomla components are often commercial in nature[though GPL 
licensed] and require a fee to download and install

Joomla provides a mature programming platform - but it is not very rich 
and is very inconsistent - which can make it more time consuming to make 
changes and add new features.
Joomla has a poor end user interface for adding new content, editing 
content, etc.
Joomla coding is object oriented in nature.


The functional vs object oriented is mainly a matter of taste.  I prefer 
OO coding, so I prefer Joomla! - but you can still build powerful apps 
with functional code.

Consistent vs inconsistent is a matter of naming conventions.  Once you 
learn the Drupal way of coding, naming functions, etc you will find most 
add ons follow that model - so it makes it much easier for an 
experienced Drupal coder to understand the whole website.  Joomla! on 
the other hand has been changing, a lot, from version 1.0 to 2.5 so 
there are many different ways of doing things - and the add ons often 
create their own new ways of doing things.  So being an experienced 
Joomla! programmer isn't of much advantage to understanding all the code 
your using.

Rich means that there are lots of opportunities to override the system 
and do something different.  As a trivial example, whenever a query is 
built to access the database there is a hook which can be used to modify 
the query before it is run.  This means it is dead simple to design a 
multi-domain content platform using a single install - you can have a 
hook that when Drupal goes to lookup a content item, it adds a check to 
make sure that content item is published for that domain.  And the proof 
is a number of mature multi-domain extensions for Drupal.

Joomla! doesn't have one single hook/plugin event in the database driver 
so there is no chance to make any changes.  In fact, the Joomla! plugin 
system is lacking in many hooks...and from looking on the list it seems 
that the choice of events is based on what the core developers want to 
do with Joomla!.  While adding a plugin event is relatively simple, most 
suggestions for new events get shot down right away.

Gary, well said.
I think 2.5 has triggers, which are kind of like hooks, but not quite.

Does any one have a copy of Ads Factory 1.7.
I need to run a diff against the code in a site I took over.
The company is impossible to deal with.
Thanks

Also, I have always been curious about Ads Factory. Maybe you can show us

Anyone have a utility they use, like?J!Dump, that works with Joomla 1.7?

I asked because according to the Joomla extensions directory?J!Dump
only works with 1.5 & 1.6. Thanks!

1.6 and 1.7 are essentially the same.? It's like saying 1.5.21 and 1.5.25.? If it works with 1.6 it's supposed to work with 1.7.

Does anyone have experience with the "Pharma Hack"?

http://redleg-redleg.blogspot.com/2011/02/pharmacy-hack.html

Basically a script is installed that spams links like "Viagra" in Google search results. As a result Google removes our site from the index.

I have followed many instructions on how to remove it, but each time it returns after about 3 weeks. VERY frustrating.

If there is anyone out there with experience please let me know. We would be happy to hire your services as well.

Thanks.

First suggestion is to get off shared hosting.
I expect you will find your site is not secure.
Change all passwords, including that used by the DB user.
If you have a back up, delete all files and re-upload.

You can contact me off list if you wish.

I really like rackspace cloud for smaller sites, backspace servers for bigger sites and backspace dedicated for the biggest sites. 


I also VERY VERY much encourage you to not host with dream host. I had nothing but problems with dream host

Message-ID: <CABcNofMVM1pJVFJv8-yyyVgyJC+up9BD3TFkiZs4Fw4da6LtRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

Joomla1 2.5 has been released. Joomla 1.7 is no more.

Tons of new features. Andy Tarr wrote up a great list in December.
http://community.joomla.org/blogs/community/1533-new-features-in-joomla-25.html

Updating from 1.7 to 2.5 is one-click through the Extension Manager panel.
(NOTE: I just tried to update to Joomla 2.5 from 1.7 on a local site
running on my desktop and it made the icons in the admin panel run
vertical. I was also not able to uninstall any plug-ins, templates and
modules through Extension Manager. Not sure if this was caused by my local
environment, but use care if you update and remember to BACK-UP YOUR SITE
before you click the update button.)

And I did not see any instructions on how to upgrade to Joomla 2.5 from
1.5, but I understand that a script is in the works. Besides, Joomla 1.5
will be supported until the end of April. So you have plenty of time to
wait.

All best,

Steve

Hi Stephen,

The icons issue, as well as a related issue with modals not working, is a
browser cache issue. Please see
http://docs.joomla.org/Category:Version_2.5.0_FAQ for more details.

I can also report that SP
Upgrade<http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/migration-a-conversion/joomla-migration/15609>works
flawlessly for importing 1.5 data into 1.7.3 (you can then do a
one-click upgrade to 2.5.0). I've recently been migrating sites,
and unfortunately have run into issues database with jupgrade. SP
Upgrade<http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/migration-a-conversion/joomla-migration/15609>
is
well worth the $33 or so.

Best,

Thank you Matt!

I flushed out the cache in Firefox and now everything looks normal and
works.

Thanks again for the advice.

Thanks for the tip on SP Upgrade, Matt.

I still get scared when upgrading from 1.5 and it's good to know there are
options out there if anything goes wrong.

Subject: [joomla] Weird SEF issue
Message-ID: <4F229ED2.6070105@wolpow.com>

I have never seen this before.
When I turn on SEF in  a joomla 1.5.25 install all I get is a page with 
the word "here".
I have installed the SEF patch and searched for any page with just that 
word.
I have switched out the template.
I have replaced the .htaccess
So I know it is in base core.

My last resort will be replace all the core with a fresh copy.

Any ideas?

It is the default .htaccess page
I would not mind a default page, because then at least i can track where 
it is going to.

Subject: [joomla] com_contact - Can't locate the "Site Contact" file (Joomla
	1.7)
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_-=ZbguqY53hc=U5htZ+ErVwzhbXH26bmX+TRN2p6KmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hopefully this is something I've overlooked and some kind soul here
will point this out to me.

I'm trying to look at the source code PHP files for "Site Contact"
which is part of com_contact.

The Joomla com_contact component files of interest are located in:
components/com_contact/views/category/view.feed.php
components/com_contact/views/category/tmpl/default_items.php

So I went to the Joomla com_contact to edit
components/com_contact/views/category/tmpl/default_items.php which
appears to have all that's displayed on the web page such as
grid.sort, etc. But even if I remove this file, it has no effect on
"Site Contact" page it still loads!

If I remove components/com_contact/views/category/view.feed.php, that
certainly breaks the page, but nothing in
components/com_contact/views/category/tmpl has an effect on it.

What am I overlooking? Thanks!

Your template can have optional overrides.? Check to see if there is one in the "html" folder of your template.

Also, do NOT modify the files in the core components, use the template overrides.? When you apply an upgrade patch, these files will be overwritten.

Hi David,

"Site Contact" sounds like a contact record from your database. The files
in the /tmpl directories represent the different views that display those
records. Can you explain what you want to change and we can give you a
better idea of where to look.

Best,

Matt

Hi Donna.

I had no intention of modifying core files, I'm studying merely trying
to see how it works to adapt the methods elsewhere.

Yes, there is a 'html' in the templates which are provided by
YouJoomla (YouPlus template). However, when I have renamed them to see
the effect, it only slightly changed the look of "Site Contact", but
it didn't break the page and the functionality of it stayed the same.

Hi Matt.

I'm trying get access to the grid.sort that's being used on that page
for "Site Contact". For those not familiar, that page displays a table
and the user can click on that page to sort by Phone number, etc.

I was looking for a good vanilla grid.sort being used on the front end
in Joomla, because I want to do the same with K2 fields (including
extra_fields).

I got it solved. Thanks so much for your insight into this, Donna!

I totally missed the override with this. This explains why it wasn't
picking up any changes.

Best regards,

David

Are you on shared or VPS?

If on shared you may find it in the Cpanel.
I would call support.

          Are you on shared or VPS?

          IF VPS then you have to shell into the system or find it in
          Cpanel

          

          If on shared you may find it in the Cpanel.

          I would call support.

             I currently have access to the joomla
              installation via ftp.
              Can the problem be fixed here?

                        Look at your my.cnf file.

                           Hello,
                            I made a copy of my default template
                              and assigned it to a menu item for
                              Hikashop categories.
                            At some point, after i go into the
                              Template Manager, i now cannot get in to
                              edit either template.
                            I get this:
                            

                            
                            Fatal
