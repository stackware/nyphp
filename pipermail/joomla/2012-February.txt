In your configuration.php file, write on the very first line

ini_mem('memory_limit','12M');

If it doesn't work, try to increase it.

G'luck!

It is a MySql issue, not a Joomla issue.
Not sure if the Joomla user has the rights.

I dont know wether it's a MySQL issue or Joomla issue.

What I can say is when that happened to me I made the change in
configuration.php and things started working fine.

Check this post in the Joomla forum. Hope it helps.

That's not "configuration.php".? That's the php configuration, which is php.ini.? Has nothing to do with Joomla or MySQL

"configuration.php" is a file in the Joomla installation.

You can also set the Memory limit inside of a php script, but the better place to do it is in the php.ini file as Donna pointed out. 

ini_set('memory_limit', '64M');

should in most servers give you the increase in memory this can be good for testing

Yes, for php mem limits, but that error can also be caused and cured by 
changing the my.cnf file.
The mem limit is from the DB.

Scott, I must be missing something. How do you know this error message
could be database related and not just PHP?

I'm fairly certain this is a PHP issue.

See http://drupal.org/node/76156, for example.

It is a php.ini issue, sorry have a bad cold.


There is a similar error involving MySql.
It comes from a search that has too many queries or joins.
The MBString can cause that sometimes.

Since you are on a shared platform, you must call support.

The Apache server has to be restarted to take effect.

On a dedicated server or VPS it is a simple service httpd restart
In your environment you may have something in your cPanel.

This is why shared is baaad.

Feel better and very soon, Scott!

I've not run into a problem with memory issues on MySQL, thanks for
explaining it. Something to certainly watch out for. The most daring change
I've made to my.cnf file is to move the MySQL databases to an eSATA RAID.

On shared hosting services, like Hostgator, you can copy the /etc/php.ini
locally to your account and  make whatever changes you need to make Joomla
happy for installation and increase the memory limit. You can also use
.htaccess to override those things as well. In the CPANEL there are
additional options for PHP. The server on Hostgator doesn't need to be
re-started for them to take effect. I forget what configuration of PHP they
are using to achieve this. I know on my own CentOS server, I do have to
restart httpd. I think it has to do with some option on PHP at compile time
(of PHP itself) if you want things to take immediate effect or not.

Shared hosting can have its limits, and often times you don't know what
they might even be until you start doing production. There is usually a
work around but sometimes the limits aren't even documented.

Thanks, feeling better already.
When you save the change in Cpanel, it restarts the service.
HostGator, GoDaddy and many others do not publish their real 
conflagrations. Even when you do a php info page.


We have been playing with Varnish to speed up the sites and when there 
is a need, we will write a 'pressflow' like system for Joomla.
It may be a Joomla Fork. It will depend on what direction a project goes in.
I got tired of other peoples machines so I now have my own NOC in Tarrytown.
Our hosting is by invite only.

I have tried several different hosting companies over the years (since 2004) and the one I keep coming back to is Hostgator.? I have been disappointed by all the others.? The only other one I like is Imageleet if you need hosting that supports video processing.? Hostgator's support is very responsive and is available 24/7 via online chat and email.? And the pricing is excellent.

Yes. I reccomend hostofthecentury.com. It is my godaddy reseller site and
I'm hosting both Joomla and WordPress sites with it and have zero problems.
Plus, if you need any help with it, I can take care of that. If you're
interested let me know. Also, using Linux for CMS hosting is the best
choice.

Thanks,
Thad Jasonis

I was looking into phpfog.com a few weeks ago.
Interesting concept. You don't pay by the server, but by the 
pre-configured website (they call it "apps").
First 3 apps/websites are free, but if you want you own custom domain 
name it is $5/mo.

You click "create", then the "joomla" button, select a login/password, 
and a fresh blank joomla site is ready for you in 1 minute.  It's sort 
of like a managed website hosting. You don't worry about keeping the 
server/ operating system up and running, just the Joomla.

This seems like it would be good for testing Joomla or other popular 
apps for free, or simple cheap low traffic hosting.

I haven't committed to buying anything from them yet, but found their 
whole "cloud hosting" concept was interesting.

We need volunteers for our annual Joomla Day Weekend, in Sept./Oct 2012.
(This is not for Joomla Camp)
We are creating a list of venues and will visit them.
Active volunteers will get a discount to the event and special swag.

Please only volunteer if you will commit the time.
Too many people mean well, but never do what they promise.
This causes delays in planning as some one else now has to do your work.
What is needed right now:
1) Finding and visiting venues
2) Site design

Please concoct me off list, to cut down on emails.

Thanks

Scott Wolpow

Hi everyone!

The reason I write is that I intend to start my Masters next year and I'd
like to ask for information.

I'd like to ask:

- Is anyone researching academically Joomla?
- Does anyone know someone who is researching content management systems
and, more specifically, Joomla?

I'll appreciate any information.

Best regards!

Maybe compared to some really bad hosts, but not compared to Hostgator.

Hi there,

I have pretty limited experience with Network Solution and their .Net
shopping cart. I did 
Not have ftp access to site and certain template weak points we needed to
solved by JavaScript.
They were expensive regarding what they offer. For Joomla it is good Go
Daddy hosting, some persons
I know say that Go Daddy is slow (shared hosting, one server computer for
many sites). If you want fast Go Daddy hosting 
you need to purchase virtual server ($46 instead of $14 per month):

http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting.aspx?ci=9009

Good hosting is also:
http://www.ipower.com/ipower/index.bml

It allows you to edit php.ini, has CPanel.

It is good to ask how many simultaneous files downloads hosting offers per
browser ip. One
Hosting was allowing only 6 browsers connections at time, to be more secure
against attacks
But that appears to be limitation for shopping cart of my client because his
site was loading slow.

Best?regards,
Sasa

Everyone knows Godaddy is one of the worst hosts around.? Every client I've had who was on Godaddy was hacked badly.

If you look at Mike Carson's presentation on Joomla Security (presented at NYC JoomlaDay 2011) http://www.slideshare.net/carson3511/securing-your-joomla-website, you will see he lists 4 hosts to absolutely stay away from:? Godaddy, dreamhost, siteground and yahoo.

Hi there,

 

In most cases memory limit is reached when classes and code from database

Allocated to many memory. This can be increased by changing php.ini file,

If php.ini is not available, setting can be changed from PHP code, example:

 

php.ini

max_execution_time = 30

max_input_time = 60; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing
request data

;max_input_nesting_level = 64 ; Maximum input variable nesting level

memory_limit = 128M                    ; Maximum amount of memory a script
may consume (128MB)

 

; Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.

post_max_size = 128M

 

; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.

upload_max_filesize = 256M

 

PHP code:

 

  ini_set("display_errors","1");

  ini_set("error_reporting",E_ALL);

 

  ini_set("memory_limit", "128M");

  ini_set("post_max_size", "128M");

  ini_set("upload_max_filesize", "128M");

 

In most of my projects I am adding Custom error handler, attached.

It will be good to copy/paste in index.php file. It shows error

In browser like:

 

Error occurred in php file
 at line
.error message is
.

 

And it also saves error into /_errors.log.txt so you can over FTP see

Error that occurred when visitors has browsed site and date and time of
error.

 

      $backtrace = debug_backtrace();

 

In attached code is used to show error in browser like this:

 

Error occurred in:



.Filename.class.php at line 78



.Previous Filename.class.php at line 178



.Previous 2nd Filename.class.php at line 88

etc


 

So you will know what scripts/functions/classes has consumed memory.

 

Best regards,

Sasa

Thanks, feeling better already.
When you save the change in Cpanel, it restarts the service.
HostGator, GoDaddy and many others do not publish their real conflagrations.
Even when you do a php info page.

On shared hosting services, like Hostgator, you can copy the /etc/php.ini
locally to your account and  make whatever changes you need to make Joomla
happy for installation and increase the memory limit. You can also use
.htaccess to override those things as well. In the CPANEL there are
additional options for PHP. The server on Hostgator doesn't need to be
re-started for them to take effect. I forget what configuration of PHP they
are using to achieve this. I know on my own CentOS server, I do have to
restart httpd. I think it has to do with some option on PHP at compile time
(of PHP itself) if you want things to take immediate effect or not.

 

Shared hosting can have its limits, and often times you don't know what they
might even be until you start doing production. There is usually a work
around but sometimes the limits aren't even documented.

Hi there,

 

In most cases memory limit is reached when classes and code from database

Allocated to many memory. This can be increased by changing php.ini file,

If php.ini is not available, setting can be changed from PHP code, example:

 

php.ini

max_execution_time = 30

max_input_time = 60; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing
request data

;max_input_nesting_level = 64 ; Maximum input variable nesting level

memory_limit = 128M                    ; Maximum amount of memory a script
may consume (128MB)

 

; Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.

post_max_size = 128M

 

; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.

upload_max_filesize = 256M

 

PHP code:

 

  ini_set("display_errors","1");

  ini_set("error_reporting",E_ALL);

 

  ini_set("memory_limit", "128M");

  ini_set("post_max_size", "128M");

  ini_set("upload_max_filesize", "128M");

 

In most of my projects I am adding Custom error handler, attached.

It will be good to copy/paste in index.php file. It shows error

In browser like:

 

Error occurred in php file
 at line
.error message is
.

 

And it also saves error into /_errors.log.txt so you can over FTP see

Error that occurred when visitors has browsed site and date and time of
error.

 

      $backtrace = debug_backtrace();

 

In attached code is used to show error in browser like this:

 

Error occurred in:



.Filename.class.php at line 78



.Previous Filename.class.php at line 178



.Previous 2nd Filename.class.php at line 88

etc


 

So you will know what scripts/functions/classes has consumed memory.

 

Best regards,

Sasa

I get this:

 

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to
allocate 6859888 bytes) in

Message-ID: <CB56D09B.1F814%toddsugi@gmail.com>

Hi,

I updated from 1.6.2 to 2.5.1 (locally) as a test.  But noticed that my
menus stopped working because:
1. the menu id were changed to classes
2. Because my quotes in Eternal URL ? link were changed to '&quot;'
I was able to update my CSS to fix the 1st issue,  but I'm not able to
figure out how to over ride the '&quot;' to display as ".  I tried to add a
'\ ' in front of the " but it still changed the HTML to '&quot;'

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I would like to upgrade the live site to 2.5.1 eventually because I've
noticed it's MUCH FASTER!!!

Thanks,
Todd

Have you tried clearing your browser cache?

That seems to fix everything Joomla these days. The admin menus on all
Joomla 1.6 to 2.5 sites that I upgraded did not work but I was able to
quickly fix the problem by just flushing out the browser cache.

Todd,

1.? You are installing a file that is not a module installation package.

2.? Do not use Joomla 1.6.2!? There have been many security upgrade patches and bug fixes since then.??

Check to make sure that you do not have to unzip the package first.

I would also unzip it and make sure there is an XML file there.

Hi Todd.

Which method are you using to install it?
- Upload Package File
- Install from Directory
- Install from URL

I mostly install using Upload Package File myself. This is where you
have the .zip file of the extension on your workstation and then
select to have it uploaded.

Scott has a very good point. Make a copy of the .zip file in a
temporary directory and unzip it. See if it contains .zip files in it,
if so, then you need to have those uploaded separately.

I also agree to upgrade the website, but you might have reasons why
you can't do that immediately.

It's really weird because I created an akeeba backup file from the live site
and then recreated it locally on my home computer.  On my computer locally I
have no problems installing the module.

This can also be a file permission / ownership issue. For example, if
Joomla can't copy the "unzipped" files to the server, it won't be able to
read them and find the manifest. I'd start by checking file/folder
permissions and ownership.

I'm wondering if this could be a permissions use with the server.

You could try downloading another .zip file of that module (assuming
it's free or select another free one from the Joomla extensions
directory) and see if that one installs or has the same problem. It's
also possible the .zip you are trying to install is corrupted or
missing something.

Hi Todd,

 

Source code of fresh Joomla installation has this code for install:

It is possible that your archive file was too big, so PHP upload limit has reached and uploaded

File does not exists after upload, it is also possible that your archive is damaged, you should

Test is archive damaged by opening it and testing from WinRar, third option is that on your

Hosting PHP does not have allowed zip extension:

 

PHP.INI file:

[PHP_ZIP]

extension=php_zip.dll

 

You should upload by ftp to site root attached file and call it from the browser, and  should be able to check:

 


Registered PHP Streams 

php, file, data, http, ftp, compress.zlib, https, ftps, zip 

 

zip


Zip 

enabled 


Extension Version 

$Id: php_zip.c 293036 2010-01-03 09:23:27Z sebastian $ 


Zip version 

1.8.11 


Libzip version 

0.9.0 

 

If none of this gets working, you should contact me privately I will find and resolve solution.

 

Best regards,

Sasa

This can also be a file permission / ownership issue. For example, if Joomla can't copy the "unzipped" files to the server, it won't be able to read them and find the manifest. I'd start by checking file/folder permissions and ownership.

Check to make sure that you do not have to unzip the package first.

I would also unzip it and make sure there is an XML file there.

I figured it out.  I had the wrong path to the tmp folder specified?  I had
it going to the root/tmp folder instead of the public_html/tmp folder.
Thanks for everyone's help!

Hi Tod,

 

Solution with magic quotes is:

 

    if (get_magic_quotes_gpc())

    {

      return stripslashes($value);

    }

    else

    {

      return $value;

    }

 

If Joomla source at some code has unsupported magic quotes enabled, there

Need to be disable magic quotes in php.ini or over command:

 

PHP.INI:

; Magic quotes for incoming GET/POST/Cookie data.

magic_quotes_gpc = Off

 

or add this line of code to Joomla index.php:

 

<?php

 

ini_set("magic_quotes_gpc "," Off ");

 

?>

 

If none of solutions work please let me know.

 

Best regards,

Sasa

Have you tried clearing your browser cache?

 

That seems to fix everything Joomla these days. The admin menus on all
Joomla 1.6 to 2.5 sites that I upgraded did not work but I was able to
quickly fix the problem by just flushing out the browser cache.

Hi,

 

I updated from 1.6.2 to 2.5.1 (locally) as a test.  But noticed that my
menus stopped working because:

1.	the menu id were changed to classes
2.	Because my quotes in Eternal URL - link were changed to '&quot;'

I was able to update my CSS to fix the 1st issue,  but I'm not able to
figure out how to over ride the '&quot;' to display as ".  I tried to add a
'\ ' in front of the " but it still changed the HTML to '&quot;'  

 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

 

I would like to upgrade the live site to 2.5.1 eventually because I've
noticed it's MUCH FASTER!!!

 

Thanks,

Todd

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv-wSTvNYc1iH=rSjhgdfh6dDUGUTeUc4WvOTdj7vVnCyA@mail.gmail.com>

I need to upgrade two Joomla 1.5 websites. I'd like a list of what was not
provided with Joomla for the extensions so I could determine their
replacements or if they are even needed in a current stable version of
Joomla.

Is there an easy way to do this than going one by one from
the extensions manager (in Joomla 1.5)? Could a MySQL query produce a
report easy enough? A shell script? Thanks!

If you go to Extensions -> Install/Uninstall -> Components, you will see which are the "Joomla Project" components.? Same for modules and plugins.
the URL is?[YOURDOMAIN]/administrator/index.php?option=com_installer&task=manage&type=components

Thanks, Donna! For some reason I thought that feature was only in Joomla
1.7 and not 1.5.

OpenPotion Asynchronous?Google?Analytics only works on Joomla 1.5. The

David,

What does OpenPotion do that Google's native asynchronous GA script
doesn't? Knowing that will help us make a good suggestion.

Best,

Matt

Hi Matt.

"This Plugin is an improvement upon the wonderful BIGSHOT Google
Analytics plugin 1.5.3 and puts the Asynchronous Tracking Code for
Google Analytics into your site just above the closing html head tag
for faster loading. "

It's a Joomla plug-in where the non-technical user can put in their GA
code through the administrative interface to have Joomla include the
GA scripts on each page served. There are also some parameters to
handle multi domain tracking, but it's mostly to give the user an easy
way to input GA code without having to edit anything such as HTML or
PHP code. It's also helpful to be able to easily enable/disable it
during development or testing so it doesn't report all the page loads
to the report as real traffic.

OpenPotion Asynchronous?Google?Analytics is still available in the
Joomla Extension directory at joomla.org if someone wants to check it
out. Is there a replacement for this people are happy with for
1.7/2.x? Thanks!

David Roth

I have found that the Simple Image Pro Gallery plug-in by Joomla Works
works very well with Joomla 2.5.

http://www.joomlaworks.gr/content/view/25/42/

Very easy to install and many display options.

Yootheme Widgetkit gets my vote as well. Plus you get other widgets along

i've had some strange error messages in the widget kit for 2.5, and I saw
on the forums others had the problems as well.  But the widget kit is
great, and maybe in some sites it will work properly, and I am sure it will
get better.

Hi David,

Thanks. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of an equivalent plugin for 1.7. It
doesn't sound terribly complex, and may
be something that could be converted to be compatible without a huge
undertaking. Have you tried installing it in 1.7 to see what happens?

Best,

I've found two extensions which do work with 1.7. One is a good
replacement (Asynchronous Google Analytics Plugin) and the other
handles the GA reporting (AG Google Analytics). AG Google Analytics
looks useful although I've not had a chance to test it out.

Hi 'tri-state area' joomies...how about a great trip up to the
mountains???  I will be presenting, and you will get lots of joomla info,
networking...here are the details...

Joomla Day New England is just around the corner, March 31!

Participants can save $15 if they register before Feb. 29.

This year, we're offering a hands-on Joomla templates workshop on March 30,
the night before Joomla Day. Taught by Barb Ackemann and Matt Thomas, this
will be a great opportunity for those who are new to template construction,
as well as those who are experienced, to learn tips and tricks from
template masters.

You might not believe this, but I can't find the CSS in Joomla 2.5.1
for footer1 or footer2. Is this not assigned all the time? Or is it
generated with through the magic of PHP and that's making it hard to
find?

<div class="footer1">Copyright ? 2012 My Little Test. All Rights Reserved.</div>

Assuming footer1 and footer2 isn't assigned all the time, where should
it be? template.css?

In case you are wondering why I want to know this, I want to be able
to use a different font color for footer2. Thanks!

Hi David,

Footer code is in:

\modules\mod_footer\tmpl\default.php

<div class="footer1<?php echo $moduleclass_sfx ?>"><?php echo $lineone;
?></div>
<div class="footer2<?php echo $moduleclass_sfx ?>"><?php echo
JText::_('MOD_FOOTER_LINE2'); ?></div>

If you have site Url I will be able to check are some css styles are
overriding.

Best regards,
Sasa

Hi Sara.

Thanks for the reply and offer. It's on an intranet, so there is no
outside access to it.

I've done a grep -il footer2 `find .` on the installation of Joomla
and other than the default.php and the .ini file, I don't see any CSS
for footer1 or footer2.

I was using Google Chrome's Inspect Element hoping I could see where
it was getting it's CSS from but didn't see anything. When I do a View
Source of that page, all the .css is part of this Joomla installation
so it's not getting it from anything external. It might not be set at
all is what I'm thinking. I had the impression that CSS is like HTML
in that it doesn't generate any errors or complains about anything if
it's missing.

The template is from Rocket Theme called Hivemind. It might not be set
at all is what I'm thinking now.

I will have to dig around in mod_footer to see what it's doing with
the ini files mod_footer stuff.

Does it use Gantry?
If so, look in there.
Have you searched the DB?

Hi Scott.

No, it doesn't use Gantry.

I did a Mysqldump and footer1 and footer2 don't appear any place.

Message-ID: <2B529FC5-E6F6-470D-B422-6ED1C795952A@whyknott.com>

Hello-
Question for everyone.....I have a client who wants to access his Joomla admin via an Android mobile phone. He wants to upload photos to his gallery and create articles etc. His site uses prodominately K2 component rather than the Joomla core. Do you have any extension recommendation I can use for this client or will this need to be custom programmed? I found several free extensions but nothing with K2 support so far.

Hi Kenny,

I have never tried to view a Joomla K2 back-end on a mobile device, but you
could look at the new Admin Praise admin templates. I am not sure how well
they would work with K2.

Admin Praise has a nice back-end admin theme that works well with iPhone
and it should work fine with Android. (But remember, these screens are
small and unless he has small fingers, it is not gong to be easy to type
and upload photos.)  www.adminpraise.com

If your client wants to make their mobile friendly, they will probably need
to switch to another theme that uses media queries. JoomlaBamboo and
JoomlArt have released "responsive" themes that can be viewed on mobile
devices as well as 27-inch+ LED screens.

It also might be possible to modify his current theme with K2 into a
responsible theme using media queries but would probably require a lot of
work with CSS.

Hi Kenny,

One of solutions can be building API and call that API from application
Installed on phone. I know for possibility to build similar applications
For iPhone, iPad, Android phone,  Android touchpad, Blackberry and Windows
OS.

Best regards,
Saaa

css is not assigned to all classes and tags.? It's there for when/if you want to modify the design or layout.? It's called "thinking ahead".?

You might not believe this, but I can't find the CSS in Joomla 2.5.1
for footer1 or footer2. Is this not assigned all the time? Or is it
generated with through the magic of PHP and that's making it hard to
find?

<div class="footer1">Copyright ? 2012 My Little Test. All Rights Reserved.</div>

Assuming footer1 and footer2 isn't assigned all the time, where should
it be? template.css?

In case you are wondering why I want to know this, I want to be able
to use a different font color for footer2. Thanks!

------------------------------

Install Firebug in Firefox. Then you can open the web page in Firefox, right click on an element, and select 'inspect with Firebug'. At the bottom of the screen, you will be able to insepct the html, and the css. On the right side, the css will be indicated, along with the files it is contained in. You'll be able to track back where css is set, and where it is over-ridden.

Does anyone know a quick way to find an element in firebug? is there a search of the css?

Hi Marko,

 

Select FireBug CSS Tab, you will be able also to select css file name to search in for.

 

Hit CTRL + F, select checkboxes at top right of FireBug console and enter search term in search text field.

 

Best regards,

Sasa

Install Firebug in Firefox and use that to inspect the element. You'll see the css and the files the css is set for the element on the bottom right side. You'll see where the css is over-ridden from earlier files too. On the bottom left you'll see the html, and as you hover over the html, the view above will highlight the element the html is creating. click on the div and the appropriate css will be shown on the bottom right.

Does anyone know how to search that css in Firebug? That capability would save me some time.

Try this:

In your CSS stylesheet file declare the classes and add an *!important* at
the end of the line. Notice the exclamation point (!) before *important*.

This should override other declarations, if any.

.footer1 {color: #F03 *!*important;}
.footer1 {color: #C00 *!*important;}

Thanks for the help, Helv?cio. Very useful!

Where is the best place to add your own custom CSS as an override for
a commercial Joomla template so that it doesn't get wiped out by
updates? Thanks!

First, I'd check wether I can change this particular point through my
template's parameters. If I can't, I'd look for a way to summon my new CSS
file from in the template's parameters. No luck? I'd give it a try to
adding the following line to the head of my template:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo $this->baseurl ?>/templates/<?php
echo $this->template ?>/css/mynewfile.css" type="text/css" />

If this doesn't work (Commercial templates can be tricky sometimes...) I'd
go to the template's support forum or support system, if it's a paid
template.

If there's a problem, there's a solution.

All the best!

Hi Ellen,

I have never heard of Joomlavi, but most professional template developers
(JoomArt, Monster, etc.) use some type of framework these days because it
is a faster and more efficient way to development templates. The developer
just has to crank out the design and everything else falls in place. (I
have also noticed that a lot of smaller template companies are using the
JoomlArt T3 framework. I would not surprise me if Joomlavi is using this
framework.)

The prices at Joomlavi are cheap, although, I am always leery of template
developers who ask for gender during the registration process :-)

Keep us posted on how it works out.

Subject: [joomla] mysqldump error - ' Can't create/write to file...'
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_z41WyqGG9sBYEXSrxb+VRAF0eWfE5zNg2Ea0LbwcP+g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using Joomla 2.5.1 on my CentOS 6.2 server running MySQL Server
version: 5.1.61.  All the sudden I get error messages when logged in
as Admin when trying to access the Menu Manager items such as Home.
Things were working fine the night before so I look in the PHP error
log:

So it appears to be MySQL related. So I decided to do a mysqldump of
the database Joomla 2.5.1 is using to rebuild the database and come up
with this error message:

mysqldump: Couldn't execute 'show fields from `cmyzk_assets`': Can't
create/write to file '/tmp/#sql_6da_0.MYI' (Errcode: 13) (1)

I do a ' perror 13' command to see what Errcode 13 means and get this:
OS error code  13:  Permission denied

This doesn't make sense to me because I'm logged in as root doing all
this. Furthermore, I didn't change anything (that I know of).  I
looked to see how MySql is running:

root      1665  0.0  0.0 108256  1432 ?        S    12:15   0:00
/bin/sh /usr/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir=/home/mysql
--socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
--pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --basedir=/usr --user=mysql
mysql     1754  0.0  0.5 217712 19536 ?        Sl   12:15   0:01
/usr/libexec/mysqld --basedir=/usr --datadir=/home/mysql --user=mysql
--log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
--socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

I don't know what the next step should be. I'd appreciate suggestions. Thanks!

Hey Laura

How are you? It's Ofer from Israel.

After been in the JDNY11, I've heard about requirement for module map for
Joomla and drag&drop interface for modules positioning... I'm proud to
announce on my new extension called TP2.

TP2 is the only extension that give you the ability to see ALL your
positions on one page and use DRAG N DROP interface for adding new modules
in any positions.

You can see demonstration in the next link:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D28bir1BZZI

The price for the first month would be 20$, after it, will be raised to
30$. Because I've personal enjoy the J!Day in NY, and the people in the New
York community, I've created coupon for NY JUG: TP2NY. This will discount
25% and cost 15$. The coupon is only for one month.

Wishing you the best.

Hi,

 

I have bit aversion from all that is coming from China (Goliath) or Israel
(David) as well from wrong coded emails:

 

>oferc666 at gmail.com

 

Everybody has past, good addition to that word is "sentence".

 

Best regards,

Sounds like you MySql root user got corrupted.

I suggest you search on lost MySql root password and follow those 
directions.

Hi Scott.

Thanks for the reply.

I'm able at the command line do a mysql -p and login with the usual
password. Are you referring to resetting some other
password/permissions for the mysqld?

Never had a serious MySQL problem like this before. Time for the long pants. :-)

I'm using Joomla 2.5.1 on my CentOS 6.2 server running MySQL Server
version: 5.1.61.  All the sudden I get error messages when logged in
as Admin when trying to access the Menu Manager items such as Home.
Things were working fine the night before so I look in the PHP error

So it appears to be MySQL related. So I decided to do a mysqldump of
the database Joomla 2.5.1 is using to rebuild the database and come up
with this error message:

mysqldump: Couldn't execute 'show fields from `cmyzk_assets`': Can't
create/write to file '/tmp/#sql_6da_0.MYI' (Errcode: 13) (1)

I do a ' perror 13' command to see what Errcode 13 means and get this:
OS error code  13:  Permission denied

This doesn't make sense to me because I'm logged in as root doing all
this. Furthermore, I didn't change anything (that I know of).  I
looked to see how MySql is running:

root      1665  0.0  0.0 108256  1432 ?        S    12:15   0:00
/bin/sh /usr/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir=/home/mysql
--socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
--pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --basedir=/usr --user=mysql
mysql     1754  0.0  0.5 217712 19536 ?        Sl   12:15   0:01
/usr/libexec/mysqld --basedir=/usr --datadir=/home/mysql --user=mysql
--log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
--socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

I don't know what the next step should be. I'd appreciate suggestions.
Thanks!

As root I can 'su mysql'. I've never actually done that before, have
not had a reason until now. I did try to create a test file in /tmp
and it gave a message of "Permission denied". I'd think that alone is
odd, shouldn't mysql as a user be able to write to /tmp? This may be
related to the problem? Thanks!

Checked the amount of free disk space on the machine?

Hi Rolan.

Space doesn't seem to be an issue even /tmp has 7.1G free.

This is a strange problem, and not sure what even caused it. Could
Joomla 2.5.1 have corrupted the database? Is this a bug from a new
release of MySQL?

I did an fsck on the disks and looked in the logs, nothing wrong there either.

I just checked via admin the other Joomla installations on the same
in-house server and all of this same problem with:

500 - An error has occurred.
Missing field in the database: JTableContent   id. Missing field in

So did MySQL get hosed up on this server? Should I consider
re-installing MySQL? Thanks!

Hi everyone.

Unreal, I solved the problem. I don't know how or why, but /tmp
instead of it being 1777 and owned by root and belonging to group
root, it was owned by owner 502 (no 502 on this server) and group
david. And the permissions were off too so it couldn't be written to.
502 is on another server here, with user 'david' (that's me!) is on
every server.

How this happened I don't know. This is one for the X-files.

Special Agent David ;-)

Glad you found it.
When troubleshooting always start with the most permissive user and the 
simplest task.
Then add complications.

Hi there everyone!

I've installed K2 on my brand new Joomla 2.5.x installation and all is OK,
BUT K2 SEF is somewhat awkward...

What's your suggestion of an non-commercial extension I can use?

Thanks!

Hello,

Can anyone recommend a member directory extension that does not relate to the registered users - something of an address book. ?I need to be able to import via ?CSV, and have custom fields.

The Joomla version I am using is 1.6


Thanks 

Kirill

Hi Marko,

 

Select FireBug CSS Tab, you will be able also to select css file name to search in for:

 



 

Hit CTRL + F, select checkboxes and search term and hit:

Install Firebug in Firefox and use that to inspect the element. You'll see the css and the files the css is set for the element on the bottom right side. You'll see where the css is over-ridden from earlier files too. On the bottom left you'll see the html, and as you hover over the html, the view above will highlight the element the html is creating. click on the div and the appropriate css will be shown on the bottom right.

Does anyone know how to search that css in Firebug? That capability would save me some time.
