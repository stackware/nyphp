Subject: [joomla] Quicktime player for website
Message-ID: <846199.53382.qm@web35601.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Looking for a way to play mov or mp4 videos on the site so that the movie can be viewed via the iphone.  Tried AllVideos and AVReloaded, but I can only get flv videos to show up.  The QuickTime logo flashes on the screen and then disappears, and there's nothing to click on to get it started.  I have a direct link to the mp4 file for iphone users, but this does not have controls for pausing, etc.

Anyone have a solution or suggestion?

Thanks.

I am having difficulty finding the method docs on the quick time site.

 

I'd suggest using the JCE editor media insert plug in

 

I believe that module is part of the paid support version - but the code
once you have it is GPL

I upload the video to YouTube, then I copy and paste the code they give into
my article.

It works fine.

Well, I finally followed the Camtasia directions for exporting to iPhone. It's m4v. I thought mp4 or mov would do. 

So I have flv for computer users and a link to the m4v for iPhone users. 

That should be sufficient, eh?  iPhone users aren't going to watch it inline, anyway.

While I was planning on being at the meeting tonight, I see I have a
conflicting meeting downtown so most likely I won't be able to make it.
I also won't be able to dial in since I will be in a different meeting.

with regrets!

Subject: [joomla] Where can I give joomla my baseurl?
Message-ID: <haslg1$ffd$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi,

I am starting my first joomla-website.
I made my own template, but the graphics are not shown, because the path 
is wrong. 

Obviously PHP should get the base-path by 
'echo $this->baseurl' in the template, but the baseurl is not echoed.

So where can I give joomla my baseurl?

Thanks in advance
Kerstin

Sorry, a simple mistake I made. Forgot the 'echo $this->baseurl' before 
the graphic-path, I had it only in the stylesheet-path and there it 
worked already.

Greetings
Kerstin

Cool! Anthony totally converted me to LightTPD with his presentation
last year at KickApps - maybe that could get a revisit?

Another thing I'd like to see us do is a live setup of a Joomla
specifically for blogging, using only FOSS goodies.

I read all the tutorials, try all the demos, and they SUCK. Tired of
using wordpress when I'd like to use Joomla...

Anyone want to chair that session?

Lastly, we should start adding these topics to the queue on the NYCJUG
website, and start lining up speakers. Thanks to the JDayNUC we upped
our profile, and need to continue to appear organized ;-)

Also I have started to pre-approach Colleges about mini-Joomla days for 
students. Goal is more developers.
This would be low to no cost.
I will start working on the Non-profit next week so we are ready to rock 
in November.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla day: Don't use the water bottle
Message-ID: <852023.35592.qm@web30808.mail.mud.yahoo.com>



Congratulations to everyone who helped make Joomla day happen.

One quick comment about the clear plastic water bottle that was part of the swag:

Do NOT drink water from it! Throw it out!

My wife is a science journalist (writes for Wired, Wall St Journal, National Geographic, etc). She took one look at it and told me to throw it away. Since the bottom of the bottle is stamped with the "7" recycle number, that means that it is made from Bisphenol A.

Factsheets issued by  The Centers for Disease Control -- http://www.cdc.gov/ExposureReport/pdf/factsheet_bisphenol.pdf
and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences National
Toxicology Program on Bisphenol A:
http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/docs/bpa-factsheet.pdf

Notes:  
1. The NTP has ?some concern?for effects on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures to BPA.

2. The same government agency advises people to:  Avoid plastic containers with the #7 on the bottom.

3. The CDC says that "When
laboratory test animals are dosed during pregnancy, BPA has been shown
to have hormone-like effects on the developing reproductive system and
neurobehavioral changes in the offspring."

As my wife points out, the government is usually accused of underplaying risks. 


The problem is that the Bisphenol A can add Estrogin to whatever is stored in the bottle. Adding Estrogin to your diet is usually not a good idea for guys. And it can cause problems for women too.

So be safe: throw away drinking bottles that have the "7" in the recycle symbol. 


The effect is small, so no worries if you've already drunken from the bottle. But throw it away now.


Regards,

Larry
ps. Since not everyone at the Joomla Day is on this dist list, I suggest that this information be sent to everyone who registered for the conference.

Hi Dan,

Hope you found your answer, I was just cleaning out my unread email and
noticed this one attached as a reply to another string I wasn't paying
attention to.

Turn OFF SEF and then try your links.  If that solves the problem, then the
issue is likely older links tied into some custom SEF component causing
trouble.

IMO, there are really only 2 solutions to this problem.

1. better documentation/tutorial/s so that people could get a basic blog up
and running. A better blogging template in the default install would also
help.

2. a default blogging install "profile" similar to the way KickApps has
their own default install. Joomla needs to have an OOB blogging solution or
WP will keep kicking it in the arse.

Also, an important question is, does Google consider Joomla to be "blogging:
software (and not merely a CMS) ?

One reason this is an important question is that Google made a change last
month in the way it displays blog and news feeds. Specifically it tags a
feed as a "Blog" only if it is generated using software on a specific list
of blogging software.

I wonder if Joomla! is even on the list ??

Yes and probably should have been in the keynote room, *all things
considered* but then hindsight as they say is golden. Or something like
that.

First of all thanks for posting this at all. I was wondering about it
myself, and you've cleared up the uncertaintly.

Secondly, thanks for such a toughtfu, detailed, footnoted post about this.
The only thing I would disagree with is your advice to throw it out-- you
don't have to throw it out.

Since it's Bisphenol A, it can be recycled.    ;-)

cheers,

Forest Mars

For that matter, it can be used in other ways.  A dice carrier.  A mini
nature aquarium.  Pen holder.

Thanks Forest Mars for your kind comments. The great content from the post was all courtesy of my wife, Josie Glausiusz. Google her to see some excellent science writing. :-)

Re recycling -- good point, but you may want to consider removing, damaging or destroying the top to be sure that no one else sees a shiny new water bottle and decides to 'freecycle' it.

But the main thing was a very nice conference. Congrats again to the organizers.

Regards,

Larry

ANyone have experience putting Joomla up on GoDaddy? I'd like to do a 
basic install and ideally have SSH access to the account. Not sure about 
GoDaddy's service, etc, thus I'd like to do my own. Unfortunately, this 
is for an existing GD customer so not ready to migrate, even if they could.

Thanks!

Just want to thank all the organizers for a great JoomlaDayNYC2009. I would
like to take Laura up on her suggestion to start another user group. I am
located in Fairfield CT (about an hour from NYC) and can provide a venue for
up to about 20 participants. Is anyone interested in joining another group,
maybe 'closer to home' ? We will not schedule it to conflict with NYC group
so you can participate in both if you want.Please email me if you are
interested at ellen.rothwax at gmail.com.
Thanks again to organizers, presenters and participants for an inspiring and
informative workshop.

Mitch had the right idea. Philly also wants to have a group. We can 
serve as the model and work together. Each can hold smaller days and we 
can all funnel into a larger east coast  Joomla day. Think Worldcon ish.

Leam,
I used to host my joomla! sites on godaddy and experienced nothing but a lot of problems...I would really encourage your client if you can to migrate to a different host...not only did I have issues because of the godaddy servers, but their support wasn't good if it had anything to do with joomla.

I am sure the group can recommend other inexpensive options...I like hostgator.com, but listen to all of the suggestions, I am sure youwill find the right way to go...

-- Laura

Can we get a list of presentation suggestions and the people who attend meetings vote on them?  I think there are maybe 2 out of the 20 who attend the meetings that would do anything to the server.  Most of us use a webhosting service to take care of the server.

I re-enabled the suggestion list which can be commented on and voted on.  There was one thing on the old list from way back when and that's already been done.

Cool! Anthony totally converted me to LightTPD with his presentation
last year at KickApps - maybe that could get a revisit?

Another thing I'd like to see us do is a live setup of a Joomla
specifically for blogging, using only FOSS goodies.

I read all the tutorials, try all the demos, and they SUCK. Tired of
using wordpress when I'd like to use Joomla...

Anyone want to chair that session?

Lastly, we should start adding these topics to the queue on the NYCJUG
website, and start lining up speakers. Thanks to the JDayNUC we upped
our profile, and need to continue to appear organized ;-)

 From what I'm seeing, it appears that the concern over food grade polycarbonate being a health risk is likely just urban hysteria.

There are a lot greater risks to my health than that very nice water bottle. I like it and I'm keeping mine. Thank you Dioscouri, and all the sponsors for their generosity. Thanks to the presenters for their remarkable efforts. Thanks to NYCJUG for putting together this great event.

@ellen regarding a CT Joomla user group... I would definitely be interested,
learned a lot during the NYC Joomla day and live in Stamford.

Hi all of you joomla folks...ok it is time to get a survey out for JoomlaDayNYC...

any recommendations of non-commercial joomla survey tool???

If not, I see I can use survey monkey...but that is 'non joomla', I think I should use a joomla product, since we are 'joomla'...anyone that wants to work with me in creating this survey, just email me!


thanks,
Laura

LimeSurvey is the open source survey tool: http://www.limesurvey.org/

So I'd say install that before using Survey Monkey.  It installs the same
way Joomla does, so it's a quick, fun project to learn something new.

Does anyone know how to enable image only menu links in 1.5 without legacy
mode?

The Docs give a great solution for this using legacy mode, but really don't
want to turn on legacy mode just for this.

Just wondering if there is a status update on how he was doing?  I've got to

Does anyone have a copy of Magic Menus?

The site is gone, but it's a nice module that lets you easily use alternate
fonts in menus.

It was still in the JED post-July:
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/structure-a-navigation/menu-systems/image-menus/4886

Alternately another module that does something similar would be great....

I host several Joomla sites with A2Hosting. They support the Fantastico
script library. Joomla installation is a snap - I was really surprised how
painless - even better than Joomla's on installation script

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastico_%28web_hosting%29

I suspect any reputable hosting company who offers the Fantastico installer
is a good place to start

Best regards,
-John

I use Bluehost for all my sites and those of clients and Go Daddy for a
client that is not ready to migrate yet. The difference is light years, at
every level. 
Like John mentioned, if a company offers Fantastico or Simple Script it's a
good tell.

I host several Joomla sites with A2Hosting. They support the Fantastico
script library. Joomla installation is a snap - I was really surprised how
painless - even better than Joomla's on installation script

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastico_%28web_hosting%29

I suspect any reputable hosting company who offers the Fantastico installer
is a good place to start

Subject: [joomla] Volunteer time tracking
Message-ID: <4bffc350910190720g62f00905pbe4359f9acf5fd79@mail.gmail.com>

Before I go custom coding, is there any volunteer time tracking apps for
Joomla?

Part of the requirement for all School Assembly members at my childrens
school(http://www.hudsonvalleyschool.org/) is community service hours.
Everyone has to help out for 8 hours a year.

Their current system is an archaic paper sign in sheet, and since the the
School IT guy has upgraded/redesigned the website in Joomla I'd like to get
a decent time tracking app.

Real basic functionality:
Project names
Assembly Members can enter hours worked and assign it to a project.  Send
hours by web, email, sms text message.
A few people should have approval rights on hours for a specific project[so
when someone is running the rummage sale, they can approve hours there]

Total hours worked need to be able to be public or private since I'm not
sure if it should be published for all or not.

I suspect if I custom coded it, I'd use Sobi2 for the project database, and
just code the hour tracking seperately.

Just got home and actually reading the posts.

I'm having a big laugh on this bottle story. I kept mine and just use it as
a souvenir of the great day that I had.

Thank you all!!!!!

Subject: [joomla] Presentation suggestion:  video sharing website
Message-ID: <502068.21070.qm@web35608.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi guys/gals.

I just submitted a Presentation Suggestion on our JUG website: http://joomlanyc.org/index.php?option=com_mtree&task=viewlink&link_id=4&Itemid=0

The presentation would be for creating a video sharing site, like YouTube, using Joomla.

Last week I installed a video sharing component, on a shared webhosting account configured for video sharing sites.  The webhosting is only $8-15/mo. and I'm impressed with their tech support so far.  The component has a free basic version, and the Pro version is only 20 pounds (approx. US$32).  I'm pleasantly surprised with the support for the Pro version.

If you are interested in seeing a presentation on this, vote for it on our JUG site!  :-)

Message-ID: <4bffc350910211326t1bd5dd91of350118a9073ccdc@mail.gmail.com>

I know I've been away, but I wanted to mention that if there is a way to
find someone to organize snacks, and perhaps someone to sponsor them, I
always found them very helpful for the people working in the city who ended
up coming in late.

Of course, preferably something more nutritous than cookies and
brownies[though tasty].

Not being in the city, I have no idea how much it costs to order those sorts
of things down there.  I think subway was something like under $100 for
assorted sandwhiches[of course, as a vegetarian, I'd suggest egg salad, but
I know you don't get a lot of choice on a budget, so whatever fits]

I know we always had a few people showing up directly from work, and
expecting everyone to focus and then go eat afterward makes it harder to
keep people coming month after month.

Hi all,

One of our gold sponsors from JoomlaDayNYC, has requested that I send this email out...

This is from www.Marlboro.edu

For more info please contact: jheslin at marlboro.edu
-Open Source Web Development Certificate (fully online)
We're
offering this certificate fully online starting in January. It's 12
credits, which are all fully transferable to one of our master's
programs. The cert covers design, CSS, Joomla!, and web marketing.

-Joom-ski Weekend
We want to get everyone together for a little Joomla! and a little skiing (2 things we're known for here in Southern Vermont). We're working on the details but it's looking like the weekend of March 6 & 7 for a Saturday of Joomlarificness, followed by skiing on Sunday. Sound good? Let me know.

-Joomla! Day New England '10
I
know it seems like a long way off, but we're looking forward to doing
it all over again next year. We hope you're gonna be joining us for
this one as well.


thanks,
--- Laura

Looks good for me,

If we go skiing will we have to follow the same forks on the slopes?

Subject: [joomla] PHP magic_quotes_gpc
Message-ID: <642abf2e0910241246p51b3f07fj62ad8e340c2dd468@mail.gmail.com>

While moving several Joomla web sites of various versions to a new
hosting service, I noticed on the new hosting service that Joomla!
1.0.12 Stable while logged in as Admin had this message:

"Following PHP Server Settings are not optimal for Security and it is
recommended to change them:

PHP magic_quotes_gpc setting is `OFF` instead of `ON`
Please check the Official Joomla! Server Security post for more information."

Not remembering if it should be ON or OFF or if it matters these days,
I downloaded the latest version of Joomla and installed it to do the
pre-check installation. It didn't complain about PHP magic_quotes_gpc
being OFF.

So my big question for this wet Saturday afternoon is, should this be
OFF for all modern installations of Joomla, or it isn't a security
issue anymore?

Yes, I plan to upgrade all the Joomla web sites to the latest. I
presume the best way to do this is follow the chain of patches?

It's not a matter of version of Joomla, but rather philosophy of PHP
developers.

Turning magic quotes on sanitizes variables automatically so they have less
potential for causing database injection attacks.

Initially, this was suggested as "more secure" because it means the
programmer doesn't have to sanitize the data.

Then the problem is that big apps[like Joomla] get installed on lots of
different platforms, so you can't count on it being turned on.

What is worse, is that you have to use 2 different lines of code for
retrieving variables based on whether magic quotes is on or off.  So when
you have software which can be deployed on platforms you have no control
over, now one line of code has become 4, because you have to do an if/else
clause for every variable retrieval.

So what was initially created to aid programmers in being lazy now causes
more work for programmers.  Hence programmers forced to do more work
inaccurately will say it is less secure because their doing more work.

The long and the short of it is, magic quotes has no impact on server
security.  It's the PHP programming that will have that impact.

Actually, no you can't upgrade from 1.0 to 1.5 - instead you migrate.
Depending on how many components you have this may or may not be painful.

The way we did it recently was to create a dev snapshot of a production
system.
Then installed the migrator component to export all the base joomla stuff.

Then we created another dev site and installed 1.5 onto it, importing the
migration file during setup.

Then we enabled the legacy mode plugin.  I copied over the tables for some
existing components[advanceSEF and Zoomgallery] and then installed the
latest versions of those components to the 1.5 site.

We copied over the contents of the 1.0 templates directory and those worked
in 1.5 with legacy enabled.

Than we updated the templates to 1.5 and turned off legacy mode.

Finally once we were sure the site was correct, the dev site was backed up
and restored to production.

As a side note, I hear there is no legacy mode for 1.6, so it is better to
migrate to 1.5 where you can still enable legacy mode while bringing your
site into full 1.5 compliance, then wait for 1.6 and have to guess on how to
do it.

I suggest you go and look into the code at each and every one of these
lines.

I had this problem more than once and it turned out to be a link path
Dreamweaver created while I moved files around.

G'luck!

Not using Dreamweaver, but thanks. It has to do with the difference 
between how 4 and 5 handles certain items.
Rather than muck with some custom code that was done a few years ago, 
which I do not get paid for, I am going to move it to a php4 machine.

Is this upgraded to Joomla 1.5 or PHP 5.2?

BTW, stay away from PHP 5.3 and Joomla.  It does some weeeeeird things to
Joomla.

There are 2 important errors, 1 is this:

Which makes me think you went to 5.3 and now have some problems with
depreciated functions that were removed.

The other is this:

Which basically says it is copying the uploaded file from one folder to
another, and it is failing due to permission issues.  This could be because
you didn't set write permissions on the target folder, or more likely
because the other error comes from the code retrieving the target folder so
instead the folder is becoming the root.

Everything else is just the import routine throwing errors because the file
it is trying to import does not exist.

Target fold is and was 777, first thing I did. so must be the first 
error again.
What next? Really do not want to port it to my old box, which I am 
shutting down.

While this is a bit of sour grapes, and I am overall thrilled to see a high
profile website[the White House] switiching to an Open Source CMS[Drupal],
it does make me think a bit about just what is it with about Drupal that
makes it penetrate a bit further at the government level.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/26/whitehouse_website_goes_open_source/

By the same token, the local county spent the past 6 months building out
their tourism associated website.  In the end, the functionality leaves me
underwhelmed:
http://www.ulstercountyalive.com/

For example, the lodging directory is fairly basic functionality - and no
rss feeds.

I have found Drupal to have a stronger community of tech geeks using it, but
a weaker community of functional users.  A lot of components for Drupal tend
to be "proof of concept' type's, where I can see how they could be extended
to something functional, but their not quite there.

Joomla, by contrast, has a lot of apps which from a technical perspective
are exactly the same but by changing labels and gearing, they are fully
functional drop in apps to do something.

So why is Drupal making inroads while Joomla seems to be lagging?  Any
thoughts?

Hi all, does anyone use JCE Editor with Joomla. I?ve been using it for a
while but I would like to insert some javascript to make a popup window and
I have javascript enabled in the component but when I go into my article the
javascript is still being stripped out.

If you don?t use JCE do you have another option for popup windows with
Joomla.

Thanks, Kelli

A note of research: Is there an advisory board for open source
technologies to the government, and if so who is participating there?
This is pretty much the case behind the White House website, AFAICT.

That said, this is a good time to compare the state of Joomla versus
the state of Drupal.

First off, I think Dries' blog post about the White House website
using Drupal is an absolute case study in how to perfectly word a
major success.  His tone, writing style, and message are all dead on
the money. Perfectly written.

Drupal is very aggressively growing their community as an area of
focus, and as such is generating tremendous buzz which in turn feeds
their efforts. As well, their approach with the 3PD market is totally
opposite what Joomla inherited from Mambo (albeit some major changes
these past years). Combine the two and comparatively there's not a
whole lot of outreach from the Joomla project, nor aggressive
encouragement or enabling of the community for advocacy.

Lastly, having a well-funded, well-connected business like Acquia is
high risk, high reward for Drupal, as they can focus all of their
efforts through one organization, making it easier to target events
and get the most out of their available resources. Joomla's commercial
developer community is distributed over many small, non-funded
businesses that simply don't have the media or executive clout; and
lack incentive to band together to be one larger resource to the
project (and community).

In Joomla's defense, the project is a clear market leader and probably
does not see all that outreach work as priority; and it's clear from
the outside perspective that they are actively looking for more
volunteers to help with the project itself, and need those resources
for other things than outreach and PR. Different problems, I'd say.

* Drupal - focus is gaining market share, has tons of developers
* Joomla - owns the market, focus is looking for more developers
(needs reorganization)

That also means Joomla will not be a "hot topic" while it is in a
somewhat low-key phase, working on all these relatively internal
issues.

One totally random point that is key: Drupal comes out of the box with
loads of social features, and Joomla has NONE by default. With
everyone scrambling to be the next big social media hype magnet, first
impressions will always lead them to the platform that has all the hip
and trendy features out of the box, and that ain't Joomla.

That said, my personal take is that Joomla needs to provide some of
these features at a bare minimum, and I do believe some of them are
targeted for 1.6 at least. Chances are, as the base Joomla
distribution closes that social feature gap with Drupal, this
perception will change.

Have you tried yootools for a popup window?  I think it's their YooEffects plugin.

Mitch is dead on by saying its not as simple as J vs D.

Seems like this was the culmination of years of work by Drupal people in DC,
targeting and learning how to get government contracts. O'Reilly has a blog
post on how big these guys are thinking and how professionally they're doing
business:
http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/10/whitehouse-switch-drupal-opensource.html

" ... don't underestimate the difficulty of doing business in Washington.
Procurement is done through a complex ballet understood by few open source
companies ... a big IT deployment like this requires coordination between
many companies, each providing a piece of the puzzle. According to
techpresident.com, no fewer than five firms were involved in the switch:
prime contractor General Dynamics Information Systems, Drupal specialists
Phase 2 and Acquia, hosting provider Terremark, and CDN-supplier Akamai."

FWIW, he agrees with Mitch's point about the social features:

"Drupal has a huge library of user-contributed modules that will provide
functionality the White House can use to expand its social media
capabilities, with everything from super-scalable live chats to
multi-lingual support."

Drupal folk did http://recovery.gov and http://www.nysenate.gov plus
http://commerce.gov apparently is coming next:
http://www.lullabot.com/articles/bringing-drupal-us-government

The flip side is that Drupal has no commercial market to speak of - all the
money is in custom work.

Hey Kelli,
 
The best thing to do when you use JCE Editor is to disable it and choose ?No Editor?. Then go to your article and paste your Javascript then Save.It should work.
The key is to not save that page again with JCE Editor on cause you would lose the Javascript again.

Have you tried yootools for a popup window?  I think it's their YooEffects plugin.

Hi all, does anyone use JCE Editor with Joomla. I?ve been using it for a while but I would like to insert some javascript to make a popup window and I have javascript enabled in the component but when I go into my article the javascript is still being stripped out. 

If you don?t use JCE do you have another option for popup windows with Joomla.

Thanks, Kelli

That's the money-quote, as that is exactly where Joomla has been
headed dating back to the determination that extensions were
derivatives, and therefore subject to the GPL. That was a game-changer
for the community, for sure.

Not a complaint - no need to rehash old arguments - but this is what
the landscape looks like when there are no products, only services.

Each direction has their own benefits and disadvantages. I always
thought the commercial aspect produced good ol' fashioned competition
(and therefore choice for the consumer); however a lack of cooperation
makes it difficult for folks to find what they need, and distributes
resources doing duplicate effort for the most part. Drupal folks don't
have many competing efforts, so your path is relatively clear - and
all resources for a given topic are working cooperatively towards a
common goal.

Want to expand the Joomla-verse? Tired of having sand kicked on you by smaller CMS folks? Here are my prescriptions:

"Volume wins." People very very often go with the leader. And that means the volume leader. Plus, the leader in the market automatically creates the largest ecosystem and attracts the most developers, consultants, extensions, etc. So for Joomla, that means telling (and *showing*) people we're the leader.

Joomla.org should feature the number of downloads per month top and center--updated every month. And include a drill-down page that shows the historic downloads per month on a graph. 

Other important numbers that should be on the front page or very visible:
* Number of Joomla consultants
* Number of Joomla days in the last 12 months and a link to a calendar of upcoming events.
* Number of Joomla books (also, see photo idea below). Plus reviews of the books on the site.
* Number of extensions
* Number of live sites obtained by Googling for the Joomla meta tag. Of course, the actual number will be even higher since the figure won't include intranet sites. Use an asterisk to explain this tidbit. Use a ticker to save real estate.

Move the Joomla community, security and Joomla Developers sections of the front page to an interior page. The front page should be focused:
* Tell people what Joomla is, that it is the leader, that they can use it by themselves or there are consultants who will help them.  People need to know that Joomla is the best answer for creating a web site that a, b or c. (I'll leave it to you all to best define a, b and c.)

Currently, the "one-liner" about Joomla (which should be on the front page but isn't) is "Joomla makes creating and maintaining Web sites easy for everyone, from total beginners setting up their first site to IT professionals managing enterprise installations."  That's good, but could use additional work. Has it been tested with mainstream people? Perhaps divide the section in two, one for "Web site beginners," another for "IT Pros" and list the Joomla benefits to each under the heading. Look at other sites to see how they simply, yet powerfully tell people why their product should be used. Eg http://basecamphq.com/  -- notice the photos and videos!

* A VERY important issue for any tech product is to "Cross the Chasm" (see the book by Geoffrey Moore). This is the issue that most people ("mainstream" people) do not trust visionaries' recommendations. Mainstream people want to get their jobs done and they trust recommendations from other mainstream people. What this means for Joomla: I believe that Joomla has successfully crossed the chasm. This is a very powerful feature of Joomla. Exploit it by featuring stories on the Joomla site about ordinary web sites that are using Joomla successfully. Even a 5 line story would be very good. The Joomla consultants should be able to feed stories about their successful Joomla deployments to the Joomla.org site. 

As I mention above, I suggest moving the Open Source developers / OS community stuff off of the Joomla front page. Maybe way-off the front page to a sub-site such as community.joomla.org. Why? Once you've crossed the chasm, the HUGE market of the mainstream lies in front of you. And most of that market does NOT want to be part of the Joomla Open Source community. Instead, they want to be part of the Joomla Happy Users Community who Solved Their Problems by Using Joomla. Focus on the latter and the former will also continue to grow. Focus on the OS community, and you'll slow the growth of the general users community. Why? Because most people have much more interest in attending a Joomla day vs doing the OS community work of planning it, running it, etc. To me, that's ok. And to not recognize that the mainstream is quite different than the open source / early adopter / visionary market would mean that Joomla would not grow as fast as it can and should.
 (Read Moore's book for details on the above. Highly recommended for any technologist who cares about the number of people using his or her product / project etc.)

Mainstream people want references from their own industry. This means that the pages on the Joomla site that list Joomla sites should be divided by industry. A mainstream person in the building industry wants to know that other builders (of any sort) are using Joomla. I couldn't convince a religious org that it should use Joomla because I couldn't quickly find a ref site (of a religious org) for them to look at.

Marketing takes time. No immediate miracles. But it does need to be a focus.

A couple of last ideas for this msg:
* The large number of Joomla books is a major deal. I suggest piling ALL of the Joomla books on top of each other, with their spines visible. Put the Joomla 1.0 books at the bottom. Then put that photo on the Joomla front page too. -- I note that currently there are no photos on the Joomla.org page other than two tiny photos of Ron S and a photo of a Joomla backpack. -- ** not good ** (They should all be removed.)

Instead, there should be photos of the Joomla books, and photos and videos (short!) of Joomla days, with their captions: Joomla Day in New York City, in xyz, etc. Also videos of happy mainstream Joomla users, etc. Use carousel widgets to display multiple photos. Use news tickers to make things more dynamic. Eg news ticker of sites using Joomla.

Hope this is of help.... 

Please forward it to the Joomla insiders who may not be on this list.

Go Joomla!

If someone has $$ to spend on building a web-site they can interact with 
and maintain, what is important to them? How many people buy a computer 
with MS on it because of market share, and how many because it runs 
whatever software they're trying to get going?

Is the framework/CMS/Language becoming a commodity in the search for 
problem solving? What problems need solving and how does Joomla do that?

Just a personal vent, I hate the new policy of the extensions directory.

I wrote a short little plugin and decided since the number of lines of code
were soooo small, the proper license for it was "Public Domain".  I had to
"wrap" my public domain plugin in a GPL license to publish it there.

While I understand the desire to remove the commercial and other Open Source
licenses from the directory, the pure GPL policy is annoying.

Amen, brother! That's one of the things I said when I heard about the
new direction the JED was taking. FIRST, excluding GPL-incompatible
extensions simply prods the community to come up with their own JED
that is useful to everyone, not just a select group; and SECOND, by
requiring GPL-only, the project shut their eyes and plugged their ears
to many, many other FOSS licenses that are totally compatible with the
GPL.

I just got a chance to read this thread and I really appreciate this
measured discussion of the Drupal and Joomla development models with respect
to their workability for Whitehouse website(s).

At the risk of this being a drive-by troll, however (since there really were
a number of excellent points made) at some point one really has to
acknowledge that the Drupal development model is just a better fit for the
way people would like to see the government operate, namely that is a highly
co-operative structure with clearly delineated areas of responsibility in a
way that Joomla may not disagree with,but has not really effectively
implemented. There are quite a number of lower level synergies as well (not
to mention the gross disparity in enterprise penetration between the two
systems) and without reducing the decision process to a J vs. D polemic,
there really are a greater set of affinities on the one side, much more so
than the other.

Of course one also has to recognize the myriad connections in Drupal's
development history with political organisations, (e.g. Dean's campaign,
which was really the precursor to Obama's "Internet victory.") Drupal in
general just has a much greater involvement in that space. Also (and I
realise I run the risk of being snarky here) it wouldn't surprise me if a
look at the numbers revealed Joomla was being used in more instances for
Republican candidate/official's websites; this is based on actually seeing
Joomla used more on that side of the political spectrum. (With the notable
exception being a certain unnamed Fox news site.) Not trying to incite a
polemical debate here, I'm just sayin?

But perhaps the more interesting consideration is framework
interoperability, specfically the services (and objects) that each can
expose or make use of, and of course a shared semantic framework. So we are
not talking about 'which' CMF but how they can be used together. The Drupal
roadmap definitely includes GGG; I do not know where Joomla is with this,
perhaps someone who does can speak to it.

I dug around and asked a few people, and the feedback I got on the
WhiteHouse.gov site moving to Drupal was simply based on Obama's
election campaign being run on Drupal, which was actually chosen by
the firm that Obama's campaign chose to hire for building the site.

This looks to have been initially a developer decision, which turned
into a lasting relationship for folks that learned how to use Drupal.

IMHO this is still a very compelling story for Drupal, and I'm not
trying to detract from it. Just trying to uncover how the decision
process was made in order to understand the selection process; and
basically learned it was due to familiarity of the developer hired to
do the work.

Pretty cool, and a recurring theme with open source and government uptake.

And for the record, Forest, McCainSpace was KickApps powered. :^P

Can I call you on my drive home around 4 30 to 5pm? If so what is the best number to reach you.

I dug around and asked a few people, and the feedback I got on the
WhiteHouse.gov site moving to Drupal was simply based on Obama's
election campaign being run on Drupal, which was actually chosen by
the firm that Obama's campaign chose to hire for building the site.

This looks to have been initially a developer decision, which turned
into a lasting relationship for folks that learned how to use Drupal.

IMHO this is still a very compelling story for Drupal, and I'm not
trying to detract from it. Just trying to uncover how the decision
process was made in order to understand the selection process; and
basically learned it was due to familiarity of the developer hired to
do the work.

Pretty cool, and a recurring theme with open source and government uptake.

And for the record, Forest, McCainSpace was KickApps powered. :^P

Hi folks,

Reporting from inside the Beltway, I personally know the CEO of  
Phase2. The connections between the Democratic party and Drupal date  
back to the Dean campaign, and as a business owner in this sector,  
I've seen the Drupal companies thoroughly dominate in this arena.

At the same time, Joomla is still the only open source CMS approved to  
be used in US Congress (we at PICnet made that happen 3+ years ago)  
and it's heavily entrenched in NGOs here.

I think Larry and Mitch have it right: we simply need to do a better  
job sharing professionally crafted success stories. This is a big  
topic that I speak about a lot at Joomla Days and on the OSM Board,  
and I'm excited to gather best practices from others an move forward  
in the right direction.

Best,
Ryan

So, given the current discussion about the organization methods of 
Joomla and Drupal, does this give a big edge to Drupal?

My personal choice is Joomla because I have a book on it, I've worked 
with it a little, and I know at least one former core-developer. From a 
technocratic perspective, I have no idea which is better or why, except 
what I read here. Even then you guys are sometimes over my head.

I would like Joomla.org to showcase sites that have been created by joomla!

In addition we should 'recognize' the VP's and Presidents of the large organizations that have chosen to go the Joomla! route...

Ryan, is there a good way to do this???

Joomla! has made it to so many different areas...let's shout it out!!!

Yes, that was pretty much my point:  McCain/Joomla versus Obama/Drupal.

I guess the country has spoken!   :-p

Forest -- 

Huh?  KickApps is not Joomla.

Well, maybe we should get *Oprah* to use Joomla and then we'll take over the country.

Yes, that was pretty much my point:  McCain/Joomla versus Obama/Drupal. 

I guess the country has spoken!   :-p

Message-ID: <53efb6970910281822s508940a0v5404c77083fa523b@mail.gmail.com>

Over the last few days there has been lots of interesting discussion about
Joomla in a bigger context.

Joomlashack is about to launch its 3rd annual Joomla  Survey. We have had
over 9,000 respondents over these 3 years, and hope get alot more people
completing it this year.

I thought I would ask the list (based on recent discussion) if there are any
useful question the group thinks we could include. Its an opportunity to get
several thousand Joomla users weigh in on something.

Ideas?

I don't know of an scientific survey, but yeah as amusing as it was last
year to see Republican candidates using Joomla to try to keep up with an
increasing reliance on Drupal by their Democratic opponents, it's was even
more so to see Fox launch their Drupal based social media site this year?
just as the Obama team was planning all their web site do-overs in Drupal.

Yes, for about 2 weeks until she publicly announces she's already bored with
it.
And with over 2 million page views a day, I feel bad for the guy who is
charged with getting Joomla to scale that far out.  :-O

For me, Joomla is the entrenched heavyweight, and Drupal the brash
young upstart with a swagger.

Both have large enough communities behind them that you are in good
hands - and the best part about this is that you should be just fine
whichever you choose.

There's a Military-Open Source Software group I'm learning about. They

One thing I do prefer in drupal is that they choose the jquery model.  While
I prefer to program in mootools when given a choice, mootools is not a good
choice for a CMS where you expect to have many people developing
applications that work in conjunction with your own.  It simply increases
the chance of, from the users perspective, random pages not working properly
because of javascript function name clashes.  Jquery is the appropriate
choice when you not might have, but actively encourage the combined of
multiple application into one.

On the flipside...neither drupal or joomla ensure good code.  My experiences
with troubleshooting drupal sites have been all negative - but not because
of drupal.  Because the person who implemented Drupal, rather than using the
content management system to...oh...manage content instead goes through and
hacks the core code to display little snippets of html on certain pages.  So
then when someone wants those snippets changed, I have to go through and
figure out what he did. :-)

Interestingly, I have found a no political leaning on the Congress
websites.  Each representative has their own web page, and I don't know if
their using a shared server or VPS, but they have a broad mix of different
applications.  Some ASP based content management systems, a lot of Wordpress
sites, and a few Joomla ones.  I don't recall seeing Drupal on any.  One of
these days I'd like to figure out some way to automatically scan all 538(9?
does DC's non voting rep have a page?) website pages and add up the CMS's in
use.

I don't recall discussions from last year re political websites, but the Republican presidential candidate's website was McCainSpace.com which was built by and run on KickApps, which is not Joomla.  So until I see some numbers I don't see how this speaks to anything other than  propaganda.

Didn't we already beat this horse to death last year during the actual election?

I don't know of an scientific survey, but yeah as amusing as it was last year to see Republican candidates using Joomla to try to keep up with an increasing reliance on Drupal by their Democratic opponents, it's was even more so to see Fox launch their Drupal based social media site this year? just as the Obama team was planning all their web site do-overs in Drupal.

And with over 2 million page views a day, I feel bad for the guy who is charged with getting Joomla to scale that far out.  :-O

I'm actually ok with the excluding of GPL incompatible licenses.  I might
not like it, but it seems to me that if the bulk of the current team feels
that way, it seems good to me.

I just don't like excluding GPL compatible licenses.  There is no reason,
other than a desire to force others to use GPL, to reject a public domain
license.  There can be no arguement about wanting to give people choices and
freedom and at the same time reject a public domain license.

Do you have a way to easily generate the list of URLs as input? Because just
off the top of my head you could take the javascript from the 'which cms'
firefox plugin, wrap it in a crunchy php shell and curl your input list
through that to concatenate your total into a global. Put a pipe in between
with a script to filter the asp url's and I think you're done. Not to be too
hand wavvy, but it  would be pretty easy to get some rough numbers.

whichcms?  hmm...I'll have to look at that.

I expect there is a directory somewhere I can get the urls from, it was
building a database to detect cms's that seemed non trivial to me.  I'll
take a look.

Here is the one I found:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10229

Have too many tabs open to restart my browser and see how it works at the
moment.  Wrestling with some sata drives that suddenly stopped working.

Here is the list of the official Representatives' sites (members of Congress)
http://www.house.gov/house/MemberWWW.shtml

Here are the Senators' sites
http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

Note that each House member and Senator also has an unofficial site run by their campaigns.
The above lists are the official sites paid for with your tax dollars.

Any statistics on the CMS systems used should include a cross-tab by the chamber (House or Senate) and party (D, R or I) to help spot clustering-- eg using a technology because a favorite vendor uses it.

I look forward to seeing the results!

Larry

The brazilian government has chosen to use Joomla in the Ministry of
Education webportal. It was launched in March 2009.

   - http://portal.mec.gov.br/

The ministry demanded a solution where there could be greater interactivity
between the ministry and visitors. Several components were developed for the
site. The owners of NOIX, the agency that was responsible for this project,
were present at Joomla Day Brasil in september. I had the impression things
happened this way because they knew Joomla and knew people in the
Government. These are the links to a post in NOIX about the new portal and
on to their presentation. Even if you don't speak portuguese, I believe
you'll get the bigger picture.

   -
   http://www.noix.com.br/noticias/portal-mec-no-peixe-grande-2009-chegou-a-hora-de-escolher-o-melhor-site-educacional-do-brasil
   -
   http://www.slideshare.net/joomladaybrasil/joomladay-brasil-2008-mec-presentation

Regarding governments, I don't think the best choice was THE choice. I don't
think Joomla missed out this time. Simply put, It was not there to be
evaluated, because Drupal was. If it's there already, why change?

Oh by the way, if you want to see more sites made with Joomla, try the
Showcase within the Joomla Community website:

   - http://community.joomla.org/showcase/

1. Where do you see Joomla utilized?
	Personal sites
	SOHO sites
	Not for profits
	Private Organization or Groups
	Governmental bodies (Local, State, National)
	...

2. What have you heard the client say the biggest confusion is for their 
web site?

3. What do *you* think is the clients biggest struggle?

4. How many hours do you take to build a small Joomla site?

5. Using the hours from #4 above, how do you divide up the time?
	a. Client communications
	b. Research into Joomla configuration
	c. Search and research for Joomla Add-ons
	d. Initial site configuration
	e. Initial content generation
	f. Training client in site support
	g. Fixing client issues

6. How many production Joomla sites have you installed?

7. Referring to #6 above, what percentage were on:
	a. Windows hosts
	b. Linux hosts
	c. Mac hosts
	d. BSD hosts
	e. Other hosts

8. When you discuss a CMS with a client, what options do you offer?

9. What percentages of your clients display an informed opinion on the 
value of one CMS over another?

10. On a scale of 0 (not at all) and 9 (totally grok it), how "clueful" 
are your clients on:
	a. Amount of effort to build a medium site
	b. Understanding of the different Web roles (designer, developer, 
database programmer, etc)
	c. Hourly rates for skilled web work
	d. Managing the web project

11. Reference #10, choice "d". What percentage of your clients:
	a. Want you do do their specific task list
	b. Give you a set of objectives and some loose parameters
	c. Work with you as a 50/50 equal partner
	d. Look to you for major input decisions
	e. Give you the login and a "due by" date


Barrie, hope that helps.

Leam
