Subject: [joomla] Poll roundup
Message-ID: <4729F47A.6010909@beezifies.com>

Still working on forums for the site, so until then here is a good place 
as any for commentary.

I'm wondering what people use for polls, what they like and what they 
don't like.

I tried the default Poll component for Joomla and quite frankly, it was 
too basic.

I've been using PollXT and its flexible and easy to use.  But I'm 
interested in what components others are using as well.

I see someone did some integration work with Limesurvey and Joomla 
recently, so that's an option too.

ExitPoll is AWESOME!  Once you figure it out (not that
bad) it's the last poll/quiz/whatever component you
will look at.. I tried PollXT, liked it, then tried
ExitPoll, and uninstalled PollXt...

Subject: [joomla] IE6 & Vista --> was Paypal Developer Day
Message-ID: <380939.34113.qm@web35607.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

So I signed up for Paypal Developer Day for this Thursday and when they called to confirm they said I need to bring my laptop.  

What laptop?!  I've been thinking about finally buying a laptop, and was looking at one with XP at Toshiba.com, but I don't have time to order it and all the ones in the stores are Vista.

Has anyone set up IE6 to run on Vista using VPC?  I need to be able to test in IE6.

Or has anyone bought a Vista laptop and downgraded to XP?  

I didn't want to have to buy all new software, but my Photoshop 7 is so out of date, I may as well.

Is 2GB enough to run Photoshop, Dreamwever, Fireworks, text editor and several browser windows at the same time?  Someone said Vista uses 1GB just for the OS.

I just received an email announcement that Paypal will be holding 2 
developer day presentations(9AM to 5PM) in New York.

One in Brooklyn on November 8th, and one in Manhattan on November 9th.

It's a free all day presentation, plus you can take their 
"certification" exam for free at the event(whatever that means).

I don't have a direct link to the event(or rather, my direct link 
emailed to me is tied to my Paypal account)  so if your interested you 
will need to sign up for their developer network and than look for the 
announcement on their site.

And remember that Leopard comes with BootCamp included, so you can
boot into XP or Vista as well. If you grab a copy of Fusion you can
even run IE in a separate window, like a native mac app.

I have been considering a Mac for the first time because I really don't want to go with Vista, but I'm concerned about the learning curve.  I've been using Windows since v3.1 (1993).  Can an old dog learn Mac without losing productivity?

Does MacBook need 2GB to run Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, et al. concurrently?

My wife sums it up thusly:

"Honey, when you used Windows you spent all day swearing at the
computer. Then you went back to Linux/UNIX and spent the day swearing
at yourself. Now you sit on your MacBook and listen to your
headphones."

God, I love that woman.

The one I linked to comes with 2GB installed. :-)

If I had a large budget to blow on a new system, it would be a macbook.

With the new systems, you can boot XP, you can boot Vista, you can boot 
Mac, and you can boot Linux.

So you don't need to learn any new tricks, you can start off with dual 
boot into XP and try out the Mac as you have time.

The biggest benefit I see is with a Mac, you have the ability to test 
browsers from all 3 operating systems(Windows, Mac, and Linux) on one 
platform.

That said, I didn't have the budget for a Macbook, so I went with a 
refurb Dell and have been cursing Vista every since.

I can confirm the cursing... LOL... 

I personally don't care for Macs (It's the lack of
hardware interoperability that I don't like...
Windows/*nix you can buy almost any piece of hardware
and make it work.  Mac, you need to buy the hardware
from them.  I'm not talking about hard drives here,
I'm talking video capture, audio capture, gaming
devices, mp3 players (others besides IPODs do exist),
etc...).  

I'd get a nice cheap laptop, ditch VISTA for XP, and
then install Linux as a dual boot.  (stay away from
Ubuntu until they can get the laptop hard drive fix in
place).  XP shouldn't be hard to load since most
manufactures (decent ones anyway) have the drivers
available right on their website.

I went to CompUSA on my lunch hour and was ready to buy a MacBook (not Pro) with extra RAM, but they were out of stock.

But I did get some important info from the salesperson -- to boot up with Windows, or emulate Windows, you need to buy a Windows license, which is another $150.  They also had something else for $99 that they said I would need to use all the features of something or other on the Mac.

Mac is so out of my $$ league!  This is a Mercedes and I can only afford a Metrocard.  :-(

You now have the visual capacity of Wondows and the computational power
of Unix. Yeah, sticker shock is tough, but you'll learn to love the Mac.
I'm a Linux person, my wife is on her second Mac, and neither of us miss
Windows, except for watching some DVDs that don't get recorded properly.

Look around, there are probably windows licenses you can use from old
computers, right? Take the Vista license from your old Dell and install
it on your Mac.

Don't forget, if you have a business you can write the Mac off as an
expense. ;)

That's probably the easiest route for you to take. I'm an old UNIX
curmudgeon so I compiled everything from source - and there's also
MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/) if you want a bsd-like experience.

> I also can't find Firefox which I d/l'd and installed last night.  Hmmm.

Hmm, click on your hard drive icon and take a look on the left sidebar
- that's the finder, and the sidebar should have an entry for
Applications. Click once on that and you are looking at all the
applications installed there, and Firefox should be among them.

If not, then you either put Firefox somewhere else, or the install
didn't happen. Write back here, I'm happy to help if you run into more
issues.

Don't forget to take the free mac classes at the apple store, Soho has a good offering.
  I agree, that Macs are superior machines, but rehabituating to the interface can add some lagtime to your workflow. Especially in coding and locating where the heck you downloaded your files to. The end key.. I have no idea what function it serves on a mac b/c it doens't take me to the end of a line of code like in Windows, but you can use the apple key + left or right arrow and up and down arrow to get the the beginning and end of a line of code and to the top and bottom of a page, respectively.
   
  XAMPP also works on mac.

I bought the lowest priced MacBook on the way home tonight, but haven't opened it yet. I feel guilty for spending the money -- I could have bought 2 Windows laptops for the price!

You now have the visual capacity of Wondows and the computational power
of Unix. Yeah, sticker shock is tough, but you'll learn to love the Mac.
I'm a Linux person, my wife is on her second Mac, and neither of us miss
Windows, except for watching some DVDs that don't get recorded properly.

Look around, there are probably windows licenses you can use from old
computers, right? Take the Vista license from your old Dell and install
it on your Mac.

Don't forget, if you have a business you can write the Mac off as an
expense. ;)

I'm downloading MAMP. I assume that's where I start?

I also can't find Firefox which I d/l'd and installed last night. Hmmm.

http://www.versiontracker.com
http://www.macupdate.com

BTW, anyone else see Quicksilver now open sourced, good stuff ...

Subject: [joomla] Tomoro's meeting
Message-ID: <4731C95B.7000306@beezifies.com>

I've sent out an email to all addresses I had who confirmed this months 
attendance, as well as people who RSVP'd last month but not this month.

I have kept everyone on the RSVP list for security purposes, so if 
anyone came or tried to come last month they won't be turned away at the 
lobby.

If you have NOT received an email from me and intend on coming, make 
sure to RSVP by either sending me email or(preferred) RSVPing through 
the website, http://www.joomlanyc.org

Message-ID: <4731F9F3.2030309@beezifies.com>

Ok everyone, as I mentioned in the confirmation emails, the NYC JUG 
library is now setup.

I'm using Joomlib for now, in case anyone is interested.

Please take a look at the books in the library and rate and review any 
ones you have already read.  You can also use the lend request button to 
request to borrow the book for a month, picking it up tomorro at the 
meeting.

Reviewing is a bit odd, it's got a little javascript thingy which 
displays the review options when you hover the mouse over the review text.

attendance, as well as people who RSVP'd last month but not this month.

I have kept everyone on the RSVP list for security purposes, so if 
anyone came or tried to come last month they won't be turned away at the 
lobby.

If you have NOT received an email from me and intend on coming, make 
sure to RSVP by either sending me email or(preferred) RSVPing through 
the website, http://www.joomlanyc.org

Subject: [joomla] Book reviews up,
	could I have been more disorganized and confusing?
Message-ID: <47333B20.5010701@beezifies.com>

I started out with Sobi for book reviews, than added Joomlib for the 
library and used it's book review function.

So what did I do?  I left the menu link for SoBi up labeled as "reviews".

Could I have been less organized?

Noooo.

In any case, the reviews are combined with the library, and I've removed 
the review menu link.

I've gone through and added my thoughts to just about all the books. 
Note: I tend to be pretty brutal on books.  I think if your paying 50$ 
or thereabouts on a book, I'm expecting a textbook, not what you get 
these days from most companies.

That doesn't make the books useless, just most times they are useless 
/to me/(The general about Joomla books are no longer applicable for me) 
or not worth the money /to me/(I'd say most books are at least 10, if 
not 20$ more than I think they are worth).

So please, feel free to add your own reviews and contradict me, give 
people multiple points of views.  Or validate my feelings.

The direct link to the library is currently: 
http://www.joomlanyc.org/index.php?option=com_joomlib&Itemid=16

You can also use it to request to borrow a the book at the meeting and 
return it at the next meeting(or media mail it back).

Man... For a temporary site, this is really looking
good... hehehe.  I knew there was a reason I made you
an admin... hehehe...

Hopefully this library takes off, and we can expand
the idea out to other groups...

ArtioSEF was easy and quick to setup, and to customize components for, 
but does have a bit of a sleazy rep(basically, they took a GPL SEF 
product, heavily enhanced it, and now sell it as non-GPL.  You can 
install a free copy, but it inserts hidden ads in your web pages meta 
information.)

Due to the above, I'm looking into sh404sef to see how well it works but 
haven't gotten around to it due to lack of time.

Um, yeah that's beyond sleazy. If true, I don't see how anyone could 
conscience supporting that project.

I think most Joomla developers take GPL very seriously. Even if you 
don't release under the GPL, you still respect it, otherwise they're 
just code thieves!

it says:

http://www.site.com/content/view/1/2/ or

ok, but what determines which of the 2 ways the URL will be shown?
bc the 2nd way seems to be preferable, but it seems like the 1st is 
actually the defulat behaviour?

Yup.  I used it for a while, then looked out on the forums about the 
complaints about the hidden ads, which I figured was their right since 
they wrote it.  But then people kept commenting about how it was an 
upgraded version of some other dead SEF product.

Even with that, I'm fairly fine with them selling it, as a GPL product 
with attribution to the prior code.

It seems that periodically after they release a version, someone goes 
and strips out the ads from the obfuscated code and releases a non-ad 
version.  That someone then mentions getting a nasty gram from them 
about the software being copyrighted.

Heck, I'm not a big fan of how the GPL is interpretted by many, but this 
is such a clear violation of the GPL - no matter how much you "enhance" 
a program, if it's GPL to begin with, it's GPL when your done enhancing it.

Like I said...I'm looking into sh404sef now. :-)

Hey, I was just wondering, is there a way to setup Joomla for a Postgres 
backend database?

I've got a shared host that gives me access to both MySQL and Postgres 
and thought it would be fun to play around with a Postgres and a MySQL 
version side by side.

IIRC 1.5 is supposed to support it with a bit of tweaking, right?

Honestly, I like OpenSEF.  It's simple, easy and
POWERFUL.  I've never had a problem.  NuSEF promises
to pick up where it left off (hasn't been supported in
almost a year)...

Good Luck... That's all I will say... there is a lot
of non-standard SQL going on, so you would need to
hunt down every query and test it for functionality
(and proper result) before declaring it functional...

Joomla makes use of some non-standard mysql sql extensions and certain 
elements like paging, for example might be a problem. The joomla 1.5 
development group has not made any efforts to make it portable.

Well, portable is a fine line.  You can do everything
that Joomla does without using MySQL special
functions.  The problem with doing that is
performance.  MySQL has some special extensions that
can speed up queries significantly from just
"standard" SQL.  So to make it portable (in the true
sense) does have repercussions....

Subject: [joomla] Template install issues
Message-ID: <e294c85216c4a.47366eae@optonline.net>

I'm having a hard time installing any templates that I have downloaded so far. I'm thinking it is a permission problem. I'm using a laptop with Ubuntu and accessing joomla in a subdirectory of the web root directory.It appears that all directories are owned by root:root under the web root directory. Inside the joomla directory, all ownership is 1010:1010.I can't find that in my /etc/group file. So, I think that I should chown root:root -r * in th /var/www/apache2/joomla directory.Any opinions about this?**********************As an aside, I feel like I've been given a pod to take home (Invasion of the Body Snatchers). Installation and research has kept me up until 5 am this morning.Mark

Look for the httpd.conf or apache.conf file

/var/www/apache2/joomla seems like an odd directory structure to me, are 
you sure it's not /var/apache2/www/joomla?

In any case, that aside, according to this site:
http://www.control-escape.com/web/configuring-apache2-debian.html

The most likely place for your apache config file is:
/etc/apache2/

And the most likely name is apache2.conf

So, find that config file and read it in whateever your favorite manner 
is(more, less, cat, print, vi, vim, kedit, whatever)

Look for 2 lines in the file:
User unix-userid
and
Group unix-groupid

Generally, I've found them to be:
User apache
Group apache

But it could be different in your case.

That is the userid and group that apache is running as, so if your going 
to chown files(and chgrp for that manner) change them to whatever the 
user and group directives are set to.

It may be that /var/www is the web servers document root and
/var/www/apache2-default is a directory that contains a basic apache welcome
page. I believe that the default user and group for apache2 in Ubuntu is
www-data. So you may want to try: chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www

You may also want to check the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file
because in a default install it will redirect everything to that
apache2-default (welcome page) folder. You would just need to comment out
the RedirectMatch (around line 16), then you can install Joomla either
directly into the /var/www directory or create a /var/www/joomla directory
for it (don't forget to set ownership permissions)

Let us know if that works.

Thank you,
Ben

Message-ID: <149432.60983.qm@web35603.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

If a site is being developed today in 1.0.13 (or .12), at what point do you think it becomes unusable or unsuppoted?

Do you think most 3rd party developers are dropping support of 1.0.x asap?

Well, at the moment the biggest push I see for 1.5 compatible apps is 
from users, not developers.

Most devs I see, with a few exceptions(RocketWerx) are sticking with 1.0

The problem is an app designed for 1.0 works under 1.5, and app designed 
for 1.5 doesn't work on 1.0

I think one thing that would speed development of 1.5 apps would be a 
library for 1.5 functions that could be used in 1.0

As an example, if you go fullbore on making an MVC app the "joomla" way 
there are a bunch of functions for loading the different bits of code.

But if you use all those functions, there is no way for that app to work 
in 1.0


Personally, if I had a preference in developing, I'd develop for Joomla 
1.5 with PHP 5.2 and MySQL v5

Man, talk about limiting your market to almost non-existant. :-)


(1.5 has a lot of silly little features that just make life better.  For 
example, they define a variable for the path to the administration side 
of the code - so in theory if all the apps that today hardcoded that 
path in their code switched to the variable, your then free to "hide" 
your admin folder by renaming it.  Security through obscurity is no 
answer for making an app secure to begin with.  On the other hand, 
sticking a super lock on a glass door isn't really making the entrance 
"secure" either)

For WYSIWYG there's FCK editor, which is pretty lean and mean. As for
text editors (development/IDE) on the Mac I love Smultron.

What do you use for a color picker?  I was using Iconico's color picker and the color picker extension on Firefox, neither of which are available on Mac.

I miss my Joomla toolbar for Firefox.  :-(

I'm not so much concerned about making all the components work, a 
functional postgres.php library to use in place of mysql.php and 
mysqli.php and and a working content component.

I'm just not at all familiar with postgres and am not sure if it's 
possible to translate mysql.php for postgres (from a brief glance, the 
last_insert_id function can be emulated with later versions of postgres 
with a slightly different function.  Not sure if there are any other 
gotcha's in there)

I would rather advocate PDO support instead. I know that we've had
Joomla running on PostgreSQL before, as well as M$ SQL Server. So it
definitely is possible, however it would be easiest to maintain going
forward if PDO was used (as opposed to a native extension for each
backend).

I started a PDO project and simply ran out of steam while coaching
youth soccer, taking on a new project, and now moving ;-)

external?  As far as I know, the only ways to deal
with that, are target=_parent and javascript, but both
require the code to be within the IFrame...  About the
links issues, do you have an example?

Anthony,

 

Thanks for your help with the wrapper concept, it
worked great, now I am using it on multiple websites.

 

Now here is a question for you...

 

Since the wrapper is a menu item, I am running into a
problem if my user wants to list on the main body
(content item) the list of the menu items that are
wrappers, then click on the links and display it
properly.

 

I tried it by:

1. Add the item as a wrapper/ menu item

2. Go to that item and copy the link

3. Go to content and put that link in the content

 

The problem is that when you click on the link the
'wrapper' does not appear in my joomla page it appears
with just the content and nothing else.  Is there a
way to do this?

 

For example I have a library website, and they have
many 'external' online links, I am creating menu item
wrappers for these links.  But I think if the user
clicks on 'online resources' in the middle of the page
should appear a list of those wrappers, the user can
click on them and go to the right places.

here is the site that I am working on:

http://www.springfieldpubliclibrary.com/joomla

 

They have a page on their current site, which is
'ugly', but I want to simulate it in joomla:
http://www.springfieldpubliclibrary.com/database.htm
 

Thank you for your time!!!

 

thanks,

Laura

I think you may want to look into using the {mosloadposition} mambot. If I
understand you correctly you want to display a menu in a content item. One
way to do this would be to create another menu and COPY each of your wrapper
menu items to the new menu. Then set the menus module to display in an
unused module position (lets say user7). The go into the content item where
you want to add the list of wrapper items and add a {mosloadposition user7}
there.

 

When the content item is displayed (and you have enabled the mosloadposition
mambot) you should see the menu. Since it is a regular Joomla menu the menu
items should have any Itemids that may be necessary to keep things working.

 

I hope this helps.

 

Thank you,

Ben Hornedo

You may have to upgrade/update later anyway as this is still a release
candidate so there is the possibility of code changes in the future
releases, but I think there is currently no upgrade path from Joomla 1.0.x
to Joomla 1.5, so maybe you should go ahead and build on 1.5 now, as it is
more likely that there will be an upgrade from this J1.5 RC to the next
before we see one for J 1.0.x to J1.5.

 

Does anyone know of anything different?

/var/www/apache2/joomla seems like an odd directory structure to me, are 
you sure it's not /var/apache2/www/joomla?

I put it into a subdirectory under /var/www. /var/www/apache-2 is another
(useless and baffling) directory that is just there.



And the most likely name is apache2.conf

Yes, but an empty httpd.conf file is also there.


Generally, I've found them to be:
User apache
Group apache

In Ubuntu 7.10 it is www-data


But it could be different in your case.

That is the userid and group that apache is running as, so if your going 
to chown files(and chgrp for that manner) change them to whatever the 
user and group directives are set to.

Curiously, everything now, and this is a fresh install of Ubuntu, is set as
root. I'll change it all to www-data for user and group, which do exist in
the passwd and group files.


It may be that /var/www is the web servers document root and
/var/www/apache2-default is a directory that contains a basic apache welcome
page. I believe that the default user and group for apache2 in Ubuntu is
www-data. So you may want to try: chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www

Exactly!


You may also want to check the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file
because in a default install it will redirect everything to that
apache2-default (welcome page) folder. You would just need to comment out
the RedirectMatch (around line 16), then you can install Joomla either
directly into the /var/www directory or create a /var/www/joomla directory
for it (don't forget to set ownership permissions)

I've already installed joomla as a sub of www, which is how I would prefer
it for now.

Let us know if that works.


This is set by default to /var/www

directly into the /var/www directory or create a /var/www/joomla directory
for it (don't forget to set ownership permissions)

Let us know if that works.

Yes, that is progress. Now I get:

Your Extension appears to be written for an older version of Joomla!. You
must enable the System - Legacy Plugin in the Plugin Manager if you wish to
complete this task.

Should I be trying 1.5 at this point? I though I heard it mentioned at the
meeting that upgrading of existing sites should be held off, but this is not
production yet, and I'd prefer to do not have to upgrade later.

Thanks so much to all for the help!!!!

I'm expecting the exact opposite. The team probably will not spend any
effort simplifying migration from a release candidate to final. I do
expect them to put some effort into making it as easy as possible to
migrate from 1.0 to 1.5 when 1.5 goes final.

Midtown Manhattan B2B magazine publisher seeks LAMP developer to join and
become integral member of online content team.  The ideal candidate will
contribute to the development of Joomla 1.0.x CMS components, modules,
mambots, and templates - requiring PHP  and mySQL  chops as well tight html
and css skills.  Areas of development will span ongoing maintenance and
workflow optimization projects as well as time sensitive development
relating to sponsored content and microsites.

 

At this time three of our publications have been migrated to Joomla  with
four more transitioning by end of year.  Parallel to this effort  is the
development of online content and email blast ticketing tools  for
integration with PHPList for a 100k+ user base.  These tools will  support
the circulation, editorial, and marketing departments.  We also have a long
list of exciting features to be worked on once the  nuts and bolts work is
completed.

 

Become part of this energetic team that rounds out the efforts of a company
with over thirty years in the hi-tech/engineering publishing  field. This
position reports to the (hands on) Technology Director. Competitive salary
is commensurate with experience.

 

 

 

Thank You

I was wondering if anyone objects to the posting of jobs that are 
specifically Joomla related to this mailling list?

By specifically, I mean /definitely/ Joomla work, not "familiar with a 
CMS such as Joomla, Drupal, etc".

I realize that we have a NYPHP list specifically for jobs, but my own 
feeling is that the list is low traffic enough that I'd rather get as 
much posted as possible, rather than just a little.

Hi,

At the last JUG meeting I asked Gary if it would be appropriate to  
post a job listing to the list and he said he thought it was fine  
given the small size of the list so far.  Unfortunately, a recruiter  
hit the list with the job description that I wrote before I had a  
chance.  Please, ignore the contact on the initial post and if you  
happen to know any candidates for this job please send them our  
information - here is one of our sites http://www.techbriefs.com/.  We  
have a good group here and we've been building out lots of custom  
components, modules, and mambots and are looking to expand that  
effort.  I will hopefully be demonstrating some of these at future JUG  
meetings.

Thanks.

Oliver

Well, the way I see it, we can go 3 ways...

1. No jobs at all

2. Jobs with Approval (basically, the user contacts a
list admin, and if approved gets sent)

3. Jobs without anything (all jobs submitted get
posted).

I don't know how mailman's filtering system is, to say
that it could do this automatically...

Nope. It's a manual effort, and seeing how fast I've been at getting
JoomlaCities ready we're probably better off leaving the moderation
part out of the deal *cough*

I'd go with #3, considering I wouldn't want to be in the position of 
filtering them out.

Basically, as long as it is directly Joomla related, I'd be happy to see 
them here until we can get a place dedicated to it.

If we start having problems, than we can go to no jobs.

Is this for full-time and contract corporate jobs, or also for project jobs, such as looking for paid help on a project.

This is for the members of the list to tell me what they would like.  If 
we only want projects, than I'll tell people only post projects.  If we 
only want full time stuff, than I'll mention tell people that. 

Basically, the question is, would anyone mind getting(just to ballpark 
it based on my recollection of the NYPHP list, about a dozen job 
postings a month from this list cluttering up their inboxes).

Considering the projected traffic, I think all jobs should be welcomed, 
after all if we get a slew of them and get sick of them it just 
motivates me to get the job board running.

I think it's a good idea to have job postings here, both for people looking for paid help with their projects and for people looking for work.

I think we should also have photos and mini bios of everyone in the group, but I'm sure many will not agree with that idea.  ;-)

Nope - check out RocketTheme and their GPL template (I forget the
name). It was advertised as XHTML valid and no tables for layout, and
it should be a good example.

A good friend of mine has produced some stunning templates based on
1.5, and I'm thinking of asking him to release a basic (blank)
template for the rest of us to have a good starting point - as his
work included compliance with Dutch accessibility requirements and
also has some pretty astonishing results regarding pagerank and such
as a result...

You can overcome SOME of the table use by using the additional "style"
parameter when calling mosLoadModules(). This will only change how JOOMLA
wraps the modules; the modules' output is dependent on how it was developed.
If the module developer used only tables for the module output, you will
still see the tables.

 

As far as I know.

 

 

Thank you,

Ben

Am I correct that all workable templates are structured with tables?

Is there a movement toward strict xhtml with block level css used for
placement of modules?

The current system requires a lot of pieces and blocks to put together a
good looking page. There would likely be a trade off in moving to strict
xhtml, in that there would need to be a lot of hacks and conditional
statements to achieve layouts that aren't nealy as predictable. There might
also be difficulties in keeping the presentation layer seperated from the

I see now that there is some coverage of this topic coming up at the

Subject: [joomla] Some newbie type questions
Message-ID: <e49ff1e5160da.473a17f8@optonline.net>

I'm looking to move my first website over to Joomla. I have several sites that present a similar problem to me.These sites have info that I pull from mysql tables, and present in html tables. These tables are constructed from php include files. I have html admin pages, or phpmysqladmin, that I can use to manipulate the data in the database.I'd like to be able to continue to present these tables, pulled from mysql by query. I have looked, but haven't seen anything jumping out at me that looks like it is going to do what I want, so I am assuming that I'll have to modify the current php include files so that they behave as modules.I know that one page, that has been in stalled development for a while for various reasons, will need to pull from about 15 mysql table. That's what it took to get to 3rd normal form.As you can see, I'd be helped? by any tools that are already out there that would work for this. If there isn't anything, I could use some guidance on where to look to learn how to componentize php code.Thanks,Mark Simko

Well... :)

Its relatively easy to make a template that uses CSS for layout, most
commercial template vendors do.

Next hardest is pure CSS source ordered layouts, separates the men
from the boys a bit more....

Top of the heap is fluid width source ordered....

Now, obviously with 1.0, it will put tables back in anyway :). With
1.5 you can slap in an html override on ANY template to get rid of the
Joomla tables.

Clear as mud :)

Barrie

ps
RokWebify (the RT GPL plate) uses tables for layout, doesn't even
cross the easiest hurdle :/

I see now that unless a templatge avoids using the default, 0, or 1 as
the style parameter, that the components will be organized into tables.
It would be desirable to have some sort of system indicating whether a
given template is xhtml certifiable according to the transitional or
strict standards.

Sounds like an excellent idea.  I'll setup a section of the Joomla NYC 
site to track this information if people are willing to take the time to

I see three qualities to judge for starters. There may be others.

1. Does the index.html file use a table or div tags for page layout
2. Does the index.html file call mosLoadModules using type options 0 or
1, or use 2, 3.
3. Is the index.html file arranged for source order content? Should we
assume that the component should load first for good source ordered
content?

=====================

I can visualize the website area as a checklist table. I'm currently
looking at bringing over the same type of thing for another organization
as I move it over to Joomla.

I know that there are a few in the user group that are not familiar with
coding. It might be worthwhile to present this in steps to the group as
a project. Perhaps stretch it out in half hour pieces over 2 or 3
months.

Then, seasoned coders can be bored and nod off. Non-programmers can have
their eyes glaze over and nod off too. Everyone can get a nice nap.

I see this more as an Amazon review type section, but specific to things 
we as a group care about, and specific to templates we as a group like.

In other words, have a section for template reviews, people can post a 
template their using with a link to the site they got it from(please 
note, I want members posting things they /use/ or things they decide not 
to use.  I don't want producers coming in and filling it up with 
everything they think people should use.)

I see the same thing for components, plugins, etc. 

Than the item can be reviewed, and we can guide the reviews to certain 
areas.

So people who are designers can talk about the layout, how a template 
has an excessive amount of dead whitespace and scrolls a lot of content 
under the fold and just sucks.

Wheras website builders can mention how easy or difficult the template 
is to use.

xhtml fanatics can discuss how well or badly it adheres to standards.

Accessibility people can mention how well it works in that 
regards(speaking of which, I'm setting up a Joomla site for my wife with 
an integrated muck and need a template that will work well with screen 
readers.  Any suggestions?  As for the muck, the screen reader is the 
reason I need it.  The strongest motivation for this site is my wifes 
friend up in Canada who is blind and can't get on to a lot of the mommy 
chatboards they congregate on because screen readers and java don't 
mix.  A muck she can access with std muck software that will talk to her.)

So, if there is a strong interest in a particular item(template reviews) 
and by interest I mean someone who is willing to spend some time putting 
in some initial reviews to get things going, I'd have no problem 
focusing on that piece first.

My experience is everyone is interested in /reading/, few are interested 
in producing(which makes sense, we all have day jobs, and most of us 
have night jobs as well, and families, etc so our time focus is on that, 
not on reviewing stuff for other people)

Message-ID: <4741F224.80606@beezifies.com>

I just figured out something which has bugged me for a while.

On the Joomla extentions directory, there is a little link to make an 
extention a "favorite"

If you go to "My Page" in the left hand menu, on your user profile are 
sections for extentions you have posted, extentions you have reviewed, 
and extentions you have flagged as a favorite.

So if you remember to flag extentions you want to come back to as a 
favorite, it will be in that list.

LOL... Favorites are nice, because they let you forget
about something for a while before coming back to it
(especiall for categories like content that have 800
extensions)...

Subject: [joomla] reference question
Message-ID: <1195578782.6768.11.camel@bokonen>

I'm looking through the developer section of the Joomla website,
researching components, and specifically the 'hello world' section.

There is a reference in the admin.hello.php file that is explained as
such:

We then include the file that will support the presentation layer.
$mainframe is a global variable in Joomla that has lots of useful
methods attached to it.  One of these methods is getPath.  It helps you
find common types of files.  In this instance we want the
admin.hello.html.php file to be include, so we pass 'admin_html' to the
getPath method.

I'm looking now for documentation on the $mainframe global variable,
although it seems to me that this is more an object. I'm trying to
understand how it is used, because the expample given above is like
saying 'if this is Tuesday, this must be Belgium.' I just don't follow
the logic, and looking through the reference might help me understand
what is going on.

==============

Perhaps I don't need to do any of this. I'm looking for a component that
will let me make tables in the component section of a web page. It
should draw its info from tables in the database, so I'll need
relational queries, and there should be a way to make forms so that
earthlings (administrators) will be able to change that data when
necessary. Is there anything out there that I can use without having to
adapt what I currently have to be a Joomla component?

==============

Is it necessary for me to know what is going on with the $mainframe
global variable, or is just serving as a distraction right now that I
can just as easily ignore until another time?

Thanks
Mark

Did you try the "Table Manager" component/mambot found in the joomla
extensions directory be doing a search for "table" ?

I think we've talked about this at a meeting but I didn't remember if 
there was a definitive answer. I am looking for a module that can be 
used to create a directory of local businesses in the neighborhood. 
Something very similar to the stuff that is out there for users, in that 
it would have the basic info about the business, address, email & 
description, and maybe even something like UHP for the businesses to 
have its own listing...?

Ideally they idea would be for users to be able to favourite a 
business/listing, rate/review it etc (so in this way its more like a 
content item than a user.) Is there something that hooks into CB that 
could do this? Or a plugin that does it by itself...?

ps- do we have a meeting planned for December? Because Thursday the 13th 
is the city wide IT holiday party which brings together PHP'ers, BSD'er 
and Unix'ers downtown. (You have to rsvp email me if you want the link) 
so it might be better to have the joomla meeting were on the 6th or 20th.

cheers,

Forest

Well, you could use SOBI2... That would pretty much do

Are Joomla users in whole invited to the party?  Or is
it just a curtisy?

The rsvp is at orgcom.info, which is also graciously hosted by our 
friends at nyphp. Hope to see you there, last couple years its been the 
best party of the season.

There's also Mosets Tree. 

There's a SOBI2 plugin for CB.  And Template Plazza has a template designed for SOBI2.

Oh duh, I found and downloaded SOBI last week, just been so busy it 
slipped my mind!
My mind is going Dave, do you want me to sing a song...?

Strange, I"m not getting Forest's emails.  Hey Forest, I sent you a 
request for URL's a few days back, did you reply to me?  Time to go spam 
folder hunting(and yes, I realise it's useless to ask him if my email 
server is destroying his email but hopefully someone else will reply so 
I know it went through).

SOBI, Adsmanager, Product Book, Noah's Classified, etc are all pretty 
much looooong flat tables that are user configurable.  So they all would 
work.

Another interesting extention is this little guy:
http://extensions.joomla.org/component/option,com_mtree/task,viewlink/link_id,2730/Itemid,35/

You give it a detail and comment table definition, adhering to certain 
rules, and it figures out and builds a basic input/list/view form for you.

As for the meeting, yes it is the 13th.  I'm bummed since that means 
either missing or going late to the party - but I've already got 
speakers lined up for the 13th, as well as space.  If there is interest 
from the members I can check with the speakers and Robert Half and see 
about the 6th instead of the 13th.  I won't do the 20th, no one will 
come on the 20th.

Message-ID: <47444A4B.4090302@beezifies.com>

Hey guys, don't forget to get those book reviews in.  Even if you want 
to do just a preliminary overview on our site, and then revisit it in a 
few weeks when you finish the book(and wait untill then to post to 
Amazon) it would be helpful for me to point our sponsors to the site and 
let them know we are moving forward with the reviews.  O'Reilly has some 
sweet books coming out over the next few months that, while not Joomla, 
are very good on the web design/php end with what looks like yummy ideas 
for incorporating into Joomla.

So let's show them we appreciate their support.

As for Packt, they have a book on making cash with Joomla that I should 
have by the next meeting for some poor sa....erm lucky member to borrow 
and review.

Well, I did some updating to this script.  It now
supports more than just php...

{php}echo "this is some php code";{/php}
{phpfile}/path/to/php/file.php{/phpfile}
{js}alert("This is javascript!");{/js}
{jsfile}http://www.mysite.com/jsfile.js{/jsfile}
{htmlfile}/path/to/html/file.html{/htmlfile}

The html file will attempt to only use the content
within the <body></body> tags...

Again, this is 1.5 native (and hence doesn't work on
1.0).

Message-ID: <47447DA9.7020809@beezifies.com>

There are a lot of commitments in december, so I have decided to cancel 
the december 13th meeting and instead have a december 6th meetup.

90% sure it will be at Robert Half,  we'll make it a hackfest to discuss 
Joomla problems, fix things, or get some small changes made.  If anyone 
wants to setup a *AMP server on their laptop and setup Joomla, I'll try 
to pull the various *amp packages and burn them to DVD along with some 
Joomla install packages and we can install them for people to play with 
at the meetup.

Message-ID: <009201c83194$babfec40$af24a8c0@SF2003.de>

I had this problem with an older and the current version of Security Image (SecurityImage 4.2.1).
My Joomla version is 1.0.8 Stable.

The component works fine for akoBook, but it does not work for the Joomla-Parch "Contact".

The Frontend says that the image-code was not entered correctely, though it was several times when testing.

I also had problem deactivating the component only for the contact-patch.

Unfortunately I had to turn it off globaly.

I will try the newest Joomla version.

Anybody having the same problem?

I tried version 1.0.12 now with the current SI version 4.2.1 and the patches for 1.0.12,
still "The code was not entered correctely" in any captcha!

Sorry, my fault. The patch version was for an older SI component. Works fine now!

Hi Joomla friends,

Next weekend, December 8-9, is a weekend of Pizza, Bugs, and Fun in
Washington DC, San Francisco, and New York.  We're gathering Joomla
developers from across the USA to knock out the remaining Joomla 1.5 tracker
bugs so we can help the core team get 1.5 out the door.

Simulcast around the world into other locations, this will truly be a
worldwide community effort, and we hope to have you join us!  For those that
can't make it to one of the host cities, you can always start an effort in
one of your local cities, and join us in the chat room and via web cam.

More information can be found at http://www.joomla.org.

Registrations at http://www.joomladayusa.org.

We're looking forward to seeing you all there!

Best,
Ryan

I'll root for you in spirit Anthony.  I"m over my quota this month for 
leaving the wife alone with the kids while I go out and have 'fun'.  :-)

Hi Ryan, I'm doing some updates to the Joomla NYC User Group site 
tonight(honestly...really this time), want this one added to the calendar?

FYI: We've been invited directly to participate in the New York 
Technical Party, http://www.orgcom.info/  held on Thursday, December 
13th - so those of you who keep that day free can make it!

Looks like it's going to be a fun party, for those interested Hans 
confirmed last night that spouses and guests are welcome, so feel free 
to bring along your significant other so they can complain about all the 
geektalk and enjoy the party.

Hey, I just realised we need a logo.  Any of our budding graphics 
designers willing to step up and design a NYC JUG logo so we have 
something to uniquely identify us for things like this holiday party?

I suppose we could use something that looks good at logo size, and 
favicon size(or a stripped down version for the favicon).

Mitch, care to comment on the "requirements" for integrating the Joomla 
logo so we don't get slapped by the Joomla IP police?

Subject: [joomla] Joomla NYC Layout
Message-ID: <474F23D8.6020307@beezifies.com>

Speaking of stuff we need, our site badly needs a redesign.

I'm curious what people think the main purpose of the site should be?  
I'm thinking meetings.

As such, I was thinking of rearranging the layout so the frontpage is 
purely a calendar for upcoming events.  Along the bottom I'd set a few 
modules to meet our sponsorship commitments(ie rotating logo of 
sponsors, latest news, whatnot) and the menu along the top.

Any thoughts, opinions, etc?

Basically we cannot use the Joomla logo itself in anything branded
specifically for the New York JUG. Here are the guidelines:

http://www.joomla.org/content/view/259/70/

And please stick to them, or I'll never hear the end of it! *grin*

Would you have examples of usage?  The documentation basically implies 
that you have to use the logo and no other imagery.  IE placing the 
Joomlo logo next the a picture of the empire state building, in the 
torch of the statue of liberty, or as a white label on a jug of cider 
would be unacceptable?

Personally, if anyone wants to contribute a logo and can't figure out 
the Joomla guidelines, I'm also open to simply not using it rather than 
try to fight with the main org over it.

I was once chastised for putting the logo on a gradient background and
giving it a slight reflection. *sigh*

Maybe we're better off just trying to come up with something nice, and
if it is cool we can try to convince j.org that we're not pirates...

Here are my thoughts, which outstrip my graphical skills(yes, I'm that 
bad...  I'll grit my teeth and do it when I'm being paid to do it, but I 
always end up losing money on the graphics design part).

Joomla Logo, white background, as a label on a jug of Apple Cider(hey, 
Apple Cider is very NY - if not NYC!) 

Joomla Logo inside the torch of the Statue of Liberty(yeah NJ residents, 
I went there.  She's /ours/ even if she is on your island! :-) ).

Joomla Logo at the top of the Empire State Building.

All of course with the words NYC Joomla User Group spelled out below for 
the dense.

Set it up, run it past the Joomla committee and use it temporarily, and 
if they nix it, we can remove the logo and just put the text NYC
JUG
 in it's place and when someone complains about us not using the 
logo...well, the Joomla committee told us not to, sorry.

Well tomorrow would be excellent! *giggle*

I was planning on basing the template design on free_lightframe, as it
is a perfect, pure CSS based layout that can be easily modified to
suit our needs.

Still wondering when folks will get back to Gary on what features
would be desired on a JUG website...

Until when?  Umm, whenever you want.  If you want to do a first draft 
and then a second draft later, I'm fine with that too.

We're flexible and open and don't have a lot of people volunteering to 
do stuff, so your wide open(and your free to completely ignore anything 
I say regarding ideas and go your own way as well).

I'll root for you in spirit Anthony. I"m over my quota this month for 
leaving the wife alone with the kids while I go out and have 'fun'. :-)

Hi Ryan, I'm doing some updates to the Joomla NYC User Group site 
tonight(honestly...really this time), want this one added to the calendar?

FYI: We've been invited directly to participate in the New York 
Technical Party, http://www.orgcom.info/ held on Thursday, December 
13th - so those of you who keep that day free can make it!

Looks like it's going to be a fun party, for those interested Hans 
confirmed last night that spouses and guests are welcome, so feel free 
to bring along your significant other so they can complain about all the 
geektalk and enjoy the party.

Hey, I just realised we need a logo. Any of our budding graphics 
designers willing to step up and design a NYC JUG logo so we have 
something to uniquely identify us for things like this holiday party?

I suppose we could use something that looks good at logo size, and 
favicon size(or a stripped down version for the favicon).

Mitch, care to comment on the "requirements" for integrating the Joomla 
logo so we don't get slapped by the Joomla IP police?

Speaking of stuff we need, our site badly needs a redesign.

I'm curious what people think the main purpose of the site should be? 
I'm thinking meetings.

As such, I was thinking of rearranging the layout so the frontpage is 
purely a calendar for upcoming events. Along the bottom I'd set a few 
modules to meet our sponsorship commitments(ie rotating logo of 
sponsors, latest news, whatnot) and the menu along the top.

Any thoughts, opinions, etc?

What's the plan for this? No official presentations? 
Just sort of a hack fest?

Basically we cannot use the Joomla logo itself in anything branded
specifically for the New York JUG. Here are the guidelines:

http://www.joomla.org/content/view/259/70/

And please stick to them, or I'll never hear the end of it! *grin*

Would you have examples of usage? The documentation basically implies 
that you have to use the logo and no other imagery. IE placing the 
Joomlo logo next the a picture of the empire state building, in the 
torch of the statue of liberty, or as a white label on a jug of cider 
would be unacceptable?

Personally, if anyone wants to contribute a logo and can't figure out 
the Joomla guidelines, I'm also open to simply not using it rather than 
try to fight with the main org over it.
