<PRE>You may have to upgrade/update later anyway as this is still a release
candidate so there is the possibility of code changes in the future
releases, but I think there is currently no upgrade path from Joomla 1.0.x
to Joomla 1.5, so maybe you should go ahead and build on 1.5 now, as it is
more likely that there will be an upgrade from this J1.5 RC to the next
before we see one for J 1.0.x to J1.5.

 

Does anyone know of anything different?

 

Thank you,

/var/www/apache2/joomla seems like an odd directory structure to me, are 
you sure it's not /var/apache2/www/joomla?

I put it into a subdirectory under /var/www. /var/www/apache-2 is another
(useless and baffling) directory that is just there.



And the most likely name is apache2.conf

Yes, but an empty httpd.conf file is also there.


Generally, I've found them to be:
User apache
Group apache

In Ubuntu 7.10 it is www-data


But it could be different in your case.

That is the userid and group that apache is running as, so if your going 
to chown files(and chgrp for that manner) change them to whatever the 
user and group directives are set to.

Curiously, everything now, and this is a fresh install of Ubuntu, is set as
root. I'll change it all to www-data for user and group, which do exist in
the passwd and group files.


It may be that /var/www is the web servers document root and
/var/www/apache2-default is a directory that contains a basic apache welcome
page. I believe that the default user and group for apache2 in Ubuntu is
www-data. So you may want to try: chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www

Exactly!


You may also want to check the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file
because in a default install it will redirect everything to that
apache2-default (welcome page) folder. You would just need to comment out
the RedirectMatch (around line 16), then you can install Joomla either
directly into the /var/www directory or create a /var/www/joomla directory
for it (don't forget to set ownership permissions)

I've already installed joomla as a sub of www, which is how I would prefer
it for now.

Let us know if that works.


This is set by default to /var/www

directly into the /var/www directory or create a /var/www/joomla directory
for it (don't forget to set ownership permissions)

Let us know if that works.

Yes, that is progress. Now I get:

Your Extension appears to be written for an older version of Joomla!. You
must enable the System - Legacy Plugin in the Plugin Manager if you wish to
complete this task.

Should I be trying 1.5 at this point? I though I heard it mentioned at the
meeting that upgrading of existing sites should be held off, but this is not
production yet, and I'd prefer to do not have to upgrade later.

Thanks so much to all for the help!!!!

Mark
