<PRE>Don't forget to take the free mac classes at the apple store, Soho has a good offering.
  I agree, that Macs are superior machines, but rehabituating to the interface can add some lagtime to your workflow. Especially in coding and locating where the heck you downloaded your files to. The end key.. I have no idea what function it serves on a mac b/c it doens't take me to the end of a line of code like in Windows, but you can use the apple key + left or right arrow and up and down arrow to get the the beginning and end of a line of code and to the top and bottom of a page, respectively.
   
  XAMPP also works on mac.

Just FYI, there are other options than full blown XP that work 
perfectly w/ VMware on OSX (for testing),

<A HREF="http://www.litepc.com/xplite.html">http://www.litepc.com/xplite.html</A>

These are cheaper + without the bloat. I think the whole Leopard / 
Spaces / Fusion setup is definitely worth it. You run both OS in full 
screen, easily swap between them, and have drag / drop / transfer 
capability.

I traded my first born + soul for a MacBook Pro + have not looked back.

I bought the lowest priced MacBook on the way home tonight, but haven't opened it yet. I feel guilty for spending the money -- I could have bought 2 Windows laptops for the price!

You now have the visual capacity of Wondows and the computational power
of Unix. Yeah, sticker shock is tough, but you'll learn to love the Mac.
I'm a Linux person, my wife is on her second Mac, and neither of us miss
Windows, except for watching some DVDs that don't get recorded properly.

Look around, there are probably windows licenses you can use from old
computers, right? Take the Vista license from your old Dell and install
it on your Mac.

Don't forget, if you have a business you can write the Mac off as an
expense. ;)

I'm downloading MAMP. I assume that's where I start?

I also can't find Firefox which I d/l'd and installed last night. Hmmm.
