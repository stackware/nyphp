I see this more as an Amazon review type section, but specific to things 
we as a group care about, and specific to templates we as a group like.

In other words, have a section for template reviews, people can post a 
template their using with a link to the site they got it from(please 
note, I want members posting things they /use/ or things they decide not 
to use.  I don't want producers coming in and filling it up with 
everything they think people should use.)

I see the same thing for components, plugins, etc. 

Than the item can be reviewed, and we can guide the reviews to certain 
areas.

So people who are designers can talk about the layout, how a template 
has an excessive amount of dead whitespace and scrolls a lot of content 
under the fold and just sucks.

Wheras website builders can mention how easy or difficult the template 
is to use.

xhtml fanatics can discuss how well or badly it adheres to standards.

Accessibility people can mention how well it works in that 
regards(speaking of which, I'm setting up a Joomla site for my wife with 
an integrated muck and need a template that will work well with screen 
readers.  Any suggestions?  As for the muck, the screen reader is the 
reason I need it.  The strongest motivation for this site is my wifes 
friend up in Canada who is blind and can't get on to a lot of the mommy 
chatboards they congregate on because screen readers and java don't 
mix.  A muck she can access with std muck software that will talk to her.)

So, if there is a strong interest in a particular item(template reviews) 
and by interest I mean someone who is willing to spend some time putting 
in some initial reviews to get things going, I'd have no problem 
focusing on that piece first.

My experience is everyone is interested in /reading/, few are interested 
in producing(which makes sense, we all have day jobs, and most of us 
have night jobs as well, and families, etc so our time focus is on that, 
not on reviewing stuff for other people)
