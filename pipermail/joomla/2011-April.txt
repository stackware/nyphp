Perhaps. But he may actually be making valid points that are hard for an
entrenched community to hear due to their loyalty to a product they?ve
worked with for years. Being new to Joomla, I can?t really speak to the
veracity of Alec?s statements, but his problems with Joomla seem to be
grounded in the core codebase, something many Joomla site
designers/developers probably know little about. Sounds like good fodder for
discussion though.

Greg, why do you say "he may actually be making valid points" while in the next 
sentence admitting "I can't speak to the veracity of Alec's statements"?

I can tell you that this article is inaccurate.  The author says Joomla has a 
built-in forum.  Joomla does NOT.  He says the SEO plugin is encrypted.  Joomla 
is GPL, so where's the encryption.  What is he referring to here, the SEF?  That 
is definitely not encrypted.  


Most people who knock Joomla haven't looked at it since 1.0, when it was Mambo.

I don't know why he's calling it a fractured community.  Most people using 
Joomla in 2011 don't even know there is a Mambo.  Mambo has gone the way of 
phpNuke.  It's off the map.  Their last security announcement was 05-09-2009.

There are a flurry of new comments posted to the foliovision article disputing 
this flawed critique of "Joomla/Mambo". 


Thanks for posting this, Helv?cio.  As one commenter stated, the worst thing 
about Joomla is all the misinformation about it put out by the Drupal community.

What's the difference between this card and a regular pen-drive?

I mean, does it run anything interesting by itself? I didn't quite

He made it by hand....  LOL... sorry, this particular one at the moment
isn't anything more than a USB drive.... though it does include a tiny
microprocessor one could repurpose.

Personally for myself, I'd rather splurge on a 10$ AVR32 chip which can
run a cutdown version of linux....and compile PHP onto it with Joomla
installed and my resume/contact info preloaded. :-)

But then your getting into a lot more complications[how do you make it a
"network" so the user can connect to it.....]


Or for mass production, going with a
http://evilmadscience.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/74-atmegaxx8
breadboard and doing something there[bluetooth vcard database?  speaker
which says something?  Not so thrilled with the POV card, but it is
pretty neat. 
http://hackaday.com/2011/03/21/pov-business-card-is-guaranteed-to-get-you-noticed/

I find it thrilling that this stuff is now mass marketed to the point
where you can build something functional like this for under 25$....[I
think the one I linked to originally runs around 10$ for the parts]....

I find it even more thrilling that a noob like me can actually read
through this stuff and figure out how to put one of these together.... 
[just wish there was a hackerspace up here in Kingston like the one you
lucky dogs have down in NYC]

Yeah, I think his blog article was purely linkbait.  He did not have one valid 
example of his claims against Joomla.  I think it's a libelous action.

I think that the Open Source Community would be better served if we focus
on cooperation and not juvenile exercise in stupidity. This
Joomla/WordPress/Drupal Thread is just a mindless exercise and? waste of
time. I use all three Content Management Systems (CMS) and can see a
practical argument for using each one for specific applications. In other
words, not one CMS is the blue ribbon winner. I have several mid to small
size public library customers that would never be able to support Drupal
and see why they like Joomla CMS. While, I see larger Academic libraries
using Drupal because they have an IT department that can assist? in the
management of the site.
There are many more arguments to support this idea that I will not belabor
you with. 

Television News and Politics make us think that the world is black and
white. Isn't the world much more interesting because we are so different
and so alike? And, isn't the world of computers stronger when we have
alternative choice and not monopolies?

Subject: [joomla] A little research to promote Joomla!
Message-ID: <BANLkTikwGGPRL14CgT6hFg9zSj0HYzBjEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

In an effort to promote Joomla in Rio de Janeiro, I want to write an
article for my blog (and perhaps create a presentation) on people who
are NOT developers, programmers, designers or the like and chose
Joomla to run their website, either on a profesional or personal
level. And is still running gladly!

I'd like to collect material to show how Joomla can be used in diverse
situations by people who are NOT experts. It'd be ideal if the person
has gone through all basic steps (installation, configuration, daily
usage).

If you feel this is you, please contact me in pvt. I'd like to hear
from your experience.

Thank you in advance!

Hi Carolyn,

My name is Brad.

My team built this film distribution platform http://www.indiesdirect.com

It is a magento based e-commerce platform.

People can buy, download to own, or progressive download the films from our
website.

Have you thought about being on a platform like this?

Is this conducive to your business model?

We can match it to your brand.

Thanks for your time.

If you would like to learn more I would be happy to have a quick chat.

Best,
Brad Gans

Hi Folks,

I want to remind everyone that tonight is the monthly meeting for the
Joomla NYC User Group. As always, it starts at 6:30 PM at Rose Hall on
West 65th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam, two blocks south of
the Apple Store on Broadway.

This month, speakers include Elin Waring, Scott Wolpow and myself.

Lots of prizes to give away, including Joomla instruction by
OSTraining, Joomla books by Barrie North and pizza!

Hope to see everyone there.

And as a blatant plug this is my last NYCJUG meeting before moving to

afford to move with me. Hope to be of use to someone there, and hope
you all take so I don't have to break my back lugging around all these
books in my granny cart.

I want to thank everyone who attended last night's Joomla NYC meeting.

We had a good crowd, including three new faces. It's great to see more
people using Joomla.

Among the high lights: the lightning round, where questions were asked
and answered involving Joomla 1.6 adoption and Amazon's S3 service.
Elin Waring gave a great tutorial on how to create a plug-in to add
additional fields in Joomla 1.6's native contact form.

Extra thanks to Scott for ordering the pizza and Stuart for bringing
up the Poland Spring.

See you all next month!

Hey everyone!

I'd like to have a Joomla website I'm working on simply to fit into an
iPhone screen.

I've tried using a meta tag to achieve this in my template (<meta
name=?viewport? content=?width=320? />) with no luck.

I don't wanna take time to create a whole new template that can be
rearranged through a specific stylesheet for the iPhone.

I even found an interesting component called MobileJoomla but it
relies on as specific template/stylesheet.

Thanks for any tips.

Your going to need to go through the steps to create a mobile style sheet.

If you check out te framework from joomart they have a good system that
might be able to work for you, example using your template for you default
and the t3 for mobile

Subject: [joomla]  Any developers interested in partnering/contract work?
Message-ID: <BANLkTimBEaKEL0HPd8PkK8McAd_azaSMEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been following this thread for a couple years now, and though I
haven't responded much, it has been a great help in my own pursuit of
becoming a better developer with Joomla.

As a developer, things are moving much faster now with many
opportunities to pursue, but I am finding that I cannot handle all of
it myself. I was wondering if there any other developers on this
thread who would be interested in partnering to explore larger scale
project opportunities or doing contract work to help me implement a
few projects coming on the table now, as well as a number of them that
are coming up.

I tend to focus on small (sometimes very small) business and
start-ups, in addition to the occasional mid-size organizations. My
projects tend to range from basic/informational sites all the way to
rich media, commerce and social networking projects, and sometimes all
of the above.

I usually handle all of the development, as well as a lot of the
design myself, but I am at the point where I can't personally
implement the amount of opportunities that are now surfacing.

If you are competent, confident and flexible we should talk. Dollar
amounts for contract work typically range from $600 to $3000,
depending on the scope of the project. Much of higher of course for
larger projects.

I feel I personally excel more on the sales/client relationship side
of things, but have had to take up development in a big way because of
a few not-so-positive scenarios from working with contractors in the
past. But that was then, this is now. If you by nature tend to lean
more to the developer side, then we may have a potential synergy.

Please let me know if any of you are interested in any of this. Let me
know what your skills are, if you have any links you can point me to,
etc. send them to me at arzieh at gmail.com.

Look forward to hearing from you guys (and gals :-).

Sincerely,

Arzie Hardin
