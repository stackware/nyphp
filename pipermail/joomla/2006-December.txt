Subject: [joomla] writing a module need some help getting user id
Message-ID: <4576EBF9.2070509@gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

My name is Seizo and I run a music licensing site and I look forward to 
working with this community.

I'm putting together a module and would love some help. I have joomla 
1.0.11, and Community Builder 1.0.2. I am surprised how difficult it has 
been to find a module to do a simple file upload with a few added fields.

The module is in a music licensing site and it needs to take the 
following information:
1) user name
2) first name
3) Type of license they want (exclusive, non-exclusive)
4) The fee they would like to charge.
5) The name of the file to upload.

Only registered members (and I'm going to implement a tiered membership, 
silver, gold etc) may upload files and see the upload form.

The module also needs to confirm that all the information is there, 
match the user name and first name filled in by user (for security 
reasons), validate the form, validate the upload, send an email to the 
administrator that a new upload has been received with all the relevant 
details and send an email to the user that the upload has been received.

I have this sort of working but I know it's not the most elegant 
solution. mod_fileupload (my module) calls an external php script to 
actually handle the uploading and the email generation, and prints to 
the screen, on a blank page the success of the upload. The user then has 
to hit the back button to return to the website or else if I redirect 
them to the home page, it appears as if they are logged out. However 
since I don't know how to get the user information to verify I have to 
take it on faith that the user actually typed in their real username and 
first name. The reason is it's important is that the file they send me, 
then gets reviewed by my staff, and if approved, added as a product to 
the licensing store, and the user gets paid if the product gets 
licensed, but I need to verify that the user is who they are and that 
they do not abuse the site, or the upload section to cause harm.

Does anyone know how to get the user name and first name from within a 
module on a system using community builder? If I can get that 
information I should be able to verify and be much happier with the 
module. Thanks for your help.

Seizo

Subject: [joomla] adding rating system
Message-ID: <de90f9680612251053y38c691d5ldd3d2a8e013fb991@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to add a rating system to the website I created with Joomla, but I am
not too familiar with Joomla package. I did look at the Rating in the Beta
1.5 but I want something slightly different. So I have two questions:

1. If we how a rating in place for content item (for instance, we have a
field in the jos_content table called 'rating'), how easy it is to create a
separate page that publishes some of the (say 10 items) content sorted by
the 'rating'.

2. Now, in order to provide a user interface for rating, I'd like to add a
flash component (that takes user_id and message/content Id as parameters)
before each content item? How can I achieve this. Can I use Joomla's nice
User Interface/Control Panel for admin to help add this component. Or I need
to hack the Code?

[Once done, I can provide the component/Flash component to Joomla people if
they reckoned useful]


Regards,

Rostam

I have some basic newbie questions regarding Joomla templates.

How come the template graphics (i.e. JPG, PNG, etc.) files for the 
template are not available in the Media Manager?

If I download a template, such as from http://rockettheme.com and want 
to use it as-in, but with different graphics, how it this accomplished?

Thanks!

Template graphics is stored within the template directory.
At rockettheme you'll find forums and howto's to help you
do the graphic changes you need for all the templates
provided there.

Most templates for Joomla are designed to be modular, meaning everything
that a particular template may need to function properly should be in the
templates own directory like the template_css.css file, the index.php file
and the graphics associated with the template. The graphics you see in the
Media Manager are more like "content" graphics which, if missing should not
"break" the functionality of the template itself.

One thing you can do, so you don't destroy your template while trying to
change the graphics, is to make a copy of the templates directory (and
sub-directories) in the Joomla template directory. Then by making a few
small changes to the templateDetails.xml file (change name, etc.) you can
have a test template to play with. You can then "activate" or "deactivate"
it via the SITE > TEMPLATE MANAGER. You can change the graphics in the
images folder of this template copy and check the results on your site as
you do it. When your done playing you can switch back to your "real"
template in the SITE >TEMPLATE MANAGER again.

This is just one way of doing it (and probably no the best).

I hope this helps you to have some more fun with Joomla.

Hey Rostam,

I'm surprised that you cannot find an existing extension in the
extensions directory that would do this for you.

As I've done nothing but live and breathe 1.5 since it was mambo 2000
(giggle) I can honestly say it would take a bit for me to remember how
to implement this in the 1.0 codebase.

Again though, I really think you should check the extensions directory
first, chances are your answer is already there.

Congratulations Ben, you've just written the most important joomla
template tutorial.

> This is just one way of doing it (and probably no the best).

And this is exactly how some of the best joomla template designers get
their start.

Honest, this is why the platform is so popular, you just copy pieces
and muck around until you get what you want - or teach yourself how to
do it the way you wanted in the first place.

Thanks to Lars for pointing out the howtos at rockettheme.com. I was so 
dazzled by the look of the templates there, I completely missed the 
tutorials.

Ben, Your mini-tutorial here was very helpful. I see now, that in order 
to keep the template totally independent that it is stored and treated 
differently.

Mitch, I've always learned by mocking around, and glad to see that 
Joomla templates are no different!

Hi Mr. North!

I am learning how to create Joomla templates by using the tutorials on
your site.

Are you thinking about doing a Joomla template workshop or two at
NYPHP for Joomla novices anytime in the immediate future. ;) :).

Photos of baby are on the website
http://blog.phil-taylor.com/2006/12/14/while-she-was-sleeping/

If I come to NY I'll be "dragging" the wife and baby with me - far 
better than photos :)

Just need to find CHEAPER accommodation in NY as I refuse to pay for the 
holiday inn opposite Macy's and don't want baby to go to the youth 
hostel (Where I stayed near Times Square)

So does anyone know of some good (and clean!) accommodation, or has an 
apartment/house/boat/shed to rent for a single week or up to three in 
feb/march to help out this PHP guy his wife and newborn baby? Preferably 
on Manhattan Island but anything considered, Internet access a bonus. 
??? Please reply off list to phil at phil-taylor.com

Many thanks
/me stops abusing list now....

I have gotten what can only be described as Joomla Fever(TM). I have

Glad to see people using this list again. If you have newbie users, I 
always point mine to these 2 quick start guides:

   1. http://www.netshinesoftware.com/downloads/Joomla%20Quick%20Start%201.0.pdf
   2. http://www.redevolution.com/content/view/52/63/ (requires login to
      download)

I find that showing the user how to use Joomla is the only hurdle to 
using it. Once they see the light, they never want to go back to any 
other website creation and delivery system they've ever used.

Barrie has some great tutorials at his site. He is a gifted writer for 
these types of things. Glad to see you here, Mr. North. ;)

Happy Holidays-
Graham
