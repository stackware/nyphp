Subject: [joomla] Joomla "Failed Deleting" Messages after Upgrade to

Hi Kenny.

I was about to write that it looks like permissions and asking you to do a
ls -ls in some directories and how explain how the chmod command works, but
then I realized you did say Windows server environment. If you don't mind
me asking, why is this Joomla installation being hosted on Windows than
Linux?

Excellent article in Sitepoint on how some clients can takeover a great
project and screw it up.

Fortunately, most of our clients are too smart to do these things ;-)

I hope you laugh like I did after reading it.

I guess there is none, unfortunately.

You have to go through the foruns.

But K2 basics is not that hard.

As Helvecio said, there is no manual (at least not one that I know about)
for K2.

However OSTraining has produced a great series of videos showing how to use
K2 with Joomla 2.5. I am not sure if it is free or not, but it might be
worth checking out.

this switch is that in addition to receiving email communication, the posts
are archived and visible on YAHOO!.

Join the joomlanyc YAHOO! Group to receive announcements about our meetings
and events  

Yahoo Group logo

The Yahoo Group is not listed in the Yahoo Group Directory because we want
membership to come principally from the New York City area and Joomla VIPs
from around the world who know the group from our members and JoomlaDay
events.

To subscribe to the group send an email to:
joomlanyc-subscribe at yahoogroups.com

or go to

http://groups.yahoo.com/

and where it says "Find a Yahoo! Group" enter joomlanyc


then under the logo Yahoo Groups Logo2select "Join this group".  If you
don't already have a Yahoo ID, you can sign up for one.

This information is repeated on our website at 

http://www.joomlanyc.org/index.php/mailing-list-yahoo-group-forum

 

Tell your Joomla friends.  I will also make a one-time export of the list's
subscribers and send an invite from Yahoo.

 

I hope to see on YAHOO! Soon.

NYCJUG President

Tried the search -- no match for joomlanyc.  So, I clicked on the email
link, and I guess that worked (?).

Message-ID: <E3FE6DB0-D0C9-48EF-8184-03E7A76213D4@whyknott.com>

Hello,

I have a client that would like to restrict Special Offers on their Joomla desktop website to those who like them on facebook first. 
Then the Joomla article page is presented with the specials after liking.

I found this Extension but the developer is retiring the product so I'm left with trying to figure out another solution:
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/access-a-security/site-access/content-restriction/21668


I guess I could use a registration Extension like this one but it only has facebook as a login option:
http://master.demo.offlajn.com/demo.html#improved_ajax_login_and_register

Any help would be appreciated

Thanks,
Kenny

JUpgrade and SP Upgrade: Extensions for migrating Joomla 1.5 to 2.5 or 3.0.
A lot of Joomla 1.5 sites are being hacked.  The community needs to come
together and increase the awareness amongst site owners of the need to
update sites for security reasons.  All the popular CMS's need periodic
updating for security reasons.  If we don't want Joomla to get a bad
reputation, we need to understand the release cycle.  At this an future
meetings we will discuss ways to better communicate maintenance requirements
to our clients and how to get paid for it.

See your site Migrated from 1.5 to 2.5:  If you have a simple 1.5 site you
want upgraded to 2.5 in my presentation, bring an Akeeba backup of it on a
flash drive and we'll give it a whirl. Note: I'll only be able to do one.

8:15 - 8:30 - Lightening Round
8:30 - 9:00  Networking

Message-ID: <CAOt=9538ZWy8R69_rs3a1eUnKbi7mBfoDM8HkngiyaZsauUb+g@mail.gmail.com>

HI All,

i'm a fairly experienced Joomla user, but don't have too much experience
with a full blown blog.  I was wondering if i should just use the Joomla
(2.5), with an extension for commenting.  Or should i go for a blogging
component. If anyone has recommendation for either it would be appreciated.

thanks,

Todd

ps. i would have posted in the new Yahoo group but wasn't sure exactly how
to.

Hey Todd

I suggest you use the extension called K2 that allows you to have several
blog functionalities right out of the box. It's a framework not just a blog
extension, which can be very useful to learn if you are a Joomla developer.

Todd, 

Might I also suggest you look at Yootheme Zoo as a framework and blog as
well as Easyblog. The later is not a framework but is an impressive
out-of-the-box blogging component for Joomlaa CMS.

Subject: [joomla] pagination override in a K2 Template
Message-ID: <B1AEDB69-DF88-472B-9373-5DE28DB3CBB3@gmail.com>

Hi All,

Just wondering if anyone has had this issue.  I'm trying modify my pagination. I'm currently running K2 on my joomla site (2.9) and would like to reword the pagination output.  I know i can modify the core files, but i was trying to do it through a template override.  
However, the pages i have being paginated are using a K2 Template override, so I'm not sure where to put the files.   I tried to do a basic template override and put the pagination.php file in mytemplate/html folder, but i ended up breaking the layout.

any idea or similar issues.  I checked on the forums but didn't see any solutions to pagination overrides.

thanks in advance.,
Todd

Not quite sure I understand what you want to accomplish, but if you want to
override any K2 output you must copy the folder templates to
/templates/YOUR-TEMPLATE/html/com_k2/

Then you rename the folder DEFAULT to whatever name you want. Do whatever
changes you want to these files.

On the backend, go to the categories you want the changed files be applied
to. On the top of parameters you will notice a TEMPLATE option. If you
click on it (and did everything right) you will see the name of the folder
where your changed files are contained.

Now, K2 will use those template files instead of its default.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for the response.
i actually have 2 alternate K2 layout overrides that i have in my Templates
folder/html/com_K2.  They both work and when i goto my menus i use them as
layout overrides for certain pages.

The file that i want to modify is pagination.php, which is apart of
joomla's core. I could modify the core file but i want to have different
pagination outputs on different pages.  I tried to make a copy of the
pagination.php file and put it in one of the K2 layout override folders i
created, but that didn't work. I also tried putting it in the HTML folder
w/in my template folder and it ended up breaking the layout.

If CSS formatting does the trick and your site is running on pure Joomla
core, you can have a specific ID for each page of your site and use it to
make different calls from your css stylesheet.

Subject: [joomla] A Category got indexed and it's in blog format
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv8V3Gt59ufD3rGOtA5xWFUoWnSJsHuRR7HMFp3t3q0QGg@mail.gmail.com>

This is a odd problem. I noticed a search engine picked up a link to the
website where it's a link to a Category in Blog format. The odd thing is
the entire website has nothing in blog format nor is anything intentionally
linked to a Category.

The link looks like this example:

http://example.com/8-primarycontent

There is indeed a Category with an id of 8, and it's name is "primary
content".I went to Global and there is only LIST or BLOG for a Category,
but in reality I don't want either I don't want this accessible at all. Is
there a way to prevent this page from being served? Or is this something
Joomla just does and this was a terrible way to find out about it? :-)
Thanks!

Try using a robot.txt to disallow this specific page.

You can override the core pagination.php file by copying it to your
template's HTML directory. Within it, you could add some sort of logic for
the different output, even by menu item I suppose.

Hello everyone,

 

This line of code > meta name="generator" content="Joomla! - Open Source

there anyway of hiding it?

Yes there is. I don't recall the extension but you should be able to find
it at Joomla.org.

No need to install an extension.

Just cut and paste this line of code in the JEXEC or die PHP code block at
the top of the
index.php file

// Remove the generator meta tag
$this->setGenerator(null);

And once you are done, the code should look something like this:

<?php
/**
 * @copyright  Copyright (C) 2009 - 2012 Stephen Britton.
 * http://www.joomlajems.com
 * @license    GPL 2 or later
 */

defined('_JEXEC') or die;
$app = JFactory::getApplication();

A WHOLE BUNCH OF CODE IS IN HERE DEPENDING ON THE TEMPLATE

// Remove the generator meta tag
$this->setGenerator(null);

?>

Hope this helps.

Doesn't that get overwritten when you upgrade Joomla?

You really don't need an extension to change the generator tag, you can do
it from within the template itself. From
https://github.com/construct-framework/construct5/blob/master/elements/logic.php#L96

// Change generator tag
$this->setGenerator('Super Cool Generator Tag');

Hi David,

The code in the template's index.php file tells core not to write the
generator meta tag. The template is not part of core Joomla so updates do
not overwrite templates (at least they are not supposed to :-)  The concept
is like HTML overrides.

Subject: [joomla] W3C Validation Service and Joomla
Message-ID: <B71447B3C26A4800961831F464DE2C48@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone;

 

Is W3C validation service compatible with Joomla? I tested one of my
pages/article, the results did not match my > article > Toggle Source Code
view. Is there someplace else I need to at in other to edit errors in html?

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda
