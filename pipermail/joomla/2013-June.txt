Subject: [joomla] Keep your site up to date
Message-ID: <CAJ4JCSR30YXJq5KLS8LrmhU_ZQ8hFMEkR6uOdMXzwHb19xNv8Q@mail.gmail.com>

At the last Joomla NYC meeting I spoke about the joomla.org website, and
drifted off to many topics including some good development practices. One
of the things I try to do with my websites is to remove all content and
extensions not in use.

if you are not using a component - uninstall it. That component could at
some point become a backdoor for hacking even if you are not using it. We
sometimes just ignore things not in use and don't bother to upgrade them.
This can be dangerous.

Removing content makes it easier for a client to work on the site. How many
times have you tried to save an article/menu/category only to find there is
one trashed with the same alias? Remove things you aren't using. Keep it
clean.

I was just looking for something on a website. I know it was joomla because
I use wappalyser in firefox. I couldn't find what I was looking for and I
used the search box to find it. Well, the search results included articles
from the Park demo site that comes with the standard installation. Looks
like the developer didn't remove all those demo articles. Doesn't look good
to have "Baw Baw National Park"  in your search results.

Starting with Joomla 1.7, there is an Update feature, that will check your
installed extensions against their home repository for updates.  The JED
will specify which Extensions use this feature - for example:
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/directory-a-documentation/downloads/3115

Of course, Joomla itself has an updater built into it now, too.

Both Akeeba Admin Tools and http://manage.myjoomla.com will also help you
keep your site up to date, warning you if it is not, as well as other
security features which are useful for an Admin to utilize.

Hi Geoffrey,
I think my point was to keep things clean. There are three scenarios. In
the the first, we manage a site we developed. In the second, we turn the
site over to a client to manage and see it again only when they ask for
maintenance. In the third, we are hired to upgrade and maintain a site
developed by another company. These are the 3 scenarios I encounter. I
spend hours every day working on sites originally developed by others and I
wade through a lot of unused stuff.

When I am working on one of my own sites, if I'm not using a component, I
uninstall it. I frequently try different components to see how they work on
the site and then settle on one for production use. I uninstall the ones I
don't use. In the second scenario, I try to give clients a site that
contains only the content and components in use. This makes it easier for
them to maintain. When I take over a large site originally developed by
another company it is always a pleasure to inherit a clean site that I
don't have to sift through. This goes for content too.

I usually forget to trash the demo weblinks. So if I search for the word
"park" on the frontend of a site, I want to see their content and not Baw
Baw National Park. I hear a lot of keyboards clicking now ;-)

Yes, Joomla upgrading has come a long way!

Subject: [joomla] Hotspot Link in article image
Message-ID: <63243683C4414D01AFEBFD6F7A22DB5A@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone!

 

Using J2.5

 

Is there a way to create a "hotspot" with link to another document in an
image in Joomla?

 

I would like to have an image (png) in my article. In that image I will have
three items. 

 

For example:

 

*	In the image Item 1 is an apple I would like to have a link from the
apple to another page with image of apple orchard.
*	Item 2 is horse, with a link to another document.
*	Item 3 is an airplane with link to an airport.

 

Is there a way to accomplish the above in Joomla?

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Hello,

It sounds like you need an image map. There is a good article on creating
client-side image maps, with regards to accessibility, at
http://accessibility.psu.edu/imagemaps#client. I've always used online
image-map tools to create them and and then copy/paste the code where you
need it.

In the past, I've used http://www.maschek.hu/imagemap/ with good results. I
don't know about Dreamweaver or Fireworks, but if they can generate the
code, you could use them as well.

Looking at -mascheck.hu- Once you copy the code, how or where do you insert
the code in Joomla. I suppose you go to article that contains image and open
the html viewer.

code, you could use them as well.

Hello,

 

It sounds like you need an image map. There is a good article on creating
client-side image maps, with regards to accessibility, at
http://accessibility.psu.edu/imagemaps#client. I've always used online
image-map tools to create them and and then copy/paste the code where you
need it.

Hello everyone!

 

Using J2.5

 

Is there a way to create a "hotspot" with link to another document in an
image in Joomla?

 

I would like to have an image (png) in my article. In that image I will have
three items. 

 

For example:

 

*	In the image Item 1 is an apple I would like to have a link from the
apple to another page with image of apple orchard.
*	Item 2 is horse, with a link to another document.
*	Item 3 is an airplane with link to an airport.

 

Is there a way to accomplish the above in Joomla?

 

 

Best regards,

 Digest, Vol 78, Issue 3
Message-ID: <CAMtoWUGycGB_K9qeB4thVW4wHfuX3RRZEJmABVQV-T2T6KCiZQ@mail.gmail.com>

To create links in an image use image map tags.
http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_map.asp

If you would like to use a graphical environment to generate your html you
can use the gimp which is free and open source software which works on
Windows Mac and Linux. Here is a link to a youtube video explaining the
process of creating the html necessary.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt8euR1EFeQ

Once you've created your map code, make sure you have permissions
configured in joomla to allow the use of map tags. Then use the view source
link on your joomla wysiwyg editor to insert the appropriate code into your
joomla article.

Hello everyone,

 

I'm looking for slide show software, can someone suggest one they have
worked with and liked?

 

Free is good but not required, I don't mind paying for better features and
most important, ease of use.

This of course is to host Joomla websites, so it is on topic. ;-)

I'd be interested to hear from anyone who has great experiences with
dedicated server hosting companies. I'm mainly concerned with stellar
24-hour support and managed CentOS servers. Thanks!

I've been very happy with Green Geeks, for the most part:

https://www.greengeeks.com/dedicated-servers/

They have the occasional lapse, but overall they have been far more
competent than many of the other hosts I've dealt with, and have fled
screaming from.

I have found that when trying to copy 2.5/3.1 sites, they don't work.? :-/

In Joomla 1.5 it was not a problem to copy the site then update the log and tmp paths in the global configuration, as well as database if applicable, and the site would work just fine, whether it was copying to another folder on the same server, or copying to another server.

It may be an SEO error - check your SEO-Friendly URL settings, and also
make sure you renamed / enabled .htaccess!

Thankx for the reply but I didn't copy site. I installed a BRAND new
instance of Joomla 2.511 both times in my local pc. Up to now I have
installed at least 100 sites in my pc, many for tutorial purposes and never
an issue until now. :-(

 

 

 

 

Best regards,

I have found that when trying to copy 2.5/3.1 sites, they don't work.  :-/

In Joomla 1.5 it was not a problem to copy the site then update the log and
tmp paths in the global configuration, as well as database if applicable,
and the site would work just fine, whether it was copying to another folder
on the same server, or copying to another server.

I just installed a new instance of j2.5.11 in my pc (localhost).

 

I have an article (published) in menu I have link to that article, when I
click on it I get the following error;

 

 


Object not found!


The requested URL was not found on this server. The link on the referring
page <http://localhost/Tato/>  seems to be wrong or outdated. Please inform
the author of that page <http://localhost/Tato/>  about the error. 

If you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster
<mailto:postmaster at localhost> . 


Error 404

localhost <http://localhost/> 
06/21/13 17:01:58
Apache/2.2.21 (Win32) mod_ssl/2.2.21 OpenSSL/1.0.0e PHP/5.3.8 mod_perl/2.0.4
Perl/v5.10.1 

 

 

As a test I installed another new instance of j2.5.11 and the only extension
I added was the jce editor. Created a new article when to menu manager and
added the link to (single article) menu and I get the same results. Can
anyone help?

 

 

 

Best regards,

I changed SEO Setting,

 

*	Search Engine Friendly to no
*	Use URL Rewriting to no

 

Enabled .htaccess < I don't know about that. Where can I find that?

Geoffrey,

 

That was it of all the entries in Global Configuration / SEO Settings the
culprit was "Use URL rewriting" when I clicked on NO All my troubles went
away.

 

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!
