Subject: [joomla] Joomla PBF/Bazar...  Calling all volunteers!
In-Reply-To: <15332.53222.qm@web34201.mail.mud.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <331015.54288.qm@web34207.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hey guys, we (the Joomla Dev team/Bug Squad) is holding another event.  We're looking to set up a New York group, so anyone who is interested, please contact me at ircmaxell(at)yahoo(dot)com.  You can read more at: 
http://docs.joomla.org/Pizza_Bugs_and_Fun_2


Here's the official notification:



We eagerly announce the second Joomla! Pizza Bug and Fun event scheduled for the weekend of June 21 and 22. It's hard to believe that six months have passed since the first Joomla! Pizza Bug and Fun event. The first PBF helped finalize Joomla! 1.5 and, if all goes as planned, this second event will help prepare Joomla! 1.5.4 for release early in July. 

This opportunity is not restricted to those who can code since there are a wide variety of important tasks that will be offered in a Joomla! Bazaar over the weekend. This is a great way for Joomla! developers, designers, site builders, and end users all over the world to give something back to the project and be able to claim "I helped make Joomla! better."

The Bugs
For our first PBF event, we targeted priority 1 and 2 bugs and tested the entire application. Since it's release, Joomla! 1.5 has been very stable and there are no serious bugs to fix. But, there are a number of medium priority items that require patches and testing. If we are able to empty the tracker during the weekend, it would be an important accomplishment for the community. 

The Joomla! Bazaar
You might be wondering what is the Joomla! Bazaar? A bazaar is a marketplace where stallholders display their wares to passers-by who can look at the goods on offer and maybe purchase something that catches their eye. It is also a reference to Eric S. Raymond's book "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" which sets out the model for open source development.

The Joomla! Pizza Bug and Fun event will follow this bazaar metaphor. There will be a number of different virtual stalls where community members can browse tasks available from the bug squad, the documentation team, the translations working group, and so on. Stallholders will communicate via IRC channels and Skype group chats to help each participant find a perfect way to contribute to the project. 

How can you help?
If you are willing to offer a venue for this event, sign up and the location will be included in event announcements. We also encourage groups as small as two, three, and four people to work together during the weekend. If you are not able to participate with a group, you can still join the event online. It will be great to see community members from all over the world working together. If you are interested in being a part of the Joomla! Pizza Bug and Fun event, sign up now. 

More information will soon follow. Consider participating. It is guaranteed to be a fun event and an honor to help improve Joomla!.

Too bad that conflicts with the Clearwater Festival in Croton-on-Hudson.
I won't be able to make it for that reason.

Hi gang,

While discussing this month's presentation, it became somewhat obvious
to ask the list what would be interesting for me to present. We have
finally launched that monster website at MTV, and it has been up for
long enough to have learned a great deal of things. You might be sick
of me talking about it, and be completely enamored with something
else, however *blush*

Anything that you want to see covered that hasn't been offered yet?

I'd like more info about 1.5.  Tips and Tricks.  Hacking extensions.

On another subject, is it possible to get a meeting room that has web conferencing for people who are not able to be there in person?

Also, we had discussed having a show-and-tell, maybe 3-5 minutes per person for whoever wants to participate.

I've been looking into the webcasting idea, and right now the problem is bandwidth (we don't have enough of it)... If we can get access to a connection on a laptop, I'd be more than happy to setup a video server for it, but as of now, there's nothing fast enough for it...

Did someone mention using Google's offices for the meetings?  I'm sure they would have web conferencing facilities as well as wifi.

I tried to get us in there, but it didn't happen. One silly idea I had
was to move us to an Apple Store, as they have excellent presentation
facilities, as long as you present on a Mac ;-)

Seriously though, we do need to find a bandwidth solution, as that is
an increasingly inconvenient problem.

Ok, so we have questions about 1.5, and some show-and-tell sessions.
Any other topics of interest?

Is meeting in NYC a requirement? I know in Jersey there are a bunch of 
Panera Bread stores with free wifi and they all seem to have a separate 
"meeting room" style area which could seat about 30 people.

NYC is the best (as it's easy to get to by train)... It's central for a lot of us too (There are only a few of us from Jersey, but a lot of us from the east side of NYC)...

I don't go to New Jersey.  ;-)

If the meeting place were to be moved out of state, not to mention out of the city, then it would not be the "NYC Joomla Users Group", it would the "[fill-in-the-blank] Joomla Users Group".  ;-)

Speaking of which, whatever happened to Joomla Cities?

Why are there two boxes for name and two boxes for email on the 
registration page? It wasn't clear to me whether they were extra boxes 
for registering a second person, or just duplicate "verification" fields.

NYC is definately best...it gets me to get into manhattan once in a while, which is a good thing.
&nbsp;
Speaking of Panera, if they really have 'meeting roooms', and I know they have wifi...isn't there one in NYC?
&nbsp;
We can discuss at this week's meeting, maybe brainstorm different locations.

I work in Times Square but live in Brooklyn (Bay Ridge). So NJ is a
major hassle for me *sniff*

That is an excellent idea Laura, we do need to figure out what we're
going to do as a group - where, how, etc.

I like the web conferencing idea! If it isn't doable, at least for  
now, I think it would be very helpful to have the presentations  
recorded on video and made available to be streamed in an archive. Of  
course, with the permission of the presenter.

I'd much prefer that over passing around my presentations. A LOT of
what I say and cover when presenting is not in the slides, and the
slides are usually just reminders for me to cover certain topics. So
my presentation slides on their own have little value, despite
everyone always asking for them.

I've seen mashups where you see the video of the presenter on one side
of the screen, and the slides on the other. Would love to figure out
how that is done.

There's a free web conferencing app from zoho (www.zohom.com). It's like 
webex, but free. Combine that with a skype conference and I think that's 
all you'll need. There does not appear to be a feature in there to 
record the conference though. If I come down to the meeting tomorrow, 
I'll bring a mini hi-def cam to record the meeting. If someone has a 
minidisc recorder it would provide a better soundtrack than the tiny mic 
on the cam.

I just signed up for a slideshare account, and will re-record the
audio part when I upload the presentation. Basically, I can present
"in person" at the meet, and can then re-record the talking part
(without audience comments) for online consumption. I don't think live
audio and the inevitable "wait, lemme show you something real quick"
moments will translate well in that medium, so I can just whip out
Logic Pro - overkill, admittedly - and reperform the talk part, match
it up to the slides, and *boom* as Steve Jobs would say.

Until we find a place with bandwidth, I don't think the live streaming
thing is feasible.

Just a thought on that, I did a web cast using a screen capture/audio program.  So I can talk and it records my screen in the same shot.  Not great for recording a live presentation, but definately good for a webcast type thing (http://www.joomlaperformance.com/articles/webcasts/why_mod_php_is_bad_for_performance_52_58.html)...

I personally Like the divergances/crowd reaction when watching a video like this... (Granted, it can be quite long)...

Message-ID: <711398.16552.qm@web35604.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

We were unable to gain access to Robert Half's office due to an administrative snafu, so we walked over to Bryant Park and had our meeting al fresco and with free Wi-Fi!  The weather was perfect for an outdoor meeting, and we snacked on $8 blue corn chips and chocolate rugala.  :-)

It was decided to skip the month of July for a summer break and have our next meeting in August.

Marian, Laura and I will be working on a template for the NYC JUG.  Mitch will look into finding a new home for us.  That's all I can remember.  If anyone has more information about what we discussed last night, please feel free to add to this.

Thanks all!  I enjoyed our meeting.

First off, the chips were excellent. Blue corn, thin, and crispy.
Generous, large bag too.

Perhaps the most pertinent topic was how to make this user group more
organized, more efficient, and provide more value to its members and
the Joomla community in general. There are tons of ideas, some of them
months-to-years old, and simply haven't been acted on. I'm putting a
focused effort personally to get some of these loose ends wrapped up,
so we can really focus on the important stuff (making awesome talks
and sharing a lot of knowledge) as opposed to less-than-fun stuff
(attending meetings, getting past the goon squad). Glad to see
everyone else stepping up and volunteering to tackle some tasks to
make this group the best it can be. Group hug!

The meet was wonderful outside, and I enjoyed it immensely.

Are comments on the nycjoomla page being moderated?

Because I added a comment when we got to Bryant park, in case anyone needed
to know what happened and where we were, and the comment seemed to go
through.

However I noticed it's not actually there.

I think it was mentioned for the website:

member profiles
help / how-to topics

============

It should be noted that Robert Half has been very gracious in allowing
NYCJUG to meet in its facilities. Also, the building security staff has
always been courteous and accomodating, as far as I know. The security
snafu of the other night was inconvenient, but the staff does have
strict rules which they must abide or risk losing their employment, and
these are uncertain times. If the security measures are too much for us
to cope with, then another space is certainly in order, but we should be
grateful for that generosity which we have been shown.

Yes, I too find the scraps they throw to us to be delicious, arf arf!!

But seriously, I would give them 'cordial'  but let's face it, RH is a
staffing company, they are looking for bodies to place, and it's in their
interest to have user groups meet there to get some fresh meat.

Until I know exactly where the ball was dropped I certainly can't rule out
that it was actually just due to outright neglect on their part, based on us
not having a packed room of potential job takers. So I'm not going to give
them 'gracious', at least not for nothing.

That doesn't mean I'm not grateful, however; in fact I am. I understand it's
not always easy for groups to find places to meet. I just wanted to draw the
distinction between being 'grateful' and blindly crediting them with such
beneficence.

In general I take a more programmatic approach to things, and when my code
throws an error, it does me very little good to "try to be understanding",
however finding out what when wrong and how tends to keep the same error
from happening again.

Or maybe I'm just being too logical....

cheers,

Forest

I will chime in, I guess we just have to focus on getting a new home for the joomla nyc group.
?
Although we can be gracious, I personally think it is unacceptable for a company to volunteer to host a meeting, and not to have a person from their organization available just to let us in at the door.??If there was a rep. from RH available at 6:30, we would have all been able to get in, that was all that was needed.
?
Hopefully we will find a new home for our next meeting for 8/14.
?
But, I must add that the out door joomla brain session was great!? The chips were great too!!!? Light and crispy!

Subject: [joomla] Is this a php issue?
Message-ID: <503124.225.qm@web35604.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I was having a problem with Virtuemart's Latest Products module.  It was stripping the dollar sign as well as the dollar amount, and showing just the decimal point and cents.

After spending the day (!) debugging this, I finally found the problem.

In class_currency_display.php, in the function getFullValue, in the assignment of $res, where the current var values are $res = 10.99 and $this->symbol = "$":

[code]$res=$this->symbol.$res;[/code]

for some reason $res ends up being ".99", missing the $ as well as the "10".  (It should have read "$10.99")

When I changed the code to read:

[code]$res = $this->symbol . " " . $res;[/code]

it now displays correctly as "$10.99".

Is this a problem with my php version or the php settings on the server?

Apparently I'm the only one experiencing this problem.  I did not see any posts on Virtuemart from anyone else having this issue.

I am using Fireboard for a group that has 20 separate committees. Each
committee would like their own PRIVATE forum. I can't find a way to do this
with Fireboard, and GroupJive and JACL don't seem to solve the problem
according to the Fireboard forums.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

Hi gang,

As discussed at last meeting, I setup an area at KickApps where we can
all kick the tires and play around with the platform. Maybe this is
something that we can use, maybe it isn't suitable for what we want to
do.

However I don't want to be the one man testing team! ;-)

http://affiliate.kickapps.com/kickapps/service/displayHomePageExperience.kickAction?page=Homepage

Signup, I'm going to create a group called New York for some strange
reason. Already launched a board, and would love you all to sign up
and upload pictures, audio, whatever you got from NYCJUG meetings and
whatnot.

Hi Mitch,
   I clicked on the link and encountered an error...?

   Still waiting for confirmation on where we will be tomorrow/Sunday.

   See you then!!

D'oh! Looks like javascript masked the URL I was wanting to type, and
I didn't notice. Here's the correct link:

    http://www.kickapps.com/JoomlaCities

Looking for remote blogs from JCNYC members, any media (please!) and
also scrambling for a place this weekend.

KickApps can't host us as they didn't have enough lead time - and that
is totally my fault. Sorry folks. So we're scrambling to find a venue
that we can use. I also just learned of some family issues that will
keep me from attending this weekend :-(

I've created a group called New York, and uploaded the three photos of
the J!Day East 2007 from the joomlanyc.org website just to play with
the photo tools. Trying to get the video of my interview in the
Netherlands, would like to put up some movies and so on.

Some of you have photos of us, I just know it! Come on, there's a
group upload feature ;-)

Should we meet in Bryant Park again? ;-)  That would actually be a great place because we'd be outdoors, have wi-fi, etc.  We just need someone to bring a generator so we can charge our batteries.  Anyone have a solar panel?  ;-)

Is anyone actually going to go to this?

Mitch is not going. Anthony is not going. The logisitcs are tortured.

I don't really want to bike all the way down there and be the only one who
shows up.

And now I notice the location update is only going to 5 people? HUH?

Well, I'll be there anyway....

cheers,

The event will be held at the WinterGarden, in lower
Manhattan.  To get there, go to the World Financial Center,
and follow the signs for WinterGarden.  We'll be getting
started around 9:30 to 10:00 on Saturday.  Elin Warrin will
be coordinating the NYC event.  People will be in front of
the Gap.

We'll be using IRC throughout the day, so if you need
anything (and arn't with the group), you can try #joomlapbf on freenode.net.

Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend
Saturday's function.  If there are any issues at all, you can
call me at (908) 938 0042.  I'll be online until about 10am
tomorrow, so you can find me here as well.
