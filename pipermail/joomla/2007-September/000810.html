  If you do a presentation on Community Builder, don't you need as well:
  CBJuice: a great product to import user records into community builder
  JACL Plus: I think that is it, to actually work with groups, etc. 
   
  At another section you may want to focus on shopping carts, such as VirtueMart, which is fantastic!

  From October onwards, out meeting date is now the second thursday of 
the month.

Date:
October 11th
6PM to 8PM

Location:
Robert Half Technology
245 Park Avenue, 25th Fl.
46th - 47th St.
(near grand central)

We have room for 50 people. People will need to RSVP in advance so we 
have a list for security, and you will need some form of photo id onhand 
for security.

We will be setting up a website and an RSVP form over the weekend, for 
now you can simply email me your RSVP and I'll manually add you to the list.

Schedule:
Our last meeting was a long presentation about Joomla in general. So 
this time around, I'd like to aim to have a number of quick 
presentations and we can alternate meetings going forward(big 
presentations followed by short presentations, etc). We will aim for 4 
small presentations, with the first 2 being geared for a more user 
level, and the last 2 for developers. Anyone who willing to do a short 
15-20 minute presentation, please contact me.

Therefore, our schedule will be:
Session 1: 6:00-6:20 - Community Builder, what it is and what it is not
Session 2: 6:20-6:40

JUG/SIG Planning: 6:45-7:15.
To discuss: Community Website plans and needs
Community Projects

Session 3: 7:20-7:40
Session 4: 7:40-8:00


Presentations:
At the last meeting, I noticed some discussions on building a 
&quot;community&quot; website, and the component that get's mentioned frequently 
is Community Builder. Community Builder, by itself, doesn't provide 
much in the way of &quot;community&quot; features, but it is a strong basis for 
such websites. So I'd like to do a brief review of the features of CB 
to begin with, along with thoughts on what it allows you to do as far as 
community websites are concerned.
