<PRE>At the last meeting, we raised the issue of the meeting time as there 
were some unable to make the third thursday of the month.

As such, we decided on moving the meeting permanently to the second 
thursday of the month.

This means out next meeting will be on October 11th.

Meeting space wise, our first meeting overflowed the conference room by 
3 people, so we are looking into securing a permanent long term location 
with room to accomodate many more people(especially as the 11th meeting 
coincides with Joomla Day in NYC so we are expecting a greater number of 
people).

Sometime in the next few weeks we will be setting up a NYC Joomla 
SIG/JUG website.

A question was raised on whether or not there would be interest in doing 
some regionally team based projects.  We could get together for a day, 
or organize online, and work on components, extensions, non profit 
sites,  etc as a team - letting new Joomla developers learn the ropes 
from some experienced developers, giving Joomla users a chance to 
influence the direction of projects they use, and hopefully getting some 
people to provide documentation. :-)

There are plenty of minor projects I can come up with off the top of my 
head(and I'm not an old Joomla hand!) that we could do as a group just 
for experience and credit(taking stalled Joomla 1.0 components that are 
in use and updating them to 1.5, documenting them, and providing minor 
enhancements.  As a simple example, there is a popular banner module for 
Joomla made by JoomProd which is badly in need of a few minor tweaks.  
Combining this with a rewrite into the Joomla 1.5 way of doing things 
could be a fun way to kill an afternoon as well as learning from others.)

It would be nice to do some major projects for bragging rights for the 
City, but I figure we could start on some minor ones to get a handle on 
who likes doing what, and go from there(and we could even insist on 
doing things write and build out unit tests for all our components so 
going forward they become easier to maintain).

So to sum up:
Next meeting October 11th
Where: TBD
Presentations: TBD
Discussion: Regional Projects
