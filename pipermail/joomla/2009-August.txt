They do not own it yet, but will own it soon. In speaking to the VP of 
product dev for Oracle on Demand he told me he could not comment on it. :)

Had never heard of this extension, looks like it does all I was trying
to do with the core:

    http://www.nonumber.nl/modulesanywhere

Basically you can include a module by name anywhere, not just content,
and not just by position.

Anybody using this, and what is your take?

Its a little editor-xtd button that sits at the bottom of your articles. 
Works well.

Its easier than {loadposition user1} which seems to confuse beginners.

Was led to believe it was a lot more than that though - should be able
to include a module by name, and not necessarily only in an article.

Yep, it comes with a system plugin too.

I think so long as you have an editor area, whether its an article, 
module, component, you can drop modules in.

I apologize in advance for this, I really do.

Having said that:

"Yo Dawg I heard you liked modules, so I put a module in your module, so
when you are displaying modules you can display modules that display
modules..."

cheers,

?orest

ps- on a serious note this module hasn't even been out a month and it
already has 28 great reviews on x.j.o., almost all of them 5 star, so though
I haven't got to try it yet, it sounds like the execution lives up to the
concept.

Hi folks!


I've seen an old tread about implementing Joomla with Postgre. I've already done this! If someone is looking for it, take a look at this link: "http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=304&t=413046&p=1807796"

Subject: [joomla] good contact / staff manager
Message-ID: <950310.23166.qm@web31812.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Can anyone recommend a good Contact Manager?

I need one with Captcha, a Form to fill out (instead of via email link), and a good text editing/viewing area for the person's bio...I want to use this for a staff of a synagogue, so the bios of the staff is in the same place as the contact info for that staff member...seems easy enough, right?

I have tried:
Core Contact
The misc. field doesn't display very nicely, there is no captcha by default...

QContact
Pros: has captcha, form, custom fields
Cons: The 'misc.' field or where I would put the bio looks awful...

QPersonnel
This looks GREAT, but the cons is that there is no form (just a link to an email address).

I will only have about 3 categories, each having 5-10 entries, so I don't need a tool as robust as mosetstree...or something like that...I think the combination of QPersonnel along with QContact would be perfect...any ideas?

Thanks,
Laura

I had some difficulty with the media manager in version 1.5.13. Appears
it is broken. Upgrade to 1.5.14 to fix the issues.

Also having trouble with media manager with one of my computers. file

Hi Laura,

 

Try Contact Enhanced at
http://ideal.fok.com.br/joomla/extensions/component-contact-enhanced.html

 

It works and looks just like the core Contact component but it has the
captcha and you can add custom fields.

 

Sincerely,

I need one with Captcha, a Form to fill out (instead of via email link), and
a good text editing/viewing area for the person's bio...I want to use this
for a staff of a synagogue, so the bios of the staff is in the same place as
the contact info for that staff member...seems easy enough, right?

I have tried:
Core Contact
The misc. field doesn't display very nicely, there is no captcha by
default...

QContact
Pros: has captcha, form, custom fields
Cons: The 'misc.' field or where I would put the bio looks awful...

QPersonnel
This looks GREAT, but the cons is that there is no form (just a link to an
email address).

I will only have about 3 categories, each having 5-10 entries, so I don't
need a tool as robust as mosetstree...or something like that...I think the
combination of QPersonnel along with QContact would be perfect...any ideas?

Thanks,
Laura

Sounds cool, especially for demos and whatnot.

If it was in the budget we could have a set number of these pre-made
to giveaway. Maybe part of a raffle of some sort, or perhaps a
surprise gift to folks attending the "welcome to joomla" session?

Message-ID: <638110.98034.qm@web31808.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I hate to do this, but I am desperate...

Initially I had a client on 1.5.11 (I know bad)...

the only component running on this system is Ambra Subscriptions, it is a pretty clean system.

Today, when no one was doing anything, the menus just disappeared...

Backend:
Menu manager --> no menus listed
module and plugin manager ---> items are listed, but the published/enabled column is blank

Database:
The menu records are THERE, and they look fine (published, etc...)
The module records are there and they look fine

I upgraded from 1.5.11 ---> 1.5.14 and still no luck.

Any ideas?  I really don't want to have to reinstall all of joomla...there must be another way...

Please email as my client's system is down, until I can solve this!!!

thanks,
Laura

I would manually uninstall Ambra and see if that helps.

Yeah, I'm using a Yootheme template also.  I think it has something to do with that.

Look for a single quote in one of the text fields of the menu's.  Chances
are that it is blocking that query.

Quickest solution is to export all tables relating to menu's to CSV files
and do a global find for the single quote and the semi colon charector.  If
you find those, manually edit those records and remove them.

Shotgun approach to solving the problem.

Or take a blunderbus approach, export all the menu tables to CSV files and
then truncate/delete all the records and create a new menu with only one
item, then try loading that new menu.  If THAT works than you know for 99%
sure the issue is corruption in the database and you can import the data
back in line by line till you find the break[there should not be TOO many
menu items].

Third solution, enable a different template not from yoo-templates and see
if that works.  It is also within the realm of possibility that there is
something funky in their javascript/css menu drop down effects that is
causing the problem.

I checked that site using Firefox on a linux system, and the menus
appear to be there and work alright. That's Firefox.

Are you using Internet Destroyer 8 by any chance?

Message-ID: <694324.40468.qm@web35308.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi 
I have a site melanomapictures.org that was listed as #8 on google search. On monday, I added 30 articles to the melanomapictures.org from my other site. Now, I discover google droped my listing to #300 in just 2 days. 

How did this happen? Does google think I "stole" the contents from someone else? If so, how can I fix this? 

many thanks
Steve

Hi Steve,

I'm not an SEO expert but have learned over the years that content
that is presented in identical fashion on two sites is a bad thing,
and that the second website indexed will be punished for it.

The thinking is that some folks tried to game the system by making
thousands of identical websites with identical content, in order to
overload the top of the list for their chosen keywords. Their plan was
to make sure ALL links on the first page went to one of their
websites, even if all of them were the same.

I'd reconsider republishing content from one site to another - or move
the content from one to the other before the next index from
googlebot.

Maybe another Steve from Atlanta would like to weigh in?

*allegedly* Google have told us there is no longer a "duplicate content
penalty"

But, Google might consider your other site with the same content the "real"
one. Has that lost any position?

No, the other site has not lost any position. This is what I did so far. I removed all the articles from the other site. So the contents will only show up in melanomapictures.org. I hope google's robot will search both sites soon.

Changed the site on Monday and dropped like a rock on Tuesday?

That's likely to just be co-incidence. Not even Google moves that fast 98%
of the time.

That kind of movement sounds like you have a relatively new site ... is that
true?

Steve

Absolutely. New sites shoot up and down the rankings like a yo-yo.

Then for a few months to a year they're often in a "sandbox":
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_Effect

If your site has a large % of content that's appeared previously on other
sites, then you might be stuck in that sandbox for longer.

Subject: [joomla] joomla on a stick
Message-ID: <1250989199.6513.58.camel@jersey>

Just went through and configured a usb stick with server2go and joomla.

Found out that it is available as joomlas2go already done.

Not too hard to do. You have to hunt around to find php.ini to turn off
register globals and error reporting. It's not all that fast. Shared
hosting seems faster (go figure).

We can get 2 gb sticks for around $6. We can have them imprinted for an
extra charge.

I'd like to replace the server2go splash screen with JoomlaNYC logo if
we use these.

Also would like to include a folder with some templates and components
so that we could cover installing extensions.

If anyone has any suggestions for templates and extensions to include on
it, I'll put them on and bring it to next JUG meeting so we can decide
if we want to distribute these at any of the sessions.

I've zipped up the original install so I can monkey with this one. We
can use the original install zip file as a basis for making a bunch for
JoomlaDayNYC if it goes that way.

Hi Mark

We run server2go with Joomla and Portable Firefox for our training classes,
so if you need any help, let us know.

Might be worth paying a few extra cents to get them pre-loaded also. Those
are some large files to have to load manually onto 100 flash drives.

Hi
Has anyone used the new template --afterburner from rocketTheme? I tried to switch the logo image with one of my own image. This is what I have tried: I upload a new image file and rename it as light4.png (this is the css format I use). it did not work. any idea?

many thanks
Steve

in light4.css on line 55 (#logo) get rid of the -272px.  It is moving the image out of the visible area.  you will see part of the image, but it doesn't fit in the div.  You'll have to change the height also.

Sure, I put it up on our website here:

Couple of tweaks are documented, otherwise it has the annoying habit of
deleting the joomla database.

HI 
Is there a way to automatically push all the articles/blogs from a site to facebook/twitter/digg in an easy way? The only way I know is using the add this plugging, and manually do so for each of the social network sites.
thanks

I'd probably want to do this manually, I often find I need to tweak text to
fit the 140 chars of twitter...

There are products out there that send RSS feeds to twitter (you've probably
seen them clogging up popular hashtags). Can come across as spammy, but it
works.

http://www.google.com/search?q=rss+to+twitter

Facebook will allow RSS too:

Digg is harder - they'll ban you pretty fast for automated submissions.

Steven,
That message frequently indicates you have to unzip before installing. The
zip file you downloaded may contain multiple zips for installation of
additional modules.

 Check the folder structure inside the zip file. Could be that it was
zipped up wrong. xml file will need to be in the base folder of the zip
file, so you may have to unzip it, remove one folder level, and rezip
the package.

Or, if there is no xml file, you may have to make one of your own. That
could be a bit involved, but not beyond your abilities, from what I've
seen. ;)

Or, if there is no xml file, you could do a manual install of the
package. That also is a bit involved but you are capable.

Subject: [joomla] instruction to hack?
Message-ID: <54507.82774.qm@web35307.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

HI 
I am successful in loading the virtumart. Thank you for everyone's help.

Now I am trying to get another component working. It is in a beta version now, and before it can work I need to perform 2 hacks.

1)
open the file ps_checkout.php, located at:
/your_site_root/administrator/components/com_virtuemart/classes/ps_checkout.php
Then add some code. 

2) Open the index.php of your Joomla! template probably located at:
/your_site_root/templates/your_default_template/index.php

My question is: Can I work this in joomla setting or do I have to use some other program (e.g., dreamweaver?) that can read/edit .php?

many thanks.

Two questions:

1) Where is the file you need to edit - are you already hosting the
stuff on a server, or is it running a local Joomla on your laptop?
2) If on your laptop, what operating system are you using?

You are up and hosted on 1&1, so you'll need to download the files to
local, change them, and upload them again to the right place.

I found that filezilla works fairly well for ftp. I have found, though,
that sometimes you have to actually delete the file on the server before
uploading the changed file. Strange behavior and I don't know if that
was a filezilla issue or a 1&1 issue.

What did you use to upload the files the first time

I only used the 1and1.com's upload feature.

Help please. I cannot add new article in the article manager section. When I click on the "New" to add a new article, there is no action.
