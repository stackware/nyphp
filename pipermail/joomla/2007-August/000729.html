I think the first need is to provide information for anyone wanting to
leverage 1.5 - as that appeals to a much broader audience.

&gt;<i> But outside of certain items, event driven systems are overblown and

</I>
*spacemonkey tries not to say something before he's ready

&gt;<i> I think 1.5 brings a lot to the table, but I'm not gonna wait for them

</I>
Hmm, no idea who those annoyed folks could be. (whistle)

&gt;<i> What I do find amusing though is I keep seeing 'that's on the table for
</I>&gt;<i> 1.6&quot; for ideas I'm looking to do in 1.0.  Ain't gonna wait for them to
</I>&gt;<i> get that finalized either.  I'll do my own thing and than play catch up
</I>&gt;<i> when their ready(and of course their free to take my thing and polish it
</I>&gt;<i> up and make it 1.5 compliant and turn my code into decent code if they want)
</I>
I cannot talk for the folks working on the 1.6 series, but I hear the
extended ACL is already in a waiting state for 1.5 to get finished.
I'm personally working on PDO integration and as soon as that is done
we can support multiple databases - even if it is not added to the
core for the 1.5 series.

Just having an error class makes me drool. Think about integrating
Joomla with systems management tools, so Joomla can send a message to
your management console &quot;Hey man, somebody broke this menu link...&quot;
Nice.
