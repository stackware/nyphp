Ever wonder just how the Joomla Plugin system works?  Why some things 
that sound really hard to do are easy, yet other things sound simple 
require pretzel coding?

I'm in the process of setting up my own personal website, so I've been 
posting some articles on Joomla coding.  One of them is an attempt to be 
humorous and describe the process in "real life" terms.

Chapter one is Dippy the Dispatcher and is available for your reading 
pleasure:

Subject: [joomla] Crafty Preview Package
Message-ID: <11000867.Array.20130102190257.50e4846105b831.92887073@mail101.us4.mandrillapp.com>


I've got a second release of my Preview Package of enhancements for Joomla.

Note, the Preview Package is a bunch of different items.
It's all on my website http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=11000867&id=f5dacb7cb485403e9ae34675d0ca7c79&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgary.mort.net%2F&url_id=314d64822e2519d31f0aa0986285c242b2ab0d73&tags=_all,_sendjoomla+2012 at gary.mort.net

This package includes the nifty, fun Raptor Editor plugin.   Raptor is 
an HTML5 Editor that uses a top of the screen toolbar rather than 
embedded in the middle.  It also gives you a better preview of what your 
content will look like since it displays it to you in an editable div - 
not a textarea.

Also just because I had it lying around, I stuck a syslog plugin in 
which redirects your log data to an external server.  This will redirect 
your Joomla! logs to a Syslog server.  I always find it a pain to try to 
track down where and how someone broke into a site because the ones 
breaking in erase logfiles.  By logging everything on an external server 
they can't do that!   This way I have an audit log of everything.   
Another added plus is that during development I can keep a second web 
browser open and see all the log entrees, profile messages, etc as they 
occur.  For that, I subscribe toPapertrail 
<https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=2f2756>  While I COULD setup my own 
rsyslog server and all, Papertrail makes it easy.  Most sites will 
probably be in the free category of usage even with maximum logging.  If 
not, I highly recommend upgrading the account - the peace of mind in 
knowing my logs are safe is enormousness.

And for Developers, there is the second release of my JProfile 
enhancements.
By changing JEventDispatcher I've added the following log lines:


Application 0.003 seconds (+0.003); 1.00 MB (+0.359) - 
onCreateEvent:onAfterSessionStart

Tracks when a plugin event was created(ie the plugin helper imports 
plugins in a group) -this allows you to see ALL Joomla Plugin events 
with listeners regardless of whether or not there is a listener for it.

Application 0.003 seconds (+0.000); 1.00 MB (+0.002) - 
onAttachTo:onAfterSessionStart::By:Object::JSite

And here you get some tracking data on who is listening for an event to 
happen.  onAttatchis not an event, but the PluginHelper attaching a 
listener to the dispatcher.  onAfterSessionStart is the event being 
listened for.  It was attached by the JSite object -NOT A PLUGIN.  The 
Application object($application = JFactory->getApplication()) is 
listening DIRECTLY to the event.  Plugins are not the only objects which 
can listen for events.


Application 0.059 seconds (+0.056); 1.17 MB (+0.172) - 
onTriggerStart_onAfterSessionStart
Application 0.059 seconds (+0.000); 1.18 MB (+0.007) - 
onTriggerFunction_JSite::000000002d4d802d00000000715c9f1a
Application 0.060 seconds (+0.000); 1.19 MB (+0.006) - 
onTriggerDone_onaftersessionstart


Here you see the time when the onAfterSessionStart is triggered, time 
each listener for the event is executed, and when they have all 
completed.  Makes it soooo much easier to track down a performance 
hogging plugin.  One tester reported that he was able to pinpoint a LESS 
css compiler plugin as the source of a 3 second delay on page load!

Fun stuff.

Subject: [joomla] looking for Joomla consultant
Message-ID: <CAKV3MYFBikEcC+jAvJ=ddgW+x_q393ppDoAmuWMN3Y9HR1Z_HA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all

Looking for a Joomla consultant to do the following project, there will
likely be other work over the long-term.  I developed the site and will
coordinate as technical liaison for the business side.  I do have a VPS
account with the same hosting company hostv, so can offer that as a sandbox
environment for development and testing)

site: www.koreanamericanstory.org, Joomla 1.5.0.26, HwdVideoshare 2.2.3
problem: videos published with hwdvideoshare are using Flash player, need
to migrate to HwdMediashare which can play videos via HTML5.
suggested steps:
- Backup and deploy the production KAS site to a dev server
- Upgrade backup from Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 2.5
- Deploy updated version of JA Purity template from Joomlart  (what KAS is
currently using) and customize to match current branding
- Install HWDMediashare component
- Migrate content from HWDVideoshare to HWDMediashare
- Deploy dev instance to production server.
- Uninstall HWDVideoshare

If interested, please send an email to mail at jigsaw-website.com with the
below, and I'll either drop you an email or we'll follow-up with a call.
- your contact details (name, phone, email address)
- estimate of project fees and duration, including QA and signoff from site
owner
- brief description/urls of past experience with Joomla 2.5, HwdMediashare,
(both preferred)
- any questions you may have.

Target timeline for completion is two weeks.  Preference is for someone
based in NY/CT/NJ, but other locations also considered.

Thanks

Hello Janice,

 

I took a peek at your website - looks wonderful!!

 

I'm a newbie with both Artisteer and Joomla. I am a small business owner -
telecommunications - and want to design my own website. I am almost 50%
completed with my Joomla site, and decided to use Artisteer to customize the
look.

 

This is what I'm running into;

 

1.	I designed the "content" page area (homepage).
2.	Imported Artisteer file with content.
3.	Template manager -assigned artisteer template.
4.	Home Page - assigned my articles to Featured Articles.
5.	When I visit my home page my featured articles do not display (in
content area) with artisteer design I made.
6.	Other areas, such as menus do display as I designed them.

 

:-(

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Thanks for the feedback, Marcos. J



Here?s what you need to do to get your content imported from Artisteer:



1.       In the Administrator area  of your site, go to the template
manager (*Extensions?Template Manager*)

2.       Click on your template name to edit the Artisteer template.

3.       On the right side, under Basic Options, click the ?*Import Content
from Template*? button.

4.       You?ll get a warning message that says:
 *This option will import articles, extensions and menus, and will create a
new homepage.
Note: Previously imported content will be replaced, therefore please back
it up if required.*

5.       Click the *Import* button to start the import.

6.       Once it?s complete you?ll get the message ?*Content is installed
successfully*.?

7.       Click *Continue* button.

8.       Click *Save & Close* button.



That?s it!  Let me know how it works out.



Sincerely,

Subject: [joomla] Content restriction question
Message-ID: <1655DC29-6FED-4176-B4A4-D87343672578@whyknott.com>

Hello Everyone,
I have a client who would like to restrict access to a (Joomla Article page) that houses Special Offer Coupons. BUT they would like the user to opt-in to an email list AND Like them on facebook BEFORE they are provided access to the specials on the article page. I'lm unsure of the best way to do this. I found this really awesome Extension but its focused only on Facebook and not the email as well. 
http://joomla.alterora.gr/en/joomla-extensions/facebook-page-fans-only/download

This is an urgent project, the client wants this done as soon as possible so any kind advice or recommendations would be great!

Thanks,
Kenny

You might be able to use CommunityBuilder or JoomSocial to have them join a
group when they opt-in, and then that group has access to the page.

This is a VERY off-the-cuff idea, but from what I have seen on CB's
website, that may be what you're looking for.

I have a free plugin on my site called content access it allows you to
password protect a content article

http://ammonitenetworks.com/component/ars/repository/joomla-content-access

You could mode the plugin, to instead of requiring the username and
password from the plugin params you could have them enter an email,


and you could process the email to whatever database you want to store the
email.

Once they have done that you could use a service like http://pmints.com/

To allow you to sell your content for the price a facebook like or a
twitter tweet.

Hello

Thanks for the quick feedback, however, neither of those gets me what I'm looking for. It needs to be able to handle Constant Contact Sign up and a facebook like action from the same registration form then upon successful submission the user is redirected to the Special Offer Content Article Page.

Thanks,
Kenny

Kenny,
Hi, I remember way back either Steve Burge, or Rafael Diaz-Tushman had a
tool that requested an EMAIL ADDRESS to be entered before content could be
displayed...steve, was it you?

You need to have Joomla connect to ConstantContact via their API to determine if they are on your email list: http://community.constantcontact.com/t5/Documentation/Searching-for-a-Contact-by-Email-Address/ba-p/25123.

I doubt there's something already coded for that.? You would need to have someone code it for you.

Hello

Thanks for the quick feedback, however, neither of those gets me what I'm looking for. It needs to be able to handle Constant Contact Sign up and a facebook like action from the same registration form then upon successful submission the user is redirected to the Special Offer Content Article Page.

Thanks,
Kenny

Sounds like either will work some what,  but what you want is a custom
situation, so sounds like you are going to need to write some code.

Anyone know a good way to implement google analytics on your joomla site?
I'm fairly new to using google analytics, so i'm not sure if it would be
through extension.

thanks,
Todd

One of the simplest ways to do it is to copy/paste the provided code into a

Thanks Matt,

I was reading the google analytics instructions and it said that the code
should be put in the head section.  I create my own templates so that
shouldn't be a problem. However i've never put a module postion in the head
content. Will that work?

Hi Matt,

It's not a good idea to put it in your site's head.

The reason being, if Google Analytics doesn't load, nothing on your site
will load.

If it's in the footer, and Google Analytics doesn't load, the majority of
your site will still load.

Steve

I think you should just use any of the many plugins, but I would use a
plugin and not a module because it puts it in a better place on the page
via plugins

Todd,

Yes, exactly. If you are creating your own template, you can create a
module position anywhere on the page, even in the head or before the
closing body tag, for this module. I prefer to put it just before the
closing body tag (i.e.
https://github.com/construct-framework/construct5/blob/master/index.php#L472)
Like
others have suggested, you can also use a plugin. There are many ways to
accomplish it.

Best,

I'm working on a documentation site that contains a large number of pages
and processes.  A user asked if it was possible to "pin" or "favorite"
specific pages, so that when they came back a month later to run the same
process, it was easy to find.

I've found a couple of modules that do this, but they all have the same
drawback - the module needs to be displayed on the page, both to "mark" it,
and to retrieve the list.  Because this is a documentation site, we're
trying to keep clutter to a minimum.

In an ideal setup, the ability to "mark" a page would be an action icon
along with Edit, Print, or Email - the listing of your faves would be a
page you could get to from your profile or a menu.

Has anyone seen a system like this for Joomla?

Yes - the majority of them are modules, which is what we're trying to
avoid.  They will only work if the module itself is displaying on the page,
and they take up more screen space than we'd like.

Message-ID: <FCCFCED3-0DF9-4565-9146-B8EE2C16F9E1@whyknott.com>

Hello Everyone,

I just upgraded from Joomla 1.7 to 2.5.8 (on a windows server environment) and did it through the Joomla Extensions Manager like documented. Purged cache, found the upgrade and then performed the update.
As soon as the update was finished I received this boat-load of "Failed Deleting" and "Error on deleting file or folder" messages from right within the extension manager area. The Upgrade was successful however with no problems.
I don't see or have experience any errors so far? I'm thinking maybe the Upgrade package didn't have the proper permissions to remove those files and folders automatically??? So I'm going to speak with my Host and get their opinion.

Attached are screen shots of the error

Hi Janice,

 

I did all the items you mentioned. Still not seeing what I think I should be
seeing. Maybe Artisteer doesn't do what I'm looking for? 

 

Here is what I'm getting after import.

 

1.	I do see the home page (which is content area in Artisteer) Ok for
that.
2.	I also see background, menus, and color choices I made. 
3.	"Content area" Is displaying the "dummy" content I inserted for test
purposes.
4.	Here is the issue > I'm thinking that after import I should be able
to "Feature" my own articles in content area. And they should display as I
designed.    
5.	Content area as displayed is a single article titled "Home" which
artisteer imports.
6.	Somehow I cannot display my own featured articles in the home page
(artisteer content area)
7.	Am I climbing up the wrong tree here?

Thanks for the feedback, Marcos. :-)

 

Here's what you need to do to get your content imported from Artisteer:

 

1.       In the Administrator area  of your site, go to the template manager
(Extensions.Template Manager)

2.       Click on your template name to edit the Artisteer template.

3.       On the right side, under Basic Options, click the "Import Content
from Template" button.

4.       You'll get a warning message that says: 
 This option will import articles, extensions and menus, and will create a
new homepage.
Note: Previously imported content will be replaced, therefore please back it
up if required.

5.       Click the Import button to start the import.

6.       Once it's complete you'll get the message "Content is installed
successfully."

7.       Click Continue button.

8.       Click Save & Close button.

 

That's it!  Let me know how it works out.

 

Sincerely,

Hello Janice,

 

I took a peek at your website - looks wonderful!!

 

I'm a newbie with both Artisteer and Joomla. I am a small business owner -
telecommunications - and want to design my own website. I am almost 50%
completed with my Joomla site, and decided to use Artisteer to customize the
look.

 

This is what I'm running into;

 

1.	I designed the "content" page area (homepage).
2.	Imported Artisteer file with content.
3.	Template manager -assigned artisteer template.
4.	Home Page - assigned my articles to Featured Articles.
5.	When I visit my home page my featured articles do not display (in
content area) with artisteer design I made.
6.	Other areas, such as menus do display as I designed them.

 

:-(

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda
