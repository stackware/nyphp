Subject: [joomla] reconnect to mysql database
Message-ID: <ECE40B83-6073-445A-BFA5-2648BE7770CD@upshotmagazine.com>

Hello,
I am trying to connect a new joomla installation to the mysql database of a previous install.
The install was successful but i don't see any of the original data after.
I even dragged content (i.e.- components, images, modules, plugins, admin, etc.) from the previous install via ftp and none of it shows up.
Does anyone know how to connect to the content in the previous installs mysql database?
Thanks,
Paul

In "configuration.php", you can set the db name, db password and db username.  
Set it to the database used for the previous install, assuming you still have 
that info.  That info would be in the configuration.php file of the previous 
install.

If you don't have that info, you can open your webhosting control panel and 
create another username and password for that database.

Hi Donna,
I do still have the database used for the previous install.
The new install is set to it in configuration.php
The problem is that i still don't see any of the previous database information on the new site.

Where are you not seeing the old data, in the admin, on the public facing side?  
When you go into the list of articles in admin, do you see the old articles?  
Are you using a different template with a different layout?

Try this:

1. Do a clean install of Joomla (no sample data)
2. In PHPMyAdmin control panel, choose the database this new install is
using
3. Go to the IMPORT tab, choose your previous database and upload it
4. That should do the trick! Previous members and passwords wil be there, as
well as all the rest of the content.

Isn't there a debugger that can be turned on that displays the sql query

I'm browsing bak_users in phpadmin, all i see is the super admin.
When i first started working on this a few days ago, i did a new install and assigned it to the previous mysql database during install.
Could that have erased any of the data?

Can you export the previous database again through PHPMyAdmin using REPLACE

If you can't see the data in PHPAdmin than the data was not imported properly.

Tell me more... Is this website on a different server from the old one?

If you moved the site to a different server: How did you export the
database from the previous server and how did you import it into the
new one?

Paul. Please tell me what you are trying to do? Choose A or B or is it
something else?

A) Are you moving the Joomla website from one server to another server?

B) Is the Joomla site on the same server and you moved it to a
different part of the server or did you delete the old Joomla site and
reinstalled a new one?

I am assuming that you are trying to do A. If that is the case, here
is a tutorial that worked for me. It's old, but PHPMyAdmin hasn't
changed much in the past four years.

Paul,
Are they the same version of Joomla?
Do a fresh install with sample data. This way you know that install works.
Install the template you want.
Download the new configuration.php
Create a new empty DB
Upload the old db to this new DB
Change the configuration.php to match this new DB
That should work.
If not you have other issues. What type of hosting do you have?
If you look at the old db is the data there?
Scott Wolpow

Check the table names in the database. The default prefix is jos_. Every
table should have that prefix. Also check the configuration file to see
what prefix the installation is configured for. Adjust accordingly.

There's the problem. Your tables are using bak_ as a prefix. Make sure
that you set that in the configuration file. It's probably set to jos_.

The site was hacked and riddled with bad code that showed up on the front-end (the owner never changed their login info).
I proceeded to install a new instance with the latest version of Joomla (i did not throw away the old version).
I also set it up with the same mysql database.
When i opened the new install, i couldn't see any of the data in the admin or front-end.
Now that i am looking in phpadmin, i don't see any of his customers user info or any of his articles.

Paul,
Does the old DB have any data?
Or did you use it for the new install and choose the "install without 
sample data".
If so I think you may have lost the data.
Where do you host?

The DB does have most of the content.
However, i browsed bak_users in phpadmin and didnt see any other than the super admin.
I did use the DB for the new install with sample data installed (the first time).
This site is on Lunarpages.

Subject: [joomla] Sobi2 Google Maps
Message-ID: <4CAF65AD.6090505@wolpow.com>

Using Sobi2
My detail view is all custom. I want to place a link to google maps in 
that view
http://jfkenterprise.zoeticdev.com/index.php?option=com_sobi2&sobi2Task=sobi2Details&sobi2Id=224&Itemid=55

The only method I see forces me to put magic quotes to on, which of 
course I do not want to do.
I placed this code <?php HTML_SOBI::showGoogleMaps($mySobi, $config); ?> 
in the page and I have the back end for google set to on.
Yet I get nothing
Any Ideas

Here's two suggestions:

1. Put the SOBI code in a Custom HTML module. (Never tried this myself
but should work.)

2. Go to the Google Maps site and swipe the code and then put it in a
Custom HTML module. (Done this and it works.)

Subject: [joomla] Customizing a Registration Form
Message-ID: <489BC959-EE64-4DDD-88C8-50E93102387D@nutrigraphix.com>

What is the best way to extend the built in registration form? I am offering downloads, but am forcing users to register before they are able to download. Here is a list of what I would like to capture in that registration form:

- Additional information such as business name, position, etc.

- An option to join the newsletter

- A way to tie this form to the newsletter subscriber list

There are a lot Form Extensions out there, but it is confusing trying to chose one. I am combing form collection, user registration, and list management.  I am also not sure what extension to use for sending the emails. One configuration I looked at was RS Forms and RS Mail - it seems like they could work together to do what I need.

If someone has an idea for easing this kind of setup I would be appreciative.

Use RSForms Pro.  You can tie it into the User registration.

Another Option:

Use Qcontacts. This will let you add additional custom fields to
registration as well asa give you the added option of captcha in the
registration, then use JNews Extension for Newsletter. In JNews you can
specifiy that all new registered use get auotmatically added to a
Newsletter.

Thanks to you both for the suggestions. I used RS Forms Pro, it nicely remaps the fields to other tables when the form is submitted. It can also tie in with 3rd party mail services.

Greetings,

Does anyone have any experience with Regular Expressions?

I usually use very simple Regular Expressions for my work, however I've been
trying to create a plugin for my church's website that will link all bible
references to the bible extension that I have installed.
I've managed to match the bible references correctly, however it is also
matching non bible references too, because it is not matching whole words
only. For example, it matches *blahluke 1*.

I've tried to use the Word boundary *\b* and a Negative lookbehind for chars
*(?<![a-zA-Z])*, but they do not seem to work.

My REGEX:
preg_match_all('/(?<reference>(?<book>('.*$booksRegex*
.'))\s(?<chapter>[0-9]{1,3})(:|\.)?(?<versefrom>[0-9]{1,3})?(?<separator>[,-]+)?(?<verseto>[0-9]{1,3})?)?/i',$row->text,$matches);

Where *$booksRegex* is a PHP variable containing all bible books and
possible abbreviations in Portuguese:

Subject: [joomla] css issue
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=GcibeG8dvv27U0ykJyXo6GsBF6WP7Xk-8qLiV@mail.gmail.com>

This is mostly a css issue, but it is a Joomla site so it isn't
straight forward for me. It is a browser inconsistency, but i don't
know how to correct it and I was hoping someone can help. In Firefox,
it looks the way I want it to. In IE8, it is totally off. The link is
http://tinyurl.com/2b3v35z. The navigation should be to the left of,
but tucked under, the logo a bit, with the list going horizontally. In
IE it is vertically across, and the text is below instead of to the
left of the navigation.
When I strip out any Joomla code, the css works as expected in both Firefox
and IE !?!
An insight would be helpful.
Ellen

Ellen, how familiar are you with CSS? The behavior of IE browsers versus all others is very broad topic and does cause many inconsistencies. But in short you will need to edit your template's CSS file to fix the problems your are having - have you done that before?

Ted,
Thanks for responding. I am familiar with css and have edited the css files.
I couldn't understand why the edits I made weren't effective and thought
some fresh eyes  would help. Laura actually suggested that the images for
the menu  need dimensions, but i couldn't figure out how to add them since
you select the image from the menu item manager. (When I used only text for
the menu, it worked fine) After some trial and error, I did finally get it
to work!

Message-ID: <4CC6E839.5040209@wolpow.com>

Does any one know of a good document management system where users can 
upload files, and those files are automatically encrypted or otherwise 
protected. I am building a site for a law firm and want to offer the 
ability for their clients to upload files.
Those files are confidential and need to be unreadable to anyone without 
the propper password.

I'm using crupt() with CRYPT_SHA512 to accomplish this on one site of
mine right now:

And of course that would be crypt(), not crupt() which probably is
reserved for politicians.

Does anyone have experience using k2 and would be willing to visit us for a
bit of hands on tutorial? We are building a few sites using Joomla! here at
the UN and would like to gain from experience.
Let me know if you could join us for lunch and a work group session.

Thank you in advance - Bill

Hey that sounds fun what day are you thinking of doing this I would be interested in coming in tossing a few ideas around with the UN. 

I built a lot of joomla sites, and few K2 sites recently both are awesome.
