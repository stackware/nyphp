Subject: [joomla] Adding html to sidebar module
Message-ID: <BANLkTinJep6zoMB1TNA4kLG3iw8aOMd+6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I've made some good progress learning Joomla, but have hit another snag.
I'm trying to get html to show in a small module (in this case a better
business bureau link with logo), but it's doing one of two things.  If I put
the code directly into the modules content field, it simply just displays
the code on the page.  If I create an article and point it to that module,
it just has the articles title as a link, which then goes to a page that has
the code on it.

I did some searching and only found some extensions that said they could
allow this, but when I tried to install it, it gives me the 'cannot find
joomla xml setup file' message.  So then tried to find where to ftp it to,
but all the results kept coming up with other extensions to manage ftp
uploads to a Joomla site.  Where do extensions get uploaded to, and do I
even need an extension for this?

The link is www.thefinancefixer.com/joomla and it is the module on the right
side which says "BBB Link".

Thanks in advance,
Thad Jasonis

Ok I figured it out.  Just had to click the html link and then paste the
code in, then click update and it worked.

Thanks,

Subject: [joomla] Joomla NYC upcoming meetings - request for chairs
Message-ID: <BANLkTinjHGzc_jhQ=aMA1_pmU6VFQo-saA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

Hope everyone had a chance to enjoy the nice day.

The next Joomla meeting is scheduled a week from today at  6:30PM  Thursday
June 9th. It is being chaired by Fred Sullivan.

Also note that we are no longer meeting at Rose Hall, but across the street
(at 146 W. 65th Street) from Rose Hall. Better directions will
be posted later.

We are not looking for chairs to sit on, rather, we need folks to chair for
the next three meetings: July 14, August 11, September 8.

As most of you know, chairing a meeting is very easy. You need to find
Joomla presenters. You can present and/or you can find other presenters.
Topics can range from Joomla templates, module and component reviews,
how-to's, developer tips, site demonstrations, etc. I have found that it is
best to have three people to present, but one presenter with a great topic
can do a great job too.

The meetings run from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM and come hungry because our friends
at JoomlaTraining.com (also known as www.OSTraining.com) have been gracious
sponsors by providing us with a budget for snacks and food.

If you are interested in chairing a meeting, please contact me or post to
this list.

All the best,

Steve

Hi Thad

When adding HTML code to an article, you should enter HTML mode in your
editor. TinyMCE has a HTML button on its toolbar.

I suggest you install JCEditor, if you haven't. It's got some extra features
that are quite interesting.

Actually, with JCEditor all you'll have to do in your custom module is
upload the logo image you want, then apply the link. All this directly in
your article window.

Hope this helps,

What I need is a component that will allow the site to display the last 
10 uploads in two categories.
http://whisperingknoll.org/page/activities/events-calendar
http://whisperingknoll.org/page/activities/newsletter

Phoca Downloads as far as I can tell only has a link to the 
section/category or you can manually list each file.
http://wk.zoeticdev.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11&Itemid=18

Each month they will upload, from the back end two file sin each.


What component will do this?

I am looking for a photo gallery component. I would like each member to have a unique url to their page.
Is it easier just to give each member their own joomla instance ?

I have my own server so multiple instances are not an issue.

Thoughts ?

Hi Folks.

Anyone know of a Joomla extension that provides a client area to  
upload/download files? I'm picturing someone where the webmaster would  
create a username and password that's e-mailed out to the client. Then  
they could access an area of the website to upload and download files.  
I'd be interested in solutions for this. Maybe it doesn't have to be  
in Joomla at all for it to work? Thanks!

released a 1.6 version as yet.

I had this issue with a 1.0 site and IE 6, but have not seen it since.
Suggest that you clear both the browser cache and go to cmd 
ipconfig.flushdns

Message-ID: <BANLkTim6S4nvLWsi4bBEEmtChZe42VBUfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

Just want to remind everyone that tomorrow (Thursday 6/9) is the monthly
Joomla NYC meeting.

Note that the meeting is now being held directly across the street from Rose
Hall (Our former meeting site). I will also be out in front of the building
10 minutes prior to the start of the meeting at 6:30 PM to help guide those
wayward souls looking for the place.

I'll provide more detailed directions in another message.

Also, Alpha 1 of the long-awaited Joomla 1.7 is now available for download.
I haven't had a chance to try it out yet, but I like the news so far.
According to the release notes, you will be able to upgrade directly from
Joomla 1.6 to Joomla 1.7 through the control panel. It sounds similar to the
WordPress upgrade method.

http://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5372-joomla-17-alpha-released.html


And while I have your attention, I also want to plug Joomla Day NYC 2011,
happening May 22 and 23. You can register right now at
www.joomladaynyc.comand sponsorships are available.

Also, if you haven't visited the newly redesigned JoomlaNYC.org website, you
should. Marion of Gothamwebsites.com had done a fantastic job freshening up
the site.

Hope to see everyone tomorrow.

Message-ID: <BANLkTikbG4iKcpDa+J_yZsGVyRh-hDRVVQ@mail.gmail.com>

The new location for the monthly Joomla NYC meeting is at 146 West 65th
Street. The entrance is across the street from the stairs leading to our old
meeting space in Rose Hall.

You will see the double-doors underneath the fancy glass-enclosed restaurant
on the main concourse. Go through the doors and walk to the back and you
will see signs leading to the conference room. I will be hanging out in
front before the meeting to make sure everyone can find their way in.

Note to those who attended the last executive Joomla NYC board meeting, this
is the same space where we met.

The meeing starts at 6:30 PM tomorrow. Scott Wolpow has ordered the pizza
and as always, there will be swag to be won. Meeting Chair Fred Sullivan has
lined up some interesting speakers. Plan to be there.

Let's give a big shout-out to Lincoln Center and Sebastian for hosting our
meetings.

Also note that Joomla Day NYC 2011 is scheduled for Oct. 22 and 23. For more
information and registration, visit www.joomladaynyc.com

I look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow.

I thought I saw in Joomla a while ago the ability to bring up a page  
as Admin and it would outline the modules of the page. Is this in  
Joomla 1.5? Thanks!

Great news on version 1.7 Steve!

It sure looks great improvements are under way. I just did't quite
understand when they say "One of the major goals of Joomla 1.7 was to
separate the Joomla Platform (...) into it?s own product." What does
that mean exactly?

The Joomla Team is sure working fast now! :-)

BTW, Joomla Day NYC 2011, happening May 22 and 23? Have I missed it? LOL

Cheers!

You can do it two ways.


www.yourdomain.com/index.php?tp=1

or
in Admin go to template manager
click on your template, then use preview tab.

When you download Joomla currently you get 3 application in one.

Firstly, in the include and library directory, you get all the code that
is used to build a Joomla application to begin with.  The database code,
the table code, sessions, plugins, etc

Then in the main directory is a file called index.php, and the
directories: administrator, components, modules, plugins, templates, and
media
These files constitute the  joomla application - what the general user
sees when he goes to your website.  They are built using the "base"

Then in another folder called "install" is yet another Joomla
application which basically is JUST a set of screens to gather data,
create a Joomla database, and create a Joomla website

It is possible to take the base code and create a completely different
set of code which will function like Joomla in many ways, but have a
different interface for controlling it, etc.

One of the things to understand is that there are certain common tasks
when building a PHP website.  A PHP website often has to connect to a
MySQL database for data.  It has to provide a system to allow a user to
logon and a way to check to make sure the user has permission to do
various things[edit content, post comments, etc] on the website.  It
frequently needs some form of skinning/templating so the design can be
changed without changing code.  It needs some way to send system
generated emails to users.

There are thousands of ways to do all of that.  And every coder
developes his own 'favorite' way to do it.   For some things there are
"best practices" on how to do things.  On others, it is very up in the
air. 

So freelance PHP developers that go from project to project are often
having to learn what the "right" way for doing something is in that bit
of custom code.

That's where "frameworks" come into play.   A framework basically means
a collection of functions to do some of that stuff.  Frameworks can be
developed independently of any application[CakePHP, Symfony, Zend, etc]
- and they can be developed specifically for an application[Joomla,
Wordpress, Drupal].  Frameworks are documented, so instead of having to
work through the code to figure things out, you can look at the
documentation.  And wheras there may only be three or four people in the
world that understand all the functions and such in a custom application
so users are locked into them - with frameworks you can find many more
developers.

The independent frameworks generally suffer from having too many
features for things which are rarely done, and being somewhat overly
complicated.

The application frameworks generally have a problem in that often it is
not possible to separate the framework from the application[you can't
just use the User/ACL system from Wordpress, you have to have an entire
wordpress site].

Joomla sits somewhere in the middle.  About 60-80% of the "framework"
for Joomla lies in the include directory.  Depending on what pieces of
Joomla you consider base[the file management system for images is
managed by the media component for the most part - which is stored
outside include.  The user system also has a lot of needed code outside
of include.  Same with the content component, but it is debatable
whether or not you /need/ a content component.  And the same with the
template component.

Using frameworks frees developers from a lot of the "boring" bits of
code and let's them focus on what they like.  It saves time and money. 
The more familiar with a framework, the more time and money that can be
saved[or alternatively, spent on extra features]

All your Joomla Core developers also code PHP for a living.  They either
do so as freelancers, or serial entrepreneurs, or other processes.  So
even if a project their hired for is not a right fit for Joomla the CMS,
it is still often economically efficient for them to use Joomla the
Framework and build code on top of that. 

So as time goes by, with each new version of Joomla, they aim to provide
a clearer separation between the framework and the CMS.

Also keep in mind that, in my opinion, the core developers make most of
their money through other projects.  So while they have a need for a
strong Joomla Framework...they really don't care so much about the CMS. 
Their main economic benefit of having a CMS is name recognition and that
more people using it means more weird esoteric bugs are found which may
be in the framework.

It's one of the reasons why there is such a long dev lag between
versions at times.  The core team have economic motivation to keep
improving the Framework, but none on building the CMS.   So once the
Framework is done, they only devote their spare time to the CMS. [In my
opinion, this means Joomla has reached a point where they need to split
into 2 teams, CMS development and Core development..]

By splitting releases/updates into the 2 streams as they are doing, I
think there is a good chance that both will benefit.  It means major
changes to the CMS can now be made without having to wait for the
Framework changes to be ready to be released....and vice versa.

Subject: [joomla] reminder: Joomla NYC monthly meeting is at 6:30 PM tonight
Message-ID: <BANLkTinmhtDKpWM8rqwUL4q+skx32Q=kTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

Just a reminder that the monthly Joomla NYC meeting takes place tonight and
remember to go to the new location. We're still at Lincoln Center, but we
will now meet at a new space across the street from Rose Hall.

Also, we need chairpersons and presenters for upcoming meetings. I will
chair the July meeting and Laura has volunteered for September. We still
need a chairperson for August.

We also need presenters. If you have come across a great module or
component, why not share it others at the next Joomla meet up? Please
contact me if you are interested in presenting or chairing upcoming
meetings.

I also had a chance to test Joomla 1.7 Alpha 1 last night and the good news
is it looks and feels exactly like Joomla 1.6. I was able to install 1.6
templates and modules without any modifications. I have got my fingers
crossed that it will be a painless upgrade to 1.7 next month (July).

I have pasted the deployment calendar below. It is also worth noting that
support for Joomla 1.5 will end in April 2012. You might want to start
steering those clients now using 1.5 to Joomla 1.6 and 1.7.

And remember, Joomla Day NYC weekend is Oct. 22 and 23. For more info, see
www.JoomlaDayNYC.com

See you later tonight,

- - - Steve

05 June - Joomla alpha 1 released for public testing

Subject: [joomla] login issues with ie in Joomla 1.5 web site
In-Reply-To: <27570916.779662.1307548784228.JavaMail.root@vms170033>
References: <27570916.779662.1307548784228.JavaMail.root@vms170033>
Message-ID: <4DF26176.8040206@gmail.com>

My own experiences with odd logon issues comes down to domains.  
Somewhere in the logon process someone sticks hardcodes the root domain,
for example website is www.mydomain.com and at some point during the
logon process, before the userid has been submitted, it is getting
submitted to mydomain.com[perhaps in the form tag on the logon form].

So the user logs on to mydomain.com and then gets redirected back to
www.mydomain.com
A user logon is...at some point..stored in a cookie on the web server. 
Some identifiable bit of info is stored in the cookie and associated
with the domain which set it[mydomain.com].

Depending on the browser configuration, some browsers will assume that
if they are connected to www.mydomain.com they should also allow access
to the server for mydomain.com cookies.  Others are more paranoid and won't.

So if your having a specific issue with a specific browser, check the
domains.  ESPECIALLY check all the domains in the logon process, not
just the ones being displayed[ie it will drive you crazy if the logon
form displays www.mydomain.com and after logging in your immediately
redirected to another page on www.mydomain.com ... you will not /see/
that the data is being passed through just mydomain.com at some point.]

You can try an extension like Redirect Blocker in firefox,
http://code.kliu.org/noredirect/ and disable javascript to see if that
helps you step through the process[I always attack it at the other end,
debugging the PHP to catch the problem there as I have done it enough
times that it's easy and quick for me]

Subject: [joomla] Fill out form, then get a PDF downloaded?
Message-ID: <80DCCE38-9C01-4B21-9AFE-3E6F27EEA014@gmail.com>

I want to be able to offer a White Paper on a Joomla website. This is  
how it would work. Visitors to the website (non-registered guests)  
would be encouraged to fill out a form with some basic information and  
then be able to download a PDF White Paper.

Ideally, it would not only allow the visitor to download the White  
Paper PDF, but also send an e-mail message with a link to download the  
PDF too. But don't want the URL to the PDF used without visitors  
filling out the form. So maybe it would create a temporary URL that  
would expire soon like 24-hours? I'm thinking a PHP script executed to  
send the PDF to the visitor's web browser would be good, because this  
way Google Analysts could report on the download. Need some method to  
store the collected basic information too.

If there is already a module to do this in Joomla, please be so kind  
to share it with us, I imagine others may have a use for this.  I  
don't want this to be annoying for the visitors to use, but there  
needs to be data collected.

If folks have a better suggestion as to how to handle this I'm open to  
suggestions. I realize there might be something that does part of what  
I'm asking and I might have to adapt it. I wanted to keep this all  
within Joomla. It wouldn't be too difficult to link to a PHP program  
to do this, but I'd like to keep it all within Joomla so it flows with  
the rest of the website. Thanks!

There are quite a few ways to do this.
One way is to use RSforms and a hidden menu item. This would allow any 
person who has the url to download it.
A second method would be to use a cart that allows downloads. Tienda 
offers that.

But you are making a mistake demanding that people fill out a form 
first. Many people use throwaway emails for this purpose.

I would send  the white paper as attachment after they give me first 
name and email address (make sure you have a recaptacha) .
Use a forms module to get the basic info.
On the confirmation page I would then ask if they could provide more 
details. This works better as they know feel that have gotten what they 
wanted
Last thing is to place a link in the last page pdf asking what they 
thought of the white paper. This way you know if tehy really read it or not.

David,

I've used the Documents Seller extension AKA DMS, from joomdonationcom. 
What is lacks in refinement, it makes up in features.  It's $40 but you 
get a pretty complete system for distributing documents, free or for 
money, so your visitor info is covered in the cart part, and even manage 
uploads. The doc can be an immediate download, or emailed. Time or 
number of downloads is settable as well.

Mark

Hi Scott.

That's a good suggestion, I think e-mailing the white paper as a PDF  
attachment is better. I also like your ideas to gain further feedback.

Subject: [joomla] Managing custom CSS for use with a commercial template
Message-ID: <785C0912-335A-4E87-9DC6-80F314C47CB1@gmail.com>

I'm using a commercial Joomla template which comes with it's own CSS,  
but it's 1.5 with 1.6 expected to come in the near future. Meanwhile,  
I wanted to added some of my own stuff for CSS to this for some  
customization to add a few div class.

Anyway, I realize if I add this to the CSS file provided with the  
commercial template that when there is an update for a bug fix or when  
it goes to 1.6, anything I added to their CSS file would be overwritten.

So I thought about how to manage this, where I could still use my  
custom CSS for future releases. How are people doing this? Do you  
create an additional custom CSS file for the template, and then edit  
the updated templates? Or is there some place to squirrel away your  
own custom CSS? Thanks!

Subject: [joomla] latest new module with multiple templates
In-Reply-To: <4DF59ECE.3000206@wolpow.com>
Message-ID: <CA1E6406.17113%toddsugi@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I brought this question up at the last Joomla meeting but am still really
stuck. 

I'm using the latest new module on my home page (custom template) however
I want the links to goto my other custom subpage template, not on the
homepage. I set the default template to the sub-page template and it still
didn't work.

I also looked in to the changing router.php but have no idea how and don't
want mess anything up.

Is there some php code I can use in the index.php page to achieve this?

Here's is the site: http://gosugi.com/levinandcompany/
The latest new module is the "open position" column on the right side.   I
want it to display on this page:
http://gosugi.com/levinandcompany/index.php/open-opportunities-main
Instead of the current home page.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Btw, I'm using joomla 1.6

Thanks,
Todd

Subject: [joomla] Template error
Message-ID: <CA2F9DBB.17767%toddsugi@gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm getting this error on my template manager page and its also not showing
my CSS files:
JFolder: :files: Path is not a folder. Path:
/home/content/p/a/i/paigee/html/templates/blankpaige/css

I changed the tmp_path to: public $tmp_path = '/tmp';

It use to the have the path that was showing in the error above.  So I'm not
sure why it's still showing that error.  Does anyone know what else I'm
suppose to change?

Any help is appreciated!

Thanks,
Todd

Usually this error means Joomla can't find what is supposed to be there. I
believe you know that.
Have you double checked for misspellings?
This path looks kinda tricky. Are you sure your CSS folder is where it is
supposed to be?
Are you running this website in a local environment?

Apparently I had the my css folder named in all caps "CSS".  It was also all
caps in my templateDetails.xml, but I guess is always needs to be lowercase.
Once I changed that it worked. Weird.

I posted and checked this question on the joomla forums but there are only
solutions for Joomla 1.5.

Does anyone have any solutions on how to change the default homepage link in
1.6?  Right now it's going to mysite.com which is a flash introduction.  I
need to change the default homepage link to mysite.com/index.php

Thanks in advance.

I am assuming you have your intro in /index.html and you want your joomla site to activate at index.php. 

You are probably not finding a solution because this is not a good way to go about  your problem. 

fixing your home page isn't going to  fix all your problems just the first one. 

an easy solution would be to put your main site in a sub directory example

mysite.com/index.html (intro)
mysite.com/s/ (joomla)

another solution is you can make the intro your joomla front page, you can than make sure all your joomla links don't redirect users to the root, example the logo clicking back to home. 

install a  very bare template, with the intro and assign it to default menu item.

If you are using k2, the frontpage doesn't have much  other use, because you don't need the publish to front page. 


My advice is don't use a flash intro though. 

Chris

Thanks. I really like the idea of the subdirectory, it's such a simple
solution.  The flash intro is required by the client, I would prefer not to
have it either.

Hi All,
I've been working with VirtueMart on a project and running into some
limitations. I was wondering if anybody has experience with any of the
alternative carts such as the OpenCart ports like JHShop or JooCart? redShop
looks interesting too but expensive.
This project has 14,000 items, multiple inventory locations and ships
internationally and I obviously need a robust cart to make this fly.
Any comments or suggestions or experiences you've had with the various carts
would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
Herb

If you want a joomla solution 
Tienda
http://dioscouri.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=167&Itemid=410

If not joomla 
http://www.magentocommerce.com/

Magento has a community edition, it is really powerful but ti doesn't fair very well on cloud or some virtual hosting solutions

if you only have a cart, and very simple cms needs and a good server magento is the way to go. 

If you need more complex CMS needs, like a forum, blog, you should check out tienda

OpenCart is easy to use and stable. I have used it for a couple sites -
collectible plates and a vintage book store, but I don't think it can handle
14,000 items, but it might as you can make product categories. The problem
with OpenCart is it has limited CMS. You can create pages, but content
management is not nearly as good as Joomla or WordPress.

If you have the time, I would try Magento. I have played around with it, and
it is an enterprise-grade e-commerce system (think Amazon-level), but it is
complicated and there is a learning curve.
