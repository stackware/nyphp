Subject: [joomla] help - redirect happening on site
Message-ID: <278925.93713.qm@web31807.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all...
?
ok, I have moved my entire site over to hostgator, per recommendation of other joomla users, but the problem is still happening!!!
?
If you go to the site:
http://www.childrensschoolofyoga.net
?
I haven't moved the ssl certificate yet, so you do get an initial warning, but if you continue, you are 'redirected' to a index.cgi...another page.
?
I am using joomla 1.0.15, I am using the initial files from joomlas install, I don't see where the problem is happening, I am going crazy!!!
?
any help would be appreciated!!!
?
thanks,
Laura

Site looks good, just going to front page. Actually, it functions well
*and* looks good. Nice design!  :)

What should I click to try and reproduce the issue?

LOL.

Everyone or anyone.  3-minutes per person, whoever wants to participate, to show a project they did, a neat tip or trick they want to share, how they made use of a Joomla feature or extension, etc.

I really would like to be able to make it, but being that it is "9/11" I
have quite a number of other places I am supposed to be.

Did Mitch ever present on Quizilla? having asked that, I should point out I
am *much* more interested in the hub/witness.org since it integrates rich
media uploading and sharing.

best,

Subject: [joomla] question about virtuemart
Message-ID: <272562.31086.qm@web31806.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello all,
?
I have joomla 1.0.15
Virtuemart: 1.1.2
?
I am having 2 problems:
?
1. You can not view any products unless you are logged in, therefor the 'public' can not view the products
?
2. If you login as a 'regular' user, you are just taken back to the virutemart login screen (although they are logged in, just vm doesn't recognize it)
?
3. Now here is the interesting thing, if I create a new user, and make them an Administrator in Community Builder, even if I haven't created their account in VM, everything works fine!? 
?
Can anyone lend a thought to this strange one???
?
thanks,
Laura
