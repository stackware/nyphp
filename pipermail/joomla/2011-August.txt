Subject: [joomla] Need Yootheme Template Alternative

Hi All,

 

After much work, I finally found a  tooltip plugin (QLUE Tooltips Pro)  that
works in a module.  But it is based on mootools and conflicts with the
jQuery in the Yootheme templates that I have been using on all my sites.

 

The Yootheme template menus are exceptionally good for the site I am working
on because they easily implement a multi-column dropdown menu that lets me
accommodate almost 50 product categories in one dropdown.

 

Can someone suggest another template vender they like with dense
multi-column dropdown menus, that is not based on jQuery?  The QLUE Tooltip
is the only one I could find that is a system plug-in and works in a module.

 

Thanks.

Is this a 1.7 site?? Have you tried YooTheme's tooltip with the module set to use plugins?

I am using a plugin called Pure CSS tooltip with a Yootheme template and I've used it in a module in 1.7.

An alternative to YooTheme's dropdown menu is a module called Maxi Menu CK that will take your menu and do all kinds of dropdown tricks.

Subject: [joomla] SEO/SEF - Do I need an extension to name my own URL for
	Joomla 1.5.23?
Message-ID: <A758EEEF-06FB-4075-8F7D-6E3B3BF425EC@gmail.com>

It's been a while since I've had to do this with Joomla. The friendly  
URLs are fine and working in Joomla 1.5.23, but I have a need to name  
my own URL for a few pages. Such as domain.com/whitepaper instead of  
whatever friendly URL Joomla would assign to it.

In an early version of Joomla, before 1.5, I think I had to install an  
extension to do this. And if I remember correctly, as Administrator I  
was able to put in the desired URL path of my own.

I've looked around and can't find the discussion on this I need. I  
know about renaming htaccess.txt to .htaccess, but I don't believe  
before I actually edited the .htaccess file to put in my own URL name.

I'm fuzzy on what htaccess.txt actually does now, because I still had  
it off and with the SEO Friendly URL set to 'yes' it was coming up  
with URLs based on the title of the articles all it's own. Thanks!

I wasn't sure if that can be done for the links to the RSFORM Pro,  
which is mostly what I need this for.

I was able to fill in an alias and it worked which is great. However,  
the alias gets translated to all lower case.

Any suggestions to be able to keep the alias case sensitive? Thanks!

sh404sef has an option that allows for both upper and lowercase alias in the url.

You do not need case for SEO and you should only have lowercase in urls.

Message-ID: <CABcNofOnkmz13rZMVxCBT_bN36ynHUH5J6v=uprcFz3LFk9+xw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

Hope everyone is enjoying the weekend.

I want to remind everyone that at 6:30 PM on Thursday, August 11th, the
monthly Joomla NYC User Group meeting will take place at our new meeting
room at Lincoln Center, 146 West 65th Street. (For detailed directions,
visit www.joomlanyc.org )

Scott Wolpow will discuss wire frames and the best methods to layout
websites before you start building. I will present two Joomla templates -
Construct and LessJoomla - that work with every screen from smart phones to
jumbo television LCDs.

I also have copies of Stephen Burge's new book, Joomla <explained> and Barry
North's Joomla 1.6: A User's Guide.

We also need to remind everyone that Joomla Day Weekend is coming up soon -
October 22 and 23. To take advantage of the $15 per ticket discount, you
must register before Sept. 1. So if you haven't registered yet, think about
doing it soon. For information and registration, visit www.joomladaynyc.com

And if you have registered, you should visit the website because there is
recently updated information about the tracks and speakers.

On other Joomla matters, I recently stumbled across an article, "How
WordPress Beat Joomla" on Weblog Tools Collection, a website devoted to
WordPress. The author, an Australian website designer, doesn't trash Joomla,
but he mentions how WordPress was able to make quick changes that helped
boost its popularity.

I don't completely agree with him, especially the part where bases CMS
popularity on Google searches, but he brings up some interesting points.

http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2011/08/05/how-wordpress-beat-joomla/


Hope to see everyone on Thursday.

All best,

Steve

In regard to "How WordPress Beat Joomla" -- Joomla is becoming a PROBLEM.? I've been working a lot with 1.6 and 1.7 and am finding it VERY buggy.


And as the author says, why doesn't Joomla put it in your face when your version is out of date?? Even with the new "one-click" upgrade, you have to click the "check for updates" thing manually before you know if Joomla is out of date.

I also have copies of Stephen Burge's new book, Joomla <explained> and Barry North's Joomla 1.6: A User's Guide.

We also need to remind everyone that Joomla Day Weekend is coming up soon - October 22 and 23. To take advantage of the $15 per ticket discount, you must register before Sept. 1. So if you haven't registered yet, think about doing it soon. For information and registration, visit www.joomladaynyc.com?

And if you have registered, you should visit the website because there is recently updated information about the tracks and speakers.

On other Joomla matters, I recently stumbled across an article, "How WordPress Beat Joomla" on Weblog Tools Collection, a website devoted to WordPress. The author, an Australian website designer, doesn't trash Joomla, but he mentions how WordPress was able to make quick changes that helped boost its popularity.?

I don't completely agree with him, especially the part where bases CMS popularity on Google searches, but he brings up some interesting points.?

Hope to see everyone on Thursday.

All best,

Steve

Donna has a very good point.

Maybe this would work, when you login as Admin it does a check for  
upgrade. If it's available, next to the version, which could be  
changed to "Current version: 1.x.x      New version: 1.xy". The "New  
version" could be linked to either the one-click upgrade you mentioned  
or directly where to download it from joomla.org. The "New version"  
would only appear if there was indeed a newer stable version available  
over the current one installed. Highlighted with a different color.  
This could be configured as Admin for those who want to know about  
even beta versions. Also, this would be a good area to alert about new  
patches especially for security updates.

For those who might always be logged in as Admin, the script could  
check every 24 hours if a new upgrade is available.

One reason for WP rise is with people with zero budget.
It is very easy to use, but also very limited in scope and abilities.
Joomla is beginning to become a frustration.
But if you have complaints, then go and fix them.

It makes no sense that Joomla is now extremely buggy when we had a stable 1.5.? The core team used to be all volunteers.? Now they are being paid and Joomla has not gotten much better and in some ways worse.? I think it's time for another fork.? There were many good 3rd party admin tools that could have been incorporated and they weren't.

I have to agree on Scott with this one...if you see bugs, or room for
improvement, contact the joomla.org team and make a difference.

Visit, http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/contribute-to-joomla.html and see
what you can do to make it better.

I personally feel a lot of what common users thing are features they can't
live without from wordpress we could add to joomla with a new more user
friendly admin template.

Donna

Please, do a bit of research before slinging mud:

The core team hasn't been paid in almost a year now. They are all
volunteers.

At WordPress, they are almost all paid and paid one by one person. They run
an Apple model, where according to a WP core developer I talked to last
month, they have three dictators to make all final decisions. The good thing
about that for community members is that they largely don't have to worry
about the core code at all.

Joomla (and increasingly Drupal) run more of the Android model where things
are more fragmented and if you do want to see improvements, you have to get
involved and push. There's no free ride from a big company that makes all
the decisions for us.

Steve

Laura, 


Saying "fix it yourself" is not a productive response, since there are so many bugs.? It's shameful that they released these versions as stable.? I might be able to debug a few things here and there, which I did yesterday when I posted a solution to something that several people were asking about and there was no answer for, but I cannot work full-time to debug everything.??

The core developers are now being paid and OSM is capable of raising funds.? I've been a big fan of Joomla since the beginning, but OSM is not keeping Joomla up with the competition.? I'm not in the inner circle so I don't know what the issues are, but Joomla is in big trouble.

Donna

I have to agree on Scott with this one...if you see bugs, or room for improvement, contact the joomla.org team and make a difference.? 

Visit, http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/contribute-to-joomla.html and see what you can do to make it better.

Donna

Please, do a bit of research before slinging mud:

The core team hasn't been paid in almost a year now. They are all volunteers.

At WordPress, they are almost all paid and paid one by one person. They run an Apple model, where according to a WP core developer I talked to last month, they have three dictators to make all final decisions. The good thing about that for community members is that they largely don't have to worry about the core code at all. 

Joomla (and increasingly Drupal) run more of the Android model where things are more fragmented and if you do want to see improvements, you have to get involved and push. There's no free ride from a big company that makes all the decisions for us.

Thanks Donna

I don't think there's any denying that open source projects that don't have
businesses behind them are struggling to find models that work:

   - Joomla has problems as you mentioned.
   - I still see huge projects starting on Drupal 6 because those developers
   don't believe Drupal 7 is stable yet.
   - Firefox is being rapidly overhauled by Google Chrome.

Just because community open source projects have challenges doesn't mean we
should give up and turn to business-owned open source. More reason to roll
up our sleeves.

Steve

Drupal is a bit of a hybrid. Core changes come from Drupal.org, which is 
often based on improvements done by Aquia (the company run by the Drupal 
creator).

However, Drupal only allows vetted modules, which has good and bad elements.

Back to Joomla.
Most people who use Joomla are not coders.

We need more people to get involved.
That is one main reason for the second day of Joomla Day weekend.

I have not started on 1.6 or 1.7 because I do not yet have all the 
extensions I need.

Perhaps at the Joomla Day Weekend we can start to build a plan to 
advance Joomla.

I am gain, who else wants to meet?

Dear All,

These days there seem to be more challenges with the new CMS and I have not
yet found my comfort zone. It seems the Problem to solution ratio is leaning
heavily to the problem side.

Just finished a course attending not teaching where we used 1.6. I found a
number of things troubling. Many of the extensions I regularly use with 1.5
not available. As a result I had to learn a new editor which was a plus but
to add a map and a video needed to create an HTML module but to embed the
code needed to turn off the editor. OK not too difficult but time consuming
to track down and implement. I would imagine a big turn off to a new user.

During the class we migrated from 1.6 to 1.7 where a number of things broke
although the migration was swift it looks like I will need to go back to the
template clubs forums for more fixes.

Joomla is not alone. At work they chose to use Drupal to build a site for
one of the units I work with. They started with 7 early this year then moved
back to 6 as 7 was giving way too many problems. I believe the plan is too
migrate to 7 again later.

Now a third site we built with Joomla was converted to a custom CMS with PHP
this site is sailing along without any of the issues we are facing with the
Open Source CMS however you would need some good php skills to work on the
custom CMS aside from uploading to the preset templates.

An original attraction to CMS for me was less coding and an interface that
non technical users could easily work with via the wysywig. Today signs all
point to time to get up to speed with programming skills to develop and
trouble shoot or build your own?

regards - Bill Bly

Well, if you have not used 1.6/1.7 yet, then you don't even know what I am referring to!


Real basic stuff just not working.? Try changing a few words in a content article and saving.? It says successfully saved, but you better check because sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.

The first time I thought it was my imagination or something to do with my particular installation.? But it happens intermittently on all my sites and on different webhosts.? This never happened before in 1.0 and 1.5.

So you better do a quick copy of your content before clicking "Save" because you might have to retype all your edits.

Drupal is a bit of a hybrid. Core changes come from Drupal.org, which is often based on improvements done by Aquia (the company run by the Drupal creator).

However, Drupal only allows vetted modules, which has good and bad
    elements.

Back to Joomla.
Most people who use Joomla are not coders.

We need more people to get involved.
That is one main reason for the second day of Joomla Day weekend.

I have not started on 1.6 or 1.7 because I do not yet have all the
    extensions I need.

Perhaps at the Joomla Day Weekend we can start to build a plan to
    advance Joomla.

I am gain, who else wants to meet?

I'm a strong believer for the right tool for the right job, but recently I've been using Wordpress more than Joomla and here's why:

From a marketing point of view, the majority of my clients need and want to tap into social media streams and interact with their target audience.  This is easily done in Wordpress.

Wordpress, 'out-of-the-box' comes with a comment system which can easily be enhanced by installing some extra bells and whistles through their plug ins.  It's easy to use their RSS feeds to both push and pull feeds to social media outlets and again, there is a plethora of plug-ins that really hone in on what you need and even allow for automated posting to and from the Wordpress site from social media outlets.

Wordpress, 'out-of-the-box' can easily be themed for HTML5, unlike Joomla! which requires many HTML overrides to make it HTML5 compliant.

Wordpress has great SEO 'out-of-the-box' and some great free SEO tools to add-on such as Yoast Wordpress SEO which allows my clients to understand SEO and start using it themselves.

The Wordpress admin interface is easier to use for my clients.  I personally, don't see the difference, but from a business point of view, I need to give my clients an interface that is not intimidating or requires a steep learning curve.

Up to now, I have not had to pay for a subscription or fee to use any add-ons or plug-ins.  It has been entirely free.

So to sum it up, for me Wordpress is easier to use, cheaper to deploy and has greater social media marketing options and most importantly, its fits the requirements that my clients are looking for.

I love Joomla! and I've followed it from when it was still 1.0, but the reality is that the web is changing rapidly and it's not 'easily' meeting my clients needs, so unless my clients come to me and request Joomla! or they need to set-up a user management system, my choice is Wordpress at the moment.

When I started using Joomla 1.6, my first impression is that it was  
faster than 1.5. I was annoyed I had to use 1.5 again because some of  
the things I needed at the time weren't ready for 1.6. But I have  
confidence that the concerns will get addressed in the Joomla  
development, unless something has changed lately and I'm not aware of  
it. I don't see a real problem staying with 1.5 for now to be honest,  
and I'm willing to wait out for the things I'm reading about to be  
addressed.

It's been a while since I've paid close attention to the development,  
testing and documentation of the Joomla as a project. Is there an area  
where we in the Joomla community could pitch in to strengthen the  
efforts to fix these problems?

David,
Yes, visit joomla.org, here are some good links:

http://developer.joomla.org/

Here you can find ways to help the project, and more!

Also, attend a joomla event, where the joomla leadership team will be
attending, what better way than to speak directly with those making the key
decisions for Joomla!

Can I mention, joomladaynyc.com ?  We will be dedicating the 2nd day for
just developers.  It will also be a great time for you to meet and speak
with Ryan Ozimek, president of OSM, and many others that are integrated into
the joomla project.

Of course there are many other joomladay events as well, Austin in Sept, and
so on...

thanks,
Laura

Greetings!

I want to remind everyone that the monthly Joomla NYC User Group meeting
takes place tomorrow night at 6:30 PM at Lincoln Center at 146 West 65th St.
(For more detailed instructions, http://www.joomlanyc.org )

This month Scott Wolpow and I will be presenting. Scott will discuss
wireframes and how to design your site before you start construction. I will
show two Joomla templates that can be seen in a wide range of browsers, from
iPhones to 55 inch LCD screens.

I also have a bunch of Joomla books to give away: Stephen Burge?s new
Joomla! <explained>, and Barry North?s Joomla 1.6: A Users Guide.

And bring your appetite too as Scott is bringing pizza!

*BONUS Joomla News, featuring VirtueMart 2*

Mark Twain once said "The report of my death is greatly exaggerated" and
apparently the same can be said about VirtueMart, the popular shopping cart
component for Joomla.

Last year it had been rumored that VirtueMart would not be upgraded to work
with Joomla versions released after 1.5. This turned out to the false as
VirtueMart 2, release candidate 2, was released on July 6th and the final
release is expected later this year.

To be fair, a year ago it was easy to think that VirtueMart would die off.
Security updates were rare and even rarer was news and support from the
VirtueMart developers. Fortunately, the lack of communication helped spawn a
sub-industry with numerous third-party companies providing tech support, all
types of Virtue Mart add-ons, and special templates.

Now the original VirtueMart developers have regrouped and are actively
developing VirtueMart 1.1.9, which works with J1.5, and the upcoming
VirtueMart 2, which will work with J1.6/1.7. Last month at Joomla Day Greece
2011, VirtueMart project member, Max Milbers, gave a presentation on the
future of VirtueMart.
http://virtuemart.net/blog/136/406-presentation-on-joomladay-greece-2011(Note
that there is a 45 minute video on his VirtueMart presentation linked
to the site.)

Among the features slated to be supported by VirtueMart 2 are jQuery,
Akeebabackup, and a redesigned table layout. If you are curious and have
some spare time, you can download the release candidate for J1.6/1.7
http://virtuemart.net/news/list-all-news/405-virtuemart-2-rc-2-ready-for-download

I don?t want this to sound like a plug for VirtueMart. I need to mention the
excellent Tienda shopping cart from our friends at Discouri Design. Owner,
Rafael is a board member of Joomla NYC and has recently created a way to use
Tienda with the Zoo front-end component.  http://bit.ly/ahWJdX

Another shopping cart worth considering is redSHOP by redCOMPONENT.
http://bit.ly/a2FWB1
redSHOP began life as a fork of VirtueMart and has since taken on a life of
its own. Right now, it only works in Joomla 1.5. I tested it last year and
it appeared to be stable, but never got around to putting it to use.

I also want to add that the redCOMPONENT folks donated several thousand
dollars worth of plugins and component subscriptions that we gave away at
JoomlaDay 2010.

Speaking of JoomlaDay, if you have not registered for JoomlaDay NYC 2011,
you should do it now because time is running out. There is a $15 discount
per ticket if you sign up before Sept. 1. For more information and to sign
up, visit http://www.joomladaynyc.org

Hope to see everyone tomorrow night.

Hi Stephen

 

I have a new Joomla website and tried to go to the July meeting

but could not find it!!!  What building is it in?  I felt really lame.

Also, do you have a date for September?  I cannot make it tomorrow.

 

Thanks so much.   Looking forward to meeting everyone.  Laura

Sorry to hear that you could not find the location.

It's on 65th Street, west of Broadway. You will see a glass enclosed
restaurant on the left side. And underneath the restaurant, you will see two
glass doors. Go through the glass doors and walk to the back. Then take a
left and you will see a security guard. Tell him you are there for the
meeting and he will buzz you in. Here is my cell phone number if you have
problems - 914-661-0040.

The meetings take place on the second Thursday of the month, so it will be
on Sept. 8th.

Hope to see you there.

I realize there's a lot of unsatisfied people after the launch of 1.6.

Out of curiosity I googled for joomla forks and found a distribution in
development called Molajo. Even though they claim they're not a fork, I
found it quite an interesting project to keep an eye on.

It seems there was a talk about it in JDNYC 2010 - which I missed -
according to a video I saw.

What are your thoughts about it?

Cheers!

There are a couple podcasts on Joomstew which are worth listening to
to get up to speed on Molajo... I'd say it looks promising, but not
for me, at least not yet.

It has not had a release in over a year.  In my book, that makes it a 
dead project.

OTOH Joomla 1.7 is sooooo close to a terrific system... a LOT of 'under 
the hood' features have been added that I can see from the direction 
their going things may well improve significantly in 1.8.   The number 
of new features making itself into core have jumped astronomically since 
moving to github.  It makes it so much easier to suggest and add a 
feature to Joomla - you implement it in your own branch and submit a 
pull request.  No creating patch files, importing, exporting, and such.

The CMS itself really needs to get onto the same version control platform.

Hi Folks,

I just wanted to drop in and add a few thoughts to this thread.

The Molajo project was first announced, and we first started work on it, in
October of last year - less than one year ago. At J and Beyond this year we
announced a new direction for Molajo that would help showcase one of the
many potential uses for the Joomla platform. This new direction meant that
instead of creating a distribution of Joomla we would create a new
application utilizing the Joomla platform. We have been making good progress
since this change in May, and you can follow along at
https://github.com/organizations/Molajo. Molajo has not reached Alpha yet,
but we do anticipate a release in the upcoming months. Hopefully you'll like
what we've done.

Best,

Good afternoon,

 

I've got a new website, not officially launched, and need assistance with a few of the more

complicated tasks.  Since the site is not bringing in revenue yet, my budget

is pretty limited.  The topic is spirituality and building consensus among faith traditions.

Check it out and if you'd like to help for a moderate hourly rate, please send me your info.

Thanks!!  Laura

I am having a difficult time implementing a commenting system in 1.7 with social networking login across all components (MT and Zoo on same site).? So I am looking at hosted commenting systems.

Does anyone have any experience with Disqus vs. IntenseDebate?? The articles comparing them that I've goggled all seem to be old.

I personally never used intense debate, but I have used disqus on several
sites and find it really nice all around if you pay for an account 19.99 for
all your sites you get nice tracking features too.

I am sure that since wordpress now owning intense debate they good too but
maybe wouldn't be as cross platform??

Atleast disqus claims they are better cross platform

I'm a bit confused on their pricing.. 19.99/month even for a single site 
sounds like a good deal to me.

However, it seems much higher than that:
http://disqus.com/admin/addons/packages/

299/month for Professional which covers up to 3 domains
999/month for VIP which also covers on 3 domains

Am I missing something?
