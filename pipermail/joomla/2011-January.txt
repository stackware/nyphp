I took a look and it's not clear if and how it can be used in other
languages than english.This is important to me as my target audience is not
english speaking.

Some international payment methods are missing. Also important, because my
target audiences uses a local payment method that offers services that
PayPal won't.

There's a monthly fee to use the service. It's not much, still, it's there.
And by being commercial, it lacks the appeal Joomla has.

As Donna mentioned, her friend is graphic artist. Perhaps she is comfortable
with a solution that won't need the knowledge of programming. I'm a graphic
designer and I relate to that. I can't create code, but I feel comfortable
looking into it and changing what I need to.

Adobe BC seems to be a threat to Joomla just like any other CMS out there.

Hi Helvecio,

The problem with the videos is the quality is bad. We found that many
of them are too dark and they are difficult to watch. We have learned
a valuable lesson for next year in that we need to bring in lighting
and external microphones for better sound.

There are a few videos on the site now. If you go to the Schedule
section, you will find three videos, including Ryan's keynote.

I am working with Fred and we should have more videos on the site
later this week.

All the best,

Steve

for joomla 1.5?

You need to copy and rename a position you already have in your template. probably only with the XHTML tag, and than edit your temateDetails.xml file and add the location into the that file so it shows up in the admin dropdowns.

yeah, the club templates are becoming very complex!  You would find it in 
another file in the template directory.  I haven't worked with Joomlart, but if 
you do a search for the module code you will find which file they are using.  
For example, search for "jdoc:include" in your template's folders.

Thanks,
I will do that.
Now, after i get the position added, how do i determine the actual parameters of the module position (size, shape, position on page)?

Thanks,
I will do that.
Now, after i get the position added, how do i determine the actual parameters of 
the module position (size, shape, position on page)?

yeah, the club templates are becoming very complex!  You would find it in 
another file in the template directory.  I haven't worked with Joomlart, but if 
you do a search for the module code you will find which file they are using.  
For example, search for "jdoc:include" in your template's folders.

sounds like major issues to me. 

However i think you would be better off maybe going the multi site route with  each sub domain acting as it own "site"

She's getting the digest version, so she doesn't get the emails when they're 
sent, she gets them grouped into one email, once a week or once a day depending 
on the setting chosen.

If she looks at the date of the message in question, it is dated Thursday.

Subject: [joomla] Elin's book excerpt
Message-ID: <1295203527.14613.55.camel@jersey>

I just looked over the first chapter of Elin Waring's book: The Joomla
Book. There is a lot of good information in that chapter. Much of it she
covered in the presentation.

>From what I read in that excerpt, I think I'll try converting my company
website over to 1.6 in the next few days. I like that 1.6 has the update
feature built into it.

Hello,
I just installed MAMP on my Macbook Pro 2.8 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo
For some reason the start page won't open.
Can anyone please help?

Does it come up blank?  If so there's probably a startup error.  You would have 
to check the log file for the error, because last time I tried MAMP, all error 
reporting was turned off by default.

Are you using Skype or do you have Skype open?

You cannot use Skype with MAMP or WAMP because they both use port 80.
If Skype is on, turn it off and see if it works.

maybe your apache is messed up

the quickstart has not been so quick

maybe just do a fresh install
http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html
then see if apache is running
you should get default page from Apache
then install Joomla

I did a fresh MAMP install last night.
Apache gives a green light.
This is the default document root for Apache in MAMP: 

/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/

I'm using MAMP right now and I have used several versions for many
years. The only times when I have encountered problems was when I
tried to run another application that uses port 80, like Skype or
Google Voice.

What other programs are you running? I have a hunch that there is
something blocking port 80. Are you trying to view MAMP through a web
browser or some type of IDE like Net Beans or Aptana? What happens
when you try to bring up PHPmyadmin? Try disconnecting your Internet
connection and see if that works.

Jerome just helped me figure it out!
It seems as if the start page URL is different from when i first used this program a year ago.
Had to change it.
Thanks everybody!

Besides CB, is there any good systems in 1.5 that would allow user 
groups with access to only the groups members belong to.

I know that 1.6 this will be easy to do, once the components come out.

Hi Scott,

 

I recently tried and really liked Community ACL by CorePHP for group
management.  You can create groups and have various roles within your
groups; each with its own permissions.  I thought it was easy to setup and
the user interface was pretty intuitive for a non-technical person.

 

Sincerely,

Besides CB, is there any good systems in 1.5 that would allow user groups
with access to only the groups members belong to.

I know that 1.6 this will be easy to do, once the components come out.

Those of us who have talked to Mitch have most likely heard the story of 
how Joomla! came to be.  How it was originally Mambo and when the Mambo 
team went in a direction most of the developers could not tolerate, it 
was forked to become Joomla!.

Recently, it appears that FFMPEG[the open source project which provides 
"the" video creation/player base for linux] had the same thing occur.  
What is amusing though is instead of forking the process, after long 
dragged out discussions and flamewars, it appears that they simply 
co-opted FFMPEG when it the sourcecode and such was migrated to a new 
provider.  Since they were in control of that process, they merely 
locked out the current maintainer and appointed a new one.

Makes me wonder if perhaps the reason Joomla! is still stuck on 
Subversion is more due to fear of giving someone else control of the 
sourcecode while migrating to Git rather than for any other reason.

No, that is purely do to resistance to change. Git requires a
different approach, and learning new tools.

For a lot of people, that is a barrier that is just high enough for
them to distract themselves with other seemingly more-important
projects.

I'm using Git for everything today, and probably complain about it as
much as I compliment it.

This is the best Git workflow I have seen documented so far:

I still detest Git's stubborn philosophy in being cumbersome enough to
be dangerous and anti-productive unless used exactly as intended
though. Whatever happened to polish and panache?

Couldn't agree more. This is the single most important factor preventing me
from being a git enthusiast, as opposed to merely finding it useful.
In the world of technology & adoption, things like that tend to make a huge
difference.

VCS tend to be open source *variations* on vendor lock in. The primary
reason people don't switch is not that there isn't something better, but
that migration can be really painful for your users and suck up way too much
overhead.

Subject: [joomla] extensions for creating a study partner site
Message-ID: <324844.2566.qm@web31508.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I am going to set up a Joomla! site where people can search for other people with the same 'study' interests (can be academic subjects or anything else) - and partner with them remotely to study material together. 

So there needs to be a way to create individual profiles, and a database of users, searchable by a variety of custom fields. Also, there should be a way for users to initiate and manage their study partnerships - send a request/introduction through the site, accept a request, view current partners. And possibly some sort of project management tool on the site, that members can use to set goals and track their progress, in pairs. 

So - what extensions would you suggest? I'd like to do the site in 1.6 - there is no deadline yet and so I can work on this while 1.6 continues to improve and more extensions become available. The custom fields makes me think CCK, perhaps K2? Although the last time I looked, K2 search wasn't that good. But then the relationships between profiles makes me think Community Builder or JomSocial? What kind of integration can be done between a CCK and CB or JomSocial? What other options do I have?

Thanks,
Tamar
