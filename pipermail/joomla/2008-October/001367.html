&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be blunt, we need to plan more than a couple days in advance. That
</I>&gt;<i> is really killing us as a group, as it is not possible to promote the
</I>&gt;<i> meetings, let alone know for sure when they are happening.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now that we have a shiny new website (thanks to everyone involved),
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to propose lining up talks for the rest of 2008
</I>
We should at least set the meeting dates and post them on the calendar.
Could be one of the first orders of bizniz at this next meeting. Anyone
have a holiday calendar?

&gt;<i>  (there are
</I>&gt;<i> only a couple left, should not be too hard). With that out of the way,
</I>&gt;<i> we can actually promote the events, and start lining up talks for
</I>&gt;<i> 2009.
</I>
With larger user groups, such as LILUG, that becomes a position to be
filled. With smaller groups, such as this, unfortunately, most of the
work falls on a few shoulders. Perhaps we need to consider a little more
organizational structure.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing I always liked about NYPHP is that they seemed to be a
</I>&gt;<i> couple months ahead of the curve, and we should emulate that approach
</I>&gt;<i> as it has proven effective.
</I>
&gt;<i> I also wonder if there would be any real interest in an
</I>&gt;<i> install/demo-fest from time to time, targeted at folks that have never
</I>&gt;<i> used Joomla but want to get it running, and see it in action. Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> have an opinion if that would be useful?
</I>
Perhaps make it an annual or semi-annual event. Could include
refreshments to make it sort of a 'party'.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for the last-second reschedule this month,
</I>
Second reschedule???!!! WAIT! So when's the meeting???

&gt;<i>  to be honest I thought
</I>&gt;<i> it was discussed on the list. My apologies to everyone. To me it was
</I>&gt;<i> clear that holidays trump user group meetings, and was not aware that
</I>&gt;<i> the UniGroup meet was the following Thursday.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We definitely need to get November and December planned and on the
</I>&gt;<i> calendar so stuff like this no longer happens.
</I>
Put events calendar on website???
