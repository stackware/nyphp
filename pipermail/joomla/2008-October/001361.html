<PRE>I also wanted to say that I was surprised to see that the Joomla meeting was
rescheduled without any discussion on this list...?

I don't know of any other regularly meeting groups that reschedule in that
manner without first making sure it's not a conflict.

NYC JUG is a pretty small group, at least our meat space meetings are where
we have basically the same 6-8 each month. There is at least one other
UniGroup member among us, thus scheduling a meeting for this Thursday is a
conflict for at least 25% of our members, just from one other event alone.

Also, as of the day before the regularly scheduled meeting there was no word
at all on the list about whether it was happening at all, and the
announcement of a rescheduling only went out at 3:30PM on the day of the
regularly scheduled meeting.

I do like the new JoomlaNYC website, it has a basic 2.0 look to it (big
relief from the broken template) so props in order, Also having the last
meeting recap on the side bar is great, kudos on that too. Perhaps we can
take Robert Half off the sponsors list at the bottom of the front page.

So to sum, moving the meeting without talking about it first really sucks,
but the new website is kinda cool !
