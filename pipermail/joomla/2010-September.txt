Hello Everybody,
I'm sort of new to CSS.
What version of CSS is being used for Joomla template design (CSS3 or what)?
And can HTML5 be used in Joomla template design?

HTML5 and CSS3 are not limited by joomla, but by the users browsers if they support those newer versions. 

So if you only want your site to work in chrome and safari and opera latest versions than go ahead with those. 

that being said, html5 and css3 are awesome.

So which version of CSS is the best when designing joomla templates for all browsers?

If Internet Explorer 7 on Windows XP is your lowest common
denominator, you'll have to drop to CSS2, possibly even CSS1 (if they
have their browser set to "Compatibility Mode" it will emulate
IE6!)...

This totally depends on what "all browsers" means to you.

My suggestion is to go to the book store and read a chapter in each. 
Most cover the same basics, but some read better to different people.
I also look for examples that I can use in the book.

Here are a couple of good tutorial sites on the web:

As for books, I like O'reilly publications

NOTE: These are my personal favorites, which I have seen highly
regarded by more respectable persons :-)

The Eric Meyer book is considered by many as the best starting point:

http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Eric-Meyer-on-CSS/Eric-A-Meyer/e/9780735712454/

There are sequels to this book. If you like the writing style of
Pragmatic Publishers, then I'd recommend their book as well:

http://www.pragprog.com/titles/bhgwad/web-design-for-developers

As for more basic, conceptual stuff, the Jeffrey Zeldman book on Web
Design is a classic:

Message-ID: <4C7FA31E.7090602@zooluserver.com>

  What are some best practices building a Joomla site with a team.

I am currently joining a company where they currently are editing code 
on the live servers.   This is not a good situation, and I have heard of 
some disaster stories in the company where people were overwriting their 
work, and by mistake deleting/moving files.

I would love to get a development environment setup including 
incorporating SVN.  I am used to developing custom php web applications, 
where all configuration and code are in files.  With Joomla, some 
configuration (usually extensions) are in the DB.

I have some ideas, but they require the developer to run scripts.  Some 
of the people tweaking the code are really just front end designers, 
they need to go in and update the css, and an image, etc.

What is the best way to manage a team of designers and developers to 
develop, build and deploy a Joomla site.  I really can not find any good 
resources online.

Cheers,
Paul

1) Use scm - git, subversion, something, ANYTHING! hehe
2) JoomlaPack - that provides a GUI to export/import, maybe that is
what should be going into your scm so everyone is looking at the same
data?

I always setup several servers, dev, test, and www (production).
That's been the easiest way for me to make sure everyone on the team
is looking at the same thing, and also ensures that testing and
debugging can be done on the exact same environment as production
(further limiting unwanted surprises).

Using SVN at the moment, so we are good here.   What exactly are you 
putting in the svn?  Do you put the whole project in there?  Or just the 
theme and any custom extensions you are developing?  What about 3rd 
party extensions?  Does everyone working on the project have to install 
the extensions themselves?

Sounds great.  Will start using that right away.

What is your setup here?  Everyone has their own local environment and 
installation?  How do you manage extension installs?

Hi Folks:

I'm faced with a similar situation, but instead of starting with a 
Joomla site I have the task of taking an existing commercial CMS-based 
site and migrating it to Joomla. I want to be able to use a team 
approach to systematically develop and move selected parts of the site 
to a shared development environment (probably on a different web host). 
That is, one site used by the Team instead of multiple localhost 
installs. How would one setup the 3 multiple servers in this case? Any 
suggestions / tips would be welcome. Don't know if this will trigger a 
lengthy blog post from Mitch.

Best regards,

Tom

Hi Paul,
Here are some links I ferreted out when setting up Subversion (SVN) for my
development process.

I have a local dev server and then setup  a remote test server that has the
same environment as the production site.
I'm not using SCM on all the files in Joomla, only the ones that I'm working
on. This does require a little more tracking effort on my part and I would
like to version the entire installation but every time I've attempted to
"Add" and entire Joomla install SVN would throw errors.
I played around some with Bazaar and Mercurial but after spending days
wading through tons of info and doing as much testing as I could I had to
get at least some versioning system running for my projects and I settled on
Subversion (SVN) as it's been the easiest to grok. I use TortoiseSVN which
is a GUI for the SVN executable.
I'm hosting my repositories for free at https://projectlocker.com/  There
are limitations for the free account (5 users, 500MB storage all
repositories) and with three projects under SVN I'm approaching the size
limits. Their for fee services are very affordable and they also host Git
repositories as well.

Cheers!

  What are some best practices building a Joomla site with a team.

I am currently joining a company where they currently are editing code 
on the live servers.   This is not a good situation, and I have heard of 
some disaster stories in the company where people were overwriting their 
work, and by mistake deleting/moving files.

I would love to get a development environment setup including 
incorporating SVN.  I am used to developing custom php web applications, 
where all configuration and code are in files.  With Joomla, some 
configuration (usually extensions) are in the DB.

I have some ideas, but they require the developer to run scripts.  Some 
of the people tweaking the code are really just front end designers, 
they need to go in and update the css, and an image, etc.

What is the best way to manage a team of designers and developers to 
develop, build and deploy a Joomla site.  I really can not find any good 
resources online.

Cheers,
Paul

I am having similar issues.  For me, this is because extensions are 
installed via the admin interface, which means apache owns the files.  
So when using SVN, your users usually does not have permission to add 
.svn folders in these directories.  What happens to me is that I end up 
getting my whole project svn locked, and needs a more technical person 
to resolve (which means I will have to help everyone on my team fix).

3rd party extensions and the Joomla source should not really be part of 
your source code.  Would be great to use svn:externals here but that is 
not always possible.
Another solution is to use Phing, to help "build" a project, but I do 
not know of way to programmatically  install an extension.  That would 
be great as phing could test if the extension exists, if it does not, it 
could install on that users joomla install.  Once again, not sure how I 
could integrate phing into a designer's toolbox (for example if they are 
used to using Dreamweaver).

We had a great presentation last month at our Joomla user group meeting
on an extension that does some fantastic things with the template, and
from your description, I think this would be what you are looking for. I
just wrote up the meeting minutes and posted them to the site:
http://joomlanyc.org/ , last night. The extension is called Meta
Template Pro, and the website is: http://www.metamodpro.com . You can
find out some info from the meeting minutes, and also a link to the
developer's website.

User group mailing lists, and list archives are good for finding answers
to your questions. For a newbie, I recommend http://iteachme.com for
some good articles and videos. You can also find some good tutorials
here: http://www.joomlashack.com/tutorials

Use Git if your not running windows, Mercurial if you are.

Every user gets their own branch to push commits up to.  One master repo
where they can push stuff to be released.

You can use write on commit scripts for the master repo so when something is
pushed there it is automatically released to production.  Alternatively,
some people like to use Hudson and Phing scripts to monitor the master repo
and run updates that way.

Right, but that does not really answer my question.  How do you manage 
extensions?  Do you put the whole site in the repository?

Ok, that does it.

Seriously though, I was on a distributed team at Viacom and had
several servers that were basically forcing your code to run the
gauntlet - I developed locally, pushed via svn to a repository, and
that was manually pushed to a shared development server where all
database changes were exported via mysqldump (one file for data, one
file for schema). Releases were tagged, and tagged releases were then
pulled to a test server, and once the codebase made it past test, that
release was tagged again and a tarball was submitted to their internal
platform publishing system for distribution to the live site.

A major hassle was dealing with all the database changes while active
development was going on - someone was invariably changing menu items
while someone else was moving modules around, while someone else was
installing a plugin and assorted components and modules for something.
In the end, all Joomla admin activity was done on the development
server, and pushed back to the local development installs via
mysqldump.

Pretty much did the same for the Jetsetter site for Gilt. That was a
much smaller team, and included some exotic tech so there was
additional complexity.

Before that I was involved with a project that had a pretty sweet
distribution tool made with phing, allowing you to say "phing install
$storename" and the following happened:

* svn export of stable tagged Joomla platform
* svn export of stable tagged commerce extensions suite
* svn export of $store data, media and static markup
* tar all this up and fling via scp to production or test servers,
which would automatically untar and install

That was awesome, but yeah code was tracked in what felt like was a
bazillion places as a result...

Sounds great Mitch.  I use svn for all my custom php development web 
apps (non cms/joomla/wordpress).  I have a few phing scripts to help 
assist me in the build.
I was thinking I would go with something very similar, where on the 
shared dev server, is where you would administer the site, including 
installing extensions.  There would be a custom page where an admin 
(super administrator) would be able to push changes back to the local 
development - not sure how I want to do this exactly since it involves 
files and mysql dump.  Instead of a push, might have a pull, where when 
a developer does an svn update locally, in addition I poll the dev 
server for the latest mysql AND extensions files.
That was awesome, but yeah code was tracked in what felt like was a
> bazillion places as a result...
I hear ya.  Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress, etc, should address this issue, 
as I feel it is a major drawback for companies that develop with their 
code.  I know a lot of people are one man/woman shop, but once you 
develop on a team, things change fast.

  Thanks for the feedback, Mitch.  All my prior work was as a lone 
ranger so this will be learning experience for me. I agree with Paul 
"once you develop on a team, things change fast"!

Cheers and have a great holiday weekend (to all nyphp joomla developers)

Tom

I tried it early on, but needed Git integration and scp - both of
which weren't supported at the time.

I ended up caving in to the cool kids and trying Textmate, and have to
say once you get used to it you can move pretty durned fast.

Are you looking at Coda more for the GUI comforts, or as a true IDE?

I've used Coda for several years and it has a preview tab that works
with Safari making it excellent for designing pages with CSS and HTML

Coda has native PHP highlighting and also has a clip system that
allows you to create your code snippets, which is great for working on
frameworks as well as Drupal, Joomla and WordPress themes.

But it you are going to be doing lots of back end coding, TextMate is
a better option. Coda is for designers. TextMate is for programmers.

It's a little bit of both the GUI and as an IDE.
I'm studying CSS now so i can be a better template designer.
I use Transmit on my Macbook Pro and stumbled onto Coda.
It looks like a cool replacement for Dreamweaver.

I'm developing my template design skills with CSS and all.
This seemed like a good program.

Coda is great for templates. I do the initial design in either
Fireworks or Photoshop and then slice up the PSD and code the CSS and
DIV tags in Coda. I will then test the code as a plain HTML page in
various browsers and OS's. Once I am happy with the results, I will
then turn the code into a template using MAMP.

When I tested Coda I discovered something that I could not live with -  
after selecting a line of code or just a word, it was not easy to then  
drag that highlighted text to another location on the page. The  
pointer had to be positioned perfectly or the text would become  
deselected on mouse down. Maybe this has been fixed?

Other than that gripe, it is quality software for middle and frontend  
development. The integration of the terminal, css, ftp, etc is nice  
for keeping an uncluttered desktop. But that said, it did not seem to  
have enough innovations to make me want to buy it.

I'm a designer and I like its straight forward interface.

Still you have to know your HTML and CSS.

And you probably should anyway even if you're not using Coda - 
unfortunately there's a LOT of designers that dont know HTML and/or CSS...

Well, I don?t complain.

I've got a couple of programmers who can?t code HTML and CSS and I'm here
for them! ;-)

I have a bunch of these messages in the error_log for a Joomla  
installation on a shared host:

17-Sep-2010 15:15:35] PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load  
dynamic library '/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-zts-20060613/

line 0

I've not seen this before. Anyone have a clue what the problem might  
be and what action I should take? Thanks!

Check to see if the files exist on your server. You may have to contact 
support for that.
Are globals on or off in php.ini?
You may have to use a local php.ini or htaccess to modify your directories.

Thanks for the reply, Scott.

The conclusion is that in the account's php.ini, register_globals was  
set to On. I'm not sure how it got turned On, because Joomla's pre- 
flight checks for this to be Off and I don't go forward with an  
installation of Joomla without all green. I placed a local copy of the  
php.ini to that directory and changed it there. So perhaps somehow  
after installation, that account's php.ini got changed. Maybe  
something non-Joomla got installed and required it to be On and it got  
changed.

The lesson in shared hosting, is to have a php.ini in each Joomla  
directory.

Is there a Joomla plug-in that produces
the action of a book in which you can
turn the pages.  For example:

I know magazine publishers just love the look, but a magazine is a 
different medium than the Internet.
Try and convince them to just say No.

Yes, there's a flash plugin that does it. It's been around for many years. I think it's called flipping book. Nobody likes that stuff. Useless eye candy.

Subject: [joomla] Fw: JoomlaNYC: New extension for Joomla: Idea Informer
	feedback widget is now integrated into Joomla 1.5
Message-ID: <229619.7165.qm@web35605.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

FYI.


--------------------------------------
Hello,


Perhaps the following information might be interesting for you and your 
community members. We've developed a feedback module for Joomla 1.5; find its 
detailed description below.


I'll be glad to answer any of your questions concerning Idea Informer feedback 
module for Joomla.

Kindly,

Julia Babenko
Idea Informer
contact at informer.com


New extension for Joomla: Idea Informer feedback widget is now integrated into 
Joomla 1.5.

Idea Informer has developed a feedback module for Joomla 1.5. This extension 
allows the webmasters who operate Joomla based websites to integrate a free 
feedback widget into their projects quickly and easily. The core idea of Idea 
Informer module for Joomla is to let webmasters improve their websites basing on 
suggestions of their visitors.

Previously the owners of Joomla based websites were not able to set up a 
feedback widget; with the introduction of Idea Informer module for Joomla 1.5 it 
is not only possible, but also simple and free of charge. You can find a demo 
project with a complete instruction on how to integrate a feedback widget into 
your Joomla 1.5. project here joomla.idea.informer.com.

Idea Informer (http://idea.informer.com/) is a free and easy-to-use feedback 
tool, which gives an opportunity to improve the website basing on customers 
ideas. In order to receive feedback from website visitors you should sign up on 
idea.informer.comand receive a code for an interactive widget to be installed on 
your website. The service provides a platform for a dynamic dialogue between the 
website owner and the visitors. Suggested ideas can be supported by other users 
who vote for them thus moving the best ones to the top of the list; hence a 
webmaster knows opinions of the majority. At the moment Idea Informer is used by 
both startups and popular websites, e.g. http://funny.pho.to.

Subject: [joomla] Weird #$@!!^@! redirect happening - HEEeeLLP!!!
Message-ID: <009801cb5e95$3e3e27f0$baba77d0$@covenanttek.com>

Hi All,
Any help on this would be greatly appreciated as I'm currently pulling my
hair out and not sure what to try next.
I deployed a site to www.castlepointe.com and everything was working fine.
The client wanted DOCman added to the site and there were a number of tweaks
I wanted to do so I Akeeba backuped the site, loaded the archive to my dev
server and went to work. So far so good. I made all the changes I wanted and
AB'd the dev site, uploaded the archive to my test server, www.ctsproto.com
. I can access the backend fine but when I attempt to access the front end
I'm being redirected to the original site www.castlepointe.com ???
I've checked the .htaccess file and there isn't any redirect there. I
disabled the Joomla SEF and deleted the .htaccess file, same problem. I
checked the cPanel and there aren't any redirects for the domain.
If I create an index.html in the root of ctsproto.com then the index.html
will open and no redirect.
I've looked at the source file for the redirected page and all looks normal.
I've used Live HTTP Headers and I can set the GET for ctsproto.com and a 302
redirect code but no info on what is initiating that.
I've used different browsers and a different PC and I get the same redirect.
I've checked the DNS zone record and everything is as it should be, A and C
names all pointing where they're supposed to, correct NameServers , all
looks good.
I ran tracert for ctsproto.com and it stops at the correct IP,
174.132.192.252.
It seems that there has to be something in the Joomla installation that is
initiating a redirect.
I don't know what else to try at this point and I'm hoping somebody can
point me in the right direction.
Thanks!
Herb

Thanks for the reply, Scott.

The conclusion is that in the account's php.ini, register_globals was set to
On. I'm not sure how it got turned On, because Joomla's pre- flight checks
for this to be Off and I don't go forward with an installation of Joomla
without all green. I placed a local copy of the php.ini to that directory
and changed it there. So perhaps somehow after installation, that account's
php.ini got changed. Maybe something non-Joomla got installed and required
it to be On and it got changed.

The lesson in shared hosting, is to have a php.ini in each Joomla directory.

Check docman's configuration file. Some components use their own configuration file instead of using Joomla's.

Subject: [joomla] Weird #$@!!^@! redirect happening - HEEeeLLP!!!
Message-ID: <01d001cb5f2b$2323eae0$696bc0a0$@covenanttek.com>

Thanks for the tip Donna.
What I did find out was it appears to be somehow caused by Akeeba Backup
itself or some corruption to the archive but I'm still completely in the
dark how that would initiate a redirect.
The Warnings window in AB would open during the backup but only dotted lines
would show where a message should be. The backup would complete
successfully. I deleted the all the site files on the test server, deleted
the DB and uninstalled Akeeba Backup 3.1 (I had just updated from v3.0). I
reinstalled AB3.0 created another archive and installed it on the test
server. Everything works fine, thanks be to God!
I can't figure any means that would create a redirect to the original site
other that an .htaccess file (I deleted it), an SEF extension perhaps (I was
only using Joomla core and I disabled it) or some other extension (there
aren't any installed extensions that would have anything to do with a
redirect) so I'm still baffled. I suspect AB may not be the actual cause of
this either as the dotted line warnings from AB 3.1 may not have anything at
all to do with the redirect error.
If anyone can shed some light on what other possible mechanism for a
redirect exists I would appreciate hearing from you.
Cheers!
Herb

Check docman's configuration file. Some components use their own
configuration file instead of using Joomla's.
