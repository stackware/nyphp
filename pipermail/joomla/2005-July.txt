D'oh!

Gmail isn't showing me any new messages in the NYPHP-Mambo label!!!

*spacemonkey writes foul-mouthed email to gmail

Not yet, but a new project has me evaluating both this weekend. I'll
post on Sunday or Tuesday what the results are, as both have made
major strides lately.

Ok, 

Tried the beta of mosCommerce, and have to say it is nowhere near
ready for production use. It also requires $php_global = On, which is
a total nono in my book... The installer is not integrated with Mambo
at all, and there are errors when I try to use the admin component.

For now, the ruler of the roost is Mambo-phpShop, by default (there
are no other competitors at the moment).

The upcoming 4.5.3 release utilizes ADOdb for database abstraction,
and we support any database that ADOdb supports. We've made a lot of
changes and fixes along the way, hoping to make ADOdb better as well.

You can check it out of cvs from the mambo project site at MamboForge,
the module is 4.5.x. Right now it runs on whatever database you want,
I am finishing up the installer to work the same way.

Last week a fellow walked up to me at TGIFridays and asked a couple
questions. Come to find out he doesn't program at all, he basically
takes mambo and installs a bunch of goodies and he is done. So if a
non-programmer can use Mambo, a geek should be able to get productive
too ;-)

http://help.mamboserver.com/ has a couple component and module
tutorials as well as the API. That in itself should get you going, but
I am a learner by doing and suggest you jump in and start breaking
things to learn the fastest.

Great for corporate sites, business sites, commerce sites, and online
publications. It is not especially suited for community sites at the
moment, but that weakness is being taken care of rapidly.

Right now Mambo is not really suited for blogging, but we are about to
release a GPL blogging component that is really crazy. After that
point, then there is really very little that Mambo cannot do, and do
well.

Like my story above, if someone pays you $x to deliver a site, you can
start at 0% done, or 80-90% done. Choose wisely! ;-)

We got 6 projects approved for Google's Summer of Code, and 3 others have 
volunteered to do the work anyway (without the pay). One of those projects 
is version control, which directly addresses this issue. The others are 
equally fascinating, and we have a really great group of students to work 
with this summer.

We are setting up a wiki for the projects and will announce when everyone is 
ready.

Also, note that as soon as 4.5.3 ships we can start ripping out the ACL for 
4.6, where you will have full users/groups options for fine grained access 
control.

We will be releasing it as soon as it is at a packaged state. Right
now we are done with comments and integrating trackbacks; and perhaps
the neatest thing is that each blog can have a different blog type,
and each blog type can have a different display template.

So a blog about events could have extra information about dates and
locations in the headers, and a blog about music could include extra
fields about bands and genres, for example.

What this really means is that you can now have meta-content within
Mambo, where each part of the site can have content with different
fields of information associated with them.

We will announce the release, promise ;-)

Hello List...

I have just installed the new mambo eCommerce 4.5.2.3 from phpshop,
along with Xaneon extensions in order to create multiple sites.
But after having created a new site on the xaneon admin, what must I do?
must I do another complete mambo phpshop installation on the new
location?

Anybody has a clue to how this works?

Thanks.

PS[OT] Mitch: I have tried Skype with Fedora and it worked fine, both
conversation and chat. We must have another go at it, right?

Subject: [mambo] Access Control Question
Message-ID: <42CBDE17.3030706@cyberxdesigns.com>

Over the last week I have been developing a site using components 
developed by third parties.  One of the biggest problems I have found is 
the inconsistent or non-existent support of access controls in 
components.  Below you will find two functions I pulled from 
com_comprofiler.  I have been adding these functions to other components 
like com_mtree and com_akoForms to control access to them.  I am 
interested to know if the Mambo core has functions that do what 
allowAccess and userGID do?  I would like to use Mambo core code and not 
access control code placed in each component.  I looked through the API 
documentation on the Mambo site and nothing jumped out at me.

Also, is there a standard way component developers should implement 
access control in their components?  Has the Mambo team documented the 
recommended implementation?

I regularly find it mind numbing that component developers charge for 
incomplete or buggy components.  For example, Mosets Tree offers no 
access controls to their content.  I emailed the developer and he said 
that I should not post the link to the content, to control access.  
Arrgg.......  My one bit of gratitude is that I have to source and can 
add access controls if I like and can submit the patches.

Thanks,
Hans

Hans,

So, if I'm reading this right, these functions you have below can control
front-end access to components, such as those you're developing or adding
to, correct?  I'm wondering if anyone has done this on the back-end as well.
It would be great to have some funcs I can drop into our homemade components
that will allow access to the components only if the administrator has the
right level of access in the backend permissions.

Did that make sense?

Subject: [mambo] Access Control Question


Over the last week I have been developing a site using components 
developed by third parties.  One of the biggest problems I have found is 
the inconsistent or non-existent support of access controls in 
components.  Below you will find two functions I pulled from 
com_comprofiler.  I have been adding these functions to other components 
like com_mtree and com_akoForms to control access to them.  I am 
interested to know if the Mambo core has functions that do what 
allowAccess and userGID do?  I would like to use Mambo core code and not 
access control code placed in each component.  I looked through the API 
documentation on the Mambo site and nothing jumped out at me.

Also, is there a standard way component developers should implement 
access control in their components?  Has the Mambo team documented the 
recommended implementation?

I regularly find it mind numbing that component developers charge for 
incomplete or buggy components.  For example, Mosets Tree offers no 
access controls to their content.  I emailed the developer and he said 
that I should not post the link to the content, to control access.  
Arrgg.......  My one bit of gratitude is that I have to source and can 
add access controls if I like and can submit the patches.

Thanks,
Hans

Ryan,

You pass the allowAccess function the groupId of the user and the 
groupId of allowed users and it does a comparison to see if that user is 
allowed access.  The allowAccess function also checks to see if you are 
in the Admin group, Super Admin or root groups. If you are in any of 
those groups the function returns true.  The function also supports 
recursing through Child Groups which is nice.

I imagine you can use these functions anywhere.  It is a matter of 
passing it the correct allowed group ids.  I have been calling the 
allowAccess function inside the Switch statements that control what 
action is to be taken by the component.  If the user is not in an 
authorized group, I break out of the switch state and echo an error.  
You can store what groups are allowed to access your component with your 
component and just pass it to the function in the switch statement.  I 
have also hardcoded the allowed groups to group 18 in a couple of 
places.  Group 18 is the registered users group.  If you want more info 
about group ids take a look at the mos_core_acl_aro_groups table.

I hope this is helpful.  My advice is to wait for Mitch to chime in on 
if these functions are in the core and where.  Someone told me they 
might be available as part of the ACL libraries but I was unable to find 
them.  Mitch, have any pearls of wisdom here?

Also thanks to Hans, that is food for thought.

I don't have a clean answer to this, as I don't think the existing
system is something where we could add a couple methods to existing
classes and then presto you have an easy authentication API for 3PD
components and modules.

I can say that I am forwarding Hans' initial post to the other core
guys, hoping to spark a discussion on how we could try to provide
something sooner rather than later. I agree that it is something that
we all need, and the rest of the core agree, so we just need to get an
approach that works from the core perspective, as opposed to just
cut-n-paste for each component you want to deploy :eek:

Subject: [mambo] Howto add session variables to Mambo 4.5.x
Message-ID: <42CF62CF.3040202@cyberxdesigns.com>

I recently faced with the need to add two session variables to Mambo.  
Searching the Internet I found a couple of resources but no straight 
forward directions on how to add them and access them.  I thought that I 
would write up my experience and submit it for comment.  Chris Hendry 
helped me figure this out.  So thank you Chris for your help, thank you 
Mitch and thank you Mambo.  We use Mambo all the time and love it.

You are going to have to complete two tasks to add session variables.  
First task is to add a column to the session table in the data base.  
The second is add the variables to the session class to handle the data 
work. 

So, Mambo uses a custom session handler that stores the session data in 
the database.  Each session variable has an associated column in the 
database so I started by adding a column to the database using the MySQL 
ALTER command.  Mambo session data is stored in mos_session table.  Take 
note, the name of the column will exactly match the name of the session 
variable.

You will need to be able to use the MySQL command line interface or have 
access to phpMyAdmin or some other client that lets you run SQL directly 
on the db.  You will also need to have a user with the privileges to 
ALTER the database.

Sample ALTER command:

ALTER TABLE `mos_session` ADD [column definition] AFTER `gid`

The second step in the process is adding the session variables to the 
class that handles sessions in Mambo.  I have to take this opportunity 
to state that modifying the core makes it unsupportable by the Mambo 
crew.  In other words, you will have to hand patch the files that you 
modify to ensure that the patches that come out of Mambo do not 
overwrite your changes.  What does that mean, running a diff against 
your files and the Mambo patch files and figuring out how to apply their 
changes.  Enough of that rant.

Open the file /includes/mambo.php and find the class mosSession extends 
modDBTable.  This will be on or about line 2037.  You will see a list of 
variables:

var $usertype=null;
    /** @var string */
    var $username=null;
    /** @var time */
    var $gid=null;
    /** @var int */
    var $guest=null;
    /** @var string */
    var $_session_cookie=null;

You will need to add your variable after the original Mambo session 
variables.  For example:


var $guest=null;
/** @var string */
var $_session_cookie=null;

/** @var string */
var $newMamboSessionVar='foo';

Please take care to name your session variable exactly the same thing 
you named your new column in the table.

Now figure out where you need to use your session variable and access it 
through this object:

$mainframe->_session->newMamboSessionVar

if you want to change the value of the object do this:

$mainframe->_session->newMamboSessionVar = 'bar';
$mainframe->_session->update();  //The update method commits the change 
to the session store.

I think that is it.  As long as $mainframe is in scope you should be 
ok.  I can't recall off hand a place in Mambo that mainframe is not in 
scope and if it isn't just add it to the global list at the top of the 
function.

I look forward to feed back from the NYPHP Mambo crew.  If I am wrong or 
have made a mistake please let me know. 

Thanks,
Hans

I am in agreement with you Hans, and think we need to provide for this

The existing implementation is not up to snuff, but we are trying to
get 4.5.3 out the door so it will not make it in this release.

Just thinking out loud, we have two realistic approaches for the 4.6 release:

    1) rewrite the session class to not require core/table mods
    2) incorporate the session handler included with ADOdb

I immediately like #2 as it provides instant gratification, but I also
dislike having Mambo's core functionality to depend too much on
external libraries. So it will definitely happen in the 4.6 release,
but I cannot promise at this point whether it will be homegrown or
from an existing library.

Also, using database-backed sessions means easy support for
high-traffic sites that have multiple apaches in front of a clustered
mysql backend. So the klunky solution at the moment still has merit
:-)

Your pains however, Hans, have been heard!

Just to clarify my position, I am not complaining about the current 
implementation.  I was complaining about the fact that there was no 
straight forward resource that I could find that described how to add 
new session variables.  I wanted to make that resource available to 
other users of the 4.5.x branch.  As a matter of fact, I found modifying 
the current implementation to be very easy and straight forward once I 
put the pieces together.  Add a variable here, update a table there and 
remember to update().  Whammooo done.  I have see some other 
implementation of custom session handlers that were much harder to change.

I have no problems with the way sessions are handled now in Mambo.  
Other then I have to modify Mambo.php.  Maybe the session class should 
be broken out of the core and into a library.  This way when the core is 
patched, modifications to the session code are not impacted.  Seems like 
session code might be an area that is regularly modified.

I agree with two things Mambo has done.  1. Use a database to store 
session data.  2. Limiting the amount of data stored in session.  I like 
the fact that having a higher than normal barrier to implementation on 
session data has limited the amount of session data carried around.  I 
think all to often, and I am offender, too much is stuck in session.

Enjoy the lovely weather today!

Hey Michael,

So you want everyone uploading into one directory, or what exactly are
you trying to do?

Hi Leila,

Consider modules as blocks of logic that are secondary to the page
content, and components as logic that *IS* the actual content.

So with a base mambo install, you can see that the litle blocks are
modules, but when you click on Contact Us you will see in the main
content area the component itself (com_contact).

Modules are strictly for the front end; whereas components can be on
the front end as well as the back end (again, see contacts for an
example).

Further complicating things is that you can use a component on the
back end to maintain a front end module (polls, for example).

I don't remember when this all started making sense to me, but I do
remember that it was really just an adjustment of terminology - which
is a challenge no matter what CMS you choose.

Take a look at the component tutorial. That should provide a decent
example to get you started.  Also, you can grab Mambo Designer from
mambodev.com or jamboworks.com (not launched yet). This will create a
base template, module or component that you can then work from. Yes it
is beta, but is quite usable :-)
