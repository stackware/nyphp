Subject: [joomla] Personal pages in Joomla
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=PsHMFeTcZw60WdJ1xU_wWQnEc0tyQe989Cqfd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone!

I have a project where I need to have a personal page for each member of a
medical  institution.

Each member's page should be open to the public. On each page one can find
the member's picture, type of specialization, address, contact information
(phone, email), city, state etc. People visiting the institution's website
could search for the professional they're looking for.

Is there any component out there that does the trick?

Thanks in advance!!

Does anyone know if it is possible to have two URLs sharing one Joomla database?

Ideally, each site would share core information such as the general page content, but each would have differences in the design template and certain navigational elements, etc.

This is something like a replicating site.


Many thanks...

Message-ID: <011801cbc48f$367a4020$a36ec060$@covenanttek.com>

Hi All,
I have a client that is having some issues with email and is using a MX
server that is separate from the site's domain.
When I've looked at the zone file (dig castlepointe.com or dig
castlepoint.com mx, etc.) things just look a little funky compared to other
sites I have.
I've been reading through the RFC docs and while they're helpful there's
still a lot about DNS that seems voodoo to me and I could use some help.
Is there anybody who would like to make some quick bucks for an hour or two
of work to looks this over and certify all is as it should be.
Thanks!
Herb

What is the best way to handle a split home page in Joomla

Index.php (home Page) Checks for Cookie
No Cookie - Load:
Default home page- which is an Opt In -> Subscribed -> set Cookie -> 
Thank You Page



Cookie Found - Load:
Subscriber returns -> Cookie Found -> sent to Subscriber Default Home Page


Any thoughts on a Component/Module/Plugin or way to do this so that it 
is not effected by changing templates?

Thanks

I'm currently working on 3 personal projects and figured I'd see if

First off, I am working on re-working the Joomla install/configuration 
to move all the Joomla files outside the webroot except for the 
index.php files.  I want to package it all up the way FudForum does[one 
giant PHP file that contains the installer and all the code using the 
halt_compiler function of PHP, 
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.halt-compiler.php

For this project, I don't expect or even care if I succeed, it is more 
that it will allow me to learn more about Joomla core internals for my 
REAL goal.

Real goal, second project: Joomla! Embedded - a Joomla! distribution for 
embedded devices.  Mainly this is using just the Joomla! framework, 
getting rid of a LOT of the external libraries[no need for phpmailer] 
which also means getting rid of some core classes.....and getting rid of 
MySQL[which means replacing the JUser class with something that can 
function with a different user storage structure].

I've got online access to an Elphel to play with, 
http://www3.elphel.com/index.php and it looks promising for setting up a 
digital camera to make my wife happy.  But it's user interface sucks, 
and the only current project to make a better interface is using 
Java[something I avoid using].   So I want a decent Ajax web based 
interface for the camera, and the default distro includes lighthttp and 
PHP 5.2.  Match made in heaven, I can code that!

I first looked at it as writing a small mini framework for the system[as 
I want to use MVC practices, and want userid/permissions 
management]....  but I think in the end building my own mini 
framework[or learning a new one] would take as much time as using 
Joomla! and stripping out all the bulky stuff I don't need.

I figured I might as well ask here if anyone knows of an existing 
project for these first.   Mind you, this is low priority work compared 
to paying work.....but I have some time so my goal is something beta 
level by May 7th[my wife's birthday......you guys just /had/ to schedule 
dev camp for that day didn't you?  :-)]

Lastly, I've been hacking around with HTML5 and was thinking it might 
make for a fun presentation at an upcoming Joomla meeting if there is 
interest.

Gary,

While I don't have any mind-expanding answers for you, I do think that it
would be awesome if you made a distribution of Joomla for embedded devices!
I just had a great conversation a few days ago with two guys from Finland
that are keen to provide a powerful Joomla experience for mobile phone, and
it sounds like there could be some good synergy there.

Let me know offline if you'd be interested in a connection, and good luck in
your endeavor.  It sounds very cool.

Cheers,
Ryan

Sounds like Joomla Lite. Do the reverse of what Mitch did for quizilla. 
Strip out the user functions and anything but pure content management.

Subject: [joomla] Configuring Joomla 1.6 to bridge to Drupal 7 features
Message-ID: <4D549B8C.3090805@gmail.com>

I'm playing with Joomla 1.6 and Drupal 7 on some sample sites [I'll post 
the url's in a few days once I build up content].

One of the things I am doing is looking on how to use Joomla 1.6 in a 
Drupal manner from a user perspective[not coding].

Drupal has 2 very interesting features, Nodes and Taxonomy.

Nodes:
Instead of "content" being the basic unit of measurement, Drupal has the 
concept of "Nodes".... a node is very similar to a content item, it has 
most of the fields a content item as....but it's not specifically 
content.  In Drupal, you then configure different "types" of content, 
basically extending the Node table[either by adding another table and 
linking it, or adding CCK fields to the content, etc].

Everything is stored in nodes + customization.

So an online store "component" does not neccessarily have an a product 
table and an order table.  Instead, it will have a Product Node Type, 
and an Order Node Type.  Only adding more tables if it can't be crammed 
into the existing Node structure.

This way each and every "item" in the Drupal world has it's own unique 
id/row in the node table.

They also setup by default a number of "friendly" content types such as  
"Blog", "Article", "Page"  these are all variations on the simple 
"content" item with slight tweaks, mostly on some default behaviors and 
permissions.  For example, on a magazine/social website "Pages" are the 
'about us' stuff and such.  So only site admins get permission to create 
those content types.  "Articles" are the news stuff so your authors, 
editors, and publishers have various rights there....and by default all 
new articles will go to the frontpage.  Wheras "Blog Entrees" could be 
open for any registered user to create - as all users get their own blog 
space.

Also each content type has friendly details for the end user telling 
them what sort of thing to post there, the rules for posting, etc.

So, there are 2 levels here.  One is that all "things" that get created 
in the normal course of a website have friendly, helpful 
information/guidance/permissions for the user.

The second is all "components" create nodes.

The first level is easily emulated in Joomla! 1.6 ...  simply create 
your categories for standardized pages, with permissions for different 
users and such.  So basicaly, here you are not using categories to 
describe the content of the document, but rather the purpose.  IE you 
don't create an article in the  "IPad" category, a subsection of 
"Gadgets"...  instead you create an article in the "Article" or perhaps 
"Review" category.

The second level requires buy in from extension developers to all agree 
to use the content structure as the base for as much functionality as 
they can...  So my goal is for a small sample site to stick to this 
model....all components use the content tables.

Taxonomy:
This Drupal item is rather interesting.  It began mainly as a free form 
tagging system.....with the added plus that you could have multiple 
"categories" of tags.  So you could have a tagging category which all 
users can add to/use to describe content.  You can also have a tagging 
category for the website authors to use to provide a more 
sophisticated/reliable set of tags for items[for example, users might 
tag an article as "shoes!", wheras fashion authors would tag it as 
"Manolo Blahnik, Fall 2010".  You can also create a taxonomy which is 
/never/ used for tagging anything and is merely a list of frequently 
used terms[for example, create an SEO taxonomy of terms to include in 
most pages and then have a script run against all submissions to let the 
writer know how many they used.  Or create a SPAM taxonomy of words to 
AVOID in content which will be emailed in order to avoid spam filters.]  
In Drupal 6 there were a number of extensions to Taxonomy, for example 
since Taxonomy was just a list of terms, there was a module that added a 
definition field - so now you could create a glossary.

For the longest time, in Joomla 1.5 the easiest  way to emulate this was 
to use Remository's Glossary component: 
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/living/education-a-culture/glossary/143  
And all in all it is a pretty sweeet component.

However, I REALLY want to stick as close to core as possible.  And the 
new Category system for content seems like a pretty good system for 
taxonomy.

All you have to do is create a parent "Category" with the permissions 
set so that /no one/ can create a content item in that category.  For 
example: "Freetagging" for tags.  Or "Tech Terms" for a glossary.  Every 
category has a description field which can be used to provide 
definitions of the term for glossary's or other information.  There is 
still work to be done to build components that build on this to provide 
management and user interfaces - yet all in all the basic design is 
sweeeeet in that at least a lot of this is already provided FOR us.

Give me a week or so and I'll post back on some reports of how well it 
is working out...  in the meantime I figured I'd solicit others opinions 
since my own ideas tend to get stuck in small caves of techno-babble.

Drupal also allows for the styling down to the field level when using 
Views.
The Drupal concept is bare bones and you add everything.

Hi Ryan,

I figured I might as well ask....  I have no problem if you pass on my 
contact info to others for this project and I'll be happy to shoot you 
the link to the project page/code repo once it hits alpha if your 
interested.

I rather expect that I have different goals than the guys in Finland, 
but having someone to bounce thoughts off of couldn't hurt.

Just to explain a bit, I'm currently unemployed. I lost my fulltime job 
last year and have not really gotten anywhere with looking for work due 
to living 2-2.5 hours north of NYC and not being willing to go down to 
NYC more than 2 days a week yet.  I've done some minor freelancing, but 
my main issue is almost no portfolio since all the websites I've worked 
on in the past where over 4 years ago[other than this one job] so not a 
lot to show.

I figure I might as well do some mini projects of my own to give others 
a sense of what I'm capable of.

For this particular project....my wife has been complaining for years 
about how loooong digital cameras take from pushing the button to taking 
a picture.  Last year I learned about DSLR camera's which are damn 
fast....but cost 750-1000....not in the budget while unemployed!

The Elphel looks like all the bits are there for a decent DSLR 
camera....but there is no interface.  If I can code up a decent 
interface for taking pics, reviewing them, uploading them, etc it will 
be perfect.

The hardware for the Elphel runs around 1000....but I think I can bring 
that down to 300-400 by subbing some newer all in one pc boards...plus 
it looks damn good on a resume.

By using Joomla as my base, I can use the Joomla! coding standards and 
shortcut a lot of nailbiting over how to design the base and skip right 
to the good stuff.

So my embedded version of Joomla! is, at first, just going to be enough 
to do what I need and not much more...if the project takes off after 
that I can make tweaks as needed....and since I'll stick all the code up 
on github others are free to fork it.

One problem I do have is what to call the dang thing.  Personally I'd go 
with J!Embedded and J!Elphel [for the Elphel specific vs Embedded 
version]....but I lack the patience to go through the approval process 
for Trademark and Copyrights with the Open Source Matters contacts[I've 
had bad luck getting replies in the past].  If you know any way to 
streamline that process, or to get provisional permission so I can use 
those names at least for the Alpha it would be great.

So I wanted to try out drupal 7 because a lot of times there is a debate over the CMS to start a project and I always advocate for joomla, which is mostly because it is what I know the most about. 

I have built probably 50 of so joomla sites, components, modules etc in joomla. 

However, I installed drupal and was trying to test out a few things and i felt like a monkey f**king a football.  Is it just me or is drupal kinda hard to get your head wrapped around?

Yes, it is quite differant from joomla. Drupal assumes you already know how to use. But once you get on track it is great.

HA!, 

I went to strand last night and picked up using drupal and pro drupal 7 development.  Grey sky's are starting to clear up. 

I am starting to see the drupal light, it seems to expect  that you are actually a developer! haha.

I installed Joomla 1.6, looks very good!

I know when a user adds a link, e-mail to automatically sent to the
admin's e-mail address. I thought this could be also done when a new
user registers, but I'm unable to find it. Or is there another product
from Extensions to manage the registration of users that's more robust
that's popular? Thanks!

Hi Donna! Thanks for the reply. I looked in there and don't see an
option for this. The e-mail address is in there for the admin for the
website itself. Let me ask you, do you have "New User Account
Activiation" set to "self"? Or Is yours set to "admin" so that you are
getting a notification? Thanks!

Thanks for checking this out, Donna. So in order for "self" to send  
email I either have to make some modification to Joomla or perhaps  
there is another registration program to use for Joomla that does this  
and much more. Anyone have suggestions? Thanks!

Subject: [joomla] RocketTheme: use it with moderation
Message-ID: <AANLkTimj_13PVvLtj5h=b46-To3oR-xNnipzf6C6BrM5@mail.gmail.com>

I'm very dissapointed with RocketTheme.

I chose one of their themes to redesign the site for a client. I thought it
would save me time, then I realized it's gonna make me WASTE time, trying to
find a solution for a problem they created.

This theme displays a Latest News area on the frontpage. Anyone who knows
Joomla for a sometime time is led to believe it is the Latest News module
placed in a position. AFTER purchasing the theme I found out it's a BIG
FAKE. It uses some hard coding inside an article display this article as
intros and nothing is created dynamically.

A template should be a straight forward solution. The way it is, it's no
life saver, but the Titanic!

Others have complained about this and they recommend us to use K2 and figure
it out by ourselves how to accomplish what should be there straight away.
Unacceptable!

Rocket Theme seems not to care for their customers AT ALL.

I don't like dealing with a business that treats their costumers this way,
after all, this is a PAID club.

I will DEFINETELY NOT recommend it.

I was warned by a Joomla Wizard not to use Rocket Theme. Now I understand
why.

Subject: [joomla] One of the nice Drupal things Joomla could learn
Message-ID: <4D62FB3E.4050905@gmail.com>

One nice thing with Drupal[6+] is that there not only is a standard way 
of doing things, it's heavily promoted.

In Joomla you have people who put their function libraries in the admin 
directory, and others put them in the public directory.....most split 
them into those that are admin related vs frontend related.

So it's a constant switch back and forth to find everything.

In drupal, everything is /in/ a specific directory.

Moreover, everything follows a common naming structure.

And lastly, for most function calls, you generally make the programmer 
specify the variables, you don't set a bunch of defaults[honestly, all 
the view->load() calls in Joomla drive me crazy trying to remember what 
the system defaults to in that specific instance.

Heck, things are standardized to the point where there is a module[erm, 
component] with a large database of rules to not only parse through code 
for bad practices, but it even will upgrade/convert the code for you.
http://drupal.org/project/coder
And add in http://drupal.org/project/coder_tough_love if you want to 
really hear chapter and verse in how you broke a lot of standards.

I'd love to see this for Joomla....   The one time I decided to run a 
code sniffer on some of my code, loaded up with all the Joomla 1.5 
coding standards library, it was discouraging to have to sift through 
all the Joomla Core broken standards to find my own problems.

And it's not like their even /difficult/ things to fix.  A lot of them 
just require someone to edit the file, as instructed, save it and commit it.

But with Joomla cruddy core repository, it is a real pain and 
demotivational.  I'd happily spend 3 days fixing a bunch of syntax 
problems[boring grunt work] if when I commit the work it goes in as 
"Commited by Gary Mort on XXX date.... message "Fixed 567 coding 
standard nits".

But instead, you have to:
Create an issue in the issue tracker.
Attach your patch file to the tracker.
IF someone feels like it from the core team, they might apply the 
patch.  But their likely to roll it up with some other patches, and 
commit it under their name[yes they will credit the bug tracker issue, 
and if one goes to the bug tracker one sees you did the coding....]

Open Source Coders contribute code for brownie points.  They /want/ to 
be recognized and not with a "thanks to " list with a bunch of names and 
no idea who did what[which has been ret-conned in the past].

This is one of /the/ reasons I'm a big proponent of VCS systems.  
Bazaar, Mercurial, and Git all merge different code changes in such a 
way as to bring along the commit history of who to thank[or blame].

It seems minor and trivial, but I think it's still true.  Give out 
brownie points and you get more [overweight] coders.

-Gary

Hi Helvecio,
Check out JoomlaWorks UCD module, its free, as in beer, and I've used to
dynamically display content for news and Latest Happenings. It may just be
what you are looking for.
You can display content from a section(s) or category(ies) as Lists, Slider
or Fader. It's a great tool.

I'm very dissapointed with RocketTheme.

I chose one of their themes to redesign the site for a client. I thought it
would save me time, then I realized it's gonna make me WASTE time, trying to
find a solution for a problem they created.

This theme displays a Latest News area on the frontpage. Anyone who knows
Joomla for a sometime time is led to believe it is the Latest News module
placed in a position. AFTER purchasing the theme I found out it's a BIG
FAKE. It uses some hard coding inside an article display this article as
intros and nothing is created dynamically.

A template should be a straight forward solution. The way it is, it's no
life saver, but the Titanic!

Others have complained about this and they recommend us to use K2 and figure
it out by ourselves how to accomplish what should be there straight away.
Unacceptable!

Rocket Theme seems not to care for their customers AT ALL.

I don't like dealing with a business that treats their costumers this way,
after all, this is a PAID club.

I will DEFINETELY NOT recommend it.

I was warned by a Joomla Wizard not to use Rocket Theme. Now I understand
why.

Hi Helvecio,
Check out JoomlaWorks UCD module, its free, as in beer, and I've used to
dynamically display content for news and Latest Happenings. It may just be
what you are looking for.
You can display content from a section(s) or category(ies) as Lists, Slider
or Fader. It's a great tool.
Ciao`,

the rocketheme templates actually do have some of the extras you talked about but sometimes hard coding is needed - I've been using the templates with great success for quite some time. though in this one case yes you are correct - but do you really want intro's generated automatically - i know that for anything i've done my client and I both want full control over the wordings. I think you are looking for a theme that instantly makes your sites look perfect without any work. be cautious about this - you use any template as a starting point and adapt it to your needs - if you wanted a theme to do all of that instantly i feel like you'd pay a LOT more than 90 bucks a year for 4 years of 1.5x templates.

I'm not trying to be mean here - but lets put some valuation to the money you spent on the theme. if you made a theme like they make, and wanted all the perfection you're asking for - i think you'd be paying more like 500 a theme. 

so in seriousness - have we forgotten the valuation factor? what do you value the bump in progress that a less than a 100 bucks a year theme subscription gives you? knowning that the theme bases aren't for everyone - but for a small church or organization to get the look that a theme (from any of the vendors like rockettheme) gives you it's priceless.

oh and one more thing - in the demo site and all the PDF's and source files - it says how to do everything, quite simply too.

personally i view any template as a springboard ... not an end product - what do you think?

I concur with Dan Horning on this topic. "Springboard" is right on target.

For the money, the template clubs such as RocketTheme, YooTheme, Joomlart,
Shape5, etc...
can give you very good design elements and flexibility to create very
professional websites.

Hi Dan

I see your point.

The problem is presenting a product with a misleading display.

In this specific template, there's a position with a Latest News
header, titles, intros and images.

I know Joomla for a while and I know it uses a module mod_latestnews,
usually named Latest News, that displays the title of articles only.

I saw that and wondered: how did they do that? Could it be another
module? Or is it the intro text in the main component? Later I find
it's an article. The only one published on the frontpage. And it is
like a placeholder article, where they hard coded intros from other
articles. OK. Not the easiest solution from my point of view, but...

Then, while looking for another answer on how to replicate what the
demo site displays, I came across an answer from one of the RT Team
claiming things are as they are and that we used to TRY to K2 to
replicate it! This doesn't make sense to me and I felt like they don't
care for their customers.

I went the obvious way: I had the intros display on the frontpage only
with a CSS formatting that does the job. Not quite the same, but it's
looking good on the site.

For me, this template misled me to think they were using Joomla basics
to make things happen. Actually, it was not for real or dynamically
created. It was just a fake article that looked good.

I don't understand why they tried to reinvent the wheel and came up
with a square object and think it's all OK.

Am I being too grumpy here? LOL

with a number of the modules they used they can't bundle them - there is a list to download other tools - and that's not a fault of RT...

there are a whole bunch of RT modules as well that should be installed too - did you download the included ones from the downloads page?

Actually, it's not a missing module issue. No extra module is
necessary to achieve what their demo site shows. It's a bad a approach
to a situation that could had been solved with some CSS formatting. It
misleads us who download it, that we'll have the basics with a twist.
Actually, it is a tweak! LOL

I have to admit that when I first saw this feature a few years ago, I 
thought it was really neat only to be disappointed that the "module" as 
really a special content item...  There actually ARE modules that do 
this tabbed interface without depending on special content items.

That said...at the end of the day I'm completely fed up with all the 
different template clubs.  Each one has made such a convoluted system in 
the feature race, that you basically need to learn Joomla! + specific 
template coding stuff...

One of these days....  on my crackdream list is setting up a template 
library that is just basic template stuff instead of all the "cool" 
features.

OTOH, Joomla Zen Garden templates may deal with this problem in 1.6

Subject: [joomla] Regression testing anyone?
Message-ID: <0c4301cbd6bf$40606d70$c1214850$@covenanttek.com>

Hi All,
I just ran into a situation where after a significant revision to a site by
integrating Community Builder for the extended registration form capability
I missed updating a link in a module and missed it in testing. The client
ran a Google Adwords campaign and the landing page which incorporated this
module didn't work. NOT good. God is good, this happened before the 12,000
emails that go out next week but this still hurt.
The site is fairly complex with over 200 pages of content and a bit of
non-standard functionality.
Are any of you using a web app regression testing suite?
What other means are you using to make sure changes to the code base of the
site don't introduce new problems or re-surface old problems?
Thanks,
Herb
