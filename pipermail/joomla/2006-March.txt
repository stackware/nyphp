Subject: [joomla] General question about using Joomla users table to
	authenticate non-Joomla sites
Message-ID: <99217d100603070743n4e81e279jbe83b7cd633f805d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I'd like  to use the username and password from the Joomla jos_users table
to authenticate visitors to other sites not within the framework. Ideally,
I'd like to have users login to my Joomla-powered site and then store their
login credentials in a cookie. When they surf to a protected non-Joomla site
in the same domain, the other site will read the login details from the
jos_users table and compare them to the cookie. Is there any easy and secure
way to do this?

Thanks in advance,

Rasheq Rahman

I'm new to Joomla and have what I think is a basic question, but I can't 
find a good answer anywhere.  I have an existing web site, at 
mydomain.com.  My homepage is mydomain.com/index.php.  Now I want to 
install Joomla, and take my time learning it while my existing web site 
stays in place.  So I install Joomla into a subdirectory, and I can 
access it at mydomain.com/joomla/index.php, without anybody else knowing 
about it.  That's fine until my Joomla site is ready to go live.  I 
don't want users to have to go to mydomain.com/joomla, so how can I get 
my Joomla site to show up when visitors go to mydomain.com?  Do I use 
.htaccess?  (I don't want the 'joomla' address appearing in the 
browser's address field if I can help it.)  Do I copy everything from 
the Joomla directory up to my document root?  Any other suggestions?  
Thanks,

Bill

I'm sure the Joomla experts will chime, but in the mean time I can offer 
some basic tips.

It should be trivial to migrate from a Joomla install in a subdir to 
have it as your default site. You can either put a redirect in yourself 
or via .htaccess with RewriteBase or Joomla can take care of it through 
the base directory definition.  But you should consider that subdir name 
carefully, since it may be "permanently" reflected in your sites URLs.

So in the future your joomla site can be made accessible at 
www.whatever.tld but deeper content might look like 
www.whatever.tld/joomla/article.html

Therefore choose your dirname carefully. If you site is about widgets 
you might install joomla into a widgets folder so future URLs are like 
www.whatever.tld/widgets/article.html

Of course there are re-write add ons that allow you to rewrite your URLs 
just about however you want, so using those you can eliminate that extra 
subdir from your urls. That's your choice. There is some benefit to 
keepin gthe URLs shallow, and some benefit to keping important thematic 
keywords in your URL.

If you are planning to do your development on that live server (in a 
"secret"subdir), you should take some steps to keep it unknown until you 
are ready to launch it. Add the joomla directory to your robotx.txt with 
an exclusion, to keep the legitimate search engines from publicising 
your content in their results pages. be sure explicitly list your https 
content as well  if you have it SSL access enabled. You may also want to 
install Deny from all/Allow from your IP via Apache to actually keep 
them from indexing your content, and to keep the poorly-behaved bots 
from accessing (more and more of an issue these days).

Personally if you have access to your Apache/shared hosting I would 
setup a separate domain for the trial, install at root level, and 
develop such that you can easily migrate it to another domain name 
instead of doing it on your existing domain.

You can quite simply set it up the way you want. Migrating the entire  
install to the root public directory is quite simple. The only thing  
you should be careful to avoid are using absolute urls.

I usually do all the development and testing in my own computer (laptop) and
when I'm ready I export it to the server.
But, if you want, you can install it on the server and on your first visit
to the administration area you can take the site offline by selecting the
very first option on the "Global Configuration" option.
This way you log in as admin and do what you want, and see the site online,
but everybody else just gets the offline message, and they can't peek.
If you really need to install it on another directory, np, you can mv it
later to root.
Just alter the paths in config.php and it should be fine.

The gigCalendar website is in a crisis due to popularity. I 
know...scratching my head, too!

You may have noticed that gigcalendar.net has been down ever since the 
Joomla! Extensions Directory came alive. (http://extensions.joomla.org)

I am being pushed to move gigcalendar.net to a new IP on a new server 
ASAP. Even though the site is down, the domain is receiving lots of 
traffic...to the point that it is effecting the server I'm on. Not a 
good thing for the kind folks that are hosting the site right now.

Does anyone have access to a server that can host this site? According 
to our host we have constantly been receiving over 250 simultaneous page 
loads. This is too much of a load for a shared server. I'd be happy to 
put google ads on the site and give all proceeds to the person hosting 
the site to help pay for it...but if traffic drops off there may not be 
much revenue from that.


Anyway- gigcalendar.net needs help. If you think that you could help, 
let me know. Otherwise, I think that we'll have to live without the 
website for a while.

Thanks-
Graham

Hi Graham.

I personally can't handle that kind of traffic, but you might look  
into www.westhost.com. They have great rates and a "phat" (pun  
intended) backbone.

Best customer support and administration panel I've seen.

BTW, love that calendar!  Can't wait to get in and customize this week.

Joel.

Hi Graham,

NYPHP can likely help out.  Give me an email offline and we can get you guys
back online by hosting on one of our servers.

Hi Donna (and list),

Of course it is for real, however I am out of the office this week and
have been derelict in my duties regarding email and voicemail.
Apologies to you and anyone else on the list that have had trouble
contacting us.

You can read more about how we used moset's tree to create the 
extensions directory in this thread:

http://forum.joomla.org/index.php?topic=44659.0

No core modifications were made to mtree. The developer, Cy Knight of 
mosets, modified the included template files to achieve the look you 
see. They have chosen to use the savant template system.

Message-ID: <352c93420603120227m11d1afc0w8fb7b3ea6cb130c5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm having a problem with the HTML editor in joomla on certain platforms.
I've tried installing different editors form the mosCE to htmlarea3 (i
think i probably tried all of them.)
The problem is when i go to html in the editor it gives me an empty
field no matter what the content of the site is. This happens in
Firefox, I once had this problem on my own platform and I solved it by
installing a previous version (1.0.7) but one of my students has the
same problem on his laptop and this is not solved even in Firefox
1.0.7 in facts all the text fields in the editor are empty.
It must be some configuration on his laptop, he works on windows XP
just like me, when i visit his administrator from my desktop, I dont
have this problem.
Anybody any experience with this?

Regards,
Debbie Salemink

I had similar problems when Firefox 1.5 came out. I finally replaced
my leviathan Acer with a PowerBook, and have noticed that Joomla 1.0.8
(and the snapshots of the upcoming version) work fine from both
Windows XP and OS X, as long as you have Firefox 1.5.

One thing to make sure, is that if up upgrade from an earlier Joomla
version to make sure the WYSIWYG mambots are the ones that come stock
with 1.0.8 (or greater).

I cannot speak for mosCE, as I have been using the stock one for the
past few months. Anyone else with experience having this problem?

Yikes, don't think that is part of the core - you might want to
unpublish modules until the code goes away, I suspect that is the
source of the error.

If you find it is something in the core doing this to you, please let
me know and I can make sure it gets fixed in the next release.

Hi folks,

Last year Norman graciously provided fortune cookies at the Boston
LinuxWorld booth. This year he is agreeing to provide them again, as
they were such a hit.

So here is your chance to go down in Joomla folklore by coming up with
a funny, cute or pithy line to be on our lovely Joomalicious fortune
cookies...

Hi gang,

I just found out that the folks I thought would be able to produce
LiveCDs for the Joomla booth at LinuxWorld Boston had to travel, and
don't have time to burn the discs.

As a result I'm looking for someone with a duplicator and an hour or
two of time...

Please let me know if you have access to a duplicator, or have a
friend that is easily persuaded and has access to one ;-)

Mitch,

I have access to a small duplicator. It can burn 50 CDs at a time. I'm pretty sure I can help. How many CDs would you need and by when?
