</I>

Zend_Mail is setup deal with email.  The amount of additional 
functionality one would have to add to handle Twitter, IM, SMS, and MMS 
would, in the end, yield something that is less modular, in my opinion.

One could use Zend_Mail as a library for sending SMTP mail through the 
messenger, but it would not be conducive for this goal.

[One thing to deal with for SMS is that you actually need to do it as 
two+ modules, not one.  One module is the basic SMS function which pulls 
the message, checks the users preferences, and then formats the message 
for sedning.  The second module for actually sending is API specific to 
how one chooses to send SMS messages, email gateways, Clickatel, Club 
Texting, one of the free SMS services - in which case you may need to 
truncate more text! - Google voice, Skype, etc]

Now, on the not re-inventing the wheel front, one thing to do would be 
to include OpenInviter:
<A HREF="http://openinviter.com">http://openinviter.com</A>

Open Inviter gives you an API interface for sending messages through 
many different services, including Facebook.  It also gives you the 
ability to capture user credentials for the sender, so instead of having 
a system where you send a FTAF to a friend[ie the message comes from: 
&quot;System Notice&quot; <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/joomla">system at mysite.com</A> and says something like 
:<i><A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/joomla">garyamort at mydomain.com</A> thought you might be interested in.....] it 
</I>instead will come from <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/joomla">garyamort at mydomain.com</A> or from garyamort's 
facebook account.]

And yes, you can forge the from address to make it appear as if it comes 
from the sender, but that runs into a lot of anti spam checker issues 
where now email is coming from the mysite.com mail server from 
<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/joomla">garyamort at mydomain.com</A> - but only mydomain.com is authorized via SPF and 
DKIM to send email for it, so it gets bounced as spam].

But again, Drupal already has most of this so for my own use, I'll just 
use Drupal.

It would be easy enough to port to Joomla....but since it is an 
interface, not component, it would really be a waste of time to do so 
unless there were others who wanted it for their own apps.
