Subject: [joomla] Joomla Job Openings at PICnet
Message-ID: <20060803230659.E21B7A87A5@virtu.nyphp.org>

Hi everyone,

Your Joomla friends at PICnet keep finding themselves very busy, and with
the great turn-out by the community to Non-Profit Soapbox, we've got three
great slots to fill at PICnet:

1) Joomla developer
2) Joomla support specialist
3) Joomla project manager

As usual, we're looking for intermediate to advanced Joomla developers to
come join our team full-time. We'll keep this short and sweet, but if you
enjoy working with Joomla, and you've got the proven skills to develop
components specifically for Joomla, you should be in contact with us.

We're also looking to bring on more Joomla support specialists.  These would
be individuals who have administered Joomla Web sites, understand where to
ask those tough questions in the Joomla community, and who would provide our
clients with our top-quality support they expect as they use their Joomla
and Non-Profit Soapbox web sites.

Finally, for those of you great communicators out there, we're looking for a
Joomla project manager.  This person would work between our clients and
Joomla developers to make sure both sides understand what it's going to take
to make a project a success.  Proven translation of human-to-tech required.

This is full-time work, from the Washington, DC, New York, or San Francisco
Bay Area only.  No consultants, please.

Please send a resume and examples of Joomla sites you've worked on to Ryan
Ozimek at cozimek at picnet.net.

Thanks everyone...please pass the word along!

Best,
Ryan

I use Letterman.  It's free.  It's very basic and simple -- subscribe, unsubscribe, send, publish.

Subject: [joomla] Backing up and moving Joomla.
Message-ID: <cd48cc126c9dd29c7346e15c9bef2187@comcast.net>

Still being new to Joomla, I thought I better ask this question before 
I actually have to do it. :-)

I'm working with Joomla on a CentOS staging server. When the site is 
ready to be placed on a live RedHat server, what is the best way to do 
this?
Do I install Joomla on the live server and then copy over tar'ed 
directories from the staging server or is there a process to manage all 
this already available that I'm not aware of that people are using?

As for just plan old everyday backup, I was thinking of creating a tar 
of the home directory for Joomla. Does doing that capture everything 
needed?

By the way, I enjoyed meeting everyone at the NY PHP users group 
meeting last month as well as the Joomla presentation.

Joomla is relatively resilient, seems to me.  I moved it very quickly  
the other day.  Did a mysqldump of the database, copied the Joomla  
web directory (I used rsync), reimported the database, and checked  
the database settings, and then all was well.

You may want to take a look here:  http://extensions.joomla.org/component/option,com_mtree/task,listcats/cat_id,1758/Itemid,35/
 
Several solutions there which may help to automate and ease your site transition a bit.  I haven't tried any of them myself, but have been through a few test manual site moves and had a few issues with each.  Mostly minor, but time consuming to solve.  I'm thinking of buying JoomlaCloner personally, but will try out the bigApe component as well.

IE 6.0.29 seems ok here. is it displaced on your screen too, too much a the right side or middle?

the source code seems to be clean:
<td class="contentheading" width="100%">
    Winter 2004 - das "echte" Demo        </td>

seems to be some kind of copy via css?!

here's the culprit

<div class="componentheading sIFR-replaced"><embed style="width: 682px; height: 28px;" 
class="sIFR-flash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" sifr="true" bgcolor="transparent" 
wmode="transparent" flashvars="txt= SONGS &amp;textcolor=#990000&amp;hovercolor=#612E00&amp;

src="http://www.court-x.net/templates/js_sifrstain/componentheading.swf" height="28" width="682">
<span class="sIFR-alternate">SONGS</span></div>

in the theme is a flash item and the span class and they were setup to 
echo behind each other but without the 404'd css and your main css being 
corrupted this page wont display right.

if you'd like me to review the site - let me know and we can work 
something out.
i hope this info helps out

Corrupt css

http://www.court-x.net/templates/js_sifrstain/css/template_css.css

the following items are 404'd

http://www.court-x.net/templates/js_prov1_marine/sifr.js
http://www.court-x.net/templates/js_sifrstain/css/sIFR-screen.css
http://www.court-x.net/templates/js_prov1_marine/sifr.js

and your main css is corrupt

Subject: [joomla] looking for logs
Message-ID: <20060819013717.GA22828@localhost.localdomain>

Hi all,

I'm researching on discover botnets, i'm looking or Mambo o Joomla
attacks, it could be seen on your Web server logs ...

I'm lookin specially on the string mosCon on the logs, if you could send
me your logs (filtered if you prefer) i appreciate a lot.

I have some evidence since March of this year, i identified 2 botnets,
but i want to probe the same method with other logs.


you could use this for apache for example :

cd /var/log/apache2
zcat access*gz | grep mosCon | gzip > /tmp/logs.gz


and mail me the file /tmp/logs.gz

Thanks in advice.

Hello,

I want that registered users were able to create a few simple web pages
(possibly of a predefined layout) and the pages were accessible like
http://mysite.com/user. Is there a module to do that?

Thanks in advance,
Baurzhan.

I asked this question on the Joomla forum recently and Ravenswood was recommended: http://www.ravenswoodit.co.uk/

Have not tried it out yet, but it looks good.

Message-ID: <99217d100608231731y417848b7s21641ec18ef1e056@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all:

I haven't been able to find a component / module that does this so I'm
asking here. I'm basically looking to recreate a hardcopy newspaper online
as a Joomla site. One thing I'd like to do is convert the sections of the
paper into Joomla sections/categories and then create individual RSS feeds
for each category and section. Basically, a visitor would click on a
category like sports and see the title of the article plus intro text in a
vertical list and at the top by the Section header it an RSS button would be
created that would link to a feed of all the stories in the category. Any
ideas on how to do this? If not, is this something hard to roll on my own?

Thanks for you help,

Hello,

I am looking for a component similar to yousendit.com.    I need for a 
user to have a secure login where they can address an email and then 
attach a large file(10 MB or more) that will be uploaded to the system. 
The receiver will get an email with download link to that file. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Thanks,

Kirill

Subject: [joomla] Intranet development using Joomla
Message-ID: <bc2960c6b3ab03c7c67fc9b5ee2af9c8@comcast.net>

I've been thinking about using Joomla as an Intranet for development 
projects.
Two main areas:
1)To manage notes about a project, where users on the project can 
create notes in a forum-like format, but have the ability to easily 
re-arrange a posted message into another category if needed.
2) Software tracking system for bugs and feature requests where they 
can have a priority set, assigned to a person and a target date.

I'd be interested in hearing opinions about how to best accomplish this 
from what has already been written.

Thanks in advance,

David Roth

Hi David!

I do not have a response for you but I am going to follow this thread
and see what the Joomla Gurus recommend.  I have also wanted to do
something like this for a group I am working with.  eZ Publish is good
for this but there are a lot of problems using it on virtual hosts
(even paid ones) when Apache is run CGI and not run as an Apache
module. :(

Would be kinda cool to have an "Intranet" version/package of Joomla. :)

I did write an article for International PHP Magazine that outlined
just that, taking a stock Joomla and adding all the additional
components to make it a passable intranet platform. Document
management, calendars, etc.

One thing for sure, if you want to do this without writing much code,
then be sure to base your work on the existing 1.0 series.

However - if you want to build the tools to suit your exact
requirements, I'd strongly suggest you take a long hard look at the
1.5 series, as it is infinitely more powerful in the hands of a
developer.
