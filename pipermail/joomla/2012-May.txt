Check if email cloaking is activated and causing this error on your sites.
(Plugin Manager > Email cloaking)
If you are running 2.5, change the Admin filters to allow you or those who
must to write HTML in your articles. (Configuration > Filters)

Hope this helps

Good luck

I used ninjaboard for a while which works great, but just recently switched to Kunena which is more of a standard forum. 

Kunena, is about to release their 2.0 version which should be really good running on 2.5 install.

HTML5 Boilerplate and mondernizr are libraries used to create HTML5
sites/applications. You would not use these libraries to be used in
conjunction a Joomla template, but rather to design and build Joomla
templates.

The majority of commercial Joomla templates are XHTML. Although, the major
template clubs are slowly rolling out HTML5 templates, notably JoomlArt and
Joomla Bamboo.

The problem is Joomla 2.5's module chrome only supports XHTML. I have been
told that they are working on an upcoming release that will support HTML5.
So right now, if you want to develop HTML5 sites with Joomla, you need to
work with a third party library. This involves changing a lot of the code
in com_content.

The two free frameworks that can be used for developing HTML5 Joomla
templates are: Matt Thomas' excellent Construct framework
http://construct-framework.com/

And Seth Warburton's One Web framework. Note that you can also download
Seth's HTML5 overrides and use them in your own HTML5 templates as I have
done.
http://internet-inspired.com/

JoomlaBamboo has some nice looking HTML5 templates, although I have not
personally checked them out yet.

Thanks Steve.? A couple of follow-up questions, if I may.
"The problem is Joomla 2.5's module chrome only supports XHTML"
Is this a reference to the chrome browser or does chrome refer to a joomla-ism?

I can sort of see where html5boilerplate may be a problem, but I would have thought modernizr would work because all it does is 

test browser capabilities and add a bunch of classes to the CSS.? The additional classes make is easy to degrade a drop shadow, for example
to a plain border.
? "So right now, if you want to develop HTML5 sites with Joomla, you need 
to work with a third party library. This involves changing a lot of the 
code in com_content."
?"Although, the major template clubs are slowly rolling out HTML5 templates,?notably JoomlArt and Joomla Bamboo "
???????????? If I put these two points together, does that mean if I want to use any of the HTML5 templates from JoomlArt or Bambbo, I have a lot of work to do to change the com_content?
???????????? I assume changing the com-content means mucking around with the php code?
???????????? What type of third party library would I need to look for?

Thanks!


Janet Sullivan

Thanks for the kind words Steve!

You hit the nail on the head, and I just wanted to add a few of points.

Joomla's module chrome (http://docs.joomla.org/Module_chrome) can
be overridden, or you can even add your own. We've created an HTML5 module
chrome for Construct5, which you can see at
https://github.com/construct-framework/construct5/blob/master/html/modules.php.
That module chrome, and all of the HTML5 overrides used in Construct5, can
also be downloaded at either
https://github.com/construct-framework/construct5/tags.

Seth's very excellent One Web uses bits and pieces from HTML5 Boilerplate
and Andy Clarke's 320 and Up (
http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/). Seth actually just
pushed a new version of One Web last night, and you can see it live at
http://joomlafuture.com/.

Most HTML5 templates come with a full, or at least fairly comprehensive,
set of overrides. So, you don't need to worry about changing com_content or
other core components or modules.

Along these lines, Joomla 3.0 will be using Bootstrap (
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for the core markup, and as such,
will be HTML5.

Enjoy!

Module Chrome refers to the tags that go around the module placements. For
example,   the most common module tag is style="xhtml", this puts xhtml
tags around the module.

But HTML5 is different from XHTML. So if you used the HTML5 overrides from
Seth's One Web, you would use style="html5" and this would create Module
Chome that will comply with HTML5 standards (although, even HTML5 standards
is a open topic these days).

Sorry about the confusion. Sometimes I make the mistake of assuming that
everyone knows how Joomla overrides and templates work.

No. You do not have to do any coding. If you make your own templates, you
can just drag and drop the html5 override code from One Web or Construct
Framework and drop it into the override directory. The people from One Web
and Construct have done all the coding for you. They have spent all the
time rewriting the code in com_content so it will work with HTML5.

One of Joomla's best features is you can override the core Joomla code by
creating an override folder in the template files. This allows you to
change the core code without touching the actual core code. This way, you
are free to experiment and not worry about destroying the Joomla core code.

By far the easiest way to get an HTML5 Joomla template would be to purchase
one from a commercial company like JoomlArt and Joomla Bamboo. Most of
these companies use Modernizr or something like it so the templates will
work in older browsers.

My apologies for making this topic seems harder than it probably is.

All best,

Steve

Thanks for jumping in Matt.

I can't wait to see Joomla 3.0 with Twitter Bootstrap. It will be great to
have Joomla with  native HTML5 support.

Subject: [joomla] Workflow question
Message-ID: <1337423379.15155.YahooMailNeo@web160403.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

I am building a joomla site using? Yootheme, based on the Warp framework.

?I can't limit my changes to only what the framework/ theme has built in so use firebug to 

?to identify? the css changes necessary.

My problem is that I don't know where I should be putting the new CSS code.? I know how to change the various
css files because firebug tells me the filename and the line number for each element that I want to change. I could
easily go into each file and make the changes.? 
However, is that how I should be working?? For example, I am using a free version of the TK Redemption theme.? Suppose later in the
project I need the premium features of that theme and need to upgrade?? If I have made a bunch of random changes to the css, I think
I may have to start all over with the premium theme.? I think there should be a way to isolate my CSS is a separate place to make upgrading
easy.

What is the proper procedure? so I don't make a mess?
Thanks in advance.? And by the way, this forum (and the NYC Users Group) is GREAT.? Thanks to everyone who has helped this novice
jump start with Joomla!

Your best bet is to add a custom.css file to the template.
Then add it in the index.php
This will solve your issues, but you may have to add the line again in 
the index.php

The one for your template

ie

path-to-site- /template/index.php

the css is

path-to-site- /template/css

Make sure it calls your custom css last.
Look at the index.php file, you will see the other css's listed there.

You can also look at https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms#L38 to see how
the core templates add stylesheets.

Have you checked with the folks at Yootheme? They may have a preferred
method that might also persevere this change between upgrades.

Best,

Matt

Also, some templates (yootheme templates) already have a custom.css file
which you can modify.

In one of my yootheme templates, there is a custom.css, and in the .xml in
the root of the template it refers to the entire css directory so it
automatically includes all of the css files that are naturally there.

In 2.5 (starting in 1.6 i think) in the initial index.php (or whatever base
file the template is using) can now refer to entire directories, so you
don't have to list each file one by one.

Hope this helps.

thanks,

?I found this code in a file called?
tk_redemption_free/layouts/template.config.php

And there already is a "custom.css" file there.? Do you think this is where I should add another
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:mycss.css');

And I should add it just before the print.css statement?

What do you think of adding my css overrides to the end of the existing custom.css and then moving that
$this["asset']?? statement down to just before the print statement?? or is that likely to screw up?

Here is the code from the tk_redemption_free/layouts/template.config.php? file:

// load css
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:base.css');
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:layout.css');
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:menus.css');
$this['asset']->addString('css', implode("\n", $css));
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:modules.css');
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:tools.css');
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:system.css');
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:extensions.css');
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:custom.css');
if (($color = $this['config']->get('color1')) && $this['path']->path("css:/color1/$color.css")) { $this['asset']->addFile('css', "css:/color1/$color.css"); }
if (($color = $this['config']->get('color2')) && $this['path']->path("css:/color2/$color.css")) { $this['asset']->addFile('css', "css:/color2/$color.css"); }
if (($font = $this['config']->get('font1')) && $this['path']->path("css:/font1/$font.css")) { $this['asset']->addFile('css', "css:/font1/$font.css"); }
if (($font = $this['config']->get('font2')) && $this['path']->path("css:/font2/$font.css")) { $this['asset']->addFile('css', "css:/font2/$font.css"); }
if (($font = $this['config']->get('font3')) && $this['path']->path("css:/font3/$font.css")) { $this['asset']->addFile('css', "css:/font3/$font.css"); }
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:style.css');
if ($this['config']->get('direction') == 'rtl') $this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:rtl.css');
$this['asset']->addFile('css', 'css:print.css');

?
Thanks everyone for the helpful suggestions.

The one for your template

ie

path-to-site- /template/index.php

the css is

path-to-site- /template/css

Make sure it calls your custom css last.
Look at the index.php file, you will see the other css's listed
    there.

Matt:

I'm sitting here laughing because "reading the manual" is something that seldom occurs to me, 

yet is so often the solution.? As in this case, when I read the manual I find that Yoothemes offers 

a premium version of the same theme.

The difference between the free and premium is that the premium version has another style sheet file
called "extra-styles" where you can add customizations, just as I want to do.? So simple.? I'm still mildly
curious as to whether or not modifying the tk_redemption_free/layouts/template.config would have worked.
I think I will try it after I get the real client site going.....
And thanks!
?

?I'm writing it 100 times:? Read the manual, read the manual, read the manual.....

You can also look at https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms#L38 to see how the core templates add stylesheets.? 
Have you checked with the folks at Yootheme? They may have a preferred method that might also persevere this change between upgrades.

Hi Janet!

*index.php* should be under your folder *templates/tk_redemption_free*

On the header are you should find a line like this:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/templates/*tk_redemption_free*/css/custom.css"
type="text/css" />

If it's not there, you can create it.

The *custom.css* file should be under *templates/tk_redemption_free/css*

If it's not there, you can also create it.

G'luck!

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_rt=QmQ0sCRxBifZ91HcyGaSEya=svmv2DV+m+2VQWiQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've never bothered with any other template for Admin than what is supplied
with Joomla. But I want to be able to have a non-technical user be able to
edit the content for a category of Articles assigned to them, but don't
want anything else visible to them so they don't become confused or start
to mess around with things which could screw up the pages. Before anyone
tells me that the user should go through training and learn how to manage
things so this doesn't happen, while I would agree, that isn't the case
this time.

Does such an admin template already exist? Or can Joomla 2.5.4 be made
restrictive enough so when this non-technical user logins in they only see
what they need to? Thanks!

You can use Joomla 2.5.x ACL to acomplish that. A little bit tricky, but I
believe it can be done.

G'luck!

Hi David

Give this a try:
http://www.ostraining.com/blog/joomla/joomla-acl-tutorial-for-allowing-one-person-to-modify-only-one-category/

That was written a while ago and there's an extra permission now.

You'll also need to go to Site > Global Configuration > Permissions and give the new user group permission to "Access Administration Interface"

Before anyone tells me that the user should go through training and learn how to manage things so this doesn't happen, while I would agree, that isn't the case this time.

I found this from Jen Kramer (She's GREAT!) in Joomla Magazine. It can be a
kickstart.

Janet,

That's great to hear. I'm in the same boat as you; reading the manual is
not the first thought that occurs to me either (with the exception
of anything by Nicholas at Akeeba as his documentation is phenomenal).

The reason I mention it is that preserving modifications to a file, like
adding a style sheet to your template's index.php, is not something that
Joomla handles well between upgrades. Typically, any modifications, to
files that you install, get lost. We each seem to address in our own
particular way, so each framework might have a special feature for this.

In any case, I'm glad that you worked it out.

Best,

Matt Thomas

Janet,

 

That's great to hear. I'm in the same boat as you; reading the manual is not the first thought that occurs to me either (with the exception of anything by Nicholas at Akeeba as his documentation is phenomenal). 

 

The reason I mention it is that preserving modifications to a file, like adding a style sheet to your template's index.php, is not something that Joomla handles well between upgrades. Typically, any modifications, to files that you install, get lost. We each seem to address in our own particular way, so each framework might have a special feature for this.

 

In any case, I'm glad that you worked it out.

The difference between the free and premium is that the premium version has another style sheet file

called "extra-styles" where you can add customizations, just as I want to do.  So simple.  I'm still mildly

curious as to whether or not modifying the tk_redemption_free/layouts/template.config would have worked.

I think I will try it after I get the real client site going.....

You can also look at https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms#L38 to see how the core templates add stylesheets.  

Have you checked with the folks at Yootheme? They may have a preferred method that might also persevere this change between upgrades.

Make sure it calls your custom css last.

Your best bet is to add a custom.css file to the template.
Then add it in the index.php
This will solve your issues, but you may have to add the line again in the index.php

I am building a joomla site using  Yootheme, based on the Warp framework.

 I can't limit my changes to only what the framework/ theme has built in so use firebug to 

 to identify  the css changes necessary.

My problem is that I don't know where I should be putting the new CSS code.  I know how to change the various
css files because firebug tells me the filename and the line number for each element that I want to change. I could
easily go into each file and make the changes.  
However, is that how I should be working?  For example, I am using a free version of the TK Redemption theme.  Suppose later in the
project I need the premium features of that theme and need to upgrade?  If I have made a bunch of random changes to the css, I think
I may have to start all over with the premium theme.  I think there should be a way to isolate my CSS is a separate place to make upgrading
easy.

What is the proper procedure  so I don't make a mess?
Thanks in advance.  And by the way, this forum (and the NYC Users Group) is GREAT.  Thanks to everyone who has helped this novice

Hi Matt:

Its actually working and I guess it will be preserved across upgrades, but elegant it's not!
Instead of putting all my overrides in a single css file, I have to put them in one of about 8 files.
Kinda clunky when I compare to how the wordpress templates that I have used would have
handled it....
But it works....
I'm still more than mildly curious as to how I could have used your constructs framework instead, but
with tight deadlines, I got the path of least resistance. " In my spare time" I'll crack open framework and see
how it works.??

Subject: [joomla] Joomla 3.0
Message-ID: <CABcNofO8oFfy4mtM1Xvrt_AKTgRZxhFQfOiyrUf4-XRV=TEdtg@mail.gmail.com>

If you have some time, check out Kyle Ledbetter's Joomla 3.0 presentation
that he gave at last weeks' "J and Beyond" conference.

http://www.slideshare.net/pixelpraise/joomla-30-ux-jab-2012

Lots of things to be happy about. (That is, if everything in this
presentation finds its way into Joomla 3.0)

As Matt Thomas told us earlier this month, Joomla is going to use the
Twitter Bootstrap framework. This is great because a lot of developers and
companies are already using Bootstrap. Now that it will be shipping with
Joomla, they will more likely consider Joomla because they are already
using Bootstrap. (FYI: Bootstrap is a responsive CSS/HTML/jQuery framework
developed by the UI folks at Twitter. It was originally developed for use
with Twitter's in-house projects, and they decided to share it with the
world.
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ )

Another great development is Joomla 3.0 is going to be jQuery friendly.
This is fantastic because Joomla's current javascript library, MooTools is
not well supported and used as jQuery. There are far more jQuery
developers, plus jQuery has better backward compatibility than MooTools. I
am sure that MooTools will continue to ship with Joomla, but only used in
the back end.

Improved admin back end design. Let's face it, Joomla's current and
previous back-ends are not nearly as pretty and user-friendly as the one
that ships with WordPress, but Kyle has done an amazing job cleaning it up
and making it more user friendly. I have been told by more than one user
that Joomla's back-end can be intimidating. I was impressed by the new
back-end design in Kyle's slides.

Kyle has also done an amazing job designing the Joomla responsive (mobile)
template which is based on Bootstrap.

We are very lucky to have Kyle working on Joomla. I have been using his
AdminPraise and ProjectFork templates for years and it is great that he is
using his amazing talents to improve Joomla core. I met Kyle and his wife
at Joomla Day NYC 2011. He is super friendly and he loved his first trip to
NYC.

Hopefully, we can bring him back this year.

All best,

Steve

Thanks to both of you! Those articles were very helpful. I had not gotten a
chance to check out the ACL feature in Joomla until now.

I was wondering while reading it, is there a way to replace the "help" tab
so it links to custom documentation for the user instead of the Joomla
documentation and links? Thanks!

That looks very useful, thanks!

I can't help from wondering if someone has created an entire extension that
is a replacement for the back-end that incorporates all these features
without having to make changes in the code. If not, maybe there should be?

I find the back-end template waaaaaay more complex to fiddle with.

I know of only two so far:

- AdminPraise Lite from the guys who make ProjectFork. There's a premium
version that seems to have more configuration options.
- Mission Control from RocketThem

There's the two that ship with Joomla (BlueStork and Hathor), five more in the article below and three more linked in the comments:

http://www.ostraining.com/blog/joomla/joomla-admin-templates/

There's also a few more floating around including the work done on this Joomla distro: http://squareonecms.com/. Quite a few of those changes might make Joomla 3.

But I want to be able to have a non-technical user be able to edit the content for a category of Articles assigned to them, but don't want anything else visible to them so they don't become confused or start to mess around with things which could screw up the pages. Before anyone tells me that the user should go through training and learn how to manage things so this doesn't happen, while I would agree, that isn't the case this time.

Message-ID: <1338497210.38737.YahooMailNeo@web160401.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Is adding multiple menus to a single module position an "ok" thing to do?
Or will I cause myself grief as I build out the site?? 

What about adding 2 different menus to the exact same place in a module, each menu will show only on selected pages?Can that work?? Or am I setting myself up for a train wreck?

Also, what tools do folks use for testing multiple browsers?

Thanks in advance for the advice.

Hi Kirill,

 

Could you please tell me at what number I can call you, I have tried to find
over the net

Contact phone but with no access. I would like to present my team, for
Joomla projects.

I personal think phone contact is best than simple email communication.

 

Best Regards,

Sasa

Janet,

I have done that but used different menu modules - this way you can control
position, font, color.   This way you can have Help, Contact on the right in
small font and the main menu on the left  in bigger font.  

It is a tricky configuration.

Hmmm.....not sure I understand what you are telling me....can you elaborate, or use an example?
I can send you the link to the site that I am building if that would help....

I tried using different module positions for the various menus, but had difficulty? getting all the menus to show
in the the right? place on the page...that's when I opted to put the menu all in the same module position.? The menus
all have different font, icons, etc. but I thought I could do that with the menu suffix class.....

Thanks for taking the time to advise...

?
Janet Sullivan
