&gt;<i>From October onwards, out meeting date is now the second thursday of 
</I>the month.

Date:
October 11th
6PM to 8PM

Location:
Robert Half Technology
245 Park Avenue, 25th Fl.
46th - 47th St.
(near grand central)

We have room for 50 people. People will need to RSVP in advance so we 
have a list for security, and you will need some form of photo id onhand 
for security.

We will be setting up a website and an RSVP form over the weekend, for 
now you can simply email me your RSVP and I'll manually add you to the list.

Schedule:
Our last meeting was a long presentation about Joomla in general. So 
this time around, I'd like to aim to have a number of quick 
presentations and we can alternate meetings going forward(big 
presentations followed by short presentations, etc). We will aim for 4 
small presentations, with the first 2 being geared for a more user 
level, and the last 2 for developers. Anyone who willing to do a short 
15-20 minute presentation, please contact me.

Therefore, our schedule will be:
Session 1: 6:00-6:20 - Community Builder, what it is and what it is not
Session 2: 6:20-6:40

JUG/SIG Planning: 6:45-7:15.
To discuss: Community Website plans and needs
Community Projects

Session 3: 7:20-7:40
Session 4: 7:40-8:00


Presentations:
At the last meeting, I noticed some discussions on building a 
&quot;community&quot; website, and the component that get's mentioned frequently 
is Community Builder. Community Builder, by itself, doesn't provide 
much in the way of &quot;community&quot; features, but it is a strong basis for 
such websites. So I'd like to do a brief review of the features of CB 
to begin with, along with thoughts on what it allows you to do as far as 
community websites are concerned.

If there is interest in it, after the meeting those who don't need to 
rush home could go over to TGIF's (or suggest an alternate?) to hang out 
for a bit.

The nearest one seems to be:
47 East 42nd Street

After all, not having run a meeting before, I believe I made a mistake 
and owe Mitch a beer for being kind enough to do our first 
presentation(and yes, I suppose the offer extends to anyone presenting 
at the next meeting. :-))

Let me know what the level of interest is and if it is large enough we 
can make sure to get a reservation(and if any of you NY natives have a 
suggestion for someplace better, feel free to speak up!)

I have some experience with this as I helped setup www.nnjastd.org (drupal version due oct07). There is also a good article by Ohio State <A HREF="http://webgarden.osu.edu/buckeye2007.pdf">http://webgarden.osu.edu/buckeye2007.pdf</A> They used Joomla to build up their community site.

A forum(fireboard?) -YES
A notification list(yanc?) - YES
An event calendar(???) - YES
An RSVP system for signing up for meetings(???) -YES
A PMS system of some sort - Don't these things bug out on a monthly basis? ;P

Mos Def put some tutorials up or at least some good feeds.
How bout job postings and member dir for prof networking?
Maybe a cart for purchasing training events even if $0 (be nice to have some free training events hosted by volunteers). I'm biased to training b/c I'm in eLearning.

speaking of which Colin Moock is giving a FREE, that's right FREE training on AS3 <A HREF="http://www.adobeas3tour.com/">http://www.adobeas3tour.com/</A>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed

We're setting up a website for the Joomla SIG, I was wondering what 
features people would like to see, and what components they like for 
those features?

Off the top of my head, we should have:
A forum(fireboard?)
A notification list(yanc?)
An event calendar(???)
An RSVP system for signing up for meetings(???)
A PMS system of some sort

Whatever we use should work under legacy mode on 1.5 at the least, and 
perhaps for our first few projects if we use GPL components we could 
upgrade them to the 1.5 model.


So any thoughts on the best/simplest modules to meet these needs?

If you do a presentation on Community Builder, don't you need as well:
CBJuice: a great product to import user records into community builder
JACL Plus: I think that is it, to actually work with groups, etc. 

At another section you may want to focus on shopping carts, such as VirtueMart, which is fantastic!
