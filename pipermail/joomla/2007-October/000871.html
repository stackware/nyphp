<PRE>Well JoomlaDayEast was pretty fun, and even informative too. Someone 
took pictures at the end not sure what they were for.
Hopefully the 2 Joomla user groups websites will be posted shortly, yes...?

Funny thing is, no one there was able to figure out the one question I 
had, involving Joomla php sessions and browser redirects. I have a 
number of Joomla 1.0.12 sites up and running and they all work fine, 
except for one of them. This one keeps generating browser errors. In 
Firefox it says it detected an infinite redirect (&quot;in a way that can 
never be completed&quot;) while in Opera, it just says its been redirected 
and you have to click the redirect link that Opera generates. When the 
page does open it has the session ID appended to the URL like so: 
<A HREF="http://myjoomalsite.com/?de17e6e8.">http://myjoomalsite.com/?de17e6e8.</A> Finally, if you are on any subpage in 
the Jomla site, if you refresh the page it kicks you out to the main 
index.php.

Frustrated I blew out the whole root directory and reinstalled Joomla 
from scratch. Unfortunately it is still exhibiting all of the above 
session weirdness. I did import the old database, so one might infer 
that's where the problem is. But where? And moreover how to solve it?

I was kind of expecting the event billed as JoomlaDayEast to be a day 
for developers, but they were few and far between on Saturday. Not that 
it wasn't fun, but when you are trying to get the kinks out of something 
like this, it was just a little frustrating to have so few people there 
with any real php (or sql) experience.

If anyone on the list has some ideas on figuring this out, I would be 
very appreciative.

cheers,

Forest M.
