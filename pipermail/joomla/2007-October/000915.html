<PRE>The only company I recommend for reliability is FutureQuest.

<A HREF="http://www.futurequest.net">http://www.futurequest.net</A>

You get SSH access, you get reliability, but you don't get cheap(lowest 
priced plan is 10/month for 300MB of diskspace and 5G transfer a month).

You can choose between MySQL v4 or v5, PHP v4 or v5, and you can choose 
between MySQL and Postgress(but not both).

(I even have an affiliate link if you want to use it and throw me some 
cash, just go through the link on my wife's photo gallery, 
<A HREF="http://www.saplings.us/gallery">http://www.saplings.us/gallery</A> - sorry for the spammed advertising all 
over it, I use it as a test ground for different things - had to figure 
out how to modify Menalto's templates to include google ads at one point 
in time).

They have great service and don't oversell their accounts, however they 
are also proactive so if you have a very active Joomla site that is 
burning CPU they will ask you to upgrade your plan to one where you 
aren't impacting other customers).

Outside of FutureQuest, in NYC at least over 10 years ago was Panix, I 
think they do shared hosting as well as dedicated and the way they were 
run at the time I trusted them(they were one of the few hosts at the 
time that had internal customer forums where customers could B&amp;M at each 
other and such.  I wonder if their still running them using NNTP?)  So 
if I was looking local, I'd go with Panix again.  But again, their not 
what I'd call cheap in this day and age.
