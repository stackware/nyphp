One more to add, specific to the number of production sites one
launches - are they:

1) Shared hosting
2) Dedicated hosting
3) Multiple server
4) Cloud

Subject: [joomla] Work Order Component
Message-ID: <4AEEED72.2010007@wolpow.com>

Does anyone know of a work order component?
I know I could modify Billets to do this, but I was looking for other 
possible choices.
What I need is to be able to post a work order for clients to agree and 
sign.
I also would like to assign jobs to workers [this part is not needed yet]

Any ideas?

Have you looked at Web Amoeba?

You might want to write your own agreement plugin  to extend the component
and you're most likely going to need a decent acl system in place so you can
define your client and worker roles.

You might want to try nbill.com. It is no longer listed on JED, but it
allows for very granular service/billing capability.

You may also want to look at Jforce (www.extremejoomla.com). It is a suite
with billing, lead/contact and project management. Might be what you need.

Hope this helps.

Does anyone know of a solution to limit the number of times an article or
item can be viewed? Sort of like you have with banners/ads/impressions?

In other words to  allow you easily to set the max page views for any given
item/article, and when it reaches the limit, the content is unpublished or
access denied.

ps- on a completely unrelated note, I was wondering what it would take to
get some nice Joomla stickers, and why you never see any of those?!

You can write a plugin that takes care of that - basically before you
render the article you check the number of views, and if it exceeds a
limit (also stored as a plugin parameter) unpublish and
return/redirect/whatever.

http://docs.joomla.org/Developers#Plugins

Is that what you're trying to do?

Yes, and only half surprised no one knows of something like this already out
there.

(explanation: In this case the client wants only a limited number of views
to be possible, so they can sell access to content in limited quantities.)

Follow up questions:

1.How about a download extension for J that allows you to set max downloads?
(not per user, but max times that content piece itself can be downloaded?)

2. On a more counter-intuitive note, how about an extension that allows you
to charge users to view banners/ads? If this sounds like just the sort of
funny thing only I could dream up, it is. Yes, I want to charge people to
view ads, youze gotta problem wit dat?  :-P

Oh, big PS, we are having a 'big' Drupal pre-conference party on Friday
evening December 4th, at House of Brews on West 51st with complimentary
food. I've been asked to extend an invitation to any/all attendees of Joomla
Developer Days that same weekend to attend. I'm talking to Elin about this,
but just wanted to give everyone a heads up, we have the entire upstairs
floor for the party.

cheers,

There are tons of subscription extensions out there, now that I
understand what you're trying to accomplish.

Sounds like fun. Not sure I'm attending either event - but a pint or
two with good conversation trumps most other possibilities ;-)

Yes, and only half surprised no one knows of something like this already out
there.

(explanation: In this case the client wants only a limited number of views
to be possible, so they can sell access to content in limited quantities.)

Follow up questions:

1.How about a download extension for J that allows you to set max downloads?
(not per user, but max times that content piece itself can be downloaded?)

2. On a more counter-intuitive note, how about an extension that allows you
to charge users to view banners/ads? If this sounds like just the sort of
funny thing only I could dream up, it is. Yes, I want to charge people to
view ads, youze gotta problem wit dat?  :-P

Oh, big PS, we are having a 'big' Drupal pre-conference party on Friday
evening December 4th, at House of Brews on West 51st with complimentary
food. I've been asked to extend an invitation to any/all attendees of Joomla
Developer Days that same weekend to attend. I'm talking to Elin about this,
but just wanted to give everyone a heads up, we have the entire upstairs
floor for the party.

cheers,

Hi Everyone,

I hope you all will consider coming to the Joomla! Development Conference on December 5 and 6, on the campus of Columbia University.  We have an amazing lineup of people (all 4 development coordinators: Louis Landry, Ian MacLennan, Sam Moffatt and Mark Dexter) plus Andrew Eddie, Hannes Papenberg from the 1.6 release team and Aaron Newton from the Moo Tools core team. Plus more amazing people to hear and to network with.

Here's the information

Out of curiosity, are there any overviews on what changes going from 1.5 to
1.6?

As hopefully[knock on wood] my wife's surgery will be any monday now, I'm
not about to commit to being away for 2 days at any time till those doctors
get their schedules coordinated and that gets done.  But an overview of
changes would be nice.  Especially if there are functions being dropped
where there are perfectly valid alternates in 1.5 that will be in 1.6, we
can start coding with what works in both today.

Subject: [joomla] How to learn Drupal
Message-ID: <4bffc350911120157x3fb705c2rd5c1e63c9290dc20@mail.gmail.com>

I am just about ready to throw in the towel.

No, I'm not giving up on Joomla, Joomla is still my preferred CMS.  But
Drupal is so widely used[and has the BIG benefit in my book of wisely using
JQUERY instead of Mootools.   Mootools is, in my book, easier to code in and
better in general.  But due to their fixation on not using a namespace, it
is a poor choice for a CMS where you want a wide number of different people
writing and producing extensions for your CMS.  You use mootools when you
have control of a  project and can insist everyone uses it.  You use JQUERY
when you don't know who else will be writing code integrated with your
project and can't insist on anything.]

Sooo, I have decided it is time that I learn how Drupal works, how to code
for it, etc.

I can hack an existing installation and fix bugs/add small features just as
quickly as any other home brew PHP design, but I don't really /understand/
it.

Drupal, in short, doesn't "sing" to me.  Joomla sings to me.  Sometimes
somewhat out of tune or harmony, but since I don't sing in tune or in
harmony that doesnt bother me.

I was curious if any of the Joomla developers/users here who also use Drupal
might speak of their experience/mindset with Drupal.  Do you have a mental
map in your mind, like "Joomla has templates located /here/, Drupal has
templates called X located /there/"  Kind of like how one might, say,
associate two western european languages in one's mind by their
similarities.

Or do you just treat them as two completely seperate beasts so as not to get
caught up in "Joomla has X, so Drupal must as well." and "In Joomla there is
no way to do X, so there must not be a way to do it in Drupal either"?

Hi Guys...leaving for the city in a few minutes.  Just wanted to say hope to
see you all at the meeting tonight.

Depending on bus schedule, I may be leaving between 7:30 and 8.

Alternatively, if my MiL is right, I'm going to need to catch a 10:30 bus so
I will have to kill a few hours after the meeting.  Does anyone know offhand
where is a good place to go to do so?  My daughter(Eva, age 11) is going in
to the city to go to an American Girl event at the store with her
grandmother, so she is meeting me after the meeting and we are going home
together.  Wherever we kill time has to be kid friendly.  I was thinking the
borders book store on the westside, but I'm not sure if that is close enough
to the bus station or not.[Sadly, I am on the WRONG side of the river to
take the train].

Just got word that the video that was captured was not usable, due to
a poor camera.

I streamed the opening session but never recorded it, so I never got
to see it online (blush).

Rest assured the developer conference next month will have live AND
recorded video.

This sounds like a call for Forest, who straddles the fence like no other!

Brings up a point, maybe we could have a session at a NYCJUG that
covered other CMS platforms for comparison? Maybe have Forest do a
"blackbelt Drupal" session, and then pick another CMS and start a sort
of series?

Bookstore is a great idea - I'd recommend taking her to the Strand in
Union Square, as a bookstore is a bookstore, but the Strand is an
experience! They have a great children's section - and you have Trader
Joes & Whole Foods nearby for grabbing healthy snacks and whatnot.

If you're there early enough you can hit the bald man for a hot cocoa.
It IS getting colder outside ;-)

You also have Forbidden Planet, which is also a bookstore and a client 
of mine.
There are also a few museums in the area or further downtown, such as 
the Museum of the American Indian.

That's the problem - Penn Station is great if you're into karaoke bars
or Irish pubs. Not kid friendly to say the least.

Kid friendly: Jim Hanley's Universe, a really nifty comic book store.

http://jhuniverse.blogspot.com/

More kid friendly: The Compleat Strategist, a board/card game store.  
(I don't know what their hours are.)

Food: Koreatown.

be she just hates going with Raffi cause he goes for all the gun games.

The shuttle cannot take you from times square to port authority, and the
bookstore by lincoln center is open till midnight and had the next book in
eva's series.

Caught the 11:30 and will be home by 2am.  Hopefully my wife will be asleep
and i will live to see tomorro.

Gah, getting back at 2am is leaving me drawing a blank on the company and
product name.  I had a couple questions, if someone could forward them on
directly in case they don't read this forum I'd appreciate it.

Also, if he could change his name to match the spelling of my son Raphael it
would REALLY help me remember how to spell his name, :-)

Great meeting guys, and the presentation was wonderful.

Something which may have been mentioned in the meeting, is there going to be
a beta test period of the free version of the software and if so, is there
any way we can sign up for it?

I cannot recall what the other question I had was but I assure everyone it
was highly insightful, bordering on the profound.

One last thing, Forest thanks again for your concern about my meds.  I am
looking into alternative methods and sent you email with more details on the
topic.  Any ideas you may have would be appreciated.

Rafael, thanks for a great presentation.  I already emailed someone about your system and LessAccounting.  

Can you upload a copy of the slides to the JoomlaNYC.org site?  Thanks!

Gah, getting back at 2am is leaving me drawing a blank on the company and
product name.  I had a couple questions, if someone could forward them on
directly in case they don't read this forum I'd appreciate it.

Also, if he could change his name to match the spelling of my son Raphael it
would REALLY help me remember how to spell his name, :-)

Great meeting guys, and the presentation was wonderful.

Something which may have been mentioned in the meeting, is there going to be
a beta test period of the free version of the software and if so, is there
any way we can sign up for it?

I cannot recall what the other question I had was but I assure everyone it
was highly insightful, bordering on the profound.

One last thing, Forest thanks again for your concern about my meds.  I am
looking into alternative methods and sent you email with more details on the
topic.  Any ideas you may have would be appreciated.

I remembered my oh so profound "question". :-)

I was curious if with the release of the store, there will also be a section
of their website set aside for people to post extensions[like the Joomla
extension directory] for the product.  If so, will there be any
philisophical limitations to said directory[GPL only, unencrypted only,
etc]?

By the same token, will there be a directory for consultants who work with
their product to post their contact information?

Not being familiar with their current products, maybe this is something they
already do so it will just inherit that.

Dunno about your specific need, but here is my opinion on linux flavors for
servers:

CENTOS - has some nasty little gotcha's due to their default configuration
and emphasis on security.  Install packages for std web dev packages are
years out of date requiring you to use non-secure repositories or compile on
your own to have up to date good.  Not good for the small company.  Can
provide professional level support needed by mid to large companies.

Ubuntu - good overall mix of packages, slightly offputting user command line
tools, but overall quite good.  As long as you have a decent linux community
to bounce questions off of, my choise of OS for server.

Fedora - not the greatest server, but many of the benefits of CENTOS without
the years out of date part.  Good for those coming from a windows background
to pickup and use.  Requires a somewhat beefier server than Ubuntu unless
you really know what your doing when you choose what parts to install.  I
just take everything and let it eat hard drive space.

That's it.  I used to have a slight preference for Debian over Ubuntu, but
there are more how to's for what I want to do for Ubuntu so that gave it the
edge.

Use CentOS - you'll get RH experience and a solid OS.

Ideally I need the RHEL 4 environment as my current servers are running 
them for now.
I am planing working on optimizing the platform and customizing for my 
needs.
Later I will move to a platform of my choice.

Scott;

You're on RHEL 4 because that's what's being run now; is there a patch 
process so that the servers are updated? I believe PHP has gotten some 
patches in the past year or so.

RHEL 4 is out of full support mode and into the "we provide patches when 
  there's something really security critical" mode. Recommend you 
upgrade to RHEL 5 which has PHP 5, as soon as practical. However, keep 
in mind you're going from PHP 4.3.9 on RHEL 4 to PHP 5 on RHEL 5. Might 
be some testing needed.

If you need to be on RHEL then use CentOS. The security "gotchas" 
mentioned are inherent in RHEL. Check your existing servers 
/etc/selinux/conf file to see if SELinux is enabled, or what. You also 
want to look at IP tables, most likely. Both can be turned off easily, 
though having them on might be good for a public facing server.

If you want to get ready for RHEL 6, due out in Q1 or so, wait a few 
days and get Fedora 12.

Feel free to ask any RH questions you want, makes me feel useful.  :)

It wasn't until I saw the group name for the yahoo group that I realised what a poor choice of words Joomla User Group is.

NYC JUGs  :-)

Trying to put the date in Module User4 of the RHUK template. Not sure 
how as my "Custom HTMML" code fails:

  	<?php echo date( '(T) dMy  H:i '); ?>

Suggestions?

Also, any ideas why TinyMCS shows the URL link grey'd out?

Thanks!

Does your editor allow you to add php code?

Using TinyMCE, don't know. Would guess not, though a CMS in Joomla might 
understand PHP.  :)

Sounds like I need a new editor. Suggestions?

Your post said TinyMCS.  I didn't know if that was some souped up TinyMCE or something.

TinyMCE strips out php.  You need JCE editor.

Joomla does not render php code in content items, even though JCE editor will let you put in the code: 

http://www.joomlacontenteditor.net/forum/topic?f=30&t=16620&p=26382&hilit=%20php%20code#p26382

You will need to make your own module to render the php code.  It's very easy if you know a little php: http://iteachme.com/list-of-all/all-tutorials-by-title/40-module-development/1074-module-development-intro

Subject: [joomla] Weird forum feature I'd like
Message-ID: <4bffc350911151756h498166c3u453c84804c8499a9@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for a Forum system where  one could run multiple forums on
different independent website and sync boards between sites.

For example,  maybe you want to have a
JoomlaNYC forum
JoomlaCT forum
JoomlaBoston forum

And each site would have a set of boards specific to themselves, and then a
set of boards shared between all sites["northeast joomla events" for
example] so a post to one site gets synced to all sites.

It would have to be in such a manner that the sites are truly independent -
ie you can have different site "owners" and they merely authorize the other
site to sync to them.

It would also be best to have a method of sending Private Messages between
sites.

For those who remember the ancient days of 1200 baud modems and local
BBS's...think "FidoNet"

Anyone know of a forum with this set of features out of the box?  The
closest I can think of is FUDforum.

-Gary

Hey Donna, thanks!

With a bit of effort I got DirectPHP to work in an article. Haven't gone 
  over the module stuff yet but that'll be next. Have to figure out how 
to make the page see the date in the Timezone I want it to, not in the 
physical one it's in.  :)

The Global Config is set where I want it but it's still showing a 
different timezone. Might have to fake it, but would prefer a simple 
solution.

Have you tried JIncludes?

So far, it works great for small code like that!

No we are an association.
Our next step may be a type of non-profit.

The hardest type is IRS approved NP.

I think the legalities are there and solid. However, bookkeeping is 
supposedly to be unholy. Also, you don't do the forms right it's $1,000 
per day until they're done right.  UGH!

I am actually a trustee for a non profit group.  Registration is the  
hardest part and really requires a lawyer.  However there are some  
responsibilities as you are basically forming a corporation.  There  
are officers and boards.  They have legal responsibilities.  Filing is  
less complicated if your gross donations are less the $25000 per year  
probably your case. Book keeping is no more complicated than any other  
business good accounting principles apply most every where. Google Pro  
bono partnership it is a good place to seek representation for non  
profits, also google legal responsibilities of non profit trustees.   
It is not a simple process and you'll need to consider if it is  
something worth while for your group to do.

The main reason I bring it up is since I'm working with my kids school -
http://www.hudsonvalleyschool.org[they are a non profit... profit, HAH,
we're lucky not to have a deficet! ] and integrating some services with
Joomla for them.

For example, Google will provide non profits with free use of their Google
apps - which includes the API.  One of those apps is email, so you can give
people the same function of gmail but with your own domain[so you can have
members.mydomain.com and board.mydomain.com and give people addresses in
there as appropriate].  Google actually provides that for free anyway to
small groups, but then you have to use their fitzy interface to add/remove
accounts/addresses.

With the API, I am going to setup a plugin for Community builder, so we can
have a "user type" field of checkboxes, with "member", "staff", and
"student" as checkboxes[ie a member can also be staff].  When the user is
saved, a little program can check for which of those fields are active and
go create/remove gmail email accounts for that person in the appropriate
domains.

That way they don't need to learn an interface, they can just click a
checkbox and be done.

But the first step for other groups for something like this would be
registration....and for that someone has to be willing to volunteer their
unpaid time to work on both determining what ongoing time commitments are
required, but what initial time and money requirements are needed.

As a relative outsider who comes in at most once a month, somewhat
hypocritically I'm not volunteering my time(outside of saying if you do do
the paperwork, I can certainly do the google app signup and give you the
code to integrate when I'm finished at the school), just throwing the idea
out there.

As a somewhat offtopic note on this...  I noticed that Google Wave has a
form for organisations to profess interest of setting up the same service
under their domain, similar to how Google apps run today.  So sometime in
the future, you can setup wave.mydomain.com and point that domain over to
Google Wave and have it all branded under your domain.

Which has gotten me thinking about Google app/Joomla integration more, as I
see it as a stepping stone to Google Wave/Joomla integration.

My apologies, I raised the question on a dual purpose and only one was
explicit.  The explicit is here are some cool ideas the Joomla group could
pursue as a non profit.

The implicit was here are some cool ideas for any non profits, so any
feedback from people who work with non profits if things like setting up
email addresses for people from within Joomla, calendar, etc but using the
Google apps as a backend sound interesting/useful.

I should also mention, this is not limited to non profits.  Anyone can
upgrade a Google apps account to do this, it's just regular businesses pay
50/per user/per year for it[prorated, so if you have 10 users at the start
of the year, and 5 leave and 5 new ones come on, you only pay 500 for the
year not 750!]

Hi Gary,
I am working with a non-profit - a school, where we have removed their 
html calendar from their website, and replaced it with a public Google 
calendar.  Now anyone (that is authorized) can add events to the school 
calendar, and they do not have to wait for the annoying web designer 
(me) to update it.  Also parents, teachers and students can add the 
school calendar to their personal Google calendar or Outlook, or to 
their iPhone or Blackberry, so they always know when the school is 
closed or there is an after-school activity planned.  We are also 
working on setting up that if an event is planned, everyone who has 
subscribed to the calendar will get an notification.  Therefore school 
closing due to school can be easily relayed.

The one problem that I am having is that Joomla does not seem to work 
with the Google Calendar very well.  I have tried to insert the 
Google-supplied code in a custom HTML module, as well as an article with 
the html code, but it will not show the calendar.  I am sure there is 
probably an extension available, but why wouldn't a custom html module 
work?  Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Jon

Jon:

I recently found the gCalendar component on the Joomla Extensions site (I
think).  It seems to work pretty good (after you figure out which code to
add for the calendar) and supports multiple calendars on a single Joomla
site.

Here is a link to the components website:

http://gcalendar.laoneo.net

Paul

P.S. feel free to drop me a line (off list) and I will dig through the site
I added this to and get the right "formula" for the code to add for each
calander.

Well, I was not aware there is a problem, but that may explain why the
school web programmer did it the way he did.  He used Google calendar and
set it up as  a popup on the website, instead of loading it inside the
website.  You can check that out on the mainpage,
http://www.sudburyschool.org  , by clicking on the calendar link at the top.

So maybe that would work for you?

Keep in mind the school is in Ulster County, so that means we have a large
number of parents and staff who are primarily artists.    So my problem, and
what got me thinking of this, is that the google calendar interface is just
a little too confusing for them.  Thats why I want to streamline it using
the Google API, so they can enter just 3 fields of data, and I'll use all
the defaults and post it via the API to a google calendar.

Subject: [joomla] Jumi and php help
Message-ID: <ebd63fae0911240742i21075309h25bea875ecefc7dc@mail.gmail.com>

I need help with someone who knows php. I have installed Jumi for
Joomla 1.5. I found a php script for a type of calculator that I want
to use. (I can't write php). It has a form to enter data and then it
returns the results of the calculation in a table. Outside of Joomla
it functions fine. I have tried both putting the script directly in
the jumi component application as well as the path (after uploading
the script file and allowing permissions). The form shows up fine, but
when I try to execute the calculation, it goes to a new page with a
404 error. In the address bar, I see that same string of characters
that I see when it works properly out of joomla, appended to the
domainname/testdirectory/filename.php (filename.php being the action
value of the form) . Of course, that isn't where the php script file
is, it is in the components/jumi_com.files directory. I have tried
putting the script in the root folder but then I get the error "Direct
Access Is Not Allowed". I don't know what I am doing wrong.

You can see the page at  http://tinyurl.com/ykwxsrg
I really hope someone can shed some light on this for me. I have
another project coming up where I will need to use other calculators
and I want to be able to do it in Joomla, but I need to understand
where I am going wrong.

Sorry, I don't know how to continue a thread, but Scott, thank you for
responding to my Jumi and php question. As I mentioned, I am not really php
literate. Where do I check where a form loads?
The whole script is in one file, so would it be the form's action value
which is the name of the script file? If so, I have tried using a variety of
paths, including an absolute path to where the file resides as well as the
path that the menu item creates. Can you give me more direction?
Thanks,
Ellen

where the script adds the vars to the URL, you have to add in the Joomla vars for the page.  Someone would have to look at the code to see where it goes.

Message-ID: <651427.23786.qm@web35607.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

First of all, I don't see this option on the Article level.  I see it in the Article's Global Configuration, and in the Menu's link parameters, but not in the Article's parameters.  I believe it's supposed to be an option on the Article level as well.

Second, I have it set to Show in both the Global Config and Menu Link params and it's not showing.

Does anyone have any info about this setting?  Am I missing something?

Found the answer -- this was not meant to show the number of hits on the article layout.  It's for the Hits column in the list layout.

I don't know why this wouldn't be included on the article view as well.  The other params are.

How many pageviews/visitors per day does Joomla.org get?  Is there some place that gives you website stats?  I looked at Alexa but as far as I can see they are only showing percentage/rank.

You really have to quantify that a bit.  Joomla.org can really be considered
3 "sites"

There is the extensions directory, the forum, and everything else.

Dunno if this helps or not, but according to this article back in auguest it
was 5 million pageviews/month

Interesting -- I didn't know ihop.com was a Joomla site.  And they don't even use SEF.  They're on 1.0 and don't have their administrator folder protected.

Anyway, I was trying to find out how limited the audience is for a Joomla support resource site, and how many pageviews it takes to generate how much ad revenue, etc.

"Interesting -- I didn't know ihop.com was a Joomla site.  And they don't
even use SEF.  They're on 1.0 and don't have their administrator folder
protected."

What's the best way(s) to protect the administrator folder?

Thanks.

I used SOBI2 a long time ago and didn't like it as much as Mosets Tree. Is it better now, as far as the layout?

@Donna

"Interesting -- I didn't know ihop.com was a Joomla site.  And they don't even use SEF.  They're on 1.0 and don't have their administrator folder protected."

What's the best way(s) to protect the administrator folder?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <c2f754300911300826n21e4e8a4v34e92f6268a88552@mail.gmail.com>

The first annual Joomla / Drupal weekend conference kickoff & holiday
networking party is this Friday December 5th.

All are welcome to attend: Note, you do *not* have to be a registered
attendee of either the Joomla Developers Conference or the Drupal Camp this
weekend in order to attend.

This party will be held at:

House of Brews
302 W 51st St, New York, NY?

and will start at 6:30 pm.

Appetizers will be served and there will be complimentary drinks (so you
will probably want to arrive on time.)

Full information can be found at groups.drupal.org:
http://groups.drupal.org/node/33058

If you are planning to attend, please take a minute to register & RSVP.

Alternately you can email me your rsvp me directly to be added to the list.

This event is also open to any area CiviCRM developers and is shaping up to
be the Open Source CMS event of the season. ;-)


cheers,

Forest Mars

The first annual Joomla / Drupal weekend conference kickoff & holiday networking party is this Friday December 5th. 

All are welcome to attend: Note, you do *not* have to be a registered attendee of either the Joomla Developers Conference or the Drupal Camp this weekend in order to attend. 


This party will be held at:

House of Brews
302 W 51st St, New York, NY?

and will start at 6:30 pm. 

Appetizers will be served and there will be complimentary drinks (so you will probably want to arrive on time.) 


Full information can be found at groups.drupal.org: http://groups.drupal.org/node/33058

If you are planning to attend, please take a minute to register & RSVP. 


Alternately you can email me your rsvp me directly to be added to the list. 

This event is also open to any area CiviCRM developers and is shaping up to be the Open Source CMS event of the season. ;-)



cheers, 

Forest Mars
