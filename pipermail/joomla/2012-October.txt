Assuming you are workinga a template you've created, you need CSS to
accomplish that.

Get the code from any of the previously installed templates on Joomla.

Subject: [joomla] Looking for an Image Rotation module
Message-ID: <CABr9RmmLFRd0zE_GbPedM8VGE2n0wg7NXKQgXLT9qFko5WF7PQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a collection of about 20 photos, that I would like to display as
thumbnails on a page.  I'd like to display 5 at a time, chosen randomly
from a folder:

[Image1] [Image2] [Image3] [Image4] [Image5]

I've tried a few different image rotation / slideshow modules, but none of
them seem to QUITE fit the bill I am looking for.  Either they only show
one image (and no option for more than one), or they slide the whole pool
instead of statically choosing 5 on load and sticking with them.

I tried the default Joomla 2.5 Random Image Module, loaded 5 times on the
page, but it shows the same image in all 5 loads instead of 5 different
ones.

There's a bazillion modules on the JED - I tried a few and got frustrated,
as each one claimed to do what I want, but was missing something in the
end. :-(

Anyone have a lead on a good module or plugin, that fits the bill for what
I need?

I *think* I've solved my own issue, in a way... but it requires JoomGallery
to be set up, as it's a module that draws from that, rather than from a
Joomla images folder.

Still, it's a good way to go, esp. if you're already using JoomGallery on
your site and want to showcase images elsewhere on your site.

FWIW, I was going to recommend that you take a look at JoomGallery. It's a
bit of overkill for this, but a great solution none the less.

Best,

It's funny - the site I am looking to use this on, is still on Gallery2
bridged with JFusion.  I'm trying to migrate to JoomGallery, but there's
not a migration script... yet.

One of my other sites does use it, though, so that's where I tested it.  As
soon as I can ditch Gallery2 and be on JoomGallery, I'll be good to go.

Message-ID: <008f01cdad4f$9dfc1f20$d9f45d60$@com>

Hi Joomla People,

 

I miss teaching and want to teach a free Joomla Beginners class in a
workshop format.  I am thinking of meeting once a week from 6:30-8:30 for 8
weeks.  Students would have to bring their own laptops.

 

I intend to bring this up at tonight's meeting.  

 

I can do this as part of the JoomlaNYC users group or just put it up as a
Meetup independently of the user's group, so I'd love to get everyone's
thoughts on the matter.  

 

Also, if anyone knows beginners who might be interested, please have them
contact me.

Message-ID: <CALfVZ388aQO=jX+e-3V0mgb2sYkGoYm78Mm=70wqNtEjfAW+XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,
Not my day!!!!
 I have been hacked on a couple of my Joomla sites in the past few days.
All are hosted on 1 & 1 , they are 1.5 and 2.5 sites, all the latest
versions.
The hacks are different. One was redirecting to msn.com another messed with
my htaccess file and something in the backend because oddly enough although
I can see it, the dropdown navigation in the backend doesn't work.The
navigation icons in the control panel do, but once you get to a different
page, the save and close buttons don't work. I am having the host roll back
their backups because mine are not helping.
Has anyone had this experience?
Other than using Admin tools and removing references to Joomla, any
suggestions to securing the sites better?

On a different note, I just tried to restore a backup to a backup site on a
site that was not hacked to test it(I am paranoid now that my backups won't
help if they are corrupted). This site has Hikashop and Easyblog on it. The
restored backup (to a new database) isn't working right. It is fine until
you try to navigate to one of these extensions and I get an error:
Multiple Choices
The document name you requested (/index.php) could not be found on this
server. However, we found documents with names similar to the one you
requested.

Available documents:

/index.html (common basename)

Please consider informing the owner of the referring page about the broken
link.


Any ideas why?


Please make my day better!

Ellen

In case you don't know! I linked to your site by clicking your logo and when
I clicked your menu I got the following response.

 


"Internal Server Error


The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable
to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, webadmin at kundenserver.de and inform
them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that
may have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log.

Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying
to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request."

Having used 1&1 in the past, and having sites hacked when using them, I
changed to a different host and most of my security issues when away. I now
host my own sites on servers that I build and stop most exploits long
before they even get to the website. Any good host will do that too.

Make sure all *extensions* are up to date, not listed at
http://docs.joomla.org/Vulnerable_Extensions_List and passwords are strong.
I know that /administrator on my servers get hit with dictionary
attacks<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack> 100's
of times a day and using Admin Tools secret URL helps with that.

But, your host needs to be doing something better to prevent this behavior
before it gets to your site.

Hope that helps!

Best,

I went through hell for two days as I cleaned up each site, then it
was re-infected. Sucuri charges $89 for one site, $189 (or similar)
for five. My experience was that I needed to clear all sites or I
couldn't prevent being re-infected.

   It was definitely worth paying them when I had a multi-site infection.

I suggest using Bluehost.com and siteground.com as they were  our sponsors.
With bluehost.com when you have an issue, let me know about it after 
talking to support.

I have worked with C level management for almost 10 years now.

I also had a bad experience with 1 and 1, but not with site hacking.  When
I tried to transfer my domain name to a different registrar, the offshore
people I talked to dragged their feet, promising everything but delivering
nothing.  They had all kinds of excuses for not releasing the domain name.
It took several weeks to accomplish it.  They were very unprofessional and
for their size, surprisingly seemed like a small mom and pop company, with
no established procedures in place.

The reason you're getting 500 errors is because of a misconfiguration
concerning SEO friendly URLs, for example
http://www.ebrwebsitedesigns.com/the-process will result in an error 500,
http://www.ebrwebsitedesigns.com/index.php/the-process will display the page
correctly (note the index.php within the URL). It is most likely your
.htaccess file, make sure you have renamed it from htaccess.txt or if it
doesn't exist download another copy or restore it from backup.

Hi folks,
Not my day!!!!
 I have been hacked on a couple of my Joomla sites in the past few days. All
are hosted on 1 & 1 , they are 1.5 and 2.5 sites, all the latest versions.
The hacks are different. One was redirecting to msn.com another messed with
my htaccess file and something in the backend because oddly enough although
I can see it, the dropdown navigation in the backend doesn't work.The
navigation icons in the control panel do, but once you get to a different
page, the save and close buttons don't work. I am having the host roll back
their backups because mine are not helping.
Has anyone had this experience? 
Other than using Admin tools and removing references to Joomla, any
suggestions to securing the sites better?

On a different note, I just tried to restore a backup to a backup site on a
site that was not hacked to test it(I am paranoid now that my backups won't
help if they are corrupted). This site has Hikashop and Easyblog on it. The
restored backup (to a new database) isn't working right. It is fine until
you try to navigate to one of these extensions and I get an error:
Multiple Choices
The document name you requested (/index.php) could not be found on this
server. However, we found documents with names similar to the one you
requested.

Available documents:

/index.html (common basename)

Please consider informing the owner of the referring page about the broken
link.

 

Any ideas why?

 

Please make my day better!

Ellen

As someone who has yet to be hacked (knock on wood), I'd like to ask the
group - what is best practice to prevent this sort of thing?

   - I already have Akeeba Backup and Admin Tools installed
   - I run backups on a daily (DB) and weekly (whole site / server) basis,
   and store them offsite.
   - I've used Admin Tools to secure the ID of the default Admin / Super
   User account.
   - All of my extensions are up to date, and none are on the Vulnrable
   Extensions list.

I've seen a few anti-hacking tools on the JED - are they needed?  Is there
something else I should be installing, or a specific option I should use
when configuring my Joomla sites?

Use a GOOD HOST...

Call you host ahead of time and ask, 'do you support joomla', also find out
their backup procedures...how many backups do they keep, how easy is it to
restore?  All companies handle this very differently, some may charge you
$15 others $150, and others it can be backups by the hour, and you can just
select one...

If the fear is that the hacking will come in through Joomla's Admin, my
advice is to protect /administrator with .htaccess. This puts another login
layer before even getting to the back-end prompt.

Long complex passwords are better. When it comes to selecting a password
for the MySQL database user, make it very long and cryptic. After all, you
won't have to be repeatedly typing that password after installation, so you
won't be troubled with a complex password to remember. Change passwords
frequently. If you use Google Calendar, put a reminder in there to change
passwords periodically.

If someone is hacking in through a method that has nothing to do with your
Joomla installation, but the web hosting service itself, then bolt to a
better service. Web hosting is very cheap now and there is competition so
look to upgrade if you can. Even though I'm not a fan of most shared
hosting services, there should at the very least be a "jail" shell for
shared users. This means that each user can't see anyone else's files or
processes running.
