Subject: [joomla] help - fake users again
Message-ID: <547317.11207.qm@web31815.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I have a client in 1.0.15...

1. Registration was allowed
2. we were getting lots of fake registrations from the ip of churchelo.info
3. I blocked their ip from accessing the site
4. they kept on doing it
5. removed registration
6. finally it stopped

Now, I turned it back on this weekend, now she is getting fake registrations again, here is a sample:
Hello The Childrens School of Yoga,

A new User has registered at The Childrens School of Yoga.
This e-mail contains their details:

Name - TilsOPPOPEsok
E-mail - unesserty at mail.ru
Username - TilsOPPOPEsok

Any idea how I can block the new registartions, but allow her legal contacts to register via virtuemart (I turned on the 'back end registration' through virtuemart, so they aren't using the regular registration page...I was hoping that would help.


thanks,
Laura

Do you have email confirmation required on?

Spammy registrations would not be able to confirm the email address and thus
would never really get into the system...

Are you using Captcha? If so, it is humans, I would block att .ru IP's. 
But they may still have Zombies out there.

The power of Joomla! with Drupal configurability

Joopal permits you to use your traditional Drupal blocks anywhere a Joomla!
module can do and also allows you to integrate Drupal's modules as if they
were a normal Joomla! component. This permits your Joomla! site to pick and
choose the features and functionality you need against two of the world's
most popular content management systems!

You will need to write JavaScript (or use a JS framework) to use AJAX that 
calls a server-side action.

I doubt you'll find anything pre-built for this.

Subject: [joomla] help with SEF - joomla 1.5
Message-ID: <680255.42539.qm@web31805.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I turned on the Joomla SEF with 1.5 and I am running into a weird problem:

site: www.thrillcoastertours.com

1. Some of my menu items don't work, although I have recreated each one by hand to make sure they are the right 'type'.  Check out the menu items inside of media...

2. I am using a latest news module on the right side.  The 'camper letters' work fine, but the From the president items for some reason do not work...I copied the module, and still no go...it looks like the links that are generated from the 'correct' module has component/content/article/17-Notes from the Campers/114-day-6-michigan-adventure, where the ones that don't work the link is broken out as: http://www.thrillcoastertours.com/from-the-president/109-march-2009

Is there something that I have to do at the category or the article level?


thanks,
Laura

Hi everyone,

I'd like to recommend postponing tomorrow's meet, due to many
different things - it is a Jewish holiday so some of us cannot attend,
the speaker (Alex from RSJoomla) and I have not had a chance to
coordinate at all (he may be unaware that tomorrow he is supposed to
be the speaker), and I also have some very urgent things outside of
the user group that need attending.

I've been honored to host the NYC JUG and hope that this doesn't cause
too much disappointment with the group! You've been a great group to
host and I would like to keep it that way.

As such, next week is not possible as we're already hosting WebTechNY
on Wednesday. Can we reschedule this month's meet to Wednesday, April
22? I chose Wednesday as we have folks that have never made it
(classes on Tuesday and Thursday), and I'd love to meet some of these
people...

Again, a thousand apologies, but I have to beg ;-)

Mitch,

That sounds fine to me.  It will be after the holidays so it's convenient for more people.

Thanks so much to you and KickApps for hosting our meetings and arranging speakers.  

I look forward to seeing everyone on the 22nd!

Donna

Mitch,

That sounds fine to me.? It will be after the holidays so it's convenient for more people.

Thanks so much to you and KickApps for hosting our meetings and arranging speakers.? 

I look forward to seeing everyone on the 22nd!

Subject: [joomla] Tomorrow's meeting

Hi everyone,

I'd like to recommend postponing tomorrow's meet, due to many
different things - it is a Jewish holiday so some of us cannot attend,
the speaker (Alex from RSJoomla) and I have not had a chance to
coordinate at all (he may be unaware that tomorrow he is supposed to
be the speaker), and I also have some very urgent things outside of
the user group that need attending.

I've been honored to host the NYC JUG and hope that this doesn't cause
too much disappointment with the group! You've been a great group to
host and I would like to keep it that way.

As such, next week is not possible as we're already hosting WebTechNY
on Wednesday. Can we reschedule this month's meet to Wednesday, April
22? I chose Wednesday as we have folks that have never made it
(classes on Tuesday and Thursday), and I'd love to meet some of these
people...

Again, a thousand apologies, but I have to beg ;-)

-- Mitch

Subject: [joomla] Incorrect Cached URLs
Message-ID: <0ed701c9bc8a$a1ca0590$e55e10b0$@com>

Hello,

Caching it turned on for a site, whereby it's caching the templates for
obvious performance reasons.  Everything works fine, however there are some
occasional problems that crop up.

So if someone hits the correct domain, like www.something.com, and the cache
needs to be built out, everything is fine - the correct URL base is set,
etc. and the cache's links are built correctly.

However, the organization has been having some DNS issues, plus has the
server has HTTPS access and there is no named based virtual hosting on the
server.  Thus at times, strange HTTP hits with the wrong or no virtual host
come to the server, and at times HTTPS hits come to the server.  When the
cache times out, it's of course rebuilt, but now with the wrong URLs.

For the virtual host issue, I've had to add a couple of lines to the top of
the index.php file to pin the $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] to a consistent value
($live_site doesn't work by the way).

However, this issue is similarly problematic for HTTPS requests.  I could
redirect things, I suppose, but is there a better way?  Seems as though this
would be a common problem yet there's no elegant solution that's obvious.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

H

Well there you have it ;-)

You're pretty much forced to do some redirects, and setting up named
vhosts goes a long way to making sure the correct requests go to the
correct place - and therefore the correct URLs get cached.

In the 1.0 series I remember you could hardcode the TLD in your
configuration.php, but in 1.5 the fancypants developers outnumbered
the practical developers (blush)

Ok, I'm going to get beat up for saying it, but I do feel strongly about this.

<rant>

Last year in the Netherlands I dedicated a series of slides on a topic
that has me gritting my teeth: Developer Vanity.

Look, just because you know how to abstract something out into a
helper and then dynamically call methods based on the actions of the
method names called in the parent, doesn't mean you need to do it. And
you certainly don't need to make the rest of us, who predominately
have tight deadlines, have to live in the same fancypants world.

I once used Oracle to store java source in the rows, and then ran a
query that randomly selected a few rows, concatenated the java source,
compiled and executed it all in the database space. Was an
interesting, if not kinky experience. Now, what was the practical
outcome? There WASN'T one. Zilch. It was an academic exercise with
absolutely zero practical value. And most importantly I had the
restraint to know that it was a pointless capability with a severely
limited application, and never tried to bring it out of the realm of
exercise into the world of execution.

I just wished other developers could demonstrate the same restraint.
There is a LOT of code out there that quite simply does not need to
be. Adds bloat, complexity, and generally diminishes the value of
everyone's hard work.

</rant>

With that said, I was wrong about $live_site. I was under extreme
pressure to deliver a major site when they removed that feature
(before the 1.5 framework was final), looks like it made it back into
the framework in just a slightly different place...

You CAN still enforce hostnames by using the JURI class on the front end:

http://api.joomla.org/Joomla-Framework/Environment/JURI.html#base

When looking at the source code, it's right there on line 209 of the
base() method. Pulls the value of $live_site from JConfig. Woo-hoo!

Subject: [joomla] RS Reviews
Message-ID: <c2f754300904231800p397f3acbsa7ebfe1b66beeb1f@mail.gmail.com>

Funny, Alex didn't mention that RS Forms was the most reviewed module for
Joomla! 1.0 on JED. I just noticed that, and would have thought you'd want
to mention something like that?!

I also highly recommend RS Finder for any moderate to large sized sites. It
not only enables you to find any/all content it lets you naviate anywhere in
the administrative interface without a HID (mouse/trackpad.)

cheers,

Well put. 

 

I just liked the idea of using the expression fancypants :-) I think it
should be used more often.

Last year in the Netherlands I dedicated a series of slides on a topic

that has me gritting my teeth: Developer Vanity.

 

Look, just because you know how to abstract something out into a

helper and then dynamically call methods based on the actions of the

method names called in the parent, doesn't mean you need to do it. And

you certainly don't need to make the rest of us, who predominately

have tight deadlines, have to live in the same fancypants world.

 

I once used Oracle to store java source in the rows, and then ran a

query that randomly selected a few rows, concatenated the java source,

compiled and executed it all in the database space. Was an

interesting, if not kinky experience. Now, what was the practical

outcome? There WASN'T one. Zilch. It was an academic exercise with

absolutely zero practical value. And most importantly I had the

restraint to know that it was a pointless capability with a severely

limited application, and never tried to bring it out of the realm of

exercise into the world of execution.

 

I just wished other developers could demonstrate the same restraint.

There is a LOT of code out there that quite simply does not need to

be. Adds bloat, complexity, and generally diminishes the value of

everyone's hard work.

 

</rant>

 

With that said, I was wrong about $live_site. I was under extreme

pressure to deliver a major site when they removed that feature

(before the 1.5 framework was final), looks like it made it back into

the framework in just a slightly different place...

 

You CAN still enforce hostnames by using the JURI class on the front
end:

 

http://api.joomla.org/Joomla-Framework/Environment/JURI.html#base

 

When looking at the source code, it's right there on line 209 of the

base() method. Pulls the value of $live_site from JConfig. Woo-hoo!

Hello,

I've upgraded a dev. server to 5.3 and it's severely broken Joomla.  While
I've turned off all the obvious errors, there are things that just don't
work (like certain docman templates not showing up).

I'm investigating as to if the problem is fixable, but has anyone tackled
this before?

Not so much with 5.3 - but I had some of those issues with 5.2... most
likely it's due to the addition of some security feature - check the
disable_functions and other directives like that.

Or more simply it's actually locking the user to the apache instance... file
ownership might be better handled finally.

All in all I'm not 100% sure - but that's my normal starts with the 5.2 and
5.3 versions.

So actually most things appear to work without issue.  However I did find
one culprit.

In libraries/joomla/cache/handler/callback.php around line 99 there's:

$result = call_user_func_array($callback,$args);

which ends up triggering an error:

Parameter 1 to modMainMenuHelper::buildXML() expected to be a reference,
value given in /var/www/xxx/libraries/joomla/cache/handler/callback.php on
line 100, referer: http://xxx/login

So in modules/mod_mainmenu/helper.php around line 31 I simple changed:

	function buildXML(&$params)

to

	function buildXML($params)

This works for now but perhaps it's not a good solution, especially over the
long term.  The problem being that in 5.3, when there's a value/reference
mismatch, NULL is passed in.  Whereas with 5.2, it's effectively ignored and
it doesn't really matter.

This might be a long term problem with using call_user_func_array() in
general but I'm not sure of a better solution?

Well, based upon http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func-array.php the variables being called (which are stored in the array as a reference IIRC) are not being passed correctly.  To me, this looks like a php bug (or a documentation bug) more than anything else...
