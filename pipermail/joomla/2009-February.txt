Re;  SugarCRM and Email

I have setup, used, and discontinued using SugarCRM for a international
export client..

1st,  let me say it IS a great product.  I put in version 4 and we used it
about 6 months. I used a lot of it's functionality and it worked great 
EXCEPT for email!

 Email capabilites in the system was the reason we stopped using it.   It
just didn't work well, with way to many problems to list.

That said,  they made a big effort to solve this in version 5 because
everyone complained to much.  .  I have not used version 5, but would
recommend setting up a small pilot and test the functions you need before
totally committing to it.  That's the only way you'll know.

Apologies for the cross-post, I can't remember if this was a request
from NYPHP or the NYCJUG. *blush*

Somebody at the last meet was asking about nested sets, and I promised
to get them the URL:

Hey gang,

A bunch of totally unrelated stuff has me scrambling to assemble
resources here in the Manhattan area - can those of you interested in
either freelance or freelance-to-hire ping me offline?

Don't want to spam the jobs list with each one, there are too many and
I'm in a hurry as usual ;-)

I would not mind this sort of "noise" on the list as I too have more
requests than I can handle, and would like to know who out there is
available to free lance Joomla work.

Excellent! IMNSHO we should have either a jobs board or better yet a
"resources available" directory on the website, so folks can add
themselves as available candidates.

If we flip that the other way 'round we end up turning into a spamhaus, I fear.

Thoughts?

I am contracting another great venue. The only minus is not a lot of

Will a local caterer offer their services in trade for a Joomla site? ;) ;)
Could be collectively custom built right there on the floor at Joomla day.
That would make for an interesting hands on demo/project.

I added a category in Weblinks for Joomla Designers/Developers available for hire: http://joomlanyc.org/resources/designersdevelopers

Submit your listing here: http://joomlanyc.org/resources/resources/submit-weblink (login first)

Let me know if this setup works.

Excellent! IMNSHO we should have either a jobs board or better yet a
"resources available" directory on the website, so folks can add
themselves as available candidates.

If we flip that the other way 'round we end up turning into a spamhaus, I fear.

Thoughts?

This Joomla get together sounds exciting. I have been wanting to get more
involved here locally with the meetings. Unfortunately I have been teaching
a course at LIU Tuesday and Thursday nights. It will finish first week in
April. I would like to share where I can - I have  publishing experience
with print media, magazines, event photoraphy and organizing events
(sports), promotional work etc. Please contact me, I would be glad to help.

Is there a meeting next Thursday February 12th?

The reason I ask is that I would like to attend, but UniGroup had to move
it's meeting from the 3rd to the 2nd Thursday this month.

cheers,

This Joomla get together sounds exciting. I have been wanting to get more
involved here locally with the meetings. Unfortunately I have been teaching
a course at LIU Tuesday and Thursday nights. It will finish first week in
April. I would like to share where I can - I have  publishing experience
with print media, magazines, event photography and organizing events
(sports), promotional work etc. Please contact me, I would be glad to help.

Yup, and the speaker is Stephen Burge of Alledia.com, going to talk
about SEO, Joomla and training. Darn those wacky UniGroup scheduler
peeps!

I have previously used, www.BoldChat.com for my clients, and we have been happy with it, but I have found...

www.LiveZilla.com

which is freeware, and very interesting.
?
Has anyone used this product, any concerns that I should be aware of?? Am I really getting something for nothing?
?

I've used FlashChat, too.  It's been around quite awhile and it integrates with your Joomla user table.

Message-ID: <46562.89116.qm@web35605.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I have not been able to find one website that passes all the tests on the Performance Grader.

I tried w3.org, google.com, yahoo.com, craigslist.com, joomlapeformance.com, the demo on joomla, etc.

The Ruthsarian template comes close, but that's static html.
http://webhost.bridgew.edu/etribou/layouts/skidoo_redux/index.html

Is it possible to have a high performing site with dynamic content?

It's meant to be hard to pass... It's not meant to be a strict ruler for performance.  It's supposed to be a guideline (it even says that)...  (Google.com passes with the exception of valid html)...  

The whole point of the tool, is you feel your site is slow, it shows you the things you can change/tweak to make it faster...

Cafe Press has boxed postcards.  But I've never heard of a service like this.

This is an interesting service!  Maybe now I can get holiday cards sent out more than once a decade.  :-)

But for my client, I do not see they have a product that offers individual cards for sale on your site.  I emailed customer support for more info.

How ever many they can sell.  It will be up to the website visitor to choose a postcard, write a personal message, place it in the shopping cart and pay for it.  The delivery method is chosen by the buyer as either email or snail mail.

I have not been able to find one website that passes all the tests on the Performance Grader.

I tried w3.org, google.com, yahoo.com, craigslist.com, joomlapeformance.com, the demo on joomla, etc.

The Ruthsarian template comes close, but that's static html.

Is it possible to have a high performing site with dynamic content?

Subject: [joomla] brief answers needed to a few questions
Message-ID: <1234650688.6541.386.camel@jersey>

Just a few questions. Please don't spend a lot of time answering. Just
point me in the right direction.

1. Is it possible to have a text message or a graphic in a position
other than the content area? For instance, say I needed a text message
in the user1 area, how would I do that?

2. I'm using a variable template (like beez), and I need to change the
color of the h2 and h3 tags, but I can't find it in the css. The
template is Universatil off the Joomla24.com website. Just need to know
the mechanism they use, in a general sense, and where to go looking.

Thanks so much.

Mark

You would have to change that module to that position.

1.  create a new module using type "custom html" and publish it to User1.

2.  Maybe that template does not have a style for h1.  It's not a requirement.  So you would have to add it.

Just a few questions. Please don't spend a lot of time answering. Just
point me in the right direction.

1. Is it possible to have a text message or a graphic in a position
other than the content area? For instance, say I needed a text message
in the user1 area, how would I do that?

2. I'm using a variable template (like beez), and I need to change the
color of the h2 and h3 tags, but I can't find it in the css. The
template is Universatil off the Joomla24.com website. Just need to know
the mechanism they use, in a general sense, and where to go looking.

Thanks so much.

Mark

Subject: [joomla] strange logout problem
Message-ID: <955137.74173.qm@web31814.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I am having a strange problem on my new 1.59 joomla systems.
?
When you login on the front end using ie 7, then edit data, when you try to save the pagem, you can get an error and are kicked out of the system.
?
Then when you try to access the page again, even if you aren't editing you get the same error.? The error is: a winows box pops up saying, Internet Explorer can't open the site www.whatever.co, and it says operation aborted.? Then I have to clear the history in order to access the system again.
?
This problem is happening on all of my new 1.59 installs, the only thing in common is 1.59 and ie7.
?
any ideas?
?
If you think you can help, email me and I will send you a login info so you can see it in action.
?
thanks,
- Laura

Can the grading structure be changed?  How about 0 to 5 stars, with 5 stars not being impossible?  And a website badge to display for any sites scoring 5 stars!  I'll pay you $5 for every badge you give me.

1. Is it possible to have a text message or a graphic in a position

        message
        in the user1 area, how would I do that?

        1.  create a new module using type "custom html" and publish it

        color of the h2 and h3 tags, but I can't find it in the css. The
        template is Universatil off the Joomla24.com website. Just need
        to know
        the mechanism they use, in a general sense, and where to go
        looking.
        
        2.  Maybe that template does not have a style for h1.  It's not
        a
        requirement.  So you would have to add it.
        
        Found it. It's not accessible through the css editor in the
        administrator interface. There's a subdirectory (folder) below
        the css
        directory called switcher_css. There are several css files in
        there. Had
        to find the one for the color scheme I needed to change among
        those.

Subject: [joomla] two more questions
Message-ID: <1235067936.6519.27.camel@jersey>

I just broke a joomla system yesterday and I can't seem to fix it. It
was having issues serving up pages after logging in. I had installed
community builder.

Anyway, because of the error message I got, I thought it would be a
<not> good idea </not> to to change the table prefix field in the
configuration page. Of course I <stupid move> neglected to heed, or even
notice the exclamation pointed warning triange thingy </stupid move>.

I thought that at worst <bad assumption> that all I would have to do to
change things back was to edit the configuration.php file</bad
assumption>. That doesn't seem to be fixing the problem. Is there a
field in the database that I have to change to fix this problem? Can't
seem to find it.

=========

I have another site I'm working on that seems to have a problem with the
template css and joomla's sef. When I turn on sef, the css holds up at
the section level but breaks at the category level. Doesn't seem to
matter whether I put in a livesite value or not.

This template is universatil, which has that second css directory. Don't
know what happens when I switch to a simpler template.

Is it possible that the order of directives in the .htaccess file can
affect this?

Any other ideas about how to fix this? I'll need to go to sef with this
site.

===========

Thanks,
Mark

Hi, everyone

I'm using 1.0.x. Two questions:

1. I have the mod_newsflash set to 5 items in section: newsflash;  
cat: newsflash. I get the same 5 items after each page refresh. I  
have 25 articles but it's always the same 5 in the same order.  
Nothing random.
2. How important is it to upgrade to Joomla 1. 5?

Thanks.

Hi Steve!

I'm a fan of JoomlaJunkie's SuperSlider module:

Anybody else have recommendations?

Check your global settings for cache - that is probably your problem.

1.0 is slated for EOL (End Of Life) in a few months. Do you really
want to be running a version of Joomla that Joomla itself doesn't even
want to support? They are already switching gears to work furiously on
1.6...

Also note that there are a ton of things you can do in 1.5 that
require total core hacks in 1.0 - moving to 1.5 means you will have a
much easier experience customizing your website and whatnot.

Thanks, Mitch. It seems like it's time to make the switch. I got  
started a few weeks ago but then stopped.

Other problem a/1.0.x is that I can't edit it in Safari or Firefox. I  
need Opera.

        I

        I followed the instructions in the readme file for community

        know it's out of character, but I actually did that. Really!
        
        That procedure has me using the community builder login module

My suggestion:  Don't use Community Builder.  

Take a look at Joomunity or JomSocial.

I now need CB in my site, the problem is that the new CB uses php5. My hosting company has php5, but when I transfer to it, I loose my admin page, DB and joomla DB. 
?
My hosting company tells me if I want php5 I have to change every single file to use .php5 extension.
?
Is this correct??
?
Do I have an alternative to it???

Yes and no.

I am guessing you might be using Verio as your host.
If you want to run both php4 and php5 then you need the change to extension.
Or you can uninstall php4 and install php5 or migrate to a new server 
and test each site one by one to make sure it works..
I had some issues with a php4 script running on php5 becaus ethe script 
was poorly done. It interpreted a VAR as a function.

Hi,
I recently moved roughly 40 Joomla sites from php4 to php5 on my server.
Some of the sites quite old and still using joomla 1.0 but most of
them on 1.5 and each one different, different configuration,
components etc.
And the whole thing was completely painless without any problems or
adjustments needed.
Probably migrating to another server that uses php5 only is the easiest options.
regards,

You are talking about using cgi based php5. You need to load the 
libraries. It doe snot work that well. Magneto tries to use this work 
around.


With Joomla 1.6 you must use php 5.

Subject: [joomla] question about php 4 and php 5
Message-ID: <1235330797.6519.70.camel@jersey>

This is from my host's website:

With Linux hosting packages you have the choice between PHP 4 and 
PHP 5. To distinguish a script as PHP 5, simply name the script with the
file 
extension .php5.

Please note that in contrast to PHP 4, the default for the variable
RegisterGlobals and allow_url_fopen is "off".

By default Apache uses PHP 4 for .php extension. If you don't want to
rename all your 
scripts to .php5 you can do the following:
Create a .htaccess file and place the following line AddType
x-mapp-php5 .php in it.

This will tell Apache to use PHP 5 instead of PHP 4 for the
extension .php in the 
directory the .htaccess is placed and all sub-directories under it.

Hopefully that will help you too.

Mark

You need a new host, or at least one that knows the difference between
apache and an apache module. Holy smokes, I thought we made crack
cocaine illegal?

We dud make Crack illegal. BTW I am going to the "Dream Bid" Gala in 
honor of Notorius BIG.

That solution only works with shared, or one rule for all sites. If 
using virtual with virtual hosts, that will cause them all to use php5, 
which must be installed. But it must have a distinct extension.
MIGRATE, it is just easier.

There is a mambot that Eric Caldwell created which links together Mosets Tree along with Banners Manager, it is a great little plugin that allows you to link specific banners to specific categories in mosets tree...

He is not able to upgrade it to work with 1.5 right now...is anyone interested in doing this?

Here is a link to the current mambot...

I am sure this tool could be resold easily, as it is great...

Please help!!!

I believe "legacy" actually refers to Joomla 1.0.x . Joomla 1.5.x provides a
"Legacy Mode" that allows some Joomla 1.0.x extensions to be installed and
run on a Joomla 1.5.x system.

Thank you,

I would think that "1.0 Native" means the extension is designed and
developed specifically for J1.0.x . It may also mean that specific
extensions will NOT install under J1.5.x Legacy mode and will install only
on a J1.0.x system, maybe.

Thank you,

Is the template not showing on all browsers? Or only IE6?
I found the hard way (maybe there is documentation on this somewhere)
that the Custom HTML modules on Joomla 1.5 have issues when loading on
IE6.

I have a template that when enabled produces a blank page - any ideas
how 
to troubleshoot that? (The default templates work fine).

What version Joomla? Is the template for that version?
When you uploaded, did you make sure the permissions were correct?

troubleshoot a template problem, shoot me an email. Of course, I will
pay

Hey gang,

The 80 hour weeks are catching up to me, time to outsource myself. I
am on a client project right now that needs integration between
Joomla, KickApps and search powered by Sphinx. Any of you available to
take this on?
