Hi,I have just started using Joomla, and have come accross some slight problem... when you create a section it puts all the data into "Tables", I wanted to find out if there was a way of putting the data as it is put in the frontpage... i.e snippet and read more instead of a tabulated format....

That would be the menu item, and not the content, that you need to
consider. When you create a menu item, you can either point it to a
table of content, or a blog list of content. Try creating different
menu items and you will see what I mean.

Thanks... Worked well....Only one other thing, how do I have customised menu items for each section.. I am making a school site and want for instance in the academics section to have a menu pertinent to that... in the Alumnus section to have a menu pertinent to that... I havent seen any Joomla sites that are able to do this yet....

I think the "split menu" system that are available on some of the RocketTheme Joomla templates (www.rockettheme.com) will work for what you want.  Look at their demo for the "ModernBusiness" template, or read the info describing that template.

When you click on the menu item on the top horizontal menu bar, a new sub menu will appear on the left vertical menu bar for that section.

I think the split menu system is available on several other RocketTheme templates also.

That would be on your php.ini file.

If you don't know what it is, tell us your OS and the versions of Apache and
php so we can help you figure it out, ok?

Al,

This is a hosted environment so I can't change the php.ini file - the ISP 
is forcing me to save sessions in my  webfolder/cgi-bin/tmp. 

Is this safe? 

The tell me that I need to set session path:

        session_save_path(<home dir>"/cgi-bin/tmp");
Thanks,

Kirill

It depends, is the cgi-bin WITHIN  your public html folder or not?
If not, chances are that it is quite safe to have it there, you shouldn't
worry too much about it, except to do some cleaning once in a while to
prevent it from growing too stuffed.

If it is, can you change host? hehehe, cuz it is not safe, at all.

To the rest of the list, if I am saying something not acurate, please tell
us.
TIA.

company.

Yea!  The company I use is called Z-Host.com.  Very cool Cpanel setup.
Be sure to request Fantastico to help you install backend content 
management systems.

This service is cost effective, however the customer service isn't very 
quick to respond to tech support issues.
They're not even available on the weekends. But they'll always respond. 
If tech support is a major issue
I'd go with  another service that responds w/ 24hr phone tech support. 
But you'll pay more for that service buddy!

Good Luck!
Smitty
