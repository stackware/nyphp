Subject: [joomla] delimiter replacement for pipe |
Message-ID: <43C5194C.3060508@clearmark.com>

Hey guys!

I'm using AKReservation on a few sites and suddently they stopped 
working with 403 errors.  Turns out some hosters are filtering for the 
pipe character now as it is a security risk.

Mitch,  I know your one of the "core" folks.  Is there a "standard" 
delimiter used or defined for strings in joomla/mambo? I've searched for 
"explode" in the code to see what's used but didn't find anything in 
particular.  I need to replace the pipe with something.

Any recommendations?

Thanks.

What do you mean, "filtering for the pipe character"? They are
grabbing it out of POST ops, or censoring URLs? Can you tell me what
their justification for this is?

As Joomla doesn't really have anything to do with this, I'd say your
solutions are either getting a new ISP or working with AKReservation
to find an alternate character for whatever they are using the pipe
for.

Don't have any experience with AKR, so it is difficult for me to have
an answer without more info.

Mitch:

I should have used the word trap:  They are grepping certain characters 
from URLS and responding with a 403 if they are found.  I've actually 
seen this on a few hosts.  The pipe in particular seems to have hosed a 
few hosters - so that's why the traps.

AK uses the pipe extentively as a string delimiter; it is passed in the 
URL and stored as part of data in the db for string parsing/delimiting..

I've solved it and working through bugs now   I just replaced it 
everywhere with the tilde (lots of hand editing to handles ORs, etc) but 
on my test site it seems stable.

Thanks for your response.

Jeff

Wow, that is a shame. We should try to collect the names of these ISPs
to pressure them to use their craniums. This is like chopping the head
off over a bad haircut!

The pipe character is a standard delimiter, I cannot believe someone
would be filtering pipes - actually I cannot believe someone would be
filtering URLs at all.

Sounds like an overzealous reliance on GET, when POST would most
likely do the trick ;-) Sorry to hear of your troubles, and more
surprised that ISPs would muck around with URLs *gasp*

Message-ID: <1F3CD8DDFB6A9B4C9B8DD06E4A7DE358D6A734@network.PLMresearch.com>

Would like to make a splash page inside Joomla!  This would greet the user
after http://www.joomlasite.com with a simple "enter button" or skip intro
link.  After that, the menu buttons would refer to the index.php?option=....
Is there a best practice way to do this?  I would prefer to keep the splash
within the Joomla framework as opposed to naming it index.html and asking
Apache to serve index.html up first.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

TIA,

You could just create a simplified template and assign it to the  
"home" Page menu Choice, then you could point home at a static page  
or a content item or another component if you wish.

Thank Norm,

That's the direction I'm heading, however, it seems such a strategy will
them make the Home page = splash page.  This might get frustrating for the
user to constantly double back to the splash page all the time...although it
is a really good looking splash page ;-)

you could do a redirect with .htaccess to get around that so that  
index.php would point at whatever joomla url you wanted it to point  
to and then make the front page component the home page.

Yah, I think I'm going to do that.  Store the splash as an .html file with a
'enter' link pointing to index.php.  From there Joomla can do it's stuff.

I generally try to persuade clients not to use a splash page. If that 
doesn't work, I create it as index.html and most hosts are setup to 
serve that page first before index.php. The .htaccess takes care of this.

Not to complicate things too much but we have a couple of Mambo sites 
that require being logged in before viewing any content.  We actually 
create a login.php script and redirect non logged in users to the 
login.php script from Joomla's index.php.

In other cases we use Joomla's session handling to check if someone has 
been to a page on this visit or in the past and redirect them to the 
landing we want them on.  You can use either approach instead of using 
index.html.  The other nice thing is you can add logic in Joomla's 
index.php to do things like record the fact that someone has visited a 
page and not redirect them.

But this all means hacking Joomla stuff and might be to much work.

I apologize for the horrible cross-post - and I encourage others not to
reply-all - but we've been receiving comments that folks haven't been
hearing about announcements and events since they're not on the Announce
list.

Please be sure to subscribe to the moderated Announce list
(http://www.nyphp.org/lists) since announcements are *not* typically
cross-posted.

This announcement is quite significant since it announces the call for
papers is open for NYPHPCon 2006 and more details.

Thanks all,

For what it is worth:
I have put an inline frame in the midst of the index.php Home Page.
The web page in the inline frame has a JavaScripted cookie script that
tracks whether the 
user has seen the inline page with the Flash "Splash" movie. 
If they have seen the "Splash", the script loads a different ordinary page
in the inline frame.
Additionally, the cookie script can be set to show the Flash "Splash" once
per session,
once per day, once per year, etc.
It has been quite flexible because the movie page and/or the ordinary page
can be PHP pages delivering
dynamic content within the dynamic parent index.php.

Subject: [joomla] Splash page


Would like to make a splash page inside Joomla!  This would greet the user
after http://www.joomlasite.com with a simple "enter button" or skip intro
link.  After that, the menu buttons would refer to the index.php?option=....
Is there a best practice way to do this?  I would prefer to keep the splash
within the Joomla framework as opposed to naming it index.html and asking
Apache to serve index.html up first.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

TIA,

php.ini?

Hey Scott,

As far as I know, you don't need any - besides of course the mysql
connectivity - however the zip extension comes in handy ;-)

You could also have your joomla site live at joomlasite.com/joomlasite and
have index.html on joomlasite.com/ that redirects to
joomlasite.com/joomlasite after the splashy entrance.
