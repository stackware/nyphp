Thanks, Chris & Donna for your postings. Very helpful!

I got it working as a module.

Now that this is a big requirement for this module, but I was wondering how
do I take the JavaScript and put it in it's own file so that the module can
find it? Thanks!

If I go to the Article Manager and change it to hide the print and mail
icons, it is not displayed on the Article. But if I do a hide just on the
Article options of the print and mail icon they are still displayed. I
thought hide in the Article does an override of the Global from the Article
Manager. Anyone else have this problem or am I missing something? Thanks!

Create a folder called js in your module folder (this is to make it easier
in your xml file, and to keep things nice.)

Than you create a js file in that folder name it whatever makes sense, and
in your module file mod_david_table.php

Add JHTML::_('script', 'nameoffile.js' 'modules/mod_david_table/js/');

Please check that for typos I typed it on my phone.

Hi Chris.

Thanks for the info!

Speaking of JavaScript, anyone have experience about what to do with Table
PC users to make JavaScript work for them? Something special to do in the
JavaScript? Thanks!

(Not as confused as I am :-) )

I got a little more detail. It turns out, this user is using a IE 7. I
tested it on an old Windows XP and I had the same problem. The symptom is
when the user clicks on Submit it doesn't do anything.

It might have something to do with using this onclick in JavaScript code:

<input type=button value="Submit" onclick="myform(this.form)">

Since this turned out not to be Joomla template related, I won't follow
this up here. Thanks!

I'm using a shape5 template and want to use fonts that are not included
from a third-party. How is this done in Joomla? Is it a function of the
template being used, Shape5 in this case, or does Joomla have a method for
installing your own fonts? Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAHM6=ODmnwRgo7H_03HrKx7Z_CXkaTh5j+XL0WmY65xxB=rGcA@mail.gmail.com>

I've a client who wants the possibility of creating mini sites on the fly
from within her Joomla installation.

This procedure should be as easy as possible, like creating a blog in
blogspot of or the like.

I've tried having a couple of templates and a set of pages, category and
menu itens which she would copy from, but she finds it too confusing to do
what she wants.

How can I accomplish that in Joomla? Any ideas?

Thanks!

Subject: [joomla] Problems with installation manager?
Message-ID: <1345372934.70386.YahooMailNeo@web122306.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

I am getting this error when trying to install akeeba 3.6.1 core using the extension manager - install

	* JFolder::create: Could not create directory
	* Warning: Failed to move file!
	* 

I would have thought that I would find the answer in the akeeba docs, but according to the akeeba
website,? https://www.akeebabackup.com/documentation/troubleshooter/abinstallation.html

"If you still can't install Akeeba Backup and you are receiving messages regarding unwritable directories, inability to move files or other similar file system related error messages, please do not ask us for support. These errors stem from your site set up and can best be resolved by asking for help in the official Joomla!? forums. We can only support software we develop ourselves. Joomla!'s extension installer is certainly not developed by us, therefore we can't help you."
?I am running joomla 2.5.4 and I had originally set the site up on a web host using a temporary url.
Akeeba? 3.5.1 was installed, and running fine.?? Then it was time to move the site into production, so using cpanel 
database and root backups, I moved the site,? set up a new database user, connected it to the new database
and changed the url to the production name.

Site works perfectly, but akeeba would not run.? tried re-installing, no good.
so I uninstalled akeeba, making sure that all the references in the data base to com-akeeba were removed
as well, as stated on the akeeba trouble-shooting page.?? 

After the un-install, I tried a fresh install and got the above error messages.....any ideas on how to fix?? The site in in production,
without any automated backup .....not good.?? 

Akeeba trouble shooting suggests the problem is in my site set-up...as a joomla novice, I pretty much use the defaults, except for things like seo URLs...

?Help greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

Kirill:

Whoo-hoo!? That did the trick!
The fresh install of akeeba threw a bunch of errors because it

couldn't delete some files but the install was successful and
the backup seems to have worked.....Now all I need to do is
test the restore to make sure I really have a working backup...

Thanks - I really appreciate the help

Joomla Users:

I have a client that must upload "pdf" files to his Joomla CMS site 
(version 1.5.X), then create a user for specific clients, then have that 
client log into the frontend of the site and only be able to see their 
"pdf" files. They can not see other clients files  only their own and 
they can obviously download and/or print.

It is very important that each user can only access files belonging to them.

Any ideas?

Thank You

Any of the document management components -- phocadownload, RSFiles, DocMan.? Phocadownload is non-commercial.? Docman requires a payment.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla 2.5 and recaptcha
Message-ID: <503E4D3A.30209@joomlaconnections.com>

Fellow Joomla CMS people:

I have had a few clients complain about the recaptcha challenge. 
Specifically the two word challenge and how at least one word is always 
very difficult to figure out. It 's great that Joomla CMS 2.5 has the 
built in challenge but modifications to recaptcha are limited to only 
the theme. At least, that's how it appears to me. Can you get a one word 
easier challenge?

Are you also getting the same complaints? Are there plans to have other 
types of challenges built into the the core of Joomla CMS? Has anyone 
found an alternative that works seamlessly in Joomla CMS 2.5? Why was 
recaptcha selected?

Thank You
Bob Rynkiewicz

I use RSForms on every website instead of the Joomla form, because it gives you the option of using the Recaptcha, which is sometimes impossible to use, and the RSForms captcha which is very simple and very readable:? rsjoomla.com

Donna,

Thank You I will keep RSForms in mind for forms. What about integrate 
with say JomSocial and other extensions as well as just the Joomla CMS 
registration process?

Would it not be better to engineer/develop Joomla CMS to have several 
options for challenges in registration forms, forms in general. Perhaps 
recaptcha is getting the same feedback about the difficulty factor and 
will provide options?

In an ideal world -- LOL!

Thanks

I have a site where this code has suddenly shows up on the pages.
Does anybody know what this means and how to fix it:

Warning: strtotime() [function.strtotime]: It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected 'America/Los_Angeles' for 'PDT/-7.0/DST' instead in

Hi Paul.

Without more details, I'm going to hazard a guess to what's going on. That
error message is appearing because PHP has been updated to a later version
which expects the time zone functions to be done differently. The way to
fix this would be to make changes to PHP code, which I don't think is a
good solution because it's most likely in many places through Joomla 1.5
and perhaps extensions too.

My best recommendation would be to upgrade from Joomla 1.5 to the latest
release which is 2.5.6. Make sure you check the minimum PHP requirements
for upgrading to Joomla 2.5.6. When you can get to the command level, type
php -v and that will display the current version the system is running. If
you don't have shell access to do that, try uploading a tiny PHP program
like this and call it phpinfo.php:

<?php

// Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
phpinfo();

?>

Then run it from the web browser for domain.com/phpinfo.php and that will
display the version number of PHP, along with a bunch of other info too.

I'm a little concerned why you are seeing these messages appear on the web
page though. Perhaps one of the options to not display errors was enabled
along the way. I don't recall where this was done exactly. In the long run,
it's better to upgrade to the latest version of Joomla. I know it's easy
for me to say this because I don't know the size of the web site and what
extensions are being used which might be available for Joomla 2.5. Hope
this helps!

Yea I would agree with this, OR it has just always been not set and you
turned on error reporting in your config.

what is more likely since you are running joomla 1.5 is that you were
running on a host running PHP 5.2 and now you are running php 5.3 which
requires  the datetime settings.

The date timezone error is also something I had when I upgraded to PHP 5.3,
it seems the stock PHP 5.3 doesn't set a value for this - to correct the
problem, edit your php.ini file and add in a recognized timezone value for
the 'date.timezone' setting. There's a whole list of accepted timezones at:
