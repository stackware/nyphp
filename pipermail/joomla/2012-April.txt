Does anyone know of (have positive experience with) animated menu extensions for Joomla,
that rotate similar to the circular menu on this page? The icons "clinical research trials", "IVD"
'sample storage" rotate every 30 seconds and when selected move to the upper left side of the
circle.
Thanks!

Hi Janet,

 

Please take a look at this nice images/text menus:

 

http://www.operationforhope.org/

 

It is not rotating, but I assume with some programming it would be possible
to make it rotating.

 

Best regards,

Sasa

That is Flash based.
You could make a Javascipt animation that might do it.
The bigger question is why would you want that?

Subject: [joomla] Joomla AlphaContent Extension changes needed
Message-ID: <4F7CA2C6.2050504@joomlaconnections.com>

Fellow Joomla CMS users:

I need a Joomla CMS developer to make a change to the Alpha Content 
Extension. I contacted the developer and he is unable due to work load 
to assist me. I would appreciate any leads that people have as to who 
might be available to do this (what appears to me to be) a small 
alteration to the code.

Thank You
Bob Rynkiewicz

Subject: [joomla] Cool Chrome Canary feature
Message-ID: <4F81B4BB.8040508@gmail.com>

I was mucking about with Canary and discovered a cool feature.  You can 
fake your resolution setting.  I'm not talking about the pseudo-faking 
that a number of extensions provide - but true faking.

For those of you unfamiliar with Canary, Google releases their browser, 
Chrome, in a number of different "flavors".
http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel

There is the Stable, Beta, and Dev 'channels' - which will all install 
in the same file directory - so you can only have one of these channels 
installed without going to great lengths to setup multiple copies of chrome.

But they also have a special 'channel' - Canary.  Canary is the bleeding 
edge of Chrome - so the installer for Canary installs in a separate 
directory with a completely separate profile - so you can run the 
bleeding edge and a more stable version side by side.

So, after you install Canary, go and load a website your working on.  
For testing, I recommend http://www.screenresolution.org/
http://www.webpagescreenshot.info/img/868607-48201264529PM
Then open the developer tools[CTR+SHIFT+I]

Down at the lower right hand corner of the screen will be a gear icon.  
Click the gear icon and up pops a bunch of settings.    Under user 
agent, select "override device metrics" and enter a new resolution size.

RELOAD the page.  http://www.webpagescreenshot.info/img/733559-48201264805PM

As you can see from my snapshot, the first time the web server thought 
my screen was 1680 x 1050
The second time, it thought my resolution was 1024by768


Using the various extensions to set screen resolution, it never actually 
changes the device metrics sent to the server - it changes my screen 
size.  This is an important difference because a wide number of web 
servers have separate css style sheets based on screen size - or they 
use 100% widths which use the underlying device resolution, not the size 
of the window.

Pisses me off to no end because sites like Facebook stick some popup 
stuff at the FAR right of the "screen", so if I try to run my browser in 
only 768 pixels of the screen, I have to scroll right to get to the 
logon/logoff buttons.

By FORCING everything to think my width is smaller, sizes actually 
render correctly.  It also allows you to do better mobile website 
comparisons as you can set your resolution down to what is actually 
shown on a smart phone and see what it will look like AT THAT SIZE.   
Combine that with the user agent override and you can do a lot of 
'mobile website' testing right from chrome.

Subject: [joomla] Blank Joomla template
Message-ID: <1334081134.46572.YahooMailNeo@web160403.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

I'm new to Joomla as a CMS and was looking for a blank template, similar to
the 'sandbox' theme in Wordpress.? Is this? "Blank" template 

http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/tools/design-tools/18381

roughly the Joomla equivalent of what Sandbox provides for a wordpress web developer?
Would this be a good place to start since the website I will develop is a custom design?


How useful? is the ebook that's available for purchase?? Is the translation pretty good so
that the docs are easy to follow?

Thanks!

Right now I am busy with a client, but if it can wait I can send you a copy
of my
Joomla framework later tonight. It's very basic with a minimal amount of
code.

You should also check out Barry North's Joomla 1.6 book. It has an
excellent chapter on how to build a Joomla template from scratch.

thanks so much Steve, I can certainly wait. 


I'm playing around now to acclimate myself to joomla as I wait for the graphics
artist to create a layout and design that client approves.? No hurry at all, I appreciate
the advice. 


I plan on attending the meeting in NYC on monday nite.? If you also plan to attend, perhaps
we can discuss further at that time...

?
Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv-+r3FBK29p662OYuVpseksdBRe+5Ehf4MwkSTL2ziVRA@mail.gmail.com>

Usually when I have run across a locked status in Joomla, I can click
on it, and it solves the problem.

I'm trying to access the 'footer' module. I go to the Extentions
Manager - > Manage and it finds 'footer' but it has a status with a
lock icon on it. I have tried to disable and enable it, but it
displays the message "Edit state is not permitted".

Never had this happen before so I'm not sure what to do to fix it
gracefully. I went to Options and selected Allow for Edit State, saved
it, but this has had no effect.

I'm the only admin on this website at the moment, so I'm willing to
check something in MySQL if needed with PhpAdmin, but not I'm sure
what to change to unlock this or if it will have other unwanted
actions. Thanks!

David Roth

David,
To do this, you have to do a GLOBAL CHECKIN

In joomla 1.5, it is under: Tools --> Global Checkin
In Joomla 2.5 it is under: Site --> Maintenance ---> Global Checkin

Hope this helps.

No need to go into mysql or anything...

Hi Janet,

I'm the creator of the Construct Template Development Framework, one of the
The Blank template's "competitors" (we're very friendly with one another).
The Blank template is very good, quite educational and a great starting
point. Alex has also added some neat tricks to it too. You do, though, need
to flush out the Blank template's index.php and CSS files. You can see an
example of their index.php at
https://github.com/Bloggerschmidt/Blank-Template/blob/master/index.php and
their template style sheet at
https://github.com/Bloggerschmidt/Blank-Template/blob/master/css/template.css

Construct is very similar in that it provides a foundation to build on.
However, I have also fully developed the index.php, complete with a number
of module positions (i.e.
https://github.com/construct-framework/construct5/blob/master/index.php),
and a core style sheet (i.e.
https://github.com/construct-framework/construct5/blob/master/css/screen.css).
Both of which can be overridden or customized (and I have a few tricks of
my own)

I think Construct provides more of what you are looking for in comparison
with "Sandbox" for WordPress. Both should be good solutions for custom
template development depending on where you want to start.

While I haven't read it, Alex is also a very smart guy, so I'd expect his
eBook to be very good too.

Hope that helps.

Best,

Matt Thomas

Hi Laura.

Thanks for the reply.

I went to Global Checkin. I see listed the following:

        hihto_banner_clients table	0
	hihto_banners table	0
	hihto_categories table	0
	hihto_contact_details table	0
	hihto_content table	0
	hihto_extensions table	0
	hihto_finder_filters table	0
	hihto_menu table	0
	hihto_modules table	0
	hihto_newsfeeds table	0
	hihto_user_notes table	0
	hihto_weblinks table	0

There is nothing to check-in. I selected them all anyway, and did a
check-in and got the message "No item checked-in".

Either I'm missing something here, or something is messed up. Any
suggestions of which MySQL table and field to look in to see what is
going on? Thanks!

Hi David,

I think this issue with using person for politic purposes is pretty used
after nn years. I do not have any
Will to outsource to North Corea. My father was policeman so I think at some
Point we think same about service and serving country + you are paid for
that.

I have updated CV home page:

http://www.achiles.net

I am just protecting copyright to be used any more.

Thanks to everyone till new day, need to work now.

Best regards,
Sasa

Thanks, Matt.
I had a look around and? I'm not much of a php programmer.? It looks like the construct framework may be a better choice for my skills.
I should have more time to download and play with the framework over the weekend/early next week.....Thanks for sharing your work.
Will you be attending the NYC users group meeting tomorrow nite?? If so, I look forward to meeting you.

?Thanks!
Janet Sullivan

You're welcome Janet! I hope it is a good solution for you. There are
certainly many great choices to choose from out there.

I unfortunately don't normally make the NYC users group meetings as I'm in
mid-state Connecticut. But, I do try to attend the NYC Joomla Day events.
Hope to see you at the next one!

You're welcome Janet! I hope it is a good solution for you. There are certainly many great choices to choose from out there.

 

I unfortunately don't normally make the NYC users group meetings as I'm in mid-state Connecticut. But, I do try to attend the NYC Joomla Day events. Hope to see you at the next one!

Thanks, Matt.

I had a look around and  I'm not much of a php programmer.  It looks like the construct framework may be a better choice for my skills.

I should have more time to download and play with the framework over the weekend/early next week.....Thanks for sharing your work.

Will you be attending the NYC users group meeting tomorrow nite?  If so, I look forward to meeting you.

 Thanks!

Subject: Re: [joomla] Blank Joomla template

 

Hi Janet,

 

I'm the creator of the Construct Template Development Framework, one of the The Blank template's "competitors" (we're very friendly with one another). The Blank template is very good, quite educational and a great starting point. Alex has also added some neat tricks to it too. You do, though, need to flush out the Blank template's index.php and CSS files. You can see an example of their index.php at https://github.com/Bloggerschmidt/Blank-Template/blob/master/index.php and their template style sheet at https://github.com/Bloggerschmidt/Blank-Template/blob/master/css/template.css

 

Construct is very similar in that it provides a foundation to build on. However, I have also fully developed the index.php, complete with a number of module positions (i.e. https://github.com/construct-framework/construct5/blob/master/index.php), and a core style sheet (i.e. https://github.com/construct-framework/construct5/blob/master/css/screen.css). Both of which can be overridden or customized (and I have a few tricks of my own)

 

I think Construct provides more of what you are looking for in comparison with "Sandbox" for WordPress. Both should be good solutions for custom template development depending on where you want to start. 

 

While I haven't read it, Alex is also a very smart guy, so I'd expect his eBook to be very good too.

 

Hope that helps.

Hi Sasa,

I'm not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for, but Akeeba
Subscriptions<http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/e-commerce/membership-a-subscriptions/19528>
has
a great built-in graph. You can see it at http://goo.gl/NsPDH.

Maybe you can look at his code and see what he used?

Subject: [joomla] Pre-Announcement: Crafty CMS
Message-ID: <4F882C43.1090907@gmail.com>

I wanted to gauge interest here.  I'm setting up my own personal 
websites and I find:
Joomla! is 60% of what I want
20% of what I want can be handled with custom components, templates, 
modules, and plugins
5% of what I want is either in the next platform or cms release
10% of what I want can be handled with autoloaders and overrides
5% of what I want requires hacking core code

Now, if I was my client, I'd tell myself to focus on what I /need/ not 
what I want and try to eliminate any core hacks and most of the overrides..

But I'm not a client, I'm me.  And everytime I start setting this up I 
get frustrated because it doesn't meet my artistic vision - and I'm not 
willing to compromise my vision[wow, I sound like a silly *artiste* 
don't I?]

So the solution is simple, fork Joomla!
Not in a competitive way, but in the way I've seen done on countless 
client projects where they have some custom code they use in house and 
no one else ever see's the code.

My plan is to create a fork of the Joomla! repository.  Then in that 
fork create 2 new branches, one for dev/hacks and one for 
releases...ideally 80% of released code could be pulled right back into 
Joomla!...and if it's pulled properly, when I update my fork from their 
it will integrate seamlessly and override my own code.

My question is, how many people are truly interested in playing around 
with it?  Not just a cursory glance, but truly looking it over and 
testing it out?  Because my early code will often have stuff I don't 
want publicly available, I'll be placing it all in a private github 
repository...and I'm not willing to pay for that so it means charging a 
nominal annual fee for repository access[say 24$/year to make sure 
people are serious and make sure I don't end up losing money to 
Github].  Almost everything there will....eventually make it out into 
the public either as an installable Joomla! extension, or pull requests 
back to the source.

As a quick summary of what I "want":
Multi-site single installation codebase: All Joomla needs is 2 changes 
to support multiple domains from the same codebase.  It needs a 
hook/plugin for the query builder so a domain filter can be added to 
when using specific tables[for example, where DOMAIN='mydomain.com'] and 
a pre-system setup call to set the domain.  That is it.  Everything else 
is in there, plugins for editors can add the domain selector.  Plugins 
for forms can filter out domain specific info, etc.

Unified Content: Taking a leaf from Drupal, instead of storing raw 
content in the content table, I'd much rather store content that has 
already been formatted for display and is searchable.  All it requires 
is adding an content type mapping to map content to different components 
for editing and in one swell fwoop you get rid of 90% of the SEF 
headaches...SEF now can almost /always/ use content sef mapping.  Other 
components augment content rather then display different content.  It 
also solves 75% of searching issues as all searching can be done on the 
content itself, not different searches.

Null Storage engine for Caching:  Over and over in the codebase there 
are all these components that store objects they retrieve so they don't 
retrieve them over and over.  But we already have a class that does 
this, Cache....the only problem is that cache is for storing data TO 
somewhere.  But in this case, we only want to store data in memory.  So 
use cache.

Caching priorities:  TTL SUCKS as a caching strategy.  Basically it says 
'save this for 15 minutes, then throw it away'.   As long as I am 
caching data, I want it to be intelligent!

A typical Joomla! Caching snippet:
   $cache = JFactory::getCache("com_mycomponent", "");
   $cacheKey = $this->getId();
   $item = $cache->get($cacheKey);
    if (empty($item)) {
    // do some stuff to get the item
    $cache->store($item);
   }
   // do something with the item

How...wasteful.  Why not:
   $cache = JFactory::getCache("com_mycomponent", "");
   $cacheKey = $this->getId();
    $importance = JCache::HIGH;
    $softLimit = '360';
    $hardLimit = '3600'
   $item = $cache->get($cacheKey, $importance, $softLimit, $hardLimit);
   $p = JProfiler::getInstance(cacheKey);
$p->mark('Start');
    if (empty($item)) {
    // do some stuff to get the item
$p->mark('Stop');
    $retrievalTime = $p->buffer;
    $cache->store($item, $importance, $softLimit, $hardLimit, 
$retrievalTime);
   }
   // do something with the item

Wow...NOW we have some metrics.  We know how LONG an item took to 
retrieve.  All things being equal, objects with the same importance 
should be expired based on the time they take to generate, not FIFO.  So 
if you have 2 objects and one takes a millisecond to generate, and the 
other takes 1 minute[think an internal db call vs an external REST call 
to grab a chart image from Google] - isn't it obvious which one to throw 
away first?

And by using soft and hard limits, instead of simple TTL, we can keep 
'stale' data until it gets updated.  A stock price from Google is just 
as valid an hour from now as 10 minutes from now - but maybe we want to 
retrieve it every 10 minutes if possible, but will settle for older data 
in some circumstances.

Lastly, passing the importance flag to the retrieval as well as the 
storage allows different items to 'upgrade' cached data.  Maybe it 
wasn't important to one section of code, but another call on a different 
page really needs the cached data if at all possible because otherwise 
it bogs down.

Speaking of Cache...  PHPSerialize is wonderful...if everything is 
running PHP.  But what if you have a caching proxy sitting up front?  
For a stupid logon module, you destroy caching for logged in users since 
the upper right hand corner of the screen changes from: Login... to: 
Hello Gary, you have no new messages

A caching server could use esi:include 
url="http://mydomain.com/userwelcome" and cache everything else but grab 
that info from the server.  Even better though, since you have a 
sessionid cookie, instead it could be: 
src="memcache:get(sessionid->userwelcome)" and if the data is stored in 
memcache with a sessionid in json format, poof!  It appears.  No server 
hit needed.

And why should we lose the ability to count hits just for the sake of 
caching a page?  Almost every caching system today allows for that!
esi:include src="memcache:incr(<articleId>Hits)"

Sure you occasionally have to sync that data back to the database....but 
its much more fun!

Just figured I'd throw it out there.  If there is stuff others "want" 
that would make them willing to pay $24/year for feel free to throw it 
on the pile and if it's amusing enough it will probably get in there.

Been there, done that.  It sucks.  It does not match my artistic vision.

1) Hits and Faves are tied into the content table...why on god's green 
earth should I change the last modified date for content every time a 
hit happens? Hits can be tracked separately. And because of this data 
being in the content table, I must accept the performance hit of a truly 
massive join just to update the hitcount.   I truly don't care about the 
security of the hit counter, let it make some false positive 
registers...that's better than making it so one has to either accept 
loss of page cache, or no hit counter.

2) Linking content to other extensions is ugly.
2a)You have to store an entry in the database, tied to the content id, 
for every extension which wants to be called when a content item is 
viewed/edited/saved.  Why?  Joomla has a plugin system for a REASON.  
Just dispatch the message "content item id loaded" and let plugins 
alter/add as needed.
2b)When last I looked, it only accepted components as extensions which 
can modify things...it was hardcoded to load the class/object from a 
component.  Again, use a plugin system and let the plugin decide where 
to gets it's classes from.

3) It doesn't actually store the content in the content table.  Instead 
it stores the content, plus a bunch of json encoded data, which must now 
be decoded and stitched back together again to actually view the 
article.  It's murder on searches having to load EVERY content item, 
decode the JSON, just to check your own flag.   Generate once, store in 
body field for content...index body field for content -one place to 
search and it can be done from the database OR from PHP.

Opinionated?  Me?  I did say it was artistic didn't I?

Thanks I have it on my to do list.

That will help.

I do like your ideas

Also we have a GIT server and we will start using gitweb to make it 
easier for users to join.
If you want to use it, we are happy to provide it.

Gary,
What about adding Sass and Compass to work with core.
This was it makes it easier to create responsive themes/templates on the 
fly.

Subject: [joomla] Thursday Joomla NYC meeting
Message-ID: <CABcNofO5cWDH-zZ57oq88vPV2bvEXbG1PtV8O4uC22pZZ0Pxsg@mail.gmail.com>

We had one of our best Joomla NYC meetings ever last night!

When the idea of an "all question-and-answer" format was proposed, I was
worried that there would not be enough questions to fill up the 6:30 to 8
PM time slot. I even put together a presentation, my "five favorite Joomla
plug-ins" just in case.

Instead, we had a great talk and finally wrapped it up at 9 PM. We covered
everything from how to use one article over several pages (many ways to do
it with Custom HTML, News Flash and numerous third-party modules) to
Google+ (Don't laugh. This service will succeed!) and responsive Joomla
websites (check out the Blank Joomla demo at http://blank.vc ) And many
other Joomla related items. Everyone went home with some knowledge that
they didn't have before the meeting.

We have decided to go with the QA format every few months as a break from
the regular presentation and lightning round meetings.

I also want to highly recommend the new "Joomla Programming" book by Louis
Landry and Mark Dexter. I purchased and downloaded the Kindle version
during the meeting right after Fred Sullivan recommended it and completely
agree with Fred. This is a classic. The Kindle version is only $21.99
http://amzn.to/ITCLiw

It's 540+ pages and reads like a John Grisham novel. (Well, maybe not. No
one dies :-) I am already up to the 50% mark and it's so nice to read an
advanced Joomla book as opposed to all those Beginning Joomla, Joomla First
Look, and Joomla for Dummies books.

The title Joomla Programming is also not completely correct. Yes, this book
does go over some programming (Chapter 3 is confusing), but it covers many
topics that all advanced Joomla developers should know, like setting up
template over-rides and the meaning of all the PHP code in Joomla
templates. There is a great tutorial on how to modify the registration page
using template overrides. I have gotten a lot out it. See you all at the
next meeting.

Have a great weekend!

Does anyone know of an extension that can be used to display an incremental counter on the website?
The functionality I need is similar to the counters that display the national debt....but
I would need to be able to specify parameters to control when the counter is incremented.
Thanks in advance for suggestions

Need more information to answer your question.

What are you trying to count? visitors? downloads? etc.

What is the data source?

Thanks but I actually use github for a reason[not just because all the 
cool kids do].

Using submodules and readonly repo links, I can embed other github repos 
in my repository without having to merge them.

My hacking current layout, abreviated, is:
site/mydomain.com
libs/joomla-platform
libs/joomla-cms

When I fork a copy of the repo and pull it down, it automatically pulls 
the latest copies of the platform and the cms...  Frequently when I am 
looking to add a new function, I find checking the existing sources may 
have a solution for what I want to do, so I can pull it in and use 
it...and when the CMS release finally catches up to it, the migration is 
transparent.  As an example, the latest platform has a bunch of 
encryption/hashing library classes built in.

The data source will have to be some form of an internal counter that 

represents number of units processed.

Only after someone comes up with a source map generation library for 
PHP.  I am soooo tired of trying to figure out where compressed 
javascript comes from.  A source map would make it a lot easier to debug 
this stuff.

Gary,
What about adding Sass and Compass to work with core.
This was it makes it easier to create responsive themes/templates on the
fly.


Only after someone comes up with a source map generation library for PHP.  I
am soooo tired of trying to figure out where compressed javascript comes
from.  A source map would make it a lot easier to debug this stuff.

I am assuming that you want the customer to pay before they upload the
image file. Yes?

If so, I have never seen a single extension that can do this, but you could
do it with two extensions.

There are numerous extensions that allow users to upload files (Phoca
Download is one that comes to mind.).

Once you installed the file upload component, you would need a
subscription/membership extension that would give the customers access to
the file upload extension once they have paid and registered.

You would create different access levels based on image sizes - like small,
medium and large. The problem with this method is it would be difficult if
someone wanted to order more than one photo and in different sizes.

I also think you could use the Content Builder component from Crosstec
because it does have file upload and PayPal payment features, but
documentation is limited and unless you have a lot of time and experience
with extensions, I would not recommend this route.

You probably have to develop it yourself or find someone to make it for
you, but this type of extension  can be done.

Good luck.

Hi Kirill,

 

One of solutions is customized shopping cart:

 

http://matthewladdersinc.peckcreativedevelopment.com/products_step.php

 

First few steps/pages of loading images can be additional programmed,
ordering, billing/shipping

Address and cc/PayPal payment is built in, with order emails to admin and
customer, it is possible to add image attachment 

to paid order email.

 

This is shopping cart I have built, with 14 clients using it so far, not yet
customized under Joomla.

 

Best regards,

Sasa

Stephen,

Thanks for your recommendations - will look into them.   

The image upload is prior to final payment, some times it  is the first
step.  Here is a sample site
http://www.canvasdiscount.com/image/index/upload/

This is a printing service, client needs to upload the image then format it,
and the last part is to pay.  

Will be glad to hear more  suggestions on how to achieve this.

Thanks,

Kirill

Subject: [joomla] can't hide article title
Message-ID: <CALfVZ39XfG-UScMzg_qLjnnPN-uMcJ6rjPDOpevDeB=GNFwgUg@mail.gmail.com>

Maybe I am too close to this project, but I am stumped.
I am using joomla2.5, yootheme template and articles anywhere. I have an
article in a module, and when you click the Continue reading link, it links
to the article page. There is no menu link to this article. I have the
article parameters set to hide the title, yet it still shows up. Firebug
indicates it is a system title. How can I hide it?
I tried creating a menu item for the article and linking to it manually
from the module (instead of using the plugin's code) and the title still
shows up (yes, I checked no title in the menu parameters)
I must be overlooking something, but I can't figure it out.
The site is http://www.babyproofersplus.com/BPP25/<%20http://www.babyproofersplus.com/BPP25/>and
the module is the post-it in the middle of the page

Also, unrelated to that, I have 16 articles in one category.All parameters
are the same. The menu is set to blog layout.  Why would some article
titles/read more/and links in a latest news module, be linking to *
name-of-category/(id#)25-alias-name.html*, like
http://www.babyproofersplus.com/BPP25/blog/51-crib-bumpers
and others leave off the* category name and id #* like
http://www.babyproofersplus.com/BPP25/a-safe-sleep-for-all-babies   ?
My SEO Settings are :    Search Engine Friendly URLs-- yes      Use URL
rewriting --yes

Any insight would be helpful :(

Ellen,

I think I found a solution for this problem a while back with the YooTheme Downtown menu. ?If you search for "downtown date" on the YooTheme support pages, you will see a few discussions on removing the date from the title. ?Does one of these solutions work for you?

Solution 1:

Add the following to the custom.css:
#system .item > header .title time {display: none;}

Solution 2:

You need to go to Menus-> Main Menus->Home->Article Options->and in Show Create Dates you need to put it hide.?

(or possibly you can find the Show Create Dates option somewhere else pertaining to your page?)

Sue:

Is it possible to get quality sites to link to the site? ( inbound links) 


Depending on the person's profession, there may be several directories
that they be listed in....for example, doctors or dentists and include their
website link.

Is it possible for the person to write articles for online pubs in whatever their
subject matter expertise is and also link to the site.? Or find a quality blog
in the person's area of expertise and get them as a guest blogger...

Are there newsworthy facts that can be used to do news releases from time to time?
New book released?? Guest appearance, sponsor a charity event?? 


Good luck?

?
Janet

There is not much you can do beyond proper SEO.

It depends on how you structure the page.

The name should be in h2 tags at a minimum and the page should be 
exclusive about that person.

It helps if the name is unique, like my full name.
Are you trying to get rank on the name or the profession?

No, the site is on a web hosting server.
I can load one picture at a time, no problem.
If it were a permission problem, would the single 

image upload option work?

?

The name is unique and we are just trying to get rank on their name and
push down other sites' content. Hopefully this will happen as our content
is new and gets out there.

Of the name is unique, then it will rise. I suggest that you get the 
domain with that persons name and make a small vanity site. In that site 
create unique content, but also place links to the other articles.
You must follow rules about duplicate content etc.

Hi Ellen,

 

I would like to help you with this issue, path: 

 

/BPP25/apartment-living-in-nyc-dos-and-donts

 

Does not means that there is no ID in Url, based on path Joomla Url
rewriting is converting it to ID and fetching article.

 

If you are able to send me ftp access to site, I could look to add to
sources ID from Url and hide title.

 

Best regards,

Sasa

Update:

I realized that if I changed the SEO settings I can see if the pages being
generated are different and how. I saw that the articleid was
different-that is expected; the catid was the same, but the item id was
different also. I wasn't sure what the item id was referring to, but I
checked id numbers in all my modules, articles and menu items. Lo and
behold, I DID have  a menu item for the article in question on my Login
menu (which i never published the module for). Don't know why it was
there...probably  to trouble shoot something in the past. Once I deleted
it, all problems solved.

Hi  All,

I just developed a site locally on the latest version joomla, then used
akeeba back to put on the live site.  It looks like all the files and
database transferred over. The homepage works, which use 1 template, However
on all my subpages, which uses a different template, it's giving me the
error "No input file specified."  Any idea what or why that is?

Thanks,
Todd

Hi  All,

 I just developed a site locally on the latest version joomla, then used

Subject: [joomla] No input file specified joomla possible reasons -
 Digest, Vol 64, Issue 41

HI all
There are various reasons why "No input file specified" happens

Kickstart unpacks and prepares everything but I never experienced 
problems with it (kickstart), Localy MAMP XAMPP WAMP server usually 
bypass ini directives there are two ini.php one in the root and one in 
the /administrator
on some hosting it has issues (specialy if it is shred hosting ) related 
to configurations so lets start.
----------------------
1
----------------------
First disable SEF URL and try if it helps but if you need SEF URL here 
are the options ( when you disable in back end don't ctrl+r or f5) 
browser actually remembers id and code from url so go to front end home 
page clear browser cache refresh and click on link

----------------------
or 2
----------------------

You'll have to rename htaccess.bak that it makes to .htaccess
Check if sef url is turned on on 1.7 2.5 they are on by default

 From the Joomla Control Panel go to ?global setting? and under the Site 
Tab turn off SEF and Apache Use URL rewriting? check if that makes 
difference
also try ro Remove any #?s if any from RewriteEngine On and RewriteBase
and if your site is on a sub-directory do like this
RewriteBase /yourJoomlaRootFolder/

----------------------
or 3
----------------------

In your Joomla root directory look for ?php.ini? and rename it 
?php5.ini? (this should be without quotes) and if doesn't helps add next 
line in php5.ini
"cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1"

related to this Godaddy users which I was recently should do next (this 
is related to shared hosting not wds or ds )
go to Settings > File Extensions
change .php and .php5 from ?PHP5.2xFastCGI? to ?PHP5.2X? if it doesn 
help contact them because advanced technical support could resolve issue
i have had experience that although have had two same plans (de luxe) 
and have same settings one worked fine but other was giving "No input 
file specified"
after contacting support they contacted advanced technical and they 
resolved issue

----------------------
or
----------------------


check your paths in configuration .ini
some times people jus unpack with kick start and change localy in 
configuration.ini db host user and pass and upload to server via ftp

and leave with old values


var $log_path = 'home/content/yy/.../logs';
var $tmp_path = 'home/content/yy/.../tmp';

change to

var $log_path = './logs';
var $tmp_path = './tmp';

or find your absolute path change instead of "." and upload via ftp

----------------------
or 4
----------------------
if nothing ot this helps contact your hosting support if they have to 
contact their advanced technical support send them all these steps so 
that can be aware what you have tried , that way you'll get much faster 
response instead them to tamper around.

Again FYI

quote
"Yes i did. I also forgot to mention I installed in a sub dir, not the root"

this is most important part see step 2

If it's in a server, chances are it has some restrictions towards how the
Flash Uploader script works in Joomla.

Have you considered using JCEditor for your upload/media managemnt needs?

the interface looked the same to my novice eyeballs.

Subject: [joomla] Developer Clubs
Message-ID: <1335537646.92598.YahooMailNeo@web160404.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>


I am just getting started with joomla, and thusfar have only played around with some free templates.
I'm looking for advice on joining the various subscription-based joomla developer clubs like JoomlaShack, for 
example.? 

Does most professional developers join one or more of these subscription-based services?? Or is it better
to just purchase templates on a one-off basis?? 

If joining a club is the better option, which ones?

Thanks!

This is a big question. Everyone who answers will have a different opinion.
It all depends on what type of developer/designer/coder you are.

I think template clubs are good for people who are not designers and want
to offer professional-looking templates to clients. A good, well-designed
template can make the designed-challenged Joomla developer look like a rock
star.

If you are a designer/coder and frequently need to modify templates, then
you are probably better off making your own or working with someone who
creates custom templates.

My strategy with template clubs is to sign up for the least expensive plan,
usually three months and then download all the templates and experiment.
All the major template clubs license their templates under the GPL, which
means that you can use them on as many sites are you like. (Note that most
template clubs will only give you support for one domain. So if need help
tweaking a template on more than domain, you are out of luck or will have
to sign up for a bigger plan.)

There are four major Joomla template clubs - Rockettheme, Joomlart,
YooTheme and Joomla Shack.

I have used or checked out templates from each club and this is my quick
take.

Rockettheme - Beautiful designs (the best looking in my opinion), lots of
features, but lots of confusing javascript and difficult to modify. If you
want a free preview, download the Gantry Famework.

Joomlart - Nice designs, good tech support, but like Rocketheme, lots of
confusing code (and in most cases, non-commented code!) make these
templates difficult to modify.

YooTheme - My personal favorite - their Warp framework is amazing and
well-engineered. Lots of options, clean designs, and the best backend
control panel. Still, not a good choice if you like to get under the hood
and tweak by hand.

Joomla Shack - Not the nicest designs, but clean code under the hood. These
used to be the most primative templates, but in the past year they done a
lot to improve the back end. You can download the Wright Framework to see
if you like it. They also make the nicest free template, Jubliee.

Have a great weekend.

Even if you are a designer, you will want to start with a well-coded template and re-do the design.

The YooTheme templates have been tested in all browsers.? They provide you with the Fireworks source files so you can easily modify the design and export all the elements needed for the template.? This will retain all the coding that's already been tested in the various browsers.


The YooTheme club gives you support for 3 domains per year for the annual membership (every year you can add another 3 domains), and unlimited domains for the developer membership.

Subject: [joomla] upcoming Joomla NYC meeting on May 10th
Message-ID: <CABcNofMkHBJRhNKWczQhAQBTQiGjGGa=UdejN=zjwW6gkcf0KQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

I have recovered from my teeth problems and now have a $1,850 crown in my
mouth. And yesterday, I finally updated the JoomlaNYC.org site.

The upcoming May 10th meeting features:

Microsoft Developer Evangelist Peter Laudati showing how Joomla can be used
with Microsoft products. (I am guessing that he will show how you can now
use Joomla with MS SQL server.)

Our own Scott Wolpow will demonstrate RedSHOP, a Joomla component that he
says works well and even better than VirtueMart. We'll see.

Meeting to be hosted/chaired by our fearless Joomla NYC President, Marian
Konop.

And as usual, rounding out the meeting will be the Lightning Round, so
bring your questions and problems and let's get them fixed!

As always meeting starts at 6:30 PM. Thanks to Sebastian, we now have
improved directions to the Lincoln Center conference room on the
JoomlaNYC.org website.

Bonus tip of the month: A great way to add simple PayPal buy-now buttons -
including re-occuring subscriptions - to any Joomla website is with Nice
PayPal Button, a $15 plugin from Trinitronic
http://www.trinitronic.com/index.php/Downloads/nice-paypal-button-plugin.html

Just add a little snippet of code in your article, and you have a very
simple PayPal store.

All best,

Steve

I just noticed the New York PHP, which has hosted the Joomla NYC mailing
list for the past five years, has removed all references to JoomlaNYC.org
from its website. I could not find any way to subscribe or un-subscribe
from this mailing list.

I hope this is only temporary. If not, maybe we should look into
alternatives, like Google Groups, but I don't know if there is a way to
import all the members from NYPHP to Google Groups. I would like to avoid
asking folks to re-subscribe to this mailing list, although that might not
be a bad thing.

Hopefully, this is just a temporary issue as I have heard that NYPHP is
upgrading it's website.

Best regards,

Steve

One nice aspect of having a Google group is the web interface. That is, we
can easily look up and link to/reference other conversations. I've found
that to be an invaluable way to find lost knowledge.

Good point. Thanks Matt.

I know that the Joomla group has used Google Groups of many years and yes,
one of the benefits is the messages are easy to search. Although, as I
recall, NYPHP also archives the Joomla NYC messages too.

Another benefit from using Google Groups is we could control the list and
know the number of subscribers are on it.

As mentioned I believe, it's on the mailing lists page.  We're happy to add
another mention to it if needed - perhaps to the left or right columns?  Let
me know and provide if you want.

Regarding mailing lists and archives, we're going through some changes.
Time permitting, we'll have a new system online soon but for now it's
basically just ol' mailman.

JCEditor is an ALTERNATIVE to manage media in Joomla. You can check your
files, rename, exclude etc.

In every course I give I suggest it as an essential extension to be
installed with Joomla.

HI Arsen,

Thank you for the detailed response!  Solution #3 worked (since I'm on a
godaddy shared hosting plan). This resolved it without me having to turn
off SEF URLs.

Thanks again!

Subject: [joomla] mailto not working in Joomla 2.5
Message-ID: <CALfVZ3_oXxpEiX4uhczD8jp_S8NiSqbFmA2WxNerx52eN4OkSQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have been working on several 2.5 websites and it has just occurred to me
that my email links do not work. These are email links in module and
articles.My code is:

<a href="mailto:info at domain.com?subject=Inquiry">info</a>

It looks like a link but when I click on it, it doesn't do anything. This
happens in different sites I am working on, so I don't think it is template
related since I am using different templates for each.
The email settings in the global config are the default settings.
Any ideas why or how to fix this?
Ellen

Hi Ellen,

 

Do you have mailto example on some Url page, so I can check and test what
could be wrong ?

Subject: [joomla] mailto not working in Joomla 2.5

 

I have been working on several 2.5 websites and it has just occurred to me
that my email links do not work. These are email links in module and
articles.My code is:

<a href="mailto:info at domain.com?subject=Inquiry">info</a>

It looks like a link but when I click on it, it doesn't do anything. This
happens in different sites I am working on, so I don't think it is template
related since I am using different templates for each.
The email settings in the global config are the default settings.
Any ideas why or how to fix this?
Ellen

I am curious. Have you experimented with other browsers? I have found that
the Chrome browser can do funny things with links. If you are using Chrome,
try it in Internet Explorer or Firefox.

Also, what happens when you do a "view source" with a browser. Do you see
the same code in the view source as you do in the article?

As we all know, Joomla is not always cooperative when you try to place your
own HTML and JavaScript in an article.

Hi Stephen,

 

My first thinking is that it could be related to some JavaScript library or
Windows does

Not have setup default mailer. I have tested in IE and it seems ok.

 

Best regards,

Sasa
