Definitely sounds like a bug. The support forums at mambo-phpshop are
taking about it too:

More on the saga of the CSV uploading problem.  I installed 
MamboV4.5.1b_mambo-phpShop-Edition.tar.gz and 
MamboV4.5.2.1_mambo-phpShop-Edition.tar.gz last night on a Linux box 
with Apaches 1.3.x and MySQL 4.0.23.  I am having problems with the CSV 
upload when using Firefox.  I downloaded the CSV export to my HD with 
Firefox.  Click browse, select the file and click upload. (Trying to 
remove my local apps from the picture.)  I am immediately given the 
Save/Run file pop-up window just like if I had clicked Export.  When I 
try and upload the file through Explorer it seems to work. It is the 
weirdest thing. 

I was able to get into the Admin interface with explorer once I put 
Mambo on the linux box.

I saw the thread yesterday over at PHPShop forum but had already started 
complaining here.  I have now complained their too.

Thanks,
Hans

I am running running 4.5.2 CVS and have just downloaded a bunch of templates
from freemambo.com and am running into some trouble.  When I try to switch
to one of the new templates, I get an error message:

Notice: Undefined variable: cur_template in
/var/www/html/4.5/includes/mambo.html.php on line 425
Template File Not Found! Looking for template:

In looking at the offending line, it seems that mambo is looking for
index.html.  The solar flare template that came with the install has an
index.html, but none of the other templates do.  Some have nothing more than
css.

I tried googling this issue and looking over the mamboserver forums and
can't seem to find anything on this and am wondering if anyone knows what
the issue is here?

It appears that some of these templates are for the old 4.5 1.0.x
versions, and are making calls to deprecated functions. The navigation
of the site doesn't seem to be that blatant either :-/

I will look into it when I get back this evening.

Thanks Mitch.  

Looking at this now as a compatibility issue.  It appears that templating
has undergone a number of changes from 4.5.0 to 4.5.1.  I am not finding
much on changes from 4.5.1 to 4.5.2, but am still looking.... 

I tried a few changes myself like replacing the header section, but it seems
to me in looking over the solarflare template, that a shift was made
requiring a separate index.html file just to handle the layout.

Hang on there folks. Those stray index.html are only there to protect
the contents of directories on servers that don't see index.php as a
proper index file.

There is no hidden agenda behind the index.html, it is only there to
provide a blank page when someone starts snooping around your mambo
website.

I seem to have misinterpreted the lines from mambo.html.php:

                if ( !file_exists( $_CONFIG->SITEPATH . '/' . $siteTemplate
.'/index.html' ) ) {
                        echo $_LANG->_('TEMPLATE_WARN') . $cur_template;
                        return;
                }

I read it as a requirement or the warning gets displayed.

Hey Mike,

Where is this mambo.html.php that you are looking at? Is this part of
some 3rd party goodie?

BTW I have a stock Mambo here on my laptop for testing, and when I
remove a template's index.html I get no warning. Or am I not
understanding the problem?

Mitch,

It is in includes.  I checked a second 4.5.2 CVS unconfigured mambo I have
and it is in that includes directory as well, so, I don't believe it came
with any of the templates. 

Loading other templates is as far as I have gotten with configuring Mambo.

I think the problem is that there are a lot of 4.5.0 free templates floating
around and they need to be changed to make them work with 4.5.2 - what and
how is what I am looking into now.

Where are you getting this Mambo from? I am manually browsing the cvs
for 4.5.x on mamboforge and there is no mambo.html.php found anywhere
in the repository tree.

Mitch,

I got the CVS instructions from

http://mamboserver.com/cat/Download_Mambo/

and ran this on my Linux box

cvs -z5 -d:pserver:anonymous at cvs.mamboforge.net:/cvsroot/mambo co 4.5

I just did it again and the includes directory has the following:

adodb         footer.php        mambo.functions.php  phpmailer
Cache         getids.php        mambo.html.php       sef.php

You are checking out the old (discontinued) 4.5 version from cvs. Try this:

cvs -z5 -d:pserver:anonymous at cvs.mamboforge.net:/cvsroot/mambo co 4.5.x

And you will be looking at the current development version of Mambo
(4.5.3 development, yes some things are broken and under progress like
ADOdb)...

Sorry for the confusion, I will make sure that page gets corrected :-(

Thank you very much for helping to clear this up.  I would never have
figured that out as the install identifies itself as:

Mambo Version:   	 Mambo 4.5.2 CVS [Die Hard] 20/10/2004 01:31 GMT

on the system information page of the Admin interface.

I will download again!

Thanks again.

Mitch,

It now works!!!

I had to fix the following simple little bugs in the 4.5.x CVS version which
I am sure are already addressed, but in case it helps:

contact manager

admin.contact.php

line 264 
echo "<script> alert('". $_LANG->_( 'Select a record to' ); ." ". $action
."'); window.history.go(-1);</script>\n";

S/b (delete extra semi-colon)

echo "<script> alert('". $_LANG->_( 'Select a record to' ) ." ". $action
."'); window.history.go(-1);</script>\n";


template installer

installer.class.php (missing proper concatenation ".")

104 $this->setError( 1, $_LANG->_( 'Unrecoverable error' )'
"'.$zipfile->errorName(true).'"' );

s/b

104 $this->setError( 1, $_LANG->_( 'Unrecoverable error' ).'
"'.$zipfile->errorName(true).'"' );

184 $this->setError( 1, $_LANG->_( 'CCC' )'No filename specified' );

s/b

184 $this->setError( 1, $_LANG->_( 'CCC' ).'No filena        me specified'
);

243 $this->setError( 1, $_LANG->_( 'Installation file not found' )':<br />'
. $this->installDir() );

s/b

243 $this->setError( 1, $_LANG->_( 'Installation file not found' ).':<br />'
. $this->installDir() );


Now to load up dem templates!!

Amazing what using the correct command line can do for you. Sorry

This is development code, with six-to-twelve developers all committing

Excellent news though, happy to see you are finally started. Have fun!

Tell you what, I will help you figure this out, but you need to give
me some information so my guesses are more like educated guesses ;-)

What do you mean, were you giving the installer a bad mysql username,
or did you create the admin user with a password that you cannot
recall?

Knowing what version Mambo you are trying is also a big plus.

And I wish you could have made the presentation from last month, as I
would have loved to walk everyone through the installation of Mambo,
on either Windows or Linux platform.

You can get the latest API documentation from the following URL:

We are also setting up a cronjob that will spit out documentation for
the development branch (currently 4.5.3), and hope to have that up in

Also, the help site is getting tutorials published almost on a daily

SEFA and phpShop do definitely NOT get along well, and it appears that
the other SEF packages have problems with phpShop too. That causes me
to think phpShop is not as well-integrated with Mambo as advertised
:-/

Other than that, I have had success with it, and also use it for all
of the mamboserver.com sites.

I'm also curious about anyone's experience with the Xaneon extensions:

    http://mamboforge.net/projects/alias/

Would like to know - in general - what SEF goodies people have tried,
and their experiences.

I have not tried SEF Advanced but would like to. I have used the Xaneon 
Alias Manager. It works very well but I couldn't even begin to keep up 
with manually adding each alias. Their new release looks promising, but 
it isn't out yet. I want an automated solution and I have been under the 
impression that SEF Advanced is it. I haven't decided to commit any 
money to researching it as a solution, though.

It has been said a number of times that all of our SEF concerns are for 
humans, not actually search engines! Google and other search engines are 
not having any trouble indexing Mambo websites without SEF.

I haven't had the need yet to integrate any eCommerce solutions into 
Mambo but I also find it troubling that phpShop does not work with 
existing SEF solutions. That was going to be my solution. Ugh. :-(

Beware what you read. One good thing about search work is everyone can 
simply run a query and see for themselves what the current situation is.

What you get out of searching for yourself will be determined by how 
much effort you put into it. A "quick look" is often misleading, but 
alot of people do a "quick look", see they have dynamic URLs indexed in 
Google, and then say silly things like "dynamic URLs get indexed just fine".

Visit Google and examine the indexed pages for your own dynamic site. 
For example, if we can look at www.mamboserver.com by running a Google 
query :

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=allinurl:www.mamboserver.com

of course we see lots of dynamic pages in the index. 364 of them.

Now notice how many do not have "snippets". In other words, they appear 
in the index, but without any descriptive txt associated with them (the 
vast majority are "snippet-less").

Now 364 pages indexed should fill about 10 2/3 pages with 10 results on 
each page. But as you browse the google results set, on the 3rd page of 
results (28 mamboserver pages listed), you get this message from Google:

/In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some 
entries very similar to the 28 already displayed.
If you like, you can repeat the search with the omitted results included 
<http://www.google.com/search?q=allinurl:www.mamboserver.com&hl=en&lr=&filter=0>./

In other words, Google has determined that a mere 28 pages of 
www.mamboserver.com are "worthy" of display in the SERPs, and not very 
many ofthose are "worthy"of a full crawl/indexing with snippet. Now some 
may call that "getting indexed into Google". Do you?

Note: mamboserver is not a great example for demostration here, because 
they use www.mamboserver.com and mamboserver.com and many 
subdomains.mamboserver.com and also there are very very many other sites 
running 302 redirects against mamboserver.com. An 
allinurl:mamboserver.com (no www) query shows 249,000 indexed pages. 
However, many of those not actually being mamboserver.com at all but 
redirecting sites. Complications making analysis "harder".

Also notice how a query site:mamboserver.com shows 212 results (we did 
mamboserver.com and not the www server!) but the very first slot is held 
by a "redirect hijack"page. Again, very few snippets.

Bottom line:

Google does index and follow many dynamic URLs, sometimes veenones with 
massively complex get strings.
Google doe snot prefer dynamic URLs over statis URLs
Google prefers simple, word-oriented URLs over complex, cryptic URLs
Google has a very strict duplicate content filter, currently :-)

In my considered opinion every Mambo site desiring a search engine 
presence needs a search engine strategy. I don't agree with the phrase 
"search engine friendly", and I don't believe simple URL rewriting is a 
good solution for encouraging search engine inclusion. I also do not 
believe such efforts will have a positive impact on search rankings. 
You, thankfully, are able to check for yourselves.

Google queries to play with:

site:www.yousite.com.tld
allinurl:www.yousite.com.tld

and to browse all the nasty redirect hijacking that is in the SERPs take 
a look at something like
allinurl:mamboserver.com -site:mamboserver.com -site:www.mamboserver.com

Hahaha... first quit changing Mambo, and then get the PhD's at Google to 
quit messin around with their alogorithm, and I'll get your some 
concrete suggestons ;-)

Seriously, though, I have been considering how to do just that and some 
ideas are in the sausage machine.

Post Feb 2, 2005 the issues got messier with Google, and Google search 
optimization research now requires me to have a "real" site running on 
Mambo. None of my research/test sites satisfy the criteria required for 
Mambo optimizaton work.

The more I hear how 5 will be completely different than 4.x, well........

Howdy.

Another phpshop question...gah!

So when shop switches over to SSL on checkout, et al - Mambo still includes
files from outside SSL - thus poping up that annoying warning on IE.  Anyone
tackle this one?

Does Mambo not check what protocal is being used and adjust the includes
appropriately?  In this case it is a javascript file...I suppose I could
adjust the core to do this.

Thanks.

Well Chris, since you're so cool, I'll tell ya.

In /includes/frontend.php, in the mosShowHead function - if you're a logged
in user, then Mambo includes a javascript file with an absolute URL (using
$mosConfig_live_site - which is most likely set as HTTP).  You could change
that to HTTPS in your config file, but then it'll be pulling everything (SSL
or not) over HTTPS.

Might I suggest removing that absolute link in frontend.php?

Yours in the bond,
C 

Ps - phpshop also has an absolute link buried in the CC page...

PPs - for anyone still reading this - might there be an repercussions from
changing that absolute link to relative???

Chris and , um, Chris:

Yes, but not if you make darn sure you have BASE set on every page, to 
keep the links firmly within your domain.

That 302 redirect hijack thing is so pesky. I have been recommending 
absolute URLs site wide, *plus* BASE on every page just to make sure 
nothing is missed.

Well, I was hoping someone (aka Mitch) - might chime in with a solution to
this.  I've looked over the forums on this one before and haven't seen any
true solutions to moving Mambo in and out of SSL.

As I was thinking about it today, a solution would be to make the 'HTTP'
part of the $mosConfig_live_site separate, so it could change
accordingly...I thought of other crazy hacks, like putting the logic in the
config file (which would obviously get overwritten - or maybe putting it
right after the config is included)...

Because, and excuse me, because often my brain does not work well, won't a
BASE of HTTP within SSL give us that nasty MS pop-up and non-secure pages
(ie, no lock)...

I'll disclaim by saying I was answering only this part: 
"might there be an repercussions from
changing that absolute link to relative?"

After that, wouldn't

<base href="{if 
$request_type==SSL}{$HTTPS_SERVER}{else}{$HTTP_SERVER}{/if}{$YOUR_DIR}">

take care of it?

Mambo used to only load BASE when SEF was set to ON, so I probably don't 
know what I am talking about and it might be best to just ignore me (or 
perhaps take a look at the SEF section).

Egads, we need more beer then.

I am also wondering of the repercussions of SSLifying Mambo, and even
went out and got a shiny new SSL certificate thanks to GoDaddy.com. So
I hope to setup a test server for the core developers so we can all
muck around with it, hopefully in time for the 4.5.3 release. If not
by then, look for any fixes in 4.5.4. This is important enough to
warrant prioritization, IMHO.

I don't want to SSLify the entire website, as that would be slow. Chris is integrating a shopping cart, and the admin sections should of course be SSLable, but the rest of the site would suffer unduly under SSL. there appears to be some historical requesting of SSL for the admin side.

For what it's worth I will highlight that sometimes we want to send slightly different pages depending on the port of access.  The obvious example is robots.txt, but there are others. Something to keep in mind to limit some assumptions.

Also we should keep in mind what prompted Chris initially... IE's default-ON alert window that gets in the way if anything in  a secure page is not explicitly SSL. That hints at a page-level setting, which also satisfies the above. After all a URL is a view and not necessarily a file, right?

Sorry I wasn't being clear enough - what I want to know is how Mambo
can solve these problems, and what we will have to count on the
authors of mambo-phpshop to fix...

It is clear to me that no one would want to send their entire website
over SSL ;-)

Yah, I too was trying to have a weekend - so much so I didn't even turn my
computer on yesterday (gasp!).

I also wrote a subscription component for one of my clients, and the landing
page for that component checks for SSL and switches you over, if not under.
Of course, once inside, there's no way for me to bring them back (unless
they get to the last page where I can switch back inside the component)...

I'd be happy to point out all the places where I run into problems, but
again, mostly it is absolute links using mosConfig_live_site - which is used
inconsistenly within Mambo and certainly within 3rd party components - both
with images and javascript includes.

I posted this at forum.mamboserver.com a few days ago, not sure if I posted it lcearly enough or if I'm just spacing. I'm setting up a duplicate environment on my wife's Mac so I can take it to potential clients and demo a Mambo driven web-site. I installed MySQL and created a user, and was able to log in as that user with teh expected password. 

During the Mambo install, at the database part, I enter the username and password and I get a "Passwrod or username" is invalid. I tried the root user, and I tried going from "localhost" to the machines name. Yes, Mitch, I tried a different browser...I think...  :)

Any ideas on what to try next?

ciao!

Hey Leam,

You wouldn't perchance have the @ symbol in your password? I remember
reading something about that being an issue in Mambo, but don't
remember the details.

Also, check to see that phpinfo() shows the mysql client extension is
loading for mod_php... Once that is verified, you could write a quick
php/mysql script to test and debug the connection yourself. When we
get here I will post something.

Sorry I can't post more helpful info, but this has happened to me 
several times on different boxes with different Mambos since version 4. 
No obvious explanation, but a fresh install sometimes won't recognize 
the root pw assigned. After a whle I just accepted the fact that with 
Mambo I should never specify a pw on install, accept the random one, log 
in, and change the pw.

I was never able to fix the issue, even with a re-install, unless I went 
into MySQL and added an MD5(pw) manually.

A lost battle, I think...

I'm a little concerned and a little blah'd out by the browser issues I've run in to. Konquerer and Mozilla both had issues with the Admin interface. Mozilla hangs and Konquerer gets stuck in a loop of "Menu Edit" <-> "Login" and the "I" and "P" buttons don't work on the Editor. Safari (MacOS) has the same "I" and "P" issue, according to my wife.

I'm also still running in circles about how to use a template and upload html files and have them available on the site. I want to be able to help people who don't know a lot about web-design load up basic information. *I* can't even figure it out.  :(  The whole Admin interface organization leaves me baffled...

Just kinda blah'd on a Saturday. Hopefully those of you who know what you're doing will take the time to document your understandings for those of us who follow.

This isn't a Mac/Mambo issue, I tested out the install procedure on a remote machine. SO it's something in the mix of Mambo/MySQL/Apache/PHP on the Mac. I'll poke it in a bit and make sure the default install on a Mac works with Mambo.

I know there are folks out there using Mambo on a Mac without issue
(in fact, the former lead developer Robert Castley only used Macs). I
would love to find some vocal Mac users in the community to help
document and report bugs in the interface (hint, hint)

It is perhaps a collection of things both different and unrelated:

* the admin menus - these use JsCook, and are tested on all browsers
and platforms, not sure what issues are there for the Mac
* default WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE) - this one is not perfect, and you
can switch to many others instead - FCKEditor, HTMLArea3 for example
* phpShop tabs - in the Mac the tabs for the phpShop administrator are
black, appears to be using some goofy CSS that the Mac doesn't
appreciate. This should be labeled as a bug with mambo-phpshop.

I want to be able to help people who don't know a lot about web-design load up basic information. *I* can't even figure it out.  :(  The whole Admin interface organization leaves me baffled...

Maybe we should start several threads that are separate and detailed.
I'm happy to point out everything that I can (which is a LOT).

I am grabbing a cigar and skateboard (strange combination, I know) and
taking the kids to the park. So, as one of my favourite ancient NNTP
sigs says, "Turn off your computer and go outside."  :-)

That would be a good start.

Please understand that I install Mambo at least 10 times a day - every
time I refresh my local development copy from CVS (and my local linux
server as well) and all the sites that I help with, plus dozens of
different development sites for paying work.

I've never had a problem submitting a custom password at the
installation stage, on windows or linux, using IE, firefox, konqueror,

So if you can reproduce this one, I am desperate for details so I can
log it as a bug and get it fixed :-)

Are you using username at hostname?
It could be a hostname permission thing.

Message-ID: <423F8F98.2030304@nyphp.org>

We have posted Mitch's February presentation to New York PHP on Mambo.  
Sorry for the delay.  You will find for your reading pleasure a PDF of 
his slides and an MP3 for your listening pleasure.

Mambo <http://www.mamboserver.com/> core developer and New York PHP's 
Mitch Pirtle looks at one of the hottest topics, CMS, and one of it's 
hottest solutions, Mambo. Join us for an in-depth look at Mambo's power 
as a CMS and framework. Now that the holidays are over we can get back 
to work - and in this case, that means letting the award-winning Mambo 
do all of the work for you!

This session will demonstrate how simply and quickly one can get Mambo 
up and running, and then delve into the deeper mysteries of the CMS that 
promises 'power in simplicity'. Covering templates, components, modules 
and mambots, Mitch will then close the session answering questions from 
the NYPHP crowd.

Mambo was awarded "Best Open Source Solution" at Linux World this year 
and was awarded "Best Free Software Project of the Year" by The Linux 
Format magazine.

Nice slides, Mitch! I gave a presentation to the Nashville PHP User 
Group (NPHUG) this month about Mambo! Looks like we're on the same page 
down here in the South. My presentation was video-taped and will be 
available soon on our site (http://www.phpusers.net) to bore you with. ;)

I usually give seminars to existing users showing them how to use their 
new website. The audience of the NPHUG presentation was obviously more 
technically inclined and I attempted to expose the power under the hood 
of Mambo as a result. I gave out a printed handout that contained a few 
of the new docs released: Core Database Tables, Index Flowchart for 
4.5.2, and two other pages from the manual with general ACL info. I also 
handed out a CD containing user and developer tutorials as well as a 
code section with the latest version of Mambo and popular addons.

We initially spent time with the two new documents in the handout, 
answering any questions that came up along the way. Everyone seemed to 
like this "from the insides out" approach and these new docs were a BIG 
help in explaining the details. As I mentioned, I usually focus on the 
end user in these presentations so I was a little out of my element but 
did fine with the help of these new materials.

Once we got through the handout items we were going to turn to a 
real-world example but our Internet connection didn't work...so I 
improvised a bit and walked them through a few of the tutorials that I 
had on the handout CD.  I will forward the link to my archived 
presentation when it is available.

My goal for the presentation was to educate our local PHP users in the 
ways of Mambo so that they might use it in future projects or utilize 
some of the ideas/techniques used by Mambo to build their own customized 
CMSs. Everyone had lots of questions about module positions, menu items, 
mambots, etc. I tried to answer them as well as I could. It appeared 
that everyone left a little sleepier and more aware of how Mambo worked 
so I guess it was a success. ;)

It is easy to turn off polls, in the admin interface it's "Components"-> "Polls" and click the "Published" link so it is off.

How do you get rid of the "Poll" section header on the Front Page? Didn't see it on the "Frontpage Manager".

Depends on how exactly you want to display the file. If you want that
html file to be treated just like content, you can cut-n-paste into a
blank content item to 'insert' it as content. If you want the page to
be viewed completely outside Mambo, you could just use ftp and drop it
at the document root for your site.

Are there other ways or reasons that you would try to do this?

There are 3rd party components that integrate with Mambo to do this
kind of stuff from the database perspective, but what I usually do for
each site is also setup an admin site that includes phpMyAdmin so they
can backup their database on their own, however they like to.

One thing that would be cool would be a sort of web-based file
manager, but as ftp has always worked for backing up the files, there
was never much demand for it.

There used to be a simplified database backup utility built into
Mambo, but licensing issues with the author forced us to remove it.
There has yet to be someone that steps up to replace it, but
phpMyAdmin seems to be everywhere so that may not be such a big deal.

Or is it? Comments, questions anyone?

The easiest way to turn off the Polls module. That doesn't change any
of your polls from the component side, or remove any data - it just
turns off the display of that module.

I'm guessing that leam had the same problem I had; turning off the Polls
module still left the "Polls" title on the front page (depending on
theme, IIRC).

In the theme I was playingwith, I had to edit the main menu to remove
the "Polls" section header.

No, it wasn't intuitive.

Yuck, whatever that template is, get rid of it ASAP ;-)

That is a cardinal sin - never, NEVER hardcode title or content or
module info in a template, for this exact reason. We spent hours
implementing the little feature so you could turn titles on or off for
just about everything, content, components, modules, you name it.

Whenever you are editing something, look for a 'Parameters' tab.
Chances are, if you need it, you can decide whether that item's title
is displayed or not.

I would like the old functionality of the Module in content bot that 
was written for 4.5 1.0.9. This allowed you to call a module into 
content by its title like {modulebot module=sumoduletitle right}. The 
current capability of calling a template position into content while 
nice doesn't allow me to randomly call in different modules which I use 
to call in ads.

Then I would call that a downgrade ;-)

I have two approaches for this one, the first simply defining whatever
module positions I want, and assigning the different modules to each
of those positions. You can then set each module to load or not load
depending on the position AND section/category.

If this is all about banner ads - have you looked at phpAds and the
phpAdsNew Mambo module? That ad server's feature list is
mind-boggling, and certainly looks like a viable candidate for you.

I'd like to know anyone's experiences with that setup, as I haven't
had time to try it myself.

I have been using this on 4 sites for a few months now. You may be 
right that this is an arcane way of doing it. Maybe I won't need it, 
unfortunately I have around 150 + articles with that bit of code in it 
now and changing it may be somewhat of a bigger project than I want to 
go through and I do like the old modulebot as it offers the added 
benefit of not being tied into a user position.

I am using phpadsnew and yes there are an enormous number of options 
most of which I use.  I am testing the new module that was written for 
phpadsnew and mambo and will probably use that for future in-line 
advertising.

Yes, of course. If I were to have a client who had a static page site and wanted things moved over quickly, how easy would it be for them to migrate things to Mambo keeping the static pages where they are until they get into the CMS? 

A simple guide "Here's how you put links on your Mambo front page to your static pages, and have them pop up in a seperate window. Or the same window."

Yes, it's a rather largish deal. Remember, we want our clients to be able to do the day-to-day stuff while we do the real glitzy admin thingies. So if my client is going to put a bunch of stuff into the database I'd love for them to have a button that says "back up database and site" before they start on things. *I* can do it by hand in a variety of ways, but my client base, if it ever grows, might not be as phpAdmin savvy as we'd like. They may whack the entire thing and then ask me to recover it.

I'd rather *not* think about them having access to phpMyadmin, thank you...

Then let's narrow this down to several possibilities, and heach can
have some sort of description:

1) You just ftp the html files to the document root for your website,
and link to those URLs from within content and/or menus

2) You link to the static content with a menu of the wrapper type,
which basically loads that static content inside Mambo from within an
IFRAME

3) You import the static content directly into your Mambo site, where
you can then manipulate it just like everything else

There are projects on mamboforge that provide this, I'd look into that
then. As 4.5 is in stable, we can't really introduce any new features
unless we are forced to due to technical issues, bugs or security
problems. So we cannot add any of this to the core until 5.0, but
there are projects on mamboforge that do this, and should be easy to
install.

Wait a minute, so you didn't have to edit the template right? If you
just edited the menu then I can understand, but I am absolutely
certain that Andy (the guy that creates our templates) would never
hardcode a module's title in the actual template HTML.

I've had a hard time figuring out the best way of doing this; I can't 
figure out the best way of just adding an "article" or "page" in 
Mambo.  News items are usually shown in the tutorials I've looked at..

Thanks for any guidance.

There is a right way to do this, and a wrong way to do this ;-)

The wrong way is to unpublish that particular poll by going into
Components :: Polls. The problem with this is that the Poll module is
still being published, it is just empty (you have only unpublished
that particular poll)...

The right way to do this is by going to Modules :: Site Modules and
unpublishing the module called Polls. That takes everything away, and
there are no changes required to the template.

Does that clear it up? Or am I the one confused? LOL

No offense, but how were we supposed to know that?  I never would have
thought of that, unless I wanted to disable Polls on the whole site
maybe.

But isn't that what you wanted to do? LOL

Okay, point well taken. I am planning on giving two presentations here in NYC:

1) a hands-on tour of Mambo and getting started (to avoid scenarios like above)
2) get your hands dirty writing custom Mambo applications (for actual
development)

As soon as I have the venue figured out, I will make an announcement :-)

I think you might want to structure your tutorials with a "large to small" transition. That is, "You can turn modules on or off here. For example, if you want to turn off all polls, click here. If you just want one of several polls up at a time, publish only the one you want, here."

ciao!

This might be a silly question, but can I edit static content through the 
user log-on ( not the administration log-on), or  how can I enable such a 
feature.  I know that an administrator can edit news stories and section 
content, but for the static content I do not get the edit icon. 

I have a user who is confused by the administration area, he prefers to 
traverse the site and edit the content as he is seeing it.

This is probably going to make me look rediculous, but how do you 
change the order of the list of files that gets presented to you when 
you pop-up a browse window in lets say a mambo editor where you would 
be looking to place an image.

What editor do you have enabled?  If I am not mistaken, will need to 
modify the editor script - htmlarea3 displays the directory listing in 
alphabetical order.  The editor scripts are located in the mambots folder.

It seems to fail in installation/install2.php, the line "stepBack2".:

  if (!($mysql_link = @mysql_connect( $DBhostname, $DBuserName, $DBpassword ))) {
                db_err ("stepBack2","The password and username provided are incorrect.");
        }

        if($DBname == "") {
                db_err ("stepBack","The database name provided is empty.");

At least that's the error window I'm seeing pop up. Any thoughts on maybe something isn't in the Mac/Apache build?

I went to their site, and since this is a paid support product, you should 
contact them on how to customize the directory listing in the popup.

When you define the username is it in the form "user at localhost", or
something similar, or do you just use "user"?

I have had very good success with it and have it running on about 20 
domains. I just need to get the list order straightened out and that 
will take care of my last functional stress with it.

There are a couple of components that I have had a hard time with, one 
being events from the front - end and the other being mos Directory 
from Phil Taylor, but in the latter the only problem is in the category 
creation, everything else in MOSdirectory works fine.

I haven't played much with htmlarea3 xtd or fckedit. I think htmlarea3 
ext has a paste from word option in it as well.

wwpro will also create xhtml compliant code. The bad side is that it 
will mangle < of this string <!-- inside javascript code on reopen for 
no apparent reason.

More info, though no solution. The packet going back has the right username and password, at least as reported by tcpdump. I'm thinking there is just a missing library or something. Where is mysql_connect kept?

What are the minimum privileges a Mambo user needs? Do the privileges change after install, where you might not need to create tables and such?

Can you paste the exact error message here then? I am starting to
suspect you are not loading the mysql extension for php...

Well, you will at least be able to connect, insert, update, delete,
and create/drop tables in order to install other components and such.

What I usually do is keep each mambo database separate with a
different user, so that each website can only connect to their own
database. Then you can start locking down that user's permissions
without affecting other sites.

On the agenda for tonight. I need a demo to show a client next week and
and I'm not able to afford a linux based laptop yet. So I need to use my
wife's Mac to do the demo.  :)

Actually, here's the first paragraph from phpinfo():

'/SourceCache/apache_mod_php/apache_mod_php-17.5/php/configure' '--prefix=/usr' '--mandir=/usr/share/man' '--infodir=/usr/share/info' '--with-apxs' '--with-ldap=/usr' '--with-kerberos=/usr' '--enable-cli' '--with-zlib-dir=/usr' '--enable-trans-sid' '--with-xml' '--enable-exif' '--enable-ftp' '--enable-mbstring' '--enable-mbregex' '--enable-dbx' '--enable-sockets' '--with-iodbc=/usr' '--with-curl=/usr' '--with-config-file-path=/etc' '--sysconfdir=/private/etc'

Since I don't see mysql, I'm thinking you're right. This is the default PHP that came on the Mac. Off to get the source. Any other suggested configure options?

ciao!

Well....

I got a Mac binary for PHP that has MySQL included. Still get the same error, even after having restarted apache. Still get the "The password and username provided are incorrect." in install1.php.

There are a couple things you can do at this point, one of which is
create your own php script that connects and lists something from
mysql. If that works, then you have a fully functional webserver and
there is something with the data in the tables, or configuration of
that particular virtual host.

If the script doesn't work, then you need to make sure there is a
section from your pjpinfo() script that lists the client version of
MySQL and so on - without that section, the extension is definitely
not being loaded.

localhost. Also trying the server's name. Neither worked. 

Mitch, I even used a different browser.  :)

And, just to be perverse, I tried having the linux install point to the Mac db and vice versa. After confusing myself for a bit the Mac install (MacOS Mambo, Linux Web client, Linux DB host) worked. The Linux Web client, Linux Mambo server, Mac DB host (using the remote host name and a user with % for host privileges) failed. 

I'm fading. Will try to get back to this either tomorrow night or this weekend.

ciao!
