Subject: [joomla] Shopping cart with gift certificate purchase and redemption
Message-ID: <406251.61601.qm@web35607.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Before I start trying to customize Virtuemart to achieve this --

Does anyone know of a shopping cart system that will allow users to purchase gift certificates online, and with the option to redeem the gift certificates online or offline?

It would have to create a unique serial number for the certificate, email it to the user, have a way to verify the coupon code for online redemptions, and possibly track partial usage of the coupon.

I don't know about virtuemart, but for offline purchases you could  
just set-up another product

Recently updated a couple of personal sites to 1.5.  Not real happy  
with TinyMCE as an editor. I am quite disappointed in image management  
or the lack of.  As I am a photographer adding images to articles is  
pretty much a given.  Was wondering what other people are using before  
I go through installing another editor.

I have used FCK in the past and was happy mostly.  I have read that it  
was not playing nicely with Joomla 1.5 have your experiences been  
different?

Message-ID: <707196.34329.qm@web34202.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

My apologies for the delay in getting this announce
out...  Here's April's meeting...

Aprils meeting will be held at Robert Half (245 Park
Ave, 25th Floor) as usual, on Thursday, April 10th
starting at 6:00pm.  Here?s the breakdown for this
month:

6:00 ? 6:30 : General meet and greet, no formal
structure.

6:30 ? 7:00 : Question and Answer sessions.

7:00 ? 8:00 : Joomla vs. Drupal, by Forrest Mars.  
In a talk that's sure to be simultaneously
light-hearted and heavy-hitting, Forest Mars breaks
down the differences (and some similarities) between
the Joomla! and Drupal content management systems,
neither of which, it should be noted, are even in the
top 10 of CMSes (according to a secret study not
released by Google.) The talk is aimed primarily at
Joomla! developers who want to see how the other half
lives, which is somewhat logical since migration from
Drupal to Joomla is a bit like driving the wrong way
during a Grand Prix. 

Forest Mars is a Web Developer and Network Architect
best known for starting New York's Only Free Internet
Cafe and the first Wireless ISP in Manhattan. He is
currently working on a Video-on-Demand system for
smart phones, but then who isn't? Contact him directly
via forest-at-bway-dot-net.

8:00 ? 8:30 : More Q&A / Site Showcase

8:30 ? Whenever ? TGI Fridays (47 East 42nd St).

Re: gift certificates: Have you looked at using virtuemart's coupon
feature as a gift certificate?  I haven't used their coupons so I don't
know how well it works, but looks like a coupon could be set up as a
percentage or a total amount. Just a thought.

Yes, I'm familiar with Virtuemart's coupon.   You can't use the same coupon # for all gift certificates you sell.   Coupons are created manually in Virtuemart so you would have to program Virtuemart to create a unique coupon code every time a gift certificate was sold.

IIRC there still is a search inside PHPBB, which our loving
supermoderator Brad has implemented sphinx for.  :-)

Thanks, Forest, for a wonderful presentation last night on the differences and similarities between Joomla and Drupal.

The Drupal site showcase mentioned by Forest, for anyone who didn't geta chance to write it down, is http://www.drupalsites.net.

As a follow-up to the discussion re YouTube clones, here is a demo of Seyret Video, a Joomla component: http://demo.templateplazza.com/video_plazza/

(Template Plazza created a template around Seyret, but the component pretty much looks like this out-of-the-box.)

Drupal: 30 minutes
Joomla: 3 minutes
;-)

It was suggested that we have a Show & Tell at the end of each meeting.  Anthony, can we fit this in to the meetings?  Maybe 3-5 minutes for each person who wants to participate?

Hi folks

I was looking for a Joomla mailing list and came across yours, which 
seemed to be the most decent one among all I looked at. (I don't really 
like participating in forums because of their "usability" features.)

I'm new to Joomla and have a couple of questions about this CMS, but I'm 
not sure whether your group is the right place to ask, for you've been 
only talking about some meetings and conferences until now.

May I still ask some silly questions :-) here, or would you rather 
redirect me to some other place where I could do it?

Thanks,
Andrew

I don't do forums often due to the trolls. As the moderator of this
list I can assure you there is no leniency here as a result ;-)

Maybe asking if you can ask a question can be called a silly question,
however let 'er rip! This is a pretty fun list of good people, and
everyone here pitches in where they can. You'll be surprised at the
breadth of knowledge and skills on this list.

Thanks for the warm welcome, guys! :-)

Uh, where to start... :-) Okay, I have to build this website, which 
consists of three sub-sites that look pretty similar (same design, same 
topic, similar content) but are accessed via different URLs. The 
simplified structure looks like this:

site 1 <-- accessed via www.site1.abc
     home
     events
     contact
site 2 <-- accessed via www.site2.abc
     home
     about
     contact
site 3 <-- accessed via www.site3.abc
     main
     about
     events
     archive

The sites are not linked to each other; "site N"'s are not visible in 
menus; the sites look completely independent. They are hosted on the 
same server which allows domain mapping, i.e. I can redirect all 
requests to a single Joomla installation.

Now the question is: how do I set three default pages, so that Joomla 
can select the correct one depending on the requested URL? Is this 
possible at all? Any workarounds?

Thanks in advance!

Good grief, what a silly question.

*spacemonkey ducks under desk as the entire list throws tomatoes at him

Ok, seriously now. Here's a good place to start looking:

    http://extensions.joomla.org/component/option,com_mtree/task,listcats/cat_id,1790/Itemid,35/

Ultimately you need to decide if you're going with Joomla 1.0 or 1.5,
as your options are different depending on that decision. There are
many folks on this list that probably have more experience than I
using one or more of these extensions, as I tend to spend most of my
time (if not all) under the hood at the framework level.

Anyone else out there with experience doing this?

Thanks, Mitch. Most of these extensions are commercial, the rest do not 
support version 1.5 (and I'd like to try this one out). Besides, if I 
understood correctly, these extensions allow to manage multiple sites 
from one backend, which is not my case. I might be wrong, but I've got a 
feeling that having a separate installation for each of my three sites 
(which are very alike, like I mentioned) is an overkill.

A thought about a nasty cheat just crossed my mind: I could create a 
separate menu for each site, which would only be visible if "in itself", 
and a non-joomla welcome page (which I need anyway). From that page, I 
could redirect visitors to the "Homes" of the corresponding menus 
depending on the requested URL. Since Joomla is installed in a 
subdirectory, no 'index.php' clashes will occur.

I know it's quite a special case anyway, and my cheat is not even 
Joomla-related, but still, what do you think?

Path of least resistance, that's a sound strategy and if it suits your
needs then you're done :-)

I think at the last meeting someone mentioned 1and1 webhost and a negative experience with them.  Am I remembering correctly and does anyone know what the problem at 1and1 was?

I'm asking because I have 2 new clients who are hosting with them.

How about 3 different installs, but share the same database with the
same table prefix. The default is jos_. This way, any material you add
to one 'site' will be available in the others. You may have to share the
same template, but if you use different templates with the same name,
that may give you the variation in look that you need.

As always, test locally first.

I have several sites up with them. Anthony claims that they are using an
older version of mysql while setting the system to report using a newer
version. Anthony also had trouble getting a domain released so he could
move it to another hosting provider.

I haven't run into those problems myself.

I've found that Joomla 1.5 is slow on the sites that I have up. I
haven't called them and asked them to move the sites to faster servers.
Perhaps next week I'll try that and let you know how it goes.

I've also found that I've had issues with the built in sef on the 1and1
hosts. If I recall, the configuration setting didn't help at first, but
that was with 1.5.1, and I haven't revisited the issue with 1.5.2

1and1 has a lot of easy to use management tools in their web interface.
I like that when you have to set up a site for a group, and you aren't
getting paid for it. You can set them up, point them to the tools, and
let them manage it themselves from that point forward.

I've also found the support at 1and1 to be good. I think they have 24x7
phone support. Short waits. Always helpful.

Best,
Mark

Like Anthony, I have had problems with 1 and 1 doing whatever they could 
to prevent me from changing registrars.

Here's what happened.  When I tried to change registrars on one of my 
domains, they closed my account.  The technical and admin email 
addresses were on that domain, so I couldn't receive email.  In order 
for my new registrar to make the change, they needed me to confirm it 
via email.  I couldn't get the email, and the change was held up for 
about a month.  In the meantime, I couldn't use the web site because the 
account was closed, and I wasn't receiving any email.  I called them 
many times.  Yes, they usually answered the phone quickly, but every 
time I called for status they had an excuse, saying that their transfer 
department was working on it, and that I would receive a callback with 
status within 24 hours.  They never called back.  One time I got one of 
them to give me his extension.  When I called it, it was a non-existent 
number.  And they would never transfer me to their transfer department.  
I finally opened a new account using the same name, just so I could 
change the email addresses registered with the domain.  Now they keep 
sending me billing notices for $3.86 for the few days the account was 
re-opened.  I would definitely stay away from them.

Thanks, Mark. The information on my sites is different, only the 
structure is very similar, so if I decide in favor of 3 different 
installations, I would also use 3 separate databases to be more flexible.

Speaking of templates: is it possible to slightly change the installed 
template dynamically depending on the requested "page"? For example 
(simplified), if a visitor goes to "books", there is a book image in the 
background, and on "cars" it's a car?

Yes that is pretty simple, it is an option in the template manager

Thanks, Norman. The only options I found there change the template 
statically and apply to the whole template, i.e. to all the "pages" this 
template is installed for. (Hope I was looking at the right place.) What 
I'd like to achieve, however, is a dynamic template change. I know this 
can be done by using modules, but modules belong to content and not to 
layout (right?). Consider this a "principle" question. :-)

Subject: [joomla] autopublish menu's
Message-ID: <352c93420804250914s73d13464sad0c0da89692fdf1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Is there anybody who knows of a way to autopublish menu items that link to a
category blog lay-out once the first content  is added to the category and
vice versa, unpublish the menu item when no content is published.
Something like the way a module works when you use <?php if mosCountmodules
thing in the template?
I've been breaking my head over this all day. Really hope somebody can help.
I could also use the pagination result but I would have to be able to show
this loose from the content or at least on top of the content.
Which I can't seem to get worksing either

Regards,
Debbie Salemink

But the original question was:

"Now the question is: how do I set three default pages, so that Joomla can
select the correct one depending on the requested URL?"


So either it's going to be separate installs, in which case Joomla *isn't*
going to select the correct one, or if you are doing a single install, then
it seems like you've answered your own question. In any case it sounds like
you are just looking to clone some of your structure and templating.

<obligatory Drupal comment> Of course in Drupal switching between 3
databases on the fly is borderline trivial. :::ducks:::
</close Drupal troll>

Having done single Joomla! installs accessed via multiple front-ends /
domains, I can only say it's quite fun once you've wrapped your brain around
it, and I highly recommend that approach either as a solution, or even just
for the experience of setting it up. You do have to *trick* it a little to
install, but after that it runs flawlessly. I'd also suggest reading up on
MVC (Model-View-Controller) which Joomla mainly conforms to.

cheers,

Yeah, and see where I am now? ;-) Considering whether the option I was
running from is a better solution!

Same template, single database, same backend, same extension config.
Data is assigned to "sites" by means of sections/categories. It's not
cloning (which would mean "having several instances"), it's keeping
things as compact as possible.

There we go -- *how* did you do that? Was your problem similar to mine?
What was the trick? (Of course I understand there must be some trick,
but my brain just refuses to produce a reasonable guess, that's why I
asked that very first question.)

NB: I don't want to hack the Joomla's core, despite the fact that this
would be a dirty but quick solution. I'm still looking for a "legal"
way. :-)

This design pattern is not new to me, but I'm afraid I can't see the
connection...

Not *really* a hack at all, certainly not a core hack. Trying to recall
exactly what I had to do, because I thought the Joomla installer allows you
to drop all existing tables, but I remember there were places where it
complained about something already existing. What I ended up doing was some
behind the scenes manual deletion, then running the installer on the next
domain but using the same settings. A quick check of the config files and
all the sites, each with their own config files, were running off a single
database. After that it was just a matter of templating the sites (you would
never imagine they were in any way related the templates were so different)
and of course  creating separate block I mean module definitions for each
domain.

I'd welcome the opportunity to do another install like that again, seemed
like I was having to just push what Joomla is set up to do just enough that
I had to do some work-a-rounds, but not enough I had to violate the core.

cheers,

Forest Mars
