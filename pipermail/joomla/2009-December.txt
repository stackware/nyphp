I've used it recently and had a hard time fiddling with the layout for
hours. It didn't come out good, but...

Maybe I'll give it another try.

I used it here:
http://www.riojarestaurantweek.com/index.php?field_rrwmkt=NYMetro&field_offer=all&search.x=29&search.y=30&search=Search&option=com_sobi2&Itemid=5&no_html=0&sobi2Task=axSearch&sobiCid=0&SobiSearchPage=0

Now, due to my own ignorance at the time, I disabled ajax and rewrote the
search pages a bit.........   but now that I'm familiar with it, I could do
the same and keep ajax on.

What I did find with the templates is that there are a lot of formatting
instructions that are applied to the default variables - ie they are already
html coded so it can be difficult to do some things.  But you can get access
in the template to the raw data if you need it[for example, I needed raw
data in order to create the google static maps] and then you have a lot more
control.

My plan was/is to do a short presentation on it at the meeting on the 10th
and combine it with a working trip down to the city that day.

However, monkey wrench thrown into the plans is that my wife is having
surgery on the 8th[just found out today] so I may end up cancelling the trip
- and I honestly won't know until Wednesday the 9th if I can go or not.  :-(

Plan on spending time with your wife, catering to her every whim. She'll 
probably appreciate it and I've found it a good reminder of what's 
important in life.

I just wanted to make sure that everyone here was aware of the NYC BigApps
contest:

http://www.nycbigapps.com/

The idea is to build some sort of data mashup application using one or more
of the publicly available data sets.

Even if you lack the time to make a credible chance of winning, a decent app
will raise your profile and could lead to more work AND of course if you use
Joomla, hint hint, it helps rais all of our favortie CMS' profile. :-)

Message-ID: <1259950456.23597.97.camel@jersey>

I've been looking for hours. Hopefully someone on this list knows how to
fix this:

On checkout in a virtuemart store, there is a login page that has an
accordion / stretcher that doesn't have enough vertical space. The
stretcher div is 135 pixels high, and it cuts off the 'remember me'
checkbox and label.

Does anyone know where to change the height assigned to this? It's using
mootools to open up a form.

The good news is that I'm much more acquainted with virtuemart. The bad
news is that I know it much more intimately than I really care to. Also,
this problem is keeping me from getting to fixing the other annoying
crap that's wrong with it.

Any guidance, no matter how brief, is much appreciated.

Thanks,
Mark

Yeah, I had a client with that exact same issue when using a RocketTheme template.

I had to do some fiddling with the html/css.  What a pain!

which template are you using on the site?

In answer to my own question:

I'm putting this up so that others may not have to waste a few hours of
their life chasing this down.

Issue: virtuemart checkout cutting off half of 'remember me' checkbox in
the login form

Fix: edit the file:
components/com_virtuemart/themes/YOUR
THEME/templates/checkout/login_registration.tpl.php

line 54 is:
/*fixedHeight:125,*/

change to:
fixedHeight:145,

When you change the line, you also remove the comment syntax so that the
line is not ignored. 

If anyone knows of a better fix, I'm all ears!

cheers,

I see you have already fixed it, but you may find this a little helpful.

Virtuemart has a "debug mode" - when you enable it it will place little
graphical question marks on the page for each template, and if you hover the
mouse over them it will show you which template file is being used to create
the html being displayed.

A lot quicker to find changes that way.

Scratch out that fix. It restricts the height of the register form when
you check the register radio button. Oh well, back under the hood for
me.

Ok, this works better:

append at the end of the file, after the final </form> tag

<div>
<br />
</dif>

to components/com_virtuemart/themes/YOUR

I see you have already fixed it, but you may find this a little helpful.

Virtuemart has a "debug mode" - when you enable it it will place little
graphical question marks on the page for each template, and if you hover the
mouse over them it will show you which template file is being used to create
the html being displayed.

A lot quicker to find changes that way.

Scratch out that fix. It restricts the height of the register form when
you check the register radio button. Oh well, back under the hood for
me.

Ok, this works better:

append at the end of the file, after the final </form> tag

<div>
<br />
</dif>

Subject: [joomla] Why the mootools love?
Message-ID: <4bffc350912051135xa78c1d7s5cfa531a898a68db@mail.gmail.com>

I've always wondered about this one.  I'm not a big framework person, but I
have worked in both Mootools and JQuery a bit, and I've always wondered why
the continued love of Mootools?

For a CMS encouraging third party devs, Mootools seems like the WORST
possible choice.   For lazy programmers, Mootools seems like a great choice.

I admit, Mootools is easier to grasp quickly, to code for, etc.  It is more
"fun".  But that fun comes at a cost[and maybe this has changed since I last
looked deeply].

Mootools doesn't use a namespace.  Over half the troubleshooting I've done
on sites setup by others, when it involves weird front end stuff, is because
of mootools.  Specifically, it's because some of the other components
installed are not using mootools and there is a function name conflict
between the libraries mootools loads, and the libraries in the other code.

JQuery, by contrast, HAS  a namespace.  It is much harder to cause a
function name conflict that blows the javascript on a page out of the
water.  It's less "fun" to program in, but you don't run into stupid
problems.

And when you want to encourage people to download and install third party
apps, it seems to me that your base supported javascript library should
encourage that by not causing conflicts!

Anyone know why mootools is getting so strongly embedded in Joomla[I see
they had some sessions at the Dev Conference] instead of going to a sane
platform?  Is mootools finally gonna adopt namespaces?  Or is this just the
result of joomla front end devs not wanting to recode all the javascript
into something less programmer friendly?

I think Gary said he wasn't going to be able to make it.

I wonder if I should give a demo of this component if I can't answer any questions about it. :-(

FYI,

The Vt. JUG is planning a JoomSki weekend -- one day of hands-on Joomla training and one day of skiing -- in March 2010, if anyone is interested.

I added this to our JoomlaNYC.org calendar.

Nice calendar, Laura!  JEvents has really improved.

Wow...would people really be interested in something like that?

I know I could arrange such a lot closer at the local sky centers in the
Catskills.  Only a 2 to 3 hour drive away.

Not a winter person, so I'm not up for the skying, but I sure am up to
organizing such an event on the Joomla side.  And I know a couple great
trainers who might like to help out - as well as some local travel people
who could suggest and arrange the location.

I can shoot an email to Hans Z. asking him to make the change.  I've found
the NYPHP folks very accomodating.

As a PHP programmer first and a Joomla user second, I've always found NYPHP
as the logical home for the Joomla email list... but based on the fact that
many Joomla users don't even know, nor do they need to, that it is written
in PHP perhaps it's not. :-)

As for the website, I've been mulling that for a while and have a few[aka
many] suggestions:

1) There should be an about us page with a general overview of the group
2) There should be a history page covering the founding of the group through
organizing NYC's second JoomlaDay
3) We need to stress strongly that ALL skill levels of Joomla are welcome at
the meetings.  One thing I recommend is strongly encouraging non-coders to
come early to the meeting and schedule the non-techie stuff for the
beginning and save the techie stuff for the end
4) Encourage people new to joomla or considering Joomla to RSVP and ask them
to make a note that they are new to Joomla[perhaps set a checkbox] - and
place a count on the website of how many newbies are coming.  If we KNOW
there are 3 or 4 complete new people, than schedule a short 15 minute
"welcome to Joomla" demo for them.  Things like "this is how you can
dynamically change the menu"..."this is how you can edit content on the
frontpage".."this is how you add new content"...  Really BASIC stuff.   I
know this was one of the things I did at the start of meetings, because
quite frankly this kind of demo is not "sexy" and it doesn't show off your
"skillz" so it is hard to find people willing to do the basics - but these
basics are what really really attract new people to Joomla.  The fact that
once a site is up, they do NOT need to call a web designer for every little
content change.  Of course, this also means you need a few volunteers to
present this - which shouldn't be too hard, just have a standard demo site
everyone can use and run through the basics.  If there is a page where
people can tell if newbies are coming, then a volunteer will step
forward[I'd also say take it to the next level and 2 or 3 days before the
meeting, have the volunteer be able to send an email out to those newbies
"Thanks for your RSVP, Marian Konop from Gotham Informatics,
http://www.gothaminformatics.com, has volunteered to give you a brief demo
at the upcoming meeting on X at Y time.  Please make sure to come or let us
know if something has come up and you need to cancel"]
5) Regular presentors should have bio pages on the website.  Something like:
Laura Gordon of RyTech Sites, http://www.rytechsites.com/ is a regular
presentor at Joomla NYC.
[brief bio]
She has recently presented on
X - brief description and date
Y -brief description and date
Z -brief description and date

6) Irregular presentors should be able to put up a bio page the month of and
the month after a meeting.  Something like
Rafael ??? of Dioscouri Designs, http://www.dioscouri.com/
[brief bio]
Demonstrating their new online shopping system Tienda on X date

Most of this stuff is basic content editing, a directory component of some
sort[SOBI2, K2, etc] and then a little coding on the RSVP side which I could
work on during my dead week at the end of the month.

Gary,

I agree that we should add an About Us page (#1-3).

And we do have a bio page and presentation page.  The bio page is called Card Exchange, for anyone who attends a meeting.  And all presenters are encouraged to add any materials from the slideshow to the website's Meetings/Presentations download section.

We don't have "regular presenters" and I don't think we ever will because people come and go.

As far as gathering info from the RSVP and developing a presentation or demo around the requests, I believe that would be a job in itself.  Are you volunteering for the job? ;-)   I believe that decisions about what presentations we are interested in should be done at the meeting by people who are participating in the meetings.  People volunteer their presentation, or volunteer to arrange for someone outside our group to come in and give a presentation, and we decide whether it is something we want at the meeting.

For people to email in and say I want to see this and learn that, and the rest of us jump and do it, I for one am not fond of that idea.  I think the group is based on mutual sharing, that people need to take the initiative to go on the Joomla.org site and other resource sites, and then follow up with discussions in the group.

Donna

Demonstrating their new online shopping system Tienda on X date

Most of this stuff is basic content editing, a directory component of some sort[SOBI2, K2, etc] and then a little coding on the RSVP side which I could work on during my dead week at the end of the month.

Hmm..  Hearkening back to 2007, Laura, Anthony, Mitch, and yourself
regularly presented on topics.  I define a regular presenter as someone who
does at least 3 presentations in a years time.    To me, having a page
dedicated to those people lets those looking at the group over time see what
has been happening, and it's a bennie/thank you to the regular presentors as
it does add to your resume/cover letter to be able to say you present
regularly on Joomla at the NYC meetings. :-)

Not all presentations, I'm speaking here specifically of a general overview
of how to edit/maintain a basic Joomla website for new users/prospective new
users.

One thing I learned at the Dreamweavers meeting, I had a whole presentation
prepared on Joomla and I didn't get past editing content and menu's.  That
is an EXTREMELY powerful feature that I think many of us take for granted.
But new users don't really understand/realize the power.

It is also /boring/ for those of us who are already familiar with Joomla.
So it can be boiled down into a 15 mintue presentation to be done at the
beginning of the meeting only when we know there are people new to Joomla
coming[ie we have that one question on the RSVP asking if their new to
Joomla and encouraging them to RSVP so we can arrange it]

Those who volunteer to do it can have a rotation.  For them, it's a big
benefit because it means the presentor gets to talk directly at the meeting
to what are basically prospective clients.  The presentor gets to send them
an email a few days before the meeting reminding them that there is a
presentation geared specifically to them, and at the same time gets to
basically promote their own services with a brief bio of themselves.

The downside of doing these presentations is that it somewhat dillutes the
presentors reputation as more advanced users kind of associate them with
"beginning Joomla"... so it is a trade off professionally, but it does help
the group expand appeal and attract new people.

Now, this one idea does require a bit more in setup than the others - since
it requires some coding to setup the email communication functions and the
page to check on how many newbies are coming[which is also useful to others,
if you go and see that there are 5 new members coming, you know you can get
there 10-15 mintues later because there is a presentation you have no
interest in at the start of the meeting. :-)]

This is a nice idea that can quickly go badly. I think that if there
were prior requests put in, through the website, we might be able to do
a short demo. I think we might be able to briefly cover some tech
questions for newbies. I think that some problems can get very sticky,
though. I saw one last night, where the owner had a problem not with his
Joomla upload, but with his host properly directing traffic to his site.

I'm also aware the my efforts to help him were disruptive at the
meeting, and I apologize for that.

So perhaps we could have people announce their problems, followed bya a
10 or 15 minute breakout where others could help them along. We could
hold strictly to that 15 minute time limit. Those in a position to help
could approach those requesting the help. Others also interested in the
announced problem could come over to watch and learn.

For those interested in demos, perhaps we can direct them to helpful
resources on the web.

Perhaps you should try to sex up your demos then! ;)

We do get newbies. If we help them, perhaps some will stay. I've seen
others move on after they solved their problem.

I like that basic idea. I think it would be helpful to have a form for
that month with several common issues for newbies. We could address the
most common one for that month and provide a list of resources to
address the others, or if there is enough left over, address the next
issue the next month.

I like that idea! Then Marian will have to give all the demos! I never
would have thought of that! Good thinking, Gary. I hope Marian likes the
idea too!

Thanks Gary, I think you gave us some things to think about. How does
this fit in with our mission, or do we have a mission?

I understand those concerns. However, right now we are just guessing at
why newcomers show up, and what they want to learn at the meeting. Some
sort of information gathering regarding newcomer interest would help us
to give relevant demos. Presenting is still voluntary, and knowing there
was interest in certain basic subjects might encourage more of us to
step forward and present.

They usually mention that when we go around the room and introduce ourselves.  As people participate in the group, they can add to the discussion and decisions about what we do as a group.

I wouldn't want to see the JUG become a one-sided situation where people only come to pick others' brains for their specific needs.  There's one Meetup group who requires that attendees participate.  I wouldn't go that far because sometimes new people need to get a feel for what's going on before they feel comfortable.

As far as learning Joomla basics and finding out what Joomla is and does, that's what the InstallFest can provide.

I like that basic idea. I think it would be helpful to have a form for
that month with several common issues for newbies. We could address the
most common one for that month and provide a list of resources to
address the others, or if there is enough left over, address the next
issue the next month.

Somehow that sounds wrong!

Thanks Gary, I think you gave us some things to think about. How does
this fit in with our mission, or do we have a mission?

> As far as gathering info from the RSVP and developing a presentation or demo around the requests, I believe that would be a job in itself.  Are you volunteering for the job? ;-)   I believe that decisions about what presentations we are interested in should be done at the meeting by people who are participating in the meetings.  People volunteer their presentation, or volunteer to arrange for someone outside our group to come in and give a presentation, and we decide whether it is something we want at the meeting.
> 
> For people to email in and say I want to see this and learn that, and the rest of us jump and do it, I for one am not fond of that idea.  I think the group is based on mutual sharing, that people need to take the initiative to go on the Joomla.org site and other resource sites, and then follow up with discussions in the group.

I understand those concerns. However, right now we are just guessing at
why newcomers show up, and what they want to learn at the meeting. Some
sort of information gathering regarding newcomer interest would help us
to give relevant demos. Presenting is still voluntary, and knowing there
was interest in certain basic subjects might encourage more of us to
step forward and present.

There are some confusing things about Joomla that can be better relayed
in a demo, such as:

Sections and categories
uncategorized content
putting an article into a menu
The difference between list and blog layout
Finding the placements in a template
How to use the editor properly for text formatting
How to properly add a photo to an article
Uploading media
The images directory and that unfortunately named stories folder
The keywords parameter and how it's used for joomla search
Editing the html and css in the templates manager
Getting SEF working

(Some things on this list might also be good material for the
installfest.)

I don't know about that. I think we get more of a diy crowd at NYCJUG. I
think there are more prospects at the LIJUG, since Bruce has packed that
out with his clients. Nice work there! I've never before seen such
client interest!

I think this might be better done by NYCJUG itself. The presenter could
provide info for the mailing, but having an email from some unknown
might end up disregarded.

Can we set up, easily, a mailing system?

Ahh, what I meant, and this is the small bit of programming part I see and
could do, is that we can setup a simple newsletter system so whichever
presentor has guaranteed they will be there can send out the reminder email
through the system, so it comes from presentor at joomlanyc.org or something.

Well.. maybe I am projecting...  since when the group was first formed I
tended to use the first 15-20 minutes as people trickled in for an informal
demo of basic joomla features - but I always felt running those kind of
diminished my qualifications in others eyes as opposed to the more
fun/advanced presentations others would get to do.   Course I could have
completely misread things, my people skills are not the bestest. :-)

That's a long list of how-to's.  Personally, I wouldn't want the monthly JUG meetings turned into basic training sessions.  Steve of Alledia, who is sponsoring the refreshments for our meetings, offers classroom training, and I have the tutorial site, not to mention the hundreds of other resources out there, including our own InstallFest in January.

Hmm... as an offshoot to that, it might be a better idea then to send a
welcome email to new users and mention the beginner resources available.
ESPECIALLY prominently mentioning those who are sponsoring things for the
group!  And pointing out upcoming events like installfest

I don't think they are all that specific about their issues, or that
they know how to express them, or that they aren't intimidated into not
expressing them. I'm just suggesting that we provide an opportunity for
them to tell us what they are interested in or need help with.

Yes. But installfests happen infrequently. The last one planned turned
into JoomlaDay, which was hardly for beginners. 


Then again, maybe demos for beginners are just a bad idea.

I don't see it as a "them" and "us".  I think whoever participants in the JUG discusses what they want to get and give from the meetings.  I don't think there should be an "us" catering to a "them".

JoomlaDay was such an outstanding success, we are now doing the InstallFest and will probably be doing more events.

Yes. IF we do beginner demos, we should direct people to some of those
other sites, such as Alledia, our sponsor, and iteachme.com. Those are
both great resources and perhaps the newcomer hasn't found them yet.

Since Steve is sponsoring our refreshments, how about if we do one of his tips-and-tricks for 5 mins. at the beginning of each meeting as a teaser for his training.  He has a newsletter he sends out with these tips.

Just want to interrupt this otherwise wonderful painting of the bike shed to
point out my original suggestion was just to turn on SEF.

It's trivial to do, so can we just do this one thing, and then we can get
back to our rocket powered bike shed?

cheers,

Hi,
As a new user of Joomla the list Marc put together was dead on. These are
all the same things I've been working through and some of them I'm still
learning.
If I knew that I could pick up some pointers at the JUG meetings it would
have motivated me to take the trip into the city from NJ. I am planning on
getting to the meetings in any case but that would surely have got me out
the door. I know somebody can show me how to do something in a few minutes
that will take me an hour to read and research the web to figure out.
As for the meetings being just a beginners workshop, that doesn't sound so
good, but with the RSVP option being discussed and targeting what people
have questions about, a 10-15 minutes at the start of the meeting as
breakout mini-sessions sounds cool.

The same way you choose what extensions to use.  Look at what other people
in the group are using and pick those when they meet most of your goals
since that gives you a local resource to draw on for help.  :-)

Seriously though, that was the prime motivator for me in forming the group
years ago.  There were just so MANY good components out there, I wanted to
talk to people face to face if I needed help, so I wanted a group to
generate that collective knowledge base to draw on.

By the same token, as long as the help resources are good, I would always
refer to other locals before going out of the state/country.

Not that there aren't a ton of good solutions outside the region, but if I
have a choice I prefer to patronize locals.

Thanks.

I can use this but I wouldn't I have to modify the core if I add this function to Media Manager?  I would have to build out a component for admin users to upload images so I can restrict dimensions.

Someone is telling me another CMS they use has this built-in.

I seem to recall that there was a component for Joomla...  Product Gallery?
Product Something.  Joomla 1.0 component.

It used that function and Anthony discovered that function gives odd results
for certain images and non-image files[my hazy recollection is that it blows
up  the memory usage and tends to abort on most sites]


If possible, I find that using the Magick Wand image extensions works
better.

Okay, I snipped everything...

As a recurringly new user in a lot of things, I appreciate the chance to 
get the right basics from the pros. So maybe you have a 15 minute 
tutorial early on, or even start a little early so those coming in for 
the higher level stuff have some more wiggle room in the schedule. If 
the newbie wants to be there to learn the material, they'll make the 
time to show up early.

Of course, that means they get the best snacks too...

>> start a little early ... they'll make the time to show up early

So you want someone to come in early to teach the tutorial to people who may or may not show up early for it.

As I mentioned before, I propose:

(1) We begin each meeting with a tip from Steve's training newsletter (Steve is sponsoring the refreshments for the meetings);

(2) We hold InstallFests on a regular basis (every 2 or 3 months?) for a day of hands-on practice and help for people new to Joomla.  (We can take turns being the organizer for the event.)

Sorry, "Little Early" is only about 10 minutes. Since many social events 
take 10-15 minutes to get started, you could get a 15-20 minute tutorial 
session in.

Of course, if you're targeting a new user base there should be an 
awareness of whether or not new folks are showing up. However, if you're 
finding newbies hit and miss then yeah, doing the extra work might not 
be worthwhile, unless you're trying to build that segment of the community.

Sorry about that folks - 8 years and nothing like that - although oddly,
we've had two similar incidents in as many weeks... and going through mbox
files isn't too fun.  Mailman might be showing its age.

Anyway, oddly, the spam messages themselves never ended up in my inbox for
whatever reason.  If anyone catches more messages like this, please contact
me directly, as sometimes I might miss them.

Working on a small site, added a "Contact Us" page. Clicking the link 
goes to a page with all the information on it but the menu and module 
layouts are gone. For example, the left menu has a blue rounded edge on 
the front page but is just text on the "Contact Us" page.

2.  make sure apache mod_rewrite is set to yest

Message-ID: <883317.72797.qm@web31814.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

It is official...the user group of NYC is hosting it's first Installfest...it isn't just that though...we are having a forum and bugfest as well!!

Date: Monday, January 18
Time: 9-5
Place: Midtown, NYC - at Oracle

cost: $20 registration (includes bagels, lunch, flash drive)

Or, you can sponsor for: $50 (includes 1 ticket, can give out promotional gear, banner on website)

Go to our website: www.joomlanyc.org to register.

Note: All attendees must register, we have a limit of 50 people that can fit...so sign up now!!!  Chance are we will sell out!

Our Goal:
installees will be able to jump in (or dive) and install a joomla! system, as we say it won't be a 'training session', more of a doing session...we will have mentors on hand assisting people as well.  At the same time some more advanced joomla! users can get together and answer questions on the forums and squash bugs...

For newbies...this will be a great time for you to meet other joomla! users...for others this is a great time to give back and network as well!!!

thanks,
Laura

Hi Donna,
You may want to check out this extension. 
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/5694/details  I believe it will 
automatically resize any image before it is displayed in an article and 
create a copy of the original image in the specified size.

You may also like this extension: 
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/file-management/4813/details 
it automatically resizes any images in a directory, and can be used for 
front-endk uploading.

Good luck,
Jon

The editor did not mess it up, the problem is that the template path has
been hard coded to:
templates/rhuk_milkyway/css/ieonly.css

That means that the uri is relative to the base path.  With SEF turned off,
the url will be something like:
http://www.mydomain.com/index.php?somvar=x&othervar=y...

With SEF turned on, the url will be something like:
http://www.mydomain.com/index.php/somemadeupstring.html

in the first case, that makes the base href / and for the second ir was
/index.php/

Turning the urls into one that works and one that doesn't.

This is a problem we enountered when upgrading Joomla 1.0 templates to
Joomla 1.5, you have to insert the correct variable echo before the template
path in order to keep everything working.  Marian was working on writing
that guideline up at some point, did you ever get that finished Marian?  It
was half a dozen or so little tips/tricks we found..they are documented
elsewhere on the web, it was just we hit those specifically and had to
gather them from 2 or 3 sites.

Subject: [joomla] Editing articles in Chinese, Korean, etc.
Message-ID: <315897.9946.qm@web31503.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

We've used Joomfish before, but only for sites with Latin character sets. We're going to do a site with the home pages available in multiple languages, including Chinese, Korean, Turkish, etc. Are there any problems editing articles in those languages? The back end of the site will still be in English. Ideally, someone in the Asian division will be able to login and edit their own homepage in Chinese, without any assistance. 

Thanks,
Tamar

I've always installed JCE and turned off everything but bold and italic :-)

I have a bunch of divs and classes that need to remain in place in the article and the user should just edit the text within the divs, as well as add new sets of divs.  I don't want them to accidentally delete the tags or their attributes while editing.

I tried EasyTemplate, which looks like a good solution but the Insert button is dead in JCE.

Subject: [joomla] article template
Message-ID: <468396.16359.qm@web35607.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

FYI, I installed a JCE update and now the buttons on EasyTemplate works.

EasyTemplate looks like a nice plugin for inserting preformatted text.  It give you a little box to add your text and then it applies your formatting to it.

I have a bunch of divs and classes that need to remain in place in the article and the user should just edit the text within the divs, as well as add new sets of divs.  I don't want them to accidentally delete the tags or their attributes while editing.

I tried EasyTemplate, which looks like a good solution but the Insert button is dead in JCE.

I've always installed JCE and turned off everything but bold and italic :-)

How about linking the article to a menu item and giving the menu item it's
own unique template with all your formatting and the regular template stuff?

Since I posted to 2 places about this and mentioned our group, to be polite
I will point it out:

http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?f=381&p=1968788#p1968788
http://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers=&gid=52867&discussionID=10554178&goback=.anh_52867

Apparently there is some talk of paying Joomla core developers to encourage
getting releases done.

My personal opinion is that it won't help as things stand right now and just
lead to resentment.

As they stand now, the Joomla Core Team DOES work, on the core, which is the
part of Joomla that they use for their paying projects.

What doesn't get done are all the other components they don't use, Contacts,
Polls, Banners, etc.

Since I don't think one can match the fees they get for freelance projects
where they use the Core, what will end up happening is that they will get
paid to do the fun stuff they already do, the Core, and still the other
items won't get done since they will get more money using what they wrote in
their other paying projects.

What really needs to happen is to get other groups committing to
update/upgrade the other components.

Which is where I see the user group could come in, if we
sponsored/controlled one of those items we get extra exposure of our group
and our individual members services.  And our rep is on the line to make
sure the component is kept up to date, even though it is not a "sexy"
component to work on.

Get half a dozen to a dozen companys and groups to do that each with ONE
component, and then release cycles speed up.

THEN it is time to talk about paying core developers, because I think it
WOULD help.  But if they go the route of paying the core developers before
establishing a working structure for the rest, all that will lead to is the
core being updated slightly faster, but no one else seeing that it is
updated because without the other components very few people can actually
take the core and do something with it.

It would also mean that more people would have input and an idea of what new
features are coming up, since there would be a lot of small teams all over
actually working with them.

I don't think it will happen, because quite frankly it means Open Source
Matters has to give up some of the "control" they have over things - even
though they still have the final say on accepting an upgraded component or
not.  And people are always reluctant to give up control.

I just figured since I essentially "volunteered" us for this[even though it
was just an example and not a commitment] it would be polite to make sure I
pointed it out to the group. :-)

We've talked about this in the past numerous times. Remember how we
were going to work as a group to help migrate 1.0 extensions to 1.5?

True, but I think it needs buy in from the Joomla Core team.
The current structure is just too hard to break into, in my viewpoint.  But
if they opened up the components they don't really want to work on anyway
and invited sponsorship, I think it could be a good thing.

But again, it means giving up control.  And no one likes doing that.

Message-ID: <4bffc350912170852g63b99a69gbf33cc8915b0a7ac@mail.gmail.com>

BTW, anyone else think the contacts component is a misnomyer?


I think it would be better called "directory"..  that's what it really
shines for, maintaining an internal company directory which has contact us
forms and such built in.

People see "contacts" and think of it as some sort of user address book for
the end users, but it really is geared for an internal address book in my
viewpoint.

Hi all,
I ran across this on Digg and thought I would pass it along. 
Browser Size creates an overlay with data Google collected about the actual
viewable area in peoples browsers. This allows you to position critical
elements where they will be seen without forcing users to scroll the page.
Google Earth notes a 10% increase in downloads as the result of their using
this to reposition the download button.
The link to the Google Code blog where you can find out more on this tool
and see if it would be useful for you is
http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/12/introducing-google-browser-size.html


Cheers!

This issue, direct & official financial compensation to core contributors,
is the subject of passionate debate and was, in fact, the primary focus of
discussion during the Open Source Matters session at Joomla Day East 2009.

Interestingly enough, I didn't hear a lot of discussion about it at the
Joomla Developers Conference earlier this month. But then I was only able to
attend the 2nd day of that conference, so presumably it may have been
discussed earlier.

I am not going to take sides here except to say I hope the conversations can
focus on development methodologies that are specific to Joomla, and not veer
off into general recapitulations of ongoing notions of Open Source business
models. I won't bother to cite examples of other Open Source projects that
don't seem to have such a problem. This last statement is not intended as a
troll, but rather a source of optimism. ;-)

cheers,

Forest Mars

Digest means you're going to get an email summary at the end of the
day of all the discussions. It may be convenient for folks that don't
post much but just lurk; however means you'll always respond
after-the-fact as most folks get each message separately in real time.

Welcome aboard!

Forwarding this to the Joomla SIG, and have a strong recommendation
for Kainne - I've worked with him in the past and can vouch for him as
a very good guy. He believes in long-term relationships, and focuses
on making sure he connects the right people with the right employers.

Hi all:

I am looking for a light weight e-commerce package that allows for 
digital goods downloads (music, pdf, etc) and still handles regular buy 
and ship products as well.

Was looking at Virtuemart, and while it does everything I need..the 
learning curve for teaching a non-geek client is quite steep.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

From cozimek at picnet.net  Wed Dec 23 11:50:35 2009
From: cozimek at picnet.net (Ryan W. Ozimek)
Date: Wed, 23 Dec 2009 11:50:35 -0500
Subject: [joomla] JOB:  Project Manager at PICnet
Message-ID: <252BD442C63147A2A3E2192ABF8F9B64@RWOLenovo>

Hi Joomla friends,

Here's a little holiday job cheer for our Washington DC friends.  The PICnet
penguins are looking for another project manager.

Happy holidays everyone!

Best,
Ryan

---------------------------------

PICnet (www.picnet.net) is an energetic, innovative Web development firm
changing the face of the online non-profit world using open source software.
We're looking to add another stellar Project Manager to our team, delivering
the high-quality service our non-profit, association, and congressional
clients expect.

We're specifically looking for fun individuals from our non-profit sector
with experience in the Web development process (Joomla experience is a huge
plus).

Our Non-Profit Soapbox platform (www.nonprofitsoapbox.com) is a Joomla-based
content management system used by non-profits and socially responsible
businesses to easily manage their Web communications.  We're looking to keep
up with demand by adding the right project management talent to our team.


*** What you're in for ***

At PICnet, we provide a unique environment for non-profits to build their
online presence.  Our high-touch, high-quality service is what separates
from the crowd and keeps our client list expanding.

The individual who takes this position will have basic knowledge of the Web
development process and stellar communication skills.  Juggling multiple
projects at the same time is the name of the game, and working alongside Red
Bull craving developers brings to life the solutions our non-profits need.


*** What to bring to the table ***

Although the position does not require a Web programming background, a
strong understanding of the Joomla CMS is definitely helpful.  You should
have a bachelor's degree, great references, and excellent communication
skills.  Experience working at consulting shops is also a big plus.

After all the hard work, you'll need to be willing to have fun, play
putt-putt golf in the hallways, and laugh at least twice a workday. The
right applicant will not only have the basic tech qualifications, but will
truly enjoy working for the non-profit sector.

You've got to have heart.  You've got to be passionate about public service
and the social sector.


*** The not so fine print ***

* Position will be in-house, at our Dupont Circle location (no consultants
please), blocks away from our CEO's favorite burrito shop

* Salary commensurate with experience

* To apply, please send cover letter and resume to jobs at picnet.net,
attention Ryan Ozimek.  Include your salary history/requirements.

* In resume or cover letter, explain your past work experience in either the
non-profit or public service sectors. Also, please list any content
management experience you've had, particularly any you've had with Joomla.

Digest means you're going to get an email summary at the end of the
day of all the discussions. It may be convenient for folks that don't
post much but just lurk; however means you'll always respond
after-the-fact as most folks get each message separately in real time.

Welcome aboard!

Forwarding this to the Joomla SIG, and have a strong recommendation
for Kainne - I've worked with him in the past and can vouch for him as
a very good guy. He believes in long-term relationships, and focuses
on making sure he connects the right people with the right employers.

Hi all:

I am looking for a light weight e-commerce package that allows for 
digital goods downloads (music, pdf, etc) and still handles regular buy 
and ship products as well.

Was looking at Virtuemart, and while it does everything I need..the 
learning curve for teaching a non-geek client is quite steep.

Any suggestions?

Thanks
Paul

Subject: [joomla] JOB:  Project Manager at PICnet
Message-ID: <252BD442C63147A2A3E2192ABF8F9B64 at RWOLenovo>
Content-Type: text/plain;	charset="us-ascii"

Hi Joomla friends,

Here's a little holiday job cheer for our Washington DC friends.  The PICnet
penguins are looking for another project manager.

Happy holidays everyone!

Best,
Ryan

---------------------------------

PICnet (www.picnet.net) is an energetic, innovative Web development firm
changing the face of the online non-profit world using open source software.
We're looking to add another stellar Project Manager to our team, delivering
the high-quality service our non-profit, association, and congressional
clients expect.

We're specifically looking for fun individuals from our non-profit sector
with experience in the Web development process (Joomla experience is a huge
plus).

Our Non-Profit Soapbox platform (www.nonprofitsoapbox.com) is a Joomla-based
content management system used by non-profits and socially responsible
businesses to easily manage their Web communications.  We're looking to keep
up with demand by adding the right project management talent to our team.


*** What you're in for ***

At PICnet, we provide a unique environment for non-profits to build their
online presence.  Our high-touch, high-quality service is what separates
from the crowd and keeps our client list expanding.

The individual who takes this position will have basic knowledge of the Web
development process and stellar communication skills.  Juggling multiple
projects at the same time is the name of the game, and working alongside Red
Bull craving developers brings to life the solutions our non-profits need.


*** What to bring to the table ***

Although the position does not require a Web programming background, a
strong understanding of the Joomla CMS is definitely helpful.  You should
have a bachelor's degree, great references, and excellent communication
skills.  Experience working at consulting shops is also a big plus.

After all the hard work, you'll need to be willing to have fun, play
putt-putt golf in the hallways, and laugh at least twice a workday. The
right applicant will not only have the basic tech qualifications, but will
truly enjoy working for the non-profit sector.

You've got to have heart.  You've got to be passionate about public service
and the social sector.


*** The not so fine print ***

* Position will be in-house, at our Dupont Circle location (no consultants
please), blocks away from our CEO's favorite burrito shop

* Salary commensurate with experience

* To apply, please send cover letter and resume to jobs at picnet.net,
attention Ryan Ozimek.  Include your salary history/requirements.

* In resume or cover letter, explain your past work experience in either the
non-profit or public service sectors. Also, please list any content
management experience you've had, particularly any you've had with Joomla.

Subject: [joomla] Integrated Wiki?
Message-ID: <4B34F615.4040208@reuel.net>

Media Wiki looks great, but is there something 1.5 Joomla-ish that is a 
good basic Wiki? I'd like to have 3-8 users editing a dozen or two pages 
and that's about it.

One possibility is to just make them Editors for a few pages, but I'm 
not sure you can limit the pages an Editor can edit? The wiki will be a 
side component of the regular site and content is not related.

Thoughts?

While at KickApps I had a Joomla site setup as the main site, with
KickApps-hosted community features (blogs, forums, photos) and setup
two separate MediaWiki instances for API reference documentation. I
also used the joomla plugin for mediawiki, which worked just fine for
my purposes.

Something to consider.

Well, testing the waters has given little response in the user 
community. One person pointed out Google Wave might be useful, and as 
none of the target users have replied I'm not sure the effort of J! -> 
MediaWiki is right for this go round.

I think that's one of my learning curves, finding the needful market for 
all the great possibilities.
