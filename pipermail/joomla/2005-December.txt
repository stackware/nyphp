Subject: [joomla] Joomla (Mambo) Hack?
Message-ID: <b9540a4d9c963be4774e0ddfa4960f25@musgrave.org>


Hello -

I installed Mambo about a year ago for a client and the night before 
Thanksgiving, the home page was defaced (and plenty of other files were 
uploaded to the server but didn't overwrite Mambo files).

I'm wondering if it is a Mambo exploit or not - I thought the list 
would know.  And if not, if there is directory of exploits and their 
descriptions so that I may determine what happened.

The hack was done by "A n o m a l y   1 n   t h e   S y s t e m C r E 
W" (A1TS).  Heard of these guys?

The fact that their website has not been kept up to date tells me
there's no need to investigate how the site was compromised, as there
are too many known exploits for a system that hasn't been patched in a
year or more... 4.5.1a was replaced by many point releases that took
care of security holes, bugs, and performance issues.

I'd strongly suggest that you have your server checked for rootkits,
and make sure it is clean, and then upgrade your client's website to
either Mambo 4.5.3 or Joomla! 1.0.4.

Joomla! is really the continuation of the original Mambo development
team, who left the project to start Joomla! back in August. So the
1.0.x releases are basically what they were working on in Mambo-land,
circa 4.5.2.4. (Disclaimer, I'm one of the former Mambo devs who
started Joomla!)

More importantly, if there is a security fix published for the
software that powers their site, they need to upgrade. "Installing and
forgetting" may work for printers, but for websites you are playing
russian roulette.

How about working with one of the former Mambo core developers on a
Wine Cellar component? There are two things that I must point out
however:

1) I'm now a Joomla! developer (the whole Mambo team left in August to
form www.joomla.org) so I'm going to do my work in Joomla!, not mambo

2) I need your expertise on how to categorize French wines, as they
don't put the varietal on the label. This is keeping me from finishing
the database design, as all the other countries publish the varietal
so that is what I was using to identify each wine by "type"

I'd love to work with you on such a component, as long as we released
it to the community under an open source license.

The only thing I want out of you is help finding a decent grappa here
in NYC, as the only ones I can find are either taste like paint
thinner, taste like cough syrup, or cost $200/bottle. I mean, how in
the world am I to sit here and smoke all these great cigars, when I
cannot find a decent grappa?!?!

Grappa is a requirement especially when you are sitting behind a 
computer coding.

Fine for me to work on Joomla instead of Mambo.
For Grappa, a decent producer (good ratio quality/price) is Alexander 
Grappa, imported through Palm Bay Imports.
If you tell me were are you located I can give you the name of a store near 
by you were you can find this grappa.
For your project, i can give my contribution in terms of expetise : just let 
me know how to proceed.
Looking forward to hear from you soon.

Regards.
Alfonso.

Yeah, that was his big mistake, telling me about the grappa *before*
the coding started...

...from OINK-PUG (http://oink-pug.org/). I am busy switching our site
over to Joomla and wish to learn more about Joomla modules in
particular. For instructional purposes I have begun work on
"mod_contact_us"
(http://developer.joomla.org/sf/sfmain/do/viewProject/projects.mod_contact_us)
to gain insight to the module development process.

Currently, I'm looking into the best method to gain access to e-mail
features. I'm leaning toward the PEAR "Mail" package but I would like
to survey other e-mail aware Joomla modules (if they exist). Thus I
would appreciate hearing from anyone involved in the development of,
or who knows of the existance of any Joomla modules that make use of
e-mail.

Thanks for your time and for setting the bar so high! NYPHP rocks!

Regards,

Bill Barnett

Can anyone suggest Joomla! components and modules that facilitate youth
sports programs (or related efforts).  I'm planning to use akReservation for
online registration, and would like to have team listings, standings, photo
gallery, etc.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Hey BIll,

Joomla! 1.0.x makes use of PHPMailer, which most likely will do
whatever you need it to do. I'm generating the API reference
documentation right now, and will put it up on the Joomla! website
(somewhere) when it is done.

For an example, take a look at com_contact, as that is a class that
also calls PHPMailer to send an email message.

Hello Mitch,

Do you have a timeframe for the API documentation release so I can
update my release projections? Thanks for your prompt reply.

Bill

It is done, and Andrew is going to publish it somewhere on the help
website later tonight. I am sending a .tgz of it directly to your
mailbox (not wanting to hit the list).

Hey Mitch,

Not sure if this is relevant, but on the discussion of email interaction, is
there anything in the core that can be "turned on" so that when a page is
edited on your Joomla site, that an admin can get an email sent to them of
such notification?

I think that if there's already a function that changes the date on which a
content item was modified, there must be some sort of trigger there that can
be used to add an email notification as well.

Best,
Ryan

Good question. I'm eager to hear the reply. Furthermore, is there a
built-in e-mail facility in the core that can be utilized by other
components and modules or is each module responsible to supply their
own facility such as that in com_contact?

Yes, that is an oldie but a goodie ;-) From the backend, go to the
User Manager. You can toggle "Receive system emails" which used to do
just that.

Actually, on further testing I am not so certain, unless my ISP is
blocking outgoing SMTP traffic that is not authenticated on their SMTP
hosts... hehe

There will be a trigger event in a future version, but I don't
remember that we did that in the 1.0 series. We are adding more events
in the 1.1 series, and 1.2 of course will most likely have even more.

That is the life of Joomla!, first we add stuff, then we add more,
then we tune, then we pare everything back down again, then we add
stuff...

Well, com_contact is using the mosMail method calls, which are based
on PHPMailer.

The API documentation I just generated the other day... Does anybody
else here want it?  The BZ2 is only half a meg :-)

The two most popular are VirtueMart (which is a port of phpShop) and
josCommerce (which is a port of OSCommerce).

VirtueMart: www.virtuemart.com
josCommerce: www.joscommerce,com

You might want to check these two out.

Rochen Hosting supports the Joomla effort and has been wonderful for me

Rock on! Or, should I say Bluegrass on! hehe

Very good example of integrating different components and modules to

Hi every body, sorry if this message has not its place in this list.
I've got a problem with 'mamml' on the administration  interface.  I'm
trying to access
to the different menu of this  component but  when i cliick on the links
(like 'Newsletter management', 'registered subscribers', 'unregisterd
subsribers' etc ....) nothing happens, it's like i clicked to the previous
page.
Does somebody has an idea of what's happening?

Thanks to everybody

Tanoor.

BostonPHP has just published josCommerce v1.0.1 (an osCommerce port to
Joomla!) as a release candidate. This prospective release addresses several
bugs (see http://developer.joomla.org/sf/projects/joscommerce) and can be
seen at www.josCommerce.com . The code itself can be checked out (of
subversion) from the branches/1.0.1 repository.
