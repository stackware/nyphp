Hi, 








My synagogue on the Upper West Side is ready to hire someone to lead all technical aspects of project to convert the web site to Joomla.

We need someone who owns a suit/business clothes. -- Need to establish a comfort level with the semi-technical programs coordinator. She currently uses Drupal on the existing site.

The right person can outsource the site installation/configuration to somewhere or do it himself/herself. 
Person will manage all technical details including loading onto new web server, new ssl cert etc. 

Site will include:
* an off-the-shelf Joomla template (no new graphics design at this time)
* event registration, donations, event calendar, slide show, photo gallery. (Via Joomla extensions. You will propose which extensions to use, accomplish their initial installation, configuration, etc)

Also online learning section -- an area to download class files, audio, pdf, video etc. with categories, dates, keywords.

A good example site is www.lss.org

A key feature is a project manager who we can talk to.
We anticipate no custom software. But there will be extensions selection and configuration. You should have successfully installed events registration and payments extensions.
We already have the authorize.net account, merchant bank account, etc.

We're looking to create a long term relationship for future extensions to the site.

Send info including customer references to 
web at kluger.com
References from churches or synagogues would be nice but not required.This e-mail address is being protected from spam bots, you need JavaScript enabled to view it 

Thanks,

Larry

Message-ID: <773550.2895.qm@web35603.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi, all.  Hope you're having a great summer.

I'm wondering if spambots can/do harvest email addresses contained in pdf documents that are in Docman.

I have PDF Indexer running on a site, and I modified it to change the format of email addresses in the pdf conversion to text for the index, but I don't know if the spambot can get it directly from the pdf.

I've been doing some research but haven't found anything yet that indicates they do this.

Donna

YES!

Sorry, would have sent out a notice sooner, but was busy at LinuxWorld
in SFO and then GMail went to GPoo. Also looks like joomlanyc.org has
taken a walk to the Twilight Zone. Or at least the twilight. ;-)

The presenters/topics:

Anthony Ferrara
General update on the state of Joomla, LinuxWorld recap

Mitch Pirtle
General update on the state of JoomlaCities, LinuxWorld recap

The Time:

6:30PM

The location:

KickApps
29 W. 38th Street, 5th Floor
New York, NY 10018

I know it is late notice, but would love to have some folks make it so
we could get started working on some things as a group. I have some
really cool plans and hope to demo at the meet.

Wow if that was true then that is a total bummer! I don't think spam
bots convert and scan PDF documents, however with a little thought it
wouldn't be all that hard. I suppose the only thing keeping them from
doing it is a little effort - and if they think it is worth it, they
will do it.

If I were a spammer (which I am not), I would crawl google for pdf 
documents instead, because Google serves up the pdf's converted to html 
already. Donna,  you're efforts will not be wasted!

Sounds great!  I'll be there.

Also, I would like to fix our website.  If someone can give me access I will fix it up with an interim template until the group decides on a permanent template.

Hey Dan,

What you need to do is decide which subdomain will be the "one true
one" and tell apache to redirect the other to it. Some people for
whatever reason are totally hating on our venerable "www" subdomain,
so they set up the www.whatever.com to redirect to whatever.com. You
can do the opposite if you are emotionally attached to www.

Oh, and one more thing - google will punish you for posting the exact
same content at two different URLs. If you want decent traffic you
probably should stick with just one unique URL, and redirect the other
one.

Thanks, Mitch, but how do I change it to use "www" which I prefer?  
Also, how do I have Apache re-direct? Is it in the .htaccess file? By  
mistake I posted my problem this morning in the 1.5 forum and someone  
said to do this:

# Rule for duplicate content removal : domain.com vs wwwdomain.com

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.muchospanish\.com [NC]
RewriteRule (.*) http://muchospanish.com/$1 [R=301,L,NC]

Unfortunately, it doesn't work in the 1.0.x version.

Thanks again.

Hey Dan,

I put this in my apache config file:

# spacemonkeylabs.com --- redirect to www
<VirtualHost *>
	ServerName spacemonkeylabs.com
	Redirect / http://www.spacemonkeylabs.com/
</VirtualHost>

I use debian with no cpanel, and stock debian creates separate config
files for each domain (in /etc/apache2/sites-available). It is a great
practice, one I wish I saw more in the wild ;-) But I digress.

For your config file you add something similar to what I did above,
and that should tell apache to redirect all requests without the www
subdomain to the www subdomain. That is my personal preference, but
you can go either way.

Message-ID: <850191.30662.qm@web35608.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I noticed on one of my sites (J1.5) that's running the new VirtueMart, if you go to http://mydomain, it uses a different browse template that if you go to http://www.mydomain!

I tried setting the life site in the Joomla config file, but that doesn't stop someone from typing in the url w/o the www.

Dan,

I did this in /public_html/.htaccess:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{http_host} ^domain\.com [nc]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/$1 [R=permanent,nc,L]

and it worked in both J1.5 and J1.0 (I don't see how the Joomla version would make a difference).

Did you have "RewriteEngine on"?

In your .htaccess file, search for "RewriteEngine" and see if it says "on" or "off" next to it.  If it has a "#" in front of it, delete that.  So, if you see this:

# RewriteEngine on

change it to:

RewriteEngine on

Or if you see:

RewriteEngine off

Change it to 

RewriteEngine on


If you don't find it in the file at all, then just type it in:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{http_host} ^muchospanish\.com [nc]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.muchospanish.com/$1 [R=permanent,nc,L]

Hi, Donna, Mitch

I've tried both ways without luck.

Donna, I do have RewriteEngine On, but when I add your lines, neither  
loads, with or without "www"

Mitch, I put your lines in my configuration.php file, yes? But  
nothing loads...

I believe Mitch was speaking of the Apache config file, not the Joomla config file.  If you have shared hosting you won't have access to the Apache config file.

If you have shared hosting you can contact your webhost's support dept and ask them to help you with it.

Hi, Donna, Mitch

I've tried both ways without luck.

Donna, I do have RewriteEngine On, but when I add your lines, neither  
loads, with or without "www"

Mitch, I put your lines in my configuration.php file, yes? But  
nothing loads...

Okay, I called GoDaddy and they said it was their problem. They had  
to add a www file to my account. They said it will be a little while  
before it starts to work.

Thanks for all the help. Hope to see everyone at the next meeting.

Hi all,

I am developing a comment module. The frustrating thing is that I can't get the url parameters.

The url looks like this:
/php/62-php-reviews/185-memoir-of-passing-zce

How can I get the parameters like 'view=article', 'id=185', 'catid=62', etc?

Thank you very much for any help.

Waiting for reply.....

Best regards,

Subject: [joomla] strange thing on my site - no page comes up
Message-ID: <815463.3321.qm@web31808.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello all,

I hate to do this, but I am at a complete loss here.? As of yesterday my site was running fine, no problems at all.? But today, when you go to my site you get a blank page, something is wrong.

Site: http://www.childrensschoolofyoga.net
Joomla version: 1.0.15
php: 5.25
hosting: with godaddy (I know, not great, but that is where it is).

The administrator page works fine

I called godaddy, they thought there was something wrong with my index files, so I reinstalled them from my joomla versions of the files.? I also reinstalled my index.php from my template which is being used.

Looking at my ftp server, all of the files last modify date was 8/17 which was the last time that I loaded everything.? Some have 8/31, but those are the ones that I through up on the server today out of desperation.

The site itself is running extremely slow, maybe it is all linked together.

Any help would be appreciated!!!

Thanks,
Laura

That's odd because the same thing happened to me last week.  I had the site on Rochen and all of a sudden in the middle of working on it the front end went blank but the admin backend was fine.

I moved the site over to Hostgator where I have all my other sites, and it was fine so I cancelled my Rochen account because I just did not have time to debug it when it was working fine elsewhere (knock on wood).

Hi Laura,
Your site seems to be redirecting to the installation folder.
Check if configuration.php is still there and has the right permissions.
Good luck.
