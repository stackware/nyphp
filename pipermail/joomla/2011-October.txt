Subject: [joomla] Need help adding new footer module position in Joomla 1.7
 Gantry/RocketTheme template

Hi All,
Can anyone point me to where I can get some help to add a new module 
position under the current footer in a RocketTheme/Gantry template using 
Joomla1.7?
The current Gantry docs are all for J1.5 and things are different under 
J1.7.
I've added code to a number of the relevant files and I've managed to 
get the new position to show in the template manager>layouts and it 
shows in the backend when I attempt to add a module but it doesn't show 
up in the html :(
Thanks,
Herb Tucker

Hi Scott,
Yes, I used a copy of the relevant code that called the footer section 
and renamed tags, labels and classes footer1.
I found that I missed adding relevant code above that section. There was 
a PHP "if" that was generating a module count for the footer and 
copyright positions so I added an "or" for the footer1 position and now 
the module displays but I have another issue.
Modules that I add to the new footer1 are displayed in the footer1 AND 
the footer position. I've double and triple checked the code I added and 
I'm not seeing anything that looks like it needs to be changed but 
obviously there is something :|
Any ideas?
Files I've had to edit;
- index.php
- templateDetails.xml
- template-options.xml
- en-GB.tpl_rt_syndicate_j16.ini

Thanks and be well,
Herb

	Oct. 13th
Message-ID: <CABcNofP288v-LbHwZxUxn9JXOL5_-DTbpFANzjQCf12exGwx_w@mail.gmail.com>

Remember the monthly meeting is at 6:30 PM on Thursday, Oct. 13th at Lincoln
Center, 146 West 65th Street. See www.joomlanyc.org for more detailed
directions.

The theme for this month is Joomla 1.7. As we all know, Joomla is on an
upgrade path that will end in early 2012 with the release of Joomla 2.5.
During this period, components and modules are being upgraded and improved,
and new ones are being introduced. Joomla's back-end has gone through some
major changes.

We are going to share our experiences with Joomla 1.7. Please bring your
experiences and questions.

Even if you continue to use Joomla 1.5 and haven't a chance to test Joomla
1.7, please join us and get a taste of the future of Joomla.

We will also have the lightening round where you can question our team of
Joomla experts.

It is also the last monthly meeting before Joomla Day NYC, Oct. 22 and Oct.
23. It would be good if all the volunteers showed up to touch base with
J-Day organizers Laura Gordon and Scott Wolpow.

Hope to see everyone on Thursday night.

All best,

Steve

This is a second reminder to let you all know that the Joomla NYC meeting is
tomorrow at 6:30 PM at our usual spot, Lincoln Center at 146 West 65th
Street.

This month's theme is Joomla 1.7. Come and share your experiences.

I also want to remind everyone that the year is quickly coming to a close,
which means Joomla NYC board of director nominations. We will discuss this
briefly at the meeting. If you are interested in becoming a board member,
please attend the meeting or contact me.

We have not set the date for nominations and elections yet, but we are
interested in knowing who is interested.

Being on the board of Joomla NYC is a great opportunity to make new friends
and help promote this great open source CMS. I have had a great time serving
as president.

Hope to see everyone tomorrow.

All best,

Steve

 Joomla Twitter List
Message-ID: <CABcNofMimpv6rTF41GwG6Q2Qa0qkz9+q87JGs=PnySouZ85Hng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

I meant to announce the @joomlanyc Twitter account at the meeting on
Thursday, but got caught up with the Joomla 1.7 discussion so I will deliver
the story now:

I joined Twitter late, but now I can't imagine how I lived without it.

Twitter is the ultimate communication tool. Think email news on steriods!

Originally, I created my personal Twitter account in 2009, but didn't really
understand the power of Twitter until this past May when I got into a
conversation with a social media marketer at my local Starbucks.

After a five-minute overview, I am now a Twitter addict and follow 260+
accounts, ranging from @FinancialTimes, @NewYorker and @SherylCrow to
@KyleLedbetter and @JoomlaWorks. The first thing I do in the morning is
check my Twitter account. Then throughout the day, I monitor Twitter on
various computers and my Android phone.

I have found Twitter to be a great way to follow the Joomla community and
learn about the latest in updates, components, modules and templates. This
is my list - in no particular order - of "must follow" Joomla Twitter
accounts. Feel free to add to chime in and share your favorites.

@joomla
@JoomlaNYC (Joomla New York City users group - natch!)
@BrianTeeman (one of the founders of Joomla)
@JoomlaWorks (K2 and other products)
@sigsu_net (makers of Sobi2 and SobiPro directories)
@sobipro (directory extension)
@jen4web (trainer and author Jen Kramer)
@elinwaring (our local Joomla guru)
@jlleblanc (programmer Joe LeBlanc)
@k2joom (K2 theme developer)
@akeebabackup (popular backup program)
@betweenbrain (developer Matt Thomas)
@kyleledbetter (designer and developer behind AdminPraise and ProjectFork)
@yootheme (theme developer)
@joomlabamboo (theme developer)
@joomlapraise (theme developer)
@joomlatips (tips and tricks)
@rockettheme (theme developer)
@corywebb (trainer, author, developer)
@stackideas (extensions)
@virtuemart (e-commerce extension)
@alledia (trainer, author Steve Burge of JoomlaTraining.com)
@joomlablogger (news and blog)
@joomlashack (extensions, themes, training and author Barry North)
@andreweddie (master Joomla developer)
@kunena (forum component)
@jomsocial (social media component)
@joomlapolis (Community Builder extension)
@dioscouri (makers of Tienda and other fine products)
@osmatters (overseer of Joomla trademark and open source license)
@cozimek (Ryan Ozimek, president of Open Source Matters)
@rsjoomla (makers of RSForms, RSBlog, etc. extensions)

So do me a favor and join @joomlanyc . You will get plenty of news and
meeting reminders, although we will continue to use the Joomla NYC mailing
list too.

Have a great weekend! And I look forward to seeing everyone at Joomla Day
NYC Weekend next week.

Hi Steve,

Thanks for posting about Twitter and I too joined it late. Please let's not
forget about Facebook
http://www.facebook.com/pages/NYC-Joomla-Users-Group/132691140128290 We set
up a page and I would like to encourage members to use it. These days I
rarely visit a site other than what I find posted on feeds from Twitter and
Facebook. We are using this extensively at the UN for communications. I find
it a perfect solution to remind people to attend events and meetings. I
follow many developers on Facebook and Twitter and keep up to date with
feeds from my phone. I hope NYC Jug will make better use out of social media
moving forward.

thanks - Bill

in the past and it is still working well on an old site. Don't know how
sophisticated you want - this is very simple.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla Day NYC 2011 and November monthly meeting
Message-ID: <CABcNofMk8YgDk1ZVYG0t0DsZMThhxXmk5Jj3Ng6o832z1tLVFw@mail.gmail.com>

As you may have already heard, Joomla Day NYC was a HUGE SUCCESS!

There were so many happy people and the three days went too quickly. It was
impressive that many people traveled so far to attend. There were attendees
from Seattle, L.A., Portland, Austin, Brazil, England, France, Australia,
Winnipeg, etc.  It was neat to hear the various British accents and people
speaking in Portuguese, German and French, which made it a true
international event.

I also want to thank our friends at Microsoft for letting us use their
offices and for sponsoring the Saturday evening party at House of Brews.

It was also great to meet the people behind the extensions - JFBConnect,
JEvents, SimpleCaddy, etc. and compare notes with Joomla "Rock Stars," like
Kyle Ledbetter of Admin Praise, and Matt Thomas of the Construct Framework.
I heard many people say nice things, including how they want to come back to
New York next year.

Many, many thanks to Laura and Scott.

Also thanks to:

Marian
Toni
Donna
Bill
Ryan
Fred
Sherene
Sebastian
And all the others who helped make this event a success.

I also want to invite those interested in joining the board of directors of
Joomla NYC to attend the next board meeting on Thursday Nov. 11. As we have
previously announced, all those who want to become board members - and
current board members - have to read a one paragraph statement on why they
want to be on the board.

It you cannot attend the November meeting, please ask a friend to read your
paragraph or you can email it to me and I will read it for you.

Being on the board of Joomla NYC requires dedication and the willingness to
volunteer and help others. It is often a thankless job and involves
providing professional quality work without pay. You may have to lug cases
of bottled water, clean conference rooms after meetings,
and occasionally hear unwarranted criticism from crazy people.

On the positive side, being on the board can be very rewarding. You make new
friends, get possible job referrals, and have another item to add to your
resume/website that says you are contributing the community. My favorite
reward is the feeling that comes from helping people, solving problems, and
improving the lives of others.

We also expect board members to do the following:

* Attend the monthly NY JUG meetings. The meeting is the second Thursday of
the month. We are well aware that some folks have job commitments or have to
take off summer months. But it would be great if board members could attend
at least five to six monthly meetings per year to be aware of what is going
on.

* Volunteer to help plan and work at the two annual events - Joomla Day NYC
Weekend and JoomlaCamp NYC. We need to start planning both events for 2012
ASAP.

* Take part in occasional board meetings. These are usually conference
calls, but sometimes we hold in-person meetings.

* Contribute your knowledge and help others. You should know Joomla well
enough to provide basic support. It is also a big plus if you have other
technical, business knowledge and life experiences that you can share.

* Chair at least one meeting per year. This involves getting one or more
speakers to present at the monthly meeting. You can present and/or find
others to present. The presentation can be anything Joomla related, from
demonstrating a module or componenet to showing how to modify a form or
template and discuss Joomla's many features.

Also remember that you do not have to be a board member to volunteer. We
could not put on these events and monthly meetings if it was not for so many
devoted Joomlers who participate in Joomla NYC.

I look forward to seeing everyone at the November meeting and to start
planning Joomla Day NYC Weekend 2012.

All best,

Steve

Hi all,

Just a quick update, we have posted pictures (thanks Duke Speer for the
great photography work!) on our joomladaynyc.com website.  Go to our
Facebook page,
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Joomla-Day-New-York-City/133644853352910 and
see if you can find pictures of yourself!

Also, many of the presentations have been posted as well, so visit
www.joomladaynyc.com to see it!

Lastly, the video streaming are still on all of the 'channels', the links
are on the front page of the website, we are in the process of 'parsing'
everything out, and dividing up each video by class, hopefully this will be
done by the end of the week.

And one more thank you to everyone for helping out with this event.

thanks,
Laura

WOW!

Fred Sullivan and his friend, Ricardo did an AMAZING job filming some of the
sessions at Joomla Day NYC Weekend last weekend. If you did not have a
chance to attend, this is your opportunity to check it out. And if you did
go, you can hear it again. :-)

Subject: [joomla] If you can read only one blog post today read this one
Message-ID: <CABcNofMXw4WF1Eky0FBqjb3r6LBE63kuT+LVKOsdaternTbHmg@mail.gmail.com>

My apologies for clogging your inbox today - I know this is the third
message - but I just read an excellent blog post by Jen Kramer and it's
worth sharing.

The post is about how some developers will take on any job regardless of
their experience, promise the client the world and yet, have no idea what
they are doing. As a result, the client often suffers and in many cases
incorrectly blames the CMS when they should blame the developer. I have
found this to be true with not only Joomla, but with WordPress and Drupal as
well.

The best way to handle a situation like this, where a potential client wants
a site that is beyond your ability, is to contact your fellow members at
Joomla NYC. Don't try to do it all and above all, be honest with the client.
Never promise what you cannot do.

Just uploaded our new and improved Stay Open Plugin to the Joomla extensions
directory:
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/administration/admin-interface/8690
 .

Originally written by Gary Mort to work on the front end, Joseph Bui has now
extended it to work on the back end as well. Joomla versions 1.5, 1.6, and
1.7 are supported.

If you are like me and wander around while working on sites, or are
frequently interrupted, you can use this plugin to keep your logged in
session alive until you close your browser, while keeping your session
lifetime short in global configuration. You can configure Stay Open to work
on the front end, back end, or both.

Instructions on the website and on the JED.

If you find it useful, please write a review in the JED. If you have an
issue, please contact me at
http://gothamwebsites.com/contact-us/gotham-websites.html

Enjoy!

That sounds great, because sometimes there's a form that the user has to fill in and it may take awhile if there's a lot of data.? If user submits data and their session has timed out, they would have to re-enter everything.? I assume this plugin would solve that problem by keeping user's session alive for as long as they needed to complete the form and submit?

Subject: [joomla] System Administration for Joomla! Based Websites
Message-ID: <1320008953.84983.YahooMailClassic@web161405.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

A question for those who are developers/designers and who maintain client sites and provide hosting:

I have the option of taking on a group of Joomla! sites that have maintenance contracts. For a monthly fee, the expectation is that updates will be applied to the core and installed extensions, client questions will be answered, and that the sites will be hosted in a best practices manner including applicable security measures, whether that's on a VPS or in a shared hosting environment.  

My question is - what are your solutions for systems administration? If you build Joomla sites as a designer or developer, how do you manage 
system administration for your long term support? Do you do it yourself, hire someone with a system administration background? If you hire someone for sys admin, have you ever done that through Elance, Odesk, etc.? I wouldn't need a full time person.

My main concerns are moving the sites over from where they are to a new environment, creating an easy way to create a cloned dev environment for 
each site that can easily be pushed live (for testing extension and 
core upgrades), possibly creating an extension upgrade process that 
will work on multiple sites at once (one click upgrades JCE, for 
example, on 6 sites), and an initial security audit and ongoing 
security maintenance. 

I use akeeba backup and can backup and recreate sites, but I am looking 
for a better/more automated way to manage dev environments. 

Thanks
