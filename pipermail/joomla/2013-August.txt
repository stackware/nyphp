Hello everyone!

 

When I do a Google search for my website it appears in the browser address
bar as: http://unitel.biz/  is it better if it appeared as www.unitel.biz
<http://www.unitel.biz/> ?

 

Is there a difference between them? 

 

 

Best regards,

Subject: [joomla] Commenting Extension
Message-ID: <723CE2EBCF9D4739BD65FF7242527065@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone!

 

On the online version of the New York Times newspaper after reading an
article you can write a comment. In order to do so you must create an
account. What would be the equivalent in a Joomla extension? Would it be a
blog, a forum, or comments such as Disqus comments?

 

 

Best regards,

I am not a big fan of Disqus. It's probably the easiest way to add comments
to a website, but the comments are hosted on the Disqcus site, making it
lousy for SEO and the free version puts ads in the comments and looks ugly.

If you want to give visitors the opportunity to post comments on stories,
like the New York Times, you need a comments extension.

My favorite comment extensions are:

Komento - works in J 2.5 and 3.1. It's free, but there is a link back to
the Stack Ideas website, still not bad.
http://extensions.joomla.org/search?q=komento

JComments - works great in J 2.5. Eagerly awaiting the version for 3.1.
Free. On my short list of best Joomla extensions.
http://bit.ly/NGJ4un

RSComments - works in 2.5 and 3.1. From the wonderful folks at RS Joomla,
makers of RS Forms. Paid, but cheap - 19 euros (about $25+).

Blogs are for folks who like to write and want others to comment on what
they have written. In the case of Joomla, all blogging extensions include a
comment system and most add modules for categories, recent articles, tags,
etc.

There a many good blog extensions available for Joomla - K2 is free and
very popular, RS Blog, Easy Blog, etc.

The problem that I find with using these blogs is they add an extra
articles layer. I would rather stick with the native Joomla 3.1 framework -
which already comes with modules for latest articles, categories, most read
articles, tags, etc. and add a good third-part extension like Komento or RS
Comments.

Although I know a lot of folks who love using Easy Blog and K2 for
blogging. Try both methods and use the one you like best.

Hope this helps. Have a great weekend.

Thank you Stephen - I looked at JComments and agree. Hopefully Joomla! 3 ver
will not take long in coming.

Subject: [joomla] Spanish Language pack
Message-ID: <67B821218A4A4A65A7BF16AAC221B54C@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone!!

 

I installed the Joomla! Language pack;

 

1) Language Manager--> Installed Site --> Default =Spanish (ES). - OK

2) Administration --> installed -->Default = (ES) - OK

3) Content --> Install Language -->Options windows shows  a lot languages
but not (ES) Spanish as a language pack.

Why?

 

Joomla!;

 

Article: Public Options-->Created by alias--> I entered a name here that
requires an accent, Joomla! Displays the name without the accent.

Why? 

 

 

 

JCE.

 

I downloaded the jce (ES) language pack it seems to be working ok.

 

BUT!! 

 

Some of the words in article text show the accent some don't.

 

It seems like there is no option in jce to add the accents manually - is
there?

 

Any help will be greatly appreciated!!

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Multi-language sites are tricky.

In Joomla (and other CMS's), you are basically setting up a separate page
for each language. It can get complicated - too complicated to explain in
an email.

OS Training and Lynda.com have excellent video tutorials how to set up
multi-language Joomla websites. Both offer free 7-day or 30-day free
trials. If you are on a budget you can sign up, watch the videos and then
cancel :-)

OSTraining.com has been a huge supporter of Joomla NYC and I would go there
first.

Stephen thankx for the reply.

 

But I'm not trying to set up a "Multi-Language" site. I am setting up a 100%
Spanish language site. I n other words (just to make sure my message is
clear) my site will not have an option to switch to back and forth from
Spanish to English - 100% Spanish only.

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

As for special characters in languages - do the fonts in your template
support special characters?

Most of the fonts that you find on sites like Google Web Fonts, only
support the English language.

To test, try using Times New Roman - which comes with a complete set of
language fonts - as the basic body font in your template.

Hello Everyone!

 

When I type unitel.biz in the Google search bar I am getting erroneous
results from Google serp. It shows pages that don't exist, pages without
menus, and pages with "Article" in upper left. All in all there are only
three pages which are correct.

 

Can someone give me a clue of what's going on?

Below is SERP from Google.

 

1.	-Unitel.biz - unitel.biz -

I'm still out of commission; maybe next month. You're probably a CB jock by
now. How is it going? Have you presented to the SIG yet?

Subject: [joomla] New Joomla! 3 Video Course
Message-ID: <1377282882.25898.YahooMailNeo@web164906.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

The video course I authored for Packt Publishing, with the help of several NYCJUG members, has just been published.

Learning Joomla! 3 Extension Development:? https://www.packtpub.com/learning-joomla-3-extension-development/video

This 32-video course is currently on sale for the unbelievable price of $16!? 

I say this price is unbelievable due to the extremely valuable information contained in this course that is difficult to find elsewhere.? This course will teach you how to build your own custom Joomla! 3 component, plugin, module and template.

The lessons are presented in a very logical way, along with working files for each video.? If you have a working knowledge of PHP, MySQL and the Joomla! 3 Admin, then you can easily learn extension development from this video course.

Many thanks to our NYCJUG members who assisted with the production of this video course!? A lot of blood, sweat and tears went into the production of these 32 videos:

Gary Mort helped with research of the new Joomla API; Marian Konop and Stephen Britton reviewed the course before publication; and Mark Simko was instrumental in arranging for me to author the project.

Subject: [joomla] Adding "Prepare Content" option to a Module?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv8g45B+mkedWDaQPyVFDYnBRveieD5zESJWjKAz32sutw@mail.gmail.com>

You might be familiar with using the "Prepare Content" option in Joomla to
allow an embedded plug-in to function in Custom HTML such as "{foobaz ...}.
But there are some third-party modules that don't have the "Prepare
Content" option. "I know!" said in a Craig Ferguson voice. :-)

So I'm thinking of adding this option to those Modules lacking "Prepare
Content" unless someone can offer other solutions or simply talk me out of
doing this. I'm thinking the code found in mod_custom.php would accomplish
this?

*if ($params->def('prepare_content', 1))*
*{*
* JPluginHelper::importPlugin('content');*
* $module->content = JHtml::_('content.prepare', $module->content, '',
'mod_custom.content');*
*}*

What do you think of doing this to solve this problem? From my
understanding of this, it needs to be done at the Module level so it treats
the content as if it were a Joomla Article.

Thanks in advance!

David Roth

Message-ID: <CAJ4JCSROEqVqpxTx8qKvmt47G-TCNGuRvuerLbJG-EViMCsdyw@mail.gmail.com>

As a course reviewer, I can say Donna is incredibly thorough. She gives
step by step instructions to develop a complete component and she uses a
real world example. Extension development is complicated and Donna walks
you through it in a very logical fashion. I haven't seen information this
complete anywhere else.

I would recommend it highly if you are interested in developing your own
Joomla extensions, and I think if you put in the time to understand these
videos you will come out with a good "cookbook" (pun intended) for
understanding the structure of Joomla components even if you don't want to
develop one yourself.

As Donna points out, a working knowledge of PHP, MySQL and the Joomla! 3
Admin is helpful.
