On joomla.org they mention about the joomla user groups...we aren't there!? I think we should be, and we should look around at the other joomla user group sites to see what we like and don't like and use it to brainstorm for our goals at the next user group meeting.

I am guessing anyone can register us, but maybe we should wait until the website is complete...which could get us moving a little faster...Marion, any sample templates that you can suggest, and we will pick one to run with?

Well, last time I went in to register, they wanted some information that I didn't know (organsizational structure stuff)...  So I say, next thursday when we get together, I'll bring the application stuff so we can get it done...

I agree that we shouldn't publicize the group until the new web
presence is done. There's no July meeting - as decided at the last
meeting - which is good as I'm taking a short vacation before starting
my new job as VP Developer Relations at KickApps   :-)

I can't very well offer the office until after I start, and if you
guys want me to attend a meet on my week at home, well, you gotta talk
to my family. And good luck on that. *grin*

No, we decided there would be no July meeting. If some of us want to get
together to work on the site, espeically the templating, that would be
great.

Maybe some of us can even do something on WorkingWithJoomla before August!

Well then let's just put it on there! It's not like that's particularly hard
to do in Joomla! right?    :-)

You know what I think, any decent template that isn't broken beats a broken
one, no matter how nice it *could* be.

Is there something stopping the group from just dropping it in there now or
before the next get-together? (whether that's the August meeting, or before
then.)

*Then* I'd suggest putting in a style switcher on the front page, which I
think the Joomla NYC group should definitely have!

Subject: [joomla] nyc user group - not on joomla?
In-Reply-To: <c2f754300807020930n3aa226a6gcb58fb0defe7b6bb@mail.gmail.com>

I agree that we should wait until we have a site, so we can represent ourselves well.
?
For the August 14 meeting, what if we each come to the meeting with pieces so we can complete the website...
?
1. We need to know who owns the domain name / hosting to make sure it is renewed properly, etc.
?
2. Bring a list of suggested templates (or just email them around and we can just vote on the top 3.
?
3. Bring ideas of sample content, what do we do.
?
See you on 8/14
?

No, we decided there would be no July meeting. If some of us want to get together to work on the site, espeically the templating, that would be great. 

Maybe some of us can even do something on WorkingWithJoomla before August! (nudege, nudge)

I can't very well offer the office until after I start, and if you
guys want me to attend a meet on my week at home, well, you gotta talk
to my family. And good luck on that. *grin*

Hi all,

If hosting is needed, I can easily provide, free of charge obviously.  Let
me know what's needed.

I've got it hosted on my server for now... I have nothing against moving it (my server isn't really setup to host sites which I don't manage)...  Thanks for the offer!  We'll talk around about it...

Anthony,

Did you say at one meeting that a template can be made for entering content into an article?

That would be nice!  Especially if there was a tool that would allow
for webmasters to customize templates for different types of content
on a site.  :)

Does anyone know if there is going to be a JoomlaDay East this year??

I found an editor that does that -- JCK.  You can create 3 different templates.

Yootheme has gotten really, really good this year.  I think I might even like them better than Rockettheme now.

Shape5 has some interesting templates lately.

templateplazza.com has templates built around 3rd party extensions.

I like Joomlart templates. Joomlart offers a subscription so you can 
download several and try them. The templates usually come with Photoshop 
files to modify the default graphics, and custom CSS classes for 
formatting body text. I have also used Joomlashack templates. They are 
very well done, however, I believe you have to pay for each one 
separately - even a color variation on a single template.

I took a chance with JoomlaJunkie and am pretty happy. They were a bit
slow to adopt 1.5, but now they are absolutely competitive in every
way.

Hi there--

I am seeking an expert consult on a site we recently launched into  
private beta. It can be accessed at abc123.sewnews.com.

We need some advice with issues related to session, cache, and  
database management. We're having pretty consistent problems with  
things like the Joomla admin logging people out inappropriately.

Is anyone available to take a look under the hood and offer some  
consultation?

I'm looking for examples of real web sites using Virtuemart. I've seen
the demos, but would like to visit a web site using it for real.

I'd also be interested in comments from anyone who has first hand
experience using Virtuemart. Do you like it?

Is Virtuemart the best to use for Joomla or are there other shopping
cart alternatives that should be considered? Thanks!

On wcwonline.org, we sell publications (downloadable PDFs, DVDs, CDs)
using virtuemart with a lot of customization.  I like that Virtuemart
comes with a lot of features - coupons, etc. It was some work to get it
going.

Subject: [joomla] Ready to hire: Joomla installation/configuration
Message-ID: <194548.88713.qm@web30805.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi, 


My synagogue on the Upper West Side is ready to hire
someone to lead all technical aspects of project to convert the web
site to Joomla.

We need someone who owns a suit/business
clothes. -- Need to establish a comfort level with the semi-technical
programs coordinator. She currently uses Drupal on the existing site.

The right person can outsource the site installation/configuration to somewhere or do it himself/herself. 
Person will manage all technical details including loading onto new web server, new ssl cert etc. 

Site will include:
* an off-the-shelf Joomla template (no new graphics design at this time)
*
event registration, donations, event calendar, slide show, photo
gallery. (Via Joomla extensions. You will propose which extensions to
use, accomplish their initial installation, configuration, etc)

Also online learning section -- an area to download class files, audio, pdf, video etc. with categories, dates, keywords.

A good example site is www.lss.org

A key feature is a project manager who we can talk to.
We anticipate no custom software. But there will be extensions selection and configuration. You should have successfully installed events registration and payments extensions.
We already have the authorize.net account, merchant bank account, etc.

We're looking to create a long term relationship for future extensions to the site.

Send info including customer references to 
web at kluger.com
References from churches or synagogues would be nice but not required.This e-mail address is being protected from spam bots, you need JavaScript enabled to view it 

Thanks,

Larry
