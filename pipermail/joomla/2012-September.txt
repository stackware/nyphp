Subject: [joomla] question about redirect - remediating hacked Joomla website
Message-ID: <4351643.2126991.1346788860941.JavaMail.root@vms170031>

I've fixed up a Joomla 1.5 based web site that was hacked to redirect to a malware site.

I was not able to find any of the Joomla files changed, nor did I find any changes in the database.

What I did find is that the .htaccess file was changed. In addition, several other .htaccess files were added in several subdirectories of the site.
Also found several php files in the tmp directory with the redirect url encoded with a preg_replace function. The evaluation string had another string encased in single quotes inserted to it.

I was able to ftp the whole site preserving the time stamps on the files. I removed all the .htaccess files and replaced the original one with an unadulterated one.

that set most of the site back to normal. I have one persistent problem.

I have looked through the database using string search, and I have replaced all the joomla core with newest version.

And I've looked for index.html files that might be adulterated, but haven't found any.

The problem ... (finally!)

When I direct a browser to:

http://affectedsite.com/adminstrator/index.php

I can get to the administrator console.

I cannot get to the admin console with

http://affectedsite.com/administrator

for that I get an error message in the browser window

Illegal variable _files or _env or _get or _post or _cookie or _server or _session or globals passed to script.

and the address in the browser is

http://affectedsite.com/kunend/homepages/4/changed/htdocs/administrator/htttp://reltime2012(dont try it)ru/frunleh?9

Note the second malformed url inserted at the end! 

======

Does anyone know where I can look to find where this is coming from. I thought perhaps a plugin, but I haven't been able to find anything. I also checked for an index.html file, but none is there.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark.

I'm so sorry to hear about someone doing this to your website.

I think you have done a noble job of damage control on this. You mentioned
it was on Joomla 1.5. If possible, I would create a new installation of
Joomla with 2.5 and do a migration if feasible. The concern to go to Joomla
2.5 is because of security. I don't know how your website was hacked, but
there have been security updates since 1.5.

You mentioned the .htaccess, the problem could be a re-write issue. Also,
check to see if the SEO stuff is on or off. I don't recall how 1.5 did this
or if you needed an extension to do it.

Each time I have found that hack it was on a shared hosting platform.
Though Blue Host and their sister companies have stepped up security on 
this.

Scott, that's an interesting comment. Do you think on a shared hosting
account it's being hacked because of the permissions on the .htaccess or
possibly other files? Thanks!

Shared Platforms are always at risk because of security.
In order to allow the user to upload via a webpage, the site has to be 
part of the Apache group.
Read this

http://blog.stuartherbert.com/php/2007/11/21/the-challenge-with-securing-shared-hosting/
To really overcome this requires one of these:
1) Customizing Apache
2) Having very high server overhead
3) Kernel modification

I'm looking for an extension to create and manage the sitemap.xml file

non-commercial one called Xmap. Anyone have experience with either one

Xmap is great and I have often used it, but a well built site should not  
need a site map for seo, only to assist users

Subject: [joomla] RSSeo vs Xmap?

I'm looking for an extension to create and manage the sitemap.xml file
for SEO purposes. The two I'm looking at are RSJoomla's RsSeo! and a
non-commercial one called Xmap. Anyone have experience with either one
of these and any recommendations? Thanks!

Thanks for the reply and recommendation.

It's my understanding that a sitemap.xml file is used by search
engines such as Google. If you are referring to a sitemap in general
for the visitor to the website I agree with you.

I was making a general statement, but xmap does both.

Message-ID: <CALfVZ39wR9pOZn0cng+TK5Jm3p7m5_oX78Pvrq2x-E3Urqb39g@mail.gmail.com>

I have a strange situation I am hoping someone can help. I have a situation
where I want to give viewing access to a certain section/pages only to a
particular group of viewers. I want the public to see the navigation to
those pages, but not have access to them unless they have requested
permission, in which case they will be added as a user in that group.So
when they do navigate to the page, there is a system message "You are not
authorized..." That is how it should be.

The problem is that in Firefox and IE, if the user logs in, navigates to
the restricted page and then logs out,  they can't navigate back to the
restricted page again while logged out.The log in module is set to redirect
on log out to the default page, which is the Home page, which it does on
log out. But if you click on the menu item to navigate to the restricted
page again, instead of seeing the page with the system message "You are not
authorized...", it defaults to the Home page.This is confusing to the user
since they were able to navigate there before. If they happened to be on a
different page (not the restricted one) when they logged out, they will
have no problem navigating back to the restricted page and seeing the
system message "You are not authorized...".

In Chrome and Safari, I don't have the problem. If I clear the cache, it's
fine, too, but I can't expect visitors to know to clear their browser cache.

I am experiencing this on 2 different sites, both 2.5.6. One site also has
K2, so I tried using it's login module instead of Joomla core, but it made
no difference. I also tried using BTLogin module, and again, no difference.
Anyone have any insight?

Hello Ellen,

I suggest you create TWO sets of the SAME menu. One to be displayed when
the user is logged out and the other when logged in.

The logged out version of the menu would have all its menu itens pointing
to a single article telling the use they cannot see that content until they
login, plus offering the possibility to register in a more user friendly
environment. I feel the current proccess is not much user-friendly. Or you
can have a separate article for each menu item with similar content, still
pointing to the option of logging in.

The logged in version of the menu would have the actual menu itens.

Hope this helps.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <D5FD2A44-637F-4C07-9E2A-55B2C9544E38@whyknott.com>

Hello Everyone,

For some reason I cannot figure out how to get the Default Joomla 2.5.6 Banner Component to show only one banner on the page at a time and randomly on refresh load a new one. Can the default Joomla Banner Component only show multiple banners from a category or all categories? I really need to display only one banner at a time and randomly load another on refresh or reload of the page unless I use the sticky feature to show a paying customer's banner more often. However, right now the client wants all banners from a cat to load new on refresh or reload.

Any help with this would be appreciated,

Thanks,
Kenny

Subject: [joomla] Software Freedom Day - this Saturday at ITP (Interactive
 Telecommunications Program)
Message-ID: <CA+q4bwOWaVJJz6NekbPECmCvC-VmS+srKzVMbwLxukMKTsJ5+Q@mail.gmail.com>

*The 5th annual Software Freedom Day NYC will take place on Saturday
September 15, 2012 from 6:30-10:00 pm.

The New York celebratory event will be held this year at ITP, NYU's school
for the Interactive Telecommunications Program, located at 721 Broadway
(between 8th Street & Washington Place.)

As in previous years this will be a celebration of the merits and successes
of free software, with food & drinks ("free as in beer!") and a short
program of speakers. This is also a "hack friendly" event; we will have 2
large breakout rooms so bring your laptop to demonstrate a project you're
working on or engage in informal collaboration.

At 8:00 pm there will be a short program including presentations.
 Scheduled speakers include:


   - James Vasile of the Software Freedom Law Center on "Free Software vs
   Censorship and Surveillance"
   - "Wikipedia Takes Manhattan? -- presented by Wikimedia NYC (following
   up on this afternoon?s photo-walk departing Bowling Green at 3pm, and
   arriving at ITP at 7pm)
   - Jon Stanley on the Fedora project

The list is already with security. You may have been added as someone who attended a prior meeting, but I don't have access to the list now, and can't check it for you. You can always take a chance.

I just wanted to say hello / thank you for a warm introduction to the NYC
Joomla User's Group last night - as was mentioned by one of the veterans,
it's nice to actually sit down and MEET people in person some times, and
not just on a forum / list / Skype / etc.

Thank you again, and I will see many (if not all) of you at Joomla Day NYC
next weekend!

Did you edit the robots.txt file? Joomla's default robots file restricts
access to several directories, including components and templates.

      Hi Guys,
 
 Something I noticed at last nights meeting was a lot of comments about
individuals who want to learn a bit of PHP, especially as it relates to
Joomla.
 
 I was thinking if people are willing to pursue an alternative method of
education, I can put together a tutorial on setting up your system for
programming in Joomla along with a subsection on the website of tasks that
can be done to both improve Joomla! AND learn PHP at the same time.
 
 
 There are 4 aspects of Joomla Code that could always use a lot of help.
 
 1) Documentation
 2) Unit Tests
 3) Depreciated Functions
 4) Management of the above
 
 We could work on this as a group, as opposed to individuals.  Where a
JoomlaNYC repository of code can be kept - members can pull from a list of
tasks, work on them, submit the fixes back, and then a maintainer can
shepherd them through the giving back to Joomla! process[always the spot I
have trouble with]
 
 For example, take a look at line 74 in the Content Controller:
 http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=11000867&id=c689c7bdc2df4dbba24014567db24006&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjoomla%2Fjoomla-cms%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fcomponents%2Fcom_content%2Fcontroller.php%23L74&url_id=486258189&tags=252069,957497
 
 JError is a depreciated class - this means it will be going away at some
point.  Generally calls like this are relatively simple to fix, you just
need to replace one function call with a different call.   But these kinds
of changes are boring for an experienced programmer to do, so they tend to
linger.
 
 Moreover, the longer they linger, the more damage they inflict on 3rd
party components - since if the core code isn't fixed, you end up with 3rd
parties who keep using the same depreciated code and then one day someone
finally cleans all the stuff out, the depreciated method disappears, and
3rd party code breaks all over.
 
 Keeping a clean code base is important...it's also a great opportunity for
others to learn PHP since you will learn little snippets of coding as you
go along - the base platform can be improved, and everyone wins.
 
 I'm trying to go through this process myself just to give me a mental jump
start for the day...do a few simple php fixes...submit the patch...move on
to real work.  I was thinking if we centralized this on the NYC Joomla
site, then people could learn and improve the code at the same time...  and
if we can get a decent process in place, we can also move on to unit tests
where you can learn even more PHP coding with the added benefit that you
are learning GOOD programming practices at the same time.

As one of the people who wants to learn, I like this idea!

On a more simple / practical level -  if one is a complete beginner and
wants to learn PHP, what's a good resource to get your feet wet?  I have a
copy of "PHP and MySQL Development, 4th Edition" by Luke Wellington & Laura
Thomson, but the size of the volume has me a bit intimidated, to be honest.
 Should I just crack it open and begin reading, or are there better
resources for learning PHP from the beginning?

        Quite honestly, the way I learned PHP was by doing.  I started with
setting up a family photo gallery for my wife using Menalto Gallery,
http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=11000867&id=b321e5fac5444c8e9b8b61b00cc6ce9b&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgallery.menalto.com%2F&url_id=486265325&tags=252069,957497
 
 I'd read through the code, make minor tweaks, etc.
 
 The reason I prefer this method of learning is because it completely
bypasses a bunch of learning that is useless in the short term.
 
 Two examples of this are input and databases.
 
 When learning PHP, your going to go through a whole section on how to
connect to a mysql database, create a table, write an update, execute the
query, etc using libmysql or libmysqli.....  NO ONE does this in real life.
 In real life, we use a framework like Joomla! where all of that stuff is
already setup for us!
 
 Instead we might define the layout of a table using JTable and then just
call the get/insert/update methods. For example, if you want to get a user
by userid, you might do:
         // Create the user table object
         $table = $this->getTable();
 
         // Load the JUserModel object based on the user id or throw a
warning.
         if (!$table->load($id))
         {
             // Reset to guest user
             $this->guest = 1;
 
            
JLog::add(JText::sprintf('JLIB_USER_ERROR_UNABLE_TO_LOAD_USER', $id),
JLog::WARNING, 'jerror');
             return false;
         }
 
 
 By the same token, in a book you would be told something like, to get the
value of a field submitted in a form you would do something like:
 
 $myField = $_GET['myField'];
 
 This is bad bad, evil, never ever ever ever ever should you do this!  It
opens up your code to all sorts of security issues.  In Joomla what you
might do is:
 $myField = $jinput->get('myField', '');
 
 
 And even THAT is not a good idea.  It's much better to work at a much
higher level - but at least by doing this your data gets sanitized!
 
 In short....  I think it is probably much better to learn the how to
program Joomla! rather than how to program in PHP.  Once you have learned
how to program in Joomla!, then you can delve further into it by looking at
JInput and seeing just what that code is doing.
 
 And the other item..  I can't really answer....  I learned by learning how
to make changes to open source software...and then broadened my education
from there by seeing how they did things.

Funny you should mention Gallery... that's one of my first apps, too.  I'm
currently trying to migrate away from it to JoomGallery 2.0, so that it's
an integrated solution (along with Joomla, Kunena, Community Builder, etc.)
- I've been using JFusion to bridge Joomla and Gallery2.3.1, but it's not
the same, and the support for JFusion is flagging (the G2 module author has
vanished, and the rest of the JFusion team is buried with their own
plugins, and real life).

JoomGallery 2.0 has an import function, where you can upload an import
script and pull images and their text from other PHP-based systems.  They
have a script for JG1 to JG2, but not for Gallery2 to JG2... yet.  I have a
friend that is working on it for me (since I don't know PHP yet), but we're
still playing with the import process.

With a bit of luck, I'll be running JoomGallery2 as my photo gallery by the
time I present my site in October.  If not... I'll present it as it is now
with JFusion, and we can discuss the import script. ;-)

      Funny you should mention migrating...  I've got a whole slew of
photo's in an aging v2 Menalto Gallery which I need to consolidate onto my
new server and I really don't want to migrate to version 3...I'd rather
move it to Joomla directly and have it in a system I know better.
 
 How do you find JoomGallery for functionality?

I don't have a fully functional and populated JoomGallery setup yet (still
running with a bridged G2 until I can migrate 11 years worth of photos...
hence the script!), but from what I have played with, JG2 looks to
be comparable to Gallery2 in functionality.  It fully ties into Joomla
2.5's ACL system, which is the main reason I am interested in using it.

http://www.en.joomgallery.net/

I have a smaller site with only a handful of pictures on it in JG2, and
it's been fine - it has all the functions of Gallery2, including easy image
upload, modules with a random image, etc.  I have yet to test the more
advanced integration with Joomla and other components, though - from the
user forums, it looks like it should be able to integrate with other
components, such as Community Builder.

Once I have the migration script complete, I'll share it here - the script
author is doing this as a favor, and not interested in maintaining it once
the migration is done, however.

?
I agree that learning-by-doing is infinitely more productive.
And while I have written some php, its not my strongest skill.
I definitely need more experience, and would welcome this
opportunity to get that experience.

And if the tutorial could be woven into a part of the monthly meeting(s)
even better!

Thanks so much for suggesting this, Gary,
Janet Sullivan

Hi Guys,

Something I noticed at last nights meeting was a lot of comments
        about individuals who want to learn a bit of PHP, especially as
        it relates to Joomla.

I was thinking if people are willing to pursue an alternative
        method of education, I can put together a tutorial on setting up
        your system for programming in Joomla along with a subsection on

        of help.

1) Documentation
2) Unit Tests
3) Depreciated Functions
4) Management of the above

We could work on this as a group, as opposed to individuals.?
        Where a JoomlaNYC repository of code can be kept - members can
        pull from a list of tasks, work on them, submit the fixes back,
        and then a maintainer can shepherd them through the giving back

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv8qEzLrMOa+5jsXb9GDG9qzA3W_rKH5C4tE3QzJv89JEA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm modifying a Joomla module's .xml file so it's Description has some
additional information. But I noticed this doesn't get updated in the
Module Manager. Does the module have to be re-installed for this change to
take effect?

Does anyone know how/where the contents of a Joomla module is stored after
installation? Does it grab the .xml file and store it's contents in a MySQL
table? I wondered about this, because I have changed the .xml file before
to add something to the back-end and it's effect was immediately after I
saved the .xml file and doesn't require it be re-installed. I do remember
reading that if you added a file required to the .xml file that you do need
to re-install the module. Thanks!

You know, it would help if I was reloading the page from the same
installation of Joomla I was making the changes. This means, it's time for
dinner! :-)

But my other questions I'm still curious about. Thanks!

This may be a different / special case, but...

With Kunena Templates, when you edit the xml file for the template (which
acts like a component within Kunena), the change is reflected immediately.
 To me, this would indicate it's pulling it directly from the XML file, and
not a database entry.

If Kunena templates operate in the same fashion as modules, that's a good
indication.

Thanks for the reply, Geoffrey.

What about the options filled out in the back-end for a module? That has to
be stored somewhere and it wouldn't be the .xml file. Then again, if you
add another field in the .xml file which accepted a parameter on the
back-end it's saving it, I assume to some table in the MySQL. Interesting
that's managed in a transparent manner.

Any parameters that you add to an extension do need to be saved in
the database, but should show up in the back end right away. Just open it
up, change the setting (if different than default) and save it.

Subject: [joomla] Flash Player
Message-ID: <51C4FCE5AB2D4D26B64604A1A8BA40BA@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone!

 

I downloaded Joomlaworks "All Video" Plugin and cannot get it to work. Can
someone in the group suggest a non-commercial extension for flash files that
works right out of the box with Joomla 2.5.

 

Work Environment:

 

1.	Joomla 2.5 
2.	localhosting. 

 

 

 

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Are you just inserting them into articles? If so, JCE (
http://www.joomlacontenteditor.net) supports this well.

Subject: [joomla] Add a new module position to a Shape5 cyan template?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_hjw6gFrdr4rm8NfjaouvvX1O3q92c3CUkf2-tqGmbYA@mail.gmail.com>

I want to add a new module position to the Cyan template. This is to add a
tag line, such as "Greatest Show on Earth!". I want to add this new module
position between the above the Menu module position and between the Logo
module position and the Search module position.

I would greatly appreciate some tips on how to go about doing this. Would
doing this impact the admin back for the Cyan template?

What existing code might I start to copy and where to place it to add this
new tag module position?

Is there anything in particular I need to look out for in doing this?
Thanks!

i agree with using the JCE editor,  you have to pay for a subscription with
them to get the media plugin, but it is worth it, and very easy to do..

Message-ID: <CABr9RmneWOezO0wh7awxpoJ78Vpv6W52h-ppSehXjNH6UvzJwg@mail.gmail.com>

The Kunena team (Kunena is a free Forums component for Joomla - they just
released v2.0, it's very nice) recently did an overhaul of their own
website, bringing everything up to date with the latest versions, and
purging a lot of add-ons that were holding them back.

One of the things they got rid of was a Feature Request / Voting system -
They had a component that was previously used, but wasn't compatible with
2.5, and they tried an external system (Uservoice.com), but they found it
both clunky, and required payment to enable any worthwhile features.

Does anyone have any familiarity with a feature request / feedback system
for Joomla 2.5, that they can recommend?

Are you just inserting them into articles? If so, JCE

Hello everyone!

 

I downloaded Joomlaworks "All Video" Plugin and cannot get it to work. Can
someone in the group suggest a non-commercial extension for flash files that
works right out of the box with Joomla 2.5.

 

Work Environment:

 

1.	Joomla 2.5 
2.	localhosting.

Gary,

I think that is a great idea regarding the cleanup of the Joomla code base.

I think no matter what your level of experience with programming, there is something to be gained in looking at the existing code base. ?In fact, I find this is the best way to learn. ?In fact, as an experienced developer, my road to learning PHP is probably different from most. I find that the PHP syntax has bits and pieces of programming and scripting languages I already know (especially C and ksh) and I need the practice with PHP to distinguish the specifics of the language.

Please count me in to help clean up the deprecated functions.

Linda Amiaga ?

Subject: [joomla] Learning PHP and Joomla
 

Hi Guys,

Something I noticed at last nights meeting was a lot of comments
        about individuals who want to learn a bit of PHP, especially as
        it relates to Joomla.

I was thinking if people are willing to pursue an alternative
        method of education, I can put together a tutorial on setting up
        your system for programming in Joomla along with a subsection on
        the website of tasks that can be done to both improve Joomla!
        AND learn PHP at the same time.


There are 4 aspects of Joomla Code that could always use a lot
        of help.

1) Documentation
2) Unit Tests
3) Depreciated Functions
4) Management of the above

We could work on this as a group, as opposed to individuals.?
        Where a JoomlaNYC repository of code can be kept - members can
        pull from a list of tasks, work on them, submit the fixes back,
        and then a maintainer can shepherd them through the giving back
        to Joomla! process[always the spot I have trouble with]

For example, take a look at line 74 in the Content Controller:
http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=11000867&id=c689c7bdc2df4dbba24014567db24006&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjoomla%2Fjoomla-cms%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fcomponents%2Fcom_content%2Fcontroller.php%23L74&url_id=486258189&tags=252069,957497

JError is a depreciated class - this means it will be going away
        at some point.? Generally calls like this are relatively simple
        to fix, you just need to replace one function call with a
        different call.?? But these kinds of changes are boring for an
        experienced programmer to do, so they tend to linger.

Moreover, the longer they linger, the more damage they inflict
        on 3rd party components - since if the core code isn't fixed,
        you end up with 3rd parties who keep using the same depreciated
        code and then one day someone finally cleans all the stuff out,
        the depreciated method disappears, and 3rd party code breaks all
        over.

Keeping a clean code base is important...it's also a great
        opportunity for others to learn PHP since you will learn little
        snippets of coding as you go along - the base platform can be
        improved, and everyone wins.

I'm trying to go through this process myself just to give me a
        mental jump start for the day...do a few simple php
        fixes...submit the patch...move on to real work.? I was thinking
        if we centralized this on the NYC Joomla site, then people could
        learn and improve the code at the same time...? and if we can
        get a decent process in place, we can also move on to unit tests
        where you can learn even more PHP coding with the added benefit
        that you are learning GOOD programming practices at the same
        time.

Hi,

Has anyone used Hikashop for their shopping cart?

It seems pretty simple to install and use, but the customization of the layouts is really difficult esp the product page.  If anyone has any tips all suggestions would be welcome.

thanks

Message-ID: <1348002990.58196.YahooMailNeo@web122305.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

While editing my site, Joomla gave me an error that said something like
"invalid security token refresh the page..."
Instead of refreshing the page, I simply closed the window and tried to log back in to the admin
area.
However, now I can't login at all with that user name.? And there is no other user set up on this account
yet!? Any way to fix this besides doing a data base and root directory backup and re-installing Joomla?

I learned an expensive lesson....
Thou shalt ALWAYS create multiple logins even when working alone!

Thanks!

There's a couple pages online that describe how to do this - you need
access to the database, as you will basically be going in (probably through
cPanel / phpMyAdmin) and putting in a new password by hand.

https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/edu/joomla-25/users/reset-user-password

If this doesn't do the trick, there may be something more complex going on,
like the user becoming not an admin any more... it's possible to fix, but
more involved.

Geoffrey:

?Thanks a bunch, I was already trying to play with phpmyadmin, 
I reset the password as you suggested, but I must have done other damage,
as resetting the password didn't work. 

I noticed that the usertype of admin was set to "deprecated"
which didn't look right so I deleted "deprecated" but still can't get in.

Guess I need to re-install and restore the database....but first, I'm adding additional users
to the other Joomla sites!

Hello every one,

 

Is any one familiar with RokSprocket? 

 

I installed RockSprocket from Rocket Theme. I set up a "4 Tabs" in an
article and in a module and the "Tab" appears in both. But when I click or
hover on the tab (does not open article) nothing happens. I checked and all
modules, plugging and articles related to the "Tabs" are "Published".

 

System Setup:

 

1.	Joomla 2.5.
2.	Using localhost install.

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Inside each article in the "Filtered Article List" within Roksprocket you will see dropdowns for "Tab Label", "Icon", and "Link". If you have "Link" set to "default" then you should scroll down to the bottom of the right hand column and take a look at the "Tab Article Defaults". 
Next to "Default Link" there is a dropdown where you can choose how you want the default links to link, choose "Default Article Link".

Hope this helps.

1.    In each article I copied the module number from rocksprocket.

2.    In roksprocket I chose each article as a tab.

3.    Then I assigned (copied) the module number to another article where I
wanted the Tabs to show.

4.    The tabs showed but did not open article.

5.    I guess by having the tabs module code in each article that I wanted
as a tab I confused the software.

6.    So,,, lesson learned "the articles that are going to be the source for
the tabs you do not include the code. The code only belongs in the article
where you want the tabs to appear. Very simple.

7.    Duh.

 

Thankx

 

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Inside each article in the "Filtered Article List" within Roksprocket you
will see dropdowns for "Tab Label", "Icon", and "Link". If you have "Link"
set to "default" then you should scroll down to the bottom of the right hand
column and take a look at the "Tab Article Defaults". 

Next to "Default Link" there is a dropdown where you can choose how you want
the default links to link, choose "Default Article Link".

 

Hope this helps.

Hello every one,

 

 

 

Is any one familiar with RokSprocket? 

 

 

 

I installed RockSprocket from Rocket Theme. I set up a "4 Tabs" in an

article and in a module and the "Tab" appears in both. But when I click or

hover on the tab (does not open article) nothing happens. I checked and all

modules, plugging and articles related to the "Tabs" are "Published".

 

 

 

System Setup:

 

 

 

1.    Joomla 2.5.

2.    Using localhost install.

 

 

 

 

 

Best regards,

 

 

 

Marcos Miranda

Hey Daniel,

Now my Tabs show and are clickable. But they only show a "read more" and I
have to click on it to show article - which it does, and that is good. But I
cannot get this thing to show article when clicking on tab. I must first
choose the tab and then click on "read more" link. 

Do you have any suggestions? 

 
 
Best regards,
 
Marcos Miranda

Subject: [joomla] Email verification during Joomla Registration
Message-ID: <505B4D45.1080209@joomlaconnections.com>

Hello Everyone and Happy NYC Joomla DAY Weekend!

I have a client with a Joomla 1.5.26 site. He registers customers using 
the backend User Manager and does not want to type in the user email 
address. To clarify, he does not have a user email to enter into the 
field and does not have a need for that field.

I talked to him about a Joomla 2.5.x migration but this is not in the 
works so I started thinking about and looking at methods to hack Joomla 
1.5 (YIKES -- I hate doing this for obvious reasons).

I explored using RS Forms Pro but it appears that RS Forms Pro can not 
override the built in Joomla CMS verification that takes place at the 
registration process even if you create a custom RSForms Pro 
registration form.

There are a few posts at Joomla.org about this :

http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?p=2608020#p2608020

but I tried commenting out the the two sections of code that send the 
email out after registration and this did not solve my problem.

Does anyone know where in Joomla CMS 1.5.x I can find the specific code 
that verifies that the email field has data and/or checks the data 
entered against existing users. Perhaps I can just comment out this 
verification and be happy!

Thank You
Bob Rynkieiwcz

Donna,

Thank You, I did try that but unfortunately Joomla CMS is also looking 
for duplicate email addy's.

I was just hacking 
/administrator/components/com_users/views/user/tmpl/forms.php

But it still did not work. Where in Hades is the verification taking 
place? Is it in multiple places?

Going with the dummy email idea, have you considered using a convention
based on the username + dummy domain? That way it is unique and you are not
hacking code over this:-)

Sue,

"yes", one of the first things I said to the client was to just enter a 
dummy email that points to a non-existing domain. He replied that he 
"had enough to do when entering each user" and would prefer if the email 
field was not even on the form.

This will be my fallback if all else fails and really does seem to be 
the sane and logical approach.

Thank You
Bob Rynkiewicz

Hello everyone:

I am happy to announced that I successfully hacked my Joomla CMS site 
concerning the email account field in the user.

It is admittedly crazy but I succeeded and of course, I saved a copy of 
the original php files that were hacked.

It was both the forms.php in .../user/tmpl folder and default.php in ... 
/users/tmpl that needed adjustments.


Thank You for all the feedback.

That is probably the worst possible solution.? Every time you upgrade Joomla you will have to remember to hack those files again.

I want to collect a CC number on a secure form, then email that form data. Will PHP be able to do that?

Is there a plugin or suggested method of doing that - eg. GnuPG

Thanks for any input.

Thank you NYC Joomla user group. Kudos to everyone for putting together
this event, Marian, Laura and Scott for organizing, all the volunteers and
speakers. Looking forward to J 3.0 roll out Thursday, plus Bootstrap, and
working with responsive web. The speakers were great. I wish we could have
attended more tracks. It was good to see many old friends. I miss attending
meetings due to classes on Thursdays. I hope to attend some meetups maybe
on a Wednesday as their was a suggestion. Hung Dinh's presentation
J,000,000,000mla really put things in perspective how this CMS has helped
many workers at Joomlart and many of us the use their service and product.

Subject: [joomla] The $10 logon password protections solution
Message-ID: <11000867.13347813.20120924164345.50608dc13bd7c1.02931215@mail51.us4.mandrillapp.com>

     I just got off the phone with Marian - I'm a bit bummed that I wasn't
able to stay for the last part of the meeting as security is something that
really interests me - especially as I am directly at odds with the "common
wisdom" of security "professionals".*1
 
 In any case, she said there was a discussion of key loggers and how to
make yourself secure from them.  There is an extremely simple mechanism -
it's called a 'one time key'.  The most popular is the one used by both
Google and Amazon - TOTP.
 
 In a nutshell, when you go to log onto your Google or Amazon account when
you have enabled TOTP, in addition to your password you will also need to
enter your "one time code".  This code is generated by a program and is
based on:
 1) A preconfigured computer generated hash
 2) The time
 
 As both sides in the equation[Google and your device] know the current
time and the hash, they can create a code which will only work for the next
2 minutes.  After that, to logon you need to generate a new code.
 
 So, how do YOU get that code to enter?
 Well, if you have a smart phone - the answer is sitting in your pocket. 
Both Amazon and Google have released applications for the iPhone, the
Android, and the Blackberry which can be used to generate that code.
 http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=11000867&id=9766f7ff6ea04f44808dd14e8425905e&url=http%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fmfa%2F&url_id=723796165&tags=252069,957497
 http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=11000867&id=9766f7ff6ea04f44808dd14e8425905e&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Faccounts%2Fbin%2Fanswer.py%3Fhl%3Den%26answer%3D1066447&url_id=723796169&tags=252069,957497
 
 Once installed and configured, you simply load the application every time
you want to log on and it will tell you the current code.  Type the code in
and your good to go.
 
 But what if you don't want to depend on your smartphone?  It's just a
little application, and there are many versions of the application out
there for a PC or Mac...[I didn't bother to include Linux because this is a
geek toy - it's a given that there are at least 100,000 applications on the
internet which will run on Linux and generate a code for you]
 
 Now I'm lazy...  I really really despise the idea of copying a code every
time I want to log on to something.  So I won't use those above apps.  But
have faith, even for lazy people like me there is a solution.  Someone can
take all that code for generating the key and stick it on a little
micro-processor the size of a usb thumb drive[and with a convenient usb
connector].  Even better, they program it to pretend to be a keyboard with
1 function - output.  So your computer thinks it's a keyboard, and when you
press the button it enters the code.  So simply place the cursor in the
logon field box for the code, press the button, and you can logon.  As an
added benefit, the code is completely hidden from keyloggers[because a key
logger is a device that is placed in between a keyboard and the computer. 
It can only log the traffic that comes through it - from the keyboard
itself.  Not from any additional keyboards].
 
 The downside is, these little code generators are expensive.  Typically
they cost 10+ and only work with for a specific company.  IE an Amazon fob
only works on Amazon.  A Google MFA fob only works on Google... or does it?
 
 Go to your Joomla backend Admin.  Go to the plugins page and pull up the
authentication plugins...Joomla! comes with built in support for Google
Authentication.  Problem solved.  While your Joomla site can't use the code
generated to logon, if it allows you to logon using your Google credentials
- you can simple use a Google Fob on your Google Account and you get all
this for free[or for under $20 if buying a fob from somewhere]
 
 Hey, didn't I say there was a $10 solution?    Well, this takes a bit more
work.  Using off the shelf, open source hardware and software [most
importanly the texas insturments launchpad]  you can build your own code
generator for under 10$.  I promised Marian that I'd bring a copy of my
TOTP generator[built on the mega expensive Texas Instruments Launchpad...a
whole five dollars!!] to the next meeting to give away in the raffle.  For
those of you who don't want to take a chance on the raffle, both Spark Fun
sells them for $6 http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=11000867&id=9766f7ff6ea04f44808dd14e8425905e&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sparkfun.com%2Fproducts%2F10020&url_id=723796173&tags=252069,957497 - bring it to the
next meeting and I'll give you the code to load onto it, your Joomla site,
and your Chrome web browser.
 
 And if you REALLY want a more "professional" looking device, send me email
at msp430 at gary.mort.net <mailto:msp430 at gary.mort.net> and I'll give you the
link to my kickstarter project to fund turning all those open source
schematics into a open source thumbdrive design and getting a run of
prototypes done that can work for any Joomla website[or more accurately,
any Joomla website with the authentication extension installed].

Subject: [joomla] Including an external HTML file in an Article
Message-ID: <CABr9Rm=E5uJr69aMNESuntG8VQvzmoC6FkH2iQNpHooa70fXdw@mail.gmail.com>

I have an HTML file that is regularly updated from an external source (A
Word document that is saved out to HTML whenever the author updates it) -
for practical reasons, it's easier to keep the file in Word rather than as
a Joomla Content Article.

I'd like to include / "insert" the HTML file into a Joomla Article, so that
the file appears as an article within Joomla - also, as the HTML file is
updated, the Joomla Article automatically includes the latest version by
pulling directly from the HTML file on the server.

I tried Sourcerer and the php function "require($DOCUMENT_ROOT . "path to
file/include-file.html");", but this doesn't seem to be working - it comes
up blank.  I'm not sure if HTML Server Side Includes will work within
Joomla - does anyone have any ideas on how to pull / nest an external HTML
file into a Joomla article?

Thank you!

Subject: [joomla] Two useful links for backing up your cPanel site
Message-ID: <CABr9Rm=Phk3RhcE=PAGbSJyc3N9RO5H0Q8D2mtWunr+jjk+U_Q@mail.gmail.com>

This isn't directly related to Joomla, but is handy for anyone who wants to
do an automated backup of their server / site / cPanel account.

The first is a command / script that runs a complete backup of your cPanel
account, and sends it to a remote location.  While working with a cPanel
dump is not pretty / fun, it's good to have in case something happens to
your hosting provider, and they lose your account / shut down / etc. (i.e.
- you can't trust them, and you need to restore to another provider from a
recent backup).  NOT ALL PROVIDERS enable the backup function - BlueHost
does not, for example - since it makes it easy to migrate away from them.
 Check with your hosting provider to see if they allow full cPanel backups.
 I run this once a week for each cPanel account, and have it FTP the files
down to a storage device at my home (since it's "off-site" for my host, and
they are all personal sites).

http://www.justin-cook.com/wp/2006/12/27/automatic-cpanel-backup-domain-mysql-with-cron-php/


+++

The second is a script that dumps a copy of your mySQL databases, and sends
them to a remote location (email, FTP, etc.).  It will even clean up after
itself, so you only keep the past 4 days, etc.  This one, I run nightly,
and it FTPs the files to my storage device at home again.  If I need to do
a restore, the worst I lose is 24 hours worth of content.

http://www.ameir.net/blog/archives/48-MySQL-Backup-to-FTP-and-Email-Shell-Script-for-Cron-v2.2.html


+++

For my home storage solution, I use a ReadyNAS
<http://www.readynas.com>device - they come in home use models, as
well as professional models that
mount in a rack in a datacenter.  They're designed to just store a large
amount of data in a very friendly way, and serve it up with several methods
(local network browsing, FTP, Web Interface, etc.).

If this HTML is a menu item, you can use an iframe wrapper menu type.

It will appear as an article, keeping the original HTML formatting.

?Thanks for sharing this.? I do manually do cpanel backups for all my clients and always assumed 
that there was a way to set up a cron job, but never had time to look into it.? 

This is great, thanks!

http://s3tools.org/s3cmd) to securely upload these backups to Amazon S3. I
can dig up an example script if you're interested.

It sort of works, but it's not an article in that it can appear in an
Article Listing within a Category (i.e.: Menu Type - Category List), and
anchors within the HTML document seem to be lost within an iFrame (meaning
a Table of Contents won't work).

There should be another way around it to get it included inside an article
- I'll post back here if I can figure it out.

I use Jinclude for including small bits of html /javascript /php. It can
reference a pathname too. So maybe a solution for you.

Subject: [joomla] Trouble curling pages on Joomla
Message-ID: <CAMtoWUHA7mY9RpAZOdsK6oAe+jhT1-A-vWKyHdJ+6KrHw-hWaw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I'm trying to create a selector menu in an iframe similar to the way
com_media is used using an existing joomla component that doesn't seem to
be designed for the task. I thought I would curl the page and change the
links to point to a javascript function in the parent window before
displaying. That way I don't modify any of the components original source
code. However I'm having trouble logging in to the joomla site using curl.
I tried the php code for joomla1.5 which I found @
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2212557/curl-login-by-script-to-a-joomla-website#answer-4532020
.
I changed the sitename username and password, and it doesn't seem to work
on joomla 2.5(I haven't tried it using joomla 1.5 but that won't really
help me today).  I made some changes and tried using the following code
which leaves me with an empty looking response, on my second curl(first one
works fine). Does anyone know why this isn't working?

<?php
$uname = $_POST['username'];
$upswd = $_POST['password'];
$url = "http://joomla.website.com/administrator/index.php";

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url );
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, FALSE );
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, TRUE );
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, './cookie.txt');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, './cookie.txt');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, FALSE );
$ret = curl_exec($ch);

// Get and set POST fields
$DOM = new DOMDocument;
$DOM->loadHTML($ret);
$items = $DOM->getElementsByTagName('input');
$postfields = array();
foreach ($items as $item){
  if (!(strtolower($item->getAttribute('type'))=="submit")){
    $postfields[$item->getAttribute('name')]=$item->getAttribute('value');
  }
}

$postfields['username'] = urlencode($uname);
$postfields['passwd'] = urlencode($upswd);
$postfields['lang'] = '';
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $postfields);
$ret = curl_exec($ch);
// show the postfields and the results
?><pre><?
print_r($postfields);
echo htmlentities(sizeof($ret))."\n";
?></pre>

If there's a better way to do this I'm all ears, however I'd like to get
this to work too.

Perfect!  Thank you, Helv?cio, that did what I needed!  I somehow didn't
see it in the JED when I looked.

I'll need to tweak the HTML a bit since it wants to override the CSS in
Joomla, but I think I can get around that. :-)

Thank you again!

-Geoffrey

Sorry, I can't seem to find my notes on it. But, it is very simple to use.
For example, ~$ s3cmd put file.tar.gz s3://foo/file.tar.gz

I recall that http://s3tools.org/s3cmd has everything you need to know.
I'll post those notes if I can find them.

Subject: [joomla] Homepage Layout
Message-ID: <79F4DEF82AB044599717F9D96F2F45E8@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone!

 

I'm reading the Joomla 2.5 Beginners Guide Book- By Eric Tiggeler.

 

I want to "Layout" the home page as follows:

1.	Leading Articles = 1 
2.	Intro Articles = 4 
3.	Columns = 2 

 

And what I get is the leading article displayed correctly but the other
articles are not laid out in the two column format. They are displayed in a
single column - which option flag did I miss?

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

     JoomlaDay was a blast, I really enjoyed the sessions and all and
meeting the people.
 
 As such, it got my mental juices flowing on some projects I've thought
would be cool if they existed, but really need a community umbrella to run
them on....  since the projects all fall under "community outreach" and
Board elections are coming up soon, I was wondering if there is a specific
position for that?  Also I wanted to ask how I go about running for
election?  
 
 I will admit, I haven't made it to enough meetings lately.  This has
nothing to do with the content of the meetings, and more due to distance
and expense.  Until this past year I lived up in Kingston which was simply
too far in general - now that I live in Beacon it's much easier to make the
meetings - I just didn't want to make the financial commitment to get to
them.  So, assuming all goes well, I'm going to make that commitment for
next year and make sure to come.
 
 One thing I'd like to see is our own user group extensions directory -
where members can post reviews of Joomla extensions they use.  One of my
original goals with the group was to learn what people in NYC were using -
not some incredibly large international extension directory where the only
users might be on another continent!  
 
 Also, one thing that is bumming me is that while I met lots of interesting
people and there were discussions I'd love to follow up on from JoomlaDay -
I can only talk to the fraction I exchanged contact data with.  Online
forums for each of those sessions would be a great way for people to
reconnect and continue discussions.
 
 Just thought I'd ask what others are thinking and throw my hat into the
ring.

I was thinking in terms of the local NYC JUG - would it be worthwhile to
use Joomla itself to set up a community system?  Use Kunena Forums instead
of a mailing list, and Community Builder for our profiles?

I can help set that all up, and even provide hosting for the site on my
VPS, with a complete cPanel account, if it will help.

Running for the board is easy.
You just had to attend a number of past meetings or be a founder.
I for one would love to have you create that position, therefore I 
nominate you as Community Outreach person.
We need other people to step up and help.

Thanks to everyone that supported JoomlaDayNYC 2012...overall it was a
great event, special thanks to the volunteers and speakers that made it
happen...

But, not everyone in our user group attended the event, and we want to
know, WHY???  Is there something that we could have done better, is there
something we missed???

In order for us to continue having events like this in the future we need
to make sure that we are meeting the needs of our LOCAL Joomla User Group
community...

PLEASE, complete this survey and let us know what we missed...and what will
make you come for future events!

thanks,

Found The Problem!

 

I was copying text from the Lorem Ipsum website directly into the article.
The text brought some additional html, in particular div's and br.

I deleted the article text and copied new text from lorem into a notepad
file, saved it and then copied to article, but the html editor in Joomla
again showed div and breaks. Hum.

 

I then deleted the div's and the page break in all the articles. Now my home
page displays exactly what I enter in "Menu - Layout Options".

 

According to all tutorials I have read entering text in notepad - saving it
and then copying to Joomla eliminated all additional html/code. It didn't!!

 

Thankx

 

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Helvecio,

 

I thank you for the advice. But I was aware of the issues associated
additional html. That?s why I tried pasting first to (as noted in many
tutorials) my notepad, saving and then copying to Joomla and still got some
residual html with copy/paste. I finally had to manually delete the
misbehaving html code.

 

Gracias!

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Por nada, Marcos.

Actually that is just a suggestion for your future projects/needs. By using
the "paste from Word" function in JCEditor, one saves the trouble and time
of opening Notepad or any other program just to paste content from any HTML
source.

I find it very helpful, as when I click OK, content is inserted retaining
just paragraph tags and, sometimes, strong tags.

All the best!
