<PRE>I've been using Joomla for years now, but until recently I had not focused
on K2.

A few things which are wonderful about K2. First of all, the extra fields
which helps to add additional fields to K2 Item. I think the use of
sub-categories is also good.

Some things make me uncomfortable and I wanted to share those here to see
how others might be handling them. There is the Joomla template and then
there is the K2 template. The K2 template controls that part of the webpage
like the body of it, for lack of a better term while the Joomla template
handles the rest. So the K2 template for a K2 item is like being able to
have your own template for each Joomla article. This sounds amazingly
flexible but with this comes what I find to be a disconnect and enter into
a very un-Joomla-like area. If you don't like the layout of the K2 template
such as it's order on the sections on the page page, you have to resort to
editing a PHP program (item.php) in order to change this. K2 doesn't have
modules like Joomla does for the templates so you can't go in as
administrator and change the ordering of the modules because there are no
modules.

I started to wonder if there might be a K2 Template Manager which might do
what the Template Manager does for Joomla. I've seen one online but I don't
think it allows ordering of the K2 part of the page unless I missed
something. After having looked over the item.php code this past week it
doesn't look like there is any other way to change the order of what is on
the page than to edit item.php itself. I've also not been able to find the
kind of documentation on K2 templates like there is for Joomla templates.

Even with Joomla templates no programming is required to move modules
around on the page such as top, bottom, etc. How are people managing this
with K2? Is there a better way?
