Message-ID: <CABcNofMQTG1Kpq5FXhkiMFdsz+w8BLN+hCvAop8dDWiWJsHOCg@mail.gmail.com>

For those who have clamoring for jQuery support for Joomla, like me, and
have already started using Joomla 1.7 for all your projects, also like me,
I have good news: the latest version of K2 provides support for jQuery on
the front end as well as features like comments, social sharing, thumb
nails, cck, etc.

The good folks at Garvick have put together a helpful standard Joomla 1.7
vs. K2 v.2.5.1 features comparison list.
http://bit.ly/vZLoqP

You can get K2 at http://getk2.org

Want to learn more? I will present K2 v 2.5 at the December Joomla NYC User
Group meeting on 12/9 (November meeting is already filled up.)

All best,

Steve

If you want jquery support really easy use this, It is great it also adds jquery to the administration system if wanted.

But That is cool about the k2 upgrade!

Message-ID: <CABcNofN1=rdgQDYrOiRDjjuYSbsj7PGbxEuUbjHno2kfcTBbrg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

One of our favorite NYC JUG sponsors, Steve Burge of OS Training has put
together an excellent tutorial on how to install and configure Virtue Mart
2.0 with Joomla 1.7. For the past two years (and maybe longer!) OS Training
has provided the food for our monthly meetings.

If you or a friend need training in Joomla, WordPress or Drupal, check out
OSTraining.com They offer video tutorials as well as scheduled classroom
training. (Our own Laura Gordon teaches the Joomla class in NYC.) I have
taken the online Joomla video tutorials and they have helped me.

Virtue Mart has received mixed reviews from members. I have personally used
it without any problems, but I know there are others who feel differently.

Either way, the new Virtue Mart is worth checking out if you need to add
e-commerce to your Joomla website.

Message-ID: <CABcNofOXvsXLGJG5iQ7NOdwfnXM6WR2_duyWZ+o74q_zM52K6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

If you haven't seen Brian Teeman's "Hidden Joomla 1.7 Secrets" yet, you
must do so!

Grab a cup of coffee (or a cold beer) and plan to spend the next 42 minutes
watching Brian show the hidden features of Joomla 1.7.

Some secrets are well-known like Page Break and the JCE Editor, but most
are real secrets, like how to create elaborate forms with the new Form and
Registration tool, shorten domain URLs with the Redirect Manager and design
specialized Admin panels with Admin Praise Light and there are many others.

It's a must see. I guarantee you will learn at least one or two new
features about Joomla 1.7. (NOTE: We must get Brian Teeman, - one of the
Joomla founders - to present at the next Joomla Day NYC Weekend 2012)

http://www.slideshare.net/brianteeman/hidden-joomla-17-secrets

I also want to remind everyone that the next Joomla NYC Meeting takes place
at 6:30 PM on Thursday, Nov. 10th at Lincoln Center, 146 W. 65th Street.
(See joomlanyc.org for more details.)

This meeting is extra special because along with the presentations, we will
be asking those interested in becoming a Joomla NYC board member, to give a
short one paragraph speech on why they want to join the board. Current
board members much also present.

I will be posting more info on the board elections later this week.

Have a great weekend!

All best,

Steve

Our favorite MicroSofty and gracious host sponsor of Joomla Day NYC Weekend
2011, Peter Laudati aka JrzyShr, has written an excellent blog post,
"Keeping It Professional."

It covers two topics - women in technology (or the lack of, although I have
found an almost 50/50 female/male ratio working with Joomla) and the use of
profanity among developers. I have to agree that with almost every project
that I have worked on, there seems to be an abundance of people using four
letter words. I have also found that using profanity has never improved a
project and in fact, in many cases made the situation worse.

Most Joomla folks that I have been around do not use profanity (at least
not very often) and respect others, regardless of whether they are male or
female, but Peter's article is worth a read if you have a minute.

Subject: [joomla] Upcoming Joomla NYC User Group elections
Message-ID: <CABcNofO09+Uo8oLwa8FH4C798HbGN2TLCPpfjyoH=gxg_qQxJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Joomla NYC Participants,

As many of you know, those interested in being on the board of Joomla NYC
as well as those already on the Joomla NYC board, have to give a short
presentation at this week's Joomla NYC User Group meeting on Thursday
(tomorrow!). Please try to keep it to a few paragraphs and no longer than
three minutes.

If you cannot make the meeting, you can ask me or another member to read it
for you.

In a nutshell, we want to hear what you have contributed to the group and
what you would like to do to make the Joomla NYC even better.

To get an idea of what we want, I have posted a copy of Laura Gordon's
presentation at the bottom of this message (Hope you don't mind Laura :-).

Among the changes that the current board has made is to reduce the board to
seven members from the current 13. We have decided that it is better to
have a smaller board where every member is expected to participate than a
large board where some members participate and some do not.

We will take the names of those who would like to be on the board and
create ballots. We will then vote at the December meeting. Note that there
will be no absentee voting. You have to attend the December meeting to
vote.

If you want an idea of what it is like to be on the board, there is a short
explanation below:

Responsibilities: Attend at least five to six monthly meetings per year.
(Note that there can be exceptions, but this rule is important because
board members need to know what the group is doing.) Chair at least one
monthly meeting per year. Volunteer to help at monthly meetings,
JoomlaCamp, and Joomla Day NYC Weekend. Constantly promote Joomla to
members and outsiders. Help Joomla newcomers. Communicate ideas to the
board and other members.

Once the board has been voted on, those board members will then choose who
will be President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Web Master/Mistress from the
group. It should also be noted that board position terms are limited to one
year. This gives everyone a chance to serve. Although, there can be
exceptions, this would require a 100% agreement from all board members.

Please let me know if you have further questions. I hope to see everyone at
the Joomla NYC November Meeting this Thursday.

- - - Steve

	another reminder
Message-ID: <CABcNofP9aNFT0nwmtvkkFLqFUxT+CU+s1ra0=xvir4T-ASANsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

One last reminder about tomorrow night's November Joomla User Group meeting
at 6:30 PM at Lincoln Center (for directions see www.joomlanyc.org )

I also noticed that Steve Burge just posted another tutorial to
OSTraining.com This one is about SP Upgrade, a program that helps guide you
through the process of upgrading from Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.7.

http://www.ostraining.com/blog/joomla/sp-upgrade-for-joomla-15-to-17-migration/

I have a few Joomla 1.5 sites that will eventually need to be upgraded and
I am not looking forward to it. But this article looks like it can be done
without much pain. Has anyone upgraded a Joomla 1.5 site yet? And if so,
how did go?

Hope to see everyone tomorrow night.

Upgrade 1.5 to 1.7

Hi all, I have upgraded a few sites from 1.5 to 1.7, and I found the
migration to go pretty smoothly...

some things to think about...

1. When I did the upgrade the upgrade was really for CONTENT only, using
the (jupgrade) migration tool it took minutes to do...
2. I rebuilt the template off of a 1.7 template, but then adjusted it as I
needed
3. I reinstalled new versions of all of the components that I was using to
the 1.7 versions.  Some of the components have versions that allow you to
'migrate', some better than others, but that is really component dependent.
4. this is a great time to 'adjust your template', organization and overall
look of your site, especially if the site is 2-3 years old, why not, if you
are going through the time to upgrade, might as well make it a little
visual, if you want.

Be patient, some things work a little differently, but you'll get used to
it!

Also keep in mind, version 2.5 is coming out in jan/feb 2012, supposedly
the jump from 1.7 to 2.5 won't be as big, so if you start the migration
plan now, and you can, it might be something to think about.

One more thing to think about, I have told my clients that they don't
'HAVE' to upgrade to 1.7 or even 2.5 immediately, but to create a budget
plan to at least start thinking about the migration during
2012...eventually my guess is by 2012, any new extensions, etc won't work
in 1.5, which will 'force' you to upgrade anyway...so plan and budget ahead
of time.

I'll be at the meeting in december so see you then!

perhaps if you are all interested I could do a demo of the migration of a
basic site from 1.5 to 1.7...

Just noticed that updates to both Joomla CMS's are out. Both are security
releases so you would be wise to install these ASAP.

I'll also use this opportunity to introduce the new board of directors. We
were fortunate to have seven candidates running for seven positions, so no
election was required.

The new seven member board is:

Fred Sullivan
Marian Konop
Laura Gordon
Sebastian Duque
Donna Vincent
Scott Wolpow
Stephen Britton

The next move for the board is to figure out who will be the new president,
secretary, treasurer, and web master/mistress for 2012/

There are also three honorary  board members. The board has decided that we
should honor those that have contributed to the success of the NYC Joomla
Users Group and the Joomla CMS.  Honorary board members do not have voting
rights and are not required to attend meetings. But they have a great title
:-)

The honorary board members are:

Elin Waring - former president of Open Source Matters and currently very
active in the development of Joomla 1.7 - 2.5. She has also presented at
many NYC JUG meetings and NYC Joomla Days.

Mitch Pirtle - a founding developer of Joomla and among the first to help
organize the New York Joomla Users Group. He has also presented at numerous
NYC JUG meetings and Joomla Days. He currently lives in Italy with his
family.

Gary Mort - a founding member of the NYC JUG and frequent presenter at NYC
Joomla User Group meetings. He currently lives in Woodstock, NY with his
family.

Have a great week!

All best,

Steve

I have updated three sites to 1.7.3 from 1.7.2 and did not encounter any
problems.

Maybe there is a conflict with a third-party component or module?

I have noticed that you have to be patient when you update Joomla. Unlike
the WordPress one-click upgrades, where process happens immediately, I have
waited as long as 90 seconds for a Joomla upgrade to happen. (I cross my
fingers and hope that it doesn't time out :-)

Donna, hopefully you have a backup so you won't lose anything.

Now, I am off to upgrade a few 1.5 sites to 1.5.25

No problems here with 20+ sites.

@Stephen. You're right, it can be a little slow.

I remember with WordPress that it was a process that improved with time. The first WP auto updates (version 2.7?) were slooooww. Each subsequent version since then was quicker. 

I'm sure the same will be true of Joomla. I know Nick from Akeeba is already committing quite a lot of improvements.

Message-ID: <26B9B1DD-BD6C-4CFC-A363-6D999AB8721A@julioandrade.com>


Hi all,

Long time reader, first time poster.

I need some help figuring out how to redirect site members to a page, after login.  Specifically, when you give out a link to something like: http://members.poweroptions.org/news/newsletters/22-fall-2011-newsletter

If a member follows this link, and the member is NOT logged into the site, they will be asked to login. After a user is logged in, they are taken to the home page, NOT the page they were being directed to in the first place.

My client wants to redirect to the correct, after login, automatically. Is there way to do this? I tried using: Advanced Login Redirect on 404. It worked for a while, but now it's not working at all. 

Please help.

Thanks,

Julio

Dear Julio,

In php file of login form:

  if (!isset($FORM["redirect_url"]))
  {
    if (isset($SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"]) &&
        isset($SERVER["PATH_INFO"]) &&
        isset($SERVER["QUERY_STRING"]))
    {
      if ($SERVER["QUERY_STRING"] != "")
      {
        $FORM["redirect_url"] = $SERVER["PATH_INFO"] . "?" .
$SERVER["QUERY_STRING"];
      }
      else
      {
        $FORM["redirect_url"] = $SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"];
      }
    }
  }

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In form:
  <?php
    if (isset($FORM["redirect_url"]))
    {
      $clsHtmlHidden = new HtmlHidden($clsHtmlForm);
      $clsHtmlHidden->setAttribute("name","redirect_url");
      $clsHtmlHidden->setAttribute("value",$FORM["redirect_url"]);
      echo $clsHtmlHidden->toHtml();
    }
  ?>  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am using this code for after login redirect:

              $redirectUrl = $cfgSubscriberLogin->getAfterLoginPage();
              if (isset($FORM["redirect_url"]))
              {

                       $SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"] != "")
              {
                if ($SERVER["QUERY_STRING"] != "")
                {
                  $redirectUrl = $SERVER["PATH_INFO"] . "?" .
$SERVER["QUERY_STRING"];
                }
                else
                {
                  $redirectUrl = $SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"];
                }
              }
              
              if (strpos($redirectUrl,"login.php") > 0)
              {
                $redirectUrl = "profile.update.php";
              }
              
              if (strpos($redirectUrl,"?") === FALSE) 
              {
                $redirectUrl .= "?alert_message=Welcome back " .
$item->getValue("first_name");
              }
              else
              {
                $redirectUrl .= "&alert_message=Welcome back " .

              }

Subject: [joomla] Can you access the Joomla Forum?
Message-ID: <CAHM6=OAMf7HhfPA8t7BX3L4HfMQ5cBCuAxVfLT9=BW9oTZbM=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone!

I'm getting a 406 Not Acceptable error when trying to access the Joomla
Forum:

> Not Acceptable
>
> An appropriate representation of the requested resource /viewtopic.php
> could not be found on this server.
>
> Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an
> ErrorDocument to handle the request.
> ------------------------------
> Apache/2.2.17 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.17 OpenSSL/0.9.8e-fips-rhel5
> mod_bwlimited/1.4 PHP/5.3.6 Server at forum.joomla.org Port 80


Is it just me?

I'm getting notifications from the forum, but can't access it for days.
Starting to look weird...
