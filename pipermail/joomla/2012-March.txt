Just a quick note that 1.6 reached end of life August of 2011 and there
have been security releases since. The current version is 2.5, 1.7 was the
previous version.

Subject: [joomla] Looking for a Joomla reminder extension
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_o2rTOAupsX4q8MEPSGWE7LKR+8MeDfL68Y2oRpVuqWA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for a Joomla extension that will allow the user to select
a date and time, enter in text details and have a reminder email sent
to them before the due date. Is there an existing extension that
offers this? I looked at RSEvents but that doesn't offer this
function. I also want the ability for the user to be able to edit
their appointments or cancel the reminder. I'd prefer that this work
with Joomla 2.5.

Hi There,

Reason I have joined Joomla community is positive energy in making meetings
and helping developers
That does not know much about Joomla. As I am getting older I see more that
I can help others
Than ask for help.

Best regards,
Sasa

Subject: [joomla] Is this a job for rewrite (.htaccess) or SEF in Joomla?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv9vX7ydh82_f0PpVFp+CKrRSGFz5ZJm8YXkLtAZHcYeNQ@mail.gmail.com>

A Joomla installation was hosted in a directory called /site. When visitors
went to domain.com it redirected them to domain.com/site.
This website is being moved to a new server and I it to operate out of it's
own domain.com without the sub-directory /site. This sounds easy enough to
accomplish but there are print published links which have
domain.com/sitethat still need to be supported.

Is there an elegant way to tell Joomla to also accept domain.com/site so it
finds these few hidden links? Should I set-up a redirect for anything to
domain.com/site goes to domain.com? Thanks!

December. I was wondering, if you have pursued the development of this idea

I'm working on putting together a CLI Joomla Installer similiar to Drupal's
"drush" - which can install Joomla! into a folder, upgrade modules, etc from
the command line - and I'm curious if there are enough people familiar
enough with running from the linux command line on this list, and
interested, to play around/test it.

Message-ID: <4F6793FA.9000606@wolpow.com>

Has anyone used a good Real Estate component with MLS capabilities?

I need to be able to import from a MLS provider and choose what fields 
re displayed.

That means the feeds are dumped into a DB.
Yes I know that each MLS has different field names.

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv8Rtvj=njmS73nPZyDd6n0THK7eN8EuRiV2yN=8-AEiuA@mail.gmail.com>

I have a web page in Joomla 2.5, where it contains an Article and a
custom HTML module. The Article has the print icon showing, but of
course, when it prints it doesn't include the custom HTML module. I
was wondering how to best solve this so the entire page prints with
the Article and the custom HTML module. Is there another way to do
this in Joomla or is there some nice extension to use that shows the
print icon allowing the user to print the entire web page? Thanks!

Does every page have this custom HTML module?? If so, you can put that HTML directly into the print template.? For example, if you want your website's name and logo on the print page.

Hello Donna.

Thanks for the reply.

Good question, no, this custom HTML module does not appear on every
page. It only appears on two web pages.

Hello Donna.

Thanks for the reply.

Good question, no, this custom HTML module does not appear on every
page. It only appears on two web pages.

Subject: [joomla] Simple Caddy and SEF
Message-ID: <75ba0726-2e16-e659-eaea-df8937eb5c6e@me.com>

Hello,
I've installed/enabled all of the Simple Caddy components, modules & plugins and am working on configuring them, to use my client's PayPal account as the Payment Gateway. When I click the order button that Atlantic Intelligence documentation says should take me to my clients PayPal account (yes, I've confirmed her PayPal credentials), it instead takes me to a page (www.mysite.com/index.php?option=com_cad ... t&Itemid=0) which displays default Joomla content.?

AI support tells me that SC doesn't always work well with the SEF set to yes in the J Global Configuration and offered up sh404SEF as a possible solution. Though the extensions I found only seem to work on 1.5 sites (mine is 1.7 site). I need SEF url's and I'd like SC to work on my 1.7 site. Might anyone have recommendations for a 3rd party extension that would allow for SEF urls & SC functionality?


I posted on the J Forum with no response.

Thanks,
Toni

Hey Toni!!

How are you?

Have you tried VirtueMart or is it too much for your project?

Good luck!

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_o8BiWTVK=9h+C93H75Wv1nha+r3abCYDiTz6BiMdoEQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using the extension by kksou for Googledirections. It works well,
you can put in your address and it uses Google maps to show directions
to a pre-set address. The problem is when you click on the Joomla
print icon to print the map with the directions, the text directions
don't print. It behaves as if the user didn't enter their own address.

It appears by putting in this example in an article:
{googleDir_tohere width=320 height=360 dir_width=275 home_addr="123
Main Street, Anytown NY 10036" home_label="Wayne Manor"}

Is there some Joomla behavior about this I am missing? Or is this a
bug in kksoy Googledirections?

Anyone have another Joomla extension or method to do this that you are
happy with? Thanks!

David Roth

Hi David,

Unfortunately, I don't have a quick answer. I have never used the Google
Directions plugin, but it sounds great and I might use it in an upcoming
project. I am not sure how it works, but I will guess that it displays
content in the component region.

I am curious. When you print, does it print out a blank page or just text
without images? What is the printed output?

I have some ideas on how you might fix the issue.

Printing in Joomla is largely controlled by the component.php and print.css
files. Some templates do not have these files. Make sure that your template
does. Check the print.css file and make sure that the graphics have not
been turned off. You might see CSS code like this "img {display:none;}" If
so, remove this code and see how it works.  You might also want to
temporarily remove all the code from the print.css file and see what prints
out.

Then I would ask the template vendor if they have any ideas on how to fix
it. As I mentioned, printing in Joomla is limited to the components area.
If the content from this plugin is displayed in this region, there should
be a way to print it out.

I would also check the Joomla developer and docs area for information on
the component.php file. I recall that Andrew Eddy has written some articles
about using this file.

Let me know if you find a solution. I am heading up to Joomla Day New
England. Maybe I'll see you there.

All best,

Steve

Hi Steve.

Thanks for the reply.

Not a blank page, just the map without the directions for the user
that is displayed on the page. I got a reply from the developer since
my posting, who said it would require modifying Joomla core for this
to work with the print icon. I'm wondering now if there might be
another option though.

Thanks for the information and suggestions. Have fun at Joomla Day New
England, I can't get away to attend.

Best regards,

David

David,

I'm not sure but perhaps my website does what you need. ?I
used the Googlemaps Plugin. ?I have not upgraded this site
yet from Joomla 1.5, but will be doing it shortly.

Hi Steve.

Thanks for the reply.

Not a blank page, just the map without the directions for the user
that is displayed on the page. I got a reply from the developer since
my posting, who said it would require modifying Joomla core for this
to work with the print icon. I'm wondering now if there might be
another option though.

Thanks for the information and suggestions. Have fun at Joomla Day New
England, I can't get away to attend.

Best regards,

David

Hi Linda.

This looks good, since it opens a new tab and the user then has access
to all of what Google has to offer in the way of maps and it takes
care of the printing. I don't like the idea of taking the user off the
web page, but in reality most users would be more familiar with
dealing directly with Google maps.

I'm still twisting over the suggestion of the developer that the
Joomla Core would have to be modified. If NASA wanted to use Joomla as
a back-end to manage all of Mission Control, yeah, then modifying the
Joomla Core would be acceptable. But to print directions, there had to
be another solution. Thanks!

Best regards,

David

You should not have to modify core files. I wonder if this is something
that could be fixed with an HTML over-write?

I still think that there is a way to print it out. This plug-in writes to
an article file.

Try to find out what core files need to be changed.

Hi Stephen.

I just e-mailed the developer to ask what part of the Joomla core
would need to be modified.

This is what the developer told me previously:

"The user inputs disappeared when you click the Print icon because
that print icon comes standard with a Joomla article. The "Google
Directions ToHere" plugin is an addon to the Joomla article. It does
not come with the Joomla core - and naturally Joomla core does not
know that it has to fill in the "Coming From" field which the user has
entered when it pop up the print screen. That's why that field is
empty.
    To automatically populate that field requires a change to the
Joomla core - which I don't think you will want to do that.
    You can try other plugins in joomla.org. I think all will have the
same effect - because all that Joomla print icon does is to pop up
that Joomla print screen."

Message-ID: <CABcNofMd9NuYCuaegGZ36VgjqdO0WrufrEX1Qr8SMi9E3ZSDMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

I want to give everyone an early heads-up on the next monthly Joomla NYC
meeting.

In April, we will take a break from the usual presentation format and hold
a special all "Lightning Round" meeting.

Bring all your Joomla questions and turn them loose on our distinguished
membership group. We'll do our best to answer them and provide the best
solutions.

I?ve already started my question list. You should start writing yours too.

And as always, there will be food and admission remains free. Hope to see
you all at 6:30 PM on Thursday, April 12.

All best,

Steve

Subject: [joomla] Linking problems 2.5.3
Message-ID: <CB9B5198.2197C%toddsugi@gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm getting some problems using the "article" link button in the Article
Manager: Edit Article.  When I click on the article button to link to
another article I am able to select the article for linking but it provides
the wrong link.  For example if the article I'm editing is in the category:
photos and the article that I want to link to is in the category:
photo-sets.  The link generated will have the current category listed see
below: 
http://localhost/abe/index.php/media-video-pictures/photos?id=20
The category is suppose to be photo-sets, but as shown it is linking to the
category photos.

Any one experiencing the same problems?

Thanks,
Todd

Hi,

Has anyone integrated Facebook photo galleries into their Joomla site? I
know Simple Image Gallery Pro can integrate flickr galleries, but haven't
seen anything for Facebook. If anyone knows anything it would be much
appreciated!

Thanks,

Any good ideas for a Glossary system for 2.5?

I want include definitions of terms on a site.
There was a perfect one for 1.5 but they have not yet ported it.
