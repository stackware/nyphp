And this month is another over-the-internets edition with Azrul Rahim

networking extension, JomSocial, as well as what he is up to in
general. Looking forward to an interesting evening.

After I RSVP on the joomlanyc.org website, the response page goes wonky 
as if the css code was missing.
My browser is Firefox 3.0.1

I'm seeing a lot of 404's  like this:
http://www.joomlanyc.org/index.php/modules/mod_yoo_search/mod_yoo_search.css.php

I'm guessing it's "seo url rewrites" gone awry.

[20090102] - Core - plg_xstandard Directory Traversal 
Posted: 09 Jan 2009 08:22 AM PST
	* Project: Joomla!
	* SubProject: plg_xstandard
	* Severity: High
	* Versions: 1.5.8 and all previous 1.5 releases
	* Exploit type: Directory Traversal
	* Reported Date: 2009-January-7
	* Fixed Date: 2009-January-9
Description
A crafted request can cause disclosure of the directory structure on the server (including any directory that php has access to).
Affected Installs
All 1.5.x installs prior to and including 1.5.8 are affected.
Solution
Upgrade to latest Joomla! version (1.5.9 or newer).

[20090101] - Core - JSession SSL Session Disclosure 
Posted: 09 Jan 2009 08:12 AM PST
	* Project: Joomla!
	* SubProject: framework 
	* Severity: Low
	* Versions: 1.5.8 and all previous 1.5 releases
	* Exploit type: Session Hijacking/ 
	* Reported Date: 2008-November-20
	* Fixed Date: 2009-January-9
Description
When running a site under SSL ONLY (the entire site is forced to be under ssl), Joomla! does not set the SSL flag on the cookie.  This can allow someone monitoring the network to find the cookie related to the session.  Please note that all data is still transferred securely. 
Affected Installs 
1.5.8 and lower installs which are run with SSL only (no non-ssl access).   
Solution
Upgrade to latest Joomla! version (1.5.8 or newer), and set force_ssl in global configuration. Alternatively, the php setting session.secure_cookie can be set in .htaccess or php.ini.  Joomla! (all versions) will respect this setting.

If you use the com object below and you can upgrade your site in one
click and it will monitor Joomla for the latest and greatest.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla calendar solution or Mozilla Sunbird?
Message-ID: <642abf2e0901130916n7bc120epa37bb2011ab80fef@mail.gmail.com>

On the LAN, we have Mac OS X, XP, CentOS, Ubuntu. On the Macs we have
been using Microsoft Entourage for a long time, but I want to move
away from it to have something which is crossed-platform and where the
user data could be retrieved from the file server on the LAN. I first
thought about a Joomla solution to replace the calendar features such
as Tasks from Entourage. Then I started to wonder if Mozilla Sunbird
(http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/) would be a better
solution. This of course is all for an Intranet.

I'd be interested in opinions/suggestions and experiences with either solution.

Thanks in advance,

David Roth

I have never seen a post on the non profit lists about sunbird.. I
don't know whether that's good or bad.
One advantage of Joomla would be the ability to to tie it into a CMS etc.

Thanks for your reply. To answer your question,  is to move to a
solution "... which is crossed-platform". - David

Is there a mail handler for Joomla that lets you add content to your site by sending an email?  (Drupal has this.)

Is it as easy as having a script parse files in /mail/new and then inserting into the database?  If so, how would security be handled to prevent spam from being uploaded to the site?

I assume that what you are looking for is for individual calendars just
like in Outlook. There are several extensions for Joomla that do
calendar functions, but are geared toward organization announcements.
They're not the personal calendar you see in Outlook.

How about Zimbra which I think Yahoo bought last year. There might be a
concern about its long term existence since M$ was waltzing around the
prospect of buying Yahoo. Zimbra doesn't tie into Joomla at all, but may
be what you are looking for if you want an exchange replacement. I
believe Zimbra runs on the LAMP stack

There's also ClarkConnect, which is a standalone server. From what I
understand, it also serves as a files server (CIFS/SMB). I haven't had
chance to evaluate it yet, but it's sitting on the bench waiting its
turn.

I have set up rooms at 100 + different locations and its never they
was they "say": it is.
I would rather be at Staples at 8.05 looking for extension cords than 9.05 am.
Also there is a line I missed from 9.00 am till 10 am which is for the
peeps the  8 am  is more for the staff folks.

Sat  10 - 5 ??
Sun 10 - 4 ??

David,

Following in the alternative options vein, suggest you take a look at 
Open-Xchange. It's server based, with Web client for Mac and Linux 
desktops, plus Outlook with XP if you like. I have not dug into the 
email part of it, but the calendaring and collaboration capabilities 
look pretty impressive.

If I was not having so much fun building Joomla sites, I would instead 
set myself up as a groupware provider for smaller orgs offering hosted 
Open-Xchange.

I think just the presentation should be recorded and not the entire meeting, because it would limit our discussions.  Or else someone would have to edit the video before publishing.

Brings up a great point - we have a HD videocamera here at KickApps,
and I setup the community "JoomlaCities" for hosting streaming media
and whatnot. We need to start taking advantage of this opportunity...

I was planning on doing a full edit, and there was a request for a
bass solo intro ;-)

We now have a section for Reviews of books and extensions on JoomlaNYC.org.

Scott Wolpow has written a review of Joomla Web Security:

http://joomlanyc.org/resources/reviews/book-reviews/136-joomla-web-security

Thanks, Scott!

Please submit your reviews to my email for now, until I get a submission for set up.

Thanks Donna for doing such a great job with the JoomlaNYC site, and
thanks Scott for kicking off the book reviews!

Here's some other books we have for review:

"Building Websites with Joomla! 1.5" by Hagen Graf
"Object-Oriented Programming With PHP5" by Hasin Hayder

I actually have more books to add to the list that aren't here at my
desk, I'll add them to the list when I get home. Maybe we need to put
up a list of books we have waiting for review?

I have some books that were given to me for review that are either over 
my head or written in a way that my brain just doesn't get. Which covers 
a lot of ways...

Anyone up for reading and reviewing a couple of Head First OOP books?

Message-ID: <642abf2e0901210416p122814efye488e07363b8cec1@mail.gmail.com>

I want to be able to add a feature to a Joomla web site where the visitor to
the web site can put in their zip code and have it display near-by
locations. In other words, this kind of functionality but in Joomla:
http://hosted.where2getit.com/crackerbarrel/

I'd be interested in recommendations. If you have implemented this feature
in a Joomla web site yourself, please feel free to send me the URL so show
it off.

Thanks in advance,

David Roth

That sounds interesting. Where would the "near-by locations" data be coming
from? User provided?

The webmaster would specify the street address locations.

I'm not sure if something that exists but its pretty cool and I could
implement it pretty easily.

Thank you,

If you do, it would get a lot of use. It is one of those functions as
consumers we use and see on many business web sites. Be great to have that
in Joomla.

Hello Friends,

Our site uses Zoom Media Gallery on Joomla 1.0.15.  This extension is  
not supported any longer and is a bit scary -- if you look at it the  
wrong way, it breaks. ;)

I know there are many manger gallery managers and many posts about  
them, but I am trying to figure out a migration path to a stable,  
usable solution.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?  I would  
love to be able to retain galleries with their captions and  
descriptions.  I can't imagine I'm the only ZMG user out there "stuck"  
like this.

Thanks for your help,

Kirill Sokolov

Yes and no. Yes Joomla can use any database. No because you will have to 
modify many scripts including extensions.
Why would you want to? Migrate the MSSQL to MySql then map the fields.

Are you sure you have to modify "many scripts" in 1.5?  Isn't it just the db functions?

Starting at the top your configuration file calls MySql
The syntax for mysql_connect would have to be changed on every page with 
that call, the syntax has differences.

Also the url you provided shows that the project is pretty much dead.
Another minor detail that can become major,is that MSSQL in some
variants is free but as you need more capacity and or databases it get
expensive and fast. Also you have to pay for the server licenses MSSQL
sits on.

I used blogger to create a site and use the FTP function to load to my 
server, so I have all the files.

I am trying to move off blogger because it just sucks bigtime, the FTP 
keeps failing. I also plan to revamp the site.

I have about 2000 articles.
I tried to move first to wordpress with the intention of moving to 
Joomla which is easier.
The trouble is the Import on Wordpress breaks, most likely due to the 
same FTP issue.

I really only want to take each post and convert to an articles, I do 
not need to maintain the 'blog' aspect.

The archive HTML pages for the most part are date coded by the month. 
These pages have the usual HTML and CSS tags.

They also have tags are id the post.Example below. I want to import each 
post as an article and map the classes to the correct fields in the 
Joomla DB.

Is there any tools that I can use or what would be the quickest way?
I am think about using a script that would go through each script and 
just write it to the DB.

Thanks

We talked about this before I think. AFAIK, there is no killer app for this
sort of migration.

It's funny, bc people often need/want to do this, so it seems as soon as
someone wrote the data migration script and released it, it would quickly be
improved until it was very good.

So, I guess it's up to you!

cheers,

?orest

Not Joomla but...I thought this would be a good place to start my search.

I?m looking for a company that would be able to tackle an enormous FLASH/ActionScript project. One of my clients is looking to reproduce this "Virtual Makeover" for use on their website. 
See: http://www.dailymakeover.com/makeover/virtualMakeover

Note: This is ONLY for companies based in the New York metro area.

Jeff

Subject: [joomla] forum for joomla 1.5?
Message-ID: <149197.6907.qm@web31807.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

What forum would you suggest for 1.5?
?
I am thinking of Agora, but I want to make sure that moderators receive emails when items are posted to their specific category.
?
Or, I can install phpBB forum, but I don't see a valid bridge so i can have a single login between joomla and the forum and integrate it together.? The only bridges I see are for 1.0
?
thanks,
Laura

I just installed Fireboard and it seems to work ok. With all the default 
options on, it's kind of cluttered so I disabled most of them.

It was discussed at a meeting recently that Fireboard was removed from the extensions directory because of security issues.

Oh lovely. Now I have to bang out a script to port the messages over to 
another forum. Better sooner than later, I guess.
What's your recommendation?
