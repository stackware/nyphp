Subject: [joomla] Next Joomla Users Group Meeting is October
Message-ID: <033301cea9c0$cd812150$688363f0$@com>

Hi Everyone,  

We will not be having our regular monthly group meeting in September because

hosts at Touro College

Our next regular meeting will be 
Wednesday October 16, 2013
( Our normal 3rd Wednesday of the month ) 

  _____

learn all of the key concepts you need to understand, navigate and use a
Joomla site.
*	Day 2, Tuesday September 16, 2013 is for people who have completed
Day 1 or have some Joomla experience. You'll learn how to build and maintain

Registration and course details on the OSTraining website
<https://www.ostraining.com/classroom/class/97-new-york-joomla-training-09-1

A note from me, Stewart Newfeld.  These courses are taught by local Joomla
Developer and excellent Joomla instructor Laura Gordon.  If you want to get
started with Joomla or are a beginning to intermediate Joomla user, these
courses are a great way to learn.  If you are a Joomla professional, do what
I do - recommend these courses to your clients who want to add content to
their websites themselves.  Some will succeed in mastering the basics, and
anyone who takes the course will more fully appreciate why it is they are
paying you to maintain their website.

 

Stewart Newfeld, President

New York City Joomla Users Group (NYCJUG)
Meetings 6-9PM every 3rd Wednesday of the Month ( but not September 2013)

Subject: [joomla] Bootstrap Joostrap
Message-ID: <CAAUuzMR9pFogwe-2fvOoWYFs4KRaB+1FQnvsyqoesSL4Np=8EA@mail.gmail.com>

Folks

I'm really enjoying what I can do with the Bootstrap framework, which has a
really vibrant community constantly building it further. Great responsive
features and what I really like is that the code is clean and works well. I
use Philip Locke's Joostrap template, a nice adaptation which includes the
isotope page layouts.

   I'm happy to do a demo for the group if people are interested.
Meanwhile, here's a list of resources I put together at
http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap people may find helpful

YABRL Yet Another Bootstrap Resource
List<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap/26-yabrl-yet-another-bootstrap-resource-list>

My opinionated take on what helps build bootstrap websites. I've actually
tried almost all of them and used several in production. A few favorites,
not a huge list. GetBootstrap the
Fountainhead<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#getbootstrap>
  Bootply Visual
Editor<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#Bootply>
 Bootstrap Free Themes, Many Colors
<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#Bootswatch>
 Free Themes, Many
Layouts<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#startbootstrap>
 WrapBootstrap Themes
<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#Wrapbootstrap>
 A Lightbox <http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#lightbox>
  Rich-Featured
Gallery <http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#gallery>  Cool
Google Card template<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#bootplus>
  Bootstrap for
Joomla<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#Joostrap>
 Free CDN Speedup<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#BootstrapCDN>
 Photoshop Bootstrap
samples<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#Bentdesign>
 Free CDN Speedup<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#BootstrapCDN>
 Short Tutorials<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#w3resource>

If this isn't enough, see  Far More
Resources<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#resources>

The Fountainhead: GetBootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>

Where creators Matt Otto and Jacob Thornton provide the code, show you what
it can do, and offer some of the best concise documentation of any project.
The only thing missing is a forum comparable to the one at Joomla.org. The
"customize" feature saves petabytes across the web. Worth reading three or
four times if you use Bootstrap. One tip: I couldn't find where to download
the advanced templates. They are all in the single package in a
subdirectory when you download the whole package. http://getbootstrap.com
Visual Editor and Playground:
Bootply<http://developinginpublic.com/%20http:/bootply.com>


Darn fast drag-n-drop editor and excellent resource files. A pleasure.
http://bootply.com <http://bootply.com/>
Free Themes for Bootstrap: Bootswatch <http://bootswatch.com/>

More than a dozen free Bootstrap thems, all displayed on the home page.
Strong on giving you different color choices. Jennie thought Flatly,
Journal and perhaps Slate were the better ones. Cyborg is black and
striking but perhaps a bit much. United uses very bright Ubuntu Orange.
Host Thomas Park recommends a few paid templates as well, including Front
Row at Wrapbootstrap. http://bootswatch.com/
<http://bootswatch.com/><http://bootswatch.com/>
More Free Themes: Start Bootstrap

Loads of different layouts with sliders, half-sliders, multiple column
layouts ... http://startbootstrap.com/
300 Themes for $4 to $25:
Wrap<http://developinginpublic.com/index.php/bootstrap#>
B <http://developinginpublic.com/%20http:/bootply.com>ootstrap<http://developinginpublic.com/wrapbootstrap.com>


Nice one page themes for $4. Plenty of others for less than $25. Definitely
worth a look.   https://wrapbootstrap.com/
Bootstrap for Joomla: Joostrap <http://www.joostrap.com/>

Phil, a Joomla veteran, sells a fine version of Bootstrap for Joomla for
?16.99. He delivered Joostrap 3 within a week after Bootstrap 3 shipped.
With ?34.99 or  ?74.99 subscriptions, you get several full-featured
templates and extensions. The support has been good and worth paying for.
He helps out on issues that most template vendors would say "not my
problem." http://www.joostrap.com
Clean, Easy Lightbox: Bootstrap Lightbox

Does just what it should
http://jbutz.github.io/bootstrap-lightbox/<http://jbutz.github.io/bootstrap-lightbox/>

A Full-Featured Gallery for Pictures and Video: Blueimp

Sebastian Tschan is recommending this, an updated version, rather than his
earlier "Bootstrap Image Gallery." Looks good, but I haven't tested it yet.
https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery/blob/master/README.md
That Cool Google+ Card Interface: Bootplus

  Marcello Palmitessa has added classes to replicate the "cardstyle" layout
made famous by Google+. I love it. http://aozora.github.io/bootplus

 Incredibly Easy, Free Way to Speed Your Site: Bootstrap CDN

They cache the Bootstrap files and icons areound the globe. Your customer
gets them in much less time. Provided free by MaxCDN to give you a taste of
their service. The paid service <http://www.maxcdn.com/>looks interesting
as well: $9/month will speed up 10,000+ visitors to most websites. Speed
thrills.  http://www.bootstrapcdn.com
The Photoshop Templates: BentDesign & Designshock

All the Bootstrap interface elements as Photoshop vectors. Ideal for
mockups and comps
http://www.bentdesignstudio.com/v2/2012/03/twitter-bootstrap-2-photoshop-template-psd/<http://www.bentdesignstudio.com/v2/2012/03/twitter-bootstrap-2-photoshop-template-psd/>

Bootstrap 3 elements in a remarkable six foot poster. You must have enough
memory to use this, but everything's there. Annoying signupat bottom of
long page. http://www.designshock.com/bootstrap-3-psd/
Short Tutorials on Every Feature: W3Resource

Neither deep nor eloquent but generally right to the point. Whether it's
"pills & tabs" or "popovers," there's a page with the basics of what you
need to know. So convenient I added it to my Bootstrap bookmarks. From
Bengladesh http://www.w3resource.com/twitter-bootstrap/tutorial.php
Far More Resources

Many thanks to these much more comprehensive resource lists

Big Badass List<http://bootstraphero.com/the-big-badass-list-of-twitter-bootstrap-resources>
Just
about everything. Well done, and check his OptimizationRobot while you're
there. Slews of stuff for Wordpress, php, Ruby and others I'm not qualified
to rate.

Bootsnip <http://bootsnipp.com/resources> Very well organized with clear
descriptions.

Speckyboy <http://speckyboy.com/2013/05/01/bootstrap-toolbox/> Good
organization if you're looking for programmer tools.

Hello everyone,

 

Can the group members suggest video production software for the web/Joomla.
I have a customer that wants his own produced video on his website and
youtube.

Our guys at OSTraining swear by Screenflow.

The only disadvantage is that it's for Macs only.

NEW! New Jersey Users Group
Two former board members of the New York City Joomla Users Group, Laura
Gordon and Marion Konop, have just started the New Jersey Joomla Users
Group.  You are invited to their first meeting on Tuesday October 29th at
7pm
Union Township Chamber of Commerce
355 Chestnut Street, 2nd FloorUnion, NJ 07083

For more information: http://joomlausersnj.com/
<http://joomlanyc.org/%20http:/joomlausersnj.com/>   and
http://www.meetup.com/Joomla-Users-Group-of-New-Jersey/

 

And finally, we have switch from Wednesdays to Thursdays for our upcoming
NYC User Group Meetings

Upcoming NY Joomla User Group Meetings

For the Fall Semester Touro College is once again kindly providing the NYC
Joomla Users Group with facilities for our once-monthly meetings.  But this
semester we'll be meeting on Thursday nights and not Wednesdays as
previously.

Our next regular meeting will be 
Thursday October 17, 2013

The next two meetings after that will be:
Thursday October 21, 2013
Thursday November 19, 2013


Location:
Touro College ( ... more about Touro College
<http://joomlanyc.org/index.php/events/touro-college-our-meetings-host> )
Graduate School of Business
65 Broadway, Room 224 (map  <http://www.touro.edu/gsb/contact.html> )
between Rector & Exchange Place
New York, NY 10006

Chairperson: Stewart Newfeld
6:00 - 6:15 - Introductions and Miscellaneous Business
6:15 - 8:00 - PRESENTATION #1:  Normally, only Superusers can login into a
Joomla site that is taken offline.  Stewart Newfeld will show how easy it is
to assign "offline access permission" to selected non-superusers and
customize the Site Offline Logo.  This lets you stage a site and keep it
away from the public until you are ready to launch it, or to create a site
to function as an intranet site.  In addition, Stewart will explain how to
make different menu items available to different groups of users.  An
example would be to create items only accessible to an organization's Board
Members, or to stage additions to a webiste that only a few people can see
while it is undergoing development and before the material is approved to go
public. The techniques demonstrate apply equally to Joomla 2.5 and 3.x

PRESENTATION#2: Creating interactive forms fill-in forms like an IRS 1040
Tax Form, that can be downloaded from your website, is an often requested
website feature.  We'll have a quick demonstration of how suprisingly easy
this is to accomplish with Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat.


8:00-8:30 Lightening Round Question and Answers, Networking.

 

Stewart Newfeld, President

New York City Joomla Users Group (NYCJUG)
Meetings 6-8:30 PM every 3rd Thursday of the Month

Hey, Stewart. Typical of me -- pointing out something minor.

However, according to your message, there is a meeting on Th Oct 17, and
the next ones after that is on Th Oct 21 and Th Nov 19. I think you need to
add a month to the last two to make them land on Thursdays -- Th Nov 21 and
Th Dec 19.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla Database - Published vs Unpublished vs Expired
Message-ID: <CAOt=950i6oj+=5XdWgA5UT2=yOofD=d9U2KNopDKboPevb=j+A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm creating articles in Joomla 2.5.4  and the setting the "Finished
Publishing" date.  Once that date has past, In the admin section the
article has a red x and says "publishing expired".

I'm doing some manual pulls from the sql db, with the conditional "state
=1" to show all published articles and to Hide the expired articles.  i
thought the state=1 is published, state =0 is the unpublished, state = -2
is trashed.

However when the article is expired (past the finished publishing date),
the state still shows as 1 in the database, so my custom module is still
showing the expired article, but the link to the actual article is not
valid.

Any ideas how I can identify from the database when an article is expired?
 I'm wondering why the state still shows as "1" for expired articles.

thanks in advance.

Todd

I've seen a similar thing when the time zone was wrong on my server - if an
article was set to publish in the future, it would be published, but
"pending," and a list of published articles would still show it.

It's likely your SQL pull should also filter on the date, so that results
with a Finished Publishing Date in the past are filtered out.

I see a field in (prefix)_content called "publish_down" - I don't have
anything that expires, but check that for your SQL filter.

It still shows as state = 1 because you did not change the state.

There is no process that goes through the database every x hours and unpublishes expired articles.? An article can be both published and expired.

The publish_down column is the finish publishing date.

Thanks all, I had a feeling that was the case...

Subject: [joomla] Google SERP Results
Message-ID: <EA851AF666FA45218C945F1951EB1AB0@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone!

 

I have removed/deleted the old menus and reprogrammed from scratch new ones
I?m still getting these bogus SERP links from google. I deleted the sitemap
and installed the latest in my root folder. I went to google webmaster tools
and deleted the old sitemap and installed the new version. And still no
change ? I have no idea where the below menu links are coming from.

 

 

I enter unitel.biz in the google search bar and I get the following serp
links;

 

1.	www.unitel.biz/15-products <-- menu item ?/15-products does not
exist. 
2.	http://www.unitel.biz/component/content/?view=featured < this page
does not exist ? and it never did exist.
3.
http://www.unitel.biz/25-products/telephone-systems/index.php?option=com_con
tent&view=article&id=15:nec-sl1100&catid=25:nec-sl1100&Itemid=432 <-- does
not exist.

 

Any idea what?s happening?

 


If I click on : unitel.biz - | Business Phone System - VoIP IP PBX - IP
Phones - SIP ...
www.unitel.biz/?


 

The site opens and no problem. Every menu item is the way it should be ?
works fine.

 

:-(

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Subject: [joomla] Moving Domain from localhost to live Domain
Message-ID: <69C3327C168941DE8EE796D5B1D75739@OwnerPC>


Excerpt from Joomla documentation.


Have you moved domains?


Sometimes if you have changed domains (for example from a localhost or test
environment to the live domain) you will need to edit the value for the
$live_site variable in the configuration.php file found in the root
directory of your Joomla site files. The value of the variable must be
manually edited; it cannot be accessed via the Global Configuration screens.


Typically, it would look like: 

var $live_site = 'http://example.com';

Or, if you access your website in a sub-folder called joomla, it would be
like this: 

var $live_site = 'http://example.com/joomla';

When you move domains, this value may need updating to reflect your new
domain name: 

var $live_site = 'http://mynewdomain.com';

 

 

Is this something that has to be done?

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Hi all,

importer will work for joomla 3.1.  Note this version will not work for
