Like Anthony, I have had problems with 1 and 1 doing whatever they could 
to prevent me from changing registrars.

Here's what happened.  When I tried to change registrars on one of my 
domains, they closed my account.  The technical and admin email 
addresses were on that domain, so I couldn't receive email.  In order 
for my new registrar to make the change, they needed me to confirm it 
via email.  I couldn't get the email, and the change was held up for 
about a month.  In the meantime, I couldn't use the web site because the 
account was closed, and I wasn't receiving any email.  I called them 
many times.  Yes, they usually answered the phone quickly, but every 
time I called for status they had an excuse, saying that their transfer 
department was working on it, and that I would receive a callback with 
status within 24 hours.  They never called back.  One time I got one of 
them to give me his extension.  When I called it, it was a non-existent 
number.  And they would never transfer me to their transfer department.  
I finally opened a new account using the same name, just so I could 
change the email addresses registered with the domain.  Now they keep 
sending me billing notices for $3.86 for the few days the account was 
re-opened.  I would definitely stay away from them.

Bill
