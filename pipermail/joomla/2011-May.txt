Subject: [joomla] Stallage
Message-ID: <4DC0679A.4020509@gmail.com>

>From 1000 feet overhead, it seems both Drupal and Joomla have suffered
some stallage in progress lately.

They both appear to have raced to release their next versions[Joomla!
1.6 and Drupal 7] after years of delay.  The long delay had turned off a
lot of 3rd party developers who initially tried to provide alpha
versions of their software for the next version, but then gave up when
the API's kept changing radically.

Both projects made some major last minute changes to some "under the
covers" API's that 'almost no one uses'.  Unfortunately, almost everyone
DID use them in the form of a 2 or 3 very popular modules/components. 
So now both CMS's are lacking those 2 or 3 very popular components
because the concers of the component devs were brushed off when they
raised the issues, and the component devs aren't willing to take the hit
for problems that are caused by core code but will only appear in their
components.

It also seems that in Joomla's case, core Developers screwed the pooch
by dismissing concerns of Developers because those Dev's 'didn't do
much' and it turned out that those Devs were the ones who did all the
documentation.  So in 1.6 your left with a beautiful API and very little
in how to use because no one is documenting.

In both cases, it seems the core teams are now going on towards the "fun
stuff", ie Joomla 1.7 and Drupal 8, while the communities are
floundering and fragmenting.  Drupal seems to be recovering a little
faster due to at least having semi decent documentation.

Am I completely off base here?

Subject: [joomla] need download tool for 1.6
Message-ID: <BANLkTikRqdsFpLU8Soadp7GoA+M7CKEtSQ@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

Has anyone found a tool similar to docman for joomla 1.6?

I installed phoca downloads, but none of the plugins or modules actually
work for it in 1.6, only the component...which makes it hard to actually
integrate into the system.

Then I tried Akeeba release system...and that doesn't work properly either
(I'm getting a "Class 'JParameter' not found" error)

Any ideas?  I have 2 basic joomla sites and the clients wanted 1.6, which is
fine except this is a HUGE hole!

i guess I can have them just uplad pdf documents, and manually create links
to them in the system...which is fine, but it will be difficult for my
client to manage.

thanks,
Laura

That is interesting.  Apparently this "feature" was removed from the
content component.

http://www.joomdaddy.com/programming-tricks/joomla-1-6-redirect-to-login-instead-of-no-authorization-message/

Between 1.6.1 and 1.6.3 they removed the option.

The easy answer is to replace lines 104-111 with the code in that article.

The downside is that means you need to replace them everytime you
upgrade the core.

A better answer would be to create a system plugin to run before the
view and check the access when loading content pages and redirect if you
want.

Hi everyone,

I'm pretty new to Joomla, went to the April meetup, but couldn't make the
May one.  I'm having a small problem with the application load time, memory
usage, and queries logged showing at the bottom of my pages, including on
the admin login page.  I just signed up with ostraining for Joomla, but they
haven't covered this yet.  Is there a simple fix?  Probably something right
under my nose right?  lol

Thanks in advance,

Hi Thad,

Could provide a URL?

The symtoms you describe could be many things. It is much easier to fix the
problem if we could see it.

Sounds like it could be a template coding issue. Are you using a commercial
template or one you made yourself? It could also be a database problem. Did
you create this site on your local computer and transfer it to a shared
host?

Hi Steve,

Thanks for the fast reply!  I actually fixed this part just a few minutes
ago - it was the debugging that was turned on.  Once I turned that off it
was all set.  However, I do think the template that I'm using is buggy.
Every time I try to make a change in my articles, in this case showing or
hiding the title, email/print icons etc., when I make those changes in the
menu manager, it doesn't change, but if I do them in the article manager, it
does, but only sometimes.  It's very strange. On the main page (Home link on
menu), I hid the everything via article manager, and it worked, but then
when I tried to unhide the title, it does not work,

The url is http://thefinancefixer.com/joomla

The current template is a free one, and I started the site on the actual
host, not my local machine.

Thanks in advance,
Thad

So it turns out, that those changes that it didn't look like were working,
actually do work.  It just takes about 20 - 30 minutes for them to change on
the site.  Is this normal?  Is there something I can do to optimize that? I
called the server company to find out if there were bandwidth issues, but
they said that everything was fine.

Thanks,
Thad

Subject: [joomla] trying to determine what extensions I will need
Message-ID: <BANLkTimSbrS9BjWdiehXvz-VLAyz00sy_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am looking for some guidance and direction from those of you who are more
experienced. I have a list of requirements for a website and I am trying to
determine what extensions I will need to accomplish all this. I am not
intimately familiar with all the necessary components so I am not sure if
some overlap in functionality and if they ?play nicely? together. These are
the requirements and the extensions I am considering using. I am open to
suggestions if you think another extension is more appropriate or if one is
unnecessary because it is redundant.I will probably be using use 1.5,
because I know I will need help and will find more answers in Forums for 1.5
than 1.6.

SOBI2 or Mosets Tree

?         Promote small business?s service and products through a directory

?         Have multi-level membership

o        free for a basic listing

o        fee for higher tiers, which would allow them to 'talk' with other
members; barter with other members; higher tiers of advertising benefits
(better listing by industry, logo, video) ratings; articles about them.

?         Showcase featured businesses

AEC Subscription manager

?         Payment with automated monthly subscriptions

iJoomla Ad Agency

?         Banner advertisements

JComments

?         Have an Ask the Expert area?Select ?Experts? would have a Bio page
where visitors can ask questions; expert can answer; can archive; visible to
public.

JomSocial or Community Builder

?         Have members able to interact with each other ? members have a
Profile; can ?poke? others; post comments; network; barter; share etc.

JEvents

?         List events; webinars, seminars, expos, conferences

DTRegister

?         Have members able to sign up for the events and pay

Am I missing something? Will all these extensions cover all the
requirements?Will the login/registration/users/members be in one place or
will each component require it's own login/registration/user? Is there a way
around this?

I appreciate any advise you can give me.

Thanks,

Ellen

I have a Joomla site (not live yet) set up with Janrain login.? http://www.janrain.com/products/engage/social-login

Users can login to the Joomla site with their Facebook, Twitter, AOL, Yahoo, Gmail or LinkedIn account.

I think this would make it much easier for users to join the site and participate in the site.? But I'm wondering what the downsides might be.

How is that different from a user creating multiple Joomla accounts with different email addresses?

Once you sign in with one social network it remembers which one you used and presents it to you as the first option.

It is the same as having a Joomla Core account. Except rather than 
checking core, it checks elsewhere.

I'd be interested in knowing how does Janrain actually work especially WRT
the long-term viability of this approach.

IE, Let's say I have a site with 5000 users who have used Janrain to sign up
(using a mix of fb, twitter, gmail etc.) and Janrain goes out of business,
gets acquired, whatever.

What happens to the user accounts, do they have to sign up again, or does it
just create local accounts with passwords and an email address?

It seems there would be a trade off between usability and lock-in, and I'm
just not clear on how Janrain works.

cheers,

fm

Joomla user accounts are created but some social networks won't give you the users' email address.? This would be the case if you use the Facebook Connect with or without Janrain.

If you weren't using Janrain, you can use the various social network's API to create the same plugin.

I'd be interested in knowing how does Janrain actually work especially WRT the long-term viability of this approach. 

IE, Let's say I have a site with 5000 users who have used Janrain to sign up (using a mix of fb, twitter, gmail etc.) and Janrain goes out of business, gets acquired, whatever. 

What happens to the user accounts, do they have to sign up again, or does it just create local accounts with passwords and an email address? 

It seems there would be a trade off between usability and lock-in, and I'm just not clear on how Janrain works. 

cheers,

Hi. 

in my plugin I am currently trying to add some javascript to the end of a page. 

before the </html> tag. 

Is there a joomla way to do this? 

ideally like

         $document =& JFactory::getDocument();
         $document->addCustomTag($script);

but maybe 

        $document->addCustomTagFooter($script);

thanks in advance. 

Chris

Actually, Facebook will give you the email address if the user
authorizes it. 
http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/  You
have to request the "email" permission.

In Janrain you need to have the Pro package[1000/year] and you can then
map multiple social networks to the users profile, and then map the
janrain profile fields to your internal profile fields.   If Janrain
goes out of business, then you will either need to reset the password[by
sending it to an email address, or even as an internal social network
message to one of the mapped social network accounts], or implement an
authentication package to re-authenticate those accounts.

The nerd in me says I'd rather implement it myself.  But if I never get
back to updating/maintenance in a year it will be out of date, wheras
Janrain will keep updating.

On the other hand, with time on my hands this summer, and seeing pricing
of 1000/year for a single domain to use Janrain, maybe I should
implement it myself with a Rest interface and then try to resell it. :-)

Subject: [joomla] Wrapping a span tag to a module title
Message-ID: <BANLkTikSnnbHWFHgcXkrW6OHdmoHn=W_Og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

I saw this template where the first part of the title is wrapped in a span
tag.

When I check the code with Firebug I see this:

<div class="module-title-surround">
  <div class="module-title">
    <div class="module-title2">
      <div class="module-title3">
        <h2 class="title" style="visibility:
visible;"><span>Atletas</span> em destaque</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>	

I tried to copy the template module.php to my template's HTML folder, but
nothing happened.

How can I accomplish that?

Thanks

Subject: [joomla] question on search
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=ezODZVc6iaZXYpBy-wzx_xEPwWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Sorry to bother you, but I have a troubling question, one that seems so
obvious it is killing me...

site: http://www.nassaulibrary.com/syossetnew (still being developed)

My client wants the search to actually search via the menu item names...

for example:

If in the search you put: Staff Picks

She wants the Staff Picks menu item to show up in the search results...

I am using: mysite for a site map...

any ideas?

thanks,
Laura

The simplest way would be to make sure the menu item and page titles match.
