>From October onwards, out meeting date is now the second thursday of 
the month.

Date:
October 11th
6PM to 8PM

Location:
Robert Half Technology
245 Park Avenue, 25th Fl.
46th - 47th St.
(near grand central)

We have room for 50 people. People will need to RSVP in advance so we 
have a list for security, and you will need some form of photo id onhand 
for security.

We will be setting up a website and an RSVP form over the weekend, for 
now you can simply email me your RSVP and I'll manually add you to the list.

Schedule:
Our last meeting was a long presentation about Joomla in general. So 
this time around, I'd like to aim to have a number of quick 
presentations and we can alternate meetings going forward(big 
presentations followed by short presentations, etc). We will aim for 4 
small presentations, with the first 2 being geared for a more user 
level, and the last 2 for developers. Anyone who willing to do a short 
15-20 minute presentation, please contact me.

Therefore, our schedule will be:
Session 1: 6:00-6:20 - Community Builder, what it is and what it is not
Session 2: 6:20-6:40

JUG/SIG Planning: 6:45-7:15.
To discuss: Community Website plans and needs
Community Projects

Session 3: 7:20-7:40
Session 4: 7:40-8:00


Presentations:
At the last meeting, I noticed some discussions on building a 
"community" website, and the component that get's mentioned frequently 
is Community Builder. Community Builder, by itself, doesn't provide 
much in the way of "community" features, but it is a strong basis for 
such websites. So I'd like to do a brief review of the features of CB 
to begin with, along with thoughts on what it allows you to do as far as 
community websites are concerned.

If there is interest in it, after the meeting those who don't need to 
rush home could go over to TGIF's (or suggest an alternate?) to hang out 
for a bit.

The nearest one seems to be:
47 East 42nd Street
http://tgifridays.know-where.com/tgifridays/cgi/site?01606

After all, not having run a meeting before, I believe I made a mistake 
and owe Mitch a beer for being kind enough to do our first 
presentation(and yes, I suppose the offer extends to anyone presenting 
at the next meeting. :-))

Let me know what the level of interest is and if it is large enough we 
can make sure to get a reservation(and if any of you NY natives have a 
suggestion for someplace better, feel free to speak up!)

I have some experience with this as I helped setup www.nnjastd.org (drupal version due oct07). There is also a good article by Ohio State http://webgarden.osu.edu/buckeye2007.pdf They used Joomla to build up their community site.

A forum(fireboard?) -YES
A notification list(yanc?) - YES
An event calendar(???) - YES
An RSVP system for signing up for meetings(???) -YES
A PMS system of some sort - Don't these things bug out on a monthly basis? ;P

Mos Def put some tutorials up or at least some good feeds.
How bout job postings and member dir for prof networking?
Maybe a cart for purchasing training events even if $0 (be nice to have some free training events hosted by volunteers). I'm biased to training b/c I'm in eLearning.

speaking of which Colin Moock is giving a FREE, that's right FREE training on AS3 http://www.adobeas3tour.com/

Today's Topics:

1. Joomla SIG website features (bz-gmort at beezifies.com)

Subject: [joomla] Joomla SIG website features
To: NYPHP SIG: Joomla 
Message-ID: <46FCFBED.3040103 at beezifies.com>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed

We're setting up a website for the Joomla SIG, I was wondering what 
features people would like to see, and what components they like for 
those features?

Off the top of my head, we should have:
A forum(fireboard?)
A notification list(yanc?)
An event calendar(???)
An RSVP system for signing up for meetings(???)
A PMS system of some sort

Whatever we use should work under legacy mode on 1.5 at the least, and 
perhaps for our first few projects if we use GPL components we could 
upgrade them to the 1.5 model.


So any thoughts on the best/simplest modules to meet these needs?

If you do a presentation on Community Builder, don't you need as well:
CBJuice: a great product to import user records into community builder
JACL Plus: I think that is it, to actually work with groups, etc. 

At another section you may want to focus on shopping carts, such as VirtueMart, which is fantastic!

Maybe, but they have an online website which has a simple locator. :-)

If you know the Grand Central area and want to suggest an Alternate, I'm

Presentations should be short, 15-20 minutes, to give people some

Presentations should be short, 15-20 minutes, to give people some 
ideas/thoughts/insights.

If you can't make this meeting but will be coming to future meetings and 
are willing to present, feel free to let me know so I can work out the 
scheduling. Also let me know if you prefer to do a short presentation 
or a long(an hour or so) presentation as we will alternate formats.

LOL, in fact I asked a couple of local friends yesterday for suggestions 
and one of them mentioned it was a very nice place he highly 
recommended.  Than he mentioned that when he went there for a friends 
party he found out about their dress code because he was wearing a 
t-shirt and had to buy a shirt before he could enter.

My guess was that of those interested in going, the majority won't want 
to adhere to such a requirement. :-)

I'm at a place where, uh, the dress code is, uh, relaxed. Like "purple
hair and facial piercings" relaxed. If I showed up in Dockers, a Polo
and some Hush Puppies, I'd never live it down. And even the best
looking mug of Guinness ain't getting me to skate Times Square to
Grand Central in that outfit.

Well, if they make something like emericas in a skate model, I might
reconsider. Until then, pfft.

Subject: [joomla] modules in mulitple positions
Message-ID: <4706940A.30908@omnistep.com>

I want to place the search module in one position (top) for the front 
page, but place it at the "right" position for other pages. Is there an 
easy way to do this? I'm thinking I could create a copy of the search 
module configure the second one for "right"  or create a copy of the 
template and and apply it to the front page (swapping out positions for 
"top" and "right") but I'm wondering if there is an easier way...??

Are you using 1.0 or 1.5?

Are you familiar with how to make collapsible modules?

Generally, a collapsible module position is used when you want modules 
blocks to disappear when they are not published for a page.

However, there are a couple of functions for Joomla that you can use to 
determine if you are on the frontpage or not.

So using those functions, you could make the the two modules appear or 
diappear(assuming they are the only modules in those positions).

IF you have multiple modules in those positions, what I would suggest is 
to use the function to set a variable in the template indicating front 
page or not.

Than just use an if/then clause to load topA/topB and rightA/rightB

Where A is where the module exists for that position, and B is where it 
is not(so you load topA/rightB or topB/rightA)

I think my template is collapsible (if there are no modules in the right 
position for that page, the main content will expand to fill the space)

What I want is for a single module (the search module) to appear at the 
right position on the front page, and at the top for all the other 
pages. As far as I know, with Joomla 1.0, you can only specify a single 
position for the module. One idea was to duplicate the module but call 
it a  different name. One would be positioned on the right (set to be 
visible only on the front page), the second module would be positioned 
on top and visible on every page other than the front.

The second idea was to duplicate the template except switch the top and 
right positions in the template, then apply that modified template to 
front page only.

Both ideas are hacks, but I think modifying a template to conditionally 
swap the top and right positions based on detection of the front page 
would be an even more extreme "hack" in that the template would be doing 
something unintuitive even by Joomla standards :)

Message-ID: <47079D9B.8010304@beezifies.com>

At the last meeting Mitch mentioned something about making copies of
some files(core Joomla files?) in a local directory and that files from
the local directory will be loaded in preference to the
originals(similiar to how Menalto Gallery works).

Unfortunately, I wasn't in the room due to being late, so I didn't catch
all that.

Can Mitch or someone chime in and mention what types of files this can
be used for and how it works?

What I ended up doing was duplicating the module like so:

went into the /modules directory
cp mod_search.php mod_search2.php
cp mod_search.xml mod_search2.xml
edited mod_search2.xml, search and replacing "mod_search" with "mod_search2"
zip mod_search2.zip mod_search2
rm mod_search2*

then through the admin interface of joomla, installed mod_search2.zip as 
a module.
This allowed me to have identically functioning search modules, one 
configured to the "top" position and one at the "right".
I configured the "top" one set to display on only the front page, and 
the "right" module displayed everywhere else.

Why not just go to Site Modules in the Admin, click the checkbox next to 
the modules, and then click "copy".

Than you will have 2 modules you can position and configure 
independently of each other that use the same code.  You can even 
configure them seperately(for example, a module that displays the latest 
articles can be configured in one instance to show 3 articles and 
another to show 10)

Making a duplicate module is the easiest solution here.

You can also create different templates for different sections of the 
site and use the template manager to assign them to different menu links.

A last minute substitution, since we have some speakers coming in from 
out of town, we will be bumping the Template presentation and replacing 
it with one on designing for Joomla 1.5

Jonah Braun from the Joomla! Security Task Force will present an 
overview of how to build a native Joomla 1.5 component using the MVC 
method.  Good practices and common pitfalls will be discussed.

FYI, this week at the Dreamweavers meeting there will be a presentation 
on open source frameworks including Joomla.

Build a PHP/MySQL based Database-Driven Website Using an Open Source 
Framework with WordPress, Joomla, ZenCart or Drupal in less than an hour 
by Consultant Stephen Britton

You can RSVP through the Dreamweavers NY website, http://dream.212917.com/

Their meeting is also hosted at Robert Half Technologies, so the same 
location for this Thursdays meeting is also used for their Wednesday 
meeting.

Message-ID: <470BA5FD.9050604@beezifies.com>

So far I have 21 RSVP's for the meeting.  We can take up to another 19 
without pushing the space, and than 10 more if we want to add in space 
at the back.

I also have around 7 interested in hanging out after the meeting.  For 
anyone familiar with bars/TGIF's in NYC I'm assuming that anything under 
a dozen should not require reservations?(especially since it's not like 
we're going for food or anything).  Mainly I'm trying to gauge how much 
interest there is to see if I need to reserve space or not(sorry, bar 
hanging out is not really my thing.  I tend to hang out at local B&N's 
or at times Starbucks in small groups.  But I figure better to arrange 
things in advance than try to figure out what to do at the time.)

I've got the name of 2 local bars from Gary B. over at Robert Half, so 
I'll check them out tomorrow before the Dreamweavers meeting and if they 
seem to have good space and such, we can go to one of them rather than 
walk a few blocks to TGIF's)

I was wondering if anyone had suggestions/comments of what the cost of 
rackspace in NYC is?

This is for a non-critical system, so network reliable must be 
relatively ok, but doesn't have to be fantastic drop dead performance 
and such.

Mainly thinking about when it comes time for my next upgrade, is it 
better to buy hardware and rent rackspace, or rent a managed server or 
something.

Well, I've been looking at that myself.  Here's what
I've found...

1. NJColocation - By the MeadowLands in NJ
 - 1U server (1,300 GB traffic) $75 per month
2. CyberCon (in NY somewhere)
 - 1U server (500 GB traffic) $150 per month


There were a few more, but they are on another
computer, so I'll try to get you more tomorrow...

Do you want to colo your own box or rent one?

For colo in the city, check out PiloSoft downtown (I have a 2U box down 
there). I think I pay $75/m.

Lately, Ive been looking at virtual server solutions (managing your own 
hardware is not stress free). Im currently testing out a basic UML-based 
virtual server from linode.com (cheapest is $20/m).

The nice thing about TGIF (and the only reason we still go there after NYPHP
general meetings) is that they typically have a lot of space around the bar,
and can generally accomodate a dozen or more at tables if that's preferred.
Some of these smaller bars, while nicer, don't take kindly to large
unexpected crowds.

Back when I was in Baltimore, it was too much trouble to try to colo a 
server(only place was difficult to get to).  But it struck me in NYC, 
there must be tons of places with excess bandwidth/rackspace one could 
se4tup a simple server with.

I had a linnode for a while, it's pretty nice but their hard drive space 
sucks.  Heck, just about all hard drive capacity is awful when you 
compare it to setting up your own system(mind you, there is a GOOD 
reason for it since they tend to go with high quality hard drives and 
such.  Wheras, if all I need is cheap and I'm willing to take the 
possible downtime, roll your own hardware has it's advantages)

Ahh, cool.

Right now it's more a question of finding out what is around.

Basically, I have to get in a dense urban mindset.  Out in suburbia, the 
idea of owning my own server and doing remote maintenance is just a 
royal PITA.  Especially as the uptime I require is a lot lower than 
industry standard(it's non mission critical).  This means I can cheap 
out on the hardware and still be fine.  The downside of cheaping out on 
the hardware is, of course, dealing with hardware failures.  Remotely 
this would be a pain, but in a place like NYC, it's a simple matter to 
swing by, pick up an HD, swap the drives, and done.

So now I want to get an idea of what the costs associated are to 
consider whether or not I want to go that route(yeah yeah, wasn't I just 
complaining last month about the headaches of setting this up?  But now 
I'm looking at AIM bots again and I'm reminded that having a system with 
large HD capacity and the ability to run daemons has it's plusses)

Check out the dedicated server specials at layeredtech.com
At ($49/mo) it's possibly cheaper than a colo and you don't have to 
spend money for the hardware.
I think if you pay one year in advance, there is an additional discount.
I've had a mail server hosted there for the past 2 1/2 years without any 
problems.

If you want to run your own server, but are not a fanatical security 
sysadmin, theplanet.com (formerly ev1servers.net, which was formerly 
rackshack.net) is a little bit more expensive, but they employ Tipping 
Point firewall, which, interestingly blocks application level attacks 
such as PHP include exploits, SQL injections, and other common 
vulnerabilities in popular apps such as PhpBB. I would not count on it 
to fully block all "0-day" exploits, but you might sleep better knowing 
that if you don't have time to immediately update PHPBB,  your machine 
less likely to get hacked overnight :)

True, but unless your web app involves file uploads you dont need much 
space. Even for a virt domain mail server (which is what Im building), 8Gb 
is more then enough since Im not storing email long term on the server 
itself anyway.

Also the ability to manage "hardware" upgrades from a web-based control 
panel is pretty neat. Im thinking the $80/m biggest linode package 
compares quite favorably to what Im running right now down at PiloSoft 
except Im spared the stress over buying hardware, building it and running 
it. I might eventually upgrade to the bigger packages if all goes well 
with my trial.

Ive ran my own servers for years and even though I spent a lot of money on 
really good, server-grade quality hardware Ive gotten tired of maintenance 
and worry.

I have a dual-proc P-II sitting in a box under my desk that cost me
roughly $10,000 back when it first came out. It originally was a
database server for a very high-traffic website. I hang on to it, as
even while it is completely useless to me now, I simply cannot throw
it away.

Not anymore - I'm happy paying someone like ServerBeach.com to walk
the hardware-treadmill while I move on to more important stuff.

Ha ha ha.

Any server I use must host 2 things:
My wife's family photo gallery
My wifes email


The only reason the photo gallery has not broken 1GB yet is because her 
digital camera is busted and she needs a new one.

As for email..........let's just say my wife likes to talk. :-)

After looking over the various suggestions...it looks like there really 
is no point in having my own hardware, the cost difference between 
dedicated and rack space is almost nothing.

I suppose if my wife get's a new digital camera and starts taking 
videos, I might need my own hardware to hit that Terabyte diskspace 
cheaply.... hmm....  Now that I think about it, she probably will be 
getting one in the next few months before the baby comes.

Id rather pay $30/yr for flickr.

Oh this is not true... Take my example... I run a Dual
Xeon 2.4Ghz server with 2GB Ram and dual 36 GB SCSI
RAID 1.  Plus I get 1.3 TB bandwidth over a 100 mbit
port.  

Now, I paid $700 for the server, and $50 per month.  

The same server would cost me AT LEAST $150 per month
(prob more like $250, but lets look at the
cheapest)...

So, after 1 year, it saves me $500.  After that, I
save $1,200 per year by using my own hardware... 
That's not a small amount...

I guess it depends on what your looking for.

If your looking at the low end, the difference between space and a low 
end server is 5-10$/month.

Then if you upgrade to the high end, the cost benefits are in owning 
rather than renting.

Tip o' the hat to you for getting that machine for $700, I don't think
I can, with that configuration. But I haven't bought intel hardware
since 1998, so you can't consider me current in "PC shopping".

I got a dual Athlon for $217/mo, and each year I retire it and upgrade
to the next biggest thing - first dual Athlons, then dual Opterons,
will most likely be 64-bit Opterons this spring when I make the
switcheroo. And it costs me nothing, as I'm turning one server on
while decommissioning the old. No way I'm getting that kind of
hardware for $700/year.

For me, the difference is I'm not physically required to deal with
making the switch, or managing hardware upgrades or maintenance. With
commodity hardware this is a bigger effort than the expensive
commercial stuff of yesteryear...

Factor in the time you spend doing it yourself, and then try to assign
a value to your time - how important it would be if you could have
spent that time doing something else. As a small business owner, that
is a critical consideration as effort/time often outweigh cost. If it
saves you time, chances are it will also allow you to make more money.

Feel free to tell me where you shop though! I got a stinky old HP
(ubuntu) workstation at home that needs replacing :-)

I'm still scared of the xeons and the context switching issues they
had in the past with certain chipsets. For some reason they really
cause havoc with postgresql, which is a fave of mine - so for me no
xeon :-)

Subject: [joomla] JoomlaDayEast and nagging session redirect question
In-Reply-To: <00b901c7d2e1$86ede280$651ba8c0@MobileZ>

Well JoomlaDayEast was pretty fun, and even informative too. Someone 
took pictures at the end not sure what they were for.
Hopefully the 2 Joomla user groups websites will be posted shortly, yes...?

Funny thing is, no one there was able to figure out the one question I 
had, involving Joomla php sessions and browser redirects. I have a 
number of Joomla 1.0.12 sites up and running and they all work fine, 
except for one of them. This one keeps generating browser errors. In 
Firefox it says it detected an infinite redirect ("in a way that can 
never be completed") while in Opera, it just says its been redirected 
and you have to click the redirect link that Opera generates. When the 
page does open it has the session ID appended to the URL like so: 
http://myjoomalsite.com/?de17e6e8. Finally, if you are on any subpage in 
the Jomla site, if you refresh the page it kicks you out to the main 
index.php.

Frustrated I blew out the whole root directory and reinstalled Joomla 
from scratch. Unfortunately it is still exhibiting all of the above 
session weirdness. I did import the old database, so one might infer 
that's where the problem is. But where? And moreover how to solve it?

I was kind of expecting the event billed as JoomlaDayEast to be a day 
for developers, but they were few and far between on Saturday. Not that 
it wasn't fun, but when you are trying to get the kinks out of something 
like this, it was just a little frustrating to have so few people there 
with any real php (or sql) experience.

If anyone on the list has some ideas on figuring this out, I would be 
very appreciative.

cheers,

Forest M.

Sounds like:
1) Your site name and the server name don't match and a cookie isn't 
getting set properly.

2) Your htaccess file is mucked up from heck and needs to be reset

3) You've got a mucked up CB config

4) You have a mucked up artiosef(or some other sef) config.  I recall 
when I moved a system with artiosef installed, I had to reconfigure it 
manually in order to get it working since it pointed to some old configs/

Kind of hard to tell which, if any, of these it is just from a problem 
description though.

Remember the webpage optimizer?  That wonderful tool
that showed you how many images (and what size) your
page had? Well, JoomlaPerformance has come out with a
new and improved version!  Completely written from
scratch, I added a few features I though were
completely lacking from the origional...  One of which
is benchmarking the server (not just the HTML)!  It
also gives you the true time it took to complete each
request (just as a user would experience).  No more
poor estimates of download times... Check out the
Performance Grader at Joomla Performance.com (it's
under tools), or at 
http://www.joomlaperformance.com/component/option,com_performance/Itemid,52/

Our next meeting will be November 8th, the second Thursday in November.
Meeting location is Robert Half Technology, right next to Grand Central
Meeting time will be 6:00 to 8:15.

All JUG meetings are free and open to the public.  RSVP's are required

The first half hour will be set aside to talk about what Joomla is,
what it can be used for, demonstrations of a Joomla site, and a question 
and answer session for anyone struggling with Joomla.

NYC JUG Demo site(s) - we will be providing one or more sandbox joomla
setups where people who attend the meetings can log on to a demo site
and try our various aspects of Joomla, template design, component
installations, etc.

Subject: [joomla] JUG library
Message-ID: <4715FB1C.8080401@beezifies.com>

Would anyone be interested in a NYC JUG library?

The condition of usage would be to review the book, so I can bring books 
from the JUG library(if their hardcopy) to the meetings for people to 
pick up who are interested in reviewing the book, you can take them home 
with you and review the book, and when your done either bring it to the 
next meeting to drop off, mail it back to me, or mail it to the next 
person on the list who wants it.

To start with, I have a few Joomla books from Packt Publishing that I'm 
done with and can donate, and if there is interest I can get review 
copies of books from both the Packt and O'Reilly UG support networks.

Message-ID: <47160EBA.4010900@beezifies.com>

I just received an email announcement that Paypal will be holding 2 
developer day presentations(9AM to 5PM) in New York.

One in Brooklyn on November 8th, and one in Manhattan on November 9th.

It's a free all day presentation, plus you can take their 
"certification" exam for free at the event(whatever that means).

I don't have a direct link to the event(or rather, my direct link 
emailed to me is tied to my Paypal account)  so if your interested you 
will need to sign up for their developer network and than look for the 
announcement on their site.

Subject: [joomla] $5 securid authentication hack
Message-ID: <47161B4C.1030505@omnistep.com>

At the Joomla Day during the security breakout session, the discussion 
drifted towards various methods of login authentication. The topic of 
SecurId was mentioned as being an expensive alternative. I just noticed 
today that Paypal is offering a SecurId keychain fob for $5. It would be 
simple to write a small php authentication function which acted as a 
proxy to paypal, accepting an email, password, and securId code, sending 
a off a https request, parsing the response and returning an TRUE or 
FALSE authenticated result.

One caveat:  if your website security is compromised, any paypal 
information submitted could be divulged, so if you plan to test this in 
an insecure environment, it's best for users to open up a new unfunded 
paypal account not linked to any bank.

I'll post some sample code when my Paypal securId arrives in the mail :)

I've been using that for a while... I wouldn't use
that for remote auth on a site tho (outside of
paypal)... What I could see happening, is using one of
them against a remote auth server (not tied to paypal.
 So you enter your username, and the output of the
fob.  Then, it sends that to the remote server, which
tests and auths the user...  Single Sign On at its
best (and secure)...

As an alternate method of doing security, you could use the SecurID and 
perform a payment process to verify the logon.

IE, someone goes to your website and clicks on a Secure Logon link.

Your site directs them over to make a Paypal "purchase" of 1 cent.

They logon to Paypal, using their userd, password, and secureid 
keychain(if they so desire).

The payment is processed and Paypal returns them to your website.
You verify the payment and grab their paypal account email address to 
verify the account they are logging into.

The downside of this is every logon costs a few cents(the 1 cent fee, 
plus Paypal minimum fees on you).

The upside is that even if your website is completely compromised, the 
only paypal id that is compromised is the one used to accept payments. 
All the other logons occur on Paypal's site so you never capture userids 
or passwords(well, ok, you capture userids since paypal uses the email 
address.  But you won't get their passwords.)

Subject: $5 securid authentication hack

At the Joomla Day during the security breakout session, the discussion 
drifted towards various methods of login authentication. The topic of 
SecurId was mentioned as being an expensive alternative. I just noticed 
today that Paypal is offering a SecurId keychain fob for $5. It would be 
simple to write a small php authentication function which acted as a 
proxy to paypal, accepting an email, password, and securId code, sending 
a off a https request, parsing the response and returning an TRUE or 
FALSE authenticated result.

One caveat:  if your website security is compromised, any paypal 
information submitted could be divulged, so if you plan to test this in 
an insecure environment, it's best for users to open up a new unfunded 
paypal account not linked to any bank.

I'll post some sample code when my Paypal securId arrives in the mail :)

If I saw this on a site, I would laugh, and close the
browser... I'm not inputing PayPal info into a 3pd
website... What I am sugesting is creating a SSO
website, where you order a "Fob", and it has the
API... So you log in to that site (without a
password), and it authenticates you against that
remote SSO server...

This hack was not meant to be widely adopted, but instead a cheap proof 
of concept (emphasis on "cheap") possibly providing an added level of 2

You should check out the templates in the Joomla 1.5 template contest.
They are all required to be GPL compatible, and there are several
black-and-orange designs that are quite, er, halloweeny.

I just received an email announcement that Paypal will be holding 2 
developer day presentations(9AM to 5PM) in New York.

One in Brooklyn on November 8th, and one in Manhattan on November 9th.

It's a free all day presentation, plus you can take their 
"certification" exam for free at the event(whatever that means).

I don't have a direct link to the event(or rather, my direct link 
emailed to me is tied to my Paypal account)  so if your interested you 
will need to sign up for their developer network and than look for the 
announcement on their site.

http://www.joomlanyc.org/index.php?option=com_contact&task=view&contact_id=1&Itemid=11

Or just send me an email.

Even if your just thinking about going but aren't sure, RSVP and let me 
know so I can add you to the security list.

I'll make sure to send out an email next week to get a firmer number(and 
assuming we're not over the room limit, I won't drop anyone who RSVP's 
from the list so if you turn out to have free time, you can go ahead and 
show up).

As usual, meetings are free and open to the public.

First off, for those of you who tried to register with AOL addresses, 
there is a problem with AOL and mail can't reach there so accounts can't 
be activated.

If you send me an email with your preferred address, I will change your 
email address from AOL to a non-AOL one so you can activate your account.


Secondly, I've added 2 new sections to the site.

Sponsors - lists the groups and publishers helping us out.  Of primary 
interest is the publishers, Apress, O'Reilly, and Packt.  If ordering 
directly through their sites, you can use member codes to get an 
additional discount(I'll be adding those codes up as soon as I can).

Reviews - this section is half implemented.  Right now I have SOBI2 
configured with the appropriate fields so members can add books to the 
list of interested books.  I'll be configuring a review section so 
members can review the books(I will also be noting which books are in 
the NYC JUG library, those books I'll bring to the meeting and if anyone 
wants to borrow them untill the next meeting, you can bring it back, 
mail it back to me, or mail it on to the next interested party.  In 
order to borrow a book you must:
1) Sign up for an account on the site
2) Show up at a meeting in person(:-))
3) You can borrow 1 book at a time(2 books as the library grows or there 
is not enough interest for the first half dozen of books I bring)
4) You must post a review of the book to our website! Our access to 
books for the library is dependent on posting reviews.  Note: it does 
not have to be a good review, if you don't find a book usefull say so!

Feel free to add books to the list of books up there that may be of 
interest to Joomla developers and review them if you have them.  I will 
do my best to get copies of the books for the library.

Well, adding a review module for SOBI was painless.

Ok, so now everything is in place, feel free to review and rate books, 
add new books, etc.

I've got to pick up the first shipment of books later today and then I 
can go ahead and update the database.

In the meantime, let me know if there are any problems extending the 
database.

GigCal....
I'm not especially thrilled with it out of the box, but it does have a 
lot of functions I can modify.  I think I see how to add in a hopstop 
link to dynamically generate based on the address of the venue... I 
really do NOT like the hardcoding of the "select XYZ" in the combo 
boxes.  And the modules all show the current month, wheras I'd like to 
be able to configure it to show the next month.

Oh and lastly I'd like to be able to have the Joomla based calendar 
synch up to some public calendar systems like Google, Meetup, and 
whatever else people use.  So it's edit once, publish everywhere.

Anyone want to hack away at some code and add functionality? :-)

I run the gigCalendar project and would love some help! I'm not a 
developer guru like some of you folks on this list and I've been having 
an impossible time finding coders to help the project along since its 
release in Dec '05. Contact me directly if you're interested...adding 
these features alone would be huge!

Graham is in the land of the grand ol' opry - so I don't think he's
going to make it.

I have tried to help him in the past, as his extension is one of the
most useful I have found over the years. Maybe this could be one of
the projects for the user groups?

That is, besides launching the websites of course *blush*

Subject: [joomla] Multiple Admins?
Message-ID: <1193703260.3082.10.camel@leam>

A friend was looking for a good CMS and I obviously thought of Joomla.
The questions arose about having multiple admins who take care of
seperate areas, and being able to have different menu options depending
on where you are. 

For example, the Sales team at example.com can edit and change the sales
section of the site and the tech folks can edit product specifications.
A corporate customer might have a couple extra tabs on the top of the
menu that cover details on contract sales, etc. 

Make sense? The main issue would be that the sales and technical areas
were totally seperate, with seperate passwords, etc.

Take a look at this extension, I think it might be what your looking for:

I prefer JUGA:

http://extensions.joomla.org/component/option,com_mtree/task,viewlink/link_id,2587/Itemid,35/

There are also other ways of doing similiar things.

For example, docMan lets you have a document library with fine grained 
control over who can view/edit which documents.  But their not a "website".

Another thing to look into is that there are a couple of "magazine" 
components for Joomla which I would expect have ACL mechanisms built 
into it.

I forget what the component is for the current version, but hopefully 
next month(December) we will have a presentation on it(poke poke).

There is also a new component for Joomla 1.5 from RocketWerx that looks 
cool and their beta is currently available for purchase.

Subject: [joomla] IE7 and Joomla intranet site
Message-ID: <BAYC1-PASMTP038A03EA664A8EA1CED9DADF920@CEZ.ICE>

This one may be impossible, but I figure that maybe someone here might know.
I use Joomla for a company intranet site.  We are now rolling IE7 out to
users and have hit a minor usability issue that is bothering many of the
staff.  The site is in the Intranet security zone.  IE7 requires that sites
from different zones be opened in different windows, as opposed to tabs.
What winds up happening is that with clicking on links to various
sites/pages both external and intranet, the users wind up with several IE7
windows open, which somewhat defeats the purpose of having a tabbed
interface.  Through some research, I've found that there most likely isn't a
way to turn off this behavior for IE7, but there is a possible workaround.
It's called Mark of The Web
(http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537628.aspx).  Can this
additional header line be set in a Joomla site?  Would be best if I could
set it in one or a few places as opposed to on every page of the site.

Thanks,

Scott Klassen

Holy smokes, that approach is N U T S. I'd rather move forward with
the other workaround called Firefox.

being forced to insert such silly markup dynamically for every page
view.

Sorry to be harsh, gosh I hope I misunderstand this document.

This would be simple (I agree, it is stupid, but)...

Edit your template's index.php, before </head> add the
following
<?php echo "<!-- saved from
url=(".strlen($mosConfig_live_site).")$mosConfig_live_site
-->"; ?>?

No, what he wants is to give it a phony external domain name, so 
Internet Explorer treats the document as if it came from the internet 
instead of the intranet - in short, he wants to make them all treated 
the same way to keep them in the same tabs.

As such,
<?php echo "<!-- saved from url=(023)http://www.contoso.com/ -->"; ?>

Will do the trick(assuming his company isn't contoso)

Whether or not this means IE7 will display the intranet sites in the 
same browser window as the internet sites I'm not sure.

Im looking for decent Joomla hosting that's reliable and doesn't cost an 
arm and a leg. Any recommendations?

The only company I recommend for reliability is FutureQuest.

http://www.futurequest.net

You get SSH access, you get reliability, but you don't get cheap(lowest 
priced plan is 10/month for 300MB of diskspace and 5G transfer a month).

You can choose between MySQL v4 or v5, PHP v4 or v5, and you can choose 
between MySQL and Postgress(but not both).

(I even have an affiliate link if you want to use it and throw me some 
cash, just go through the link on my wife's photo gallery, 
http://www.saplings.us/gallery - sorry for the spammed advertising all 
over it, I use it as a test ground for different things - had to figure 
out how to modify Menalto's templates to include google ads at one point 
in time).

They have great service and don't oversell their accounts, however they 
are also proactive so if you have a very active Joomla site that is 
burning CPU they will ask you to upgrade your plan to one where you 
aren't impacting other customers).

Outside of FutureQuest, in NYC at least over 10 years ago was Panix, I 
think they do shared hosting as well as dedicated and the way they were 
run at the time I trusted them(they were one of the few hosts at the 
time that had internal customer forums where customers could B&M at each 
other and such.  I wonder if their still running them using NNTP?)  So 
if I was looking local, I'd go with Panix again.  But again, their not 
what I'd call cheap in this day and age.

There's a *ton* of Joomla hosting providers out there (the company I work for being one of them - http:///www.cartikahosting.com) - our site itself is in Joomla and we host many Joomla sites on our environment without issues. Another one that I can think of that would be a decent fit for a Joomla site would be http://www.medialayer.com.
