Message-ID: <CACv9p5osRohFgN67d_DYaX89woApz0u-Vs9vSDjaXKjw06RogQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm re-learning PHP and run a couple sites with almost vanilla Joomla. I'm
looking for a few resource recommendations.

I have a simple Joomla book that I'll be going through in the near term.
The Missus could use a suggestion for a book or two. My PHP-Fu isn't high
end but I'm learning.

What would you recommend as sites/things to look at, and books to mention
to the missus?

Thanks!

Leam

Subject: [joomla] Joomla and Google App Engine
Message-ID: <529F87E0.7040009@gmail.com>

I'm working on getting my site up on Google App Engine.... so far it's 
been an interesting process and it took me a day to get to the point 
where I was ready to actually install Joomla.  :-)

I figured I'd post my notes for anyone else interested in it as well
https://gist.github.com/garyamort/7758663

It's an almost "from scratch" process as it includes pre-install steps to:

1) Use PHPStorm's cool Google App Integration features.  By creating a 
"new" GAE project through their interface, it prompts for all those GAE 
settings I needed later to push changes up to the server as well as 
running the local GAE dev test environment.  I go ahead and push the 
hello world project up to GAE as well as make a few changes to get 
comfortable with their control interface.

2) Once I have a working PHPStorm GAE project, I use Git and github to 
merge the Joomla CMS code into my code.

3) After it's all merged, I discovered I needed to make a few tweaks to 
get the Joomla Installer to work under GAE.  There is probably a cleaner 
way to organize them and when I actually go back and do it a second time 
I can make a more detailed step by step.


What I find exciting about using the GAE environment is something which 
first seemed to be a big negative.  You can't modify files on the server 
from within your server code.  You have to "deploy" files to the server 
to change them.  This means installing Joomla Extensions, making 
configuration changes that modify configuration.php, and uploading 
images for articles have to be done on your local system and then 
"deployed" to the server.

There are some work-arounds for this, so it is possible to get around it 
- and I've got a few possibilities in mind for setting up restricted 
access for site managers to a special "version" of website where they 
can make these changes.  However, for GENERAL usage, this "con" is 
actually a big plus!  Every security problem I have ever encountered in 
Joomla has involved someone making changes to the files on the file 
system.  Untraceable changes, no idea how they got them there because 
file changes were not being logged by the system.  Was it some hidden 
php file?  Was it a compromised FTP account?  I have no clue.   By 
restricting file changes to the GAE deployment process, this means I get 
Google logging for free.  Every file change can be tracked down to a 
user account and an ip address.  I will gladly hop through one extra 
hoop to never have to worry about someone uploading images into my 
server and using it to host inappropriate material.


With GAE your not deploying your app on a traditional web server, where 
all the PHP files get executed if their accessed via the web. Instead 
when you "deploy" a set of files to your GAE project Google uses a 
configuration file to do some processing.  All the "static" files[css, 
javascript, images] will be stored on a completely separate server which 
is optimized to deliver them.  All the other files, get placed on your 
GAE instance, but only the "entree points" you have configured will 
actually be executed.  IE in my configuration, any request for the 
installation or administration folder will cause the index.php file from 
that folder to be run. Everything else goes to the primary index.php file.

This means you completely close off any security issues where someone 
discovers an extension with a hole that lets you do something like 
http://yourjoomlasite.com/plugins/content/somecoolcontentplugin/somecoolcontentplugin/lib/somelib.php?action=someexploitablecommand

All those problems are eliminated.


Security: one nice feature is that you can restrict access to some of 
the entry points using Google Authentication.  In my case, I set things 
up so you can't even access the installation or administration 
interfaces unless you are logged on to a Google Account and have been 
assigned admin rights to the project.


Usage costs:  Usage costs are a bit on the odd side.  With GAE you don't 
have a server that is "always running" whether or not your website is 
active.  Instead, when someone attempts to connect to your website, 
Google spins up 2 micro virtual systems - a web server and a mysql 
server - configured with your PHP code and your database.   When the 
system stops being accessed for at least 10 minutes, those systems are 
turned off.  You only pay for the minutes that your system is actually 
running.

Scalability: Since your forced to run 2 separate "instances" - one for 
the database and one for the PHP code, you get some basic scalibility 
for "free".  GAE can actually run anywhere from 1 to 1,000[or more!] 
"instances" of your PHP application - and they all access the same 
database.  So a website that suddenly gets so popular that it's 
overloaded can reconfigure their account and increase the maximum number 
of instances allowed to run...instant scaling.

Alongside all of this, there are a lot of fun little features you can 
play with once you have an app engine deployment running.  They allow 
you the option of integrating Google's Pagespeed service into it which 
will optimize images and compress/minify javascript and css with a 
dizzying array of switches, dials, and toggles to turn on/off different 
optimization.

They have a User API which PHP apps can use to use Google Apps for 
authentication/user information.

There is both a "free" memcache service and a paid option

Lots of things to twist and turn and play with.

Hello everyone;

 

I have an issue with Google SERP. And maybe is related to SEO. It looks like

Subject: [joomla] Bogus Links in Google SERP
Message-ID: <F7FA3B4BDE304E0D98AAEB91508D1487@OwnerPC>

No matter what I do I keep getting bogus SERP in google for unitel.biz.

 

Issue #1

Page title is correct. But in "indented results" I keep getting pages that
do not exist in website. Right know only the following page-links are
correct;

 

1.	SL1100 -  >> "unitel.biz/products/nec/sl1100.html" 
2.	Ipitomy Telephones - >>
unitel.biz/products/ipitomy/ip-telephones.html 
3.	IP PBX - >> unitel.biz/products/ipitomy/ip-pbx.html 
4.	Q Manager -- >> >> unitel.biz/products/ipitomy/q-manager-acd.html 

 

So, out of ten entries only four are correct. 

 

Issue #2

There was a time -many months back but not more than a year ago - that the
indented links where correct and more importantly when I did a search with
key words relevant to my site my site did come up. And it was coming up on
the bottom half of the first SERP page, which I thought was pretty good for
a newbie like myself.

 

Now no matter what keywords or phrases I enter my site does not show. It
only comes up if I enter my domain name "unitel.biz" in the google search
area

 

Any idea whats going on??

 

My site is hosted by cloudaccess.net. Speaking with one of their support
people I was told the issue was with the google search engine and indexing.
He did fix an incorrect sitemap entry on their server (my error) it had one
forward slash too many and suggested I go to google webmaster tool and erase
old site map and re-index, which I did. He tells me that cloudacces had and
still has exactly the same issue. 

 

What's going on???

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

**********


What you have are obsolete indexed entries in the Google database
You can handle that in several ways


In Google Webmaster Tools you can have pages removed from the index
but ...
I wouldn't do that. You can use this to your advantage instead by either
making entries in your .htaccess file that redirect these entries to the correct landing page or
use SH404SEF from http://anything-digital.com to redirect these to the correct page


Issue #2

There was a time -many months back but not more than a year ago - that the
indented links where correct and more importantly when I did a search with
key words relevant to my site my site did come up. And it was coming up on
the bottom half of the first SERP page, which I thought was pretty good for

Any idea whats going on??

Google is always making changes to the algorithm that serves up web pages.
And there are new web sites popping up all the time.
So your web site is floating in a seathing cauldron of web sites and Google has to decide from your search
what you are interested in seeing. They use many cues in their secret sauce. Some of those cues may be your own
past behavior. If you've searched for your site, seen results, and not clicked on them, Google may have surmised that you
are not interested in seeing that web site in the results.
Try using a service to keep track of your web page rankings for different keywords.
try: http://rankcheckerace.com

Other factors that can affect your SERP position are:
click through rate - so make your meta description attractive or descriptive
social popularity - so make your content sharable (of value and social share buttons easily accessible)
proximity - more important for Local SEO
backlinks to web site - the original main factor for Google ranking

There is much more that goes in to SEO as well, some conjecture. It is always changing


That your web site came up high in the rankings when new is of note.
Google has stated that content freshness is an important ranking factor.
Although Google may have newsworthiness in mind, I suspect there is another factor that is unstated.
To get a feel for how a web site may do, they may throw new web sites up high in the SERPs to see how
they perform for CTR, and drop them down once they make an assessment of the site. Otherwise, if a new web site
was never seen, and CTR is a ranking factor, then new web sites would never get a high enough SERP position to ever
get any clicks.


My site is hosted by cloudaccess.net. Speaking with one of their support
people I was told the issue was with the google search engine and indexing.


Yes, and you can address it with one of the methods mentioned above.


He did fix an incorrect sitemap entry on their server


Sitemaps are unnecessary unless you have a JavaScript menu that the robots cannot read.
You might as well just use Webmaster Tools and request a crawl. 


 (my error) it had one
forward slash too many and suggested I go to google webmaster tool and erase
old site map and re-index, which I did. He tells me that cloudacces had and
still has exactly the same issue.

Mark Simko
