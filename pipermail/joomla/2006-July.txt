Agreed, Rochen has excellent support. I can also suggest site5.com or 
dreamhost.com as cheaper solutions with less support.

I left site5.com several months ago -- after my root file directory suddenly disappeared one day -- with no explanation from support.  I find GoDaddy.com's shared hosting to have unparalleled service, support and pricing.  However, I don't know have any experience with their virtual private or dedicated hosting plans, which is what kirill is looking for.

Message-ID: <10375.192.128.167.68.1152381159.squirrel@rvyriptide.org>

I am just getting started with Joomla, and am trying to figure out if it
can do some of the things I need.  One has to do with user registration. 
>From what I can see, I can either enable or disable user registration. 
What I need is something in between.  Because our web site is meant to be
used by members of our swim team only, and some of the content is private,
I want to allow only known people to register.  I would explain this on
the registration page, so hopefully nobody that doesn't belong there
registers.  Just in case they do, I would like to look at the registration
request before allowing it.  I could then either allow the registration to
succeed or send the user an email explaining that the site is for members
only.  Can Joomla do this?  Thanks,

Bill

Hi, unless you find an extension to do it, it can't, not right out of the
box.
But since you have a limited number of ppl you wish to give access to, it is
really not a big trouble to create their accounts on by one, I guess.

Unfortunately the old open source adage "it's done when it's done"
applies here, and I'm not going to put a deadline in anyone else's
mouth.

However, we did commit to announcing 1.5 at LinuxWorld in San
Francisco this August...

Thanks for the update, Mitch. I guess if you hadn't written such a great article
we wouldn't be so anxious about using the new version.

Might have something to do with the other 3PD component exploits that
Secunia is reporting.

On a completely unrelated note, these reports look like the authors
were not contacted before the exploits were announced. I sure hope I
am wrong...

Hi gang,

Apologies for the cross-post, however I wanted to make sure I got to
as many of you as possible.

I'm preparing the presentation and would like to know:

    Just what exactly do you want to learn from this presentation?

Feel free to spout off whatever you are looking for, as I can tailor
the presentation. This time I hope to only put two or three of you to
sleep, as opposed to the four of you when I presented Mambo last year.
 :-)

I'm expecting a mix of technical/non-technical in the audience, so it
would be great if I could better target the information that you are
hoping me to cover. Let 'em rip!

Hi Mitch!

When and where will the presentation take place?

Will you also be discussing "hacks"?

Thanks for your response.

Two joomla questions on my mind, maybe or mabye not needed for a presentation. Can joomla provided different content based on URL referenced? For example, if I have mybiz.com with a storefront and a DNS CNAME of myhobby.net pointing to the same address, can I configure one joomla instance to provide two different sites?

How does joomla interface with shopping carts like OSCommerce and ZenCart? 

ciao!

Of course, and I will also be discussing the difference between the

The Virtuemart plugin for Joomla is (was?) based on phpshop:

Was. Now I think it has grown into something else although still based and
related to phpshop, but I'm not sure.
What I know is it works fine.

One of my hosted servers was hacked, but other then thousands of emails 
nothing else was damaged.  Can any one shed some light on how this was 
done, how PHP injection works, and what is the best way to prevent it.

Thanks,

Subject: [joomla] Joomla/CMS newbie question.
Message-ID: <d1e6d16304ec1f693f049668cbbc2c7a@comcast.net>

I couldn't be more new to Joomla and CMS from a developers prospective. 
I have looked through the Joomla web site, and while everything looked 
very interesting I still have some questions. Forgive me if they were 
addressed elsewhere since it is possible I overlooked them.

I have gone through most of the online demo for Joomla. Here are my 
developer's related questions so far:

As a PHP developer, what is the relationship of PHP to Joomla? How do I 
incorporate PHP into Joomla? How do I maintain and manage PHP 
development within a Joomla environment? Does Joomla know the 
difference between HTML and PHP code in its pages?

Does an entire web site application need to be in Joomla? Can some 
parts of the site remain purely PHP and still work with Joomla? Or is 
there no reason why the entire web application shouldn't be in Joomla?

Are their limitations with Joomla as a CMS tool that I should be aware 
of as a PHP developer? Can Joomla have access to Linux easily to 
execute a shell script (that you have file permissions to), for 
example?

As I am designing a new web application from the start with the 
intention of making the entire web site in PHP where pages would be 
dynamically created to obtain fresh data from a MySQL database, how can 
I use Joomla to best handle the CMS functions?

How do I take a web/graphic designer's design/layout and put this into 
Joomla? Are their any limitations of how the web pages must look in 
Joomla?

If some kind soul feels these questions are of little interest to 
others on the list, please feel free to reply to me via e-mail 
directly.

Thanks in advance,

Hi everyone.

My company is looking for a Joomla developer to join our team as a contractor for the short
term.  We are located in Cambridge and we are easy to get to via the T.

Are there any local resources?  Please contact me immediately via email.  Also - I hope this
isn't an annoyance to everyone on here.  I tried but couldn't find any good online ways to
post that resulted in replies.

Thanks!

Tell me for your necessity for Joomla? Do you need some component o module?

I'm from Ecuador.


Thanks in advanced

Depends on what exactly you want to do: if you want something that is 
managed from within Joomla then you will need to write a component / 
module / mambot - you can do this using PHP (or more likely) using 
Joomla's API.

Not sure what you mean there... Joomla uses PHP to generate HTML...

Doesn't *have* to be but if you want to use Joomla to manage it then it 
would probably be better to make it so.

Again depends on what you're doing: I wrote a custom component for 
managing audio tracks but because I wanted it to become part of the 
backend, it seemed easier to use the existing API to write it than 
simply coding it from the ground up in PHP (also, since it worked off 
the products database in Virtuemart, another plugin I was using, it 
seemed easier to integrate it as a component).

Well, the back end allows you to write config files, install 
components/plugins/templates and edit certain files (e.g. stylesheets) 
so yes you can do whatever PHP can do (assuming permissions are set 
correctly, etc).

What is your application? If your application handles written content 
then it would benefit to have *some* sort of content management tool 
such as Joomla for writers to use, (sorry, phpmyadmin does *not* count 
as a content management tool ;-). Otherwise you will end up writing some 
kind of back end from scratch which is a lot more work than working with 
Joomla instead.
>

Most probably you will make template/templates from the design - 
essentially the process is taking the HTML and adding the PHP code in it 
for blocks that are generated by Joomla. (The PHP code will call a 
Joomla function telling it to put certain modules at the current 
location in the page).

Sounds complicated but generally most areas of the page will be static 
so it ends up being relatively simple. In my case (an e-commerce site 
selling CDs and having streaming audio) the template ended up being ONE 
file (plus stylesheet and a few images). Because I used a plugin to 
perform most of the ecommerce back end functions it was realtively easy 
to build a site fast.

Not that Im aware of.

David;

I know not much but as yoru questions are easy, here goes.

Joomla is a PHP app. What you know in PHP will make you better in Joomla. You can mix/match pages, if you want, but I'm not sure you'll find that in your best interest.

You will find Joomla works well on Linux and you will also learn how Joomla *is* your CMS function. It is well featured and has lots of additional stuff to go with it. Give it a couple days of serious playing with and you'll see what I mean.

ciao!

You might want to get in touch with the BostonPHP group, at
www.bostonphp.org. The lead magician over there is Mark Withington,
who also is an active Joomla developer and could surely help you find

Hi David,

I'm presenting Joomla 1.5 next week at the NYPHP July Meeting. You're
most definitely invited :-)

While making the talk there will be no doubt a question and answer
session, and you will find yourself surrounded with some very helpful
and knowledgeable people who can easily answer your questions.

The more I learn about Joomla, the more I like it.

Would it be considered reasonable to expect a web graphic designer to 
prepare their designs as a template in Joomla? I'm asking because I 
don't know how many designers are familiar with Joomla yet. Also, how 
much effort would it take for an experienced designer to learn Joomla 
to complete their design in a Joomla template? Thanks!

www.joomlasolutions.com used to have a DreamWeaver extension so you
could output your design as a template file. Not sure if it is still
actively maintained, but you might want to check that out.

If the designers had access to something like that, then it would be
reasonable to ask them to take that step. However, you still need a
little PHP knowledge in order to create templates by hand, and that
may be asking too much from a graphic designer. I suppose it
ultimately depends on the skills of your designer.

Hi everyone,

I think that what Mitch provided below is great to note, and additionally, I
think we've been more successful working with designers that have actually
used Joomla, even on the periphery or partially.  The reason is that when
they're building module-like entities in their designs, they can think about
building it out in such a way that allows you as a developer and admin to
more effectively manage the modules on your template.

After a go at using Joomla, most designers can understand the ability to be
flexible that modules have, and breakout their designs accordingly.

Best,
Ryan

www.joomlasolutions.com used to have a DreamWeaver extension so you could
output your design as a template file. Not sure if it is still actively
maintained, but you might want to check that out.

If the designers had access to something like that, then it would be
reasonable to ask them to take that step. However, you still need a little
PHP knowledge in order to create templates by hand, and that may be asking
too much from a graphic designer. I suppose it ultimately depends on the
skills of your designer.

I work regularly with a designer and he does the basic port of his design to
the Joomla Template(I taught him and now he knows it better than I do) and I
just polish the ends and TADA!

Cheers

The hard part is knowing the names of the hardcoded CSS objects that are 
generated by Joomla and how to apply them. Luckily there have been a 
number of great tutorials created that cover this subject thoroughly. 
Check the forums for those. Let me know if you have trouble finding 
them...I can take some time to find them.
