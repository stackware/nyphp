<PRE>I am just about ready to throw in the towel.

No, I'm not giving up on Joomla, Joomla is still my preferred CMS.  But
Drupal is so widely used[and has the BIG benefit in my book of wisely using
JQUERY instead of Mootools.   Mootools is, in my book, easier to code in and
better in general.  But due to their fixation on not using a namespace, it
is a poor choice for a CMS where you want a wide number of different people
writing and producing extensions for your CMS.  You use mootools when you
have control of a  project and can insist everyone uses it.  You use JQUERY
when you don't know who else will be writing code integrated with your
project and can't insist on anything.]

Sooo, I have decided it is time that I learn how Drupal works, how to code
for it, etc.

I can hack an existing installation and fix bugs/add small features just as
quickly as any other home brew PHP design, but I don't really /understand/
it.

Drupal, in short, doesn't &quot;sing&quot; to me.  Joomla sings to me.  Sometimes
somewhat out of tune or harmony, but since I don't sing in tune or in
harmony that doesnt bother me.

I was curious if any of the Joomla developers/users here who also use Drupal
might speak of their experience/mindset with Drupal.  Do you have a mental
map in your mind, like &quot;Joomla has templates located /here/, Drupal has
templates called X located /there/&quot;  Kind of like how one might, say,
associate two western european languages in one's mind by their
similarities.

Or do you just treat them as two completely seperate beasts so as not to get
caught up in &quot;Joomla has X, so Drupal must as well.&quot; and &quot;In Joomla there is
no way to do X, so there must not be a way to do it in Drupal either&quot;?
