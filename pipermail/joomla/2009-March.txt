Does anyone know of a synchronization/integration with a shopping cart system?  There isn't one for Virtuemart/CB.  Beat mentioned in the forum that it's a major undertaking.

Thanks, but I don't think that one works.  :-)  At least from what I read in the forums.  It's for an old version of VM.  But I'll try it out.

Subject: [joomla] IP Hosting and Cached Host Name
Message-ID: <080e01c99df6$7685ddd0$63919970$@com>

Hello,

So for a site that isn't using name virtual hosting, I'm having issues with
Joomla caching erroneous hostnames during link creation/etc.

For example, if someone points badman.badplace.com to www.mysite.com and
happens to hit a page that hasn't been cached yet, the URLs generated now
point to http://badman.badplace.com/some-url which is obviously a bad thing.

I understand that now $live_site variable isn't supported.  How can this be
resolved?

Thanks,

H

I located a newer version of the plugin and module, but take a look at the readme file:

"This module will run the sync-users command for CB silently whenever it is shown. 

"Just publish, set it to not display the title, and it will run a sync-users each time it's shown.

"Ensure that you publish this on every page the CB login module is shown, as you need the user database to be synced before the user attempts to login."

Considering that I have a login module on every page (in the header), the sync will occur on every page load.  Isn't that a bit much?

My guess is that it has to sync each time because it does not write to 
the CB table.

Yeah, apparently this is the only solution.  I looked through the code too,
and JURI is using HTTP_HOST, which won't exist in this case.  Seems as
though it could use SERVER_NAME or at least failover to it.

You COULD cheat it a bit and setup rewrite rules in .htaccess for any cases
that don't match a list of domains

RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.validdomain1\.com #list each domain that
should exist 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^validdomain1\.com #list each domain that should
exist 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.validdomain2\.com #list each domain that
should exist 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^validdomain2\.com #list each domain that should
exist 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.validdomain3\.com #list each domain that
should exist 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^validdomain3\.com #list each domain that should
exist 
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://www.defaultdomain.com/$1 [L,R=301] #rewrite to a
default domain

This was my method of making sure that people were on valid domains

Just a thought

Are you in New York?

If you come to the Joomla meeting on Thursday I'm sure anyone there could
show you how to do this in about 5 minutes.

Yup, we should definitely discuss it.

As for the Joomla Extension TBD, can I demo MetaMod? I'm having a hell
of a lot of fun playing around with it, and am starting to think it is
the swiss army knife of module tools.

Also as a heads up, WebTechNY will be tomorrow night at KickApps. The
planned speaker ended up not being able to make it, so we're going
with Josh (the guy that sits across from me) making an impromptu demo
of the Widget Studio. He's the product manager of the Widget Studio
and gives a much more compelling demo than I can.

I know it is two days in a row (yucky for me too) but if you're
interested and can make it, please do!

Yes, its pretty nifty...

As a template vendor, I think its awesome. There are *so* many
vendors/websites that are selling averagely coded templates at high prices,
with lackluster support, *cough* Mr Monster *cough*.

This tool will seperate the wheat from the chaff....

They have a free trial, check it out.

Hi all,

I am having a problem with registrations in joomla.  I am using version 1.0.15, we have a fake organization creating fake accounts through the registration page.

I have blocked the domain's ip from accessing the site, but we are still getting the fake registrations.

What should I do next?

thanks,
Laura

You can publish the menu in two places.  Go to modules and create a new menu module using the same menu.

If you want to make a second menu with duplicate links, add a link as an "alias" type and it will give it the same Itemid as the original link.

Captcha doesn't help if it's a human entering the registrations.  It can only stop robots.

If you want them to be linked, create two modules that use the same menu.

The set up submenu items

Then, here is the sneaky part, have the first to expand only "to zero" and
the second to expand "1-99". Then you'll have a split menu where the second
set dynamically change based on the users site navigation choices.

No great technical revelation here, just a bit of Monday morning humor. 
While going back through Barrie's book I again saw some of the Menu 
Manager options like:

	# Leading	1
	# Intro		4
	Columns		2
	# Links		4

I've been shell scripting for a while and this is the first time I've 
realized three of the options aren't commented out...

Subject: [joomla] several 1.0 sites hacked this week!
Message-ID: <1238037802.7402.271.camel@jersey>


Several of my clients' 1.0.15 sites have been hacked this week!  Is
there a problem with 1.0?  

I don't see an announcement on joomla.org

I just saw that my site was hacked the other day. Fortunately they
bunged it up a bit, so the code didn't run, but instead gave an error
message.

What they had done is append javascript to the index.php file. It was
disguised as ascii codes, and there were several var defined and
substituted in, but the result was that it attempted to open a hidden
iframe directed to siplank.com. When I tried to open siplank.com in a
web browser (yes, I did that! I do lots of crazy things out of
curiosity) Firefox stopped it with a warning about the site being known
for malware.

I'm running 1.5.9 on a shared host. I will be calling my host and asking
them what they can find out from their logs as to what happened.

Top 10 Stupidest Administrator Tricks
>From Joomla! Documentation


10. Use the cheapest hosting provider you can find.

    Preferably use a shared server that hosts hundreds of other sites,
some of which are high-traffic porn sites. Don't check the list of
recommended hosting providers.

9. Don't waste time with regular backups.

    Maybe the hosting provider will help you out.

8. Don't waste time adjusting PHP and Joomla! settings for increased security.

    Hey, the install was brain-dead easy. How bad could the rest be?
Worry about those details only if there's a problem.

7. Use the same username and password for everything.

    Use the same username and password for your on-line bank account,
Joomla! administrator account, Amazon account, Yahoo account, etc.
Hey, who has time to keep track of so many passwords? And anyway,
since you don't change passwords, it's easier to just use the same one
all the time, everywhere.

6. Install your brand new beautiful Joomla!-powered site, and
celebrate a job well done.

    Don't worry about it again. After all, if you don't make any more
changes, what can go wrong?

5. Do all upgrades on the live site right away.

    Who needs a development and testing server anyway? If an
installation fails, you'll just uninstall it again. That will
hopefully also undo any damage the installation caused.

4. Trust third-party extensions.

    Install all the cool-looking stuff you can find. Anyone smart
enough to write a Joomla! extension will provide perfect code that
blocks every known exploit attempt, now and forever. After all, almost
all this stuff is provided for free by well-meaning, good-hearted
people who know what they are doing.

3. Don't worry about updating to the latest version of Joomla!

    Hey, nothing has gone wrong so far, and if it ain't broke don't
fix it! Same plan for the third-party extensions. Too much work;
life's a beach.

2. When your site gets cracked, panic your way into the Joomla! Forums.

    Start a new post with a very familiar title: "My Site's Been
Hacked! (sic)" Be sure not to leave relevant information, such as
which obsolete versions of Joomla! and third party extensions you
installed.

1. Once your site's been cracked, fix the defaced index.php file and
assume all else is well.

    Don't check raw logs, change your passwords, remove the entire
directory and rebuild from clean backups, or take any other overly
paranoid-seeming action. When the attackers return the next day,
scream loudly that you've been "hacked again," and it's all Joomla!'s
fault. Ignore the fact that removing a defaced file is not even step
one in the difficult process of fully recovering a cracked site.

You should look into upgrading to 1.5.9 for all your 1.0 sites.
Check all your logs to try and find out HOW they got in.

AFAIK there are no known security holes atm.

We got hacked last month by a brute force attack on our FTP password. Once
they had that, they got into the Joomla files.

Any site can be hacked. The other half of the equation is vigilance and
backups :)

No expert here.  I looked at what they offered and it is nicely done.   
I did have some issues with how their sites displayed on Firefox Mac  
OSX. Could I do it myself probably not.  Could I hire someone to do it  
for that money? Maybe? Do I have any volunteers?  I think you can buy  
the template for $200 if you host it yourself. It is hard for me to  
tell I find their wording is kind of cryptic.  I don't like that there  
is limits to what you can do as far as amount of galleries etc.  That  
would be the deal breaker for me.  If you look at something like  
livebooks it seems like a bargain.

The tone of this response appears condescending, although it may not
have been meant that way. Perhaps it's just the title that gives the
post that appearance.

I can think of several reasons why a site may still be running an older
version of Joomla! than the latest and greatest. It may be that the
client does not want to pay for the work involved in an upgrade, or that
the client cannot afford to pay for it. Or, perhaps the extensions being
used on the site do not have stable 1.5 versions yet.

There may be reasons why the site is run on a shared host. To some that
may seem like a less than ideal situation, but for others, shared
hosting and low hosting fees may fit them better.

I think the original post about being hacked was meant to be informative
and perhaps intended to spark a discussion. This reply seems like a
lecture. If so, it's unwarranted. If I'm wrong about the intent, then I
apologize, but sometimes the elitist tone gets my ire up.

Hello Barrie,

May I inquire as to how you verified the attack?  I know that FTP
bruteforcing is extremely difficult, and that is very improbable.
What you may have faced was a dictionary attack, which may have worked
with some luck if you had a weak password.  A password including a mix
of

1) UPPERCASE
2) lowercase
3) punctuation/!#$.,
4) numbers

and have a good strong/long password you would never fall victim to dictionary.

As for bruteforce, an ftpd simply denies access after 3 or 5
(configurable, usually defaults to 3) failed login attempts for some
time.  Some hosts go as far as restricting ftp access until you call
them and verify the problem.  Also, brute forcing over a TCP pipe a
slow protocol such as FTP is virtually impossible.  At this rate it
would take YEARS to bruteforce the password if not DECADES.

@ Other users
Also make sure to go into joomla user configuration and change the
username of 'admin' to something else.
To protect your joomla administation section  If you have a static ip,
you can add

order allow,deny
deny from all
allow from your.static.ip.here

to a file called .htaccess in your administration folder.  If for some
reason your ip changes and you get locked out, simply login via FTP
and update the .htaccess file.  There are some other advanced methods
for protecting your administration folder.

Also, FTP was a protocol developed 30+ years ago.  It is not secure,
clear text authentication, etc.  FTP must go.  If you can help it, do
not use ftp, instead SFTP, or SSH.  Just.. anything but FTP.  Sadly,
thats all that is easy to use, highly available across all hosts, and
not everyone on shared hosting provides SSH access.  If you can do
without it, do without it. http://wooledge.org/mywiki/FtpMustDie

I have seen more sites hacked due to unpatched php or bad php
code(mostly from 3rd party addons) more than I have with FTP though.

Still with good security practices you can reduce the risk considerably.

We found the attacks/IP in the server logs. A financially backed hacker
outfit from Nigeria, go figure. The joys of having a PR9 site =P

Our password was 10 chars including letters, numbers and punctuation. We are
hosted on a "secured" rackspace server.

We don't have FTP running any more!

This information is unfortunately too late for Barrie, but I have
found vsftpd (Very Secure FTP Daemon) not only secure but wikkid fast
to boot. It supports SFTP, so folks that don't have SSH/SCP can still
use a half-decent client and run over a moderately encrypted
connection.

As for the defense of folks running PHP4, mass shared hosting, and
whatnot... I just made an off-hand comment a few seconds ago regarding
folks using outdated javascript menus that search bots could not
parse:

"If you're not keeping up with the times, don't expect your website to
perform well."

I cannot stress that enough. Seriously. Don't take your horse and cart
on the information superhighway; and if that is all you can afford,
perhaps you need to save up before you take that first ride, and for
certain stay well away from the fast lane. Just like starting a
business - if you cannot pony up the funds required to incorporate a
legitimate entity, don't expected to be treated like a legitimate
entity!

I know it may sound harsh, maybe I'm just grumpy from working too many hours.

PR9?

Keep in mind that FTP passwords were sent in clear text so some of the 
info might have been snooped. Also, some unix versions have an 8 
character password maximum length. If your punctuation came in chars 9 
or 10 it might not have been there. If the host was not using shadow 
passwords the /etc/passwd file might have had encrypted passwords and be 
readable by another user on the system.

Turning off FTP is a great idea, as is using something like SFTP or vsftp.

Subject: [joomla] Thinking through a Joomla vs Drupal artcle
Message-ID: <49CCB0E9.4030705@reuel.net>

Here's a note posted by an "IBM consultant" on a Drupal associated 
website. They make different points in the Joomla vs Drupal debate, not 
in quality so much as in niche. If this sort of thing is true it does 
reinforce my decision in favor of Joomla as I'd like to target small 
businesses.

http://www.topnotchthemes.com/blog/090224/drupal-vs-joomla-frank-comparison-ibm-consultant

What this makes me wonder is how can we market Joomla better when "IBM 
consultants" provide this sort of perception? For me it's a great plus 
but I'd like to see it more public.

How do you all market Joomla to your small business clients?

Use the right tool for the job.

A similar argument can be made between say Symfony vs. Zend Framework.

One is always looking to save time.  If one can do that with Joomla
and still make a good site, standards compliant, great functionality
and have a easier learning curve for your clients, then why not?

If one is looking for custom functionality, Things that would be
difficult to accomplish with Joomla, then don't use Joomla, use
Drupal(if it fits the bill), or whatever else that is best for the
project.

You don't simply just install Joomla and try to build a site.  You
define your goals first, have an action plan, and consider a few
different tools before you start the actual work.

While there is a learning curve for Joomla MVC Framework, it is still
as difficult as anything else that is new.  If you're not a developer,
you will have a hard time with Drupal as well as Joomla.

Let me put it this way...  Drupal is very flexible, and as such there
are many ways to do something, and that becomes difficult. Joomla has
certain design/development limitations, and its own conventions in
some areas which go to save one from himself.  Allow me to compare
Zend Framework with any other.  Since ZF is a openly knit and loose
framework, there are numerous ways to do something.  There are no best
practices in many areas (except for coding standards guidelines), and
for new comers, it can be very daunting, to have to actually setup a
bootstrap environment, the front controller design pattern etc. etc.
Advanced coders have no problem.  Symfony or Kohana or Code Igniter or
any other php framework actually has a directory structure built,
their own convention over configuration methods, which aid in
extremely rapid application development.

On the same note, since Joomla has its own ways in a lot of ways, it
is easier to use in the long run, as things are very structures.
Drupal is a victim of its own flexibility and developer freedom.

I vote for Joomla, only when it is needed to throw up a quick site for
a small business.  If you need functionality which is difficult to
achieve in Joomla, then use something else, or hire me! :)
Peace.
