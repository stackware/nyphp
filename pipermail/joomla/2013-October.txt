Has everyone gone to https://www.healthcare.gov/ to sign up for Obamacare?? 

I am in awe of this site!? It is the most usable site I've ever seen by far.? I made some mental notes about some of the layout and function of the site.

Hello everyone,

 

(Joomla v3)

 

I need to give a user the ability to login into article manager module
directly.

 

Ideally when this user logs in he should see the "control panel "and article
module". He should have permission to create, edit, delete, articles and
assign categories to those articles.

 

These are my current settings -

 

1.	User Group:  Administrator
2.	Content / Article - Manager/ Options /Permissions / Administrator /
Actions / Allow ALL

 

With these settings when user logs in articles display the edit icon. It
does not take the user to control panel where he can choose the article
manager.

 

Can someone give me a hint - I am tired of watching videos!!!

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Joomla 3 offers several access control levels (ACL). Some are backend -
like Admin, Super User, etc. and some are Front End, like Author, Editor,
Publisher, etc.

If you are tried of watching videos, I suggest setting up some accounts
with the various levels and experiment. That is how I learned.

Personally, I have found that the Author and Publisher levels work well if
you need to give users access to post articles. Both provide front end-only
access and you need to use the Log-In form module.

All best,

Steve

You may want / need to create a new User Group, and assign it custom
permissions - something that only allows access to the components you want,
while (by default) not allowing access to everything else.  TEST THIS
THOROUGHLY - remember that a single "Deny" will override any and all
"Allow" and "Inherited" options when it comes to permissions.

Subject: [joomla] Featured Article - Don't show Title
Message-ID: <7DDEB755179B4B1E99BA75264BDC7579@OwnerPC>

Hello everyone,

 

Joomla v3.

 

I need to remove the "Title" in an article which is featured with a
readmore. I am able to remove the title from the article - but not from the
readmore in featured.

 

I have a J2.5 site with featured article and readmore and was able to remove
title. Somehow - with same settings as the j2.5 - the j3 is not doing it, am
I missing a step in j3?   

 

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Subject: [joomla] Joomla! 3.2 preview - Must watch video!
Message-ID: <CABcNofM6eYFObDo2GccOu_zDmbqemQvihYjHj7BT43p7gMn6Lg@mail.gmail.com>

If you have 25 minutes to spare, you have to check out Brian Teeman's
Joomla 3.2 presentation that he gave last month at Joomla Day Switzerland.

It is excellent and it looks like Joomla 3.2 is going to be a huge upgrade,
unlike the jump to Joomla 3.1 from 3.0, which was mostly bug fixes and some
security upgrades.

http://vimeo.com/76115552

SPOILER ALERT - If you want to watch the video and be surprised, stop
reading NOW and watch the video. But if you can't wait, here are some
highlights.

Brian goes over a lot of additions and improvements, among them are:

* Security Keys. When you log into the admin panel there will be a third
text box to insert a key (It's optional.)

* Removing the left column in the articles and categories pages (Yippie!)
They are going to use Smart Search and a new filter system.

* Upgrading the jQuery, Bootstrap and icon libraries that ship with Joomla.
(I am assuming that there will be an option to continue using the Bootstrap
2 library because Bootstrap 3 is completely different from 2.)

* Improved and expanded template manager functions. You will now be able to
edit all the template files through the backend, not just the index.php and
CSS files. You will also able to create files in the template manager.

* Joomla 3 will likely ship with a built-in app builder IDE for developers
to rapidly build Joomla apps.

* Speaking of apps, Joomla 3.2 will have a built-in App Store, just like
the iPhone.

* And much, much more.

I have find time to watch the video a second time. This is a major upgrade
(they could probably call it Joomla 4.0) and the 3.2 beta is supposed to be
released later this month so we will have a chance to check it out very
soon.

ALSO, don't forget to sign up for JoomlaCamp NYC on Oct. 27th at the Hive
at 55 on 55 Broad Street. Visit the Joomla NYC site for more details
http://www.joomlanyc.org/

Please attend JoomlaCamp NYC - Let's get Joomla NYC rockin' again.

Wishing everyone a happy and healthy Columbus Day weekend!

Message-ID: <1381701889.65305.YahooMailNeo@web164901.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

In searching 
for information on Joomla!'s Smart Search component, I found there was 
some misinformation (one blogger said the Smart Search was simply the 
autocompletion feature), and little or nothing explaining how it's 
different from the original Search and how it works. 

So Gary Mort and I wrote an in-depth article explaining it, for anyone who is interested in knowing the details of what this new search component does:

Hi Everyone,

 

The beginning Joomla topics were described when we first announced
JoomlaCamp.  Now we've firmed up the Intermediate and Advanced presentations
and they should prove very interesting to a lot of local Joomla people.
Joomla camp is only $45 and includes a Panera Bread lunch of your choosing.

 

I urge you to visit our website and sign up for JoomlaCamp while we still
have space.  It's only $45 and includes a Panera Bread lunch of your
choosing.

 

http://joomlanyc.org/index.php/events/joomlacamp-2013

 

I hope to see some of you at the Monthly Joomla Users Group Meeting tonight
at Touro College.  There will be a drawing for one free admission to
JoomlaCamp.

 

Intermediate Topics - For people with Joomla experience

*	Search vs. Smart Search - Huh? (Donna Vincent)
If you google Joomla Search and Smart Search you may find that there is not
a lot of information about it other than basic implementation.  Many people
are unsure of what it is.  One blogger was telling people that it is the
autocompletion that happens as you type your search terms!   Yikes.  Let's
discuss what the differences are between the old search and the new search,
and some of the tweaks and customizations that can be done to Smart Search.
*	Joomla 3.2 is currently scheduled for release on November 6, 2013.
We will have a preview of some of its many new features. (Elin Waring)

Advanced Topics - For people with Joomla experience and know PHP or another
programming language.

*	DIY Module (Donna Vincent)
Let's build our own custom module from scratch!  It's easy and very useful.
How many times have you looked on the Joomla Extensions Directory and
couldn't find a module that was what you wanted.  Do-It-Yourself!  If you
can do a little coding, even if it's mostly copy-and-paste, you can build a
module.
*	DIY Content Plugin (Donna Vincent)
Let's build our own custom content plugin!  That's one of those things where
you type curly braces into your Joomla article:  {something foo} and when
the article is displayed on the website, "{something foo}" is replaced with
text, or a video, a photo, a link, etc.
*	Resources for Quick Joomla! Coding (Gary Mort)
At Joomaday NY 2012, Gary Mort gave "resources for Quick Joomla! Coding to a
large packed room of Joomla enthusiasts.  He'll be doing something in a less
formal workshop style at our JoomlaCamp.  Come with your questions!

Hello everyone!!

 

I would like my customers to be able to visit my website and pay their
invoices online. I am not looking to sell (e-commerce) online only to give
my customer the option to pay me. 

I already accept credit card payments (I use Bankcard/Peachtree) - I do the
transaction manually - customer calls me and I enter info into Peachtree and
submit. BankCard charges me a monthly service of about $60.00 to $80.00 even
when there no transactions for the month. 

 

I looked at Pay Pal and they don't have a monthly service charge. 

 

My question is;

Are there other entities out there - besides Pay Pal - that provide the same
service at competitive rates with no recurring monthly fees?

Is there a Joomla extension that will enhance the Pay Pal button? Maybe
something where the customer can enter invoice number and maybe other
information that I can capture. 

 

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

To accept Credit cards will cost you $30 per month with PayPal.
Your clients can use PayPal standard, but that sends them to PayPal's site.
I am working on a Braintree gateway.
But unless you do volume they are all costly.

Message-ID: <CALfVZ398u3kKwV0hFyqj19XHQs_m-m9EhmS6CG+jM0_BXxJrnQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am hoping someone can help me.I am using the latest Joomla 3 and a
Yootheme template. I have added page breaks on one of my articles and there
is some code that generates "1 of 4" pages under the page title and before
the article begins. I want to move that to below the article but I can't
figure out where the code is in the Yootheme template,or is it a Joomla
core function. If it is, how can I change it's position?
Ellen

If you can't find the function in the template, you might be able to use it
using CSS.  Using Chrome or Firefox, right-click on the area, and Inspect
it.  If you can find the proper ID or Style, you can the reposition it
using CSS to another part of the page.

Look at the template override.? In Yootheme templates, it's buried deep in the template subfolders.? I think it's in warp/systems/joomla/layout/...

Not sure what is going on with the meta description tags on your site. 

 

I always fill out the description tags found in the "Site > Global
Configuration" and then on the first page, you will find "Metadata
Settings."  I put the general site description here. 

 

And on the Articles page, I use the "Metadata Options" and fill out the
description based on the content in the article. Limit content to three
sentences or less. The fewer characters the better, but make sure the
sentences make sense because they show up in the search results. Also use a
different meta description for each article.

 

While you are filling out the descriptions, you might as well put in some
keywords too.     

 

Generally Google search works like this: when it indexes a page, it first
checks to see if there is content in the meta description tags and if so, it
uses those in the search results. If it cannot find the description tag or
content in the description tag then it looks for content on the page.

 

Do a "view source" on one of your web pages and see if there is a meta
description tag in the header (or head) section. It should look like this
<meta description="This is a description tag" >  

 

And yes, I highly recommend the Xmap extension. I have been using it for
years and it has always worked for me. 

 

Stay cool!

Yes I have put content in meta-tags - somewhere I read that meta tags in
Joomla are hierarchical - in other words menu meta tags are at the top of
the list and everything else follows, so if you have meta tags info in your
menus you don't need them in articles and so forth. Do you agree? Yesterday
I did enter meta info in articles - just in case. What had me confused was
the source of some of the entries for example this entry >> SL1100 System
NEC SL1100 -  SL1100 System Pos.15 NEC SL1100 VoIP Digital Hybrid ... <
OOPS I just realized where this info was coming from. For testing purposes I
had setup custom html modules and assigned them to different positions in
the template. They are now deleted.

 

Can you suggest a sitemap extension for Joomla - am told that Xmap by VARGAS
is the best?

 

Thank you for your response to my question <<

Google search needs help. You need to configure a few things before you can
expect good results.

 

Have you put content in the description meta tags? This is information that
should be displayed in search results once your site has been indexed.

 

And have you uploaded an XML file to your Google Webmaster Tools account?
This tells Google when and where to search you site.
