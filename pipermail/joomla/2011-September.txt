FYI, I emailed Disqus to find out about their pricing plans - turns out 
the removed the 19.99/month plan so all they have is the 299/month and 
999/month plan.

At 299/month Disqus is no longer very interesting.  My guess is that 
they have enough "corporate" accounts that they don't want to spend time 
with the small accounts anymore.  In any case, without a decent, 
granulated upgrade path from free to pay I'm not interested in their 
platform at all.

Hey John, 

I would be perfect for this setup. I am currently working and living in Brooklyn, However I am moving to Maui, HI for the winter and was looking for some part time development work to offset my costs. 

I have extensive Joomla, and other php framework experience. 

Here are some of the sites I just launched. 

http://insideschools.org/ (Me and Rafael at dioscouri.com launched this site from a massive migration from wordpress and another custom CMS.)

http://www.invigoratetravelguide.com/ (this a flash site, But the administration panel for all the city and state and map info is joomla component that generates CSS. i did the component not the flash.)

http://premierelivingprod.com/ (This is a really basic site, with a bit of content, slideshow, and a contact form. I only show it because i built it from a PSD in 6 hours start to finish.)

http://www.saleforcedrupalorbitz.com.php5-24.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/ (Not launched yet waiting on approvals, this is drupal not joomla.)

http://sunpill.com/ (this is magento, but cool little store and shows I can do ecommerce.)

I would be working 6 hours behind you but i am an early riser so i would be be available for calls and such around noon NYC time. 

I have great references and will be back in NYC in the spring. 

My normal rate is 35/hour but if it is easy work I am down for small  flat rates for  easy gigs. 

Chris

Hey Laura, I wanted to mention that I'd love to try presenting again 
this year at JoomlaDay....this year instead of a beginners level 
course[where there were no beginners], I was thinking an overview of 
CiviCRM could be good.   Been working with it recently and like Joomla 
CiviCRM has a dizzying array of options which can make it overwhelming 
to imlpement.

Subject: [joomla] Dev environment using virtualbox
Message-ID: <4E6101E1.3010507@gmail.com>

I've been driven a little crazy lately with trying to develop for Joomla 
with the following limitations:

1) Half the sites use PHP 5.2 and half of them use PHP 5.3
2) Sometimes I'm online and sometimes I'm offline


I kept coming back to "if only I was using linux, I could set things up 
more easily"....  Then it struck me that my desktop is a beefy system 
memorywise[this solution is gonna take a lot of memory] - so I gave 
VirtualBox a try.
http://www.virtualbox.org/

VirtualBox basically allows you to run different operating systems in a 
virtual environment.

For my current setup, I started with Ubuntu Server:
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/download

For the VirtualBox settings, choose fixed disk size - not dynamic.  I 
use 10GB, it eats up the full space but improves performance.  My system 
has 8GB of memory, so I give the system 2GB of ram, I'd suggest nothing 
under 1GB.

in the network settings for the virtual machine, I setup TWO network 
adapters.  Adapter 1 is set to "bridged adapter", the name is selected 
from my active adapter.   This allows the system to connect through 
yours to the internet.   Adapter 2 is a "Host Only Adapter"  - basically 
it's a "fake" network adapter that allows your pc communicate with the 
VM and the VM communicate with you.  So if your doing this on a laptop, 
you can still work even while offline.

****For the application settings[File-->Preferences] - go to the network 
settings and configure the virtual network adapter settings.  The 
important bit here is to disable the dhcp server.

When installing Ubuntu, setup adapter 1 for DHCP and adapter 2 as a 
static IP address in a different network[most home networks are 
192.168.1.0 or 192.168.2.0 - so I give my internal only network the 
address 192.168.129.1, netmask 255.255.255.0 - no default gateway!]

Openssh is important to install for decent CLI access.
Samba should be installed to make it easy to access the files on the 
server[just share out your web directory and then you can map the drive 
and access it from your favorite web editor].
Git, subversion, and mercurial should be installed since you need it at 
some point
I always make sure to install wget
Now, the piece of magic that makes this all work, DNSMasq:
http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html

DNSMasq allows you to run a DHCP server and  DNS cache on the virtual 
machine.  So you setup the DHCP server to give out an IP address to your 
system, and have it pass itself along as the DNS server[make VERY sure 
to also specify a blank gateway/router so all your internet traffic goes 
to the right place].
The importan bits I've found:
interface=eth1
interface=lo
^^^these 2 lines makes sure that your system doesn't try to take over 
your "real" network
address=/osm/192.168.56.1
domain=osm
^^^this sets up the "fake" domain osm and configures it so any domain 
ending in .osm will be given the ip address 192.168.56.1  - the virtual 
machines ip address
dhcp-range=192.168.56.10,192.168.56.15,255.255.255.0,12h
^^^ this gives your fake network a range of addresses, and a long timeout
dhcp-option=3
^^^ makes sure dnsmasq doesn't try to get your computer to route traffic 
through it
dhcp-option=19,0           # option ip-forwarding off
dhcp-option=44,192.168.56.1     # set netbios-over-TCP/IP nameserver(s) 
aka WINS server(s)
dhcp-option=45,192.168.56.1     # netbios datagram distribution server
dhcp-option=46,8           # netbios node type
^^^^helps with the file shareing
dhcp-authoritative
^^^speeds up initialization
cache-size=1500
no-negcache
^^^helps with lookups


As an added bennie, with dnsmasq running, your lame windows box now has 
the full power of a linux domain name caching - so it will speed up your 
general internet usage.

Then, in general, I follow the instructions at 
http://www.metod.si/multiple-php-versions-with-apache-2-fastcgi-phpfarm-on-ubuntu/ 
to setup and install apache, mysql, and php 5.2 and 5.3 - with 
modifications for the latest versions of each.

In my virtual hosts configuration the following are important:
VirtualDocumentRoot /var/www/%-3

%-3 basically means the third element of the domain name and is used to 
map domains to directories.  So for me:
http://testsite.53.osm - the files stored at /var/www/testsite - the 
THIRD element of the domain  name will be used
also using that directory is http://www.testsite.53.osm and 
http://testsite.52.home

Wheras http://mydomain.53.osm will use the files located at 
/var/www/mydomain

Our last bit of magic uses the virtual host configuration:
<VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerAdmin webmaster at localhost
         ServerName 52.osm
     ServerAlias *.52.osm
     VirtualDocumentRoot /var/www/%-3
         DocumentRoot /var/www
<Directory /var/www/>
                 Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews +ExecCGI
                 AllowOverride All
                 Order allow,deny
                 allow from all
                 AddHandler php-cgi .php
                 Action php-cgi /php-fcgi/php-cgi-5.2

</Directory>

<VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerAdmin webmaster at localhost
         ServerName 53.osm
     ServerAlias *.53.osm
     VirtualDocumentRoot /var/www/%-3
         DocumentRoot /var/www
<Directory /var/www/>
                 Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews +ExecCGI
                 AllowOverride All
                 Order allow,deny
                 allow from all
                 AddHandler php-cgi .php
                 Action php-cgi /php-fcgi/php-cgi-5.3

</Directory>


These 2 configurations are almost identical, the only things that change 
are servername, serveralias, and action
The servername has to be a full name, so I just use the php version I 
want with the domain tacked on[53.osm].
The serveralias can have a wildcard, so *.53.osm means that for ANY 
website you try to load which ends in .53.osm use this configuration.
Lastly, the Action line tells apache which PHP FastCGI server to route 
the request to.  So I have 2 different instances of PHP running, 5.2 and 
5.3 and route accordingly.

[Note, I share out the /var/www directory using SAMBA, and then map it 
on my windows box to drive letter W:]

So now to edit files on my test website, garyamort, I edit the files 
located at w:/garyamort
To see the website using PHP 5.2, I go to http://garyamort.52.osm
To see the website using PHP 5.3 I go to http://garyamort.53.osm

When dealing with oddities like a website which "suddenly" stops 
working, one cause is upgrading to PHP 5.3
CiviCRM for example has 2 versions, almost identical but one of them 
will run on PHP 5.2 and one runs on PHP 5.3  - so a CiviCRM website that 
suddenly stops working is likely to have a webhost who upgraded PHP from 
5.2 to 5.3

It's a fairly simple solution - just copy the 5.3 version files over the 
old version files AND DELETE THE TEMPLATE CACHE DIRECTORIES - and it 
will start working again.

If there is interest, I'm trying to put together a virtual box of all 
this pre-configured, so all you have to do is - with the exception of 
the part I put *** in front of, it would all be plug and play for most 
home networks.

By the same token, if anyone knows a bit more about DHCP and DNS - I've 
had trouble with this part with windows...since both the home router and 
my virtual box broadcast a DNS server address, Windows will 
occassionally grab the wrong DNS address.  The problem is, I don't want 
to ALWAYS run the virtualbox, so I want some way for the VM to override 
the DNS address, but still allow the client to use the other one.

And for those of you who are really good with IPForwarding, I sometimes 
have to use remove VPN networks.  So I have the VPN client on both my 
windows machine and the virtual machine running.  It would be great if I 
could get the VPN client on the linux machine to dynamically update 
dnsmasq so that when it's running, the DHCP server will tell my windows 
box to route all traffic just for the remote network through it, and do 
some NAT routing on the virtualbox so the connection goes through there.

-Gary

Thanks for the post Gary.
I'm in the process of setting up an Ubuntu dev server using VMWare. I've 
only got as far as getting the VM running and the server set up so this 
is a very timely post since it's the network share and DNS stuff that 
looks to be the tricky bits.
One thing I'd suggest is to use split rather than monolithic files since 
at ~2GB they can be more handily backed up.
I'll post back with how I make out on this. I use a VPN too (OpenVPN) 
and I have been able to remote access the VM. I did assign the VM a 
fixed IP in my router which I had to do to use port forwarding.
Cheers,
Herb

I've found VirtualBox to be a breeze to setup on my windows machine, so 
I didn't look further into other VM options.   I originally used a 
dynamic 10G drive, basically this means that the disk image can grow to 
10G but will only be as big as all the files on it - but I found 
performance rather lousy with that with all the disk space claims it had 
to keep making for logfiles and such.

I really want 1 single file as it allows me to simply zip and copy the 
file from the desktop to the laptop to switch work systems, and then 
swap it back.

Sometime in the next few weeks, I'm picking up a small 30G SSD drive and 
seeing if moving the disk image to SSD speeds things up noticeably.

Subject: [joomla] User profiles
Message-ID: <4E64D1C2.3040506@gmail.com>

I was wondering what people use for user profiles these days.

Back with Joomla 1.0 I used Community Builder and it was great.   
However, as Joomla has advanced, I was more and more turned off from 
Community Builder because CB maintains compatibility with Joomla 1.0, 
Mambo, and 1.5  - as such they re-implement a lot of features that are 
in Joomla 1.5 and now 1.6 because the other platforms did not have those 
features.

In the end, it just gets too confusing where CB is overriding Joomla and 
where it is working with Joomla.

I recently went a looked at CB again and see that it's features have 
advanced greatly...but it still has that cross platform issue.

JomSocial is another possibility, but it also suffers from waaaay to 
many features.


Are there any simple user profile components for Joomla?  Ones that only 
deal with user registration/profile and don't try to do thousands of 
other little things?

Gary,

If this is for Joomla 1.6+, have you looked at creating a user profile
plugin? More info at http://docs.joomla.org/Creating_a_profile_plugin

Jomsocial also has the worst support I have ever seen.
The refuse to answer questions, even when you pay for a subscription.

I'm having trouble with the e-mail icon working in Joomla 1.5.23. It  
won't send e-mail and I get the error message displayed, "E-mail could  
not be sent.".

Do the Mail Settings in Global Configurations control this? I have  
been playing around with those and they don't make a difference,  
meanwhile the RS Form Pro doesn't have any problem sending e-mail out.

Anyone have a fix for this or know what is going on? Thanks!

One suggestion,

If your using 1.5 is using k2. Out of the box you get user registration and
extra fields. I have extended that really easy.

You can extend the k2 reg and profiles with plugins or just hack the k2
core. And templating is easy

For 1.7 I have no idea I am one of those guys that fell behind at 1.6

Been there, done that.  It works fine and is fairly easy.   It is not, 
however, extremely extensible - I have to edit the code to make changes 
- which is fine for me but I really don't want the client calling me 
when they want to move a field up or add a simple text field.

Yeah, I inherited a website that did that.  And due to how the client 
approached the project, I further extended it.  But it's a royal mess of 
code AND K2 is not upgradable anymore.

I'd love to migrate them to 1.7 and a simpler process than have them 
keep asking me for minor, fiddly changes.

I'd also prefer to get them onto a "component" rather than just custom 
code it myself.

Hi Gary,

Not sure how simple you need, but you can use the UserMeta plugin to extend the jos_users table. Might be just what you need. Unfortunately I'm on my cell phone right now, but search for it and you should be able to find it. We extend it at PICnet as a base quite a bit.

Hi Folks,

Hope everyone had a great Labor Day Holiday.

and trademark.

Elin has been involved with the major Joomla upgrade which has been going on
this year. She will discuss where Joomla is headed and what you need to do
to prepare for it.

We will also celebrate Joomla's 6th Birthday. Steve Burge of Open Source
Training and author of the new Joomla! Explained book, wrote a nice short
blog post honoring Joomla's birth and it's growth. Would you believe Joomla
has been downloaded 25 million times!

And we will also hold the Lightning Round, were you ask the questions and
the group provides the answers.

I also want to remind everyone that Joomla Day NYC Weekend is on Oct. 22 and
23. The discount is no more, but you can still register. Even without the
discount, it is still a fantastic deal. To register

Hi Gang,

I have been scrambling to come up with some great swag to give away at the
Joomla NYC meeting this Thursday. As you know, we usually give away the
latest Joomla books and memberships to the excellent online video training
at JoomlaTraining.com

But this month, we have something very special to give away.

One lucky Joomla NYC meeting attendee will win a one-day intensive Joomla
training course from JoomlaTraining.com / OStraining.com and taught by
fellow Joomla NYC member, Laura Gordon. A $349 value.

The day-long training takes place in NYC on either Tuesday, Sept. 20 for
beginners or on Wednesday, Sept. 21 for intermediates. The winner will have
their choice of day.

To be eligible to win, you must attend the September Joomla NYC meeting this
Thursday. The winner is also the only one who can use this training. This
prize CANNOT be given away to clients, friends, relatives, neighbors, etc.
In a nutshell, if you win, you go.

As most members know, Laura Gordon is a veteran Joomla developer and one of
the nation's best Joomla instructors. She spent many years teaching
corporate types how to use Oracle databases, and has since started her own
company, RytechSites.com, specializing in Joomla websites. She has been
working with Joomla since version 1.0.

If you cannot make the meeting and are interested in taking a one-day
course, there are a few spots available. Visit
http://www.joomlatraining.com/new-york/ or
http://www.joomlatraining.com/new-york-intermediate/

I also want to thank JoomlaTraining.com (also known as OSTraining.com) for
supplying this great prize and for sponsoring the monthly Joomla NYC
meetings.

FYI: For those you haven't read my earlier message, the September Joomla NYC
Meeting is this Thursday, Sept. 8 at 6:30 PM at 146 West 65th Street. Visit
www.joomlanyc.org for directions.

Hope to see y'all on Thursday!

Hi Gang,

Another note about tomorrow night's Joomla NYC meeting.

Fellow Joomler Ted Shulman will be showing his latest project, floEarth.org.
The site is in the pre-launch stage and uses a wide variety of Joomla
components and modules, including JomSocial, Mosets Tree, Zoo, ProjectFork,
JoomBah Jobs, jVideoDirect Galleries, obSocialSummit, obFullTextRSS, and
much more. Ted demonstrates that you can use Joomla to make the World a
better place.

Speaking of better places, the second presenter, Elin Warring has been
working closely with the Joomla Project on the upcoming Joomla 2.5 release.
Yes, Joomla will jump from the current version 1.7 to version 2.5. Elin will
explain.

As previously announced, there will be a drawing for a one-day intensive
Joomla classroom training course from JoomlaTraining.com and taught by
Joomla NYC's own, Laura Gordon. Remember that you have to attend to win the
prize and take the class on either Tuesday, Sept. 20 (beginner) or
Wednesday, Sept. 21 (intermediate). The course will cover the latest Joomla
1.7 release. For more information visit http://www.joomlatraining.com

We will also celebrate Joomla's 6th birthday with cake and candles :-)

Remember to bring your Joomla questions for the Lightning Round.

I also want to mention that we are already working on the October, November
and December Joomla NYC meetings. If you want to present, please contact me
off list. We are always looking for folks to present interesting projects,
reviews and demos of components, modules and templates, 20-minute
how-to tutorials (like how to make a social media plug-in), etc. Basically
anything Joomla related.

The Joomla NYC Meeting is happening tomorrow - Thursday, Sept. 8 at 6:30 PM
at 146 West 65th Street. See www.joomlanyc.org for directions.

Also remember, Joomla Day NYC Weekend is Oct. 22 and 23. Register at
http://www.joomladaynyc.com

All best,

Steve

Depending on what version of Joomla your using, that can be a fairly 
simple plugin - not a component.  You just need to grab the save user 
event and check the password at that point.  I'd try to avoid the no 
reuse though, it's a real pain and just leads to users gaming the 
system[once I know the password cycle is X passwords, I just make X 
updates until I can set my preferred password].

I imagine there already is a plugin for this, just check the extensions 
directory.

Scott,

That extension will deal with a piece of it. I wrote the developer on 
Tues about tackling the rest. Have not heard back.

I've tried Easy Search, but it doesn't find some strings I know are  
there.

Anyone else have a back-end search for Joomla recommendation or method  
you use? In the past I've done mysqldumps and did a grep, but that  
isn't pretty and makes it difficult to know exactly where in Joomla it  
found it. Thanks!

Thanks for the suggestion, I just tried RS Search and it needs work,  
as it didn't return any search results.

The plug-in doesn't come enabled by default which is why I got no  
search results. It does return search results now, but none what I  
really need it for. I'm using RSFORM PRO and this search doesn't  
include the content of those forms. I can see why for security reasons  
it doesn't include them, but I need to be able to do back-end searches.

Subject: [joomla] Cache on or Cache off with Joomla 1.5?
Message-ID: <BB5603B9-8CC1-40AA-A9BA-DF68999009EB@gmail.com>

If a website isn't being updated more than once a week or so, it seems  
like a good idea to have cache on including the System plug-in built  
into Joomla. I thought I read someplace that it might be a problem  
with RS FORM PRO in terms of
performance, but I can't find it at the moment.

What are people experiences turing Cache on in Joomla? Is there a good  
reason not to? Thanks!

You can't cache forms in Joomla because you need a new token every time the form is displayed.

OK, and I assume there is no way to cache the rest of the non-form  
part of the Joomla site?

Joomla uses PHP caching.
You can also use post processing caching like Varnish

Of course you can cache whatever you like, depending on the cache system you use. 


Joomla has module caching, you can set it for each module in the Advanced Parameters section.

Joomla also has the cache setting in the global configuration, but I'm not familiar with how that works.

And you could have a third-party or custom cache.? This is where you need to remember that Joomla forms uses a token and can't be cached.


Some people will cache the whole site (except forms) for the public, and show the logged-in users the non-cached site.

If your site changes infrequently, you could produce static HTML pages from the Joomla site, and re-output the static pages when you make changes.

Donna is correct.
Varnish is not native to Joomla.
Our premium servers now use Varnish and we are getting great results.

Thanks for the explanation, Donna.

I found this on the RSFORM web site:

http://www.rsjoomla.com/support/documentation/view-article/474-my-forms-are-not-working-correctly-with-cache-enabled.html

Didn't realize how the forms work differently in Joomla with respect  
to cache and token.

Message-ID: <CABbkB_cX8addb_OVekyTEU2S_O85JHD4-H0jjEV985rdTrSzoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Question for you, I have been told that all government sites need to
disclose all cookies that are on their website, here is my question...

How can you 'disclose this', with the number of different components and how
they all work?

so where are the cookies in:
joomla
docman
rsforms
sobi2

Anyone else on a government site, and were able to overcome this
requirement, and how?

thanks,
Laura

Last I knew Joomla didn't use cookies. You can do a global search of your website files for code writing cookies and also check on Firefox to see what if any cookies you have.

Hi Laura

Are you referring to the ICO directive for websites hosted in EU jurisdictions?
http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/14473/google-analytics-and-the-eu-cookie-directive-who-will-fall-foul-of-the-law-goog

The UK seems to have extended the target enforcement date by a year,
it may not be pertinent for US gov websites (or I've posted an
irrelevant aside to the OP thread)

Thanks, Terry

Subject: [joomla] question about cookies in joomla
In-Reply-To: <CABbkB_cX8addb_OVekyTEU2S_O85JHD4-H0jjEV985rdTrSzoA@mail.gmail.com>
References: <CABbkB_cX8addb_OVekyTEU2S_O85JHD4-H0jjEV985rdTrSzoA@mail.gmail.com>

Joomla sets a session cookie.    The session cookie stores a unique 
string on your workstation which is then used to track you as a 
"visitor" to the site.  Properly behaving components will generally 
store any other data associated with your session in the session 
variable[though this does not work for all use cases, for example 
shopping carts may need to keep their own cookie set for your shopping cart]

You can use an extension like 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kbnfbcpkiaganjpcanopcgeoehkleeck?hc=search&hcp=main 
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kbnfbcpkiaganjpcanopcgeoehkleeck?hc=search&hcp=main>
to view the active cookies.

The session cookie name is an MD5 hash of logged in username, ip 
address, and some other info.  So it is practically meaningless.  As is 
it's value.  For example, on one website right now my session cookie 
value is:f5fc5356924c8ed30c9bca2ac70761bf and the name is equally 
meaningless.

In addition to the session cookie, if you have set the "remember me" 
flag there is also a remember me cookie saved with an encrypted version 
of your username and password.

Lastly, it's extremely difficult to disable these cookies...  though of 
course it can be done, for example:
http://www.commerce.gov/
Is a Drupal site which does not set a session cookie.

The session cookie is needed for user logon[or some really alternate 
method of logon has to be used] - but for anonymous users it can be done.

On the downside, it's not done yet, as evidenced by:
http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?p=2613084

My general understanding is that when they say disclose, they don't mean 
you have to specify the cookie names, you simply must specify what 
cookies are set, what they are for, and how long they last.  Something like:
http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/privacy.cfm

Gary,
Thanks for your reply!  Do you know if this session cookie only applies when
you are logged in to the system, or is it always enabled?

Only administrators login, not the general public.

thanks,
Laura

Assume that it always enabled - there was a lot of debate/discussion 
about it on those forum threads because the EU passed a law which 
specifically requires a website to ask BEFORE setting a session cookie, 
but Joomla sets the session cookie before the page is even displayed.

As near as I can tell, it's just not easy/convenient to disable this 
session cookie and because the law is so vague[and even the agencies 
which are supposed to enforce this law use multiple session cookies on 
their own websites] that I don't think absent any funding this will be a 
high priority to change.

Five Reasons to Try Joomla for Content Management
Now 25 million downloads strong, this free Web content management system has plenty to offer small and medium-sized businesses.
By Katherine Noyes
Sep 15, 2011 2:08 PM

There are numerous Web content management systems available out there to serve the needs of companies large and small, including numerous free and open source options. One that's figured prominently in the news this week, however, is Joomla, which is making headlines for the fact that it recently hit 25 million downloads.

Some 2.7 percent of the Web now runs on Joomla, according to research firm W3Techs, which translates into a market share of roughly 10 percent. WordPress is currently the market leader, running almost 15 percent of all websites, while Drupal comes in third with 1.7 percent of the Web. Though Joomla is the relative newcomer among these three leaders, it boasts Citibank, eBay, General Electric, Harvard University, Ikea, McDonald's and Sony among its enterprise users.

Does your company run a website? If so, here are a few reasons you may want to check out Joomla for yourself.

1. Powerful Core Features

A three-tiered content management system and WYSIWYG editor along with tools for managing syndication, templates, menus, integrated help and more all combine to make Joomla a robust platform for creating and building a variety of websites and Web-enabled applications. Recently added in the current version 1.7 are the ability to perform one-click updates and multilanguage improvements.

2. More Than 8,000 Extensions

Thanks to the ongoing efforts of a vital developer community, there are currently more than 8,000 free and paid extensions available to help you customize Joomla. A birthdays module, for example, shows a list of upcoming birthdays for a website's members; the Acajoom module, meanwhile, offers a powerful newsletter component.

3. Frequent Updates, Long-Term Support

Whereas Joomla 1.6 took three years to develop, the project introduced a six-month release cycle earlier this year, allowing new features to be added more regularly. Every third release, however, is considered a Long Term Support release (LTS), offering 18 months of security updates and bug fixes.

4. It's Free and Easy

Joomla is available for download at no cost, and it's designed to be easy to use for novices and experts alike. There's even an online guide available for absolute beginners.

5. It's Open Source

Since its inception in 2005, Joomla has been 100 percent community owned and operated. The software is free, open, and available to anyone under the GPL license. For business users, that brings a number of considerable benefits, as I've noted before.

Brian Proffitt, my colleague at Computerworld, recently compared Joomla with WordPress and Drupal and concluded that WordPress is best for beginners, Drupal is best for the most complex websites and Joomla is a good middle-of-the-road option that's powerful but still easy to use.

You can see for yourself by taking Joomla for a free test drive via an online demo or the Joomla JumpBox, which lets you run the software locally with a pre-built and pre-configured virtual application on Windows, Mac or Linux.

Excellent! Thank you!

This comes at a perfect time for me. I am trying to talk a potential client
to choose Joomla over WordPress (Her 15-year-old son claims to be WP
programmer!). And I know this article will help my case.

Hi All,

I'm building a site fashion-rental site  w/ Joomla 1.7. The site will have a
lot of products (over 1000) and categories and I was thinking about using
Zoo.  However users will need to be able to rent, purchase and reserve
products online.  Zoo doesn't seem to have an ecomm option, would that be
easy to integrate into Zoo.   I'm not locked into using Zoo btw?

Thanks in advance for any recommendations.

Using akeba backup this process is quite simple - and free... so then 
the only thing you might have to do is change a few path settings - give 
us a call and i'll see if we can walk you through it without any cost - 
and if we can't we'll go from there! (info at end of email)

hope that helps!

Anyone having problems uploading files to the media manager?  I'm trying to
upload mp4 files through the media manager, but am getting errors.  I
changed the options and added the extension the "Legal Extensions" & also
upped  the Maximum file size.   I could do a basic ftp, but I want to make
it so my client can do so without using an ftp client.

Hey Chris,

I wanted to get back to you on the Joomla work. The site examples you sent
look good.

The main site we need help on is a tradeshow website using the com-eventlist
module. We will need modifications to multiple forms, show listings and some
customizations. I can send you a list of tasks and you can let me know a
timeframe for completion.

Let me know if you are interested and I will send you the details.


Thanks,
John

Where did you change the Max limit, in php.ini? Sometimes on shared
hosting I've found that you need to make the php.ini local in the
Joomla installation directory for it to take effect.

What error messages are you getting and where? Is this in error_log?

You mean copy the php.ini file to the directory that joomla is in? Right
now the php.ini is in the root dir. The error is a "500 server error".  It
only happens on uploads more than 10mb. Lower than 10mb it uploads fine.


Thanks,

Hi Todd.

Yes, copy the php.ini file into the Joomla directory. This is what I
have on a shared web hosting account (Hostgator):

; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 64M

If this is not a shared web hosting account, you might have stop and
start the Apache server again for it to take effect.

Hope this helps, let us know.

Another thing to do, is place this PHP code on your website and name
it dummy.php:

<html><head><title>PHP Test</title></head>
<body>
<P>
<?php echo "Here are a complete list of PHP variables:<p>"; ?>
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
</body></html>

Then run it http://yourdomain.com/dummy.php

This will display all the settings that PHP has. Look in there and see
if it's picking up your Max size stuff. To make sure you have the
right field give it an odd number (if you can, I don't know if this is
your production website or not, hopefully it's the staging) and see if
that shows up when you run dummy.php.

Hi David,

Thank you! That worked. Yes I am using a shared host for this site and was
on the phone with tech support from godaddy, but they couldn't figure it
out.  Much appreciated as this was stumping me all day!

Thanks,

I had a similar problem a while ago.

I found I could add this line [ ini_set('memory_limit','32M'); ] to my
configuration.php and things worked fine.

<?php
ini_set('memory_limit','32M');
class JConfig

specific module positions - so you can have a mix of dynamic and cached 
content.

Subject: [joomla] Monthly Joomla NYC meeting reminder, #joomlanyc, and news!
Message-ID: <CABcNofMn0XZeyf=V6JMd5RQKt7hvEOWgtgroG1bb4x73DJk=fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Gang,

Just a gentle reminder that the Joomla NYC meeting takes place on Thursday,
Oct. 13 at the usual place - Lincoln Center, 146 West 65th Street. For
directions, see www.joomlanyc.org

The theme for this month's meeting is Joomla 1.7. Bring your J1.7/1.6
experiences and questions. There will also be a lightning round and I am
working on getting some swag as well. Laura Gordon is the chair.

Also, Joomla NYC is now on Twitter. Yes,  the Joomla NYC User Group has
finally joined the modern world! The account is @joomlanyc (natch!) If you
have Twitter, please join. Right now, we have 0 followers and you have a
chance to be the first one!

Note that the @joomlanyc Twitter account will augment the JoomlaNYC mailing
list. It's purpose is to send out short news items and reminders. We will
continue to use the mailing list for dispensing group information.

On to Joomla News.

SobiPro 1.0 has been released and like Sobi, it's FREE! You can get it at
http://sobipro.sigsiu.net/download/sobipro/52-SobiPro-Full

Speaking of upgrades and updates, here is an extensive review and screen
shots of the new VirtueMart 2.0  http://bit.ly/o5TXiN

Stackideas, which makes the excellent EasyBlog and EasyDiscuss extensions
are having a 30% off sale for the next three days. Use code STACKSALE30.
http://stackideas.com/blogs/entry/the-stackideas-super-sale.html

If you are looking for a good blog and want to stick with Joomla, EasyBlog
is worth consideration. It has many of the same features as WordPress and is
available at a 30% discount from the usual $59.

That's it for now. Hope to see everyone at Joomla Day Weekend Oct. 21/22/23
www.joomladaynyc.com

Remember to follow us on Twitter @JoomlaNYC

All best,

Steve

Subject: [joomla] Display headlines from tumblr in Joomla?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_YhjT2qo=iDuk1wm7XEh5mGRBFhLFwxNF1v3eohwOqXA@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone successfully displaying a list of headlines from their tumblr blog in
Joomla? If so, I'd appreciate a recommendation for the extension.

If you managed to do this yourself and are happy with it, please share your
experiences.

I've looked at tumblr.com's support pages and they have code to display
tumblr on other web pages, but I don't know yet if that's going to look
pretty in Joomla. I thought I would ask before messing with it. :-) Thanks!

David Roth
