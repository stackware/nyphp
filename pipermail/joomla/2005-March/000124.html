Yes, it's a rather largish deal. Remember, we want our clients to be able to do the day-to-day stuff while we do the real glitzy admin thingies. So if my client is going to put a bunch of stuff into the database I'd love for them to have a button that says &quot;back up database and site&quot; before they start on things. *I* can do it by hand in a variety of ways, but my client base, if it ever grows, might not be as phpAdmin savvy as we'd like. They may whack the entire thing and then ask me to recover it.

I'd rather *not* think about them having access to phpMyadmin, thank you...

ciao!
