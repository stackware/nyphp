Hello usual suspects,

I have a colleague here in NYC that is looking for someone to setup a
5-page site in Joomla for a company, this week. He's expecting a stock
J!1.5.7, a template from somewhere (I pointed him at Zappa from
JoomlaJunkie), and some basic setup (menu links, base articles).

I'm slammed at work and have no time to help him, and thought I'd
reach out to the group to see if anyone has an hour or two to spare.
Yes, this is a paying gig, but it is so small don't expect to retire
on it ;-)

Hi everyone,

Just to remind everyone that today is a holiday for some of us, and as
a courtesy we rescheduled to next Thursday. You can read all about it
here at the temporary NYCJUG website:

Thanks for the announcement Mitch.

Unfortunately I most likely won't be able to make it as next Thursday is
suppsed to be the hands on Voip lab at UniGroup, we'll be configuring
Asterisk and making VoiP calls (Anyone can bring their own laptop to
participate, or they can use one of the systems at Cooper Union to try it
out.

We'll also be making a virtual haunted house in Asterisk for Halloween!

UniGroup meets regularly on the 3rd Thursday of each month, so I can never
make any Joomla meeting on that day.

Thanks again for hosting!

I also wanted to say that I was surprised to see that the Joomla meeting was
rescheduled without any discussion on this list...?

I don't know of any other regularly meeting groups that reschedule in that
manner without first making sure it's not a conflict.

NYC JUG is a pretty small group, at least our meat space meetings are where
we have basically the same 6-8 each month. There is at least one other
UniGroup member among us, thus scheduling a meeting for this Thursday is a
conflict for at least 25% of our members, just from one other event alone.

Also, as of the day before the regularly scheduled meeting there was no word
at all on the list about whether it was happening at all, and the
announcement of a rescheduling only went out at 3:30PM on the day of the
regularly scheduled meeting.

I do like the new JoomlaNYC website, it has a basic 2.0 look to it (big
relief from the broken template) so props in order, Also having the last
meeting recap on the side bar is great, kudos on that too. Perhaps we can
take Robert Half off the sponsors list at the bottom of the front page.

So to sum, moving the meeting without talking about it first really sucks,
but the new website is kinda cool !

regards,

Hi Folks,

New to the list, we have recently relocated back to NYC after many years
away.

With limited experience with Joomla, I am very keen to get more involved in
the group to learn and share where I can.

The meeting would be great to attend, unfortunately for me, Tuesday and
Thursday nights  I have class in Brooklyn.

Looking forward to meeting with members when possible. We live here in
Manhattan.

Best regards - Bill Bly

To be blunt, we need to plan more than a couple days in advance. That
is really killing us as a group, as it is not possible to promote the
meetings, let alone know for sure when they are happening.

Now that we have a shiny new website (thanks to everyone involved),
I'd like to propose lining up talks for the rest of 2008 (there are
only a couple left, should not be too hard). With that out of the way,
we can actually promote the events, and start lining up talks for
2009.

One thing I always liked about NYPHP is that they seemed to be a
couple months ahead of the curve, and we should emulate that approach
as it has proven effective.

I also wonder if there would be any real interest in an
install/demo-fest from time to time, targeted at folks that have never
used Joomla but want to get it running, and see it in action. Anyone
have an opinion if that would be useful?

As for the last-second reschedule this month, to be honest I thought
it was discussed on the list. My apologies to everyone. To me it was
clear that holidays trump user group meetings, and was not aware that
the UniGroup meet was the following Thursday.

We definitely need to get November and December planned and on the
calendar so stuff like this no longer happens.

I agree 100%. I think an install feast would be a great way to help people.

Let's plan that for January or February and see if we can get a 
larger facility and promote it.

Absolutely, 100%, a Joomla Instalfest, planned in advance for Jan or Feb
would rock.

We should at least set the meeting dates and post them on the calendar.
Could be one of the first orders of bizniz at this next meeting. Anyone
have a holiday calendar?

With larger user groups, such as LILUG, that becomes a position to be
filled. With smaller groups, such as this, unfortunately, most of the
work falls on a few shoulders. Perhaps we need to consider a little more
organizational structure.

"last second" as in time -- like hours, minutes, seconds.

Good idea about the calendar.  D'oh!

Subject: [joomla] seo benefit from presentation
Message-ID: <1224257886.6459.48.camel@jersey>

Since Google elevates page relevance based upon outside links to a site,
it would benefit the presenters if the description of their presentation
linked back to their website.

Additional advantage could be gained by linking keywords in the
description back to specific pages within their website, and not just
the home page.

It might be too much to expect the site maintainer to do all of this.
Perhaps the presenter can give a description to use. keyword links could
either be indicated by submitting the description in html, or the
presenter could go in and edit the description to make the keyword links
afterward.

It seems to me that presenters should get some benefit from the work
they put in to making our meetings interesting and worthwhile

Now that we have a website, it would be cool if everyone LINKED TO IT.
Personally I would rather see more traffic sent off to joomlanyc.org

I will add it to my sites.
I also think we should have a place to list the founders of NYJUG and 
charter members. With a special mention for Gary.

Subject: [joomla] logistics for installfest
Message-ID: <1224446202.6459.97.camel@jersey>

For the planned installfest, what should be required for us to be able
to install for a newcomer?

hosted account?
What operating systems on hosted account

laptop?
What operating systems for a laptop?

Desktop pc?
Again, what operating systems? What would we do for kvm?

Would we be installing linux on laptops and desktops? Would it be easier
to just install vmware server and a virtual machine that has joomla in
such a case?

What about a desktop unit that can be dedicated henceforth as a server?
would we be wiping the hard drive to install linux, apache, php, mysql,
and joomla? I can work with debian and ubuntu. Haven't messed with
redhat for a while. What distro would we be working with?

What about macs? how would we handle those?

Perhaps we should put some time into planning this at the next meeting.

Best regards,
Mark

I've got a server we could use for this...  I could either point a domain name towards it and supply everyone access, or just bring it (and setup a lan)

Hi,

I could create a VPS if we need... I couldn't BRING it, but point some
DNS/etc if desired.

I suspect that if someone wanted help installing Joomla, they would
already have a place they wanted it but had no technical expertise in
getting it setup. Or, they have no idea what is needed in the first
place.

Then again, to me a Joomla-specific install fest sounds more like
templates and other extensions and not just the base package.

What is the expectation for an event like this, for a platform like this?

Regardless, if a blank slate is needed, let me know - it takes 5 minutes.

Hello All!
I have a site running phpbb with a CB bridge for integration. Is there a way
I can pull it into the main site rather than running it in another browser?
Is the Joomla phpbb forum actually a Joomla site, or is it a standalone
phpbb site?

Thanks in advance,
Marian Konop

For a base install, they'll need an account with a shared hosting
service that is a linux platform, supports php5, and has an available
mysql account? They'll need to know

ftp server:
ftp account:
ftp password

domain website url:

mysql database:
mysql database user:
mysql database password:

Anything else?

> Then again, to me a Joomla-specific install fest sounds more like

Then they'll need website url, admin password, and some idea of what
type of extension they are looking for. Anything else?

Will we be doing one at a time, or breaking up into groups with a base

will we need additional projectors?

It helps to get the requirements out there, once you know what you are
doing.

Exactly! I guess that'll depend on who we get the message out to. Either
we can set what we plan to do, or try to find out through some sort of
registration process what is expected / needed.

Hi, all.  The NYC JUG website has been updated as follows:

1.  Copies of the October 2008 presentations are now available on the site, in the Downloads section as well as in the Past Meetings article.

2.  Calendar has been installed and all registered members are able to submit and edit events.

3.  Weblinks Resources:  template clubs, Joomla! related sites, business sites, etc.  All registered members can submit weblinks.  There is also a category for active members to list their own site.

4.  We need a commenting system to add comments to the Meeting Recap.  Any suggestions?

Awesome! Just as I said at the meeting, three cheers for Donna. Well done!

As for comments, I have something that works with Joomla sites tied to
KickApps communities (uses KickApps to host the comments and ratings,
even for Joomla articles). I'm scared to recommend a Joomla extension,
as I hear horror stories every time I ask.

Ok Anthony, which one can be tolerated? :-)

As a non-NYC person playing with Joomla, I'll have to say you all really
know how to do stuff! The visual appeal of the site looks great, it's
easy to find useful info, and it heading towards my bookmark page...

I'm sure there are no comments extensions that meet Anthony's standards! ;-)

Also want to mention that registered members can upload to Docman, so if a presenter from a past meeting has material, they can add it to the site.  Or any other material that might be useful to the group.

Heads up folks, the following Joomla extensions have been shamed at
milw0rm (yes, they posted exploit code too):

* Archaic Binary Gallery - directory traversal vulnerability
* Kbase - SQL injection vulnerability

So if you are using either, best disable them pronto, then ask
questions later ;-)

* ionFiles 4.4.2 - file disclosure vulnerability
* Daily Message 1.0.3. - SQL injection vulnerability
* Nice Talk - SQL injection vulnerability

Sad, most likely all are making the same 2 or 3 mistakes, but some

	a section
Message-ID: <11230472.110781225072320801.JavaMail.coremail@bj163app110.163.com>

Hi all,

My case is:
http://phparch.cn/index.php/web/66-mobile/188

If you look at the top left module "XHTML MP  ...", 
and then go to another category under  the section "Web",
you will notice that module appears on every page  under the section "Web".

What I want to do is to limit the module to the category "Mobile" under "Web".

Anybody can tell me how to configure that?

Thank you very much.

 select * from jos_templates_menu;
+---------------+--------+-----------+
| template      | menuid | client_id |
+---------------+--------+-----------+
| rhuk_milkyway |      0 |         0 | 
| khepri        |      0 |         1 | 
+---------------+--------+-----------+

Seems the template "where munuid=0 and client_id=0" is the one to be used.

You can change that to the template name you want to use.

Does the jos_change_template URL parameter still work? If so, would that
help?

index.php?jos_change_template=madeyourweb

Thank you,
Ben

Ok folks, looking around for a decent lightbox/slimbox plugin for 1.5,
the only ones that look half decent are all commercial. There's
nothing FOSS to do this?

Just found Amy's slimbox plugin, doesn't seem to be able to embed
HTML, just references images like a phoo gallery. Hrmph. The search
continues!

Going with Thickbox+ for now, seems to do what I need. I'm building a
thickbox gallery of flash widgets, that are all pulled via HTML and
JavaScript. When it is up I'll link to it :-)
