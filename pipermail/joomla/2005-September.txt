The version is 4.5.2.  The howto can be found at: 
http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/mambo/2005-July/000261.html

The howto was written using version 4.5.1a Stable, I think.

Hey gang,

The new name is........................Joomla!

Yep, Joomla! is the official name for the new and improved Mambo.
After receiving thousands of ideas and concepts from the community, we
brought in some professionals to whittle down the list to the most
attractive choices.

This actually was the only one that passed the Trademark test, and
didn't mean something profane in French.

Here is the actual press release:

Award-winning Development Team Welcomes New Arrival -- Joomla!

The multi-award-winning team of core developers, that developed the
world's most popular content management system known as Mambo, has
changed the name of their software to Joomla!

Today, the development team unveiled the Joomla! project's new home at
www.joomla.org.

The Joomla! project announcement comes three weeks after the
development team unanimously voted to secure the project's future in
the spirit of open source software.

The development team formed Open Source Matters
(www.opensourcematters.org) to distribute information to users,
developers, web designers and the community in general.

Project leader Andrew Eddie made the announcement today, heralding the
forthcoming release of Joomla! 1.0.0, the team's first release under
the new structure and brand.

"This forthcoming release will be a celebration for everyone," Mr
Eddie said. "It marks the continuation of one of the best open source
software collaborations without commercial restraint or intervention."

He said the baby Joomla! would be a mature release of the project,
which includes rebranding, bug fixes and security patches. The Joomla!
roadmap about forthcoming releases of the project can be found at the
Joomla! website.

Core team member Brian Teeman said the release of Joomla! was
particularly important to the large user base, which had "supported us
through thick and thin".

"The community is now free to celebrate the new arrival and know the
project is in very safe hands indeed," Mr Teeman said.

The core team has been working very closely with the Software Freedom
Law Center (SFLC), in New York, to establish the Joomla! and Open
Source Matters entities. The SFLC provided legal representation and
other law related services to protect and advance free and open source
software.

"We are grateful for the excellent guidance and legal advice provided
-- at extremely short notice -- by Eben Moglen and his team at the
centre," Mr Teeman said.

"During Joomla's evolution, the project has received thousands of
emails, posts, letters and phone calls of support from people all over
the world," Mr Eddie said.

"The number of people expressing support is quite staggering --
including hobbyists, developers, third-party developers, web
designers, business owners, teachers, students, even members of other
CMS projects ... the list goes on and on," he said.

"Now the word is out and Joomla! has been born, we are focussed on
continuing our award-winning work and taking the project to new
heights."

Joomla! website creation software is released under GNU Public
License. Read more at www.joomla.org and www.opensourcematters.org.

I have a joomla install (from its "maiden-name" days :-)
I was looking at the Poll Manager, and I was wondering
if anyone can advise me if this tool is adequate for
my next project, and how to do it...or what tool you would
suggest instead.

I want to do a pledge drive.  In appreciation of pledges,
we can honor people/give them recognition.

eg, there is one top honors, there are 2 near the top,
5 in the next group, then 12 in the next, 50 in the next.

(for a ludicrous example, if they win, we'll name
the building after them;second place, the lobby, etc. :-)


Option 1,
I was thinking of using something online to allow
people to pledge whatever they want, and to see
where they stand in the rankings, compared with
the honors that we will give them in exchange.
The drive goes until we have enough $$$.
The risk is not enough big bids/pledges.


Option 2,
we might set prices for specific honors.

This seems like it might work with Ma...Joomla.
However, I have more than 12 honors.
Certainly about 25.   It would be better to
give an option for infinitely variable pledges.


I realize that Joomla "Poll" might not allow an
individual to see his standings, but I could probably
hack into the DB and display it.

If anyone knows of OSS that can do this, could you
let me know?    OR if anyone would be interested in
working on an OSS pledge manager.....


Thanks
Seth

Hey everyone,

I know this is the NYC PHP/Joomla list, but since we're looking up the east
coast, I thought I'd pass this along.  We've got some openings for Joomla
developers (full-time) and want to spread the word.

Thanks,
Ryan

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Wanted:  A PHP developer with a cause
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The Details:

PICnet (http://www.picnet.net) is an energetic, innovative technology firm
changing the face of the online non-profit and political worlds.  We're
looking for a PHP coder with a cause, the kind of person who wants to put
their skills and passions to work for the public sector. 

With the 2006 campaign season right around the corner (and our workload
brimming), we're ramping up to get ready.  We're looking to add another
developer to our team who's ready to help build the future of online
campaigns. 

We're looking for a PHP/MySQL programmer that can wear multiple hats. He/she
will need to know PHP code flat out, and be knowledgeable of the Mambo open
source content management system. He/she'll need to be able to take a server
from scratch and build a LAMP architecture for Web based applications.  And
yes, they'll need to have design skills that go beyond "I think I've heard
of CSS before".

After all the hard work, they'll need to be willing to have fun:  come to
our softball games, play putt-putt golf in the hallways, and laugh at least
twice a workday.  The right applicant will not only have the basic tech
qualifications...

-PHP (especially Mambo/Joomla CMS experience a BIG plus)
-MySQL
-FreeBSD server experience

...but will truly enjoy working for the non-profit and political
marketplaces.  They've got to have heart.  They've got to be passionate
about politics, public service, and the social sector.  They should be the
kind of developer that reads Slashdot when they have time, but who is really
passionate about their political blogs. 

This position will start as a 40 hour per week contractor, and move to a
full-time employment position.  Rates are commensurate with experience.
We're located in downtown Washington, DC, and most work can be done via
telecommute with 1 to 2 days per week in the office.

So, if you think you fit the bill, or know someone who does, please send us
your resume, cover letter, salary history, and references to:

jobs<at sign here>picnet.net
ATTN:  Ryan Ozimek

Please, NO PHONE CALLS OR FAXES.  Applications will only be accepted via
email.  Forward where applicable.

The main forum is the best bet:  forum.joomla.org

We have a room for the different versions (Mambo, Joomla etc) here:

Sorry for the slow reply, been up to my eyeballs getting the new forge

We are using it at the moment, making sure everything works out and
that we can provide documentation to get everyone started.

Really nice, we can finally use cvs or subversion, and all the other
stuff just works (as opposed to the old forge, RIP).

Hey folks,

We just released 1.0, you can get the information and background here:

http://www.joomla.org/content/view/154/52/

There are a lot of nice little touches added, so it is more than just
a conversion from Mambo to Joomla! and rebranding and so on.
