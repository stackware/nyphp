Message-ID: <330532b60511140722p2cc839c5y8d46ca35d5fd78e5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Been quiet over here, as we are finally kicking the 1.1 release into
alpha and that means (drumroll) that it is time to start work on 1.2
:-D

That means I'd like to get some feedback from you on what your
environments are, and what databases you would like to see supported
by the core.

1.2 has our newfangled database connector approach, where each
database gets a native driver. Right now we are planning on providing
drivers for mysql, mysqli, and postgresql.

With that in mind, I got two questions for you:

1) If you are using MySQL, what version are you using in your
production environment?

2) Beyond MySQL, what other database(s) do you need support for?

Looking forward to your feedback, and excited to be getting this work underway!

Hey, Mitch,

Thanks for all the wonderful works!!

I am wondering if Joomla! can use adodb as database abstract layer for 
future development and about to take a closer look, and here comes your 
email!

We are currently use MySQL 4.0 and 4.1 for production, a new project 
will be out soon with MySQL 5.

Joomla! with PostgreSQL is certainly a PLUS, since it's another true 
enterprise level open source project.


Thanks again!  Cheers!

Best,

Keayi Cora

*spacemonkey listens to crickets

C'mon folks, are those the only databases that everyone is interested in?

4.1, moving to 5.0 eventually

PostgreSQL would be the only other DB I'd consider for a general CMS
backend...

I agree with Hans, Postgre and 5.0

I presume you've chosen not to go the abstraction route?

That presumption is correct ;-)

After working with several external libraries and performance testing,
we've decided that abstracting the abstraction layer just wasn't
justified. For us, we are taking a very ADOdb-like approach, and
providing database connectors/drivers as part of the core of the
system.

This is good news for everyone, as we are not tied to an external
library just to connect to a database, and also the community is free
to provide drivers for whatever data source they want - and this
includes 3rd party  developers as well.

A number of my sites are running mysql 3.23.  The hosting company don't 
plan to upgrade anytime soon,  although I will be mvcing these sites to 
a different hoster for just that reason.

I know this may raise a few eyebrows, but mssql wouldn't hurt either.

Hey Mitch,

We're sticking with MySQL: 4.x and moving to 5.0 later next year.  Other DB
support would be great though for clients that have incumbent systems they
can't move from.  Of them, the top choice would be, gulp, MS SQL.

Hi folks,

Been a long weekend here, the script kiddies found a remote exploit
and are now scouring the web for unpatched sites and installing
rootkits on the ones that are found. The attacks are now automated, so
all sites are encouraged to upgrade immediately.

The announcement can be found here:

Mitch,

Since it is impossible to download the patches at present,  what  can be 
disabled to prevent the critical exploits.

Thanks.

When I try to download a patch, it goes half way fast and then it stops. I 
do not have issues downloading from other sites. This is with IE and 
Firefox.

I download from a neighbor - my ISP is having issues. 

Is this the same issue

http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=870

And is this a valid manual patch:


$protects = array('_REQUEST', '_GET', '_POST', '_COOKIE', '_FILES', 
'_SERVER', '_ENV', 'GLOBALS', '_SESSION');

foreach ($protects as $protect) {
    if ( in_array($protect , array_keys($_REQUEST)) ||
         in_array($protect , array_keys($_GET)) ||
         in_array($protect , array_keys($_POST)) ||
         in_array($protect , array_keys($_COOKIE)) ||
         in_array($protect , array_keys($_FILES))) {
        die("Invalid Request.");
    }
} 



Thanks,

Kirill

Yup, that is the one. You can either patch or untar the new
distribution on top of your existing site (just remember to remove the
installation directory).

I would not just apply that one manual fix, as it really doesn't cover
the full scope of the problem.

Hey Alberto, nice save. Hopefully this should do the trick.

Subject: [joomla] Joomla (Mambo) Hack?
Message-ID: <9a69596ebc1e8a748ca59541d275ece4@musgrave.org>

Hello -

I installed Mambo about a year ago for a client and the night before 
Thanksgiving, the home page was defaced (and plenty of other files were 
uploaded to the server but didn't overwrite Mambo files).

I'm wondering if it is a Mambo exploit or not - I thought the list 
would know.  And if not, if there is directory of exploits and their 
descriptions so that I may determine what happened.

The hack was done by "A n o m a l y   1 n   t h e   S y s t e m C r E 
W" (A1TS).  Heard of these guys?

Mambo Version: Mambo 4.5.1a Stable [Three For Rum] 29/09/2004 20:11 GMT

Here's a screen-shot of what it looked like:
