of interest to the Joomla group, feel free to post about them and I'll 
add them to the Calendar.

Happy New Year.

Well, off to a late start due to ear infections passing from person to 
person, but everything has cleared up now for the most part.

So, this month we have a number of exciting meetings going on.

This Wednesday, at Robert Half Technology the Dreamweavers group will be 
having a presentation on Joomla by our very own Donna Marie Vincent!  
Looks very interesting and I'm only sorry I likely won't make it due to 
time commitments.

This Thursday is our own meeting at Robert Half Technology.  This month 
I'm hoping to focus a little more on the usability side of Joomla, so we 
will have discussions on Joomla in general, Content Management, IJoomla 
Magazine,  Dreamweaver and Joomla, and template troubleshooting!

Later in the month, the NYPHP has a very exciting topic for discussion, 
Web 2.0 mashups!

I've put all these items up on the Calendar on the site, as well as 
providing links to RSVP.  I will send out an email to those who have 
come to past meetings later in the day - if you have made it to a past 
meeting, than your name is already on the list so you can come to this 
one.  I'd appreciate an RSVP anyway just to know how many to expect, but 
if your not able to you can still come.

I'm also being a little proactive and putting up meetings for February 
and March so you can RSVP in advance if you wish.

2008 should be an exciting year, and I hope to see everyone at the next 
couple meetings!

-Gary

Well, I wrote up a brief summary for the next few months, saved it, and 
didn't hit the front page checkbox. 

So, I rewrote it, made it longer and more detailed, and it's up now.  
Also the link to RSVP is 
http://www.joomlanyc.org/index.php?option=com_attend_events&Itemid=19 - 
thanks for giving me a nudge Forest.

One thing I forgot to mention:
JUG library: If you have a book from the library, don't forget to add a 
review and bring the book to the meeting.  Also if there is a book you 
want to take a look at, let me know and I'll see if I can get it for the 
library(note: people who submit reviews will have their requests taken 
more seriously!!)

BTW, can I get a couple volunteers to handle backup coordination the day 
of the meeting just in case?  (We are now -1 day and counting of the 
"official" due date, but past experience is it is generally at LEAST -2 
weeks and has gone as far as -4 weeks.  In case anyone is wondering, yes 
I have been a weeee bit more scatterbrained than usual this past month 
or so in part due to this. And for those of you who are dense and don't 
understand what I'm talking about, it's a baby.  Official due date was 
January 8th.  Name currently leaning towards Laura Rose, as there are a 
preponderence of Laura's in our life, and a preponderous of Rose's in 
both our families.)

I've *never* used the builtin css editor, on any version of Joomla or
Mambo. I've always had an IDE on localhost, or opened up the CSS in a
console for remote sites.

> Is the css editor in the template manager working or something I should avoid for now?

I just prefer working with something that does syntax highlighting.
But what you bring up is a big deal, I'd check against Joomla 1.5 and
file it as a bug if you're still having issues.

Wow, that page looks a bit messed up in Firefox (2.0.0.11 on Mac).

It the Ideas Factory entry.  Something is off on the graphic and it 
pushes the right hand of the page all out of proportion with everything 
else.

Yep, those side bar boxes are totally bonkers in Safari as well as FF2
(both on Tiger.)

However I should add that the site seems fine in Lynx.   :-D

PACKT Publishing has an excellent book: Learning Joomla! 1.5 Extension
Development.

There is also Professional Joomla! from WROX

I can recommend both of them highly.

I have not read the WROX book except a brief overview in Borders and it 
seemed ok.

Packt's book is very good for learning the basics of component 
development.  Initially, I did not get much out of it, but I found it a 
handy, small reference guide later.

We(the NYC Joomla User Group) also have a copy of the Packt book in our 
library, so if you would like to come to the next meeting in February 
and borrow it, you can either return it at the meeting after that or 
mail it back.  The fee for borrowing is to write a review of the book on 
our website(http://www.joomlanyc.org) as well as on Amazon or the 
publishers website. :-)

Now, all of that said, these books are for /general/ Joomla component 
development.

Login, User Validation, and Registration are in fact a somewhat 
different kettle of fish.  As both of these require somewhat specialized 
knowledge of how the user database is configured. This also changes from 
version to version in a small respect.  Prior to Joomla 1.0.12 
password's were stored in an encrypted manner in the database.  From 
1.0.13 onwards, the encryption method changed slightly.

Rather than writing a component for these areas, you have 2 other options.

Option 1:
For both Joomla 1.0.13 and Joomla 1.5, install Community Builder and 
build a plugin for that.  Community Builder exposes some events for 
registration and logon that you can hook into if you wish to do 
something at those points.

For Joomla 1.5 there is no need for CB as 1.5 will provide you it's own 
event system for registration and logon.

The 1.5 system is much richer than the CB system, which stands to reason 
since it was created afterwards.  Note, you can't mix and match event 
systems currently.  CB will not trigger the Joomla events if someone is 
logged on or registers through CB.  And Joomla 1.5 doesn't trigger the 
CB plugins when someone registers or logs on through there.(a place for 
a good project: write a registration plugin for CB which triggers the 
Joomla registration plugins - and a corresponding logon plugin which 
triggers the CB logon plugins.

Note, after reviewing the 2 items, and I will need to do some testing 
that keeps getting put off, I feel that the only workable process for 
integrating CB and Joomla 1.5 is to send registrations through CB, thus 
gaining the processing power of CB to do all sorts of extra things, but 
have Joomla handle the logons - thus giving you the ability to use 
Joomla logon plugins)

Does anybody have any experience with mamblog? One of my clients is  
running it as part of community builder and it is pathetically slow

Congratulations to the Mom, welcome to the Girl, and a pat on the back
for the Dad :-)

And Leam, I'd suspect she's waaaay beyond the object-vs-functional
debate, and is clearly of framework origin *grin*

Subject: [joomla] Presentations, request for presentors
Message-ID: <4796559F.4000406@beezifies.com>

February shall be performance month, so I have lined up 3 presentors 
from last year who are all involved, to one degree or another, with 
sites that have higher traffic than your typical mom and pop sites.

For March, I'd like to discuss security and Joomla and/or web design.  
So I'm soliciting people here and now to present in March - anyone 
interested?  It doesn't have to be specifically Joomla related, but 
security related with some sort of tie in(for example, talking about 
processing credit card payments in online stores has a Joomla hook, even 
if you talk about it outside of Joomla).

For April, we will be discussing Content Management in general.  I'd 
like to have a presentation on Joomla 1.5 since it will have been out 
for a few months, along with a presentation on Drupal.  I'm also open to 
presentations on other open source CMS type systems(including wordpress 
and wikipedia) - so anyone who wishes to volunteer to talk about an open 
source, CMS like system feel free to notify me.

I think through April is enough advance planning.

Also if anyone has a small presentation(under 20 minutes) that they 
would be willing to place as a standby presentation for the future, that 
would be great to have some extra presentations in the works, so to 
speak, to handle the inevitable cancellations and late shows.
