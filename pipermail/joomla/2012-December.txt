Subject: [joomla] Search results question
Message-ID: <1354470570.12471.YahooMailNeo@web122304.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

I added a search module to my site, however,
the search results begin showing up as I type a search term
right on top of the existing page.? How can I prevent the search results
from showing up until I hit enter and go to a new page?

?

You can use the core Weblinks component.

Hey Paul,

On a side note, the current (secure) version of Joomla 2.5 is 2.5.8. I'd
highly recommend that you upgrade if possible. See
http://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5470-joomla-2-5-8-released.html
for
more details.

Best,

Subject: [joomla] Check Mark in CSS/HTML in Joomla?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv-=kHxGWaX98DVODzvQPp+F7-4g2Kv9y7G11UuHCt2frw@mail.gmail.com>

Instead of the usual bullet lists that are diamond-shaped, I've been
asked to make them check marks. Of course, nice looking check marks.
Anyone have suggestions on how to best accomplish this in Joomla? I
assume there should be a CSS solution to this, perhaps adding it to
editor.css (shape 5 template), but I've been unable to find an example
of this done where the check mark looks nice so it fits the font. Does
every font have a check mark symbol? So if, my font doesn't have a
check mark can a graphic be made to work with this nicely?

Of course, I want all this to be easy to use and look nice. (I also
badly want a piece of fudge too, but I will settle for figuring this
out for this evening. :-) )

Thanks!

Thanks for the post and the link, Geoffrey.

If I go with a graphic, I guess what I could do, after all the other
text is sized have it create a check mark in a word processor, do a
screen capture of it and make a gif out of it. Does this sound
reasonable?

I'm sure there's also a bunch online that you can grab and use, under an
open license.  Even if it's not exact, you can edit it for the client.

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv9JDPsS5gvcfp1eBpp2=HcDbzF_5qEXdWL3HZn2SAhSSw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm sure this is only happening to me. Or it sure feels like this. :-)

So in HTML through a custom HTML module in Joomla 2.5.8:
{vimeo}123456{/vimeo}

I want to center it, so I did this:

<CENTER>
{vimeo}123456{/vimeo}
</CENTER>

And it won't center. I did a View Source to look at what is on the
page, and sure enough, the CENTER is there but it's not working.
Likewise, I want to put two videos side by side doing this:

{vimeo}123456{/vimeo}{vimeo}654321{/vimeo}

and that doesn't work either.

What am I missing here? Is there some overriding CSS from Allvideos
(JoomlaWorks) that it controlling ignoring my simple and corrected
inserted <CENTER>?

No, I can't show you the web page, sorry, it's on an intranet. Thanks
for any insight into this!

I'd say use Firebug or Chrome's "Inspect Element" to see what CSS is
affecting the video - one of those will show you the list of attributes
applied to it, and you can narrow down the code that's causing it.  Chrome
will also let you alter it locally, so you can see what it will look like
if you change it, without actually changing the code on the site.

It may be a align issue, or it could be a Display (Block, inline, etc.)
issue.

Subject: [joomla] Adding custom libraries in Joomla
Message-ID: <CAC4OfRjYxyXSd3+Sx1CKGNqmeUvAea+A807Fpjdnm9pJpRKKHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hopefully I can fix my domain later today so I can publish my notes.  In
the meantime, I've been working on cleaning up some small plugins and
extensions so that they can be installed and used outside of the sites they
were built on.

This means moving classes to a common library, enabling the library, etc.

This dragged a bit as every time I thought it was done, I discovered
another little oddity in Joomla interactions.  As a first step to resolving
this, I've created an extremely simple demo package to use as a
model/skeleton for my real library.

An installable version of the package is located here:
https://github.com/garyamort/joomla-cms-hydra/raw/crafty-demo-library/package/package.tar.gz

And the entire source can be forked on Github:
https://github.com/garyamort/joomla-cms-hydra/tree/crafty-demo-library


The "library" consists of a single abstract class,
\crafty\demo\LibraryVersion which defines some class library version
related information as class constants - and then provides a few methods
for getting library information as strings.  It will be installed in the
libraries directory under crafty.demo

The plugin leverages JLoader exclusively - it uses JLoader to map the class
prefix \crafty\demo\ to the subdirectory libraries/crafty.demo.  NOTE: due
to deficiencies in the Joomla Plugin Helper the plugin class resides in the
global namespace.  Once installed, if the plugin is enabled the library is
available.  If the plugin is disabled, the library is unknown.

The module is simply used to show if the plugin is enabled or not. :-)  It
utilizes a call to class_exists to check for the
\crafty\demo\LibraryVersion class.  If it does not exist, a simple "class
does not exist" message is displayed.  If it does exist, then it will grab
some version information and display it to the user.

There is much that can be improved with this library, but rather than wait
for it to be "perfect" I figured I'd publish it now.   All code is under
the lesser GPL so others are free to fork it and extend it for their own
usage.

Message-ID: <CABr9Rmk+R32Zt4PGTQFheYWxgh06fX9C_vrspeJuXmSdfS5nyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is anyone familiar with CB Custom Query fields?  I've been asking how to
add a field to a CB profile that lists a user's Joomla member groups, and
I've been told it can be done, but the response from the CB community has
been slow / unhelpful.

What I am basically looking to do is display a listing of the Joomla user
groups that a user belongs to on their CB profile, and also on their Kunena
profile.  This way, if someone is a member of Team X, when they post on the
forums, anyone who reads the post will know they are a member of that group
automatically, without them needing to edit their signature, etc.  (It also
prevents someone from claiming to be a team member who is not, and someone
forgetting to add it to their profile.)

Joomla Groups.  The CB part is done already within CB, but there's specific
groups I want to keep OUT of CB, and handled only by Joomla itself.  These
are the ones I need to display on the user's profile.

well here is one way of getting the Joomla ACL list in  joomla 2.5.

$db = JFactory::getDbo();
$query = 'SELECT CONCAT( REPEAT(\'..\', COUNT(parent.id) - 1), node.title)
as text, node.id as value' . ' FROM #__usergroups AS node, #__usergroups AS
parent' . ' WHERE node.lft BETWEEN parent.lft AND parent.rgt' . ' GROUP BY
node.id' . ' ORDER BY node.lft';
$db -> setQuery($query);
$gtree = $db -> loadObjectList();

with that you can do whatever you want

Subject: [joomla] SEO in Joomla - Menu Manager's Site Meta Description vs
 Global Configuration's Meta Description?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv-UnLkSfj6DW5tZSg+a_uOqHoQn4pZQHyXJaFsNxfvrkw@mail.gmail.com>

In Joomla 2.5, there are two ways I see to put in SEO Meta Descriptions.

One is through the Menu Manger for the specific Menu ->Metadata
Options -> Meta Description.

The other is in the Global Configuration -> Metadata Settings -> Site
Meta Description.

OK, the big question here this Tuesday afternoon in Joomla Land, is
which of these has priority? If from the Menu Manager has all the Meta
Description filled in for each Menu item, is the Global
Configuration's Site Meta Description even need to be filled out? Does
Global only play an active role if it's filled out only and no where
else, so it mirrors the same Meta Description for every page from that
Joomla site?

I'm asking the question, because if all the other Menu Items have
their own nice Meta Descriptions I wouldn't want the Global taking
priority with respect to what gets put in the search engines.

Thanks for any insight into this puzzle for me.

Subject: [joomla] Nice Christmas gift from RedComponent
Message-ID: <CABcNofMzXKLhFOT405=cvUQMwTvVrL0QvJx3qoc0HGsP4cETcg@mail.gmail.com>

Hope that you are all enjoying the holidays.

I want to share a present with you.

Last night I received a message from RedComponent, the makers of RedShop,
offering all their extensions for free. (I am sure that many of you who are
registered at RedComponent to download jUpgrade received the same message.)

I visited RedComponent.com and discovered that you can download their
extensive extension product line, including RedShop, RedForm, RedEvent and
RedMember for free!

Now, don't get too excited because RedComponent is still charging for the
add-on modules, like shipping and payment gateways for RedShop, but most
are reasonably priced at $25 each. (Plus there is an additional 25%
discount.)

I have personally never used RedShop, but I have used RedForm (similar to
BreezyForms) and RedCompetition (a neat quiz/test component) and found both
to be of excellent quality. Tech support is also good, but I am not sure
how support will work for those products that they are giving away.

Earlier this year Scott Wolpow gave an overview of RedShop and liked it so
you are planning an e-commerce project, you might want to check it out.

And I want to wish Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah to everyone. 2013
looks like it's going to be a great year for Joomla! and Joomla NYC.

All best,

Steve

Message-ID: <CABr9Rmn=TFapNVyomXNTkr_-MUfb_oXbAJEBgWgg8NrJDkJe3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, and Happy Holidays!

I have an MP4 video I'd like to feature as an intro to one of my sites.  I
can embed the video properly into the site using good old HTML, and even
make it play automatically on loading, without an issue.

However, I'd like to go one step further - I'd like the video to appear in
a Lightbox / Shadowbox / other overlay system upon loading the page, play,
and then close.

I've looked around the JED, but I haven't seen anything that will auto-load
and play a video in a box.  Anyone have a lead on either an extension, or
HTML code, that will do this?

Thank you!

Thank you, Matt - that got me started, but there's two major details I
still can't figure out.

Sample page: http://www.knightrealms.com/mobile-oog/101-misc/402-video.html

1) I cannot get the video to pop up automatically on page load, despite the
setting in the link being set for this.

2) How can I get the box to close, when the video is done playing?

I believe other media boxes (Shadowbox, etc.) can do this - I was just
hoping there was an automated way to make it easy for a client, without
needing to delve into the code.  If it means rolling my sleeves up a bit,
so be it. :-)

Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv_uGdeas70dYiGeuPRbZ=3Ff7fEY6bpGvW2p7pV81E8MQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a Tumblr website I want to move to Joomla 2.5.8. I'm thinking about
how to duplicate the functionality of the blog. I'm not interested in
having the blog from Tumblr appear on a Joomla website, this is about doing
a total migration to Joomla from Tumblr. Tumblr has been good, but this
website needs things which Joomla does very well.

I have some thoughts about how to do what Tumblr did in Joomla and wanted
to share them to see if others have suggestions of things I might be
overlooking.

Tumblr main features:
Post a blog
Post a video
Post a photo
Post at a scheduled time
Tags
Ability to Share specific postings

For Joomla, each blog entry could be an Article. It would be posted in
chronology order with the most recent postings showing at the top on the
home page.

Any other tips or comments about this? Am I missing something from Tumblr
that needs to be done in Joomla? Thanks!
