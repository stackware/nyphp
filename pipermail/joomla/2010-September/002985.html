</I>&gt;<i> release was tagged again and a tarball was submitted to their internal
</I>&gt;<i> platform publishing system for distribution to the live site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A major hassle was dealing with all the database changes while active

</I>&gt;<i> while someone else was moving modules around, while someone else was
</I>&gt;<i> installing a plugin and assorted components and modules for something.
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, all Joomla admin activity was done on the development
</I>&gt;<i> server, and pushed back to the local development installs via
</I>&gt;<i> mysqldump.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pretty much did the same for the Jetsetter site for Gilt. That was a
</I>&gt;<i> much smaller team, and included some exotic tech so there was
</I>&gt;<i> additional complexity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before that I was involved with a project that had a pretty sweet
</I>&gt;<i> distribution tool made with phing, allowing you to say &quot;phing install
</I>&gt;<i> $storename&quot; and the following happened:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * svn export of stable tagged Joomla platform
</I>&gt;<i> * svn export of stable tagged commerce extensions suite
</I>&gt;<i> * svn export of $store data, media and static markup
</I>&gt;<i> * tar all this up and fling via scp to production or test servers,
</I>&gt;<i> which would automatically untar and install
</I>Sounds great Mitch.  I use svn for all my custom php development web 
apps (non cms/joomla/wordpress).  I have a few phing scripts to help 
assist me in the build.
I was thinking I would go with something very similar, where on the 
shared dev server, is where you would administer the site, including 
installing extensions.  There would be a custom page where an admin 
(super administrator) would be able to push changes back to the local 
development - not sure how I want to do this exactly since it involves 
files and mysql dump.  Instead of a push, might have a pull, where when 
a developer does an svn update locally, in addition I poll the dev 
server for the latest mysql AND extensions files.
That was awesome, but yeah code was tracked in what felt like was a
&gt;<i> bazillion places as a result...
</I>I hear ya.  Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress, etc, should address this issue, 
as I feel it is a major drawback for companies that develop with their 
code.  I know a lot of people are one man/woman shop, but once you 
develop on a team, things change fast.
