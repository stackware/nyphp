Subject: [joomla] No NYC Joomla User Group meeting tomorrow 4/17/2014
Message-ID: <00f201cf59ad$a29f31f0$e7dd95d0$@com>

Hi Everyone,

 

The New York City Joomla User Group has been meeting regularly on the third
Thursday of every month for some time now at Touro College. 

 

The Touro campus is closed this week for the Passover Holliday and  I have
not located  a suitable alternative space to meet this month.  

 

Therefore we will not be meeting tomorrow.

 

We are looking for a meeting space closer to Grand Central Terminal to
lessen travel time for commuters who wish to attend our meetings.  If anyone
has any suggestions for a free or inexpensive meeting venue please email me.
We do have money in our bank account saved from running profitable events.

 

Also, I am looking for more presenters for future meetings.  Let me know if
you can present or if you are interested in particular topic presentations.

 

Happy Passover!   Happy Easter!

 

P.S.  I will update www.joomlanyc.org soon after Hostgator resolves their
current network issues.  The server is currently unreachable.

 

Stewart

Hello everyone!!

 

Re Domain: josemiguelrodriguezmatos.net 

 

Menu bar, smart search box, enter a search hostos. When the page opens it
show html modules on right/left columns and on the actual search content
page it shows a module with an image and text "Tu acceso". 

 

QUESTION;

How Can I unpublished/remove the modules from the search page?

 

By the way - all the modules appearing in search page are assigned only to
main/home page [Module Assignment/Main Menu].

 

 

 

Best regards,

 

Marcos Miranda

Hola Marcos,

Try creating a hidden menu item for search.

Then, I believe you'll have a menu item where you can assign or not the
modules on every search related pages.
