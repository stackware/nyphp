<PRE>Mitch is dead on by saying its not as simple as J vs D.

Seems like this was the culmination of years of work by Drupal people in DC,
targeting and learning how to get government contracts. O'Reilly has a blog
post on how big these guys are thinking and how professionally they're doing
business:
<A HREF="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/10/whitehouse-switch-drupal-opensource.html">http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/10/whitehouse-switch-drupal-opensource.html</A>

&quot; ... don't underestimate the difficulty of doing business in Washington.
Procurement is done through a complex ballet understood by few open source
companies ... a big IT deployment like this requires coordination between
many companies, each providing a piece of the puzzle. According to
techpresident.com, no fewer than five firms were involved in the switch:
prime contractor General Dynamics Information Systems, Drupal specialists
Phase 2 and Acquia, hosting provider Terremark, and CDN-supplier Akamai.&quot;

FWIW, he agrees with Mitch's point about the social features:

&quot;Drupal has a huge library of user-contributed modules that will provide
functionality the White House can use to expand its social media
capabilities, with everything from super-scalable live chats to
multi-lingual support.&quot;

Drupal folk did <A HREF="http://recovery.gov">http://recovery.gov</A> and <A HREF="http://www.nysenate.gov">http://www.nysenate.gov</A> plus

The flip side is that Drupal has no commercial market to speak of - all the
money is in custom work.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While this is a bit of sour grapes, and I am overall thrilled to see a
</I>&gt;<i> high
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; profile website[the White House] switiching to an Open Source
</I>&gt;<i> CMS[Drupal],
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it does make me think a bit about just what is it with about Drupal that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes it penetrate a bit further at the government level.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/26/whitehouse_website_goes_open_source/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/26/whitehouse_website_goes_open_source/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By the same token, the local county spent the past 6 months building out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their tourism associated website.  In the end, the functionality leaves
</I>&gt;<i> me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; underwhelmed:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.ulstercountyalive.com/">http://www.ulstercountyalive.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, the lodging directory is fairly basic functionality - and no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rss feeds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have found Drupal to have a stronger community of tech geeks using it,
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a weaker community of functional users.  A lot of components for Drupal
</I>&gt;<i> tend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be &quot;proof of concept' type's, where I can see how they could be
</I>&gt;<i> extended
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to something functional, but their not quite there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Joomla, by contrast, has a lot of apps which from a technical perspective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are exactly the same but by changing labels and gearing, they are fully
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functional drop in apps to do something.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So why is Drupal making inroads while Joomla seems to be lagging?  Any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A note of research: Is there an advisory board for open source
</I>&gt;<i> technologies to the government, and if so who is participating there?
</I>&gt;<i> This is pretty much the case behind the White House website, AFAICT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, this is a good time to compare the state of Joomla versus
</I>&gt;<i> the state of Drupal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First off, I think Dries' blog post about the White House website
</I>&gt;<i> using Drupal is an absolute case study in how to perfectly word a
</I>&gt;<i> major success.  His tone, writing style, and message are all dead on
</I>&gt;<i> the money. Perfectly written.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Drupal is very aggressively growing their community as an area of
</I>&gt;<i> focus, and as such is generating tremendous buzz which in turn feeds
</I>&gt;<i> their efforts. As well, their approach with the 3PD market is totally
</I>&gt;<i> opposite what Joomla inherited from Mambo (albeit some major changes
</I>&gt;<i> these past years). Combine the two and comparatively there's not a
</I>&gt;<i> whole lot of outreach from the Joomla project, nor aggressive
</I>&gt;<i> encouragement or enabling of the community for advocacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, having a well-funded, well-connected business like Acquia is
</I>&gt;<i> high risk, high reward for Drupal, as they can focus all of their
</I>&gt;<i> efforts through one organization, making it easier to target events
</I>&gt;<i> and get the most out of their available resources. Joomla's commercial
</I>&gt;<i> developer community is distributed over many small, non-funded
</I>&gt;<i> businesses that simply don't have the media or executive clout; and
</I>&gt;<i> lack incentive to band together to be one larger resource to the
</I>&gt;<i> project (and community).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Joomla's defense, the project is a clear market leader and probably
</I>&gt;<i> does not see all that outreach work as priority; and it's clear from
</I>&gt;<i> the outside perspective that they are actively looking for more
</I>&gt;<i> volunteers to help with the project itself, and need those resources
</I>&gt;<i> for other things than outreach and PR. Different problems, I'd say.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Drupal - focus is gaining market share, has tons of developers
</I>&gt;<i> * Joomla - owns the market, focus is looking for more developers
</I>&gt;<i> (needs reorganization)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That also means Joomla will not be a &quot;hot topic&quot; while it is in a
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat low-key phase, working on all these relatively internal
</I>&gt;<i> issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One totally random point that is key: Drupal comes out of the box with
</I>&gt;<i> loads of social features, and Joomla has NONE by default. With
</I>&gt;<i> everyone scrambling to be the next big social media hype magnet, first
</I>&gt;<i> impressions will always lead them to the platform that has all the hip
</I>&gt;<i> and trendy features out of the box, and that ain't Joomla.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, my personal take is that Joomla needs to provide some of
</I>&gt;<i> these features at a bare minimum, and I do believe some of them are
</I>&gt;<i> targeted for 1.6 at least. Chances are, as the base Joomla
</I>&gt;<i> distribution closes that social feature gap with Drupal, this
</I>&gt;<i> perception will change.
