Subject: [joomla] need help with Lyftenbloggie
Message-ID: <AANLkTikc8+OW8vTvd=wnRGNnaZNaw4XAuFe5EbhtTLh-@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I have implemented LyftenBloggie on a site and I am having some issues and
was hoping someone with experience with this component can enlighten me.
First, I am unsure what settings to configure for the the Access Groups.
This is what I want:
Everyone can view the blog.
Only one person (Administrator level)is making entries, but any registered
user can make a comment.
Comments are to be moderated.
I set what I thought made sense to me:
Guest:System access-yes, everything else-No
Registered:System access, Author Access,Administrator Access-Yes, all else
-No
Admin and Super Admin: Yes to everything
The other groups do not apply since there are no users in those groups.

But I have the following issues:
For a Registered User:
When  you click on Edit on the Comment form, it goes to a page that says:"No
blog entries found in category Author"
Also, if I click on Cancel on the form it returns to the same page with a
Message:"Notice-Captcha code incorrect. Please enter a comment."
Which is the same message one would get if you clicked on submit without
filling anything out.

For the Administrator,  or the one making the Entries on the front-end,  I
have the same issues as I have for the registered user, PLUS
when you click on the user menu that takes you to the Blog Entry Form, it
takes  me to a tabbed form where New Entry is highlighted...that is fine.
But if you click on the Pending Entries or My Profile tab, it takes you to
the blog page with a Message:"Error Entry #0 Not Found".
The All Entries tab is fine.

I also have a question more generic to Joomla. How do I add a module to a
page that is generated by another module or component. For example, If a
Guest tries to comment on the blog, they will go to the comment form page
which asks them to login. If you click on the login link, it takes you to a
page to log-in or register. That page has no modules on it (like
navigation). In the address bar, it has a long string following the domain
name, (
domainname.com/component/user/login?return=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXBpdG9scGhvdG9pbnRlcmFjdGl2ZS5jb20vQkFTL2Jsb2cvMjAxMC8xMC8zMS82LWN1cGNha2Vz
).
I tried making an unused menu for a login page and add the nav module to it,
but it doesn't work.
Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me.
Ellen

Subject: [joomla] Meeting this month?
Message-ID: <AANLkTim_XP2mnSM5M+a_bSAE=BSz1qwGP0OQ_GEFKNC-@mail.gmail.com>

Just wanted to confirm that there will be a meeting this month on the 11th?
 Hope so since I have already scheduled my meager resources to come down
next week. :-)

Also figured I'd confirm that there will be a JoomlaDay event next month on
the fourth and fifth?  I was thinking back to the search plugin presentation
I gave and was thinking of offering a couple presentations if there is
interest in attending.

For day 1, at the "*Attendees of these workshops should be currently working
with Joomla! and be comfortable with installing components/modules...also
HTML experience is a plus!" level, I can do a presentation of "Joomla Plugin
Modding"... for the adventurous Joomla user that just needs to make a "small
tweak" to an existing plugin, an overview of what the plugin system is, how
it works, basic tools to use for editing plugins, and how to go about
figuring out what you need.*
*
*
*For day 2, at the "**These workshops will be dedicated to the 'hard core'
programmers! " level I would do a more in depth look at how component
developers can use the Joomla plugin system to create API's for their
app, extendible plugin points, etc.    Things that many developers roll
their own internally and end up making overly complicated, when Joomla
already provides a basic system to extend/enhance applications and make them
open for others to enhance.*
*
*
*Yeah, not the "sexy cool" stuff, but the basic nuts and bolts type stuff.*

Gary,

This sounds great. I am on the planning committee and at this moment
we are setting up the schedule and we are in need of programmer
sessions and can pencil you in for both days.

I'll be in touch.

My client has decided they do not really want an e-card.
What they want is for a person to choose a design, enter a greeting or 
note, add the recipients name and click submit.
The office will then print up the greeting and deliver it to the correct 
room or person.
I know I could use a cart, but I want to avoid checkout.
Any ideas?

An ecard where the "to" address is hardcoded to an office email
address......

ie, use the same system as ecards, but email them all to a single address
where it can then be printed out with the greeting/note and delivered by
hand.

Are you wanting to charge them for the card? If that's the case you
could roll with QuickCart from Rocket Theme:

  http://www.rockettheme.com/extensions-joomla/rokquickcart

If not, then you're just submitting a form and capturing it in
database right? Could use any of the form extensions to do that easily
enough. In situations like that I usually write a cronjob that fires
off a CSV export to an email address for human processing.

No charge for the card.
I do not want to have a checkout process.

They also have to be able to select the card.

As a follow up, since you said "now", I assumed you already had looked into
ecard systems.

http://www.sendcard.org/  seems to be the most popular open source, php
based ecard system currently out there.

As I mentioned, just change the submit form to make the "to" address a
hidden field and hardcode it to your office address.   Or you could simply
remove it entirely and change the code so when it emails the card it emails
it to the office address.

There are, of course, also a couple of Joomla solutions:

Their plan is to print out the card and hand it to the patient. This is 
a hospital and is just a nice thing they do.

I also need to make it easy for them to print it out, with the greetings.

I would suggest saving all the comments and exporting as CSV then doing 
a mail merge with MS Excel or Word.
If you can set up a odbc connection directly between MS office and the 
MySQL db that may even cut out the mail merge step in the process.

If they were getting many cards a day I would agree. My estimation is 
that they get 1 or 2 a month at most.

Hi,

I'm using the Jumi extension to run a small php file for the pages that hold a 
specific article.

It's all working fine on 1.5.21.

My question: where should I store the php file on the server? I don't want it 
erased by an upgrade process.

Currently I put it in media/system/js/

Is that a good idea?

Thanks,

Larry
ps. Yes, the file checks that it is not being directly accessed.

"Tienda for Beginners" and "Advanced Tienda" on Saturday.

Gary Mort with present:

On Saturday - "Modifying Joomla Extensions or How to Tweak Extensions
So You Don't Have To Hire A Programmer"
Have you ever installed an plugin and it did 90% of what you wanted it
to do, but you had to spend hours trying to get the other 10%? Joomla
Programmer Gary Mort will show you how to make minor changes to Joomla
extensions so they will work for you.  We will be using Komodo
Edit[the free open source programmers editor,
http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit] and Navicat Lite for MySQL

this session - though you are free to use your own favorite editor and
mysql tools.

On Sunday - "Take Advantage of Joomla's Extension and Plug-In API"

Don't reinvent the wheel when you develop a custom Joomla component,
use the functions that are already built into Joomla's native
framework. Gary Mort will show you how.
We will be using the Netbeans IDE[the free open source programmers
IDE, http://www.netbeans.org] and Navicat Lite for MySQL
[http://navicat.com/en/products/navicat_mysql/mysql_overview.html] in

then staying till the meeting.

I was hoping to line up some interviews, but as that hasn't
happened(yet...hope springs a turtle)... I figure I'll have about 3-4 hours
this afternoon to kill before going to the meeting.

Besides my default of going to the B&N by Lincoln Center and working on
 modding the Ubuntu EBS image to pre-install Joomla and shrink it under the
10GB limit for the "free" Amazon AWS service tier.....is there anything new
and interesting that I should take the time to go see in the city?

I don't know about you, but I find it a GREAT idea and a lifesaver! I use it
when I need some snippets of HTML to go somewhere but not everywhere in my
site.

I had a Joomla website that had built with a RocketTheme theme. Main body
was turned off throught the template administrator.

Client asked for a title on the mainpage. Option was creating a custom HTML
module and placing it on the top of the page. A little CSS and there I had
my title. *Quite easy!*

I agree, sometimes the custom html is the way to go...depends on the
site...depends on the client...

The short answer is that you can do everything you do with a custom html
module by creating a content item and using the ultimate content display
module to display it.

Plus as an added bonus, now your client can actually change and update it
without having to know how Joomla works.

Note: I also discourage the use of collapsible module positions in the
template, as this will affect the ability to cache content from those pages.

Collapsible module positions and custom html are good tools for rapid
prototyping/changing while designing the website.

Once the design is finalized, you can create multiple templates without
collapsible modules and replace all that custom html modules with the
ultimate content display module[or if it is a design element and not
content, place the design into a custom template]

Hello there

I was wondering if the mailing list members would be able to share
some entrepeneurial insight.  During the day I work at a commercial
CMS doing tech support and knowledge management, as a side business
I've established a part-time home business doing Joomla and Wordpress
consulting.  I would like my consulting business to be successful, and
am looking for an attorney to assist me with this endeavor.  I'm
willing to invest time/money/effort for this... but also would like to
keep costs at a minimum.

The initial requirements I'm looking for are
- able to practice law in state of CT, NJ/NY would be a plus
- some prior experience with business law as relates to IT consulting
- understands and accomodates that my target demographic is small
business owners/non-profits... am not looking for help to draft a 15
page contract to intimdate small business owners
- need help with
a) review of website development and maintenance contracts I've drafted
b) able and willing to represent me if I am sued by a future customer
c) able to review my consulting business and advise me of any
complications.  Filed myself in CT as an LLC this year, doing okay so
far.

I know a few people from the CT Joomla user group, and socially know a
few lawyers... but am not really sure how to best find an attorney as
described above.  Advised to ask referrals (hence the email), contact
the local BAR association, etc.  Working with a SCORE counselor, been
told this an attorney is a necessity.

So my question is, what are other Joomla or CMS consultants doing.. as
sole proprietors, 2-3 person shops, or larger, how much time/resources
do you invest in the legal side of things, or do you get away with
just using some straightforward and pre-emptive boilerplate contracts
tailored for your circumstances, what mistakes have you made.  I am
also willing to be told... do your homework/this isn't the correct
venue/etc :)

Many thanks, Terry

Subject: [joomla] Truly Bizarre
Message-ID: <4CE00DE5.4040805@wolpow.com>

The left and right module positions suddenly stopped appearing on one 
component in particular. It shows up on all the other pages and menu 
links on the site.
It also happened on both the dev site and the pre-production sites.
I reverted back to an earlier copy of the component and still no other 
left and right positions
And the site sues just one template throughout.
Any Ideas?

Are you looking for a lawyer because you need one, or are you looking
for one because that is what you think you need?

    http://tinyurl.com/39g278w

If incorporation and consulting agreements are all you are worried
about, there are TONs of free online resources that can get you
pointed in the right direction. As well for incorporation, there are
companies that can do that for you online at a surprisingly low cost,
and also ensure you do what you need for the incorporation to be legit
and complete.

DISCLAIMER: If you have delusions of grandeur with your shiny new
startup, and have plans of raising capital or bringing in an M&A
hotshot to get you bought by Yahoo or Microsoft someday, then you will
need to hire a corporate attorney and pay a lot more money than you
probably want to right now.

This is actually your first entrepreneurial test - either you're the
kind of person that does the research and legwork yourself to make the
right calls up front, or you find someone else to do it for you so you
can focus on what you do best. There is no one-size-fits-all answer,
you gotta pick the right one for you and your particular situation.

Just my advice, IANAL and all that. :-)

Hi Mitch

Many thanks for the response. I have filed and been registered as an
LLC, and have indeed several boilerplate agreements I have found on
the internet and customized for my needs.  I wanted to see if working
Joomla entrepeneurs thought that was enough, or review by a lawyer was
a worthwhile investment before actual usage.  I'm happy with it, which
is the minimum criteria I suppose.

Cheers, Terry

Subject: [joomla] Free Amazon AWS
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=PebbNF2VnifNFeYc3HX7A6nfGGBt=W=7s4Rq3@mail.gmail.com>

FYI, as a birthday gift to me[my birthday was October 20th and they
announced it on the 21st, clearly geared towards me!], Amazon has introduced
a new "free" pricing tier.

http://aws.amazon.com/free/

If you sign up for a new AWS developer account, you get a bunch of free
storage space and server time each month for a year.  Highlights are:

   - 750 hours of Amazon EC2 <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2> Linux Micro
   Instance usage (613 MB of memory and 32-bit and 64-bit platform support) ?
   enough hours to run continuously each month*
   - 10 GB of Amazon Elastic Block Storage <http://aws.amazon.com/ebs>, plus
   1 million I/Os, 1 GB of snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and
   1,000 snapshot Put Requests*
   - 5 GB of Amazon S3 storage <http://aws.amazon.com/s3>, 20,000 Get
   Requests, and 2,000 Put Requests*
   - 30 GB per of internet data transfer (15 GB of data transfer ?in? and 15
   GB of data transfer ?out? across all services except Amazon CloudFront)*



   -

So, basically you can run a VPS on their micro instance for free, equivalent
to a virtual linux server that you rent from others for upwards of 20$ a
month.

The only downside is that at the moment, most public EBS images are sized to
15GB, so you can't run that image all month long for free[though if you run
it for half the month, since that is 7.5GB on average for the month it will
be free!]

I am in the process of resizing the official Alestic Ubuntu images...my aim
is to fit them into a 5GB image so in theory you could run 2 of them and
only pay for the extra hours.  Also pre-installing a decent LAMP[and NAMP]
environment and maybe a one click Joomla/Drupal setup.

Note: I find that it is 613MB of memory DOES sometimes have a problem with
installing some of the heftier apps[it stalled on installing the Java based
Amazon EC2 tools] - so at times you will need to run the heftier small image
size where you get over 1.5GB of memory...  you can launch an EBS based AMI
from any Amazon package....but to take full advantage of them you need to
run them through the api or command line so you can attach your ephermeral
storage on boot.

Hi Gary -
It's Garysguide.org for various meetings and for jobs indeed.com and don't
forget meetup.com
The Drupal group can be found at groups.drupal.org/new-york-city - not that
we'd want to have anything to do with Drupal,
Good Luck!
Susan

Subject: [joomla] Community Builder vs JomSocial or other extension
Message-ID: <008d01cb88e0$aaa4a5c0$ffedf140$@covenanttek.com>

Hi All,
I've been evaluating Community Builder and JomSocial and I would love to
hear from anybody who has used either extension and what you think the
better extension is.
I'm primarily interested in extending the user registration form to gather
more info on registered users, integrate the user's list from Joomla to an
email app such as MailChimp, iContact or Campaign Manager and some type of
events manager. The client wants a single user registration that will sync
to the email opt in and access to events. 
Currently this site is using Events Registration Pro and phpList. My client
doesn't like phpList so we're going to move to another option. Events Reg
Pro apparently integrates with Community Builder and JomSocial looks like it
has its own events management system and both look like they integrate to
one or many of the clients preferred email apps.
Your thoughts on all this would be appreciated and if you think there is a
better approach please let me know.
Thanks much!
Herb

Hi All,
This is my day for questions :)
Has anyone used WordPress in Joomla? A client wants to move a Typepad blog
to WordPress and integrate the blog to an existing Joomla site. 
I see CorePHP has a component to integrate WP to J. Has anyone used it? Is
there a better method to do this?

Community Builder was "the" user profile extension when I first started, 4
years ago?  With Joomla 1.0.

Over time though, CB has not kept up with the times and it's expansion has
gone in directions I'm not thrilled with.  The main issue I have is CB is
built to be cross platform for Mambo, Joomla 1.0 and Joomla 1.5.  As such it
does not take advantage of the Joomla API and rerolls a lot of functions
that are built into Joomla - such as sanitizing html input and it has it's
own event/plugin system rather than re-using the Joomla API.

As a coder, this means I have to learn 2 distinct systems, Joomla and CB,
for no appreciable gain.

Add to this that CB does not have an API into their system[simple things
like retrieving user information should be possible with a decent API
similar to Joomla's] and at the end of the day I am no longer a fan of CB.

JomSocial seems from the outside to have made a lot of good decisions, it is
more up to date, and better integrated.  I have not perused their code, so I
can't really say if I am happy with it or not, but given a choice with
someone else paying the bill and I'd go with JomSocial.

Never ever ever migrate TO iContact.   iContact is fine as an ESP, better
than many in fact, but part of the reason they are better than many is that
they do not trust their clients existing subscriber lists and require all
subscribers to double opt in through their system.  Generally you lose
between 10% and 75% of your subscriber base if you require them to re-opt
in.  Industry average is around 30%.

MailChimp takes the approach of "trust first, big stick second" - so they
will trust you, but if there are an obscene number of spam complaints after
migrating they will shut you down[this can happen because people might have,
rather than unsubbing, put the current mail server on a block list....so out
of 1000 people, 100 of them might no longer be receiving email because they
'opted out' by blocking.  When you switch to a new email service, those 100
people will get the email again suddenly and if they all mark it as spam,
you have a 10% spam reporting rate....  Mailchimp is fully aware of this, so
for the first few sends they will assume a slightly higher than average rate
and will clean stuff off.]

Not sure about Campaign Manager...

In the end, I've not been thrilled with how any of the Email Service
Providers integrate with Joomla or any other CMS as you end up having 2 user
lists which are very disjointed.  For that reason, I'm actually setting up
my own ESP for myself, and can allow others to use it for moderate rates if
your interested.   It's for moderate email senders[under a million per
month] who don't require email template design handholding.

**blatant self promotion***
My purpose is I want a system where when someone unsubs, the user directory
in the CMS gets updated with that data.  That way if you have requirements
that people must subscribe in order to access the site, you can extend the
notification rules to flip the switch.

I also want to use the same system for system notices[password changes, new
forum posts, etc] so that one can view tracking information on those
posts[do you REALLY want to be sending out 1000 "new forum post" messages a
day if no one ever opens them?  And by the same token, if people DO open
them, your passing up the chance to place banner and tower ads in those
notifications to either cross promote other sites or services or have a
residual income stream]

It's almost ready for beta, so if your interested feel free to contact me.
 I figure rates will be about on par with Mailchimp.....so it is on the high
side for the lack of Mailchimps other advanced features, but it has a
different advanced feature set for CMS integration.
 ***end blatant self promotion***

I have a job similar to this coming up. 

What I thought I would go about it would be just keep the two separate,  something like joomla site at the main directory and the wordpress in something like blog/.

You would need two themes, wordpress and joomla,  

One problem with this is user comments, one way to solve this would be to use a service like disqus. 

This method you won't be able to put joomla modules on wordpress pages, but I assume if you are using wordpress you are doing so because authors are used to using to to write blog posts and that is why you are keeping it around. 

Trying to integrate them farther seems like a huge pain in the ass.

Thanks Chris.
I'm thinking I'm going to give CorePHP's extension a go. It looks like it
will help simplify the templating merge and provides user list integration
with JomSocial, allows Joomla content modules in WP posts and some other
features. 
Have a blessed Thanks Giving :)

Community Builder was "the" user profile extension when I first started, 4
years ago?  With Joomla 1.0.

Over time though, CB has not kept up with the times and it's expansion has
gone in directions I'm not thrilled with.  The main issue I have is CB is
built to be cross platform for Mambo, Joomla 1.0 and Joomla 1.5.  As such it
does not take advantage of the Joomla API and rerolls a lot of functions
that are built into Joomla - such as sanitizing html input and it has it's
own event/plugin system rather than re-using the Joomla API.

As a coder, this means I have to learn 2 distinct systems, Joomla and CB,
for no appreciable gain.

Add to this that CB does not have an API into their system[simple things
like retrieving user information should be possible with a decent API
similar to Joomla's] and at the end of the day I am no longer a fan of CB.

Never ever ever migrate TO iContact.   iContact is fine as an ESP, better

they do not trust their clients existing subscriber lists and require all

We have a request for users to be able to enter their name and phone number into a module and then be added to a list for SMS alerts. I looked into the extensions directory in the Phone / SMS category, but it looks like some are for visitors to a site to send messages, not for people to sign up to receive messages from the site. Does anyone recommend a particular extension for this function?

Hey there,

I had not factored in transportation and such, so now I'm thinking it makes
no sense for me to come back upstate Saturday evening after joomladay but
instead stay over in the city.

As such, I figured I'd post here to see if anyone can offer a spot to crash
late saturday night.....  Figure I might as well work out my options before
spending all night on a subway... :-)

SMS alerts from what?

IE what action when taken should trigger the alert?

Many of the SMS systems will/would provide the base for sending messages,
but the notification part would require a bit of coding[see my former
comment about the lovely drupal modules aka components for messaging and
notifications that I want to clone for Joomla]

Subject: [joomla] Registration for Joomla Day events?
Message-ID: <02a101cb8e7e$ac210620$04631260$@covenanttek.com>

Hi All,
I'm registered to attend Joomla Day but I don't see how I'm supposed to sign
up for specific events.
Is it first come/first serve seating or is there something I've missed.
Thanks,
Herb

Message-ID: <885370.89850.qm at web31507.mail.mud.yahoo.com>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

We have a request for users to be able to enter their name and phone number
into a module and then be added to a list for SMS alerts. I looked into the
extensions directory in the Phone / SMS category, but it looks like some are
for visitors to a site to send messages, not for people to sign up to
receive messages from the site. Does anyone recommend a particular extension
for this function?

Thanks,
Tamar

Just wanted to remind everyone about the book reviews section on the site, as 
well as the book discount from Packt: 
http://joomlanyc.org/resources/reviews/book-reviews

I just reviewed a template cookbook from Packt.  This book covers styling of 
pages not covered by commercial template clubs, such as the offline page, print 
page, error page, etc.

Packt makes a contribution to the Joomla! project with every book order.  The 
15% discount code for our group is: JNYCug15

We also have a component review section if anyone wants to contribute a review.
