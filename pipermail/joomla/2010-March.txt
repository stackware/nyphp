Wow. That may be the buggiest extension I have every tested.

I also liked the part where their support answers 9/10 requests with "please
give us superadmin access to your site."

Well sure, what's the problem with that? The login is admin, password

configuration question
I was testing out YooCarousel and it seems like I can link from the content

out modifying the code to work like the JoomlaJunkie Super slider to advance
the slide when clicking on the menu item in the control surface,  but also
on click go to same link as the content link e.g. if I put just one big
linked image in the content area using the plain list setting.

If I understand what you're asking, the answer is "yes".

Put a big image in the content article of the category being used to populate the carousel, and have the <a tags around the image, so when the that slide is shown, you can click the image and go to wherever.

Hi everyone,

There's a really cool conference going on in Connecticut at the CT Film

would be great if someone on the list here could show some folks how easy

Interested?  Shoot your information over to David Bonan at

Hi all,
I have a Request for Proposal for a website with the following functionality
requirements.
1.create opportunities for members to interact with each other via
chatrooms and webconferencing
2.provide webinars, podcasts and webcasts, both free and fee-based
3.web conferencing for members
4.creating and marketing a blog to develop wider interest in the
organization
5.creating an "ask the specialist" tool with appropriate security for people
to use the website as a confidential resource.

This is a much larger project than I usually deal with. My questions are:
1. Which Joomla extensions do you recommend to meet these various
requirements?
2.How would we deal with the "confidential" ask the specialist?
3. What server requirements (an area I am totally ignorant about) would be
needed?
4. Would anyone with experience in these functionalities want to mentor me?
I really want to do most of it myself but am concerned I might be going over
my head and would feel more confident having someone to turn to when I get
stuck. If so, what fee would you charge so I can factor it into my proposal?

Thanks,
Ellen

For webinars, podcasts, and webcasts I'd suggest youtube hosted videos with
hwdmediashare.  Note: put fee based ones off to phase 2, get things working
with free services than move on.

I would USE Kaltura with it's Joomla plugin.  I would set it up using the
commercial service, and then as a phase 1.5 setup my own private server
using their open source version[and hopefully 1.5 will be stable by then]

For chatrooms and web conferencing, I would integrate ARSC:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/arsc/

It has hooks in the code for integration already.... does not do web
conferencing or such, but you can grab code form some other chat
servers[AjaxChat has nice sound/smiley integration, but otherwise has lagged
behind].

See http://plan.catskillcrafting.com/projects/mommychats for a list of what
I am aiming for to make my wife happy.

Sobi, K2, Fabrik, or any other CCK component - most have a submit function
that can be restricted to only a few people to view.

If your hosting video offsite, you should be fine with most anything.

Make sure you are using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for any rich
media like videos, audio etc. If this site generates any real traffic
numbers, your bandwidth costs will be a killer; pushing all your big
files to a CDN will dramatically lower your monthly costs and provide
a better experience for your visitors.

Subject: [joomla] National master site to control state sites
Message-ID: <865303.89643.qm@web53802.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hello All,

Is it possible with Joomla to have a master site control content for several other sites with a similar layout? To be clear...
*) I would like to have mysite.com with national content as a master site with the mysite.com/administrator to control it.
*) I would also like to have mysite.com/newjersey which has the same layout as mysite.com but the banner logo and other content is different. And I want to be able to control that content via the mysite.com/administrator panel as well as the content for any other states. This includes turning modules on and off on certain state sites.

I know I could have several host accounts each setup with its own Joomla site, but I want to control everything from one admin panel.

Is this possible without custom coding?

Best regards,
Sean R Scott

Aren't webinars interactive?  The ones I've attended were.  There were multiple speakers and attendees could ask questions via audio or IM.  hwdvideoshare would not be able to handle them interactively.

It's been a little bit since I messed with joomla, but for bb kunena(I'm pretty sure a fork of fireboard) was relatively easy, and recently, within this year, was being updated. Just make sure your versions match.

You might want to consider a simple approach:

* one Joomla master
* separate templates for each state
* create a menu (with an unpublished module) linking to each "state"
content area

In the end you'll only have one website to manage, and each state can
have their own distinct look, content, and menus/modules.

Of course you can get as complicated as you want, but KISS always
seems to get to the finish line first :-)

Okay, let me rephrase :-)  Is there already an existing tool for adding purchase options to a K2 catalog?

Well, a not so silly response:

If you aren't expecting hundreds of sales, you can use
RokQuickCart[basically a simple implementation of the SimpleCart javascript
library] - it uses a content plugin and K2 will run content plugins.

So you just change your display template to embed the mambot code, and then
when the plugin runs it converts it to an add to cart button.

The downside of SimpleCart is it is easy to override the pricing options[ie,
since the price is in the javascript, one can change $50 to $5 and then
checkout] - so it has to be a low volume set of purchases where the seller
is going to check the prices paid in paypal and reject/refund anyone who
tries to get funny.

I was thinking of something similiar, but instead just attach a wildcard DNS
record to the website, and use some htaccess magic to transfer
ny.mydomain.com --> mydomain.com?template=ny [or whatever the template
override code is these days].

Then you just need to add a new template to match the new domain and
everything works. :-)

Make sure you are using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for any rich
media like videos, audio etc. If this site generates any real traffic
numbers, your bandwidth costs will be a killer; pushing all your big
files to a CDN will dramatically lower your monthly costs and provide
a better experience for your visitors.

No easy method.
I understand the need to control all by one admin.
I may be building a system for a lead generation which could meet your

Some folks swear by Amazon's S3, read about it here:

 http://aws.amazon.com/s3/

For my last site launch I used Panther Networks, now part of CDNetwork:

 http://www.us.cdnetworks.com/

That was a great rollout, fast performance, and will probably use them
in the future.

You can also investigate Akamai, EdgeCast and GoGrid (via almighty Google).

Subject: [joomla] Right (and left) modules not appearing in IE7 and IE8
Message-ID: <74664fa1003041123p42f6ddccyc03678745d209412@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there.

I have a Joomla site in a very embryonic stage (have not minimal or no
changes to default and commercial template), and have found after the
content manager has made some menu changes and article additions, that
modules on the right module no longer appear in IE7 and IE8, or Chrome.
http://www.terrykim.net/clients/kas/
Strangely, in Firefox 3 they do appear.

I have reverted to the default ja_purity and beez template to see if the
problem is due to a styling conflict with a commercial template used,
but the issue persists there as well.
I have also renamed the 'right' modules to be 'farright', and replaced the
api call in the index.php
  <?php if ($this->countModules('right')): ?>
  <!-- BEGIN: RIGHT COLUMN -->
  <div id="ja-col2">
   <jdoc:include type="modules" name="right" style="jarounded" />
  </div><br />
  <!-- END: RIGHT COLUMN -->
  <?php endif; ?>
to have 'farright' instead.  The issue still persists... and I am scratching
my head.  When I change the position of a visible module on the left, and
change it to right, it immediately disappears.  I have switched back to the
original state, and placed the modules back in the 'right' position.

Joomla 1.5.14, a minimum of components of modules installed (JCE
Administration, JComments, Linkr, JoomlaPack, no 3rd party modules, plugins
(Content -QTube, Content DDRFS, Content-Linkr, Content Roxbox, System -
JComments, User -JComments).  The customer has been playing around with the
banner component, adding, and then deleting a module.  At the moment, as of
a call I have just received from him, he says the left modules also are
disappearing from browsers other than FF3.6, and lo and behold, he is
correct.  Any ideas?

Thanks, Terry

Is this sort of thing a known exploit?

Anyone know if it has been fixed or not?

That is not even a joomla function.

Joomla functions would be options=com_something&task=sometask&q=something

It's more likely an exploit for some other set of PHP code and their just
scanning every website for it.

That is a VERY old issue from the PHP4 days... This script kiddie
should point their script over at Karjackistan or some such place
where everyone is still rocking Windows for Workgroups. Gah.

Is MAMP a good method for running Joomla locally on a Mac?

This is probably not an easy question because the underlying OS supports

yes, I use MAMP it is nice. 

you can go through the trouble with  using the local mysql and php but there are problems with it. 

plus sides to MAMP. 

easy switch back and forth from php4,5, phpmyadmin  if you like that as well.

If you're looking to rock more complex setups like memcache, xdebug
and whatnot feel free to check out MacPorts:

http://www.macports.org/

Basically gives me the same kind of power and control I'm used to on
my *nix systems.

MAMP is good, MAMP PRO is better and will give you all you need for quite a
while.

However, if you really start getting into dev heavily, I am afraid Mitch is
right about MacPorts.  After weeks of struggling and months of installing
"just one" app from source to do something, I am breezing through the
reinstall setup I was dreading using MacPorts.

If you find yourself compiling something from source, it's time to look into
MacPorts.  If your just doing MySQL/PHP MAMP is a solid solution.

Hi,


My log watch detected the following request on my Joomla site. --

    index.php?module=search&q=./../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

Is this sort of thing a known exploit?

Anyone know if it has been fixed or not?

Thanks,

That is not even a joomla function.

Joomla functions would be options=com_something&task=sometask&q=something

It's more likely an exploit for some other set of PHP code and their just
scanning every website for it.

That is a VERY old issue from the PHP4 days... This script kiddie
should point their script over at Karjackistan or some such place

Hi there. I am new to the list, and was wondering if anyone here can help me
decide on a solution for implementation of multi-site functionality across
domains for joomla.

We are running 10+ related websites on separate domains, and would like to
be able to reuse/share/synchronize and manage content items and more across
domains.  

We were looking into the SYNK extension:
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/5501/details

 as well as jentla:

Thanks!

I use XAMPP and am happy about it. I'm a designer, not a developer and it
suits me well. It can be installed on a pendrive, so you can have your
project on the go. I really don't know MAMP, but it's good to know you have
a choice.

Note: XAMPP upgraded to PHP 5.3 in their latest version.    PHP 5.3 /breaks/
many things in many open source applications.  I know Joomla didn't work
under it at one point[it looks like it does, but a few key features would
not].

Hopefully that's changed..but if not, you can download and install a version
of XAMP with PHP 5.2

Grumble...  I was just getting to love MacPorts but everything they have is
geared to PHP 5.3 as well.  I was able to install a PHP 5.2 port, but all
the other packages I wanted[ImageMAgick, Gmagick, etc] install 5.3 specific
versions.

Hi,
It was great to meet you all at the user group meeting this week.
I'm starting to dive in and have lots of questions.  Here's the first one...

How can I change the images that are installed with the template?
Is there a way to do it through the backend or do I have to reinstall 
the template with the new files I want?

Thanks,
Kam

your_joomla_directory/templates/*your_template_name*(beez)/images
Most of the images are there
templates/beez/images   the bees template has this path

I do it a different way via webmin ( unless you have root access
webmin wont help you)and if I have a bunch of images I just ftp them
to the directory

You can try the module eXtplorer which will give you gui windoze type interface

Ok, next question...
I just got off the phone with my clients hosting company.  They told me 
that their site is on a shared server.
I'm not sure if this server is the best for joomla.

Wondering if you all give tell me what hosting company you recommend for 
your clients.
I'd rather not dealing with the hosting on my end.  I would rather be 
able to guide my client to the right hosting company.
What do I need to look for in a host that will best support joomla and 
cms in general?

Thanks,
Kam

Well you need more than php.
You need tech support ,reliability and availability.
Then some kind soul at the isp decides to upgrade to PHP 5 , whatever
and breaks stuff at no extra change.
Or they wont install a package you need ..
and so one..
I believe Kam is talking about a shared "web site" not a shared virtual server.
I have a virtual server which gives me my own instance of Centos .
I can use their CPanel or roll my own which I do ..
I use http://jtl.net/vps.html which has the best tech support ever.
Real humans that speak english and can add an extra IP address or do
DNS whatever in a few minutes.
Generally if you hose Linux a tad or ten they will fix it or send you
in the right direction too at no charge.

my 2 cents

I don't have a client, just my own site.  I host through Dreamhost.  The
prices are good for shared, the support is great in my experience, and their
private stuff doesn't look to bad to my untrained eye.

I was assuming that generally, most reputable hosting providers provide 
support and have high availability (otherwise they wouldn't be in business 
for very long and wouldn't be reputable right?). I just think Joomla has 
no specific technical requirements, and that's what I meant.

I use Linode for my own virtual server needs.

I had a client whose webhosting account did not have PHP or MySQL.  They had nothing installed that accommodated scripting or db. When I called the hosting company they said most of their customers have a static site.


So that's what happens when you assume.

I took the original posting to mean "are there any other requirements 
outside of the usual requirements to run Joomla". Your example was about 
overlooking a basic technical requirement which I wasn'tn talking about.

On a low volume site, shared hosting is usually acceptable. If the
website gets high volume, the latency will inconvenience visitors, and
may adversely affect the goal of the website. If you need very fast page
loading, dedicated servers, virtual servers, or shared servers with very
few 'tenants' are the way to go.

Other things to consider:
Shared hosting can be very inexpensive, and for low volume websites,
this may be more sensible for your client.
Some shared hosts are easier to work with than others. I've found some
that are impossible - waiting hours or days for changes to take effect.
Some hosts may be a bit more difficult to get Joomla running on. For
instance, the host I generally use needs tweaks to the configuration in
order to get SEF working properly. Fortunately, there is documentation
that makes this fairly simple.

> >> I'm not sure if this server is the best for joomla.

That depends on the ease of working with the host, what they have in
documentation, and what they have running.

I will only run on a linux host. I have not tried running on a Windows
host.
You need:
PHP5 & MySQL

You also need a web server, and Apache is well documented, although you
heard at the meeting that lighttpd is favored by some.

What is best depends on what you are comfortable working with, what
performs adequately for the situation, and that the cost is reasonable
for the task.

There's an invitation for a brawl!

I am using 1&1 for some of my small clients, but others will scoff at
this. I've moved one off of GoDaddy because it was too hard for me to
work with that host, and from what I could see by other people's posts,
there were going to be bigger problems ahead.

So here's a practical suggestions: If you are considering a host, go to
the Joomla forums (at Joomla.org) and do a search on that host. You'll
see some of the issues that people have had. You'll get an idea if it is
workable, and how to deal with configuration and other 'problems'.

> >> I'd rather not dealing with the hosting on my end.

I know that feeling. But ...

It is far worse to have to deal with a host that just stinks. In my
experience, it is easier to move the client over to a host that is
better.

A lot better.

I'd never do it the other way again.

Ever!

Make of that what you will.

Well, it ain't all kittens and rainbows! ;)

You'll probably find it is quicker and easier to do it for them.

For Joomla, I covered that above. In general, I don't know.

Also on the hosting when the excrement hits the fan , its always going
to be your fault. All the problems with hosting end up on your plate
as bad web design performance etc etc etc.
Customers have this nasty habit of trying to save a few dollars a
month , yet spend your dollars in your (unpaid) time dealing with
issues associated with hosting.

To me shared hosting is ok for the non business impact sites, any site
that has the potential to impact business or expand and need SSL  and
or multiple apps like CRM and corp site and maybe even HR apps etc
then you need to be on a virtual server.

To this day it amazes me that folks who dev websites for a living
don't have their own (virtual) server online to work on.

You can't know how many times I have seen "well it looks fine on my
local .*.amp system. But when its on the internet its not the same
etc..
Or the background noise of whimpering and sobbing , and the moaning
death throes of hard drive about to become a recycling candidate.
"How much is data recovery"
"When my hard drive clicks does this mean its talking in Xhosa to me"
"I backed it up locally so that means you can still get it right"
"I can't back up my desktop does not have reverse"
"It's on the internet so its backed up"

I'm starting to lean to the point of wanting to set up a simplified

Of course then my mind goes off on all sorts of tangents and what was a
simple idea becomes complicated with thoughts of:

Following a Vertical Spacing philosophy:
http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm

Using CSS sprites:

And of course, using Base64 data uri for said sprite. :-)
Which means supporting a tool to build said CSS sprites when people want to
change them!

And of course, junking 90% of the  IE6/7 hacks and using pure CSS for most
design issues[does one REALLY need to make sure rounded corners works onIE6
using javascript?  Just let it devolve gracefully to a square box there].

So then simple becomes not so simple and I'm back off to the races of
complex design for no real gain.  *sigh*  KISS is really hard when you keep
falling into the trap of that last S.

As far as I know, there's no way you can do that through the backend. You
have to check the images inside the template folder
(template/name_of_the_template/images) and change whatever you want.

Basically, you have to overwrite the images that are being used with your
own images.

With some of the more complex template systems, this can be a real pain to
do.  I have found
http://www.joomlapraise.com/joomla/extensions/premium/template-parameters-interface.php
this
extension does a good job of making things "easy" for you by scanning for
all the images in use and giving you a UI to upload and replace images.

That is awesome, thanks Herb!

I run all my own machines, so shared hosting is a total unknown to me.

Hi ya'll!

I had a problem at a client two days ago, I've never had before with Joomla.

I made a change to the template index.php, saved and tried to upload the
file. No luck. I couldn't overwrite the file on the server side.I noticed
index.php permission on the server was 444(?) I changed the permission on
the server, then...INTERNAL SERVER ERROR! Only the administrator page could
be seen. Tried to change back the permission. NOTHING. I changed the
template through the manager, nothing happened. My client contacted their
host provider and soon things were back to as they were before.

I've done this a thousand times on the server I'm used to work with and had
never such a problem. Never found a 444, before though.

What can I do to avoid this, when there's a need to overwrite a file?

IT WAS SOOOOOOOO EMBARASSING!! I had that look "Do you know what you're
doing?"

When you changed the permissions, what did you change them to?  Many hosts won't let you use 777.

Web servers can be configured to block access to any files/directories that
are set to 777 as permission.

This is a "safety" check so that users can't accidentally expose their
directories.

I'm looking to put together a community site. I would like some
suggestions for extensions to use. You can be brief.

Here's what I'm looking to do:

Membership is to be free and anonymous. I don't want to store user's
email addresses.

Users should be able to post articles / stories, and categorize them if
they wish

Stories should be taggable, and need a search for the tags. Also tag
cloud.

Visitors should be able to commment on stories.

Need banner ads to bring revenue.

Thanks for you feedback.

Mark

Ok: Warning - don't set file permissions on your web server to 777!

There's some background material here:
http://docs.joomla.org/How_do_UNIX_file_permissions_work%3F

And the quick low down:
Files = 644
Directories = 755

I thought I would just use the standard Joomla content system, although
I might be better off using FlexiContent.

I don't see any advantage to using community builder.

Which brings up how tag clouds work:

Should they be
	1. based upon the frequency of key words in the content?
	2. based upon the frequency that key words are searched upon?
	3. based upon users tagging content with their own keywords?

What's out there to address these scenarios?

Hi All,
I found this in Akeeba Backkup's documentation and thought I would pass it
along as I hadn't heard about this before now.
Does anybody know if this is actually an issue when working in the backend?

" Google Chrome 4 introduced a feature where it permanently "remembers"
redirections. Since redirections
are a key component to the internal working of Joomla!T, using Google Chrome
4+ to administer your
Joomla!T site can lead to unexpected results. Therefore we strongly
recommend against using it for any
site administration tasks. Akeeba Backup includes workarounds for Chrome's
behaviour, but we can't
guarantee that anything else in Joomla! (including installation) will work
smoothy."

Ciao',
Herb

Howdy!
As I've been exploring the Fluid website I've discovered it is much more
than just good info on Ux but also provides an open source collection of
jquery based modules for rich interaction web sites (think igoogle and being
able to move modules around and order them on the page as you like).
For more Ux info I found another great site

In SOBI2 I want to do the following:
1) In Entry Configuration I do not want the Title field at all. 
Currently it is a required field.
2) Remove the two meta fields
3) Remove the Categories  requirement and that field
3) Remove the accept terms requirement

I am guessing it is somewhere in the registry?

I find it easier to use required fields for a different purpose and relabel
them.

I mean, after all, your going to have SOME one line text entry, so use that
for title and re-label it.

In this case not really, but I will think of something to make client happy.

I am using SOBI just for data entry that will populate a directory 
later. I suppose I could use it for first name or Last Name.

Thanks

sobi2.details.tmpl and sobi2.form.tmpl under the templates/default dir

You can change the page tiles,  under  Site Sittings,  Site Name, but this is a global setting that is  over written if you have  value under the  menu items page title.

I've enabled member login on a site and when I try to connect it gives 
me a 404 error:

	404 Not Found
	
	The server can not find the requested page:

	    www.ncstateguard.org/index.php (port 443)

	Please forward this error screen to www.ncstateguard.org's WebMaster.


Sadly, I am the web master. The machine is on a shared host. I have 
another site that is using member logins just fine.

Any ideas on where to look? Could it be the host config for port 443 on 
a virutalhost?

Thanks!

Looking at "Global Configuration" -> "Site" -> "Site Settings", SEF is 
off, after the last issues I had with it. mod_rewrite off, and "Add 
Suffix" on. Tried turning the last one off to no avail.

I did notice that the site is on 1.5.14, so I'll upgrade tonight and see 
if that helps.

I had forgotten how fun this stuff was...

Subject: [joomla] Training on live site
Message-ID: <901807.30008.qm@web31502.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

We provided a Joomla! training session a few months ago for a small business development center. Participants were mainly non-technical small business owners. During the day long session, we had the students create sites on USB flash drives. While we provided instructions after the session for moving a site from a flash drive to a live site, using Joomlapack, the procedure was too complicated for most participants. 

Question - Assuming we have a decent broadband connection and not more than a dozen participants, what is the best way to have students develop a site online, where they can easily make the site 'live' when they are ready? We have another training session scheduled for May.

Some students already have a static site that they want to replace, some have no site and no domain, and some have registered a domain name but have no site.

We looked into having a single account with a hosting company and using subdomains for each participant, but there doesn't appear to be a simple way to move the site to another account after. We could also talk to hosting companies about setting up multiple trial accounts each with our custom Joomla! install to start off with - that the students could decide whether to keep. The sites are not built completely from scratch - we install some extensions and do some configuration before students start. 

Looking for any suggestions.

Thanks,
Tamar

You could also build your own server, using scripts you could also 
automate all the database setup and Joomla installs.

Then you could just have the server at the office on your local network or 
colo it somewhere with a provider (if you colo offsite, you will have to 
make sure its secured).

Message-ID: <E8B0D42F-47AF-47F3-A0C1-BD846F96276B@theendrecords.com>

 So I have an interesting problem. 

I have a websites I develop on for a record label.  So there are many  Band/Artist pages on the sites.  I have run into a problem where i need to have lots of modules for each page and it is getting really annoying. publishing 20 of the same modules, with just a different section selected.

Basically each Band page, has a widget for twitter, and content items by section, photos  with a keyword etc. I am looking into a way where i could just have a few values passed by the template, where 1 module would pick up that  one value for instance if i had a twitter user name passed to a module  on load dynamically. it is a lot of repeating  and everytime i do this i know i have a bad design. 

Can anyone offer some advice, or point me in the right direction for this type of problem?

Chris

Here's what I would do. I'd create a new twitter module and publish it
for ALL band pages. The twitter module would look up the twitter
account for the band it was displaying (this would need to be cached
of course). Then rinse and repeat process for all the other modules
that would be displaying for each band.

In the end it will provide the most flexibility and be easiest to
manage, even if it means you will have higher development costs up
front.

If I wasn't busy with my real job I'd offer to code for MP3s. Right on!

Okay, so I'm a bit off. Neither site works if you try:

	https://mysite.org/index.php

I did get the one login problem worked around by making the Login 
Redirection Page "Select Item". Of course, that doesn't sound right, but 
it works.

The upgrade didn't fix anything.

Thoughts?

yea i figured I would be making  my own modules, I think my mental roadblock seems to be where to store the artist infomation and how to call it in the module.

Hi Brad,

I'm interested in the same functionality and posted just a week before your message with the subject, "National master site to control state sites". I got some good responses from regulars on the list namely Scott, Mitch, and Gary. See the brief summary of their responses below.

I was also referred to another extension by another developer:
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/multiple-sites/5550

I hope this helps!

If anyone knows of any sites and especially developers that have worked on these types of sites, please let us know.

Best regards,
Sean

Scott
may be "building a system for a lead generation which could meet your needs."

Mitch
* one Joomla master
* separate templates for each state
* create a menu (with an unpublished module) linking to each "state" content area

Gary
or something similiar [to Gary], but instead just attach a wildcard DNS record to the website, and use some htaccess magic to transfer ny.mydomain.com --> mydomain.com?template=ny [or whatever the template override code is these days].
Then you just need to add a new template to match the new domain and everything works. :-)

Multisite functionality Hi there. I am new to the list, and was wondering if anyone here can help me decide on a solution for implementation of multi-site functionality across domains for joomla.

We are running 10+ related websites on separate domains, and would like to be able to reuse/share/synchronize and manage content items and more across domains.  

We were looking into the SYNK extension: http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/5501/details

 as well as jentla:

Thanks!

Hi All,
I'm working on a website for a financial planner and I'm looking for
suggestions for financial calculator and other financial related
plugins/modules that I can use in the site (currency convertors, mortgage
calculators, etc). I've been looking over the offerings in the JED but I'm
hoping there may be other sources for a larger variety of functions. 
Thanks!

Hi Herbert - I can't seem to post to the group despite being a member and subscribed. I am working on an accountant's site and found that RSS feeds are nice to use for financial articles that auto update. I also have a stock ticker. You can embed any of that code in a custom module.

Currency converters and things like that are typically Java script and you can find them and embed them in a module too. I was trying to do a calorie counter on a health site and didn't have much luck with getting it working but I see all the scripts are available. Google mortgage calculator code and see what pops up.

Ref:     Error Msg 404

I just went through a similar-sounding situation. After I installed Joomla
(in my case at Godaddy.com) I was getting Error Msg 404 also.

It had to do with permissions that had not been done during the installation
procedure. Godaddy people  had to set access/read/write permissions properly
by hand at their end. When they did all the Error Msgs disappeared.

 Hope this helps.

Ok that is bizarre - I assume you're using firefox on osx right?

Did you install any administrator extensions by chance?

nope no admin extentions, and it shows on a few different pages the  install screen, and control panel screen. 

it is mostly just annoying, updating versions didn't fix the problem either.

I'm going to take a guess here, but perhaps there is a corrupted file?  
I suggest installing the latest/greatest version of Joomla in another  
directory and using the same MySQL database run it and see if the  
problem goes away.

Do you still have the problem with other web browsers on the Mac such  
as Safari or Google Chome? If that clears it up, re-install Firefox.

Hope this helps!
