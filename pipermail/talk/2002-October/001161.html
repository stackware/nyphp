Hi Anirudh,

This is a very effective way to handle large quantities of traffic, and
is needed with any DB/language/server/OS.  While Oracle supports a lot
of this as a shrink-wrapped package, there are limitations, and of
course price.  I've seen very effective implementations using
replication/MySQL/round-robin, and with a cost of only the hardware.  I
think most sites would be hard-pressed to saturate even two Pentium-4
MySQL servers with proper DB design. And scalability? Buy another
server and add an A record to your DNS.

&gt;<i> This is like a concept of having chain store where u have McDonald's
</I>&gt;<i> fast food available at New York, Syracuse and Seattle rather than all
</I>&gt;<i> have to go to New York only whether u live in Syracuse or Seattle. I
</I>&gt;<i> hope u all r getting what I mean.
</I>
But there's nothing like a NY Big Mac  :)

&gt;<i> So main point is whatever tech (Db, Scripting lang, Servers OS u use)
</I>&gt;<i> your software must have Strong RDBMS, Proper coding style, Robust
</I>&gt;<i> architecture maybe using SDDS tech. an other normal stuffs.
</I>&gt;<i> These concept can give u satisfactory solutions, otherwise there is
</I>&gt;<i> no such tech. in this world which can give u all at once without
</I>&gt;<i> having Distributed Database and/or multiprocessing. Also PHP guys
</I>&gt;<i> will say PHP is best, ASP will say ASP is the best bcoz it has these
</I>&gt;<i> facilities, same with DB and OS,
</I>
&gt;<i> ok ok we need to think in diff
</I>&gt;<i> direction and develop something new using existing tech :) not just
</I>&gt;<i> adhering to existing tools. 
</I>
Couldn't agree more,
