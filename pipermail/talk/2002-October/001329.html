<PRE>Large companies may choose JSP simply because Sun is a publicly traded
company that sells enterprise scale servers with JSP included and provides
active support for their products.  Brand name goes a long way in the
corporate world -- &quot;What company is behind PHP?  Trust our sensitive data
and transactions to an open source product? We should stick with what we
know.&quot;  In trying to convince a company to migrate to a LAMP server I was
recentky asked those very questions, so until IBM, Corel and the other &quot;big
names&quot; make some headway in their Linux campaigns, big business as a whole
may not be ready for PHP.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] CQHost and JSP vs. PHP
Date: 10-29-02 08:42

&gt;<i> I had an extremely bad experience with CQHost.  Poor uptime, poor
</I>communication.  My site was down for days at a time.

I was drawn to CQHost by the JSP support (and, in fact, I'm writing a JSP
version of LiquidClassifiedsXML right now - and have nowhere to host it, now
that I'm letting my CQHost account expire).

Ever wonder why PHP support is widely available while JSP support is offered
by relatively few hosts on hosting plans that cost less than $15/month?
(even though JSP appears to be far more popular with employers)

CQHost blamed its uptime problems on Resin, which it said was causing
resource utilization problems.  This seems plausible enough to me - I can
see that with client-side apps that Java tends to be a memory and processor
hog, and I believe that it behaves similarly on the server-side (see
<A HREF="http://www.chamas.com/bench/index.html">http://www.chamas.com/bench/index.html</A> and look, especially, at the red bars
indicating memory usage).

But I don't want to give the appearance of claiming that PHP is good while
JSP is bad.

My belief is that PHP tends to be better suited for small websites/companies
while JSP/servlets/EJBs tend to be better suited for large
websites/companies, particularly ones for which data loss or downtime can
have catastrophic implications.

I would use JSP/servlets/EJBs if I needed things like failover and message
queueing - probably important if I am processing trades.  I wouldn't want to
lose a few Soros Fund trades just because the server went down temporarily
(rather, I'd like them to go into a message queue, to be processed later
when the server comes back up).

I would use PHP if I needed to make a quick and cheap website that primarily
serves information as opposed to processing financial transactions.

But this is just my opinion; no doubt, lots of people on this list will
disagree with me.

And I'll note, before other people point this out, that at least one large
company appears to be adopting PHP:
<A HREF="http://public.yahoo.com/~radwin/talks/yahoo-phpcon2002.htm">http://public.yahoo.com/~radwin/talks/yahoo-phpcon2002.htm</A>

But as far as I can tell, the major Wall Street firms are big
JSP/servlet/EJB users rather than PHP users.
