<PRE>I had an extremely bad experience with CQHost.  Poor uptime, poor 
communication.  My site was down for days at a time.

I was drawn to CQHost by the JSP support (and, in fact, I'm writing a JSP 
version of LiquidClassifiedsXML right now - and have nowhere to host it, now 
that I'm letting my CQHost account expire).

Ever wonder why PHP support is widely available while JSP support is offered 
by relatively few hosts on hosting plans that cost less than $15/month? 
(even though JSP appears to be far more popular with employers)

CQHost blamed its uptime problems on Resin, which it said was causing 
resource utilization problems.  This seems plausible enough to me - I can 
see that with client-side apps that Java tends to be a memory and processor 
hog, and I believe that it behaves similarly on the server-side (see 
<A HREF="http://www.chamas.com/bench/index.html">http://www.chamas.com/bench/index.html</A> and look, especially, at the red bars 
indicating memory usage).

But I don't want to give the appearance of claiming that PHP is good while 
JSP is bad.

My belief is that PHP tends to be better suited for small websites/companies 
while JSP/servlets/EJBs tend to be better suited for large 
websites/companies, particularly ones for which data loss or downtime can 
have catastrophic implications.

I would use JSP/servlets/EJBs if I needed things like failover and message 
queueing - probably important if I am processing trades.  I wouldn't want to 
lose a few Soros Fund trades just because the server went down temporarily 
(rather, I'd like them to go into a message queue, to be processed later 
when the server comes back up).

I would use PHP if I needed to make a quick and cheap website that primarily 
serves information as opposed to processing financial transactions.

But this is just my opinion; no doubt, lots of people on this list will 
disagree with me.

And I'll note, before other people point this out, that at least one large 
company appears to be adopting PHP:

But as far as I can tell, the major Wall Street firms are big 
JSP/servlet/EJB users rather than PHP users.
