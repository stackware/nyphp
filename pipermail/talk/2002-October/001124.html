<PRE>I'd like to clear up some potential confusion about the term &quot;scalable&quot;.
See <A HREF="http://labs.google.com/glossary?q=scalable">http://labs.google.com/glossary?q=scalable</A> for some pretty good
definitions.
While we all agree (hopefully) about what scalable means, I think we're
talking about two different things that we're trying to scale.
You can talk about scalability of a web site in regards to:
1. Traffic and users - meaning if we get 100 times the traffic can we simply
add 100 times the hardware without the need make any significant changes to
the code/architecture.
2. Application complexity - meaning if we want to add more functionality to
the site, can we do so without making significant changes to the existing
code/architecture.

While I think it's obvious that LAP scale quite well in regards to traffic
(CCI proves this), I do agree that in regards to application complexity,
there are better solutions than PHP (though much more $$$$ to use and
probably slower)

My 2 cents.

Ophir

p.s.
Regarding MySQL breaking down, I do believe the problem was with
connections, not speed.
It just didn't hold up when trying to keep a few thousand simultaneous
connections to the MySQL server.
Oracle amazingly seems to do ok. It might slow down, but it doesn't
crash/die/freeze.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can scale LAMP (minus MySQL which is barely a database) to some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; degree, but it isn't really the best way to approach it.  PHP was not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; built to be an enterprise language.  The lack of the N-Tier model makes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it great for most sites, but true enterprise level needs would be better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approached with J2EE or .Net.  Using .Net or J2EE (Java) will make the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; final solution much easier to use, manage, scale, and deploy.  Though
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the word &quot;enterprise&quot; is thrown around too much and often isn't used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accurately, applications that truly are enterprise do need to take into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; account a lot of the advantages of the N-Tier model.  PHP has XML-RPC to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all remote calls in a distributed architecture if I remember correctly,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but it isn't very efficient.  For instance, Java's RMI (Remote Method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Invocation) implementation is much more robust for this purpose.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; must use PHP for an enterprise solution, use a strong RDBMS (MySQL is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definitely not in this category) and some form of load balancing or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clustering as opposed to an attempted distributed architecture w/ PHP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, Kyle, what is &quot;true enterprise level,&quot; then? A billion pageviews per
</I>&gt;<i> month? The 800B PV/month Ophir cited at CCI works out to about 300/second,
</I>&gt;<i> and I presume that doesn't include images or other static objects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tell me, where is the point that MySQL breaks down? Traffic?
</I>Functionality?
&gt;<i> I admit, MySQL doesn't have, say, the World's Greatest parallel
</I>hot-failover
&gt;<i> technology, but I don't think anyone would classify Oracle's efforts in
</I>this
&gt;<i> regard in that way either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong, I'm all for using the right tool for the job, and
</I>MySQL
&gt;<i> or PHP or Linux or Apache aren't each the right tool for every job. But if
</I>&gt;<i> you're going to insist that PHP or MySQL has problems, please point out
</I>&gt;<i> actual problems, instead of vague assertions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
