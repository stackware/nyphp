<PRE>This idea might hold promise for my needs.  I need to mull over.  I 
imagine I can maintain the &quot;subject path&quot; table at file time of  a new 
&quot;subject&quot; since this is a quick save query so tacking on the added time 
to backwalk the tree for the new &quot;subject&quot; to glean the necessary info 
to add to the &quot;subject path&quot; table would be hardly noticed.  I don't 
know how the sorting would be done with this design though.  If I want 
&quot;subject&quot; ordering within the tier, I may need to add a sortation 
weight.  The other thing would be, this design still needs multiple 
queries, for each level of each branch.

I'm thinking that since my requirements are:
   1. a parent can have many children of which can also have many children
   2. a child can have only 1 parent
   3. the tree query needs to display within an alpha sort on name 
within the tier

I might need to have a sort weight field which factors all these in when 
my entity is saved and generates a value which would allow a sort on the 
weight field to cause the query to retrieve the data in the right order 
with parents immediately followed by their children.  Then it is a 
simple matter durring display to do the necessary indenting as you 
interate through the result set.

</I>&gt;<i>I had to build a tree for a project, and I found that de-normalization worked rather well.  In my case i had a tree of &quot;subjects&quot;, therefore i created a &quot;subject path&quot; table with the following fields:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>id                      
</I>&gt;<i>parent_id              
</I>&gt;<i>subject_id_0            
</I>&gt;<i>subject_id_1            
</I>&gt;<i>subject_id_2            
</I>&gt;<i>subject_id_3            
</I>&gt;<i>subject_id_4            
</I>&gt;<i>subject_id_5            
</I>&gt;<i>subject_id_6            
</I>&gt;<i>subject_name_0         
</I>&gt;<i>subject_name_1         
</I>&gt;<i>subject_name_2         
</I>&gt;<i>subject_name_3         
</I>&gt;<i>subject_name_4         
</I>&gt;<i>subject_name_5         
</I>&gt;<i>subject_name_6         
</I>&gt;<i>narrowest_subject_id   
</I>&gt;<i>narrowest_subject_name 
</I>&gt;<i>full_name             
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>also, i had a subject table:
</I>&gt;<i>id
</I>&gt;<i>name 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I knew that I would never go over 7 levels in my tree, but i could always add more fields to the subject path table if necessary.  Anyway, from the subject table and from the id and parent id fields in the subject path table, i can derive all of the other fields for each row in the subject path table.  (this would be something you can do as a pre-processed script, because you wouldn't want to figure it out during run-time since it would slow your site down.)   And I used these de-normalized fields to create the tree on the website using very simple queries (ex. SELECT narrowest_subject_name from subject_path where parent_id = 5)

</I>&gt;<i>I have a table that establishes an entity that may have a parent from 
</I>&gt;<i>the same table.  I would like to display the data in a tree format where 
</I>&gt;<i>all items with a ParentID of 0 ( no parent ) are listed with children 
</I>&gt;<i>indented under the parent.  The nesting can be infinite, but 
</I>&gt;<i>realistically will only be 2 or 3 levels deep.  I can see how to do this 
</I>&gt;<i>through a whole series of queries, but can see how the performance of 
</I>&gt;<i>such a design could be very poor if there is a lot of items.  Looking 
</I>&gt;<i>for any ideas, even if they would require a table design mod to make the 
</I>&gt;<i>queries simpler.  The current design is a single table with ID, and 
</I>&gt;<i>ParentID and whatever other info needed for the item.
</I>&gt;<i>
