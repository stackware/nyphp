Subject: [nylug-announce] NYLUG Workshop: An introduction to RPMs, Friday 11/14 @ 6:15pm
Date: Tue, 11 Nov 2003 20:04:46 -0500
From: Ron Guerin &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">rguerin at nylug.org</A>&gt;
Reply-To: Announcements for NYLUG &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">nylug-announce at mail.nylug.org</A>&gt;
Organization: NYLUG
To: NYLUG Announcements &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">nylug-announce at nylug.org</A>&gt;

PLEASE NOTE:
   This event is at the World Financial Center Winter Garden, meeting up
   at the corner of Park Place and Broadway. NOT at IBM. 

WHAT ?
  An introduction to RPMs.  Specifically discussion will focus around
  learning how to *create* RPMs.  We are all aware of the power the RPM
  packaging system has.  Surprisingly, tapping the power of RPM is quite
  *easy*.  This, in turn allows for endless possibilities.  By creating
  your own RPMs, you may customize software to your desire, provide
  updates that your distribution has yet to provide (new Gaim all the
  time! no waiting!), and have the ability to support your distribution
  to the end of time (Red Hat Linux will ever die!).

WHO ?
  Sunny Dubey will be the speaker.  If you wish to speak as well, simply
  email him! (See below)

CONTACT ?
  Sunny Dubey:  sdubey at nylug dot org

WHEN ?
  6:15 PM
  Friday the 14th, Nov 2003
  (Sorry for the late announcement!!)

WHERE ?
  The &quot;Winter Garden&quot; in the World Financial Center of lower Manhattan
  (Insanely *lovely* area).

  However we are meeting on the corner of Broadway and Park Place before
  going there.  (MAPS: <A HREF="http://nylug.opencurve.org/location.html">http://nylug.opencurve.org/location.html</A> )

  There is a Duane Reade on the corner, you can't miss it !  Just look
  for a guy with a leather jacket, and holding a newspaper in his hands.
  (haha!)

DIRECTIONS ?
  Trains:  A, C, N, R, 2, 3, 4, 5
  Buses:  M1, M6, M15, M22, M103, B51, X25

  A &amp; C trains:
    Take the train to Chambers street.  Once you exit, you will 
    need to walk one block East towards Broadway.  Once you hit
    Broadway, simply walk 1 or 2 blocks south.

  N &amp; R trains:
    Take the train to City Hall.  Once you exit, you will simply 
    need to 1 block south.

  2 &amp; 3 trains:
    Take the train to Park Place.  Once you exit, you need to walk
    1 or 2 blocks towards Broadway.

  4 &amp; 5 trains:
    Take the train to Brooklyn Bridge City Hall.  You will need to
    walk East along the park.  Once you hit Broadway just walk 4 blocks
    down to Park Place.

  M1 &amp; M6 Buses (UPTOWN DIRECTION):
    Try to get off as near as possible to Park Place. and simply walk
    one block east to Broadway.

  M1 &amp; M6 Buses (DOWNTOWN DIRECTION):
    Try to get of as near as possible to Park Place. Nothing more
    needed!
