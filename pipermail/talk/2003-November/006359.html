<PRE>I was searching the SANS Institute's website looking for reported
(purported) PHP bugs.

When up popped s blurb about CAN-2003-0863. I knew that CANs are only
candidates for becoming a CVE (common vulnerability and exposure) but the
following made me want to look into it further.

&quot;CAN-2003-0863&quot; &quot;The php_check_safe_mode_include_dir function in
fopen_wrappers.c of PHP 4.3.x returns a success value (0) when the
safe_mode_include_dir variable is not specified in configuration, which
differs from the previous failure value and may allow remote attackers to
exploit file include vulnerabilities in PHP applications.&quot;

clicking on the link
(<A HREF="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0863">http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0863</A>)

took me to a page which gave the origin of the 'bug' report as coming from
<A HREF="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&amp;m=105839111204227">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&amp;m=105839111204227</A> 

And clicking on that link provided an email written by 
Michal Krause and dated 2003-07-16 7:46:43 
subject line:  &quot;PHP safe mode broken&quot;.

In the body of the email Krause states:
&quot;This behaviour could make older working setups insecure after upgrading
to PHP 4.3.x.

I tried to report this bug to PHP developers twice in last weeks, but I
didn't receive any answer.&quot;

I can remember thinking this looks bleak for me (as I had 
already upgraded from 4.2.2) and how could I mend my &quot;broken safe mode&quot;.

I thought to myself surely something as important as this will show up if
I search <A HREF="http://lists.php.net">http://lists.php.net</A> -- but I couldn't find any mention of it.

Then I thought maybe there was a response to his post. So, I went back to
bugtraq link above. There was indeed a response from Krause himself
stating:

&quot;To test it[his patch], create simple PHP script owned by some regular
user, which will try to include /etc/passwd for example.

&lt;?
echo(&quot;trying to read /etc/passwd&quot;);
include(&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;);
?&gt;  

This script should fail on safe mode error (when safe mode is enabled, of
course). &quot;

I couldn't believe my eyes -- this guy had it 180 degrees backwards -- or
did he? I searched Google again and found more about &quot;CAN-2003-0863&quot;. I
think I got something different than what comes up now -- namely
<A HREF="http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/12714">http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/12714</A> But that web page looks pretty
authoritative (after all ISS is the home of &quot;X-Force Research&quot;-- with a
name like that how could it be wrong?)

The ISS web page states:

&quot;Platforms Affected: 
Linux Any version
PHP 4.3 to 4.3.2
Unix Any version
Windows Any version


Remedy: 


No remedy available as of July 2003.


Consequences: 
Bypass Security &quot;

I'll just stop here -- I  have already gone on too long.

Anyway its no wonder people think PHP has security problems.

(also I apologize for going on and on -- but this gets me upset)
