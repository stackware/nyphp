An array is not a string. That's your problem.

As for thinking that there is a bug and your general approach to asking
questions, you should really take the time to read this:

<A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</A>

Specifically, this is relevant:

--------------------------------------------------
Don't claim that you have found a bug

When you are having problems with a piece of software, don't claim you
have found a bug unless you are very, very sure of your ground. Hint:
unless you can provide a source-code patch that fixes the problem, or a
regression test against a previous version that demonstrates incorrect
behavior, you are probably not sure enough.

Remember, there are a lot of other users that are not experiencing your
problem. Otherwise you would have learned about it while reading the
documentation and searching the Web (you did do that before complaining,
didn't you?). This means that very probably it is you who are doing
something wrong, not the software.

The people who wrote the software work very hard to make it work as well
as possible. If you claim you have found a bug, you'll be implying that
they did something wrong, and you will almost always offend them &#151; even
when you are correct. It's especially undiplomatic to yell &#147;bug&#148; in the
Subject line.

When asking your question, it is best to write as though you assume you
are doing something wrong, even if you are privately pretty sure you have
found an actual bug. If there really is a bug, you will hear about it in
the answer. Play it so the maintainers will want to apologize to you if
the bug is real, rather than so that you will owe them an apology if you
have messed up.
--------------------------------------------------

Hope that helps.

Chris
