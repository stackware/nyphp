Interesting... but did he, or anyone else, have a compelling reason to use Apache 2 in the pre-fork MPM?  As I understand it, Apache 2's architecture is significantly more complex, incurs more overhead, and as Rasmus pointed out, is not as well tested.  And, when combined with being more complex, this becomes exponentially more important - not to mention PHP's SAPI for Apache 2, is eh, new.  If you could run this by him over dinner tonight, that'd be great  :)
