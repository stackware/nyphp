That's a perfectly valid line of thought, and is exactly why MySQL will be getting stored procedures in the next major release.  MySQL/PGSQL are difference animals, at least for the moment, and excel in different areas.  You might even consider using both for a very large project.  That said, there is business logic and then there is business logic.  Pick the database(s) that are correct for the project, but don't pick something because of buzzwords (like &quot;business logic goes in stored procedures&quot;) and be sure to define your tasks well.

&gt;<i> I dont like this turn into another pg vs mysql thread. I like to hear

</I>
It's a tough call.  I still have not been romanced by PGSQL, but certainly see it's value.  As a side note, we'll be having a great presentation on PGSQL from one of the core developers in Jan or Feb.
