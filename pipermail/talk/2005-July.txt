It might be time to look in the classifieds.  =)

I'm not versed in what the market offers for FreeBSD or Linux, but $15 
an hour for PHP programming (even with benefits and retirement) sounds 
extremely low.

Well the whole thread was started because the guy who posted it, was asking

his team members. All of the need to get salary, as this guy runs a software

anyway see the marketing fundas. We must say  GOOGLE is helping guys to

One outstanding book that is really dedicated to OOP / Design Patterns is:

Matt Zandstra
PHP 5 Objects, Patterns, and Practice
Apress

I do not know it if sufficient if you're completely new to OOP.

Another recommended reading (but not that good) is:

Ed Lecky-Thompson et.al
Professional PHP 5
Wrox

Hope this helps

Oh, that's great! One module imports the free TIGER/Line census data
which has lat/long for every address in the US (right?), and the other
module does lookups on it.

Skip the Perl frontend, it shouldn't take more than a couple hours to
do this yourself in PHP.

Then again, $50 for 20,000 lookups is a pretty good deal, and you jump
directly to the fun part.

Bill,

 

The closing tag in this case is the same color as the opening tag, and is
the same color used in all "healthy" PHP scripts.  I still suspect that your
possibility is the best suspect, and perhaps my next step is to get a Zend
Developer editor.  I appreciate your offer to review the code, but it is 247
lines long and the List Moderator is currently blocking the posting of that
code on the list because of its length.

Phil,

 

I use Dreamweaver as well for php.  For certain syntax errors that it
catches, it displays the closing php tag (?>) in a lighter color to tell you
something is missing or added.  Maybe a missing or extra parenthesis or
bracket, or a missing or extra semi colon.  If the file is not too large,
just paste it into an email, and I will take a look.

Brian,

 

I did a Find Next on ";;" and found nothing, then a Find Next on ";" and
likewise found nothing suspicious.  I am using Macromedia's Dreamweaver
editor, which offers PHP editing with syntax coloring, but it did not
complain when I introduced the ";;" error.  I sense that this editor was not
designed for PHP but simply offers PHP editing as an add-on.  I'll
investigate Zend.  Thanks for the tip.

The way I usually find it is through Zend, but I'm assuming you're not using
Zend, or another editor with the red underlining on errors.  My only
suggestion would be to do a search for a ';;' (two semi-colors), or try out
Zend :D

Good luck.

Message-ID: <20050701142025.AC4DBA877D@virtu.nyphp.org>

My motivation for trying Seagull was to create a Model-View-Controller (MVC)
foundation for a system that I expected to grow substantially over time (I
accept the counter-MVC argument that MVC is overkill for simple
applications).  The cause of my fanaticism was a bad experience with
developing an otherwise advanced architecture for the client-server world
that didn't migrate easily to the web because of inappropriate code
segregation.

In the new system, it will be the database that characterizes the next layer
of the system, not content management.  There are content management plans
for the system, and these are based upon my experience with Documentum.
However, data structure, and not CMS considerations will drive the system.

Seagull comes with some very simple content management features, but all in
separate Seagull modules that you are free to discard.  I could not say that
CMS constrains Seagull in any way.

I have copied this to the Seagull list so that other Seagull developers can
offer their impressions.

I think the tie in is simply because, at the end of the day, when you
are done designing coding and testing (the part that the framework is
most useful for), most php applications will need to spit out
html/images/etc (content) which warrants the need for an
html/images/etc (content) management system of some kind...

I'd say install/try out the framework and ignore as much of the CMS as
you need to, to get your app done. The benefits of reusing the
framework code and the inherent coding methods will be an improvement
from coding the straight PHP way.

Then let me give you some friendly advice, becuase a good PHP/Bsd/Linux guy is worth more than $15 hour.

1. Drop the "Free" in BSD. Per the SAGE salary guidelines, last time I read them, Using FreeBSD lowered the average salary, all other things being equal. I've got nothing against FreeBSD, but it seems to have a dampening effect on peoples wallets.

2. If you want to be more of a web-site programmer, add MySQL and some Apache. Make sure you read Chris' security stuff. E-commerce is growing in a *big* way and small businesses will pick you up to configure things.

3. Learn an e-commerce package like OSCommerce. Much of the hard work is done, and you can really speed up your delivery time.

4. Donate your time to a worthy cause. This will give you a portfolio to show your prospective paying clients, give you experience dealing with non-technical clients, and give you references in case someone should ask for them.  :)

5. This one should have been first, but I always have a harder time expressing it. Find your vocation. A vocation is a calling--it is what you would do if money was no object and all the bills were paid. How would you spend your day? When you know your calling and are working in it your passion will be communicated to your clients. 


Just my thoughts. I believe you could work hard for the next year and probably double your rate.

ciao!

The lead developer of Seagull asked me to convey the following to the
members of the NY PHP list:

You may want to tell folks that within the next fews weeks the core of the
Seagull 
framework will be factored out, available as a separate download, and
currently 
included modules will be optional downloads.  The framework will include a 
system to incorporate downloadable 3rd party modules in a point + click
fashion 
similar to mambo, etc.

I'm going to chime in here because this is a topic that I find
upsetting.

I recently had a guy offer me 20 CD/hour to work as contractor
doing professional PHP programming work. After the exchange
rate, paying my own taxes and other expenses, etc., that boiled
down to doing professional programming work for minimum
wage. Which is ludicrous.

I'm no expert on these things, but I think there are two things
going on here. Kids, with no experience or education, that are
willing to work for peanuts or just for the "fun" of it, and the
overseas contingent. How is an American supposed to
compete with that and still have a decent quality of life?
Especially in a major city like NY, or on the west coast where
housing costs alone are to the moon.

I keep telling people that approach me with projects, and are
expecting to be able to get away with a rate similar to what
I've just described, you get what you pay for. Because I
don't know about the rest of this group, but I have not only
seen the quality of the code and database designs from
folks that are willing to work on the cheap, I've also had to
throw a lot of it in the trash and start over. I have even
considered registering domain names and selling myself
on this very idea: we-clean-up-after-[insert slur here].com.

If anyone reading this list is looking for an experienced,
well rounded developer (PHP,MySQL,Apache,Perl,Linux
or BSD Unix,X/HTML,CSS...), then contact me. If you want
to pay me $15 an hour, then please DO NOT contact me.
I am in the DC area, but am willing to relocate.

NY would be awesome.

The real money can be found in cleaning up the mess left behind by these 
$15/hr programmers when they discover they can't complete the job or 
finally realize that the money it isn't worth their time and bail out 
1/2 way through the project (or are fired by the client when they 
discover things are not going as planned).

It is still a rarity to find an experienced consultant who can do more 
than simply convert raw specifications to code. One that can effectively 
communicate with the client, foresee problems down the line, offer 
suggestions on how to avoid them, accurately spec out time and price for 
a job, and deliver quality work within the bounds of the estimate.

If someone is offering you only $20/hr and you know you are worth much 
more, politely decline their offer and move on to find other work with a 
client that is more in touch with reality. In the end, it will work out 
better for you and your client.

Message-ID: <20050701163330.60FB1A877D@virtu.nyphp.org>

My thanks to Bill Kamm who solved this one.  The problematic code was as
follows:

 

if ($input->submit) {

    if (empty($input->info_item->item_no)) {

        $aErrors['item_no'] = 'Please fill in a item_no';

    }

    if (empty($input->info_item->author)) {

        $aErrors['author'] = 'Please fill in an author number';

    }

    if (empty($input->info_item->item_text)) {

        $aErrors['item_text'] = 'Please fill in an item_text';

}

 

 

Bill's diagnosis was,

 

"You are missing a closing bracket for the first if statement.  Add one and
you should be OK.  How did I find this?  I removed chunks of code a little
at a time, waiting for the error message to change.  I first got rid of all
the comments, then started removing entire functions.  When I got to
validate(), the error went away, so I looked closer at that code and found
it."  

 

The problem was actually that the third nested if condition wasn't
terminated by a "}", but the PHP translator would not have made that
distinction.  Bill's determination was actually correct in that sense.

 

It is interesting that the PHP translator thought the problem was an
unexpected ";", but that was probably because it picked up a subsequent ";"
before it picked up a "}".

 

Case closed.

Bill,

 

The closing tag in this case is the same color as the opening tag, and is
the same color used in all "healthy" PHP scripts.  I still suspect that your
possibility is the best suspect, and perhaps my next step is to get a Zend
Developer editor.  I appreciate your offer to review the code, but it is 247
lines long and the List Moderator is currently blocking the posting of that
code on the list because of its length.

Phil,

 

I use Dreamweaver as well for php.  For certain syntax errors that it
catches, it displays the closing php tag (?>) in a lighter color to tell you
something is missing or added.  Maybe a missing or extra parenthesis or
bracket, or a missing or extra semi colon.  If the file is not too large,
just paste it into an email, and I will take a look.

Brian,

 

I did a Find Next on ";;" and found nothing, then a Find Next on ";" and
likewise found nothing suspicious.  I am using Macromedia's Dreamweaver
editor, which offers PHP editing with syntax coloring, but it did not
complain when I introduced the ";;" error.  I sense that this editor was not
designed for PHP but simply offers PHP editing as an add-on.  I'll
investigate Zend.  Thanks for the tip.

 

Phil

The way I usually find it is through Zend, but I'm assuming you're not using
Zend, or another editor with the red underlining on errors.  My only
suggestion would be to do a search for a ';;' (two semi-colors), or try out
Zend :D

Good luck.

Flavio - I tested your code and reproduced the same error message.

 

Brian - The extra ";" is the prime suspect, but two visual reviews have not
surfaced the problem.

 

Jeff - I suspect you are right about the missing (or extra) ";" further up
the code.  That makes sense.

 

Joseph - The suspects have been narrowed with the help of Flavio, Brian and
Jeff, but the problem is still unresolved.  What is the best way to send the
code - attachment or paste into e-mail?

what is seriously funny is that I work for a company in New Orleans and
live in Manhattan... 
Originally planned to work for a company here, but they all want people
to work for ~30k/year and if someone won't bother to actually fish for
real developers then I won't waste my time showing them my resume..
Granted I am not out there checking the posting daily.

Actually, went on some interviews here to talk with companies (where
they were offering a little less than I currently make) just to see what
the offices look like and the dress code was so I could have an idea if
I really wanted to not be a telecommuter anymore or not..

Anyway, what sites are people using to find good pay work here in the
city?
I don't like to waste time with companies who start off on the "low ball
estimate". To me, they are willing to screw you over from the start and
it also, to me, means they don't know exactly what they want.

Agreed.

And I'm willing to put more time in if the job pays more than $15/hour.  A 
high paying job will make me want to write good code, because I'm not 
thinking or stressing about how I'm going to pay my rent.

In any case, if anyone wants to hire me for part time coding, I will also 
work on the side :)

what is seriously funny is that I work for a company in New Orleans and
live in Manhattan... 
Originally planned to work for a company here, but they all want people
to work for ~30k/year and if someone won't bother to actually fish for
real developers then I won't waste my time showing them my resume..
Granted I am not out there checking the posting daily.

Actually, went on some interviews here to talk with companies (where
they were offering a little less than I currently make) just to see what
the offices look like and the dress code was so I could have an idea if
I really wanted to not be a telecommuter anymore or not..

Anyway, what sites are people using to find good pay work here in the
city?
I don't like to waste time with companies who start off on the "low ball
estimate". To me, they are willing to screw you over from the start and
it also, to me, means they don't know exactly what they want.

I dont think there's ever a time where I can't finish a job.  I never give 
up, so I might ask for an extension, but I dont think I've ever not been 
able to do something.

I can't afford that right now though.  And I think other people agree. 
I'm in South Jersey, and there's not much more opportunity down here.

Plus, I've still got one more semester in College, to which I still 
haven't learned much.  Does anyone else agree that College teaches you 
things you don't really need to know?  I've learned more on my own than 
anything...

I think once I have the degree, things will be different...

I think you need to be confident in the value of your services,  
understand what a fair rate is, and refuse to go below that.  There  
will always be people who want work for nothing.  What perpetuates  
their existence is that there are people who will give them something  
for nothing.

Much of this is right on... there needs to be a tone set about the professionalism of PHP developers.  While the actually act of writing code is being commoditized, there are added values any of use can give customers that add value.  I hope that everyone on this list stands fast on a real rate for real work.

It looks like they just wrote it out replacing each character (letter) 
with its octal value. You can go somewhere like http://asciitable.com/ 
to translate this stuff manually. If you want to parse it with PHP, you 
can use something like chr():

http://php.net/chr

I guess it's a similar idea to rot13 - it makes casual observation 
impossible, so someone has to actually want to read the code. Maybe they 
use vulgarities as variable names. :-)

If this is in the US (I realize other countries pay very little, and I 
don't want to be insensitive), then you should leave. I can't even think 
of a caveat to that. I suppose that if it's for a non-profit, and you 
consider your employment to be a cross between a paying job and a 
volunteer one, then it might be tolerable.

I despise companies that take advantage of their employees. There's no 
excuse for it - they only do it because they can get away with it. If 
they offer you a raise when you mention leaving, you should leave 
anyway. They've already committed their crime.

People that would pay you that poorly have absolutely no intentions of
treating you fairly.

I cannot possibly imagine professional developers getting paid $15/hr.
Especially when people sacking groceries make $15/hr.

I would recommend getting together with several other developers and
starting a more international presence. Specialize in a popular
technology, and if you are good you will be able to compete in a
global market.

I'm constantly lowering my bids, because I know I am competing with
firms in eastern europe and asia with much lower living costs. But
there is still plenty of business out there!

Huh? What crime?  If I offer someone $15 an hour to build me a website/cook a
gourmet meal/perform heart surgery and they agree, what have *I* done wrong?
Granted, I may get a crappy product/service but I may get a decent one
as well.

In my experience, if you can remove project managers, marketing types 
and others from the equation you can save. However, the less expensive a 
developer is, often the more detailed your specs need to be and the 
greater your supervision of the code.

I hired a contract information architect at the last contract position I 
was at. My employer told me they wanted someone onsite. I found the 
perfect person, hands on experience in everything the project would 
involve. His onsite rate was a lot higher than they wanted and his 
offsite rate slightly higher. They went with the offsite arrangement 
even though they had excluded other potential candidates earlier that 
would only do offsite.

So I think if you're somewhere like South Jersey you could potentially 
sell it as a benefit - "Sure, I can do the work for you onsite in 
Manhattan. My onsite rate is $75/hr. My offsite rate is $35/hr." Boy, 
not seeing you is going to look really attractive for all but the 
occasional meeting.

Thanks for your post in support of this thread Hans. One more quick
point to make is derived directly from your signature. And that is this:
Employers that are seeking out developers with AMP skills, and want
to cut corners on labor costs [by whatever method] are already using
technologies built from 1000s upon 1000s of hours of work by many
under appreciated people to bring operating systems, Web server
software, programming languages and database systems that do not,
except in the case of MySQL in a commercial environment, cost them
a single dime in license fees.

I'm not sure if this contributes to the mindset of company owners, IT
managers, HR departments, and the like, but if so...well, I think you can
draw your own conclusions on my opinions of such thinking.

To all PHPers, from the States at least, I say: enjoy the holiday. And to
those struggling to make a career out of this, no matter what your locale,
better things to come!

If I could find part time work that paid $20/hour OR paid by the project 
and the money was worth it, I would hop on it in a heart beat.  I love 
working from home, especially on weekends, my house is a very comforatable 
atmosphere ... AND, I do good work.  Where could I find this?

No argument there.  I just want to know what I have done wrong by
offering and retaining a person at $15 per hour.

IME, "part time work" might be your problem.  If I'm going to pay
someone 50/80/100 USD per hour, I don't expect them to be "part time".
If I need your help *now*, I don't want to hear "I'll be over as soon as
I get off from my day job".  I, and my clients, pay for that kind of
access.

As for paying "by project", it's all in how you approach them.  If you
say "I charge $X per hour and I can do Y" they will want to know how
long it takes you to do the project.  If you say "I can install Apache
for you (your website is extra) and it will costs $300" and they agree
to it, you just earned $300 to install an RPM.  One of my clients paid
$300 to have SpamAssassin installed.  Granted, the guy did a good job,
but I know it didn't take him $300/(15$/hour) = 20 hours to do it. It
didn't take the guy three hours to do it.

BTW, there *is* work in south Jersey. I've had a client near Eatontown for
years and I just picked up another one near there.  I can't pay the rent
on just those two but then I'm not located in south Jersey.

The reason I say part time is because I have to pay my bills and need a 
steady job.  If someone offered me a full time job, then of course I would 
probably switch if I was ready.

Wow ... I think I install things at work all day long, its like a 
repetitiveness for me ... mostly ports though :)  I just wish I could 
market everything I do ... I can do anti spam solutions, LDAP solutions, 
Webserver setup, configuration, custom PHP, database work, Mail server 
setup, etc. etc .... so much, I just wish I knew how to get work for it.

Well if you ever find anyone looking to hire for any kind of work related 
to the above, let me know :) I have resume and references :)

Nothing. For some people that isn't settling, that's the amount they're 
willing to take for the work they do (maybe they want to work from home, 
set their own hours, and that price works for them).

If we have problems with rates like that we have to differentiate 
ourselves so we can justify higher rates.

No, you don't need a steady job.  You need an income. I have bills to
pay and I don't have a steady job.  How do you think I pay them?  Right,
I have an income.

Well for starters, advertise!  I just did several Google searches for, as
an example, 'BSD consultant "new jersey" south' and I never once saw
your name.

This is not directed personally toward you Faber, but more a general
ethical issue that I have. Begin rant ;-)

If the going rate for something is $20, and you want one, and you have
$20, then you should find a good one that is suitable to your purposes
and pay the $20. If you automatically offer $rate - 20%, then you are
cheap.

And I don't mean cheap as in "getting a good deal", but cheap as in
"screwing somebody and taking a selfish stance that ultimately lowers
the quality of living on a gradual decline for all of us, even
yourself".

And I am not big money either - I spend more than 50% of my time
working on open source projects (writing code, running servers,
evangelizing etc). So I am not one who has unlimited funds when I need
something done.

But when I do need something done, I look for someone with the right
skills and expertise, and pay them a good price, absolutely fair
market rate.

Any other approach just perpetuates the misconception that internet
developers are cheap and disposable, and that hurts all of us. This
attitude is why we get those dork posts in nyphp-jobs where they want
someone with 8 years programming experience, 5 years project
management experience, 7 years database experience, and oh by the way
we can only afford $20/hr. Fuhgeddaboudit!

$cheaper != $better, and I openly detest the short-minded, selfish
people that pollute the world with lousy food, garbage products, and
refuse to pay for the value that they want.

Don't be a consumer, be a producer! :-)

I think we differ in an assumption here.  To me, the "going rate" is
whatever I can negotiate.  To use the example of one of my clients, if I
offer to install SpamAssassin for $300 and the other person accepts,
that is the "going rate", at least for that client.  If I then farm out
the job to a vendor (say a college kid) willing to take $20/hour, then
that is the "going rate" for that vendor.  

If, at the end of the deal the client is happy and the vendor is happy,
that's the best of all possible worlds. If one or the other is not
happy, well, it's my job to make sure they are happy (assuming I ever
want to see either of them again ;-).

> And I don't mean cheap as in "getting a good deal", but cheap as in

But if every leaves happy, no one gets screwed. I don't see where it's
my responsibility to make sure that someone else (the vendor) handles
her finances properly.

I pay them what they ask for.  My accountant and plumber charge
above-average market prices (especially in this area!).  I gladly pay
them what they ask because it's worth it to me (the value).  Could I get
a cheaper accountant/plumber?  Sure and in the past I have.  That's why
I now pay above-average rates.

I agree with you.  *I* won't take those jobs either but if someone else
will do it for that price, more power to them.

They *are* paying for the value they want.  It's just not the same value
you want.

Which is exactly why I work for myself. :-)

Agreed.  So are you saying I make a page with a bunch of keywords and meta

Depends.  I can be, and would mostly be morning.  I usually work my day

jobs could change....

I make it a point not to judge people, but this tactic and my own 
personal values clash violently. I think the reason is made clear by 
your defense - you can get away with it.

There are companies that get away with some pretty awful employment 
practices (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatshop) - have they done 
nothing wrong?

What you can get away with isn't a good measure of what is right.

This ethical stance also has a flipside, and here is a real-life example:

I was approached with a project opportunity, and I knew that if we
asked ~$30,000 we could have landed the gig.

We base all our deliverables on Mambo (well we should, we're core
developers LOL), and I knew we could get to market with 80-90% of what
the client needed with off-the-shelf stuff from MamboForge.net and so
on, and the whole shebang would take less than a month.

I wager the others bidding on the project were planning on writing a
bunch of code on their own, and as such needed more time and money.

So we ended up bidding $10,000, even when I was confident we could
have asked for three times that amount. And what we deliver will be
equal (or most likely superior) to what the others could have offered
when all is said and done.

Why?

Because that is what the work was worth. Just because you can get more
doesn't mean it is justified, nor ethical. And the client will be even
more enthusiastic to recommend us to his peers; and the other people
we are working with on that project are equally enthusiastic to have
us working with them as they want to have us handy for future
projects.

It all perpetuates itself - if you give, you receive. There's really
nothing else to it.

Mitch could I ask you a few questions related to Mambo?
CCing the lits since I think it may be of interest..

Recently I bumped into Mambo and I think it would be a great time saver 
because of what you listed above (lots of components already built, 
communal work, etc...).

The questions..
* Non MySQL support.
Based on what I see on the forums and an email I sent asking it seems 
Mambo will support other databases in the not too distant future.

Do you have any guestimates when this may be?

* How big a learning curve do you see learning Mambo? We talking days or 
weeks.. for an experience PHP developer.

Don't have MySQL so have not tried Mambo.. but looking to try it once it 
supports other DBs.

* For what type of applications do you think it's best suited and least 
suited?

I have seem some of the mambo sites users have done and it seemed a pretty 
wide spectrum.

I think this thought works both ways. If I'm a start-up struggling for survival and I need something done right and someone gives me a good job at a cut-rate I'll darn sure go back to that person first when there's another job. And I won't base my offer purely on "hey, you did it for $x.95 last time".  More like "Hey, you took a hit last time, let me pay you well on this one."

Personality seems to be a big factor, too. I think a lot of my decisions have been and will continue to be biased by interactions here. If I want to find someone to do something, I'll look here. A few weeks ago a potential client's need suggested a security code review. I knew who to ask--it's just that simple. 

ciao!

I can answer some of this. First, I was able to do stuff with Mambo and I'm not a good programmer. There are lots of add-ons you can get for Mambo, Mitch just mentioned Mambo-PHPshop. A skilled PHP'r would have a lot of fun setting things up and tweaking them.

My view of Mambo is that it's best for an informational site where the non-tech user updates things. You can add/edit pages on-line and publish them at will. Pretty neat sutff. On the other hand, I'm paranoid enough to want lots of backups and editing on-line gives me the willies.

Note that my opinion is based on some exposure, but not a lot. I wouldn't choose Mambo for a minimal e-commerce site because much of it wouldn't be used. But I have a place or two I wish I would have know about Mambo before they got set up...

Jump in--you'll love it!

ciao!

Committing a heinous crime and cross-posting to the NYPHP Mambo list.

*gasp!*

The upcoming 4.5.3 release utilizes ADOdb for database abstraction,
and we support any database that ADOdb supports. We've made a lot of
changes and fixes along the way, hoping to make ADOdb better as well.

You can check it out of cvs from the mambo project site at MamboForge,
the module is 4.5.x. Right now it runs on whatever database you want,
I am finishing up the installer to work the same way.

> * How big a learning curve do you see learning Mambo? We talking days or
> weeks.. for an experience PHP developer.

Last week a fellow walked up to me at TGIFridays and asked a couple
questions. Come to find out he doesn't program at all, he basically
takes mambo and installs a bunch of goodies and he is done. So if a
non-programmer can use Mambo, a geek should be able to get productive
too ;-)

http://help.mamboserver.com/ has a couple component and module
tutorials as well as the API. That in itself should get you going, but
I am a learner by doing and suggest you jump in and start breaking
things to learn the fastest.

> * For what type of applications do you think it's best suited and least

Great for corporate sites, business sites, commerce sites, and online
publications. It is not especially suited for community sites at the
moment, but that weakness is being taken care of rapidly.

Right now Mambo is not really suited for blogging, but we are about to
release a GPL blogging component that is really crazy. After that
point, then there is really very little that Mambo cannot do, and do
well.

> I have seem some of the mambo sites users have done and it seemed a pretty

>From Mitsubishi to Michael Jackson, Mambo is in use everywhere. I've
seen sites with the stock template barely modified, and others (like
Porsche) where the whole HTML front end has been ripped out and
replaced with flash.

Like my story above, if someone pays you $x to deliver a site, you can
start at 0% done, or 80-90% done. Choose wisely! ;-)

We got 6 projects approved for Google's Summer of Code, and 3 others have 
volunteered to do the work anyway (without the pay). One of those projects 
is version control, which directly addresses this issue. The others are 
equally fascinating, and we have a really great group of students to work 
with this summer.

We are setting up a wiki for the projects and will announce when everyone is 
ready.

Also, note that as soon as 4.5.3 ships we can start ripping out the ACL for 
4.6, where you will have full users/groups options for fine grained access 
control.

Okay, I'll keep you in mind then.

However, you had better charge me what everyone in here thinks is a
reasonable rate otherwise they'll accuse me of running a sweatshop. ;-)

Look, I'm not forcing them to do it.  If they don't like what I have to
offer, guess what, they CAN go elsewhere.  If I can't find anyone to do
it at the price I'm offering, I have to raise my offer.  That how Adam's

Oh, please!  Why don't you just call me a Nazi and get it over with.

I'm not ripping anybody off.  I am not forcing anyone to do anything
they don't want.  I am not the only game in town. I don't have that kind
of influence over another person.

A young fella recently contacted me and said he charges $25/hour and did
I have any work for him.  You're telling me that I am at fault if I take
him up on that?   

And for your information, I've never paid a subcontractor less than
$65/hour (does that rate meet your approval?) and I've told the young
fellow mentioned above that he's underpricing himself.

I bid on a project one time, it was an RFP one with multiple groups 
submitting. I bid a fair amount, everyone else did much, much higher. I 
didn't get it and they actually told me, through someone else, that they 
didn't think it was possible that I could do it for that amount when 
everyone else wanted so much more.

I'm not advocating ripping anyone off, but you should consider charging 
people for the value of the product you're delivering, even if 80-90% of 
it is free and already done. Many people will expect it, and will gladly 
pay knowing that 80-90% of it surely works, as it's being used by others.

I'll keep that in mind if you ever call us for a project (rimshot)

On a serious note, one fascinating trend I see is that clients actually want 
their custom code released as open source, so they have a chance that the 
community picks up development and keeps the codebase alive. Very cool.

Old school economics.  Business for your own good and your own good 
only.  Seize every advantage, exploit all available resources.

Part of me thinks you are just playing devil's advocate.  If not, well, 
I'm sorry.  It's too bad if you don't see the direct or indirect 
consequences of your actions.

I'd rather see us talk about coding.   It's rare that the list embarks 
on a path of this sort.

Before I go off and try to write an AMP report generation tool (eg. via PHP,

anyone had already beaten me to it?  What I'd like to do is allow the user
to layout reports from data stored in MySQL tables and then print them out
in PDF.

Any thoughts?

Hi Daniel

 

Thanks for the reply. Apologies for not replying sooner.

 

I'm afraid I'm still stumped by converting a multi-row result into
something that XML_RPC can handle.

 

Lets say I get a result  as such from

"select * from emp" 

 

EMP_ID            EMP_NAME      EMP_SAL

123                   Fred                  1000

345                   Joe                   2000

678                   Tom                  5000

 

I convert the result into an array using oci_fetch

 

What happens next is where I get confused :

 

Do I loop through the rows and create an XML_RPC_Value of each row or is
it just for the overall result that I package it ?

Should I be using "array" or "struct" types ?

 

Thanks

 

Mike

Thanks to everyone who made this meeting possible.

A big thanks to IBM, David Boloker, Dan Gisolfi and Stewart Nickolas for
hosting and presenting this meeting.  We had one of the fullest meetings
ever, and I'm sure many would agree that it was enlightening to see the
IBM/PHP relationship, and the bright future ahead.

For those not in the area, or those who couldn't attend in person, the
audio/presentation/pictures will be a great asset.  Thanks to Dan Krook,

Message-ID: <f6b3106e050706183318a9c0d3@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone worked with the Roadsend Compiler (www.roadsend.com) or any
other PHP compiler capable of creating standalone executables from PHP
code?

I'm working on a primarily PHP project that requires a small,
standalone app to be installed on a number of web servers, that may
not have PHP installed. I could whip up something in Perl/Python/Ruby
or even C but why bother if I can get what I want done in PHP and
compile on each platform that I'll be deploying on?

Comments, ideas, suggestions?

>From my investigation it seems that your php script is "exiting" before it
can output something back to server and then to browser. Your webserver is
working since request goes to proper place (as I can see icon logo in
address bar).

Further investigation tells that you have used <Directory> directive to host
....swiss-supp... website and your Document Root for ....swiss-supp...
website is SOME_WEBROOT/ FitAndFun2/ and here is problem. So please check
that necessary pages exist there. I need to check "index.php" or similar
file that loads first when this ....swiss-supp.... website is called.

Then I called url like http://www.swiss-supplements.ch/list.php directly
(list.php I just tried to check whether php support is there or not) and it
output like " No input file specified. " that means PHP support is there. So
now I am sure that your script "index.php" (or any other files that is being
included in this script) has problem somewhere.

Sometimes it happens that when you upgrade your original software by adding
third party code, and you don't take care about necessary values &
parameters like Host name, Db name, Password etc. then called script (that
is part of third party) tends to Exit without further execution. For example
in each php script we include "config.inc" to provide necessary variables
about Db, Server, Userid Password etc. and there are most probably some kind
of validation mechanism/functionality to check whether all critical values
are available for each script or not, and once that mechanism/functionality
fails there, it terminates whole script and output "some/no messages" about
relevant error. So please check whether you have configured all parameters
and values that are required to run your script successfully.

I have tried using Roadsend Compiler for creating standalone PHP-GTK 
applications but their GTK support is not quite ready. Have you looked 
at bComipler? (http://pecl.php.net/package/bcompiler) It is a PECL 
package that is designed to create standalone apps.

Message-ID: <1120742166.25340.237949156@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi Eric,

I tried an earlier version of the Roadsend Compiler. While it is a good
product, and while its authors have clearly put a ton of work in it, I
identified several deal-breaker shortcomings for me. For one, it is a
re-implementation of the entire Zend Engine interpreter / compiler, so
many built-in PHP functions, constructs and conventions are not
supported. It has support for some PHP extensions bundled, but not for
all. For example, when you use a mysql_ or mysqli_ function in PHP, you
are really using the MySQL client libraries through a PHP function. In
other words, the real strength of PHP lies in how it builds a framework
of functionality using existing third-party open source C libraries. PHP
may have 3000+ "built-in" functions, but a lot of them rely on
third-party extensions. The Roadsend Compiler is a fine product, and
fills a certain niche, but I found it too limited in its current form
for my needs.

For creating desktop applications with PHP, I would recommend checking
out the following:
WinBinder (only for Windows): 
http://www.hypervisual.com/winbinder/index.php

PHP-GTK (cross-platform): http://gtk.php.net/
A vastly improved version 2 of PHP-GTK should be released in the coming
months.

Hope that helps.

- Jay

PHP-GTK still requires PHP to be installed unless you use some sort of 
PHP "compiler". While I whole-heartedly recommend taking a look at it, 
it won't solve Eric's problem.

	but elsewhere?
Message-ID: <1120744210.28588.237952318@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello all,

I found the following documentation for the new PEAR_ErrorStack library:
http://pear.activeventure.com/core/core.pear.pear-errorstack.intro.html

The source for the library itself is here:
http://cvs.php.net/co.php/pear-core/PEAR/ErrorStack.php?r=1.19

I don't think the library has been released yet, so I was wondering how
this third-party site got its hands on such good documentation. Is it
using the CVS version of PEAR's documentation? I checked on the main
PEAR site for documentation on this library, but I could not find it.

Any ideas?

Best regards,

- Jay

WinBinder looks really interesting, as i dont know GTK i havent ventured 
down that road, also i dont like the visual feel of GTK 1, i have been 
waiting for the new release of PHP-GTK to use GTK 2 before i ventured off 
that way, looks like i may checkout WinBinder.

I've played with it a little bit, but not in production.  Looks like a
promising product with some potential.

I think you could give Roadsend a try.  They are Long Island based, and in
fact some of their team I believe is on this list.

I'm looking for an rpm package for my RedHat 7.3 box -- hopefully the

4.1.2)

Could anyone point me to a source you trust for unofficial php rpms?

Start by using google to find out exactly what rpm you
need.  I usually use a search string like ?what-I-need
rpm download?.  My experience finding missing rpm?s
this way has been very good. A couple of years ago
when I first upgraded from RH 7 to RH 9 there was some
dependency failures and as the result I could not use
PHP with MySQL.  It took a while for me to find the
patch and the rpm download for it but it was a good
experience and I learned a lot.   

Last week I finally upgraded from Redhat 9 to Fedora
Core 4, because I wanted to use PHP 5.  Now, with
Fedora upgrade, I no longer have to look for packages
everywhere.  Fedora comes with a utility (yum) that
links to specific repositories of upgrade rpm?s and
installs from those directly.  Life is getting easier
and better every day.

Interesting -- I'm a fellow former RH9 user, now using Fedora 3 at work
(Ubuntu at home), and I use rpms and yum and apt-get for nearly everything
I can ~except~ Apache/MySQL/PHP, prefering instead to compile from source
(or install the MySQL binaries from one of their tasty tarballs). That's
because -- this is my ignorance speaking here -- I don't know how to find
out what extensions are supported in e.g. the PHP binary that comes in the
rpm, and where the rpm plans to put things, until after it's done. How's
the Fedora 4 php rpm in this regard?

I also like having the option of doing an upgrade NOW, when a new version
comes out, instead of having to wait a couple days for an rpm to follow.

Wow that is interesting,

Because I stick with rpm exactly for the reason you
don?t do rpm.  I find the standard option and
extension are perfectly sufficient for me. As for
upgrades, I never found immediate, and to some extent
continual upgrades, to my liking.  For example I had
PHP 4.1.xx with my RH9.  I waited until Fedora Core 5
to upgrade everything and with it move to PHP 5.

To answer your question, PHP5 upgrade was part of
Fedora Core 4 upgrade and the installation went
flawless.  The only things I had to install after the
upgrade were non-PHP related.  I had to install yum
and a couple python services that were needed for yum
rpm.  These weren?t part of the standard upgrade I
guess because I jumped directly to FC 4 and these were
part of the earlier versions of Fedora.  Then I had to
also install MySQL server.

Hi Antonio,

# Your problem has been resolved. You programmers had overwritten file

../FitAndFun2/includes/boxes/currencies.php

=>

../FitAndFun2/includes/classes/currencies.php

That is why output of server was not printed. At this moment I have just
placed proper file in proper directory by downaloding it's appropriate
version.

# I have made 1 more change in file ".../FitAndFun2/includes/configure.php"
at line no 41 to change password of DB server that you had changed but
didn't change in this file.

# That's all for now, take care while using third party softwares.
Understand well before taking into use.

# And yes change necessary password/s now for security reasons.

Thanks

Mark,

Thanks for the recommendation.  I had heard positive things about that book
elsewhere, so that is probably the logical choice.

Hey everyone,

 

As it?s probably no surprise, I?m a fan of compiling from source.  The
exception, however, is MySQL, which I will use either the RPM or tarball.

 

Especially for production systems, I?ve found much better stability and
reliability (from a maintenance and system administration perspective) when
compiling from source.  Combine that with a high load environment, and
trimming the fat of unneeded extensions, etc. and source is generally the
way to go.  I will say, however, that for development ? especially on
Windows ? I?ll use some type of package management or pre-built packages,
like XAMPP (http://www.apachefriends.org <http://www.apachefriends.org/> )
which I use all the time on Windows.

Hi Leila,

Yep, I've found several sites for rpm downloads (though not yet php 4.3.11
for RH7.3), but I just wonder, how far can you trust an rpm that you find
that way?  I'm still a little green, but I think trust and integrity is the
reason I check md5sums on official php rpms from Zend; so if I'm concerned
about trust and integrity, shouldn't I be concerned about where those
unofficial rpms come from and what other people say about them?  So, I'm
just wondering if anyone's got a trusted source that they like for such
things.

Still, I admit, it seems like most people prefer building from source, right
gang?  And I'll probably end up going that way after all.

Thanks,
Allen

Start by using google to find out exactly what rpm you
need.  I usually use a search string like ?what-I-need
rpm download?.  My experience finding missing rpm?s
this way has been very good. A couple of years ago
when I first upgraded from RH 7 to RH 9 there was some
dependency failures and as the result I could not use
PHP with MySQL.  It took a while for me to find the
patch and the rpm download for it but it was a good
experience and I learned a lot.   
 
Last week I finally upgraded from Redhat 9 to Fedora
Core 4, because I wanted to use PHP 5.  Now, with
Fedora upgrade, I no longer have to look for packages
everywhere.  Fedora comes with a utility (yum) that
links to specific repositories of upgrade rpm?s and
installs from those directly.  Life is getting easier
and better every day.

Hi Allen,

I am afraid I always had to take my chances with the
rpm's I downloaded. I wish I could be of more help in
that regard.  That's one good reason to upgrade to
Fedora since it comes yum which allows users upgrade
using approved rpm's from specific sites.

Anyone here have much experience with this software? A client of mine wants 
to have a survey form where there is a checkbox to join the list, also will 
have an unsubscribe form. I have looked at the HTML form Lyris uses to allow 
an email to be added and it's posted to script, however is there a way i can 
make my script somehow add the email to lyris if the user has choosen so. I 
am not sure how i would re-POST data automatically to another script from 
within mine. I understand if Lyris accepted GET i could just pass it as 
parameters in the query string.

I detest it, as it negates the whole purpose of using a distribution
that has a package manager in the first place.

However, every time I try to build from SRPM (or try to make my own)
everything works just fine, until I do it with PHP.

Then I get slammed with a dependency for
libgilflapsnatwabble-0.1-alpha or some such nonsense, and I end up
turning a nice clean system into a frankenstein alpha bleeding edge
mystery machine just to build PHP as an RPM.

Ditto for debian, running source of PHP 5.0.4 on ubuntu because
working with the debs available was a complete disaster for me.

But no, I'm not bitter! ;-)

With packages, the dependencies for PHP force you to sit way behind
the current versions available, and from a security standpoint I
cannot do that on production machines. So I am forced to compile PHP
for each box.

-- Mitch, thinking about Gentoo (again!) LOL

I have to stand up for Debian, because I'm a fan.  Debian stable, and
even testing, are perfect server environments.  Ubuntu was designed
strictly for the user's desktop.  You have to be careful which .deb
files you use in Ubuntu, because mixing and matching Debian .debs and
Ubuntu .debs can lead to nightmares.

I've been running PHP, MySQL, and Apache, all from .debs, on a Debian
stable system, for about 3.5 years now, with no complaints.  This
summer, I'm switching to testing, because it's that stable.  Ubuntu is
a pretty desktop toy (which I'm using right now as I type this e-mail
on my laptop), but I would never use it on a server.

I to am a build from source person for the Apache/PHP/MySQL set. My
argument in support of this decision (even on an RPM based distro) has
a couple facets:
1. I've got my machine set up to automatically update RPMs when they
become available, I don't want to do this for these three. If there's
going to be a problem I want it to happen while I'm watching.
2. My configure command for PHP is kind of... long. I'm not even sure
if I would get all this with the RPM:
'./configure' '--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql'
'--with-apxs=/etc/httpd/bin/apxs' '--with-gd' '--with-png'
'--with-zlib-dir=/usr/local/zlib-1.2.2' '--enable-gd-native-ttf'
'--with-ttf' '--with-jpeg-dir=/usr/local/lib/jpeg-6b/'
'--with-freetype-dir=/usr/local/lib/freetype-2.1.9/'
'--with-xpm-dir=/usr/X11R6/' '--with-tidy' '--with-curl'
'--with-openssl=/usr/local/' '--enable-dba=shared' '--with-db4'
3. When I looked, I seem to recall having problems matching PHP
5.0.newest with Apache 1.3.newest.
4. Long configure commands aside, If I don't need it, I don't want it.
It's only one more thing to worry about.

I'm happy to let up2date manage the other stuff kicking around on the
machine, but for the trio that make my webserver work, I'm going to
stick with source.

Hey folks,

It's so interesting how we all have similar reasons, yet different 
conclusions.  My situation is a little different, so I thought I would 
share.

I'm an RPM person, all the way.  I believe in maintaining a large number 
of machines, you need to trust the distro.  That doesn't mean you 
shouldn't run a test server and review the packages, however.  Now for 
the difference in my situation:

I work on an embedded product, which uses an old distro, so I NEED to 
build everything (well, alot of things) myself, and then package it 
myself as an RPM, as this software needs to go to many servers 
remotely.  But frankly, I'd rather use the RPMs provided by the distro, 
as it scales much better, in terms of machines, and in terms of people 
(just give it to the system admin to install, no compiling necessary).

Regarding the list below, here are my thoughts/experiences (I know you 
didn't ask!)
1. Agreed, run a test server, and install RPMs manually
2. many RPMs uses the "enable-all-modules" (I forget the flag), so you 
get all (if not all, alot) modules
3. I haven't heard this, but am using PHP 5.0.4 (actually just build 
5.1beta yesterday) Apache 1.3.33 and the newest mod_ssl and it works 
fine so far.
4. Good point.  I do this at the package level, however (don't install 
software you don't need, which may cause dependency issues, I know!)

Just my two cents.

For what it's worth I did decide to go ahead with the source install...

But I (doh!) didn't uninstall the existing rpms first.  Oops.  Most 
everything works fine still.  Except pear. Except select calls through 
phpMyAdmin.  But everything else... so far...

Looks like I have something do keep me busy for another Saturday afternoon.

Thanks for the input folks.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] php install: "can't find mysql headers"
Message-ID: <42D04BF0.6040404@iifwp.org>

Okay, I decided to go with a source install, and now I'm just confused.  
As I mentioned earlier I installed php 4.3.11 from source this morning 
without removing the existing php rpms, and I noticed that some things 
weren't working.  So I went back and removed those rpms and tried to 
rebuild again, but the problems don't go away.

The real problem I'm trying to solve is that apache (1.3) is 
consistently segfaulting on a few apparently randomly chosen calls.  
That is, I have a few links on my site that are garuanteed to cause a 
segmentation fault in apache, but it's seems oddly random why those 
links are broken and not any other.  So I thought, maybe it's an arcane 
php bug; upgrade to latest and then submit a bug-report if necessary.  
Even stranger, now that I've upgraded, I get the *same* behavior, but on 
*different* links (including any select operations with phpMyAdmin, but 
not update, insert, etc., and not selects in other php scripts...)

But my hope has been that, maybe, just maybe, there IS a bug in php's 
mysql support somewhere, and if I were to compile 
--with-mysql=/path/to/mysql-headers I might just be okay.  But that 
seems a no-go, too.

Using '--with-mysql=/usr/include/mysql' gets me the error 'Cannot find 
MySQL header files under /usr/include/mysql'; same for 
'--with-mysql=/usr/lib/mysql'.  Those are the only two directories that 
rpm says contain files from the MySQL-devel package.  And 
/usr/include/mysql does contain mysql.h .

There are numerous discussions of this error message on the Web, but all 
the one's I've found seem to be either dead ends or just as 
trial-and-error as I am.

So, banging my head again, I ask the group: what the heck am I doing 
wrong? (Even the most obscure hint would be appreciated...)

Thanks,
Allen

Hi Allen,

Ok, here's an obscure suggestion:

I'm not sure what the problem is, but you may want to take a look at the 
spec files for some PHP/MySQL RPMs, and see if that gives you any clues.

Good Luck!

Hi,

Segfaul error (or segmentation fault) occurs when a
bogus address is being referenced. More specific to
your case when apache is looking for something at an
address that is no longer holding that information.  

This error will also occur if two binaries being
linked together are compiled with two different
versions of the compiler.  All and all I think this
error could be the result of you old version of PHP
prevents the newer version from being identified. I am
assuming that?s what you mean by ?without removing
existing php rpms?. 

The fix may be tricky, I would first try to uninstall
the old version of the PHP (rpm commands and options)
and then try to re-install the new version of PHP from
source.

Did you install the "Libraries and header files" RPM 
(MySQL-devel-4.1.12-1.i386.rpm)?  How about the "Client programs"
(MySQL-client-4.1.12-1.i386.rpm) and "Server" 
(MySQL-server-4.1.12-1.i386.rpm)?

Allen,

I?m not sure if this will help you or not, but it
seems to me that the problems you have listed are two
different ones.  The one with apache occurs at link
time.  Apache is looking for something at an address
that's illegal; doesn't exist or doesn't have the
correct size.  

The header not found problem is happening at compile
time.   It seems that the makefile is not finding the
headers where it expects them to be.

Both could be as the result of mismatched versions;
one version is looking for something in a directory
that is not provided by the other version.

Hmm, unlikely - at least for something this simple.  It's probably a cross
compile/RPM issue/version mismatch.

So you have the RPMs of MySQL installed?  And you've also installed the
libs/headers/shared libs/ RPMs from mysql.com, right?  Just to be overly
certain, you also have all the same version number and playform, right?

Before installing them, remove all MySQL or PHP RPMs.

rpm -qa | grep -i mysql
rpm -qa | grep -i php

Then of course rpm -e each one.

Once you seem to have things settled on that end, install the MySQL rpms.
And probably wouldn't hurt to run ldconfig and check ldconfig -p to make
sure the libs are installed and ready to be found (ie, they are listed).

Now you can compile PHP, specifying the base path of the MySQL install,:

--with-mysql=/usr

Give that a try and see if it helps.

Oh, boy, what a bunch of quality advice. Hans (and a couple of others I
guess) hit it on the head:

I had mismatching versions of the mysql rpms -- something like devel-4.0.25,
server-4.0.22, client-4.0.22.  Like Hans suggested, I wiped 'em all out,
installed new packages (all 4.0.25) from MySQL AB, and recompiled PHP.
Configure ('--with-mysql=/usr') ran without a hitch, as did the rest of the
install.  Ace the installation problem.  Restart apache, and the segfaults
go away, too, at least all the ones I've noticed so far.  Ace the segfault
problem.

This is great to know.  From what I saw on the web, these problems
(apparently random segfaults from php/mysql; and "cannot find headers" in
php compile) have hit a number of people, and none of them were lucky enough
to find solutions this quickly; nobody suggested this cause to them, at
least not in the online discussions.  Hopefully the next guy will either
google up this list archive or have the good fortune of knowing a few folks
who know their stuff.

Thanks much,
Allen

Hi Albertos,

 

I haven?t played with the software, but we did have them come in and give a
presentation:

 

http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/

 

All the stuff is online there (given on Jan).

 

They have a number of technologies, but at that time I believe their primary
platform was Python.  Perhaps they?ve added PHP by now ? I?d be interested
to hear if others have played with it too.

Happy it worked out.  Version mismatch problems are an often cause for
segfaults.  If you have any notes/articles written up, we can get them
online at nyphp.org too.

Yes, it's a great idea. I will try to transcribe a few notes and get them to
you -- hopefully we can make it less of a mystery for future readers.

Hi,

I came to the recent meeting at IBM on Madison Ave and decided to sign up for
the PHP talk list.  I run an e-commerce website at www.fun-electronics.com and
I need to set up an affiliate program.  We want to give 5% commission to people
who send customers who buy from our site.  It seems like it would be much better
to take a script that someone else has written instead of trying to write my
own.  Does anyone have any recommendation of open source scripts or even
commercial programs they would recommend?  We're running PHP 4.3.11 and MySQL
4.1.7 on FreeBSD 5.3.

I wrote my own shopping cart, so it seems like it would be easy to customize it
to work with an affiliate script.

Thank you,
Chuck Smith

I'm sure you could do this with an app, but the process of cutting  
checks each month wouldn't interest me.  My clients who've setup  
affiliate programs use one of the major commercial networks.  I can't  
recommend any one in particular as I don't operate sites, just  
implement.  I've implemented commercial solutions for a number of  
clients.  Here are some of those my clients have chosen:
     http://www.cj.com/
     http://www.myaffiliateprogram.com/
     http://www.directtrack.com/
     http://www.linkshare.com/

They're usually very easy to implement, with or without a custom cart.

As an active affiliate, I can say that choosing a network as middleman means you will miss many 'super affiliates'. I will rarely work with CJ or LS, although Shareasale has some attraction. Definitely self-managed is most attractive to those affiliates seriously into the game, if not the only option.

The closer the marketer can get to the business decision maker, the better the bait for supers.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Sssllloooowww Query
Message-ID: <6.1.0.6.2.20050712101400.030dbcc8@pop.earthlink.net>

Hi NYPHP,

I've got some code that works, but it's pretty slllooooww...

There are about 4,000 bands in the overall list, and we're displaying them 
all, so I'm sure that's part of it.

But I have a feeling the major slowdown is the loop in the middle that 
checks to see if the band is performing in the selected concert.

Are there any obvious modifications to the code that would speed it up a bit?

I tried a foreach loop on $row_showbands instead of the do-while on 
$showbands, but couldn't quite get it to work properly. I think the reset 
was not working?

Thanks in advance...

Harvey


This query gets the full list of band names to display alphabetically.

<?php mysql_select_db($database_cititour, $cititour);
$query_allbands = "SELECT subcat_id, subcat_name FROM music_subcats ORDER 
BY subcat_name ASC";
$allbands = mysql_query($query_allbands, $cititour) or die(mysql_error());
$row_allbands = mysql_fetch_assoc($allbands);
$totalRows_allbands = mysql_num_rows($allbands); ?>

This query gets the id's of the particular bands in the selected concert.

<?php mysql_select_db($database_cititour, $cititour);
$query_showbands = "SELECT band_fid FROM music_showsandbands WHERE show_fid 
= $id";
$showbands = mysql_query($query_showbands, $cititour) or die(mysql_error());
$row_showbands = mysql_fetch_assoc($showbands);
$totalRows_showbands = mysql_num_rows($showbands); ?>

This query shows the full list of bands in a list box, with the specific 
concert bands highlighted.

<select name="band_fid[]" size="20" multiple id="band_fid[]">
	<option value="0">------</option>
	<?php do { ?>
		<option value="<?php echo $row_allbands['subcat_id']?>"
		<?php do {
			if ($row_allbands['subcat_id'] == $row_showbands['band_fid']) { echo " 
selected"; }
		 } while ($row_showbands = mysql_fetch_assoc($showbands)); ?>>
		<?php mysql_data_seek($showbands, 0) ?>
		<?php echo $row_allbands['subcat_name']; ?>
		</option>
	<?php } while ($row_allbands = mysql_fetch_assoc($allbands)); ?>
</select>

4000 bands in a drop down box, are you crazy?

i would make the user choose a state or city then only show the relevant 
ones to make your query faster.

Unless I am missing something here, cant you just simplify it with a
LEFT JOIN and use only 1 result set?

-- untested --

SELECT ms.subcat_id, ms.subcat_name, msab.show_fid
FROM music_subcats AS ms
LEFT JOIN music_showsandbands as msab
  ON (ms.subcat_id = msab.band_fid AND msab.show_fid = $id)
ORDER BY ms.subcat_name ASC

Then something like:
while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($allbands))
{
  $format = '<option value="%s"%s>%s</option>';
  $selected = $row['show_fid'] > 0 ? ' selected' : '';
  printf($format, $row['subcat_id'], $selected, $row['subcat_name'] );
}

-- untested --

Forgive me if I totally missed the boat on this one ;)

It's not for the user, it's for the admin to select bands when he is 
entering a new show.

Believe it or not, they're all bands that have performed in NYC over the 
past few months.

And even the slow query only takes about 6 seconds to load.

But, yes, I am crazy.

Maybe print the results in sets in an iframe. Just have the admin enter 
a list of id's in the form.

Still - break it up alphabetically or something.

Actually, this is a perfect opportunity for you to try out that
XmlHttpRequest object you've been dying to use.

A few other suggestions:

1) Yes, use an outer join as previously suggested.

2) Make sure you check your indexes.

3) Is the query taking a long time, or is the page taking a long time
   to build/load? That's important to know.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] different sites, one database
Message-ID: <200507131215.18205.henry@beewh.com>

Hello all:

I've been trying to solve this on my own with no luck. I can't seem to find 
the answer on google. I get different problems/solutions but not the answer 
to what I want to do. Maybe someone here can help me or point me in the right 
direction.

Here's what I need to do... 

I have a dedicated server with different sites hosted, each with their own 
mysql database which I connect to perfectly in my php scripts, using 
"localhost" as the server in the mysql_connect() function.

The sites are for example...site1.com, site2.com, site3.com.

Well, now I need to connect to a mysql database on site1.com that holds 
information that is usefull and needed for most sites. I need to do this on 
scripts that run on site2.com and site3.com.

How can I connect to the mysql database on site1.com, when I am running a 
script on site2.com or site3.com?

I can't use "localhost" as the server in the mysql_connect() function in the 
scripts on site2.com or site3.com, because I would be connecting to the mysql 
database, on each site, which I understand. 

Help!!

Thank you in advance and I hope my explanation was clear.

Henry

That depends. Are these actually the same database with different
logins? That's probably the case, in which case you >can< use
localhost, and just change the login info.

If they're different databases, you should be able to substitute
"site1.com" or "site2.com" or whatever for "localhost", assuming the
db is set up to listen on ips other than 127.0.0.1 (which it probably
shouldn't be, but probably is).

Do site1.com, site2.com, etc... all resolve to the same IP address?

Easy.
First, I assume you have configured MySQL to allow different users to
each database, right?
If not so, please do, either by using a graphical tool like phpMyAdmin,
or by hand, see the MySQL Manual.
Second, maybe first, nevermind that, you have ONE machine with all the
sites inside, right?

Having checked this, you WILL connect to server "localhost" because it
is the only server you have, no matter how many databases it serves.

Now, on your scripts, if you do not use a DBAL (database abstraction
layer) in which case you should consider either using an existing one,
or writting one (as I do), you  only have to invoque the database with
mysql_connect:

mysql_connect("localhost",USER,PASSWORD); // USER and PASSWORD MUST be
the ones allowed to access the database you want.
mysql_select_db(DATABASE);

And Query it...

With this you should be on your way.

They do. They all resolve the same IP address.

And they are different databases. I tried substituting "localhost" for 
"site1.com" and got an error:

Warning: mysql_connect(): Access denied for user: 'henry at site1.com' (Using 
password: YES) in /home/httpd/vhosts/site2.com/httpdocs/mysql_test.php on 
line 22

Thanx...

Sure:

the script to test is running in:
	http://www.chess.ac/mysql_test.php
You can see the errors i get there.

from www.chess.ac, I want to connect to a database in www.calchess.org. Both 
these sites are on the same server (same IP).

And here is the mysql_test.php code (I hope it is not too much, if it is, 
sorry....)

<?	
	/* connect to chess.ac database */
	$CFG_SERVER = "localhost";		
	$CFG_USER = "chess_ac";
	$CFG_PASSWORD = "";
	$CFG_DATABASE = "chess_ac";	
	$dbh = mysql_connect($CFG_SERVER, $CFG_USER, $CFG_PASSWORD);

	mysql_select_db($CFG_DATABASE);
	$q = 'select * from chess_bio_invited';
	$res = mysql_query($q);
	while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($res)){
		echo $row["user_id"];
		echo '<br>';
	}

	mysql_close($dbh);
	
	// connect to calchess.org database
       $host = "calchess.org";       
       $user = "chesshustler";
       $pass = "";
       $link = mysql_connect($host, $user, $pass);
       $db = "chessdb";
       mysql_select_db($db);
	$q = 'select * from chess_bio_invited';	
	$res = mysql_query($q);
	echo 'CALCHESS DATA';
	echo '<br>';
	while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($res)){
		echo $row["user_id"];
		echo '<br>';
	}
	mysql_close($link);	
?>

Thank you all for your help.

I'm thinking this has something to do with the hosts, or the actual 
usernames.

What about a:

use mysql;
select * from user;

you dont ha\ve to actually paste that, but look in there and see if you 
notice what the source's are setup as.

sounds like a mysql permissions problem, try this:

use mysql;
grant all privileges on <DB_NAME>.* to <DB_USER>@'%' identified by
'password';

if you're using PHP4:
set password for <DB_USER>@'%'=OLD_PASSWORD('password');

obviously set DB_NAME,DB_USER and password to your values;

p.s. you should also set a test for a successful connection before
trying to select, query, etc.:

$conn = mysql_connect(....);
if (!conn) die "Could not connect to database $db_name
REASON:".mysql_error();

Ok worked the other way around. i can connect from chess.ac to any other site 
in database just with "localhost".

look: www.chess.ac/mysql_test.php

This connects to www.calchess.org database correctly from chess.ac script.

But I can't connect from any other site to chess.ac. I checked user table in 
mysql database and there is a row that has:

Host: 127.0.0.1
User: chess_ac

This will not let me connect to chess.ac from another site right? no other 
sites have this. Can i delete that row, without affecting database access?

There is another row:
Host: localhost
User: chess_ac

I should leave only that?

Thank you all for your help.
Henry

Actually I will be joining Henry in waiting with bated breathe for the
answer to a question similar to this one. I have gotten what I thought was
screwy behavior when there were rows in mysql.user that had the same value
for user but different values for host. Connection from one host would
work but not the other, as thought the first matching row mysql encounters
were overshadowing the second.

Can you or can you not have two users 'foo', one of which has host 'host1'
and the other of which has 'host2' and have both be able to connect from
their respective hosts? (And I am talking about doing this through GRANT
statements rather than updating the user table directly).

Check out http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/access-denied.html.  There's a
bullet point mid-way down and a user comment that could be helpful.

Henry, can you post the error you're getting again and all the user name /
host combinations from the user table?

For future reference, it's often times better to send a private email

Yes.

(see 5.6.5. Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification in
the manual)

" It is a common misconception to think that, for a given username, all 
entries that explicitly name that user are used first when the server 
attempts to find a match for the connection."

"f you are able to connect to the server, but your privileges are not 
what you expect, you probably are being authenticated as some other 
account. "

Basically MySQL orders the host user combination from the most
specific (restrictive) to the most general (like entries with
  wildcard characters)

It uses the first combination which would allow a connection.

This can cause uexpected results if you login successfully
under a different authentication record than you were
meaning to.

The manual suggests using 'CURRENT_USER()' to help explain
what's happening.

The SSL connection for the URL below doesn't work on a MAC with IE (ver.
5.0) (works well with Safari, though). Any clues as to why this might be the
issue? Of course...it works on a PC with either IE or Firefox.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Optimal Object, property,
	variable passing strategy between classes
Message-ID: <002401c5888e$3b13e3e0$11a8a8c0@cliff>

This may be a newbie question, but I am confused regarding the most
optimal way to pass information between classes, especially if I want
access to a variable, say for example a product name to be used in an
email alert, but don't need to modify it. I come across this situation
frequently when one class becomes bloated and I decide to split it off
into several more logically partitioned classes.
 
If I use arguments in functions, I believe the values are copied, which
would seem to be slow. As one function calls another function and so on,
it seems like needless copies of a variable are made. If I use &
reference, there's no copy, but now the variable is "exposed" to change.
If I pass an object by reference, there's no copy, but once again, the
properties are "exposed" and I still have the copy propagation problem
with multiple nested function calls. Would the best way be to pass an
object in the argument of the constructor to capture values for all
function within the new class?
 
Thanks in advance.

The points that you are making are valid, but the
alternative to passing information as parameters is to
use global variables.  Using global variables negates
one of the major advantages of OO programming, that is
encapsulation.  In C++ we used be able to declare a
parameter as constant and prevent it from being
modified.  I&#8217;m not sure if
&#8216;const&#8217;ness is possible in PHP.

Oh yeah, check out define().

Sounds like passing arguments is the best way, or if speed is really a
concern, passing by reference while being really careful.

here is my $.02

Of course everything really depends on each individual scenario, but
here goes:

Variables:  If you have many that you are passing, I would encapsulate
them in an object otherwise I would copy if I was concerned about
tampering and reference if variable data is large.

If you have accessors methods, you _should_ be able to protect against
un-authorized changes, no?

I find passing an object in the constructor works well, especially for
substituting the _passed_ object with a mock object in order to test.

You could also utilize the Singleton Design pattern.

YMMV

We didn't ask him if he was in PHP 4 or 5.

In any case, doesn't PHP's copy-on-write behavior at least mitigate the
overhead problem? IOW you don't have to worry about pass-by-copy eating
too much memory unless the data is changed on the receiving end.

... which is a piece of cake in PHP 5.

Thanks David:

I am using PHP 5 and should have read this chapter more completely!

PHP 5 Object, Patterns, and Practice: Page 141, "The Singleton Pattern,
The global variable is one of the great bugbears of OOP..." More bedtime
reading...

Plus for ready only, copy-on-write behavior would eliminate the overhead
problem.

Since we have that licked, another question. I have not been able to
find canned functions for turning a MySQL DB linked list (id,
description, parent id) into an array tree. Managing categories seems
like such a popular task, that I'm surprised that I have not found
standard functions for the front-end, back-end admin. Etc. Has anyone
tried PEAR HTML_TreeMenu or Tree (which at 0.2.4 (beta) released on
2003-03-17 does not seem very active) to do this?

Hi,

I meant declaring parameters as constants like this,

void foo( const string & var) { 
     // do something with var
}

And that would be (in C++)
const std::string WEB_ROOT("/var/ww/html");
(or something along those lines, I cannot remember)

Cliff Hirsch asked for PHP equivalent of following C++ code

void f(const type& param)
{
	/* do something with param, compiler generates an error
	   if param is modified in any way */
}

AFAIK, this isn't possible in PHP. I think that PHP implements 
copy-on-write for (at least) strings so if you don't pass complex 
objects, pass by value seems like a reasonable way (safe and fast).

I use objects as parameters for some methods and I do pass by 
reference because otherwise I'll end up with a copy (in PHP4). I 
also pass by reference if I have to pass an array.

So, I'd write above C++ code in PHP like this

function f(&$param)
{
	// try not to mess with $param ;-/
}

If I'm returning complex stuff like arrays or objects, I'll use

function &f(&$param)
{
	...
	return $a_complex_thing;
}

Again, there're cases where this can crash the PHP environment. (I 
think such a crash is always a bug. There have been some progress in 
PHP 4.4.0 on this area, if I've understood correctly.)

And no, you cannot emulate const'ness with a global variable. 
Passing a reference provides exactly the same safety and the same 
(almost?) performance.

Exactly.  PHP uses copy-on-write, so even if the ampersand is not used when
passing variables, the variable's data isn't copied unless it's changed in
the local scope.

Message-ID: <20050716162427.15632.qmail@web30803.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Is there a relation between mambo modules and
components?  I haven?t been able to find any
information to make this clear to me.  The
documentation I?ve found so far all focus on how to
create them but nothing else.  I?ve also been looking
through mambo?s data model design and, as far as I can
see, there is a relation between mambo modules and
menus but nothing between modules and components. This
is important for me to understand because I am
thinking of re-implementing my website,
www.tutorialwizard.net, to work within a mambo
framework, if possible.  Any ideas and advice from
mambo experts in this regard would be very much
appreciated.

I like mambo, I think it has great potential to create
sophisticated websites with minimal effort.

"West ", but that won't watch "West." or "West," or similar
matches. You need to really think about what you're trying to hit.

Hi Leila,

Consider modules as blocks of logic that are secondary to the page
content, and components as logic that *IS* the actual content.

So with a base mambo install, you can see that the litle blocks are
modules, but when you click on Contact Us you will see in the main
content area the component itself (com_contact).

Modules are strictly for the front end; whereas components can be on
the front end as well as the back end (again, see contacts for an
example).

Further complicating things is that you can use a component on the
back end to maintain a front end module (polls, for example).

I don't remember when this all started making sense to me, but I do
remember that it was really just an adjustment of terminology - which
is a challenge no matter what CMS you choose.

I used to really like Analog (http://www.analog.cx), but I haven't been 
in charge of web stats for a while. It was nerdy and fairly manual, but 
pretty capable. It's still maintained and updated, and has both free and 
commercial support options.

Lately I use webalizer but only because the Fedora package is easy to 
install. I don't really know a lot about it.

This seems to work:

Take a look at the component tutorial. That should provide a decent
example to get you started.  Also, you can grab Mambo Designer from
mambodev.com or jamboworks.com (not launched yet). This will create a
base template, module or component that you can then work from. Yes it
is beta, but is quite usable :-)

I have access to Webalizer, Analog and AWStats but I find AWStats to
be the most thorough and my clients really like the granularity of the
reports (breakdown by day, time of day, month, hits, visits, bytes
transfered, referring sites, search engines & keywords  etc etc)

Take a look here:
http://awstats.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/awstats.pl

I've had to patch it a couple of times due to security issues but
otherwise it's been great, I'd definitely recommend it.

"West ", but that won't match "West." or "West," or similar matches. You
need to really think about what you're trying to hit.

-adam

Using the additional above input from Adam, here is more refinements to the
criteria.

[ Cannot be any alphanum character. Could be no space. Could be a space.
Could be any punctuation, except not a dash (-). ]
SEARCH TERM 
[Cannot be any alphanum character. Could be no space. Could be a space.
Could be any punctuation, except not a dash (-). ]

I believe this is the criteria the reg exp needs to meet.

Can you refer me to PHP5 project(s) or module(s) using PHP5 OOP that
impressed you and can be freely studied as a reference to see some basic
quality real world OOP in use.

It would be great if the project(s) were smaller in scope and featured one
or two instances of class inheritance,  __construct and __destruct,  and get
and set accessor methods on properties.

Does not need to be backwards compatible to PHP4.

Is there documentation about this somewhere? I'm wondering how this 
works...

Given following code:

function f($a)
{
	$a[2] = "z";
}

$a = array("x","y","z");
f($a);

Will the PHP make a copy of value "z", the whole array $a, or does 
it notice that $a[2] already has the value "z". Or will it create a 
new array $a inside function f() and just uses copy-on-write to the 
values?

I'm pretty sure that PHP doesn't notice that $a[2] isn't used 
anywhere in f() so setting it could be skipped.

Or put a password on it. 

It's a nice gesture to have publicly available stats, but it also
invites trouble from people who want to monkey with referrer strings
and the like.

Thanks again for your advice,

The tutorial you?ve mentioned is a good one.  I
actually started going through it half way once but
got stuck on something.  I?ll give it a try again. 
And what makes this even more challenging is that I
want to create a website, using mambo framework, that
looks like the website I have now.  I think this would
require creating a new template as well as two new
components.

That's a good question about the documentation.  There was some, but I'm honestly not sure how current it is, given PHP 5.

http://www.bozemanlug.org/talks/phppresentation.html

And that's not really what I was looking for, but google couldn't come up with the older document when given "andi php references"

But this is new:

My understanding is that the entire array will be copied, thus locally scopped, into the function.  When the function returns, the array is removed.  If a "reference" was used, by indicating so with an ampersand, then the original array, outside of the function's scope, would be modified.

The best thing is to test it - make an array with 10mb of junk, then pass it in while watching the size of the PHP process.  If it more than doubles, then it's been copied :)

Message-ID: <6.1.2.0.2.20050720101055.0210c040@mail.optonline.net>

I have run into an odd (odd to me, at least) problem where 
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] doesn't seem to be working.

The code is this:
===========
   // required entries missing
   if ( $reqEntries < 6 ) {
     header( 
"Location:$_SERVER[PHP_SELF]?action=internet&reqflag=1&join=$joinFlag");

// debug
exit( "reqentries is $reqEntries so exiting" );

   }
===========
This is working perfectly on my localhost, PHP 4.3.9, Apache 1.3.24.  It is 
not working on my test site,
PHP 4.3.11, Apache 1.3.33.  The debug exit shows that the if clause is 
true, and it's the header that's not
working.  phpinfo seems to show nothing weird or unexpected about the value 
of _SERVER['PHP_SELF']
on the test site.

Anybody have any ideas about what might be going on here?  Thanks in advance.

I'm not sure, but I can think of 2 things that might be the cause:

1. No space between Location: and the URL
2. Non-absolute URL

You could try:

header('Location: http://'. $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] 
.'?action=internet&reqflag=1&join='. $joinFlag);

Also, you could try echoing the location string directly to see what is 
being sent.

I would suggest starting here:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/regexp.html

It is a good introduction to Regular expressions in MySQL and should 
give you all the information you need to craft the right regexp for your 
situation.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Cannot unset $_POST during logout
Message-ID: <20050720160732.GA25969@neuropunks.org>

Hello,
cant figure this out, Im trying to make it so once a user logs out, they cannot hit back and be logged back in - which im sure is trivial, but for some reason does not work with my code.
here is the code snippet from the beginning of index.php (which handles $_POST $_GET and does authentication/signup/proper page display):

<?
session_start();
require_once ("../conf/app.conf");

$page = new Page();

if ($_GET) {
        $get = input_process($_GET);
        if ($get[a] == "signup") {
                $page->body .= build_signup();
                $page->body .= build_survey();
                $page->htmlBuild("index");
                exit;
        }

        if ($get[a] == "logout") {
                unset($_POST);
                unset($_GET);
                unset($_SESSION);
                session_unset();
                session_destroy();
                $page->body = "You were successfully logged out";
                $page->htmlBuild("index");
                exit;
        }

}


?>

The code goes on for much more after that, but i would think these are the relevant parts.
I also tried inserting various header() cache control things, but that didnt work either. If I print_r($_POST) after I call unset()'s and session_destroy() its empty, so somehow the browser caches the $_POST and does not honor

header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");

which I used to have at the beginning of this page (after session_start() and before require_once())
I also tried replacing unset() with $_SESSION = array() and same for $_POST and $_GET but it still caches.
There are checks in the code for varous $_SESSION vars to be set to gain access to certain data, so you would think unset($_SESSION) would prevent access, but it doesnt.
Here is one of the checks:

if (count($_SESSION[user]) > 1) {
	echo "<br>This is protected content, only for authenticated users.";
} else {
	echo "<br>This is general content for everyone.";
}

That is in the html that gets called by $page->htmlBuild function, and it still gets bypassed due to caching (of $_POST i would assume)
So I am a little confused now, I looked at some other code and it looks like checking for certain $_SESSION vars being set is an acceptable authentication verification method, but it fails for me.

Thanks for any input!

How do you access the table from each new thread? Can a thread access
other session data or do you store the table in a database?

well, storing session data in the db was an attractive idea, but I decided not to do it because the $_SESSION array is too tiny for this app, and the app wont grow in the $_SESSION[user] sense. There are other things in the app tied to $_SESSION[user][uid] and when I need to access those things, i do a db lookup using the uid.
I would also like to avoid recoding some of this to make everything get stored in the db.
Also, wouldnt this introduce at least slightly more overhead? I would assume you would have to query db on pretty much every page that user goes through to make sure they have enough access to access this page, as well as check their session id, etc.
Ive seen alot of discussion advocating db backend for session storage, but I am still not convinced its a good idea.
But you do have a point, I would be able to track vars pretty well. I use print_r and echo and those type things now to see values for $_POST and $_SESSION, and they come up empty once i call print_r after processing $_GET logout request.
This really looks like a browser caching issue, but I do have those no-cache header statements, and the code makes that check and it still sucks : /

There are a couple of different issues here.

Number, is to destroy the session, which you're doing.  The basic procedure at:

http://us2.php.net/session_destroy 

should suffice.

Now regardless of whether the user hits the back button or not, his session will be dead.  Keep in mind that sessions are stored on the server, and once you destroy it, and properly handle any cookies if they exist, you've effectively logged them out.

$_POST and $_GET will be set in PHP regardless of a session.  They are created automatically if there's such a request from the browser, and shouldn't be depended on for a session.  Instead, the state of the session, using the functions in the above URL, should be used to qualify whether a session is active, and thus if they have the correct credentials.  Then, $_GET and $_POST can be acted upon accordingly.

Hope that helps a little,

Putting aside the issues other people mentioned, not quoting key names is 
damn ugly and causes notices.  You can do any of the following.

 "Location: {$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']}?action..."
 "Location: ${_SERVER['PHP_SELF']}?action...<br>"
 'Location: ' . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . '?action...'

More importantly, PHP_SELF can be tainted by users.  Don't assume it's 
safe.

As someone else suggested, a good first debugging step is to use echo 
instead of header(), so you see exactly what header you're sending.

In this case, there are several problems worth eliminating, most of 
which Dan pointed out:

1. No space after the colon
2. No absolute URL
3. Improper syntax for an array

When you reference an array as $_SERVER[PHP_SELF], you're telling PHP 
that the index of the element you want is the constant PHP_SELF. Once 
PHP discovers that no such constant exists, it will try to treat 
PHP_SELF as a string, in case that's what you really meant.

In a brief test, none of these mistakes made it fail to redirect, so 
there must be something else (or your browser is pickier). Perhaps 
$joinFlag is not set, and your error_reporting is set to E_ALL?

What's the behavior you're observing?

To answer a question with a question, everything you receive from the 
user is tainted, so should you not use any of it? :-)

Dan is just pointing out the fact that you should filter it first. With 
the way Michael is using it, an attacker could potentially send a string 
with a \r\n in it to send additional HTTP headers of the attacker's 
choosing.

By appending parameters to the uri you're requesting, i.e. requesting

http://example.com/?$BAD_STUFF_HERE

Not in PHP 5.0.4 -- PHP_SELF is only the relative filename of the
script called by the webserver, no query information is attached.

This would eliminate the security hole, but does mean that we would have
to reconstruct the get query to figure out how to get back to where we
started from. A bit of a pain if we are trying to bounce back to a page
that, for example, requested user login.

My example was flawed, but the same case still works.  Apache allows  
the use of '/' as an IFS, so you can do

http://www.example.com/index.php/$BAD_STUFF_HERE and it will appear  
in full form in PHP_SELF.

As far as I am aware, $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] does not contain any query 
string information, from the manual:

> 'PHP_SELF'
> The filename of the currently executing script, relative to the document root. For instance, $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] in a script at the address http://example.com/test.php/foo.bar would be /test.php/foo.bar. The __FILE__ constant contains the full path and filename of the current (i.e. included) file. 
> 
> If PHP is running as a command-line processor this variable contains the script name since PHP 4.3.0. Previously it was not available.

Testing on my local machine running 4.4.0 shows this behaviour:

> $_SERVER["QUERY_STRING"]   hello=tiger
> $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]    /info.php?hello=tiger
> $_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]    /info.php
> $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]       /info.php

So, it seems $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] should be relatively safe to use this 
way.

You are absolutely correct, I hadn't thought of that case either.

Would it make more sense to use the $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] variable?

And PHP_SELF depends on the configuration of Apache, too, as it will change depending on certain directives.  I'm a fan of SCRIPT_NAME...

Ah, now we're getting somewhere. So the BAD_STUFF would include %0D%0A
(\r\n) followed by some other HTTP headers.

http://www.example.com/index.php/foo%0D%0ALocation%3A%20http...

Sounds like $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] is definitely the way to go here,
or at least strip any newlines out of PHP_SELF.

This also means that if you use $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] as the url for a
<form> action, you'd better make sure you filter it using
htmlentities(). One urlencoded doublequote would open you up to a
cross-site scripting attack.

You really did open a can of worms, Michael!

Input Field Separator.  In this case the token that separates the  
path which maps to a file on disk and the query string parameters.   
'Normally' you do

http://example.com/index.php?foo=bar

Apache allows the following as an equivalent expression:

http://example.com/index.php/foo=bar

__FILE__ is the safest, most reliable (cross-sapi) way to get this kind of 
info.  basename() and dirname() functions on that value can be very 
helpful.

Of course, ou mean <form method="post" action"...">.  Anyway, using 
PHP_SELF for the action is supurfluous, since all it does is name itself 
the default action of a form is submitting to itself in the first place.

I see, thanks.  So the jist of it is that in PHP 5 the user can still 
pass bad stuff to PHP_SELF through the query string if they use the / 
token.

I'm interested in learning more about security stuff and 
filtering/cleansing user data.  Checking out Tim's link...

In PHP4 too.  They behave the same, my original comment was a typo/

Except that if you call the script with a URI that includes embedded
quotes, you can break the form and add abritrary HTML to the page.

<form action="<?=$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']?>" method="post"> when called
with a url like:

index.php/%22%3E%3C%2Fform%3EMy%20HTML%20Here

Becomes:

<form action=""></form>My HTML Here" method="post">

His point was that using PHP_SELF as the form action was not only  
insecure but pointless as well, since best-case it restates the  
default behavior.

Yep, and this is discussed here:

As Dan pointed out, the default action is the current URL anyway.

It looks as though "action" is a required attribute of the FORM element
according to the HTML 4.01 spec. I wonder if empty string is a valid
value... guess I should test it against a validator.

Correct. "action" is a required attribute of FORM, and according to
validator.w3.org,  action="" is fine.

I'm freaking out now ...

Like I had before....

<form method="post" action="<?PHP echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>">

appears in a LOT of my code.

is it now crucial to switch this to:

<form method="post" action="<?PHP echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); 
?>">

Is there any circumstance which could keep me from having to switch all 
this code?

You could put:

$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'];

into one of your common include files.

I was getting all ready to say that Safari doesn't like these empty
action attributes, but I just tested it and it's fine. I swear I've
seen brokenness on this, but maybe it was just a bug that got patched.

Which sucks, because I used to use empty actions. Well, back to it I guess.

This whole discussion turned out pretty funny for me, as I never have

Maybe I'm dense but I lost you there, and I'm curious -- what sucks, and
why?

No, for two reasons:

1) basename() doesn't buy you any security from HTML injection.
2) PHP_SELF is pointless, since the form will act the same way if you just 
   leave the action blank.

So, just do this:

  <form method="post" action="">

I had a problem with empty action strings (action="") when visitors were
using some old version of AOL with who-knows-what browser embedded in it.

I was getting all ready to say that Safari doesn't like these empty
action attributes, but I just tested it and it's fine. I swear I've
seen brokenness on this, but maybe it was just a bug that got patched.

Which sucks, because I used to use empty actions. Well, back to it I guess.

I generally put the script name in the action="" manually.  But for those 
here who are enthralled with lazy-assed magic, you could do something 
like this, which I alluded to before:

<form method="post" action="<?php echo basename(__FILE__) ?>">

Some browsers interpret an empty action as the web root. I think this 
happens on IE for the pc, at least some versions. Can't check at the 
moment. It's definitely caused problems for me.

At work, we're using Webalizer 2.01 and I ran across the following statistics in
a site we just launched about a week ago (perfumesandpampering.com).  I saw the
following statistics under Hits by Response Code:

Code 200 - OK 	4564
Code 206 - Partial Content 	2
Code 301 - Moved Permanently 	1
Code 302 - Found 	155
Code 304 - Not Modified 	2836
Code 400 - Bad Request 	7
Code 403 - Forbidden 	116
Code 404 - Not Found 	165

Is there any site that explains what these codes mean without the highly
technical jargon that one finds at
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html?

Should I be concerned about any of these numbers or are they fairly normal?  Is
there anything I should check to make sure our site is working properly?

Thank you,

Message-ID: <8d9a4280050722061246dfc585@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

Once again i have a question for you guys. I have a list of perspective 
clients in an mysql database. I would like to send them letters to try to 
gain them as a client. I know i can use a template engine such as smarty to 
create the HTML template. Here's the question. Is there a way i could run a 
script and have it automatically loop each record, send it off to my 
printer? I know i could do this with javascript to auto print the page i am 
looking at. Also i know that PHP is serverside and if installed on my remote 
server there is no way to send it to my local printer, so i was thinking of 
making a script here on my dev machine that would access the remote db, 
maybe then there is a way to have PHP or JS send each record to my printer 
in a batch job.

Any suggestions will be appreciated

Don't know what platform you are on, but you could do the following with 
IE (you might be able to do the same with FF, I'm not sure).

Generate each record as a page (could be dynamic or static)
Create a "table of contents", which is one page with all pages linked.
In IE, you can say "print all linked documents"

Hope that helps!

I've known people to use BASH or Applescript to generate either html, 
pdf, or postscript files, then batch those out to the printer. Linux has 
plenty of command line printing options. I imagine windoze can do it 
too, if you ask nicely.

I guess a lot of the question depends.

1. what platform are you on?
2. how much formatting/images is in the pages? (I mean are they text 
files, LaTex, PDF, etc)
3. Is this a one shot app you have to finish in 3 hours, or something 
you plan to re-use and port

For PDF I've used ezPDF, free and native php from a guy in NZ.
I've seen some one use IE and JS to do batch jobs, but there were 500 
pages, and it was really slow and would time out.

While PHP is wonderful and very versatile, I don't think PHP is the 
right tool for the job here. There are tools designed specifically to do 
what you want. Use MS Word's Mail Merge feature to create and print the 
letters. You will be done in 1/10th the time it will take you to put 
together a PHP/Smarty/Javascript solution.

Message-ID: <000001c58ece$8b96f320$11a8a8c0@cliff>

I just received an email from evite with a link that looked something
like this:
  
<http://www.evite.com/pages/invite/viewInvite.jsp?inviteId= very long
string &li=iq&src=email

This is a common approach for user login validation, etc. It doesn't
require a login. It doesn't check to see if it came from the email
address that it was sent to.

What prevents a hacker from randomly entering a "very long string" to
gain access to confidential information? It seems to me that the usual
approach is to just go with the very low probability formula. Is this
more secure than I think? Am I missing something here? To me a more
secure approach would be to require the email, or some other tidbit sent
in the email, to be entered. That would correlate the "very long string"
with the email that it was sent to, which a hacker would not know.

Agreed on that.  I regularly do the word mail merge thing for stuff 
like that.  Link an Access db to the mysql db and then merge with word.

I think I've answered my own question. The very low probability approach
just may work.
20 letters = 26^20, if my high school math is correct, which is
2,600,000,000,000,000,000,000

I just received an email from evite with a link that looked something
like this:
  
<http://www.evite.com/pages/invite/viewInvite.jsp?inviteId= very long
string &li=iq&src=email

This is a common approach for user login validation, etc. It doesn't
require a login. It doesn't check to see if it came from the email
address that it was sent to.

What prevents a hacker from randomly entering a "very long string" to
gain access to confidential information? It seems to me that the usual
approach is to just go with the very low probability formula. Is this
more secure than I think? Am I missing something here? To me a more
secure approach would be to require the email, or some other tidbit sent
in the email, to be entered. That would correlate the "very long string"
with the email that it was sent to, which a hacker would not know.

Yes.  I'm afraid I don't understand this entire thread.  Apparently 
because of the numerous PHP developer articles recommending it, and 
because of the php.net page which for whatever reason lists it first on 
the list of predefined variables, people are using PHP_SELF when they 
really want SCRIPT_NAME.  SCRIPT_NAME solves all the problems mentioned 
in this thread - it's just the script name, without any extra garbage 
that might be tacked on by the user.  PHP_SELF explicitly includes that 
extra garbage, so solutions in this thread that involve stripping the 
garbage off of PHP_SELF to make it safe are really, really missing the 
point - just use SCRIPT_NAME instead.  Please don't use FORM ACTION=""; 
according to the spec, what the browser does with that is undefined, so 
even if it works in current browsers, it might not work in future ones.

People can be forgiven for making this mistake -- I'm here holding my 
copy of _Learning PHP 5_, and it recommends on page 8 and again on page 
86 the use of PHP_SELF for self-referencing forms, ahem -- but it's time 
to put it to bed: PHP_SELF is unsafe for any usage where it is echoed 
back to the page.

Sorry for going so far off topic.  Zing!

If Haiku (a concise, compact, simplified poetry) can be written in Perl, 
then is Ginsberg (a often verbose, complicated, free flowing style) to 
be written in PHP?  That's the typical view of _other_ languages' coders 
of PHP coders, isn't it? I mean if Perl can claim so easily capable of 
Haiku, can't PHP enjoy a little messiness? Could Python or Ruby be used 
to write Beat Poetry as sufficiently as PHP? Free Speech Man!
Ok, now I sound nutz. Here's a background story :

When I was learning to code, some one (rightly) accused my code of being 
messy and they said good code should be like poetry. So I said, "Then 
just think of me as Ginsberg!"

When you factor in uppercase and numerals, the number of possibilities
is even larger. But consider that the code might be a base64-encoded
binary string, which means 256 choices for each byte.

PHP session IDs work the same way. We trust them because they are
large, hard-to-guess random values.

This is a bit long.
 
I?ve just started messing around with PHP; so I stuff several different
thingies..
I?ve run into a problem with IE MAC 5.2.
On all my other browsers this page works but on IE MAC though the source
code looks identical to the other browsers the link showing what page you
are reading is not turning red.
 
I don?t understand.
Does IE MAC have problems with:
 
#index #nav p  #index-link, #test3 #nav p #test3-link, #assie2 #nav p
#assie2-link, #assie_discuss #nav p  #assie_discuss-link{
      color: red !important;
}
 
Thanks.
 
 
The relevant CSS:
 
#nav p {
      font-family: Georgia, Times, serif;
      font-size: 100%;
      line-height: 2px;
      padding-left: 2em;
      color: #024;
}
 
#index #nav p  #index-link, #test3 #nav p #test3-link, #assie2 #nav p
#assie2-link, #assie_discuss #nav p  #assie_discuss-link{
      color: red !important;
}
 
#nav p a:link {
      text-decoration: none;
      display: inline;
      color: #024;
}
 
The page [test3.php] doing the calls:
 
<?php
$browser= $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
 
$version= "5\.23";
$sys= "MAC";
$app= "MSIE";

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Web Traffic Analytics
Message-ID: <3253-41807@sneakemail.com>

This is another case of convenience and perhaps customer ignorance trumping security. These are log-file analysis programs, which operate after-the-fact on server files which contain proprietary company data. Do they really need to be "live" on a public web server?

We could go on for months about how users of analytics don't actually understand them, or use them properly, vs. how customers demand access to and over-value the reports, how we have to please the customer as a business model, etc. but the truth includes:

- users of log-based analytics don't need "real time" access (if they need "real time" knowledge, they should be using a diferent tool). 
- every web coder should have technology for providing secure file access for customers, and web analytics (trade secret information) should be accessed that way - not via open http on a pubic web server.

Yes we need to satisfy the customer, but I also think that the PHP-talk list is the place to recognize this poor industry practice. Perhaps (gulp) duscussion could lead to some practice improvements. At the very least it needs to be acknowledged (?)

It might be commercially helpful if PHP-talk members provided expert advise to their customers on the issue, even as they provided the web-based solutions requested. Perhaps instead of meeting the competitive challenge by lowering price and offering the same stuff, one could diferentiate by doing so along with advice and caution on the poor practice?

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] Web Traffic Analytics

I see attemts to hit awstats as the number one suspicious activity in
my error logs for the last six months. I really like the program, but
please make sure to patch it and read all the information about
securiing it. Also, rename it and stick it in an odd-named directory
just to add that extra layer of obscurity.

Yes. It works as advertised.

Configuration is a nightmare... well, maybe just a bad dream, but
anyway there are six or seven different files with a bunch of default
values that all reference each other, and nothing works until they are
all in place.

If someone were to redo Nagios in a professional,
easy-to-install-and-configure way (using zero-config networking!),
sysadmins would beat a path to their door.

Or even if Cacti (http://www.cacti.net/) would just add an alert
system... but the developers have said they aren't interested.

You don?t even need to link to Access, just export a comma separated list to
a text file. Mail Merge will grab that no problem.

I modified Cacti for a client years ago to give clients password 
protected access to just their info, show 95% info, and it told the 
hosting company when the MySQL database was getting so large they needed 
to back it up and move it off-line. It's all pretty hackable.

If people want that so much, perhaps I should play around with it again!

Message-ID: <29da5d15050725114125ffe04d@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to create a function that displays the first 250 words of a text, 
and then puts " ... [ full text ] " (as a link). I did my research and I 
found the functions that I thought would work, however when I try to findt 
he 250th space (to determine where the 250th word would be) it doesn't seem 
to work, and the function only displays 250 characters.

Here is the function, maybe I am misunderstanding something:

function createTextPreview($text, $words = 250)
{
if(str_word_count($text) < $words) {
return $text;
} else {
return substr($text, 0, strpos($text, ' ', $words)) . ' ... [ <a 
href="link">full text</a> ]' . str_word_count($text);
} 
}

Thanks in advance.

Same result, and I also tried replacing $words altogether with 250 just to 
test that, and still the same result. 

As a side note, the . str_word_count($text) is there for debugging purposes 
and I didn't get around to taking it out.

I played around with those functions, and I think I can get them to work

However, I'm equally as interested in figuring out why this doesn't work as 
I am in getting a working function for what I need.

Thanks for those functions btw.

Note that str_word_count($foo) returns the number of words found, with 
no indication of anything else (such as where the 250th word might be).  
Your strpos() function counts characters, not words.

What you want:

http://php.net/str_word_count

is str_word_count($foo,2), which according to the docs returns an array 
with the words and their position in the string.  So if you looked at 
the key for the 251st element of that array, and subtracted one, that 
would be the place to break the string between the 250th and 251st 
words.  Then you can just use substr($foo, 0, ($keyvalue-1)) to dump 
the first part of the text string...  Since I'm guessing that 
str_word_count() is slow, to avoid running it twice you could use 
array_count_values() to count the elements of the returned array.  If 
it's more than 250, then do the above.  If the returned array has less 
than 250 elements, you can output the entire string since it's less 
than 250 words.

All of this implies that you're happy with what str_word_count defines 
as a "word".  If you need to be more picky, the function Hans Zaunere

Food for thought: what does your application do if it receives a 10,000 
character sequence of A's in a row without spaces?  Might it be that 
you want to break at 250 words OR a maximum number of characters?

I am confused by the

"strpos($text, ' ', $words)"
because in this case $words represents 250 charactor offset for the 
function strpos.
So instead of 250 words, wouldn't you get the first 250 charactors?

You want to find the position of the 250th word? I would use the index 
250 of the array returned from str_word_count:

http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.str-word-count.php
"2 - returns an associative array, where the key is the numeric position 
of the word inside the string and the value is the actual w"

Note that str_word_count($foo) returns the number of words found, with 
no indication of anything else (such as where the 250th word might be).  
Your strpos() function counts characters, not words.

What you want:

http://php.net/str_word_count

is str_word_count($foo,2), which according to the docs returns an array 
with the words and their position in the string.  So if you looked at 
the key for the 251st element of that array, and subtracted one, that 
would be the place to break the string between the 250th and 251st 
words.  Then you can just use substr($foo, 0, ($keyvalue-1)) to dump 
the first part of the text string...  Since I'm guessing that 
str_word_count() is slow, to avoid running it twice you could use 
array_count_values() to count the elements of the returned array.  If 
it's more than 250, then do the above.  If the returned array has less 
than 250 elements, you can output the entire string since it's less 
than 250 words.

All of this implies that you're happy with what str_word_count defines 
as a "word".  If you need to be more picky, the function Hans Zaunere 
linked to would let you choose exactly what constitutes a word 
boundary.

Food for thought: what does your application do if it receives a 10,000 
character sequence of A's in a row without spaces?  Might it be that 
you want to break at 250 words OR a maximum number of characters?

The 250 offsets the 250th occurance of ' ', which therefore should be right 
after the 250th word (assuming there aren't some random occurances of it).

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php - note the last example, 
where it returns 7 and not 1 (with the offset).

This function is only being used where administrators of the site would be 
inputting data, so that right now isn't a concern for me. However, once I 
get the site launched and start fine tuning my scripts, I may also put a 
character limit on it with a certain ratio of words to characters.

The offset doesn't work for me either the way it is documented here -- 
IF -- using spaces - but other characters work.
It doesn't say you can't use spaces, but I'd guess it only uses standard 
charactors as needles. I haven't tested \n's for example.

|// We can search for the character, ignoring anything before the offset
$newstring = 'abcdef abcdef';
$pos = strpos($newstring, 'a', 1); // $pos = 7, not 0

|Is this a php version issue? I am using php 4.3.11.

First of all, thanks for all your help on the server stats question.

Since we have moved into production, I am now trying to turn off displaying
errors and deciding to log errors instead.  No matter what I do, I can't seem
to find where our FreeBSD 5.3 server is putting our PHP error log.  Do I need
to specify a file in error_log or does stderr send errors to some log on my
server.  How can I find out where that log would be?  I have copied the current
contents of our error handling of our php.ini file to the end of this email.  I
commented out the error_log statement.  I've tried putting a filename in there
before and it still did not work (I also made sure the write permissions were
correct).  Any ideas what I might be doing wrong and how I can fix it?  I'm
relatively new to Unix, so I'm probably overlooking something really minor.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Thanks for the function.

I'm still curious though, how come the space doesn't work with the function, 
is it bugged or was it intentional?

Here?s another, a modification off of en example on the PHP WWW page:

$temp= "The Word of the Famous TurkeyFace. The Word of the very Famous
TurkeyFace with the blue nose and green toes.";

$temp2= strtok($temp, " ");
while (($temp2 !==false) && ($countB < 6)) {
echo "$temp2 ";
$temp2= strtok(" ");
$countB++;
}


I deleted your original email so I was trying to find what function didn?t
see the space.
I haven?t found it yet; though now I at least know what strtok does.

In fact, I just realized that I was forgetting that I had to restart Apache to
let it recognize the new php.ini settings.  Then, I had to set the file owner
to apache, so that it had permission to log the php errors.  I'm mostly writing
this in case others might have the same problem to say how I solved it.  Thanks
for the help!

I thought that by setting up the PHP error log, it would also send MySQL errors
there.  However, MySQL errors still appear on the screen.  Is there any way to
set this up?  I've looked at various websites and tutorials and none of them
seem to be of help.

I'm programming the IPN (Instant Payment Notification) for Paypal, so Paypal is
calling our php page directly and so I cannot see what errors are happening
there.  I see documentation on the MySQL error log, but it seems to only give
information about when the server crashes.  It says that this error file should
be at 'hostname'.err, but when I search for it, nothing appears.  Any idea what
could be wrong or how I could set up MySQL error logging?  Is there a file
similar to php.ini for MySQL?

Thanks,
Chuck

I recently needed a similar conversion, and found a tool called
"a2ping".  I forget where I found it, and I'm currently at a public
library w/o my bookmarks, but it's out there.  I don't remember seeing
a Windows version, but then again, I wasn't looking for one.  But this
tool will convert from nearly anything to nearly anything, and fixes a
lot of flaws in the files while it converts.  Great tool.  Someday in
my Copious Free Time, I'm going to try (with the author's permission)
to make a .deb of it.

You can probably use your own function to capture those errors. for
example if you use "or die(mysql_error())" to halt your script,
replace die() with your function which logs the error and then exits.

Or may be a more elegant solution,

I checked out the oLabs PHP Filters.. it seems a little too paranoid for me. 
Sometimes we need things like hyphens.. OWASP is a great resource, but I 
think the filters are lacking a bit.

Any other ideas?

(or of course I could just shut up and write my own)

Plus -- just to make sure Chuck understands -- something like a SQL syntax
error, or a query that fails for some other reason, will not make it into
the mysql error log. As I understand it, the error log is for mysqld's
internal stuff:  when it starts and stops, and critical errors
(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/error-log.html). A failed query is more
like an event in the course of a conversation between the server and a
particular client.

I'll leave it to the big boys to correct me if I'm wrong, or re-state this
in more technically precise terms.

Dear friends
I have some problem in getting query from mysql,
I have table named news in following fornat
ID Int, sid Int, Title Varchar , .... data DateTime
I have a query like this
SELECT count(*) from news where sid in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ,6, ...) order
by id LIMIT 0, 10;
I want to force mysql to use id as index (not sid) (because of bug
size of my table) but I was unsuccessfull in that, and always mysql
use filesort to sort the results.
Something wonderfull is when I changed the query to
SELECT count(*) from news where (id< 1000 or id> 100000) order by id
LIMIT 0, 10;
mysql didn't use id as index.

Thanks in advanced

I was gonna say, when you say input filtering, I take it you mean both
validation and filtering. To my mind, the former is like, "does $email
look like a syntactically valid email address?" while the latter is like,
"strip all the non-digits out of $phone_number"  or "escape all the html
entities in $string." In any case, HTML_QuickForm is something you might
want to look at if you haven't already. It is concerned with form
generation and not just input validation -- you have to instantiate an
HTML_Quickform and add elements to it before you can add validation rules
-- but still you might find it interesting.

Fellow PHP-ers: 

Laurent and I would like to thank you for bearing the duration of our 
presentation last evening. I am not sure if it was the desire to stay in 
the cool air-conditioned room or that the material was actually of 
interest :-)

Hans should have our presentation posted on the site soon. In that 
presentation you will find the URL for downloading a trial version of 
Rational Application Developer (RADv6) so that you can get access to the 
JSL framework.

As mentioned, we are deeply interested in hearing your thoughts and 
requirements for an open source community project for a RIA Framework. 
Please either email Laurent and I directly and/or post your 
requirements/suggestions to talk at lists.nyphp.org. We are especially 
interested in real world opportunities that can benefit from such an open 
source project. We would also like to hear your thoughts about a PHP IDE 
that provides functionality analogous to what was demonstrated last 
evening in RAD.

Here are some links that may come in handy:

After seeing the Eclipse environment in action at last night's presentation,
I've given it a try.

I have the PHP plug-in installed, and things look to be pretty solid.  The
big problem I've come across so far is the lack of SFTP/FTP support,
although perhaps I'm missing something.

I did find this:

http://www.eclipse-plugins.info/eclipse/plugin_details.jsp?id=293

Which I went ahead and installed.  However, I'm getting some error messages.
>From looking at the last time the plug-in was updated, I'm guessing that it
won't work with the latest version of Eclipse, which is 3.1 and what I just
installed.

Anyone know of any other options for SFTP/FTP access?  Any recommendations
for working with remote files, namely with subversion?


Thanks,

Hans, long way from ditching UltraEdit

Dan (and Laurent if he's on this list),
 
Thanks again for a great presentation.  There's a lot of material out there,
and I appreciate you taking the time putting everything together.
 
For those that couldn't attend last night, the JavaScript libraries we went
over are very complete, and offer a lot of flexibility for AJAX types of
applications, and more importantly, rich internet applications in general,
which is a technology that's sure to take hold soon.  Thanks to Dan's posts,
you can view samples, demos, etc. about what's available, and we'll have the
presentation and audio tapes on nyphp.org soon.
 
Most importantly, Dan and Laurent have come to us for feedback and community
interaction regarding the libraries and given us a great opportunity.  As
mentioned below, please give them feedback and get involved in making the
great libraries available as an open source project that could benefit the
entire open source community.  But like all open source projects, it has to
start somewhere, so it's up to us to get things moving.

I use subversion and sftp with eclipse 3.1.

For SFTP try Klomp.
Subversion I use subclipse.

Here's a bit of my install history.

sorry, didn't notice that you already had Klomp.
In 3.1 I am unable to load as well. I think they do explicitly say they 
don't support 3.1 yet...

Thanks Jonathan - I use svn so I'll check out the WebDav/subversion options,
as it's quickly becoming my favorite method of remote development and source
control.

I'd second that approach.  I've been using Eclipse 3, phpEclipse, Subclipse
and Subversion (using Apache SSL WebDav) and pleased with it.

I don?t know if this has been answered or not but,
this select statement simply returns the number of
records in the table.  Since you?re not returning ?id?
therefore nothing happens to the order.

Yeah, I've taken a quick peek at it in the past. But since you've
mentioned it, I will take a look at it again.

Hey Rasmus, where's my pfilter().. ;-)

But seriously, I can't believe there isn't a good modular library for
this or something.. I'm just imagining php developers all over the
world writing the same regexes over and over again... seems like an
incredible waste of brainpower.

For that first query, I think you want MySql to use the index on SID because
it limits the result set -- otherwise it would have to do a table scan.  

I'm not sure how MySql handles multiple index elements but perhaps having an
combined index on SID and ID could help.

Just curious. Are you using all the phpeclipse plugin or has someone 
tried the Xored Truestudio (foundation or professional). Their latest 
maintenance build are quite usable under Eclipse 3.1...

IMO Truestudio has some more advanced features and the plugin imitates 
some of the Java developement practises is Eclipse. The professional 
versions is commercial ($95/year) but the foundation might do the job as 
well, if you can forfeit some features.

Most browsers have an option to view source. Is this different than what

It all depends on what you are looking for.  If it's just the html
itself, View Source is the way to go, especially if the author formatted
it nicely by indenting blocks of code.  A network analyzer like Ethereal
is good for looking at things you won't see in the browser, such as http
headers, including cookies being passed from the browser to the server
and vice versa.  If you know how to read a network trace, the info there
is fascinating.

The combination of Live HTTP Headers and View Source should do it.  

Live HTTP Headers also has some options, such as filter out traffic
for images, favicon, etc., if you're just concerned with the HTML
traffic.

Hi,

I am trying to print web pages using FireFox on Fedora 4. Some pages, like 
Yahoo Mail only print blank pages. I also get blank pages when I do a print

I've been trying both; Eclipse 3.1 with PHPClipse and another install of
Eclipse 3.0 with the TruStudio package.  I haven't seen that it would work
with 3.1, but I'll give it a shot anyway.

It has been looking pretty good - some nice source browsing features, etc.
although so far it's missing some nice things, as far as I can tell (click
class to go to definition, UML, etc).

Those aren't very big deals, though.  My biggest problem with Eclipse so far
has been working remotely.  It's quite common to need to work on a remote
server when doing any type of web work.  I've tried mounting a WebDav server
in Windows XP, and having Eclipse use it as the project directory.  So far
it's ok, although there are some reoccuring errors that don't seem to hurt
the file consistency, but I'm not comfortable taking a chance for real
development.

The other missing feature in Eclipse is the lack of SFTP.  There is a
plug-in from Klomp, but it seems outdated, and only to work with 3.0.  I'm a
little surprised that Eclipse hasn't included SFTP (and even WebDav) access
in it's core, as most other editors/IDEs have.

I'm still seeing what works and what doesn't, and will post back what I find
the magic combo to be (if there is one).

Yup, that was me. And as one of my partners is demanding that the rest
of us get Powerbooks, I suppose I will find out soon enough which
method makes the most sense ;-)

I was working in a mac environment and installed MAMP on some 
designers/developers machines.
But to install subversion and some other packages I used darwinports.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Sessions on windows
Message-ID: <0IKI0011HC7E7ISE@mta1.srv.hcvlny.cv.net>

Hey folks,
 
I really must be missing something, and I just can't figure it out.  I can't
seem to get sessions working on windows.  I'm using PHP5.1 beta 3 (I just
upgraded to this, I was using 5.0.4, sessions didn't work there, either),
Apache 2.0.53 on Windows 2000 Professional (workstation, not server).
 
The problem appears to be that the session file is created (and it has data
in it), but not "re-read", meaning that a new session is ALWAYS created.
 
Apache was originally running as the "LocalSystem" user, I changed it to
Administrator, with no change.
 
Here are the PHP session settings from my system, with my comments about
what I've tried underneath (I doubt this will 'tab' well in everyone's email
client):
 
session.auto_start 	Off	Off 	; tried both on and off
session.bug_compat_42	On On		; tried both on and off
session.bug_compat_warn	On On
session.cache_expire	180 180
session.cache_limiter	nocache nocache
session.cookie_domain	no value no value
session.cookie_lifetime	0 0
session.cookie_path	\ \
session.cookie_secure	Off Off
session.entropy_file	no value no value
session.entropy_length  0 0
session.gc_divisor	1000 1000
session.gc_maxlifetime  1440 1440
session.gc_probability	1 1
session.hash_bits_per_character 5 5
session.hash_function	0 0
session.name   		FOOBAR FOOBAR	; originally running as PHPSESSID -
shouldn't matter anyway
session.referer_check  	no value no value
session.save_handler	files files
(*)session.save_path		C:/Documents and
Settings/Administrator/Local Settings/Temp/php C:/Documents and
Settings/Administrator/Local Settings/Temp/php

session.serialize_handler php php
session.use_cookies  	On On
session.use_only_cookies Off Off
session.use_trans_sid  	0 0
 
 
 
* session.save_path - (no, the star is not in my php.ini file) I've had the
save path at c:\temp, c:\tmp and the entry above.  I've had all of the
slashes in both directions '\' and '/' with no luck (I'm not even sure which
one is right anymore).  I've set permissions on all of the directories, and
their parents to "full control" for "Everybody".  Like I said earlier, the
file is getting written, it is just not being read back in.

Ok, here is my PHP test code.  Works fine on Linux:

<?php
session_start();
// Use $HTTP_SESSION_VARS with PHP 4.0.6 or less
if (!isset($_SESSION['count'])) {
  $_SESSION['count'] = 0;
} else {
  $_SESSION['count']++;
}

print "Counter=".$_SESSION['count'];

print "<br><a href=session_test2.php>Go to page 2</a>";

print "<br><a href=session_test_delete.php>Clear Session</a>";

?>

I also notice the data in the session file isn't encrypted in any way.
Should it be?  I would think it would be at least base64 encoded....

Any suggestions greatly appreciated - this is very frustrating!

Thanks,

Tom

Of course, that directory needs to be writable by the web server, but you 
don't want other users being able to read or tinker around with the files.  
Here are the perms on mine:

C:\PROGRA~1>cacls c:\temp

c:\temp BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)F

Hi Dan,

Thanks for the response.  I changed my save_path back to c:/temp, and
compared my permissions to yours (thanks for the command, BTW, didn't know
that existed), and still no luck.

As I mentioned earlier, it's weird because the file is getting written -
every time I press reload, I see the file.  The web server running right now
as the Administrator account, I guess it just can't read the file?  There
are no errors in the Apache error log.

Any other ideas?

Thanks,

Tom

Hi Leila,

I don't know if you can "set something up".

The options I can think of are:

* Run your text through the nl2br function.  Ex: nl2br("My Text with
newlines, etc.");
* Wrap your text in 'pre' tags 

Good Luck!
