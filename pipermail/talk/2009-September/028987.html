</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But account is the &quot;top level&quot;.  Every customer has an account.   
</I>&gt;<i> Every account has a type.  So really, the top level is account type,  
</I>&gt;<i> because that's the only table out of the three that has no &quot;parent&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> of it's own. But why would I create a customer and a  
</I>&gt;<i> customer_account table?  Sure, each customer has one and only one  
</I>&gt;<i> account, so it makes sense, just like each account has one and only  
</I>&gt;<i> one type.   But:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> account -&gt; account type
</I>&gt;<i> customer -&gt; account
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> aren't the same &quot;sort of relationship&quot; to me, even though they are  
</I>&gt;<i> both many to one relationships.  Tying the account table to customer  
</I>&gt;<i> at this point (customer_account) would be bad, because every service  
</I>&gt;<i> in the &quot;service&quot; table has one and only one account as well - so why  
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't we call it service_account and service?  The same sort of  
</I>&gt;<i> thing.  So at that point, I would probably do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> account
</I>&gt;<i> account_type
</I>&gt;<i> customer
</I>&gt;<i> service
</I>&gt;<i> service_definition
</I>&gt;<i> service_type
</I>&gt;<i> invoice
</I>&gt;<i> invoice_type
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but at that point, there really is no standard.  I sort of just  
</I>&gt;<i> picked &quot;meaningful&quot; top level tables.
</I>
What's wrong with that?  I think you've got it right -- it all comes  
down to the domain you're modeling.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bah, it's all confusing to me :) I guess there really is no way to  
</I>&gt;<i> do it. If there are 10 levels of one:many relationships, you can't  
</I>&gt;<i> underscore them all out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> one_two
</I>&gt;<i> one_two_three
</I>&gt;<i> one_two_three_four
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> would get quite confusing ;)
</I>
True.  I don't think a hard and fast rule is appropriate here.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tend to avoid that, as underscores can be really useful to keep  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things legible.  lowerCamelCase, to me, is just kind of ugly in  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> myslql and other rdbmses where identifiers are case-insensitive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you really want, I suppose you could use a standard where a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> double underscore indicates some foreign key: account__id  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> REFERENCES account.id
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you would do something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> first_name
</I>&gt;<i> account_id
</I>&gt;<i> last_name
</I>&gt;<i> service_definition_id
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's pretty much what I'd actually do in practice.  In every case I  
can think of, the trailing &quot;_id&quot; is enough to indicate that this is a  
foreign key.


&gt;<i> Stuff like that?  Even though first_name is just a field (and  
</I>&gt;<i> last_name), while account_id is the id column in the account table  
</I>&gt;<i> and service_definition_id is the id column in the service_definition  
</I>&gt;<i> table?
</I>
Right.  Like I said, the underscore doesn't have any special semantic  
meaning, unless the following two characters are an &quot;i&quot; and then a &quot;d&quot;

&gt;<i> And if you did the latter, would you do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> service_definition__id at that point?  or service__definition__id?
</I>
Were I doing things that way, I'd do the former.

But it's just a thought.  I've never done things that way, and it  
seems confusing -- the visual difference between _ and __ is too small.
