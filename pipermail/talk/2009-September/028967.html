They tar'd up the data from where? It might help you to know what
directory it was uploaded to. Although a clever rootkit would cover
its tracks, a clever kit wouldn't take down your server.

But really, the problem could be anywhere in the system. Was the OS up
to date? Latest version of PHP? Anything hand-compiled that hadn't
been updated in a long time? Are there FTP accounts (unencrypted)?
Anyone lazy about their passwords?

There are a lot of ways for a box to get hacked. But as Tim just
pointed out, it's usually something simple and obvious, like
connecting to FTP from Starbucks or emailing a password from an
internet cafe while on vacation.
