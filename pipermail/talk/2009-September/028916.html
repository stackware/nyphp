<PRE>&gt;<i> Essentially the thinking is that whenever you're processing code that 
</I>&gt;<i> involves a lot of tables or a lot of queries (and returned results), 
</I>&gt;<i> you end up with a bucketload of things named 'id' to handle.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For instance imagine pulling out the contents of ten tables through ten 
</I>&gt;<i> queries in one script, and all the ID fields are named, id.  Or if you 
</I>&gt;<i> are doing a SELECT query where you are pulling stuff from 3 tables at 
</I>&gt;<i> once and all three of them have a field that you need to reference 
</I>&gt;<i> named, you guessed it, id in all three cases.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The thinking being that if you don't name everything 'id' then you 
</I>&gt;<i> won't make mistakes caused by everything being named 'id'.
</I>
Kristina, this is so true. The moment I started dealing with more than
one table in a query I realized that I was probably going to get myself
in trouble if my id names weren't more specific, so I decided to opt for
the more cautious route even if it meant more typing.

I was starting to waver in my resolve though, so I'm glad you explained
things so well as it'll keep me from getting lazy.

&gt;<i> The flipside of the argument is that it gets darn annoying always 
</I>&gt;<i> forgetting whether or not in this table the ID is prodid or prod_id or 
</I>&gt;<i> productid or whatever it may be...and you're looking it up for the 6th 
</I>&gt;<i> time that day at 2 AM....
</I>
It's good to know the flipside--thanks.

&gt;<i> Or you inherit a database that's got fun ID field names like 
</I>&gt;<i> cat_subCat_xtab_id and you start cursing the day that someone came up 
</I>&gt;<i> with the silly idea that naming ID fields 'id' was a bad idea...When 
</I>&gt;<i> you start muttering things like &quot;this is a database, not the Iowa 
</I>&gt;<i> Writer's Workshop&quot; under your breath, you know it's time to leave and 
</I>&gt;<i> get that cold beer.
</I>
LOL

&gt;<i> And you've got to be consistent with your own database design.  If you 
</I>&gt;<i> decide now to go with prod_id, stick with that, don't all of a sudden 
</I>&gt;<i> start to think that the underscore is &quot;so last year&quot;, and start to use 
</I>&gt;<i> prodid...so you don't get confused between databases.  I've been guilty 
</I>&gt;<i> of getting bored with using the same old, same old field names over and 
</I>&gt;<i> over and making my life more difficult than it has to be...
</I>
You know, a couple of times I switched my naming conventions and it was
a PITA, so I can definitely see the wisdom in your advice. I finally
decided to just stick with a underscore as it's second nature to me
after all my years of front end production.
