Turns out I'm already hosting a site with GoDaddy and didn't even
realize it until I called them asking about their service. Duh. So I
have initiated transfer of all of my domains to them.

Incidentally, the now old ISP finally responded to my issue. But they
had to convert my account in some goofy way to do it. That's probably
what took them so long. And it still didn't really solve my issue.

But that's not the worst of it. They sent me an email with my password
in it totally in the clear. That should be against the law. It so
happened to be close to a password I use for banking and such. I just
spent the last hour changing passwords.

Man will I be glad when the transfers to GoDaddy are complete.

&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe the current &quot;ISP&quot; is trying to get rid of me and not answering

</I>
I have used linode.com for many years. Great service.
