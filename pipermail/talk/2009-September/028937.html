<PRE>I have about 10 sites with www.addaction.net -- and the primary reason i
have expanded my sites with them is their incredibly responsibe support.
they use cPanel for administration that the website owner uses (and it's
quite good). rates are good -- check out their site for a standard intro
special ($49/year). they are associated with a Registrar. my sites are
pretty fast but i never have much action (at least my clients have never
complained).

hth/spirits,

seth

I am totally, 100% pleased with addaction. they're in nyc

&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a problem. I cannot get the ISP I registered my domains with to
</I>&gt;<i> reply to my support requests. Initially they did respond to my request
</I>&gt;<i> and said they would look into the issue. However, I did not receive
</I>&gt;<i> any response since. I have sent numerous emails to them in the past
</I>&gt;<i> week and a half and tried sending new fresh ones without their ticket
</I>&gt;<i> number so that I received their automated acknowledgment with a new
</I>&gt;<i> ticket number (which I did receive so I know I'm not just getting
</I>&gt;<i> filtered). But still I have not heard from them at all. If I call
</I>&gt;<i> their hosting support group I get run around for 3 minutes before the
</I>&gt;<i> robotic woman invariably says &quot;we are unable to take your call right
</I>&gt;<i> now&quot; and hangs up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm looking for opinions about ISPs that handle domain
</I>&gt;<i> registration, domain management (basically DNS zone record updating)
</I>&gt;<i> and some hosting (with PHP of course) and how to transfer those
</I>&gt;<i> domains. I actually host my important stuff myself on a virtual
</I>&gt;<i> private server so I am primarily interested in domain registration and
</I>&gt;<i> management. The current ISP has very crude utilities for managing the
</I>&gt;<i> domains, changing DNS and so on. It can be a chore just to login and
</I>&gt;<i> operate their &quot;control panel&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone recommend an ISP that has the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * good responsive support
</I>&gt;<i>  * good, easy to use utility for managing domains, registering new
</I>&gt;<i> ones, adjusting DNS zone info, etc
</I>&gt;<i>  * affordable domain registration
</I>&gt;<i>  * affordable hosting with PHP
</I>&gt;<i>  * free hosting for small static sites
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone had any experience with transferring domains from one
</I>&gt;<i> company to another? I assume I just get DNS setup with the new ISP as
</I>&gt;<i> far as I can and then get the old ISP to transfer the domains to the
</I>&gt;<i> new ISP. But considing I have had zero contact with the soon-to-be-old
</I>&gt;<i> ISP, I'm wondering how I can actually get this done. It's not like I
</I>&gt;<i> can just tell my credit card company to stop all payments - they
</I>&gt;<i> control my domains.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if I paid for a domain for say 10 years, do I have to pay full
</I>&gt;<i> price all over again?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas would be appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
