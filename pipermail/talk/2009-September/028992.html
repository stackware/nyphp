Depending on how they were tar'd you should be able to see the path by 
querying the index of the tar file.

Not to re-iterate what Chris was saying, but, you need information in 
order to take appropriate action.
All things considered there are at least several thousand potential root 
causes to your issue, unless you have some direction and cooperation 
from the hosting provider.

Attached is a basic template/list I rundown with clients (I do a lot of 
security on the side, and at work too. :P ) who experience similar 
issues, I have had these be well over 30 pages, as some clients really 
have no idea how many entities are touching their systems. I don't want 
it to appear overwhelming or impossible to successfully discover the 
root-cause of your particular incident; but unless you can get 
root-level log/AAA access, or some serious cooperation from the hosting 
company, you're likely not going to be able to cover all the bases.

P.S. Don't pay for ASL, you can build it yourself, just do a little 
googlin' :o)
