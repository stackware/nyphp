Awesome, thanks for the info!  I've used MM Freehand before whichwas ok but still felt like there should be an easier way. I'll give visio a tryagain. (Haven't used it in years).

If you're using MSWord/Photoshop you will love Visio. Word and Photoshop are notvector drawing tools, Visio is and vector makes all the difference. 

 

Vector drawing tools let you adjust, move, group andmanipulate drawing &quot;objects&quot;. Every element in a vector drawingprogram is separate and can be selected and adjusted.  You can groupselect lines, boxes, text etc., to move or make group them into other &quot;objects&quot;for further manipulation. You can make a selection of lines thicker, dashed,rounded etc. 

 

To get started I suggest it could be helpful to try and finda template. if you can find something close to what you want it's a goodstarting place. From the template make yourself a &quot;personal template&quot;(maybe a basic drawing) to work from. Then I use my &quot;personaltemplate&quot; as I go forward.  Once I have all my objects it's easysailing. 

 

I've used Visio for years to draw and visualize complexconcepts and it does a great job allowing me to draw almost any type offlowchart, block diagram, site map, map, object space etc. 

 

Visio can incorporate bitmap graphics and embed them intodocuments, if needed. Large projects with many pages are supported. I haveprojects which an excess of 30 pages of detailed complex drawings. Be carefulthough as Visio does slow down if you make your projects too big. It doesrequire a powerful machine. 

 

There are other vector drawing tools such as Dia (Linux) andDraw (Corel). I assume you are talking windoz with Word and Photoshop. I triedto migrate to Dia but could not get my files converted satisfactorily. Yearsago I used &quot;Draw&quot; which was acquired by Corel and then it wasrenamed. I liked Draw as it also was a vector drawing application with supportfor bitmaps. Draw must be out there somewhere in a later incarnation with a newname? Anyone?   

 

I bet you can use Adobe Illustrator and achieve the samegoals. 

 

Good luck and happy drawing&amp;#8230;
