John, you are a respected colleague, but I'm not buying your logic
*here*.  Assessing risk and mitigating risk is something to be taken
seriously. I think we agree on that.  I'm not a fan of shared hosting
for any sort of serious business; just for the reason above. You can be
as strong as you want, but the weak link in that chain may well be your
neighbor.  

If one's business (and presumably livelyhood) depends on a web server
-and the above is the risk model- then shared hosting *should* be the
first thing chucked out the window. (This is where you say 'not an
option' and I quickly retort 'horse hockey') Dedicated/Managed hosting
is in reach for any serious business.  If a business can't afford it,
then don't do it. To wit.. If you *must* jump into shark infested
water, make the small financial investment and rent a shark cage. Those
are the odds that you can buy.  No amount of spray-on-shark-repellent
can compare to that... or even wearing an extra fake limb so the shark
will bite it thinking he 'got ya' and goes away.
