Unless your server is running suphp or some other method of executing
your scripts as 'your' user, all instances of php running under apache
will be run as the non-privileged apache user (www-data/nobody/???).

The idea of storing these types of things outside the web root is mostly
to defend against attacks that would result in this content being served
directly, which is a good thing to do, but not really what you're
talking about.

&gt;<i> However, I am not sure if that protects it from php executing on that 
</I>&gt;<i> directory.  For example, if someone exploits another part of the server 
</I>&gt;<i> and gains the ability to access areas of the website by utilizing php 
</I>&gt;<i> code to traverse the file system and open documents, could they access 
</I>&gt;<i> that directory?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like the answer is yes and therefore this solution has holes in it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments appreciated on implementing this tactic and/or suggestion for

</I>
Basically, if you are on a shared server there is very little you can
really do to secure your database connection.

One possible solution would be to use ioncube or zend to encode your php
files, including the database details.  This will deter the casual
snooper, but with the right prodding your scripts will inevitably give
up access to either the login details or an active database connection.

Essentially this comes down to the fact that you cannot give any real
assurance of security unless you can trust the environment on the
machine, as any determined hacker with access to your scripts (encoded
or not) will be able to gain access to the data one way or the other,
whether it be by examining the source or executing the encoded script
and watching such things as defined functions, constants and variables,
and looking for any error output.
