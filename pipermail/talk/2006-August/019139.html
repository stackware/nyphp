<PRE>Cake is a framework I've had my eye on for a long time. One of the things
I'd like to see is what makes it better than all the other php mvc
frameworks out there? Also it would be nice to see some examples of how it
works with ajax. When is the September presentation? I don't see it on the
nyphp calendar anywhere.

YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! Bravo! I'll travel all the way from downtown for
this!

You know that folks who are totally new to this are gonna want a lightning
intro to MVC, likewise associations.

I would love to see you bake a little app before our very eyes with
bake.php (I can't wait to hear all the oooohs and aaaaaahs)

I'd like to find out how you handle advanced input validation and
filtering. (The jury seems to be out about the proper way to apply
multiple validation rules to one field.)

I'd like to see how you approach authentication.

I'd like to see an introducation (that was a typo, but I like it) to ACL.

I'd like to see how you write a model and controller that would support
&quot;advanced&quot; database searching (from the users point of view), meaning
building SELECTs on the fly from user input

I'd like to know how you approach integration with a popular CMS such as
Drupal.

I'd like to hear your recommendations regarding hosting Cake apps on a
shared server running PHP 5 in cgi mode.

I'd like to hear about what we might expect in future releases.

We have how long for this, just six hours? (-:

Following up on David's point, don't forget that there are likely to 
be people there who will need to hear from the beginning what is 
going on.  You can do this briefly so as not to bore those who know 
it already, but you also don't want to bore those others by 
discussing nothing but advanced details.

</I>Man I miss the enthusiasm of the New York PHP community. If I ever get 
that private jet I'll be attending the monthly's again.

I'd ask to address the &quot;all or nothing&quot; question. Frameworks tend to 
require an religious adoption of the entire framework (overhead, 
environment, etc) and that can be a small problem ;-)  What about cake?

Maybe implement a navigation layout to show how to make use of reuseable 
'layouts'?  When I making a demo site in Cake, that was one of the first 
things I tried to do and I had a hard time figuring out how to highlight 
the current page if it was a static 'page' and not a controller that was 
getting called.  I'm not even sure now if the way that I did it was the 
'right' way to do it.
