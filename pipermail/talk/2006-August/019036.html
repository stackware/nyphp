</I>&gt;<i>John, you are a respected colleague,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Why thank you.

&gt;<i> but I'm not buying your logic *here*.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Well, not like that's never happened before.

&gt;<i>Assessing risk and mitigating risk is something to be taken

</I>&gt;<i>for any sort of serious business; just for the reason above. You can be
</I>&gt;<i>as strong as you want, but the weak link in that chain may well be your
</I>&gt;<i>neighbor.  
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed.

&gt;<i>If one's business (and presumably livelyhood) depends on a web server
</I>&gt;<i>-and the above is the risk model- then shared hosting *should* be the
</I>&gt;<i>first thing chucked out the window. (This is where you say 'not an
</I>&gt;<i>option' and I quickly retort 'horse hockey') 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed, for that risk model, in most cases (but not all).

&gt;<i>Dedicated/Managed hosting is in reach for any serious business.  If a business can't afford it,
</I>&gt;<i>then don't do it. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think we will have to disagree here. The base cost of a managed 
hosting arrangement may be affordable, but dealing with the ... ahem... 
difficult personalities in the server room, may not be. Sure if you know 
your way around a server, you can &quot;manage&quot; a relationship with a 
sysadmin under a managed server arrangement. However, just as surely as 
greed corrupts, a naive small business owner may find herself paying for 
everything &quot;extra&quot; while still not keeping reasonable control of her 
&quot;livelihood&quot;. I have counseled too many whose sites were practically 
hostage to the host or (worse) design firm pretending to be host  (gasp!).

I know your style, Michael, and I can assure you that integrity thing 
you insist on perpetuating is very, very rare out there.

Anyway, point much appreciated. Shared hostng is the first thing to 
re-consider when in need of security.
