<PRE>&gt;<i>From a non coder perspective...
</I>
Welcome to the land of the enterprise! We are a business driven sector that seldom listens to technical reason. I've had serious compliance patching shot down by people that don't even understand the issues nor ask about them.

However, all is not lost! Here are the guidelines I use as an SA.

1. I choose whether or not I do a good job. My boss decides what the objectives are and I will work hard to achieve those goals. If I can make something more useful *and* meet corporate objectives I do so.

2. A helpful person is better than a smart one. The office is full of people who want to seem smart. I prefer to explain and educate, hopefully helping my co-workers smarter than me so I don't get paged in the middle of my beauty sleep. When my operators solve issues my life is better.

3. This day will never return and your work has spent money on the assumption you have a current skill set. So set up a few minutes here and there to be learning something new or practicing rusty skills. Not only will it keep you fresh but you may need that skill down the road.

I'll add Peter's great suggestions. Read &quot;The 7 habits of highly effective people&quot;. My number 2 on the books most positively influential. After that read &quot;What color is your parachute&quot;, number 3. You may want to better understand the work environment you thrive in next time you look for a job.  :)

ciao!

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [nycphp-talk] General Q; Programming Jobs &amp; Expectations
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hello all, 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been following the list now for a bit, lots of great discussion. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I recently moved to NY from NH where I was doing php/mysql/c development for
</I>&gt;<i> a small start-up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We had very detailed specs, excellent coding styles (use of includes, small
</I>&gt;<i> modular procedures and plenty of comments). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Software was engineered first through a specification and given at least
</I>&gt;<i> 'some' thought prior to implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, starting my new job in NY I am at a larger company that is much more
</I>&gt;<i> successful than my last. However,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am constantly running into files with no comments, spaghetti structure (or
</I>&gt;<i> non at all) limited includes (large amounts of duplicate code) and NO specs
</I>&gt;<i> what-so-ever on an extremely large project &amp; database(s) with 100's of
</I>&gt;<i> stored procedures (again with no comments).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This effects my work directly as it takes unnecessarily long to become
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with the code that is spread across multiple files and templates
</I>&gt;<i> with no comments or structure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, my question is: Is it unreasonable of myself to have expectations of
</I>&gt;<i> 'engineered' code or is this (current job) just the way things are.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it crazy to think I can change things from the bottom, by writing the
</I>&gt;<i> specs and speaking with the other programmers to reach a consensus on 'best
</I>&gt;<i> practices' and create 'grassroots' support? Should I just 'suck it up' and
</I>&gt;<i> put in my time, then move to another job?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been consulting along with my fulltime work for about 2 years now, and
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that is what I truly enjoy, being my own boss.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I do need a paycheck every week, so this is not yet a viable
</I>&gt;<i> alternative.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your time, I am eager to view your responses!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Ben
</I>&gt;<i>
