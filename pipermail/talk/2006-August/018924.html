who do have no accountability for what you do on that server.

 From the sound of things, you don't  need to collect SSN so why take 
that risk? As soon as it is entered, it becomes a liability (depends on 
what state you're in what the liability actually is).

It seems your college is actually rather porgressive in trying to 
protect student data and privacy: see

&quot;Added to the mix are.....&lt;redacted&gt;.... both small liberal arts womens' 
schools. According to Schneider, these two schools are interesting to 
the alliance because they have young, predominantly female student 
populations to lend diversity to the more technical campuses.&quot;

there is also a privacy policy online that seems to suggest info is to 
be safeguarded, although by a very quick read it was not a very 
pro-student policy IMHO.
<A HREF="http://www.*******.edu/sao/handbook/policies/privacyofrecords.php">http://www.*******.edu/sao/handbook/policies/privacyofrecords.php</A>

It may be that someone added that field as optional and 
just-in-case-it-might-be-useful so if you can find any policy at all 
that questions it, it might disappear from the specifications. Is the 
university involved in research grants from the government? If yes, it 
may be a covered entity under HIPAA, which regulates the use and storage 
of ss#. Maybe check your university IT policies on SS# just enough to 
find a need for clarification, to make the issue go away for a while?

Best of luck passing the buck.
