</I>Yeah well I knew there would be a slap from somewhere ;-)

I also know that my short term goals as a competitive webmaster don't 
always jive with the long term goals of a sysadmin, especially were 
standards and best practices come into play.

Honeypot...no. I was referring to a best practice db.inc where best 
practice (on a shared host, for example) still suffered vulnerabilities 
(out of site, out of root, etc yet accessible on a weakly-configured 
shared host). You've done what can be done on that host. Short of 
switching to another host, I'd obfuscate just as I usually buy odds at 
the craps table. If you are going to play, take advantage of what's 
available.

As for pissing off a cracker, that's not something I worry about as much 
as the opportunistic scanner or the kiddie who hijacked my neighbor's 
hosting password and is now traversing the tree for stuff to mess up or 
get free backlinks or looking for saleable information.
