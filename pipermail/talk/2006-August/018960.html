Yep, I can definately second that: coming from the UK to the US, I Iived 
in central-east NJ, on the shore for awhile. When I got a job in the 
city (SoHo) it was about 2 hours door-to-door (I drove and would park in 
Hoboken or Newport then catch the PATH) - 20 hours per week wasted on 
commuting! I eventually realized, even with the higher prices, it was 
better just moving to the city. But as other people have said, being 
single is different from having a family. But that was 10 years ago - 
rents now are absolutely insane. If you're a stock broker, lawyer or 
plastic surgeon, you can afford it much more easily.


&gt;<i> As for salary, $65K is too low for living in the city.
</I>

What would people consider a good minimum salary for living in the city?
