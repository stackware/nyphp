Well, Peter, I don't disagree that such subtle literary tweaks as double 
negatives and references to the sub-optimal status of pilot-less 
endeavors soften the blow of due criticism, but they don't fix the 
problems, either. Sometimes, stupid is stupid. Sometimes the kettle 
really is black, the ball was actually dropped, and the culprit really 
should be hung out to dry *if* &quot;the company&quot; cares to improve things for 
next time.

Of course there is a time and place for each approach to professional 
life. Were it not for the corporate speak, the layers of obfuscation 
created by &quot;management&quot;, and the subsequent inability of many such 
&quot;organizations&quot; to effect change, there would be no need for independent 
consultants (you know, the ones who are brought in to get the job done).

I propose to you that the same ancient Dale Carnegie stuff you cite, 
along with the ineffective &quot;play nice&quot; prefixes to what would otherwise 
be leadership statements, have contributed to the sad, unaccountable 
corporations we have ruling the world today. If no one takes 
responsibility,  no one is responsible. The damage done by &quot;the 
corporation&quot; as a whole cannot be challenged. Sadly, if most of the 
players play that game, either everyone has to play or there is 
disharmony. It is hardly accurate to blame that disharmony on the 
honest, albeit &quot;less sensitive&quot; employees. yes, i do recognize that in 
today's world, the losers are winning.

I also propose that the same corporate double-speak leads inevitably to 
unfair, mob-like behavior when finally change is truly required for 
survival. Someone gets to be the &quot;scapegoat&quot;, &quot;hung out to dry&quot; and 
&quot;heads roll&quot; where IN FACT the heads that roll were not actually 
resonsible for the problem. Had the proper steps been taken when the 
kettle was noticed to be in fact black, there would be no need for the 
unfair (and IMHO immoral) mob behavior.

Some of us choose to work outside of that (IMHO corrupt and corrupting) 
system.Others seem to choose to run with it, despite the apparent fact 
that there is an unsavory backlash brewing that our grandchildren will 
have to deal with.
