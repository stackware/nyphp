Hi John,

What about adding the variable to the url you are using in your js location.href call?

location.href='target.php?myKey=myVal'

Then you can access the variable on target.php using php's $_GET array: $_GET['myKey']

Does that help or did I misunderstand your question?

Hi John,

If I understand your question correctly, you could use this:

location.href='http://example.com/target.php?foo=bar&var=val'

The sample code you gave uses a relative URL where an entire URL path is 
required. If you use the fully qualified URL, you'll be able to append 
URL parameters in the common fashion.

(Strictly speaking this is not a PHP issue, as what you're doing is 
using JavaScript to redirect the user to a new URL, but anyway...)

Hope this helps.

- Allen

My main problem with Netbeans: no wordwrap.  Will content myself with 
using Kate for now.

In regards to the word wrap issue, there is a feature in Netbeans where you
can set the right most margin and manually make returns.  My monitor is
1920x1080 pixels so word wrap is not really a help for me.  I can see where
this would be applicable to netbooks or laptops.  Eclipse from what I can
remember doesn't even have native support for word wrap either, they have a
plugin but it is wishy washy and barely functions correctly.  I guess the
saving grace to all of this is that Netbeans has this featured targeted for
Netbeans 7.  Take a look at the thread here:
http://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=89894.  If it was TL;DR the
gist of it is that they tried to squeeze it into 6.9 but didn't make the
deadline but it is going to be in 7 stable.

By deleted records, do you mean they were deleted with:

DELETE FROM tableName WHERE .... ?

Or something like:

UPDATE tableName set is_deleted = 1 WHERE ... ?

If you deleted them logically, it's a matter of writing the correct SQL 
statement.  If you deleted them physically, good luck, especially with 
MyISAM, unless you had binary logging turned on or backups...

Hey all,

What's the best PHP obfuscator out there? I've heard Zend Guard mentioned a
few times, but it's a bit too pricey at $600/month. I'm not against paying,
but if anyone has any experiences or recommendations I'm open to them.

I've reviewed a few coder's work that would qualify, but I wouldn't 
recommend them.

Why obfuscate the code? Knowing the why may make it easier to determine the how.

Hello Lester,

What an excellent question. However, without going in personal likes or
dislikes on the merits or demerits of obfuscators a good starting point for
many things including obfuscators is  <http://sourceforge.net/>
http://sourceforge.net/ at least it will point you in the right direction to
help you make your own informed decision.

I guess the reality is if someone REALLY, REALLY, REALLY wants your code,
there is no way to hide it. I mean a guy recently used an electron
microscope to break obfuscation on an uncrackable chip.

People have already cracked iPhone/4.0 from Apple. And Apple has a room of
Stanford Phd's working on security.

So it's kind of a lost cause. But if you can do $600 a year, Zend looks ok
to me.

You are wasting your time don't waste your money as well.  Anyone with an
intermediate knowledge of php internals will be able to
decompile/unobfuscate/decrypt any of these products.  If the Zend engine can
read it and convert it to bytecode it can be unobfuscated.

Yeah that's the rub -- everything has a hole in it.

Still, obfuscation can thwart the efforts of many otherwise PITA obnoxious
students and losers living in basements.  I see thousands of attempts every
week from China alone, and have resorted to IP blocking and ridiculously
long passwords, among other techniques.  We can't keep everyone out, but
most hackers will move on to easier challenges.

Lester, what are your obfuscation objectives?

The typical use case for obfuscation is to deliver working code to a
client that doesn't already have a history of paying you.

When the check clears, the client gets the unobfuscated version.

Yes, they could steal the code and run, but they will still have to
pay someone with "intermediate knowledge of php internals" in order to
decompile it. One hopes it's easier to just pay you.

Hey all,

The use case here is something similar to what Chris mentioned above, in
that my organization develops and maintains a piece of software and we host
this software on the client's premises, not ours. The obfuscation is just
meant to be another hurdle to complicate life for the would-be attacker. If
someone was determined enough to break in and reverse engineer it, it
wouldn't be the end of the world either, as there is no mission-critical
code or super secret Google search algorithm within.

I looked at a few options and it seems like there are two classes of
obfuscators here- ones that use additional software (ie. loaders) and ones
that don't. The ones that don't are really crappy, since the only thing it
can really do is change the var names, constants and strings. The rest of
the syntax is still relatively intact (it has to be, otherwise how will it
be interpreted?)

The ones with loaders look more attractive. Still not a silver bullet, but
this is more attuned to what I'm looking for. The only other option is some
kind of PHP compiler that converts the PHP into binary, but we're not
willing to go there just yet.

Hope this helps

Lester

Lots of entertaining replies. :-)

A security attacker could simply replace the program with something  
else entirely. But I'm getting ahead of myself. If the main concern is  
that someone could break into the hosting site and change the PHP code  
to do something evil, than you could set-up a way to monitor the PHP  
(.php) source code. Do a 'sum' of all the .php and related files.  
Store this away from the PHP directories, and put it in the cron to  
run to do a 'sum' of all the .php files and send an e-mail alert if  
anything has changed along with the 'diff' output. This is assuming  
this monitoring is being done on a production server where development  
of the .php code isn't taking place with constant changes. With this  
scheme, you would be made aware of a change in any PHP code that's on  
the production server, and how it  has been changed. This may reduce  
the fear if wondering if the site has been attacked and if so, what  
might have been changed.

If a program contained the "secret sauce" I think I'd look at writing  
it in something that compiles like "C". At least there wouldn't be a  
reason to have source code for it of any kind running on a production  
server that's exposed to web attacks.

Hope this helps!

Wouldn't you want to invest in security measures than obfusctating the code? 
It is like putting all your money in a safe, but sticking a pad lock from Junk 
Lot on the front door. The thieves will crack the door no problem and then 
wheel the safe out figuring out to crack that later.
I assume that you do take other measures and that obfuscating is not the only 
defence. That said, you may want to take a look at NuCoder 
(http://www.nusphere.com/products/nucoder.htm). I haven't used it, but 
NuSphere is a halfway decent company who just needs to shape up on their 
licensing a bit. Their IDE is top shelf.

Hi Nick,

I've restored data in this way many times, as I'm sure have others on 
this list.   I'd be happy to offer some tips on getting the results 
you're looking for. 

What have you tried so far, and what results are you getting? 

This page is a good starting point, though you may have reviewed it already:

Is bin logging definitely turned on?

What's the output of "show master status\G" and "show global variables\G"

Probably worth noting.  Turns out if you connect PHP to one database and
insert a record in another database then the binlogs filter this together
with the database you are connected to.  In other words, I wasn't seeing any
inserts with the --database=  option in mysqlbinlog.  Ended up dumping all
binlog data and parsing it before reinserting my missing data.

This is correct behavior.

It's actually why I don't recommend people use database-specific 
replication.  When you skip a database or only replicate a specific 
database, it will only work if queries are actually selecting that 
database as the working database (in PHP, mysql_select_db(), and on the 
command line, use <database>;).

I've seen what you describe above break replication setups massively, when 
people think an entire specific database is being replicated, and then run 
queries like:

INSERT INTO DB.tableName VALUES (...,...,...);

And that doesn't get replicated.

A better thing to do is blackhole tables on a slave if you really don't 
want to store that data, and just setup replication normally - then you're 
at least guaranteed to have consistent data (though, you can't happily 
promote that slave to a master, but you wouldn't have been able to do that 
anyway with the original db-specific replication).

Just my .02

I'm working with a group that is centered around a Mailman mailing
list (imagine that!) and they want to add a private wiki that would
only be accessible by list subscribers.

Has anyone here built an authentication subroutine against Mailman before?

I'm pretty sure you could just craft a POST request to
/mailman/roster/listname or one of the other pages that requires
email+password auth, and check the response to see if it was
successful. If you have done this and have any tips or gotchas to
share, please do.

Message-ID: <k2g43bc541c1004161335j9487e66emafcedda556a0b7ae@mail.gmail.com>

I used to use CakePHP extensively in my projects but found its limitations
on certain projects.  I have tried Symfony but felt it was too heavy and
didn't like the whole kitchen sink model (or its ORM) for that matter.
Right now I am evaluating platforms on to build my next project on and it
has come to a couple of recommendations.  Django, Zend Framework, and
Spring+Hibernate.

What are your thoughts on ZF, what do you like about it and what do you
dislike about it?

Pro:
It's nice and modular so you can pick and choose what you use.
It has a lot of features/components.  I use a number of them (like Zend_Cache) in most of my projects.  Some of the abstractions for working with APIs are really nice too (Amazon, Flickr, etc).

Cons:
The MVC implementation feels a bit heavy compared to other frameworks - might be better with the ZF 2.0 PHP5.3 version since that allows for some shortcuts.

You should give Kohana a look.  Some of our developers have had good luck with that framework.  Lithium PHP looks pretty cool too but given that you found CakePHP limiting, not sure these frameworks will solve that.  Not really sure what you're looking for that Cake didn't provide or allow.

I have been working with Kohana 2.x and 3.0.4 as well.  My doubts come from
what is going to happen with 2.x now that 3.0.4 is here, not to mention the
complete lack of docs for 3.x...

I was also evaluating Spring/Hibernate and have seen it is really really
nice, Django too as well.

Gah,

So, after years of fighting to learn Mac...hating the one button mouse, etc
etc I finally had gotten an environment I was comfortable in.

Mercurial for Version Control.
Apache + PHP 5.3 + Passenger/Ruby on Rails
MySQL
Navicat
Netbeans
Text Wrangler
Komodo Edit
Virtual hosts setup for easy server creation
Local BIND server to resolve special set of local domain names to localhost
to make for easy virtual host setup

And then of course....just as I completed this, I moved and after mostly
finishing on April 3rd.......had a fire on April 4th and the house is
gone...along with my Mac.

For the price of 1 MacBook, I was able to replace not only my system but my
wifes and get everything functional.  So now I'm on windows and trying to
figure out how to replicate the above setup in a windows world......

At this point I'm strongly considering picking up a copy of Snow Leopard and
seeing if I can convert this thing into a Hackintosh to get my beloved MacOS
back......  Guess it's true, don't know a good thing till it's gone. :-)

Sorry to hear of your loss...

If you stay on Windows 7, I would suggest downloading and installing 
xampp. http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

You could also try using cygwin. http://cygwin.com/

Its not a framework, its a library of components.

Yes, you are correct.  So far during today experiments I have seen that it
is a loosely coupled library.  The experience so far has been positive.
With Ubuntu I installed it via Apt and I have the "zf" program in my program
path so using it anywhere in the file system is easy.  One thing that took
me a while was to figure out where the library was stored with the Apt
install.  I found the folder then created a symlink and everything was in

I used to use CakePHP extensively in my projects but found its limitations
on certain projects.

I'd also be interested to hear what limitations you came across with Cake.

On a few certain projects with CakePHP I found not being able use type
hinting a problem.  Also holding onto PHP 4 for as long as it can hurt us
OOP practices especially with namespace collisions and class prefixes.
Don't get me wrong, the implementation of Active Record is amazing in
CakePHP but when you build complex HABTM relationships loading data can be a
PITA, thus requiring me to go into each model and set the recursion for how
deep it will dig into the database because the arrays coming back are
massive.

In regards to the HABTM complex relationships it was more of a flying by the
seat of your pants, for example once the application grew we noticed that
the memory utilization was growing exponentially.  Unfortunately it grew so
much over a certain amount of time (Site got hit with the Digg effect.) that
one night it took the box offline.  The client got angry and basically
blamed us, after finding the docs on how to reduce the depth of calls into
the DB the damage was done.  We moved to Kohana after that where they
implement a different system for calling related objects.

I think CakePHP is pretty amazing myself.  A bit of a learning curve, but
really seems rock solid once you get up to speed.  I'm using 1.3x.

Of course, you can customize Symfony up the wazoo and can skip the ORM or 
replace it entirely. You should also check out

Coming from a CakePHP background you definitely should check out Lithium:

    http://rad-dev.org/lithium/source

Has a lot of emerging ideas and forward-thinking features that can't
be done with frameworks that aim for PHP4 compatibility.

Please note that at least some of those ideas (e.g. the universal constructor) are taken from Solar, which is comparable to ZF in structure and organization (and pre-dates ZF as well).  If you're considering ZF, you should consider Solar.

  <http://solarphp.com>

Here are some ways Solar is already in advance of ZF:

  <http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/1113> "The Future of Zend Framework is Solar"

Someone mentioned the Cake ORM system; here is some info on the Solar ORM (which is use-at-will):

- <http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/1184> "Solar Models vs. Zend Framework Models"
- <http://solarphp.com/manual/model> "Working With Models"
- <http://solarphp.com/manual/related> "Working With Related Models"

Hope that helps.

Hi all,

So I know all of these Saas Products like basecamp, lighthouse, etc. have 
come out recently that really make projects easier to manage.

However, recently, I installed trac on our server, and was trying to set 
it up ... but my project buddies didn't like it, and felt it was too hard 
to use. I saw there were plugins for it, but they were still concerned 
about its interface and usability.

What are you guys doing now-n-days to track things like lists of new ideas 
(with abilities to rank them/prioritize them), project documentation, 
ticket assigning, etc.?

Thanks,

Matt

I was confronted once with that issue and being on a 0$ budget I decided to 
write my own (it was better than paper and pencil, but still rapidly inhaled). 
That was several years ago and I am sure the offerings are much better now.
Aside from docs, the examples you mentioned can be done with any bug tracking 
software. The bugs/enhancements/ideas can be easily organized and assigned. 
They each get a number and for each development cycle you can use the numbers 
to do the project planning. It may be different in your case, but where I work 
the people who do the project management can care less what a bug is about as 
long as they know priority (which IMHO is high for any bug) and how long a fix 
is estimated to take. It is a bit different for new functionality, but even 
there the PM is more interested in a high level description. This works for us 
and our PM tools have no connection to the bug tracking. I can see how a 
connection would be nice, but I think a PM will not make much use of a link or 
it may become a source of distraction for the PM.
That said, you may want to look at two or three seperate tools:
- project management
- bug tracking / enhancement management
- customer support support tools (aka CRM, but you should have relations with 
your customers, not manage them)

Sorry, cannot name any specific names.

I'm a huge fan of Redmine (http://redmine.org) and use it pretty much
for everything I do - documents, files, release planning, resource
planning, bugs/tracker, wiki... There's also a voting plugin that
allows folks to vote on features, which is cool.

There's a demo site if you want to check it out: (http://demo.redmine.org)

I know there are some PHP efforts underway to replicate these
features, but I've always been a bit impatient :-)

Lastly this is a great excuse to take a peek at what RoR apps can look
like under the hood. If you've ever wondered what the RoR hubbub was
about, this is your chance to see for yourself.

I have recently been using Project Pier http://www.projectpier.org/.  So far
everyone in the office has been a fan of it.

Unfuddle is,  I think,  the best of that bunch.  Basecamp is beautiful 
but underpowered for real sw development.

I always think back when.

They project managed building the Empire State building with a Number 2
pencil and a pad.

410 days.  Start to finish. From a hole in the ground to the worlds tallest
building for 40 years.

Message-ID: <q2s43bc541c1004230830p378bfad2t1b7fde1fffa1a7fe@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I was trying to get situated with ZF and get my feet on solid ground with
the framework.  The official ZF API and Reference guides lacking quite bad
but little did I know that Rob Allen sits in a few chat rooms I freqent on
Freenode (#phpc).  Take a look at it if you are just getting up and running
like myself.  Quite basic but it gives you the juicy stuff on the MVC
pattern it uses as well as working with forms, layouts, views, and
validation.

Yup, Rob's tutorial is a must for neophytes.

The Official Quickstart is a good read, too.

Once you've got a basic level of comfort, and start thinking about how  
to implement your model layer, Matthew Weier O'Phinney, who IIRC is  
now the project lead for ZF, has a number of interesting blog posts: http://weierophinney.net/

Though they're not what you'd call tutorials,  his posts relating to  
model infrastructure and using zend_form in your models are valuable  
reads.

Matthew's blog is actually here: http://weierophinney.net/matthew/

The particular posts I mentioned are:

http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/202-Model-Infrastructure.html

and

http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/200-Using-Zend_Form-in-Your-Models.html

Though he's got some other nice posts as well.

Of course, people always get misty-eyed about things like that and 
conveniently forget things are a bit more complicated now.

Make sure you are sending a Content-type: text/html header.

Hi Aj,

It's really just a platform preference. If you're comfortable on Mac, use
MAMP and if you're comfortable on Windows/Linux, use XAMPP.  As long as you
stick to convention, it shouldn't matter at all and your files should be
fully portable.

Anthony

Huh?  One's for mac one's for pcs.

I guess it depends on your system as to which one is better.

Xampp works for me.

I think MAMP is a pain in the ass, and prefer to get the stack from
MacPorts.   The default MAMP install leaves you with stuff like a
different version of PHP for cli vs Apache, and it is a pain to
install additional modules.

I did have trouble installing xampp the first time around.  I had to modify
some file.  Don't ask me which one.

Last time I installed, it went well.

I use WEBuilder, instead of DreamWeaver or whatever, so with a little help
from the tech folks, I got it all setup to preview php files in my editor.

WEBuilder was like $60 or something.  I've encountered one minor problem
which I have not reported.

Xampp with WEBuilder cuts down on development time quite a bit.

++ on this one. I also use rails apps, memcache, and a bunch of other
non-standard stuff like LightTPD and macports makes use of all these
things a snap.

Didn't know xampp made a mac version.

But when I looked up mamp or whatever, it was specifically for mac.

If you've got some time to experiment, it's not all that hard to build  
an AMP stack from source on MacOS.

It is more work than using MAMP/XAMMP or MacPorts/Fink, but IMO, the  
flexibility is worth it in the long run.

I try to maintain a set of shell scripts so I can tweak/recompile as  
needed.

I tend to stick everything under some non-standard directory, so I can  
have multiple stacks for testing.  For example, if I needed it, I'd  
have no problems setting up 4 stacks for 5.2/5.3 under mod_php/ 
fastcgi.  This way, I can keep my local environment very close to  
whatever the production environment is for any particular project.

Try out the "mysqltuner.pl" perl script.  It can give you some nice suggestions.
http://blog.mysqltuner.com/2009/09/mysqltuner-v1-1-0-released/

Also, take a look at how many indexes your table has and the data length of those indexes.  Cutting down on the indexes will make inserts faster.

Add more ram and faster hard drives.  ;)

Those are some generic suggestions.  Someone would really need to dig into your hardware, mysql settings, and database schema to provide a better analysis.

Can you be more descriptive?  Try wrapping your inserts inside a single 
transaction.  What's your innodb_buffer_pool_size set to?  How much RAM do 
you have?  Are you sure you should be using InnoDB for what you're doing?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] innodb settings
In-Reply-To: <x2n3719ecad1004260953j465d2289xa94724e51624d0c9@mail.gmail.com>
References: <x2n3719ecad1004260953j465d2289xa94724e51624d0c9@mail.gmail.com>

InnoDB makes use of row locking as it is transactional.  If the row is
locked it will make it a little bit more interesting for inserts (last time
I checked the storage engine doesn't do table locks any more).  Also not to
push this off into another thread/mail trail but I think
mysql at lists.nyphp.org would be a better place to send this question too.
Look in your slow query log to see if you have any select queries which are
running slow that would extend a lock on a row (no index or a index that is
not left-prefixed).  If you want use EXPLAIN on those slow queries and hit
up the MySQL list and we can continue from there.

When you insert in innodb, it will check foreign keys, and like any 
insert it will update indexes, so those are probably THE bottlenecks..

What kind of inserts are they? Are you doing INSERT ... SELECT type 
stuff? If so, you can try this in my.cnf:
(from: 
http://harrison-fisk.blogspot.com/2009/02/my-favorite-new-feature-of-mysql-51.html)
innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2
binlog_format=row

If you have inserts with LOCK TABLES you can use this to disable that, 
which can be dangerous under high load:
innodb_table_locks = false

You can also try this (also from 
http://harrison-fisk.blogspot.com/2009/02/my-favorite-new-feature-of-mysql-51.html)
transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED

You can also package your inserts into the same statement like:
insert into tablename (field1, field2) values(1,2), (2,3), (4,5);
this makes inserts faster, and you can make that command as long as 
max_allowed_packet setting.

You can also use this:
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2
(from: 
http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/11/01/innodb-performance-optimization-basics/)

Also innodb_thread_concurrency should be set to 2 * (num_cpu + num_dsk)

When all else fails, see if you can change the tables in question to 
myisam or even move them into something like mongo, which does way more 
inserts per second than mysql.

experiment. try The Cloud.

at this point, really looking at zillions of records, you should  have close
to zero wait access times. everything is so ^%$^%&* fast these days. by the
time you finger comes off the keys, you should see your data.

186,00 miles/second.  or something like that.  :-)

Homebrew is built on git and really simple ruby "recipes".

Homebrew installs everything in version-specific isolated folders, then 
symlinks into `/usr/local` where local code really belongs :)

It's crazy simple to create your own Homebrew packages, just in case you 
have to install something from source.

It's crazy simple to modify existing Homebrew recipes... Because it's 
built on Git, any upstream changes can be automatically merged into your 
custom recipe.

Homebrew tries really hard not to mess with things that are installed 
elsewhere. MacPorts and Fink play fast and loose with versions and 
dependencies, and often install multiple copies of the same thing or 
existing libraries (i.e. your cli and Apache PHP versions will often be 
different).

Homebrew plays nice with ruby gems, easy_install, pear/pecl, etc.

Homebrew comes with bash-completion, so you can tab-complete all your 
package names. That's pretty hot.

If you don't like how something is done in Homebrew: fork, clone, 
commit, push and convince mxcl to accept your changes :)

Sounds like Portage (the Gentoo Linux package system, which builds 
everything from source using 'ebuild' files that tell the installer how to 
build a package). I use Gentoo on my servers so Im pretty familiar with 
it. There is a project (Prefix) which aims to bring this package system to 
other platforms like MacOS, Solaris, etc so I might try it out on Mac.

I know I asked about MAMP and XAMPP but Im now thinking building from 
source would be a better way to go too.

You decide where Prefix installs its stuff. Its a self-contained tree 
containing binaries, libraries, config files, etc.

Gentoo's Portage also has the concept of 'overlays' which are 
user-contributed package sets that can be merged into your 'default' 
package set.

With Portage you rsync with a mirror to update your package list. You can 
then update your installed packages with a single build command.

Portage allows you to install different versions of a package 
simultaneously using a concept called slots.

Portage has the added advantage of 'USE' flags: basically you can control 
how a build is configured by setting various flags in a config file. The 
flags are persistent so you will always get things built the way you want 
them when rebuilding/upgrading a package. Most packages have sensible 
default USE flags but you can tweak them as much as you want.

It is, in fact, a lot like Portage... From the Homebrew FAQ:

    Q: How about Gentoo Prefix?

    A: Gentoo Prefix seems pretty cool, but it isn?t optimised
specfically for Mac users and it duplicates worse than MacPorts,
including gcc and all that jazz. Otherwise I?d use it.

I would never recommend that on Ubuntu or a Debain package based systems.
Use "sudo tasksel" and then select "LAMP Server".  Tasksel is a package
management tool for the meta packages that point to the most recent version
of the software that exists in the stack.  That way you don't have to piece
together PHP5, MySQL, and Apache and their latest versions.  Since learning
about tasksel I have been loving Ubuntu 9.10 server edition and rolling out
new instances.

It is, in fact, a lot like Portage... From the Homebrew FAQ:

    Q: How about Gentoo Prefix?

    A: Gentoo Prefix seems pretty cool, but it isn?t optimised
specfically for Mac users and it duplicates worse than MacPorts,
including gcc and all that jazz. Otherwise I?d use it.


The initial bootstrap uses gcc that comes with XCode. The reason they then 
duplicate some stuff later is to remove that dependency.

Another way to go (if you need lots of different environments) is to use 
Ubuntu in a virtual environment. Ive used VirtualBox in the past. VMware 
Fusion is also very decent in Mac.

I'm a late comer to this thread, not sure if anyone mentioned it yet, but there's also Zend Server. I use community edition on my mac as well as ubuntu desktop and ubuntu server... works great, complete stack, nice little admin/management backend... free, etc. Installs from a repo...

The only source control I've used has been unix side.

 

What other kinds are there, maybe, that can be accessed online, rather than
on the server?

Hi Michele,

While source control definitely seems to be dominated by Unux/Linux,
there are some online tools you can use (some are even free).

I don't have the URL's for them but if you Google 'Free Subversion
Hosting' or 'Free Git Hosting' you will find several of them.
GitHub.com is the major one for Git, I think. Of course there's also
always SourceForge but they are often less desirable since you might
not be wanting to share your code with the public yet.

Good luck!

Michelle,

If you have a dreamhost virtual server, I'm pretty sure you can setup TRAC
and subversion from the control panel. So yeah you'd be administrating
subversion on your own (virtual) server, but through a provisioning tool.
There would also not be much to administer.

Personally I'd lean towards paid github hosting for hosting something closed
source for clients though.

Ive been using svnrepository.com for years now. Despite the name, I think 
also do git and *maybe* Mercurial.

CVSDude is now codesion.com (again, the name is a misnomer :-)

Interesting! Thanks for the tip. (Even when you crack wise, you're likely to
learn something from this list.)

    Maybe I'm old fashioned,  but I still install my server stack with 
the old

./configure
make
make install

on both Linux and Mac machines.  It certainly makes your machine grind 
for a while,  but it's not very intellectually challenge.  It seems like 
I often need to compile something a little weird into my PHP,  and I 
like the level of control over the configuration I get.

    Now when I want to mess with the "AMP" stack on Windows,  I use 
XAMPP these days.  I've never gotten around to figuring out how to build 
the AMP stack on Windows.

Hiya,

So I've recently been put in charge of a tech department at my company.
One issue that we are trying to get a handle on is a good way to get our
PHP applications from a development/staging environment to a production
server. The production servers are accessible via ssh/ftp/etc. One quick
thought would be to install a subversion client on the server and have
that export the application to a spot where a build script could then set
it up. However, is there a "best-practices" way of doing this?

Thanks!

Here's how I to do it.

As you said, have a subversion client installed on the server running your
web host.   If your doc root is /var/www/html,  have html be a symlink to
current code.

/var/www/html -> /var/www/tag_XXXX

The build script checks out the new tag to the doc root in directory
/var/www/tag_newtagname.   The last thing the build script does is switch
the html symlink from the old tag to the new tag to make the deployment
live.

Ok so it's not crazy to put an svn client on a production server for this
purpose.

Thanks for the tip!

I don't see any reason not to.    If you would prefer, you could run the
checkout from any server and FTP / SSH the files up to production in the
build script.   Thats actually the better way to go when you have multiple
web servers.   That way can have one build script handle all of them instead
of executing a separate deployment on each server.

If you're doing tags, I would recommend an svn export vs. an svn checkout.

Branches, use svn checkout (so you can svn up)

and you can also svn export to an nfs share, and then rsync from there
to multiple machines if you want.
the rsync and any other tasks can be done by a deploy script.
using that tag method you can also automate changelog through svn log.
you'd have to have the tag revision numbers.

    Although it drives certain IT people bonkers,  I think it's a very 
wise thing to put a version control client on your server.

    I would have a problem with letting it be CVS--,  I mean "svn".

    Although "svn" superficially improves on CVS in some ways,  my 
experience is that the CVS branching model is a perfect match for the 
challenges that I've faced in developing web systems that evolve.  That 
branching model can be emulated easily in git,  and that's what I use today.

So I'm a bit curious and perhaps I'm missing the point here (probably am)
but why go through all this hassle? Why not just do a straight FTP of the
files from the staging machine to the deployment machine?  Does using
checkin/check out benefit us in some way besides the original file integrity
and management?

The build script checks out the new tag to the doc root in directory
/var/www/tag_newtagname.   The last thing the build script does is switch
the html symlink from the old tag to the new tag to make the deployment
live.

I also use a similar method with symlinks.  Sometimes my web server needs a restart for it to recognize the symlink has changed.  It might be caused by php realpath caching or maybe there's some type of caching in my Litespeed server or CentOS.  I haven't taken the time to really figure it out.  At any rate, if you see problems, try restarting your web server and see if that fixes it.

This relates back to a question I asked about source control, I think.

Subversion deploys from development to production? so it's source control,
too, but only runs on the server?

I'd love online development side that you can check in and out online, so
you have check in options.

Not all developers are used to working on the server.  Back in the day, I
always worked on the server doing c coding.

But, a lot of times, I want to work on my own server then roll it to another
server.

Well, FTP is a fine option I think, but this deployment strategy I'm
trying to work into cruisecontrol.rb. My ultimate goal is to go to the
cruise control interface, click a button. Make sure my php unit tests
work, make sure php lint doesn't complain and on success, push up the
latest release tag to a production server. This would also allow me to
deploy to QA servers for the testers. Config files and files generated by
the application would need to remain in place.

Ahh, I get it. Makes much more sense.
Thanks!

Well, FTP is a fine option I think, but this deployment strategy I'm
trying to work into cruisecontrol.rb. My ultimate goal is to go to the
cruise control interface, click a button. Make sure my php unit tests
work, make sure php lint doesn't complain and on success, push up the
latest release tag to a production server. This would also allow me to
deploy to QA servers for the testers. Config files and files generated by
the application would need to remain in place.

FTP (uh, SFTP) forces you to upload the entire codebase or
pick-and-choose the files that changed. svn up just gets the changes.

Source control also gives you a quick and easy rollback when you
realize that one of the new files just borked your production site.

I additionally preferred the SVN checkout procedure to make the production environment a local working copy that could be used with "svn up".  One thing I had to do was make sure that none of the SVN files were accessible via the web.  You can throw the following code into a .htaccess file if you don't have access to the .conf files.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
 RewriteRule ^(.*/)?\.svn/ - [F,L]
 ErrorDocument 403 "Access Forbidden"
</IfModule>

You just never know what someone could do with access to those .svn directories.

I've been using svk on my server to mirror the entire repository (which 
is kept on a separate server off site).  One of the benefits I've 
enjoyed thanks to this is that the code tree that's checked out from the 
svk repo keeps all of the .svn stuff in my home directory. This way I 
can still sync changes but I don't have the svn files in the public tree 
at all.  I started with svk when I begin using trac, which has nice 
subversion integration but wants to have a full repository to work with 
(as opposed to a simple checkout of the tree). Svk allows me to mirror 
the entire repository on the server, yet still keep the main subversion 
repository somewhere else.

Well, FTP has the advantage of inertia. In a lot of IT departments, FTP 
is still considered a viable internet protocol, despite numerous 
problems: (i) it's over-complicated nature means that FTP clients and 
servers tend to be full of security flaws and (ii) it's just not 
compatible with the way the internet has worked ever since 1995 or so 
(NAT, Firewalls, etc.)

The inventors of 'SFTP' pulled a brilliant marketing coup by 
incorporated the three letters 'FTP' into the name of a modern protocol 
that has no relationship whatsoever with FTP.

Now, I'm assuming here that we're working in PHP so that there isn't any 
compilation, need to kick the server to unload Java classes, etc. 
Deployment issues become more complex as you have more artifacts like 
that. There's also the issue of how you deploy changes to database 
schemas and content.

If a system is busy, for one thing, I'd be concerned that many FTP-based 
ways of maintaining the state of a system would leave the files in an 
inconsistent state for several seconds to several minutes. There might 
be some some software out there that's smarter, but the obvious thing to 
do that "always works" is to delete the target directory and re-copy it, 
which means the system will be unnecessarily busted for some time. Rsync 
does better, but in my experience git, particularly with a local 
repository, is incredibly fast.

The big advantage for having your production system be 'checked in' is 
that you can make emergency changes directly to the production system, 
and then check them back into source control.

You certainly don't want to make changes in your production system on a 
daily basis, but I've faced situations, particularly when dealing with 
abusive user behavior, a wonky OS on the production machine, or bad 
interactions with external automated systems, where a very small patch 
to the production system (carefully monitored) is the most effective way 
to solve a problem. If your production system is checked in, you can 
manage this sort of change very easily -- you can keep track of what was 
done, when and be able to check it in or back the change out.

I've got a pretty nice system for website deployment on the server that 
serves up

http://ny-pictures.com/

that server isn't heavily loaded yet, so I often run development, 
staging and production environments on the same system. I can deploy new 
instances of my 'CMS' in less than a minute. The only real trouble I've 
got is that I've got some databases that take 30 minutes to mysqldump 
these days... Also I am starting to have a number of things that are 
"compiled" in my system such as metadata that controls the autoloader, 
the data dictionary, and, soon, a cache of commonly autoloaded classes 
that will improve the effectiveness of an opcode cache.

Now, if you're working in a clustered environment, where there are 
multiple copies of the software pushed out to multiple servers, that's a 
whole different game.

Sample code works for me, php 5.3.2.

I don't think it is the version of PHP you are using for example from my box:

anthony at anthony-desktop:~$ php -v
PHP 5.2.10-2ubuntu6.4 with Suhosin-Patch 0.9.7 (cli) (built: Jan  6 2010 22:41:56) 
Copyright (c) 1997-2009 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2009 Zend Technologies
anthony at anthony-desktop:~$ php -a
Interactive shell

php > $_GET['abc'] = 'def';
php > $dynamic_vars['a']['b'] = 'abc';
php > echo $_GET[$dynamic_vars['a']['b']];
def
php > if(isset($_GET[$dynamic_vars['a']['b']])) {
php { echo $_GET[$dynamic_vars['a']['b']];
php { }
def

As you can see I am on 5.2.10-2.

-Anthony

I couldn't find anything in the changelog... so that would make sense.

Could you pass the variable in from the url, instead of assigning it 
like an array...and let me know...
