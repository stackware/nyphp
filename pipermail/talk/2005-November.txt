Dan,

AB was set to repeat the request 10 times (-n 10)  and I also tried  
running the test a few times (letting the load settle between tests)  
on a few machines.   The results were consistent

All that being said, I must admit to being under the influence of  
*WAY* too much caffeine on Friday.   Consequently I'm happy to eat  
crow and admit my test was a little skewed. The problem was with the  
size of string I was constructing:

for($i=0; $i<100000; $i++)    $string="A{$string}B";

By the end of the test, $string was a couple hundred kbytes in  
length.   If you run the same test with a fixed string that does not  
grow, it looks like the glue method runs a few ms faster than the  
double quoted method.  This leads me to believe that the concatenate  
operator only gets slower when working with large variables and for  
small variables it really doesn't matter.

On a side-note,  it would be fun to see some more definitive  
benchmarks on different aspects of the PHP language.  In the process  
of teaching the php essentials courses I always get a few questions  
on whether double quotes are slower than singles, foreach vs while vs  
for loops on arrays,   echo vs print,   include vs include_once,  
etc.   While the answers are fairly intuitive, it would be nice to  
measure the actual impact in a slightly more scientific fashion.    
I'm guessing the results would also vary from version to version  
too.  Maybe when I run into some spare time....  (ha!)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Should labels/tags be inherited?
Message-ID: <b76252690511020841k64647280te7ec7e9d0639d875@mail.gmail.com>

Not strictly a PHP question, but maybe other developers on this list
are thinking about folksonomies and adding labels or tags to content,
so...

Suppose I have an image object stored in my system, with the single
label "fun". And suppose that I attach an audio object, describing the
image in my own words.

The image is at /csnyder/images/001.jpg and the audio is at
/csnyder/images/001/description.mp3.

Should the audio object inherit the "fun" label?

On the surface I would say no, because the audio might not be "fun" in
the same way that the image is "fun". But the audio is directly
related to something that is "fun", and should probably show up on the
"fun" summary page and RSS feed.

And in applying the same situation to messages in a discussion thread,
you would almost always want the labels you assign to the thread to be
inherited by the individual messages, as long as those messages are
"on topic"...

Any thoughts?

I don't think you can generalize this easily, it depends on the nature
and structure of the content in question.  It may be nice to allow for
inherritance in some cases, but suppress it in others.  I frequently
find the need to turn on and off inherritance in content models.

If all child objects of an object are always directly related to the
object, allow the inherritance - it is essential a new attribute of the
parent object.  Sometimes objects might just be broad containers for
other content, and in that case, suppress it - its really just a
sub-object, very little relation otherwise.

In your case of the image - your audio describes the image.  In your
content structure, if all sub objects of images further qualify the
image, give it more value as content, or are attributes of it like I
suggested above I'd say sure, appropriate to inherrit there.

In the case of discussion thread messages, thats tough.  I don't think
there is a hard and fast rule there, as the nature of the content is not
structured.  You can't say whether a sub-object (a reply/comment) should
always inherrit.  You almost have to leave it to the message authors or
maybe a moderator to determine whether it is "on topic", and therefore
should inherrit.

HTH,
Andrew

This is purely subjective, but I would say no. My reasoning is that it 
leaves you with full flexibility, so you're not polluting your tags in a 
way that can't be undone.

It's easy to consider tags of parents as tags of the child in your code, 
and you can store these separately, so you can distinguish between them 
(even if you have no such need right now).

Stated differently, I like to err on the side of having too much 
granularity - I can always group data in the code without losing 
information (like the fact that the image was labelled fun and the audio 
just inherited the label).

The sepearation of code logic and display seems intriging to me, however,
I'm not sure that programmers could be able to create the back end logic and

i would not consider smarty to keep all logic from the designer, well unless
you put html in some variables and display just the variables in smarty
templates. Smarty templates have the ability to have conditional and loop
statments so that your backend can just pass an array and the template will
display it however the designer wished. In a sense it is seperation but not
totally.

Your programmer will have to do the templates if your designer has no idea
about loops/conditionals etc..

Strictly speaking if your team has a designer responsible for just 
creating look & feel and usability, than you will likely will need 
someone technical to implement the design.  And this person will need 
some level of display logic for looping/conditionals/etc.  For this, we 
usually use PHPSavant, since it gives the person doing the 
implementation the full power of PHP.  Then we enforce design guidelines 
to keep business logic far away from the template and UI  implementation.

We've also used PHPTal, since the template language is abstracted and 
theoretically the backend programming language could be Python, Ruby, 
Perl or even Java.  But it turned out learning a new templating language 
(similar to Smarty) seemed like too much overhead for us.

Good luck.
Brian

Mark,

I did one project using Smarty, not knowing it all when I started, and found 
it fairly easy to use and liked the results.  However, it wasn't totally 
successful becaue the designer had issues with .tpl files and using his 
tools to for the job (Dreamweaver, etc).  I'm not even sure what the problem 
was.   All that is really needed is the name of a template and to not mess 
around with what's between the curly braces. The rest is just pure design. 
I think the number of include files, the .tpl extension and the idea of 
design as a complete canvas instead of included elements is confusing to 
some people, so a big part - if not all - of my decision to use it in the 
future would depend on how the designer feels about working in this way.  I 
like it, though.

JD

Templates are essential, and Smarty is fun. But there is a lot of
overhead to Smarty, you have to learn the ins and outs of another
language, and you end up with a more complicated system (more moving
parts, more opportunities for things to go wrong).

In a NYPHP presentation a couple years ago (has it been that long?) we
put Smarty head to head with a couple other template languages, and
with PHP itself. PHP blew them all away in performance and (in my
opinion) simplicity.

PHP makes an excellent template language when used with "short tags".
Dreamweaver still can't handle loops and conditionals, but it doesn't
choke on the code either.

An example of PHP template:

<html>
<head>
<title><?=htmlentities($title)?></title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Today is <?=date('M j, Y')?>.</p>
<ul>
<?foreach( $messages AS $message ){?>
  <li><?=htmlentities($message->subject)?><br />
       <?=htmlentities($message->body)?>
  </li>
<?}?>
</body>
</html>

When working this way you need to write a simple template class that
will search for the appropriate template to use from some path. Once
identify the template to use, you just include() it (possibly inside
an output buffer) and you're done.

I swear by templating, even it the team size is only one -- it forces a
presentation/business/date layer thought process. I use Smarty and have
a love/hate relationship with it. It has many powerful features, but as
some have noted, forces you to learn YAL -- yet another language. And at
times, understanding the "flow" of things can be tiresome.

At the Zend conference, I heard that Flicker uses Smarty, which in
essence nullifies my performance concerns. And it has a built-in caching
mechanism.

I am intrigued by Chris' comments and analysis though. If used as
intended -- for design, a Smarty .tpl should have an absolute minimum of
logic (just simple presentation logic) and mainly HTML with tags. So if
you can force yourself to use a PHP template structure of
<?=htmlentities($stuff)?>, why not? But how will you eliminate "PHP
creep".

The Smarty I used was just a simple templating language.  The structures 
were set in a PHP control file and assigned to template variables.  Big 
decisions like 'auth' 'logged' etc would be PHP decisions of what template 
was called, and the standard logic of  {if results then loop else nada} 
would be the kind of Smarty code that I would put in the template.  I think 
of it as output logic and an acceptable bare minimum.  The whole thing for 
me was the designer would rather eat Brussel Sprouts all day than work with 
it.  That's a very big problem.

I attempted this a while back for a client who used a 3rd party database to
get thier content, the database was on a windows machine and MSSQL, however
they ended up not being able to fully fund the project so gave up.

I did find one thing that you had to install on linux to get linux to
communicate with MSSQL however when i talked with a lot of hosts they would
not install it because it had security flaws and has not been updated in
years.

To furthur this project we would have to get a dedicated server and install
the package that was needed

http://www.freetds.org/

I tried many things but i could not get php to communicate with MSSQL on a
windows machine without the use of FreeTDS and even then it seemed to be
particularly difficult, had to tweak stuff to get it initially installed.

I hope this helps :)

I would like to note that i have since checked the CVS and it shows some
updates within weeks/months not years :) The part about not being maintained
for years came from a few of the hosts i spoke to.

Wow, what a great PHP templating method.  I am definately going to have 
to re-evaluate my use of the Smarty system.

I work pretty much all day every day with a system that uses Smarty 
templates.  A few years back (already? geez...), when we wanted to port 
an MS-Access database app to PHP/MySQL, I came up with a sloppy hack to 
handle user permissions, navigation, ad-hoc reporting, etc., through db 
tables, and use Smarty templates to format the output.  The system has 
served us well so far (I'm even speculating that it could be useful to 
other people for other applications).  Although, as Chris points out, 
it's a leaner/meaner system that does the templating natively in PHP, 
we've been quite happy with Smarty all this time.

As for the original question, I, like others here it seems, see the 
"separation of logic and display" as kind of a gradient scale -- any 
display system is going to need logical programming structures to handle 
dynamic data.  But a template system of some sort is just about the only 
way you're going to separate business logic from display logic.

"PHP creep" is not so much much more an issue with native PHP templating 
than it is in Smarty, or other template systems that (even reluctantly) 
allow you to include PHP code in your templates.  The point I think is 
not to worry about language-creep but about function-creep: as long as 
the code within a template exists for the purpose of receiving and 
displaying data, shouldn't that be enough to keep things working cleanly?

Good luck finding the system that works for you, Mark.  There are lots 
of choices. The NYPHP presentations page 
(http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/index.php) has links to two 
presentations on the topic, which may help you a little:
http://davidmintz.org/presentations/show.php/QuickForm_and_Smarty (audio 
at http://www.nyphp.org/content/mp3/nyphp072704.mp3)
http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/3templates/ (audio at 
http://www.nyphp.org/content/mp3/nyphp092303pt1.mp3)

Whatever you choose, somewhere you're going to commit to one method or 
another, and you'll deal with the learning curve and make a system that 
does what you need.

I've noticed that if you use e.g. HTML_QuickForm (a Good Thing, IMHO) then
you eventually find yourself almost coerced into getting involved in
Smarty (or some other template engine), because QF's default renderer is
just adequate for the simplest of display tasks, and customizing it
heavily is really tedious. OTOH your Smarty templates end up looking like

	{if $form.lastname.error}
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>{$form.lastname.error}</td></tr>
	{/if}
	<tr><td class="label">
		<label for="lastname">Last name</label>
	</td>
	<td>{$form.lastname.html}</td></tr>

which about as ugly as the other alternatives. Still, I think it's worth
it. I have taken to sticking the form initialization work into the same
classes that do the db access work. The result is that the PHP scripts
that control the flow end up being short and sweet.

We use PHPLIB from PEAR,

http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_Template_PHPLIB

Its dead simple to use, just setting template variables and parsing template
blocks you define. Pretty much completely keeps programming logic separate
from the design phase. All that if/looping stuff is great and all but I'de
rather just handle it in the php, its not that hard. Maybe I'm just not used
to smarty but embedding php variables/method calls into the template seems
like something that will cause pain further down the line as well. The only
performance issue I have run into is if you need to parse thousands of items
on one page there is a big slow down. In these cases (like big tables) we
just embed a little bit of the html in the php.

Using HTML_Template_ITX (from PEAR), the same snippet would look like:

<!-- BEGIN FORM_ERROR -->
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>{FORM_ERROR_MESSAGE}</td></tr>
<!-- END FORM_ERROR -->

<tr><td class="label">
<label for="lastname">Last name</label>
</td>
<td>{FORM_LASTNAME_HTML</td></tr>

The advantage being that the HTML guy would already know what the <!-- -->
tag does. THe rest of it doesn't look as confusing, either, IMHO. I really
prefer HTML_Template_ITX over Smarty. I agree with you about making the php
code cleaner, it really does. Here's what the php for this block would look
like:

if ($form.lastname.error) {
$template->setCurrentBlock("FORM_ERROR");
$template->setVariable("FORM_ERROR_MESSAGE", $form.lastname.error);
$template->parseCurrentBlock();
}
$template->setVariable("FORM_LASTNAME_HTML", $form.lastname.html);

My 2 cents :-)

Since nobody mentioned it, I will.
For a long time now I surrendered to simplicity, but achieving my gols easily.

With TemplatePower it's very easy to work, although the license
sucks(even if cheap).
http://templatepower.codocad.com/

I let the designer design and produce layout /css and then I just add
tags like {THIS_IN_HEADER} or {FORM_ACTION} or even replace form
button values to make multiple language applications very, very easy
to implement.

Uhh, yeah, umm... I'm not sure. The new one. Yeah. That's what I get for
working on eight things at once ;-) Anyway, the idea is that you can reuse a
particular block of HTML for the same purpose, i.e. if you have multiple
error messages, you just slap em in an array, and parse a new error block in
a foreach loop. Saves lots of time!
CHeers,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] URGENT: my ibm t41p laptop motherboard is messed up
Message-ID: <20051102215016.GA13183@panix.com>

Hey Folks:

I bought an IBM 41p laptop last year.  As mentioned the other day, I 
recently installed FreeBSD, Apache and PHP on it.  This is in preparation 
of preparing a talk I'll be giving a week from today at the International 
PHP Conference.  Well, my laptop's sytem board is now having intermittent 
problems.

I called IBM support and they're not allowed to send me the system board.  
The only way to get such a board is to send them the machine.  Well, 
that's not gonna work timing wise.  First, I need the machine to finish 
testing my stuff before I go.  Second, I'm leaving on Sunday.

So, I'm hoping that some of the good people here have some connections, 
please.  Some semi-plausible thoughts that are running through my head, of 
which one should suffice:

* Someone (who knows someone) who's an IBM technician obtain the part for 
me.  The original part number is 93P3313, but that's not available any 
more.  The substitute part is 39T5495.

* Someone has a similar IBM laptop which I can borrow for two weeks, 
allowing me to pull my hard drive out of this laptop and into yours.  I 
must compliment IBM for the elegant design they employ that allows the 
hard drive to be slid out w/o opening up the machine at all.

Crossing my toes,

--Dan

Just thought I'd chime in.

I think the advantage of Smarty (and like tools) is not so much 
separation of logic and display, because, as many have pointed out, 
it's got conditionals and looping, which to me is "logic".

I think the advantage of a system like that, on a large team, is 
really just control or security.  In other words, if your templating 
engine can only do certain things, this means that the templates can 
also not possibly screw something else up.

That said, I tend not to use any kind of templating.  For me, writing 
{%variable%} is not any easier than writing <?php echo $variable; ?>, 
and I'd prefer to just have my layout people learn a smattering of 
PHP (rather than some arbitrary template syntax), so that they 
themselves can learn to understand these issues, and can expand their 
skill set.

So I enforce the logic/display paradigm through discipline.  Our 
publishing engine just has this separation built in, and our 
'display' files only contain variable echoing, and simple logic or 
looping.  The rule is, basically, no "calculations" or "data 
retrieval" happens in the display files (duh).

But, if issues of control or security were extremely important to me, 
or if my team was too large to monitor, then I might reconsider 
routing everything through a templating engine and accept the 
performance hit.

If I jostle the computer, one of two things happen:
    * the monitor's image gets jumbled/pixelated
    * a line appears across the monitor, the the system freezes and then 
      the image gets whiter and whiter as time goes by

Before I even finished describing what was going on the person at IBM knew 
exactly what I was talking about.  Based on past experience and the rep's 
take on things, I'm confident it's the system board.

Thanks,

I've looked online but yet haven't found anything to help me narrow it down. 
Any ideas?

Dan,

This isn't the original string, but it's the error I've been experiencing. 
Just a three element array of strings.

Thanks,

Weren't there some unserialize bugs in older versions of PHP? Maybe
you need to upgrade?

John,

It looks like you are introducing slashes into the string somewhere.

If you change the string to:

a:3:{i:0;s:3:"foo";i:1;s:3:"bar";i:2;s:11:"foo bar you";}

it will work fine.

Aha,  I found the error.  Dang it.

   if ($form->validate())
      {
        //$form->applyFilter('__ALL__', 'addslashes');
        //$form->applyFilter('__ALL__', 'htmlentities');
        $form->process('do_action', true);
      }

I forgot about those. The serialized string was assigned to a hidden 
variable and Quickform was applying the rules.  Commented out everything 
works fine.

Thanks for the input,

JD

You might want to reconsider your reasons for adding slashes and escaping
html entities in the first place. If you're planning to use the data in a
db query you can use prepare/execute at query time. If you're planning to
re-draw the form, QuickForm will do the escaping for you. If you're
planning to store the form input in a db and display it later, you can
escape it at retrieval time.

If all this is insultingly obvious, my apologies (-:

Well, I liked it because that was one of the things that Quickform can do. 
I just have to apply it more carefully, heh. That code was really there 
because it included a nl2br for a textarea, but the textarea ended up 
getting scratched.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Trouble Updating an array in a class
Message-ID: <1131119325.436b82dde93eb@webmail.r2communications.com>

I am having issues with updating a property (which is an array) in a class.

In the class, I set the property:

var $modules=array();

There is a method in this class that fetches the modules from the database and
creates an array. This is called in my page, after the class is instantiated:

$moduleVars=$user->getModules($db);

At this point, if I loop through the array and print the results, I get...

NEWS =
ART =
CONT =
IMG =
PROJ =
EMP =
USER = 

...which is exactly correct. What I'm doing here is developing the permissions
portion of a CMS. So what I've done is set all my permissions to empty.

Now, when the page is submitted, I update the $moduleVars array with this:

	//pull modules and permissions from request string
	foreach($moduleVars as $moduleCode=>$moduleValue){
		if(isset($_REQUEST[$moduleCode])){
			$moduleValue=$_REQUEST[$moduleCode];
			//echo $moduleCode.' = '.$_REQUEST[$moduleCode].'<br />';
			}
		}

If I print the results out, I get the correct values that I selected for each
module:

NEWS = CRU
ART =
CONT = R
IMG =
PROJ =
EMP =
USER = R

Now, I have to pass this back to the class, and here is where my problem is.

Typically, I pull values from the query string like so...

$firstName=$_POST['firstName'];

...and then pass it to the class like this...

$user->firstName=$firstName;

This has always worked fine. But when I try to reset the array...

$user->modules=$moduleVars;

...and then print out what gets passed to the class, I get...

NEWS =
ART =
CONT =
IMG =
PROJ =
EMP =
USER = 

...as though what I am passing back is not the updated array, but the initial
version that was created when I called the getModules() method.

Can anyone explain why this is happening?

You are not updating the array. You are just updating the variable 
$moduleValue. You should update the array with a line like this:

$moduleVars[$moduleCode] = $_REQUEST[$moduleCode];

Of course you should be sure to scrub the value from the $_REQUEST array 
before you do anything with it, but that doesn't necessarily need to be 
done in the foreach loop.

Thanks, Scott. I figured it out just before this hit my Inbox. I knew it was
something simple like this.

> before you do anything with it,

Yeah, I do that. I just left it out of this particular discussion. Once I have
the updated array, I check it and clean it.

Hi!

I'm thinking about developing online game in php  like:
http://games.swirve.com/utopia
or
http://ogame.org

Both of them are real-time strategy  games. This means that if you make 
some action in this games, you have to wait for a certain amout of time to 
see the result. For  example sending an army to attack another province 
takes few hours of a real-world time.
My question is , how can I update periodically these kind of data in the 
database? I think I can do it using cron, updating game database every 
hour for example. Is there any other way? Usually you don't have access 
to tool like cron..

most web hosts allow you to setup cron, check in your cpanel.

I would suggest you run a cron and with each action you set the time it was
set as a time() timestamp, then just have the cron(s) check to see if X
hours has elapsed, if so follow through with the action.

Hi,

I'm just doing the same and had to do the same thinking. Our solution: 
Each dataset (for example the users credits) get a timestamp (last 
update). If a function manipulates this value, the timestamp gets 
updated. Every time another player accesses this value (for example he 
sends our a spy to see the opponents agent) the game has to check if the 
value is still correct (maybe tax were paid in the meantime and the user 
has not yet logged in to calculate) and if the value is outdated, the 
value has to be calculated correct, updated and a net timestamp is given.
The advantage is, that you don't have to calculate ALL new values at the 
same time (which can be very complex and long running, depending on the 
users), but you just calculate the new value on access. The second 
advantage is, that you don't need a cron, which is not availiable in any 
hosting environment.
The disadvantage is, that you need a more complex data storage and a 
on-access data consistency check.

We tried it and it works great (although the final test is still to come 
because our project is about 0.1% complete).
Hope you understand my point, my english is not very good ...

Then you have things like Evolution, which have an universal clock
that ticks like a regular  clock, meaning 1 tick is 1 hour.
Every action is based on that assumption and this allows, for example
for users to group and plan attacks, bcause everybody has the sime
time, a little like Swatch time.

Thanks, for all replies. Michael, I understand your concept very 
well. Actually, I thought about similar solution before posting my 
question on the list. But I thought about the same thing you had mention - 
complexity. Now I have to think about it once again.

I need to set up online credit card processing for a small non-profit
organization and I'm wondering what you folks recommend. This organization
has its bank account of course but that's it -- no merchant account or
anything.

I've surfed a few like charge.com that google turned up -- surprise! they
all claim they are the greatest. I have been looknig at echo-inc.com but
they insist that you open a business checking account with a specific
bank, which I think rather sucks.

So -- whom do you use and what do you think?

Thanks.

A true non-profit (in the IRS' eyes) should be careful about choosing a 
merchant service because it is actually a bank account of sorts. My lone 
experience with that situation required alot of attention from the 
non-profit's CPA (I can't say whether or not that attention was "smart" 
or just a big waste of time). They ended up going through their own bank 
at considerable cost.

I was visiting the website of an indie recording artist today,
and there was a link to paypal, where I could pay via
credit card or paypal.  I don't know anything more about
how it works, but the experience seemed ok to me,
and I think the public may be more willing to give
credit card info to someone like paypal than to some
small outfit that they may not be too familiar with.  I maintain
3 .org websites, all three are very small organizations
and I also am interested in how I might give them the ability
to accept payments online.

Thanks for bringing the subject up.

I really think it is a question for a CPA at that organization (or the 
one taking on that responsibility).

If a non-profit is "used"  to generate profits for someone, that can be 
illegal and can jeopardize the non-profit status  (I believe the legal 
term is inurement). If a non-profit loses its status thusly, it may be 
retroactively converted to a for-profit entity, which means 
back-taxes-plus-penalties-and-interest  as far back as the creation date 
(ouch!).

We can discuss all we like here but the real important stuff will be 
decided at the "corporate"level within each particular entity, based on 
their own comfort levels, risk management, accounting practices, state, etc.

I believe the law permits individuals to accept "donations" via PayPal 
as you describe... something changed  a few years ago in that area.... I 
am not a lawyer nor a CPA so this advice may be worth slightly less than 
the price you paid for it.

If the question you are asking is paypal a viable alternative for  
accepting credit cards, the answer is yes. The only downside is that  
if you are trying to come across as a big company  and you want your  
own payment system so it is all under one domain, so to speak, then  
using PayPal might not be the way to go.

There is an instant payment notification system with a PHP sdk.

https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/cps/general/ 
PayPalDeveloperToolKit-outside

and other languages.

I have used it for a variety of sites and it gives you the info you  
need without the liability of running your own.

Hope this helps.

This is a specialized area. I would suggest you get
some expert help.

You can get some background information by going to
websites like http://www.convio.com and asking for
literature.

Relying on a salesman in lieu of a consultant is
not advisable of course -- but you can oftentimes
learn about about known pitfalls from them.

Thanks all. Tim's and inforequest's points about the delicate tax status
are well taken.

All these people want to do is collect membership dues and possibly event
registration fees -- they aren't looking to "make" money in any sense
different from what they are already doing with checks and snail mail. And
I know of a couple other very comparable organizations that are doing
this, guess I oughta talk to them, too.

Perhaps this is too OT --I'll shut up now. Thanks.

Hi,

I'm a relative newbie when it comes to firewalls and serious network
security but I had a thought and wondered how feasible it is. I'm
looking at this XML-RPC book, it seems to say that say if I did not have
a certain application on my server I could add eg. a laptop to my
network which did have that needed application (along w/other required
software perhaps a server) and with xml-rpc calls almost use the laptop
like an added partition of applications.

The catch seems to be security cause all this is passed around w/http
ie. as a web-service. So my question is, what would be a way protecting
the laptop from any unauthorized outside requests eg. the laptop only
talks to the server (or an appointed box) on the local network.

Thanks, 
Lee Gold

Interesting idea. If I understand correctly, you should probably use a
combination of NAT/Firewall (that you likely already have in place) to
block external port 80 requests to your laptop, and a global Apache
Allow directive, to ensure that your laptop only accepts requests from
the server's IP address.

See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_access.html#allow

Making money is not the only means of providing 'benefit' to private 
interests who operate the organization. 

For example, if a database of the membership is created as a 
by-product of a donation system, there should be some auditable 
safegards in place to prevent private parties inside the 
organization from using it for their benefit.

I know there have been talks about online merchant processors, but can anyone
recommend one that will handle pharmaceutical related products?  My client says
he will just be selling home health care products and not prescriptions, but
seems to keep getting his applications denied.

I need one that uses Auth.net, or will sync up to it. (I've only done one other
online store before)

He even had someone deny him on the basis that there is a graphic in the design
I created that has pills in it even though he isn't going to sell pills. (It
was part of the design I used on the pharmacy site, the online store is a
different site but branded similarly.

I'll keep my url's off this email so I'm not thought to be spam.  :)

Someone on the list mentioned Paypal Website Pro earlier. If you don't 
HAVE to use auth.net, Paypal is currently letting anyone apply and there 
is no monthly fee until 2/1/06. The new paypal feature doesn't require 
the end user to have a paypal account or even know that paypal is in the 
background doing the processing. It's pretty much like Verisign payflow 
pro (which, BTW, Ebay acquired recently). They also have a virtual 
terminal so you can enter transactions in by hand. The downside is that 
paypal charges 2.9%+30cents/transaction where as many other auth.net 
merchants accounts charge roughly 2.1%+25c/transaction. Oscommerce and 
miva both support the new paypal pro api. I was thinking of writing a 
generic interface for use with Zencart and other shopping carts over the 
next few days.

Anyone know of any existing PHP/MySQL code with which one can manage

Hi,

We've had a good experience with Authorize.Net's Integrated Payment 
Service, which goes through Wells Fargo. I use it to run credit cards 
manually from time to time, and to integrate with the Client Center 
section of my site, where people can pay their bills. (In the interest 
of full disclosure, I'm also a reseller for them, but I became one 
because their service is good.) If you have any questions about it, I'd 
be happy to answer them.

Hans will probably post a newer version (if one exists...) but
pnsm.pcom is one of the first open source implementations of nested
sets in MySQL+PHP:
http://cvs.nyphp.org/cvsweb.cgi/clew/lib/pnsm.pcom?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup

Unfortunately that earlyish version has no "move" method...

I'm supposed to publish a much more recent implementation that I've
been working with, but I haven't had time to put the site together.
Hmmm, a preview can be found here:

As a followup, you'd probably want the table structure...

CREATE TABLE `fcnyNode` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `parentId` int(10) unsigned default NULL,
  `lt` int(10) unsigned default NULL,
  `rt` int(10) unsigned default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) TYPE=InnoDB

It has to be InnoDB because transactions are necessary to ensure that
the tree doesn't get corrupted during moves.

Chris,

Thanks for the resources, this is tremendously helpful. Thanks for
sharing your hard work Chris and Hans. It seems I owe you both a beer.
;-) I'll kick back any questions, comments, or suggestions I may have.

I wrote an ugly class that I've used for product categories and nested FAQs.
DB structure is: id, parent id, lft, rgt, level, stuff.

Haven't fully exercised it and Chris' point regarding InnoDB and tree moves 
is eye-opening. Here's the jist of it. If you want the guts, yell.

class DoFaq
public function GetFaqs()
public function GetFaq($faqId)
public function Add($question, $answer)
public function Update($faqId, $question, $answer)
public function Delete($faqId)
public function AddSub($parentId, $question, $answer)
public function Promote($faqId)
public function Demote($faqId)
public function MoveUpDown($faqId, $updwn)
public function GetPath($faqId)

private function GetById($faqId)
private function GetByLft($lft)
private function GetByRgt($rgt)
private function GetTree($lft, $rgt)
private function UpdateTree($faq)
private function Move($lft, $rgt, $space, $updwn)
private function AddSpace($lrnum, $space)
}//end class
?>

On a side note, when I'm reading over the code I keep thinking "fancy
node" instead of "fcnyNode."  There's your project name right there.

Heh. "Fancy Node" is when you extend that NSM class so that it works
with a separate table of serialised PHP objects, keyed on the node id.

Chris,

As I've started to mess around with fncyNode a bit, it seems to work
well. I was wondering:

a. I want to add a "name" column and modify the appendTo() function to
save it. Is there a better way? Should I be extending the class?

b. Should I be treating this code as a sample, or is it stable for development?

a) I extend the class. I keep everything other than the id, parentId,
lt and rt in another table, and use a join in order to select records.
This keeps the node table limited to just integers, which should speed
the massive update operations that need to be performed every time you
insert or move a node (since fields are all fixed size). That was
Hans' thinking, anyway (and I'm not a DB Admin).

b) Aside from the addition of numChildren() the interface hasn't
changed since last October. We've been using it all over the place for
a year with no problems. Not high-traffic sites by any means, but
constant daily use with no tree corruption on sets of 3000-5000 nodes.
I've tested it up to 50,000 nodes; inserts can take 3-5 seconds at
that size, but lookups are as fast as ever.

Hmm, what books do you have, and would you recommend them?  I'm
contemplating going for certification myself fairly soon :)

Zend is preparing a certification promotion for NYPHP members.  Details 
will be announced at the November 22nd meeting, so if you've been thinking 
about the ZCE, this may be a good time to start studying  :)

I'll try to bring a few copies of the study guide to give away. I may 
also be able to bring a copy or two of Essential PHP Security - depends 
on how heavy my backpack feels. :-)

I would prefer to not use paypal and offer my client less charge per 
transaction. I already have the software setup, I just need to tell it 
where to point to.  Using paypal would mean restructuring my whole admin.

Any other suggestions?

authorize.net has a nice developer section and PHP development code. You
can get a test account to debug the transaction flow:
https://test.authorize.net/  Many resellers work with them. Rates seem
to be pretty good.

I would prefer to not use paypal and offer my client less charge per
transaction. I already have the software setup, I just need to tell it
where to point to.  Using paypal would mean restructuring my whole
admin. 

Any other suggestions?

Sorry the books are gone however it would be nice to see other pass the
books around through NYPHP as well. I found them to be really beneficial to
the test. I will not post the name of the person who go them so that they
cannot be nagged to send them on.

If they wish to they can post here and pass them on ;) If this works well
and they are passed on maybe i will do it with some of my other PHP books as
well.

Mark,

I am not sure if i bought the PDF version or not but i know you can get it
from php|arch so i am sure if you scour the net you might be able to find
it.

Message-ID: <1131743145.18924.247322264@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi,

Trying the upgrade with:
xampp-upgrade-1.5.0-pl1-installer.exe

When I do I get the error message:

"Can not find Win32 xampp. Installation path not found." 

And I can not upgrade.

Wondered if there's a way to fix this?
Win2k, ApacheFriends XAMPP (basic package) version 1.4.15

Thanks

PS I've tried the apachefiends forums w/no luck so far wondered if
anyone can help.

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.58.0511101635120.75209@emra.pair.com>


Planning to roll my own MySQL/PHP-based mass emailer. Why? Because the
recipient list isn't a semi-static, monolithic thing. The admin user needs
to be able to select subsets of people/addresses from a database based on
various criteria.  (This is your chance to point me to an existing (free)
tool that can do or be adapted to do this -- I haven't found any.)

So here's my (first) question:  What constitutes a well-formed HTML email
body? Is there a "right" way -- other than getting the MIME headers right?
I would assume that your email body should be just like the BODY element
of any valid HTML document -- a regular HTML document minus the HEAD
element.

Hopefully I can make this a well-made and abstract enough beast to merit
sharing once it's done.

Thanks!

    * Attributes. You can specify information you want to get from 
users when they sign up. When sending a message, you can use this 
information to select the users that need to receive the message. For 
example you can add geographical information. When people sign up, 
they can identify the geographical location they're in and when 
sending an email you can determine which locations need to receive 
the message.

Message-ID: <272527290511121050u139f9a62ib9ffb8293fb5fd86@mail.gmail.com>

I've written an article, "How to Search and Find Whatever is Most Important
to You," using Google as an example. It is a ten-step process that many
people have said they find valuable and useful.
 Many of the steps are time-consuming but can be automated (the simplest
automation is to eliminate duplicate words in strings of text). The article
is at www.alexlinsker.com/search.html<http://www.alexlinsker.com/search.html>where
you can see what I have in mind. If you are interested in programming
and designing this (or a part of it) with me, then please contact me.
 There is no pay, so it would need to be inherently interesting for you. I'm
not planning to make any money (and am spending some myself to promote the
site)...I'm expert in search engine optimization, and your work will help
many people. I'm thinking this might be best as an open-source/copyleft
project, but I'm open to your ideas.
 I look forward to hearing from you at alexlinsker at gmail.com
Sincerely,

Alex Linsker

I would imagine so (GPL or similar -- I am not that up on all the
licensing flavors). First I have to worry about getting it done and doing
a decent job (-:

I looked at that, then you motivated me to look again. It should at least
provide inspiration, but I think my recipient attributes might be too
complex -- rather than, e.g., "WHERE state = 'NY'", it will depend on
stuff in related tables. Plus the admins need to be able to send mail to
everyone in this db whether they "subscribe" or not. We'll see -- thank
you.

I think it's great that experts at SEO participate in this list. 
However, I am always intrigued and look for examples of their websites.

Hi David.

You might want to build this in a modular way with respect to the 
mailing lists generated by your queries. In other words, design such 
that IF someday you wanted to offload the actual mailing part, you could 
do so by just delivering the list in "standard" format. You might look 
at some list vendors to see what formats they provide for their lists 
(ascii, comma delimited, etc)

The reasons relate to spam and spam filtering, domain banning, and 
Nazi-like overzealousness. Too much to go into here :-) 

In general I strongly advise clients NOT to send bulk mail from a valued 
domain; it's simply too risky. So... it seems wise to be able to 
outsource the SEND easly when appropriate.

This is usually solved through the most famous process LMAYAFSQ: Let
me ask you a few stupid questions:

- Did you run setup on your new installation?
- If previous failed, have you tried to install the new version on a
new folder and run setup on it?
- Have you tried the second one, had success, exported all the data on
previous mysql version and imported it to the new version? (this is
what I'd do myself and it always works)

This is a great idea. It or something like it could be really popular in 
the non-profit world, where the big commercial solutions (getactive, 
convio, kintera) are vast and powerful but too expensive for all but the 
biggest places, and the lower-end solutions (patronmail) don't do very 
much.

Any plans to build in personalization features with web content, eg 
image links, so you can track who reads the message and/or clicks 
through to a web site? Non-profits love that stuff.

The MIME headers are critical.  IIRC, Thunderbird forms good headers.  Send
yourself a big complicated HTML message, then view the raw source.  The HTML
is standard HTML - but the headers dictate how things should be read, and of
course you should have an alternate part in plain text.

That'd be great - when you get to a sticky spot (like sending large amounts
of email from a web server) let us know how things go.

All,

As many have noticed, the server supporting NYPHP.org, NYCBUG.org,
ATLPHP.org, and other open source resources, has been up and down over the
last couple of days.

The Wall Street building housing the box has been having transformer, then

Work is being done to resolve the problems, and we expect few, if any,

And, as a note for those interested in vinum:  It's sustained numerous hard

I started building one of these bad boys a couple years ago. You are
welcome to have a copy of my code and schema. I never finished the
project, but it does send mail, track bounces, track how many people
opened a message, and sends messages.  It even has a rudimentary SOAP
interface for adding members to the list.

In order for it to send the messages, you have to run a PHP script
indefinitely in the background. I did this because you can't set the
Reply-To from PHP which is crucial for bounce tracking. Unfortunately
I found out later that this could be done with mail() f parameter, but
whatever. This actually uses PEAR:Mail to send all the mail via SMTP.
I'm sure it's slow as hell and completely the incorrect way to do it.
But it worked for me at the time!

I sent out a mailing of 200,000 or something which took many many hours.

Viva la spam! ;-)

Deeply interesting! Wrap it up, I'll take it.

Do you mean Return-path? I have discovered that it's tricky -- different
tricks work in different environments. I still need guru help (or some
more hours of hair-pulling). This has to work on a shared server where you
can't mess with php.ini, sendmail configuration, etc.

> Unfortunately

I am leaning towards PEAR::Mail with the sendmail backend (which can mean
qmail, e.g,. on my shared host). but I haven't ruled out phpmailer

> But it worked for me at the time!

What did Larry Wall teach you about that? (Answer: A program is "correct"
if it runs once before your boss fires you."  Or something to that
effect.)

Running a daemon or some other really long-lived process is not an option.
I am thinking cron: every couple of hours, wake up and send. Do 50 or so
and sleep for a few seconds until you're done. Yeah that would take a long
time for 200,000 emails but this is never gonna need to scale like that.

I have looked at PEAR::Mail:Queue and I don't quite agree with (maybe
don't understand) its storage logic. Why save n copies of the selfsame
email message body in your database? I am actually thinking of saving (for
cron, for later) ONE copy of the message and ONE sql query. At send time,
the cron job will run the SQL against my database of people to fetch a
recipient list. If there's personalization, fine; the message body has
placeholders ("Dear {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME}...") that I str_replace() as I
iterate through the recipient list.

I work in a non-profit project called dailygospel.org and we send out
163.000+ emails everyday of the week with readings from the good book
in 11 languages.

We use purposedly written php scripts that dispatch emails, once they
are parsed and ready, onto a qmail queue.

In order to cope with volume we do exactly that, we have divided the
sendings by timezone and use cron to trigger the events.

What we don't have, and very much would like to have, is a way to
automaticaly monitor if the emails have been received or bounced back,
and remove the bouncers from the send list so, if you should come to a
script that is capable of handling this volume and does what you need
(and what we need too) we are candidates to take a deep look at it and
implement a similar solution at evangelizo.org.

Thanks.

This discussion triggers a question that I'm sure someone here can answer:
wouldn't forking the script to the background allow one to send a huge
volume of email without a timeout?

It would, but forking can be a bit of an art.

For any long running process that you wish to spawn out of PHP running under
Apache (as a DSO anyway) you need to cut ties with Apache.  When a fork() is
done, the file descriptors are copied as well, meaning that now your PHP
script is sharing stdout/stdin/stderr with Apache.  The implication of this
is that your script is now waiting for input/output just like Apache, and
more importantly, Apache is waiting for your script.

So in order to correctly - and completely - fork, you need to fork(), kill
child, fork() again (creating a new process group), and most importantly,
close and reopen file descriptors in the PHP process.  How to do this
correctly varies a little between flavors of Linux/BSD/etc.

Thanks for the link, we do a fair bit of remote network monitoring so 
this technique could lead to a major performance increase just as soon 
as I can get it 100% straight in my head.

I'm not sure exactly how it applies to running a background process 
though.  Right now for background processes I use an intermediary script 
which runs the real task and writes the stdout and stderr output to a 
database row, which can then be polled by the frontend.  It seems to 
work quite well, though the overhead of updating the database is 
something I would like to be rid of if I can find a better way to do it.

My unoriginal thought is to set return-path to something like
bounce-handler at example.org and set a procmail (or equivalent) recipe to
pipe anything sent to bounce-handler to a php script that parses out who
the intended recipient was, deems it a bounce and acts accordingly.  The
gotcha here, according to my rigorously scientific thought experiments, is
that if someone at elsewhere.org deliberately sent mail to
bounce-handler at example.org, the former would be considered a bounce --
unless your bounce-handler worked really hard to figure out if and why the
incoming message bounced. Ah, the joy of reinventing the wheel.

That's a good link (although I'm not sure I would agree that select() is a
form of threading) but it's not really the same as trying to run a process
in the background (daemonize).

The crux of a good fork is the double-fork, in addition to destroying the
relationship between the Apache process and PHP (file descriptors).  For
mod_php, this is quite an infamous problem, which is related to things like:

http://www.securitytracker.com/alerts/2003/Dec/1008559.html

(and search for "Need to fork so apache doesn't kill us" for some C
examples).


And:
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/php-Dev/538021

Which as far as I know, is still an issue in Apache/PHP/etc (not CGI AFAIK).


Anyway, the basic best-practice to fork is something like:


function Daemonize() {

   $pid = pcntl_fork();

   if( $pid < 0 )
      return NULL;

   if( $pid )
      exit(1);

   posix_setsid();

   $pid = pcntl_fork();

   if( $pid < 0 )
      return NULL;

   if( $pid )
      exit(1);

   return posix_getpid();
}
(from http://www.pcomd.net/pfork)


That should completely detach a PHP process from it's Apache process... well
sort of.  Because you're basically now left with an Apache process, and
fork() dupes file descriptors (read a BSD manpage for fork(2)) the child
process (even though it's a session leader and all that) needs to disconnect
from Apache's descriptors (similar to the "controlling terminal" comment in
the C example in the security link).

So what has worked typically is:

fclose(0); fclose(1); fclose(2);

You should be ok in most cases after this.  However, from what I understand,
the Apache forked process inherits *all* file descriptors from Apache, which
is not good (yes, like database connections, etc).  So, in an ideal world -
and especially for very long running processes - you would cycle through all
open file descriptors in the forked PHP process, and close them all.  Then,
of course, reopen the ones you need.

Long story short: if you're running mod_php, don't expect to create a whole
other daemon out of Apache, but it's fine for long running batch processing
from what I've seen.  And, in terms of preventing a user's browser from
"timing out", the important file descriptors to close are the magic three
(stdin/out/err).

It seems like a much better idea to write the outgoing mail to a queue
or flat file, and then use a separate process in pure PHP to do the
sending. In other words, hand it off to a CLI script.

That CLI script could be a daemon that runs all the time, or (more
simply) it could just be a cron job that starts up and handles the
next item in the queue.

By the way (and please excuse the plug) if you'd like another example
of PHP daemon code that implements signal handling like a real Unix
process, check out simpleDaemon.php from the Pro PHP Security code at

Either you can start up a database and start learning how to parse
thousands of type of bounces... or.. you can just set a certain limit
of the ones that come back to the bounce script, and at that limit,
decide to finally bounce the user.

So then, the ideal way to handle a long running process might be to use cron
and execute a CLI script, right? Because that would be totally independent
of the Apache process and is fairly simple (if unelegant) to use.

I'm not sure there is a single ideal way - each has it's own advantages and
disadvantages.  A long running process - of let's say hours - could be
effectively forked from a mod_php script.  But is this a method to create a
true daemon?  Not at all - that should be done via CLI/fork.

So there are a number of strategies for solving this type of problem.

-- have a true daemon process sweep a database or filesystem for jobs to run

-- have a true daemon listen for tasks on an internal or external socket
(fun!)

-- have cron start a process that sweeps a database or filesystem (this can
actually get tricky in terms of concurrency; what if a cron fires up a
script that begins to run, but continues to run longer than the next cron
invocation? ie, you need to concurrency control)

-- fork from Apache; this, actually in many ways, is straightforward once
the fork issues are understood

What works best depends on the programmer's skillset (is he a socket guru?
a fork guru?), and of course problems specific to what needs to get done at
the end of the day.

So I have a PHP install (from a Debian package I think) that was
configured with the --with-pic switch.

Does anyone know what this does? I've also seen --prefer-pic if that helps.

Google and the php.net search are both failing me here.

It is probably related to a switch sent to OpenSSL prior to building 
Apache w/ mod_ssl.  I recall looking into it at one point but do not 
recall what I found out.

Try googling the middle line here (don't forget to quote the hyphen so 
google doesn't try to exclude it, that's bit me a few times :).

cd openssl-0.9.7e
./config -fPIC 
make

The php manual simply says

  --with-pic              try to use only PIC/non-PIC objects default=use both

A performance issue is mentioned here:

Oh, this one is easy...

PIC = position independent code

PIC has to do with the way shared objects are linked together, the Apache
DSO model, etc - if forking from Apache was a touch subject, then PIC is...

Perhaps some of the C gurus who hide on this list can fill in more details.
It's very platform dependant, quite complex, and quite subtle.  Supposedly
non-PIC is faster (since the linker can "know" where to link shared objects
together, and some platforms are (or, at least used to be) buggy with
regards to PIC code.

For some general reading:

http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/autobook/autobook_71.html
http://docs.hp.com/en/B2355-90655/ch07s03.html
http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/gcc/gccint_143.html
http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components/docs/users_guide/node196.html
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1059

So what does this mean for PHP?

http://apache.dev.wapme.net/modules/php-4.0.5/INSTALL
http://www.php-editors.com/apache_manual/dso.html
http://www.phpbuilder.com/manual/zend.creating.php

(search for PIC in the above)

And there's been some recent discussion:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-dev&w=2&r=1&s=pic&q=b

There's actually a lot of resources - Yahoo/Google for "position independent
code php", versus using the acronym.

(PIC == Position Independent Code)

The performance gurus tell us to compile PHP with -prefer-non-pic (for 
DSOs to match the performance of a static library):

Hello,

So I completely understand how to add nodes, removes nodes, move
nodes, select children and parents. But I'm having a hard time
figuring out how to draw trees in select boxes and using packages like
PEAR::HTML_TreeMenu to build trees without using recursion. I'm going
brain-dead on this one. The fcnyNode class has been extremely helpful
along with the articles I'm reading which I posted before.

What's my big hangup? ;-)

(Dusting off and putting on my old C coding hat)

Presumably, the overhead of having to re-calculate memory addresses when 
loading a library into memory makes PIC objects larger (since there is 
relocation code) and slightly slower (because of the calculation). A 
static library would have fixed addresses, so a static library would be 
slightly smaller and faster to load. However, their is a price to pay - 
you dont get any of the benefits that a shared library brings to the 
table (which means each application would load and use its own copy of a 
static library and so you would use much more memory overall).

I would argue that using static libraries only gives you benefits when 
initially loading a library into memory but that the increased memory 
usage would probably outweigh these benefits pretty quickly (picture a 
web server where each PHP application has its own libraries loaded into 
memory instead of sharing one instance across all instantiations and you 
will get the picture). Also, with today's faster CPUs and memory, the 
intial load time is getting smaller all the time...

I hear you. A bounce threshold is in fact part of my grand plan -- again,

You can loop through all the nodes in a set (you'll need to sooner or
later, if only to display them) and use the parentId to keep track of
relative depth.

Or you can tie the tree to a conventional hierarchical naming system,
and count the nameparts of any node to determine its depth.

The first method looks something like the following, where $nodes is
an array of nodes.

$previous = FALSE;
foreach( $nodes AS $index=>$child ) {
  if ( !$previous ) {
    $depth = array( $child->parentId );
  }
  else {
    if ( $child->parentId == $previous->id ) {
      // child of previous
      $depth[] = $child->id;
    }
    else {
      $popped = array_pop( $depth );
      while ( $popped && $popped != $child->parentId ) {
        // close containers
        $popped = array_pop( $depth );
      }
      $depth[] = $child->parentId;
      if ( $child->parentId != $this->id ) {
        $depth[] = $child->id;
      }
    }
  }
  $nodes[$index]->depth = count( $depth );
  $previous = $child;
}

Following that, each node in the $nodes array will have a depth property.

I calculate the depth when adding/updating/deleting nodes and store the
depth in the database. If the set is read intensive, this reduces the
processing load. For a simple indent, I use this:

<div style="margin-left: {$category_list->category[i].level-1}em">

relative depth.

Or you can tie the tree to a conventional hierarchical naming system,
and count the nameparts of any node to determine its depth.

The first method looks something like the following, where $nodes is an
array of nodes.

$previous = FALSE;
foreach( $nodes AS $index=>$child ) {
  if ( !$previous ) {
    $depth = array( $child->parentId );
  }
  else {
    if ( $child->parentId == $previous->id ) {
      // child of previous
      $depth[] = $child->id;
    }
    else {
      $popped = array_pop( $depth );
      while ( $popped && $popped != $child->parentId ) {
        // close containers
        $popped = array_pop( $depth );
      }
      $depth[] = $child->parentId;
      if ( $child->parentId != $this->id ) {
        $depth[] = $child->id;
      }
    }
  }
  $nodes[$index]->depth = count( $depth );
  $previous = $child;
}

Following that, each node in the $nodes array will have a depth
property.

There are the pdftotext and pdftohtml tools that might do the trick for
you. If you have xpdf installed, you may already have them.

Have a look at the first (short) chapter of Adam Trachtenberg's "Upgrading 
to PHP 5." 
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/upgradephp5/

Adam also provided an article that covers the same bases as chapter 1.
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2004/07/15/UpgradePHP5.html

Basically it boils down to improved OOP, MySQL, and XML support.

That attached has been going around on the PHP-DEV list.  Not specific to 4
-> 5, but covers some interesting points.

The number one advantage of moving to PHP 5 from 4 is the object model, that
is to say, more complete and objects are handled by resource/reference,
rather than being copied on a continual basis.

Hello, all -
This is probably a simple thing, but here goes:
I have a JavaScript file in an includes directory that I want to keep
private - i.e. I don't want anyone to be able to pull it up in their
web browser so that they can see the contents of it.  On the other
hand, I need a certain php script to be able to have access to it.
All of this is in a shared hosting environment.
I've tried to use .htaccess by limiting access to only "localhost",
the ip of the server, and the domain name, but everything I try ends
up denying permission to the php script trying to access the file.
Thanks,

Maybe I'm confused, but what good is JavaScript if the client can't get it?

I'm using php to dynamically create javascript based on user requests
or behavior.  The information in the javascript file is sensitive.

A few things:

Completely protecting javascript is impossible, AFAIK.

There are javascript "encoders" that obfuscate it. Google around.

You might serve the javascript out of a PHP script that checks to see if
the referrer is your desired script. Or use mod_rewrite to check the
referrer. These are standard "hot link protection" methods, often used
to prevent reuse of images, javascript or other assets. This however far
from foolproof.  The referrer can be faked, the script read from browser
cache, etc.

If you are concerned about someone reading the source code, using it for
their own purposes or finding out some super secret proprietary business
info then it shouldn't be done client side.  Do it server side.

HTH,
Andrew

I think this is an issue of definition ;-)

There is "the Client" (e.g. the one who pays the mortgage) and then there's
the client (e.g. Firefox, IE, etc.).  When it comes to Billy's script,
sounds as though he'd like the former persona non grata.

But then again, Latin was never my forte....

That's a very good point.  I've been asked to implement a  "suggest"
feature (ala Google) while avoiding increased client/server traffic. 
I could use XMLHttpRequest to fetch only that data that I need from
the server.  The problem with that, again, is the added server load it
would cause.  But you're right, in this case it's probably best to do
the searching on the server side, and that's what I'll have to
"suggest" to the boss.

I hope this isn't a dumb question, but here it is....Is the only way to get
rid of the deprecated errors in PEAR such as is_a and static calls etc to
actually modify the PEAR code? Turning down the error reporting in my logs
doesn't seem like a good solution and I heard that modifying PEAR will make
it difficult to get updates using the package manager. How have the rest of
you dealt with this?

Thanks

There's no way that you or anybody else can implement the "google 
suggest" feature without increasing the server traffic. It's plain 
impossible - think about it! The "suggest" feature provides the user 
more data while he's using the application and transferring more 
data *will* increase the server traffic.

I hope your previous plan (doing it in the client end) wasn't too 
close to "the Javascript Search Engine" featured in The Daily WTF a 
few days ago: http://thedailywtf.com/forums/50523/ShowPost.aspx

If you cannot deal with the increased server load caused by 
"suggest" feature implemented with XMLHttpRequest, then you probably 
shouldn't implement the "suggest" feature at all. If you're trying 
to implement this with JavaScript, the JavaScript file will end up 
being quite a huge file and that will cause increased server load, too.

Remove E_STRICT from your error reporting settings.  This can be done via 
E_ALL.  But if you're using a custom error handler function, you'll have 
to use the error_types parameter for set_error_handler().

You are carrying my boss's mandate to the illogical extreme.  I was
not asked to reduce or eliminate any server traffic with this feature
- I was asked to keep it to a minimum.

Different strokes for different folks, I guess. No need to fear
JavaScript or client-side anything. Just make sure it works, doesn't
get in the way, doesn't break something if JavaScript isn't enabled,
and doesn't present an unmanageable risk.

No, the JavaScript file won't be that big.  Also, I don't throw my
arms up and cry "uncle" every time I come across a roadblock or two,
so I definitely won't be telling my boss that it can't be done.

I'd rather not turn down my error reporting level, that was the point of the
question :)
I think I prefer modifying the PEAR base class to that solution.

Does anyone know of an opensource solution for a firewall that supports 
multiple classes, and is a briding firewall??  And because of the higher 
up authority we need a web interface to it.  Right now we are using a 
sonic wall and because of recent events we now need something that 
supports multiple classes, this sonicwall does not.

Donald,
It sure allows for bridging, I've done it.

I'm not so sure what you mean with "multiple classes" in a Firewalling
environment.
Can you specify a little?

Modifying the PEAR base class probably won't help that much. Not all 
PEAR classes extend PEAR. You would probably have to modify many 
classes. When you modify a package your changes will be lost next time 
you update.

The only solution I can think of that doesn't require messing with error 
reporting settings is to create a custom error handler. In it you could 
check the error type and then decide whether or not to log the error.

well right now the sonicwall that we use gets a /29 mounted to its DMZ 
we are getting another /29 and want to be able to mount that to the DMZ 
as well.

if pfense supported multiple classes it would work, but according to the 
screenshorts it looks like it only supports the use of 1 class.

Oh!

Do you mean to have different zones with different netmasks, is that it?

Like external a class C address, dmz a class B and internal a class A address?

If that's it, look no further, and download SmoothWall.

Well kind of, basically i want the DMZ to be able to have two class C 
netmasks.

Eg. Mounting to full class C's to the DMZ

Subject: [nycphp-talk] DataObjects generator
Message-ID: <9ebd5b3c0511181525k7f064179n505e59430240af56@mail.gmail.com>

I've developed a tool that creates a DataObject for each table I have in my
MySQL database. When the script is executed against a particular table it
generates a script containing OO code with a number of methods defined by
default e.g. set_/get_ , getAll, get, insert, delete, update, and a error
method.

It has also been fun finding ways to use the DataObjects. As a result, I
have put together a couple of examples;
Using a single DataObject : http://cthorn.com/oodbigen/usingdataobject.php
MVC wrapper for the DataObjects : http://cthorn.com/oodbigen/mvcwrapper.php

Hope someone finds this useful. Feedback welcomed..

Have you considered simply dumping out associative arrays that describe
each table, and then having  single library of code that handles them? 
This gives you the flexibility to see the code's efficacy in real-time as
you work on it -- without having to run the generator for every little
tweak -- and then having it save cached chunks of HTML as it goes.

After tweaking the generator, a simple refresh of my browser allows me to
see the output of the script generated and the output from executing each
method in the DataObject. Since this refresh has the database and table info
already and the assoc array - $_POST is still available.

Hello Everyone,

I've recently began experimenting with designing UI's for my web apps in
OpenLaszlo and doing my backend scripting with PHP. So far, I am pretty
impressed with how much work using these two technologies together has saved
me but I'm wondering what everyone else thinks.

Anyone here using Laszlo in conjunction with PHP? What are your thoughts on
it? How has it worked for you?

Thanks!

I think I phrased my question badly.

What I should have said was that as the complexity of your generator
increases, and as the table count increases, running the generator becomes
more and more of a delay.  If the generator produced an assoc array of
layout, you would only need to run it when layout changed, and your system
would be much more flexible both in terms of development and deployment.

I have a system of 170 tables and re-running the generator is just not an
option when I'm trying to tweak a bug, I want to modify the code directly
and see the effect.  When it is fixed, it goes into the distribution tree
and all systems using that library file are affected w/o rerunning any
generators.

I am not really clear on what this has to do with PHP?  Can someone fill 
me in?

You should check Qcodo, I've tried it and now I use it regularly, I
already have two apps, one will be online soon, and it works like a
charm. PHP5 based with "strict" oop approach, and does a good job with
code generation.

My focus with the generator was to create a base DataObject. When using the
DataObject in a project, if I decide to add methods that perform tasks
outside of the core basics I would just extends the base DataObject for that
table in another file. Tweaking/debugging of that other file doesn't affect
the base. Now, If these methods are agreed to be common enough to apply to
each table, you could hack another generator that by default extends the
base DataObject for those specific methods common to each table.

Running the generator against 170 tables shouldn't take very long and since
you extends the base DataObject to add additional functionality when using
it in a project. The impact should be little to nothing.

In theory, after generating the base DataObjects script files, you should
"never" have to edit those files again. The goal is to have a "standard"
DataObject for every table. So, having to re-run the generator after fixing
a bug in the base DataObject is required.
Also, If I modify the database table(s) adding/removing fields I would
re-run the generator on that table(s) only just to ensure I maintain the
standard base DataObject for my project.

Good idea.  And check the file name too.  If it's in a PEAR file, just 
ignore the E_STRICT warning.  But if it's elsewhere, kvetch.

Smoothwall is really excellent. There's a less powerful (but still good) 
free version and a fully capable, supported paid version. Or you could 
just use iptables, which can do anything but is a little hard to get 
used to.

Confession: I don't know what "briding" means in this context.

Most php programmers tend to have a diverse knowledge background
that is why we ask other quick questions non related to PHP.

I think thsi type of questions should be prefaced by the letters "OT" Other
Topic.
ex:OT - Open source Firewall

My 2 cents
Nestor :-)

Even PHP app servers need to wear protection.

Have you taken a look at PEAR:DataObject? I use it regularly, and it
sounds very similar to what you are trying to accomplish.

I'm looking for a host with PHP5 and MYSQL5 and PHPMYADMIN in the lowest
price plan they would have.
I don't need voice support just good email support is OK. But they have
to have these up to date version...
Any recommendations appreciated. Note: This is only for personal playing
not any mission critical enterprise.
The versions have to current as i cited above...

Thanks,
Lee G.

Dreamhost offers PHP 5.
Looks like MySQL is 4.1.11 on one of my sites, but I guess it's 
possible it's upgraded on others.
PhpMyAdmin is automatically installed for you when you create a db.
Each account comes with unlimited mysql db's.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Preferred method for parsing multi-row submit buttons
Message-ID: <009b01c5eeb8$ca9eb900$0ea8a8c0@cliff>

Ok, this is probably a trivial newbie questions, but here goes:

For a form that has multiple rows containing identical buttons for each
row, i.e. Edit row, Delete row, etc. what is your preferred scheme?

<input type="submit" name="submit_edit_$row_id" value="Edit"/>
<input type="submit" name="submit_delete_$row_id" value="Del"/>

I have also seen this:
<input type="submit" name="submit[$row_id]" value="Edit"/>
<input type="submit" name="submit[$row_id]" value="Del"/>

I have been using the first method, but #2 seems slightly easier to
parse. Pundits say #2 identifies the scripting language as PHP, but how
much is security by obscurity worth anyway.

Comments?

Funny you should ask.  I just gave a presentation about this at the 
International PHP Conference.  Unfortunately, my laptop died while I was 
there so I don't have slides yet.  But the short story is use SSL 
certificates and/or PGP/GPG keys to authenticate and encrypt the data.

Despite ServerPronto being largely in Ft. Lauderdale, there was not a

Hello All,

I wanted to get your feedback on the best (and

implemented a simple one that basically appends
directories onto the end of the php file, for example:

http://www.example.com/script.php/variable1/variable2/

To get the variables I am splitting on / in the
$_SERVER['PATH_INFO']. This appears to work quite well
for me. However the only problem I am facing now is
when my page has included header information such as
CSS or javascript. Since the includes are not full URL
they try to find the files in:

http://www.example.com/script.php/variable1/variable2/

instead of in:

http://www.example.com/

Now I know I can do this via mod_rewrite but I would
rather keep it all in the php. So one way I found
around this was to put:

        $path = preg_split("/\//",
$_SERVER['PATH_INFO']);
        $file = array_pop($path);
        if (preg_match("/\.(js)$/", $file)) {
            include($file);
            exit;
        }
        if (preg_match("/\.(jpg|gif|png|css)$/",
$file)) {
            $extra_path = array_pop($path);
            include($extra_path . "/" .$file);
            exit;
        }

Basically this just checks if the last block on the
url is a file. If it is and is javascript simple
include the file directly (from the current working
dir). If it is a image or css file get the extra
directory information then include the file. 

Now again this works for my current app, however I
very much fear doing a dynamic include. Can anyone
think of a better way to handle this?

Thanks,

Stefan

I think you get less support for free. But all I've ever needed was a
reset, and that didnt cost anything.

Yes, I thought of that and a form per row sure would be the easiest way
to go. But I want to have the flexibility to add checkboxes to each row,
if required, which would facilitate global, "do action to all checked"
buttons.

I just do something like this:

foreach($_POST as $key => $value) {
	if (substr($key,0,6) == "submit") {
		$temp = explode("_", $key);
		$action = $temp[1];
		$row = $temp[2];
		break;
	}
}

It works -- just wondering if there's a better way.

You probably already thought of this, but another alternative is to
have a couple of radio buttons with self-explanatory icons next to
them (edit and delete) and only one submit button.

Seems like this would be better as hyperlinks rather than forms.

Basically I wanted a solution that could work right
out of the box after installing the script, without
having to worry about whether mod_rewrite was
installed, if they could access it via a .htaccess
etc.

I thought of that, and again, it sure would be much easier. But doesn't
that violate the W3C recommendation for get versus post. Isn't a
Hyperlink simulating a get submission, which should not be used for
"actions" that modify a database.

Yep, in theory GET requests should be side-effect free, so the instinct is 
not to use links... If only for one lesson learned the hard way... What if 
a spider or recursive wget hits this page (and all you have to stop the 
requests for the normal user are JavaScript confirms)?

I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to do, so this may not apply
to you.  I'll throw it out there anyway:  If you have many things on
one page that a user could edit or delete, it may be easier for the
user if you provide them with a way of doing them all at once.  In
other words, use a toggle next to each item (a select widget, radio
button, whatever) and have a "Edit Selected" or "Delete Selected'
button at the top and bottom of the list.  PHPMyAdmin does this too,
and I agree, it is a great peice of software.  Just a thought!

Actually, I already do this, and use a similar UI to PHPAdmin --
checkboxes for global button actions and individual buttons for single
row actions. Hard to beat it's UI, other than a lot of clutter.

The difference is PHPAdmin uses Hyperlinks and I'm leaning towards
submit buttons. But than again, I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.
Ok...rigid...

Although, if the Action requires an authenticated user, I'm still not
sure I understand where the risk is.

Cliff,

You are right that the spider/wget risk is somewhat mitigated if you have 
a protected page, but that still leaves open the URL being saved in the 
browser history, or even bookmarked.

Actually, now that I think about it again... if you had a link to a delete 
page with an id, and you'd clicked it already (putting it in the browser 
history) a second click to the same delete page with that id wouldn't (in 
theory) have an effect. 

In any case, going from POST to GET opens up a lot of these minor things 
to think about :)

In this case, the Pundits you are listening to are dead wrong, Using
brackets to name form elements does not identify the language as php,
as the same structure could be used by PHP, ASP, mod_perl, cgi or even
just javascript in an html file.

That's what I figured. I'll stick with POST. Than I only have to worry
about impatient  users with overly active button pushing tendencies.

And what if it the link was an update, not a delete -- like a status
change. An old bookmarked link might change a status that has been
updated subsequently to a different status. It means more state
information needs to be saved to prevent these issues.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] enforcing Latin-1 input
Message-ID: <43824C49.6080302@polymerdb.org>

Hi Folks,

I have an app that should be storing input only in Latin-1 characters, 
but which will probably be used by English-speaking individuals in Asia, 
Middle East, and other locales. I expect that some of those people will 
sometimes type input in their own local character set, but I really do 
not want to store information that I won't even be able to read later.

I've been reading around and have gotten more of an understanding of 
this issue lately, but still don't understand enough to filter user 
input to be sure it's in the Latin-1 character set. I tried using 
"accept-charset" attribute in <form> tag, and I also thought that at 
least MySQL would mangle input that's not Latin-1 on this database 
having a charset value of "Latin-1", but darnit, mysql is too good for 
me and stores and retrieves Korean and Japanese text without a hitch.

Naturally mangled input is not what I want, so I guess it's okay that 
mysql didn't destroy the data. :o) What I really want is that if 
$_POST['usertext'] == ???????????? [wow, how does that look 
in your mail reader?] then the app will know it and tell the user 
"please enter only characters in the Latin-1 set".

As usual, I'm sure I'm just not getting something basic here. Is this 
even possible?

Often what I do here is have the script write a variable with a unique 
key into the form/URL, and on submission, store the key and/or see if 
it's been used before.  If it's been used before, the "update" action 
gets skipped, and just the page is displayed.  For pages that depend on 
the output of the update query then you don't get exactly the same page, 
but you can code around that.  But this way I don't have to worry about 
even something like a page reload doing weird things to my data.

That's my interpretation. Section 9.1.1 of RFC 2616:

"In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and 
HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other 
than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows 
user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in 
a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a 
possibly unsafe action is being requested."

Does anyone know of a simple how-to LAMP installation guide for SUSE... I
have access to the LAMP book "Making them play well together..." or
something to that effect. But a co-worker is setting up two servers, and I
really don't think she'll have time to wade through it. Last I knew, I
thought SUSE came bundled with MySQL and PHP 4?

But this certainly shouldn't be considered a real practice.  For example, a
GET comes in and I update a session - via a database let's say.  While RFCs
are good academically, that's how security holes are born.  Let's not
examine the SHOULD or SHOULD NOTs in the TCP or IP RFCs :)

While the RFC's are all well and good, the real reason for not deleting 
items from your database via a simple hyperlink click is that sooner or 
later, one of your users is going to install a Firefox extension that 
promises to speed up web-browsing by pre-caching everything.  They're 
going to visit your page with that extension installed, and the Firefox 
extension is going to delete their whole database by auto-loading all the 
page links.  And who are they going to blame?  You.  Yes.  You can see it, 
can't you?  The client calling in apoplectic rage?  The sinking feeling in 
your stomach?

That's why you "make things happen" with POST instead of GET wherever 
possible...

The problem is that you cannot accurately identify different 8 bit 
encodings from each other. Latin-1 (iso-8859-1) and Latin-9 
(iso-8859-15) text may contain identical byte sequences and still 
different content so you have no way to know which one user intended 
to use.

Some 8 bit encodings have different *probabilities* for different 
byte sequences and you could make an educated guess which encoding 
the user agent really used. That would still be just a guess.

The way I do it is that I send the html with UTF-8 encoding (I also 
have <form accept-charset="UTF-8" ...> in case some user agent 
supports that, most user agents just use the same encoding the page 
with the form used) and I check that the user input is valid UTF-8 
byte sequence. If the user input isn't a valid UTF-8 sequence then I 
just take it as a fact that the real encoding is iso-8859-1 and I 
blindly convert from iso-8859-1 to UTF-8 -- I've yet to see an user 
agent which does support different encodings AND doesn't support 
UTF-8 AND defaults to any other charset but iso-8859-1.

So far, this has worked perfectly. Or should I say, almost 
correctly... I'm pretty sure that some windows user agents send 
incorrect unicode characters that are technically correctly encoded 
as UTF-8. I believe that those invalid characters are meant to 
represent code points from windows-1252 character set and user agent 
doesn't correctly translate from windows-1252 to UTF-8. Expect to 
see such input if user, for example, copies text containing "smart 
quotes" from MS Word to text area.

Those japanese characters work just fine because your mail used 
UTF-8 encoding.

If you're using a 'personal' hypertext preprocessor with
'my' sql on a private intranet, you can do it the
'My'crock-software way.
cf: Does Microsoft Care About Web Standards?
http://www.alttags.org/archives/2004/04/29/33/

It does seem, that Microsoft, early on at least, took a
rather cavalier attitude of "rules. what rules? we can
make our own rules..." when creating their Internet
products.

The result is a BWOT (big waste of time) when getting
entangled in things like cross-browser support.

Exactly.

And I'm sure it's already been pointed out that some loser could post
an image on a website somewhere whose src attribute is a URL that
includes the GET vars needed to modify data in your app. There's a
million scenarios (some more likely than others, of course) in which
allowing *important* changes to data based on GET is a really bad
idea.

Not that you can't trick someone into inadvertantly POSTing data (as
with a search form) but at least the user has to take some action for
this to happen.

Standards are important, and vital to the internet. But RFCs aren't perfect,
and knowing when the real-world comes into play, is just as vital.

Sure -

A search for rfc exploit brings up a lot, but here's actually an RFC that
explains just such a thing.  There are a number of exploits listed, but
section 3, Tiny Fragment Attack is:

---
   STD 5, RFC 791 states:

      Every internet module must be able to forward a datagram of 68
      octets without further fragmentation.  This is because an internet
      header may be up to 60 octets, and the minimum fragment is 8
      octets.

   Note that, for the purpose of security, it is not sufficient to
   merely guarantee that a fragment contains at least 8 octets of data
   beyond the IP header because important transport header information
   (e.g., the CODE field of the TCP header) might be beyond the 8th data
   octet.
---

Here RFC 791, which in fact has been elevated to standard status, is cited
as not sufficiently describing behavior for the purpose of security.

And, perhaps one of the most famous, which proved exploitable by a
combination of implementation issues and assumptions about what people would
do with a protocol.

http://damaged.crontab.org/pub-dir/texts/s/sequence_attacks.txt

So not to get philosophical, but adhereing to a standard without considering
undocumented "what if" scenarios, is exactly what hacking and security is
all about.  People will bend the standards, and to keep yourself protected,
you need to bend them beforehand.

How about encoding all form widgets with
form_row info, including an action widget/s for each
row.  (a select with an "Ignore" or "Skip" option selected
by default works for me).

You can encode the widget names to allow
grouping by table_row_action, pretty much anything.

Explode each widget key and set up a multidimensional
associative array.

One submit button will process the whole form.

If it's a dynamic form, create a unique name for it and create
a plain text tmp file using the form name.

Write copies of your auto-generated form widget names
to the tmp file.

As someone else said, if the tmp file doesn't exist when
the form is submitted, then the form has already been processed.

When you process the form, compare the widget names
from the form to the widget names in the tmp file.

If they don't match exactly, it's a form error.

Of course all the usual validation needs to be done as well...

After the form is processed, delete the tmp file.

I'm very curious how you test this.

Also, I'm continuing to read more on all of this (and cripes, there's a 
lot to read...), but just so I don't lose momentum here, I want to ask 
what you think of this half-baked idea:

A form on a document with iso-8859-1 encoding will apparently (according 
to a few quick tests) encode its user input into Latin-1 also.  If I put 
something else in there, say that Japanese string I gave you, it gets 
encoded into 
"&#22823;&#38442;&#24066;&#28010;&#36895;&#21306;&#12398;&#12510;
&#12531;&#12471;&#12519;&#12531;"

So, if I can find user input matching a regex pattern like '&#\d+;', I 
know the user is either intentionally typing HTML numeric entities into 
my form, or trying to enter some non-Latin-1 characters.  Of course, 
what to do with that information is an app-level question, but the 
question here is: is this really a valid test, or will I be getting 
false positives and false negatives?

Any thoughts?

This is always an interesting problem; the filesystem/URL relationship.  So
far, there are a few of ways to handle this, most of which you've mentioned:

-- mod_rewrite
-- "fusebox" everything through index.php and *carefully* parse PATH_INFO
-- catch 404 errors and handle accordingly (either through include/require
or redirect)
-- create ghost directories with a single index.php that knows what to do
for that request

Non of which are very elegant IMO.

The main problem is that PHP can't reach far enough up into Apache's request
stages to truly deal with non-existent filesystem paths.  AFAIK, both Python
and Perl can.  There's another option, apache_hooks, that does allow the
same level of Apache/PHP interaction as lets say Apache/mod_perl.  However,
development seems to have stalled, and it's still in a very experimental
stage from what I hear.  One day, perhaps, we can get it back into action
again :)

It seems that Google is getting all the glory for high-tech and innovative
sites, including strong AJAX technology.

But I just came across http://farechase.yahoo.com/, which truly makes some
of these technologies useful.  The use of AJAX and rich client-side browser
based applications takes the site to the next level for travel searching.

+1 Yahoo! in my opinion for delivering something useful, and steering clear
of fluffy map and email launches.

At first glance, this looks like a clone of kayak.com.

What I find really interesting about kayak.com is that it has .jsp in 
the URL and doesn't suck. That's a big testament to the usefulness of 
Ajax - if your server-side technologies suck, do more on the client. :-)

(All direspect shown toward Java is just for fun.)

Ironicly Chris, .jsp in the URL really means nothing. lol. Especially on a
PHP forum where most people are Apache-Directive-Dorks, and know that any
extension can and does exist. Infact, I recall compiling Apache to run with
a .asp extension as PHP code, just for the insult.  =D

We took advantage of this when we launched, albeit for a day only, New York

http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2003-April/002941.html

Unfortunately, the site itself still doesn't live anywhere (I don't think)
so it's only a happy April memory now :)

Okay, all Enterprise Java Web apps come out of the closet, we know

Message-ID: <8d9a42800511221719h709e0a53gd0ddebdac7c4f2f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

let me explain a bit what i am trying to do.  I have a script that
will grab the first page which i specify from a URL such as

http://yellowpages.superpages.com/listings.jsp?PS=45&OO=1&R=N&PP=L&CB=1&STYPE=S&F=1&L=VT&CID=00000518939&paging=1&PI=0

now when it grabs this page, it will scour the returned HTML and grab
all the information for each record under Yellow Page Listings.
once it has all records it then checks to see if there is a Next page,
basically Next will either be a link or not.

If it is a link the script will execute using the URL from the Next
Link.  Here's where i am running into problems.  I want to feed it 1
url and have it go through every page until there is not a next page.

The issue i am having is that with the url grabbed from the link, curl
fetches the page, but it's not the page expected rather it's an error
page from superpages stating that i have not supplied enough search
criteria.

On the first page grabbed, this is the link that is grabbed from the source
http://yellowpages.superpages.com/listings.jsp?PS=45&PP=L&CB=1&L=VT&CID=00000518939&paging=1&F=1&OO=1&PI=45

Now when curl grabs that url it complains about search criteria
however if you paste that to a browser it will work just fine.

here is a screenshot of the page that is returned by cURL
http://codebowl.dontexist.net/images/ypresult.jpg

I am not sure what is going on with this but if anyone here can lend a
hand with curl i would appreciate it.  I have
the cookie directory writable by apache also as i read you had to
specify the exact path to the cookie on windows using apache 2

Here is my code

http://codebowl.dontexist.net/codebowl/System/Misc/Curl.phps
http://codebowl.dontexist.net/codebowl/System/Misc/YellowPages.phps


Note that i created a curl class because i am thinking of expanding on
what i have and the framework i am working on
is going to be 100% Object Oriented.

Any help is appreciated.

I see you have

commented out, I think these are key for this to work for you

use these to allow cookies that get sent from yellowpages to be written and
subsequently read on the next request
//$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, "e:\htdocs\tmp\cookies\superpages.cookie.txt");
//$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, "e:\htdocs\tmp\cookies\superpages.cookie.txt");
Do you see this file superpages.cookie.txt created and a value set?

only use these if you wish to define the cookies yourself
$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_COOKIE, 1); and
curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_COOKIE, $cookieFields);

this is a snippet from what I use for passing around cookies

                curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, STATIC_ROOT ."/cookies/"
. $this->_domainObj->getDomainId() . ".txt");

        if(file_exists(STATIC_ROOT ."/cookies/" .
$this->_domainObj->getDomainId() . ".txt")) {
            if(filesize(STATIC_ROOT ."/cookies/" .
$this->_domainObj->getDomainId() . ".txt") < 8000) {
                curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, STATIC_ROOT ."/cookies/"
. $this->_domainObj->getDomainId() . ".txt");
            }
        }

Joe,

I noticed that your link to the nest page and the link I  get are a
bit different.
My next link:
http://yellowpages.superpages.com/listings.jsp?PS=45&OO=1&R=N&PP=L&CB=1&STYPE=S&F=1&L=VT&CID=00000518939&paging=1&PI=45
You next link:
http://yellowpages.superpages.com/listings.jsp?PS=45&PP=L&CB=1&L=VT&CID=00000518939&paging=1&F=1&OO=1&PI=45

Why is that?

Nestor :-)

I have tried with the lines uncommented as well and get the same results.

Nestor,

as for the different links i will have to look into that in the
morning however i am grabbing the same link you click on when going

A great tool for debugging bots and spiders is the "Tamper Data 0.85" 
extension of Firefox browser. Go download the browser, then install the 
extension, which can be found here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/showlist.php?application=firefox&category=Developer%20Tools&numpg=10&pageid=7
It logs and displays all inbound and outbound traffic to the browser. 
This is very useful, especially when creating bots that interface with 
SSL pages. I used to use a packet sniffer to debug, but having to tackle 
an SSL only application prompted me to seek out and discover this 
wonderful app.

An alternative way to spider a website is to grab the pages with "wget" 
then parse and process it all offline later. One caveat: some dynamic 
scripts may generate links on the fly resulting in loops. Googlebot, for 
example, has been endlessely spidering my same photo album pages for the 
past year and a half.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] A translation programming language translation standard
Message-ID: <20051123033610.39033.qmail@web80730.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm starting a new sourceforge project based on
creating a standard language for the use of
translating and interpreting languages from one to
another. The resulting project will be an engine
called SILC.

I'm going to be licensing the source code for this
engine as closed source at least for awhile as I have
plans to make much money on some of this tool's
possible applications. For those of you who don't know
what this program is, the name is pretty
self-explanatory, but it's an engine that, given
tranlation libraries, has the possibility of
translating any programming language to any other
programming language, or even to english, or
russian... or whatever language translation the
library developer can imagine. The library files are
written in SILC code which is my own language for
translating languages.

The engine takes in a piece of code or a file written
in the input language, and outputs a file written in
the output language. I will soon put up a site on how
the SILC language works on sourceforge. Here's some
actual translations from the current pre-alpha
version:

The user inputs PHP code:
if ($harman == true || $booty != false &&
substr($txt,0,1) == "a") print("Hello World");

Outputs code in QBASIC language:
IF harman$ = true OR booty$ <> false AND
MID$(txt$,1,1) = "a" THEN PRINT "Hello World"

Outputs code in English language:
if the variable harman is equal to true or the
variable booty is not equal to false and a sample the
length of 1 characters of the variable txt starting at
character 1 is equal to "a" then print the text "Hello
World"

The output code above is actual program output. The
difference between translating an input language to QB
and translating it to english is simply altering the
rewrite rules and some of the flag options to format
the output correctly. The code above was translated
using three rewrite rules! I created one rule for If,
one for substr, and one for print.

I'm in the pre-alpha phases of the project as I just
recreated it last weekend from scratch in PHP after a
four year downtime for this project. So far, I've made
much progress because I attacked the coding of the
translation engine from a completley different angle
and it's working now, whereas before I got stopped at
the important part. I've created the line by line
translation function first and I have yet to create
the part of the engine that will read a translation
libary and an input file performing translation
functions on a whole program scale. So far, I've
envisioned how I need to do it and it won't take much
work for a version 1 to be released.

Creating the engine is the easy part but creating all
of the translation libraries is quite a formidable
task. Although I have made the silc code syntax very
easy to use, it will still take some basic knowledge
of two languages and how they behave to create a
translation library file. More about that and the
syntax of a SILC Library File (SLF) later on the
sourceforge project site. I'll be posting the project
homepage url when I get it. The translation libraries
will be open-source and those are mainly what the
sourceforge project will be about creating.

The uses for this program are boundless, but this
project will mainly be focusing on the use of it for
free and paid translation of source code to a wide
range of clientelle.  The project website will include
a user interface in which users will be able to paste
source code written in it's native language in a text
field and translate it to another language by
selecting the language and clicking the "Translate"
button for free or they can translate larger files on
a paid account.  

Another use we will be exploring is the translation of
source code into english for educational purposes. 
Users who are already developers would be able to
figure out how to code a specific algorithm that's
perhaps written in a programming language they do not
understand.  Users who are not already developers can
easily learn advanced concepts.

Anyone who might be interested in creating library
files for any reason and for any language, please
reply to this message.

More news later,
Nate

Actually, http://maps.yahoo.com/beta/ is very useful. Look
for Yahoo! to roll out many cool ajax-enabled properties
in the near future. Less you all forget, Rasmus works
there, making Yahoo! very PHP savvy.

By the way, site scraping may not be a crime but it is considered 
"hostile" by many webmasters. Not to mention that you might be lifting 
someone's database, you are also using their bandwidth to do it, and 
muddying their stats, etc.

So if they are smart they might hinder your ability to scrape as much as 
possible (that's what I do on competitive sites).

By hitting the site with curl, what user agent are you offering? Ditto 
for wget... there are recommended configurations to deny (or better, 
misdirect) such requests as
wget 1.1 	wget 1.1
Wget 1.8.2 	Wget/1.8.2 modified
Wget 1.9 	Wget/1.9+cvs-stable (Red Hat modified)


How about a scraper honeypot? There are many of those out there tying up 
the harvesters because, well, harvesters are evil.

Another method is to put a /whatever into robots.txt as a deny, with a 
link on the home page.. Anyone who asks for a file in there  is by 
definition a bad bot (as you would be if you simply parsed the home page 
for links and followed them scraping). A script can tie that bot up with 
endless loops of autogenerated garbage or perhaps comon sql inection 
atempts, folowed by an IP ban ater N attempts. This stuff is out there.

Personally I like serving realistic (but fake) Apache error codes 
whenever I am hit with wget because I know those are *nix folk and it's 
fun to mess with their heads.

I mention all this because it seems you haven't considered that it might 
be part of your problem. When you're ready to step up to the big leagues 
of Spy vs. Spy site scraping, you might start with the Snoopy class. I 
think it's a nice piece of work. It lets you focus on the randomization 
and proxy management, since the fetch is really solid.

Hmmm... I find Google maps to be pretty useful (and cool with the 
satellite image overlays). 

Very helpful to be able to do everything one wants, i.e. zoom and move 
around without having to reload the @#$@ page.

Good stuff, IMO.

You might want to try something like

<Location /script>
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
AcceptPathInfo On
</Location>

and just drop the ".php" extension from your script.php or just put 
the whole file outside the server root and create a symbolic link 
between those two. Put the above declaration in a file and drop it 
in /etc/httpd/conf.d/99_whatever.conf (assuming that you're using a 
recent Apache).

Cannot you just use

<script src="/any/path/you/like/script.js" ...>
and
<link href="/your/style.css" ...>

Or you could do it like I do:

global $CONFIG;
$scripts = $CONFIG["scripts_external_path"];
$styles = $CONFIG["styles_external_path"];

$template = <<<EOL
...
<script src="$scripts/script.js" ...>
<link href="$styles/style.css" ...>
...
EOL;

This way you can keep the information about where the files should 
be found in your PHP script. Put the required files anywhere you 
like and modify

I'd fear the dynamic include also. For example, even the above 
implementation a has possible security issue. If the user sends HTTP 
request "GET /script.php/../file.css" you would end up with 
$extra_path = ".." and $file = "file.css" and you would include 
"../file.css", which I guess wouldn't be always safe.

Guys i am still in need of help with this ;)

Here is an explanation of what i have tried so far.

i am trying to fetch data from yellowpages.superpages.com, the script
i have written does this, i feed it a category url, it grabs the
records, checks to see if there is a next page or not, if there is it
grabs the url, then re-executes with the new URL until it hits the
last page of the category.

The issue i am having is this.  It reaches out to the first page and
grabs the results, but when it reaches out to grab the second page i
get the following error
http://codebowl.dontexist.net/images/ypresult.jpg

now what doesnt make any sense to me is that if i echo the URL that is
grabbed (second page) and paste it to my browser i get the results
fine, i dont see that error page.  If i feed the second page url to
the script it grabs the records then errors when trying to go to the
3rd page

The following is the current code i have

		$url = explode('?', $url);
		$url = $url[0].'?'.$url[1];
		echo $url . '<br>';
		$c = new Curl($url[0]);
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1);
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
		//$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_URL, $url);
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_POST, 1);
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $url[1]);
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_HEADER, 1);
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_COOKIE, 1);
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_ENCODING, "gzip,deflate");
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "User-Agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U;
Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7");
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_REFERER, "http://yellowpages.superpages.com/");
		$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR,
'e:\htdocs\tmp\cookies\superpages.cookiejar.txt');
		//$c->SetOpt(CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE,
'e:\htdocs\tmp\cookies\superpages.cookiefile.txt');
		$this->source = $c->Execute();

that's the curl code i have, i have tried to use POST, POSTFIELDS, i
have tried encoding the query string values, i also have cURL setting
the cookie and have tried with and without that

here's the cookie set by cUR

# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
# http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html
# This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.

.superpages.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	1290438669	SPC	1132758669510-yellowpages.superpages.com-42072-519770
.superpages.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	0	web	
.superpages.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	0	shopping	
.superpages.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	0	yp	PS:45$

Here are the headers output with the cURL exec

HTTP/1.1 200 OK P3P: CP="NOI DSP COR DEVa TAIa OUR BUS UNI"
Set-Cookie: SPC=1132758669510-yellowpages.superpages.com-42072-519770;

text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1 Content-Language: en-US Content-Length:
9082 Date: Wed, 23 Nov 2005 15:11:09 GMT Server: Apache Coyote/1.0

You can also see the page running at the following URL
http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/codebowl/yp.php

What really srikes me as odd is that i can feed the script an array of
URL's and make it loop over each to grab each page.  However making it
traverse the pages automatically is where i am having the issues.

I have also compared the URL's from the actual HTML page and the one
grabbed by cURL

Here is the one from the HTML page

http://yellowpages.superpages.com/listings.jsp?PS=15&CB=1&L=VT&CID=00000518939&paging=1&F=1&OO=1&PI=15

and here is the one grabbed by cURL

http://yellowpages.superpages.com/listings.jsp?PS=15&CB=1&L=VT&CID=00000518939&paging=1&F=1&OO=1&PI=15

as you can see they are exactly the same so i am not sure what could
be going wrong here.

as before the latest code is located at
http://codebowl.dontexist.net/codebowl/System/Misc/YellowPages.phps
http://codebowl.dontexist.net/codebowl/System/Misc/Curl.phps

I have taken a look at that mozilla plugin however i dont know what i
am looking for as it doesnt show what happens in cURL and that's
really what i need to know.

Any help would be appreciated.

I'm using the following function:

function isValidUTF8String($Str)
{
# correct UTF-8 stream has every character starting with zero bit
# or first byte has <length of encoding> high bits set and all
# following bytes have highest bits set to 10.
for ($i=0; $i<strlen($Str); $i++)
{
	if (ord($Str[$i]) < 0x80) continue; # 0bbbbbbb
	else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xE0) == 0xC0) $n=1; # 110bbbbb
	else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xF0) == 0xE0) $n=2; # 1110bbbb
	else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xF8) == 0xF0) $n=3; # 11110bbb
	else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xFC) == 0xF8) $n=4; # 111110bb
	else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xFE) == 0xFC) $n=5; # 1111110b
	else return false; # invalid byte
	# verify that n bytes matching bit sequence 10bbbbbb
	# follow where bbbbbb is not 000000
	# failing this test means that input is "overlong UTF-8
	# encoding", which is not allowed.
	for ($j=0; $j<$n; $j++)
		if ((++$i == strlen($Str))
		    || ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xC0) != 0x80))
			return false;
}
# couldn't find errors, it's probably valid UTF-8 data.
return true;
}

I put all user input through that function and if the input isn't a 
valid UTF-8 string, then all user input get's through the 
Latin1->UTF-8 conversion (utf8_encode() helps here).

You could do additional checking if the input is something else but 
Latin1 in case UTF-8 test fails, but I think it's not worth the effort.

You cannot trust that behavior. Specification only says (IIRC) that 
the user agent MUST not send characters outside iso-8859-1 on such a 
form. MSIE is known to automagically convert from its internal 
character mapping to this SGML entity presentation but there's one 
major problem with it -- it doesn't differentiate in any way if user 
inputted such data verbatim or if the result was due automatic 
conversion by user agent. The only idea is that numeric entities 
always use only US-ASCII and that should be always safe.

The problem that you cannot differentiate between user input and the 
automatic conversion is just one reason why this conversion is not a 
good idea. Another one is that the user agent has no idea if the 
inputted content is going to be printed through HTML. If it's going 
to database and the get's printed to a ticket, for example, the user 
will be really surprised when he sees such code inside his surname, 
for example.

User agents that behave according to the spec are expected to send 
literal "?" for every character that cannot be send with the current 
encoding or prompt the user to decide what to do. Or to disallow 
input of any character at all that cannot be transferred.

The only reasonable safe way to get the input to the server the way 
the user intended to is to use UTF-8 encoded form. If somebody knows 
still better way, I'd be interested to hear about it, too.


As a side note, I'd like to add that in some sources it has been 
suggested that one should embed a hidden field that contains a known 
payload and the server then examines how that payload has been 
encoded. For example:
<input type="hidden" name="test" value="x&#12531;x&#xE4;x&#28010;x" />

Note that the user agent is *supposed* to convert the above 
numerical references to real characters and then submit those 
characters with the encoding it *really* uses. Then the server 
proceeds to check if value of test is "x?x?x?x". If not, proceed 
to test if the value matches with with any other (incorrect) 
encoding of that string you know how to fix.

In the real world, user agents that don't support UTF-8 don't 
usually know how to even incorrectly represent characters outside 
iso-8859-1 either.


I guess that what I'm trying to tell you is that to *force* 
iso-8859-1 input only, you're going to have to use UTF-8 for the 
form and you'ge going to have to use UTF-8 internally. That's the 
only way you can really get in iso-8859-1 encoding the same data the 
user really tried to input.

The &'s in the "Next" URL on the results page are displayed as an html 
entity.

See if this does anything:

223c223
<             $this->nextpage = $matches[1][0];

htmlspecialchars_decode is not a php function do you mean html_entity_decode?

Rolan,

Thanks for pointing that out, not sure how i missed that, i guess i
was concentrating too much on curl to see it lol.

Works like a charm now ;)

This works for me but I have limited needs.

         $width = imagesx($img);
         $height = imagesy($img);

         if ( $width > $height ){
                 $ratio = $tw / $width;
         }else{
                 $ratio = $th / $height;
         }
         $newWidth = $width * $ratio;
         $newHeight = $height * $ratio;

         $rimg = imagecreatetruecolor($newWidth,$newHeight);
         imagecopyresampled($rimg,$img,0,0,0,0,$newWidth,$newHeight, 
$width,$height);

         imagejpeg($rimg,$thumb);

         imagedestroy($img);
         imagedestroy($rimg);



Good Luck

Wow, that's weird - that looks almost exactly like some code we just wrote
for a project.


function ConvertImageToThumbnail($inPath, $outPath) {
    // Convert the image at the path specified by $inPath
    // to a thumbnail image at the path specified by $outPath.

	// Get the width and height of the actual image.
    list($width, $height) = getimagesize($inPath);

	// How big should the thumbnail be?
    if( (119.0/$width) > (119.0/$height) )
        $scale = 119.0/$height;
    else
        $scale = 119.0/$width;

    $newwidth = $width * $scale;
    $newheight = $height * $scale;

	// Create a new thumbnail image of the correct size.
    $thumb = imagecreatetruecolor($newwidth, $newheight);

	// Load the original image.
    $source = imagecreatefromjpeg($inPath);

 
imagecopyresampled($thumb,$source,0,0,0,0,$newwidth,$newheight,$width,$heigh
t);

	// Write out the thumbnail as a JPEG.
    imagejpeg($thumb, $outPath);
}  // ConvertImageToThumbnail

it looks like we all using almost the same code.

Okay, I'm in way over my head here.  I'd like to get my hands on that 
spec -- would you have a link or some reasonably unique keywords to 
google for (w3c, character encoding, specification, etc. don't seem to 
be cutting it...)?  I should just dig in there and understand what I'm 
doing before trying to implement anything, I think.

What I'm really trying to do is not encode their input into Latin-1, but 
figure out if they _entered_ Latin-1 characters in the form and if so 
accept it, or if not, reject it and tell them why.  If we just encode 
their Chinese characters into latin-1 neither I nor anybody around me 
will be able to read it, not in any encoding or character set, because 
of human language limitations; so I want to require the user to enter 
either common western characters only or nothing at all.  Anyway, maybe 
it's a fool's errand...

Thanks for bouncing this around with me.  If I do go with any particular 
approach I'll let you know as an update.

If you prefer your thumbnails to always have a consistent height and

Jeffs & co.,

I just saw this article which was posted yesterday on developerWorks.  Not 
sure if it helps your project, but might be a good way to manage low-level 
image manipulation code if it's something you find yourself doing often.

Thanks for bouncing this around with me.  If I do go with any particular
approach I'll let you know as an update.

I have learned the hard way that MySQL lib is not pre-packaged with 5.0.5.
So on a quick windows test box with a directory similar tot he below, where
should I put the DLL so the cgi.exe will find it? I Tried changing my
php.ini all around but it never seeemed to even be looking in the correct
folder.

D:_Storage_
   |       |
   |  FOLDER: PHP; Contains my upload and cgi etc.
   |       |
   |    FOLDER: Ted; Contains images
   |
   |
   FOLDER: View; Contains HTML templates
   |
   FOLDER: CTRL; Contains Packages
   |
   FOLDER: TSCT; Contains usernames and passwords

>From my PHP.ini:

; Directory in which the loadable extensions (modules) reside.
extension_dir = "D:/PHP/DLLS/"

I've tried a ton of different subdirectories, even left it blank, heh. And,
YES, I have the extension set to be loading. (extension=php_mysql.dll) =D
Although I also turned that off and turned on dl() and tried ad hocing the
dll from within a page... still no worky.

Thanks in advance.

http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#unacceptableCharacters
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#adef-accept-charset
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2388 section "4.5 Charset of text in form 
data" and section "5.6 Interoperability with web applications"

Be warned that some older clients don't like to use 
"multipart/form-data" encoding which should include a clear label 
defining the used encoding.

But the problem is that unless you're using UTF-8, you cannot always 
identify between iso-8859-1 and say windows-1255. The safest way I 
can think about is to require UTF-8 encoding and then check that the 
  real data I'm getting only uses characters that can be represented 
with iso-8859-1. UTF-8 encoding is nice because it cannot contain 
any random 8 bit bytes unlike iso-8859-1 or windows-1255. It's 
pretty easy to identify illegal UTF-8 sequence. It's next to 
impossible to identify incorrectly encoded 8 bit encoding.

As I said, I'm trying to get input with UTF-8 encoding always and if 
it doesn't look like UTF-8 encoded, then I just assume that the 
input is iso-8859-1. It's not _really_ safe but as I said, it's 
really hard to notice if the *incorrectly* encoded message really 
contains something valuable in some unknown encoding.

You could just use UTF-8 for the form and check if the user agent 
sends valid UTF-8 strings. If not, report the user that the user 
agent he's using is broken. No need to guess which character the 
user really meant.

It's a shame that PHP has such a weak support for UTF-8.

During a phone interview with Google last year, the guy asked me "What 
is the hardest problem you've ever solved?" and I replied, "Well, 
they're all hard until you solve them."

and in other news....  Today, Verizon's critical 411 infrastructure was 
brought down by an internet attack. Verizon has not released any details 
except for the fact that federal authorities are investigating the 
suspect and his accomplices...

Make sure that if you use this PATH_INFO approach that you carefully 
clean up the "input".  I found when doing this recently that a user can 
include quite a lot in the URL without the script being aware of 
troublesome stuff in the PATH_INFO.  For example...

/script.php/../../more/info/
/script.php/var1////var2/

Whether or not either of these might be trouble depends entirely on what 
data your script is expecting between the forward slashes that you get 
from preg_split.  Make sure that the input closely matches what you're 
expecting -- if it's supposed to be a numeric database ID, make sure 
that the data is ONLY numbers.  If it's a filename, make sure that it 
cannot be used to traverse your filesystem, etc.

I used to program in VB and C++ and loved the graphical programming environment.  Then, I got into web development and PHP, and all the while "fought" the hand coding and lack of standard code behind objects that I knew in VB.  I tried PHP with Dreamweaver, but the code Dreamweaver created was not "clean" code that could be easily tweaked.
   
  Microsoft just brought out the Visual Studio 2005 environment, and I'm blown away as I'm learning the web development tools using ASP.NET 2.0 with C# or VB which have much of code you can pull in, including Data Binding.  Microsoft is letting anyone try out and use the Express versions for a year.  I love to hear if any professional PHP-ers here have tried it and your comments/comparisons about Visual Studio 2005.

  I used to program in VB and C++ and loved the graphical programming environment.  Then, I got into web development and PHP, and all the while "fought" the hand coding and lack of standard code behind objects that I knew in VB.  I tried PHP with Dreamweaver, but the code Dreamweaver created was not "clean" code that could be easily tweaked.

  Microsoft just brought out the Visual Studio 2005 environment, and I'm blown away as I'm learning the web development tools using ASP.NET 2.0 with C# or VB which have much of code you can pull in, including Data Binding.  Microsoft is letting anyone try out and use the Express versions for a year.  I love to hear if any professional PHP-ers here have tried it and your comments/comparisons about Visual Studio 2005.

I'm actually gonna download it and check it out. I'd love to see what
they offer, and bring any interesting ideas I see from there into my
PHP experience. It would be nice if PHP had some sort of excellent RAD
environment, but there just isn't one that compares to what Microsoft
puts out. Zend IDE is great but it lacks a WYSIWYG HTML editor... and
every WYSIWGY editor is lacking an extensive JavaScript component and
widget library.. What's up with that?? ;-)

In the future I see everything as drag and drop with the flexibility
of people able to dive under the hood like we do every day in PHP. I
can't wait to see what Zend will be bringing to the table with the new
framework also. I'm quite curious.

I've become rather speedy at creating applications lately, I can
design templates in Photoshop/GIMP, cut them up, and HTML and style
them in Dreamweaver very fast. And then start dropping in the PHP
components I use most often. Sometimes I feel quite saucy as I do it,
knowing that I am working at closest to light speed as I can with the
toolset I have. But there is nothing more powerful than opening up a
single application and going RAD crazy. It's just f*cking rad! ;-)

And someday, yes someday, we'll only be dragging and dropping UML and
it will make the applications for us, or at least that's what I've
been hearing. ;-)

I'll be back with a review of Visual Web Developer 2005, unless it eats me.

This is exactly what was going through my head when reading that post.

So, are you saying that you like MS products better because they relieve 
the need for you to perform as a responsible individual and write your 
code portable and generic so that it can be used in many different projects?

I don't think I am interested in any platform which pets you and tries 
to define good coding as not putting forth the initial effort yourself.

Hey, guys, nice to hear your responses.  However, there's always 2 sides to an argument, and I do not agree with you.  Somehow men think that only hard work is how things get done.  With women, they know it's finesse that works.  And I believe Visual Studio has finesse and class (sorry for the pun).

Can we save the generalizations and gender stereotypes for another

Wow... so fast to respond to her like that? How but a bit of slack... 
someone called her a spammer when even I recognize her name from prior 
involvement.

That said, I totally agree it was spammy language, all flowery and such. 
But then, the gender.... <I kid!>

The question for me is does that GUI promise deliver or just look 
pretty? (no, not hers, but Microsoft's). They sually spend aot of time 
making it look so promising, and so convincing, and leave out the final 
15% needed to be practically worthwhile unless you simply follow the 
heard.Where's that link to Microsoft's EEE strategy....

In my experience, PHP is a far more reliable and stable language to deliver  
cross platform/cross web browser apps.  They also tend to be MUCH easier  and 
faster to build.  They have a very low cost of entry for all  users and 
organizations - even look at web hosting costs - MS hosting  is still more expensive 
and far more restricting -  then upfront costs are  high.    And the fact is, 
Sun and Oracle support  PHP extensively for the fact that it is easy to 
create and  maintain highly scalable websites.  
 
On the other hand, I know a lot of great websites and clients who use  
ASP.NET.  There apps are good - unless you're on a mac, or... :)  The  real test 
will be time.  And the fact is, Billy just sent out a memo saying  online apps 
are the future, ie., salesforce.com, netsuite (oracle), on-line  quickbooks, 
etc.  So we will see who wins in the end.  That is life,  it is what makes it 
fun.  (Besides how would I make any money when clients  spend a ton on the 
drag-and-drop promise from MS and I come save the day  with a LAMP. :)
 
I am just curious, Susan, how long have you been a member of nyphp?  I  do 
not remember ever reading any posts from you on any of the NYPHP  subsections?  
Are you affiliated with Microsoft somehow?  Are you  being paid/asked to do 
this?  I just want to keep the record straight b/c I  know MS is not above 
paying someone to post something like this in hopes of  getting a few new php 
programmers to try their fancy new drag and drop product,  instead of really 
becoming programmers. (I know this is called  something but I forget what) I am just 
curious, and I hope that you  are just another programmer frustrated by 
another language, because I have been  there - I think they call it JAVA.  But I 
wouldn't want to be entertaining  this conversation if it was just a PR stunt 
from MS.  And this whole "men"  comment seems just weird?  Not all of us are 
men, and for as long as I've  been a member (approx. 16 months, maybe more) I 
have never, ever, heard any kind  of comment like that - and I can assure you 
things aren't always pleasant - like  I said, it just seems weird.
 
If you are for real, what type of apps are you developing?  Is your  
argument, "I'd rather spend time developing my application design and GUI and  
workflow, not tinkering with the simple/same DB access code?  
 
I think a lot of us here strive to be really good programmers and Internet  
web app developers in a very pure sense.  Most of us have created our own  
libraries or reusable code - all of it hammered out by us - even with the  
assistance of other NYPHP members.  It is not easy, but when you are done,  you own 
that code - it is not some mystery code MS created.  That is how I  make a 
living, and I am sure a number of other people do the same.  For me,  and I would 
imagine all of us would agree, hard work and a whole lot of  ^&#!@ finesse is 
required on every job - that is a programmer - male or  female.  Are you a 
programmer?  Or are you more of a system  designer?
 
Anyway I would just like to say, on this thanksgiving weekend, thanks for  
all the good talk and advice from everyone.  
 
This is a nice place to be,
it is all free
and PHP 
is better than ASP

I had to work at it really, really hard, but since I am a search expert 
I was able to see 31 posts since May 2003.

Hello all;
	First, I want to say I'm new here.  I guess you can call me

Welcome aboard, Kurt!

It's holiday time around here, soit may be a bit more entertaining than 
usual. If you are in NYC, however, I recommend the monthly meetings and 
"pub sessions" afterwards. That's where the *real* entertainment is....

>>Susan Said<<>'Finesse'? 'Women'? 'Somehow men think only hard work is how things get done'?<<

This language sounds very instigative to me, and I'm not sure if this is an appropriate post for this particular forum.

However, having had to wade through numerous 'NetObjects', 'Dreamweaver', 'Visual Studio' and other 'assisted' created pages, I'd say that having the most atomic knowledge of your code is best, from a technical perspective. Now if you're a project lead or Exec. I could see the draw of such products, being as it will allow you to shave costs on not having to hire more technically savvy coders. IMHO, educating them to use Eclipse with the hundreds if not thousands of different plugins would be a much wiser choice.

There is something to be said of the increase of deployment speed, and the comparative decrease of stage-time. Visual Studio does seem to lend to developing applications quicker. But then again so does Ruby. Or the proper usage of various frameworks, such as QCodo or Mojavi. I guess in an enterprise facility it all depends upon what you want to standardize on.

For PHP, I tried the ZEND app, which was neat, but still some things to be desired. I use Eclipse alot, however, I always find myself back in old Homesite+ inevitably... I guess some of us are just made to swim through code.

  Hey, guys, nice to hear your responses.  However, there's always 2 sides to an argument, and I do not agree with you.  Somehow men think that only hard work is how things get done.  With women, they know it's finesse that works.  And I believe Visual Studio has finesse and class (sorry for the pun).

Is anyone aware of a way to auto-set "created" and "modified" datetime 
fields in a database using PEAR's DB_DataObject library?  I have these 
two fields associated with just about every table in my database, and it 
would make sense to me that these could be automatically set when using 
::update() and ::insert() methods on any of my DataObjects.

Mike,

Wouldn't it be easiest to set that in the database? For example,
MySQL's timestamp data type is auto-set when you create and update a
record I believe.

I had considered a timestamp for the modified column, and currently have 
that in place.  I am also thinking that if the application could handle 
this on it's own, then it wouldn't be exposed to automatic changes in 
timestamp if I had to do manual administration on the database tables.

Also, the "created" column can't be a timestamp, otherwise it will 
update every time the record is changed.  I want this column to reflect 
only its own creation time.

Cool. I understand. Why don't you modify your generated DataObject
classes and have it auto-set the required date property during
instantiation?

As a long-term resident of Seattle in the last decade, I remember
delivering several projects on the initial platform (then called
Visual InterDev 1.0 IIRC). My experiences on that platform were, that
as long as you stuck to commonly-needed functionality and standard
widgets, you were good to go. The second you deviate from the rest of
the herd, unfortunately, meant you would have to forego the comfy
controlled confines of the graphical environment and dig manually
through thousands and thousands of poorly formatted, generated code.

In short, it was excellent if you were developing the same exact appls
that everyone else was needing to develop. If you needed something
unique or uncommon you were at a great disadvantage, as the
development environment was not friendly to the do-it-yourself
approach.

My wife is the smartest person that I know, and she once explained the
difference of the environments (and their impact on me personally)
most succinctly:

"You know, back when you were on Microsoft stuff you spent the entire
day swearing at your computer. Now that you are back to open source
you spend the entire day swearing at yourself."

I have never heard a more profound observation of my work habits than
that one sentence, and it couldn't have been more correct.

With that in mind I suppose it is irrelevant what your gender is, but
more important who/what you want to be the cause of your
limitations/frustration at the end of the day. And I'd rather be mad
at myself for not figuring something out the first time, than be
trapped in an environment that I cannot fix.

This is a perfect scenario for triggers, IMHO. That way you can avoid
the use of timestamps and control how the values are manipulated.

However you are right with the notion that manual changes to the data
will also change the 'last_edit' values, so I can only give this
advice with a grain of salt ;-)

I just finished taking a class on ASP.NET and I was impress.
I was an ASP programmer back in 2000 using Visual Studio.
I like writing code using 'vi' and I am all for PHP programming
but ASP.NET  is impressive.  I am playing a bit with a Creator and JSF.
Sun's Creator is trying to do similar drag and drop that ASP.NET offers.
Althought my current job is as a C/Unix programmer I missed the PHP/WEB world.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] GD or ImageMagick or...?
Message-ID: <438B2BE9.8070402@email.smith.edu>

Hey guys,

I'm writing some custom blog software and want to add some features to 
handle uploading/storing/displaying photos.  On upload from the user I 
want to use PHP to do some image manipulation.  Initially, I will 
probably just want to be taking the image(s) and creating two or three 
different sizes.  Later on I may want to perform some more complicated 
tasks on the images but not right now.  For the foreseeable future 
upload and output files will be jpg.

I have checked my server environment and it appears that it does not 
have GD or ImageMagick installed.

It seems that GD will do what I need.  Also, from some googling around 
it seems that ImageMagick is a bit more complex and would require more 
of a learning curve to get started.  Since the project needed to be 
finshed yesterday I'm thinking that GD might be preferable.

This is a request that I need to make of my server administrator.  In 
order to make a knowledgeable request I'm doing as much up front 
research as possible.  I've never administrated a server so some of this 
is new to me.

I'm reading http://us2.php.net/gd to try and get a sense of what is 
needed.  For example, it appears that for GD I would need to ask my 
server admin to recompile PHP with GD enabled?  Or is this just stuff 
that can be changed in the .ini file?

I'd appreciate any comments regarding the best way for a (slightly) 
experienced programmer to get up and running with some basic PHP image 
manipulation features.  Certainly the code that was posted just recently 
on the other thread for resizing with GD will be very helpful.

Any corrections on mistaken assumptions would be helpful as well.

Thanks very much!

-Aaron

Actually, I was doing .Net development in C# for most of last year along 
with some classic ASP.  Prior to that, I was a Java guy for a few years 
while learning a bit of PHP.  Since then, I've been about 70/30 Java and 
PHP, so I have a pretty good feel for most of those.

Anyway, the thing that got me about .Net development vs the Java and PHP 
development was the availability of components.  The .Net communities 
had lots of components available, but the vast majority of them were 
compiled-only and exclusively commercial.  This is great for corporate 
developers who have the budget and developers who don't need to consider 
the underlying architecture and/or quality of the code, but I have 
rarely been in that position.  Some of the code was probably great, but 
I couldn't tell you.

 From the PHP perspective (and especially Java) there are libraries to 
do just about anything you need and sometimes the array of options are 
simply dizzying.  The sense of collaboration is leaps and bounds beyond 
where .Net is in terms of available components, discussions, and general 
community.

Cool tools are great, but that's only one facet of development.

My 0.02,
keith

Aaron,

You don't have to limit yourself to what your hosting company has provided.
You can run any image library you want, loading it dynamically from a page.

that can be changed in the .ini file?

I'd appreciate any comments regarding the best way for a (slightly)
experienced programmer to get up and running with some basic PHP image
manipulation features.  Certainly the code that was posted just recently
on the other thread for resizing with GD will be very helpful.

Any corrections on mistaken assumptions would be helpful as well.

Thanks very much!

To clarify, it's not a hosting company.  I'm in a college environment 
and work in one of the administrative departments.  The web server hosts 
a number of departments' web sites. 

The server administration is done by the Information Technology 
department.  They will certainly be amenable to modification requests.  
My department is one of their most important "clients".

Setting that aside for the moment.  Can you give me an example or 
examples of an image library?  How would I load it?

Thanks!

I believe Ed is referring to the dl() function.  See:
  http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.dl.php
This would let you load a GD or ImageMagick php extension on-the-fly and
use whatever you chose.

You'll still need to have the shared lib built and available.  I've seen
this done for Ion Cube encoded apps which load the decoder extension,
where a set of .so's for various PHP versions are part of the app's std
dist but not otherwise.

I've never had to do this as I most always have enough access/control to
build/install PHP how I need/like. Maybe Ed can provide some insight
into best practices for doing this?  I'd be curious to hear about it,
but can't say I'd use it.

Give your situation of having an IT team at your becon call to setup PHP
as you see fit, I'd leave the dl() function alone.  

That aside, I'd suggest going with GD to start.  There is plenty of docs
out there on the subject, its been around for a while, heavily used,
well supported, and will take care of your stated needs no problem.

Using ImageMagick will require using the convert/mogrify executables or
the PECL extension.  The former may not be a bad way to go but you may
find less docs directly related to use w/ PHP as your interaction with
it would be building command line args to the executables.  The latter
looks like its been stalled for quite some time (since June 2004) and
may be a dead end.  Other wrappers may exist, but you may find them
wanting.

HTH,
Andrew

Why, just think of all the mindful finesse used in this very statement!

(I know, I'm late on the ball.)

For the record, I think it's more a matter of how one goes about using a
particular tool than it is about the tool itself.  The tool itself does
absolutely nothing when not used by a person, and a person can use a Bose
system to annoy the neighbors just as easily as a Pioneer.  It's more a
matter of how clean, efficient and secure you are in annoying your
neighbors.

Slightly related, the following announce was published a couple of days ago
in the phpsec list:

http://rgod.altervista.org/efiction2_xpl.html

Notice how one of the security problems disclosed for this application is
due to the app checking if an uploaded file is a valid image, but then
saving it under the server's document root without changing its name.

A specially crafted image allows for valid php to be embedded and in this
case executed. The uploaded file referred in this exploit is a valid gif
file, so $_FILES['type'] will return 'image/gif'.

So don't forget some good practices: always filter user input, when
possible store files outside of the document root (serve them through a
properly secured script) and run the web server under a user with no write
access under the servers document root.

Thanks Andrew.  GD sounds good.  Do you know if they will need to 
recompile PHP or if it's just some ini and/or other changes?

Message-ID: <C060CD66406DAC48BD8DAF0DCBB0C3FE032377B5@nycexc1.HeadwayCorp.net>

Has anyone ever tried to integrate MS Integrated Security with a PHP
site? Here's the scenario: 
 
Internally, we have several sites on different domains for different
things (like our help desk, our intranet, our CRM software, etc).
Usually, users have to log into each site using their network
credential, however, through a Kerberos set up, we are using Integrated
Security in Microsoft and IE,  so that when a user who is already
authenticated on the network goes to one of these sites, the Integrated
Security / Kerberos set up recognizes them and does not force them to
log in again. 
 
Now, I plan on redeveloping our Intranet website using PHP, and plan on
building applications that would require user authentication (basically
- just the username). I want to be able to "sense" what user is logged
in through Integrated Security and use THAT user name  (all the peons'
computers are forced to use IE) . If it were a cookie then PHP would
automatically sense that, of course, but Integrated Security is
something different, we think (my techs seem to be unsure how it
actually works, or they were too busy to give me a full answer).  
 
Any idea if Integrated Security says anything to the website about the
user's presence so that I can grab it with PHP, rather than having to
have the user re-enter their username or full credential?

Hello Everyone,

I'm doing a project that needs to allow the user to create a rich text
document (in a web form in Firefox) that can contain bold, itallics,
underlines, fonts, etc and then save that as a PDF document that retains the
formatting. I'm having two issues that I'm hoping someone can help me solve:

1: Can anyone recommend a good cross-brower rich textbox control that I can
use as the editor?

2: Has anyone ever taken the contents of a rich text formatted textbox
control and created a PDF out of it? What did you use?

Thanks in advance. I know it's probably a simple question to some of you but
it's driving me absolutely nuts.

To (1) the answer is "no", I'm afraid.  I think the best thing out there
is either FCKEditor or HTMLArea, but both are a bit flakey.

Regarding (2) ...

I did a project that generates fairly complex PDFs (mutliple pages in
three-column layout with some image locations in the layout).  It
generates a 4 page newsletter based on a slew of parameters the user can
manipulate.

I ended up writing my own little markup language to handle the
formatting, and then built a basic javascript-driven tool help the user
mark up their text. 

For rendering, I went with the FPDF library.  This was back in 2003, and
my first choice at the time was to use FO as the markup language and use
a library to render it.  Unfortunately, there weren't any Free tools to
do it with, and I didn't want to start evaluating commercial products
due to time and budget constraints.  So instead of a nice reusable
system, I have a script that drives FPDF which was a bear to write.  And
it's full of magic numbers.

If I were you, I'd start looking at FO tools and see how far that gets you.

gives some general background -- not a 'blow-by-blow' description
of individual directives.

prefork will most probably be your best bet
(not because you are running Solaris but because you probably would
like to have the option of running php as a module with extensions
which may not be thread-safe)

Prefork, as Tim pointed out. Sorry you can't use those threads.

Let us know what you find, Peter. Aside from choosing which mpm to
use, I tend to think that there aren't any significant configuration
differences, but I can't actually back that up with empirical
evidence.

Of course, you'll need to compile PHP with a slightly different switch
( --with-apxs2 ) to use the Apache2 Server API.

Dear Jeof -
You'll have to excuse me if I don't understand the problem correctly... I
think that you could use sessions for this purpose (
http://us2.php.net/session).  You can store the username and (one-way
encrypted) password in a user's session, along with a unix timestamp
indicating the time he/she logged in.  You can then authenticate those
against a db from any number of different domains.   I think it is even
possible for multiple web servers to share the same user sessions (though
I'm not sure how that is done).  If you can't share sessions between
servers, then you can at least create a database table to act like a
session, with records that expire after a pre-determined time.  It's not MS
Integrated Security, so it might not be what you are looking for - but it is
a widely-used authentication method (certainly works for me).

Cheers,

Just so you know, Andrew - if you plan on being able to rotate images,
you may find the GD library to be insufficient.  GD has the ability to
rotate images, but at the penalty of poorer image quality.  Every time
you rotate an image with GD, it gets worse.  I've been told that
ImageMagick doesn't suffer as much of a problem with this as GD does,
though I've never tried it myself.
That being said, I've used GD with great success on numerous projects;
it handles resizing, resampling, and conversion with little trouble,
and the learning curve is next to nothing.
Cheers,

the company you showed does on-site training

All courses are run by world-renowned leaders in their field. Training
sessions can be held at your premises and tailored to your individual
requirements. Prices start at ?1600 per day.

That wouldnt be a bad price if you had more than just 2-3 students ;)

It's not the OS in this case, but rather PHP.  Depending on the version of
PHP, thread support is getting better, but I wouldn't want to play with it
in production for no good reason.  Go with Prefork as Snyder points out.

Things are basically the same in terms of configuration.  Which brings up
the classic question; if you're using prefork, and don't need any of the
extras Apache has to offer (not related to PHP), then why use Apache 2?  :)

Apache 2 could have some benefit to PHP, but unfortunately there isn't much
movement on that front and most Apache 2 deployments with PHP are basically
made to run as close to Apache 1 as possible.

I read "run by world-renowned leaders in their field" as meaning the
teachers are world renowned, but all of their workshops etc. were in London.
If you see something differently please pass it on.

My partner sent them an email to see if they did anything over here and if
not did they have any recommendations. If anyone is interested in what we
hear back feel free to hit me off list.

http://www.covalent.net/resource/docs/Apache1.3to2.0MigrationWhitePaper.pdf 


gives some general background -- not a 'blow-by-blow' description of
individual directives.

prefork will most probably be your best bet
(not because you are running Solaris but because you probably would like to
have the option of running php as a module with extensions which may not be
thread-safe)

for more background see:

Thanks for that tip.  Oddly, when I've used GD on a project I've never
had to rotate images.  Though, on projects I've used ImageMagick to
rotate images quite a bit and can attest to it doing it very cleanly.  I
guess I was lucky.

Hi List,

With much thanks to Mikko for his help, I've finally figured this out 
enough come up with a way to test for valid Latin-1 input.  If I am 
right about this, then the following modification to Mikko's code will 
report whether or not a particular string, assumed to be UTF-8 encoded, 
is within the Latin-1 character set:

-----------8<-----------
function isValidLatin1String($Str) {
     $latinHex = array ('20', //
     '21', // !
     '22', // "
     // snip for brevity...
     'c3bf' // ?
     );

     # While checking for valid UTF-8 stream, compile each character
     # as hex codes and match with latinHex array;
     # correct UTF-8 stream has every character starting with zero bit
     # or first byte has <length of encoding> high bits set and all
     # following bytes have highest bits set to 10.
     for ($i=0; $i<strlen($Str); $i++)
     {
         if (ord($Str[$i]) < 0x80) continue; # 0bbbbbbb
         else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xE0) == 0xC0) $n=1; # 110bbbbb
         else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xF0) == 0xE0) $n=2; # 1110bbbb
         else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xF8) == 0xF0) $n=3; # 11110bbb
         else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xFC) == 0xF8) $n=4; # 111110bb
         else if ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xFE) == 0xFC) $n=5; # 1111110b
         else return false; # invalid byte
         # verify that n bytes matching bit sequence 10bbbbbb
         # follow where bbbbbb is not 000000
         # failing this test means that input is "overlong UTF-8
         # encoding", which is not allowed.
         $char = bin2hex($Str[$i]);
         for ($j=0; $j<$n; $j++) {
             $chara .= bin2hex($Str[++$i]);
             if (($i == strlen($Str))
		|| ((ord($Str[$i]) & 0xC0) != 0x80)) {
                 return false;
             }
         }
         if (!in_array($char, $latinHex)) {
             return false;
         }
     }
     # couldn't find errors, it's probably valid Latin-1 data.
     return true;
}
-----------8<-----------

Initial testing seems to confirm confirm what I think I've figured out 
already.  Thanks to Mikko for lots of clues and advice from his own 
experience.

Dear Mikko,

Thanks very much for your help figuring out this issue.  Clearly I'm new 
in this area.

Also, I guess it's obvious that I'm looking for solutions for a specific 
problem in a specific project.  It seems proper that I should ask you 
before using your code.  This particular project is an in-house 
application for my non-profit employer; I'm also considering using it 
within the Polymer Project (http://polymerdb.org), which is GPL'd, and 
on which our in-house project is based.  May I use a modified version of 
the code below in that GPL'd project?

IT seems that this function requires UTF-8 input and doesn't convert 
it to Latin1... in which case the name of the function is misleading 
at best.

I think it should be called
isValidUtf8PresentationOfLatin1()
instead.

There's an error here, if I've understood the code correctly. 
Because you have multibyte sequences in the above $latinHex array, 
you must also compose the full UTF-8 byte sequence for the input 
character to check against that array.

Oh, I think that should be |$char .=| instead. In that case, this 
part of the loop does the thing I describe above.

Again, if there're no errors, then it's (and not just probably in 
this case!) a valid presentation of Latin1 string in UTF-8 encoding.

>      return true;
> }

You could also implement an easy optimization combined with 
additional features in a following way:

change $latinHex array to look like

$latinHex = array(
'21' => "!",
'22' => "\"",
// snip for brevity...
'c3bf' => "\098", // ? -- FIXME, check the numeric value of ?
);

Notice that you shouldn't try to insert any 8 bit characters in that 
array verbatim.

Then you could replace the part

          if (!in_array($char, $latinHex)) {
              return false;
          }

with

          if (!isset($latinHex[$char])) {
              return false;
          }

which should result in much more efficient execution. In addition, 
it's now easy to collect the respective Latin1 string with a simple 
catenation of characters. Just replace the above with

          if (isset($latinHex[$char]))
          {
              $output .= $latinHex[$char];
          }
          else
          {
              return false; // invalid character
          }

You might want to rename $char to $sequence (or something like that) 
to better describe it's meaning in the above function.


An another implementation would be to use the isValidUTF8String() 
function I provided earlier and if the input is UTF-8 string then 
you just do

$latin1 = html_entity_decode(htmlentities($utf8, ENT_NOQUOTES, 
'UTF-8'));

and check that there's no html entities in the result. This can be 
done easily with a regexp (didn't try to run this):

if (preg_match("@&(?!lt;|gt;|amp;)@",$latin1))
	return false; # UTF-8 input outside Latin1
else
	return $latin1;

The above regexp tries to match character "&" unless it's part of 
&lt; or &gt; or &amp;

This implementation assumes that htmlentities() doesn't have bugs. 
I'm not sure if that's a safe assumption...

I think it's okay. It's pretty much identical to one mentioned in 
PHP manual (search for "seems_utf8").

You might also want to check the comments in
http://php.net/utf8_encode
and
http://php.net/utf8_decode

Perhaps it has something to do with NTLM? See
http://adldap.sourceforge.net/faq.php

I have just one request: if you find out how it works, please, share 
the information to rest of us.

Hello.

I need to implement one out of two scenarios to run a mixed Java/php

1- install a Tomcat Server with php support
2- add jakarta support to an apache configuration

Any of you, wise men (and women - hello Susan ;-) ) has had the need

Alberto,

Option 2 is certainly your best choice, as Apache is a much more robust 
HTTP server than the one built into Tomcat.

It's been a while since I did this and my experience was with Tomcat 4.x, 
but the general flow is that you build Apache with PHP as normal, then 
hook Apache to Tomcat via a connector (there are/were several 
implementations out there).

This out of date walkthrough might at least put you on the track towards 
getting the pieces you need in place.  It applies to previous generations 
of all the software involved.   If you do get it working, please post your 
solution here.

Thanks Mikko.  This is very, very helpful.  As of a couple of months ago 
I'm half a country away from any NYPHP meeting, but maybe I should mail 
you a beer from Texas.  :o)

I know we have some folks on this list with plenty of i18n
experience... has anyone gone down the GNU gettext road?

It seems to present equal measures of good, bad, and ugly:

1) good - the _() function, lightning fast translation
2) bad - restart Apache every time .mo files are updated
3) ugly - the GNU documentation recommends emacs for translating...

Are there better ways to localize the strings in your scripts? I'm not
concerned with content here, just interface -- errors, prompts,
labels, etc.

You may want to check out PEAR::Translation2 
(http://pear.php.net/package/Translation2). It doesn't actually take 
care of managing the translation strings but it does provide a nice 
consistent interface. You can swap out different backends to find the 
one you like best without having to change your code that much. Plus the 
different decorators make it easy to add features without affecting the API.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Double Loading PHP as  image - Firefox or PHP?
Message-ID: <020a01c5f607$5dae38b0$6500a8c0@enobrev>

I have a hit counter script that I've been growing in the back yard for a
few months.  I decided to go back and water it today, just after upgrading
to the latest Firefox release (1.5) and while testing I noticed an oddity...
 
Now, the basics of how the script works.  You call count.php as an image
from your site (<img src="count.php" />), it adds the hit (and other
wonderful data) to the db and then outputs a 1 px transparent gif.  There's
more to it with js and all kinds of fun stuff, but that has NOTHING to do
with this particular problem...
 
While testing other browsers (IE, FF 1.07, Opera, etc - all pc), Everything
was working great, but with firefox 1.5, I was getting 2 hits every time.  I
removed the image code, and It would hit once.  Put it back... Twice.
 
I combed through my code, found nothing and decided, what the hell, take my
code out... And so here's what's left - nice and simple:

--------------
count.php
--------------
<?php
    require_once 'function.file_put_contents.php';    // PHP5 magic in good
ol' 4
    file_put_contents('./output.txt', date('m/d/Y G:i:s') . ': ' .
$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . "\n");
        
    header('Content-Type: image/gif');
    header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename=count.gif'); 
    readfile ('./count.gif');
?>
--------------
 
And when I load count.php into the browser, I get this:
- the first one is FF 1.0.7
- the second is IE whatever (latest from windows update)
- the third and fourth are one load from FF 1.5
- the 5th and 6th are a single refresh on FF 1.5
--------------
output.txt

Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
--------------

So, since it's a brand new version of FF, and my test code's too damned slim
to find anything 'off', AND, with all other browsers I've tested - getting
one hit per load, I'm beginning to figure this to be a bug/feature of the
latest greatest FF.  But before I begin barking up that tree, I wanted to
ask the local gurus if my headers are whacky (I've tried a few combos, this
one's just the shortest - and the original, which I've had for months), or
if for some reason browsers are supposed to do this and they all just
haven't been.

In the end, I figure I'll have to try caching the image for a second or two
and hopefully that'll calm FF's load-crazy ways.  But oh how wrong it would
feel to do so.

Happy belated Turkeys...

Thanks!!!

Not to "beat a dead horse", but I like open source.
I am developing an extension in C for PHP. I have access to Zend library 
functions as well as the rest of C. (ANSI almost as cross platform as Java)
Not easy in Mono or .NET AFAIK.
Ruby on Rails isn't drag and drop, but the same ideas come to mind about 
code reuse and structured programming (if you need that much structure 
for RAD).

The IDE conversation is always interesting. The best coders I've seen 
use VIM and EMACS and have enough macros to play a keyboard like a 
piano. That's RAD (pun intended)
I use Eclipse, KDevelop, BBEdit, and Dreamweaver depending on what 
platform, lanuage I'm using. They all have subversion plugins, SFTP, 
etc. You may also want to check out Komodo, in addition to Zend studio.
I've used the old Visual Studio out of necessity - but no matter how 
nice Microsoft gets, it's still a golden bird cage.

Guessing: maybe it has something to do with the page cache settings.

Whoa. So let me get this straight... if it's a regular image, FF only
hits once. But if it's your script, then FF hits twice?

What happens if you remove the Content-Disposition header?

Strange.

I do something similar and have not noticed a problem. You may want  
to try passthru instead of readfile.

Hope it helps.

I'm not sure about calling a plain image.  I'll have to check my logs...

Same. Same.

Adding caching headers (even a day ahead) didn't work either.  Well, not
directly. When called from an img tag, the caching headers take care of
business.  Here's what I used:

header('Expires: ' . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s", time() + 2) . ' GMT');	
header('Cache-Control: max-age=2, must-revalidate');	

I'm completely confused as to why it double-loads on a direct call.  I
suppose I can keep the caching as my workaround, since the plan is to always
call through an image tag.  But I really wish I understood why...
Whhhyyyyy!!!!!

Alright, changing the Content Disposition to 'attachment' (from inline)
helps... When calling directly from FF 1.5 it tries to download, only
writing to the output file once.  Calling from an image tag from any browser
seems to work normally (writing once).

Is there a means of outputting an image with passthru without using
imagemagick or pnm?  I have Imagemagick on this server, but no pnm.  I'd
rather not need either if possible.

Thanks for your time, guys.

Howdy,

...snip...

If I understand correctly, then Chris is right, and you don't need the
Content-Disposition header, /at all/. Try commenting out the line entirely.
Yeah, you often need it, but as an inline image, you don't.

That said, I can't fathom how it should give you double hits. I just ran this
code:

<?php
$fd = fopen($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/hitcounts.txt','a+');
fwrite( $fd, date('r') . ' | ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . "\n" );

header('Content-Type: image/gif');
header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename=count.gif');
readfile ($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/images/and.gif');
?>

and it works fine; single hits every time.

BUT.....

I have a Firefox plugin that lets me peek at the response headers, and when I
turned that on -- surprise! -- it *also* requests my script, and thus,
generates another hit. Check all you plugins, especially web development-type
ones that might be generating more requests w/o your knowing it...

I meant to mention that I also ran this:

<?php
$fd = fopen($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/hitcounts.txt','a+');
fwrite( $fd, date('r') . ' | ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . "\n" );

header('Content-Type: image/gif');
header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename=count.gif');
readfile ($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/images/and.gif');
?>


*wihtout* the Content-Disposition header:

<?php
$fd = fopen($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/hitcounts.txt','a+');
fwrite( $fd, date('r') . ' | ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . "\n" );

header('Content-Type: image/gif');
readfile ($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/images/and.gif');
?>

all good.
