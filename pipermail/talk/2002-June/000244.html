Please help create a comp.lang.php newsgroup !
I just got this in my email - every vote counts !

---------------------
Another issue that is not really related with the PHP Classes site butis
very important for the recognition of PHP as a language well supported
within the programming community, is the fact that finally a newsgroup
named comp.lang.php is about to be voted for approval in the Usenet.



For those that do not know what this means, Usenet is probably the oldest
network of discussion groups distributed over the Internet. It has several
hierarchies of groups but only the Big 8 are well distributed among ISPs.
The comp hierarchy is one of the Big 8 hierarchies.



There are already the alt.php, alt.php.sql and the alt.comp.lang.phpnews
groups but the alt hierarchy is not one of the Big 8 hierarchies andso
it
is not so widely available as the comp hierarchy. There are also several
regional PHP newsgroups that are even less well distributed.



The official mailing lists maintained by the PHP Group are also available
via NNTP but AFAIK no ISP redistributes those news groups.



Having a PHP newsgroup sub-hierarchy under comp.lang.php is not justa
matter of having a better distributed hierarchy of PHP news groups. Itis
also a matter of status for PHP as well recognized language.



If you go to Google and see the list of languages under the comp.lang
hierarchy, you see there 55 languages and none of them is PHP, as ifPHP
would be such a minor language that would not justify a hierarchy for
itself.



<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;group=comp.lang">http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;group=comp.lang</A>



So, it is very important for PHP and all of those that work with it,that
the comp.lang.php group just submitted for voting becomes approved.



The Call For votes message was posted here:



<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1023125386.82479%40isc.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1023125386.82479%40isc.org</A>



So, all you need to do to contribute to the process of approval is tosend
a message to <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">vote at technopagan.org</A> with the text &quot;I vote YES on
comp.lang.php&quot; in the body of the message.



Eventually this link will help you do it without much effort:



<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">vote at technopagan.org</A>?Body=I%20vote%20YES%20on%20comp.lang.php



Of course, you should only vote YES if you agree with the creation ofthe
news group, but as subscriber of the PHP Classes site I assume that you
most likely agree that it is a good idea.



In the name of the PHP community, thank you for your cooperation.



Regards,

Manuel Lemos
