I like to keep the right to programs I create in case I get a client that
wants something similar and I just need to modify some aspects of it making
the development easier and if I get a client that ones the exact program
then I can sale it to them, how do you guys think its the best way to go
about doing this?

 

 

+1 for the two prices approach. 

 

A good way to explain this to the client is that any program you write is
going to be made of bits and pieces of past client's programs in order to
save everyone time and money. As a bonus, they get code that has been proven
to work in the past. In return, they need to allow you to reuse any
non-proprietary code that you create while working for them.

 

Proprietary code needs to be written from scratch and isolated from other,
non-proprietary parts of the program, so it costs extra. How much extra
depends on how much of the final code it is.

 

It would be a very good practice for you to create and maintain a shared
library that is distinct from work written exclusively for one client or
another. Then it becomes really obvious who owns the copyright to what: you
own the copyright to the library code, and your client owns the copyright to
their program.

 

Also, +1 to lawyering up. That's another expense that gets passed on to
clients who are finicky about copyright issues.
