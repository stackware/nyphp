<PRE>&gt;<i>From the conversation we had it seemed as if he wanted to resale it or might
</I>resale it in the future, he's argument was why am I going to pay all this
money for something I don't own, I told him ones I'm done it, will be yours
to use as you please you own that copy, but you cant resale copies to other
people / companies.

At the heart of this would be the question --  why do they want to own the
copyright? Is the software something that needs deals with securing their
systems so it needs to be kept secret or has something to do with a
proprietary process to their business? Do they have concerns that you would
do similar work for their competition? Could they have plans to market the
software you create for them? If that is the case, I can see them wanting to
own it.

 

Sometimes clients have misconceptions about copyright ownership and that it
implies some sort of control over something they may not need control over
at all.

I have a question that maybe some of you can shed some light or what your
experience with this might be or how you guys handle it. I was contacted by
a potential client that wants me to create a custom program for him, I said
not a problem, my company usually reserves all the rights an any an all
programs that we create, this particular client want to own the rights to
the program, I'm a bit hesitant as I like to keep the right to programs I
create in case I get a client that wants something similar and I just need
to modify some aspects of it making the development easier and if I get a
client that ones the exact program then I can sale it to them, how do you
guys think its the best way to go about doing this?
