reasonable to allocate as much time for testing as there is allocated for

the code, but also end-user documentation, sales literature, process 
descriptions, specs, docs for support, auxilliary applications, installation,

Nicely put. Quality code is one of the biggest savings potentials for a 
software company. If you are a carpenter and only have crappy tools and crappy 
material the hut you build will collapse sooner than later. The same mechanism 
apply to software. Nevertheless, I wittnessed many times what I call 
&quot;developer arrogance&quot; where writing quality code was not seen as a necessity, 
since &quot;support can deal with it&quot;.

&gt;<i> Quality is not something you can accept less of to complete a task 
</I>&gt;<i> faster. If you omit quality from your code, the project will take more 
</I>&gt;<i> time to complete.
</I>
I disagree, you can take shortcuts, such as not documenting code and omitting 
anything other than the &quot;how it is supposed to be used&quot; path. One might argue 
that this would not constitute project completion, but when time and money are 
scarce for a software project the QA and doc team get cut and 'cheaper' 
developrs get hired to do the job. Typical behaviour in companies where 
shareholder value (short term gain) is valued more than product quality (long 
term gain).

Too bad that the coding team that crafted the broken code cannot read our 
discussion. I also think that at he origin of this thread the fact was well 
established that the code in question does not adhere to any higher quality 
standards. Which even makes my proposal more plausible: rip it out and do it 
the right way. Otherwise more fixing will be needed and the code won't get 
that much better.
