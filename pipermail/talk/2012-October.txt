I've recently had to close down shop at a start up and pretty much the 
world is my oyster.  If I were to take up a contracting gig what cool 
products do you guys use on Windows/Linux for time tracking and project 
management?

Capsule CRM is pretty solid.

MySQL - PHP:

Anyone have experience with a 64bit mysql server?
Recently tried to move a PHP application to a not as busy
64 bit Dell Server and it and it was vy slow for some unknown reason.
Checked all indexes in applicable tables which matched 32 bit server.
I have optimzed data and checked/repaired indexes with myisamck.
I have run MYSQL PERFORMANCE TUNING PRIMER Version 5.1.31
and made suggested changes but no change in speed of this app.
Moved it back to 32 bit Dell Server and it is fine again now.

I guess what I am ultimately looking for is a decent site or book to
explain
mysql db admin.  Any suggestions or theories much appreciated.
Note: I moved it b/c I thought it would run faster on a 64bit server:-(

Thanks,
Nick

Hi Nick.

Is there enough memory available on the 64-bit server compared to the
32-bit one? I ask because I had a similar situation recently which happen
to be on a 64-bit CentOS server. I had a PHP program parse data and
populate a MySQL table. It ran very slowly, and I found out the PHP program
to make a long story short had a memory leak. There was hardly any free RAM
available and the server was using swap which it almost never does. After I
resolved the memory leak situation MySQL was still crawling so I stopped
and started MySQL, and it was back to normal.

I don't know if this is related to the problem you are experiencing, but I
never had a slow down like this before and the root cause was the memory
issue. I used MySQL out-of-the-box I didn't look into any sort of
performance tuning on this server. It's my server I use for development so
I'm the only one on it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] BDD: Behat, Codeception...
Message-ID: <50884722.7010607@gmx.com>

So, BDD: I see there's Behat and Cucumber for PHP, which are similar 
inasmuch as they use a DSL. There's also Codeception.

http://behat.org/
http://lucato.it/php-bdd-cucumber-cuke4php
http://codeception.com/

I personally have a guttural aversion to the magic DSL style of testing, 
so Codeception looks especially enticing; but I assume that Behat has 
better community adoption, given the crossover effect from Cucumber, and 
the fact that it was adopted by the symfony community.

My shop is using Lithium for framework, and I'm wanting to write a BDD 
plugin using one of these libraries. Any thoughts? General discussion of 
BDD in PHP also welcome.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Member Management System
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.00.1210241905100.71692@venus.atopia.net>

I've been doing some volunteer work for a local non-profit and they have 
been looking into re-doing their member management system.

I decided not to build something custom because their needs are simple. 
Originally, I thought about going with something like SugarCRM and using 
that to store their members.  But eventually, they'd like shopping cart 
integration so they can have members purchase things and have them tied to 
their account.

My next thought was to go Wordpress with woocommerce.  Members can be 
tracked as wordpress users and their role indicates their member level (I 
can create custom roles).  Woocommerce would faciliate the shopping cart 
and a simple wordpress plugin or two could handle the meta data that needs 
to be stored with each user.

Does anyone have any suggestions on other PHP-based alternatives?

Thanks!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] form and database solutions,
 particularly with large records without a common schema
Message-ID: <CANaytcekNxD2=E6n7uzm3W4N1zCGV1uSuL5j4LyPwsmt=6E2eg@mail.gmail.com>

I've got to *quickly* create an application that will have a large form
front-end.  The form doesn't have to be multi-page, meaning it could be a
monololithic page, but the page does have to be dynamic in the sense that
entire sections will depend on options within the form.  Plus, some options
will ideally be treated as 'accordion' type display so that when you focus
on element "foo" to enter details for "foo", a number of checkboxes will be
revealed, and then that section will collapse again when focus is lost.
 Each record is an MLS listing (Residential Real Estate) plus property
photos, plus associated documents.

I'm just wondering if anyone has suggestions on how they've done this type
of thing with a particular framework or set of tools.  Of course the bosses
just want a simple, quick solution that collects this info into a database.


I'm hacking away in Drupal, using the dRealty module as a way to get 80%
there from the start.  http://drupal.org/project/drealty

I was thinking of using a Mongo storage backend because there are 300+
fields for a given property class (i.e. single family, condo, multi-family,
land, commercial), and the "schema" changes for every class and every MLS
system.  Ultimately there would be ~15 different schemas (3 MLS systems x 5
property classes) with more to come.  Since mapping this data into a common
taxonomy has historically been a monumental task [1], I am thinking it
would be better to not map it for storage, but rather to create the field
mappings in code.  If you've done something like this in Mongo (which is
new to me), I'd like to look at it or hear more.

If I were to use an RDBMS as the backend, I'd be tempted to use the object
model inheritance capability of PostgreSQL so that I could more easily
create a limited subset of data fields that are always present in every MLS
system and class (e.g. price, id, address, type, status) and independent
tables would store each property class.  This way views could represent
aggregate data across property classes and MLSes.  If you've done something
similar in PostgreSQL, I'd like to know more about your implementation.

Have you done this in Cake, Symfony, NodeJs, something else?

Thanks,

Greg Rundlett

[1] There is a RESO Data Dictionary http://rets.org/cms/node/180 which
defines 504 fields of data for a Real Estate property listing
