Yes. We put the code in plain site. Probably in the footer.

It's been a long time, and I don't have the code readily
available. However, I would think that you would want something that
was decodable by you, so you could extract the original e-mail address
or user id when the mail bounced back.

Unless you're worried about people spoofing bounce mail to unsubscribe
their enemies, your data doesn't even necessarily have to be encrypted
-- just formatted in a way that's easy to grep for.

That would be awesome, since I get scanned (these are not really
attacks) about every 90 minutes. Some servers are almost constant,
depends on who/what/how many you are hosting on one machine as well.
These are really just scans and automated probes, if someone was
really attacking your server you would most certainly know it - there
is no real way to 'quietly attack a server'.

I install Portsentry immediately upon having a shell on a remote
server, if only to get rid of most of the skript kiddiez. Once that is
done, I can take the time to harden the system.

Some good reading:

* Hardening Apache, by Tony Mobily (Apress)
* Maximum Linux Security, by Anonymous (SAMS)
* Linux Serve Security, by Michael D. Bauer (O'Reilly)

Also there are a ton of resources out there, but the Apache book is a
real good start for linux webservers.

hello
I get a ton of those every day. Since i use freebsd, they get reported to me via email as part of daily security check
The format of that email looks like that:
finn login failures:
Apr 30 10:55:42 finn sshd[31415]: Failed password for illegal user nobody from 67.18.130.50 port 49027 ssh2
Apr 30 10:55:43 finn sshd[32022]: Failed password for illegal user patrick from 67.18.130.50 port 49063 ssh2
Apr 30 10:55:48 finn sshd[32404]: Failed password for illegal user patrick from 67.18.130.50 port 49117 ssh2
Apr 30 10:55:48 finn sshd[33059]: Failed password for illegal user root from 67.18.130.50 port 49150 ssh2
Apr 30 10:55:49 finn sshd[33106]: Failed password for illegal user root from 67.18.130.50 port 49186 ssh2
Apr 30 10:55:51 finn sshd[33753]: Failed password for illegal user root from 67.18.130.50 port 49217 ssh2

and so on, for many many pages.
I got really fed up with this, and since i do believe in a bit of vigilantism, i made a little perl script which gets called from procmail in root's dir on every occurance of those emails. The script sends one email per attempt to security/technical contact for the ip address/block.
Now, this will generate quite a bit of traffic on your end, but i found that nothing gets your attention more about a broken machine on your network than 5000 email messages. Call me a bastard : )
You can call it from procmail like so:
---
[root at finn dev]# cat ~system/.procmail/rc.ssh
:0c
* ^Subject:.*security*
| /root/system/bin/parse_ssh.pl
[root at finn dev]# cat ~system/.procmailrc
PROCMAILDIR=$HOME/.procmail
INCLUDERC=$PROCMAILDIR/rc.ssh
---
The script is below, just remember what happens when you use it...
(yea its pretty bad perl, you'll even find a goto in it )
---
#!/usr/bin/perl

foreach $line (<STDIN>){
        chomp;

I understand your desire to be proactive, but now every port scan (which 
has been judged by the power-that-be to not practically impact system 
performance) on YOUR system runs a script, queries a flat file, 
constructs and generates an email (with potential for logging everything 
that may generate a warningor error or bounce or whatever).

Seems to me like you're feeding the trolls.

Are you setting your system up for more trouble? (not to mention the 
added complexity of another event-driven automated script running on 
your system at someone else's prompting... DOS oppty?).

You are absolutely correct, this solution needs to be used (if at all) on a "disclaimer" basis, where you would understand what you are getting yourself into.
So far, in my case, my server never had a problem spamming some poor admin of a chinese ip block with literally over 5 thousand emails. All that does for me, is make a small dent in the bandwidth available to my server.
Plenty of my friends who saw this script called me a spammer and a script kiddy for generating all the traffic and abusing some poor sap's mailbox, but you know, untill the law that says your system's security is your legal responsibility is passed, i am definetely sticking to this solution.
On technical note, this script while sending out those emails for say an hour generates load ave of no more than 3, and 10mbit connection that this server is on handles the throughput with no problem, including replies and errors. 
But you're probably right, im just waiting for it... I just let the hatred to script kiddies, hack bots and clueless server admins get to me sometimes.

I submitted an article to IBM's developerWorks recently on running 
WebSphere apps alongside PHP which share a single Apache and DB2 instance. 
  The example code I provided with it uses a Struts application as a CMS 
to a PHP front-end.   With that set up the situation that is described on 
the Apache list might be possible.

The article is "tentatively" scheduled for publication on May 11, next 
Wednesday.  I'll ping the list if/when it goes live.  :)

I have no idea what any of the words mean, but I wonder if this would
be helpful to someone trying to hook PHP into Struts:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.java.php

Seems like you should be able to pass stuff back and forth with no problem.

Yeah, although I'm not sure how complete it is.  I think Zend is also doing some work on this front.

Would be a cool topic for a presentation - Krook?  Zend folks?

I've always thought it would be neat if you could write in PHP or 
Python or Javascript and compile it into JVM bytecode.

There is some movement towards this in the JSR mentioned in the Apache 
list thread:

JSR 223: Scripting for the Java Platform
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223

Zend is one of the members of the expert group on this request.  It's not 
compilation into bytecode, but a way to use the language within a JVM. The 
PHP scripts would be included as part of the deployment unit for execution 
an application server (EAR or WAR... bundles of JSPs and servlets).

"When Java developers write Web Applications, they write classes that 
interact with these objects in well defined security, resource and class 
loader contexts. The proposed specification will describe which of these 
Java objects will be exposed to pages written in other scripting 
languages. The specification will be grounded on at least one concrete 
scripting language example, PHP, but the concepts will remain independent 
of the scripting language and, if at all possible, the EG will also 
explore the bindings to at least another scripting language."

Don't waste your time. This is old and unmaintained. Even Sam Ruby
agrees with me. :)

Message-ID: <62162.69.86.84.233.1115073840.squirrel@webmail.ceruleansky.com>

Hi guys,

I think that Zend is working on a new replacement for the old Java-PHP
bridge. I remember reading that somewhere, but I don't remember exactly
where. Perhaps I am wrong, but maybe a little Googling will help me
remember better.

Also - another easy way to connect a Java struts system to a set of PHP
scripts would be web services (XML-RPC or SOAP). You might be able to run
the Struts system on the standard port 80 in Apache, and PHP on port 81,
or somerthing. Then, if the Struts application needs to get information
from a PHP script, and if there is a Java XML-RPC client similar to the
jsolait one for JavaScript, then you could do something like (please
'translate' this JavaScript code to Java in your heads):

var serviceURL = "http://localhost:81/my_php_script.php";
var methods = [];

try
{
var service = new xmlrpc.ServiceProxy(serviceURL, methods);
document.write( service.sayHello() );
}

catch(e)
{
alert('Oops, that did not work out.');
}

So, the idea is to create a ServiceProxy object in Java, and call PHP
'methods' as if they were part of a local PHP object.

Hope that makes sense ...

- Jay

Ok people,

I am desperate to find a PHP-based groupware system that I can use.
Have taken a look at several demos and just cannot for the life of me
find something that ends the pain. Here is what I am looking for:

* calendar (shared)
* tasks (shared)
* email
* files/documents (shared)

Many do these things, but here is the wrench that I keep throwing in
the engine. I want to be able to use external tools to access that
data as well, like Thunderbird for email, and Sunbird for the calendar
(iCal via ftp is fine with me).

Any of you know of a package that will do the external integration part?

Nope. That's the holy grail, ain't it? Chandler-matic type stuff 
(Basecamp, Salesforce, and you it LAMP with an API, too!)

Sorry I can't help. Mitch, what's the best option you see so far?

Ditto... that's why Exchange is king...

Now, there is an "Exchange" that runs on Linux, and actually works quite well.  If your folks are using Outlook, Outlook 2003 doesn't even know the difference.

You might also want to check out Novell - they may be working on something, or have a beta already under SuSE.  I believe there were/are some projects on that attempt similar things, but then you likely won't have the PHP/Web side.

I haven't seen anything that does all those nicely. You could create 
your own based on things that are out there. It would take a bit of 
coding to tie it all together, but since you have the source code, it 
would be doable.
  For calendar, you may look at WebCalendar 
(http://www.k5n.us/webcalendar.php), for tasks there is a very nice 
TasksPro (http://www.taskspro.com/), for email there is SquirrelMail of 
course. Can't think of anything for files/documents.

For email, you may also look at dbMail for the backend, which uses 
MySQL for storage, so you'll be able to access emails in just about any 
way you want.

Although not complete as of yet, it is coming:

This project is sponsored by Novell, and looks pretty damn sweet. My 
coworker has it running at home, it is buggy, but pretty cool nonetheless.

Have you looked at egroupware?  (www.egroupware.org).  I was playing 
with this some time back and it looked quite promising.  For secure 
document sharing, take a look at OpenAFS.

I'm working on one of these (though the name Groupware makes me
shudder) based on earlier forays into calendaring, file sharing, and
mailing lists.

Not that it helps you right now, Mitch, but the future is bright for
"Exchange workarounds" coded with PHP. Glad to see that other projects
are coming along as well.

Yes, check this out: http://www.bynari.net/
Its not free, but its a good and solid solution. Its basically postfix, openldap, imap/pop server with some custom glue, and not too ridiculous of a licensing scheme.
I am not terribly up to date on this type of software, but in the past when I had to find something like this for a client, I ended up recommending spending money, because I wasnt able to find anything that was a complete solution for free. Even on freshmeat the ones that *seem* to be good are not free.
You can always code alot and charge 100 bucks an hour : )

Thanks for the link, that's very helpful.  Looking around my office for

Bynari is an excellent suite of software, but is primarily targeted as
an Exchange replacement. They were one of the reasons that IBM was so
quick to get linux running on their mainframe servers, so they could
pitch mission-critical messaging platforms and dominate that very
lucrative market.

I'm also looking for project management stuff, but Bynari is
definitely king of the hill for general messaging/groupware stuff. The
pricing is not so bad either.

Hi guys,

I had tried an online demo of SuSe's OpenExchange server some time ago,
and found it to be quite good. They seem to be burying it within SuSe's
site now, so I don't know if this (good) product is destined to be retired
after Novell's purchase of SuSe. But it is still worth a look:

Screenshots:
http://www.novell.com/products/openexchange/screenshots.html

There is an 'open letter' to customers stating that the status of this
product may change in the future:
http://www.novell.com/products/openexchange/slox_future.html

It is a bit expensive to license, but seems really nice. It is also web
based.

Best regards,

- Jay Sheth

Subject: [nycphp-talk] image resizing quality loss
Message-ID: <4278CD93.4080702@insite-out.com>

I'm building a tool to resize large jpegs down to two smaller versions. 
  The resized images look over-sharpened, with jaggedy-edges.  I can't 
tell if this is a result of how I'm doing it or if it's something else. 
  Here's basically what I'm doing:

$image_file=@imagecreatefromjpeg('temp.jpg');
$new_image=imagecreate($new_width,$new_height);
$new_image_name=$naming_convention.'.jpg';
imagecopyresized($new_image,$image_file,0,0,0,0,$new_width,$new_height,$image_size[0],$image_size[1]);
imagejpeg($new_image,$new_image_name,100);

Even tho I have the jpeg quality set to 100, the new images look way 
brighter, sharper and more pixelated, detracting from the quality.  Does 
anyone know if/how I can tweak this behavior?

You may want to look into using the imagecopyresampled function if you 
are running GD 2.0.1 or later.

I would also recommend investigating ImageMagick, as I've had very good 
luck with it in the past. (Personally I like to use the "montage" 
program it provides for doing image resizing and thumbnails.)

I have worked on several projects now where I have used gd 1.x, gd 2.x and
ImageMagick 6.x

My casual observations have been:
gd 1.x to be poorer.
gd 2.x to much better in quality.
And, ImageMagick 6.x to be real good and faster.

Given the interest in search engine work I'm cross-posting this here f.y.i.

Reports are coming in that SonicWall firewalls are now delivered 
preconfigured to block any IP that requests robots.txt. SonicWall 
allegedy included this via two of the thousands of recommended default 
security policies. What this means is that search engine spiders will be 
blocked from your site, and that will lead to being dropped from the 
indexes. In fact, some webmasters only found out about this when 
multiple websites were dropped following a firewall upgrade.

This appears to be a major blunder, given how difficult it can be to get 
back into some SEs these days. The justification is ok, but having it ON 
by default or as part of a set of recommended policies is a blunder. 
(because robots.txt holds info on where you do not want spiders to go, 
it may highlight areas of your web server that contain privileged 
information. Given that, the robots.txt may provide sensitive info, and 
that is why Sonicwall claims it is a security risk)

Since many webmasters have no involvement with their network firewalls 
it is probably very wise to give a heads-up to the netadmin people, or 
to otherwise be aware of this issue.

Hi folks.. i need to find an easy way to make FTP users on the fly. Client
wants to give users individual usernames/passwords for FTP access ( can be
10 - 100 ). Can you suggest a script or an easy way to accomdate this..
should be relatively easy as the cleint wants to be able to do it himself.

I also have used ImageMagick 6.x and GD 2.x and although ImageMagick 
appears to be easier to use GD is not bad if you want to just use 
something that's already built into PHP.

There's a couple reasons you're getting poor image quality.  Definitely 
use imagecopyresampled, as Dan recommended, and also use 
imagecreatetruecolor instead of imagecreate.

Hope that helps!

The argument that robots.txt can be used as a roadmap to private areas
is bogus -- private areas should be password protected. I suppose they
would consider rel="nofollow" tags to be a security risk as well, eh?

Can someone explain this one to me?  There is no exploit, no description, no nothing... and this is far from the first time that security focus publishes these types of exploits, PHP or not.

Depends on the FTP daemon.  If it's something modern, like ProFTPd, you can plug it into a database like MySQL, which is then trivial to work with.

Ditto for vsftpd (very secure ftp daemon) - which not only is secure,
but is fast, fast, fast! Also a good fit for virtual account setups
and external authentication schemes.

As to the authoritative answer to why they include it, I do not know,
but here is my assumption.

In the PHP 4.3.11 Release Announcement they mention "...addresses
several security issues inside the exif and fbsql extensions as well as
the unserialize(), swf_definepoly() and getimagesize() functions"

http://www.php.net/release_4_3_11.php

Also reviewing the ChangeLog and with all the _bug_ fixes one can only
assume that many of these _could_ be potential vulnerabilities.

http://www.php.net/release_4_3_11.php

http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.0.4

All this coupled with their desire to be an definitive source for
security/update information, I can see why they would identify version
upgrades regardless of whether there is a known vulnerability/exploit.

Just my opinion.

True, but they say the problems are *in* 4.3.11 - yet 4.3.11 fixes them.  Perhaps a typo, but this isn't the first time of these types of alerts, and quite a serious typo.

I second this recommendation. All the exploit robots out there try only port 22. The only disadvantage is usually when you're behind a firewall you don't have control over.

This report is likely referencing the release announcement that Ilia sent:

"The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate release 
of PHP 4.3.11 and 5.0.4. These are maintenance releases that in addition 
  to fixing over 70 non-critical bugs, address several security issues. 
The addressed security issues include fixes to the exif and fbsql 
extensions, as well as fixes to unserialize(), swf_definepoly() and 
getimagesize()."

Okay, newbie time again. When I first started with PHP and MySQL I wrote
some scripts to do forms and some that would be called to process the
forms. I'm now going back and sorting through the mess and trying to
come up with a standard naming scheme so I can get a better idea of
which script does what.

While I'm here I wanted to ask you wiser folks what other naming
conventions you might suggest I start using now so I can avoid the pain

There are no hard and fast rules that I use, with the exception that 
underscores are a no-no.  I can't stand them in filenames.  Hyphens are 
the one true way to separate words in URLs. :)

As for a directory structure which may be related to your question, I use 
the following structure (sans the application specific directories), 
though NYPHP Phundamentals has a whole include location how to.

I believe Schlossnagle's "Advanced PHP Programming" has a good discussion
in the chapter on style. "Believe," because I don't have my copy on hand
and can't quote chapter and verse. I recall reading something like,
mediocre but self-consistent style is better than partially brilliant but
inconsistent style. Yeah, style is a superset of "naming conventions" but
I think it applies.

A typo on my part.  Meant 4.3.10.  Sorry for the confusion.  The 
announcement was vague, but I assume it was mainly intended to encourage 
people to upgrade.

George suggests (Adv PHP Prog):

- underscores in function names, and suggests always using meaningful 
names for clarity e.g. print_hello{}
- follow Sun JAVA conventions for classes and methods
- always match var names to database fields when they correspond e.g. 
SELECT firstname  -->  $firstname
- be cosistent as possible (whatever you call index vars, always call 
them that; whateveryou call max/min/whatever stick with it)

Other than that he just suggests consistent, readable code.

I still haven't found a good solution to this. I'm even more confused because it *used* to work.

Not sure what to do. I have a work around, I think, but it is a fairly manual process of copying the files off the server and then putting them back after I *own* them.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. I'm trying to avoid world write permissions and I can't use chown/chgrp because my user is not the same as the web server user.

ciao!

It bears mentioning that there are exceptions, as Rich Bowen himself
mentions in that same article.

If your PHP scripts are being executed by nobody and you would like that
nobody to be able to write somewhere for caching purposes, for example...
What alternatives are there besides either making that cache directory
world-writeable, or chowning it to nobody:nobody?

Write an ftp or sftp backend that takes the file and "uploads" it to
your user account on the same server. That way the file is owned and
writeable by you.

Otherwise, um.... store it in a database?

Continuing with the caching example:

The database idea would be a non-starter in those cases where database
access is one of the expensive things that you're trying to avoid.

Doesn't it seem that the s?ftp cure would have to be coded with the utmost
care or it might be worse than the disease, especially on a shared host?
For example, if username/password are embedded in PHP scripts that
themselves are world-readable... It would be interesting to see an example
or psuedocode/outline showing an implementation.

That's subversion --
in general you don't want to let Apache go 
writing around on your server.

(WebDav is not a general case)

You are exactly right. 

It depends on which is more distasteful in a given situation:
world-writeable directories and files, or the possibility that another
user will discover the (s)ftp password embedded in a configuration
file. On a shared host, and particularly for a cache, it's probably
preferable to have nobody own the files then to risk exposing your
password to all other scripts on the box.

But for the caching example, the workaround could be that you render
the pages on a local server that you control, which then (s)ftps them
to a shared host that has a public address and scads of bandwidth. Not
unlike Blogger, really.

A better but more complex workaround could be that files are uploaded
to a world-writeable directory that works as a drop box. A cron job,
running as you, could check the drop box for new files now and then,
and copy them to a normal directory with correct ownership and
permissions. It should compare the file with a hash stored in a
database to ensure that the file wasn't modified by someone else in
the meantime. The webserver will need to clean up the drop box
directory, since you won't be able to delete files owned by nobody.

Three parts to that, but I think it solves most of the problems
without storing a password or implicitly trusting what are, for all
practical purposes, world-writeable files.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP & Word Documents
Message-ID: <8d9a42800505071225376a175e@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

has anyone here ever needed the ability to parse a word document? I have a 
client that creates his newsletters in MS Word and wants to upload them and 
send them to his users in an HTML or text based newsletter. This wouldnt be 
a proablem if i have ever heard of an MS Word Parser, i know there is an 
Excel parser class.. Is there a way to parse a word document?

What i would need to do is take the contents of the word document and 
convert it to html, saving the images from the word doc to a directory so 
that the HTML links could show them.

Any suggestions appreciated.

Thanks.

Any chance you can train the client to save it as HTML with MS Word before
uploading? Your upload handler could check the content type and remind
them if they forget. Then you could repair it with Tidy.

i think that is the next alternative, the client is dumb and just wants to 
upload a word doc. I mean i was going to go the route of using TinyMCE so 
they could do the save as HTML, upload the photos to a directory then have 
the script parse all the image tags...

As David Mintz already suggested, Word has the capability of doing all of 
this itself.  If he can't/won't save it as HTML (NB:  it should be 
*filtered* HTML, which will strip out at least some of the garbage), you 
can do it yourself.  I then use some macros to strip it further, at which 
point it is easily displayed.

I think Joe would rather get PHP to do this work for him. How about just
telling the client your fee for word processing is $800/hour? Comparable
to an anesthesiologist or something.

haha $800/hr

yea i wouldnt mind doing this but the guy doesnt want that, he wants this 
whole automatic system. He doesnt want to have to pay for services like 
that, nor does he want to take the time to do it himself, so i was going to 
develop a system to do it for him auto at a good price.

If you dump the Word document into Dreamweaver, you can graphically add the HTML/layout around the text and easily add any PHP code.

Hey everyone,

has anyone here ever needed the ability to parse a word document?  I have a client that creates his newsletters in MS Word and wants to upload them and send them to his users in an HTML or text based newsletter.  This wouldnt be a proablem if i have ever heard of an MS Word Parser, i know there is an Excel parser class.. Is there a way to parse a word document?

What i would need to do is take the contents of the word document and convert it to html, saving the images from the word doc to a directory so that the HTML links could show them.

Any suggestions appreciated.

Thanks.

You may be able to convert it to a pdf document automatically then parse  
that.  There is a package call PDF2WEB I saw on some website.  The PDF  format 
should be easier to parse.

Open Office will parse word documents.
It stores them in   files with  sxw and stw extensions.

They use a 'zip' format and can be unzipped into 
there xml components. 

Have a look at:
http://books.evc-cit.info/ch01.php 
and 
http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/01/26/hacking-ooo.html 

Once you have some raw xml you should be able to 
'xslt' it into just about anything you need.

You can do this automagically using OpenOffice.org's UNO, more
specifically the Python-UNO bridge. Not aware of a PHP bridge at the
moment, but this is definitely something you could handle via CGI:

Well, it looks like I'll have to apologize to the hosting company for assuming the "write them as my user" was the norm. I'm a bit baffled becuase it *used* to do so, but...

The solution for me will be to let "nobody" write the files in the "holding tank" and leave them as that ownership in case someone needs to edit the file by re-entering it on the form. I will scp (easier to script than sftp) them to my local host where I have root and can edit the ownership/files at my leisure and then put them back on the remote host in the directory where they belong.

Since I own the holding directory I can delete the files when I'm done with them.

Thanks all!

You can use wvware to convert the word docs to HTML or text.  I'd  
suggest pushing it through tidy, too, after.

"antiword" is a command line utility common on Unix-like systems that can 
convert Word into text.

Another suggestion.  On this month's British Web Design magazine companion disk there's 10 HTML converters.  One of them is an RTF to XHTML converter that could work with your situation.  The Word document can be saved as an .rtf file, which strips the Word formatting.

Months back i came across a document management system which does this 
http://dms.markuswestphal.de/ 
It basically uses exec command.

On a windows server it uses 
cscript convert.word.js {SOURCE} {TARGET}

where the contents of convert.word.js is 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
var source = WScript.Arguments(0);
var target = WScript.Arguments(1);

var WordApp;
WordApp = new ActiveXObject("Word.Application");
var Newdoc;
Newdoc = WordApp.Documents.Open(source);
Newdoc.SaveAs(target, 8); // wdFormatHTML = 8
WordApp.Quit();
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a Linux server it uses 
mswordview -o {TARGET} {SOURCE}

There could be better ways for doing it. Would love to hear if any...

I've used AWStats. It's an easy install, it's pretty customizable,
it's easy to hack. The newer versions have XML data files, so you can
pretty much do whatever you want with them on the display side.

The source is a bit difficult to read, but then again, it's perl.

I found it not too terribly difficult to hack it up to extract some
other pattern analysis from the logs, although I never did get around
to getting that data into its output files (I wrote it separately to a
database).

AWStats has a few annoying little quirks (rendering algo for page view
bar charts has been "broken" for a while), but it works great and
generally stays out of the way. Stats are saved into a series of
flatfile databases which *must* be backed up, but they are a lot
smaller than the raw log files.

Other annoying quirk is that all stats must be generated in
chronological order. It skips records that it thinks it has already
seen, whether that is in fact the case or not.

No experience with Webalizer, except that I've considered it once or
twice, but for some reason stuck with AWStats each time.

I have migrated all of my sites to AWStats, as I found the
presentation much more attractive and logical, and have also seen
nothing but positive responses from my clients after they switch.

Still looking for full-blown analysis tools, but for your basic usage
reports, AWStats is the better choice IMHO.

Whatever software you choose, do your homework regarding file permissions before you post it live. You may want the world to know your traffic stats, but if you are in business or responsible for others personal data, I know of no acceptable reason to have your stats acessible on the public internet.

Hint: your web stats are a primary souce of competitive business intelligence.

Been using webalizer for years, and it works good, shows you what you 
want to know. However, it needs a short lesson to get clients to like 
it. It could need some improvement on the guiside, but its sufficient, 
but many other tools are better here, although I havent found anyone 
thats better to script and as easy to implement on large virtual hosts.

Thanks in advance for any experience-based comments or suggestions.

I bought Zend Studio Pro at version 3, and never really used it. I 
encountered some annoyances on install (like what seemed to be a hang 
during install, which turned out to be a hidden console window awaiting 
a key press to continue) and difficulty getting the debugger to work 
properly with the server (turned out to be problems with the GUI 
labeling... we worked our way to success eventually). In the end the 
client/server aspects from the Windows client to a Linux server were a 
hassle. In my experience it was too slow, and not reliable for 
interactive debugging. I never got it to work smoothly from the notebook 
on and off the network. Because of the struggle I never fully adopted 
the client so I admit I didn't give the IDE a good chance to impress me. 
I still have the license for Safeguard (at v3.5) Performance Suite 3.6 
and Studio Pro 3.0 and Encoder 3.5 Plus, according to my Zend account.

Now with PHP 5 pretty widely available to me and all the progress I have 
seen from Zend I want to try again. Sadly, it seems everything I had 
before (still available for use) is not upgradeable to the current 
versions. I hardly see the point in buying it again, especially now that 
it costs even more.

So then there's the trial downloads. Available to try the product -- 
seems a good idea, right?

Experienced as I am (whatever that is), I fully expect that a trial of a 
4.x generation product, installed on my Windows machine, perhaps with 
their Windows enhancer (whatever that is), will muck up my system if I 
decide to use the 3.x product afterwards. You know, blind forward 
compatibility issues and all. Anybody using the 4 or have any hands-on 
experience that would help me out?

I know about the so-called "small business development" plan. Even if I 
qualified for it (gross revenue of $250k/year is hardly a reasonable 
limit for an east coast small business, even during "development") the 
same situation applies. Basically Zend is asking for between $1k and $5k 
*per year* for their product which is not insignificant for an IDE with 
debugger and encoder.

I was a user of NuSphere's PHP-IDE for a while prior to trying Zend 3, 
but I have never found enough bonus to the specialized IDE over UlraEdit 
or Textpad-configured. The debugger is the draw, so if it works well 
enough for me to be productive with it I want to use it.

Anybody care to tell me they *know* the trial versions will be a good 
experience? Or that I should rock on with my 3.x licenses? Or to save my 
time and continue the edit-post-refresh routine and accept that there 
really isn't a decent interactive debugger for the independent web 
developer?

One thinks about PHP certification, which leads to Zend, which suggests 
the IDE (again), which teases with promises of a real debugger and 
server-side toolkit.... is it time to try again?

Thanks again.

John,

Contact Zend sales tell them your situation and i bet you they will give you 
a free upgrade. They gave me one.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] lighttpd and load-balanced php via fastcgi?
Message-ID: <42806E5A.5000000@persson.tm>

Hi,

I just found the lighttpd at http://www.lighttpd.net/ which supports 
some sort of fastcgi which can help to load balance php among a set of 
servers. Is this an oppurtunity and feature of all fastcgi implementations?

Is there any issues using php with fastcgi? I've always used it as a 
module with apache, and thought that was the best way, but it sure 
sounds interesting to have some loadbalancing on some projects.

Have anyone tried this approach and would like to share some thoughts 
about it? More timeconsuming to develop? Maintainability? Scalability? 
Stability?

Thanks in advance,
	Eric

I was able to use 3.5 and evaluate 4 on my machine simultaneously. 
The installer created a /config_4.0 folder next to my /config_3.5
folder and didn't override any of the original 3.5 application files
(putting all the 4.0 versions is a subfolder), Of course, I don't use
windows, but I don't see why they wouldn't keep those sorts of
features the same.

On the other hand, after my 30 days were up, I ended up going back to
3.5, seeing 4.0 as too little improvement for too much money.

Webalizer is ugly, real ugly, makes me a little queasy just looking at
it. One of the worst pieces of information design I've ever seen.
AWStats provides more information, more thoughtfully laid out, and is
immediatly intuitive to use (i.e. no schooling for clients). However,
John's point about locking it down are far from paranoid ramblings. My
personal development site has very little traffic and no public pages
at all. As I review the logs, over the last couple months pokes at
AWStats outnumber any other sort of malicious behavior (although phpBB
seems on its way back up).

I use urchin for a log analyizer. The company i lease my server through (
ev1servers.net <http://ev1servers.net>) offers it for free. You should check 
with your hosting provider to see if its available. It is a very robust, 
very slick, very professional program. It includes a user management system 
that will create users by domain name so if you have a bunch of virtual 
sites you can give them each seperate logins.

Hi Folks -- still dealing with my FTP questions. It looks like the server
has ProFTPD on it..
But it also (ensim) has AddVirtUser via command line.. does anyone out there
have any web based php scripts that add users via AddVirtUser?
Tia
yury

I've searched google... found a few that are run via command line/SSH..need
something similar, but web based.

Do you have root access to the server? Well, since you are trying to
add users, you must :-)

ProFTP has a mysql module you can include at compile time. More
information at http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/doc/contrib/ProFTPD-mini-HOWTO-SQL.html

I have personally done a recompile of ProFTPD with mysql for a client
who wanted to provide free hosting with dynamic account creation, the
setup was a breeze and is still up and running.

Hope that helps.

Urchin is now part of the Googleplex, and is getting very low-cost. It 
is widely believed it will be free soon, because Google wants your 
stats. By trading free stat software for access to your site stats, 
Google gets what I was just saying is a very valuable competitive 
intelligence. Not unlike GMail in some ways, and very much different in 
other ways (I'd sooner use GMail than the new urchin, for sure).

Thanks, Jeff that's very helpful.

On Wndows we have DLL and registry issues that make it more problematic. 
XAMP gets around it nicely, so it is possible to do it, but I'd rather 
not find out the hard way right now.

I was inspired by the Zend Studio discussion to revisit PHP IDEs  
other than my glorified swiss army knife, Vim...

Has anyone had experience with TruStudio from xored?  I really like  
Eclipse for Java which is the underlying platform.  This TruStudio  
looks pretty killer if its solid.

Any experience?  Worth $95/year?

I would say its not worth the money... just go grab the phpeclipse plugins.. 
they seem more stable the trustudio in my opinion. 

I use eclipse every day for java development too.. I think that trustudio is 
close but not there yet. I still think that zend studio is the best php ide. 
I personally think that it has come along way. 4.0 is more stable, seems 
*quicker*, and has a few cool new features. I really like zde's free 
debugger. I have it installed on our staging/development server and it has 
proven very helpful for debuggin/profiling php code. If i where you i would 
give ZDE another whirl. I don't think either of the eclipse based dev 
environments (phpeclipse or trustudio) are there yet. ZDE is close.

Just my 2 cents..

If you haven't seen it already you should check out 
http://www.satokar.com/viplugin/index.php for Eclipse... I *really* like 
being able to use my vim-fu within a nice IDE.

You can check it out for free (older version I think), but its like ~$20 
US to get the 'real' deal.

I have both versions on my PC right now.  I am trying the trial

Thanks Hans. Sounds like an infomercial for Zend!

Seriously though, so you have been a user of 3.5? or 3.0? Do you use the server side debugger or are you commenting on how you like the IDE? If you use the debugger, you have a Windows client and a remote Linux server so I'd love to hear your experiences with reliabiliy and speed of the interactive debugging, especially when you dock/undock/connect remotely.

Andif you don't mind clarifying, are you being supportive because you make your living off of the IDE or did you mean PHP? The former says alot abut the product; the latter speaks to the value of PHP (undisputed).

After your 30 days when you remove the trial I'd be interested in your experience with the Windows dual setup.  Usually the problems happen when you finish and delete (I bet they pay alot of attention to getting it working properly as a trial on someone's system, but I wish companies would pay more attention to leaving your system cleanly when you don't buy/upgrade. Yeah sure, right?) 

My license is for 3.0 and I would have to pay more to even go to 3.5, let alone 4.0  I guess that's the reward for being an early adopter (!).

I'm pretty close to moving on at this point. Doesn't seem to enough gains for the added complexity.

Thanks again for the feedback. I am sure there are others benefitting from these discussions on the list.

Sounds nifty.  I'll certainly give it a shot!

I should try phpeclipse again... my most recent trial of it left me with

Well, I'll probably be giving that a whirl again, too.  I haven't tried
4.0 yet.

I'm also giving TruStudio a try, too.  From my initial perusal of their
site I was under the impression I couldn't use it without a license, but
it seems you may download it.  The licensing still isn't clear, but I'm
downloading it now and I'll soon find out.

Through the years, I keep coming back to Vim with my own little set of
perl and python interface scripts for templating, munging & managing my
buffers. For the curious:
	http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/if_perl.html
	http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/if_pyth.html

I hear there is a Ruby interface too, but I haven't drank that koolaid
yet.

Hi,

I am a relative newbie at this. I suggested to a client that she choose
between godaddy.com, yahoo.com and register.com to host her site. I am not
sure which one over the other to advise though. Does anyone on the list
have any preference among these three and/or any experience with them that
they could share.  I don't think she has more than $20 per month to spend
on a site and I like the 24/7 phone support that all these sites say they
have.  I did hear though, that register.com is one of the most reliable.

Any advice you have would be appreciated.


Regards,

Peter Lehrer

I personally like gandi.net, its a French registrar, comes out to be around 10EU/year. They are a little lacking on customer support side, but I just like the idea of not using an American registrar. They have a fully featured interface, but I would say this recommendation will fare better for technically oriented.
By hosting, do you also mean webhosting/server hosting?
For webhosting, I would recommend www.webhost4life.com. They are cheap, reliable, very flexible, and feature pretty much dymmy-proof control panel.
If you want to host a server, I am using www.pilosoft.com, and they charge me $75/mo/1U with 50Gb/mo bandwidth in a datacenter at 55 Broad st. downtown. 
Im sure you can do better in either category, just recommending something I've used and had a good experience with.

I usually go to netcraft.com to check up on the reliability of web hosts.

A google search for web hosting came up with this link: 
http://www.webhostingunleashed.com/
It looks like all the links on that page are affliate clickthru's so 
take the "top 10" list with a grain of salt, but the customer submitted 
reviews should insightful.

I use the Linux server side debugger in combination with a windows client 
and it works great. In fact we have about 8 developers with ZDE installed 
all developing on the same linux server across multiple web applications. It 
works great.

Despite the clear injunction at http://php.net/mysql_query that "The
query string should not end with a semicolon," it appears that there
is no problem doing it.  This line

$query="SELECT `address` FROM `units` WHERE `unitid`=106;";

is working just fine for me (on MySQL 3.23.51 and 4.0.22). Does
anybody have ideas about what might be going on here? If the
injunction is not enforced, why was it originally issued? Or am I
overlooking something obvious?

Hi,
If you mean secure multipass deletion, this seems to be pretty cool:
http://www.download.com/Eraser/3000-2092_4-10231813.html?tag=lst-0-5

But consider this (waaaay OT, from recent Bugtraq post):

-----
Hello,

Device Configuration Overlays (DCO) is a not so well known optional feature set in the ATA-6 standard and forwards. It is supported by a lot of, but not all, modern disks. Using DCO it is possible to tell a disk that it should appear smaller than it really is, thus hiding an arbitrarily large part of the disk from the operating system.

We have made some tests with DCO and a few common imaging and wiping tools. It seems that most tools are *not* capable of handling DCO at all.

For example we have found that even using the DOS boot floppy of EnCase Forensic Edition 4.18a, the part of a disk hidden with DCO will not get aquired.

Another really bad thing is that disk wipe tools do not wipe a disk with a DCO set on it. For example, the very common tool ExpertEraser 2.0 from IBAS can be tricked into wiping as little of a disk as wished by setting a DCO on the disk before the wipe.

I would like to emphasize that these are only examples of tools that cannot handle DCO, so simply switching to another manufacturers tool will *not* solve the problem. Because the issue affects so many tools we have chosen not to try to contact all manufacturers before releasing this information.

There is a freeware tool coded by me that can set & discover & remove DCO:

http://vidstrom.net/stools/taft/

We have been using it for our research for a few months now but I haven't published it until now.

Also, I have written a report (which was finished already in January this year) on this and other issues related to ATA and Computer Forensics but it has taken time to get it through all the formalities with classification and such, so it will probably take another couple of weeks before I can publish it.

How permanent? Some places can physically recover data off a hard drive 
even after it has been formatted several times.
A reliable way to assure destruction of data would be to store it all in 
a ram drive and make sure it doesn't get cached on the hard disk as swap.

As long at we're OT, I noticed the other day that Apple's drive
formatter offers the option of overwriting each block of an erased
volume 35 times.

As in, I really really really (x35!) want that data gone.

Thanks for all of the suggestions. Someone sent me a copy of SuperDelete and
I'm not sure if it has the flaw that was pointed out in one of the emails. 

And to answer someone else's question...a RAM drive doesn't apply here since
they are files that already exist on a hard drive. 

The initial question about permanent deletion came from a lawyer who needs
to make sure that certain files on a hard drive are gone...forever!

The average user doesn't need to shred the deleted data

An alternative is to remove the disks (platters), and have a barbecue.  
I'm assuming that  if  you were to melt the platters into a small pile 
of slag, that even the most enterprising of data-recovery specialists 
would have difficulties.  If a barbecue doesn't seem hot enough there 
are various additives you could add to increase the heat.  The additives 
I'm thinking of will certainly spoil your franks, some may even lead to 
the barbecue being included in the pile of slag.  Of course, there's 
probably information encoded in the barbecue that would end up being 
recovered.

I have a client that is currently running a website on an AS400 with 
Websphere. Has anyone had any experience getting PHP installed and running 
on an AS400. How about MySQL?

We are going to build a small portal site for this client with a calender 
and CMS for about 10 users. Nothing fancy. Do you think it would make more 
sense to put AMP on a new Linux box on their network rather then messing 
with their AS400?

Thanks!

Yup, IIRC they (IBM) have an add-on for OS400 that allows you to run a
linux virtual machine, with a data gateway (to DB2) and so on.

If they are already running their other websites on the AS400, then it
would make sense to keep all the other websites on that machine as
well. The one exception to this idea is that you might want to
introduce an alternative webserving platform, but that should be a
strategic decision on the client's part.

An alternative is to remove the disks (platters), and have a barbecue.  I'm
assuming that  if  you were to melt the platters into a small pile of slag,
that even the most enterprising of data-recovery specialists would have
difficulties.  If a barbecue doesn't seem hot enough there are various
additives you could add to increase the heat.  The additives I'm thinking of
will certainly spoil your franks, some may even lead to the barbecue being
included in the pile of slag.  Of course, there's probably information
encoded in the barbecue that would end up being recovered.

Message-ID: <4283C7FE.5010108@informationideas.com>

I am wondering if there is a way to write functions dynamically.  This 
is what I am trying to do.

Currently, I have the following:
-------------------------------------------------
function foo1 () {
    global bar1, bar2;

    // code
}
function foo2 () {
    global bar1, bar2;

    // code
}
-------------------------------------------------


I want to do something like the following:
-------------------------------------------------
function write_globals() {
    $output = 'global bar1, bar2;'
    return $output;
}
function foo1 () {
    write_globals();

    // code
}
functioin foo2 () {
    write_globals();

    // code
}
-------------------------------------------------

Obviously, the above code does not work as it is written.  But I was 
wondering if anyone knows a way to make that happen.  TIA

Not sure exactly what the goal is, and there may be a much better way
to do it, but if I understand correctly then this might work:

function write_globals() {
  $command = ' global $bar1, $bar2; '; 
  return $command;
}
function foo1() {
  $command = write_globals();
  eval( $command );

  // code
}

Be extremely careful with eval() to ensure that no user input finds
its way into the $command string, otherwise somebody could execute
arbitrary php code within your application.

Like I said, there's probably a better way to do whatever you are
trying to do....

Well, what I have are some global variables that is set in a global 
include file.  I need to use them within my functions.  The problem I 
have been faced with is that once in a while my code changes require a 
new global variable.  I find myself going into every function to add 
'global $bar1;'.  My thinking was that if I had a function that wrote 
all my global vars, the next time a new global is introducted all I have 
to do is modify the write_globals() function.

Thanks for the reminder on the security issue with eval.  In my case, I 
am safe since I only intend to put globals in my eval.

Tom,

I run PHP (CGI version) and MySql in the PASE environment on the
AS/400. PASE does not require an additional Linux partition. PASE
supports AIX binaries. I run Mambo and PHPAdsNew there.

The performance is mediocre, so I wouldn't try it with a high-volume
site. IBM states that they will improve support for PHP by the end of
2005.

This web site is helpful: i5php.net

I remember doing something like:

function write_globals($bar) {
global $$bar;
print "The value of $bar is $$bar";
}

put the name of the variable into $bar and pass it to the function.

You might want to re-think how you handle the globals in the first place.

Since all global variables are stored in the $_GLOBALS super array, 
why don't you either reference the global variables as an index of 
that array ($_GLOBALS['variable_name']) or use the extract() function 
at the start of each function to get variable names?

Thomas,

I have PHP currently running on our AS/400.  Here is a link:
http://www.i5php.net/

You have to install the PASE environment on the ISeries and there is a 
patch provided by IBM which enables you to access DB2 data directly 
within PHP.  So far IBM has provided this patch for up to PHP 4.3 which 
I currently have working in a test environment.  I recently had an email 
from the following guys from IBM Germany who wanted to know if anyone is 
interested in further PHP development for the ISeries.  Please let them 
know you would like to see further development and support as this may 
get the gears turning:
heiko_mueller at at.ibm.com
BARLEN at de.ibm.com
wolfgang_pauer at at.ibm.com

Keep in touch and let me know what you decide.  It didn't look any 
easier to me to try to get real-time data exchanged between a 
linux/MySQL system and AS/400/DB2. 

Regards,
Nicholas Hart

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP to OBDC / Exchange
Message-ID: <8d7510912e0ce011eb158fdfd509de13@musgrave.org>

List -

I am in the early stages of researching how to go about connecting to a 
remote OBDC server and an Microsoft Exchange server (likely on two 
different servers) via PHP.  At this point I do not know if the polling 
web server will be running on Unix or Windows.

With the OBDC connection, I would like the option of having a web 
interface to an Access database.  The interface would be used to create 
custom queries for reporting.  Does a product like that exist?  I see 
that there are many interfaces for Microsoft SQL server, but not 
explicitly Access.

With the Microsoft Exchange server, I am thinking of writing a program 
to poll emails from accounts for correspondence logging - nothing 
dramatic.  The PHP native IMAP drivers look like they can handle the 
job - but being unfamiliar with Exchange, is it a given that Exchange 
is always running IMAP?

Thanks for any advice, links, etc.  Your advisement is well appreciated.

Thanks,

Stephen

I was just lazy and didn't want to type all the $_GLOBALS[...] when I 
first developed the application.  Now I regret it.   :-(   The extract 
function is perfect!  I had never used it before.  That should solve my 
problems instead of using a function to write the globals into all other 
functions.  Thanks a bunch for all the help.

It's not a given that Exchange is running imap, but I believe it's any
easy option to turn on. If not, maybe you can screen-scrape from
Outlook Web Access.

Imap will give you access to messages and mailboxes/folders, but
events, tasklists, and contacts are basically off-limits. True that
you can devine the existence and subject of these items, but you can't
get at the yummy Microsoft metadata that makes them useful.

Hey folks,

An article I wrote for IBM's developerWorks site went live this week with 
the May issue of the IBM WebSphere Developer Technical Journal.

The article argues that while PHP and WebSphere are generally considered 
competitors, they can work together to support a common type of 
application.  The article covers the roles of a web application, where PHP 
and WebSphere fit in, and how to install them together with Apache and DB2 
on a Linux server. 

I also provided a sample application as a proof of concept.   The example 
code consists of a J2EE Struts application which serves as a content 
management system to a PHP-driven public website.

Enjoy, and don't forget to submit a rating at the bottom of the article - 
if that module shows up for you... I seem to have been spared of it for 
now :)

And while we're on the topic, is there a way to use a visual 
environment like Access to view MySQL?  I have used Navicat before 
which was quite useful, any other suggestions?

I ran across this in the comments section for imap_open() on the 
php.net site:


14-Jan-2004 03:03
In order to make a IMAP connection to a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, 
I used this connection-string :

<?php
if(imap_open ("{192.168.1.6:143/imap}Inbox", "DOMAIN/USERNAME/ALIAS", 
"PASSWORD"))
{
    echo 'Connection success!';
}
else
{
    echo 'Connection failed';
}
?>

By replacing "Inbox" with, e.g. "Tasks", its possible to see all your 
tasks. I Hope this helps anybody!

Regards

Just be careful when using extract() as it is one of those functions you
look for when checking for exploitable code. ;)  For example, I have
seen nasty stuff like extract($_POST) which is register_globals all over
again.

In my experience, you can see the tasks, but not any of the details
associated with them (such as whether they are completed or not). If
you find out how to do this through imap, please share!

I have a ridiculous issue, php.ini is not being read by apache.
I put a copy (all identical) into

/usr/lib/php
/usr/local/etc/
/etc/
My current project's default html/php scripts dir
Server root as specified in httpd.conf

I still get errors displayed, and upload temp file path is still not changing. 
I restart my apache after every attempt.
This is on freebsd 5.2.1 on sparc64, apache 1.3.33 installed from ports, and php 5.0.4 installed from source in /usr/local/lib/php
I am lost. Is there some function may be where I can specify within my script where to look for php.ini?

Thanks for the heads up on extract.  But do you see any security issues 
with extract($_GLOBALS)?

The output of phpinfo() tells you where that build is looking for its
php.ini

Frank,

What you could do is to make a helper function like:

function &get_globals()
{
   return array(
     'var1' => $GLOBALS['var1'],
     'var2' => $GLOBALS['var2']
   );
}

then use:

function myfunc()
{
   extract(get_globals(),EXTR_REFS);

   // code
}

This way you will have all the same access to the variables that you had 
before, and full control over which variables are available.

Frank,

Another thought about using extract($GLOBALS) is that all of the 
'superglobals' ($_SESSION,$_REQUEST,$_POST,etc) are entries in the 
$GLOBALS array, so just using that by itself would probably introduce 
'interesting' behaviours.

Heh, trick question.

In theory it appears fine seeing as the variables were somehow global in
the first place, you are just brining them into a function.

However:
Many times exploits are not just one obvious blaring problem, but a
series of ~questionable~ issues coupled together.  In general, I just
consider extract() to be one of those questionable functions.


You said:
> I find myself going into every function to add 'global $bar1;'

But aren't you in the functions anyway actually utilizing the _new_
global variable.  I dont understand why you would need them in _every_
function if you aren't actually in the function coding to them...

It's true that I would be in the functions making changes anyway.  But 
again as I have stated before, I am lazy and would like to type as 
little as possible.  I rather add one global var by just typing in one 
place and have it take effect anywhere I want to use the global.  Maybe 
some would consider this extraneous work but my laziness still makes me 
think that it is worth the effort at the end.  :-)

Message-ID: <42855234.30009@r2communications.com>

I use the ADOdb abstraction library for my db calls, and I am working on 
migrating some code from PHP 4.+ to 5. I have run the same code before 
on PHP 5, but did not get any error warnings, so I'm thinking that it is 
how I have error_reporting set in my php.ini file. All of the errors are 
from my adodb.inc.php file.

Here are the errors:

Strict Standards: Assigning the return value of new by reference is
deprecated in C:\web\ohcentral_v2\adodb\adodb.inc.php on line 3790

Strict Standards: Declaration of ADORecordSet_array::FetchField()
should be compatible with that of ADORecordSet::FetchField() in
C:\web\ohcentral_v2\adodb\adodb.inc.php on line 3383

And here is what I have for error_reporting:

error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_STRICT

I thought that ~E_STRICT was supposed to hide those 'Strict Standards' 
messages?

TIA.

Hey Folks,

Looking for recommendations on a phpMyAdmin equivalent for MS Access (via

add/edit/delete/view tables that is fine.  Needs to be PHP, as I'm not
running anything else on the box.

Some quick Googling didn't provide any results.  Any suggestions?

Message-ID: <4288FD59.4030300@aarond.com>

Anyone have recommendations on how to secure a webform? What I'm trying 
to do is have the code processing page be able to tell if the referring 
page is on the same server.

For example I'd like to avoid someone trying to send post data from a 
copy of my form on another server to mine.

thanks,
Aaron

The simplest way would be to place a hidden field in your form, which
can contain some kind of secret, like MD5/SHA-1 hash of something
known to the server only. If you pick a random secret, you can store
it in a session and check the submitted hash with the hash of the
secret from the session.

Aside from the helpful information that has been posted, I think it's 
very important to realize that clients send requests, not servers. (Even 
in cases where you want to send a request from your PHP script, you play 
the role of an HTTP client.)

Stated differently, it doesn't matter where an HTML form is located, the 
client (browser) sends the request when the form is submitted.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Hi,

I have a client who is using phpMyAdmin to output their database as 
XML, one XML file per table in their database.

What I need is a few fields from some of the tables, not everything, so 
I can have only one XML file to process.

Is it possible to have phpMyAdmin output XML based off the results of a 
query?

Best,
Mark

If you are using a recent version of phpMyAdmin  (I tested this on 
2.5.7-pl1) you can click the 'Export' link under any result set.

For the life of me, I can't get the domxml set_content() method to work on a
node. 
I can do get_content() on the node. 
How does one update a single node? 

For example:
The following read process works:
$xml = join('',file('listings_list.xml'));
$dom = domxml_open_mem($xml);
$xpObj = xpath_new_context($dom);
$resObj = xpath_eval($xpObj, "//listing[@id=$id]");
$theOne = $resObj->nodeset[0];
$y1Element = $theOne->get_elements_by_tagname('images1');
$i1 = $y1Element[0]->get_content();
echo $i1

The self-same update does not:
$xml = join('',file('listings_list.xml'));
$dom = domxml_open_mem($xml);
$xpObj = xpath_new_context($dom);
$resObj = xpath_eval($xpObj, "//listing[@id=$id]");
$theOne = $resObj->nodeset[0];
$y1Element = $theOne->get_elements_by_tagname('images1');
$y1Element[0]->set_content();

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Mail Headers Malformed???
Message-ID: <8d9a42800505210751bbe6613@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone.

i have a site i am developing on my windows machine and i keep getting this 
error when calling the mail() function


*Warning*: mail()
[function.mail<http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/clients/JVMedia/SimonVolkov/function.mail>]:
"sendmail_from" not set in php.ini or custom "From:" header missing in *
D:\clients\JVMedia\Simonvolkov\System\Email\Mailer.class.php* on line *97*

The problem could be simply solved by me setting my sendmail_from in my 
php.ini, however what if i was in a shared environment, something fishy 
here.

here are my headers in code

$headers = 'MIME-Version: 1.0' . "\r\n";
$headers .= 'Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1' . "\r\n";
$headers .= 'To: '.$mail['fname'].' '.$mail['lname'].' <'.$mail['email'].'>' 
. "\r\n";
$headers .= 'From: "Simon Volkov Newsletters" 
<'.Application::Configuration()->NewsletterFromEmail().'>' . "\r\n";

and here are my headers printed out

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
To: Joseph Crawford <codebowl at gmail.com <http://gmail.com>>
From: Simon Volkov Newsletters <newsletters at svolkov.com <http://svolkov.com>>

Here is my actual mail function call

mail($mail['email'], $mail['subject'], $mail['body'], $headers);


Is there something obvious that i am doing wrong here? I think my headers 
must be malformed because php doesnt see a good custom From header in the 
specified headers it falls back to the php.ini setting (which i have 
commented out)

Any help would be appreciated.

I should also add that when i remove the $headers from the actual mail() 
function call i still recieve this error. So it seems as though i get this 
error no matter what i specify for my custom from header.

I've never seen a from header with THAT in there.  I'd bet removing that

Just wanted to share a quick tip with everyone regarding ZDE sometimes
having issues connecting via SFTP to an SSH server. I know some of us
have had problems with this in the past, so I figured it was a good
tip if not a trivial one.

Both ZDE and Dreamweaver cannot connect via SFTP unless
PasswordAuthentication is set to 'yes' in the sshd_config file. Then
your problems will mystically disappear along with your obligation to
pay income tax.

I'm moving to a new apartment this weekend, and as always, this involves 
getting rid of anything I haven't used in the past year. I have quite a 
few books currently scheduled to be tossed out. Let me know if you're 
interested in any of these. They're free (of course), but I would prefer 
that you pick them up (I live on W 34th St) sometime between now and the 
end of the week. Some of these are brand new (given to me within the 
last year and never opened), and several are hard to part with.

Maximum Linux Security
PKI: Implementing and Managing E-Security
Fundamentals of Database Systems
Foundations of Algorithms
Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Principles in C
Sequential and Parallel Algorithms
Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
Understanding Data Communications and Networks
HTTP Essentials
Linux Programming
SSL and TLS
Web Protocols and Practice
C++ Primer
PHP Developer's Cookbook
Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++
Learning Python
Programming Python
Online Investing Hacks
Ruby in a Nutshell

I also have a few extra copies of HTTP Developer's Handbook and Zend PHP 
Certification Study Guide that I might bring to the meeting to give away.

If you want one of the above books and can't pick it up, I might be 
convinced to carry one or two to the meeting in exchange for free beer.

Oh, mine was purchased 1990, 'cause the one I bought in 1988 was lost somewhere.

I unfortunately won't be able to make the meeting tonight, but I'll 
contact each person who emailed me about the books to try to schedule 
another time to meet. This means I also have 3-4 copies of HTTP 
Developer's Handbook and Zend PHP Certification Study Guide, since I 
planned on bringing those to the meeting.

Hello all,

Thanks for coming to and participating in the presentation I gave this

It is available in a lot of formats, including HTML, OO 2, OO 1, PDF and
Flash.

There is also a links and resources page containing links from each slide:

Hi,

I listened on a quick presentation of what could be done with php and 
xul to create richer client side applications. However, havent heard 
much since then, so, is there any project or community working with 
these things available out there? Does anyone know? :)

Best regards,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] $$ question
Message-ID: <6.1.2.0.2.20050525162303.020e8e20@mail.optonline.net>

I have a question about interpreting $$variable.

I have this:
$concerts2006 = array(
array("January 28","Cypress Club - West Palm Beach, FL"),
);

and then I have this:
function showSchedule( $year ) {
....
$list = 'concerts' . $year; // this gets 'concerts2006' ok when called with 
2006
$num = count( {$$list} ); // but this does not get count( $concerts2006 )
....
<?php echo $$list[$i][0]; ?></td> // so of course this doesn't work

So the problem is at $$list.  It doesn't seem to matter whether I have
{$$list} or just $$list.

I also seem to remember from somewhere that the $$list[][] never works but
I couldn't find it in the docs.

Help??  Thanks.

How about:

	$list = 'concerts' . $year;
	$listref = &$$list;
	$num = count( $listref );
	<?php echo $listref[$i][0]; ?></td>
	...

That $concerts2006 array is available in the function I presume, right? 
If it isn't, you won't get the value of it because it is not local. Just 
checking.

Other than that, I'm not sure. I've used the same, and it has worked for 
me in the past.

Thanks,

Well, according to php manual, the braces are used in the following fashions:

$$var
${$var}

I can't find {$$var} syntax, neither does it work. it throws a syntax error.

>From that, the following code works for me on an php 4.3.11 machine:

$num = count( ${$list} );
echo ${$list}[0][0];

Hope that helps.

Eh... scope is over-rated anyway.  Here's an easy fix:

function somefunction() {
	for ($key in array_keys($GLOBALS)) global $$key;
	...
}

Man, I gotta party after that round. But seriously I think variable
variables belongs "forever in the dog pound". So streamlined and clean --
like looking at a Bang & Olufsen. Why have five moving parts when you only
need two or none.

$concerts2006 = array(array("January 28","Cypress Club - West Side!"));

function showSchedule( $year ) {

   $list = 'concerts'.$year;

   $num = count($GLOBALS[$list]);

   echo $num;
}

Ehh, right?

I agree.  There is a time and place for variable variables and they  
are few and far between.  One appropriate scenario is when using the  
reflection APIs, for instance.  With what info we had about the  
scenario originally in question, I don't feel that is a case where I  
think they are appropriate.

As an alternative solution, personally I'd would have reworked it to  
use a 3 dimensional array, even if the first dimension was small.
     $concerts[$year][$i][$field]
No need for variable variables.  Either way its a hash lookup -  
either in the symbol table or the associative array.  I'm sure  
someone out there may know if there is a difference between those in  
PHP - I don't off the top of my head.  Regardless of what the  
difference might be, I think the array is a better solution overall  
for clean code with the least exposures.

At the risk of looking dumb again, let me revisit this, to explain why I 
was doing it this way, in the interest of exposing some of the smart 
thinking to be found on this list and learning something (and with a 
possible phundamental in mind as well ;-).

I have an array of 2005 concert dates;  I want to display them in a table 
with a heading and date and venue columns.  I have another array of 2006 
concert dates; I want to do the same in a different table.  I wrote a 
function to pull in information for the appropriate year and display 
it.  Then I call the function for 2005 and again for 2006.  This gives me 
no redundant display coding.  Next year I will simply insert the info into 
the appropriate 2007 array, and call the function with that year.

You can see this at work at http://lauratheodore.com/schedule.php.

Relevant code is here:
=============
$concerts2006 = array(
array("January 28","Cypress Club - West Palm Beach, FL"),
// etc.
);

function showSchedule( $year ) {
   ?>
   <h2>Tour Schedule, <?= $year ?></h2>
   <table summary="a list of dates on Laura&#8217;s tour schedule for <?= 
$year ?>">

   <tr>
   <th scope="col">Date</th>
   <th scope="col">Venue</th>
   </tr>

   <?php
   $list = 'concerts' . $year;
   global $$list;
   $num = count( $$list );
   for ($i = 0; $i < $num; $i++){
     ?>
     <tr>
     <td class="left">
     <?php echo ${$list}[$i][0]; ?></td>
     <td class="right">
     <?php echo ${$list}[$i][1]; ?></td>
     </tr>
     <?php
   }
   ?>

   </table>
   <?php
}

showSchedule( '2006' );
=================

>use a 3 dimensional array, even if the first dimension was small.
>     $concerts[$year][$i][$field]

The best I can figure out, this does not permit the (easy) creation of two 
distinct tables.

But from the educational point of view, above is the task I had and the 
solution I found.  How can it be done better?

I'd have to agre with Andrew's solution mentioned above.
Looks like your simple script could even do without a function block.
Here's a more concise way of doing it:


=============
$concerts[2005] = array(
array("January 28","Cypress Club - West Palm Beach, FL"),
// etc.
);
$concerts[2006] = array(
array("January 28","Cypress Club - West Palm Beach, FL"),
// etc.
);
 
while (list($year,$data)=each($concerts)) { ?>
<h2>Tour Schedule, <?=$year?></h2>
<table summary="a list of dates on Laura&#8217;s tour schedule for 
<?=$year?>">
<tr><th scope="col">Date</th> <th scope="col">Venue</th></tr>
<?     while(list($trash,$event)=each($data)) {
                ?><tr><td class="left"><?=$event[0]?></td><td 
class="right"><?=$event[1]?></td></tr>
<?     }
?></table>
<?
}
?>

Exactly. That was the real value I saw in a NYPHP code archive, which would allow commenting by the comunity but be moderated by the organizers (and classified for the didactic value of each discussion). 

It is a knowledge base. Most of those end up accommodating the least common demoninator; the code gets dummed down to the level of greatest consumption. At NYPHP, it is obvious that virtually any code segment that is interesting to these senior guys could generate this kind of discussion -- valuable to those who can follow it, and therefore very valuable IMHO as a high-level PHP resource.

Instead we just check this list every $n minutes, which sometimes amounts

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [OT] bluetooth headset services,

Message-ID: <13427-42793@sneakemail.com>

Thanks in advance for entertaining [OT] posts like this one. I know there are alot of IBM TP users out there in PHP land.

I have a Jabra BT250 bluetooth headset and a Thinpad T42p w/Bluetooth and w/WinXP SP2. Sounds like it should work. Works fine with my cellphone.

After settng up WinXP sp2 I can get the device, driver, and connection but  there are no headset services for the Bluetooth headset on the thinkpad and/or the Jabra. No, Jabra doesn't supply them on their website from what I can determine. So bascially I get setup with a wireless bluetooth headset for my laptop softphone but no functionality. Doh!

Anybody try this? All I have found on the net are "me too"s with no authoritative answers. DOCS suggest that the services should be on the device, but with this setup there are no services listed. 

Thanks again.

which brings me to an idea that's related, if not quite the same thing as
the above. I propose: let's create an NYPHP Cookbook. There are several
fine Cookbooks that we all know and love. This one would would have many
authors; would cover Apache/MySQL/PHP, perhaps more; would not duplicate
anything already existing in the aforesaid Cookbooks.

If you wanted to make it truly unique and amusing, add a gastronomic angle
as well: every technical recipe submitted must be accompanied by an actual
food/drink recipe as well. You could make it tongue-in-cheek if you aren't
handy in the kitchen.

Finally, make this an online publication; let each recipe-submitter upload
a brief bio and optional JPEG of h(er|im)self and thus get a little
exposure. Of course, we could also consider whether it would be
cost-effective to try to print and sell it as hardcopy and raise some $$$
for nyphp.

Who's up for cookbook.nyphp.org? I'll volunteer to be part of the
editorial team.

"PHP coding on $40 a day"
"Thirty minute deadlines"

We should pitch a show to the Discovery channel on giving a development 
team 7 days to implement a content management system and e-commerce site

I'm aware that the NYPHP charter contemplates "New Project Proposal
Submission" and what not, and it isn't totally clear to me whether this
idea would constitute a Project, or whether anybody can formally propose
one. But I'm not kidding, I think it's a cool idea and thought I'd throw
it out there informally to see what people think.

Didn't we recently start a project similar to this?  I think it was the
code archive project?  I think that project is living in suspended
animation.  Not to poo-poo on the parade but I think we should pick up
the code archive project and add a couple of fields that cover the
submitter and beta it.  I know there was a lot of talk about the code
archive project, I think there were a couple of meetings and even some
documents written.  Who knows the current status of the code archive
project?  Are any of you ready to take up the gauntlet and work with the
core NYPHP people to get this thing done?  I imagine that we could spin
the basic set of scripts fairly quickly so that we could start taking
submissions and compiling a database of NYPHP Tasty Morsels.

I would like to see community involvement on this project.  I know for a
fact that the core NYPHP people are currently working on a new frame
work for the entire NYPHP web site, so if any of you out there would
like to join us and help us finish the code archive project and make a
new home for the tasty bits of code we all love to read about, contact me.

If the scripts are kept fairly straight forward and we attempt to solve
just this problem, I think we have a chance of making the project work.
This is a great opportunity to get involved, if you are not an uber
coder or you have some fear about getting involved, just come and give
it a shot.  You will learn a bunch, get to know some really cool people

I am almost certain that nothing I've written would be unique /
valuble enough to be in a "nyphp Cookbook", but I know personally I'd
find one extremely useful for my own purposes.

How about filming explanations of the recipes. Make them entertaining, 
in front of an enthusiastic studio audience, with lots of "Bam! Bam!". 
Make a DVD.

You have got to love it. I may never load more than one page again.
Perhaps it's the tequila talking but moments like this only happen a 
couple times a year, so I had to share it.

But really, it's pretty cool.

Hey James, when will your recording be ready to upload?
Maybe we will use beercasting.com ?

I haven't actually joined any nyphp projects yet, so I can't 
authoritatively comment on why the project faded into oblivion, but I am 
given the impression that the current projects are large, complex, and 
require some sort of approval process to join. These barriers of entry 
are probably intimidating to a lot of people. Comittment to join a long 
term project is also intimidating, where as firing off a quick hack or 
suggestion on a mailing list is not. Small projects are simply easier to 
bite off and swallow.

You know what might work?
If once a week, a small script or real world problem is presented and 
everyone tosses out suggestions, solutions, and optimizations. OH WAIT. 
THE MAILING LIST IS JUST THAT!  (well, some of the time, heh). The 
rapidfire "development cycles" of mailing list chatter results in a 
optimized solution much faster than with large projects. To help guide 
content for the book, the problems should probably be hand picked. Also, 
if  people knew that they will eventually be published, they might be 
more inclined to contribute.

Looking for sponsorship (or at least publicity assistance) could be a good
idea too, like maybe presenting all the code in screen captures from the
Zend Studio or UltraEdit. 

Get Rasmus Lerdorf to do three paragraph intro (Somebody knows him good
enough).

Ultimately, even if the book didn't make it to a brick and mortar publisher.
NYPHP could easily convert the project to PDF (Adobe sponsor? Gets a blurb
touting full range of PDF capabilities.) and make available as
appropriately-priced digital download straight from NYPHP or even make a
click-through deal with Amazon.

Now you're talkin'!

One of the challenges would be to mine the list archives, which surely has
a couple hundred gourmet recipes. I have seen more cool things than I can
remember.

Ajax is a way to update a web page without reloading using  the 
xmlhttprequest object in javascript.
If you tie that in to an XML-RPC call you can have a web-services style 
data being written to a page in real time.

I knew about this for a while but was just happy to spend the time to 
get it to work for me.

  here's an example.

on the client (which is just an html page, no server side processing 
necessary)
I fed the javascript function below the url (the server), the XML_RPC 
method I want to invoke, and the value, in this case a string.

The XMLHTTP REQUEST object does its magic and if the XML_RPC returns an 
XML Doc. The processReqChange() waits for a reply and if its Ok (200) I 
can handle the  reply how i'd like . (I use a delegate() function which 
I feed the XML_RPC method type to so I hnow what kind of value I'm 
expecting.

I can explain more thoroughly later, but I'm late for work.

I'm just starting to work with this stuff. It might be old hat for some

Thanks for the info.

Yes, I have heard about AJax from going to the Java users Group.
Is a way a lot of portals use to update their portlets.

Ajax is a way to update a web page without reloading using  the 
xmlhttprequest object in javascript.
If you tie that in to an XML-RPC call you can have a web-services style 
data being written to a page in real time.

I knew about this for a while but was just happy to spend the time to 
get it to work for me.

  here's an example.

on the client (which is just an html page, no server side processing 
necessary)
I fed the javascript function below the url (the server), the XML_RPC 
method I want to invoke, and the value, in this case a string.

The XMLHTTP REQUEST object does its magic and if the XML_RPC returns an 
XML Doc. The processReqChange() waits for a reply and if its Ok (200) I 
can handle the  reply how i'd like . (I use a delegate() function which 
I feed the XML_RPC method type to so I hnow what kind of value I'm 
expecting.

I can explain more thoroughly later, but I'm late for work.

I'm just starting to work with this stuff. It might be old hat for some 
around here.

Yeah, we did.

David, it's an excellent idea, and although similar to the code archive project, you've added a lot of new ideas to it.

Actually, not really; there are no barriers of entry.  Any project, large or small, needs a motivator.  The project process we have provides some level of organization for a project.  And, to get people interested in helping, a short explanation/description of the project is needed.  It's very simple to do, but just requires someone to take the first step.

Since there are a lot of similar concepts between the cookbook and the code archive project, it'd be even easier for someone to jumpstart that.

Perhaps the language of the charter reads more than it is.  If there are ever any questions about projects or getting started with one, people are encouraged to contact Hans Kaspersetz at firstname.lastname at nyphp.org - it's very easy to get a project going.

So here is the story, I have paged the guys here at NYPHP about the Code 
Archive Project.  They sent the materials to me and I would like to see 
the project move forward.  I think the ideas that have been brought 
forward over the last couple of days have been really fun and 
interesting and should be rolled into the project.  I believe that we do 
not have to start out aiming for an epic piece of software, just a 
system we can develop and have fun while doing it.  If you would like to 
contact me off list we can talk about what needs to be done and how you 
would like to see the project unfold.

The NYPHP community has all levels of programmers and managers, everyone 
is invited to participate, just drop me a line and lets talk about how 
you can contribute.  So email me, hans.kaspersetz at nyphp.org.  Lets 
set some reasonable goals and move this thing forward.

I wanted to survey what people think is the fair market rate per hour

friend in San Francisco and he said that it is not uncommon to be 
offered $30/hr for ASP.NET work even by large companies like Schwab, 
SBC, Intel, etc.  For some background, he is a very experience developer 
with 10 years under his belt.  So we are not talking entry level or 
junior developer here.  Is that about the same type of rates expected 
here in NYC?

I would say that sounds very low for NYC, especially for someone with 10
yrs under their belt. Salary.com confirms that for NYC for a "Web
Software Developer":
	http://tinyurl.com/as9qf
And also for SF:
	http://tinyurl.com/9l5rq
And it goes up for "Web Software Developer, Sr." in NYC:
	http://tinyurl.com/9y3sf
And is even higher in SF:
	http://tinyurl.com/9nxxo

Is the keyword in your statement "offered"?  Meaning, are they
low-balling developers with under market rates?  But possibly
negotiating up... as long as the developer is savvy enough?

Hmm.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [OT] any interest in a newbie installfest of WordPress
 plus in NY or NJ?
Message-ID: <11908-77152@sneakemail.com>

I always apreciated newbie installfests and so I am willing to set one up if there is interest.

WordPress is a hot blog software, written in PHP/MySQL. It is very flexible, and can be many things in addition to a standard blog. It is now at a very nice and relatively stable version 1.5.1.2 9 (as of today?) which I really like. 

Most of you out there are probably thinking "what's to install and configure? It's so simple!" and you are correct. But it's not that easy for those not actively working with all-things-php, and this is an installfest for those people.

To make it even more interesting, I will suggest that while there are literally THOUSANDS of themes and templates and plug-ins available (each one promoted as the best thing since Sliced Images), there are actually not that many that are "ready for prime time" on the latest WP1.5.x release. So there's value to participating even if you are so 133t you can program PHP using this kick-ass keyboard http://peripherals.engadget.com/entry/1234000577031787/

Add to that the WordPress docs are widely dispersed and wiki-based, and there's plenty of knowledge to share.

Anybody interested? Here's what I figure could happen at least once:

- bring your gear, meet at wifi friendly spot in NY or NJ
- have an editor, your own hosting account or use a temp one provided by (someone or some not-for-profit? Or we can NAT my T-mobile account and 0wn a Starbucks)
- we can intro to SVN to get and keep up with WP, or just grab the DL. I can demonstrate why you might consider the SVN nightlies... and if you don't use SVN this is an easy way to start (WP is a wide open SVN repo).
- there's many places to get themes and templates - I know a few good ones and few dead-ends
- WP is based on a controller called the WP Loop. Get an intro so you can start hacking it.
- The WP Codex is a vast knowledge base.. I have a set of bookmarks to start with
- search engine friendly? Pheh. We can fix that, too, or at least start on the path.

Let me know if you are interested, if you have ideas/preferences, or a place etc. Again I encourage those who have little experience but want to dig into WP etc cause it's really low key and low pressure to get started with WP. Of course if there are only uberstus, we could jump right to in-lining bbpress and MG2, or tying in some single sign-on for a multiblog or whatever.

I haven't trusted salary.com numbers since I dug this up some years ago. 
It's still on there with the same figures as 4 years ago.

"The median expected salary for a typical Surfer - Web in New York, NY is 
$42,010.

Surfer - Web
Visits multiple websites to gather information. Reviews and catalogues 
websites according to established guidelines. Requires a high school 
diploma with 0-2 years of experience in the field or in a related area. 
Has knowledge of commonly-used concepts, practices, and procedures within

to perform the functions of the job. Works under immediate supervision. 
Primary job functions do not typically require exercising independent 
judgment. Typically reports to a manager."

Such jobs exist aplenty.  That not bunk at all.  Think online "ambulance
chasers" or SE "beat cop" for example.

The salary not changing is curious, can't explain that...

So given the information, we have the median of ~$65/hr for a Sr. Web 
Software Developer.  This was determined with the following information.

50 work week per year for full time
40 hour work week
$96,727 for full time Sr Web Software Developer
35% increase in hourly rate for contractors

I guess that makes for a great discrepancy between what my friend was 
quoted ($30/hr) and the median going rate.  It just doesn't make sense.

I'd say the following factor in:

1. rates will often get lower as the # of hours increases
2. people will always try to low ball you. Just look at the adds on 
craigslist for Jr this and that, recent college grad, with 5 years 
experience. They'll use any excuse they can, promise you future work, 
promise you more after a trial period, promise you referrals, try to 
base a rate off another you had, etc.
3. depends on how you market yourself.
4. depends on how much you need the work.

You and John make a good point about that position describing market 
research, targetted data mining and copyright/SE policy enforcement.

I guess "web researcher" or "information analyst" would be a better name 
for what's intended by the salary.com description.

Interesting thread. I think that security is one area that even many 
of us PHP veterans could always learn more about.

I recently have had to do some research on these types of issues 
myself. I consider myself  to be pretty good with PHP, but security 
is a pretty complicated issue with so many issues to consider.

For example on the NYPHP site in "phundamentals" section there is the 
article on form spoofing. I have seen so many different schools of 
thought on this.

Thinking about that article I was wondering, why not just check the 
HTTP_REFERER to make sure the form is being submitted from server as 
opposed to someone storing it locally and editing vars?

Might not be too bad an idea for us to put together a security page 
with best practices, do's and don't etc. It would be a valuable 
resource for even the seasoned coders. Some of the best coders I know 
take security for granted.

Just my $.02 on the subject.

I don't mean to be rude, but if you really think checking HTTP_REFERER
is a good way to protect against this type of attack, you probably
shouldn't be working on a security "best practices" page.

This value is easily spoofed because an attacker can manually set the
HTTP header herself and the value is easily known. See
http://shiflett.org/archive/96.

I didn't say I was going to do it. I used the word "us" meaning group 
effort based on discussions we could/would have on list.

I did not profess to be a security expert and never would. :)

I was not aware that an env var such as that could be so easily 
spoofed. I was under the impression that was a variable generated by 
Apache /shrug

The link you sent is an interesting read. Thanks for the info.

The site in question wasn't escaping characters submitted by a user so 
a person could submit html code which manipulated the markup of the 
response page.

One question: Rasmus mentions that he can trick people into sending 
their user names and passwords. I'm assuming he meant he could do this 
with the hack he demonstrated. But if he goes to a website and does 
this, how does he have access to another person's user names and 
passwords? Isn't he only manipulating the response page which only he 
is seeing?

I'm guessing if he submits his "name" which contains html code, the 
name is stored in a database and retrieved by an administrator, 
javascript could be inserted which could grab cookie values (for 
example) from the administrator. Something similar could be done if the 
name is posted to a bulletin board or a similar web application.

Would there be any other vulnerabilities?

I think Rasmus' example was a cross-site scripting example, not stealing cookies. 

The faulty web page was coded to build a form based on incoming parameters in the GET string.  So Rasmus ADDED encoded stuff to that GET string, with a script from Rasmus' own website somewhere else. When the faulty page parsed the incoming GET it also followed Rasmus' added instructions, which loaded javascript from another webserver somewhere else. 

That other-site script could be a fake login that collects usernames/passwords. Easier than hacking cookies.

is a good way to protect against this type of attack, you probably
shouldn't be working on a security "best practices" page.
<

Adam,

Working on, or do you mean leading/editing? 

If you don't know much about security, but know/like PHP, and are interested in this stuff, then I would think you are a good candidate to WORK ON such a best practices page. What a great way to learn, no?

I agree about leading and editing completely. That's why we need guys like you and Chris, and apreciate your books.

I guess my biggest question is, does this type of hack depend on the 
user's information being stored in a database and displayed to other 
users? Or is there another kind of vulnerability?

Actually, everything I know about security I learned from Chris. I'm a
follower here.

I do agree that working on something is usually the best way to
learn. However, with security, I worry that unless there a real expert
at the helm, you can end up producing an guide that misleads people
into believing their sites are secure, but are really filled with
holes. That's even worse than no guide at all.

I also wanted to point out that these issues are somewhat subtle, and
it's easy to "know" something is secure, when it's really not at all.

This whole security issue has kicked some of my mental gears in motion.
What do you think if there was some sort of "security seal of approval" 
applied to scripts in a code archive? I think having a library of secure 
code bits would be invaluable to all php programmers. Of course, using 
the scripts would not guarantee security to the system as a whole, but 
it would definitely reduce the amount of problems.. and also save a lot 
of wheel reinvention which, I'm sure, we are all guilty of from time to 
time.

I haven't kept up with that thread (nor this one), but the most common 
XSS attacks are those that steal cookies. In fact, this is why there is 
a recommendation for HTTP-only cookies - this would let developers 
essentially hide these cookies from document.cookie.

Maybe that helps clarify something? :-)

I agree completely. A good example is this blog entry:

http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=481&entry=75480

Here, Zeev points out that $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] can be manipulated by 
the Host header under certain circumstances. Rasmus disputes Zeev's 
claim, asserting that $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] is not tainted.

In this case, I believe Zeev is the one who is correct, but the point is 
that we have two of the top authorities on PHP, and one of them is 
incorrectly identifying the origin of a particular variable.

If these guys have trouble with this stuff, what hope is there for the 
rest of us? :-)

It's a good idea but hard to achieve in practice. This requires that the 
code be audited and approved by a person or group of people qualified to 
do so. What criteria must one meet to be qualified to make such a 
judgment? Even assuming that a qualified group existed, how do they 
choose which code to audit? There is a lot of PHP code out there, and 
auditing code takes a very long time.

While not code, the PHPSC has tried to do this sort of thing with online 
resources, linking to resources that we feel can help security-conscious 
PHP developers (many resources are counter-productive, as Adam warned 
against). The result of this is a small library of links:

http://phpsec.org/library/

It's nothing earth-shattering, but you can at least feel a bit more 
comfortable knowing that a few people reviewed each of these resources 
and believe that there is something useful there.

I wonder which security professional would want her name on software as a "seal of approval"  anyway. Imagine the consequences if, despite code passing all "best practice" checks, such "aproved" code was hacked with high profile consequences?

HTMLDOC is a great app but it could be many things. Did your HTML  
change? Is the HTML for the PDF generated dynamically? If so, perhaps  
someone entered a strange character or something else that is  
creating the bad PDF. Have you checked the HTMLDOC forums?

http://htmldoc.org/

Does it generate some pages correctly and not others? I usually have  
to work it down until I can find a hanging white space or stray tag  
that is problematic. Does the PDF open in any other reader? The  
encryption might be causing an issue, are you using that? Best bet is  
to try to recreate the error in a controlled environment, ie. simple  
HTML.

Good Luck

You may be referring to the XUL presentation at May's Meeting:

http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/index.php

I don't know of any groups dedicated to this type of technology, but NYPHP does have a front-end SIG, which specializes in working with the combination of client and server side languages (like XUL, AJAX, etc).

I see that HTML doc doesn't support CSS, but it is pending.

Are there any HTML to PDF packages that do that you would recommend?  I will
be in need of something like this by the end of the month, just wanted to
see if anyone had any solutions for it. I've used PDFlib and ezPDF before,
but this time I have the need to take an HTML page (which is dynamically
created and uses CSS) and produce it as a PDF.

Any thoughts?

Message-ID: <429C829F.9010308@n0p.net>

Reading some interesting articles on http://phppatterns.com/ I came
across the following some code that has me scratching my head...

Can anyone explain why the code below works!? (in php4 and php5)  And is
this simply an undocumented _side effect_, or is it intentional (from
the php developers)?

1) Per the php manual, you can't use $this in static functions.
2) How is the SomeClass property $errorMsg accessed within the Debug class?

Example code from
<http://www.phppatterns.com/index.php/article/articleview/15/1/1/>


<?php
class Debug {
    function display () {
        echo ($this->errorMsg);
    }
}

class SomeClass {
    var $errorMsg='This is an error message';
    function someFunction () {
        if ( DEBUG == 1 ) {
            Debug::display();
        }
    }
}

define ('DEBUG',1);
$someClass= &new SomeClass;
$someClass->someFunction(); // Outputs: "This is an error message"
?>


Thanks,
Flavio

Flavio,

This seems to me like a side effect of the mechanism used to allow 
directly calling methods defined in a superclass from a subclass.

eg:

class mysuper
{
   var $name = 'mysuper';
   function hello()
   {
     echo 'hello, I am '. $this->name;
   }
}

class mysub extends mysuper
{
   var $name = 'mysub';
   function hello()
   {
     parent::hello();
     echo ' testing';
   }
}

$mysub =& new mysub();
$mysub->hello();

The $this reference in mysuper::hello() should reference the $mysub 
object, which it does.  I would guess that the behavior you're seeing is 
that same mechanism in effect.

Thanks for you answer Dan.

I can grasp your example better because of the extends keyword.  It just
seems strange to me to be able to access the properties of a class  via
the $this operator within a totally separate class that has no
_relationship_.


After reading the comments in the aforementioned article, there is a bit
of an explanation.  It still just doesn't seem _right_ to me.

<snip>
The reason why it works is because we call the method display() in the
debug class without instantiating Debug as an object.
The $this variable now refers to the SomeClass object, not an instance
of the Debug object.
</snip>

This suggests that whenever you call a function/static method, the
current class is being passed to that function (and may be accessed via
the $this keyword)...

Hmm, sounds like I need to do some testing with private variables...

Thanks,
Flavio

Thanks for the great input.  I'm really stumped.  The pages are dynamically
generated.  If I simply save that as HTML and then run it through HTMLDOC;
no problem.  When I run it, generated on the fly, the page throws an error.
Even stranger, the page prints correctly with other data (HTML generated
from a mysql db) and even display correctly via HTMLDOC through another
(similar) application using the same database.

Does anyone know if there is an error log file in Acrobat?  The debug
message is pretty weak, ""the file is damaged and could not be repaired"

HTMLDOC is a great app but it could be many things. Did your HTML  
change? Is the HTML for the PDF generated dynamically? If so, perhaps  
someone entered a strange character or something else that is  
creating the bad PDF. Have you checked the HTMLDOC forums?

http://htmldoc.org/

Does it generate some pages correctly and not others? I usually have  
to work it down until I can find a hanging white space or stray tag  
that is problematic. Does the PDF open in any other reader? The  
encryption might be causing an issue, are you using that? Best bet is  
to try to recreate the error in a controlled environment, ie. simple  
HTML.

Good Luck

Although I suppose it is officially undocumented, it's been fairly well known.  Regardless of whether people think it's right or not, it was left in PHP 5 because quite a bit of OO code depends on it.

While probably not good OO practice, I liked the functionality.  Although I don't use it anymore, I used to make extensive use of it as a multi-inheritance mechanism.  Pretty handy, although for the wrong reasons :)

Well, after some quick tests utilizing the newer php5 OO syntax:

1) declaring Debug::display() as static.
  Fatal error: Using $this when not in object context...

2) making SomeClass::errorMsg a private property.
  Fatal error: Cannot access private property SomeClass::$errorMsg

OK, This is more of what I was expecting.

Thanks guys for the responses.

Thanks

Are you saving saving the PDF file on the server then sending it to

If you save what is generated my HTMLDOC on your local machine then

Don't save on the server.  Will try saving the file and then opening it.  As
I recall, I need to adjust Acrobat for this.

Hah!  We're getting closer.  Saved the file to disk (locally) first and then
opened it without a problem.  Any thoughts?

Really appreciate all the help.  Had I asked sooner, I might have gotten
more sleep last night.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Making an array from a list item?
Message-ID: <20050531164812.GE3104@leitz>

Trying to read code from last year. *sigh* At least it isn't as difficult as perl...

Looking through the archives I don't think I've asked this before. If there is a better way, and I'd not be surprised, feel free to suggest it.  ;)

My project is a character sheet for a game. Each character has a different set of skills, and each skill has a sub-skill called a "knack". A character can have a rank of 0-5 in a knack. "0" means they don't have that knack. Skills are not ranked; you just have it or not. For example, a character might have the Skill "Hunter" and have the knacks "Fishing (2)", "Stealth (2)", and "Tracking (1)". A character may or may not have all the knacks in a skill. Some knacks are in more than one skill.

Each Skill and Knack has a unique short name like "hntr", "fshng", and "stlth". I've been using the short name as array keys. The character sheet pulls the list of skills that character has and then looks up what knacks are in that skill. It then writes the Skill header, lists each knack and the rank the character has in that knack. 

The current problem is that I'm using an included file that manually sets the array $htnr to have the knacks "fshg", "stlth", etc. I'd rather, if possible, have the array built from a database pull. I'm failing because I don't know how to iterate through a list and make the list item an array, and then populate the array with the knacks.

Line from the included file:

$hntr = array( "ambsh", "anmltn", "fshg", "sknng", "stlth", "srvl", "trkng", "trlsgns", "trps"  );


So far the code looks like this:


foreach ( $skills As $s ) {
        $a = $s;
        $s = array ();
        $$s[0] = $a;
        echo "<p>s[0] is $s[0]!   ";
        $skill_knack_query = "select knackID from characters.skill_knacks where skillID='$a'";
        $skill_knack_result = mysql_query("$skill_knack_query", $link_id);
        // echo "skill_knack_result is $skill_knack_result \n";
        while($skill_knack_data = mysql_fetch_array($skill_knack_result)) {
        //      echo "hello $skill_knack_data";
                echo " <p> hello $skill_knack_data[knackID]";
                array_push($s , $skill_knack_data["$knackID"] );
                }
                echo " <p> s[0] is $s[0]  ";
}

If I comment out the included file and try the above code it gives output like this:

s[0] is ! 
hello ambsh hello anmltn hello fshg hello sknng hello stlth hello srvl hello trkng hello trlsgns hello trps 
s[0] is

So the "echo $skill_knack_data[knackID]" line shows the short name is being gotten, I've just not gotten it onto the array. If I change the bottom "s[0] is $s[0] to higher number it still shows nothing in the array.

It seems easiest to build the array to match the included file, but there may be a better, easier way.

Thoughts? Suggestions? Crude comments?

ciao!

leam

Leam,

how is your database structure setup i mean what is it you want a single 
dimensional array or a 2 dimensional array?

i see you have this currently

$hntr = array( "ambsh", "anmltn", "fshg", "sknng", "stlth", "srvl", "trkng", 
"trlsgns", "trps" );

are the values stored in the db and you just want them pulled into an array?

are each of the values above going to be an array itself?

If you create the PDF on the server then pass it to the browser it  
may work better. I am not sure of heavy load on a thing like this but  
it has worked for me.

     Have HTMLDOC output the file to the server. Then open that and  
feed it back to the browser.

                 $out_pdf=fopen($file_out,'rb');
                 $fisz = filesize($file_out);

                 # Write the content type to the client...
                 header("Cache-Control: ");// leave blank to avoid IE  
errors
                 header("Pragma: ");// leave blank to avoid IE errors
                 header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
                 header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename= 
\"my_pdf.pdf\"");
                 header("Content-length: ".(string)($fisz));
                 flush();

                 fpassthru($out_pdf);
                 fclose($out_pdf);

                 exit;


     Remember to create the file and set the permissions so the  
webserver can write to it. Also you may want to delete the HTML and  
PDF after generation depending on security issues.

     Good Luck

Try:

$output = array();

$query = 'select skillID,knackID from characters.skill_knacks';
$result = mysql_query($query,$link_id);

while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
   if (empty($output[$row['skillID']])) {
     $output[$row['skillID']] = array();
   }
   $output[$row['skillID']][] = $row['knackID'];
}

print_r($output);

The line $hntr is in a text file that is included. I'd like to create an array $hntr from, for example, list item $skills[4] which is hntr. 

Once $hntr is an array the elements are not going to become arrays. But the elements are keys for other arrays.

What I'd like to do is build the array $htnr from a database, not a text file.

Does that make more sense? Neither brain cell is particularly energetic at the moment, sorry. I think it's time for a couple hours break and then back to it.

ciao!

not exactly clear what you want your array to look like at the end,
but using the following style should let u have better control over  
the keys and values of your array - but again your email wasnt too  
clear on what end you are trying to achieve

while (list($key,$value) = each($hntr))       {
          $skill_knack_query = "select knackID from  
characters.skill_knacks where skillID='".$v."'";
         $skill_knack_result = mysql_query("$skill_knack_query",  
$link_id);
         ..
}

Some of us write for both, so you can take your pick - otherwise we
are biased ;-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Protected Constructor and Extended Classes
Message-ID: <429CA7E6.6070801@crisscott.com>

Hello,

I have a question about constructor visibility in extended classes. Take 
a look at this example:

<?php
class Goo {

   public $stuff = '';

   // Note the protected constructor.
   protected function __construct($stuff)
   {
     $this->stuff = $stuff;
   }

   public function printStuff()
   {
     echo $this->stuff . "\n";
   }
}

class Foo extends Goo {

   public static function getGoo($stuff)
   {
     return new Goo($stuff);
   }
}

$goo = Foo::getGoo('test stuff');
$goo->printStuff();

// This throws a fatal error as I would expect.
//$goo2 = new Goo('goo too');
?>

The subclass is allowed to call new Goo() even though the constructor is 
declared protected. I understand that the constructor is visible to the 
subclass and what not but something just seems off about this. I would 
expect $this->__construct() to work fine but that has a whole different 
effect. In my understanding the new operator is a public action even if 
it is called within an extended class. Is this behavior expected? I want 
to take advantage of this, but if it is going to be changed in a future 
release I can't really depend on it.

Thanks,
