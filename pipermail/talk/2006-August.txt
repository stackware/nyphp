Kenneth, you're not reading what I'm saying. :)  Read the following 
paragraph again:

What I'm saying is anyone can set up their very own code repository on 
their very own servers and put whatever they want in it.

I am reading what you are saying.  That's why I asked for 
clarification.  An ideal would be to be able to distribute packages to 
any PHP user via the common PEAR repository (instead of another server, 
mine, that they'd have to go looking for) without having to buy into the 
entire PEAR philosophy of life.

Sounds like we can't do that.  Glad I asked though.

I'm not claiming to be a communist that thrives on lack of choice, but I
actually find this abundance of frameworks to be one of the "problems"
with PHP. Decision making is not my strong suite, so I find it
challenging "to just pick one" fearing the repetitive learning curve as
I stumble along in search of the perfect framework.

So I have probably done what so many others have done -- cobble together
pieces of PEAR, Smarty, etc. It's that awful devil I know syndrome.

AMFPHP, you could use a Flash front end... that could grab a folder, then
zip it then pass it with php as a file, then unzip it.

It's not a PHP thing as much as a browser thing. You can imagine why
scriptable file uploads aren't allowed by default for security.
With the demo below you have to approve the applet for security.
Also note that even the demo you mention is handled via PHP ...

There is a firefox specific solution at
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2190/

Ajax example for Firefox that might get you started

This resembles the situation of another dev system that was popular 
about 10 years ago, when LAN and C/S were still king.  There were many 
frameworks.  Eventually it settled down to about 4, each of which 
exemplified a certain approach.

People tended to pick the framework based on which framework fit their 
approach to things.

Your desire above conflicts with Cliff's desire below:

This line of reasoning is why the PEAR repository isn't open to every 
submission.  The goal is to have one pacakge for a given task and does 
that task really well.  Of course, that's a goal and isn't always 
achieved. :)

Well, you kind of have to see me smiling when I say this, so you get my 
expression of mild sarcasm, at which point I make a sound like a 
newscast "special announcement" jingle and say "Breaking news: 
programmers disagree on best approach, what is to become of us?"

The idea behind PEAR is to have the One True Implementation of each 
idea.  When that is possible, great.  But that tends to be only possible 
on deterministic projects where the need for judgement is greatly 
reduced.  As soon as there are two legitimate ways to do something, it 
breaks down.  I'm not arguing Pear should be changed, just that PEAR's 
limitations are built into its mission, as is true with all such projects. 

But it need not be so, much can be learned here from gentoo.

Cheers,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] more on document.getElementById("Div" + count)
Message-ID: <44D0CE68.7060801@fdcx.net>

Thanks for the responses so far with this issue.

Both Ed and Rob had some ideas that I've pursued but still could not 
find anything that would cause this error based on their recommendations.

Rob was correct in that I'm supplying a namee Div whose style is set to 
style.display='none' and I am then wishing to make it visible.

And yes, I am the one naming the Divs with the simple and required 
convention of Div1, Div2, Div3, etc.  However, in this case there is 
only ONE Div named Div1.

The js module failing can be downloaded/viewed from > 
http://www.openwebware.com/products/openpopups/download.shtml
and it is FREE so there's no worry.  I've queried the author who claims 
that because he cannot duplicate the error I am receiving he cannot 
diagnose it.  OK - then perhaps someone else might be able to.  But I 
know that I seemingly cannot.

If Ed, Rob or anyone is willing to take a look, it will be significantly 
appreciated.

The module is loaded with a <script src=... in the header of my output 
and referenced first by <body onload=... to close the area then 
onClick=... when "asked" to actually display the window/box.

Hope someone can make some sense of this.

Thank you,

Bob

I downloaded the script and tried out a test page.  I couldn't duplicate 
the problem either with one div named Div1.

Can you send a stripped down html page that still gives you the error? 
I think that's the only way to solve this.  Have you tested with more 
than one browser?  Which browser are you using that gives the error?

Thanks,
Rob

Or the situation 5 years ago when you had to choose between 50
different Content Management Systems.

Also now, you get to make TWO choices: which PHP framework, coupled
with which AJAX framework? At least thanks to PDO you don't have to
choose which database to use any more... oh wait, you still do.

I guess being a developer has always been about making these kinds of
choices. And don't forget the hacker's way: the mere fact that all of
these frameworks exist means that it must be pretty easy to create
your own...

Did not look at your actual script, but... 

Certain scripts actually need to be loaded just before the closing body tag
like so, 
so that for sure all the elements needed are already available on the page.

<script></script>
</body>

Alternatively, sometimes you may also need to put your first default call to
the script functions in the same 
Place, like so:


<script>
funtion_call();
</script>
</body>

Thanks for the responses so far with this issue.

Both Ed and Rob had some ideas that I've pursued but still could not

Rob was correct in that I'm supplying a namee Div whose style is set to 
style.display='none' and I am then wishing to make it visible.

And yes, I am the one naming the Divs with the simple and required

Bob,

I haven't peeped the JS source, but in general, it's good form to test if
your objects and properties exist before referencing them.

For example, the error you're receiving basically says the element you're
trying to access isn't there.  This can be solved by simply checking for it:

var myElement=document.getElementById("Div" + count);
if(myElement) {
    // do something with, to or on myElement
}

It's good do this sorta thing in any language, but even more so in JS where
the syntax is (still) browser-dependant (despite being more DOM-oriented
these days).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SQL injection and stripslashes
Message-ID: <44D1E240.8070104@holyblasphemy.org>

Hi,

I just read the PHundamentals article on storing and retrieving data 
from a database. Near the bottom, it says that if I follow the authors' 
best practice recommendations then I won't need to use stripslashes. I 
actually found that page by following a link from Chris Shiflett's 
Security Corner page, in which, when asked how to reverse 
mysql_real_escape_string, he wrote, "[Y]ou should never have to reverse 
that. If you do, it means you've done something wrong." So, I must be 
doing something wrong...

Say I want to store a user's name in my database and their name contains 
an apostrophe, when I escape that string a backslash will be inserted 
before the apostrophe. Later, I need to pull that name out of the 
database for display (or use elsewhere in the script or something.) How 
do I get rid of the backslash without using stripslashes or something 
similar?

I'd be very grateful for any help.

The backslash is not stored in the database.  It tells the database that 
the apostrophe (technically: single-quote) is not an endquote, and that 
the single-quote is part of the column's value.  The database discards 
the backslash and stores the single-quote as part of the value.  When 
you retrieve it, you get the value without the backslash.

But when you send it back to the database, you must escape the string 
again.  All writes to the db must do that.

I have found that when I use the function mysql_real_escape_string() 
instead of addslashes() the backslash is not stored in the database. 
I also have magic_quotes_runtime disabled in php.ini

Ah, thanks. I thought that only applied if I was using the same 
delimiter around the string (i.e. it would work with 'it\'s fine' but 
not with "it\'s fine") but I was wrong, that works for both. I'm sure 
I've ended up with strings from databases with annoying backslashes in 
them before but that must have been on a server with magic quotes turned 
on or something.

Thank you very much for clearing that up for me.

Greetings,

I'm storing sensitive information in a MySQL db and will need to read it 
at some point so I can't do a one way encrypt like md5().

Following Chris's recommendation of mcrypt(), I ran 
mcrypt_list_algorithms() and it appears that mcrypt is not available to 
me on my server.

Are there any other functions/classes that folks would recommend that 
would allow me to encrypt and decrypt a string?

Thanks,

The openssl extension has some encryption functions:

The comments on that page have good examples on how to use it.

I'm pretty positive PEAR has Encryption classes too, but I haven't used 
them.

More specifically, something like:

/usr/home/username/.gnupg -ear them at example.org');

... but it bears pointing out that *decrypting* securely through a web

I think there's a recipe that's on point in the venerable (but alas, now
rather dated) "PHP Cookbook" (Sklar & Trachtenberg).

Hello,

Guys i know this is off-topic but i may be looking to move to queens and
have a job in NYC.  The salary is 65-80k DOE

i am wondering if this is enough to support a family on.  I checked into
some apartments and they range from $1200 - $5000 / mo depending on what you
get.

I know at 65k i could afford a 3br at no more than 2000  mo however what i
wish to know is would the remainder be enough to live on in NYC.

that would leave about $1629, that is basing it on a monthly salary and
witholding 33% for taxes.

I am not sure what gas, registration, vehicle taxes etc. are.

Could some here that live in NYC please give some advice.

Thanks,

I don't have a car, so I'm not sure about that aspect, but from my
experience so far, housing is the only abnormally expensive thing in New
York. I think food and entertainment here is a good value (slightly
better and slightly more expensive than elsewhere).

Chris,

I appreciate your feedback, i doubt we would drive that often, maybe the
family would take the car out for the day and go to ellis island, yada
yada.  The normal touristy things until they were there for a while :D

so do you think that salary would work for my family?  I would be the only
one working as she is pregnant and with 2 kids and one on the way daycare
would probably cost more than she would get from working.

Thanks,

I live in Jersey City and support a wife and a toddler. My guess is, yes,
it's probably possible -- people do it, I believe -- but it's going to be
pretty close to the ground.

I agree with Chris - it's really primarily about rent.  Commuting is
cheap, there are large groceries in both Queens and Brooklyn that'll let
you get reasonable deals on food and supplies (I love CostCo!).  If,
after rent, you can support yourself where you are now, you should be
able to do it in Queens as well.  That salary seems tight to me, but if
you're far enough out in Queens it's definitely doable.
 
Nicholas

Guys,

I appreciate the feedback, having never spent much time in NY i was unsure
about the cost of living, i think i am going to go to the interview, and
start looking around a bit more for housing.  Is it hard to get an apartment
down there?  I know most want references and i probably couldnt get a
reference from my landlord of 3 years now because i would be breaking a
lease to move.  There are also other issues going on between him and i.

Thanks,

I grew up (33 years) one mile from the George Washington Bridge and worked  
in downtown Manhattan for over 10 years.  65k-80k is VERY difficult to  support 
a family on in any area of NYC.  Especially if you ever hope to  actually buy 
a house.  (average studio condo in queens is close to  $200k - 400-600 sq. 
ft. max - 3 bedroom condo/house - furgetaboutit!)  If you spend every last penny 
on rent and surviving... how will you ever  afford to save for a down 
payment?  And in the NYC area 10-20% is a  requirement, not an option to buy a house. 
 Unless your wife was working  full-time too, I would VERY carefully 
reconsider that move.
 
Check out Fortune/Money upcoming cities, and do research.  There are  plenty 
of cities that desperately need good PHP programmers and don't have the  high 
cost of living....  I left NYC in December of 2005 for the north west,  found 
TONS of work, and a much better life, and a 4 bedroom 2 bath house on .5  acre 
for $150k - great schools, great city, etc.
 
I'd think, think, think about it.
 
Lee

So, you'll probably need a garage for that car to take out.  A couple
of years ago we paid $120 per month for that in Flushing.  Of course,
you could always hunt for a spot and move your car every morning, but
that sucks.

My son goes to daycare twice a week.  I researched a bunch of places,
and the average was about $60 per day (that would be per child). Of
course, there were plenty of higher-end places, and plenty of private
parties (BE CAREFUL) who may do it for less.  That price was for Long
Island, though, so maybe figure $10 more for the city (although I
admit I don't know).

You also can't forget such small things as *saving*.  If you don't
have any money left over at the end of the month, you're just treading
water.

I don't live in the city (LIPHP!), but I think you would have a hard
time making that work on Long Island.

Good Luck!

I agree with Lee.

One should really think carefully about moving to New York. But please
don't get me wrong. New York is a wonderful city, and I love it. But I
think it's difficult to leave her with family and especially when you have
children.

Yet it's a whole different story if you are single :))) Then New York
rocks and roll.

THe job is actually in TImes Square, and i could live on the outskirts such
as Jersey City, i was recommended Queens by someone local and a gentleman
from the company also lives there.

Queens is not dead set in our minds :)

I dont mind up to 45min commute every day to and from.

Hi Joe,

 

I'm from the New York area - grew up in Queens (Howard Beach) and Jersey -
went to college in Manhattan - I now live 50 miles north of the city - I
love it here and for now would not live anywhere else - 

 

As someone else mentioned the big issue is cost of housing and rentals too
are high. It is easy to find an apartment but you really have to spend time
and look around. The neighborhoods in all of the NYC boroughs are very
diverse and they change from block to block. Plan on spending a good few
weeks touring and talking to people on the streets especially local business
people (cleaners, florists, restaurant owners, etc) they will give you good
info. Be sure to check out the neighborhoods both daytime and evening (they
can be much different). Before you rent, call the local police precinct and
ask them what they think of the neighborhood, they know best and most of the
cops are pretty cool and will be glad to offer you their opinion.

 

As to keeping a car in the city, make sure you have parking, parking on the
streets sucks, and you can really mount up on the parking tickets. I would
not limit yourself to Queens, there are some really nice neighborhoods in
Brooklyn these days. Manhattan would be the best but the rents are crazy.

 

Make sure you check out what schools your kids would go to, unless you plan
on sending them to private school. A lot of the city public schools are
great, especially if you kids are good students, they offer amazing
specialty schools but if you kids are just average students and they are in
the "wrong" school you may not be too happy.

 

Btw - I hope you do not plan on driving to Ellis Island, unless your car
floats :-)

 

 

Eric

I grew up in Ridgefield, NJ, not 3 miles from Jersey CIty - map quest  it.  
 
THE minium you will pay for rent for a 3 bedroom in Jersey City is  $2,000.
 
Commute will cost - $2 each way on path or $8 each way on ferry
Subway will cost - $1 each way....
 
$6 a day min just to commute and how are you going to get from the  apartment 
to the path or ferry?  NO WHERE TO PARK ANYWHERE UNLESS YOU PAY  $7-$10 a day.

Agree, I'm in North Bergen, NJ with a wife toddler, and a single income.
Its doable. 
The commute for me is 45 min door to door to SOHO.  

I don't want to start a flame war here, but IMHO it seems that you get
more for your money in NJ especially if you go north into Bergenfield
county.

Dunno how far you want to commute, thats up to you. Public Trans is
great here, just look at the train/bus/path/subway lines when you are
looking at places to live and plan accordingly.

For that salary, just say no. If you can add $20k to it, yeah, you'll
get by. But, at that pay scale you'll slowly starve to death.

This isn't a great idea as you're echoing out plaintext to the shell, a
more secure approach is to launch gpg with popen and redirect the
encrypted output to a temporary file, then feed in the plaintext using
fwrite.

Even better is to use proc_open to open both standard in and standard
out, so nothing is sent directly to the shell or written to disk.

Of course, the best approach is still to use the mcrypt or openssl
functions if they're available.

As stated before, key management in a web environment is still the
trickiest aspect of this whole issue, as anyone with access to the
encrypted data will usually also end up gaining access to the key.

I'll also note that i have 6 years exp with php and mysql.  I will admit i
am not the greatest with mysql i never got into indexing or optimizing the
database, i can however complete complex queries with joins etc. i have yet
to look into sub-queries (too much) or stored procedures.  And my knowledge
of css / js are not there at all :)

Would this salary be what i should expect?

I grew up on LI , worked in NYC commuting from LI and
then moved to NJ, still commuting to NYC.

Nutley (in Essex county) is a nice neighborhood with
lots of public transportation. It's about 10 miles
from the city and the bus (i used to take the decamp
bus) right into penn station. That is close enough to
walk to TS.

So, Essex county is a good commutable area.

Also, Suffern in NY (above the top of NJ) and parts of
PA have buses that go into NYC also. You can get
better deals in those areas to live. 

It is really going to come down to how far / long you
want to commute.

Just more info to think about.

I'd second this opinion.  65k for a family of 5 is just enough $ in NYC
and the surronding area.  80k is better, but still not enough IMHO.

If the 65k-80k is the only income, with 3 kids I'd think very, very, very
hard.  No matter what others have said: food, transportation,
entertainment and god forbid you need day care will eat the 16 hundred and
change for breakfast!

When we first moved here about 7 years ago more than one realtor laughed
when we told them our income [at the time 72k].

I love NY!

I would not mind a 45min commute each way, just not sure if the cost of
living would benefit the cost of commute each day ;)  I would not want to
drive but take a bus or train into the city.

It'd be tough on $65K, anywhere within commuting distanct of NYC, unless you
found a sweet deal on rent. In many neighborhoods you can just park on the
street for free, so that isn't necessarily a required expense.

As far as raising a family in NYC. I wouldn't want to raise a family
anywhere else. I hated growing up in the burbs; I had very little exposure
to different cultures/people/work/food/you name it. Here you get it all, and
overall NYC is one of the safest cities in the world.

Just curious.... do you have kids?  do you make a lot more than  65k-80k?  Do 
you own/rent?  I will admit that I was quite spoiled  living in NJ right next 
to the GWB and had the best of both worlds... your  opinion is interesting, 
and worthy of note.

I guess the key question would be, how long to you plan on making 65K for?
If you are ambitious and plan on advancing your career then the
opportunities are endless. I do not think anyone can argue that point. If
you want to make 65-75K for the rest of your life and do not want to advance
your opportunities then NYC can be an expensive place to live and I would
recommend not moving here. But, if you are good at what you do, you will
find work making more then 65K, there are not many cities in the world with
the Job opportunities that NY / NJ / CT offer. Don't let the nay sayers get
you down (there are too many of them).

 

BUT - it is expensive - housing taxes (NY is one of the highest taxed states
in the country, not to mention NYC will tax you too) but with the high taxes
come lots of perks - great schools, the arts, sports teams, public
transportation, great state universities, etc. If it was for the welfare it
would be Utopia :-)

I would defenatly not want to make 65-70k for the rest of my life.  I am
currently making 45k working for a startup in ca (working from home) however
it's a startup.  I have had no other real php job aside from starting my own
company. Codebowl Solutions, Inc.

Once in NYC i would probably have that job for a year or 2 and then move up
to a better paying job. Maybe sooner.

Anyone know of a job in NYC you can get without a degree that pays more than
65-80k/yr?

I have no real educational background except for books, i have a shelf of
about 50 books, of which 1/2 i have read.

Thanks,

IMHO, you've go to balance cost of living with length of drive.  I work
in DC.  But because I chose to move to the Eastern Shore of Maryland
(past Annapolis and over the Chesapeake Bridge), I have a much better
cost of living there.   Plus, I live where others vacation!  The
downside:  1.5 hour drives each way (or a 2.25 hour bus/subway/bus
commute).

 

Figure out what you are worth, how much time you can be away from the
family each day, what amount of telecommuting is allowed with the
position, and if you can get anything done WHILE you commute (by train
or bus).  For example, if you can telecommute one day a week (20%), and
a 1.5 hour commute allows for an hour of solid work on the laptop each
way, the extra distance might buy you a better cost of living farther
out.

 

The last time I took the Acela Express (The high speed Amtrak from DC to
Boston), I saw NYC commuters getting on in Wilmington Del., and Philly
to go to downtown Gotham.  Leave Wilmington DE and arrive in downtown
NYC 90 minutes later.  That's extreme.... But it would work.

 

Too extreme?

I would not mind a 45min commute each way, just not sure if the cost of
living would benefit the cost of commute each day ;)  I would not want
to drive but take a bus or train into the city.

Joseph,

Look into the different salary sites and then pick a number and play
ball. If they want you they will negotiate.  It's all about selling
yourself and being confidant in your capabilities., focus on your years
of experience and certifications rather than your lack of education.

If you start low you will stay low, it's easier to ask for 20k more up
front rather than a 15k raise two years later.   

I wouldn't personally think of accept anything less than 85.

Guys,

I really appreciate your feedback and with my exp in php i think i would
have to ask them for the 80k, along with being zend certified (not sure how
much it helps)  but the cost of living would be where i would require the
salary.

Thanks again and any more feedback will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Insurance is very expensive in NYC? I think we're second on the list
behind New Jersey. gas prices are outrageous.

Also you are spending 2,000 on a 3 bedroom does that include G&E.
Honestly with 65K you would be living awfully tight supporting a
family.

Honestly i dont mind it here in VT, i hate working running my own company as
i never know when work will come in, however i am making a pretty decent
salary for a CA startup that is paying me to work from home.  They are
launching monday however i would like to go where there is more to do, where
my kids can experience several different cultures, etc.  But i think you
guys are right, in order to even think about the move i would have to make
atleast 80k/yr.

Thanks for all the thoughtfull input and if the employer is interested maybe
i can setup the interview to fall on the day (or day before) an NYPHP
meeting and catch up with you guys.  That's another perk about moving to the
city i would get to attend the meetings :D

I'm in the Los Angeles area, so this isn't a completely accurate number, 
but based on your experience level and knowledge, $50-68k would be the 
salary you should probably expect.  I'd imagine though, that in NY your 
expectations could be somewhat higher?  I would hesitate supporting a 
family on that kind of income though...  What about looking for other 
companies in that area?  Just throw your resume out to a few companies 
around there and you could probably find something decent.

On a side note though, spend a couple hours on MySQL indexing / 
optimization :p  It will serve you well.

Rick,

Yea i have books on the topic but workign for a startup doesnt give much
time to read lol.

I put in about 12 hours a day then the family wants me, recently i have been
doing 16 hour days because we are close to launch.  One of these days i will
get time ;(

I figure if i can get a job working 8-9 hours that would leave me about 2-3
hours of time i could use for reading every day.

Thanks,

Yeah I understand the time issues... was my case for a while at my old 
company.  I actually work real 8-ish hour days now though for the first 
time in my life -- it's strange (I just started a new job).

Well it all depends on your lifestyle, My wife does not work, have a small1 year 
old child and I make almost double of what you specified, I am system admin and 
I love it. I do live outside of the city, in queens right by the ocean, great 
place. rents are around $1000 and they go up. Nothing luxury about those 
locations but verizon does offer FiOS internet service which 30mbit downstream 
and 5mbit upstream (which I do love. We have no money left after we spend it all 
every month, but as I said it all depends on your spending limit and habbits. I 
am moving to CT where it will cost me more, got a job which pasy a bit more 
thatn current job and I am in the same boat as you trying to figure all of this 
out. I did commute to work by car, have SUV and it does cost me $60 per 4 day 
trip back and forth for Gas, insurance I pay $2200  ayear and so on. Depending 
on the medical plan I had to pay extra $6000 almost last year when my baby was 
born, for hospital visits and all the other crap, so I thoght that I had great 
insurance and everthing but after all I guess it was not...

By the way, are there any good Solaris System admins in here on the list? I need 
one to fill in my spot, I can direct you to the proper place if you good and you 
can make pretty good money in here...

I'll second all of that.  I spent half my childhood in the city and half
in the suburbs and grew to hate the suburbs.  I still do.  I moved
myself - and my kids - into the city as soon as I could, and I haven't
regretted it for a second.  We're 2 blocks from a park, walking distance
from a museum, a zoo, a lake... (we're in Brooklyn) plus a simple subway
ride away from everything else the city has to offer.  I love it here,
and they love being here.  Having said that, the suburbs do tend to be
cheaper.
 
When I first started out I had a family of 3 and managed to support us
on $40k - we lived in NJ, rent was cheap, and the commute was long.  It
was doable, if painfully threadbare at times.  $65k is tight, but you
can do it.  I'd recommend more for a family of 5 - a few people have
said $80k and I'd concur - but it's definitely doable.  It may not be
entirely comfortable.
 
Nicholas

	It'd be tough on $65K, anywhere within commuting distanct of
NYC, unless you found a sweet deal on rent. In many neighborhoods you
can just park on the street for free, so that isn't necessarily a
required expense.
	
	As far as raising a family in NYC. I wouldn't want to raise a
family anywhere else. I hated growing up in the burbs; I had very little
exposure to different cultures/people/work/food/you name it. Here you
get it all, and overall NYC is one of the safest cities in the world.

miss a lot about it, the food, the bars, the clubs, the parks, etc.  But
I would never raise a family there, ever.

Nice stuff.  I forgot to mention in my initial post, there's now a PECL 
package for gpg: http://pecl.php.net/package/gnupg

There's a PEAR proposal, which I gave feedback on, and even got access to 
work on the source code, but it hasn't been approved or my updates 
released.  Time... :/

It's interesting to listen to all the opinions.  One says don't raise a
family in NYC, and one says it's the best thing.  It all depends on what
YOU want.  Personally, I grew up in central NJ and am still in the area. 
I don't get to NYC too often, but I have neighnors who commute every day. 
Some drive, but most take the train or bus.  Driving into the city every
day will become tiresome very quickly.  The train goes to Penn Station
(under Madison Square Garden); the bus goes to Port Authority (just across
the river from NJ).  Either way, you will need to get to the office from
there.  Probably take a subway.  The commute won't be short from central
Jersey, but I personally love the suburbs and would not want to live or
even work in the city.  You should go visit the Manhattan, visit the other
boroughs, visit northen NJ and central NJ.  If you look to the
Woodbridge/Edison/North Brunswick area, it's not too bad.  South
Brunwsick, East Brunswick, West Windsor, and Princeton are a little
further away, but are very nice areas.  And the public schools are great
compared to the urban areas.  You won't have to worry about where to park
your car at night.  You might even want to rent a house instead of an
apartment, and eventually buy one to build some equity.  Again, it all
depends on what you and your family want.  Don't necessarily go by what
any of us recommend, but take our advice into account when making up your
mind.  What part of VT are you from?  I think you will find that neither
NY nor NJ is anything like VT, but central Jersey is a lot closer.

As for salary, $65K is too low for living in the city.  Living in NJ, you
could do it, but remember that commuting is not too cheap either.  Now
here is another idea altogether.  Look for something in the Princeton area
and live in South Brunswick for example.  Princeton is expanding, with a
lot of new office space being built.  The salary they are offering you is
really a NJ salary, not a NY salary.

I thought standard rule was that housing should not exceed 25% of gross, and
consumer credit cards should not exceed 10% of gross.
This ratio means you can meet your other basic bills.
Anything over than means you will struggle.
Most banks/accountants look the other way if your housing goes to 33% of
gross.
Ten or more years ago there was an article in New York Magazine indicating
that many people spend 40 - 50% of gross on housing in New York City.
 
There was a TIME Magazine cover story, again at least 6 years ago, espousing
that $125K was the new ultra perfect salary to command to live great.
 
I have lived in Manhattan's Upper West, Upper East, East Village, and
Chelsea, Later in Park Slope. Then Long Island. Lastly, Riverdale in the
Bronx.
Essentially, I do know from whence I speak.  
 
Whatever your per annum objective, on a more micro scale: making $65 per
hour is when you will finally feel free. 
$45 per hour is good. $35 tight. Any less, it is all a wash and a loss.
And you gotta realize many other non-programmer professionals (dentists,
lawyers, accountants) command $90 - $300 per hr.
 
I have found:
$55 - 65K: you will have little free money and taking a taxi will seem an
extravagance.
You may actually live in a walk up. 
Kids will have to go to Public School. (So I recommend Park Slope over
Queens any time.)
Yes, your wife should work, but then cost of day care / nanny will drain all
that extra cash. 
You will need to use no cost play groups, etc.
Parking per month often costs way over $100. Many people pay $300+.
If you think you are going to drive around: Average parking lot in Manhattan
starts at $16 - $20 for first hour.
Meters are now 7 days, on many side streets and many cost $1.50 per hr.
You will do a lot of Chinese pick up.
 
$80 - 90K: you can feel alright. Rent a car for the weekend. Drive upstate,
see Woodstock. Do the Vineyard. Once. Check out the Hamptons. Once.
Go out to dinner at $80 1x per week. Eat sushi sometimes. Rent a lot, a lot
of DVDs. Still predominantly order out Chinese. Or Thai as a treat.
 
But you can definitely do it at any price. Lots do.
 
But myself, 20 years ago I used to recommend to all young kids: go to
college, come to New York.
Now I say go to college. Then go get started in a second tier city like
Dallas, Phoenix, Miami, Denver. 
 
After traveling I have found so much beauty and better value in other
cities. And many people all over have 
great lifestyles with spacious homes. 
 
All my family, every good friend I ever had has long ago moved away from NY.
None. Not a single. Has ever returned.
 
Go figure.
 
Peter

Hello,

Guys i know this is off-topic but i may be looking to move to queens and
have a job in NYC.  The salary is 65-80k DOE

i am wondering if this is enough to support a family on.  I checked into
some apartments and they range from $1200 - $5000 / mo depending on what you
get. 

I know at 65k i could afford a 3br at no more than 2000  mo however what i
wish to know is would the remainder be enough to live on in NYC.

that would leave about $1629, that is basing it on a monthly salary and
witholding 33% for taxes. 

I am not sure what gas, registration, vehicle taxes etc. are.

Could some here that live in NYC please give some advice.

Thanks,

Hi Joseph,

The NYC employer in times square is going to work you hard , as hard as
they can.
PHP is in demand now, but maybe not forever - If you knew you'd work
this job for 10 years then you'd be in a safer position.
 You need to be able to save money as well.  65k is just over 30hr...
so... Make sure you get at least 80k.

Another way to look at it is as a stepping stone - do this job so you
can look for a sustainable job - riskier approach with kids. Using a job
is not disloyalty, that's being honest with yourself.

Just my .02

I'd like to back this question up to the very beginning, and ask a
more fundamental question that's been nagging at me for several
days...

So a client comes up to you with an intent to require encrypted data
in the database. This of course requires two-way encryption, which
unfortunately means you gotta store the keys on the webserver to
decrypt the data.

So what additional security does this actually accomplish, and is
there a better approach?

+1 on this topic.  It's a good question. Anybody?

That is pretty much the problem in a nutshell.  Any kind of 2-way
encryption on a single server is going to require that the key be
present on the system and therefore vulnerable to attack.

I wish I had a silver bullet answer to this problem, but at this point
the only advice I can give is that in this situation the security of the
data is only as good as the security of your system and application,
regardless of whether it is encrypted on disk or not.

Excuse me for my ignorance, but isn't there some sense of security in 
placing the key in a directory that's protected by the path to the 
directory (not root), permissions, and .htacess?

Granted that's not prefect, but what is?

I've read Shiflett's book on security and even he states that a 
hardware key provides the "best" security, but adds "for those who 
can afford it".

It is plausible for the client/provider to agree on a verbal key and 
not have it on the server, like a password? Once you hash a "strong" 
password, it becomes pretty hard to crack it.

I don't know, just asking for discussion.

There was a similar thread about a year ago:
<http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2005-June/thread.html#15222>
which I commented on, (and perhaps should have used the term
'Multilayer' instead of 'Multifactor')

There are some interesting "Translucent Database" techniques out there
(a quick google shows a few links to follow for more info), but they can
get difficult to implement correctly and thus loose the security you
_think_ you have.

Well, I was thinking the same thing.  Essentially you don't store the 
key on the server but submit it from the client side.

Ditto.  Expecting there must be reasons why greater minds wouldn't use 
this approach, but not knowing what they are...

By making the decryption key available to the webserver, the benefit
of encrypting the data in the first place is extremely questionable.

The only way to safely handle this is to keep the decryption key in a
separate place. You could either provide it to the original server on
demand (via a form field) when someone needs to work with the
encrypted data, or (better yet) you could bring the encrypted data to
another, locked-down system and perform on-demand decryption there.

Typically, you're storing credit card details, right? The only
person/system that needs to decrypt these is the person/system that is
performing the actual act of charging the card. Nobody else in the
order chain needs the data, so it should be trivial to set up this
kind of separation.

Jeepers, that's huge. Nearly twice as many php sites as asp?

Anybody have any theories (besides, 'the language is just that good')?

I haven't seen the point of basic server security brought up in this 
thread, so forgive me if I am repeating this, but security in a server 
ultimately rests on the use of a server's ability to grant various 
permissions to various users.

Many applications are written to connect to a database as a superuser 
and then implement security in the PHP layer.  If this is the case, this 
is a far more serious security problem.  If regular user accounts are 
used and assigned various permissions, then you have the strength of the 
db server security protecting the data.

quoting from page 86 of Pro PHP Security:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Because PHP is often used for web applications, it is important to 
note that if your webserver has read access to your secret key, then 
any other script run by your webserver may have access to it (this is 
the "nobody's business" problem we discussed in Chapter 2). This 
issue can be mitigated somewhat by executing PHP with a suexec call 
that causes all scripts to be run with the userid and group of their 
owners (information is at 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/suexec.html), but your secret is 
still only one exploit or uploaded script away from being discovered. 
This obviously has enormous security implications if you use 
symmetric encryption as demonstrated earlier with the mcrypt class, 
because anyone who manages to discover the secret key can use it to 
decrypt your data. In many situations this is going to be an 
unacceptable risk, and so we turn now to how you might use asymmetric 
encryption with PHP (using a public/private key pair) to help you 
protect secret data. As we discussed in Chapter 5, with asymmetric 
encryption a public key is used for encryption, and a corresponding 
private key for decryption.
The idea, then, is to give a public key to the webserver (in a 
configuration file, for instance), while keeping the all-important 
private key off the server. The webserver uses the public key to 
encrypt data for storing in the database, but can't decrypt that data 
because it has no access to the private key. When some data from your 
database does need to be decrypted, that task can be taken care of 
away from the web server, in an administrative environment on a 
separate server or workstation that has access to the private key.

In my case I am thinking about encrypting (and decrypting) the user's 
social security number.

Where to store the key is a similar problem as where to store the 
username/password credentials for DB access, correct?

I'm in a shared hosting environment so I've got that working against me 
as well.

Well... one sounds like a snake.  :-)

Also, there's less books to read in php -- Amazon reports 953 asp 
books while php is less than half that figure (447).

Not that this is a valid indicator in any fashion, but I used to 
notice in bookstores that the more books there were on a specific 
topic the greater the demand to understand what the heck was going 
on. When C++ first came out, there was indeed much more demand for 
understanding than there was for C.

I use to think that IT managers used to frequent book stores to 
determine in what direction they should focus their efforts. Seeing 
lot's of books on a subject meant to them that the industry was 
headed that way when in fact it was just more problematic. Sort of a 
"let's take the most difficult path" approach to things, but then 
again, I could be naive in my perspective.

My first impression was that "CGI", which comes in third, is not a 
language itself (in some circles it seems synonymous with "Perl"), and 
so I wondered why it was even listed.  Aren't the rest of these just one 
form or another of CGI?  That says to me that the results aren't totally 
scientific.  It depends on how the "web information extraction 
technologies" operate.  Surely they're not just counting up file 
extensions...

Dan, any clues how they came up with these numbers?

It's a slightly different problem. After all, one of the big reasons
to encrypt that SSN is that there's a very good chance that someone
else on your shared host could, with enough effort, get the access
credentials that the webserver uses to connect to the DB.

Since you can't keep the webserver out of the database, the encryption
scheme is there to keep it out of the data itself.

It bears mentioning that you really want to use an asymmetric
encryption algorithm (like RSA) so that the decryption key (which only
you have) is different from the encryption key (which the server has).

Personally, I'd like to see a breakdown of these sites by application.
 I would suspect that a handful of apps (eg phpBB, Drupal, *Nukes,
Mambo, Joomla and ZenCart/osCommerce) are a huge portion of these
sites.  Regardless of what you think of them, they are all easy to
deploy, have pretty active communities, can be themed to varying
degrees and all have dozens if not hundreds of models and extensions
available.

Prior to many of these, getting a shopping cart, forum or CMS online
was a pain and in the past 3 (4-5?) years these made it just plain
simple.

But that would only be an issue if you are using the "chocolate 
defense", hard on the outside, soft on the inside.

This is not an issue when using the Spartan defense, where the 
resistance gets stiffer the closer you get to the sensitive areas.  When 
this approach is used, being able to connect to the database is 
meaningless unless you can connect as a priveleged user.  Granting 
priveleged access to certain tables on a user-by-user basis is the most 
secure you can make the data.  The code then takes user credentials and 
connects as that user, instead of connecting as a superuser.

By contrast, letting the code connect as a superuser and letting the 
code arbitrate when to grant access to what to whom is by structure 
closer to 'chocolate' than to 'sparta', so it has to be discarded in 
cases where security is even marginally important.

One of the things about PHP is that php.net allows you the need of
less books because of the documentation and the samples found on
this site.  As programmer of PERL and ASP, their documentation
online an example is not as comprehensive.  PHP.net makes it easier
to understand the language.

If it's something that only the user would know (like a password), 
then hash it and forget it -- you don't need to have the actual 
number in your dB, but rather the hash for it, right?

In my view this is irresponsible.

1. the ss# is the defacto "personal identifying information" and 
demonstration of public trust for any legal test. There is no valid 
excuse for not protecting it.
2. the shared hosting environment is the classic "I saved money by 
consciously choosing an insecure, low-cost platform" situation. The 
combination supports a negligence action should there be a problem.

If the SS# is used as a unique identifier, choose something else or use 
an encrypted sring with the keys and ss# offline.

If the SS# is needed to cooperate with other systems, then you obviously 
have access to collaborating servers and can work together to keep the 
keys separate from the data. Yes there is a cost to that, see #1 above.

How rare is it that you don't have any other knowledge about a 
transaction at run time than the data submitted by the form? That is 
rare for environments where things like ss#'s are used. The application 
designer should use other a-priori knowledge to place the transaction 
into context, such that the ss# is not needed to be stored locally.  For 
example, if it's members only, then members who have ss#'s on file don't 
get asked their ss#. if you need to ask them, something else in your 
process needs to be fixed.

As much as I dislike the legal system, I admit that the process of 
passing-the-buck can work in the favor of the consumer sometimes. In our 
practical world risk is not to be avoided but managed. If anyone is 
requiring the ss# be stored locally, have that in writing in a form that 
supports a passing of liability away from you. You'll know it's a strong 
enough document when the project stops until the next guy finds a way to 
offload the liability to someone else. Think of ss# as a "hot potato" 
you don't want to be caught holding when the music stops.

If you find yourself assuming the liability because you need the cash, 
or are willing to assume the risk because you're the little guy, or you 
think everything is cool even though you're going against your gut 
feelin about security, consider what all the Bg Boy's already know:  in 
any deal, take a look around the room and look for the sucker. If you 
can't tell who the sucker is, it's you.

I'm not sure if my description of shared hosting environment is accurate.

I am with one department at a college.  There are a number of 
departments who use the same web server.  The IT department maintains 
the server and assigns permissions and directory access to the various 
departments.  It is in that sense that I am in a shared environment.

The SS# is not being used as a unique identifier.  It is part of the 
information that a student can choose to fill in when they are applying 
for admission to the college.  (It is not a required field.)

Not sure what the sring is or how to keep the key offline, but those are 
the types of issues I want to be researching.  The encryption part of 
the application development won't start until at least next week.

Well, that could be even worse if you don't control the server and those 
who do have no accountability for what you do on that server.

 From the sound of things, you don't  need to collect SSN so why take 
that risk? As soon as it is entered, it becomes a liability (depends on 
what state you're in what the liability actually is).

It seems your college is actually rather porgressive in trying to 
protect student data and privacy: see 
http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:KoF0heipsy8J:searchsecurity.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid14_gci1171482,00.html%3Fbucket%3DNEWS+%22smith+college%22+policies+on+social+security+numbers&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=3
"Added to the mix are.....<redacted>.... both small liberal arts womens' 
schools. According to Schneider, these two schools are interesting to 
the alliance because they have young, predominantly female student 
populations to lend diversity to the more technical campuses."

there is also a privacy policy online that seems to suggest info is to 
be safeguarded, although by a very quick read it was not a very 
pro-student policy IMHO.
http://www.*******.edu/sao/handbook/policies/privacyofrecords.php

It may be that someone added that field as optional and 
just-in-case-it-might-be-useful so if you can find any policy at all 
that questions it, it might disappear from the specifications. Is the 
university involved in research grants from the government? If yes, it 
may be a covered entity under HIPAA, which regulates the use and storage 
of ss#. Maybe check your university IT policies on SS# just enough to 
find a need for clarification, to make the issue go away for a while?

Best of luck passing the buck.

Message-ID: <8d9a42800608050711q6ba99ec0t4666ba9e4d13de99@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

I created an svn log parser that will read the svn.log and then calculate
the % each person has put in, however i am trying to make it generate the
log if it does not exist, it keeps failing, here is what i have

$directory = '/home/httpd/vhosts/b2cdev.licketyship.com/httpdocs';
$file = $directory.'/svn.log';

while(!is_file($file) || !is_readable($file)) {
    chdir($directory);
    if(exec('/usr/bin/svn log -v > '.$file)) echo 'file created'; else echo
'failed'; exit;
    sleep(2);
}

i added the echo and exit for testing, everytime it seems to echo failed! :(

I am not sure what is going on because when i login as root and su to the
apache account and run svn log or the above command, it works fine.

both the getcwd and $directory are the same.

Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Aaron;

As this is becoming such a big deal (not only in your environment) has 
your department considered housing YOUR OWN server as a database storage 
site.  Even if your web code runs on the IT department's "shared" web 
server you certanly could easily code your programs to store and 
retrieve such data from a different system.  And that system could be 
located in YOUR department under your lock and key (literally and 
figuratively).

Might be worth looking at.  And with server appliances and Linux as 
inexpensive as they are these days, it almost petty cash for a department.

Good luck - let us know?

Hello all,

As is the usual case, August is a slow month for meetings.  So I want to
ping this list and our community for ideas on what we could do for a
meeting.  A couple of ideas:

-- formal presentation - anyone?

-- open forum/discussion - moderators?

-- informal gathering at a restaurant/lounge - where?

Thoughts, ideas and preferences?

Hi,

We might have someone locked in for Sept - we should know this week.  But if
August and Sept. don't work out, Sreedhar, let's still plan on another
meeting.  Perhaps November?

Let me know your thoughts off-list.

Thanks,

In command shell speak 1 means an error occurred.

The reason you're not getting any output is that you're redirecting it
to $file.

If your php process doesn't have permission to create the file, it will
just return 1.

You can get around this by doing 2 things.

firstly, touch() the file and chmod it appropriately from php, which
will allow you to react appropriately to any errors there

secondly, redirect stderr from the svn log command to stdout so that you
can see any errors it outputs and react to them:

1. use 1>&3 to 'save' stdout
2. redirect stdout to the output file with 1>filename
3. redirect stderr to the 'saved' stdout with 2>&3

Here is some example code:

$directory = '/home/httpd/vhosts/b2cdev.licketyship.com/httpdocs';
chdir($directory);

$file = 'svn.log';

if (!is_file($file) || !is_readable($file)) {
  if (!touch($file)) {
    echo 'error: couldn't touch '.$file;
    exit;
  }

  chmod($file,0644);

  exec('/usr/bin/svn log -v 1>&3 1>'.$file.' 2>&3',$output,$retval);
  if ($retval != 0) {
    echo 'error: '. implode("\n",$output);
    exit;
  }

  echo 'file created';
}

I just realised there is a much simpler way to achieve this:

exec('/usr/bin/svn log -v 2>&1 1>'.$file,$output,$retval);

Dan,

Thanks, it's not that it cannot create the file, the file is created however
it is always blank.

Thanks,

Hi,

We might have someone locked in for Sept - we should know this week.  But
if
August and Sept. don't work out, Sreedhar, let's still plan on another
meeting.  Perhaps November?

Let me know your thoughts off-list.

Thanks,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP 5 SOAP && WSDL
Message-ID: <8d9a42800608071400t34220bf0w8640fe5c0a5ac373@mail.gmail.com>

Guys i could use a little help, this is the first time i have run into any
issue using SOAP.

The comapny i am doing work for currently hired an ASP.NET developer to
create a WSDL for product availability checking.

usually when dealing with WSDL on php i have created the data in the form of
an array, however this is a bit odd.

the wsdl is attached, and my code sample attached as well.

Everytime i try i get errors and never any success.

Thanks,

I should note that the developer who created the web service stated that i
had to pass in objects, not sure why as i dont recall doing this when
integrating ArcWebServices.com

but is there a way to use the built in Soap extension?

Joseph --

You should be able to get it to work. Can you get a sample of a
properly formatted SOAP request (i.e. the XML) and compare that to
what your code is generating?

That will help you isolate what you need to get ext/soap to do
"better." Once you have that, I may be able to more easily generate
some suggestions for you, as I find the best place to start debugging
is by inspecting the wire.

would be a big help on my end as well lol

Message-ID: <c5949a380608081401u592bd048v489818f7e9e5b0a6@mail.gmail.com>

I have tried a zillion editors over the years, and have been playing
with textmate as of late.

The issue is that If I mount my remote dir, then edit using textmate
(OSX), the response is horrendously sluggish, (no matter what speed
i'm lucky to be on, even up to 20mbs), local of course it works great.

I was wondering how people who often have to work with files across a
network (dreamhost for me), what's their latest, and greatest way of
handling editing?  Yes, VIM rocks, I just wish it's fonts handling was
a bit better in terminal.

 thanks, ed  :-)

Use Vim :-)

Fire up X11 and use an xterm.  It is far better than the Terminal app
IME.  And you could also get into any of the other X-based terminal apps
if you want.

Vim 7.0 has *awesome* remote if you choose to run it locally.  Though
you may need to build it from source... dunno.  Haven't fired up my mac
in a year.  Otherwise, you'll likely be using Vim 6.X on the remote
server, which is, of course, very good, too.  Either way, try X11 and
xterm.

HTH,
Andrew

Doesn't help you too much, but I tend to use EmEditor on my (windows)
laptop and rsync (via cygwin) to propagate changes out to various
development/production servers.

The main reasons I use this setup are so that I always have a local copy
of the code to work on and because the majority is in SVN, which runs
much more happily when the working copies are on a local disk.

Presumably you could set up the same thing, instead of mounting the
remote dir just make a local copy, edit it with textmate and use rsync
(or unison if your remote files are likely to change) to keep the 2
copies in sync.

Let's not ignore the fact that Dreamhost has been HORRIBLE for the past 
two weeks. It may simply be a connection problem on their end.

Yep, I can definately second that: coming from the UK to the US, I Iived 
in central-east NJ, on the shore for awhile. When I got a job in the 
city (SoHo) it was about 2 hours door-to-door (I drove and would park in 
Hoboken or Newport then catch the PATH) - 20 hours per week wasted on 
commuting! I eventually realized, even with the higher prices, it was 
better just moving to the city. But as other people have said, being 
single is different from having a family. But that was 10 years ago - 
rents now are absolutely insane. If you're a stock broker, lawyer or 
plastic surgeon, you can afford it much more easily.

What would people consider a good minimum salary for living in the city?

I just installed PHPEclipse and the subversion plugin, and I am ready
to rock. With PHPEclipse you can work on remote files, remote sites,
make use of version control, the works.

Well, can't you get the provider to provide you with a sample? Or at
least find a friend who can run a sample in a language they do provide
samples for?

Quite frankly, that will probably be easier than trying to reverse
engineer the request from the WSDL -- especially if it's something
slightly non-standard or the server is particular.

Perfect segue.  Anyone doing remote debugging with PHPclipse/dgb?  I
generally use PHPEclipse but am now getting errors with hasChildren in
Eclipse 3.2, and an empty response with 3.1 against an Apache 1 Linux
server.  Source files are mounted via sftp on a Linux server.

I recently switched from PHPEclipse to the Zend PHP IDE - 
<http://www.zend.com/phpide>.  It's getting updated frequently and I 
suspect it will surpass PHPEclipse.  The earlier versions had some major 
issues with folding and syntax highlighting, but now it's pretty solid.

Download the All-In-One version - it gives you everything you need, just 
unpack it and it's ready to go (be sure to delete your old .workspace 
and .project files).  You get javascript, css, and html highlighting 
with that too.

I haven't tried remote editing in either... is that a 
PHPEclipse-specific feature or a general Eclipse feature?

One note is that Eclipse is a memory hog.  512MB just barely cut it for 
me.  Upgraded to 2.5GB and now I'm flying :)

Could you give a 90-second lesson, or a useful URL, dealing with using
Eclipse on remote files?

What I think Joseph was asking for was for PHP code he can use to inspect 
his stream.  For PEAR SOAP, the following may do the trick for you.

outbound:
   echo $client->__get_wire();

inbound:
   $result = $client->call(...);
   echo $result;

Good call - we could do a couple of shorts from various people on how they
use Eclipse and/or IDEs, and their development methods (remote debugging,
file access, etc)?

Textmate seems very nice.  I've become a fan of it watching colleagues use
it on their macs.  Unfortunately I don't have one so I can't offer my own
experience with it.

I've been using phpEclipse (win32 and linux) with subClipse (subversion) for
a few months and as of Rob's post switched my win32 box to zend's phpide.
For a first impression with a couple hours of 'normal' use for a large
project I'm working on this morning, very impressive.  I'm a big fan of the
phpExplorer and how well it handles includes.

Haven't gotten into the debugging yet as my library on this project tends to
make php's debugger explode in an incredibly gory and unappreciative way.
Something to do with recursive references and celestial alignment.

As a warning for anyone replacing phpEclipse, after getting rid of
phpEclipse and installing zend's my eclipse installation went blammo. I had
to start fresh - replacing my workspace did nothing for me. I'm not saying
the same will happen to everyone, as it could have just been a bad mix of
plugins or more likely my own ignorance but be warned that it could go sour.
Were I more intelligent and patient, I probably would have backed up eclipse
and my workspace before trying.

Indeed.  My 1gb just barely keeps things happy (javaw.exe aka eclipse
ferociously elbowing in at 453mb at the moment), with the occasional java
freeze, which I got very familiar with using Zend Studio.  It always comes
out of the freeze, just takes about 10 seconds before it thaws.  It happens
about 1 or 2 times an hour for me.

I use Zend IDE and remote files can be done via FTP, or you can use CVS or
SVN for source control and commit and update right from within Zends IDE.

I love it and it's fast enough for me on 6000/768

lol i really wish i could attend this meeting sounds like it will be really
good :)

as for those who have had issues with zend freezing, i have not had that
issue in the last 2 versions ;)  I love zend's ide and it's remote debugging
capabilities with source control etc.  It even has an SQL browser so you can
connect to SQL databases, i just hope that make that much better for mysql 5
and stored procedures, and actually let you create/edit the database
inline.  That would make it so you never needed PhpMyAdmin or the command
line :D

Interestingly enough, I use Dreamhost, and work on a Mac as well. I  
use BBEdit, either via command line, via Transmit, or directly to the  
server. It's a really robust text editor, and worth the upgrade price  
I pay ever year or so.

Ive used pretty much all the editors listed here and have noticed a  
few things ...

(In regards to network latency)

Different IDEs take different approaches when dealing with large  
projects and remote projects ... some will parse xref/functions/ 
classes @ the time a file is requested and others will take the time  
to parse the entire tree (w/o caching) when the project is opened.   
Some editors have no settings for such things while others are buried  
under hidden settings ...

Thus Id have to say that the "correct" method on working either way  
is the Subversion method of checking out a local copy, modify your  
working copy, and checking your work back in.  No one who wants to do  
a quick edit w/ a simple editor wants to do it, including myself in  
which case I always jump in nano/pico on a box + put the GUI IDE  
aside for a few seconds.

Ive recently attempted a WebDAV over VPN connect w/ TextMate and  
realized it was not the right way to go, no matter what IDE.

TextMate is also pretty sluggish if you load up *all* available  
Bundles, I still wish there was someway to type:

mate . -php

On the command line to load up only the bundles you needed.

I still however think that Zend Studio is pretty much *the* editor to  
have for PHP but the only thing that would help me out + a few others  
is having a few screencasts or something showing how the Zend guys  
(or indy core guys) actually use the thing to its fullest.  The built  
in SQL editor, Watches, and Analyze Code are must haves.

Either way a "how I work" feature/presentation would be nice to see.

Message-ID: <a304e2d60608101239l4594f474n5aa339c6fac3e65@mail.gmail.com>

People,

In one PHP page I have an input field name bid_sub_desc0, bid)sub_desc1,
etc...
Whe I am in my next PHP page I am try to move the different values to single
variable
to later added it a query.  bid sub tell me how many bids  where entered.
    for($i=0; $i < count($bid_sub); $i++)
    {
      $query .= ",;" . $_POST['bid_sub_desc$i'] . ":";
    }

When I print print "QUERY =$query|<br>\n";
I get nothing :
  QUERY=,':','::')|

The varable inside the $_POST is no getting refered to the way I want it to.
I was expecting the bid_sub_desc$1 to change to:
bid_sub_desc0
bid_sub_desc1
etc
depending on the $bid_sub

Any ideas?

thnaks,

N?stor :-)

I'm not sure but I think you're trying to use variable variables, maybe 
you can read 
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.variable.php. I've had 
to do something like that a while ago and that was helpful, I hope it's 
helpful for you too ;)

Your problem is occurring because you're enclosing the index in single quotes.
Change
$query .= ",;" . $_POST['bid_sub_desc$i'] . ":";
to
$query .= ",;" . $_POST['bid_sub_desc'.$i] . ":";

If you can change the names on the form to 
arrays, it would make your life much easier. Then 
instead of checking for $_POST['bid_sub_desc' 
.$i], you could use $_POST['bid_sub_desc][$i]

switching the single quotes to double quotes should work also:
$query .= ",;" . $_POST["bid_sub_desc$i"] . ":";

PHP expands variables enclosed in double quotes but leaves everything as 
is if enclosed in single quotes.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] heredoc string formatting question
Message-ID: <000d01c6bcc2$a9f60db0$12a8a8c0@HirschLaptop>

I currently generate email bodies as follows:
 
$body  = "Hi $name. Welcome message.".NEWLINE;
$body .= NEWLINE;
$body .= $somevariable;
$body  .= NEWLINE;
$body .= "More body";
 
It works. It's fairly easy on the eyes. But it's laborious - and
hardcoded.
 
I'm thinking of switching to:
 
$body  = <<<EOT 
Hi $name. Welcome message.
 
$somevariable
 
More body.
EOT;
 
Both approached are hard coded, which has major limitations. I'm a bit
concerned about how line breaks are interrupted by heredoc and
downstream email clients.
 
The other alternative would be a template-driven database approach, but
than the body "variable" would have to be parsed every time.
 
One though I had was to use Smarty to generate tpl files for the email
bodies, letting it do the parsing and compiling.
 
Thoughts? Comments?

What I have been doing lately is something like this:

$tmp = array();
$tmp[] = "Hi $name, Welcome message";
$tmp[] = $somevariable;
$tmp[] = "More body";
$body = implode(NEWLINE,$tmp);

Why not have templates such as files that have all this stuff in it such as:


Hi %%name%%. Welcome message

%%body%%

This could be the footer


You would have that in a file then use file_get_contents() to put it all 
into one big string then you could use say

str_replace( '%%name%%', $name, $contents );
str_replace( '%%body%%', $name, $contents );

you could even use an html file as your template. I do this all that time.

I have used the Smarty approach, with good results.

There are two potential gotchas with the heredoc approach:

1) make sure your editor is using the correct newline character(s)
2) make sure your editor doesn't _ever_ accidentally indent the "EOT;"

The second one is a big deal.

There's really no reason not to just quote the whole thing, is there?

$body = "Hi $name,
Thanks for joining.
$somevariable

Or, if you have an editor that does auto-indent:

$body = "Hi $name,".NEWLINE
             ."Thanks for joining.".NEWLINE
             .$somevariable.NEWLINE
             ."Bye!";

... though I gues the concatenating dots are easy to miss.

A template system is the way to go if you have to build more than a
few of these, or if you need to generate complex (multi-part html)
messages.

Thanks to all -- excellent suggestions all around. In summary, heredoc
seems to be a waste. Too much room for error with a finicky editor and
no major added benefit.

In the long run, it seems like a template system is the way to go.

There are two potential gotchas with the heredoc approach:

1) make sure your editor is using the correct newline character(s)
2) make sure your editor doesn't _ever_ accidentally indent the "EOT;"

The second one is a big deal.

There's really no reason not to just quote the whole thing, is there?

$body = "Hi $name,
Thanks for joining.
$somevariable
Bye!";

(Hans Z, you knew this was coming..)

On the contrary, I think heredoc is a very valuable tool to have.

Whether you are writing out a long mail message or a long html
section, and all you have to do is drop a few variables, then heredoc
is great.  I think it is especially easier to read the 'native'
language in this format (whether it is straight text or tagged html)
than flipping in-and-out of <?php ?> tags everywhere with dots and
quotes, newlines and linefeeds, and other punctuation... blah. It also
relieves you having to watch out for escaping single or double quotes
and other escapables. You just write what you want to write, the way you
have always written it. From experience I know that it makes revisiting
code much easier.

For short ones, like Mr. Snyder said, just quote the whole thing.

You're right, it isn't always the answer. However...

It's generally easier to maintain a large project in a team environment 
when you add all that "complexity".  Clean and simple is a good concept, 
but when utilizing PHP as an application development language vs. a 
quick scripting language, it often becomes very cluttered without the 
abstraction, ultimately clashing with your attempts at keeping things 
"clean and simple" in the way I believe you were describing it.

Often times even that approach goes too far... *cough* Symfony + Propel 
*cough*  (I could rant on that for hours).

Just my thoughts.

I'm torn on this one and have to try it first to see how many times I leave an
inadvertant space in front of the closing clause before I pass judgement.

None taken. To me, the big issue is maintainability versus "clean and simple"
which often translates to "quick and dirty." I can knock out a deeply embedded
"email template" in minutes, and I'm the architect and programmer (a dangerous
beast), so its no big deal.

But what happens a year from now when I'm long gone and Joe MBA wants to
change that email message from "Thanks for visiting our web site" to "Thank
you for making me rich", and he wants it doen instantly so as not to impact
his tee time. Double quotes & heredoc simply don't cut it.

If possible to change your code then better approach from HTML point of  
view is to declare your input variable as an array itself like shown below.

<input type="text" name="bid_sub_desc[]" value="val1" />
<input type="text" name="bid_sub_desc[]" value="val2" />
<input type="text" name="bid_sub_desc[]" value="val3" />

By this way you will receive values of all these input fields into single  
array "$_POST['bid_sub_desc']". Then you can do rest of stuffs with it  
just like you do with normal php array without bothering about handling  
"$i", "quotes", "expansion" and "concatenation"

Hello Nick, 

http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.ssh2.php (you may need to tweak by hand for
SSH options).

It appears PHP.net has a lot of info for ssh:
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.ssh2-shell.php may work for a CLI php
app.

How about letting a user upload a new .* file that is created on their
locatal machine. Then they can login (w/ssh credentials) through the web
based GUI, select the file from an input type=file box and use
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.ssh2-scp-send.php
to send it.

There are probably a few solutions, good luck!

- Ben

To find all PHP scripts under /home (assuming they all use .php as the 
filename extension):


# find /home -name "*.php"


Perl might be a bit trickier - some people might be using .pl or .cgi. 
If all your users have a separate cgi-bin folder then it should be easy 
to write a script to iterate through all the cgi-bins and run a find 
command on each:

find /home/$username/cgi-bin -exec grep -l /usr/bin/perl {} \;

(assuming they have something like "#!/usr/bin/perl" at the top of their 
CGI scripts.


There's many ways to skin this cat.

No doubt. Maybe some clever solution with involving the access logs?

Thanks for your answers, it's very helpful I just need some basic stats 
about what the users use more php o perl in order to make some changes 
etc. I've been looking for some ways to do it with the apache logs etc, 
but I can do what Ajai says first and then do some research in the logs. 
Thanks again for the answers ;)

Following up on this, the SSH2 functions are only available if you
install the beta-grade PECL extension that contains them, and only on
unix-like systems with libssh2 (that's libssh2-dev for package
admins):

pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/ssh2-0.10

Basically, you need to know what you're doing at this point to use
them, but they work and are a good solution to the "web server needs
to write to files it shouldn't own" problem.

I (rather naiively) looked at using file:// urls (check out
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84128 sometime, it's
absolutely shameful that five years later there is still no indication
that file:// urls don't work in FireFox.)

I'm thinking now that the pages should be distributed on cd, and use
ajax to pull in the remote content. But before I try this seemingly
backwards approach, does anyone here have any experience with this
type of content delivery?

Thanks Chris & Ben,

I am trying to find out per Zend site whether i5/OS even supports 
libssh(2) as of yet.  Perhaps there should be a future meeting on Zends 
i5/OS implementation of php?  Any takers, Hans?

I was going to annoy David with an offline request regarding how this is
done, but the solution is interesting enough to share with the group.

In the past I have intentionally used the bare minimum of Smarty
functionality, thinking as others here have noted that PHP is already a
templating language in some respects. That mean I have only used the
Smarty Display command, so I couldn't figure out a way to access the
compiled and parsed template.

Turns out it couldn't be easier.

See: http://smarty.php.net/manual/en/api.fetch.php

Fetch returns the template output -- easy. And the bottom of the page
listed above provides an email template example. Using this solution
coupled with FCKeditor to allow any admin to customize the template has
real possibilities. The Smarty get_template_vars() function could
probably be used to show an admin what the potential "custom" variables
are.

Thanks to David for pointing out that this approach works.

It should not make any difference as they are different subjects with 
different audiences, and he is not breaking any rules or guidelines are 
any such nonsense.

I would be careful about the IP assigned by the host, the past history 
of that IP, and other websites on it if it is a shared hosting environment.

The SEO advice out there is frigtheningly inaccurate, at best.

Adam,

:)  I did check there first and attempted to use them but they just returned
errors because it's not connecting to the web service.  I am not sure what
is going on but they decided to just use a curl POST to accomplish the task.

Thanks for all the responses,

You must enable the trace option in your SOAPClient constructor:

$client = new SOAPClient('my.wsdl', array('trace' => true));

I will update the PHP Manual to mention this.

As to whether using cURL is a better alternative, well, I guess if
it's working for you, then it's okay. But even if you manage to create
the SOAP Envelope correctly and POST it, you're still stuck parsing
it, which doesn't sound like a fun job. (Well, I guess it depends if
you're using rpc/encoded or doc/lit.) YMMV.

Huh?  The pure PHP approach via heredoc or plain old quoted 
syntax is the straight ahead way to go.  If you want the template 
separated from the logic, put it in an include file.

What's the room for error?  The editor changes the line endings from 
CRLF to LF or vice versa?  BFD.  All email programs can read either.  
Inadvertently indenting the heredoc's endpoint?  I've never had that 
happen in all my seven years of using PHP.

Template engines and languages are what's complex, finicky and add 
notable processing overhead.

This thread is talking about cutting butter with a chainsaw.

I've seen a lot of BAD search engine optimization advice - and very little
GOOD.

Hosting the blogs on the same server shouldn't matter, though, as places
like Blogger and WordPress.com do it all the time. And both host some blogs
that score high on searches, and others that don't.

From my understanding of Google's technical information, and personal
experience, a lot of your search hits are going to come from how many people
link to you, and how much traffic you get - not what server you're hosted
on.

Sometimes you need a chainsaw, you know. ;-)

I'll take responsibility for the "editor flakiness" angle, because I
_have_ had it happen to me. Sure, it's dumb to run "indent code"
macros without looking for in-script formatted text, but faced with a
hundred lines of unindented spaghetti logic, that's what I did. And
then everything stopped working.

Heredoc is a fragile construction. Nothing else in php (with the
possible exception of extra linebreaks after ?>) breaks because of
whitespace or indentation issues. It's hardly a big deal, but every
now and then the small deals make a big difference.

Let's not forget that SEO is search engine "optimization". Doing pretty 
good or even very good is not optimal, it's good or very good. You move 
to SEO when you want to be competitive i.e. purposefully take steps 
designed to get you to rank above the other guy.

I think that's why alot of "SEO advice" is useless. "Search engine 
friendly" is not SEO, it's good webmastering. In this case, doing what 
wordpress does because it hasn't hurt them is not SEO. In fact, 
Wordpress uses subdomains for it's own commercial purposes (not for the 
benefit of the bloggers) which is optimiation in the other direction as 
far as the blogger is concerned. Why try to be like Wordpress?

It is fact that your website will be ranked for it's "trustworthiness" 
if and when it is competitive in it's niche in the search engine results 
pages. That may involve many factors that Google has determined indicate 
trustworthiness. One thing that can hurt your trust weighting is being 
on server with spammers. Another is cross linking multiple sites on the 
same theme, which is easily detected if the sites have the same WHOIS 
data, use the same js or templates, or share the same IP or server. None 
of these are "triggers" as far as I know, but are factors for 
consideration when and if your site is considered for it's 
trustworthiness. That can happen when you achieve a top rank, or when 
somene questions your worth, or at other times. It can also happen 
automatically when the algorithms are tested or updated.

Hosting on one server matters if it impacts your performance, your 
apparent trustworthiness, or if you are doing anything sketchy and such 
hosting makes it easy to suspect that you are.

I forgot to menton that hosting your sites on one server exposes them 
for your competitors to see. That is probably more important than the 
other issues. Your competitors on the web are all over the globe, 
andhave many intricate agendas (clicking ads to cause trouble, for 
example).

There's a reason SOAP is no longer an acronym, but stands for SOAP. :)

SOAP vs. REST is a great example of both the benefits of abstractions,
and what happens when they leak.

Hi All,

I've been working with a Drupal team for a while now. I know there are
some good Joomla folk here on the list so the following article may be
of passing interest.
Anyway, here's the Drupal founder's latest performance tests:
http://buytaert.net/drupal-vs-joomla-performance

BTW - Drupal is only that much faster because of their cache for
non-logged in members.

If you&#8217;re using MSWord/Photoshop youwill love Visio. Word andPhotoshop are not vector drawing tools, Visio is and vector makes all thedifference. 

 

Vector drawing tools let you adjust, move,group and manipulate drawing &#8220;objects&#8221;. Every element in a vectordrawing program is separate and can be selected and adjusted.  You cangroup select lines, boxes, text etc., to move or make group them into other&#8220;objects&#8221; for further manipulation. You can make a selection oflines thicker, dashed, rounded etc. 

 

To get started I suggest it could behelpful to try and find a template. if you can find something close to what youwant it&#8217;s a good starting place. From the template make yourself a&#8220;personal template&#8221; (maybe a basic drawing) to work from. Then Iuse my &#8220;personal template&#8221; as I go forward.  Once I have allmy objects it&#8217;s easy sailing. 

 

I&#8217;ve used Visio for years to drawand visualize complex concepts and it does a great job allowing me to drawalmost any type of flowchart, block diagram, site map, map, object space etc. 

 

Visio can incorporate bitmap graphics andembed them into documents, if needed. Large projects with many pages aresupported. I have projects which an excess of 30 pages of detailed complexdrawings. Be careful though as Visio does slow down if you make your projectstoo big. It does require a powerful machine. 

 

There are other vector drawing tools suchas Dia (Linux) and Draw (Corel). I assume you are talking windoz with Word andPhotoshop. I tried to migrate to Dia but could not get my files converted satisfactorily.Years ago I used &#8220;Draw&#8221; which was acquired by Corel and then it wasrenamed. I liked Draw as it also was a vector drawing application with supportfor bitmaps. Draw must be out there somewhere in a later incarnation with a newname? Anyone?  

 

I bet you can use Adobe Illustrator andachieve the same goals. 

 

Good luck and happy drawing&#8230;

Awesome, thanks for the info!  I've used MM Freehand before which was ok but
still felt like there should be an easier way. I'll give visio a try again.
(Haven't used it in years).

If you are on a Mac - I recommend OmniGraffle. More fun than Visio IMO.

Message-ID: <6.2.3.4.2.20060813213348.026831d8@mail.optonline.net>

Investigating why the upcoming schedule for a client's Mets blog was
not displaying properly, I have observed the following:

This script:
<?php
echo strtotime( '8/13/2006' ) . '<br />';
echo strtotime( date( 'm/d/Y' ) );

when run at midday on 13 August on two different servers with php
4.3.9/ap 1.3.24 and php 4.3.11/ap 1.3.34 respectively, returns this:
1155441600
1155441600
(which I believe is indeed 13 August)

but when run on two other servers with php 5.0.5/ap 1.3.34 and php
4.3.11/ap 1.3.33 respectively, returns this:
1155452400
1155452400
(which I believe is actually 14 August)

So when the db contains 1155441600 for today's game, the server shows
tomorrow's game, but--this is really weird--identifies it as a Sunday
game. Does anybody have any ideas about what might be going on here?

The heredoc things make your code formatting look like crap.  You can
never indent properly.

Why, O' why does not php after all these years use the ELEGANT way
that perl uses the qq|blah,blah", ', $a, |  way of doing things?

I hate the mix of double quote, single quotes, back slashes, heredoc,
etc.  Just wondering? (sorry,kinda of anal about this, your source
code should look elegant, that's the deal with me!)  I hate to see a
mix of backslashes and quotes. Yuck!

"The qq Function for Long Strings in Perl
If you write CGI programs in Perl, you probably find yourself using a
lot of long print statements for outputting HTML. HTML uses a lot of
double quotes, so it's better if you don't have to escape every " you
use. You can accomplish this with the qq function, which will
interpolate all variables but ignores double quotes."

DST is, normally, somehow, at fault. Check your timezones.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Where to store credentials and/or keys
Message-ID: <44E0BADA.1040508@email.smith.edu>

Greetings listers (or is it listies?),

Following up on recent emails re. taking steps to secure code and data, 
I have a new question.

One issue is regarding where to store MySQL database credentials 
(uname,pwd).  The other is where to store an encryption/decryption key. 
  My situation also deals with operating in a shared hosted environment 
of sorts.

One solution recommended is to store code such as database credentials 
in a folder that is outside of the document root on the web server. 
Additionally, ask for the server admin to set permissions which will 
only allow access by my user account.

However, I am not sure if that protects it from php executing on that 
directory.  For example, if someone exploits another part of the server 
and gains the ability to access areas of the website by utilizing php 
code to traverse the file system and open documents, could they access 
that directory?

It seems like the answer is yes and therefore this solution has holes in it.

Comments appreciated on implementing this tactic and/or suggestion for 
alternative solutions.

I now have security books from Shiflett and Snyder/Southwell on my desk 
and have been going through them, but frankly I'm a bit jumbled with all 
the new topics so am hoping for some friendly pointers in the right 
direction.  Looming deadlines are producing some anxiety as well.  Sigh.

Thanks.

Unless your server is running suphp or some other method of executing
your scripts as 'your' user, all instances of php running under apache
will be run as the non-privileged apache user (www-data/nobody/???).

The idea of storing these types of things outside the web root is mostly
to defend against attacks that would result in this content being served
directly, which is a good thing to do, but not really what you're
talking about.

Basically, if you are on a shared server there is very little you can
really do to secure your database connection.

One possible solution would be to use ioncube or zend to encode your php
files, including the database details.  This will deter the casual
snooper, but with the right prodding your scripts will inevitably give
up access to either the login details or an active database connection.

Essentially this comes down to the fact that you cannot give any real
assurance of security unless you can trust the environment on the
machine, as any determined hacker with access to your scripts (encoded
or not) will be able to gain access to the data one way or the other,
whether it be by examining the source or executing the encoded script
and watching such things as defined functions, constants and variables,
and looking for any error output.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XCart, AMember and PHPBB
In-Reply-To: <44E0BADA.1040508@email.smith.edu>
Message-ID: <000d01c6bfd0$27992ad0$6901a8c0@Zoom>

I don't know if this is an appropriate topic for this list.  If not,
please forgive, and I'd love a point in the correct direction.  

I am posting this on the XCart discussion board, too, but I haven't had
much luck posting on that board. There has been conversation out there
about this topic, but it's been around asking XCart to please include
this functionality.  I can't wait for XCart to do it.  I gotta client.

So, what I'm trying to find out is does anyone have experience hooking
up XCart and AMember?

XCart has the capability to manage memberships, but as best we can tell,
the way it handles them isn't what our client wants.  It looks like they
handle them by having an annual renewal date that's the same for
everyone.  On initial signup, they pro-rate the remainder of the year.
We want the membership renewal dates to always be based on the signup
date.

Also, it also doesn't look like it includes any directory access control
functionality like AMember does.  We have the code to handle that
without AMember, but AMember does autoresponder functions, and other
stuff we like.

We'd go just with AMember, but this client is also selling hard goods.
AMember doesn't have the capability to manage inventory, sell multiple
quantities, charge shipping, and allow variants (color, size, etc.)

One additional wrinkle.  When the user buys a membership, what they're
supposed to be able to do is login to a member area where there's a
bunch of information (this is what they're paying for.)  They also want
a discussion board back there - so that login has to be hooked up to
everything else.

We're trying to provide:
A single point of purchase - I don't want someone to have to buy a
membership, and then separately buy goods.
A single point of login - I want someone to be able to login once, and
be logged into XCart, AMember (i.e. the member area), and the discussion
board.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle this.  I've figured out
where all the login code is for all three systems.  We have purchased
the plugin for PHPBB that AMember offers - this plug in logs into PHPBB
when you login to AMember.  BTW, the XCart plugin that AMember offers
only makes sure if you buy an AMember membership, you get a login to
XCart.  It's not a completely integrated plug in, which is why it's not
shown on the AMember site.

Should I be writing a plug in to do this?  If so, any sites that will
offer me good information for doing this?  I'd need one plug in to
handle the purchasing, and one to handle the login.

Is there a different, customizable shopping cart/membership system that
provides what XCart and AMember in combination might provide?  How have
other solved this?  Does someone out there have experience with this?

Again, if this is the wrong board to post this to, please let me know.
I don't live in NY, but I've been reading this list for awhile.  I've
learned a lot, so I'm hoping someone out there can point me in the right
direction.

Thanx for your time!

I wouldn't call this a solution, since it doesn't address the shared
hosting concerns at all, but includes should be kept outside of document
root anyway. Document root is for public resources that require their
own URL.

> I now have security books from Shiflett

Check out Chapter 8. It's all about shared hosting and addresses this
particular problem. It's also covered in the PHP Cookbook.

If you own neither, I have an old article on my web site that explains
it briefly (near the end):

Hope that helps.

Chris, thanks for the pointer, I just re-read that section of Chapter 8.

I haven't done Apache admin stuff and don't fully comprehend the 
VirtualHost block piece but I think I may understand the general idea.

Putting the include path in my block would ensure the $_SERVER variables 
are only accessible to PHP code that I run from my directories and 
wouldn't be available from PHP running from other directories on the server?

Also along those lines, if someone from another area of the server runs 
phpinfo() they won't see those $_SERVER vars?

I'm not sure how my admin has Apache set up, but I hope he's using 
VirtualHost blocks.  I also hope he knows what I'm talking about when I 
ask for this setup!  =)

Agreed, nice hack. :-)

If you use this method you should probably also disallow calls to
phpinfo() using the disable_functions configuration directive in
php.ini, see http://us3.php.net/manual/en/features.safe-mode.php#ini.disable-functions

As for decryption keys, I assume you mean the private key of a
public/private key pair? The private key should be stored on another
system, if possible, or protected by a strong passphrase that is
stored elsewhere.

Did I read that wrong, or is this only possible from inside php.ini and 
so not available to many shared hosting users?

Also, never underestimate the value of obfuscating the filename. Before 
anyone shouts "security thru obscurity is not security" let me state 
that obscurity is, indeed a form of security, although not a recommended 
means of providing security when there are better options available. 
Don't take my word for it, read the details of the security gurus. Of 
course if Chris or somebody slaps me here I'll defer.

Including a dbconnect.inc or whatever with incorrect (and never used) 
details while actually using dbconnect data that was encoded into some 
other file with a non-descript name might go a long way to deterring the 
script kiddies and opportunists. Repeating the obscurity thing, best 
first know why your best bet includes that obfuscation tactic, so you 
can 'splain yourself if you get hacked. I might use this to protect 
commercial data, but not ss#s and the like.

"Obfuscation as security".. has been beaten to death, (and as,
predominantly, an OpenBSD user, you know what I'll say) but..   

c'mon john.. a honey pot?  For what end?  Shits and giggles?  You are
usually spot on with your posts, but, I am of the opinion you wandered
off the trail here.  The fact that a honey pot can be found (or
was left to be found) shows a serious flaw in the app. 

Don't create and include a dbconnect.inc if you are not going to use it.
That is a flat-out bad practice.  If it were my shop, I would feel more
comfortable having developers concentrating on writing and implementing
a tight app.  Besides; extraneous files are annoying and confusing to
developers coming behind you. Oh, and, on the off chance a 'kiddie'
finds your honey pot -and discovers it is empty- he may get pissed off
enough to 'concentrate' on you rather than finding nothing and just
moving on; looking for easier prey.

Yeah well I knew there would be a slap from somewhere ;-)

I also know that my short term goals as a competitive webmaster don't 
always jive with the long term goals of a sysadmin, especially were 
standards and best practices come into play.

Honeypot...no. I was referring to a best practice db.inc where best 
practice (on a shared host, for example) still suffered vulnerabilities 
(out of site, out of root, etc yet accessible on a weakly-configured 
shared host). You've done what can be done on that host. Short of 
switching to another host, I'd obfuscate just as I usually buy odds at 
the craps table. If you are going to play, take advantage of what's 
available.

As for pissing off a cracker, that's not something I worry about as much 
as the opportunistic scanner or the kiddie who hijacked my neighbor's 
hosting password and is now traversing the tree for stuff to mess up or 
get free backlinks or looking for saleable information.

John, you are a respected colleague, but I'm not buying your logic
*here*.  Assessing risk and mitigating risk is something to be taken
seriously. I think we agree on that.  I'm not a fan of shared hosting
for any sort of serious business; just for the reason above. You can be
as strong as you want, but the weak link in that chain may well be your
neighbor.  

If one's business (and presumably livelyhood) depends on a web server
-and the above is the risk model- then shared hosting *should* be the
first thing chucked out the window. (This is where you say 'not an
option' and I quickly retort 'horse hockey') Dedicated/Managed hosting
is in reach for any serious business.  If a business can't afford it,
then don't do it. To wit.. If you *must* jump into shark infested
water, make the small financial investment and rent a shark cage. Those
are the odds that you can buy.  No amount of spray-on-shark-repellent
can compare to that... or even wearing an extra fake limb so the shark
will bite it thinking he 'got ya' and goes away.

Agreed, for that risk model, in most cases (but not all).

I think we will have to disagree here. The base cost of a managed 
hosting arrangement may be affordable, but dealing with the ... ahem... 
difficult personalities in the server room, may not be. Sure if you know 
your way around a server, you can "manage" a relationship with a 
sysadmin under a managed server arrangement. However, just as surely as 
greed corrupts, a naive small business owner may find herself paying for 
everything "extra" while still not keeping reasonable control of her 
"livelihood". I have counseled too many whose sites were practically 
hostage to the host or (worse) design firm pretending to be host  (gasp!).

I know your style, Michael, and I can assure you that integrity thing 
you insist on perpetuating is very, very rare out there.

Anyway, point much appreciated. Shared hostng is the first thing to 
re-consider when in need of security.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Shared host db credentials solution
Message-ID: <44E1F5BC.5030109@email.smith.edu>

OK, so I made the request to my IT department to implement the db 
credentials solution recommended in Essential PHP Security and the PHP 
Cookbook.  (Creating the db.conf and editing httpd.conf in order to 
create $_SERVER vars which contain the uname,pwd info.)

They sent an email back and I'm not sure how to respond due to my lack 
of Apache server experience.  Can folks give suggestions for a response?

They say:
In order for apache to be able to read the variables, the apache account 
will need access to it.  The problem with this is the most likely 
account to be compromised on websvr is the apache account.  At this 
point you have security thru obscurity - the person won't know where to 
look for the file, which makes it less likely to stumble upon it and 
figure out its importance.

Another possible solution would be to run a separate instance of apache 
to handle https, or possibly your own area - but we would have to look 
into the viability of that, and it won't be a short term solution (esp. 
with the August panic setting in).

You don't have your own VirtualHost area.  It might be worth trying in 
your own <Directory> area to see if that fulfills your needs.  Another 
way might be to put it in an .htaccess file - .htaccess files aren't 
just for password protecting areas!

Thanks for any suggestions.

They're probably just not thinking it through. If Apache is bound to
port 80, then it is running as root. This process can read the file, but
child processes (running as nobody or some other unprivileged user)
cannot. This has nothing to do with knowing the location of the file and
everything to do with file permissions.

> You don't have your own VirtualHost area.

Can you explain this or give us an example URL?

They were referring to the Virtual Host area in response to me saying 
that the Include /path/to/db.conf should be there.  That is when they 
suggested the alternative of putting it in my <Directory> or using 
htaccess.

A number of our departments are under the same domain and server and it 
sounds like Apache is not running any Virtual Hosts, at least not for my 
department.

So, the base URL is:
http://www.smith.edu/

My department is:
http://www.smith.edu/admission/
Everything within the admission directory is mine.

Another department sharing the server is at:
http://www.smith.edu/hr/

Hopefully that's helpful info.  As I may have mentioned, my Apache 
knowledge is almost nonexistent (which will change!).

But .htaccess files are globally readable, so any account on the
system can read it. That doesn't make any sense if they're worried
about people "hacking" the apache account.

Yeah, sounds like you need to use a <Directory> block to distinguish
your site from the others.

Thanks Adam and Chris.  We're setting up the .conf and attempting to

Just following up in case folks might be interested.  <Directory> did 
the trick.  I've verified that the _SERVER vars in the .conf file are 
available to my directory but not to others.

George's book Advanced PHP Programming is great, it covers design patterns
if i recall correctly,
i wrote a horrible review (my review was horrible, the book was great) a
while back:
http://www.preinheimer.com/index.php?/archives/210-Advanced-PHP-Programming.html

PHP|Architect's ProPHP course covers design patterns on the first day of 6,
so it's some covereage.

How do i unsubscribe to this talk list.
I went to php group it was useless. I am not a programmer or designer.
I am am a network admin and i had to solve the php dependency problem on my own. I now like debian sarge better than  fedora core because apt solves it's own php dependencies. still gave up on fedora core php install. not interested in designing or coding.

I'm not a network admin, but haven't have trouble compiling PHP to my
liking on Fedora 3 and 4. De gustibus non distupandum est or whatever.

This site has been very mortal-friendly (that's why I like it) though it's
now undergoing big changes:

http://www.phppatterns.com/docs/design/

It's reassuring when you -- sorry, when I -- discover that I was
intuitively thinking on the right track even when I didn't really know
what I was doing (e.g., "everyone who's done more than an hour of PHP has
implemented a Page Controller").

Visio is indeed a great place to start. If your going to be doing IA work
fulltime there are some very nice software apps that work with tablet PC's
that allow your to draw out your Interfaces and then have it export it as a
VISIO file for later processing. Its great for JAD sessions etc..

Awesome, thanks for the info!  I've used MM Freehand before whichwas ok but still felt like there should be an easier way. I'll give visio a tryagain. (Haven't used it in years).

If you're using MSWord/Photoshop you will love Visio. Word and Photoshop are notvector drawing tools, Visio is and vector makes all the difference. 

 

Vector drawing tools let you adjust, move, group andmanipulate drawing "objects". Every element in a vector drawingprogram is separate and can be selected and adjusted.  You can groupselect lines, boxes, text etc., to move or make group them into other "objects"for further manipulation. You can make a selection of lines thicker, dashed,rounded etc. 

 

To get started I suggest it could be helpful to try and finda template. if you can find something close to what you want it's a goodstarting place. From the template make yourself a "personal template"(maybe a basic drawing) to work from. Then I use my "personaltemplate" as I go forward.  Once I have all my objects it's easysailing. 

 

I've used Visio for years to draw and visualize complexconcepts and it does a great job allowing me to draw almost any type offlowchart, block diagram, site map, map, object space etc. 

 

Visio can incorporate bitmap graphics and embed them intodocuments, if needed. Large projects with many pages are supported. I haveprojects which an excess of 30 pages of detailed complex drawings. Be carefulthough as Visio does slow down if you make your projects too big. It doesrequire a powerful machine. 

 

There are other vector drawing tools such as Dia (Linux) andDraw (Corel). I assume you are talking windoz with Word and Photoshop. I triedto migrate to Dia but could not get my files converted satisfactorily. Yearsago I used "Draw" which was acquired by Corel and then it wasrenamed. I liked Draw as it also was a vector drawing application with supportfor bitmaps. Draw must be out there somewhere in a later incarnation with a newname? Anyone?   

 

I bet you can use Adobe Illustrator and achieve the samegoals. 

 

Good luck and happy drawing&#8230;

Hello all, 

 

I've been following the list now for a bit, lots of great discussion. 

 

I recently moved to NY from NH where I was doing php/mysql/c development for
a small start-up.

We had very detailed specs, excellent coding styles (use of includes, small
modular procedures and plenty of comments). 

Software was engineered first through a specification and given at least
'some' thought prior to implementation.

 

Now, starting my new job in NY I am at a larger company that is much more
successful than my last. However,

I am constantly running into files with no comments, spaghetti structure (or
non at all) limited includes (large amounts of duplicate code) and NO specs
what-so-ever on an extremely large project & database(s) with 100's of
stored procedures (again with no comments).

This effects my work directly as it takes unnecessarily long to become
familiar with the code that is spread across multiple files and templates
with no comments or structure.

 

So, my question is: Is it unreasonable of myself to have expectations of
'engineered' code or is this (current job) just the way things are.

Is it crazy to think I can change things from the bottom, by writing the
specs and speaking with the other programmers to reach a consensus on 'best
practices' and create 'grassroots' support? Should I just 'suck it up' and
put in my time, then move to another job?

 

I've been consulting along with my fulltime work for about 2 years now, and
I believe that is what I truly enjoy, being my own boss.

But I do need a paycheck every week, so this is not yet a viable
alternative.

 

Thanks for your time, I am eager to view your responses!

 

- Ben

I had the exact same experience.  The truth of the matter was stated very
precisely in the above two paragraphs, greater success can be achieved
with lower quality, by throwing out all of the time-consuming tasks from
your higher-quality previous experience.

This is often hard for programmers to understand, because we are idealists
and think everything should be perfect.  But Bill Gates did not become the
richest man in the world by delivering quality, he rushed garbage to
market because people will gladly choose garbage that's available today
over the promise of perfection tomorrow.

There are also complex political issues that serve to insulate decision
makers from the consequences of bad decisions.  An CTO cannot complain
that the vendor is handing him garbage because he'll lose his job for
picking the vendor.  The vendor has to protect the CTO by at very least
taking care of whatever issue may get him fired that day, and screw the
rest of it.

It works great if you are at a VP level or higher, but for everyone else
its hell.

Freelance is brutal!  (slightly off-topic)

Projects will ALWAYS take 10X longer then you think, the clients will
NOT pay you for all those extras hours unless you grovel.  Checks may
never appear. Health Insurance is astronomical on your own. And you'll
miss all those cool people you'll meet in the office setting _along
with the stability of a weekly check.

Why am I still a freelancer?

Looks sunny today, I think I'll take a bike ride, catch a movie, a
frosty brew and maybe a game of chess in the park.  I can hit the code
at 5 or 6 PM and work till 2 AM.

Life is kinda of short, isn't it? ENJOY it while you got it!

Hello again, 

Ed you make great points ( plus I'm a little jealous ). It appears I was
quite spoiled at my last job. 

Ken, I am discouraged by your examples because they are so true. But its
somewhat comforting to know that I am not alone.

Thank you for your responses. I believe I will try to acquire enough clients
that I no longer need a day job. That would be great.

In the mean time I'll try and make the best of the situation at hand.

- Ben

Freelance is brutal!  (slightly off-topic)

Projects will ALWAYS take 10X longer then you think, the clients will
NOT pay you for all those extras hours unless you grovel.  Checks may
never appear. Health Insurance is astronomical on your own. And you'll
miss all those cool people you'll meet in the office setting _along
with the stability of a weekly check.

Why am I still a freelancer?

Looks sunny today, I think I'll take a bike ride, catch a movie, a
frosty brew and maybe a game of chess in the park.  I can hit the code
at 5 or 6 PM and work till 2 AM.

Life is kinda of short, isn't it? ENJOY it while you got it!

If you were a lawyer, you would know how to bill your clients for that bike
ride, movie, brew, and chess -- of course, rounded up in the standard 15
minute increments, with expenses...

I think we finally have the definition for that elusive term, "enterprise"

Ben, if you're in the area next week, stop by at the meeting.  We're going
to be doing an open forum format (basically a NYPHP-Talk In-Person), and
this could be a good start to discussion.

I think, more often than not, you'll find that shops have poor practices
and barely readable code.  That seems to be the norm.

There's obvious value, of course, to having standards (even loose ones)
and structure (even a casual one) and to having best practices.  I think
selling your fellow developers on it won't be that hard - but you need
to get them to see the big picture, the long view, not just "but I've
got this project due tomorrow and I don't have time for comments!".  As
long as you are practical and take their concerns into account, they'll
listen.

As far as management?  From my experience, the best way to convince them
is to put together a business case.  It doesn't need to be on letterhead
and bound into a leather case, but it should provide a summary of the
project, and a fairly realistic view of the costs (and there will be
many, in terms of re-coding, documentation, etc.) and the benefits -
time saved in debugging, by avoiding recoding, etc.  Even better, break
it down step by step, for each aspect of the project, and show them how
each change will impact things.  At the end, give them an easily
digestible summary (yes, another one!), and keep it neat - tables or
charts are good.

Also, I'm a big fan of the skunkworks concept - next project you get,
write all of your code cleanly, document it, use includes, make it
modular, etc. and get the people working with you on it to do the same.
As you finish it, and get into debugging, adding features, etc. document
both how long it took you to write and how long it takes to maintain.
Document that vs. the messy stuff.  Chances are you'll have clear
numbers to support you and an actual practical example to present to
people.

In the end, people generally want to do things the "right way", but they
don't always know what that is - and they don't always like being told
that they're wrong.  The hardest part of this will be introducing it to
them gently in a fashion that doesn't put them off of it.  Don't focus
on proving that you're right - focus on selling them on it.  Make them
feel good about it, and make them feel good about supporting your ideas.
I know, icky, but it works, and it's a rare skill in a technical person.
;)

Hello again, 

Thank you Hans, I truly enjoy NY!

I would love to stop by the meeting next week. I do not see the event listed
on the homepage calendar; where can I go for details?

Sam, many good points as well. I'm still trying to wrap my head around
everything said/thought. I will send you an email off-list.

Thanks again everyone.

- Ben

Often, yes.  ;)

Implementing that sort of thing is difficult no matter where you
insert it *unless* you have the power to punish people for not
complying.  Then again, who'd want to work for you?

>From my experience - and yes, this is harsh - personal embarassment is
the best motivator.  Publish the coding standards, get everyone to
generally agree on the key points and then start having small code
reviews.  Choose one of your own modules, pass it out to a few of your
peers/subordinates/superiors and tear into it.  Then announce what the
next module to review will be.  When a few people see what you do to
your own code, they a) will be more likely to contribute and b) won't
want to suffer the wrath.  That's why starting with your own stuff is
key.

The goal isn't really to embarass people... after all, CodeMonkey not
crazy, just proud.  ;)

Even though the Andromeda presentation is in October, http://www.nyphp.org
still lists the correct location details.

I'll have an updated announcement about this month's presentation online
soon, too.

If you can get across how doing things 'right' will make everyone's
lives easier in real concrete terms (e.g. "how long did it take to
figure out wtf was going on when you had to debug x yesterday?"), you
may find it a much easier sell.

Depending on your situation, the security of the system can also be a
source of leverage, effectively auditing and securing a system is much
easier when it is cleanly laid out.  Any system dealing with client
details (especially financial details) can be a huge liability if it is
not effectively secured.

This is also a great idea, a little confrontational at first but very
useful if there are a few stragglers once the majority are on board.

Hello again, 

Great points all, Keith, Nicholas and Dan. I've read both 'Joel on software'
and 'Best software practices' which speak of many items I am having issues
with.

I began last month keeping track of every task assigned, the amount of time
and why something took longer than anticipated. I often find I waste 40-60%
just becoming familiar with the code, or finding some strange 'feature' that
Was depedenent on a script I just changed. With 'backward compatibility'
support no comments and duplicate code, script changes are similar to
mind-field sprints.

So, I have been preparing for a bit now, and I know the general mindset
among my fellow developers is that they do want 'more structure'. I've often
Heard and been in discussion with others regarding these very same issues.

Well said.

Turns out, since there is no one function used for input validation, I
easily performed SQL injection attacks on nearly any form, plus url params.
Very bad stuff.

>This is also a great idea, a little confrontational at first but very
>useful if there are a few stragglers once the majority are on board.

I am hoping this will hold true. This has motivated me to start with my
peers and hopefully management will realize it is helping everyone, it's a
win-win situation.

I think, more often than not, you'll find that shops have poor practices
and barely readable code.  That seems to be the norm.

There's obvious value, of course, to having standards (even loose ones)
and structure (even a casual one) and to having best practices.  I think
selling your fellow developers on it won't be that hard - but you need
to get them to see the big picture, the long view, not just "but I've
got this project due tomorrow and I don't have time for comments!".  As
long as you are practical and take their concerns into account, they'll
listen.

As far as management?  From my experience, the best way to convince them
is to put together a business case.  It doesn't need to be on letterhead
and bound into a leather case, but it should provide a summary of the
project, and a fairly realistic view of the costs (and there will be
many, in terms of re-coding, documentation, etc.) and the benefits -
time saved in debugging, by avoiding recoding, etc.  Even better, break
it down step by step, for each aspect of the project, and show them how
each change will impact things.  At the end, give them an easily
digestible summary (yes, another one!), and keep it neat - tables or
charts are good.

Also, I'm a big fan of the skunkworks concept - next project you get,
write all of your code cleanly, document it, use includes, make it
modular, etc. and get the people working with you on it to do the same.
As you finish it, and get into debugging, adding features, etc. document
both how long it took you to write and how long it takes to maintain.
Document that vs. the messy stuff.  Chances are you'll have clear
numbers to support you and an actual practical example to present to
people.

In the end, people generally want to do things the "right way", but they
don't always know what that is - and they don't always like being told
that they're wrong.  The hardest part of this will be introducing it to
them gently in a fashion that doesn't put them off of it.  Don't focus
on proving that you're right - focus on selling them on it.  Make them
feel good about it, and make them feel good about supporting your ideas.
I know, icky, but it works, and it's a rare skill in a technical person.
;)

Some lawyers for whom I did back end work round up bill 7
minutes for any
simple task. For example to leave a quick voice mail message.
That way they
easily billed 3 hours for 1 hour.

If you were a lawyer, you would know how to bill your clients
for that bike
ride, movie, brew, and chess -- of course, rounded up in the
standard 15
minute increments, with expenses...

Be careful.  I just picked up a very nice client from a guy who was 
working as a moonlighter.  The client experienced a huge upswing in 
business and told his evenings/weekends guy, "I don't have time for 
this, I need somebody who works during business hours." 

Paradox:  You'll never have enough clients to quit your job until after 
you quit your job to go get the clients.

Ken you are right, and this is an issue I've been struggling with.

Sometime soon I will make the jump, but I am determined to make the best of
current situation. Thanks for the headsup!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Working with openssl
Message-ID: <44E49752.2070200@email.smith.edu>

I've been reading and am trying to work with the openssl code example 
given in Pro PHP Security.  It works smoothly when I run the demo code 
on my server which generates a public and private key and encrypts and 
decrypts a small bit of text.

However I run into errors when trying to test it in a manner that starts 
to simulate a production environment.

How I'm testing:
1.  Run the openssl demo code, which creates a public and private key 
and encrypts a small amount of text.
2.  On a separate page I have created a form that I use to copy and 
paste the private key, encrypted text and passphrase.
3.  Post the form which is coded to create a new openssl object and pass 
it the private key and attempt to decrypt.  This produces errors:

Warning: openssl_private_decrypt() [function.openssl-private-decrypt]: 
key parameter is not a valid private key in 
/home/a/adm1a/openSSL/openSSL.php on line 119

Warning: openssl_free_key() expects parameter 1 to be resource, null 
given in /home/a/adm1a/openSSL/openSSL.php on line 122

Here are the testing pages:

OpenSSL Demo
http://www.smith.edu/admission/openSSL/openSSLdemo.php
Form testing page (passphrase is 'Encryption is fun for everyone')

True.  Still, something like this, you'd expect to hear about it from 
some other sources in addition to the "Talk Like a Canadian" people.  :-)

Also, see google here:
<http://www.google.com/search?q=Microsoft+Purchases+Zend+for+%24113+Million&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official>

And, interestingly, nyphp-talk here:
http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2006-April/018230.html

Does get one's attention on first viewing, though, dunnit?

Hi Aaron --

Nothing jumps out immediately, but to help debug the problem you
should probably try with an unecrypted private key at first.
openssl_get_privatekey() returns that invalid key error if it can't
decypt the key for some reason.

Hi Chris,

I removed passphrase from the demo class calls and the test form.  Upon 
testing it produced the same error:

Warning: openssl_private_decrypt() [function.openssl-private-decrypt]: 
key parameter is not a valid private key in 
/home/a/adm1a/openSSL/openSSL.php on line 119

Warning: openssl_free_key() expects parameter 1 to be resource, null 
given in /home/a/adm1a/openSSL/openSSL.php on line 122
Testing OpenSSL

It doesn't like my key, I'm not sure why.  This time around I ran the 
key and encrypted text through a text editor before entering in the form 
to make sure there weren't any invisible characters it was picking up. 
Hmmmm.

Here's how I got openssl_get_privatekey() to work:

$private_key = array("file://" . $path, $passphrase);
$private = openssl_get_privatekey($private_key);

Hope that helps.

There were some mistakes on pages 95, 96, and 98, described in the 
errata at http://apress.com/book/errataDisplay.html?bID=437&sID=3419. 
Chris tells me that you do have updated code, however, so the 
previous is more in the nature of a general reminder to everybody 
than a possible solution for you, alas.

It does?  I visited those pages, ran it and got the same error:

Warning: openssl_private_decrypt() [function.openssl-private-decrypt]:

Aaron,
Your test page worked for me... you need to include "-----BEGIN RSA 
PRIVATE KEY-----" and "-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----" as well as the 
data and don't have any whitespace or linebreaks after "-----END RSA 
PRIVATE KEY-----"

Perhaps you weren't copying the entire key or something?

Rob and Chris, thanks very much.  I was not copying the entire key.  I 
was copying the text in the middle, as opposed to starting with 
"------BEGIN" and ending with "------END", etc.

I thought the other text was labeling and did not realize it was part of 
the key itself.

Many thanks, I feel just a tad foolish, but I guess that's how one 
learns sometimes.  =)

Much appreciated, thanks for the help guys!

-Aaron

wow looks like i cought on to that one way too late lol.

glad to see that it was a joke.  I was wondering how they could sell an open
source project and figured there had to be something fishy about it.

No worries. The prefix and suffix are there to define the key, and are
added as part of the PEM encoding.

As Michael mentioned, we had a few bugs in that code before, so I'm
glad it's working.

um...I think it's called "externalizing expenses" actually. Do your job 
and don't worry about what is not specifically your job. If the rest 
doesn't get done, it wasn't your fault. Sometimes it seems to me 95% of 
the profit in a project is gained from externalizing hidden costs, not 
from the project itself.

Define "garbage". Are you selling what you know to be good, or what the 
customers know is good? The former will bankrupt you; the latter may 
disappoint you.

Well said.  And that came about not by design, but via evolution. In 
order to survive, those managers developed that system of insulating 
decisions and spreading accountability. What have the programmers 
evolved in order to survive? Sometimes it seems like  dark rooms, and 
poor social habits to keep the managers out of their caves. 
Unfortunately that only increases the pressure to keep up, and further 
helps commoditize the programmer's job (we never see him ayway, so why 
not outsource overseas?).

Do your job and do it well and make sure you stay involved outside (like 
NYPHP) and move alot and eventually you earn your rep and can choose 
where to work. That seems to be the way. I definitely have not seen any 
success evangelizing within the profitable corporation you describe, as 
all you will be doing in the eyes of non-programmers is making waves and 
increasing costs. Make sure that when there is an attack, it wasn't on 
your code, and when they audit, your code comes clean. Anytime you find 
you cannot do a proper job (time constraints, etc) find a way to 
externalize the decision to leave it insecure... commonly known as 
passing the buck/creating a paper trail. There's nothing wrong with 
allowing the organization to make a decision that is not optimal from 
any one perspective -- I think that is the definition of a compromise.

And well said as well.  In addition to your advice below I would add 
this, watch what the company is doing very carefully so that you can 
adopt these practices when you go out on your own.

What separated my employers from me, the reason I worked for them and 
not the other way around, was that the top guys were all salesmen of one 
stripe or another.  I realized that if I did not embrace sales I would 
not move out of where I was.  There were others, but the idea is to keep 
your eyes open, because if they are paying you then they must know 
something you don't, and there's no reason not to learn while you earn.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Active Persistent Links..
Message-ID: <44E5C51F.4040704@musicpf.org>


I am in the process of moving a  site that  contains a lot of php with 
mysql.  I was getting some errors that led me to the fact that the 
php.ini values for the old site were: mysql.allow_persistent =ON, Active 
Persistent Links = 2, Active Links = 2.  For the new site, these were: 
mysql.allow_persistent=OFF, Active Persistent Links = 0, Active Links = 0.

Does anyone  know the "correct/safe or standard" values for these 
settings and what I need to look for in my code when changing this from 
ON to OFF.  The errors I receive are per a class called 'user' which 
refers to data in a mysql table of the same name.  I realize this is 
somewhat vague but any thoughts or recommendations would be much 
appreciated.  Thanks.

The command to look for is mysql_pconnect. If you need to change code, 
you will likely need to change more than just the pconnect. It's 
probably safe and easier to enable it in the php.ini

upon (read as criticize or complain') about failed job tasks or fractured
plans in a non-specialist corporate environment. 
 
[But note that Dale Carnegie in his book "How to Win Friends and Influence
People, said "Remember the 3 C's: never condemn, criticize or complain."]
 
When noting an ineffective office policy, a bad project plan,
under-budgeting, wrongheaded timelines, lack of peer cooperation -- it is
helpful to couch your comments as what I think of as "encased in third-party
effects". 
 
Don't criticize the faraway parent company or your local company office,
don't "gotcha" the manager, don't blindside an associate -- always "blame"
the system(s) only, and only with dispassionate third-party style
references. 
 
For example, say things roughly like so: 
 
"An under adherence to code commenting can cause decrease in access to
legacy knowledge base items and hard won baseline techniques." 
or 
"A missing backup policy that poses even minor data loss can stall any
project in any time frame at any facility and probably cost valuable company
funds." 
or 
"Distributed staffers experiencing communication lag -- and this can happen
at any fast-paced company like ours -- can derail a precision deadline
sometimes even by hours." 
or 
"Very valuable corporate monies can be lost when fast-start strategies don't
hold up under long term executions that demand larger perspectives and more
encompassing parameters." 
or 
"The predictable changeover of programming staff -- really any highly mobile
staff -- might benefit immensely from even the most schematic transferable
documentations that inform new team members, bringing all users up to speed
and saving critical company dollars as projects propel themselves more
effectively."
 
Because no one likes to be attacked, but typically most people want to be
seen as fair minded, embrace this concept from the book entitled "How to
Deal with Difficult People". It is highly recommended that you couch
difficult recommendations with smoothing universal lead off comments such
as:  "It is fair to say...", "Likely most can agree...", "Third parties
might observe..."

Subject: [nycphp-talk] General Q; Programming Jobs & Expectations



Hello all, 

 

I've been following the list now for a bit, lots of great discussion. 

 

I recently moved to NY from NH where I was doing php/mysql/c development for
a small start-up.

We had very detailed specs, excellent coding styles (use of includes, small
modular procedures and plenty of comments). 

Software was engineered first through a specification and given at least
'some' thought prior to implementation.

 

Now, starting my new job in NY I am at a larger company that is much more
successful than my last. However,

I am constantly running into files with no comments, spaghetti structure (or
non at all) limited includes (large amounts of duplicate code) and NO specs
what-so-ever on an extremely large project & database(s) with 100's of
stored procedures (again with no comments).

This effects my work directly as it takes unnecessarily long to become
familiar with the code that is spread across multiple files and templates
with no comments or structure.

 

So, my question is: Is it unreasonable of myself to have expectations of
'engineered' code or is this (current job) just the way things are.

Is it crazy to think I can change things from the bottom, by writing the
specs and speaking with the other programmers to reach a consensus on 'best
practices' and create 'grassroots' support? Should I just 'suck it up' and
put in my time, then move to another job?

 

I've been consulting along with my fulltime work for about 2 years now, and
I believe that is what I truly enjoy, being my own boss.

But I do need a paycheck every week, so this is not yet a viable
alternative.

 

Thanks for your time, I am eager to view your responses!

 

- Ben

Further when one must finally put their finger right on some ill-conceived
execution plan or even more ghastly finger precisely another responsible
department or a single person, just leave out all personal pronouns -- no
matter how tempting to be more precise, no matter how easy to push closer to
the bone. Don't use any pronouns like "I, Me, You, Us, We, Them". Say: "The
company flagged on commenting code...", "The company can benefit from...",
The company has an issue here that...", "The company can not unwind fast
enough...", "The system in place causes...", "The company can generate a
stalling effect upon..."
 
"Glasnost, baby."

Well, Peter, I don't disagree that such subtle literary tweaks as double 
negatives and references to the sub-optimal status of pilot-less 
endeavors soften the blow of due criticism, but they don't fix the 
problems, either. Sometimes, stupid is stupid. Sometimes the kettle 
really is black, the ball was actually dropped, and the culprit really 
should be hung out to dry *if* "the company" cares to improve things for 
next time.

Of course there is a time and place for each approach to professional 
life. Were it not for the corporate speak, the layers of obfuscation 
created by "management", and the subsequent inability of many such 
"organizations" to effect change, there would be no need for independent 
consultants (you know, the ones who are brought in to get the job done).

I propose to you that the same ancient Dale Carnegie stuff you cite, 
along with the ineffective "play nice" prefixes to what would otherwise 
be leadership statements, have contributed to the sad, unaccountable 
corporations we have ruling the world today. If no one takes 
responsibility,  no one is responsible. The damage done by "the 
corporation" as a whole cannot be challenged. Sadly, if most of the 
players play that game, either everyone has to play or there is 
disharmony. It is hardly accurate to blame that disharmony on the 
honest, albeit "less sensitive" employees. yes, i do recognize that in 
today's world, the losers are winning.

I also propose that the same corporate double-speak leads inevitably to 
unfair, mob-like behavior when finally change is truly required for 
survival. Someone gets to be the "scapegoat", "hung out to dry" and 
"heads roll" where IN FACT the heads that roll were not actually 
resonsible for the problem. Had the proper steps been taken when the 
kettle was noticed to be in fact black, there would be no need for the 
unfair (and IMHO immoral) mob behavior.

Some of us choose to work outside of that (IMHO corrupt and corrupting) 
system.Others seem to choose to run with it, despite the apparent fact 
that there is an unsavory backlash brewing that our grandchildren will 
have to deal with.

>From a non coder perspective...

Welcome to the land of the enterprise! We are a business driven sector that seldom listens to technical reason. I've had serious compliance patching shot down by people that don't even understand the issues nor ask about them.

However, all is not lost! Here are the guidelines I use as an SA.

1. I choose whether or not I do a good job. My boss decides what the objectives are and I will work hard to achieve those goals. If I can make something more useful *and* meet corporate objectives I do so.

2. A helpful person is better than a smart one. The office is full of people who want to seem smart. I prefer to explain and educate, hopefully helping my co-workers smarter than me so I don't get paged in the middle of my beauty sleep. When my operators solve issues my life is better.

3. This day will never return and your work has spent money on the assumption you have a current skill set. So set up a few minutes here and there to be learning something new or practicing rusty skills. Not only will it keep you fresh but you may need that skill down the road.

I'll add Peter's great suggestions. Read "The 7 habits of highly effective people". My number 2 on the books most positively influential. After that read "What color is your parachute", number 3. You may want to better understand the work environment you thrive in next time you look for a job.  :)

ciao!

And when you think you got it all under control . . .

Everything compiles on the first try, you're 100% compliant, your
mistress is great, the kids get you presents, the rent is paid, the
bank account is overflowing, the STD test comes back negative, the new
guy that tears apart your code is caught flirting with the boss's
wife, ahhhhhhhh,  what else can go right!

then it's always time for that infamous refresher web check-in break!

January 23 for me, I suspect a serious cold that goes bad!  :-)

I think what is really important is that if you are going to take on 
the task of change, you then find yourself becoming a "change agent". 
Sometimes a company will hire someone for this sole purpose. This 
request sometimes comes from the top management or the middle 
management. While this might seem like the ideal way to bring about 
change, it is also met with many of the same concerns.

When the web was new, many companies didn't have a web site and were 
not even using e-mail. They would look for a person to hire who knew 
coming in that they would be a change agent. They were informed that 
coming into something like this, that there was going to be people who 
1)Didn't want to change, 2)Saw the change as a threat, 3)Needed to be 
persuaded to make this change happen, 4)May make you unpopular during 
this change.

As for #1 & #2, sometimes no amount of carefully worded speak and 
actions are going to win those people over, which can cause #4. The 
thing to do is to focus on #3. You must be #3 to be successful. I have 
seen this first-hand.  For example, where one developer would get 
excited about an idea and before you know it, even to the detriment of 
the company he had eight other developers working on this new idea. The 
point of this is that if you are going to take on the task to be a 
successful change agent, you need to be persuasive to get buy-in from 
people so they are excited about doing this. The moment you start to 
accomplish this, others unofficially become change agents too.

Hey Folks:

Rather than focusing on the costs of refactoring, focus on the costs 
the current situation incurs such as the long time to get up to speed, 
insecurity and fragility.

Also, I'd propose that the improved practices initially get put in 
place for future work rather than immediately pushing for refactoring.

Regarding John's point about calling kettles black, it sounds like all 
of the programmers there are covered in soot.  Seems the 
non-accusatory means may be an easier approach.

On large projects there are always 10% to 15% clumsiness in code etc.,  
since all cooks (developers) are not having same level of skills. However  
this should not be because any kind of large project must have certain  
level of programming standards which every developers must follow in any  
case no matter how much it severely effects his/her own personal style or  
methods.

It has to be and will take more in future. Personally I would never work  
on such projects unless there is no scope of bringing improvements.

Your demand is not unreasonable AT ALL. In fact that should be correct way  
of development of any project. But in your case your project might be in  
hands of unskilled developers at the time of development or later at  
certain stage and later they didn't correct it at regular intervals.

You can try (I mean correcting code and writing specs.), but it wont bring  
shiny results, because improvements will be bits and pieces. Moreover if  
your co-workers are not willing to accept your changes, you will  
constantly struggle with them first and then yourself because you can't  
change it quickly. So every time you open such file during your work,  
first thing will come up in your mind will be like "grrh....same file  
again, how to change it to make it more readable by adding comments,  
improving coding style etc." But it is not going to happen since your  
small changes will not solve whole problem. Personally I advice to look  
for other job if possible. Why because even if you "suck it up" for time  
being, your inner self (perhaps your "passion") will, at one stage, force  
you to get out of current working environment and if you don't do it will  
severely effect your whole career and life. Reason behind this assumption  
is that You seems Quality minded passion driven person where you  
constantly thrive to Improve your surroundings for "Good" (code,  
co-workers etc.).

To me better options, or perhaps a chance to show your skills, is to  
present your proposal to your higher management about the changes that you  
want to bring in the project your are working in. Prepare in-depth  
analysis of your study and present it to them. Of course you will need  
consent of other programmers to support your proposal. Your proposal can  
contain changes that you want to bring in software and why they are  
required, What steps to be taken to implement those changes, how much time  
and cost will it take and finally how it will can beneficial to the  
company. If this clicks then you will get chance to work like you want to,  
and you might be promoted to position of Project Manager because such  
changes are part of better project management, otherwise you will likely  
to have troubles in current environment that you have described here.

This is the crucial point on which you need to think again and again and  
to find better solution. Having required paycheck by having job in other  
company will fulfil your monetary requirements, but how about your SELF  
which is against your current working environment. Also remember the rule  
"Either change things that you feel are not proper or change yourself if  
there is no option."

Subject: [nycphp-talk] FPDF, FPDI error in IE on PC
Message-ID: <44E9C8EF.8060207@email.smith.edu>

Greetings,

I have FPDF and FPDI working beautifully with every browser EXCEPT for 
Internet Explorer on PC.

I have the Output method specified to "I" to load in the browser.  When 
I try to view the pdf in IE it gives me a "File Download - Security 
Warning" box with the option to open or save the file.  Clicking either 
one produces an error message saying that IE cannot download the file.

Considering a fair amount of users will be on IE it is very important 
for me to fix this issue.

Has anyone run into errors diplaying the generated PDF in Internet 
Explorer?  Thoughts, suggestions?

Thanks,

-Aaron

I have had similar issues in the past and as I remember, it had to do
with cache setting, try 'session_cache_limiter ('private');' before any
other output (e.g. start_session ())

Morning all,

Lots of great emails to read this morning when I got in. Thanks for all your
thoughts!

So many good points in this last one, I'm sure where to start.

1) If I had known it was so unorganized I would not have taken the job. Next
time I will ask to see source samples and speak more with the project
managers I'll be working with.

2) I am currently working on a spec, speaking with other developers and a
proposal. Along with documenting my time and issues. I hope to make change
for the better of "the company" = ]

3) I try to clean-up code as I see it, but its exhausting.

As stated, I will suck it up for the time being, but believe I am looking
for a new job soon. </rant>

Again, many great points. I saved the previous emails and will be referring
to them for advice in the future!

- Ben

Message-ID: <4b1887110608211856y5bfd8261l93c07057b5dd9aa0@mail.gmail.com>

I'm been developing PHP too long. I think I'm starting to become
jealous of Java. No I'm just kidding, however...

Anyone have any good luck/package recommendations for integrating a
Java drag & drop w/progress bar within a PHP application. My trouble
is that I need to be able to upload, then add database rows to relate
the files to database records.

I am trying to build a document management systems for Word files,
PDFs, Powerpoint, etc. My client requires upload progress notification
and would like to have d&d if possible.

Also, if anyone knows of a good package to integrate, that I don't
have to write, I'll take those comments as well :-)

Thanks in advance for your comments.

I'd used RadLinks (http://www.radinks.com/downloads/upload.php) in the past
for a couple projects with reasonable success, though the process of loading
(and confirming) a java application can really send inexperienced users for
a loop.  The worst end being that it wouldn't load in the browser Every time
(loaded properly about 80% of the time by my completely estimated
calculation).

On an up-and-coming project, I've been considering flash's newly gained file
upload capabilities.  Here's an interesting example:

http://www.tink.ws/blog/files/flash8/FileReferenceExample.html

Adobe's tutorial (using php):

http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=464427&rl=1

I'm guessing it might be easier to use and especially customize, but then
again I have a Lot more flash experience than Java.

Good Luck!

I gave up on this and went with WebDAV (aka Web Folders in Windows).
Explorer and Finder already know drag and drop, and even though
neither provides a nice progress bar there are free third-party
clients that do.

Might be a little too radical for your client, but definitely has
advantages over Java.

This does sound somewhat promising.

Unfortunately I need to tie these files to database records.

Thanks for the comments. I would love to be able to do it in pure PHP
just for fun. For example, if I could write a drag&drop PHP GTK
application and somehow package it for deployment. But it seems
logistically problematic to get GTK libraries, PHP, and the required
PHP extensions packaged together. Phing looks cool, but even then you
already need a working PHP installation. I suppose I could write
script that does the install that would work but it wouldn't be
pretty. Or I could another language altogether. :-)

Don't sweat it.  RSVP and bring photo ID.  Even if you don't make the 
official list, they'll let you in.

I am looking for software to allow us to send quaterly emails to
our investor and clients(500 users).  The software should allow
the users to sign up or sign out of the list.  The direction of the
messages should just go from us to our clients.
I will be looking at majordomo and mailman but I was wondering
if you guys know of something else out there spcially in perl or PHP

There was recently a topic about this started on the php.internals 
newsgroup.  For lack of a better way to link to the topics, (I'm aware 
of news.php.net, but it's not threaded and I don't have the time to link 
to all emails in the thread), I'll summarize a few snippets here.


-- thread starter "steve" (http://news.php.net/php.internals/25250)--
We do a "web 2.0" type upload, and show a spinner. When the file is
large or the connection slow, people sometimes abort thinking that
there was a problem. I'd like to show a progress bar. Is this possible
yet? Which version? I can't use perl on these servers (PHP only), so
I'm SOL. I've used a patch before, but a client does not want to use a
hacked up PHP on production servers.
--

-- response from Rasmus --
The patch to support this is in PHP 5.2 CVS now.

So basically, as of 5.2 there will theoretically be a way to get 
feedback on file uploads from PHP, although it may still require another 
extension.

take a look at klorofil (i think that's what it is called, check google)
it's similar to php-gtk except it seems easier to use and has nice windows
looking dialogs it wouldnt look all GTKish ;)

I figured that. This is gonna sound really crazy, but you can use the
PROPSET method to add an id to the file's metadata. This works
out-of-the-box with Apache2.

You could also implement the whole WebDAV server in PHP and track ids
internally. A big job, to be sure, but possibly easier than deploying
a PHP+GTK front-end. Then again, maybe not. :-)

If you happen to have to work on a remote server (yes, we know god
uses vi), but just in case, my frustration with Textmate as I've
lamented before (it's very sluggish on a remote mounted server), I've
taken a new look at TextWrangler: it's  FAST over a wireless
connection from the woods of Northern NYS out to dreamhost __LIKE
super fast, just in case you're into experimenting like I am.

You may want to give it a try. It's also free I see, since it's so
lightweight, they just give it away.

For now, I'll stick with TW, my next experiment is VIM with Xwindows
on my Mac.  More to follow . . .

Hi Nestor,

Try Civimail from civicspace labs (it's an open source/free Drupal
plugin) or SugarCRM.
Both are PHP based.

So far the easiest to install for me have been pommo and phplist
I installed pommo and it work and phplist demo works like pommo.

I look at CiviSpace and their mailing list is based on phplist.

I tried:
Majordomo kept returning a "-1 CGI Error" and the solution was to install
again and recompile.
Mailman which is python kept giving me a CGI error like when you do not have
proper
access priviledges in your cgi-bin but when I added a perl file to the same
directory the perl would work.
I do not know python and I needed the info before Friday because I am
heading to Europa.

Thanks for all the replies,

N?stor :-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Zend Framework 0.1.5 - Scarce Hosting Support
Message-ID: <44ECA5FB.6070002@mollentze.co.za>

I have been looking for a couple of days for an affordable hosting plan 
capable of hosting Zend Framework 0.1.5. There are really very 
permissive hosting solutions out there (very gracious allowances for 
shared hosting) - The main problem, however seems to be that they mostly 
support PHP 5.1.2 ('cause that's *still* the latest stable package of 
PHP5 for many Linux Distro's). As you all know, ZF 0.1.5 requires 
PHP5.1.4. So, anyone out there that can recommend an affordable ZF 0.1.5 
friendly host, that will allow multiple "commercial" (non-personal) 
sites on the same account? (The last bit of the previous sentence is 
what disqualified Site5.com for my needs, I really wanted to go with 
them, but they dropped their reseller program until further notice. On 
their current plans you may only host websites that you own yourself). 
A2hosting seems good, but they are not really competitivly proced if you 
see what's out there these days.

Anyways, any recommendation(s) will be very much appreciated.

Thanks,
Werner

Hi Werner,

Get a VPS host where you have root on FC5 (fedora core 5) which has PHP
5.1.4.

NetworkRedux (http://www.networkredux.com) has PHP 5.1.4 support.  It
seems that they keep up with PHP/mySQL releases.

I've only been with them two days, so I can't really attest to their
quality but from what I've seen they've got their act together.  And
the people who referred me to them were enthusiastic about their
service.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Parsing webpages & submiting form data w/PHP
Message-ID: <001001c6c789$264968f0$6400030a@brainiac>

Hello all, 

 

I'm currently working on an open source application in c (linux/win) that
will be used for a number of things.

One item is parsing web pages to retrieve data and submit data to pages via
forms and the URL.

 

The c application can execute scripts and pass arguments to those scripts
AND receive the complete data or error status from these scripts back into
the c application.

 

For speed of development Id like to implement the web parsing/submitting in
PHP and then maybe recode in c if necessary.

 

I've looked into curl, and a few other scripts I've seen, but I've had
strange timeout issues with CURL in PHP.

I'm curious if there is a tried and recommended class or group of procedures
I could use to do this (excluding curl).

 

I understand the web parsing is subjective; there will not be a one size
fits all. Is it best to read in an entire webpage as raw html and then
search it?

 

Could I break it into xml and then parse it? Should I read in chunks, parse
those and continue?

What experiences has anyone had with is?

 

Also cookie handling would be a plus, as well as https in whatever class or
library is recommended.

 

Thanks, 

 

- Ben.

Message-ID: <A0C6799A47EA3647B5BE6E036FAD9F0D01F589B6@dc1.omniloans.com>

Hello Everyone,

I was wondering if any mac users out there have gotten their PHP
installation to point to a fresh libxml2 (not the older version 2.6.16
that comes with OSX 10.4...  ) No matter where I point to in my
configure string, it only recognizes the 2.6.16 version... I've tried
using darwin ports, as well as compiling my own  libxml2... But no
luck... Also, put the new libxml2 dir at the beginning of my path, no
luck either... Any help would be much appretiated...?

be a bit more specific OOP leads to a large topic ;)

do you mean introduction, or in depth that will lead to OOA/D and design
patterns?

Beginning i liked Core PHP Programming (3rd Ed. i think was revised for PHP
5)
after that i moved to PHP 5 Objects, Patterns, and Practice
i also looked into Head First Design patterns (based on java but very easy
to read and interpret into PHP)
and now i am onto Applying UML and Patterns (Introduction to OOA/D &
Iterative Development)

Thanks a bunch Andrew..  I actually just fixed it but maybe that was the
cause of the problem. For some reason, after ./configure, the makefile
had the wrong path to the libxml2's include directory (had the old
one).. Once i changed that before running make, everything worked
fine... weird stuff..  thanks again...

I'll throw out an initial list/ideas ...

* - Proper method on setting up a single cake installation + multiple  
projects (via bake)
* - Dealing w/ legacy databases
* - Fragment caching
* - Any other advanced debugging techniques (like pr($this- 
 >_viewVars) in View)

On a side note, it would be great to see nice JQuery/Cake integration  
somehow (via helper or other means), but was great to see this  
conversation happening ...

Looking forward to the talk.

YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! Bravo! I'll travel all the way from downtown for
this!

You know that folks who are totally new to this are gonna want a lightning
intro to MVC, likewise associations.

I would love to see you bake a little app before our very eyes with
bake.php (I can't wait to hear all the oooohs and aaaaaahs)

I'd like to find out how you handle advanced input validation and
filtering. (The jury seems to be out about the proper way to apply
multiple validation rules to one field.)

I'd like to see how you approach authentication.

I'd like to see an introducation (that was a typo, but I like it) to ACL.

I'd like to see how you write a model and controller that would support
"advanced" database searching (from the users point of view), meaning
building SELECTs on the fly from user input

I'd like to know how you approach integration with a popular CMS such as
Drupal.

I'd like to hear your recommendations regarding hosting Cake apps on a
shared server running PHP 5 in cgi mode.

I'd like to hear about what we might expect in future releases.

We have how long for this, just six hours? (-:

Following up on David's point, don't forget that there are likely to 
be people there who will need to hear from the beginning what is 
going on.  You can do this briefly so as not to bore those who know 
it already, but you also don't want to bore those others by 
discussing nothing but advanced details.

Man I miss the enthusiasm of the New York PHP community. If I ever get 
that private jet I'll be attending the monthly's again.

I'd ask to address the "all or nothing" question. Frameworks tend to 
require an religious adoption of the entire framework (overhead, 
environment, etc) and that can be a small problem ;-)  What about cake?

Maybe implement a navigation layout to show how to make use of reuseable 
'layouts'?  When I making a demo site in Cake, that was one of the first 
things I tried to do and I had a hard time figuring out how to highlight 
the current page if it was a static 'page' and not a controller that was 
getting called.  I'm not even sure now if the way that I did it was the 
'right' way to do it.

Religious? Cake is all about MVC, and it's not like MVC has its own hymns
or anything (http://mikezornek.com/archives/2003/07/17/wwdcs_mvc_song.php)

Cake is a framework I've had my eye on for a long time. One of the things
I'd like to see is what makes it better than all the other php mvc
frameworks out there? Also it would be nice to see some examples of how it
works with ajax. When is the September presentation? I don't see it on the
nyphp calendar anywhere.

YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! Bravo! I'll travel all the way from downtown for
this!

You know that folks who are totally new to this are gonna want a lightning
intro to MVC, likewise associations.

I would love to see you bake a little app before our very eyes with
bake.php (I can't wait to hear all the oooohs and aaaaaahs)

I'd like to find out how you handle advanced input validation and
filtering. (The jury seems to be out about the proper way to apply
multiple validation rules to one field.)

I'd like to see how you approach authentication.

I'd like to see an introducation (that was a typo, but I like it) to ACL.

I'd like to see how you write a model and controller that would support
"advanced" database searching (from the users point of view), meaning
building SELECTs on the fly from user input

I'd like to know how you approach integration with a popular CMS such as
Drupal.

I'd like to hear your recommendations regarding hosting Cake apps on a
shared server running PHP 5 in cgi mode.

I'd like to hear about what we might expect in future releases.

We have how long for this, just six hours? (-:

Following up on David's point, don't forget that there are likely to 
be people there who will need to hear from the beginning what is 
going on.  You can do this briefly so as not to bore those who know 
it already, but you also don't want to bore those others by 
discussing nothing but advanced details.

Man I miss the enthusiasm of the New York PHP community. If I ever get 
that private jet I'll be attending the monthly's again.

I'd ask to address the "all or nothing" question. Frameworks tend to 
require an religious adoption of the entire framework (overhead, 
environment, etc) and that can be a small problem ;-)  What about cake?

Maybe implement a navigation layout to show how to make use of reuseable 
'layouts'?  When I making a demo site in Cake, that was one of the first 
things I tried to do and I had a hard time figuring out how to highlight 
the current page if it was a static 'page' and not a controller that was 
getting called.  I'm not even sure now if the way that I did it was the 
'right' way to do it.

Yeah, it's always the 4th Tuesday, so it's 9/26/06 for the next meeting.
We'll get the calendar event online soon, but the RSVP link
http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php will still RSVP you for the 9/26/06 meeting.
