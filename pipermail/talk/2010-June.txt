Subject: [nycphp-talk] Chicago: Job search leads for a friend in Chicago?
Message-ID: <9F5D97AA-909A-4CF2-9A22-82F424F88669@gmail.com>

I know that NYPHP has a good jobs posting mailing list, so I would  
like to find something similar for the Chicago area for a friend of  
mine there who is a very experienced Linux Administrator. If there is  
a similar Linux oriented group in the Chicago area, please let me know  
to pass along to my friend. Also, if any of you have leads for a Linux  
Administrator in the Chicago area, send those along as well.

Thanks in advance!

Hi,

Is there a simple PHP web application for sharing files over the web?
I'm looking for something very simple and light weight but which has a
web based user administration control panel and group based access
control.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Mike

Dropbox just became the biggest hit in years.

Maybe you can tie in with that somehow?  It's almost a perfect piece
of software. Sure you could replicate it, but they just nailed it.

I've given homebrew a try after installing a php extension via macports upgraded php itself and started giving me segfaults in my application.

Homebrew is keen on not supplying formulas for stuff that comes with Snow Leopard (like php 5.3.1) which was fine until I realized this version of php was built without readline support and I needed it.

This post over here discusses building php 5.3 from source: http://seancoates.com/php-53-on-snow-leopard  But if you look at step 7, you'll see it requires patching php for an iconv fix.

I used to compile php from source before I drank the macports kool-aid.  But hitting compile errors and needing to find patches to build php is exactly the reason I wanted to use a package manager instead.  This is where homebrew is falling short for me.

Dropbox not ideal if you want to manage user and group access to a
shared file storage domain.

It rocks for individual and small-group sharing though.

Depending on whether you want to tinker a little, it's easy to hack
together an admin interface for .htaccess and .htdigest files and use
Apache WebDAV for this.

Then again, I'm sure that wheel has been reinvented often.

WebDAV is an excellent choice for this because Windows 7, OS X, and
Linux all support mounting WebDAV shares as network filesystems... or
in a pinch you can use it read-only with a browser.

Hmm... I downloaded the php source, went into the ext/readline, did 
phpize
./configure
make
make install

Added module=readline.so to php.ini and it seems to be working.

Alright, carry on.

Are you talking about https://www.dropbox.com/?

This looks like a closed source solution and it requires files go
through their servers. I don't know if the company privacy policy
would be compatible with that.

It sounds like what I want though. The WebDAV sync aspect is great.
What is the closest thing to a clone of dropbox?

All very well, but it would be nice if Homebrew had PHP 5.3.

Yikes, that's a deal breaker for me. Going to stay in my comfy

WebDAV is a completely different approach, and gives you a traditional
network filesystem: a single set of files, shared over the net by many
users.

Dropbox uses a proprietary protocol to keep a set of local files in
sync on different computers. An open source clone of it would be a
heavy lift, considering that you need developers who can write
equivalent file manager extensions for Windows, OSX, and Linux, along
with the server architecture to keep it all going.

Writing a sample php script right now that uses GridFS from MongoDB to
accomplish the same task, and all you need to do in order to scale is
fire up additional MongoDBs. Let me know if there's interest, at the
very least I can toss it up on GitHub somewhere.

Do a Google for "Nexus document sharing" - dont know if its still being 
developed.

Another options might be Joomla with the Docman extension.

you can try the innodb table type which uses row-level locking vs the
table-level locking of myisam.

Actually you HAVE to do this for the jos_sessions table, and if you
have a lot of users logging in you will need to do this for jos_users
as well.

Hi,

I want to introduce you a new PHP framework developed by me called PhpBURN
framework, it has as strongest point the ORM so you can build application
using multiple databases ( even virtual relationships between a MySQL <>
MSSQL is possible ) you can find it until 30 times faster than others
frameworks.

Well, i will not take so long explain it now, checkout at
www.phpburn.comand let me know your thoughts ( and better if community
can contribute too
;P )

Best Regards,

Klederson BUeno

That's interesting.

Nice site and the framework looks like a decent beginning.  I think most of us may roll our eyes at "yet another framework."  You might want to look more towards the future and code for PHP 5.3+.  Most new frameworks that I'm excited about are taking advantage of namespaces and closures to do things that weren't previously possible in PHP.

Another suggestion is to offer a "dev mode" for your ORM classes that automates the mappings by reading the database schema.  Maybe some way to output the mappings code.  It seems unnecessary to have to write this:

$this->getMap()->addField('id_user','id_user','int',10,array('autoincrement' => true, 'primary' => true));

Also, you're violating php's naming convention by having a public method that begins with an underscore (public function _mapping()).

Those are my quick two cents.  Congratulations on getting your project this far off the ground!

Hi,

Thanks for the nice feedback, well we are building a Open RoadMap so we can
include many features, one of them is Namespaces. About the dev-mode can be
a very nice ideia, we are ending now our reverse-engineer system to launch
in the 1.0 version in next months and we surely can implement this "dev
mode" too, but its a bit dangeours because if someone use this in production
can generate a non performatic application because realtime sync on demand
can be very painful for the server .

Anyway we have the reverse-engineer system that can connect at the database
and than generate all models automaticaly.

About _mapping() function was an ideia for future ( VERY future )
implementation of this orm as an extension.

Anyway everyone is invited to share, use, colaborate and ask, i`m very
avaliable to anwser questions or chat.

Best Regards,

Klederson Bueno
