Not to be contrary :-) but there is *always* a way.

In this case there are social engineering approaches to the application 
of technology which work, but they don't involve PHP any more than 
building an HTML form or writing a PDF file might involve PHP. No, I 
won't explain them, and anyway people who look for scripts and 
&quot;software&quot; to protect their eBook websites don't usually commit adequate 
resources to execute effectively.

People log into web pages they would never want to print or distribute 
every single day of the year. It's not about prevention, but persuasion. 
Think about that, and you'll see some possibilities.
