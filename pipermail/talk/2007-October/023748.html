Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] Some comments on the XML Talk


&gt;&gt;<i> Second, there were ideas that came out during Q &amp; A that might be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expanded on to good purpose.  Things that we might not know or take for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> granted, like the philosophy regarding types and structures. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> audience seemed to be focusing on the need for structure, while the tool
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did not seem to want to do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That made me wonder if most people completely missed the point. The
</I>&gt;<i> application of XML databases is, I think, in situations where
</I>&gt;<i> structure is either not applicable or not possible. Trying to stamp a
</I>&gt;<i> structure on an XML database (from what I can gather) destroys one of
</I>&gt;<i> the primary reasons for employing the technology. XML is flexible.
</I>&gt;<i> That's what makes it different. If you shoehorn an XML database into
</I>&gt;<i> what Rusty called a &quot;rectangular&quot; format, why not just continue using
</I>&gt;<i> relational databases?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as uses go, I was nodding the entire time that Rusty was
</I>&gt;<i> talking about the usefulness of structure-free systems in the medical
</I>&gt;<i> industry. I've worked in the medical industry almost exclusively for
</I>&gt;<i> seven years and there have been several times that I have had to force
</I>&gt;<i> data (documents, specifically) into relational formats that obviously
</I>&gt;<i> didn't work well. As Rusty pointed out, it makes a developer feel
</I>&gt;<i> dirty. I've seen &quot;documents&quot; tables with over two hundred columns, and
</I>&gt;<i> it took all sorts of work-arounds to fix the performance problems that
</I>&gt;<i> it caused. I've also seen the EAV format that Ali M. mentions in his
</I>&gt;<i> email. None of these solutions seem to fit the problem very well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rusty's presentation interested me because it seems to hold the best
</I>&gt;<i> answer I've seen yet to the free-flowing/constantly-changing data that
</I>&gt;<i> medical software has to deal with. I still don't feel that the (open
</I>&gt;<i> source, anyway) XML databases are a *mature* solution, but they
</I>&gt;<i> certainly hold a lot of promise for an industry afflicted with poor
</I>&gt;<i> containers to hold our data. The hybrid solutions hold the most
</I>&gt;<i> possibility, I think, because it meets the need for both structural
</I>&gt;<i> and non-structural data. I will be watching the maturation of the
</I>&gt;<i> available software with much more attention than I have before.
