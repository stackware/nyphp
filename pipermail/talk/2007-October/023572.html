<PRE>Hello,

Good points.

I've gotten ffmpeg to work on the .avi's, but I've yet to try it on .mpeg's.

I'll take a look into the credit based conversion.
I haven't noticed problems w/the sample video, but I've only done a few.
I won't start seeing problems until other people are using it. = ]

&gt;<i> Also, please note that FLVTOOL is very important in making flash videos. 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, without getting technical(cause I have no clue what it is),
</I>&gt;<i> the flv file you get from ffmpeg is gonna be one loooong file where you 
</I>&gt;<i> have to start at the beginning and go to the end to view a file.  No fast 
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding, no rewinding.
</I>
I don't seem to be having that problem w/the converted videos.
We have a flash player we've developed ourselves.


 They use similar programs and run into the same
&gt;<i> problems - so if you can demonstrate that Youtube can't convert the video, 
</I>&gt;<i> you will find people a lot more understanding of why their free/low cost 
</I>&gt;<i> app won't do it.
</I>
Great point.

&gt;<i> with ffmpeg when it becomes economically justifiable(ie you are willing to 
</I>&gt;<i> put the hours in to troubleshooting again and again when problems crop 
</I>&gt;<i> up).
</I>
Wish I knew what a problem it was before I fell into the trap of deliverying
a working application.

Thanks!

- Ben

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Super off topic, but since this list is one of my best resources for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I figured I'll try here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I've spent a lot of time on google and can't seem to figure out the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I have a PHP app that is converting .avi's to .flvs. I'm using ffmpeg 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and lame.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I've built ffmpeg w/libmp3lame support enabled, to encode to .mp3 for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the .flv
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  However, I don't know much about this stuff, and I can't seem to figure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out the correct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parameters. The online documentation for ffmpeg is lacking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not so much lacking, as there are so many different parameters that 
</I>&gt;<i> are format specific, and many that you would only use for a particular 
</I>&gt;<i> combination, that it is a waste of time to try to document it all when 
</I>&gt;<i> they can be working on making the next version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, I find it easiest when working with ffmpeg to find someone else 
</I>&gt;<i> that wants to do what I want and start with a known working formula.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, converting to flash is a web thing.
</I>&gt;<i> People running personal DVR's do a lot of Flash conversion.
</I>&gt;<i> So if you search for Mythweb and FLV you will get a lot of hits on people 
</I>&gt;<i> who want to convert their MythTV recorded videos to FLV.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a simple howto, give it a try:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Stream_mythtv_recordings_from_mythweb_using_flash_video">http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Stream_mythtv_recordings_from_mythweb_using_flash_video</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, please note that FLVTOOL is very important in making flash videos. 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, without getting technical(cause I have no clue what it is),
</I>&gt;<i> the flv file you get from ffmpeg is gonna be one loooong file where you 
</I>&gt;<i> have to start at the beginning and go to the end to view a file.  No fast 
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding, no rewinding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FLVTOOL adds some &quot;bookmarks&quot; to allow you to jump forward and back in the 
</I>&gt;<i> flash player.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FFMPEG is not always as forgiving of poorly packaged audio/video as a 
</I>&gt;<i> video player(VLC, Windows Media, Realplayer, etc).  Which leads to loads 
</I>&gt;<i> of headaches when someone has a file that plays fine, but after conversion 
</I>&gt;<i> is missing the last 5-15 seconds of audio or video or both! In such a 
</I>&gt;<i> situation, one thing to do is to upload the video to Google video or 
</I>&gt;<i> Youtube.  They use similar programs and run into the same problems - so if 
</I>&gt;<i> you can demonstrate that Youtube can't convert the video, you will find 
</I>&gt;<i> people a lot more understanding of why their free/low cost app won't do 
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a couple of services to convert videos to flash(or convert from 
</I>&gt;<i> any format to any format) where you submit your video and they email you a 
</I>&gt;<i> link or some such.  There was one I used that was credit based, so they 
</I>&gt;<i> had a relatively intelligent API for doing the conversion - this moves the 
</I>&gt;<i> conversion off of your responsibility and onto someone else, but it costs 
</I>&gt;<i> something like 10 cents per video.  For medium traffic sites or proof of 
</I>&gt;<i> concepts, I'd start with them and only deal with ffmpeg when it becomes 
</I>&gt;<i> economically justifiable(ie you are willing to put the hours in to 
</I>&gt;<i> troubleshooting again and again when problems crop up).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For extremely low volume, use Super to do the translation offline on a PC 
</I>&gt;<i> and just upload Flash videos.
