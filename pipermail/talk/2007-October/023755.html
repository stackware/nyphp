I've never run into this issue.  I've run into the &quot;if you don't specify 
the order, the database will use it's own default ordering&quot; - and a lot 
of depending on &quot;select *&quot; to give things in the &quot;correct&quot; order.

But one can hardly blame databases for having different defaults if you 
fail to specify one.

&gt;<i> Thus XML frees you from the confines of having to carefully

This statement prompted my reason for replying.  Is there a standalone 
set of tools for updating/editing an XML database?

I'm thinking of something along the lines of Microsoft Access, where you 
have 1 tool which has forms, program logic, and a database and all the 
data ends up &quot;together&quot; from a user standpoint.  So I can give someone a 
couple of access files and they have a complete application they can run 
locally?

(In case one is curious, my father was demonstrating a little MSAccess 
app he is putting together for tracking/monitoring environmental data. 
Something along the lines of the life cycle of animals in an 
environment, the number of particular animals seen, yadda yadda yadda.

I don't pretend to understand what it is he is doing, it's just his 
current crusade to organize his own data and give other people the 
ability to track the same data and share it with each other in an 
organized fashion.

He was motivated to do so after he discovered how useful having such 
data organized and handy is when disputing the environmental impact 
statements of company paid environmental surveyors doing a 1 day study)

Something non-Access based would be better, but since this basically is 
a tool for non-techies, it has to be simple and not dependent on a 
centralized server for the data to be housed.
