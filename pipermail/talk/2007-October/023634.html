well if apache is running as nobody, php is running as nobody (most  
likely) and that's a case where I'd say you might want to reconfigure  
things so that apache/php run as a different user. Most of the time  
when I've seen nobody, there are lots of daemons running as nobody  
and it might not be a good idea to have so much running as nobody (in  
case someone manages to hijack something else that's running as  
nobody). Creating a user like www might work, but as you know it all  
depends. Also, keep in mind that if you chown stuff to a user that is  
not a login user and you have shell users that need to edit those  
files you will run into a problem (but that's where group perms  
really do come in handy).

My shared host chowns files that they want me to be able to edit to  
my shell user, with the group being a special group they have created  
for process segregation. For files they don't want me to edit (some  
special log files mostly), they chown those files to the segregated  
&quot;apache user&quot;. On the servers at my office anyone who needs to edit  
files is also trusted with sudo rights (very few of us) so we can  
edit any file on the system regardless of who owns the file. If you  
are the only user you might not need to worry about that as much but  
(last time I promise...) it depends ;)

Again it's really only a problem if your PHP has to write to files on  
the system and not strictly to some mysql db, for example. As long as  
the php interpreter and apache (and of course, the world, that is -  
web browsers) can see the files you should be alright.

Hope it helps!
