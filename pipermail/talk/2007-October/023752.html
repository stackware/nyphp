Definitely some things to be worked out with the templates.  For  
example, the first thing I saw was the index.phtml view which has a  
line break before the doctype.  I'm pretty sure that immediately  
sends IE (at least IE6) into quirks mode.

&gt;<i> It looks like the index.php file is out of place
</I>Actually... I think it's in the right place... the docroot for the  
webserver would be set to the html directory which correctly  
separates the main application code from public access... but the  
include path is incorrect:

Change:
set_include_path('.' . PATH_SEPARATOR . './library' .  
PATH_SEPARATOR . './application/models/' . PATH_SEPARATOR .  
get_include_path());
To:
set_include_path('..' . PATH_SEPARATOR . '../library' .  
PATH_SEPARATOR . '../application/models/' . PATH_SEPARATOR .  
get_include_path());

Right?

&gt;<i> and creating new Zend controllers + Zend views dont seem to place  
</I>&gt;<i> them properly unless you explicitly specify the path (as oppose to  
</I>&gt;<i> the project folder itself).
</I>
Yeah... when I do new controller/view/etc... it places it in whatever  
folder I initiated it from -- or makes me enter a path if I do it  
from the main menu.

&gt;<i> All in all it's not bad but it seems some of the templates are  
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete(?), has anyone tried it out yet + have feedback and / or  
</I>&gt;<i> having same issues?
</I>
The Zend View and Zend Model don't seem to be any different than a  
new regular php file as far as I can tell.  I could be doing it  
wrong... but the files it created for me were empty.

I'm trying to figure out what you really get here that the (free) PDT  
doesn't do?  Obviously if you're using other Zend products -  
especially Zend Platform - this is well worth it.  But I kept  
encountering stuff that didn't fully work without Zend Platform (BIRT  
reports seem to need the Platform's java bridge and some of the  
debugging features need it too, for example).  PHPUnit and PHPDoc  
integration seems pretty cool... I wonder if those will make it into  
PDT at some point though.  Also, there seems to be extra refactoring  
tools and overall it seems more focused on PHP than PDT on its own.   
I see a server tunneling feature too which could be great for when a  
quick fix is needed but would be faster to do in a gui editor than in  
vim.

Hmm... I'm on the fence I guess... need to watch how this develops  
and figure out how much easier it will make my life than Eclipse with  
PDT/Web Tools/Subclipse before shelling out $254 (current 15% off  
price).
