<PRE>It sounds like you really just need to change the way in_court is used, 
having multiple options instead of just yes/no.

Then your javascript can key off that and your users can create any 
event types they require and specify where they take place.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's an entity called an &quot;event.&quot; Its attributes include: date, time,
</I>&gt;<i> language_id, event_type_id, location_id, and so forth. Naturally, there's a
</I>&gt;<i> related table called event_types for storing the kinds of things we do:
</I>&gt;<i> plea; sentencing; arraignment; attorney/client interview; etc. There's much
</I>&gt;<i> more to be said about the db design, but I'll skip it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> event_types have an attribute &quot;in_court&#168; which is boolean. Things are either
</I>&gt;<i> in-court, or they are ancillary events like attorney-client interviews.
</I>&gt;<i> (This is important; the suits in Washington require federal courts to report
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter usage based on such things).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fast forward to the user interface for creating/editing events. I want to
</I>&gt;<i> intelligently guess the default location based on the event type. (A judge
</I>&gt;<i> has a default courtroom usually, though in some cases not: some have only a
</I>&gt;<i> default courthouse. My locations model supports one level of nesting. A
</I>&gt;<i> courtroom is in a courthouse but both are locations.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now we come to some Javascript: an event handler that fires when the change
</I>&gt;<i> event on the &quot;judge&quot; select element happens. This handler looks at the
</I>&gt;<i> event_type to decide whether to set the location controls to that judge's
</I>&gt;<i> default courtroom, or not. I will have already loaded a JSON data structure
</I>&gt;<i> that tells me if an event_type is in_court or out. (There's much more: e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> I get the judge's default location info via xhr and cache it; so first I
</I>&gt;<i> look in the cache to see if it's already there. Yesterday I created a flow
</I>&gt;<i> chart on a large marker board to get a clearer picture in my mind, and
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed the obvious:  it seems complicated because it is complicated.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The plot thickens if the event_type is out of court. if it's out, it's
</I>&gt;<i> usually still in a courthouse, so I want to leave what a call the parent
</I>&gt;<i> location (the building, basically) consistent with the judge's default.
</I>&gt;<i> Unless the event_type is of type &quot;probation interview&quot; which is almost
</I>&gt;<i> invariably held outside any courthouse:  those happen in jails and US
</I>&gt;<i> probation offices. Therefore, if the user selects &quot;probation interview&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to default to any location, but make her choose (note my PC use
</I>&gt;<i> of what I call the counter-sexist &quot;she.&quot; Actually everyone is my office is
</I>&gt;<i> female except me, so the odds are that the user is indeed a she (-:).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, should my JS code examine the currently selected event_type option to
</I>&gt;<i> see if it matches the string &quot;probation interview?&quot; That would do fine,
</I>&gt;<i> unless a user with admin privileges decides to edit the name of that
</I>&gt;<i> particular event_type beyond recognition and breaks my javascript. Hence my
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion that this application needs to have certain event_types -- I
</I>&gt;<i> think of them as &quot;core&quot; event types -- that are loaded into the database at
</I>&gt;<i> setup time and are never messed with again. There's a logical business basis
</I>&gt;<i> for that:  there are certain kinds of courtroom events that you are
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely going to need, so why not get them in there up front. Thereafter,
</I>&gt;<i> users at a certain privilege level can add other event types as needed --
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally some new exotic thing may arise; edit them when they decide
</I>&gt;<i> they spelled it wrong; delete them (if the event_type has no related rows
</I>&gt;<i> and they change their mind).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it makes sense to have two different tables, as in &quot;basic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> event_types that ship with the app, and &quot;custom&quot; that the user creates. That
</I>&gt;<i> would make for torture when it comes time to figure out which table you need
</I>&gt;<i> events to JOIN with.  btw I have seen db designs in which you had a column
</I>&gt;<i> for a foreign key, and another column to tell you which damn table to FK
</I>&gt;<i> pointed to. Obviously this is for myisam or similar, not db-level FK
</I>&gt;<i> relationships. I think that's a bad idea and don't wanna do that (again (-:
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Better, it seems, is to somehow mark my sacred rows as such. At the UI level
</I>&gt;<i> I simply won't provide a way to edit them. At the model level I will throw
</I>&gt;<i> an exception if they try to update|delete them. So I'm planning to add a
</I>&gt;<i> boolean &quot;mutable&quot; to my event_types for that purpose. (Pseudo-boolean, if
</I>&gt;<i> you will, since this is MySQL).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS:  My weapons of choice are MySQL, Zend Framework, and JQuery. When it's
</I>&gt;<i> all done, this will be far and away the most ass-kicking federal court
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter management application known to humankind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comments?
