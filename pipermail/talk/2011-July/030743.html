<PRE>I hesitate to bore you with my details, but -- you can stop reading if it
gets too boring.

The application will manage judiciary interpreters (yeah, same project for
the past 8 years or so) in the office where i work ( as a court interpreter;
code monkey isn't in my formal job description at all (-: ).

There's an entity called an &quot;event.&quot; Its attributes include: date, time,
language_id, event_type_id, location_id, and so forth. Naturally, there's a
related table called event_types for storing the kinds of things we do:
plea; sentencing; arraignment; attorney/client interview; etc. There's much
more to be said about the db design, but I'll skip it.

event_types have an attribute &quot;in_court&#168; which is boolean. Things are either
in-court, or they are ancillary events like attorney-client interviews.
(This is important; the suits in Washington require federal courts to report
interpreter usage based on such things).

Fast forward to the user interface for creating/editing events. I want to
intelligently guess the default location based on the event type. (A judge
has a default courtroom usually, though in some cases not: some have only a
default courthouse. My locations model supports one level of nesting. A
courtroom is in a courthouse but both are locations.)

Now we come to some Javascript: an event handler that fires when the change
event on the &quot;judge&quot; select element happens. This handler looks at the
event_type to decide whether to set the location controls to that judge's
default courtroom, or not. I will have already loaded a JSON data structure
that tells me if an event_type is in_court or out. (There's much more: e.g.,
I get the judge's default location info via xhr and cache it; so first I
look in the cache to see if it's already there. Yesterday I created a flow
chart on a large marker board to get a clearer picture in my mind, and
confirmed the obvious:  it seems complicated because it is complicated.)

The plot thickens if the event_type is out of court. if it's out, it's
usually still in a courthouse, so I want to leave what a call the parent
location (the building, basically) consistent with the judge's default.
Unless the event_type is of type &quot;probation interview&quot; which is almost
invariably held outside any courthouse:  those happen in jails and US
probation offices. Therefore, if the user selects &quot;probation interview&quot; I
don't want to default to any location, but make her choose (note my PC use
of what I call the counter-sexist &quot;she.&quot; Actually everyone is my office is
female except me, so the odds are that the user is indeed a she (-:).

So, should my JS code examine the currently selected event_type option to
see if it matches the string &quot;probation interview?&quot; That would do fine,
unless a user with admin privileges decides to edit the name of that
particular event_type beyond recognition and breaks my javascript. Hence my
conclusion that this application needs to have certain event_types -- I
think of them as &quot;core&quot; event types -- that are loaded into the database at
setup time and are never messed with again. There's a logical business basis
for that:  there are certain kinds of courtroom events that you are
absolutely going to need, so why not get them in there up front. Thereafter,
users at a certain privilege level can add other event types as needed --
occasionally some new exotic thing may arise; edit them when they decide
they spelled it wrong; delete them (if the event_type has no related rows
and they change their mind).

I don't think it makes sense to have two different tables, as in &quot;basic&quot;
event_types that ship with the app, and &quot;custom&quot; that the user creates. That
would make for torture when it comes time to figure out which table you need
events to JOIN with.  btw I have seen db designs in which you had a column
for a foreign key, and another column to tell you which damn table to FK
pointed to. Obviously this is for myisam or similar, not db-level FK
relationships. I think that's a bad idea and don't wanna do that (again (-:
)

Better, it seems, is to somehow mark my sacred rows as such. At the UI level
I simply won't provide a way to edit them. At the model level I will throw
an exception if they try to update|delete them. So I'm planning to add a
boolean &quot;mutable&quot; to my event_types for that purpose. (Pseudo-boolean, if
you will, since this is MySQL).

PS:  My weapons of choice are MySQL, Zend Framework, and JQuery. When it's
all done, this will be far and away the most ass-kicking federal court
interpreter management application known to humankind.
