<PRE>Hi Anthony,

In theory, no hashing function will ever be free from brute force attacks,
but this is a matter of how long one is willing to perform a brute force
attack to find the variable (a password) in a one-way hashing function. In
practice, some hashing functions have clear security flaws while others are
not yet known to have any.

In your example it is best to stay away from MD5 as there are serious
security issues with it.

SHA-1 is still a safe hashing function to use. You may find papers on the
internet that state that there was progress in finding collisions or
algorithmic strategies in significantly reducing the security of SHA-1, but
I am yet to see a solution that does not require astronomical computation to
render SHA-1 insecure.

However, appending any plaintext to your password and hashing that, such as
SHA(username+password+username) is useless from a mathematical standpoint as
the username is actually known to a potential hacker. The way that hash
functions work would mean that adding any additional bits which are known
will not increase the security of your resulting hash.

When you mention that &quot;all are comprimisable by that simple manner&quot; I have
to disagree. Although you are correct in saying that a brute force attack is
possible, a good encryption/hashing function will require so many
computations that even super computers would need to run for years to
actually break your encryption.

Here are some recommendations that will increase the security of your
passwords:

1. Use a password strength checker which would not allow dictionary words to
be used for passwords. This eliminates a dictionary attack and requires
brute force.
2. Require long passwords, such as over 10 characters. Each character is 8
bits of information which can significantly reduce the chance of a collision
with a brute force attack.
3. Prevent automated attacks by locking down the account after 3 attempts or
so. Computation is on orders faster than a lockout time of 10 minutes which
will render any brute force attack completely useless in this case.
4. Never allow an open connection on your DB server to the world, even if
you have 30 character passwords to access your SQL server. You should
tightly lockdown any and all access to your SQL server so that there is very
minimal access (such as from a web server).

Hope this helps,

Nick
