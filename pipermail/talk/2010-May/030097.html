</I>    In fact,  this is a dirty secret about PHP and the &quot;Unix Way&quot;;  to a 
large extent,  systems that are 8-bit clean will process UTF-8 data 
correctly without modifications...  Except when they don't.

    Unfortunately,  that's also the case with Perl,  Java,  .NET and 
other systems that have complex &quot;Unicode Support&quot;;  Unicode support is 
such a complicated thing that it's inevitably implemented with errors in 
those systems,  and often,  you're really screwed in those systems 
because you're not seeing the raw bytestream.

    I remember a system where a choice of language and database were 
made because the systems &quot;supported unicode&quot; according to the 
documentation,  but practically all kinds of strange transformations 
were going on behind our backs...  One day I actually looked at the 
database in the SQL monitor and found the whole thing was double-encoded.

    There's also the issue that there really is no &quot;Unicode Sort Order&quot; 
that entirely makes sense.  For instance,  languages such as German and 
Swedish sort the same characters in a different order.  I'm currently 
working on a system that is predominantly English but contains many 
named entity names with latinoid characters:  the sort order for 
&quot;English&quot; might well sort the Polish &quot;Dark L&quot; (the l with a line through 
it) after Z,  but poles sort &quot;Dark L&quot; after &quot;Clear L&quot; and most 
en-speakers will expect that too,  since we commonly squash Dark L -&gt; 
Clear L in words like &quot;Stanislaw.&quot;  Japanese people sort named entities 
phonetically,  which means you need to keep a furigana (phonetic) 
representation side by side with the conventional kanji 
representation...  In this age of statistical language translation,  I 
think kanji -&gt; furigana translation could be largely automated,  but 
there are always 'words' that can't be read phonetically out of 
context,  like

&quot;read&quot;

    The &quot;real&quot; character encoding that you find web documents in is most 
closely described as a random mix of ISO-latin-1 and UTF-8 characters 
interspersed at random,  no matter what the charset of a document 
officially is.  There are just too many cases where characters come in 
through form fields and other sources that aren't well controlled.  
Yes,  ~you~ should publish good clean UTF-8,  but if you're scraping on 
a large scale you'll find lots of crazy stuff that doesn't quite match 
what's in the books...  And it's helpful to look at the byte stream in 
those cases.
