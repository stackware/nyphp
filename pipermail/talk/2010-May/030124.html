I would suggest mirroring the infrastructure of spam DNS Real-time 
Blackhole lists. The technology has already been proven and you would 
just be re purposing it for your own application. Rather than have the 
relay servers download an entire list, have them query a pool of private 
DNS Blacklist servers on demand and maybe even cache the data for a 
period of time.
