Standard practice is to use add a salt before hashing the password so
that dictionary attacks don't work. The salt could be the userid, the
creation time of the record, or some other variable piece of
information that the system will always be able to find when
authenticating the user. The salt should ideally be unique to your
system.

So your sha( $username . $password ) approach is fine, though sha(
$createdtime . $password ) would be even better -- the user might use
the same username and password in other systems, which would make the
hash identical, and could make the password easier to guess.

If you're designing the system now, sha-256 is probably a good idea.
md5 and sha-1 are considered broken in some circles, though not so
much that you would force an upgrade to an existing system.

Always use a one-way hash. Always use a variable salt that is unique
to your system. You are not being overly paranoid. ;-)
