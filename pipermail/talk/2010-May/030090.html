<PRE>Hey Anthony,

Not sure if I'm missing something but if attackers can get their hands on a
.txt, they can get their hands on a .php and extracting the hard coded list
would be a trivial issue.

If you're shifting load to the relay level perhaps you could try two-way
encryption, since the extra overhead may not make much of a difference.

&gt;<i> Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As some of you may know, during last years Presidential protests in Iran, I
</I>&gt;<i> developed a distributed, multi-level, Twitter proxy service called
</I>&gt;<i> TweetFree. For the first time in almost a year, I'm revisiting the code in
</I>&gt;<i> an effort to update it and make it more useful for people outside of Iran
</I>&gt;<i> but still in oppressive cultures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The system has several components: a Windows Mobile, iPhone, Android, and
</I>&gt;<i> Blackberry application that connects to a TweetFree Relay server, the
</I>&gt;<i> TweetFree Relay Server itself, and the main TweetFree Network Servers.  How
</I>&gt;<i> this all works together is unimportant so I won't bore you with the details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, the TweetFree Network Servers maintain a network block list. So every
</I>&gt;<i> time the Relay Servers send a post, the Network Server checks to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> the client that the relay is posting for isn't blocked from the network. If
</I>&gt;<i> it is, it says no and the relay tells the client that it couldn't post its
</I>&gt;<i> message.  The problem with this, of course, is that you might have thousands
</I>&gt;<i> of Relay Servers hitting the Network Servers (as happened during the Iranian
</I>&gt;<i> election) and each of those requests have to be processed. That puts a bit
</I>&gt;<i> of a load on the server that I'd like to alleviate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my thought is to maintain a blacklist of client keys on the Network
</I>&gt;<i> Servers and have the Relay Servers download this list every few minutes.
</I>&gt;<i> Then, clients could be blocked at the RELAY level instead of at the Network
</I>&gt;<i> level and less load would be put on the Network Servers (of which there are
</I>&gt;<i> only about 10).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My problem is that I'm not sure how to protect this list. The list is a
</I>&gt;<i> simple text file that contains client keys. No identifying information, but
</I>&gt;<i> client keys nonetheless. If it's a .txt file then the contents are viewable
</I>&gt;<i> publicly which *could* pose a security risk in highly volatile environments.
</I>&gt;<i> If I name it with the .php extension, it's handled like a PHP file and,
</I>&gt;<i> thus, the text in it can't be read.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the best way to handle this? I need to protect the users privacy
</I>&gt;<i> while still reducing network load.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
