Subject: [nycphp-talk] server configuration/synchronization tool
Message-ID: <20111105205431.GA21777@panix.com>

Hi Folks:

I saw a presentation a year or two ago about an open source tool where
one could compose a file describing a server configuration and then have
that configuration distributed to your various servers and they'd do
what needs to be done to be at that configuration.  Pretty cool stuff.
Now if I could only remember the name of that software!  Help, please!

Thanks,

Sounds like puppet, which I use and like.  But there are several tools
that do this, and thereby many associated religious wars.

Thanks,

This is actually incorrect.  The value needs to go in the the value attribute of the input element.  Try this:

echo '<input value="' . htmlspecialchars($variable1, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') . '" />";
> echo "<textarea><?=$variable2?></textarea>";

Try this:

echo '<textarea>' . htmlspecialchars($variable2, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') . '</textarea>';

Hi, Guys!I just realized that after sent my post, I made a mistake in my code. I just woke up and rushed to the computer and start typing half-asleep and ran off to work in a matter of 3 minutes. So the code to populate in the boxes should have been: <?php$variable1 = 'John Doe';$variable2 = 'The sun is shining ..................blah blah blah';
echo "<input size=25 name=example1 value=<?=$variable1?></input>";
echo "<textarea name=example2 value=<?=$variable2?>  rows=10 cols=50></textarea>";?> Some reason only example1 input box gets populated and exampl2 showed nothing.Any idea?ThanksPaul Tuon >Hi, Guys!  >This maybe a simple solution that I overlooked.

Content goes inside the textarea block element:
echo "<textarea name=example2 rows=10 cols=50><?=$variable2?></textarea>";

And you'll want to escape the value of $variable2 ... It gets really
awkward if $variable2 includes </textarea> :)

echo "<textarea name=example2 rows=10
cols=50><?=htmlentities($variable2)?></textarea>";

The textarea tag does not have a value argument. You just include the default 
text within the tags.

Your missing quotes around your values and what are you using a closing
input tag?

Not just awkward: dangerous. This is the prime vector for cross-site scripting.

Please always run any values you are including in an HTML page through
htmlentities() or htmlspecialchars().

Paul:

First, use of "<?=" is  'no no' -- it's not good practice. Keep in mind that if the "short tag" option was not set your code would fail. Considering that you have no control over where your code might be run in the future, save everyone time/effort and use "<?php echo(); ?>" and not '<=' . In addition, your code may be used in an XML environment where '<=' is not recognized as being a PHP identifier.

In any event, the way to do it is:

<?php echo($variable1); ?>  // I prefer

OR

<?php echo $variable1; ?>

Second, let's look at what you told the interpreter to do -- namely echo "<input><?=$variable2?></input>"

a. You don't need an ending tag for an input statement, thus no </input> is required.

b. Your use of an echo (i.e., '<?=') inside of an echo is problematic at best -- it's sloppy coding.

So, to fix this, I would suggest:

echo("<input type='text' value=/"$variable1/">");

or

echo '<input type="text" value="' . $variable1 .'">';

There are other ways of doing this (note the mix of different quotes).

For the second part, namely the <textarea>, it does need a closing tag and thus </textarea> is required. To do that I would suggest:

echo("<textarea rows=/"4" cols="/40/">$variable2</textarea>");

or

echo '<textarea rows="4" cols="40">' . $variable2 . '</textarea>';

Please note the above is typed from memory and may have typos in it -- but it should be generally correct.

Cheers,

tedd

Hi, Guys!I just realized that after sent my post, I made a mistake in my code. I just woke up and rushed to the computer and start typing half-asleep and ran off to work in a matter of 3 minutes. So the code to populate in the boxes should have been: <?php$variable1 = 'John Doe';$variable2 = 'The sun is shining ..................blah blah blah';
echo "<input size=25 name=example1 value=<?=$variable1?></input>";
echo "<textarea name=example2 value=<?=$variable2?>  rows=10 cols=50></textarea>";?> Some reason only example1 input box gets populated and exampl2 showed nothing.Any idea?ThanksPaul Tuon >Hi, Guys!  >This maybe a simple solution that I overlooked.

Content goes inside the textarea block element:
echo "<textarea name=example2 rows=10 cols=50><?=$variable2?></textarea>";

And you'll want to escape the value of $variable2 ... It gets really
awkward if $variable2 includes </textarea> :)

echo "<textarea name=example2 rows=10
cols=50><?=htmlentities($variable2)?></textarea>";

The textarea tag does not have a value argument. You just include the default 
text within the tags.

Your missing quotes around your values and what are you using a closing
input tag?

I found that using Cache Router, http://drupal.org/project/cacherouter 
actually worked quite well at caching for logged in users as well as 
anonymous users.

Sadly,  there won't be a version 7 of this module as someone else 
managed to get their own Caching scheme inserted into the core, and then 
proceeded to belittle and badmouth proposals to release a version 7 of 
Cache Router.    While the version 7 Drupal Cache functions are a step 
up and I would even say the concept seems 'cleaner', it doesn't approach 
Cache Router in practical functionality - instead depending solely on 
module writers to cache when needed.

I find there are 3 classifications of attacks to be concerned about, and 
each is problematic to address.

One is known PHP exploits.  The problem with known PHP exploits is that 
there are a number of ways to secure a system against them, but quite 
often PHP programmers have this idealized view that basically shifts the 
responsibility for security to the underlying operating system.  There 
are quite a number of exploits based on writing or appending to an 
existing file where if the file was read only, even if still owned by 
the web server process and able to chmod it at will from within PHP, 
those exploits would be stopped cold.  Coders are lazy though and they 
claim "well, if you can WRITE to the file, then you can change the file 
permissions, so why should I do extra work whenever I want to write a file".

The next is based on shared hosts and leaving files writable to other 
virtual hosts running on the system, so one compromise allows all to be 
compromised.  Instead of taking steps to minimize that, the solution 
proposed seems to be run your own VPS.

Yet the VPS has it's own problem in that most of them don't bother to 
lock out users who repeatedly try to ftp/sftp to the system - thereby 
being open to dictionary attacks.

The solution is to take security seriously and actually attempt to plug 
as many holes as possible, never just declare it as someone else's 
problem and that "all will be better if only you do..."

Just MHO

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Embedded PHP
Message-ID: <4EBA9757.5030304@gmail.com>

Got a fun little gizmo from Texas Instruments, a Chronos Watch[thanks to 
http://tideals.com/]...  and that has gotten me thinking about playing 
with circuits again.

The problem is, I HATE the idea of learning a bunch of new coding for 
what in the end is a hobby for fun.

Add to that the upcoming release of the Raspberry 
Pi[http://www.raspberrypi.org/] and the 
BeagleBone[http://beagleboard.org/bone] and it's possible to work at a 
relatively high level[both will run linux] on a small system 
board[around the size of a business card] with between 128MB and 512MB 
of memory.

So, for hacking around, it would be nice to have a low impact PHP 
environment with just the basics.  IE strip out most of the functions 
and extensions to PHP, strip out the easter eggs, etc and get it as 
small as possible.

Looking around, I find a few stabs at this, generally from the angle of 
being subtractive - ie patch the code to remove the logo's, run 
configure with disable-* for everything, etc.

Instead, I'm thinking of trying to do it from the other end - ie clone 
the source and then remove every directory and file not needed to 
compile, as well as removing more from the configuration script and 
makefile - with the first goal of being to have a CLI PHP compiled which 
just has a few functions[ideally, break it down to just some basic 
variable manipulation and the echo function], then add functions back in 
on a case by case basis as they are needed.

Just curious if anyone here knows of an approach that starts at the 
minimal end and builds up, or even a subtractive approach that has 
resulted in a very small, limited functionality PHP interpreter?

Erg, as a followup, in case someone doesn't want to take the time to 
work through those links:

Raspberry Pi: proposed pricing will be 25/35
25$ model: 128MiB memory, 1x USB 2.0, 1xHDMI
35$ model: 256MiB, 2x USB 2.0, Ethernet, 1xHDMI
Processor will be the same ARM SoC used in the Roku 2

Beaglebone: proposed pricing is $90
MicroSD, 1xEthernet, 2xUSB, 512MB, Arm SoC from Texas Instruments

Note: neither will have wifi or bluetooth onboard...sadly while it is 
extremely cheap to include it parts wise[under 5$ to stick either on 
board] - anything which transmits signals over the air needs to go 
through extra expensive FCC hurdles.

The TI Chronos Watch runs on an MSP430 chip and there isn't any way I 
can see to shoehorn in a PHP stack.. however the Metawatch 
http://www.metawatch.org/ may be able to...at 200$ I'm not planning on 
playing with it for a while.

Given that you're not talking about microscopic amounts of memory (pretty
sure my first PHP production server was 256MB) I'm not sure how hard you
should work on this.

Simply compiling PHP with most of the --without-xxx flags should get you a
relatively small binary, no? And very few shared library dependencies.

I'm only guessing, but that seems like an easy place to start.

I always hated answers to questions like this that proposed a totally
different solution, BUT :)
Since you would be ok with a very basic/crippled version of php then why
stick with it? I'm sure you can handle what you mentioned (basic variable
manipulation and echo) in any similar scripting language (perl, python,
ruby etc) that could already be embedded on the platform you end up on? The
beagleboard guys mentioned nodejs for example. I admit i don't know
anything about the one from TI you mentioned.

$50 is my upper limit on cost, as my eventual goal is to create an open 
source hardware/software platform for a toy for my 3 year old.

I'm considering making an exception on the BeagleBone purely to get a 
dev platform NOW, then port later to increasingly smaller platforms[ie 
BeagleBone to RaspberryPi, and then if possible even smaller.

After the toy project, my next goal is  pushing down to the "web server 
on a business card" space. 
http://hackaday.com/2008/09/25/web-server-on-a-business-card-part-2/ 
<http://hackaday.com/2008/09/25/web-server-on-a-business-card-part-2/>With 
TI's new ARM System on a Chip running under 10$, it SHOULD be possible 
to get it down to under 20$ for a business card running a web server and 
PHP...  To go below the $10 mark will probably require pushing into an 
even smaller chip.

I don't actually think it will be possible to "run php" at that level, 
but it may be possible to use a tool like HipHop to convert PHP code to 
C code that can compile and run on the business card.

And if not, well, this is all just for fun anyway. :-)

Because I love PHP and want to learn to play with circuits, not yet 
another scripting language. :-)

However, if I do go that route Python actually has a good head start 
there with PyMite/Python-on-a-chip: 
http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/

I'm not sure at this point if the Bone actually runs Node.js, or if it 
just has some weird interface to it[basically, you can write your app 
over the web using Cloud 9, and then download it to the board...but does 
it download node.js or does it compile it to something else?]

FYI, almost all the *Board platforms are Texas Instruments[BeagleBoard, 
PandaBoard, LeopardBoard, HawkBoard] - they all utilize a different 
"System on a Chip" ARM processor and are put together as reference 
platforms for hobbyists/engineers.  The theory being you develop your 
prototype on the board - which has all it's pinouts and extra 
interfaces.  Then you figure out just what you need and design your 
circuit to get rid of all the extraneous crud for mass production[and 
since your using a TI chip as your processor, TI gets all the big ticket 
component sales to produce the board...whether or not your product is 
actually successful. :-)]

Nice topic!

A cool exploit I used for some security test was an hidden upload form used
as backdoor to upload PHP files, in combination with this
phpinstaller<https://github.com/rainphp/phpinstaller>,
I was able to compress all files in a single auto-deflating PHP and upload
on the website.

If you want to check the security of an application you may want to keep an
eye also on file_get_contents, curl and "simple" input form.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP UTF8 Conversion to ASCII
Message-ID: <005e01cc9fed$4d324f30$e796ed90$@com>

Recently came across the issue where utf8 characters were getting outputted into links like so:

http://example.com/?cenar [<< where the "a" is a special character], which a browser can turn to links like so: 

http://example.com/??cenar 

 

In researching, I have found that browsers do not handle special utf8 characters in urls very well.

 

So I looked into PHP conversions of utf8 to ascii and found that even this seems an imperfect art.

 

Has anyone found a near perfect utf8 to ascii conversion technique for PHP.

 

I found this reference here: http://www.unexpectedit.com/php/php-clean-string-of-utf8-chars-convert-to-similar-ascii-char

 

Is this the best at this time? Any thoughts? 

 

(Also see this nice character encoding overview if needed: http://htmlpurifier.org/docs/enduser-utf8.html)

 

Warmest regards,

My impression was that urlencode translated chars that cannot pass in an URL into entities that can. But those new entities are now  gibberish to the human eye. 

My end reuslt needed is creating user-friendly, clean, attractive urls from utf8 that will render as human-readable characteres in the browser address bar.

And that browsers will not choke on the link when a user clicks it in  web page. 

Are you saying that an urlencoded link will be clickable in a web page and render human-readable in the browser address bar too?

URLs are made up of ASCII characters. You can fake it and hope that the
browser converts non-ascii to %-encoded entities correctly, or you can do
it explicitly using urlencode() in href attributes. I think actually most
browsers will do the encoding on the fly but you never know, especially
with mobile.

If you're also asking about display of unicode in an HTML page (seeing
the ? character) it could be you are trying to display UTF-8 characters in
a page whose content type encoding is set to ISO-8859-1 or vice-versa. You
can manually change the page encoding using the View menu in Firefox to see
if that fixes the issue.

Modern browsers shouldn't really have trouble unicode characters in URL's.
I recall seeing a few single-character domain names a while back after
unicode became available for registration.
Punycode<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode>is typically employed
when displaying hostnames - I believe this is most
practically a security measure for avoiding fishing scams with domain names
that may look similar.

But to your point, it sounds like you need transliteration. The PHP iconv
extension supports this natively:

As it turns out we have iconv in our php build and we can use it. 

So I will try that, thank you all.

If these links are being auto-generated from your content titles, it is sometimes referred to as a "slug" - http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(web_publishing)

You'll find code in wordpress and other open source apps for handling the transliteration of slugs that can do it without iconv, but that is a pretty good route if you have it available.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] How does one suggest improved variable scoping for PHP?
Message-ID: <4EC3E10A.9030905@pagenotes.com>

I just ran across a simple problem I couldn't solve, namely to create a 
function that does the opposite of array_filter, call it 
array_sanitize.  The closest I could come doesn't work for anonymous 
functions:

<?php
   function array_sanitize($array, $filterName) {
     $negFilter = create_function('$arg', 'return !'.$filterName.'($arg);');
     return array_filter($array, $negFilter);
   }
   //Example:
   $a = array('a'=>6,'b'=>1,'c'=>4,'d'=>9);
   function isOdd($arg) { return $arg % 2 == 1; }
   print_r (array_sanitize($a, 'isOdd')); // outputs 'Array ( [a] => 6 
[c] => 4 )'
?>

If we had variables of intermediate scope, call them "regional" 
variables, we could do this:
/*
   function array_sanitize($array, $filter) {
     $negFilter = function($arg) {
       regional $filter;
       return !$filter($arg)
     };
   return array_filter($array, $negFilter)
   }
*/

So, my question is how and whether to advocate the need for variables of 
intermediate scope.
Specifically, is there a public forum for suggesting improvements to PHP?

Would this do the job?

function array_sanitize($array,$filterName)
{
   return array_diff($array,array_filter($array,$filterName));
}

Seems to work in my testing:

$a = array('a'=>6,'b'=>1,'c'=>4,'d'=>9);
$isOdd = create_function('$arg','return $arg % 2 == 1;');
print_r(array_sanitize($a, $isOdd));

The concept of "regional" variables you're describing already exists via
use statements for anonymous functions. The following should be possible:

function array_sanitize($array, $filter) {
   $negFilter = function($arg) use ($filter) {
       return !$filter($arg);
   };
   return array_filter($array, $negFilter)
}

See example #3 here: http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php

I just ran across a simple problem I couldn't solve, namely to create a 
function that does the opposite of array_filter, call it 
array_sanitize.  The closest I could come doesn't work for anonymous 
functions:

<?php
   function array_sanitize($array, $filterName) {
     $negFilter = create_function('$arg', 'return !'.$filterName.'($arg);');
     return array_filter($array, $negFilter);
   }
   //Example:
   $a = array('a'=>6,'b'=>1,'c'=>4,'d'=>9);
   function isOdd($arg) { return $arg % 2 == 1; }
   print_r (array_sanitize($a, 'isOdd')); // outputs 'Array ( [a] => 6

Hi All,

Could people give me a sense of the per hour rate for an experienced
developer these days in New York.

Thanks

About $80/hr is the rate I've seen (and paid) to well experienced developers.  We had a pretty lengthy conversation here about it a few months ago which made it seem like you might be able to find experienced developers charging as low as $40-50/hr.

However, I usually like to work with flat rates -- given the project spec and scope, come up with a rate for the whole project.  Because really? the amount of work that can be done in an hour depends on who's doing it.  I.e. I could charge $40/hr but take 3 times as long as the person charging $80/hr.

And more importantly, you'd have an incentive to do so.

A flat rate is a win for both sides. The programmer can do what needs to be
done without obsessively tracking time, and the employer has a known cost
that can be submitted to management and accounting.

A talented programmer might be able to do a $10,000 job in a few hours. So
be it. You'd actually rather pay that person $2,000 per hour and have it
done tomorrow than hire some hack at $40/hr and have it take six weeks.

And I've seen this often.  It's very true.

I don't live in New York, but I have clients there. 

I charge $100 per hour, but I usually do more work than I bill. Besides, I usually work on a pre-project basis.

A decade ago, I was approached by a potential client who asked me for my rate and I replied $50 per hour. To which he said "I never paid more than $25 per hour -- would you consider working for that?" I answered "Sure, but it's going to take me twice as long to get anything done."

He moved on and a year later; we repeated the conversation; and the outcome. He's probably still looking for someone willing to work for half-wages, but isn't smart enough to realize that you usually get what you pay for, but never more.

Your rate is relative -- charge as you feel you are worth. 

Cheers,

tedd

Let's put this into perspective.  I have 13 years experience working with PHP and MySQL and currently
I am contracting at a rate of $60 per hour in the Boston area.

I have only charged $80/hr once and that was for a project I really didn't have the time or want to do it.  However
it was done as they were willing to pay that rate :)

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

I'm going to say anywhere between $45 - $75/hr ... it depends on the 
length of the job, what's involved, how much money they have...

I think between $50-65 an hour is the most common range.

Why does how much money the client has determine what you are going to charge.  Sounds to me
like you don't have a solid figure on what you feel you are worth and just try to get as much $$ as you can.

I agree with the statement, except it's more "how much money they have *to
invest*" as any project can be done completely differently depending on the
budget.
Quality usually as a cost!

In Kristina's defense, I have hired her to work on many projects, and I know for a fact she means she would provide a *discount* on her rate (not an increase) if the company she is working for is tight on funds or is a start-up.

Consider the type of contract and the benefits as well.

In a full time contract you have vacation and day off if you're sick, also
you have a stable income.
At the end of 3 month contract you will have to search for new position.

But more important, get the job you like the most!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Strange ! and line break coming through via
	msyql/php/mail()
Message-ID: <4EC55482020000A400017059@gwsmtp1.smith.edu>

Greetings,
 
I have a script that gets some text out of a MySQL table and sends it in the message body via the mail function.  Some of the emails are coming through with an exclamation point followed by the text being moved to a new line.
 
I'm not sure where this ! and \n are coming from.  When I view the text in mysql, it's clean, there is no ! or \n.  If I output to the browser with nl2br(), there is no ! or <br>.
 
I've done some searching and haven't found any helpful info so I'm appealing to you all.  Has anyone seen behavior like this, or have a recommendation for what I can do to diagnose or fix the problem?
 
I have a number of rows in the table.  Some of the them come through clean on the email, and two come through with this mystery ! and line break.  I've had the emails go to different accounts and viewed via client or browser, and that doesn't make a difference. 
 
Thoughts?  Suggestions?
 
Thanks,
 
-Aaron

A really good programmer never has to search for a new position.  There 
are folks lined up around the proverbial block begging.  What we need to 
search for is a place to hide to get a week or two off here and there.

Dear Aaron,

When form get submitted I am using in html email:

            <tr>

              <td>

                <strong>Questions comments</strong>

                <hr />

                <?php

                  $value = $item->getValue("questions_comments");

                  echo str_replace("\n","<br />",wordwrap($value));

                ?>

                <p></p>

              </td>

            </tr>   

Also you should be aware of ' sign, for example:

                             if (get_magic_quotes_gpc())

                             {

                                             $value  = stripslashes($value);

                             }

Best regards,

Sasa

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Strange ! and line break coming through via
msyql/php/mail()

 

Greetings,

 

I have a script that gets some text out of a MySQL table and sends it in the
message body via the mail function.  Some of the emails are coming through
with an exclamation point followed by the text being moved to a new line.

 

I'm not sure where this ! and \n are coming from.  When I view the text in
mysql, it's clean, there is no ! or \n.  If I output to the browser with
nl2br(), there is no ! or <br>.

 

I've done some searching and haven't found any helpful info so I'm appealing
to you all.  Has anyone seen behavior like this, or have a recommendation
for what I can do to diagnose or fix the problem?

 

I have a number of rows in the table.  Some of the them come through clean
on the email, and two come through with this mystery ! and line break.  I've
had the emails go to different accounts and viewed via client or browser,
and that doesn't make a difference. 

 

Thoughts?  Suggestions?

 

Thanks,

 

-Aaron

Actually, it is not uncommon to charge different *industries* different 
rates; nonprofits typically get lower per-hour rates. There is a 
perception about cost and value going on.

And...what precisely is wrong with trying to get as much $$ as you can? 
I like hacking, but I also like paying the mortgage on time, funding my 
other hobbies, paying for the kids' schools...

Are you using a debugger (you should be).  Echo the email body into your 
debugger (not with echo statements, with whatever your debugger uses).  
If that doesn't give you a clue, write a little character_to_hex 
function and use that to sent the text to the debugger.  It's getting 
into the email somewhere (I assume you've tried different email clients 
to eliminate a buggy client as the problem), so debugging the body text 
should show you the bad text.  Then debug further back, one step at a 
time, and you should be able to find the line before the text gets 
corrupted and the line after.  That's where the corruption is occurring.

(If you've already done all that and still haven't found it, ignore me.)

You "set up" a URL by buying a domain name and buying hosting from a 
hosting company.

Then you write PHP (and Actionscript) code and upload it to the hosting 
site you bought.

If you're a designer, I suggest that you find a developer to do your 
development work for you.  Developing a site isn't as simple as 
designing something that looks nice - you have to be able to write software.

I have downloaded php5 and in my programs I have a folder named php5 and in it is a php.ini.  Should there be a executable program.  If this is not typical, where may I download the software and what file should I expect?

Developing the skills and knowledge to perform server-side development 
on any competent level takes a minimum of a couple of years in most 
cases.   Therefore unless you have serious goals of becoming a 
server-side developer and are willing to put in the enormous time & 
energy commitment that sort of thing requires, I would second the 
recommendation to hire someone experienced to build this for you.

It's easy, download MAMP <http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html> for Macintosh
or WAMP <http://www.wampserver.com/en/> for Windows, they will install all
you need, Apache, MySql, PHP. After that you can start create an index.php
file in your web folder and test it on your http://localhost/ with your
browser.

Enjoy

And after you download and install Mamp/Wamp/or Xampp you can go to
w3schools for some pretty easy to follow tutorials and examples:

There is also the XAMPP/WAMPP from apachefriends.org. There you really only 
need to click buttons....and then at least delete the incredibly buggy 
phpMyAdmin. Other than that, using apachefriends fine package for almost ten 
years now and never had a problem.

Telling her that it's as simple as setting up a WAMP stack is like 
telling a good programmer that design is as simple as downloading 
Paint.net.  A really good designer is right-brained.  A really good 
developer is left-brained.  The last person of whom I'm aware who was 
both left- and right-brained was Leonardo da Vinci - it's that rare.  
People should stick to what they're good at, and get others to do what 
they really aren't physically equipped to do.   It's no shame if an 
artist can't figure out how to write code, or if a short person can't 
play pro basketball.

(BTW, some people who have CS degrees would have been better off going 
for a BFA.)

Actually people would probably say that I'm both left & right brained in 
some ways...although for sure I'm no DaVinci, LOL.
And, I think the guys were joking around a bit with their suggestions.  
It's certainly not a trivial thing for any non-engineer to set up a web 
server!

Speaking as someone who, with a B.A. degree in English and basically NO 
knowledge of computers, somehow taught  myself to be a pretty darn good 
server-side programmer in my 30s (this was back around 1996/1997 that I 
started), I can attest that it IS possible but only if you have both a 
LOT of time & patience, AND a tolerance for huge amounts of mental 
agony....and plan on not having much of a social life for a decade or 
two.  I certainly do not want to dissuade anyone from trying.

I'm assuming you simply want a way to handle a form, and you're not
trying to become a web developer today. If this assumption is wrong,
feel free to disregard the following links :)

Yes I believe you are right.  My background is architecture as well as engineering, but I have a project to complete and appreciate the help.  
Thanks!

I saw the info and no creating a form is not the task of concern.  I am collecting info from multiple desktops daily and long term and will store it for later analysis.  I am writing the interface in actionscript and plan to store data in mysql.  Thanks however.

How about a shared hosting service where the server is set up and you can use it to learn how to do what you want. GoDaddy is like $3 a month.

Good Luck,
Russ

And that's why you're having problems.  Actionscript isn't the language 
you should be using.  If this is being done on a website, you should be 
using Javascript in the client and PHP on the server.

Not really. Plenty of Flash applications out there connect to PHP
scripts serverside.

The problem seems to be more along the lines of not conceptually
understanding how to set up PHP and get to "hello world" on a server
and/or at a web address.
