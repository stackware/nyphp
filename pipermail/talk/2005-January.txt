The best php based bulletin board I have used is vBulletin. Yes it is
commercial, but the quality of the product and support is pretty good.

You can run Knoppix if you have a minimum of 128 Mb (working) RAM. 
Maybe reinserting the ram chips in their sockets (again) 
would be a good thing to do. (seems like there are two 
problems goind on here: flaky ram and corrupted files)

Earlier Susan had said that she was unable to bring up 
her laptop in 'Safe Mode' -- perhaps the master boot record 
is one of the things that got corrupted...

If that's the case, it would seem that booting from another 
device (either a CD or floppy) would be the thing to try. 

But if you (Susan) have a rescue floppy for XP, maybe it would be 
easier to try booting from that. Then once booted in command 
line mode (effectively MS-Dos), copy what's important to 
floppies.

If you have an installation CD, you could try pressing F10 
(or 'R" to repair) at the setup welcome screen. 
(this is the route I would go --  after getting good 
copies of important files)

If you meet strange obstacles while trying to effect a 
repair, you may find entering 'recovery' in the search box 
in the upper right hand corner of  http://support.microsoft.com/winxp 
will produce some helpful ideas.

In addition to the few suggestions concerning Knoppix, I highly 
recommend "Knoppix Hacks" (O'Reilly) which also comes with a Knoppix CD. 
  There are hacks that specifically address "recovery situations" on 
Windows.  And, if you bring it up in text mode -- "knoppix 2" at the 
boot prompt -- you can run it in 64MB (or less).

I have personally used Knoppix to recover a lost Windows Product ID on a 
Win98 system for a friend who had bought a used PC and needed to 
re-install from the win98SE directory on the hard drive.  I even keep a 
copy of Knoppix in my glovebox so's I'll have it "whenever" :)

HTH,
John

p.s. a Happy and Prosperous New Year to all the NYPHP listies...

about mods to their code. phpB we all know about as a security-sieve, which

While I like the flexibility of Creole (http://creole.phpdb.org/) I
benched it along with ADOdb and straight MySQL using the benchmark from
(http://phplens.com/lens/adodb/)

Seems Creole is slightly slower than ADOdb, but nothing comes close to
MySQL, I was wondering if anyone had an opinion on this sort of thing.
With a MySQL cache turned on should I be worried about performance on a
site that is mostly SELECT's?

Hello all,

Some of you have been asking lately about alternative image galleries,
Wikis, and blog-ware for PHP. Here are some of the recent goodies I have
found.

I think some of you may be interested in this rich-GUI PHP Wiki:

PHPTiddlyWiki
http://www.patrickcurry.com/tiddly/

I have only looked at the demo yet, not the code. But from the demo alone
it looks good.

Also,

For those looking for easy/simple photo gallery software, I found the
following:

http://folderblog.tetto.org/

http://www.pixelpost.org/

http://relativelyabsolute.com/spg/

This demo of PixelPost is quite impressive:
http://www.keoshi.com/fblog/index.php?showimage=57

Oh, and finally, a great-looking RSS feed organizer:
http://lilina.sourceforge.net/

(I really need to start a mini-blog / links-blog to preserve and organize
these daily PHP gems.)

Best regards,

- Jay

Having the query cache in MySQL enabled should be adequate.

We did a lot of testing for Mambo, and learned that although ADOdb's
client-side caching was faster than MySQL's query cache (no network
trips at all, as the cache was on the webserver instead of on the
database machine), we also saw the load go up on the webserver
(especially on slower hardware or sites under heavy load).

Finally, after all that work, we discovered that caching the output
(templates, output HTML etc.) gave us MUCH MORE significant results
than any query caching toolkits available.

So you can use whichever caching you prefer, but know that researching
something like PEAR's Cache_Lite would provide infinitely more
performance gains for about the same amount of effort.

That exploit is actually a bug in PHP's unserialize(), not PHPBB.

There are several exploits in 4.3.9 and 5.0.2:

Hello all,

phpBB is full-featured, but has had some prominent security issues in 
the recent past; hence people are recommending against installing it. It 
is easy for virus and worm writers as well as hackers to target software 
that has a large installed base. phpBB is widely installed, hence it is 
widely exploited. (I have not looked at its code, but it could not be 
that bad so popular at the same time, right?)

I have used (an older version of) MiniBB in the past for a low-traffic 
forum:

http://www.minibb.net/

The Wordpress (weblog software) guys used to use MiniBB for their forum 
software, but now it seems they have written their own:

http://bbpress.org/about/

BBpress is supposed to be even lighter and even more secure than MiniBB.

I have also heard that Fudforum is more secure than phpBB:

It is www.fudforum.org , I think, but it seems to be down now.

Best regards,

- Jay

The Sanity phpBB worm used the phpBB Highlight Vulnerability which has  
nothing to do with the unserialize vulnerability. As (only) Derick  
Rethans could put it:

"Everybody who thinks that the Santy.A worm uses one of the security  
problems addressed in PHP's latest bugfix releases is wrong. It was NOT  
due to any bug in PHP, but merely a badly checked input variable which  
was passed to preg with the /e modifier. Besides this, phpBB is also  
vulnarable for some of the things  address by PHP's new releases. But  
they are wrong saying that it is not their fault. Not-checked usage of   
serialized data is still their problem. Short version: use FUDforum."

This isn't to chastise Steve - phpBB rushed with the story that it

I use vbulletin and hack it regularly, as they seem not to care, and
promote it, because you can download hacks at
http://www.vbulletin.org/ - and the only way to download them is to
have a license for vbulletin..

Its easy to navigate the code once you have played with it a bit, and
is actually quite nice to use their registration system/etc as a
homebrewed main site user auth system, as I have written a bunch of
php functions to take username and get userid, validate
username+password as a good combo, etc..

Though when they release a new version, it stinks that you have to
find out your code mods, install the new vbulletin on a test folder,
modify the crap outta your themes and code, and then it should work,
but always has glitches :/

http://www.forumsx.net/ is our network site forums spawned from
war3.com - if you wish to check it out.

I used to have a bunch of automated thread creation scripts for other
parts of the site before the big bad hard drive decided to crash, and
only partial backups were performed, but It isnt too hard, just gotta
know what proper sql tables to edit...

I'm going to stick with vbulletin, since I paid for it (but my free
updates have expired from 1 year after purchase), since it is nice and
I havent had any problems with it at all.

Not really. You can modify the code all you want. Their technical
support may not be able to help you with the modified code (can you
blame them?), but the hack community at http://www.vbulletin.org/
makes up for it more than adequately.

I recently came accross a new feature added by photos.com. They allows
the users to search images based on the color.

http://www.photos.com/en/search/index?srch=Search&cp_color=%23b02020%2B

They are using linux server and i hope it is done in php. Anybody has
any idea how this is implemented. I don't think they are accessing the
image files each and every time - they might be storing the color info
in the db. Any idea how this can be implemented. This is not a
requirement i'm facing - just curios.....

Well, upon a quick somewhat inebriated research session, I found that gd2
has the capability to find the color of a pixel
(http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.imagecolorat.php), which tells me
that you could probably write something in php to 'parse' an image for the
majority color with gd2.  Then again I tend to avoid gd due to how slow it
can be with php, but if gd does it, I'd imagine the functionality being
available with imagemagick and/or pnm. So, I suppose it's possible with php,
although probably slower than an 'outside' solution.

According to netcraft 
(http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?host=photos.com) they are using 
perl not PHP.

FWIW I know that some commercial indexing servers can also determine
physical appearance attributes of images (search for 'red', for
example) and can also be trained with shapes (search for 'tree' for
example).

I'm pretty sure they are using something like that, or are possibly
generating their own keyword lists manually.

My two cents for bulletin board experiences:
 
phpBB had all the options/features I wished to use.
 
WebWarrior.Net uses a postnuke CMS module based directly off phpBB and it has worked like a champ solidly for over two years (including suffering upgrades).
 
I can't comment on vbulletin, as I didn't look into it because it wasn't open source. I also never ran into or used IPB, but a quick gander shows that one to be licensed as well.
 
Granted the pricing for vbulletin and IPB are trivial for some clients, so it really just boils down to the slight user interface/feature differences.

Hi all,

I'm looking to install a bulletin board system on a site I run.
I know this subject was discussed a while back. I was wondering what
the current lowdown on my options are.

Of course free is good but I'm willing to consider other options.
When I checked a couple of years ago, the "big three" were phpbb, ipb
and vbulletin.

Can anyone share their bulletin board experiences ??

Thanx

Solaris 8/Apache 1.3.31/PHP 4.3.9

When checking the processes on the server (commands: ps -el, ps -ef), many
instances of httpd are listed, perhaps 40+.
Is this normal for a busy server? Or is Apache demonstrating unusual
activity and consuming resources inordinately?

Any talk to this topic would be appreciated.

There are some filtering options which 
you can set for the master (binary) log:

binlog-do-db and binlog-ignore-db 

On the slave side there are: 

replicate-wild-ignore-table
replicate-wild-do-table
replicate-do-table
replicate-ingnore-table
and 
replicate-ignore-db
replicate-do-db

replicate-rewrite-db

If this is a problem, you can limit the max slaves in httpd.conf.

Im trying to import data from a database in MySQL 3.23 to another server 
using MySQL 4.0.

Im getting an error creating this table:

ERROR 1064 at line 47: You have an error in your SQL syntax.  Check the 
manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right 
syntax to use near 'show tinyint(1) unsigned NOT NULL default '1',

The SQL looks like this:

CREATE TABLE items (
  s_id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  title varchar(100) default NULL,
  description tinytext,
  price float default NULL,
  pic varchar(50) default NULL,
  show tinyint(1) unsigned NOT NULL default '1', PRIMARY KEY  (s_id)
) TYPE=MyISAM;

Anyone know offhand what changed and how I can modify this to complete 
the import?

And, incedentally, if you're using mysqldump to export the data, there's 
an option to force backticks on table and column names:

|--quote-names, -Q|
    Quote database, table, and column names within ``' characters. If
    the server SQL mode includes the |ANSI_QUOTES| option, names are
    quoted within `"' characters. As of MySQL 4.1.1, |--quote-names| is
    on by default, but can be disabled with |--skip-quote-names|.

Joseph,

That is what I use to access my MSSQL databases from a W2K machine here at work.
I do know that I have the MSSQL client install on my developing machine and MYODBC.
This is my in my include file:
------------
$hostname = "10.5.0.200,1433";
$username = "user";
$password = "pwd";
$dbName   = "dbname";

if($conn = mssql_connect($hostname,$username,$password))
{
}
else
{
  die("DATABASE FAILED TO RESPOND.");
}
----------------

Someone mentioned that if you are on a Linux machine you use the ':".  

The application that I have written (PHP/MSSQL) allows students, parents and teachers to access student
scholastic information vi the internet.

ahh Nestor, 

there is a big difference when connecting to mssql server from a linux
machine that is why that code didnt work for me but does for you :D

csnyder,
i am back to using FreeTDS but do you have any ideas why it seems to
connect but then times out when i execute this query

$res = mssql_query("select * from idxmls1 where mod_date_time
>'2004-1-1 00:00:00'", $conn);
$arr = mssql_fetch_array($res);
echo '<pre>';
print_r($arr);
echo '</pre>';

the following is the error that i get

A bad idea.  Using reserved words will cause you major grief in the long 
run.  Here's a great reference on naming conventions, including a list of

True, much better to remember this in the design phase, and potentially 
a PIA to fix on an existing project.

i see that the problem is MSSQL is using the limit of 8mb ram that can
be used (set in the php.ini)  I guess i would like to know what would
make mssql use 8mb ram, would it be the size of the query results?

i have upped that in my php.ini to 20mb and it even errored saying
that it used all of the 20mb of ram as well

Can you force backticks on mysqlimports?  I?ve tried unsuccessfully.  

 

We have an existing database that has a few key words as table names (group,
status) and the mysqlimports for those tables fail.

 

In the future, we are migrating the database to Oracle, so we?re also
wondering if this will also be a problem with Oracle?

And, incedentally, if you're using mysqldump to export the data, there's an
option to force backticks on table and column names:



--quote-names, -Q 

Quote database, table, and column names within ``' characters. If the server
SQL mode includes the ANSI_QUOTES option, names are quoted within `"'
characters. As of MySQL 4.1.1, --quote-names is on by default, but can be
disabled with --skip-quote-names.

That's a great article, and since it's written by the MySQL's SQL
Standards Engineer, you can be sure that the article is a best practice
for using MySQL moving forward.

I believe they said "mysqldump."

Every database has reserved words.  Oracle escapes such with double quote 
marks (as per the SQL standard).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Where does Zend's Development Environment find its PHP
	extensions?
Message-ID: <41DED97F.2070703@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

Just recently did I get around to trying Zend's Development Environment 
(ZDE) from the CD distributed at the NYTCHP. So far it looks like a 
great product.

I was especially interested in learning about the integrated debugger, 
but ran into some problems with it.

Some background information:

 I chose to install ZDE with PHP5 support on Windows XP.
ZDE bundles a PHP 5 CGI binary stored in C:\Program Files\Zend\bin\php5
The integrated debugger uses this binary to parse and execute scripts, 
and to show their output

I was using the 'local debugger', not the 'server debugger'.

You can debug a file with the following contents to see which extensions 
the Zend PHP binary supports: <?php phpinfo(); ?>
The output of that file lists a whole bunch of extensions, but I could 
not find them anywhere in the C:\Program Files\Zend\ directory! (There 
was no 'ext' subdirectory' and there were no .dll files)

The php.ini file is also stored in the same location
The php.ini file contains only three lines:
zend_extension_ts=C:\Program Files\Zend\lib\php5\ZendDebuggerLocal.dll
zend_debugger.allow_hosts=127.0.0.1/32
session.save_path=C:\Program Files\Zend\tmp

I then tried to debug a file with a call to mysql_connect() but that 
resulted in the output of 'undefined function', so I am now trying to 
find out how I can make Zend's PHP binary support it.
It is probably compiled without MySQL support, but would swapping in 
another PHP CGI binary help? I was thinking it would not, because this 
seems to be a custom-built PHP binary.

Any thoughts on this?

Best regards,

- Jay

If your php.ini file doesn't have a 
extension_dir = "c:\some_dir", you 
will have to enter that directive 
yourself (and populate that directory 
with the proper dll's)

I think you might be better off using server side debugging, even if
you want to test out code on your local machine (and use localhost as
the server).

Zend Studio has two components. The client side IDE (which also
includes the Zend Engine) and a server side component which allows you
to do server side debugging.

That way you can setup your PHP environment the "normal" way.

Let me know if how things turn out for you.

Very normal. I've seen places that set limits on apache, like maybe 1500 or so. 40+ is not that bad. Might want to look at the performance and ram/cpu power of th eserver though. The ones I had doing up to 1500 Apache instances were Sun 420s with, I think 4cpus and 4G ram.

ciao!

My Firebird 0.7 has the problem, unless I stop JS.
php.net says to register and then you can set personalizations to remove 
it. Ain't that a killer.

My Firefox 1.0 doesn't have any trouble (even with JS on).

There was also a request to submit issues/problems on that page. Just

Hi,

I'm looking for some help and directions in order to build a plugin
interface for a small CMS I'm working on as my pet project. I've tried
to study some of the blogs/cms scripts that provide plugins. Most of
these scripts make it easy to develop the plugins/modules, but the
interface itself is very complicated.

Thanks for the help.

Mambo has a pretty extensive and well-documented API for plugins -
ranging from templates to components.  Take a look there and steal
anything you find of value ;-)

All I ask is that if you come up with a better idea, you gotta share ;-)

Hi,

I?m developing a system called TML (Template Markup Language), which provides tools that you can use to build web pages. If a page cannot be constructed with existing tools, you can create new tools that will do that, which is the same as plugins that other projects referring to. I have submitted TML as a project for NYPHP (http://ztml.com/ca/) but they are not interested. If you are interested in giving TML a try, we can work together and build your small CMS.

However, if the CMS that you are building were using system such as Mambo or WordPress, then it would be best to learn how to build the interfaces into those systems. Good luck with your project.

Does anyone know if the comment system on php.net is available for use
in other applications? I know I can get the files through cvs, but was
wondering if there's any documentation or stuff like that.

I'm looking to add commenting features like php.net's to one of my
open source projects. I don't think I want to go so far as using a
full-blown forum package.

Welcome to the wonderful world of open source software. :) Actually,
try sending a list to the php-doc mailing list, they may be able to
point you in the right direction.

I've gotten the impression from browsing their site that their
anti-comment-spam approach is still essentially blacklist-based, and that
you will frequently end up having to play cat and mouse with spammers as
they develop knew ways of beating they latest thing someone came up with
to beat them with. Sorry for the poor sentence.

Um, can you explain this a bit?  I'm trying to understand what you're 
saying here, but my brain has come up with too many possibilities so I 
think it's just better to ask.

I did notice that if a user wants to attach comments to a blog post, 
the following line precedes the comment form:
"Line and paragraph breaks automatic, e-mail address never displayed, 
HTML allowed"

Is that relevant to your comments?

Gee it must've been a worse sentence than I thought. My point is that they
apparently have all these plugins that use all kinds of computational
muscle to defeat comment-spamming, as opposed to the fairly new
MoveableType style system, which relies on the TypeKey authentication
service -- a modest PITA for the legitimate commenter, perhaps, but I have
found it 100% effective and stopping comment spamming.

Have you used the blacklist feature of the WP ?  I am using it and it is 
quite good.  Yes they have plugins for filtering spam comments (IP 
blocking, checking against open proxies list, Bayesian filtering etc.) , 
however even the default blacklist is good enough to effectively catch 
90% of the spam appearing on my blog.

For those interested, the process is outlined at 
http://rajshekhar.net/blog/index.php?p=49


Personally, I am strongly against registration (for either commenting or 
reading).  Some wikis require you to register before you can edit the 
pages. Isn't that silly ? Yes spam is the problem and registration is 
not the solution.

A central-signon authentication system like typekey is just a hurdle in 
the way of spammers, just like captchas, word games, pictures, and 
randomized forms. However, a central authority that cannot be trusted 
(such as typekey) is actually more dangerous,because it purports to be 
somehting blog publishers can "trust" and whenever there is trust there 
is a hack. (Typekey can't be trusted because it doesn't actually 
authenticate anyone.. it just acts as a middleman i.e. hurdle).

Granted the only thing at risk here is your blog, but the point is why 
set up a trusted authority if you can't trust it? In other words, why 
pass off some control to a "central authority" when you went to blogging 
in order to be free of the centralized mamagement system for publishing? 
Sure of course SixApart would never abuse all that information about who 
is commenting on what blog...... just like Google can be trusted with 
knwoing-everything-about-you-via-gmail.

Back to Wordpress... it is cutting edge, so you will find plug ins for 
just about every approach to comment spam management, along with blogs 
chronicling how it did or di not work. Here's a page with links 15 
different approaches (tarpit, google redirector, latency management, 
blacklist, etc etc etc).

Hmm, this is so interesting I'm glad we brought it up (-: I see your point
about handing the keys to the kingdom over to a 3rd party (my words, not
yours, granted...) but OTOH it works (in my experience), and I don't have
to spend ~any~ time perusing blogs dedicated to which of the latest and
greatest anti-spam plugins works best.

Thanks Mitch, I downloaded it and am looking at its source code.
Developing the plugins/modules seems to be pretty easy, but not yet
sure about the interface that detects and runs the plugins. Will let
you know if I make any progress :-)

Another interesting project is SMF, a forum that IMHO looks like it
should be the king of the hill - fast, modular, more secure than
phpBB, and free.  Basically vbulletin for free LOL

http://www.simplemachines.org/smf

They have a web-based plugin browser that lets you select what you
want do install from the admin interface on your own forum, VERY NICE.

Has anyone here installed ZSS and had it cause this problem?

i use a dynamic dns hostname http://codebowl.dontexist.net/phpinfo.php

this domain really redirects to
http://codebowl.homelinux.net:8001/phpinfo.php i do that so that if i
change my port i dont have to tell everyone, it redirects
automatically.

now when i call that page from this local machine, i keep getting the
save dialog in firefox, however when someone else calls the page it
shows the phpinfo()

also i should note that if i use http://localhost:8001/ it loads the
php files for me just fine.

	Browser Close
Message-ID: <000901c4f810$9a1acf70$68e4a144@Liz>

Using PHP, is there a simple way to capture browser shutdown or a session
termination event, so that a user's departure time from a site can be
captured when they don't use the formal Log Out button.

I need to track user time logged into a site. I am using PHP sessions.
Currently, capturing the user Log In efforts and capturing the user Log Out
time when they hit Logout button.

Any solution suggestions for capturing log out time of users who just close
the browser?

This is a possible "almost does it" option. 

The time of every new page hit by the user can be entered as the newest
logout time. So if they never formally logout we at least have an
approximate Log Out time. If they really Log Out, we get the Log Out time
for real.

By the by, there is a way to rig something with JavaScript and the onUnload
event. But it has pitfalls too.

I am surprised now that PHP doesn't offer "on session start" and "on session
end" event capturing, or am I wrong?

Thanks, 

Peter

A possible solution would be log 'on-site' time by saving a timestamp of
every page view.  We do that in-part to prevent additional log-in's from the
same account during a given active timeframe.

Message-ID: <8d9a4280050111114236b2fb3e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

i have a database class that i have created to make working with the
database connections much easier for me, however on my dev machine i
have the following specs

P4 1.4ghz
128mb RDRAM

my question is this....

would my small amount of ram lag my mysql connections?
If i put the site on a live server with more ram etc.. would it load faster?
again this is on my dev machine, however i am thinking it is my
resources that are slowing it almost to a halt, i have never seen a
site (properly coded) that takes 5+ seconds to load the total load
time for this page and profile is
5.5078 seconds (according to my timer class).

i have profiled my app and i see that smarty and my DB::Open method
are what is hogging the load times.  for instance here is my open
method

	public function open() {
		$this->_link = mysql_connect( $this->_host, $this->_user, $this->_pass);
		if ( $this->_link == null ) {
			throw new MySQLEx( '$db->_link == null, connection to
'.$this->_host.' failed');
		}
		if( !mysql_select_db( $this->_database, $this->_link ) ) {
			throw new MySQLEx("could not select database!<br>".mysql_error());
		}
	}

should that really take this long to run?
the rest of the page aside from these 2 objects run around 600 (ms)
each still slow but nowhere near as slow as these 2

here are the results of one such profiling

DNS issue looking up your mysql hostname perhaps?  Can you generate an

What about using <meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="60; http://yoururl">
in the header of the page?

As i understand it, this would try to grab a new copy of the page every
minute (modify the 60 if you want a longer or shorter time).  By keeping
track of when the reloads cease, you'd know when the visitor closed the
browser (or lost network connectivity) even if she/he didn't hit the logout
button.

And surely it'll be no picnic to integrate something like this with your
already existing authentication code (so that it works seamlessly and doesn't
demand a new login on every automatic refresh once a minute).  And if your
pages are places where people can input data (via forms), it'd be a real
drag to have the page automatically reload (and lose the paragraph or so of
text that your visitor just entered in a form field(s)).


	good luck,

What profiler are you using?  The results do seem a bit sketchy.  If 
those are the best you can get from your profiler, you may try to 
follow the process with strace and see what that turns up.

i am using zend studio's profiling capabilities, however when i load
the page in a browser my timer object (times the load time) reports
that it is 5+ seconds

can you give me some insight about strace?

I was using APD however when i installed Zend Studio Server it had
conflicts and i had to remove APD.

Couple of alternate solutions (viable but got pitfalls):

1) Tiny JavaScripted popup or popunder window polls the opener page for it's
existence. When opener page disappears, the popup window does location
change to PHP logout page, processes, and then closes itself. 

2) 1x1 transparent gif src points to PHP script page that polls for
"connectin_aborted" and fires logout script when true.

What about using <meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="60; http://yoururl"> in
the header of the page?

As i understand it, this would try to grab a new copy of the page every
minute (modify the 60 if you want a longer or shorter time).  By keeping
track of when the reloads cease, you'd know when the visitor closed the
browser (or lost network connectivity) even if she/he didn't hit the logout
button.

And surely it'll be no picnic to integrate something like this with your
already existing authentication code (so that it works seamlessly and
doesn't demand a new login on every automatic refresh once a minute).  And
if your pages are places where people can input data (via forms), it'd be a
real drag to have the page automatically reload (and lose the paragraph or
so of text that your visitor just entered in a form field(s)).

Joe,

Did you check all of your queries? That seems to be the other (yet also
typical) long response that was returned. Just seems that if your running
localhost (and your Development workstation is the server), it's most not
likely going to be 'locating issues'... back-to-basics is where i always
start from, I'd go back through once more over the queries, make sure
prefixs exist where they need for tables, change error reporting while you
have the opportunity before the page goes live etc.

How do we look on a PDA? 

Can at least the mailing lists and the future member directory section be
worked to play in a mobile environment?

For the PDA, isn't it a matter of some browser detection, maybe a little CSS
adjustment and maybe some stripped down JavaScript or a little new WML to
get the introductory pages to look good and function on Pocket Internet
Explorer?

Pocket Internet Explorer (PIE) for Pocket PC (PPC) 2003 supports:
HTML 4.0 
XML 
XHTML
CSS
JScript 5.5 (approx. ECMAScript v3 or JavaScript 1.5) 
Animated GIFS
WAP 2.0

Any thoughts?

Hey Peter,

What I have done in the past was include a timestamp in the session
(cookie that is, as well as in an 'online' table in the database), and
after 5 minutes the authentication script updates the timestamp in the
database.  I then have a cron job running every 5 minutes that deletes
any records with timestamps > 5 minutes old.

In essence, if you close the browser or leave without logging out,
your 'session' will get tossed in 5 minutes.

I'd love to hear of other approaches, to see what makes the most sense.

i have tested this way as well and it seems to be the same as using an
object, at first it seemed faster, then i tested the object way again
and using the object actually wasnt as slow this morning, maybe it's
because i am running everything on 128mb ram maybe not.

apps i am running

Xwindows
Zend Studio
Firefox
Gaim
xTerm

i have tried it with closing Gaim and the xTerm and it seemed to go a
bit faster, so i am once again left thinking that it is just a memory
issue that will hopefully be resolved soon.

Message-ID: <1105562474.28757.38.camel@brian.vermonster.com>

Greetings,

I am having a strange data access issue, maybe someone out there could
help (I am a Linux guy and don't know my way around in win32/IIS).  Here
is the environment:

Application Server:
 Windows 2003
 IIS 6.0
 PHP 4.3.10

Database Server:
 Windows 2003
 SQLServer 2000

The App server reports a connection error when attempting to open a
mssql connection to the DB server.  I am using SQLServer Users (not
Windows Users) to authenticate into the DB.  

Looking at the user comments on mssql_connect (php.net), I've tried:
installing MDAC 2.8, changing the Everyone/Anonymous Policy, and
enabling guest accounts.

The connection error is not a native error code, indicating the
SQLServer is not getting the connection attempt (must be blocked at the
server level).

I tried various authentication setting in IIS.  It seems IIS is trying
to pass the web users credentials to the DB server before trying the
SQLServer connection.  Am I missing an IIS security setting?


Quirks:  The exact same code works from IIS 5.0 / Windows 2000 (to the
same DB server), so I think it is an IIS 6.0 / Windows 2003 issue. 
Another disturbing thing we found is if we authenticate Administrator
_and_ the Administrator passwords on the App and DB server match, it
connects!


Any Windows gurus out there with any experience and/or suggestions?


Sorry in advance for the long post, but I've spent days trying to figure
this one out!

Right now we're looking over the featuresets of three: Mambo, ezPublish, and

Personally, I'm ready to jam some Mambo up in here and rock on, but it's a

What other commercial CMS systems out there aren't utter hell on the user

As a Mambo developer I am biased - but can still say in all honesty
nobody can compete feature-for-feature with Plone (www.plone.org). 
The only real needs you have are:

1) you gotta have hardware - the environment is big (think aircraft
carrier) and you will need both reverse proxy servers (I recommend
pound) and a dedicated SMP machine for zope

2) you will need someone with python experience - managing a plone
site is really a no-brainer once you get it installed, but then
someone starts asking about customization, then you get hooked up wth
Archetypes (my favourite feature)...

Those two things handled, it is a VERY powerful environment that will
handle anything they could possibly dream up. I even plugged Zope
hosted on a linux machine directly to a MS SQL server, all with FOSS
goodies (FreeTDS, SQL Relay and some voodoo).

With OpenSourceCMS you can demo just about every single LAMP-based CMS
available, so that should be an afternoon spent wisely. I was drawn to
Mambo over the administration interface, and that opinion is purely
subjective!  To each his own.

I'd like to see your results posted here just for grins, as somebody
seems to ask a similar question once a month.

I'd also like to commend your wisdom in your initial recommendation ;-)

Chris,

I've used MAcromedia's Contribute several times, it's ability to send"timed
access keys", limi editable regions and moe make it a pretty well-rounded
choice, if you're gonna dump in the dough, I'd give MAcromedia the Go...

Depends on the table. Read http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/EXPLAIN.html 
then do

EXPLAIN SELECT count(*) FROM table;

EXPLAIN SELECT count(field) from table;

at the mysql prompt and let us know what you find.

This won't show anything different - there's no where clause, and the
row determination will be the same. That doesn't mean one isn't
faster because you're moving less data around.

I hope that it would optimize this to reading off an internal row
counter rather than fetching all of the rows and counting them. In the
former case, they should be the same. If it's doing the latter,
count(field) will be faster.

But I don't know for sure.

The first one in my example says to me "I don't even need to look at the
table, I already know the answer" and the second one tells me the table
has to be looked at.

Mysql has different table types.  MyISAM tables always know the number 
of rows within the table.  The result of "SELECT (*) from table" is 
always known and should return instantly.

This may not work on other table types however.  For instance, it does 
not work for InnoDB tables.

Those queries are the same performance wise.  Adding in a GROUP BY, however,
could change the query.

Correct... as part of the MyISAM data structure, the number of rows is kept.
However, using a GROUP BY would still cause for a calculation in some cases.

> This may not work on other table types however.  For instance, it does
> not work for InnoDB tables.

These still all work for InnoDB, however InnoDB doesn't keep the number of
rows as part of it's data structure.  So, for a MyISAM table:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable

Will always return instantly, whereas for a InnoDB table, it actually has to
make the count (which makes sense, since InnoDB is ACID transactional).

you might check out DIA as well... it's gtk+ based and GPL'd, it'll run

This is probably OT for this group; if so, I apologize upfront.

A client of mine has a website that runs on IIS using (I think) ASP and
COM (or what ever MS is pushing this week).  The site was originally
outsourced overseas and now they need some changes made.  

This is NOT a full-time position and consulting on web development has
to be your day job.  The client is in Fairfield, NJ. 

If you're interested, please contact me off-list.

As long as we're on the subject, could someone shed some light on this behavior?
It caused me a good amount of hair pulling until I realized what mysql
was doing.

Why doesn't MySQL use the primary key in the second query?
I would think that count doesn't care what column I use, but obviously it does.

I may be missing something here, but why would MySQL use the PK in the second
query?  You didn't ask it to.

Why would you think that? count doesn't care what column you use, but
the optimizer will use an index if it is available.  If an index is not
available, it uses the raw data (read: column).

in fact, there is an example of exactly what you're trying to do.

See http://us4.php.net/manual/en/ref.curl.php

Both queries have the same where clause.
Since the where clause is using a column which DOES have an index, I
would think the parser would be smart enough to realize that in both
queries you'll get the same answer, so why not execute them both in
the fastest way possible (using the index)?

I'm not sure what you mean by "asking" mysql to use an index.

That's what I missed.  I too would have expected the parser to execute
the WHERE clause before the SELECT clause.  

Is this another case where MySQL is nonstandard?

It is standard.  MyISAM has a special optimization that allows a COUNT(*) to
read the table definition directly, whereas most cases, this cannot hold
true.  For example, a row with a NULL in a COUNT(somecolumn)'d isn't
counted.  A WHERE or GROUP BY generally requires a real calculation to be
performed because the contents of each row cannot be assumed, and for InnoDB
tables, this can never be assumed because of multi-versioning.

In the first query, the MySQL optimizer recognizes that it can get 
everything it needs from the index -- and uses it.

Notice the difference between types: range vs. ALL

In the MySQL manual it says:
"The definition of a range condition for a single-part 
index is as follows: 

For both BTREE and HASH indexes, comparison of a key part with 
a constant value is a range condition when using the =, <=>, IN, 
IS NULL, or IS NOT NULL operators" 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Range_access_single-part.html 

It would seem that the optimizer either got befuddled 
by bad statistics or it decided that using the index would require 
more seeks to read both the index and the table versus just 
reading 'all' of the table.

You could coerce the optimizer to go with range by adding 
a limit.

Try explaining "select count(rev_title) from review where 
rev_id > 10000 limit 30000"
(just for fun try explaining with a limit greater than the 
total number of rows in the table)

You might want to try benchmarking with and without 
the limit of 30000 -- to see if the optimizer 
made a good choice.

I think what many have said on this is accurate.  I wanted to further 
say that the short answer to your question is that if the optimizer 
detects it will scan more than 30% of the index tree then it may decide 
not to use the index at all and do a full table scan.  (According to the 
recent docs there are other variables taken into account, but I believe 
the 30% rule is a significant factor.)

You table has 43894 rows and your where clause indicates it will scan 
about 75% of the index tree, thus your second query does a full table scan.

However, the results of your first query can be wholly computed without 
touching the data at all, so it decides not to do a table scan.  You are 
fetching rev_id and using rev_id in the where clause, so it gets 
everything it needs from the index tree.  (It doesn't always work like 
this, but I believe it does for integer based indexes.)

Why would it decide to do a full table scan?  My guess is that it 
doesn't take into account that rev_id is an auto_increment column.  So 
it doesn't know that it can simply start at 10001 and work its way up 
using the index.  For all it knows your index could be a normal index 
with duplicates.  I believe this is related to cardinality.  IOW it 
decides it would be faster to only reference the data (1 disk seek) 
instead of the index tree then also fetch the data (possibly 2 disk 
seeks).

You can hand optimize the second query with 'force index' if you want. 
I've also read that you can use 'max_seeks_for_key' to manipulate some 
of the behavior, although I've never used it myself.

thanx for the explanations everyone!

fyi, i did the following two queries which use the same columns but
return a different number of results. Indeed the %30 rule seems to be
the case.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Shopping Cart?
Message-ID: <20050116024644.GE2879@leitz>

While keeping in mind my relative lack of skill in programming, I may get a request to do a shopping cart. While I still have basic things to find out like the host operating system, etc, what are some other questions I should ask? I'd be more than happy to take an open source existing package and configure it for them.

If they have a unix system and there is an open-source package that meets their needs, what would you suggest as a charge for it? How many hours would you expect to spend on it? I'm inclined, as it's a friend of a friend, to be very easy on cost, especially as I'm not a great programmer and it'd take me more hours to make things work. Of course, it is a profitable company and they sell stuff I like, so I may just as for payment in kind.  :)

Anyway, sorry to ramble. I'm trying to figure this one out, grab it if its a good challenge and politely decline if it's not a good fit for them or I. Any wisdom you care to impart?

ciao!

If you recall, we had the same situation on Postgresql at Trafficmac 
with some of those mondo adserver queries which had gobs of duped 
indices.  That's why I built those summary tables.  I believe that most 
SQL engines are smart enough to see that a flat table scan may be faster 
than diving through an overpopulated index tree.

I guess that means it is a legitimate threat ;-)

Until they fix it, avoid froogle.

It was an html exploit of a froogle security flaw, such that if you 
browsed Froogle and clicked on a malicious link, it could grab some of 
your google account info from froogle, and then use it to compromise 
other google services via your account data (including gmail).

Typical demonstration of the hazards of central sign on.

      Serious flaw in Froogle Reveals Gmail Accounts
      <http://www.aviransplace.com/index.php/archives/2005/01/13/serious-flaw-in-froogle-reveals-gmail-accounts/>

? Aviran Mordo @ 4:24 pm

New security flaw in Google?s price comparison engine, Froogle 
<http://www.froogle.com>, was discovered by an Israeli hacker.

By embedding JavaScript in a URL pointing to Froogle, a hacker can gain 
access to the user?s Gmail <http://www.gmail.com>account. The JavaScript 
redirects the browser to a malicious web site, where the hacker can read 
the user?s cookie, which contains personal information, such as purchase 
history, user name and password for Google <http://www.google.com>services.

According to Nir Goldshlager, who discovered the flaw, even if the user 
chooses not to save the cookie, the hacker can still discover the user?s 
user name and password for other google services such as Google Alerts 
,Google Group because google stores a unique number per user that 
identifies the user is other google services, and the hacker will be 
able to read this identification number.

For clarity, there are reports it has been fixed (unconfirmed byme).

The original report is here (in Hebrew)
http://www.ynet.co.il/NonReg/Ext/App/Billing/BillingRegistration/CdaRegBill_RegScreen1_SubsDetails/1,,,00.html?CG=US&HU=/articles/0,7340,L-3031962,00.html
A second flaw fixed by google on the same day (but not the same issue) 
is here:
http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/holes/story/0,10801,98920,00.html
The slashdot coverage is here:
http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/12/1655246

Since you are reading this via gmail, why doesn't google detect the 
context and insert a nice big banner ad that says "Froogle has been 
fixed! Gmail is safe! Be Happy!"... since they CAN.
(well, that's what I would do if I worked there)

I wonder if any of y'all care to opine about this:

If you were teaching an introductory PHP course (no previous programming
experience required) and you intended to cover some MySQL, would you teach
the "classic" procedural mysql_xxxx API, mysqli, PEAR::DB, or some
combination of the above?

I taught this class last semester and spent some time on mysql_xxx,
followed by PEAR::DB, but next time around I am tempted to require my
victims to run MySQL 4.1 and learn about mysqli.

Gratefully,

Depends on where you want your students to be at the end of the
course. Do you want them to be limited to writing native mysqli calls,
or have an understanding of how to use whatever database was
available?

If the course is on php development, then you should show them how to
write database independent code, and then show what the cons/pros are
of writing the apps with the native libraries instead.

I mean, it is easy to understand how to work with native libraries,
but the more abstract nuances of using classes is always better
explained in the flesh, no? Database abstraction is a perfect scenario
to illustrate the benefits of an OO-based approach.

Thanks Mitch, points well taken. My thinking was, this is PHP and MySQL is
immensely popular, so let's show them one native PHP MySQL API and let's
show them PEAR. There isn't time to get into both mysql_xxxx and
mysqli_xxx, so I have to choose one. The former is of course still widely
used, but the latter is the way of the future, or so I assume.

Of course, I try mightily to teach them principles, terminology and
self-teaching skills such as RTFM, so they should be reasonably prepared
to self-teach whatever we don't get into.

I managed to get the cURL call to work in that it can successfully log 
in, however you can't just redirect the user this simply.

The problem is that sqmail remembers the user by setting cookies, if you 
log them in this way it can't set the required cookies and the user 
would be logged out again as soon as they clicked on anything.

The easiest way to make a 'my email' link is to use a hidden form which 
points to 'http://mysite/webmail/src/redirect.php'.

Something like this ought to do the trick:

<form action="http://mysite/webmail/src/redirect.php" method="POST">
   <input type="hidden" name="login_username" value="<?php print 
$_SESSION['Username'];?>" />
   <input type="hidden" name="secretkey" value="<?php print 
$_SESSION['Password'];?>" />
   <input type="hidden" name="js_autodetect_results" value="0" />
   <input type="hidden" name="just_logged_in" value="1" />

   <input type="submit" value="Login" />
</form>

If you really don't want to have the password on the page it may be 
possible to use the curl request to get the headers then parse out the 
cookies and set them on the user's machine, though this will most likely 
require that your script and the sqmail instance are on the same domain.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] if you were teaching PHP...
Message-ID: <20818-04556@sneakemail.com>

Hmmm.. snce you asked...

You teach them PHP and then you get to the database concept. So you need to
step outside of PHP and show them MySql by itself (just show them.. that
means you do all the work, they don't need to know it all, but you show
them command line mysql like you were preparing for a dynamic website. All
MySQL.

Then you step out of MySql and *discuss* how PHP can integrate the database
with the website.... call on mysql for data, generate HTMl etc. Still no
PHP-mysql coding, just mysql commands and PHP coding.

Then, since this all makes great sense and they have seen the power of
MySql and understand how HP should be able to automate the crap out of that
commandline process, yu give them a real-world dose of coding mysql in php.
That's manual coding with num_rows and fetches and all. Sur eit's tedious
but it's didactic, and you're the one who chose to be a teacher ;-)

Once it is clear what a PITA this PHP-MySql thing is, suggest that other
dbms/file systems might be better suited. Take a peek at sql lite, php
itself  without a db/fs, and hopefully you've made the point that MySql is
nutritious. Maybe mention postgres as that other unwieldy open source one;
jst to be fair ;-)

Now at this point they see that databases are 1.) alot of work  2.) tedious
and repetitive and 3.) essential for many website projects. Your success
will depend on your ability to sow them the vision of a properly integrated
PHP/MySql system...CSS and all. Not always as easy as it sounds.

Only then would I go into PEAR:DB and abstraction. I would approach it via
the concept of abstraction. That way you get to start them on a path
towards writing their own MySql function libraries, since they "know" php.
Now quickly abandon that crazy idea, adopt PEAR based on it's claims and
Dan's evident genious and utmost confidence in it, demonstrate the
commitment required and the platform dependencies (maybe this will
introduce them to the idea of third-party dependencies?), and hopefully
nudge them conceptually towards the concept of interfaces and OOP.

Since it is a first course, this deeper stuff is meant to wet their
appetite -- PHP as advanced such that it really has conquered the practical
issues but the programmer needs to master the concepts in addition to
developing coding skillz. But all of that is not available to every PHP
programmer. 

As it gets deep, be sure to provide practical "but here's what we realy do"
examples. Don't be afraid of coding mysql queries for small projects; don't
get to deep into custom abstraction; don't be afraid of PEAR but understand
what you're getting into when you adopt it; understand how PHP addressed
the core issues with mysqli, available at your nearest $5/month hosting
company any century now; and of course emphasize how separation of data
management from coding from designing from information architecture **FROM
SEO REQUIREMENTS**  is so essnetial for anything larger than you local
church website.

Phew. Good luck!

I am locking down the outline of next weeks NYPHP meeting talk on SEO
considerations on LAMP (see htp://ww.nyphp.org for details).

I am now offering a "last call" to anyone who wants to suggest that some
particular topic get included, or question addressed. 

SEO(SEM, website optimization, ROI, marketing, or whatever you want to call
it today) is so broad and encompasses so much, we'll touch on a small
fraction. I have of course included my favorite topics, and the ones I
think can best highlight/demonstrate the opportunities for PHP.

If anyone would like to sugest anything please post or email to me and I'll
be sure and give it consideration. Also, if you have a website you would
not mind used as an example, send me the URL.

Since abstraction is "hiding" the classic procedural, meaning you have 
to ultimately talk to MySQL, or any database, with what it understands, 
I'd teach them both.  First, the classic, then the abstract (PEAR). 
Given the amount of time, I would cover PEAR::DB over against ADODB for 
the simple fact that there is a lot more happenin' in PEAR and they 
should be exposed to what it offers--besides DB abstraction.  Of course, 
it wouldn't hurt to provide an example of ADODB where they don't have to 
actually code and run it.

As to learning the syntax of basic SQL statements, I'd spend some time 
entering basic SQL commands using the MySQL command line client  (demo 
the MySQL GUI too!) before coding it in PHP.

That said, I would also make sure they learn mysqli.  If that sounds 
like a lot, it is.  I'm sure anyone who has taught (and learned!) 
programming appreciates the time that can be saved by providing 
partially coded examples (for a worksession) where they only have to 
complete a small percentage of the code.  After all, it's not a data 
entry or typing class.  You can provide complete examples as a part of 
the course documentation.  They need to walk away with a good 
representation of what they are actually going to run into "out there".

It pretty much boils down to how much time they have for *doing*.  I'd 
rather cover 70% of "the material" and have them feel comfortable with 
90-95% of it rather than trying for "100%" of the material and have them 
feel comfortable with 65-70%.  It's about building confidence as well as 
skills.  At the end of a class, I want them to say: "Wow, I really 
learned a lot!" and *not*  "The instructor was really knowledgable".

my $0.02 for what it's worth,
John

I won't repeat what other people have already said (which are great
answers) but I do have another angle to throw in the mix.

Most people will, at some point, will be involved with code that they
didn't write.

When I teach PHP, apart from the goal of teaching students how to
create their own applications, I also try to give them the knowledge
needed to understand other people's code. Either at a workplace, or
reading the source of an open source package.

I know this isn't a PHP related issue, but I'd love to hear a little
about not over doing it. I know google will penalize you if it thinks

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Dynamic Textbox
Message-ID: <ef613e5d05011723054a9e5616@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to add dynamic textboxes in a form. 
The javscript function to add the textbox is this 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
function addAttribute()
{
	count++;
	divA = document.getElementById('divAttribute');
	divA.innerHTML = divA.innerHTML + ".... <input type='text'
name='attributes[]' maxlength='200' size='35'> .....";

}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Inside the form i have a block "<div id='divAttribute'></div>" whose
contents will change when i click a button which calls the function
addAttribute();

Now the function is working fine except that in firefox, innerHTML is
not giving the value i typed into the textboxes. So each time i add a
textbox, the values i typed into the previously added textboxes are
lost. This is happening in firefox only. In ie it is working fine.
When i tried to list the elements in firefox, i found that the
dynamically added textboxes are not appearing in the list.
Yet gmail's "Attach a file" is working fine in mozilla. wondering what
they are doing...
Has anyone encountered a similar problem before? 
Any thoughts/alternatives?

Run javascript:  and see if it finds any errors.
Also when you enter informaton in the box, wy don't you
have a box pop up to display the values of the elements
you want to see.  It wll help you debug your code.

It is not a matter of javascript error..Mozilla is not retaining with
values i typed into the textbox while taking innerHTML for the div.
However ie is retaining it. Thank you for your time.

Gentlemen,

Thanks a million.

For brevity's sake I didn't go into the approaches and techniques that I
used last time, and it's reassuring to see that several things you advise
are exactly the things I do (e.g., when you get to MySQL, first teach
MySQL as MySQL independently, and then get into how PHP talks to MySQL).

Of course, I'm still not settled on the mysql(i) curriculum question that
brought me here, but what else is new?  With this as with so many other
questions, you gather information, then make your own decision;  there's
no one omniscient patriarch or omnipotent authority to tell you what to
do. (Hmm, good sermon to put into one of my lectures (-: )

That's exactly why database abstraction is a necessity - with PEAR's
DB or ADOdb it doesn't matter if you need mysql or mysqli (or any
other database)...

PEAR is in there, absolutely. The only question is which if any native PHP
MySQL API to cover in addition.

Message-ID: <8d9a428005011809287cb6eb80@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

does gmail handle it's headers differently than other email services / clients?

I have setup a script that sends a contact form information as a very
basic HTML email, however in gmail it doesnt accept the headers,
instead it prints them as part of the message.  Yahoo on the other
hand it works perfect with.




Here is the source of the email according to GMail

Yes, but you then don't get any of the benefit of a particular database's API.  Not to knock PEAR::DB, but it can't possibly be aware of each feature available in the various DB's.

Those who know me know I don't favor DB abstraction, so this will be biased, and frankly I don't know that much about PEAR::DB.  Can it support prepared statements?  Can it support cursors (server side)?  Can it support collation? etc...

While DB abstraction can be useful for simple apps, and is something worth learning about, large applications never use generic abstraction, since they are rarely deployed on multiple databases.

That said, abstraction within the application - that is, "custom" abstraction written specifically in the application, and for their database - can add a lot of value, since it can expose the needed features for that db/app combo.  Lastly, knowing how a database works, and thus how to talk to it in the most efficient manner, is central in a successful and scalable application.

Okay so let's be honest. How many real world applications have actually 
been scaled up without a rewrite of the database? C'mon... a show of 
hands would be nice.

Message-ID: <DCDD52CA-6998-11D9-A617-0050E4D91728@click3x.com>

Hello,

I need some advice to find out how much I should charge for this 
thing...

I created this simple content-management app for my boss. It allows him 
to create "extranets" for clients and then post stills, movie clips and 
other documents to the extranets so the clients can view and approve 
them. It's been online for about a year now and I've made some 
improvements to it, because of feedback I got from users. It's got all 
the standard login forms, user creation forms, etc. It was also the 
first real app I ever built in php.

Anyway, there's a number of clients who like this extranet thing and 
have asked me to build them one too. My question is this, how much 
should I charge?

Knowing that I "developed" it while I was at work (though web 
programming is NOT the core of my work, it was more like a side 
project). It really wouldn't require me to do much more programming, 
just setting up their DB, phpmyadmin, etc, change the look a little bit 
(color scheme and so on). Also, some of the interested parties are 
"production companies" who budgeted over 100 Grand for some TV 
commercials, but also there's some individual artists (editors, special 
fx artists) who asked me to build them one too. So how much should I 
charge for the company, and how much should I charge the individual?

thanks for your input,
Greg

That may be true, but if you are really big on PL/pgSQL, for instance ,  
migration to MySQL is going to be a lot more than recreating the DB  
tables and deciding how best a Postgres boolean will be represented in  
MySQL.

In fact, unless great care is taken in representing data types alone,  
(I think Daniel has a Power point about this somewhere), it's going to  
be as much work recreating the DB as it is porting the PHP code.

here's the presentation I mentioned up there:

Sorry about the Power Point line. It's a presentation. Kind of like

If you developed the code at work while "on the clock", it is not yours. 
It's a "work for hire" and the copyright belongs to your employer.

http://biz.findlaw.com/intellectual_property/source/faqs/faq292.html

"A copyright is owned by the artist who created the work, unless the artist 
sells the copyright or the work was "made for hire." Generally speaking, 
work made for hire is something that was created by an employee while on 
the job, or by an independent contractor who was hired to create the work. 
The copyright on work made for hire belongs to the employer or the party 
who commissioned the work.

An employee who writes an article, designs a web page, creates a computer 
program, or draws an illustration for a company publication is creating a 
work for hire. Even if the artist is not technically an employee, if a 
court determines an employment relationship exists between the artist and 
the employer, the artist will not own the copyright on his or her work. If 
an employee creates a work on his own time, it probably is not work for 
hire, even if the employee uses it on the job.

I've used Navicat, although not for XML purposes.  It is a great product, and I've seen it recommended to customers for XML and MySQL.

Yeah, phpMyAdmin is likely to fall short.  Depending on how much data it is, you could just load the whole dataset, and then manipulate it in SQL.  Other than that, Navicat should work well, or a quick PHP script to do it (maybe build a CLI version of PHP 5 just for this XML job?)

==================================================================


the better question is... why do those other people want to use it?

1. They know how your company has been using it, so they are comfortable
choosing it as well.

2. They know you, and are choosing you to make it work for them, too.

3. They have considered all other options (commercial, free/os CMS, blogs,
groupware) and determined that yours is the best choice.

I would bet it is #1 and #2, in which case you should recognize it is YOU
that have value, and not your code. Ask your boss if he wants to be in the
business of providing web services like this. If he is, perhaps you'll lead
up a new division. If he is not, negotiate a deal where you are free (with
written permission) to do this, with this code, and with his clients, on
your own. Of course put the raw codd into that document, so that there is a
record of exactly what the code is that you worked on while on the clock.
later, wen yu re-write the whole thing from scratch without a single copied
line of code, this will be important.

If it really is #3, then figure out what it is that makes it so unique and
ask your boss to either a) pay to get a patent and/or file formal copyright
or b) give you a written statement that he does not want to purse
intellectual property ownership of it, and you can.

The idea that company time means company ownership is not absolute. In many
cases the company has to either pursue it or drop it. Of course the hard
part is when they know this and they file just enough paper to retain the
rights but not enough to make it happen (big corps are already setup that
way). It doesn't sound like you are in that spot.

Of course I am not a lawyer and have never built a megablockbuster software
app or stewarded a dot com success or anything else for that matter, so
take this advice for the value of the bandwidth it was ransfered over 9the
first time).

Data On The Fly - By Daniel Lyons - Forbes.com - January 18, 2004
http://www.forbes.com/2005/01/18/cz_dl_0118streambase.html

NEW YORK - Relational databases are great, but not for everything, 
*Michael Stonebraker* says.

He should know. The former computer science professor at University of 
California, Berkeley is a bit of a legend in the database world, having 
created two well-known relational database systems, Ingres and Postgres. 
Ingres, the company Stonebraker founded, is now part of *Computer 
Associates International* (nyse: CA 
<http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=CA> 
- news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=CA> - 
people 
<http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=CA>). 
Stonebraker also founded *Illustra*, a database company that was 
acquired by *Informix*, which later was acquired by *IBM* (nyse: IBM 
<http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=IBM> 
- news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=IBM> - 
people 
<http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=IBM>). 


Now Stonebraker has launched a new database software company to tackle 
one of the toughest jobs in computing--analyzing huge amounts of 
streaming data on the fly.

It is a job Stonebraker says ordinary database programs made by IBM, 
*Microsoft* (nasdaq: MSFT 
<http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=MSFT> 
- news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=MSFT> - 
people 
<http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=MSFT>) 
and *Oracle* (nasdaq: ORCL 
<http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=ORCL> 
- news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=ORCL> - 
people 
<http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=ORCL>) 
simply cannot handle.

"Relational databases are one to two orders of magnitude too slow," says 
Stonebraker, who is chief technology officer at Streambase, a 25-person 
outfit based in Lexington, Mass. "Big customers have already tried to 
use relational databases for streaming data and dismissed them. Those 
products are non-starters in this market."

In a recent pilot program, Streambase was able to analyze 140,000 
messages per second, while a leading relational database--Stonebraker 
won't say which one--could handle only 900 messages per second. 
Streambase has 12 customers now testing its software, all of them 
financial services companies that need to analyze rapid-fire ticker 
feeds and other streaming data.

Stonebraker calls his product a stream processing engine. On top of that 
engine, customers write applications to handle specific tasks, using a 
version of Structured Query Language that traditional database programs 
use. Streambase's version is called StreamSQL and is designed to handle 
data on the fly.

Unlike traditional database programs, Streambase analyzes data without 
storing it to disk, performing queries on data as it flows. Traditional 
systems bog down because they first store data on hard drives or in main 
memory and then query it, Stonebraker says.

The company's approach to making sales is pretty simple: "We ask big 
customers to point us to their hardest problems. Then we say go home and 
write the application on our own nickel and come back in a week with it 
running," Stonebraker says.

Streambase grew out of research conducted in computer science 
departments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where 
Stonebraker has been teaching, as well as Brown University and Brandeis 
University. The three universities hold equity stakes in Streambase, 
alongside venture backers Bessemer Venture Partners and Highland Capital 
Partners.

Streambase runs on industry standard servers running *Intel* (nasdaq: 
INTC 
<http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=INTC> 
- news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=INTC> - 
people 
<http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=INTC>) 
microprocessors and the Linux operating system, and on *Sun 
Microsystems* (nasdaq: SUNW 
<http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=SUNW> 
- news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=SUNW> - 
people 
<http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=SUNW>) 
servers running Solaris. A version that runs on Microsoft Windows will 
be available soon.

Streambase charges customers annual subscriptions for its software, 
setting prices based on how many CPUs a customer uses to power the 
software. Typical deals so far have ranged from $100,000 to $300,000 a 
year, says Barry Morris, Streambase's chief executive.

For now Streambase is focusing attention on financial services 
companies, which hope to do things like track how well traders are 
performing on a real-time basis, rather than aggregating trades at the 
end of the day and analyzing them overnight.

Very Interesting,

also very expensive *ouch*

i guess i really dont understand how this would work, i see it doesnt
store any data on a hard drive, but where does it store it? if it is
there for others to grab via stream it must be stored somewhere.  This
confuses me i guess :D

<snip>

I'm wondering if this is the guy whose lecture I attended about two
years ago over at Steven's?  The lecture was about a new relational
database technology and he had Chris Date opening up for him!

The interesting part was his basic premise: conceptually, data is stored
in rows and columns in tables. That is how the database designers thought of
it as well; when they stored the data on the hard drive, they wrote it in
rows and columns! This fellow pointed out that there was no need for
this and proceeded to show how things could be sped up with a different
data structure on the hard drive (something similar to a linked list,
IIRC).  It was one of those "DOH!" moments.  I immediately thought "Open
Source people could implement this with no problem!".  Too bad I don't
code at that level anymore.

He then went on to describe some other improvements he had made in the
design.  I had to leave, but my buddy said he then demonstrated how fast
things got and it got the whole room excited.

Sounds funny coming from a MySQL guy. (rimshot)

> While DB abstraction can be useful for simple apps, and is something worth learning about, large applications never use generic abstraction, since they are rarely deployed on multiple databases.

All I can tell you is that after working on sites that get 10 million
visitors daily, had I coded anything to a native API the whole thing
would have died a horrible death!  When you are really pushing the
limits, native APIs are what kill you, not save you - as you end up
worrying more about scaling and redundancy, where a more generic
communication-presentation-application-data layered approach will save
your bacon time after time. Something like:

  Load Balancers <=> Webservers <=> Application Servers <=> Databases

As a matter of fact, the biggest site I ever worked on ended up going
the java route, where database transparency was one of the main goals.
(Not my decision as I had moved on, but you get the point.)

If you implement an application that maxes out mysql's functionality
for example (mitchy bites tongue), you are then going to lose a lot of
effort if you decide to put SQL Relay in front of your database
servers. Ok, maybe not logical for MySQL, but for something like
Oracle (where OCI connections have lots of overhead) this progression
happens frequently, and apps end up getting partially rewritten in
order to decouple the logic from the database layer to accomodate the
connection pool...

> That said, abstraction within the application - that is, "custom" abstraction written specifically in the application, and for their database - can add a lot of value, since it can expose the needed features for that db/app combo.  Lastly, knowing how a database works, and thus how to talk to it in the most efficient manner, is central in a successful and scalable application.

The first sentence is dead on, and Mambo's database class is a good
example. Still native MySQL calls, but nice abstraction to make the
interface simple and predictable for 3rd party developers.

Knowing how databases work is *critical* to learning how to write
useful software, as poorly-designed applications are also difficult to
maintain, let alone scale.

Which does bring up a great debate - where do you draw the line
between portability and native functionality?  If you have PostgreSQL
or Oracle, then does it make sense to load up all of your DML into the
database as stored procedures, for example? I used to think that way,
but also was convinced at the time that there were limited options on
the database server side; and now that is just not the case, with
PostgreSQL and Firebird around (and yes, even MySQL is catching up
with 5.0)   ;-)

Ditto for the HTTP layer - do you write some apache modules for speed,
or just keep everything in available (and portable) environments such
as PHP/python/etc.?

Sounds like you could probably sell this really well, and if you 
developed the thing "at work", perhaps as you were developing your 
programming skills, it probably was not done as well as you could do it 
now. I'd suggest you map out just what you want it to do, rebuild 
(stronger, faster, better), and make it really pretty. Sell, retire a 
millionaire, etc.

Pure speculation, but could be in memory (RAM), which is increasingly

That's an interesting take, that is, adding code to enforce proper architecture.  I see what you're saying, but at the end of the day the more code something executes, the slower it'll be.  Now that's not to say a minor abstraction for proper replication handling, for example, isn't a good thing.

Quite true, and frankly, Java kind of has the best of both worlds.  JDBC drivers are "abstractions" but written particularly for that database, ie, they expose the same interface but are native calls themselves.  It's a totally different layer of abstraction than, let's say, PEAR::DB.

Agreed, but this is most often and best done with application layer DB abstraction.  Per above, implementing fault tolerance with replication requires some layer of abstraction, but I wouldn't (and couldn't) do it with a generic abstraction.  Fault tolerance between, let's say, MySQL and Oracle, just wouldn't work with a generic abstraction that tries to cover PostgreSQL, MSSQL, SQL Lite, Access, Sybase, and TimesTen.

Agreed 100%; this is application layer database abstraction, not generic.

That actually brings up an excellent point.  Stored procedures are the ultimate in database abstraction, and frankly makes the most sense.  At the same time, companies are founded and make millions on porting stored procedure code, so in the end, portability is often a marketing term.  No database implements the same stored procedure language, and although SQL2003's PSM language is considered standard these days (which MySQL is implementing from scratch after learning the mistakes of everyone else), there's still a porting process to the standard.

DB abstraction can happen at various levels, and should.  But overly abstracting database access is often more of a hassle than advantage, especially as the complexity of the application increases.

And I smell the seeds of a presentation here :)

Read the article folks :)

-- quote --
Streambase analyzes data without
storing it to disk, performing queries on data as it flows. Traditional
systems bog down because they first store data on hard drives or in main
memory and then query it,
-- end quote --

1. It isn't storing the data. period. it's just allowing you to query
it as it streams.
Think of a constant flow of stock market prices as a stream.
I'm guessing you can query something like:
Select * from stream where symbol = 'IBM' and price > 100;

2. this ISN'T a relational database. the title says "Relational
databases are great, but not for everything"

I think the term "database" is a bit misleading here, since most
people immediately think relational when they hear the term database.

yes i understand it is streaming data, however even streaming data has
to be stored somehow, you cant just have data on the computer and not
stored anywhere :D

and if it is streaming what's to say you wont "miss" a quote by not
querying at as it is going through the stream?

Nope, not true. I have a central log server that just outputs to a pipe.
I have scripts that watch the pipe for certain info, and perform certain
acts, depending on what they see. I think this is sorta the same thing.

I'm sure that a certain amount is in a read buffer...

This is not news. Relational databases are widely known to be slow,
which is why you have throw things like Oracle at the problem before
you get anything close to realtime analytics, and even they fall down
a lot. Relational databases, however, are mature and stable. This
doesn't sound like an alternative to a relational database, but a
complement - you still have to store the data somewhere.

I wonder if they've done speed comparisons vs. a relational database
that's entirely in memory (or properly tuned). Technique alteration is
one thing, but just saying "the whole thing's in RAM" isn't a
revolution.

This may be a naive question, but, well... Do you suppose PEAR::DB is
written the way it is (rather than more like JDBC) because PHP 4 doesn't
support the notion of interfaces? I can imagine a PEAR::DB for PHP 5 whose
factory-style constructor returns a class that implements an interface.

They are two different things. PEAR is a framework.
PEAR::DB provides a layer of abstraction which can 
mask the idiosynchracies of the underlying SQL syntax(es).

PEAR:DB has to fit in with the PEAR structure -- 
how it handles errors etc. (some of the framework, in my 
opinion, tries to make up for the deficiencies of the PHP 4 object 
model -- which may be what you said).

JDBC, on the other hand, provides a connection to a 
database with a subset of functionality.

So PEAR:DB can help to make SQL statements portable.

JDBC, on the other hand, makes the data itself portable 
by offering a lobotomized wersion of SQL to databases 
which support a JDBC connection.

Hi all,

My take on using PEAR DB is as follows:

It is a good thing, because it not only helps make your application more 
portable between different database vendors (e.g. between MySQL and 
Oracle) but also between multiple database versions from the same 
database vendor (MySQL 3.x and 4.x vs. MySQL 4.1). What I mean is that 
if you are using the old MySQL client library in PHP (mysql_connect() ) 
with MySQL 3.x or MySQL 4.0, and then you upgrade to MySQL 4.1, your 
application will break. This is because to access MySQL 4.1 PHP needs 
the new MySQL client library (mysqli_connect() - note the extra 'i'). 
So, if you use PEAR DB, you can make migration of your PHP scripts 
between different versions of MySQL much easier.

Agree wholly with Jay's sentiments. Beyond that, imagine that you are
writing software that you are going to give away (open source) or will
have multiple installations, maybe even become a commercial product.

One of the main reasons MySQL is so pervasive is that nobody wants to
support anything else, dare I say the MS Office of FOSS databases
(gasp!). FOSS is all about choice, and there are plenty of great
choices in the database arena...

Seriously, if you are writing a web-based app that you are going to
distribute, even commercially, you would be insane to tie it directly
with any particluar database's API. Why would you force someone to use
a database when it is so easy to let them decide for themselves?

And this is not an anti-MySQL rant, I'd be just as peeved if all the
sudden everything on sourceforge required PostgreSQL, Firebird or any
other database.

Sure, if you are writing a proprietary application that will only have
one install, and will be deployed such that every minute API call
could make or break performance, then the native API is the only way
to go. But that is the only scenario where I have seen such
justification, and also do not agree with that architectural strategy.

i cannot really comment on this to tell you what you should do. 
However what i will do is tell you what would apeal to me from a
student perspective.

Everything i know i have taught myself, i have learned to use
phpmyadmin php etc..

I would like to see a course that would teach the basics of php, and
when time to go to mysql, focus on mysql for a while, talk about what
makes mysql stand out from the rest, teach them how to admin it from
the command line, then when all said and done show them phpmyadmin :D
and move on to more advanced php stuff.

command line is something i need to learn sometime soon lol and more
adv sql stuff.

Hey Folks:

The original email asked whether to go with mysql*() or mysqli*() 
functions.  I'd suggest mysqli*(), since that's where things are going and 
they're quite different.

Whether to teach that over PEAR DB, well, depends on what the class is 
about and what your goals are.  They both have their place.

I think he was saying they are too slow for *this application* streaming 
data).

I posted this because it described querying data as it streams by, not 
because it is a replacement for the relational database. Sometimes we 
get caught up in the constraints of technology, and don't see innovation 
as easily as we might.

How many people are grabbing RSS feeds, storing them to a database, 
querying them, and using the results of the queries? And of those cases, 
how many consider old data worth saving?

For example, what if Feedster was querying a massive aggregate RSS 
stream instead of a database? What if the results where then streamed to 
another site, which displayed tag-based trending of that result set? 
What if......

I like stuff that makes you think outside the box... while at one 
company someone is parsing and sorting and categorizing and his team is 
optimizing databases, balancing servers and scaling and the company is 
utilizing the result set for ecommerce, while at a competitor someone is 
processing the stream and utilizing it for ecommerce. Faster to 
conversion, faster to maximizing ROI, more flexible, less overhead.

How many cpu cycles and GB of storage are dedicated to log file/log 
analysis these days, just to produce periodic traffic summaries? I know 
many people have gone to work on inserting rdb's so they could better 
manage that process... only to run itnto massive scaling issues. If only 
they could process the stream?

We do things like this, and Flow data munging. On an OC-48, that's a LOT of
data. We have a telecon/webinar scheduled with them for tomorrow PM. It
should be interesting.

I agree.  Although I don't know all that much, everything I do know
I've taught myself.  I think one of my main disadvantages is that I
don't know all of the basics that someone from a structured class
might learn, and therefore progressing to advanced topics might be
more difficult for me.

Thanks. I have been thinking the same way. Teach with a view towards the
future -- if need be, they will be able to teach themselves "classic"
mysql*() easily enough by the time I get done with them.

Hear hear. The goal is to provide a solid PHP foundation and overview of
what's out there, and I think it's appropriate introduce them to some
PEAR, so why not DB. Last time we covered both mysql*() and PEAR::DB; this
time we'll cover mysqli and PEAR::DB.

Thanks again to all. It's been illuminating.

Message-ID: <F49D6BA0-6A76-11D9-A0F2-000D933C4BA8@musgrave.org>

List -

I am having a problem with a content management system that I wrote 
running on a Speakeasy shared host.  I use session to store variables 
to maintain state such as the primary key ID for a content row I am 
updating.

For the most part, this works really well, but from time to time 
something goes wrong and it feels like the session gets wiped out or a 
formerly used primary key ID reappears into the session, overwriting 
the current primary key ID and causes me to overwrite that record in 
the database.

I haven't actually witnessed this occurrence, as it happens only about 
5 percent of the time, according to the person who is reporting it.

I think I have read somewhere in passing that if shared hosts are not 
setup properly, sessions from other virtual domains can conflict or 
that session is flaky altogether.

I have reason to suspect that the server isn't setup properly because 
when I use $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], it points to a directory that is 
somewhere else in the file system.  Somebody told me that this is 
because they are cheating and using symbolic links.  I'm not a server 
guy and I haven't been able to get a straight answer from the hosting 
provider support staff.

I should note that this CMS has run on at least 5 other shared hosting 
environments and it has been a problem.

Thanks,

Stephen

Hi:

You didn't give a lot of relevant information, but let me guess.  
Consider changing session.save_path.  More importantly, carefully read the 
manual about sessions: http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php

On shared servers, I generally try to avoid using the server's global tmp
folder and instead use a 'local' one.

In your php.ini, htaccess or ini_set() you can do that with the following
vars:

# for file upload temp files
upload_tmp_dir = '/path/to/a/local/hidden/tmp/folder/'

# for sessions on your site
session.save_path = '/path/to/a/local/hidden/tmp/folder/'

On a few servers I've worked on you usually get access to a folder just
'above' the public_html folder:
/home/username/public_html/
/home/username/tmp/ <-- great place for a local tmp folder

And here's some info about setting those values properly:
http://education.nyphp.org/phundamentals/PH_ini.php?expiredate=2/16/2004

This is also more secure (as long as the shared host is jailed / sandboxed
somehow), as your sessions and upload temp files aren't sitting in some
shared folder that everyone on the server has access to.

On a side note, anyone here use pair.com?  I just ran into something very
disturbing on their shared servers that I'd like to tell you about off-list.

Does speakeasy employ clustering or load balancing on their web servers?
If they run multiple machines (with your home directory NFS mounted), 
the sessions data could be written to /tmp on one machine and not the 
other. This would result in your session disappearing if you hit the 
"second" web server and also cause old data to reappear if you were to 
hit the "first"/original one again.  Using the MySQL sessions handler 
would prevent this problem.

Well, the marketing text says, "Host your website on our professional, 
managed webcluster," but i'm not 100% sure that implies the technical 
architecture.

I did a bit more research and it appears that my use of the simple PHP 
session with a clustered environment is a no-no unless using a local 
session directory.  Thanks for pushing me in the right direction.

Hey everyone,

i am still struggling to get PHP to connect to a remote database.  I
am now using a windows host since connecting from linux was a true
pita.  However i still cannot get it to work properly.

this is the code i have that doesnt work at all, always says failed to respond


if($conn = mssql_connect($hostname,$username,$password)) {
 
 mssql_select_db($dbName) or die('cannot select db');
 $sql = "select id, bath_level from idxmls1 where mod_date_time
>'2005-1-1 00:00:00'";
 $res = mssql_query($sql, $conn) or die('query error');
 $data = mssql_fetch_array($res) or die('fetch error');
 
 echo '<pre>';
 print_r($data);
 echo '</pre>';
}
else
{
 die("DATABASE FAILED TO RESPOND.");
}

here is some example code that i found, it connects and starts
retrieving data however i am not sure how to use this type of COM and
could use some direction as to what to search for. I did a search for
ADO and i hadnt a clue what i was looking for lol.

$db = new COM("ADODB.Connection");
$dsn = "DRIVER={SQL Server};
SERVER=207.76.168.21;UID=******;PWD=******; DATABASE=******";
$db->Open($dsn);
$rs = $db->Execute("select * from idxmls1 where mod_date_time
>'2005-1-1 00:00:00'");

Your post reminded me of an problem I have with shared hosts. Is there 
any way to hide/protect the mysql login/password from other users who 
may have shell access to the same machine? Since the php script 
permissions must be accessible to the web server, anyone could write a 
script which would load and display the source code of any other php 
script on the same machine.

i should also note i have tried adodb from pear's repository

http://killingtonholiday.accuwebhosting.biz/test.php

it wont even connect to the remote database using the ip,port and it
wont connect without the port either.

I know this doesn't help you with phplot, but I feel that you'll get
more bang for the buck with this solution that creates the graphs in
flash:

Here's one possible solution:

http://shiflett.org/articles/security-corner-mar2004

See the part about using Apache SetEnv directives. The only downside here
is that you need your sysadmin's cooperation but it's not an unreasonable
request imho.

I t seems like the only way I can get PEAR Auth to use cookies is with 
session.use_only_cookies .
session.use_cookies was enabled but the URLs were being rewritten by 
default even though my client was accepting cookies.

Kind of vague, I know, but since everthing works fine when I toggle 
use_only_cookies, I find it strange.

I forgot to mention another possible solution. Run in cgi mode under
php-cgiwrap, so your scripts run as you; then chmod your scripts to 600 so
others (such as 'nobody' and your fellow hosting customers) can't read
them.

suexec does this too.
The only problem is the performance hit with CGI (not sure if 
mod_fastcgi will help here).

On our new shared web server, for security, no customers have shell 
access ;-)

i am retrieving records from a database where the images are stored in
the DB, when i retrieve them it says that $row['medium_photo'] is an
array, when i print_r it's all indexes of numbers, i guess my
questions is can anyone point me to a resource where i can learn about
taking this value and storing it as an image on the drive rather than
in the db.

I found an article about this on the net, but what confuses me is that
when i retrieve the medium_photo column from the database it is
returning an array, shouldnt plain binary data just be that, not an
array?

Is something happening in between communications or from MSSQL BLOB do
i need to do something to get the straight binary data?

(This seems to be related to sessions, not specifically to PEAR::Auth.)

As a guess, it sounds like you were only observing the first page, at
which time PHP cannot determine whether the user has enabled cookies. It
will rewrite all URLs to append the session identifier, and it will also
set a cookie. On the next page, it can determine whether cookies are
enabled (in which case it will no longer rewrite URLs) or disabled (in
which case it's a good thing the session identifier was also propagated in
the URL).

If you use session.use_only_cookies, you're basically saying that it's
fine for a user who does not enable cookies to lose session, so PHP won't
bother with rewriting URLs, even on the first page.

This rewriting behavior depends upon session.use_trans_sid, which seems to
enabled.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP.ini setup, config, installation & recognition?
Message-ID: <41F2030C.4010806@jaymax.com>

Hello,

I am setting up a program that requires allow_call_time_pass_reference to be enabled. I've set allow_call_time_pass_reference = ON in the /usr/local/etc/php.ini file

grep -n allow_call_time_pass_reference /usr/local/etc/php.ini
70: - allow_call_time_pass_reference = 1     [Code cleanliness]
167:allow_call_time_pass_reference = 1 

But the program still calls for the option to be enabled. So I have run a test file with the ini_get function, the code below.
------code-------
 <html>
     <head>
      <title>Test Page</title>
     </head>
     <body bgcolor=#FFFFFF text=#000000>
    <?php echo ini_get('allow_call_time_pass_reference'); ?>
    </body>
    </html>
----end code-----

Output page ==>  blank

/usr/local/etc/php.ini has permissions set to 444 and listed in phpinfo.php

Suggestions?

Thanks!

try  <?php print php_sapi_name(); ?> 

(there's no .htaccess file and your script 
 has a .php or php4 extension -- right?)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Migration to XAMPP
Message-ID: <20050123194519.78A41A85FE@virtu.nyphp.org>

I currently have PHP/MySQL installed on the following platforms:

 

 ~ Windows XP Pro/IIS 5.1/PHP 5.03/MySQL 4.1.4-gamma

 

 ~ SuSE Linix 9.0/Apache 2.0/PHP 4.3.3/MySQL 4.0.15

 

 I would like to install XAMPP on both the Windows and Linux platforms 

 with these differences:

 

 ~ The Linux installation could be replaced if necessary.

 

 ~ I need to maintain the existing Windows installation, but create an 

 additional Apache/PHP/MySQL stack.

 

What software do I need to de-install before doing an XAMPP 

installation on both platforms?  Are there special considerations 

because I would be installing XAMPP on the Windows system in parallel with
the existing Windows/IIS/AMP stack?

 

Thank you for your help.

Maybe I am missing the question here but wouldn't the simplest solution 
be "session-set-save-handler".

Use this function and insert it as a include into each of your pages 
before the session is started.  This will allow you to manage your 
sessions.  Therefore you can create the functions that will open and 
close a session.  On close you can easily write the time to the db.

See : http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php

0K used is good :-)  That means someone spent enough $$ on RAM that
you're not swapping to slow disks.

Mmm.. probably not, IMO.  Seg faults are from memory pointers going
beyond the bounds of the application's allocated memory space.  This is
usually due to buggy pointer arithmetic code, not the inability to
allocate memory.  In my experience, if memory isn't available, you get
an "out of memory" or "unable to allocate memory" error or something
along those lines, not a segfault.

Well, this tells us that you have something like 384MB of RAM, a little
bit is free and 275MB of it is allocated for buffers.  Oh, and no swap
used ;-). This is quite a typical snapshot profile of a healthy system
with a lot of RAM free.  The kernel typically sucks up all it can for
its buffers/cache.  This is made a bit more clear by the output of the
"vmstat" command.  The RAM allocated there will be given to newly
spawned processes or processes requesting more RAM on-the-fly.  No need
to worry I believe - you see to have plenty free.

I'd say your problem lies elsewhere.  Does it happen consistently in a
particular script?  Are you able to track it down to a particular line
or function?  Is this code using a non-standard PHP extension? Are you
using a hand-built PHP binary, pre-packaged RPM/deb/etc binary?

Hope that helps...
Andrew

Any one have links to live Mambo Stores.  Have used OSC but it is a 
pain to modify page layout.  Thinking of using Mambo but would like to 
see some working examples.  If page layout is a little easier to manage 
I would consider it.  OSC is the devil I know at the moments so at 
least I know what I'm in for.

First, I'm sure you already appreciate that XAMPP is not "production 
quality" security-wise.  It sounds like you may be using it for 
development from the above platform description, I'm guessing.


Are there special considerations

For Windows:
The nice thing about "installing" XAMPP, is that it's not really 
installed.  On windows, no registry entries are made and Apache and 
MySQL are only installed as services if you invoke the "installservice" 
bat files for each.  If you just use the "start..." bat files, Apache 
and MySQL are stopped when you close the corresponding DOS cmd windows, 
which must be left open while running XAMPP under these circumstances.

So, what that means is that you need to make sure you stop IIS and your 
MySQL 4.1.4-gamma when wanting to run the Apache and MySQL in XAMPP -- 
and vice versa.

If you want to save yourself some work, as well as having the latest 
MySQL, you might consider installing the normal windows MySQL 4.1.9 
(like the 4.1.4-gamma), and just not start the MySQL (4.1.8) packaged 
with XAMPP 1.4.11.  That way, MySQL will serve for both IIS/PHP and 
Apache/PHP and you won't have to start/stop that service.


For Linux:
XAMPP is installed in /opt/lampp.  So, as on windows, you have a 
completely separate AMP stack under XAMPP.  Once again, you just need to 
stop the "normal" Apache and MySQL daemons and start the XAMPP Apache 
and MySQL ones.
But you did indicate that you could just replace those with XAMPP, and 
that's what I'd recommend for a development platform.

HTH,
John

I think it's a great product.  I purchased the extended support - which is
conducted via email.  This can get a little frustrating give the time
differences (e.g. ~11 hours EST), but all in all has worked out ok.

Nope.  First we had a power supply fail, taking the hard drive with
it. Then the replacement power supply failed, again taking the power
supply with it. Now we are in the throes of getting FreeBSD to act
like all other server operating systems (which means allow more than
28 people to connect to the database at once).

As a beta tester you get a pretty good amount off the price (20%?).  they
just started a round of testing for ZDE 4, so you might be able to get in on
it.

I've had very good experience with their support, at least in the one
instance I truly needed it.  There were some shared servers the ftp of ZDE
wouldn't log into correctly.  It wouldn't show linked directories properly.
I gave the tech a login to recreate the error and within a couple days I had
a new build of ZDE 3 which fixed the problem.

Message-ID: <b76252690501260928664a283f@mail.gmail.com>

To solve a casual bet I made with HansK after John Andrews' excellent
SEO presentation last night...

It turns out that there IS an HTTP Status Code for redirection after
form processing. (Sir Tim thinks of everything, he's so dreamy...)

"303 See Other ... This method exists primarily to allow the output of
a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected
resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the originally
requested resource. The 303 response MUST NOT be cached..."
 -- http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.4

Bear in mind that browsers which only speak HTTP 1.0 won't know what
to do with it, but there it is.

<?php
  // process form
  ...
  // redirect to results page
  header( 'HTTP/1.1 303 See Other' );
  header( 'Location: result.html' );
  exit( 'Form submitted, <a href="result.html">continue</a>.' );
?>

Clicking refresh resubmits the get request for result.html, not the
original post request. (Same behavior as redirection with the default
302 status.) Anecdotal testing proves that it works in IE and Firefox.

Good point.  But some feedback here.  The optimail syntax is:

<?php
   // process form
   // ...
   // redirect to results page
   header('Status: 303 See Other' );
   header('Location: http://full_uri/result.html');
?>

Here's why...

Using "Status:" in the header is better because the resulting headers from 
Apache are more correct:
    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
instead of
    HTTP/1.1 303

Additionally, one doesn't really know which version of HTTP is being used, 
so why potentially cause problems by trying to guess.

The specs say location headers must have a complete URI in them, not just 
the path.

Lastly, you don't want any output after the location header.

Later,

Actually I do -- it's not harmful to have an entity attached to the
redirect response, and it covers the case of non-HTTP/1.1 browsers.

But good points on all other counts -- using header( 'Status: XXX' )
instead of header( 'HTTP/1.x XXX' ) is a great idea.

You might want to make sure that your environment properly supports the
whole 300 series of messages. A few years back on a ColdFusion/IIS4 project
where we found that not all redirect messages are treated equally (or per
the letter of the RFC), sometimes at the server, sometimes at the browser.
Just FYI.

Since you are running the script via cron, you should have a look at 
/var/log/messages to see what might have caused the problem around that 
time. Cron usually logs its actions to the messages file.

You can also put your error log in a file and then later inspect it. 
i.e. in your cron file, the command should be

YOUR_FTP_SCRIPT 2&> ERR_LOG_FILE

My opinion is that Dan and Chris are both brilliant and diligent.

I have no experience with the 303, but I can inquire of Google and 
Yahoo! and ask around.

If it works practically, it might be an answer to the flash detection 
issue (?). Since any redirect has potential for abuse, however if there 
was a way to do it without any redirection, of course that is best.

Well, just got some help from the PostgreSQL guys for the FreeBSD
issues, and think MamboForge.net is finally fixed.

If any of you experience problems, please email me so I am aware -
that way it is easier for me to diagnose the problems.

Thanks for your patience,

I know this is OT, but I also know that there are lots of smart people

I have a Linksys wireless-B router that works perfectly except that I can't 
even ping 67.15.70.19.  If I bypass the router and go directly to the cable 
box, no problem; if I (ahem) borrow my neighbor's wireless-G, again no 
problem.  DNS information is correct.  Both Linksys and Optonline are 
baffled.  I would appreciate it if others with a moment of spare time, 
curiosity about this odd problem, and the same router, Linksys wireless-B, 
specifically BEFW11S4 (which by the way has the latest firmware), could try 
pinging and report to me OFFLIST what happens.  If you can connect, you 
might try http://www.carolynbross.com which is what I'm trying to work 
on.  If anyone else with different equipment has any anomalous result (I am 
expecting everybody else to have no problem), I'd appreciate hearing about 
that also.

Thanks in advance, and once again I apologize for this OT message.

That's a good deal and the ZDE is really awesome.

I'll send Hans a formal promotion code for New York PHP within a
couple of days. There'll be a 25% discount for the ZDE and some other
goodies.

Just as an aside, some small routers won't connect to their own WAN address. So if you are 67.15.70.19 that might be the issue.

That's a good deal and the ZDE is really awesome.

I'll send Hans a formal promotion code for New York PHP within a
couple of days. There'll be a 25% discount for the ZDE and some other
goodies.

You are right, cvsweb is broken (as are the gforge forums) and the
manual is referenced through cvsweb.

This site (mamboforge.net) is being replaced, and hopefully the new
site will be online within the next week or so. There is also a new
help site in the works that is almost finished, that will be the new
home for documentation and tutorials on Mambo.

Sorry for the downtime, we had repeated hardware failures right as we
were gearing up for the switch :-(

It appears from my read of past history that the 303 is treated like a 
temporary redirect (e.g. untrusted, like a 302 or meta refresh)
This may be a case where using the 301 is "best" even though it may be 
technically incorrect (?)

Since the purpose of 303 is to redirect after form submission, a
crawler should never encounter it.

Then again, how long will it be before gcrawler is registering for
sites and submitting searches of its own? ;-)

I've used iSearch in situations like that.  The indexer can be a bit
sluggish and resource intensive.  Otherwise, its simple, has nice basic
features and is easily customized - both presentation and logic. It
definitely does the trick for small sites.

As far as I know crawlers skip forms completely. Do they even "know" 
they are there?

Not quite.  The source won't compile because it can't find libstdc++/c++
compiler even though it's installed (presumably in a place that the
source can't find it).  

So I installed from the RPM which is a beta version of htdig.  That
aborts due to a NULL bug.  So I find the patch, grab the source RPM and
go about rebuilding the RPM.  Turns out I don't have various include
files, IOW I need an htdig-devel RPM which AKAICT doesn't exist for any
distro other than Mandrake.

At that point, I gave up.

I'm currently trying PHPDig but I'm stuck trying to find out where to
set the admin name/passwd in includes/config.php.

In case it hasn't been mentioned:

mysql on windows targeted by worm:

http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?date=2005-01-27&isc=811c8d08470e11fdb8efdabfe5bee079


quoted:

A "bot", exploiting vulnerable MySQL installs on Windows systems, has 
been spotted. It infected a few thousand systems so far. Like typical 
for bots, infected systems will connect to an IRC server. The IRC server 
will instruct them to scan various /8 networks for other vulnerable 
mysql servers.

*Infection Method*

The bot uses the "MySQL UDF Dynamic Library Exploit". In order to launch 
the exploit, the bot first has to authenticate to mysql as 'root' user. 
A long list of passwords is included with the bot, and the bot will 
brute force the password.

Once connected, the bot will create a table called 'bla' using the 
database 'mysql'. The 'mysql' database is typically used to store 
administrative information like passwords, and is part of every mysql 
install. The only field in this database is a BLOB named 'line'.

Once the table is created, the executable is written into the table 
using an insert statement. Then, the content of is written to a file 
called 'app_result.dll' using 'select * from bla into dumpfile 
"app_result.dll"'. The 'bla' table is dropped once the file is created.

In order to execute the 'app_result.dll', the bot creates a mysql 
function called 'app_result' which uses the 'app_result.dll' file saved 
earlier. This function is executed, and as a result the bot is loaded 
and run.

*Post Infection Behavior*

The bot will now try to connect to one out of a number of IRC servers:
dummylandingzone.hn.org -> 212.105.105.214

this have been disabled by respective dynamic dns providers(thanks!!):
landingzone.ath.cx -> 212.105.105.214
dummylandingzone.dyndns.org -> no such name
landingzone.dynamic-ip.us -> was: 212.105.105.214
dummylandingzone.dns2go.com -> 63.64.164.91 and 63.149.6.91
dummylandingzone.hn.org -> 212.105.105.214
dummylandingzone.dynu.com -> 212.105.105.214
zmoker.dns2go.com -> 63.64.164.91
landingzone.dynu.com -> was: 212.105.105.214
dummylandingzone.ipupdater.com -> 212.105.105.214

The bot will connect to the IRC server on port 5002 or 5003. At this 
point, the IRC servers appear busy and unable to accept new connections. 
Note that dynamic DNS services are used. The IP addresses will likely 
change. Last time we where able to connect, about 8,500 hosts where 
connected to the IRC server.

The bot will connect to a channel called '#rampenstampen' using the key 
'gratisporn'. The topic of the channel is set to '!adv.start mysql 80 10 
0 132.x.x.x -a -r -s'. This will instruct the bot to scan random ips in 
'132.0.0.0/8' for mysql server. Throughout our observation, the topic 
was changed regularly. To be scanned networks included 10.0.0.0/8, 
likely an attempt to infect other mysql servers within a local network 
that is otherwise protected by a firewall.

So far, the bot has been identified as a version of 'Wootbot'. It 
appears to include the usual set of bot features like a DDOS engine, 
various scanners, commands to solicit information from infected systems 
(e.g. system stats, software registration keys and such). The bot 
provides an FTP server, and a backdoors (details later. Appears to be 
listening on port 2301/tcp and 2304/tcp, maybe other ports).

In case you're using Apachefriends XAMPP on Windows, you can turn off
the MySQL daemon's network listener by editing
C:\apachefriends\xampp\mysql\bin\my.cnf

Under [mysqld] add a "skip-networking" directive:

  # The MySQL server
  [mysqld]
  skip-networking
  socket          = mysql
  ...

Local programs can still connect to the DB via localhost socket, but
internet worms are locked out.

Any reason why it wouldn't work on Windows/MySQL installations other than
XAMPP?

Different path to my.cnf, that's all.

BTW, on my workstation, the .cnf of my.cnf is hidden despite the fact
that I ask windows explorer to show extensions. :-/

I'm currently using PHPDig which seems fine.  I'm having two
problems with it though; if I can't get those resolved, I'll try
iSearch.  Thanks.

I give mnoGoSearch a thumbs up.  Its pretty customizable / configurable,
the PHP API is decent to use and its all fast, partly due to it being in
C and partly due to the DB structure.  And yes, it scales pretty well.
However, if you're looking to use the PHP API, you'll need to compile
the PHP extension and get that installed by your sysadmin.  Then you're
left with the stock search.cgi and/or the C API to write your own
version of search.c(gi).  Not a search solution I'd recommend for small
sites, unless your host has support for it in their PHP build *or*
you're comfortable with writing/hacking C.  Other solutions can be just
as effective for a small sites reqs.

HTH,
Andrew

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MAMP setup tips wanted
Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.58.0501301409150.45876@emra.pair.com>


Hi everybody.

I am soon to start teaching an introductory PHP class. Week 1 assignment
is get yourself up and running PHP 5.0.x w/ mysqli, MySQL 4.1.x and Apache
1.3.33 or 2.0.5x on your own development machine. I can talk about
installation and configuration from (modest) experience on Windows and
Linux, both with XAMPP and building from source, but not OS X because I
got no OS X machine to play with.

Generally speaking, can you try XAMPP for Linux on Mac OS X and get lucky?
Or, suppose you use a package like MAMP (http://www.mamp.info/en/home/).
It looks wonderful but I would like MySQL 4.1.x and mysqli, which it
lacks -- how painful do you think it would be to upgrade its MySQL to
4.1.9, and possibly, if necessary, also update its PHP to include mysqli?

Stated differently:  is there a painless way for novices to get AMP going
on their Mac __with the latest production-quality__ versions of
everything? Last time I had students whose Macs already had AMP dating
from their OS installation time -- and in some cases that was pretty old.

Thanks and sorry for the verbosity,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL primary sort oddity
Message-ID: <29da5d1505013011524b5d473e@mail.gmail.com>

I have a users table on my website that primary field 'id', which is
auto_incremental.  This usually never happens, and really doesn't
affect anything in anyway, but it's bugging me to why it's happening. 
When I'm looking at it through phpMyAdmin, with the query "SELECT *
FROM users" the output is:

1 - 13
then 15
14
16 and on

I'm not an expert on MySQL to any degree, but I though if no ORDER was
input, it auto sorted by the primary key (if none provided, I figured
index was then taken, then just the order it was input).

If I left out any relevant information to the matter let me know and
I'll post it.

If no ORDER BY is used, then there is no sorting, primary key or not.  I don't know of any database that's any different.  It'll be in the order in which the data lies in the file, which should always be assumed as random.

Right, so how is it that an auto_increment wouldn't sort by the id
number?  Because if it's being sorted by the order it got entered,
then it should still be in order.  At least that clears up a few
things for me.

On a side note, anyway to have phpMyAdmin default sort by primary key?

auto_increment isn't dependant on sorting.  It's an internal counter that is maintained in the table structure.  The order by which records appear when a SELECT is run without an ORDER BY is the order in which they lay in the on-disk datafile.  An auto_increment column, on the other hand, is just a counter.

Not that I know of, but you should always specify an ORDER BY when you want something sorted anyway, and not depend on some automatic behavior.

As a follow-up: If it is a MyISAM file, why don't you dump 
the contents of the .MYD file and look at it -- that way 
you could see for yourself.

Hey folks,

Wondering if anyone has come across a tutorial on how to convert your 
HTML into a Mambo Template or Theme (not sure of the terminology). I've 
seen a bunch of similar things, but not exactly that. I'm starting with 
a PSD file, so I would hope to see something that described how it 
should be sliced up and where images/html should be placed.

Any thoughts or info as to what to read up on or where to go would be 
greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Tom

Actually there are a bunch of "from Photoshop" or "from Dreamweaver" 
template tutorials for Mambo - most of them are listed on this Mambo forum 
thread:

http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=26144


Also I've found the Mambo Developer's Manual fills in a lot of missing 
pieces too.

One good tutorial can be found here, including instructions on
installing the Mambo Template plugin for Dreamweaver:

http://www.mambosolutions.com/dw_tutorial/

I just wrote one for International PHP Magazine, but not sure if it
made the next issue or not. I will be presenting this for the February
NYPHP session however ;-)

I cannot vouch for them since I have not really worked with their 
installs but they make it very easy and Mac friendly.  
www.serverlogistics.com it appears fairly painless.

I'm new to pear and its package manager.  Have successful installed pear on
my windoz box and am trying to use install from the command line.
Everything appears to work OK, however, the particular package that I'm
trying to install is listed as beta.  The pear install command appears to
only support those packages listed as stable.  Anyone know of a work-around?
Is there a switch I can set that will install beta packages?

You need to set your prefered package state. You can see your current 
settings by typing:
$ pear config-show

And then you can set up pear to allow you to install beta packages by 
typing:
$ pear config-set preferred_state beta

There were quite a few issues with building from source under OS X 
early on, but Apple has really come up to speed with the open source 
compilers that now come with OS X. So, the rules are fairly close to 
those of BSD.

But, for a nice easy install that won't require a command line, Marc 
Liyanage maintains a Mac install of both PHP and MySQL at entropy.ch. 
He includes detailed instructions for multiple versions. He's done a 
really fine job and has been staying on top of things for a couple of 
years now.

pear install PackageName-beta

This is nice because it's a temporary change, unlike the preferred state 
option in another message.

Thanks Dan.  One more quick question.  When I run pear config-get php_dir I
get the following:

c:\php10\pear

and therefore all pear packages are loaded there via the package manager.
I've got a feeling though, that I should be installing these in my web
directory not my PHP directory - cause I'm getting errors when I try to
reference these pear packages via an include or require statement.  Is my
pear configuration correct or should I point it to another spot?

Thanks (again) in advance,

Mark

You shouldn't treat PEAR files any differently from other files that you 
would include in your script. Putting them in your web directory can be 
dangerous. I think there was a Phundamentals article about this.

You should just make sure that your include path is set properly and you 
shouldn't have any problems.

Thanks Scott.

Guess I'm stumped with setting my include path.  In my php.ini I specify the
following:

include_path=.;c:/php10/PEAR

in my test script I use:

require_once 'Spreadsheet\Excel\Writer.php';

However, when I run the script I get the following:

Warning: main(Spreadsheet\Excel\Writer.php): failed to open stream: No such
file or directory in c:\program files\apache
group\apache\htdocs\main_branch\program_files\excel.php on line 2

Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required 'Spreadsheet\Excel\Writer.php'
(include_path='.') in c:\program files\apache
group\apache\htdocs\main_branch\program_files\excel.php on line 2

I have verified that the Writer.php file is in the director and that the
path I specify is correct. Thanks for any light you might shed.

Mark

It looks like you are setting the include path wrong. Take a look at 
this page in the manual:
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ini.sect.path-directory.php#ini.include-path

You need to use back slashes instead of forward slashes when working on 
windows.

It's worth pointing out that OSX already has native Apache and PHP
installations. So whatever you do needs to account for that...

Thanks to everyone.

Seems that entropy.ch is the best bet. One more thing and then I'll shut
up (temporarily). Does anyone know whether the current the Entropy PHP
package is built against the MySQL 4.0.x libraries, the 4.1.x, or both?

Bottom line is, I want to coerce my PHP students into running MySQL 4.1.x
and mysqli, and if it's unreasonably difficult for a novice to do that on
OS X, I will have to reconsider.

Yes indeed -- in some cases, Apache/PHP that is older than dirt. Well, ok,

There are two other ways of getting the latest versions on OS X:

1. Install the Fink package system (this is bascially apt-get for OS X):
    http://fink.sourceforge.net

2.  Or if you prefer the Gentoo approach, you can get Portage for OS X 
now too:

No, you aren't exaggerating -- I think the default for 10.3 was PHP 4.3.6
The latest update from Apple ( 2005-001 ) finally bumped PHP to 4.3.10.

Apache has been kept up to date, tho.

I like David Sklar's Essential PHP Tools.  I use it fairly regularly.  I 
am also working my way through PHP 5 Power Programming by Andi Gutmans, 
Stig Bakken and Derick Rethans.  PHP 5 Power Programming is a good 
book.  The first part deals with the differences between PHP 4 and 5.  
Then launches into some good information about OOP and Patterns and 
follows with information about PEAR and other extensions.

Good luck!

Thanks Hans.  Got David's book.  It is good.  Trying to use a package that's
not in there, Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer.  Anyone familiar with it?  I've Got
everything up-and-flying, however, can't seem to output anythign Excel like.
Spews the output directly to the screen of my browser rather than firing up
Excel.  Maybe I need to adjust something local.

Thanks,

Mark

That site is going to get replaced with a new portal, just for support
and documentation.  FYI we will be merging all of our websites into
one portal family so everyone will have easy access to news, support,
docs, and what is currently known as MamboForge.

First we need to get 4.5.2 out, then prepare for Boston next month,
and then will start rolling out the new sites. It will be a major
upgrade, promise!  :-)

Mark,

Sounds like your not setting the mime type correctly.

Try one of these:
application/vnd.ms-excel   <--  I think this one is for xls files.  I 
think this if the one you should use.
application/x-msexcel
application/ms-excel

header ("Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel");

I think this is how you set mime-type correctly.

It's better than RedHat Enterprise 3 which uses 4.2 (might be 4.3.1)  
Anyway, I need to re-compile every time I install a RH ES box.

Thanks,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL primary sort oddity

I had this happen to me but not sure why.  I think I might have changed 
the ID on a record or something like that.  The easiest way to fix this 
is in phpMyAdmin goto the Operations tab, there is a drop down with the 
text "Alter table order by:" and select the ID field.  Note: that if 
you do this for another type of field (i.e. Username) it will not keep 
a sorting it for you with each entry.  It's a one-time disk sort.
