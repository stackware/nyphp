<PRE>I've been on a cruise ship sailing the southern Caribbean for the past 
week and half. Prior to leaving, I configured the home network to allow 
ssh into the the servers and VNC to my desktop machine (never know when 
you need emergency access to your desktop!). Wi-Fi and internet cafe 
rates on the ship are expensive at 50 cents/min. Upon boarding, I signed 
on for the $100 &quot;unlimited internet from the cabin&quot; package which 
basically offers a ship compatible telephone with an analog port. 
Connectivity is via dial-up and the max speed is 46.6 kbps. Latency over 
the satellite link, surprisingly, isn't that bad. SSH works fine and 
TightVNC with high compression is usable, despite the low bandwidth. I'm 
able to effectively keep watch and tune my all clients servers remotely 
over ssh or their vpn. Skype ports are blocked on the local network, but 
Net2phone works so I can do voip phone calls for &quot;free&quot; avoiding the 
$7.99/min ship rate. The internet was particularly useful for the rental 
car situation prior to arriving at Curacao. I woke up, browsed the web 
for that to do on the island, then google'd for rental car discount 
codes and reserved the car online 2 hrs prior to arrival. Ended up 
saving about $50 (and the hassles of possibly not having a car). $100 
for 9 days of internet is kind of steep, but it's written off as a 
business expense and the alternative would have probably been much 
worse. I should write up a howto faq on being an IT ocean warrior. And 
now I have figure out how to lose the 10 lbs gained from eating all that 
buffet food!
