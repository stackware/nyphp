</I>    It depends on the context,  but file uploads can take a ~long~ time.

    I used to work on a site that took document uploads from an 
international audience.  One day other people on the team noticed that 
we had http connections running for an hour or longer,  and they thought 
that there was something wrong with our system.

    I did some investigation,  and discovered that people were uploading 
multi-megabyte files over dialup connections from places like India.  It 
turned out the long connections were because of slow uploads,  not 
because of anything wrong with our system.

    This is an extreme case,  but it's not unusual for file uploads to 
take 30 seconds or more -- it's pretty frustrating to have to wait 30 
seconds to know that you did something wrong.

    I'm not a fan of client-side validation in Javascript,  since it 
often is done in a slapdash way,  but it helps a lot with forms that 
involve big uploads.
