I like the Java LDAP Browser (when you google that string it's at the top -- the url has &quot;~gawor&quot; in it).  Others are fond of GQ 
(i don't think it works from a windows workstation -- i use linux on my desktop).   I think that with the variety of LDAP setups 
out there, it really depends on what you want to do (as to which tool will fill your specific need).  There are lots more choices 
than the 2 I've mentioned; just install them and try them out.

Once one learns enough about LDAP, there's a temptation to create your own php frontend for adminstration (that was one of those 
projects that I never managed to finish however).

I'm pretty familiar with the basics of setting up LDAP servers and if questions are posted to the list, I'm happy to chime in and 
try to help if people are getting stuck with that part (as long as the list moderators don't consider this too far off topic). 
For those that really want to learn ldap in depth I'd recommend subscribing to the <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">openldap-software at openldap.org</A> list and/or 
hanging out in the #ldap channel on irc.freenode.net
