<PRE>I was always happy with Pair Networks uptime.  I think maybe there was a 
couple minutes of downtime that I noticed once in the 5 years I've had a 
shared hosting account with them.  Here's their statement: &quot;Our network 
is monitored and maintained 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Our 
server and network uptime is well in excess of 99.9%. Your data is 
backed up daily to ensure full recovery in the event of a disaster. Our 
entire facility is protected by multi-stage security, FM-200 fire 
suppression systems, Powerware battery backup systems, and a 750,000 
watt diesel generator that can run indefinitely. Your data is always 
safe with pair Networks.&quot;

However, I recently switched to Empowering Media because I liked the 
10for10 developer hosting account that they offer.  Fits what I 
personally need more than the Pair accounts.  They claim 99.5% uptime 
for their shared accounts.  I haven't been on the shared account long 
enough to say from experience... but I know that they're good people 
over there from having worked with them on other managed servers for my 
company.  The only way to ensure absolute 100% uptime would be to spring 
for some kind of managed hosting where you have servers in multiple data 
centers.  Empowering Media can do this and I'm sure there are many other 
hosting providers that do the same thing... but I'm pretty sure that 
would cost a lot more than you're looking to spend.
