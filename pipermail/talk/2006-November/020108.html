This may be where the &quot;higher-ups&quot; thought that LDAP lends value (in controlling access in a granular fashion).  It's not an easy 
problem to solve, but the infrastructure is available in LDAP.  I know there's basic authentication available in MySQL (I'm more 
of a postgresql person myself), but I think that complex access requirements will probably be easier to implement in LDAP.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried, unsuccessfully, to convince the client to ditch LDAP as the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, at least someone else thinks this is probably not the best
</I>&gt;<i> approach. If it comes up again, I can always say that I got some other
</I>&gt;<i> opinions:)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm not a big fan of the syntax either (though I've been doing it long enough now, that I no longer notice how rough around the 
edges it is).   One thing that I would point out is that it's not a &quot;pure speed&quot; thing (accessing a local flat file to perform a 
lookup will almost always be faster than querying a network resource, no matter how much you've optimised the latter).  The 
benefit of LDAP isn't that it's faster than everything else.  The benefit is that it gives you a robust extensible structure 
that's relatively well-documented, and there are lots of tools and code snippets out there which can be leveraged.

	good luck,
