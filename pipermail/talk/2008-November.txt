Subject: [nycphp-talk] require_once paranoia?
Message-ID: <78c6bd860811010912x32cf3979o1de43e5bd2cbb9fe@mail.gmail.com>

I've seen numerous references that calling require_once is slow. Zend
Framework is very strict about not calling require_once unless
absolutely necessary (e.g. for exceptions).

In item 3 in this blog post:

  http://till.vox.com/library/post/zendframework-performance.html

the author claims switching to __autoload chopped 220 ms off request times.

Why is this so? If you do not call require_once until you actually
need the class, I fail to see why __autoload would make any difference
as you still need to read the file from disk and interpret it either
way.

Depends on how efficiently you lay out your application's files.  You're 
right if you do a good job and/or the application is small.

But when you have a large application that has multiple files that 
require the same files, PHP will need to to determine the full path to 
each file over and over and over.

This is where autoload is helpful, because if your class/file has already 
been loaded, PHP doesn't need to check for it again.

I notice you have that the order of these is important.  I believe I've run
into these types of chars, and had great fun trying to remove them.  If you
remove only one byte, the subsequent bytes apparently change.  I'm assuming
these are the same types of chars - do you have any references with
technical description and more info about these multi-bytes?

This might be helpful, particularly the comments:

http://shiflett.org/blog/2005/oct/convert-smart-quotes-with-php

I have had the whole RSS problem explained to me before by an  
accessibility guru, and as I recall, it has something to do with  
namespaces. The solution is to use numerical entities rather than  
named entities, because stuff like &hearts will make your feed  
invalid. This sounds like what you're encountering.

(I need to update my post with this information, so I don't forget it  
again.)

Hope that helps.

Funny, I just got done commenting on this review of its more expensive cousin:
http://www.dotvoid.com/2008/10/two-weeks-with-zend-studio-for-eclipse/

Every time I start to use Eclipse I'm struck with the thought that you
couldn't make a more user-hostile environment if you tried. But of
course, it's all just what you're used to. If you can use emacs and
like it, you can use anything.

Zend Studio 5.5 (non-free) remains my favorite, but I was impressed
with the stuff Kevin Hoyt was demoing in Eclipse last night.

Does anyone know a sirte that makes Eclipse PDT MSIs, RPMs, DEBs,
.APPs (for OSX)? I like eclipse, and I hate the whole "just download a
zip file and set it up yourself" feel about it.

Visual Studio 2005 is just as configurable and extendable (albeit
probably with less of a community and with redistribution issues) as
Eclipse. However, it still has an installer and a bunch of sensible
default settings that don't detract from that customizability.

I'd be interested. I'm pretty new to eclipse and some step by step
howtos might help me learn a few things about it I have not already
used.

Vim.

No doubt a lot of people will think I'm kidding but seriously, nothing
is faster than Vim once you get used to the mnemonics because it
doesn't use the mouse pointer. I run 12 xterms w/ Vim on 6 different
desktops.

Note that even though Vim users are in the minority these days, a lot
of serious programmers use it. As a matter of fact, if you're going to
mention Zend Studio, I can tell you that a number of Zend people use
Vim.

My only gripe with Vim is that the maintainers have a tendency to
"improve" it once in a while which means you have to spend a lot of
time disabling things. For example, vim's syntax highlighting is so
obnoxious I would not be surprised if it caused epileptic seizures in
otherwise normal individuals. I just turn it off because I don't want
my code to look like ransom note. Also, for some reason vim can try to
be helpful and insert text for you like indentation space and comment
fragments. My config consists almost entirely of commands to disable
"features".

If you're in the market for an IDE, you should evaluate NetBeans for PHP,
here's the quick pitch:
- open source (free)
- tiny download (30mb)
- PHP editor with integrated support for HTML/CSS/JavaScript (code
completion, hints, templates, etc...)
- Database Explorer/SQL Editor (with a focus on MySQL)
- Debugging via Xdebug
- JavaScript debugging for Firefox and IE(Win)
- Version Control support

Oh, and it's fast.

Also, check out the comments from folks that have tried it at ZendCon and
IPC:

And, a nice quick intro to some of the NetBeans features:

I downloaded NetBeans/PHP on a netbook and I have to agree with the
fast part. Very impressive.

I would probably consider switching except that it doesn't seem to be
particularly code-intelligent yet. Not surprising given how new it is,
but it doesn't immediately catalog the php objects and functions it
finds in your files the way that Zend Studio does.

Perhaps I'm missing a way to tell the ide about classes and function
libraries you (re)use in your code? This may all be documented
somewhere, I just tried it for the first time last night...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] dynamic drop down menu issues
Message-ID: <BLU107-DAV9E1F38067766E9EAC764BA8190@phx.gbl>

I am trying to build a real estate page where users could select a location
and then all listings associated with that listing will be displayed.  For
some reason the drop down menu is working.  

Any help will be appreciated and please find the code below;

 

<?php # Script

 

$page_title = 'View Locations';

include ('./includes/header.html');

require_once ('./connections/mysql/mysql_connect.php'); // Connect to the
database.

 

// Create a form allowing the user to select a URL category to view.

echo '<div align="center">

<form method="get" action="browse_byloc4.php">

<select name="type">

<option value="NULL">Choose a Location:</option>

';

 

// Retrieve and display the available categories.

$query = 'SELECT DISTINCT location AS location FROM apartments ORDER BY
location ASC';

$result = mysql_query ($query);

while ($row = mysql_fetch_array ($result, MYSQLI_ASSOC)) {

echo "<option value=\"$row[0]\">$row[1]</option>

";

}

 

// Complete the form.

echo '</select>

<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Go!">

</form>

</div>

';

 

// Retrieve the URLs for a particular category, if selected.

// Make sure the type is an integer.

if (isset($_GET['type'])) {

            $type = (int) $_GET['type'];

} else {

            $type = 0;

}

 

if ($type > 0) {

 

            // Get the current type name.

            $query = "SELECT * FROM apartments WHERE location=$type";

            $result = mysql_query ($query);

            list ($location) = mysql_fetch_array ($result, MYSQL_NUM);


            

            $tmp_num_cols = $_GET['num_cols'];

            

echo '<table border="0" width="90%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
align="center"><tr><td height="300"><table width="100%" height="100%"
border="0"><tr>';

 

// START OUR GRID CODE

$num_columns = 3; // SET THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS TO DISPLAY TO 3

$column_counter = 1; // COUNTS OUR CURRENT COLUMN

 

// Display all the prints, linked to URLs.

$result = mysqli_query ($dbc, $query); // GET ALL THE apartmentS FROM THE DB

while ($apartment = mysqli_fetch_array ($result, MYSQL_ASSOC)) { // Display
each record.

echo '<td height="100%"><table width="150" height="60%" border="3"
cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="right">';

 

if ($image = getimagesize ("../uploads/{$apartment['image_name']}")) 

{

echo "<img width=190 height=110

alt=\"{$apartment['apartment_name']}\"/><br>";

}

 

echo "<a

artment_name']}&aPrice={$apartment['price']}\">{$apartment['apartment_name']
}</a><br>\${$apartment['price']}</td></tr>";

echo '</table></td>';

if ($column_counter == $num_columns) { // IF WE'VE REACHED THE END OF OUR
ROW

echo '</tr></table></td></tr>

<tr><td><hr></td></tr>

<tr><td height="300"><table width="100%" height="100%" border="0"><tr>';

$column_counter = 0;

}

$column_counter++;

} 

}

// End of while loop.

echo '</tr></table></td></tr></table>'; // Close the table.

 

include ('./includes/footer.html');

?>

If the menu is working, then what do you want us to do -- make it NOT work?

However, if the menu is not working, then maybe you should look to 
another way of doing this. After all, if your menu is supposed to 
react with the user, then using a client-side language might be 
better.

I recommend going this route:

Message-ID: <a304e2d60811130803r387de5f9g60e599278be4fb53@mail.gmail.com>

Hi people,

This is not an PHP question.  It is a question about auto load sound on an
html page.

I am using the following inside an html page but it works on IE but it does
not work
in FF.  FF in rhel5 wants me load a plugin and FF on W2K does nto do
anything:

<embed src='dontworry.mp3' autostart=true volume=90 hidden=TRUE
height=0 width=0 />
<NOEMBED><BGSOUND src="dontworry.mp3"></NOEMBED>



Any ideas?

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

I would embedded a hiden flash applet if I were you. Probably a
smaller size than.au or .voc. I never heard of voc until I looked it
up just now. If the file size is similar to MP3 go for it.

No no no, that's not complicated enough. Try using SoundManager2:
http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/

Since it uses Flash to play audio, it will work in any browser. Plus
you get javascript control over audio so you can put a big "mute"
button on the page.

Or you could wait for HTML5's <audio> tag. :-)

Actually, the boss wants the page to autoload the sound in the background.
The code I
showed in my original post does work on IE.  Since it is a one time joke for
the boss
during a presentation, I will just leave it like that and have him use IE .

Is the first time that I see where IE can do something that FF can not.

Everything I read, mentions that EMBED should work on other browsers.

Thanks for the info!!!I am not going to waste more time on this.

Nestor :-)

Well if your comfortable with flash or flex my solution isn't
"complicated". Its also an example of using flash unobtrusively. swfs
can embed mp3s or play external ones. Many sites have flash players
for sounds. You just have to find a free one that supports autoplay
and hide it.

I guess complicated is relative to the tools your proficient with.

I believe it's because your FF on linux doesn't have the mp3 extension 
tied to a plugin, but most everything seems to play .au files.

Audacity or ffmpeg come to mind.

ffmpeg is command line based. Its the A/V equivilant of netcat.
Audacity is a gui program. you might need to get a seperarte mp3
encoder for it depending on your OS and method of install

Message-ID: <77c8d3060811131705tf0afde5y9fa401e628c7eeda@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I don't know if many of you are aware of the Enterprise Security API. The *
ESAPI* is a free and open collection of all the security methods that a
developer needs to build a secure web application. You can just use the
interfaces and build your own implementation using your company's
infrastructure. Or, you can use the reference implementation as a starting
point. The Java and .Net version of the ESAPI are complete and now we are
trying to wrap up the PHP version of the ESAPI. We are looking for
volunteers who can help us wrap this up as quickly as possible so we can
make it available to the PHP community. If you are interested please check
the project page http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI and subscribe to the
maling list. We need your support!

Regards,

Kuai

What that said, let me say simply that IE uses 
<BGSOUND src=> while most other browsers use 
<EMBED src=>

So you have to browser sniff before playing. Here's an example:

Except for major browsers on Free operating systems that make a point
of not bundling proprietary codecs. One suspects that those 6 or 7
users don't care to listen, however. :-)

Whatever happened to "Fast, cheap, secure, choose any two?"

OK, sorry, I couldn't resist. Is there *succinct* documentation of the
various interfaces that make up the ESAPI?

Is there any talk of working support into the Zend framework? Are
developers of other PHP frameworks looking at this yet?

Hi Team,

I am on the search to find a package or php script which helps me to create a Instant Messenger? alert facility on my website. By using this, I want to check the status of a
User (Yahoo, GoogleTalk, MSN, Skype, AOL) and send message if the user is
online. And I wish to do all this from my php script.

Thank You.

seban,

i know there is a Yahoo! Address Book API released by Yahoo itself which
allows you to perform about 5,000 queries / day (i am not sure if this is
for each API key or not, it is a big difference)

i know that hypothetic.org (which seems not to be online right now) has
information about the MSN protocol and some links to bots / resources (this
will help if that protocol is up to date)

you can also take a look at this one: http://www.blobsy.org/Main/DOWNLOAD (i
am not sure how advanced is the development but the last time i tried it, i
could connect and add a module to it)

you should take into consideration to use cURL for this kind of
implementation but it seems like you need something more like a bot instead
of the mailing apis

best regards
fernando

There is also the posibility of using a jabber gateway, as their api's are
open but you would need a free gateway that allows you to connect, you
SHOULD find lists of gateways and what netwrks they support. So look up
jabber/XMPP if you never heard of it before. I know i used a few years ago
and i managed to get it working for icq and msn, at that time.

Hi,



Thank you for your replies.



I got a class from phpclasses.org, which uses the the Jabber/XMPP and its link is:



http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/3106.html



But I couldn't see it the result of the example page, because it need
to change the php.ini settings. Is here anyone which uses this package?
Actually, I don't get how can I use this for sending Instant Messenger
alerts.



Any suggestions would be appreciated. 



Thank You.

Bear in mind that every messaging network as its own protocol. Maybe you 
can find a PHP wrapper or interface that uses the GAIM or Pidgin 
libraries (which can talk to most of the main messaging networks).

Another approach would be to find a web-based API that you can use to talk 
to these services.

Also check out meebo.com/platform - they might have an API for instant

yeah...yeah...another noob question. Happy Sunday evening!  ;)

The variable $name and $clean['name'] contain the same text. I'm using
Chris' suggestions while cleaning up old code. In this case the variable
contains space delimited alnum with an ending space. "Test of several
ideas "

	fwrite($file, "$blah $name $blah");

works but  

	fwrite($file, "$blah $clean['name'] $blah" ) 

does not, producing:

Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE,
expecting T_STRING or T_VARIABLE or T_NUM_STRING 

Even trying to just echo "$clean['name']" fails.

Suggestions on what to read up on?

String interpolation doesn't like array dereferences.

Try:

"$blah {$clean['name']} $blah"

or some variation of:

$blan . ' ' . $clean['name'] . ' ' . $blah

Ask them for money and if they don't pay, don't let them in?

That's one way to do it...though not practical when you have an event with 100 or more people.

Recently something similar was thrown into my lap. I set up a single web 
page describing the event, a paypal product button at the bottom to make 
payment, and configured the paypal to redirect to a confirmation page 
back on my site afterwards which requested additional information from 
the attendee. This process was also backed up by Paypal IPN to deter any 
fraud (no one even attempted - non technical crowd). If the user makes a 
payment but quits before redirecting back, at least you still have their 
payment and contact info logged on Paypal.

I dunno, I've attended and even worked on events that had more than 
100 people where we collected payment at the door. Hey, many bars do 
that every weekend.

If you want pre-payment, then set up a web site with PayPal and have 
a list of people who prepaid at the door. When they ID themselves, 
then let them in -- otherwise pay.

I really don't see the problem.

Cheers,

tedd

also you can look for 'Secure Payment Gateway' for other options than Paypal
if you dont find it convincing, there are several

i know that some banks already have their provider for this so you could
talk to them first

    I implemented something very similar to support boat reservations.  
Note that Paypal/Verisign payment processing gives you a number of 
options:  the cheap-o Paypal account tries very aggressively to get 
people to sign up with Paypal rather than just letting them type in a 
credit card.  Many vendors feel that this results in (i) more abandoned 
shopping carts,  and (ii) damage to their brand,  so they use a slightly 
more expensive service that's more user friendly.

It's the "push them into using Paypal" aspect of the Paypal account that also, well, ticks me off.

I think at one time or another we've all encountered the css drop down 
rollover flicker problem with IE browser. You might want to take this 
issue onto the front-end list.

Second that, front-end is quiet but I think questions generally get answered.

If the problem is IE-specific it sometimes helps to Google for
something like "IE bug" +visibility.

Message-ID: <b5b976a60811211459k1195ffffh56fe77491b080328@mail.gmail.com>

Hi (Newbie alert)

I have a link (via a submit button) which ideally allows a user to sign-in
to a more secure level of the site. My question is, how do I tell the
browser which way to go at the end of the script?

If there are no errors, go to the next level, but if there are errors, then
stay where you are and fix them, or be content with the lower level of
access. The validation includes the usual database accesses, and so on. All
of it is working fine apart from the niggling question (which way to go).

I'm certain that this is sufficiently well-documented that I'm just looking
it up in the wrong places, or using the wrong search terms. However, it is
frustrating not to be able to map an intuitive if .. then .. else construct
onto something as fundamental as 'the next page to load is...'.

Help!

Tony

PS  the code for the form includes <form action = "PHP/signin.php">
and the script presently does all the error checking. However, it has no
mechanism for moving past the script.....

header("Location: /some/url/or/other");
exit();

There are slightly more proper ways to write that, but that's the jist  
of it.

You'll need to make sure that there's no output before the header  
line, or turn on output buffering to ensure there isn't.

Old thread that comes to mind as we're down-sizing at home. I can do
almost everything on my laptop and check in to a remote SVN but my wife
is a photographer and needs a place to store her images that are not yet
edited for SmugMug. I can easily see 60G by the end of the year, and
given that she's a good and prolific photographer, more as it goes. 

One idea is a "distributed amoungst friends" netowrk where I set up some
servers in other people's houses and share space in trade for power and
connectivity. Another is the S3 thing from Amazon, but as noted the lack
of rsync is an issue. My wife's Mac could probably be set up to do
something besides ftp, once we find a location to put stuff. 

Any more current ideas?

One software space offered us a backup combo for $1000 per year for a

backed up?  :)

I use these guys for personal and server backups:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] preg_match and pattern matching
Message-ID: <15710438105.20081122222457@qualityadvantages.com>

Hello and Greetings,

I have just been reviewing a script that says its a PHP firewall. It
is using an array with 250 elements that are all basically subsets of
code and injections that hackers use to break into sites. I could
easily take this array and create a preg_match test but was wondering
at what point pattern matching gets unmanageable or impractical. This
script looks a lot like .htaccess using mod rewrite to block badguys.

I would appreciates some feedback on this, what is the rest of the
world using to block or intercept bad guy injection attacks?

There's a solid-looking product that does this called CrashPlan:
http://www.crashplan.com/landing/index.html

Haven't used it, but I was impressed enough to consider it at one point.

As another option, the Windows guys at work like Mozy a lot.

Their site is oddly short on explanation. It's an open source Apache
module that does what your pho script is trying to do, and probably a
lot more. Aka WAF, web application firewall.

A good pattern for this is

if ( !headers_sent() ) {
  header( "Location: xyz" );
  exit();
}
else {
  exit( "<p>Please continue to <a href='xyz'>xyz</a></p>" );
}

That way you cover the case where there was an error or warning or
something that would prevent the automatic redirect. Of course, you
shouldn't be outputting errors on a production site, etc.

Yeah that's new - not sure who's bright idea that was.  But their service is
great, so +1 for the technical team, -1 for marketing.

using PHP? If that is possible would anybody know how to transfer 
screenshots to a MySQL database?

Uhm, the PHP code runs on the server side. So unless you want to capture 
screen shots on the server PHP has nothing to offer. You'd need to look at 
ECMAScript applications that may do the trick on the client side. But then 
again, capturing a screen shot is fairly easy on most systems (the most 
difficult, but also most flexible IMHO being OS X) and uploading the resulting 
file isn't that tricky either.
There are two ways you can deal with image files and a database. You can crate 
a BLOB field and store the binary data in there, which bloats the db size, but 
keeps everything in one package. Or you can store the images on the file 
system and only store a reference in the database. While that is much leaner 
in regards to db size it comes with other problems, such as missing files and 
the difficulty in changing the storage location of the images.
In my (still not done after 3 years) PiViViewer application I use the second 
approach as I rather work with the disadvantages than be tied to the database 
and an application to retrieve the images.

Hi PHP-gurus,

A client of mine (www.JewFind.com) is using the PHP mail() function to send signup email-confirmations and it works most of the time, but quite a few users have contacted them saying that they did not receive the email. We discovered that Yahoo mail requires the "-f sender at domain.com" header to deliver to the inbox instead of the junkmail box- anyone know if there other headers that can be added to make the delivery more reliable?

Thank you.

-- Use -fsomething at somehwere.com header

-- Make sure the web server's user is in /etc/mail/trusted-users if using
sendmail/etc.

-- And most importantly: relay mail through a real mail server with proper
DNS records, etc.  Many places now check for the correct DNS records and
listening SMTP ports to ensure it's a real server sending the mail.  Web
servers won't pass these tests.

Use SPL to implement ArrayAccess on your db object? Then you can use one check and not resort to brute forcing all the others.
it would turn into:
echo $result['stuff'];

Dunno if that is completely clear.

Hi all,

A company I work with has a wonderful billing system in place, but is 
having difficulty keeping track of clients in their already existing 
home-grown database.

Can anyone here suggest a simple PHP application that helps manage 
customers (almost like a CRM), but can also do things like generate/email 
quotes, etc.?  Basically, everything without the actual billing system.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Message-ID: <b5b976a60811241839h5711395aj25a33a3b0164d5a9@mail.gmail.com>

Many thanks to  [csnyder] and [Tim Lieberman] for their helpful suggestions
about header ().

I now have that part of things working fine. However, because there is an
implicit exit; after issuing the call to header (), I'm uncertain if the
$_SESSION variables are being set properly.

When I trace them at the end of one page they are all there
($_SESSION['userid'] = $userid; $_SESSION['badgename']=$badgename;), but
when I examine the $_SESSION array at the start of the next page, the
variables do not exist. My guess is that by short-circuiting any nrmal
end-of-script processing, I may be bypassing the write of the $_SESSION
array to the temporary file. This feels like forcing a buffer-flush when
working with low-level disc IO. Is there any known reason for $_SESSION
variables to disappear in such circumstances?

Does anyone have any other ideas?

Thanks for any pointers,

Tony

Hello NYPHP,

Back in mid October, I posted a query here about badguys bypassing the
registration process on my vBulletin sites. I have since discovered
that they were not bypassing the process, they hijack it with a
Russian Hack called Xrumer. The latest version of it apparently have
the capability and is quite effective at using OCR to crack Captcha
codes including the ones used by Google and Hotmail.

Any comments on possible ways to detect and/or redirect and/or prevent automated
hacker tools like this from hijacking your site?

They've already been written; what you're doing is losing the 
identification of the session, so they can't be found. So when you use 
the header command, you need to carry along the session id as a GET 
variable, like this:
header( 'Location:somepage.php?PHPSESSID=' . session_id() );

That shouldn't be necessary.  I know I saw some problem like that, but  
the following sort of thing produces expected output for me:

[begin: pageone.php]
<?PHP
session_start();
$_SESSION['foo'] = 'bar';
header("Location: pagetwo.php');

[end: pagetwo.php]
[begin pagetwo.php]
<PHP
session_start();
echo 'Foo: ' . $_SESSION['foo'];

[end: pagetwo.php]

visiting pageone.php results in a redirect to pagetwo.php, which  
proceeds to output:

Foo: bar


Tony -- is it possible you're not calling session_start() on your  
destination page?

If you redirect to some static page after setting the session var(s),  
and look at your cookies, do you have a PHPSESSID session cookie in  
your browser? (obviously, you'll want to clear any such cookies before  
testing)

But like I said, the funny thing is that I remember years ago dealing  
with some issue just like this ... just failing to recall specifics.

I know I do the above sort of thing all the time without incident.

Give us the raw HTTP from these two transactions, and I'm sure we can  
quickly identify the problem.

I use the header() redirect frequently in combination with sessions. What I 
found to be a mandatory must at all times is to execute session_start(); at 
the very beginning of any script working with the session variable. Do that 
before including any files, setting anything, or executing any code. That 
always did the trick for me. Doing it a few lines further down when it would 
make logical sense often caused that the session was gone, even when 
referencing the session_ID.
Also, and I think that is in one of the annotations on php.net for header(), 
when using the header() redirect explicitly write the values to the session 
(of course I forgot the command for that). At times the redirect is completed 
before the session is written out and with a new request coming in the PHP 
interpreter gets confused as to what belongs where.

Duplicity now supports S3 natively and uses rsync.

I am dying to try it, right now using a homebrew solution based on encfs and 
s3fs to backup my home systems but it is slow and clunky.

Yes. S3 works great. This php class makes it easy from server-side:

S3 support has been added to some sftp clients (like Transmit for OS
X); I'm sure there are standalone clients for all OSes.

I've been very successful blocking automated registration/posting with
Mollom (http://mollom.com). It uses heuristics and blacklists to
detect spammy form submissions, sends a CAPTCHA back if the submission
get flagged. I've had zero false positive and about 99.5% of bad guy
posts blocked. Most automated tools don't bother waiting for a
response to their post, so they never even see the second page with
the CAPTCHA.

There is a PHP library available on their site, but I haven't heard
anything about vBulletin integration. If nobody's done it yet, it
shouldn't be tough to hook the two together. And I'm sure the rest of
the vBulletin community would love you :)

Wow, hot. I'll check that out. Response times good? Are you finding

The reason this isn't in the manual is that it's wrong. $_SESSION is  
serialized and stored in the session data store at the end of  
execution. The Location header is just a header; nothing different  
happens until the request is received by the client.

Hope that helps.

one option: assuming you have root and use Apache, you could setup 
mod_security
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/apache/2003/11/26/mod_security.html
http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/index.html

and most competent shared hosts will have this installed already. It will 
block most automated and/or common attacks. As with any security measure, 
sometimes it can be a PITA due to false positives, and it is only one part of 
a good defense. But I wouldn't run any non-trusted PHP code on a public 
server without it, if your host doesn't use it get one who does.

In my experience with Yahoo -- the biggest thing that I have seen is a
proper DomainKeys setup.

"If you're a postmaster interested in implementing DomainKeys to protect
your domain, you can find more technical details at
http://antispam.yahoo.com/ and implementation information at
http://domainkeys.sourceforge.net."

Hi,

Is here anyone who has experience with the php library "phurple". I have

For this very reason I switched to SwiftMail long ago (written in
PHP). I can log into an account on a mail server (i.e. gmail) and send
emails through that account. It's free and very robust, but also has a
"simple" mode.

Brent,

It appears that SwiftMail operates like an SMTP but it also tracks delivery 
stats, is that right? It is easy to reconfigure either PHP or the current 
SMTP server to relay mail through another server like SwiftMail, but why 
would SwiftMail yield any higher delivery rates?

No, SwiftMail doesn't have to relay. You can give it your username and
password and it will actually login to the mail server you specified
and send the email, just like an email client (i.e. Outlook).
You don't have to change any configurations on the mail server, so you
can use yahoo, gmail, your own, or any other mail system to send your
emails. It's not relaying through the mail server, it actually sending
it from mail server as a logged in user. Plus, you can set whatever
headers you want. Which is why delivery rates would be higher.

The PHP mail command does not login to mail servers, it has to have
what is essentially an open relay.

Hi all,

Thanks much for coming out tonight.  The presentation is online, as is the
video from the OWASP conference.

http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/

There are also many other videos/slides from the other talks given at the
conference, many relevant and expounding on some topics covered tonight
(application firewalls for example).

Have a great Thanksgiving all.

Pretty cool! Two questions, one note, after looking at the slides in PDF
format.

?  You mention "magic_*" on slide 13, what are you referring to, asks
the neophyte...

? Also on slide 13 you use the acronym "B.E. aggressive", what does
"B.E." stand for.

#  On slide 20 you suggest learning more coding from experienced people,
and I'd have to suggest plugging NYPHP and other good places. You guys
and gals have been awesome! Since the slides are now world viewable you
might want to include references to $self and other places to do the
things you mention on that slide.

Good presentation, and timely!

You mean like YouSendIt? That seems to be the goto service for people I know.

i have developed a very simple yousendit.com clon with a progress bar, but i
dont think HTTP is the best protocol to transfer big files (like 1 Gb or
more, at least from my experience, but i know that some clients ask for
these kind of websites)

i also noticed when doing it that PHP 5.x doesnt have anything to control
the state of the uploads, i read about something called APC but i didnt try
it

i used AJAX for the client side to send the request to start the upload and
a Perl implementation on the server side because of this

unless you really have something tested that will let you know the state of
each upload it is very difficult to be sure that all the files are complete

you cant create a hash from client side since Javascript will not let you
access any files on the user fs (this is ok because of security reasons)

if the implementation involves calling different JS functions during the
upload process you will also have to check that the browsers dont leak
memory (because with 1 GB files those leaks are very big and may cause IE /
Firefox to crash)

(sorry for my english)

There are a number of ini settings and functions that contain the word
magic, or are related to some magic functionality - for instance
magic_quotes.  Best bet is to do a full text search of php.net for magic, or
just google around for php magic etc...

Nothing - just from a song I liked, which I have in there for dramatic

I once had a problem with my server executing php and the code was dumped
out to the screen.

 

So, php isn't that terribly secure if your server has a glitch.  So many
folks put their passwords right there in a file that can be dumped to the
screen.  

 

In my current case I am using ajax because xmlhttp doesn't cross domains, I
didn't have a real security risk I believe from users call the php file
directly with data.  There would have to be a function call to execute the
php.  Without someone calling a function, nothing would happen.

 

If someone remotely embedded my php file remotely in their app, they could
have made a function call if they knew the name?

 

What does anyone know about linking a php file from another server?  I
haven't really tried it.  I don't think.  That would be my real concern.

 

The php.org docs say the http_referer can not be trusted.  Plus, I didn't
even see it defined in my phpinfo.  I don't know if it's only defined if
there is an explicit statement to do so.  Do you know another way of
requiring that some php files are only called by an app in the same domain?

 

I'd like to either prevent a remote call to my php file in htaccess.  I was
thinking something like:

 

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(.+\.)?wantedgaming\.com/ [NC]

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$

RewriteRule .myfile\.php$ stub.php [L]

RewriteRule .myfile2\.php$ stub.php [L]

RewriteRule .myfile3\.php$ stub.php [L]

 

I was thinking I wanted to reinforce this inside the php file, but if
htaccess has it covered, it's probably a non-issue.

 

Does this look right?

Subject: User Input Data scrubbing

 

I'm trying to scrub data input to insert into a database which I will later
display on the website.

 

In order to prevent sql injections and html injections into the code, I
figured I'd just replace non alphanumeric characters with their html special
character codes and remove any control characters all together except
carriage return.

 

The ascii character codes only go up to 255.

 

However, there are lots more characters in html.

 

If the user creates a string from which was generated using html using
characters outside of the ascii character codes, what do those get
translated to in the string?  A garage character?

 

Is that a concern?  Or is my only concern those 255 characters in the ascii
chart?  I'm thinking the 255 characters covers it all.  The characters are a
finite set which were long ago predefined, unless that changes in the
future, right?  This means scrubbing the data is a short function.

 

I'm not using mysql_real_escape_string, because I replace all ' and " with
their html character code.

 

I'm not using htmlspecialchars, because it wasn't thorough enough.  I simply
wrote a function that replaces just about every character with it's html
character code.

 

I'm doing this in php after the data is passed to me.

 

Now, in the case of ajax, I just need to come up with a good approach for
checking the data received from php, which may vary depending on the type of
ajax used.

if you really want to remove the possibility of people hitting these php's
you should
move them out of your webroot.

Oh! sorry to be so short with my other mail.

Generally when you request a php file on a php enabled web server the code
is executed and output is returned.

In essence this means that if you are returning text ie: <?php echo "hello
world" ?> instead of the execution result ie: hello world
you quite a serious problem on your hands (especially if you include your
passwords and such in a web accessible directory).

A way around this would to do something like (in .htaccess) ...

<IfModule !php_module>
    Deny from all
</IfModule>

Which basically says, if the php module is not installed.. throw a "Access
Denied" error to the requestor.

-------

As far as locking the user into a specific domain, I would reccommend you
use php sessions.  In which
case you can force a cookie to work for a specific domain.  If the user
attempts to create a cookie manually
it wont work as they would have to guess an active session id.

This breaches on the topic of Cross Site Scripting, but sessions should be
good enough for your needs.

I'm getting closer.

 

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(.+\.)?mydomain\.com/ [NC]

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$

RewriteRule .*\.(jpe?g|gif|bmp|png)$ /img/nolink.jpg [L]

RewriteRule .type1(.+)?\.php(.+)?$ stub.php [L]

RewriteRule .file1\.php(.+)?$ stub.php [L]

 

These rules prevent my domain from calling the modules.

 

The html uses    src="../../type1.php?arg1=blah" and

                        Src="../../file1.php"

 

I want my code and my code only to be able to use these modules.

Michele,


SQL injection and Html injection are two separate issues.

SQL injection is something like a user posting ';DELETE FROM users;  where
it deletes all of your user accounts.

Html/Cross Site Scripting is more along the lines of what you are talking
about.  There are tons of libraries out there
that attempt to kill off as many of these as possible.

As far as your 255 character theory, it is not completely true.  There are
other character sets such as UTF-8 which allow
for 65 thousand characters.  I would seriously invest some time into finding

I don't keep passwords in a web accessible directory.

 

My current php module is part of ajax, unless you make a function call the
php module does nothing.

 

Doesn't errordocument do basically the same thing as the following?

 

<IfModule !php_module>
    Deny from all
</IfModule>



If they try to access a non existence module I just display an error
document.  That would through an error?  Right?

Oh! sorry to be so short with my other mail.

Generally when you request a php file on a php enabled web server the code
is executed and output is returned.

In essence this means that if you are returning text ie: <?php echo "hello
world" ?> instead of the execution result ie: hello world
you quite a serious problem on your hands (especially if you include your
passwords and such in a web accessible directory).

A way around this would to do something like (in .htaccess) ...

<IfModule !php_module>
    Deny from all
</IfModule>

Which basically says, if the php module is not installed.. throw a "Access
Denied" error to the requestor.

-------

As far as locking the user into a specific domain, I would reccommend you
use php sessions.  In which
case you can force a cookie to work for a specific domain.  If the user
attempts to create a cookie manually
it wont work as they would have to guess an active session id.

This breaches on the topic of Cross Site Scripting, but sessions should be
good enough for your needs.

I once had a problem with my server executing php and the code was dumped
out to the screen.

 

So, php isn't that terribly secure if your server has a glitch.  So many
folks put their passwords right there in a file that can be dumped to the
screen.  

 

In my current case I am using ajax because xmlhttp doesn't cross domains, I
didn't have a real security risk I believe from users call the php file
directly with data.  There would have to be a function call to execute the
php.  Without someone calling a function, nothing would happen.

 

If someone remotely embedded my php file remotely in their app, they could
have made a function call if they knew the name?

 

What does anyone know about linking a php file from another server?  I
haven't really tried it.  I don't think.  That would be my real concern.

 

The php.org docs say the http_referer can not be trusted.  Plus, I didn't
even see it defined in my phpinfo.  I don't know if it's only defined if
there is an explicit statement to do so.  Do you know another way of
requiring that some php files are only called by an app in the same domain?

 

I'd like to either prevent a remote call to my php file in htaccess.  I was
thinking something like:

 

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(.+\.)?wantedgaming\.com/ [NC]

RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$

RewriteRule .myfile\.php$ stub.php [L]

RewriteRule .myfile2\.php$ stub.php [L]

RewriteRule .myfile3\.php$ stub.php [L]

 

I was thinking I wanted to reinforce this inside the php file, but if
htaccess has it covered, it's probably a non-issue.

 

Does this look right?

I'm looking at two separate issues right now: SQL injection and Html
injection.  

 

But, I think you can kill two birds with one stone.

 

Remove the characters and prevent sql and html injection simultaneously.

 

O.k. Then I have a new question.

 

If I'm using the default character set and not specifying character set, do
I just have 255 characters?

 

Should I convert the strings to a particular character set or it that
already in place in php receiving a character string?

Michele,


SQL injection and Html injection are two separate issues.  

SQL injection is something like a user posting ';DELETE FROM users;  where
it deletes all of your user accounts.

Html/Cross Site Scripting is more along the lines of what you are talking
about.  There are tons of libraries out there
that attempt to kill off as many of these as possible.

As far as your 255 character theory, it is not completely true.  There are
other character sets such as UTF-8 which allow
for 65 thousand characters.  I would seriously invest some time into finding
a library that you can integrate.

Subject: User Input Data scrubbing

 

I'm trying to scrub data input to insert into a database which I will later
display on the website.

 

In order to prevent sql injections and html injections into the code, I
figured I'd just replace non alphanumeric characters with their html special
character codes and remove any control characters all together except
carriage return.

 

The ascii character codes only go up to 255.

 

However, there are lots more characters in html.

 

If the user creates a string from which was generated using html using
characters outside of the ascii character codes, what do those get
translated to in the string?  A garage character?

 

Is that a concern?  Or is my only concern those 255 characters in the ascii
chart?  I'm thinking the 255 characters covers it all.  The characters are a
finite set which were long ago predefined, unless that changes in the
future, right?  This means scrubbing the data is a short function.

 

I'm not using mysql_real_escape_string, because I replace all ' and " with
their html character code.

 

I'm not using htmlspecialchars, because it wasn't thorough enough.  I simply
wrote a function that replaces just about every character with it's html
character code.

 

I'm doing this in php after the data is passed to me.

 

Now, in the case of ajax, I just need to come up with a good approach for
checking the data received from php, which may vary depending on the type of
ajax used.

 

Michele

The best one of these happens to be written in PHP:

http://htmlpurifier.org/

If your needs are extremely simple, HTML Purifier might be more than  
you need, in which case a simple solution like this might work:

Not if you want to adhere to best practices. XSS is not something you  
can remove. It's the result of sloppy programming.

On my blog, XSS is talked about a lot, so many of the comments might  
appear to be XSS attacks. I haven't (yet) had a vulnerability in my  
comment code, despite being a constant target for attack, and despite  
the fact that I don't remove any part of anyone's comment.

There's a lot of misinformation out there, so tread carefully.

Apparently, you can only have one rule after defining the conditions.

 

Is this right?

 

Now this doesn't stop them from inserting into the stream?

 

Nor, does it prevent direct http call from the browser, but it does prevent,
I believe, embedding the files and trying to make direct function calls from
code.

Well, if they add a bell, form feed, cancel, end of transmitting, I'm
removing it.  That's not a legitimate part of a comment.

I don't want to remove any legitimate part of my user's comment either.

If they have code samples or anything else for that matter, I want it to
display.  I'm not, however, linking in pictures or linking urls.  People can
cut and paste that into the browser if they want to follow up on the
person's comments.

But, I don't want to crash my website, either.

XSS - cross server scripting?  Embedding your php in the code?

I checked out http://htmlpurifier.org

They stripped <script> alert('hi'); </script> out of the input.

I convert that to text and display it as text.  I don't like the removal of
that.

The best one of these happens to be written in PHP:

http://htmlpurifier.org/

If your needs are extremely simple, HTML Purifier might be more than  
you need, in which case a simple solution like this might work:

Hope that helps.

What about inserting a comment

 

<script>alert('hi');</script>'; delete from users;

 

Like I'm going to name my table users?

 

With that one statement about they have performed a sql injection and html
injection in one stroke.

 

Bada bing bada bang bada boom

 

Next time I display their comment out of the database they are popping up an
alert to every user and my users are gone.

Michele,


SQL injection and Html injection are two separate issues.  

SQL injection is something like a user posting ';DELETE FROM users;  where
it deletes all of your user accounts.

Html/Cross Site Scripting is more along the lines of what you are talking
about.  There are tons of libraries out there
that attempt to kill off as many of these as possible.

As far as your 255 character theory, it is not completely true.  There are
other character sets such as UTF-8 which allow
for 65 thousand characters.  I would seriously invest some time into finding
a library that you can integrate.

I'm trying to scrub data input to insert into a database which I will later
display on the website.

 

In order to prevent sql injections and html injections into the code, I
figured I'd just replace non alphanumeric characters with their html special
character codes and remove any control characters all together except
carriage return.

 

The ascii character codes only go up to 255.

 

However, there are lots more characters in html.

 

If the user creates a string from which was generated using html using
characters outside of the ascii character codes, what do those get
translated to in the string?  A garage character?

 

Is that a concern?  Or is my only concern those 255 characters in the ascii
chart?  I'm thinking the 255 characters covers it all.  The characters are a
finite set which were long ago predefined, unless that changes in the
future, right?  This means scrubbing the data is a short function.

 

I'm not using mysql_real_escape_string, because I replace all ' and " with
their html character code.

 

I'm not using htmlspecialchars, because it wasn't thorough enough.  I simply
wrote a function that replaces just about every character with it's html
character code.

 

I'm doing this in php after the data is passed to me.

 

Now, in the case of ajax, I just need to come up with a good approach for
checking the data received from php, which may vary depending on the type of
ajax used.

 

Michele

Michelle,

you should clean the data in 2 different ways.  first, get rid of all of the
xss stuff.  Then before you insert the cleaned data into the database, clean
out any attempts at SQL injection.

There are tons of frameworks and libraries out there that handle exactly
this.

Just convert it to CSV (comma delimited).  Excel is good at importing that
type of data.

I could have sworn I sent this out already.

 

My question, my most important one of the day.

 

If I pass a string from html/javascript to php, does it not assume that the
string is the default character set, containing only 255 characters?

 

Or, do I have to cast that string to a specific character set.

 

I want to force my strings to have only 255 characters.  That way, I know
what I'm dealing with.  A finite set of characters.

 

Michele

I'm not using htmlspecialchars, because it wasn't thorough enough.  I simply
wrote a function that replaces just about every character with it's html
character code.

 

I'm doing this in php after the data is passed to me.

 

Now, in the case of ajax, I just need to come up with a good approach for
checking the data received from php, which may vary depending on the type of
ajax used.

Michelle,

you should clean the data in 2 different ways.  first, get rid of all of the
xss stuff.  Then before you insert the cleaned data into the database, clean
out any attempts at SQL injection.

There are tons of frameworks and libraries out there that handle exactly
this.

With that one statement about they have performed a sql injection and html

Bada bing bada bang bada boom

 

Next time I display their comment out of the database they are popping up an
alert to every user and my users are gone.

Michele,




SQL injection and Html injection are two separate issues.  

SQL injection is something like a user posting ';DELETE FROM users;  where
it deletes all of your user accounts.

Html/Cross Site Scripting is more along the lines of what you are talking
about.  There are tons of libraries out there
that attempt to kill off as many of these as possible.

As far as your 255 character theory, it is not completely true.  There are
other character sets such as UTF-8 which allow
for 65 thousand characters.  I would seriously invest some time into finding
a library that you can integrate.

Subject: User Input Data scrubbing

 

I'm trying to scrub data input to insert into a database which I will later
display on the website.

 

In order to prevent sql injections and html injections into the code, I
figured I'd just replace non alphanumeric characters with their html special
character codes and remove any control characters all together except
carriage return.

 

The ascii character codes only go up to 255.

 

However, there are lots more characters in html.

 

If the user creates a string from which was generated using html using
characters outside of the ascii character codes, what do those get
translated to in the string?  A garage character?

 

Is that a concern?  Or is my only concern those 255 characters in the ascii
chart?  I'm thinking the 255 characters covers it all.  The characters are a
finite set which were long ago predefined, unless that changes in the
future, right?  This means scrubbing the data is a short function.

 

I'm not using mysql_real_escape_string, because I replace all ' and " with
their html character code.

 

I'm not using htmlspecialchars, because it wasn't thorough enough.  I simply
wrote a function that replaces just about every character with it's html

hrm.. it depends on a bunch of different things, including your db charset
and the charset in your html.  You can convert between them.. but why hack
it when you can filter the data when it goes into the database?

Filter once, its faster and consistent.

Thanks Elijah,

I'm not very smart about these things.

There are about 10.000 companies and I would like to put this into a database, so I guess one would download all the pages and then put in csv and then create a tool to create columns and rows based on either static and variable fields?

Anything does that automatically?

humayoo, you can check html2pdf to do this

it works very fine and it is simple, but just remember not to indent the
HTML code too much since the parser may not work 100 % if so

there was also a very good project related called domPDF but unfortunately
the development has been discontinued and so i wouldnt recommend you to use
it

Yeah, or these two words: "Filter Input"

Which ever route you take. you also need to do sql injection cleansing.

scrub, rinse, repeat.

The point of the htaccess I was working on was to attempt to prevent xss
where others try to embed my php in their code on their server.

I also tighted up my code, but I figured the more I can do to secure the
website, the better.

I'm not relying on this alone.

I'm also scrubbing data in the php files and in the javascript files.
