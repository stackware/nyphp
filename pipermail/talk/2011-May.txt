I want to offer users to be able to download a file from a PHP script.  
I seem to remember there were/are file size download limits with PHP?  
Also what is the best practice for doing this with a PHP script? Thanks!

You're probably thinking of the php ini settings that affect file 
uploads.  The issues you're likely to run into offering large downloads 
are indirect; memory limits can be a problem if you have to buffer the 
entire file into memory in PHP.

If you can stream it out to the client instead you can offer virtually 
unlimited file sizes.  You may need to extend the maximum execution time 
to avoid having your script cut off mid-download.

Best practice would include providing proper HTTP headers according to 
your situation, including Content-Disposition (with filename) and 
Content-Length so the browser's download progress meter will work properly.

There are no filesize limits, but you can run in to memory limits if
you load the file into memory.

To avoid this, use `fpassthru`.

In terms of best practices, don't pass a user generated filename into
fopen.  It is a security mess.

If you really need to allow arbitrary filenames, you should scrub both
slashes and leading periods.

I am a programmer who  an office to work out of both on a short-term
(instant, asap) basis and also longer-term basis for my trading/software
company, MarketAPI.

On a shorter-term basis, I need to quickly find an office that I can work in
today (this afternoon, possibly even into tonight) around midtown (or other
locations I am open to :)), that I could work out of.

Even locations such as Long Island and NJ would be possible too, depending
on size and space and how easy it is to access (eg PATH, LIRR, train...
cab).

Hello All:
I am designing a site and need assistance on one issue.   It has to deal with 
fonts.  to change the width of a font, you would use the font-width statement to 
change the font from left-to-right.  is there a way of changing it from 
top-to-bottom.  ie to stretch the font ?

thanks in advance

The only feasible way to do this that I am aware of is with CSS3 and the 
font-stretch declaration.  But it will still only scale it horizontally, 
not vertically.

Hi Ian,

You can use line-height to adjust the height of the space the font fits in, but as far as I know there isn't a way to scale the font vertically.  Even if there was a way to do that I wouldn't recommend it because it would distort the original intended look of the typeface.  If you need a taller font and increasing the size makes it too wide, pick a different typeface.  There are quite a few to choose from with the advent of web fonts -- check out these sites:

http://typekit.com/
http://webfonts.fonts.com/
http://www.fonts.com/
http://www.google.com/webfonts

Also check out this API for accessing typefaces from various providers through a common interface: http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/

Hi Ian,

You can use line-height to adjust the height of the space the font fits in, but 
as far as I know there isn't a way to scale the font vertically.  Even if there 
was a way to do that I wouldn't recommend it because it would distort the 
original intended look of the typeface.  If you need a taller font and 
increasing the size makes it too wide, pick a different typeface.  There are 
quite a few to choose from with the advent of web fonts -- check out these 
sites:

http://typekit.com/
http://webfonts.fonts.com/
http://www.fonts.com/
http://www.google.com/webfonts

Also check out this API for accessing typefaces from various providers through a 
common interface: http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/

Hello All:
I am designing a site and need assistance on one issue.   It has to deal with 
fonts.  to change the width of a font, you would use the font-width statement to 
change the font from left-to-right.  is there a way of changing it from 
top-to-bottom.  ie to stretch the font ?

thanks in advance

The only feasible way to do this that I am aware of is with CSS3 and the 
font-stretch declaration.  But it will still only scale it horizontally, 
not vertically.

Hi, Ian:

Set font-size to the height you need and use (per Anthony's comment)
font-stretch to adjust the width of the typeface. The caveat is that
font-stretch is CSS3 and buggy or non-existent in most browsers. IE 9 is
rumored to support it as is FF3.6+ but it is probably too early to reliably
use it, even on those browsers.

You could also use negative letter-spacing to tighten up the tracking but
you need a light hand with this approach and it simply positions the letters
closer to each other without changing the width.

Using alternate typefaces, @font-face, for example fontsquirrel  (
http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator) or cufon (
http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/) is an option, but you need to keep
typeface copyrights in mind when you use those services.

Good luck on your design.

Ron

Message-ID: <86E4537A-C718-4079-A886-4D23EBF97946@gmail.com>

I'm using Tumblr.com for a blog platform for a new website. It has a  
lot of benefits as a blog, but it also has the restriction of not  
being able to embed PHP code in the HTML theme template. (Yes, I know,  
my feelings exactly! :-) )

But Tumblr does support Javascript. What I'm trying to do is get the  
county code of the user so that different links can be presented to  
them that matches their country. Serving up different links based on  
the country code would be handled by Javascript.

There is a Javascript Google library jsapi, but it doesn't work  
properly for county code. For example,  I'm in the New York City metro  
area and it says I'm in Canada, not the US. I don't recalling having  
this kind of problem with PHP scripts, so I'd like to use a PHP  
script. But I don't know of a way in JavaScript to be able to call a  
PHP script and make the result accessible with the Javascript so it  
can serve up the correct country links.

I admit I've not done much Javascript programming compared to PHP, so  
I'm not sure if I'm overlooking something. Maybe this is a AJAX and  
jQuery task? I'd appreciate it if someone could offer a workable  
solution.

Thanks in advance!

Yes, You will need to set up an ajax call to your php script. I use json to send the response back so it is already in a form javascript can handle without needing to parse it. Of course just replying with a country code is simple enough so you wouldn't need to use json.

Jquery has some nice wrappers for ajax, so follow their examples on the site. Just remember to set your response Content-type headers in PHP to text/json so it is treated as a json object when it is received by the browser.

I'm not sure why the google library is saying you're in Canada.  MaxMind
provides a javascript api you can add to your page to get the visitor's
location from his/her ip address: http://www.maxmind.com/app/javascript_city

I really doubt google's ip-> location database is broken that badly,
but if you do want to do this, I recommend something like the
following:

javascript:

<script>
$.getJSON('http://myserver.com/getlocation.php?callback=foobar',function(location)
{
   if(location.country == 'US')
      // do something with `location`
});
</script>

php:

<?php

$location = getLocation($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);

echo $_GET['callback'] . '(' . json_encode($location) . ');';



The code I wrote above uses JSONP to get around cross-domain issues.

Regards,
John Campbell

David:

Certainly a Javascript program can call a php script -- here's a demo:

There's a description at the site.

Yes, it's odd, here I am using Verizon FIOS (for the past 4 years) and  
most any place on the web I go to knows I'm in the US, but the Google  
JSAPI and examples by others using it I have tried say I'm in Canada.

(For those that don't think this is a real issue - Canada is like a  
whole other country. :-) )

I've also looked into IP databases where they have over 3 billion IP  
addresses stored and they update them. They suggest to keep them on  
your own server and do a wget in the crontab to update them monthly.  
I'm kind of surprised by this because I thought IP address ranges were  
assigned to countries to began with, but I'm sure that's a whole other  
discussion.

I wasn't familiar with the maxmind javascript service. So far it looks  
very good, it correctly said I was in the US and even the correct  
state. Thanks!
