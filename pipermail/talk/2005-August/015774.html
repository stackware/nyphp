Hiya,

If you're over on WWWAC you've already seen this but I'm asking here
from another slant. I have no idea what I can or can't do withOUT
having to create/manage a mySQL db...my server will let me do this
easily enough but it's been over a year since I've thought of PHP or
mySQL and I don't want to get so distracted by the programming
mindset that I forget what I was doing in the first place (trying to
do some marketing).

Below is the process I'm trying to implement - step 5 is where I'm
fuzzy...I know I could definitely have the URL come back to a
PHP page that looks up the string in a db (and a very simple one,
I'm sure, since it's just a list) but I'd rather just have the URL come
back to the Flash file and do the checking from within the .swf,
with ActionScript - is that easier or harder? Since you guys all love
PHP and probably only half of you even like AS, I know it's a biased
answer I'll get :-) but try to be objective and not play favorites
on the languages here.

What I want to do:

(1) user gives me email address

(2) with a PHP script (free from <A HREF="http://www.allhype.co.uk/tools/md5/">http://www.allhype.co.uk/tools/md5/</A>
and a very nice script actually!!) I MD5 their email address

(3) I send user a message (to validate the address works) that has
their MD5'd address as a link for them to come back and get what
they want

(4) user clicks unique query string in the email I've sent them

(4) I validate the string .....how/from where is the ??? :)

(5) if valid, give them the Flash file; if not, give them an error message

Any help much appreciated!

You could do all of this with just Flash, etc. assuming Flash has MD5, as
I'm sure it does, but you'll be limited. If you want to track who has
downloaded what files, the browser they're using, etc. you won't be able to
do so without a DB.

There's also a security concern here. There's no way to know that the email
address you've gotten originally, is the same as the one that's coming from
the link. Since you're not storing anything anywhere, you have no way to
keep persistent data. If I know that you're checking that an MD5 matches
the MD5 of the email address, I can pass you any MD5 I want, and it'll
validate.

A bookmarked session id might not result in a hijacked session, but
it's not a good idea have session ids exposed and kept around like
that.

Consider another example: Someone is logged into a newspaper site and
sees an interesing article. The user copies the url (with session id)
and pastes it in an email to a friend. If the friend receives the
email quickly and the server has a long timeout, accidential session
hijacking could occur.

The primary reason to have a session id in the url is if the browser
doesn't support cookies, right?

I think you have the purpose of the MD5 hash confused. In this case,
you want it to be an *unguessable* token that the user can bring back
to you to prove that they got they got your validation message, and
that they own the mailbox associated with the provided email address.

In other words, it should be random. If it's just the hash of their
email address, then an impersonator could easily generate the right
token and validate an address that isn't their own (as Hans pointed
out).

You will need some sort of DB -- MySQL or flat file or otherwise -- to
store the email address and the random token in the same record, so
that when the user clicks the link with the token in it, you can look
up the email and mark it valid.
