&gt;<i> A followup on yesterdays's article on PHP, Perl &amp; Python. Looks like
</I>&gt;<i> Zend has been put very much on the defensive...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is the web's love affair with PHP over?
</I>&gt;<i> By Gavin Clarke in San Francisco
</I>&gt;<i> Published Thursday 4th August 2005 22:39 GMT
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If Evans Data Corp (EDC) is to believed, then some big names in
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise systems have been rash in their support for open source scripting
</I>&gt;<i> language PHP. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This last eight months saw Intel, SAP, Oracle and IBM all support PHP,
</I>&gt;<i> with investments or product backing through partnerships with PHP king Zend
</I>&gt;<i> Technologies. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, EDC's survey has found PHP, along with scripting cousins Perl
</I>&gt;<i> and Python, is seeing drastically reduced adoption among developers in
</I>&gt;<i> Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Use of PHP has dropped by a
</I>&gt;<i> quarter in EMEA during the last 12 months to just under 28 per cent
</I>&gt;<i> while 40 per cent of developers said they have no plans to evaluate or use
</I>&gt;<i> PHP. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The EMEA numbers are a microcosm of a global trend, according to EDC.
</I>&gt;<i> Adoption of PHP is slowing in North America and slamming to a stop in Asia
</I>&gt;<i> Pacific. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> EDC believes PHP's recent glorious past is over, as customers spend
</I>&gt;<i> money on &quot;more important&quot; technologies to build mission
</I>&gt;<i> critical systems
</I>&gt;<i> and vendors like Microsoft and Sun Microsystems make more of
</I>&gt;<i> a concerted
</I>&gt;<i> marketing push around alternatives such as ASP.NET and
</I>&gt;<i> JavaServer Pages
</I>&gt;<i> (JSP).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> EDC chief operating officer John Andrew told The Register: &quot;There are
</I>&gt;<i> some alternatives that are better promoted and packaged, and
</I>&gt;<i> people are
</I>&gt;<i> turning to those.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Zend disputes EDC's figures with its own pro-PHP figures and dismisses
</I>&gt;<i> the view that Intel, SAP, Oracle and IBM placed bets on what
</I>&gt;<i> is turning
</I>&gt;<i> into an ephemeral developer strategy. Zend claims the number
</I>&gt;<i> of monthly
</I>&gt;<i> downloads of its Zend integrated development environment (IDE) today
</I>&gt;<i> number 20,000, up from 5,000 in September 2004, with an accompanying
</I>&gt;<i> 150% growth in the privately held company's revenue. Furthermore, Zend is
</I>&gt;<i> opening offices worldwide. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for stats, Zend points to Netcraft who claims 22m internet domains
</I>&gt;<i> use PHP, making it the internet's most popular scripting language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Microsoft is interested in PHP - the next version of IIS is going to
</I>&gt;<i> support PHP. If there was no interest, or we were seeing a decline of
</I>&gt;<i> interest in PHP, why would they get their product to support
</I>&gt;<i> PHP?&quot; asked
</I>&gt;<i> Zend vice president of marketing Michel Gerin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, while EDC maintains PHP is not seeing &quot;serious&quot; deployment,
</I>&gt;<i> Zend claims changes to the language like the addition of Object
</I>&gt;<i> Orientation (OO) in PHP 5.0 mean the language is going beyond pure web
</I>&gt;<i> site development and into the enterprise as an alternative to
</I>&gt;<i> Java and C
</I>&gt;<i> ++.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There-in, though, could lay a problem. If Java developers are indeed
</I>&gt;<i> picking-up PHP because - like almost anything else it seems - it is
</I>&gt;<i> simpler to use than Java, then it will hit the marketing wall of Sun,
</I>&gt;<i> BEA Systems, Borland, IBM and Oracle who either deliver serious Java
</I>&gt;<i> development tools or application servers. On C++, PHP must largely
</I>&gt;<i> contend with Microsoft's Goliath-like Visual Studio.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Idol curiosity could have accounted for the PHP spike EDC
</I>&gt;<i> identified two
</I>&gt;<i> years ago as large numbers of developers planned to evaluate or adopt
</I>&gt;<i> PHP. When it came to using PHP, though, that's where
</I>&gt;<i> developers probably
</I>&gt;<i> turned to their familiar tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While adoption may be slowing, PHP is not going away. With an estimated
</I>&gt;<i> 2.5m PHP developers and web sites going up on a daily basis that have
</I>&gt;<i> been built using PHP, the language is firmly ensconced in computing's
</I>&gt;<i> landscape. The only question seems to be: how deep can PHP go in business
</I>&gt;<i> computing? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The decision by IBM and Oracle to provide native support for PHP in
</I>&gt;<i> their databases proves they have recognized PHP's ability to
</I>&gt;<i> harm their
</I>&gt;<i> core businesses, and their desire to avert any problems by
</I>&gt;<i> winning over
</I>&gt;<i> PHP developers. According to Gerin, IBM and Oracle want to ensure PHP
</I>&gt;<i> developers develop applications and web sites that use their databases
</I>&gt;<i> and not &quot;PHP-optimized&quot; databases like MySQL. &quot;They want to be part of the
</I>&gt;<i> game,&quot; Gerin said. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Andrew agrees that the big vendors are just keeping their
</I>&gt;<i> options open.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I don't think PHP is going to go away fast - they have a
</I>&gt;<i> large share of
</I>&gt;<i> the market. Most of those suppliers have to remain open to
</I>&gt;<i> multiple ways
</I>&gt;<i> to be friendly,&quot; he said.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If EDC is right, then the real problem is not for the tier one vendors
</I>&gt;<i> who have deep pockets and multi-platform support to ride out any
</I>&gt;<i> tactical snafu, but an emerging class of start-ups betting their
</I>&gt;<i> business on LAMP. Companies like SpikeSource and SourceLabs plan to
</I>&gt;<i> provide certification and testing for business software in the Linux,
</I>&gt;<i> Apache, MySQL and Perl/Python/PHP (LAMP) stack. But, what
</I>&gt;<i> happens if the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;P&quot; part of the stack is losing developers and evaporates?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Andrew is confidant LAMP will adapt, and other open source languages
</I>&gt;<i> will take the place of PHP. &quot;[LAMP] was intended to be interchangeable -
</I>&gt;<i> that's the beauty of it. That's the beauty of open standards and open
</I>&gt;<i> source,&quot; he said.
