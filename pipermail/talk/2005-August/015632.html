&gt;<i> Hey Folks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is slightly off-topic, but I've just had the &quot;higher-ups&quot; come to
</I>&gt;<i> me asking about open source and coding audits.  I'm not speaking about
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative tools or auditing from a security perspective, but rather
</I>&gt;<i> from a legal perspective.  Simply put, how do you know were a piece of
</I>&gt;<i> code really came from?
</I>
Maybe the SCO lawyers can help with this  :)

&gt;<i> I'm hoping that others on the list have gone through this (or are
</I>&gt;<i> actually going through it now) and can provide some insight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some general questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. When you decide to use a piece of open source software, what do you
</I>&gt;<i> document? (package name, authors, download location, website, license,
</I>&gt;<i> date/time, etc)
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Do you feel the need to actually verify that they wrote it?  Or is
</I>&gt;<i> it enough to say, &quot;This is a popular package, and it is generally
</I>&gt;<i> accepted that this person wrote it.&quot;
</I>
This really comes down to the license.  If it's GPL, you basically are legally bound to make your &quot;derived works&quot; public as well.  Of course, what defines derived works is not something clearly defined.

&gt;<i> As this could relate to PHP:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  The PEAR and PECL repositories - is there anything built into the
</I>&gt;<i> package approval process that looks for this?  I didn't see anything on
</I>&gt;<i> the website.  I would imagine that some Google searches probably occur
</I>&gt;<i> just to make sure this package
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Code posted on the PHP site by users?  Is that &quot;free&quot; to use?
</I>
Ugh - there's that word again, free :)

&gt;<i> I realize that most of us aren't lawyers, and we're getting help from
</I>&gt;<i> our legal team, but any help you can provide is greatly appreciated.
</I>
It's certainly a sticky area.  But, keep in mind, that most of the larger open source projects, like PHP and Apache, are licensed using a BSD style license.  These questions should only be answered by lawyers, but most source from PEAR and PECL should have a header indicating the license.  Typically, this is the PHP license, and so you're likely safe - but again, no one really knows :)
