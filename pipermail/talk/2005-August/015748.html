You probably have a shared hosting environment, where other websites are
being hosted on your server too, right?

I think this has even been addressed earlier in this thread, but here it is
again.  The PHP interpreter doesn't distinguish between sessions pertaining
to different sites hosted on the same server.  It treats all sessions
equally, and wipes them out after the specified time period.  So:

Situation A:
--You have session lifetime set high
--Someone else hosted on server has it set to default lifetime
Result: all sessions get wiped after 24 minutes

Situation B:
--You have session lifetime set to 1 minute
--Someone else hosted on server has it set to default lifetime
Result: all sessions get wiped after 1 minute, all other users hosted on
that server start posting to newsgroups that their sessions are only
lasting one minute and they don't know what is wrong

I think if you change the session save path to someplace not shared with
other users (but the webserver has to be able to read and write to it),
you'll be okay.

Thanks for suggestions, but this is not the case, I am experienced php
programmer and aware with all these possible situation which can this
problem. Although we are running different different websites, we have only
single httpd.conf file where everything is hosted and I have set higher
session time out value in that file only, so no other wiste is overridding
it. I have also checked whether &quot;atime&quot; is enabled for session directory or
not. And it is enabled. There is not even any other cron etc. script that
can empty &quot;/tmp&quot; folder after regualr interval. I know most of reason where
session time out may not work properly, but I have checked all of them and
none of them is causing this problem.

Sorry, I just forgot to mention these in my post, otherwise you could have
though in different directions.
