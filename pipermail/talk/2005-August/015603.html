I think this is a great discussion and very worthwhile, and some of 
these explanations should be very enlightening. However, we need to be 
aware of the problems associated with one of the &quot;80/20 rules&quot; (which 
these approaches &quot;seem&quot; to endorse). (satisfy 80% of the market and 
don't worry about the other non-mainstream 20%).

* Let's not forget that vulnerability usually comes from lazy or 
incomplete coding. When corners are cut (for whatever reasons, with 
whatever validity), vulnerabilities are left in place.After reading this 
thread I can imagine coders carefuly coding so those with static IPs and 
static user agents get standard auth and those who vary get trapped by 
extra security checkpoints that are little more than re-checks of the 
same credentials. Sure, as the argument goes, there may be more risk so 
why not re-check.

* Let's just make sure that you are testing your code well enough that 
your 20% are properly managed (chances are your dev machines will rarely 
go through the extra checks and if they do, you'll probably bypass it 
for convenience).
Let's also make sure we aren't inconveniencing the most important market 
segment in that 20% -- I know some of my privacy websites would fail 
miserably if this sort of &quot;extra security&quot; were deployed.
Once you start inspecting UA, you get into the browser standards world - 
plenty of browser/extension combinations mess with the UA or block it 
altogether. As already stated many times, proxies wreak havoc with IPs 
and UA strings.

 From a user-friendliness perspective, there is little more annoying to 
me than a definitive but erroneous statement from an error message or 
security check (like when I have cookies ENABLED and I get a message 
&quot;Your browser does not accept cookies...please turn them on and try 
again&quot;).

Personally I prefer the concept of &quot;translucent data&quot;, although I 
recognize it is not for everyone. Start with
