<PRE>Thanks for the information, was greatly helpful.

I have a question about the basics of sessions you listed though - you say 
that you provide the user with a cookie that contains a long string; what if 
they don't allow cookies? are you referring to the session as a cookie?

And I have a question about my current system:
As of right now, I create 3 sessions for each user: userID, user, and pass 
(md5 of it, I never directly deal with the user's password). The reason I 
think my current system is poor is because I trust the session, and I only 
check the 'userID' session for authentication. So for instance, if the 
userID is mine (ie, 16), and that userid has access to certain areas of the 
website, I allow it, without any further checks.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's safe, but it's the system I created 
before I knew much about how php worked, so I didn't really know any better, 
which is why I'm trying to create a more secure system.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basics of sessions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) User logs in providing something he knows (username, password)
</I>&gt;<i> 2) You assign (cookie) the browser with a long random string. You record
</I>&gt;<i> the string in a datastore on the server.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Anytime you get hits from a browser which presents the long random 
</I>&gt;<i> string
</I>&gt;<i> that's in your datastore, you can assume it's the same user - therefore 
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> need not ask for the username/password again. Also, you know what the user
</I>&gt;<i> did last - you can keep state across requests.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) If time passes without access, you might delete the long random string 
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> your datastore, rendering the browser's credentials invalid and requiring
</I>&gt;<i> the user to log in again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good points:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) User doesn't have to log in for each page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bad points:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) If someone obtained the long random string, it would be like obtaining
</I>&gt;<i> the user's username and password. Bad person's browser could present the
</I>&gt;<i> long random string...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ways to hijack a session:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Eavesdrop on the user's datastream. By default, all of this is in plain
</I>&gt;<i> text, including the initial sending of the username and password.
</I>&gt;<i> Solution: use HTTPS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Find a way to insert javascript on YOUR website that accesses the 
</I>&gt;<i> cookies
</I>&gt;<i> the user is sending and resends them to BAD_WEBSITE. This is called
</I>&gt;<i> cross-site-scripting, or XSS. Solution: design your website to not echo
</I>&gt;<i> any user input back to the user without sanitizing it. Many, MANY sites
</I>&gt;<i> are vulnerable to this. The only upside is that usually XSS attacks have
</I>&gt;<i> to be customized for the site they are attacking - someone has to want to
</I>&gt;<i> attack YOUR site, not just any site. The motivation for doing so is as
</I>&gt;<i> valuable or as non-valuable as the accounts on your website are (so many 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the vulnerable sites don't really need to care). Read up on XSS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) If your session id's are being maintained in the user's URLs rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;<i> user cookies, an attacked just has to get the user to follow a link to
</I>&gt;<i> BAD_WEBSITE, then the session id will show up in the HTTP_REFERER 
</I>&gt;<i> variable.
</I>&gt;<i> Solution: cookies are much preferred over URL-variable sessions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Hack your server. Solution: Don't let them hack your server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Come along shortly after a user and use the same web browser he did.
</I>&gt;<i> Solution: limit session length, warn users about logging in from public
</I>&gt;<i> workstations, use session cookies that are deleted when the browser is
</I>&gt;<i> closed, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Miscellaneous:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Some people store state info in the cookies themselves, where the user
</I>&gt;<i> can get at and modify them. I prefer storing it serverside. For
</I>&gt;<i> unimportant state info, like a user's choice of language for a site, it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't matter. For important state info, serverside is the only choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) PHP's session info is stored in text files on the server. I prefer
</I>&gt;<i> sessions that are stored in a real database. For small sites, it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> matter. For large sites, database is the only real choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Keep in mind that PHP's built-in session-handling is one implementation
</I>&gt;<i> of the idea of &quot;sessions&quot;, and not necessarily a good one for you. You can
</I>&gt;<i> write a PHP app that does sessions, and does them very well, without using
</I>&gt;<i> any of PHP's session-handling functions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Storing and verifying other info about the user (such as their IP
</I>&gt;<i> address, user-agent string, or what-have-you) is effectively requiring the
</I>&gt;<i> user to present more than just the long random string to validate his
</I>&gt;<i> session. Your sessions will break if you require something to be static
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., IP address) that actually isn't (AOL users behind an array of
</I>&gt;<i> proxies). Also, if the attacker can steal the long random string, he can
</I>&gt;<i> just as well get the browser user-agent, etc. etc.
