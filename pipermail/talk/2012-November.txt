Subject: [nycphp-talk] Amazon MWS
Message-ID: <CAA3pqs+BXb2q3nX1JPAB3avX9=QGrZnKe916DSWsazTzdjy7ig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am working on converting our Amazon API from SOAP which was working until
last week to MWS.
Has anybody done this successfully?  I have my account setup and downloaded
their PHP code samples
but am having trouble and could use some assistance.  Also just found their
Scratchpad site which
is also not working when I put in all my credentials.  What is the SellerId
anyway?  This is not listed
anywhere in their documentation or on their sellercentral site.

Note: Amazon has disconnected their SOAP service as of late last week which
they had announced in
and email that was never forwarded to me.  Doesn't look like they will turn
it on again as I have already
asked.

Any assistance much appreciated.

Nick

I haven't checked out Codeception too much and I haven't fully incorporated
any BDD in php.  But I am very interested in BDD in general.  I think the
Gherkin DSL is nice because it lets project managers or other people that
might be helping to write specs get involved in the tests without needing
to know php (https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin).  I think
the "magic" of it is pretty light.  You still end up writing everything in
code.

I've seen people chatter on github and irc about integrating behat with
lithium -- seemed that they didn't even need to write a plugin for it.

In general though, I've struggled with whether or not to integrate a BDD
framework in php.  We do a lot in javascript, so it seems to make more
sense to drive our bdd tests from the browser using testacular (
http://vojtajina.github.com/testacular/) and jasmine (
http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/).  And leave the php testing to be unit
and integration tests (which are provided out of the box with lithium).

MongoDB works great for storing documents like this altogether in one collection with varying schemas.  It makes it easy to query across all documents. But you could also accomplish something similar with an RDBMS with a table for each type and a search tool like ElasticSearch to index it all in one place. 

I'm not very familiar with Drupal and what it offers for MongoDB.  But the php mongo extension is solid. Doctrine has pretty good MongoDB integration and can be plugged into nearly any project. The Lithium php framework was built with MongoDB in mind first so its models work well with it.

The form doesn't have to be multi-page, meaning it could be a monololithic page, but the page does have to be dynamic in the sense that entire sections will depend on options within the form.  Plus, some options will ideally be treated as 'accordion' type display so that when you focus on element "foo" to enter details for "foo", a number of checkboxes will be revealed, and then that section will collapse again when focus is lost.  Each record is an MLS listing (Residential Real Estate) plus property photos, plus associated documents.

Ultimately there would be ~15 different schemas (3 MLS systems x 5 property classes) with more to come.  Since mapping this data into a common taxonomy has historically been a monumental task [1], I am thinking it would be better to not map it for storage, but rather to create the field mappings in code.  If you've done something like this in Mongo (which is new to me), I'd like to look at it or hear more.

This way views could represent aggregate data across property classes and MLSes.  If you've done something similar in PostgreSQL, I'd like to know more about your implementation.

Howdy Matt -- for your project Wordpress is the best solution, because easy
to hack and fast to develop. Is probably not the most elegant code out
there, but is the best to have the job done! Also in WP other developers
can join the project later, and immediately understand it and hack it.

Avoid custom unless you have time and want to challenge yourself and learn
something new, and even in that case the best solution is to use a
framework, because it doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel, when lot of
functionality are already made and tested.

Keep me updated on the progress of your project,
Federico

Hi Greg,
I did a few in MySql and the challenge is to manage the validation and the
field dependencies, for example the State depends on Country, the group
Shipping Address depend by the flag "Same as billing address", so most of
your work will be on the frontend with jQuery.

I think your best way to go is to keep the configuration in JSON and to
save the data in MongoDB. The flow will be, read the configuration, draw
the form, auto-save draft onblur (so when the user go to the next field).

Here is an example of the configuration:
{ ["Billing Address":[
                             {"name": [{"type":"text"},
{"validate":"required,maxlen=50"}]},
                             {"note": [{"type":"textarea"},
{"validate":"required,maxlen=255"}]},
                             {"country": [{"type":"select"},
{"validate":"required,maxlen=255"}, {"dependency":"country"}]},
..
  ,"Shipping address":
]}

I've created a form generator (
http://www.rainframework.com/User-Guide/Library/Form/), but it only draws
and validate forms, so you'll need to figure how to manage the
dependencies, which you can do with some jQuery animation (show/hide) +
Bassistence plugin (
http://bassistance.de/2012/09/07/release-validation-plugin-1-10-0/, already
included in my Form class).
Hope this help.

Let us know if you create or find the definitive form solution!
Federico

I would also recommend MongoDB for this type of thing - it's a perfect
fit for storing form data, especially quickly.

I'll also take this opportunity for a shameless plug.  I've finally
released the Framewire PHP Framework - http://www.framewire.org/ - to
the public.  It's been in production for years, but just recently
released to the public, as you can see from the site :)  It provides
quick and easy form validation and CRUD with Mongo, while not getting
in the way should more complex things need to be done.

@Hans cool, I'll check Framewire when I got some free time. You should
probably open a new discussion to get feedback.

Take a look at CiviCRM. www.civicrm.org

It is great for handling memberships and donations.

There are versions for Drupal, Joomla and a recently released version of
WordPress. The WP plugin is still under development and does not yet have
all the features as the Joomla and Drupal versions. I have never used Civi
for ecommerce, but it could be used for it.

Thanks - and happy to answer any questions/etc since there's not much
more than an API reference and sample site - though the sample site is
well commented!

And there's a Google group :)

Thanks, I made a couple of updates to the site... though might stick
with the play on words for now :)

I have a need to use a private key within PHP... does anyone have any
recommendations on this?
I looked at http://phpkeystore.com/ but I'm not sure... any thoughts?

Can you give a little more context on what you need to do with the private key?

Is it for securely connecting to a remote site via ssh/sftp?

Or is it to sign or encrypt some data!

Or some other use?

Just encryption and decryption of credentials.

I have used these functions before for encrypting/decrypting with
public/private key pairs:

openssl_get_privatekey()
openssl_get_publickey()
openssl_public_encrypt()
openssl_private_decrypt()

You need to have the openssl module enabled though (compile php using
--with-openssl in the configure arguments).

If this is something you are doing a lot, using a module is going to be
more efficient than php-based functions.

Yeah, that's why I was looking for a module, do you have one that you
prefer?

When you say "encryption and decryption of credentials", what are you
talking about? User credentials? If so, why aren't you hashing them one-way
instead of encrypting them (and therefore making them FAR easier for an
attacker to steal)?

I'm pulling in a file, encrypting and then sending...

Psuedo code:

    function dencrypt($str, $key){
        $str = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $key, $str, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
        $block = mcrypt_get_block_size('des', 'ecb');
        $pad = ord($str[($len = strlen($str))-1]);
        return substr($str, 0, strlen($str) - $pad);       
    }

    //Read in creds file
    $file = "this.txt" // UN=USERNAMEPW=PASSWORD
    //Decrypt password
    $unEncryptedPass = decrypt("PASSWORDFROMFILE", "HARDCODEDSEEDKEY");
   
    //Send username and password to LDAP service directly

What I'm wondering, is, if there is a better way to store the username
and password? So I was thinking of maybe a cert that is
encrypting/unencrypting the file with the un/pw contents...

Hope I've been more clear. :)

Thanks.

So you'd like the file to be encrypted before it's sent or stored somewhere
you can grab it? How are you getting this file? I think this would be a
good use of public key crypto. You can store or publish (or whatever) your
public key either in the code or loaded from a URL. Encrypt the file using
this public key, and then you are in a good position to read the file.

Most cert usage is not for encryption per se, but for key exchange (which
is then used for encryption) so a normal SSL cert isn't going to help here
much. You could make your own cert, but at that point screw it since it
lacks the authority of a CA chain which is what makes a cert a cert. If you
really need to encrypt a plaintext file, just encrypt the whole thing, and
not parts of it, using GPG. Call the gpg command from a shell execute in
php and supply your public key (as above).

Still not sure what you're inputs and outputs are. How is this file
encrypted in the first place. Maybe you could just gather the credentials
and update LDAP directly, skipping any storage on disk. I might have a copy
of a ruby program I did to do this. It was a web form. I then had to write
it in perl, so I'm sure you could port it to php without much hassle.
