Subject: [nycphp-talk] Seeking Contract Work
Message-ID: <CABActuCv0QUWb0o3dfv5QgpSyx1+isAYCB7jpvNskr9Ysvhgjw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I currently have about 10-15 hours free per week and I am looking to fill
that with some PHP contract work.  If you have any work that could fill
those hours please feel free to get back to me.

I have been working with PHP/MySQL since 1997 and can provide my resume at
your request.
