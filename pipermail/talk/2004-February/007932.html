Yes, in both HTML and XML single and double quotes have both been 
allowed since the dawn of time (basically because both are allowed in 
SGML).  My comment was meant in a broader sense in that it is not as 
simple as saying the a particular thing is 'valid HTML' as the language 
has evolved and what was valid HTML 3.2 may not be valid HTML 4.0, etc.

&gt;<i> I probably first learned the formal description of HTML by looking at

Indeed, on this particular issue as long as you use a form of quoting 
you should be safe in terms of adhering to the standard.  The major 
reason I tend to use double-quotes is that it makes it easier to include 
quotes within attributes.

In XML you can use the &amp;apos; entity reference to include a literal 
single-quote (apostrophe) within a single-quoted string, however I 
cannot find any reference to this character being supported in any 
flavour of HTML, so you have to use &amp;#39; to ensure that it is 
interpreted correctly by all browsers.

In contrast the &amp;quot; entity reference has been included in both HTML 
and XML specs since at least HTML 2.0 
(&lt;<A HREF="http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/rfc1866.txt">http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/rfc1866.txt</A>&gt; Section 9.7.1). 
This is supported by all known browsers and thus if double-quotes are 
used as the quote characters you can use a literal single-quote 
(apostrophe) or the &amp;quot; entity reference to represent any required 
quotes in a somewhat readable manner.

I don't want to start a holy war over this, and agree that both 
notations are equally valid, I just think that this has turned into a 
rather interesting discussion.
