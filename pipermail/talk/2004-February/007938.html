Yes Adam, I am not attacking your statement, but merely commenting that 
this *type* of question can become complicated when dealing with the 
different versions of HTML.

&gt;&gt;<i>Indeed, on this particular issue as long as you use a form of quoting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you should be safe in terms of adhering to the standard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is exactly the *opposite* of what I was claiming. I *know* the

</I>&gt;<i> quotation marks. However, since when has it been safe to rely upon
</I>&gt;<i> browsers to correctly implement the HTML standards?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point is that *I don't trust* browsers to actually respect single

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Based on James' comments, however, it's probably safe to start using

</I>
I understand your point, which was why my statement was put in terms of 
conformance to the HTML standard, the issue of browser support is 
completely separate.  I am deliberately not commenting on that issue 
because personally I have never used single-quoted attribute values in 
any HTML or XML document.

What I was interested in was other possible reasons people had for 
choosing one quoting method over the other.
