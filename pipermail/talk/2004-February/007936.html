Normally I would have specficied a DOCTYPE to go along with my
statement, but since single and double quotes are valid in ALL versions
of HTML, I didn't bother to qualify my claim.

&gt;<i> Indeed, on this particular issue as long as you use a form of quoting

</I>
This is exactly the *opposite* of what I was claiming. I *know* the
standard has (and probably always will) allow me to use either form of
quotation marks. However, since when has it been safe to rely upon
browsers to correctly implement the HTML standards?

My point is that *I don't trust* browsers to actually respect single
quotes as correct *even though it's in the standard.* I'm sure that
I've been burned by this before, but I just can't remember if it was
by some random user-agent back in 1995 that only runs on Mac OS 7.1. :)

Based on James' comments, however, it's probably safe to start using
them again.
