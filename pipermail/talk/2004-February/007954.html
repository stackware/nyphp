<PRE>I've been &quot;trying&quot; to cross over, or at least start writing OO code, for a
long time, but I never can seem to fully catch on.
I am pretty sure I could identify many instances where my code would
benefit from OO, and I've been told that my procedural code is written in
OO format, just without the use of objects.

This may be near impossible to answer, but, what would you say is the key
to &quot;grasp the concepts behind OO&quot; and to put it to use?

I suppose if I forced myself to use it, I would probably figure it out,
and I always feel a little &quot;learning-disabled&quot; for not having picked it up
yet, even after some tutorials, etc, but then Felix comes along and makes
me feel better about it...

Felix said:
&quot;For most simple web based stuff you will almost never need to code
objects yourself.&quot;




&gt;<i> I think it is more than possible, though personally I prefer PHP to
</I>&gt;<i> Java, and for anything web-related I would almost certainly use PHP
</I>&gt;<i> rather than Java, purely because it is so flexible and easy to use.  As
</I>&gt;<i> for crossing over into OO, just take things one step at a time, once you
</I>&gt;<i> grasp the concepts behind OO you will see plenty of situations where you
</I>&gt;<i> could use OO design methods.  For example there are countless situations
</I>&gt;<i> where you can encapsulate functionality into a generic object, then use
</I>&gt;<i> inheritance to specialise that object for your particular needs.
</I>
