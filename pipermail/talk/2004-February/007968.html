<PRE>Brent,

There's nothing wrong with bright light and angelic music, as long as 
you can have a beer too.

My biggest complaint about the &quot;technology&quot; world is the great effort 
done by almost everyone to make things more obscure than they really are.

My description of OO is necessarily simplified.  When you've written a 
handful of classes you'll be ready for the next conceptual step.  It's 
not a conceptual leap.  But for now don't worry about it.   After you've 
refactored a class a couple times you get that elusive bright light, and 
all these weird OO concepts will start naturally, effortlessly making 
sense.  You'll get there, so enjoy the path, drink a beer, write some code.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Heh.  You sound like where I have been. I spent a bunch of time 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to figure out OO, making myself crazy. Then it dawned on me 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I hadn't had a need that OO would solve.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Most of my code used functions.   Most of my code used the same 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functions. So I started moving the functions into an included file. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then I had two files; one a bunch of functions, and then the code 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file. Then I started organizing the functions into different included 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files. So I had 6 or so possible files and one code file. Then it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dawned on me that I was creating the effect of OO. So I rewrote the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files that contained the functions, so each file became a single 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> class, with a collection of methods instead of a single file with a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collection of functions.  (note, as far as I can tell there's no real 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference between a method and a function in php)  I had to go 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through and change some stuff, like using $this-&gt; all over the place. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I was done I had a bunch of different classes that were a bit 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> harder to use than the different include files.  After grumbling for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a while, someone suggested creating a single error handling method 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that all the methods within a class would use. So now each class has 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integrated error handling (error reporting), instead of every method. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then I could add in things like a timer, debugging information.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Refactoring the code across all the class-methods is easier than if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they're just functions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> procedural -&gt; OO is pointless unless:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.  it makes it easier to maintain the code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.  it makes it easier to improve the code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.  it makes it easier to debug the code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4.  it makes it easier to pick up girls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5.  it makes it easier to show off at the users group (see #5)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Almost all the documentation about OO complicates the issue.  It's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really not that difficult.  If you're not understanding it, it's not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because you're missing the OO bone/gene/hair.  It's because whoever 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is explaining it to you doesn't understand it well enough to explain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Relax, drink a beer.  It's not that complex.  If you're thinking hard 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about OO, you're doing the wrong thinking.  Save your hard thinking 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to solve the problem.  Once you've groked the problem the OO stuff 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will flow easily.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Where to start:  take any single function and convert it to a class:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function print_array($array)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    print_r($array);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> class print_array
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    function print_array($array)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       print_r($array);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Both produce the same output.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hopefully this is clear and helpful.  Rather than obscure and annoying.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This may be near impossible to answer, but, what would you say is

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think it is more than possible, though personally I prefer PHP to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Java, and for anything web-related I would almost certainly use PHP
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rather than Java, purely because it is so flexible and easy to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use.  As
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for crossing over into OO, just take things one step at a time, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> once you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> grasp the concepts behind OO you will see plenty of situations 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> where you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could use OO design methods.  For example there are countless 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> situations
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> where you can encapsulate functionality into a generic object, then 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inheritance to specialise that object for your particular needs.
