Great!  Though why you would need separate SQL for the 2 versions of 
MySQL is still something of a mystery to me, what exactly are you trying 
to do that would cause problems with 3.23.x?

&gt;<i> Sorry, but I don't understand the term &quot;atomic&quot; in this case.
</I>
What I mean by 'atomic' is that the operation should (theoretically) be 
a single indivisible operation.  Unfortunately this is a dream which is 
almost always unattainable.

What transactions do is to try and 'fake' this by letting you either 
commit or rollback the entire transaction as one unit, effectively 
turning your sequence of SQL commands into a single entity.

On a side note, you can easily implement transaction support in your 
existing code (as well as support multiple databases) if you use the 
ADOdb database abstraction layer (I'm sure PEAR::DB can do it to, but I 
use ADOdb).  Using these systems you can write code which will take 
advantage of transaction support if it is available, but still work on 
databases which do not support transactions.

&gt;<i> At the PHP conference in New York last spring I remember someone asked
</I>&gt;<i> Rasmus a question: which is more expensive, accessing a=20
</I>&gt;<i> global or defining
</I>&gt;<i> a constant? He said without hesitation &quot;defining a constant.&quot;=20
</I>&gt;<i> There was
</I>&gt;<i> silence for a couple beats, then on to the next question.
</I>
At that same conference I chatted with Zeev about this issue, too.  He
concured, and said that defining a constant is more expensive than
setting a variable.

However, somehow I knew he wasn't telling the whole story, so I asked
why... and why would anyone want a constant, aside from being static and
globally scoped.

He said that using constants, once defined, are less expensive than
variables.  So I said... &quot;hah, thought you'd say something like that...&quot;
:<i>)
