I don't understand why this happens ...

Fatal error: Call to undefined function phpinfo() in
/home/php/php-5.1.6/sapi/cli/test.php on line 4

 

System type: SuSE linux 7.0

All versions of 4 compile fine so does 5.0.5 comes out fine...but...

All versions higher produce a library/binary with missing functions,
functions like phpinfo, print_r, date, even var_dump

 

I used the "nm" tool to see if the symbol(s) are present.

For phpinfo, it finds ...

08392de0 B phpinfo_logo_hash

081ab9f0 T register_phpinfo_constants

081abb70 T zif_phpinfo

Which is the same data dumped from a "healthy" version of PHP binary.

 

Have a great weekend!

What configure options are you passing? Also, those functions are all in 
the phpsrc/ext/standard/ extension, perhaps for some strange reason 
that's not making it into your build process.

I've noticed differences in "paths" with PHP5. 

With files that were found in PHP4 I am required to be more
exact in
locating them with PHP5.

Message-ID: <4b1887110609040646y2ced2ccah8e405caa2d5a3647@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone know of a nice efficient function to convert this?
$name = 'Tony D\x27Antonio';

I realize that putting it in double quote will do it, but I am unable
to do that. As I am doing something like this:

$data - file_get_contents($some_remote_https_url);
$pieces = explode(',', data);
print $pieces[0];

Output:
Tony D\x27Antonio

This doesn't seem to help:
print "$pieces[0]";

I'm looking for the most efficient way, as this is being used in a
REST response parser. Thanks!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] To Smarty Or Not to Smarty: That Is The Question
Message-ID: <455.563a2a9.322e1929@aol.com>

TO SMARTY OR NOT TO SMARTY: THAT IS THE QUESTION
 
A client of mine is debating, rather furiously, the merits of using Smarty  
in their upcoming web-applications.  Up to this point, I have not used  Smarty 
- and I will admit it - I am an old school programmer who hates OOP, and  to 
me, Smarty looks like another ill-conceived paradigm developed  in OOP that 
creates a lot more hassle than it solves.  
 
We are a small organization.  We do not have more than two PHP  developers 
working on a project at a time.  Our designer works closely with  us to 
integrate CSS, Javascript, etc.  The web sites we create are for  government agencies 
and do not change often, and if they do change, they do not  change very much.
 
I understand the concept behind smarty - separate logic and display.   
However, I do not think Smarty is an end-all solution to all web sites - as many  
people are trying to sell it.  This article, Smarty for Dummies, shares  many of 
the thoughts and opinions I have about Smarty: 
_http://www.fudnik.com/main/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=7_ 
(http://www.fudnik.com/main/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=7)  -  it is a good read.
 
Can anyone give any guidance about when to and when not to use  Smarty?  Does 
anyone agree/disagree that Smarty may just be a giant  abstraction of logic 
and design, wrapped in a horrible OOP mess?  Does  anyone agree/disagree that 
using Smarty in small applications, that do not  change much, and do not have 
separate (or large) development teams may be more  burdensome than it is worth? 
 Is anyone concerned that using Smarty as part  of your systems make them 
less portable?  Am I missing something, or is  Smarty just not meant to be used 
in small development environments?
 
I do not like the idea of developing web apps using Smarty because of  the 
additional requirements of installing smarty.  I am also concerned  that Smarty 
may be built upon technologies that may be part of a current patent  or part 
of a patent that is pending.  Smarty is not that old, and it  could potentially 
infringe a patent by another company like MS.   I  also do not know if Smarty 
is supported in the open-source community as well as  PHP and MySQL.  
 
I also cannot stand the editing of multiple documents, both containing bits  
and pieces of logic - I know, one is application logic, the other is display  
logic.... is this really logical?  Bouncing between documents does not seem  
efficient, and it also seems quite possible that a web designer could still  
screw up the display logic.... hmmm... 
 
Whether you would still call Smarty a new paradigm is up for  question.  
However, I am having a hard time understanding any benefit for  small 
sites/organization who need to deliver SOLID solutions fast, on-time, and  within budget.  
Can anyone tell me how Smarty can increase  productivity?  Can it save time?  
Can it save money?  Does it  make your web-app any more secure? Doesn't it 
actually make your applications  slower - all that code to process - and I know, 
it does the pre-processing - but  still, OOP requires more code that 
procedural any day - and looking at Smarty  code, it looks like a OOP mess.  
 
Like OOP, I can do everything Smarty does, faster and easier in procedural  
PHP on one page.  Why in the world would I change to Smarty?  
 
It is also interesting to note that very few open-source applications  use 
Smarty.  PHPBB does not use it, OSCommerce does not use it, PHPMyAdmin  does not 
use it, etc.  If Smarty were so good, why haven't more open-source  projects 
adopted it?
 
Any information that could assist my reasoning, one way or the other, would  
be greatly appreciated!
 
Thank you in advance!
Lee

I've worked a little bit with smarty and I've had some discussions 
online. The one thing that it all comes back to is this:

If your template designers are not php developers then using smarty as 
an interface that the designers can use might make some sense. If the 
guys doing the php are also doing the designing then I would suggest you 
take a peek at something like Savant or other php based solution.

I'm not sure how to modify PHPBB to do what you want it to, but you might try installing a "site map" plugin to make your forum easily crawlable.

I use one here:

I'm a bit OOP guy and I still think that I don't need Smarty or any 
other template system for developing applications with (X)HTML front 
end. I haven't yet seen a template system that has the power to turn 
the application to some non-HTTP/HTML based frontend easily. And if 
such template system needs JavaScript for the "HTML" front end, I'm 
not interested.

The reason I think that one shouldn't need a template system is that 
(X)HTML is supposed to be only about the structure and semantics. If 
you don't whip up a <table> element for layout the UI guys don't 
need to modify the (X)HTML source. They just touch the CSS file.

Granted, you may have to give up some designs if you want to stay 
compatible with MSIE 6.0 but in the long run, I believe that using 
(X)HTML for what it's supposed to be is the correct way. (X)HTML is 
a HyperText Markup Language. It's not a Page Layout Description 
Language and Styling Language. If you want the layout the designer 
drew you should be using formats suchs as PostScript, PDF or SVG.

As a side effect, the applications that I've been writing do work 
with mobile phones with 120x120 pixel displays. Show me a page with 
table layout for such a display without writing any custom markup 
for the mobile device.

I have to say that there are other advantages of using a template 
system. I mean do you really want to hand type every <select 
name=""><option>...?

I also make sure any data passed into the template system is escaped on 
output. This helps prevent some nasty little surprises from time to time.

Personally, I like the template system approach. I have builders that 
perform my logic. They use my objects to fetch the list of user accounts 
from the database, for instance. Then I assign that list to the template 
system. The data is now available for output. I can then create numerous 
templates that use that same data for various types of output. One 
builder might power 5 different template views and I only have to update 
that one builder if some logic changes and all 5 templates are up to 
date. I don't so how you go about that type of flexibility without a 
template system of some sort. Care to share some info on how you use 
straight style sheets to get your output going?

I have used smarty and the real questions are

1.) will the site layout change at all?
2.) will the designer also be a php developer?

I have noticed that when you go with a site which is all PHP and not using a
template engine, if you want to change the layout you are going to be there
forever.
If you had a template system it would be as easy as swapping out the html.

If your designer will be making the design changes and they do not know php,
go with smarty, however if they know PHP, and you dont anticipate the layout
to change, dont use smarty.  However if you dont anticipate any changes, you
are probably in the wrong field :D

There are always changes when it comes to web development :)

I see. I guess that works well, if it's okay to fetch all the data 
from database and display only some of it. I'd be a little afraid 
that in large scale that puts quite some unnecessary extra work for 
the both database server and the PHP engine.

If you have user account info and you just want to display it, you 
should first think what kind of semantic structure does this data 
have? If you have a list of users each of which have multiple 
fields, then it sounds to me that your logical structure is a table.

So logically it's like this:

UID	Name	Foobar
1	John	"apple"
12	Mary	7

Semantic markup for this would look like

<table class="$class">
<tr><th>UID</th><th>Name</th><th>Foobar</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>John</td><td>"apple"</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Mary</td><td>7</td></tr>
</table>

The only thing you need to change for different rendering of the 
above data is to set $class variable to another value. I don't 
understand how many different ways there could be to encode that 
same information in XHTML. Therefore, I don't understand the need 
for templating engine to generate/modify that part of the source. To 
me, the only question is what solution has the best performance? A 
template engine is seldom the correct answer.

Then you just write CSS file that specifies the rendering. It could 
be pretty much anything, except that with MSIE6/win32 you cannot 
say, for example, stuff like

table.special { display: block; }

because MSIE6/win32 will always behave as if an element called 
"table" had hardcoded CSS property "display: table".

That's where the problems start. That's the reason you might want to 
use a template engine. If you're not happy with the hardcoded 
rendering the MSIE6/win32 has for your markup you have to *change 
your semantic markup* to match the intended rendering instead of 
intended meaning! Another reason could be that your layout guys 
don't understand CSS and use HTML for layout instead.

I believe that to change the semantics of your data (the HTML 
markup) you *have* to modify the code/logic also. I don't see the 
advantage of separating those.

In-Reply-To: <455.563a2a9.322e1929@aol.com>
Message-ID: <001601c6d0f3$73fbf400$6401a8c0@Rubicon>

I've never used Smarty for a project, but I've examined many opensource
projects that are structured to 
one degree or another on the separation of design and business logic
principles of a template system like Smarty.
 
I have found that every new project/system (new to you the developer(s)) has
a learning curve. Minimum one-day 
as much as 5 days to understand the configuration techniques and the custom
functions/tools/techniques that 
are in place. 
 
I believe that the very high degree of abstraction provided by a template
system like Smarty can be invaluable in 
any known development environment that truly separates the non-programmer
designer(s) from the 
non-designing programmer(s)
 
But, maybe I've led a sheltered life, but every time I've worked in the web
unit of a corporate environment, large and small, 
everyone even the 'designers' was pretty much a programmer in the code
language(s) and OS in use in the company. 
Typically, also the company has long ago found that no matter what original
system/tools were developed/purchased that 
there is constant need for advanced customization/features and they are knee
deep in proprietary systems and 
in-house techniques that give the company competitively unique advantages on
the web.
 
I thought also the job demands of the IT industry today pretty much demand
that you be a programmer/designer 
and there really are no jobs for strictly non-programming designers.
 
I rather like that direction, as I believe that the skill set and the
diversity that multifaceted designer/programmers bring to the table 
is far more valuable to a fast-moving tech company than multiple teams of
highly segregated niche designers and 
programmers that only pow wow once per week in a two-hour antsy session.
 
So, therefore, roughly on principle I would tend to lead clients towards
free or low-cost, high-powered specialized 
opensource projects intended for their business category (projects like
PHProjekt, osCommerce, Gallery, Coppermine, 
Open-Realty,  Joomla) that bring so many great features to the table. And
then you as the versatile, sophisticated 
developer team can dive in and customize the front end rather handily and
create/designate your own custom only 
as-needed design option injection points. 
 
So you don't sell future design flexibility to the client but instead sell
them the far more sensible and satisfying infinitely 
expandable feature set(s) and advise them they shouldn't be changing their
web site look any sooner than every 
five years anyway, so changeable design in templates is not the big issue.
 
I believe you will find very few places where you can fit a Smarty system
into a complex highly-competitive business/web 
development environment that is itself setting new standards on the web
everyday.
 
But, Smarty is a great project and great idea and the convenience to
complexity ratio may need some tweaking.

TO SMARTY OR NOT TO SMARTY: THAT IS THE QUESTION
 
A client of mine is debating, rather furiously, the merits of using Smarty
in their upcoming web-applications.  Up to this point, I have not used
Smarty - and I will admit it - I am an old school programmer who hates OOP,
and to me, Smarty looks like another ill-conceived paradigm developed in OOP
that creates a lot more hassle than it solves.  
 
We are a small organization.  We do not have more than two PHP developers
working on a project at a time.  Our designer works closely with us to
integrate CSS, Javascript, etc.  The web sites we create are for government
agencies and do not change often, and if they do change, they do not change
very much.
 
I understand the concept behind smarty - separate logic and display.
However, I do not think Smarty is an end-all solution to all web sites - as
many people are trying to sell it.  This article, Smarty for Dummies, shares
many of the thoughts and opinions I have about Smarty:
http://www.fudnik.com/main/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=7 - it is a good
read.
 
Can anyone give any guidance about when to and when not to use Smarty?  Does
anyone agree/disagree that Smarty may just be a giant abstraction of logic
and design, wrapped in a horrible OOP mess?  Does anyone agree/disagree that
using Smarty in small applications, that do not change much, and do not have
separate (or large) development teams may be more burdensome than it is
worth?  Is anyone concerned that using Smarty as part of your systems make
them less portable?  Am I missing something, or is Smarty just not meant to
be used in small development environments?
 
I do not like the idea of developing web apps using Smarty because of the
additional requirements of installing smarty.  I am also concerned that
Smarty may be built upon technologies that may be part of a current patent
or part of a patent that is pending.  Smarty is not that old, and it could
potentially infringe a patent by another company like MS.   I also do not
know if Smarty is supported in the open-source community as well as PHP and
MySQL.  
 
I also cannot stand the editing of multiple documents, both containing bits
and pieces of logic - I know, one is application logic, the other is display
logic.... is this really logical?  Bouncing between documents does not seem
efficient, and it also seems quite possible that a web designer could still
screw up the display logic.... hmmm... 
 
Whether you would still call Smarty a new paradigm is up for question.
However, I am having a hard time understanding any benefit for small
sites/organization who need to deliver SOLID solutions fast, on-time, and
within budget.  Can anyone tell me how Smarty can increase productivity?
Can it save time?  Can it save money?  Does it make your web-app any more
secure? Doesn't it actually make your applications slower - all that code to
process - and I know, it does the pre-processing - but still, OOP requires
more code that procedural any day - and looking at Smarty code, it looks
like a OOP mess.  
 
Like OOP, I can do everything Smarty does, faster and easier in procedural
PHP on one page.  Why in the world would I change to Smarty?  
 
It is also interesting to note that very few open-source applications use
Smarty.  PHPBB does not use it, OSCommerce does not use it, PHPMyAdmin does
not use it, etc.  If Smarty were so good, why haven't more open-source
projects adopted it?
 
Any information that could assist my reasoning, one way or the other, would
be greatly appreciated!
 
Thank you in advance!
Lee

Joseph seems to be implying that you can't separate logic from 
display unless you use a templating system.  In my opinion, all it 
takes is discipline to separate your display code from your logic.

Put another way:  PHP already is a glorified templating language, 
basically, with a bunch of other stuff added in.  Using smarty or 
constructing your own equivalent system just seems redundant and 
inefficient to me.

I fail to see how {%var_name%} is any simpler for a non-coder to 
learn than <?php echo $var_name; ?>  They are both arcane, silly 
statements that one must commit to memory.

The only real advantage I can see to something like smarty is one of 
security...then your front end coder is essentially blocked from 
using functions you might not want them using, since they can only do 
the things which the templating system allows.

Then again, if you have the coders just learn simple PHP statements, 
rather than silly arcane codes, you are actually teaching them 
something useful in the process, and I find that most coders I am 
paying money to don't seem to want to maliciously undermine my 
projects by doing stuff I don't want them doing.

So, I say: absolutely take advantage of the idea that something like 
smarty gives you, because separating all your data access / massaging 
from your data display is really smart.

But using smarty itself?  I dunno...it's really up to your personal 
preference.  I think it's a waste of time.

Did you figure this one out?

Try

$data - file_get_contents($some_remote_https_url);
$pieces = explode(',', data);
print preg_replace("/(\\\x[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,2})/e", "chr(hexdec('\\1'))", $pieces[0]);

Seems to do the trick.

By going OO you DRAMATICALLY improve the understanding of the
underlying logic that defines the outputs from your source code.

Give OO a second look, it will greatly improve the intellectual
content of your end product.  IMHO.

No, I don't use Smarty, I have a pretty big library of class's that I
just hook together as needed, seems to do it all for me.

I use Smarty extensively, but mostly as part of my ad-hoc framwork for
rapid development, along with DB_DataObject. 

I wrote a little subclass of PEAR's DB_DataObject that I call
DB_DataObject_renderable

The subclass provides two new methods to DataObject: 
render($tpl,$extra=array) and renderlist($tpl,$extra=array).

render() (sometimes) pulls in related table via getLink() or getLinks(),
assigns object variables, plus the contents of the $extra hash, into
smarty, and then returns the result of Smarty->fetch($tpl).

renderlist() iterates over $this->fetch() (where this is essentially a
DB_DataObject), concatinating the result of
$this->render($tpl."_listitem.tpl") into a string, then passes that as
$extra['listContent'] into $this->render($tpl.".tpl"). 

Keeping with DB_DataObject's convention of an object being both a
"current record" and a "record set", and with all the handy getLinks
stuff, which is nice for pulling in lookup-table stuff, you have a nice
way of rendering either a record or set of them.

For clarity's sake, if I want to show a form, I might have a template
called "form.tpl".  If I want a table of records, I might have a
template called 'adminlist.tpl', and one called 'adminlist_listitem.tpl'. 

'adminlist_listitem.tpl' might look like:

<tr><td>{$id}</td><td>{$name}</td><td><a
href="edit.php?id={$id}">edit</a></td></tr>

'adminlist.tpl' might look like:

<table class="someClass">
<tr><th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>*</th></tr>
{$listContent}
</table>

While this example is trivial, the pattern scales well to various
things.  And if you need even more "extra" data, it's easy to override
the render() function in the class files autogenerated by DB_DataObject
to pull in the ... weird ... stuff.

Rob,

I ended up doing this:

$response = str_replace('\x', '%', $response);
$response = urldecode($response);

That did the trick. :-)

The curious thing is that Smarty syntax, IMHO, is not any easier than PHP.
The way you loop over arrays -- e.g., with "section", which come to think
of it is a weird name for it -- is unintuitive enough to make me have to
check the docs again every time.

<?php foreach: ?> et cetera <?php endforeach; ?>

seems simpler.

I used to be a big Smarty fan but coming under the spell of CakePHP and
seeing the intelligent way it uses/wants you to use good old PHP for
building views, my love of Smarty has cooled off.

I currently use Smarty on a couple projects.  I didn't make the 
decision... but I certainly don't mind using it.  We created a theme 
system so that there's a folder with a default set of Smarty 
templates... but for each different site we run off the same backend 
install, we can specify a different theme folder and our view will look 
there first to get the template and then go to the default folder if it 
doesn't find it.  This allows us to run sites that can have extra copy 
in the templates or pieces removed or whatever we want and none of the 
main set of code needs to change.  Smarty has an easy to use caching 
system and I like using the variable modifiers to do things like 
truncate text, capitalize strings, and format dates.  Also the custom 
plugins can be pretty handy... we have one that iterates through a adodb 
record set.  We had an html production guy come in to do some work and 
he had no problem using the Smarty templates.

Obviously there are tons of templating systems out there and I see the 
point about a compiled template system vs. one that's already in php.  
Personally, I don't find all the <?php ?>'s to be asthetically 
pleasing... but that's a sorry excuse =)

On the note of OO vs. procedural, after switching to OO-style php two or 
three years ago, it's hard to imagine now not having at least the 
encapsulation and reuse that comes with it.  I agree that for small 
sites, procedural code can be written faster... but if it's something 
you'll reuse on other projects or if you're on a team of developers, 
there are major benefits of using OO code.  It might seem to be a big 
pain to be switching files all the time, but a good editor will make 
that easy for you.  The whole idea is to reduce the amount of code you 
have to write and make it easier to incorporate other people's code into 
your project.  The term that keeps popping in my head is "Set it and 
forget it."  Anyway... this subject has been beaten to death.

That's pretty slick!  However, if you have any plus signs (+) in your 
string, they'll get converted to a space.  Not sure if there are any 
other unintended side effects.  Not exactly sure if it performs better 
or not to do it your way...  But anyway, thanks for sharing.  That's a 
clever solution.

Ha, If I would have _read_ the whole thread, I would have seen that
'\x27' is exactly what you were trying to work with.  Sorry, it's just
that 'urldecode' is one of the _dangerous_ functions that I watch for
when auditing code and it jumped out at me in your earlier post.

Rob: 

I believe that your comments revealed compelling reasons to go a Smarty-type

template route.

Using a Smarty-type support template support structure to create:
i) several different looking sites all driven efficiently by the same data,
and 
ii) gain performance by caching page(s) and/or data 
...seems more like true genuine good reasons to use a Smarty than to solely 
go a Smarty-type route just so that designers can tweak the colors 
of tables as the months go by.

Additionally, I wanted to clarify here in the context of my previous Smarty
remarks.

I advocate OO techniques for small or large projects, in the long run 
OO techniques will return coding organizational and maintenance ease and 
accuracy that every organization will benefit from. Though, yes, this OO
issue 
has been beaten to death, I think in the scope of this list that promoting 
OO again is quite alright. Much like how by necessity the don't drink and
drive 
message is never curtailed.

Smarty *type*, perhaps, but not Smarty.  ;-)

Easily do-able with something like Savant, Zend_View, or Solar_View,  
all using PHP as the "template" markup, and which provide directory  
fallbacks and on-demand helpers.  (Fully object-oriented helpers,  
BTW, not functions.)

Also easily do-able with PEAR Cache_Lite, Zend_Cache, or Solar_Cache.

Er, agreed that just tweaking colors isn't a good-enough reason to

If David Mintz switching from Smarty to Cake is not a call for a Symfony

I'm just hoping everybody won't be too burned out on frameworks by the 
time we show off our Andromeda system in October.  Delving into deeply 
shameless self-promotion, I'll mention that I've done frameworks in 
older architectures and can show some really mature features.  Now back 
to our regularly scheduled discussion....

Oh no! You seem to be saying Symfony is better, so off I go to
http://www.symfony-project.com/ and start sniffing at it... just what I
need, another crisis of faith. To continue learning to bake, or try to
become a composer instead?

Seriously, they both look like they have their strengths and weaknesses.
Cake seems a little rough-edged and the documentation is uneven, but it
doesn't make you write a lot of YAML.

Yes, David, maybe Symfony is better (nudge nudge) and maybe cleaner 
(nudge), or easier to follow without docs (nudge nudge) or perhaps the 
docs are more complete. I can't *tell* you these things with mere words; 
you need to *experence* them (nudge nudge) in order to fully appreciate 
the symfony/cake comparisons (nudge nudge). Oh, and be sure to report 
back to the talk list, ok?   ;-)

Well, it *looks* (emphasis because I haven't actually tried) as though
it's a PITA if not impossible to install Symfony in a subdir of a shared
hosting account. And that's a potential deal breaker for the project I
have to do.

inforequest: I thought you were a big Rails fan and Rails is so big on
convention over configuration, and Cake is very much in that -- tradition?
whatever -- whereas Symfony, it appears, makes you write or at least
edit reams of YAML. I know, I gotta experience it (nudge nudge).

Anyway, now I am persuing Solar, just to placate the shameless
self-promoters around here (-:

another framework which is quite power is PRADO.

I've been using it for couple of moths, and I gotta tell you that's
something :) You might want to check it out as well :))

Me? A Rails fan? Far from it. Are you one of those racist New Yorkers, 
calling me a Rails fan just because I'm in Seattle? Geesh.

Having spent ages looking at all these several months ago, to save 
bandwidth, I have a list:

Symfony
CakePHP
Seagull (seagullproject.org)
Prado
SolarPHP
Cerebral Cortex (crtx.org)
Savant (phpsavant.com)

(My list is bigger but I left out Perl/Python/Ruby frameworks ;-)

Message-ID: <000401c6d2ca$430e1160$8101a8c0@HirschLaptop>

I'm working on a simple multi-page shopping cart. Any thoughts on the
merits of hidden variables versus session variables for moving between
pages. I don't want to use a hidden variable for a CC #, unless ever
page is secure. Even than, it seems like a poor idea. And I am
interested in minimizing the session load, which translates to extra DB
load. Thoughts?

Much as I appreciate the plug, Savant is more a template/presentation- 
logic system than a framework.

In my experience, storing/passing all variables via server-side sessions 
with a mysql based session handler simplifies many things.

I'm admittedly not so well-versed on security issues, but why not hash the CC# (with crypt() or something similar) and store it in sql temporarily? You could store the corresponding sql key id in the session.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Cake v. Symfony
In-Reply-To: <8F794CE1-13E4-4735-A6C8-7A32BC2B23B0@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <002c01c6d2e8$e7f77e00$6401a8c0@Rubicon>

Whether one examines fairly generic concepts like Joomla, phpNuke,
dotProject or TYPO3. Or one looks at the generic frameworks. 
Or one looks at the sourceforge.net collection of tools and projects. It
might be proper to observe that there is 
quite sufficient baseline "generic" PHP product out there. 

And that these worldwide, many years long collective collaborations were
likely originally engendered predominantly to propel 
PHP development from 0 - 60, causing PHP to rapidly appear as a competitive,
diverse, solutions-oriented code framework when 
compared to JAVA and ASP. 

Maybe these PHP projects have achieved what was originally needed to
basically propel PHP to an IT takes note status. 

Now it may be time for new talents to focus on the next evolutionary
competitive step and that would be to tie together, maximize, enhance and
compound all these "generic" projects and spin them into very rich, full
package commercial enterprise-wide solutions with a bit more out of the box
readiness to meet the expectations of known market segments that need and
buy full scale (verily even expensive and satisfyingly profitable) web
application solutions.

Might there not be a business case that shows the there is sufficient
competitive cause now -- that PHP developers need -- more access to free or
low-cost well done projects that really answer contemporary commercial
business needs. 

No collective of developers needs to hold back anymore and think: "Well, if
we want to create a successful project that is going to get used a lot, we
need to make this non-specific grey box set of features and functions for a
hypothetical vast generic market of scientifically precise programmers to
use." To the contrary, the collective of developers should now be thinking:
"What are some of the present day ripe business categories that have
exploded onto the internet and PHP developers could use targeted, base code
projects that meet the needs of an ever expanding, feature hungry mass of
potential PHP customers who are right now paying way too much to other
programmer/code languages." 

New PHP projects really need to cohesively, convincingly and accurately do
modern expected things that most customers are now desiring as a matter of
course, such as: streaming media, perform bulk emails, collect and create
RSS, encrypt cookies/session, registration/login/preferences, meeting
calendar, customer inquiries center, FAQ, online chat/IM, help desk/trouble
ticket, mapping, weather, and even interface with bar codes. 

PHP could use to take and grow market share in all the following business
segments:

Chamber of Commerce 
Convention Center 
Visitor's Bureau 
Supermarkets 
Television Station 
Automobile Dealership 
Yacht Dealership 
Cruise Line 
Venture Capital Firm 
Museum 
Resort / Resort Chain 
Hotel / Hotel Chain 
Movie Theatre Chain 
Performing Arts Center 
Dance Troupe 
Theatre Ensemble 
Circus 
National Park 
Day School Site 
Grade School / High School Site 
Real Estate Agency 
Real Estate Residential Developer 
Real Estate Commercial Developer 
Accounting Firm 
Law Firm 
Politician 
Political Group 
Fundraiser 
Trucking Firm 
Tanker Firm 
Police Department 
Fire Department 
Art Gallery Chain 

Even bigger and more ambitious: 
News Site with multimedia 
Weather Service 
Traffic Site 
Media Download Site 
Software Download Site 
Photo Sharing Site 
Train Scheduler 
Web Cam Viewer Site 
Expedition Chronicler 
Digital Movie Download Site

If I am off base and you know a full featured opensource project that fills
the gap in the above business segments, just list them and everyone will be
helped by what might otherwise be interpreted as shameless PHP project
publicity.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP and MySQL projects to include in a portfolio.
Message-ID: <45017858.6090106@gmail.com>

Following an absence from work due a long term illness, I have just 
completed the CIW Master Designer qualification to assist me in my to 
return to work.  
 
To facilitate my return, it is apparent that I need to learn PHP and 
demonstrate its use with and without MySQL.
 
Could you suggest examples that I should write and use as part of my 
portfolio.
 
I am not looking for detailed descriptions, just brief outlines of 
projects that will demonstrate the skills being considered for PHP
employment at this time.  
 
I have some experience of using PHP5 and PHP4 with MySQL, and a lot more 
experience in C++, so I am not coming at it as a complete programming 
novice.

Thanks.

Neil,

I happen to be struggling now with a database issue that might interest you and
I'd welcome and appreciate suggestions from the group.

My issue is: With a relational database how do you represent and navigate a
tree with unlimited number of levels and branches ? Example: categorization
hierarchy. Let's say you have a table of Employees. Now you want to categorize
them by Job_Type: clerk, secretary, manager, etc. But each one of these can be
further sub-categorized, e.g. Manager: production, purchasing, accounting etc.
Each one of those can also be sub-categorized in an unlimited recursive
fashion. 

One could try constructing a table with columns: level_0 level_1 level_2 etc.
where level_0 holds the 0-th level categories, level_1 - first level
subcategories, etc. But what if the number of category levels is potentially
unlimited - what do you do then?

Seems like this must have been dealt with before somewhere, and any suggestions
and pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Oops, my bad. My memory must have confused you with one of the other gurus
who was praising RoR on this list a while back.

You should further study the topic: 'database normalization' to get more
grasp of 
how to handle table relationships as the industry has generally settled on. 

The following type of three table structure should offer solution to your
issue. 
Roughly creating as follows should get you started. 

"Employee" table fields:
ID 
Employee_ID
First_Name 
Last_Name
Address

"Employee_Attrributes" table fields:
ID 
Employee_ID 
Category_ID

"Available_Categories" table fields:
ID
Category_Name


"Employee" table and "Employee_Attributes" tables have an infinitely
expandable, one to many, primary key to foreign key relationship.

Save a new row entry into "Employee_Attributes" table every time an Employee
is added to a new category. 
Then perform multi-table SELECT queries using JOIN, LEFT JOIN, or RIGHT JOIN
when you need to get the Employee category info.

That should tide you over.

I think you'll need a few extra fields in the "Available_Categories" table to get the type of heirarchy you're talking about.  There's a few different types of commonly used tree structures... so you have to figure out which one best fits what you need.  I know we had a discussion about some tree implementation in the last month or two... I forget if it was on this list or the MySQL SIG list.  Also, you can get away without having the ID field in the "Employee" table by using Employee_ID and Category_ID together as the primary key.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP and MySQL projects to include in a portfolio
In-Reply-To: <mailman.7224.1157728877.87004.talk@lists.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <000301c6d35f$f87726f0$b500a8c0@bcu.org>

I have dealt with this issue before of having infinite levels and branches
within a hierarchy. To extend Peter's note, follow his table structure,
however for the Available_Categories table you need to store a parent_id to
know where in the hierarchy your item fits. So you would have:

"Available_Categories" table fields:
ID
Parent_id
Category_Name

For example you have (1)IT->(7)Software->(20)Programming->(40)PHP programmer
with the corresponding id next to them in parenthesis.

Your table available categories would contain

id   parent_id    category_name
1       NULL         IT
7        1          Software
20       7           Programming
40       20          PHP programmer

This is one alternative to this solution, but if you need to display the
entire branch of all the parents of PHP programmer you would have to do 3
sql queries to get them all. You can see how processing for this quickly
gets out of control if you go many levels deep.

My recommendation is to follow the Modified Preorder Tree Traversal
solution. Read up on it here,
http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database/2. Notice that
the parent_id field has been replaced with the left_id and right_id fields.
This will allow you go get all the parents of a node with just 1 sql query.

Much as I appreciate the plug, Savant is more a template/presentation- 
logic system than a framework.

And IIRC, Cortex is officially defunct; Davey gave it up in favor of

In my experience, storing/passing all variables via server-side sessions 
with a mysql based session handler simplifies many things.

I'm admittedly not so well-versed on security issues, but why not hash the
CC# (with crypt() or something similar) and store it in sql temporarily? You
could store the corresponding sql key id in the session.

Sessions are very easy to work with. I think your best bet.

Whether one examines fairly generic concepts like Joomla, phpNuke,
dotProject or TYPO3. Or one looks at the generic frameworks. 
Or one looks at the sourceforge.net collection of tools and projects. It
might be proper to observe that there is 
quite sufficient baseline "generic" PHP product out there. 

And that these worldwide, many years long collective collaborations were
likely originally engendered predominantly to propel 
PHP development from 0 - 60, causing PHP to rapidly appear as a competitive,
diverse, solutions-oriented code framework when 
compared to JAVA and ASP. 

Maybe these PHP projects have achieved what was originally needed to
basically propel PHP to an IT takes note status. 

Now it may be time for new talents to focus on the next evolutionary
competitive step and that would be to tie together, maximize, enhance and
compound all these "generic" projects and spin them into very rich, full
package commercial enterprise-wide solutions with a bit more out of the box
readiness to meet the expectations of known market segments that need and
buy full scale (verily even expensive and satisfyingly profitable) web
application solutions.

Might there not be a business case that shows the there is sufficient
competitive cause now -- that PHP developers need -- more access to free or
low-cost well done projects that really answer contemporary commercial
business needs. 

No collective of developers needs to hold back anymore and think: "Well, if
we want to create a successful project that is going to get used a lot, we
need to make this non-specific grey box set of features and functions for a
hypothetical vast generic market of scientifically precise programmers to
use." To the contrary, the collective of developers should now be thinking:
"What are some of the present day ripe business categories that have
exploded onto the internet and PHP developers could use targeted, base code
projects that meet the needs of an ever expanding, feature hungry mass of
potential PHP customers who are right now paying way too much to other
programmer/code languages." 

New PHP projects really need to cohesively, convincingly and accurately do
modern expected things that most customers are now desiring as a matter of
course, such as: streaming media, perform bulk emails, collect and create
RSS, encrypt cookies/session, registration/login/preferences, meeting
calendar, customer inquiries center, FAQ, online chat/IM, help desk/trouble
ticket, mapping, weather, and even interface with bar codes. 

PHP could use to take and grow market share in all the following business
segments:

Chamber of Commerce 
Convention Center 
Visitor's Bureau 
Supermarkets 
Television Station 
Automobile Dealership 
Yacht Dealership 
Cruise Line 
Venture Capital Firm 
Museum 
Resort / Resort Chain 
Hotel / Hotel Chain 
Movie Theatre Chain 
Performing Arts Center 
Dance Troupe 
Theatre Ensemble 
Circus 
National Park 
Day School Site 
Grade School / High School Site 
Real Estate Agency 
Real Estate Residential Developer 
Real Estate Commercial Developer 
Accounting Firm 
Law Firm 
Politician 
Political Group 
Fundraiser 
Trucking Firm 
Tanker Firm 
Police Department 
Fire Department 
Art Gallery Chain 

Even bigger and more ambitious: 
News Site with multimedia 
Weather Service 
Traffic Site 
Media Download Site 
Software Download Site 
Photo Sharing Site 
Train Scheduler 
Web Cam Viewer Site 
Expedition Chronicler 
Digital Movie Download Site

If I am off base and you know a full featured opensource project that fills
the gap in the above business segments, just list them and everyone will be
helped by what might otherwise be interpreted as shameless PHP project
publicity.

Following an absence from work due a long term illness, I have just 
completed the CIW Master Designer qualification to assist me in my to 
return to work.  
 
To facilitate my return, it is apparent that I need to learn PHP and 
demonstrate its use with and without MySQL.
 
Could you suggest examples that I should write and use as part of my 
portfolio.
 
I am not looking for detailed descriptions, just brief outlines of 
projects that will demonstrate the skills being considered for PHP
employment at this time.  
 
I have some experience of using PHP5 and PHP4 with MySQL, and a lot more 
experience in C++, so I am not coming at it as a complete programming

Thanks.

Neil,

I happen to be struggling now with a database issue that might interest you
and
I'd welcome and appreciate suggestions from the group.

My issue is: With a relational database how do you represent and navigate a
tree with unlimited number of levels and branches ? Example: categorization
hierarchy. Let's say you have a table of Employees. Now you want to
categorize
them by Job_Type: clerk, secretary, manager, etc. But each one of these can
be
further sub-categorized, e.g. Manager: production, purchasing, accounting
etc.
Each one of those can also be sub-categorized in an unlimited recursive
fashion. 

One could try constructing a table with columns: level_0 level_1 level_2
etc.
where level_0 holds the 0-th level categories, level_1 - first level
subcategories, etc. But what if the number of category levels is potentially
unlimited - what do you do then?

Seems like this must have been dealt with before somewhere, and any
suggestions
and pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Leo Kokin

You should further study the topic: 'database normalization' to get more
grasp of 
how to handle table relationships as the industry has generally settled on. 

The following type of three table structure should offer solution to your
issue. 
Roughly creating as follows should get you started. 

"Employee" table fields:
ID 
Employee_ID
First_Name 
Last_Name
Address

"Employee_Attrributes" table fields:
ID 
Employee_ID 
Category_ID

"Available_Categories" table fields:
ID
Category_Name


"Employee" table and "Employee_Attributes" tables have an infinitely
expandable, one to many, primary key to foreign key relationship.

Save a new row entry into "Employee_Attributes" table every time an Employee
is added to a new category. 
Then perform multi-table SELECT queries using JOIN, LEFT JOIN, or RIGHT JOIN
when you need to get the Employee category info.

That should tide you over.

Neil,

I happen to be struggling now with a database issue that might interest you
and I'd welcome and appreciate suggestions from the group.

My issue is: With a relational database how do you represent and navigate a
tree with unlimited number of levels and branches ? Example: categorization
hierarchy. Let's say you have a table of Employees. Now you want to
categorize them by Job_Type: clerk, secretary, manager, etc. But each one of
these can be further sub-categorized, e.g. Manager: production, purchasing,
accounting etc. Each one of those can also be sub-categorized in an
unlimited recursive fashion. 

One could try constructing a table with columns: level_0 level_1 level_2
etc. where level_0 holds the 0-th level categories, level_1 - first level
subcategories, etc. But what if the number of category levels is potentially
unlimited - what do you do then?

Seems like this must have been dealt with before somewhere, and any
suggestions and pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Multipage forms -- sessions or hidden variables
In-Reply-To: <c5949a380609071747s638baa22y6348c5d17e1ca0b0@mail.gmail.com>
References: <000401c6d2ca$430e1160$8101a8c0@HirschLaptop>	<4500B884.5090300@omnistep.com>
	<c5949a380609071747s638baa22y6348c5d17e1ca0b0@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <45019DBC.7060009@aeso.org>

Main issue with the builtin session handling is that those sessions 
expire... so you'd run into problems where someone was putting stuff 
into their cart, then got up, went into the kitchen, ate some Ramen and 
drank a couple cups of coffee with their significant other while talking 
about various political issues plaguing our system these days, came back 
to finish shopping and check out, and she'd have to start all over again. :(

Rolan Yang mentioned overriding the default session handlers with 
MySQL.  That is also an option, but you need to configure it right and 
make sure none of that information expires to the point of the client 
not being able to access their cart anymore.

Hidden form variables aren't a very good idea, it's quite difficult to 
work with, especially if they don't follow the flow you _think_ they 
will follow.  People don't necessarily add something to their cart, then 
check out immediately.  They are likely to click other links, browse 
around, or even to go another site and come back to yours later.  All of 
those things would be very hard to maintain with hidden form variables.

In the past I've handled it in a number of ways.  One way is to set a 
cookie on their end with a unique "Shopping Cart ID", and have it expire 
in say a day or two or thirty (and store their current cart in the 
database).  You also need a way to validate that that shopping cart 
belongs to the user that claims it belongs to, so you don't end up with 
some dork hijacking someone elses cart and screwing with it.  Another is 
to force them to register on your site before they can check out.

There are plenty of other ways as well, depends on how complex you want 
to make it and how popular it's going to be.

I'm evaluating CodeIgniter for a brand new project.   It seems to be a 
fairly new MVC framework and came recommended by some coworkers.   It 
seems to position itself directly against CakePHP and model itself on 
Rails.   Can anyone give a thumbs up or down?

Yeah, even the demo is a complete rip-off of the RoR demo ;-)

Thanks, David & Peter,

That looks like the solution.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] fsockopen Problem
Message-ID: <20060908195256.89369.qmail@web30707.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi everyone,

I have just migrated from PHP 4.3 to PHP 5.1. The code
that I have written under PHP 4.3 is:

.
<snip>
.
fsockopen($this->host, $this->port, $errno, $errstr,
$this->timeout);
socket_set_timeout($fp,$this->timeout);
$request = $this->buildRequest();
.
<snip>
.


The code above works under PHP 4.3. When running the
code under PHP 5, I'm getting the following
error:"Connection failed (10060) A connection attempt
failed because the connected party did not properly
respond after a period of time, or established
connection failed because connected host has failed to
respond."

I used the windows installer to installed PHP 4.3, and
I don't know how it set up my settings, but since an
installer didn't come with PHP 5, I had to set up
everything on my own. I know that for some reason,
fsockopen can't open up a connection in PHP 5. I don't
know what I am doing wrong. Any help or suggestions
will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Thomas

Let me challenge this that perhaps it will be the old talents, those
with solid histories of delivering the goods, who may pick up PHP
because it will help them with their business goals of delivering
quality goods.

If so, they will already have established contacts and books of
businesses in the markets you mention below.  They won't be interested
in MVC, ORM, or the finer points of package distribution.  They will be
interested in delivering goods at a profit, as they always have been and
always will.

How do frameworks fit into that picture?  Or, how does the framework fit
into the picture of the larger realities of software development such as
incomplete specs, contradictory specs, impossible timelines, cash-flow
problems from slow-to-pay customers, arbitrary change requests, the need
for things that there never seems to be time for like testing,
documentation and training, and many others.

Any framework that begins by expecting the customer to adapt to the
programming model will fail.  Any framework that is not solidly grounded
in real-life projects will likely fade eventually.  And, perhaps biggest
of all, any framework that does not learn from the systems that have
come before, from COBOL to Foxpro and VB and Java, will be overtaken by
those that are built with a sober knowledge of what has come before.

out there, aren't there? Somebody is using it. Oh, and Wordpress has 
become the tool of choice for many "news" sites. Go figure.

People DO pick frameworks and commit to them. Of course these are not 
traditional 'software projects' but web projects.

Now, tomorrow when the VIEW of DATA  has succeeded , and someone 
recognizes there is additonal value in the community, the archives, and 
the efficiencies that can be captured through customization, I agree 
they will either be told (by good consultants) or will discover 
themselves that a framework is only as good as it's ability to be 
utlized in a customized configuration. At that point they will also 
hopefully have the cash and willingness to spend it on development.


It may just be that a frameworks with Parts A-Z is "good enough" to get 
started without having to (re)define all those specs in the first go.

Hello,

	my name is David and I am new in this group. I do some PHP for fun for my 
private web site and well, not to bore you with more details about me, here 
is my question. I always stumble across an odd thing with arrays. I read in 
many documentations and books that one should use the single quotes when 
referencing to an array element, such as $array['element']. Generally, this 
works fine and I use it that way, but it always fails when using it in echo 
or header statements (and probably a few others). The error I receive is
parse error, unexpected T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE, expecting T_STRING or 
T_VARIABLE or T_NUM_STRING.

I know how to get around this parse error by omitting the single quotes 
($array[element] instead of $array['element']), but I somehow am under the 
impression as if this isn't really the way to do it. I could assign it to a 
variable each time, but that is quite annoying (but maybe the right thing 
to do?).

What is the significance of the single quotes? What is the expert advice on 
using or not using them? How would I package the single quote in an echo or 
header statement?


	Any enlightenment is greatly appreciated.

David,

    In general, yes, use single quotes.  Using double-quotes will cause
PHP to interpret the string, and is necessary if the key has a variable
in it, for example: $myarray["something_$var"], with $var=='foo', will
get you the value of $myarray['something_foo']. 

    While I'm not entirely sure about how you're echoing stuff, try just
not putting the array reference inside the string.  Instead, use the
concatenation operator ".":

    echo 'You are ' . $user['username'] . '.  Last login: ' .
$user['last_login']';

I'm happy to see that you're questioning, but not discarding, PHP dogma.

Two things:

1. Quoting an array element inside a quoted string can be done with
curly braces:

"Once upon a {$myarray['time']}, ..."

2. If the arrays you're talking about are superglobals like $_GET and
$_POST, both of your examples probably demonstrate security
vulnerabilities. Using raw input in an echo creates a cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Using raw input in a call to header()
creates an HTTP response splitting vulnerability.

> What is the significance of the single quotes? What is the

When you don't use them, your syntax indicates that the array key is a
constant. If that constant doesn't exist, PHP will try treating the name
of the constant as a string, in case that's what you really meant. The
result is that it will "work" most of the time, but it's not completely
reliable (what if there happens to be a constant by that name?), and
it's very ugly regardless.

Hope that helps.

Chris

>Hello,

Just to provide a little background on the answers others have provided:

PHP (for whatever reason; <joke>presumably a feature and surely not a 
bug</joke> ;-) doesn't allow you to use the normally expected single 
quotation marks around an array element when the array variable 
appears within something which has double quotation marks around it, 
typically an echo statement containing both text and variables, but 
also possibly a header statement or something else. So something like 
this is no good, and will throw the error you are getting:  echo "The 
$variable is $array['elementName']";

There are three ways to accomplish what you are trying to do:
1. concatenate:  echo "The $variable is " . $array['elementName'];
2. use curly brackets: echo "The $variable is {$array['elementName']}";
3. NOT RECOMMENDED BUT USUALLY WORKS:  don't use the single quotation 
marks: echo "The $variable is $array[elementName]";

It is a matter of personal preference whether you choose 1 or 2; both 
work and are fine.  #3 causes extra work for PHP and can fail if 
elementName happens to be a constant; so it should not be used.

Chris Shiflett's point about the dangers of using raw superglobal 
variables in output is a very good one; the point is that if the 
arrays you are working with contain user-submitted information, you 
must take special care to sanitize them.  Any of the books on 
security that are around can tell you how to do this. If you are not 
working with these kinds of arrays, but rather with ones that you 
have created yourself, you may not need to worry about security 
issues in using them.

Disclaimer: I am no where near the level of the prior responders when it 
comes to PHP skillz

I think this is very good advice, David. If there is one thing I learned 
about PHP, it is that PHP either makes rational sense or does not ;-) In 
other words, there is not much actual need to follow "dogma" if you 
understand how it works, except in those cases where PHP is kinda broke. 
The hard part is knowing when it is broke, and this list is a *great* 
resource for that. (please note I do suggest you follow best practices, 
because you can't recognize what is and isn't "dogma" unless you already 
know where all the real problems are).

To demonstrate, look at your responses here. Chris shows you how to 
embed the array element value into a string using curly braces (the 
actual way to do that, if that is what you really want to do). He also 
shows you (as do others) that concatenation is likely the key to your 
string building desires. Coming from other languages, you may not "think 
like that" but in PHP, that is a very good way to think. The concat 
operator (.) is your friend and works rationally. Also note how Chris 
defines precisely the use of single and double quotes... they, too are 
rational and do what they are supposed to do.

Finally, back to the first comment from Tim above. Tim wisely 
immediately  alluded to the idea that the way you are "echoing" your 
stuff may need attention. BINGO. "echo" in some ways is "broken", and is 
at least partly responsible for the confusion surrounding single and 
double quotes in strings built from hard coded characters and data 
values, especially when the data is embedded into arrays, and especially 
when the coder attempts to extract those values directly into strings 
"built" to be displayed to the browser. We have come full circle... you 
could go to curly braces, work out the rational details of the proper 
single quoted array "keys", and/or recognize that the encompassing 
"echo" command is imposing some restrictions on the way your content can 
be described and look at alternative ways to get your built data out to 
the browser.

I hope that's more helpful than it looks. You have all you need to 
advance in those early responses.

This could be because you are not properly using them or you do not have  
clear idea of how to properly quote expressions.

Do not just think in terms of 'echo', 'header' or any other construct or  
function. In much broader sense, just remember simple and golden rule that  
WHEREVER and WHENEVER variable is to be EXPANDED, CONCAT it with rest of  
the expression and use 'SINGLE quote' if certain part of the expression is  
STATIC (i.e. to be used just as it is). In short just using 'single quote'  
and concatenation you can write 99% code in PHP. This is true everywhere  
in PHP whether you assign value to variables, print something, define  
array with elements, pass arguments to function/class methods or evaluate  
any expression. This is good practice throughout PHP and probably for all  
other languages. Let me demonstrate few examples.

#1

$as__name['first']='David';

(Key of array has been quoted using 'single' quotes because key itself is  
static, same for value for that array i.e. 'David';

#2

if('David' == $as__name['first'])
	echo 'Name is '.$as__name['first'];

In above logical expression key of array, value to be compared with that  
array element and conditional echo  statement all have been expressed  
using 'single quotes' only. You can see that left portion of echo  
expression 'Name is' is not to be expanded that is why used in 'single  
quotes' but to display real name variable "$as__name['first']" has to be  
expanded hence it has been concated with first part of the expression.  
However if you have 'single quote' itself as a part of your expression  
then escape it with '\' characters like "echo 'My dad\'s name is  
'.$as__name['first'];")

Bottom line: There is not any MANDATORY use of "Double quotes" in PHP  
except in 1 case when:

#a Special sequence like "\n", "\t", "\s" are to be expanded into New  
line, Tab and Space respectively.

In short "double quotes" tries to expand each and every part of the  
expression, which is not required mot of the time. Hope this will help you  
clear some basic level of evaluation of expressions.

Aptana is a good way to go, since the (several months old) rumor is
that the next generation of Zend Studio is going to be built on
Eclipse.

Since Aptana can be installed as either standalone or Eclipse
extensions (or is it modules?) you'll get two IDEs for the memory
footprint of one. Right now, running Aptana side by side with the Zend
IDE is a little painful.

Also, not an IDE but since you mention Venkman... I can't say enough
good things about the Firebug extension for Firefox.

Are you sure? I thought PHP does not try to evaluate constants within
double-quoted strings. Therefore it is a little weird-looking (because it
look inconsistent with our good quoting practices) but nevertheless
perfectly kosher to do #3.

Or am I wrong about that?

I've never tried it, but you're right:

<?php

define('index', 0);

$myarray[index] = '<p>constant</p>';
$myarray['index'] = '<p>string</p>';

echo "$myarray[index]";
echo "{$myarray[index]}";
echo $myarray[index];

?>

I still thinks it's a stretch to call this "kosher." Weird is what I
would call it. :-)

For what its worth, you need to use a similar strategy when
referencing object properties that are more than one "level" deep.

"Hello $user->name." will work, but "Hello $auth->user->name." will not.

I find it much easier to get attached to one of the 2.x frameworks
(prototype/scriptac, jquery/interface) and write out tidbits of code
into the templates of Zend Studio .. Ie:

For example this whole tidbit would be script[tab]ajaxreq[tab] + then
tab across and fill in what's needed.  Pretty handy.

<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
  var opts = {
    method: 'post',
    postBody: 'var=1&foo=2',
    onSuccess: function(resp) {
    // success
     
    },
    on404: function (resp) {
    // 404
      
    },
    onFailure: function (resp) {
    // failed
       
    }
  }
  new Ajax.Request('/foo/bar', opts);
</script>

Unfortunately, the world is not all PHP. And for those of us that don't
have the luxury of a client-side development team, we must occasionally
program in Javascript. I don't know about you, but since I don't do it
that often, I find it painful to say the least. Was it getElementbyID or

Any thoughs on a good JS IDE equivalent to Zend Studio.

Yeah, $() should just be added to the DOM standard...

Except that it's really window.$(), which means it should be added to
ECMAscript.

But it deals with DOM. Dang, I guess that's never gonna happen.

One of the nice things about javascript is that it's consistent in
naming internal functions.  You shouldn't have to look up
getElementById(), because built-in methods all follow
thisKindOfConvention (is that camel-case?).  One of the things people
complain about in php is that it's hard to remember what built-ins have
underscores, etc.

Hi!
         First of all, thank you for the great responses that pretty much 
cleared up my initial questions, but generated a few new ones. I will cut 
this digest down to some useful length (apologies to those who are hooked 
on thread IDs).

At 11:53 AM 9/11/2006, you wrote:

Single quotes it is.

I echoed stuff this way:
echo "This is for $lovedones['wife']!";
That throws this parse error
parse error, unexpected T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE, expecting T_STRING or 
T_VARIABLE or T_NUM_STRING.
So, the correct(er) way is
echo "This is for ".$lovedones['wife']."!";
Duh! That apparently was just too easy to figure it out myself.

I always assume that there are good reasons for designing something that 
blatantly inconsitent. It is just that I don't know about it, which doesn't 
mean that it is wrong.

>1. Quoting an array element inside a quoted string can be done with
>curly braces:
>
>"Once upon a {$myarray['time']}, ..."

Ui! Curly braces. I haven't seen that one before, but a quick test shows 
that it indeed works (one of these I need to see it to believe it things). 
Will probably not become my most favourite way of doing this. I already 
know the concatenation stuff and understand what it does.

Aha, no idea what that is. I do not want to design breakage into my script, 
so here quickly what I want to do. I use the header() mainly for redirects 
(and for turning off cache using code that I copied from the php.net site 
comments). In order to properly redirect I need to know what the root 
folder of my set of scripts is. As long as the directory hierarchy, the 
directory names, and the name of the start script stay intact it will not 
matter where on a server this block of files is located. On the first 
script I generate the redirect path section that I can use in all other 
scripts like this:
// Make path for redirects
$path = "http://";
$path = $path.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
$script = $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];
$script = str_replace("/login.php", "", $script);
$path = $path.$script;

I then register $path with the session that I started earlier using
$_SESSION['sessionredirectpath'] = $path;

and use it later in scripts for redirects like this:
header("location:$_SESSION[sessionredirectpath]/administration/adminwelcome.php");

which really should be this:
header("location:".$_SESSION['sessionredirectpath']."/administration/adminwelcome.php");

[...] I read that stuff about the constants issue somewhere after I posted.

>3. NOT RECOMMENDED BUT USUALLY WORKS:  don't use the single quotation
>marks: echo "The $variable is $array[elementName]";

Yes, it works and in the worst case I can pick german variable names. 
Chances are the PHP folks will not introduce german keywords or constants. 
Besides the constants issue, is there anything else that makes not using 
the single quotes a bad idea? I ask because I use some scripts that I 
hacked together some time ago and for the time being they do their jobs. In 
case of some security issue I might want to pull them sooner than later.

>working with these kinds of arrays, but rather with ones that you

>issues in using them.

So you are saying that the way I described it above might be OK since I set 
the session variable myself, correct?

Using the period as concatenation character is most likely one of those 
cases where PHP is broken, at least in my opinion. PHP is the only language 
that uses the period as far as I have seen. I have to admit that I haven't 
seen much in regards to programming. Actually, I hate programming, it is 
just that with PHP it is by far not so painful. And it is a good excercise 
for me as software tester to be not totally at the mercy of the developers.

The examples really helped understanding your point. I am sure that the 
vast majority of casual and even semi-professional PHP users always uses 
the double quote because this is how the official PHP documentation tells 
one to do. I just checked again and in the document topic about echo and 
only a single example shows it used with the single quotes. That though in 
combination with the note "Using single quotes will print the variable 
name, not the value", which for the newvbie sounds bad. The PHP documentors 
should use your example and explanation, it makes it easier somehow.

Now, that really sucks, doesn't it? I can't come up with a better proposal 
without violation the "anything in single quotes is static" rule.

         Yes, indeed it does and all your superb responses cleared up quite 
a bit of other things as well. Wow! I haven't learned that much about PHP 
in such a short time for quite a while. Thank you very very much and I hope 
I don't get beaten up over this quite lengthy response.

                 Best regards,

                                 David

Here I would like to answer your question in different way. If your  
problem area is only of highlighting syntax then instead of finding new or  
better IDE, you can try to "tweak" existing IDE so that it will start  
highlighting required missing keywords, functions, properties. If you are  
on Linux machine then most of IDEs are smart enough that they can be  
configured the way we want. For example we use "Quanta editor" (sometimes  
known as "kdewebdev") on Fedora 4 in which you can add your custom  
entities to be highlighted if existing database of entities is not  
highlighting everything. In case of Java-Script there resides a file  
called "/usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax/javascript.xml" which you can  
easily edit and add custom entities (even user-defined ones :) ) to  
highlight them. Not just JavaScript but you can configure highlighting  
entities of almost all supported types of that IDE. Just browse directory  
"/usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax/".

This answer might not be useful to you, but can be for others if they  
can't easily switch to different IDEs.

Thanks

Try to box it in a bit more. 
For example, will other file types download successfully. 
[Typically, .zip files will always download properly.] 
 
Try appropriately filled out inclusion of additional headers as suggested in
below sample:
 
$filename = "MAQ09718.MP4";
header("Pragma: public"); 
header("Expires: 0");
header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0");
header("Cache-Control: private",false); 
header("Content-Type: application/force-download");
header("Content-Disposition: attachment;
filename=\"".basename($filename)."\";" );
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");
header("Content-Length: ".filesize($filename));
 
 
Google "force file download issues php" to find more headers you may need.
Call directly to and/or surf manufacturer's site for known issues / browser
version issues.

Any reason why the following script wouldn't force download the file in
question with the appropiate name in all situations? Works in a few
browsers, but, not while using the Internet Browser on the PSP. Tries to
save the file 'download.php' instead of the actual video file. 

Thanks

Some browsers continue, in 2006, to ignore all hints about what the 
appropriate filename of a downloaded file should be.  Try hitting the 
download URL like this:

http://yoururl.com/download.php?foo=MAQ09718.MP4

The browser may well be stupid enough to just grab the last part of the URL 
and use that as the filename of the downloaded file.

it may not be ideal but using MOD_rewrite to solve this issue just might

I think there's another problem related to these two.  There are a
number of open source apps out there setting horrible examples for the
rest of us.  I - like many around here most likely - picked up php
coming from other languages.  Therefore, since I knew the concepts and
wanted to focus on syntax, my tendancy was to look at how other people
were doing things and learn from there.

Last night at DCPHP, I was speaking with a couple people who hadn't
heard of either concept.  After a quick walkthrough, it started to
make sense to them, but I was surprised at their ignorance (in the
strictest definition of the word).

> 3. it isn't preached enough

And it needs to be hammered into people... some on this list have been
responsible for driving this area but I think it needs to go a step
farther.  Any idea what that step should be?

Not that my comments solve anything, but wasn't the web was designed 
by newbies?

No disrespect meant, but every step forward in web development was 
new and obviously done without full consideration for what was being 
developed and the hazards that might accompany each step.

So what we have now, as I see it, is dealing with a gamut of problems 
that weren't properly addressed in the beginning, such as spam, 
security, and legacy ASCII issues.

The history of "why", might help in the "how" to solve the problem.

Just my $0.02.

Personally, I'm of the opinion that right now people tend to focus too
much on input filtering, and not enough on safe storage and display
practices.

If you are correctly handling incoming data, it makes little difference
what that data may be.  For example, if you construct a query like:

$query = "SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE myid='$someid'";

You are obviously vulnerable to assorted SQL injection attacks.

However, construct the query like:

$query = 'SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE myid='.
mysql_real_escape_string($someid);

or:

$query = 'SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE myid=?';
$args = array(
    $someid,
);

And you have prevented the attack, regardless of the contents of
$someid.  This is because you are correctly formatting the data in
context, in this case as an SQL string.

The same goes for displaying data on a webpage, pass it through
htmlspecialchars and you'll be guaranteed that it is correctly formatted
as a block of HTML CDATA.

The security breach comes from treating the data incorrectly, not from
its contents.

That said, if you need to display html received from the client as html,
you need input filtering to separate the bad from the good.  However,
these cases are not the norm, and in many situations input filtering is
merely restricting the data you're allowing clients to input, without
any real security gains.

If you need to enforce certain restrictions on user input, according to
the 'rules' of the system then input filtering is a great idea, but
don't get caught up in thinking that filtering input is the answer to
all security problems.

It would seem that it would be more optimally secure to both:
i) correctly handle the data, but also to
ii) check for what the data is. 

That would include checking length and data type. Wrong data types 
and too long strings can break SQL queries. 

But, hypothetically, if one is stuffing all their data into type VARCHAR
fields 
all kinds of things will get handled. But, later data summary reports from 
the database can produce inaccurate results. 

I was just reviewing Adobe best practices on Flash ActionScript 2.0 
and they suggested that all variables be declared and be 
strongly typed to force your application to throw errors immediately 
when wrong data types get sent to a function.

The ActionScript strong data typing is of the form:
var cust_first_name : string
var this_date : Date

It appears that almost every other language competitively positioned to PHP 
forces discipline a bit more, starting with making one know the expected 
data type(s) at all junctures.

Message-ID: <f1dc81bb0609140728i71b5bf8fg4ea3f233de58f6b2@mail.gmail.com>

I used to teach smarty for zend.com.

Based on your comments and the comments from other people, I'd like to
split your post into three questions:

1 - Should I be separating my "business logic" from my presentation
layer / presentation logic.

2 - Should I use Smarty (or some other solution) in order to separate
my business logic and presentation.

3 - Should I be using an OOP solution.

Question 3 is beyond the scope of this answer, so lets just look at
questions 1 and 2.



1. Should I be separating my "business logic" from my presentation
layer / presentation logic.

For the most part, the answer YES.

Your comment of:
> I also cannot stand the editing of multiple documents, both containing bits
> and pieces of logic - I know, one is application logic, the other is display
> logic.... is this really logical?  Bouncing between documents does not seem
> efficient, and it also seems quite possible that a web designer could still
> screw up the display logic.... hmmm...

leads me to believe that you're not so sure about this :)

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic for further discussion
on the matter. Or just search google for terms like MVC or
multi-tier-architecture.

Regarding using Smarty as your implementation, personally, I think it's great.
I know there are other great solutions out there so it really depends
on your requirements.

Keep in mind that Smarty actually does more than just separate
business from presentation. For example, It has some very nice caching
features.

See http://smarty.php.net/rightforme.php and
http://smarty.php.net/whyuse.php for more info.

When considering what software package / solution to use for any given
task, I like to use the analogy of buying a car. There is no single
car that's "best" or right for everyone. There are plenty factors you
need to take into account when deciding what to get, but at the end of
the day, there will be many solutions that will meet your needs.

Hope that helped

Nice topic,

I agree with much of what has been said. I'd also like to say that most 
people using php are into writing code.
'Most people'; not just those setting up a one time phpBB or something, I 
mean software engineers.

And when I say 'writing code', I mean those that write tight procedures, 
check return values, etc...

Now, those same engineers that are into writing code, may not be into 
security with the same intensity and attention to detail that they give to 
code. I think security and programming while closely related, are two 
disciplines.

Just because your a great programmer, doesn't mean your great at tightening 
apps.

I think all developers should take some time to read a few phrack white 
papers, 2600 articles, or jon erikson books.

Even better, write some dummy programs to exploit in c (stack and heap 
stuff, plenty examples online), php for some xss and sqlinjection.

You may learn something new that you can apply to development and 
application security.

It would seem that it would be more optimally secure to both:
i) correctly handle the data, but also to
ii) check for what the data is.

That would include checking length and data type. Wrong data types
and too long strings can break SQL queries.

But, hypothetically, if one is stuffing all their data into type VARCHAR
fields
all kinds of things will get handled. But, later data summary reports from
the database can produce inaccurate results.

I was just reviewing Adobe best practices on Flash ActionScript 2.0
and they suggested that all variables be declared and be
strongly typed to force your application to throw errors immediately
when wrong data types get sent to a function.

The ActionScript strong data typing is of the form:
var cust_first_name : string
var this_date : Date

It appears that almost every other language competitively positioned to PHP
forces discipline a bit more, starting with making one know the expected
data type(s) at all junctures.

Personally, I'm of the opinion that right now people tend to focus too much
on input filtering, and not enough on safe storage and display practices.

If you are correctly handling incoming data, it makes little difference what
that data may be.  For example, if you construct a query like:

$query = "SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE myid='$someid'";

You are obviously vulnerable to assorted SQL injection attacks.

However, construct the query like:

$query = 'SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE myid='.
mysql_real_escape_string($someid);

or:

$query = 'SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE myid=?';
$args = array(
    $someid,
);

And you have prevented the attack, regardless of the contents of $someid.
This is because you are correctly formatting the data in context, in this
case as an SQL string.

The same goes for displaying data on a webpage, pass it through
htmlspecialchars and you'll be guaranteed that it is correctly formatted as
a block of HTML CDATA.

The security breach comes from treating the data incorrectly, not from its
contents.

That said, if you need to display html received from the client as html, you
need input filtering to separate the bad from the good.  However, these
cases are not the norm, and in many situations input filtering is merely
restricting the data you're allowing clients to input, without any real
security gains.

If you need to enforce certain restrictions on user input, according to the
'rules' of the system then input filtering is a great idea, but don't get
caught up in thinking that filtering input is the answer to all security
problems.

This is a really interesting point. I get depressed every time I
encounter another shared webhost that only offers php4, and packs the
server full of sprawling procedural gack that shouldn't be emulated by
anybody. And yet, this is the environment that the casual php
developer is going to be working in.

Could we point to, or even make, an example application that would be
simple enough to grok in an afternoon of study, but which would
incorporate the main security concepts that we need to keep drilling
into newbies?

Hi!

You really forgot one thing on the list: developer laziness. I work with 
quite a few developers who are all smart people and who know how to secure 
input correctly. The problem is that  adding the code takes extra time and 
is annoying as it doesn't really do much. And besides that, in a 
professional setting support is the one to pick up the pieces afterwards 
(that would be me). Since I got burned once by unscreened input that was 
piped straight into an SQL query I make extra effort to test for this (I do 
software QA as well).
The private coder who wants to spice up the self hosted webpages with some 
scripts is unexperienced and maybe negligent. What freaks me outis when I 
can simply dismantle a page for a for profit business by entering "O'Neill" 
into some text box.
Since my first few steps with SQL I am aware of the injection problem. I'm 
still awfully uneducated on this crossite scripting problem. I know that it 
exists, but I have no idea what to do about it....again, developer laziness.

Yes, and for my part that is what drove me nuts in every other language in 
the beginning. When I started with PHP it reminded me of the good 'ol days 
with BASIC on the Commodore 64.
10 A = 1
20 A = "TEXT"
is perfectly legal (not good!) code in C64 Basic. Strip the line numbers 
and add some $ and you have the same for PHP. I started learning C and Java 
and before you can do anything you have to declare half the world. That is 
really annoying for starters. Once I got to the point when I had no clue in 
my scripts what $pointer really is I quikcly realized that setting proper 
initial values saves a lot of trouble and in some cases even code. There 
isn't anything in PHP that stops one from setting data types, but it for 
sure would be nice if PHP could be configured to throw an error for 
mismatches. Some things such as discipline come not from force, but from 
understanding why it is a good thing.

That would be awesome. I am one of these newbies in regards to security 
(less the SQL injection, I figured that out the hard way) and volunteer to 
let you know if this example works for a newbie. The problem with security 
is that those who break it tend to be smarter than the ones who made it.

Haha great example (for me anyway).

That's not a developer problem in many cases, though. It's a management 
problem (or, if the budget and time frame are from Mars, a specificatons 
problem). Somebody has to be watching the code for functionality, 
especially when inexperienced coders are used or coders who are 
inexperienced at the niche area. That can be a QA team or a manager or a 
test group... but it needs a codified process. Hoping the programmer is 
smart enough to handle most situations is a mistake IMHO. How could you 
ever put pressure on that coder to increase production? Whatever is in 
the shadows will get skipped due to 9unsupervised) prioritization.

As for this bigger issue (thanks Michael for bringing it to the list) 
has anybody considered how competition enforces the rules of play? Not 
too many people... yet in sectors where it matters, these issues are 
addressed. In other sectors where it is ignored, the issue of security  
is addressed when it appears to be a problem. It's fine to address 
professional PHP coders about a broken web (they have an interest in 
building a system of professional development and integrity for PHP in 
the world... a commercial interest ;-) but don't bother preaching it to 
businesses until their is a financial incentive or reward. And that 
financial reward has to be not only big enough to cover the added costs, 
but to earn a profit on it as well.

Plenty of people point a finger at "stupid clients" for not 
accommodating the security issues. I disagree. This one is squarely in 
PHP developer land. If you want PHP to survive and deliver, you need (as 
a community) to find a way to get it secure without the client paying a 
line-item premium for it.

I have a colleague who also chose to check out CodeIgniter - what are 
your impressions of it?

I would also like to know if anyone is using any of these frameworks in 
a large-scale and/or high-traffic web site? Was your framework of choice 
easy to scale? Any used more than one framework and make a few comparisons?

I may have an opportunity to work on a major web site (porting their 
existing application from Perl to PHP) and Im told they are very much 
into "frameworks" so now Im wondering if anyone has some empirical 
analysis of the strengths and weaknesses when applied to large web sites?


Funny: back in the 90s I was porting C applications to perl... ;-)

Sorry for this incredibly short answer, but I'm a tad rushed... (  so no 
reasoning either =(  )

We use Symfony at my company.  Large scale, high traffic.  It's a bit 
buggy, a lot bloated, and the slowest thing I've seen in some time.  I 
don't recommend porting over to it.  Sorry :\  One really big reason for 
this is their use of ORMs.  If you just avoided Propel or their soon to 
be Doctrine (maybe?) implementation, Symfony would probably go quite a 
bit faster.

Also note that they are still not at 1.0, and their API changes and they 
aren't even expected to maintain much backward compat. at this point.  
Adopting it in a critical environment is probably not a good idea, at 
least not until they hit 1.0 and start making promises about maintaining 
as much BC as possible, etc..

On a positive note, their code is incredibly clean, documented, and elegant.

HTH,

Rick

Yes. team made of experienced developers can solve most of problems  
related to security that other developers could not solve or were didn't  
paid attention towards (might be because of their level of knowledge).

Proper programming practices solves 90% of security related problem that  
can occur at application level. However this "practice" is entirely  
dependent on experience of developer. But below mentioned steps would  
surely solve most of your problems.

1) The biggest area of this problem is browser. Not because that it is  
being exploited in many ways but why can't browser itself provide basic  
level of validation and input filtering like validations of name, email  
address, phone, fax, mobile etc. according to country or region. This is  
not big task or too much difficult for browser's and it's extension's  
developers. If we have characters set encoding, to display text in various  
languages, available in browser then why can't we have support of  
validation of above items. Now it is not that big that which validation  
format is to be used for each country or region. We can tell browser from  
our HTML in similar way about which character set encoding to be used.

Our browsers are in still baby or old styled which doesn't help much as  
far as security and input filtering related to forms are concerned. They  
have evolved in terms of designs and layout (we all know how fast support  
of various CSS format has grown) has but not in terms of programming.

Since this is not problem at an application area, it can not be solved at  
that level.

2) We need to start think and use Web in terms of "Human" and not just as  
machine. I am pointing towards Smart usage of our data rather than just  
using as it is. For example while mentioning email address at public  
place, user can write it in such a way that it can not be figured out from  
sources of data. By this way 70% of spamming can be stopped because  
spammer programs can not figure that out. See below examples:

a)
-----------------------------------------------
Anirudh Zala (Project Manager)
ASPL, http://www.aspl.in
arzala@@gmail.com
-----------------------------------------------

I have used 2 @s while mentioning my email address. (This is vulnerable  
but not easy.)

b)

-----------------------------------------------
Anirudh Zala (Project Manager)
ASPL, http://www.aspl.in
FIRSTNAME at gmail.com
-----------------------------------------------

This would be interpreted as "Anirudh at gmail.com" instead of  
"FIRSTNAME at gmail.com"

Following these kind of practices can fool most of automatic spamming  
programs (because they search single "@" sign or " at " to grab email  
addresses from sources) but not the person who is viewing it because  
he/she knows that what it means. Even if they copy and paste above email  
address to send email, email client will not allow to send email and they  
will soon find problem area. One possible drawback of this approach at  
application level could be handling of such email addresses while storage  
and retrieval. But as far as just displaying is concerned, it is really  
magical.

3) Security and filtering must follow certain order rather than  
concentrating at 1 area only. Filtering divided at various levels  
effectively reduce burden on developers and at the end on application. One  
can follow below order to filter and store input data.

a) While designing database, if values of certain field is not going to  
exceed than certain limit, let's say maximum 3 types then use "enum" as  
field type rather than "varchar" or "*int" etc. By this way data that  
falls outside the range of "enum" values will not be stored.

b) Most of application has 2 areas viz. Administrative and Client.  
Administrative area needs almost full control over application's data  
while Client area might not need. So such application should be run as 2  
database users where 1st user will have higher privileges and more control  
over data than 2nd. 2nd user can mostly have "select, update, insert and  
delete" privileges on required tables only. So no other privileges should  
be given to that user for rest of the tables which are used for  
administrative purpose only.

c) Handle your errors properly. Instead of showing (knowingly or  
unknowingly) them into browser log them in file and report developers via  
email.

d) In most of applications (specially built using PHP), there is not any  
file which requires "execution" permission, so discard that permission  
fully for such files.

e) Keep files and folders outside web-root which are to be used internally  
like includable files, raw templates etc.

f) While validation data in your application, do not just concentrate in  
any 1 area like at SQL level etc., Instead filter/validate it at various  
stages.

1st stage is JS which is most close to client so you can do most of  
validation with that and can prompt client instantly to correct required  
data.

Do not mind if JS is off. 2nd stage could be validating same things using  
PHP. You can build powerful regular expressions for that. At this level  
most of data can be validated and filtered. Care taken at this level will  
make your application safe against most of attacks.

Most of time we know range and type of data which is being inserted. So we  
can easily check them using regular expressions. Order of filtering data  
should be GET, POST and COOKIE because exploitation level of these 3 types  
are 3, 2, 1 (1 means lowest, 3 means highest). Now if you are not  
satisfied with these, finally validate rest of data at SQL level (using  
mysql_real_escape_string etc. and perhaps converting SQL breaker  
characters, like ', ", ; etc., into HTML entities) before storing into  
database.

I don't think that implementing these points is heavy or difficult task  
for developers so that it needs extra time and money from client. In fact  
security should be free with any application :)

Bottom-line: We all know that no application can be made 100% secure. But  
we can surely try hard not let exploiters and attackers figure out that  
where is the remaining % of area which is insecure.

Pardon my bluntness, but if we follow that reasoning then the entire
internet is hopelessly broken and insecure.  If email wasn't broken and
insecure, we wouldn't have spam.

While I agree with Rasmus that it's the responsibility of developers to
ensure they write good code - one facet of which is being security concsious
- this isn't an epiphany by any means.  Everything in the history of
computers have been plaguaed by these issues.  PHP is no different.

> why hasn't it caught fire?  Here's my quick-list..

I think it has.  Public perception is different from what's going on in
large deployments, which too is changing.  Judging the quality of a language
and it's developers on certain popular pieces of PHP software, isn't viewing
the whole picture.

Number 2 is the real issue in my opinion.  The biggest problem is the low
adoption barriers.  When I've seen PHP code from developers that know
another language, it's generally good - just like code in any other language
from a good developer - it's good.

PHP also unfortunately suffers from the Microsoft effect - writing an
exploit that would affect millions of web sites/applications makes you a
much better script kiddie than writing one that only affects a dozen.

> 3. it isn't preached enough

I don't think that's the problem :)

I partly blame the language ... I know of alot of people who complain  
about Java's strict typing/sandboxing + find it cumbersome and have  
to explain its there for a good reason.

First, get rid of this stuff ... $_GET['badstuff'] and all incoming  
defined variables period.  As long as it exists in the language  
people will complain about security ... Im suprised there is no fork  
of PHP to form a SecurePHP variant that takes this out or has strong  
wrappers for it (see 3).

Second, there needs to be a way to keep your shared libs and  
extensions up to date programatically w/ some type of scanner or  
method.  PHP is way too flexible and dependent on the system it sits  
on ... first you have PEAR libs, PECL C libs, --and-whatever-else-you- 
compiled-in.

Third, all the current PHP books (ok a few exceptions) on the shelf  
should be tossed out or redone, sanitize() methods should be *built*  
in to PHP (or $_SANITIZE['badstuff'])... ala http://www.owasp.org/ 
index.php/OWASP_PHP_Filters, then republish all the books.
After you build/compile/install PHP or as soon as you create a .php  
file on your PC/Mac, a window with this URL pops up ... http:// 
www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Top_5 ... in Ajax Web 2.0 style of course.

It basically lets you junk a database (or create static SQL) pretty  
easily.  Only thing is that Darwine wouldn't run it + trying to find  
a nice alternative on the Mac (I was thinking I could do this myself  
w/ DESC [table] or w/ Cake ORM methods) but maybe someone knows of  
existing tools?

I see where this appears to make a developer's job easier, but it
doesn't do _anything_ to make web applications more secure, and could
have a negative impact on security as beginning devs will assume that
"the browser is checking all that, so I don't have to".

The problem isn't average humans using browsers. The problem is
crackers using their own tools and scripts, especially automated
scripts, to attack your sites directly. Forget about the client and
focus your efforts on protecting the server from _anything_ that could
concievably be thrown at it.

Wanna bet? The spammers are just as smart as you are, and probably
have more time to think about the problem than you do. As long as
you're the only person doing this, it will work, but as soon as
obfuscation reaches a critical mass, the screen-scrapers will get a
lot smarter overnight.

With all due respect, this is a terrible idea.

While this validation *might* work for an incredibly small segment of
information - like address as you rightly note - it pushes a huge
burden onto the browser and then the webapp still needs to do it
anyway.  *Nothing* that comes from a user (or anything they have
access to edit) can be trusted.  Period.  End of story.

In terms of "stopping 70% of the spam", I think your solution - while
it works for you for now - doesn't address the real problem.  Although
most of us on this list are likely getting dozens, hundreds or
potentially thousands of spam today, our filtering (automated or
mental) bring this down to a managable level.  We're suffering from
spam, but not like my grandparents who have had the same AOL address
for 7+ years.  They don't have the tools, time, patience, or
creativity to do what you propose.  Now I don't have a solution that'd
work for them either... so I'm no better off.

My 0.02,

I am not entirely clear what you criticise. Is it the GET or that fact that 
subitted values from an HTML form get piped into an array that carries 
always the same name ($_GET or $_POST) or the fact that it gets stuffed 
into an array altogether?

I think one can create code to secure PHP scripts, so it is not that it is 
impossible (maybe it is), it is just that it is hard work and doesn't show 
anything pretty in the browser window.

Greetings from South Australia,

Firstly, I just want to say I have been a reader of this list for a few 
years now and I would like to say thank you to everyone at NYPHP and 
other contributors to this list for the informative discussions, ideas 
and techniques that take place here.

Regarding the current topic, I enjoy reading and as such have read many 
articles and tutorials over the years both on private sites and at the 
popular developer haunts.

One thing that I have noticed repeatedly is that anytime someone 
actually comments or gives advise about security concerns with the code 
presented in an article, the concerns are:

1. Totally ignored.

2. The author of the code responds with "I am only trying to present the 
basics here".

3. The author ends up making nasty or obscene posts about the person who 
provided the constructive criticism, not only on their own site but on 
other popular sites.

More often than not the article remains unchanged, and sometimes you 
even see the code end up in a project for download elsewhere by someone 
other than the author.

With regards point 2, surely these days including proper security is 
part of the basics!

As Chris points out in his excellent book, there is not that much extra 
coding involved to provide or fix these issues. And whats more Chris and 
a couple of others have even provided downloadable sample chapters that 
cover these basics for free, without even buying their books.

So why do these basic issues continually happen with all the excellent 
resources available to help prevent them in the first place?

I really don't know!

Anyway thanks for reading. These are just my observations of which I am 
sure many of you have noticed too.

Kind regards

Rob

Good programming is in the programmer, not the language. 

If you want a lot of rules, go for Java, you get twice the code, slower 
execution, and just as many blunders, bad interfaces, clumsy db 
strategies, etc. etc.

But good programming can be done in any language.  PHP gives 
flexibility, which in the hands of a master craftsman becomes power.

In the hands of a bad programmer you get bugs -- which he would give you 
anyway no matter what language he was using.

Hard to imagine if there is a meaningful statement here.  A web request 
is defined by its parameters.

Again, attacking flexibility as a liability.  Very odd.  Live and let live.

Won't work.  Sanitizing for return to the browser is different from 
sanitizing for database commands, not to mention other exports you may 
need to execute with their accompanying sanitation.  Some sanitation can 
be reversed, but it is bad form to unconditionally perform an operation 
that you do not always need and may sometimes reverse.

The wise programmer prefers to hold in his hands the raw data as 
delivered by the user, so that it can be handled as such for whatever 
reasons may come, and then sanitizes it for a particular destination 
when sending it there.

huh?  Are you suggesting we remove user input from the language?

If you're referring to PHP internals:
There are package managers that can do this to some extent, but the only 
ones I'm familiar with were developed by people that don't understand 
module API changes, different host platforms, etc.. (What I'm saying is 
they don't actually work, they just surprise you with a broken system 
one morning).  Actually now that I read your comment again, what are you 
suggesting?  Removing PEAR, PECL, and extensions in general?

In the event that you weren't suggesting the removal of PECL extensions 
earlier... http://pecl.php.net/package/filter
That will eventually become a part of the base system I imagine, once 
it's stable.  They were threatening to change the function names though 
a couple of days ago, but I don't think that'll happen before the 5.2 
release.

 >>> Im suggesting maybe a little DRY applied to PHP when it comes to  
security.  People seem to be complaining about the same security  
problems over and over again and neither the language itself is  
becoming smarter to handle the junk sent in nor the output going out.

http://cvs.php.net/viewcvs.cgi/php-src/README.input_filter?

That was my original point ... to get rid of $_GET/POST[] and replace  
it with this package once + for all ...

Message-ID: <6.1.2.0.2.20060916083801.02b47468@pop.snet.yahoo.com>

Hi,

	this one is not squarely on topic with PHP, but I will use it with a PHP 
script, so hopefully this counts. I like to get some more control over file 
uploads. I am currently working on a small project for managing picture and 
videos for display on the web (yes, I know there are bazillions out there, 
but mine is better ;) ). One adds a picture by uploading the file to 
server. I want to filter the upload by file extension on the client side. 
The HTML input "file" is implemented quite crappy and leaves the interface 
at the mercy of the browser. Is there any way to get some more smarts into 
the browse box for file uploads? There isn't much merit in having someone 
upload a huge file that is clearly not an image just to throw it away. I 
tried some of the JavaScripts that I could find on the web, but I have no 
clue what they are doing and from my empirical evidence they don't do a 
thing, at least not with FiFo.

	Any advice is greatly appreciated.

		David

Hi,

	does anyone have a good recommendation for a PHP IDE for Linux? On Windope 
I use EnginSite PHP Editor, which is an awesome deal for the price although 
it could use a better implementation of the debugger. I want some PHP 
geared IDE that has some basic project handling and is easily linked to the 
Apachefriends XAMPP or comes with its own built-in server (like the 
EnginSite editor). The debugger capabilities should allow for running an 
entire set of scripts in debug mode and offer the capabilities of break 
points and watches.
	I looked at xored's Eclipse based system and since I can't figure anything 
out it strikes me as not very intuitive, maybe it requires more studies 
than the basic manual. Also, it doesn't have to be for free, but also 
should not be as expensive as Zend.

Hi Listers!
	I've been using PHPEd from NuSphere and in my opinion it's great. It
gives you access to all the things you need while developing (including
terminal client, database, PHP help) all from within the IDE. You should
take it for a test drive, I was sold after the first hour with it.

Sorry, I missed the last half of the question.

 

PHPEd is for Windows only. I have also used Zend Studio (which I use on
Linux) and it?s also good.

My jscript is a bit rusty, but at the very least you could have your form submit button fire off a javascript function before submitting the form, via an onSubmit event:

[CODE]
function checkExtension(){
     var input = document.formName.fileUploadName.value;
     if (input.indexOf(".jpg") == -1){ // file isn't a jpg
          alert("This isn't a jpg!");
     }
     else{
         document.formName.submit();
     }
}
[/CODE]

Obviously people could still upload fake files by adding a fake extension, so I think ultimately you'd want php to do real filetype checking after submission, just to be safe.

I didn't test that script out, so it may require tweaking to work. Hope it helps.

Your best bet is to alter your PHP.ini for specific files to only allow them
to be uploaded, and or to change that ini setting on the page that is
performing the upload and then default it back.

That can be done? I guess it can since you mention it as a possible 
solution. This way I can also set the upload limit on the fly and make it 
even configurable. I assume I'd use ini_set() for this? I found the setting 
for the max file uploads and upload limits and execution limits, but which 
setting would restrict the file types allowed for upload. Would such a 
change be reflected in the browse box? My guess it not as that browse box 
is generated by the browser. So what happens when one picks a file with an 
illegal file extension?

Nevertheless, this is awesome!

Thank you!

Hi,

         ah yes, but that check is done after the file is already in 
temporary storage on the server, means after the HTML form submitted it. 
That isn't that difficult and I implemented that for now (although I have 
to admit that your code is half of mine and does the same thing). I want to 
screen the soon to be uploads before anything gets submitted, which means I 
need something that works on the client side. Would be nice to have client 
side PHP scripting... :/

         Thanks for the short version.

                 David

I tried using Zend Studio without much success.  I have a number of
ongoing projects and importing a "project" didn't go smoothly.  It
just didn't want to pull in all of my files despite telling it to pull
a directory recursively or even dragging and dropping.  It was
disappointing because it was actually useful editing files, etc.  I
tried out Komodo for a weekend and liked it but my eval ran out before
I got back to it.

So in the meantime, I'm back to Eclipse with a bit of Dreamweaver on occassion.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Apache 2.2.3 and PHP 5.1.6 Install Failures on Windows
	XP
Message-ID: <000001c6da84$961ed8a0$6701a8c0@SUNCODE1>

Can anyone tell me what combination of PHP 5.x and Apache 2.x they have been
able to  
successfully install on Windows XP, without going through the issues noted
below:

Got a new laptop. I'm doing a latest Apache/MySQL/PHP install on Windows XP.

On starting Apache without the PHP 5 LoadModule directives, all systems are
go and 
I am serving non-PHP web pages live from localhost.

On starting Apache with the PHP 5 LoadModule, Apache fails to start,
throwing an error like:
"httpd.exe: Syntax error on line 116 of C:/Program Files/Apache Software
Foundati
on/Apache2.2/conf/httpd.conf: Cannot load C:/PHP/php5apache2.dll into
server:"

Is this a known issue to you? Has anyone bested this installation error
state? 

Has anyone had to look at and follow the php.net User Contributed Notes
here:
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.apache2.php 

Has anyone had to download this set of files and follow the suggested
directions at:
http://www.apachelounge.com/download/php5apache2.dll-php5.1.x.zip 
...where one overwrites the original "php5apache2.dll" with a new one among
other steps? 

____________________________

My personal Apache 2.2.3 and PHP 5.1.6 installation effort details include:

Using Apache 2.2.3 and loading PHP 5 as a module with these directives in
http.conf: 
LoadModule php5_module "C:/PHP/php5apache2.dll" 
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php 
PHPIniDir "C:/PHP" 

Installed PHP 5.1.6 to C:\PHP. Added the C:\PHP path to the System
environment variables. 
Added new environmant variable PHPRC = "C:\PHP"

  You checked whether the php5apache2.dll file exists in C:\PHP, right?
This seems to be the most likely cause of your problem.

As it turns out, the latest combination of PHP and Apache that works is: 

Apache 2.2.3 and PHP 5.2


If one wants to use any Apache version higher than Apache 2.0.x 
(like I was using Apache 2.2.3) then one must download the most recent 
snapshot of PHP, that is PHP 5.2 available at this php.net sanpshots 
downloads page: 

http://snaps.php.net/

I've done the above, updated my Apache .conf to point to the newer, 
correct PHP 5.2 .dll called: php5apache2_2.dll

Already up and running. Thank you all.

Peter

I've looked at and installed XAMPP and a few others but 
I always fall back to the more streamlined ala carte installs 
because it is usually very enlightening. I do installs 
for clients and any previous experience always proves 
invaluable.

Everybody is getting in the act.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) project sites PHP as the root of problems.  They must
have read this thread...[grin]

	A draft report on the latest numbers from the vulnerability
	database found that 4,375 security issues had so far been
	cataloged in the first nine months of 2006, just shy of the
	4,538 issues documented last year. The data shows that web
	flaws have continued their meteoric rise since 2005, capturing
	the top-three spots on the list of most common vulnerabilities.

I just install over the weekend the latest apache 2.0.? and the latest PHP
and Mysql and had no problems.  Well the only problems I had is that I had
to install the mysql.dll and mysqli.dll from mysql.com

After that everything work.

N?stor :-)

That's odd. I've been using ZDE on Linux for the last year or so, and
haven't had trouble importing files. Random non-responsiveness, which
I chalk up to using it over a remote X-windows session, but not file
problems.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I have a question on how others are handling their 3rd party frameworks
... Specifically the ones under some type of version control (and when
your code itself is under version control).  There was a recent security
fix for CakePHP and an ~svn up~ provided the quickest way to get to the
fix*.  

The problem w/ this is that there are potentials for breakage under your
unit tests (or just your code if you don't do test cases).  If you have
a lot of code between the revisions of your last framework update it can
be cumbersome to check everything.  

Would tagging your code based on major framework updates (1.x.x.x) be
the best solution in case something goes awry?

Im also thinking of symlinking across the framework versions as another
alternative ... Just wondering how others might be handling it ...

- - Jon

*On a side note Ive heard of mixed effects of using svn:externals
(albeit an svn upgrade, etc) and still not sure if it is the best
option.

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] Cake v. Symfony [CodeIgniter?]

Sorry for this incredibly short answer, but I'm a tad rushed... (  so no
reasoning either =(  )

We use Symfony at my company.  Large scale, high traffic.  It's a bit
buggy, a lot bloated, and the slowest thing I've seen in some time.  I
don't recommend porting over to it.  Sorry :\  One really big reason for
this is their use of ORMs.  If you just avoided Propel or their soon to
be Doctrine (maybe?) implementation, Symfony would probably go quite a
bit faster.

Also note that they are still not at 1.0, and their API changes and they
aren't even expected to maintain much backward compat. at this point.  
Adopting it in a critical environment is probably not a good idea, at
least not until they hit 1.0 and start making promises about maintaining
as much BC as possible, etc..

On a positive note, their code is incredibly clean, documented, and
elegant.

HTH,

Rick

I don't think anyone mentioned Zend's free PHP IDE for Eclipse.  I 
haven't tried xored's Eclipse system... so not sure how it compares.  
PHP IDE hasn't gotten to 1.0 yet... I think 0.2.3 is the latest... 
pretty good for a free IDE I think.  Hogs memory though... It will work 
on 512MB but having a gig or more will let you have some extra memory 
for other apps.

Is this something you inherited or did someone higher up decide that 
Symfony was the best way to go?

Message-ID: <8d9a42800609181017k21fd39c9o3d45a8920af2d9b1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I am looking to make a connection to an SSL server via PHP sockets.  I have
been looking and found that openssl_ has to be compiled into php.  What i am
looking to do is create a connection with an SSL IRCD server.
I am quite unsure how to use OpenSSL with PHP and would like to know if
anyone here can recommend a good book/tutorial which would get me up to
speed.

Chapter 7 of Pro PHP Security (Apress) deals with this issue but may 
not be focused on your precise needs.

I like the JEdit with the PHPParser Plugin.
It's not a IDE but it is good for me.
Zend's PHP IDE is good but it have a lot of bugs (of course, it is only a
preview yet).

Message-ID: <20060918222352.75514.qmail@web37910.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone has experienced this before.
I am connecting to an IIS server over HTTPS using
pfsockopen and am getting xml data returned. Now when
I open the URL in a browser the XML is returned fine
without a problem. However when using PHP part of the
XML is all messed up, data is moved around it appears
and it messes up the XML.

I am getting an error at the end of my request to the
server:

PHP Warning:  fread(): SSL: fatal protocol error in
...

However from what I read that error deals with the
closing of the connection. Any help would be very
appreciated.

Stefan

I've had pretty good results using vendor branches to manage customised
versions of upstream software.

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html

Once you get the hang of things it makes management pretty simple,
essentially all you're doing is maintaining a local mirror of the
upstream source, then merging it into your repository whenever you want
to update to the latest versions from upstream.

Could this be a chunked encoding problem? If IIS is returning the
response with Transfer-Encoding: chunked, you'll need to decode it.

See the discussion at http://php.net/fsockopen

And here is another writeup i just found recently while pondering this
question.  It is based on the Subversion book so it is not different
or unique; provided only because it might offer some clarification on
the technique.

OK I checked the response and it is not chunked. Most
of the XML being returned is actually fine, it is just
in certain spots data in in the wrong place. Here is
the header information from the IIS server if that
helps at all:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Tue, 19 Sep 2006 16:36:59 GMT
Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Multi-part Email Template System
Message-ID: <001f01c6dc28$915c84c0$12a8a8c0@HirschLaptop>

As some of you may recall in prior threads, I have been struggling to
develop an email template methodology that achieves the following:
 
1.	Supports multi-part emails (both text and html in the same
message).
2.	Separates email content from the code as much as possible
without being a total pig
3.	Is simple and easy to modify in the future (shifting templates
to a DB, making the text part a template too, hardcoding for speed,
reducing the # of include files, etc.)
 
I'm doing this because my system generates numerous custom email
messages, each with a unique format and lots of embedded variables, and
modifying "embedded" emails is gruesome. Here's what I came up with:
 
An email directory contains a "master" Smarty html template for the main
html email look. Each email message than has two files that use the same
base name.
 
Example 'order_receipt' would have the following
 
Smarty html template: order_receipt_html.tpl
 
Text function file: order_receipt_text.php  -- this has a function named
order_receipt that returns the text body and subject line. (This was
done to accommodate order_receipt_text.tpl if warranted in the future,
but I couldn't see how to get a line break in a text template using
Smarty. Also seems like overkill to use Smarty to render a text
template.)
 
Here's the "master function":
 
static public function SendEmailTemplate($email, $template, $params) {
            $subject = '';
            $textbody = '';
            $htmlbody = '';
                        
// fetch the email text body and subject line
if (file_exists(EMAIL_TEMPLATE_DIR.$template.'_text.php')) {
 
include(EMAIL_TEMPLATE_DIR.$template.'_text.php');
                        if (function_exists($template))
                                    list($subject, $textbody) =
call_user_func($template, $params);
            }
 
            // fetch the email html body
 if (file_exists(EMAIL_TEMPLATE_DIR.$template.'_html.tpl')) {
                        $page = $GLOBALS['page']; // reference to a
global Smarty object
                        $page->assign('params', $params);
            $page->assign('emailPageContent',
EMAIL_TEMPLATE_DIR.$template.'_html.tpl');
                        $htmlbody =
$page->fetch(EMAIL_TEMPLATE_DIR.$template.'_html.tpl');
            }
 
// Send the email
            if (self::MailMime($email, $subject, $textbody, $htmlbody))
                        return true;
            else
                        return false;
}
 
My question is simply thoughts, comments? It seems like a reasonable
strategy, but I'm getting a little worried about performance. Plus the #
of includes in my system seems to be multiplying like rabbits -- the
problem of maintainability by the organic processor versus performance
for the inorganic processor.

I don't see anything conceptually wrong with what you do. Performance is 
something that you will need to test out and then decide if it is OK for 
what you need to do. The number of includes can be reduced by consolidating 
similar includes into one and by evaluating how likely an included file 
will need to be changed. If it is pretty much static and appears in only 
one or two locations, there isn't much gained with including the code 
through an external file.

If you plan on using a database anyway, it might be a good time to 
implement this now. I used to shy away from databases as I didn't know 
anything about SQL (sounded scary). I found that I can do much more things 
using database tables and thus change my approach on how to get things 
going. Especially when it comes to sorting stuff by more than one field. A 
temporary table is so easy to make and gives you all the SQL power.

The only other comment I have is this one: add more comments. In three 
months nobody including yourself has a clue why things are the way they are 
and why they work only 3 times out of 5. Been there, done that, and it 
isn't really funny...unless you do it professionally, then you can tell 
your boss how complicated this all is and that you need so much extra time. 
If he puts someone else on the job they will really need a lot of time to 
figure it out. ;)

Great comments -- including the one about commenting.
Documentation...can that be outsourced?!

Interesting comment regarding emails. So where does Craigslist fit in?
As I see it, HTML emails are a real pain and can be a real bandwidth
hog, but I think the world expects them. Geez, my kids probably expect
the email to have music and video.

Hi Cliff,

What you have there seems like a simple, logical approach to handle what 
you're doing.  As far as speed issues are concerned though, can you 
semi-quantify "numerous" emails?  If you're talking in the range of 
tens-of-thousands / day average, then there are other strategies for 
sending mail (such as injecting the email straight into the mail 
queue).  Other than that though, what you have seems straight forward 
enough in my opinion. =)

Yes, I do stuff like that professionally among other things and I don't 
really care for it. The documenting of what others did part. I'm working on 
my "own" design spec right now and that is tricky, but fun. Documentation 
is a pain in the rear, especially when you want it to be both detailed and 
accurate. I find it easier to discuss specs with someone and write them 
down, when I am not the one who codes the project (not that I am great at 
coding to begin with). At least write some outline beforehand, add plenty 
comments in the code, and then make a description afterwards about which 
script calls which function, include files, and what it passes on to others 
and expects itself. Also, write down what you shove into $_session. I found 
that I use(d) it often as the garbage can of my system and just brainlessly 
jammed it with variables (was so much fun once I figured out how easy it is 
with PHP). Also think hard if you really need this or that, you will be 
amazed with how few variables you may get by without abusing the same one 
for different stuff. I guess the people on this list can give a list that 
wraps around the world of dos and don'ts. Those are just a few that I found 
to be lifesavers for me as a rookie....uhh, and how could I forget, always 
initialize all your variables and assign them some reasonable start values 
that either are proper defaults or when there are no defaults will crash 
your script if you don't assign something useful before first use.


>Interesting comment regarding emails. So where does Craigslist fit in?

Tja, I never looked at that page up until now, but I heard a lot about it. 
Shows that simplicty can be useful and gets to the point. That page is 
HTML, but I guess if flat ASCII supported links  they'd just used that.

Those who expect it don't have a clue about what efficiency and 
compatibility means. I use my old Eudora which does a horrible job at the 
HTML emails, which saved me many times from nasty stuff. Give your kids a 
text only mail reader. ;)

This is good point "Nothing can be trusted." This is similar like  
validating client data using JS. But from client point of view, can't  
browser help bit to filter input directly from there and ask client to  
make necessary corrections? I am not just thinking in terms of Security  
only. But overall view says that such implementations can benefit clients  
as well and then at application level we can at least be relieved about  
format of data (which is 1st level of security checks).

Security, Spamming are matter of possibility and probability. Whenever  
there is rise of security threats, we have to invent new ways to increase  
level of protection to avoid such threats. There is not 100% solution of  
such problems, hence if there arise "Probability" of more threats we can  
increase "Possibility" of being unaffected from that by improving our  
current ways or inventing new ways.

I understand what you mean, but if it doesn't address the real problem  
then what is the real domain? I think there is not any single domain area  
of this problem. There are 2 kinds of spammers:

1: Which collects REAL email addresses from various places like blogs,  
company websites, mailing lists etc and send spam mails and
2: Which use certain kind of algorithm by which they can generate email  
addresses automatically (for example by using letters, one easily generate  
that "foo at bar.com" email address will surely exists on most of popular  
email services like Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL etc.) and sends spam mails with  
probability (which 90% out of 100%) of having such email address.

We can not do much to stop spamming arising out of 2nd problem. But for  
1st, we can surely try and test various ways which can be beneficial to  
everyone. Now it is up to that person whether to use that technique or not  
(depending upon importance of emails address or having time to invent or  
apply new or already existing techniques.)

But point is that; just to remain disappointed by accepting that "this  
problem doesn't have any bullet proof solution", we are increasing  
possibility of receiving more spams. Instead why not to invent new ways to  
stop it at certain level (again matter of possibility and probability.)

Good conversations so far :) Thanks all.

No, client-side filtering has zero security value.

Imagine this. You're hosting an invite-only costume party somewhere in
New York. Everyone is encouraged to wear a mask.

In order to make sure only invited people attend, you post the following
notice at the entrance:

"So that you can enjoy the anonymity of your costume, we are not
checking invitations or names, but please do not enter if you were not
invited."

Does this notice seem sufficient, or should you check invitations at the
door?

I agree. This is why I've been trying to promote the idea of FIEO
(filter input; escape output) for a more complete picture of properly
handling data, but even this doesn't address all security concerns. Some
exploits (CSRF, session fixation, etc.) play by the rules.

A similar problem is that there's too much focus on filtering user
input, as if the user is the only source of input.

I don't see much value in the C-specific exploits, but for those wanting
to experiment with some web application security exploits, the HackMe
site is a good place to start:

http://hackme.mightyseek.com/

Unfortunately, it looks like a hardware failure took the site down, and
it's not back up yet. Worth bookmarking.

In Rasmus's defense, that article takes many of his comments out of
context, as he notes here:

http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/?p=232

"Note that the internetnews story is a rather vague summary of my actual

Your point is valid. But if you fully read my first reply to this thread,  
You could figure out that my suggestions about minimizing security threats  
are to take precautions from all possible areas. Taking necessary steps at  
one area doesn't mean that you are safe from there. No. instead that step  
might be helpful to other steps so at next step you will have less  
overhead. In that context, taking browser related validation and filter  
can be an add-on advantage to developers as well as clients itself. This  
layer is just a part of many more layers of security practice. Browser is  
to be 1st layer where you can check at least format of input, doesn't  
matter you will do it again at your application layer. Point is that, it  
is helpful to clients as well that they get instant notification about all  
possible incorrectness while filling in data.

At first glance it may seem that it will have negative effect on security  
for beginners, but it might not be true because we already have JS level  
checks and still we do it at application level. So it is similar like  
that. Do double check.

We all are smarter. This is like a battle that will not end ever. However  
probability of winning and loosing that  battle will get changed  
constantly. So if spammers finds new ways to send more and more spams, we  
can find new ways to protect ourselves from them to minimize probability  
of their win. Struggle is everywhere. But probability of survival is  
important.

You're describing defense in depth, the use of redundant safeguards.
This is a valuable practice, but I want to stress that client-side
filtering has zero security value. Zero.

It cannot be considered a defense in depth mechanism and has no place in
a discussion about security.

This is good design.  The browser can be used to improve the user 
experience by rejecting things that it knows the server will reject.  
This gives the honest users a better experience.

The server still must do the final validation, however, because of the 
dishonest users, or because of mistakes in js code.

...and of course when I say server I mean database server.

There are also some validations the browser cannot easily do.  Lookup 
validations are particularly bad, but format validations like checking 
for an "@" in an email are much easier.

If I were king, I would decree that browsers should allow pages to cache 
state information from page-to-page.  This information could take the 
form of complete lookup tables out of a database, complete with 
expiration times and so forth.  Of course the browser is in control of 
how much space it will allocate (unless MS writes it), and the app must 
be able to run w/o the local cache if the browser refuses to allocate 
space, but it would be really cool.

I hear that.

Oddly enough, my post has also been taken out of context.  I was refering to

That article has created quite a stir, from Web 2.0 fanatics to PostgreSQL,
all thanks to context.

Ah... but *this* is my concern.  Let's say all the browser devs get
together and agree to do this.  Great, everyone wins, right?  No.

*  An error or implementation variation in *any* of them once again
makes our life more difficult...  anyone want to go back to the days
of IE 5?

*  There are a multitude of browsers besides the ones you see in your
server logs.  Many phones have custom proprietary browsers, so we have
Motorola, Microsoft, Mozilla, Verizon, and Samsung all agree to
something which will increase their workloads.

*  Since a browser can be completely bypassed (wget, fsockopen, etc),
we still have to do it on the backend so it saves us zero work.

But here's the danger...  how long would it take for a PHB, newbie, or
lazy developer to say "why are we validating data on the server?  My
browser does it just fine."  And in one fell swoop, we're back to
where we are now... or maybe in an even worse place.

Having a validation layer on the browser (js, whatever) is useful, but
it's not something to depend on for anything...

out.  There are still millions of people using obsolete browsers.

Estimating volume is challenging. The best I can say is that initially
it will be close to zero of course. However, in my highest bullish
hopes, it could easily escalate to 10K or even 100K per day.

Hi Cliff,

What you have there seems like a simple, logical approach to handle what

you're doing.  As far as speed issues are concerned though, can you 
semi-quantify "numerous" emails?  If you're talking in the range of 
tens-of-thousands / day average, then there are other strategies for 
sending mail (such as injecting the email straight into the mail 
queue).  Other than that though, what you have seems straight forward 
enough in my opinion. =)

In that case I'd wonder if the mail server can handle this, which it 
probably could/should. My guess is that the PHP code will most likely not 
exceed execution time of a second if that. I bet sending the messages takes 
longer than for PHP to staple them together. My experience with mail 
servers is limited. I once set one up just to find after a few days that it 
turned into a relay for spammers. I figured that it is better to shut it 
down as I apparently did not know what I was doing. Mercury mail failng to 
save the config files upon clicking save was the main culprit I found out 
later.
It also depends on how fast your box is. I have an old dual P2-333 as my 
server and for that thing not being a speed king and PHP being an 
interpreted language and having everything with MySQL on one box, it is 
still plenty fast for most things...except for running things like a full 
dump into an HTML table of 30,000 records, that takes about 10 seconds and 
is probably due to my inefficient PHP programming.

I'd test it by sending myself 10k messages unless your ISP thinks that is 
abusive (I'm sure they do). If you run your own mail server you are all 
set. Nothing is more fun load tests of this scale.

Hey guys,

I am trying to use pcntl_fork() on the mac, hoever when i do

$pid = pcntl_fork();
echo $pid; // nothing returns
I am guessing that it is returning a blank string but not sure how to debug
that, i tried var_dump($pid) but i get nothing (not sure if this is due to
being a command line util or not.

The question is does pcntl_fork work on the mac ??

This is not specific to the pcntl_fork question (which I can't answer), but
if you're ever testing whether a string is empty, try something like this:

print "Here's the string: --" . $the_string . "--";

If you get "----" as output, the string is empty.

Hey Chris, 

(Offtopic of fork( ), but in response to Chris)

Since you have double quotes, can't you just say
print "Here's the string: --$the_string--"; 

Also, I find it easy to do 
print "string($string)";

What's wrong with good old var_dump($myvar), which will tell you exactly
what's in the variable regardless of whether it is a string or not.

Yes, you absolutely can.  Just sometimes I randomly decide to use different
delimeters -- say, 'x' -- where doing everything inline will break things:

print "Here's the string: xx$the_stringxx";

Probably nothing.  But when I was an undergrad, the debugger for Turbo
Pascal sucked out loud, so I very quickly became accustomed to debugging
through output, and it's something I still do, in C++, Java, PHP, whatever.

You can also use a real comparison such as
if ($the_string == '' or $the_string == NULL) echo 'String is empty!';

That is what I always use and sometimes minus the '' check when I accept an 
empty string, but not nothing. Also, doesn't print require the string 
portion to be encloded in ()?

This is how I did it for the longest time, but some days ago wise people on 
this list explained to me that this is bad practice. Concatenation is the 
king...and single quotes. :)

Probably nothing.  But when I was an undergrad, the debugger for Turbo
Pascal sucked out loud, so I very quickly became accustomed to debugging
through output, and it's something I still do, in C++, Java, PHP,
whatever.

What's wrong with good old var_dump($myvar), which will tell you exactly
what's in the variable regardless of whether it is a string or not.

This is not specific to the pcntl_fork question (which I can't answer), but
if you're ever testing whether a string is empty, try something like this:

print "Here's the string: --" . $the_string . "--";

If you get "----" as output, the string is empty.

Hey Chris, 

(Offtopic of fork( ), but in response to Chris)

Since you have double quotes, can't you just say
print "Here's the string: --$the_string--"; 

Also, I find it easy to do 
print "string($string)";

What's wrong with good old var_dump($myvar), which will tell you exactly
what's in the variable regardless of whether it is a string or not.

Yes, you absolutely can.  Just sometimes I randomly decide to use different
delimeters -- say, 'x' -- where doing everything inline will break things:

print "Here's the string: xx$the_stringxx";

won't work.  :)

Probably nothing.  But when I was an undergrad, the debugger for Turbo
Pascal sucked out loud, so I very quickly became accustomed to debugging
through output, and it's something I still do, in C++, Java, PHP, whatever.

Technically, var_dump is output.

You used Turbo Pascal too?  What a small industry it was back then.

Actually, I liked it's debugger ... the color highlighted code-stepping
was cool.

Was fun to see the variables change before your eyes while stepping
through code.

Not required, and I prefer the way the code looks without them.  I'm sure
there are those who prefer the look with them.

Yes. It should work on Mac, it's a unix environment.

I assume you've seen this:
" Process Control support in PHP is not enabled by default. You have
to compile the CGI or CLI version of PHP with --enable-pcntl
configuration option when compiling PHP to enable Process Control
support."

Also, remember that in the child process, $pid will be empty.

csnyder,

yea i noticed that but thought MAMP would have had that enabled but i guess
not.  I have been fighting trying to get php to compile on the mac from
source.  I am not using the built in apache so the php.net docs are no
help.  It keeps tripping up when ,/configure is looking for zlib.

I am not that familiar with compiling php from source but it seens straight
forward until it trips up like this :D

I am not sure what zlib file it is looking for and i could not find a binary
zlib on my system.

/usr/include/bzlib.h
/usr/include/zlib.h
/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/powerpc-darwin8.0/zlib.bundle
/usr/lib/zlibtclConfig.sh
/usr/share/man/man3/zlib.3
/usr/share/man/mann/crc-zlib.n
/usr/share/ri/1.8/system/Zlib/zlib_version-i.yaml
/usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions/lbxzlib.h

is what locate comes up with, aside from stuff bundled with other apps.

If ANYONE has any resources i could read about compiling LAMP on the mac i
would appreciate it.  Everyone is telling me to just go with a precompiled
package and would if any of them enabled pcntl :)

Thanks,

how can I pass a value via POST without using an HTML form? Some time ago I

I've got a mac at home that I've compiled php on.  I'm on my linux 
machine here at work, so I can't quickly look it up.  However, I 
remember having to get XCode from Apple to do any compiling... I assume 
you must have that.  I just found these instructions... seem very 
similar to what I remember doing:
http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/php.html
FYI, Fink Commander is a gui frontend for the Fink package manager 
mentioned in the article.  I recommend grabbing that if you want to 
browse what else is available.

Good luck!

Hi,

indeed cURL it is, but that wasn't what I recall using. I also found the 
deal with sockets, but that looks awfully scary.

Now, cURL triggers another question. Can I send multiple

         curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, "$curlpost");

with $curlpost something like data1=value1, or do I need to jam that all 
into one string and tie it together with the &? If yes, then I need to add 
more code to screen for & on all variables as it is very likely that the & 
may be included. I also saw on php.net this:
         "Just a reminder: When setting your CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS remember to 
replace the spaces in your values with %20 "

Ah, bummer! It basically expects the name=data sets to be formatted as if 
one wants to send a get via URL.

I guess I go against my own advice, pack the two dozen variables into the 
session and then unset them after savely retrieving them........unless 
someone has a better idea that is not as painful as manipulating headers or 
massaging strings for cURL to use.

Bah! This rapidly inhales! :(

                 Thanks for the tip anyway, I can see some other good uses 
for cURL.

This should get you php5 on osx 10.4. It doesn't have pcntl enabled,
it's just supposed to mirror the default php4 binary, but with php5
goodness.

Sorry it's rough, these are just my notes so I can do it again.

Step By Step

   0. Install the latest Developer Tools
          http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/update.html
   1. Install Fink
          http://fink.sourceforge.net/
   2. Update fink (follow all instructions) and install necessary packages

      fink selfupdate
      ...

      fink install svn-client screen freetype2-hinting-dev libpng3
t1lib5 tidy-dev libjpeg wget uw-imap-c-client-ssl

   3. Install MySQL, MySQL Startup Item, and PrefPane (double-click to install)

   4. Download PHP source -- use the latest, this is just an example
      PHP 5.1.4 (tar.bz2) [5,852Kb] - 04 May 2006
      md5: b55e633bdc80ab30da7c92f760fc4b58

   5. Unpack php into /usr/local/src

      cd /usr/local/src
      md5sum ~/Desktop/php-5.1.4.tar.bz2
      #does md5 hash match?
      tar xjvf ~/Desktop/php-5.1.4.tar.bz2
      cd php-5.1.4/

   6. Configure php:

      './configure' '--prefix=/usr' '--mandir=/usr/share/man'
'--infodir=/usr/share/info' '--with-config-file-path=/etc'
'--sysconfdir=/private/etc' '--disable-dependency-tracking'
'--with-apxs' '--enable-dbx' '--enable-exif' '--enable-ftp'
'--enable-mbregex' '--enable-mbstring' '--enable-sockets'
'--with-curl=/usr' '--with-freetype-dir=/sw/lib/freetype2' '--with-gd'
'--with-gettext=/sw' '--with-iodbc=/usr' '--with-kerberos=/usr'
'--with-ldap=/usr' '--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql'
'--with-mysql-sock=/private/tmp/mysql.sock'
'--with-mysqli=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config' '--with-openssl'
'--with-png-dir=/sw' '--with-jpeg-dir=/sw' '--with-readline'
'--with-t1lib=/sw' '--with-tidy=/sw' '--with-xml' '--with-xmlrpc'
'--with-zlib-dir=/usr' '--without-xpm' '--with-expat-dir=/sw'
'--with-iconv=/usr' '--with-imap=/sw/share/c-client'

   7. Build and install php:

      make
      sudo make install

   8. You should check the Apache configuration at
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf. It should have the following configuration
directives (make sure any directives pertaining to php4 are commented
out):

      nano -w /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

      # php5 support (Apache 1.3 version)
      LoadModule php5_module libexec/httpd/libphp5.so
      AddModule mod_php5.c
      AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
      AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
      DirectoryIndex index.html index.php


   9. Restart apache (sudo apachectl restart) and test for php.

      sudo apachectl restart
      open /Applications/Safari.app http://localhost/path/to/info.php


Should take about four hours given the size of the downloads involved
and the configuration time.

Not really, you don't want to use htmlentities in this situation.  You
are escaping your values into POST data so you should use urlencode, as
in the example below.

The easiest way I've found to do this is as follows:

$myvars = array(
  'item1' => 'value1',
  'item2' => 'value2',
);

$postdata = array();
foreach ($myvars as $k => $v) {
  $postdata[] = urlencode($k) .'=' . urlencode($v);
}
$postdata = implode('&',$postdata);

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $postdata);

By running both your keys and values through urlencode, you'll be sure
that you won't end up with mangled post data, no matter what the values'
contents are.

If you want to be really ahead of the curve you can use
ini_get('arg_separator.output') in place of '&' in the implode.

That's it? WOW! That's just a few lines of code! Thank you!
Now, I need to see how I build the rest of the script around this, which 
shouldn't be that tricky.

This is awesome! Shows how much more I still have to learn. :/

Maybe because it's php5-only?

If you want a php4 version, try this function I just cooked up which
duplicates all the documented functionality of the php5 function.

function http_build_query($formdata,$numeric_prefix = '',$arg_separator
= null,$_parent = null)
{
    if (empty($arg_separator)) {
        $arg_separator = ini_get('arg_separator.output');
    }

    $postdata = array();
    foreach ($formdata as $k => $v) {
        if (!empty($_parent)) {
            $k = $_parent .'['. urlencode($k) .']';
        } else {
            if (is_numeric($k)) {
                $k = $numeric_prefix . $k;
            }
            $k = urlencode($k);
        }
        if (is_array($v)) {
            $postdata[] =
http_build_query($v,$numeric_prefix,$arg_separator,$k);
        } else {
            $postdata[] = $k .'=' . urlencode($v);
        }
    }

    return implode($arg_separator,$postdata);

It has tripped me up before when compiling but just make sure --with- 
zlib appears first in your compile command, not sure why ...

Also based on below you can try --with-zlib-dir=/usr/include

And make sure its up to date (requires zlib >= 1.0.9)

(http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz?download)

Now i am not sure why it cannot find mysql, i installed it with the mac dmg
that mysql offers

configure: error: mysql configure failed. Please check config.log for more
information.

This is the command i am using

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php5 --enable-mbstring --enable-pcntl
--with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs --enable-cli --enable-exif
--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql --with-mbstring --with-zlib-dir=/usr/include
--with-curl

i am not sure because in /usr/local i have an mysql dir and an
mysql-standard-5.0.24a-osx10.4-powerpc-64bit  I am not sure why there are 2

Can anyone tell me what i might be doing wrong here?

Maybe because it's php5-only?

If you want a php4 version, try this function I just cooked up which
duplicates all the documented functionality of the php5 function.

function http_build_query($formdata,$numeric_prefix = '',$arg_separator
= null,$_parent = null) {
    if (empty($arg_separator)) {
        $arg_separator = ini_get('arg_separator.output');
    }

    $postdata = array();
    foreach ($formdata as $k => $v) {
        if (!empty($_parent)) {
            $k = $_parent .'['. urlencode($k) .']';
        } else {
            if (is_numeric($k)) {
                $k = $numeric_prefix . $k;
            }
            $k = urlencode($k);
        }
        if (is_array($v)) {

http_build_query($v,$numeric_prefix,$arg_separator,$k);
        } else {
            $postdata[] = $k .'=' . urlencode($v);
        }
    }

    return implode($arg_separator,$postdata);
}

Yeah, I was going to mention that, but in general I've been underwhelmed
by PHP_Compat.  In this case, it seems to be unnecessarily complicated
and doesn't accept the third $arg_separator argument.

Ok it looks like it cannot find the header files for mysql, i am not sure
why anyone know where these would be on OS X?

I removed the mysql support and it compiles just fine.  However i need the
MySQL support ;(

Use ls -l ... the one named mysql is a symbolic link to the one name
mysql-standard-xxx.

So is there a file at /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config ? Cause that's
what php seems to be having trouble finding.

Based on my experience (and this has worked on at least three Macs),
you need all three of:

'--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql'
'--with-mysql-sock=/private/tmp/mysql.sock'
'--with-mysqli=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config'

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Client vs. Server programming
Message-ID: <20060921213727.3299.qmail@web53305.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I've spent some time developing proficiency in JavaScript and AJAX. Every time
I try to go to the server PHP programming, I end up scratching my head asking
why would anybody program on the server? 

Take form validation, for example. A user registers to a service for the first
time and fills out a registration form. I need to check if the Username is
already taken by someone else. In the JavaScript/AJAX framework the form and
the entire page is available thru the DOM, and I just have a simple query.php
script running on the server to execute queries and send back the result. I
construct the query and AJAX it over to the query.php. If a record with the
same username is found, I alert("...") the user to try it again. The original
form remains on the screen without change. The deal is done.

Not so with the server side programming. The form is submitted to a
process_form.php. Then, if the username already exists in the database, the
script has to rebuild the original form with the previous values filled in by
copying user inputs from the $_POST array back into the HTML for *each* input
field with <?php echo $_POST[] ?>, not to mention session state and other
housekeeping. That seems like a lot of work to implement something so simple.

So what are the advantages of server programming? What what am I missing? 

Thanks 

Leo Kokin

Message-ID: <f1dc81bb0609211446i65dd4a85qb6ae3ef668ddad46@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been running www.StationPlay.com since mid 1999 and I've coming
to the point where I need a partner.

Over the years I've had a few people help me out here and there on
site administration, but I've always done all of the back end work.

Unfortunately, I really haven't had the time to do anything on the
site for the past year or so it's been coasting.

At it's peak StationPlay was getting over a million visitors a month,
but now it's down to about 100,000 a month.

So ... I'm looking for someone to help me bring StationPlay back to
it's full glory and the path of rapid growth.

What I have to offer:

- Knowledge and Experience:
If you're looking to advance your knowledge of web development - I
have plenty to offer. I've been building sites professionally since
1994. Heck - I even taught PHP for Zend :)

- Fame:
Well, I do get a decent amount of traffic.

- Money:
I'd like to be able to say that StationPlay is a major money making
machine, but it's not. It _is_ profitable (advertising revenue minus
hosting fees) but it's more like lunch money. Lets just say I'm not
gonna quite my daytime job anytime soon.
I'm more than happy to share any profit that StationPlay makes with a
partner, but if you're in this purely for the money - please don't
waste my time.

What I want from you as a partner:

First and foremost, time to work on the site. If you're uber busy and
don't have any free time - don't bother.

As far as skills go - I'm assuming you know some PHP (or else why are
you on this list?) and have some programming experience.

Anyone with good graphic skills would be a big plus.

You should also be somewhat familiar with video games in general, but
die hard knowledge is not necessary (though a big plus).

I'm pretty open to anyone who feels they have a lot to offer, so I
don't want to limit myself in advance with a big requirements list.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, send me an email
and we'll chat.

Thanks,

Anyone viewing the page can easily reverse-engineer your code and post
whatever they like to the server.  You can certainly help the user to
enter correct data using client-side code, but because your code is
running in their browser, they are the ones in control.

The only way you can enforce any kind of validation rules is on the
server side, where you are in control.

Well, you're assuming that you have some degree of control over what
implementation of Javascript is running in the browser, and that it
will work the way you expect. These days it seems pretty stable
(disregarding Safari for a moment) but you don't have to go too far
back in the day to find when it wasn't.

Ajax is great, go for it. But as we hashed out on a recent thread
here, don't trust the browser to validate stuff for you, because there
are plenty of ways to submit data to your server that don't involve a
browser or javascript at all. So some programming HAS to be server
side, or you leave yourself wide open to attack.

Users can disable JavaScript.  More crafty individuals can hit your 
server-side
documents using their own client-side forms.

It's a good idea to minimize file requests but validating using basic 
JS or AJAX
requests, but it's foolish to soley rely on it.

And so if javaScript is switched off there is no validation then? You 
will *always* need server-side validation to fall back on...

Yes it involves work (and we make it look so easy ;-)

> So what are the advantages of server programming? What what am I missing? 

Its not an either-or kind of question - ideally you would want to do 
both (especially where validation is concerned).

Its all very well using AJAX but you have to remember that an AJAX call 
may still end up calling a server-side resource at some point. Also, how 
would you handle session data? Yeah, you could do it on the client but 
that's not efficient in terms of bandwidth and also not good for 
scalability.

And regardless of the validation others have noted, if you're simply
taking user input and dumping it to the screen you're in for a world
of hurt.  Here's a quick sample of some of the trouble you could
cause:  http://seoblackhat.com/2006/09/18/best-xss-ever/

And that's just simple html not causing any problems...

Leo:

1. Security --  javascript provides *no* security;

2. Keeping your code private -- I can see your javascript code, can 
you see my php code?

3. Not worrying about what happens when javascript is turned off.

4. Speed -- servers usually process things faster than client side machines.

5. If I want javascript, I can use php to write it -- the reverse isn't true.

6. Resources -- I believe there are more resources for php than for js.

7. Functions -- I believe that there are more functions and thus more 
functionality for php.

8. While 6 & 7 may be arguable, that has been my experience.

9. It has also been my experience that not all javascript is the same 
nor handled the same on all browsers -- however, I may be in error -- 
I just remember reading something to that affect.

10. The only advantage I can see, which is a major one, that that 
javascript can provide more interaction with the user and that 
coupled with ajax (which IS js) becomes a very desirable feature.

But, when all is said and done, it's not a question of php vs 
javascript or css vs html, it's a question of using what language 
"best" fits the problem at hand. And, it's your users and clients who 
make that decision for you.

 From my point of view, PHP is darn easy and very popular. I hate 
programming and I attended classes for C64 Basic (yep!), Logo, ANSI C, 
Assembler, VB6, VB.NET, and Java. C64 BASIC was about what I could wrap my 
brain around, all other languages are just plain awful, especially Java. 
And then came PHP across my way and it just works for me. I think of the 
english verb for the task I want to do and usually that is the keyword to 
use. I did spend some time on learning the basics of HTML, which wasn't 
fun, but necessary.
Of course, I could use some client side scripting, but JavaScript and such 
as just so, well, ununderstandable for someone like me who is more 
proficient in talking to people than abstract programming objects.

Even with all the drawbacks, I think PHP is awesome and server side 
programming just asks for a little bit more thinking sometimes....to find 
out that it won't work, sometimes. Besides that, you can do AJAX using PHP.

Or if it is running at all. The client can switch off JavaScript (ECMA 
Script to be correct) execution at any given time. Switching off PHP on 
your server is a little bit more difficult.

Joseph,

I was having simmilar problem installing php/apache/mysql last week.  My
installation would not work until I went and downloaded mysql.dll and
mysqli.dll from mysql.com.  After that the installation worked.

Sounds to me like you don't understand the distinction between
client-side and server-side, or you're just trolling.

To answer your question directly, if your application was entirely
client-side, then it's pointless to make it a web application, and you
miss out on all of the benefits of this cool thing called the Internet.

Validation is an all-or-nothing thing.  It must be 100% correct all of 
the time or it is wrong.  Your approach allows several ways to send 
invalid data, therefore you cannot guarantee the data is correct.

The only way to maintain a unique list of users is to store them in a 
database with a unique constraint.  If the database allows the user to 
be saved, then you know it is unique.  In any other approach, duplicates 
can get in through accident or intent.

Validating in PHP code is no better.  It is one step closer to the 
database, but two identical users can still register.  This may be 
unlikely for the case at hand, but if you want to get into any real 
money games you've got to be able to provide data integrity guarantees.

The good news is that modifying your code is very simple.  The AJAX call 
sends an insert request to NEWUSER.PHP, which does an insert to the 
database.  If the database returns an error because of a unique 
violation, NEWUSER.PHP passes the error back through AJAX.  If no error, 
you say "Welcome to our site  newuser at monkeycheese.com"

If you are incorporated and paying yourself as an employee, you might 
want to look into those online payroll services. They automatically 
deduct taxes for your your own "payroll" and also 1099's. I use 
powerpayroll.com which used to be called PayMaxx. Costs $26/mo. Prior to 
that, I tried some of the bigger name payroll services like PayChex, but 
was unsatisfied with their service.

There is also a case of where your client will not always be the  
loaded browser you expect (FF, IE, OP) w/ XHR built in ... there are  
many smaller devices w/ non multithread requirements ... of course  
this won't always be the case ... its good to look @ things like how  
the frameworks handle the issue, ie Cake (RequestHandler) or  
something similar which give you options on how to process it.

Im just waiting to see what scheme the open RDBMS come up w/ to  
handle XHR requests on there own (ala no application layer @ all).   
Exists already Im sure.

See this page for some helpful info:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/multiple-unix-servers.html
 
Like Port 80 is generally accepted to be the http/www port, Port 3306 is
usually the expected MySQL port.
And the unix socket path is also usually standardized by default too.
 
But maybe your install(s) specified port and socket different from default.
This is 
considered a security enhancement.
 
In the phpMyAdmin config file(s) for the server connections there are many 
options to fill in so that phpMyAdmin knows exactly how to talk to your
MySQL server;
the port, socket, user name, pwd, database name, host all have to be
accurate.

I vaguely remember you mentioning this before, but I don't have enough 
time to look back in the thread history... are you trying to use the 
mysql extension or mysqli or both?  Also, could you paste me your exact 
configure line?

Thanks,

Rick

MYSQL CONFIG LINE

--with-unix-socket-path=/usr/local/mysql/run/mysql_socket

PHP CONFIG LINE
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php5 --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs

--enable-sockets --enable-exif --enable-ftp --enable-mbregex --with-curl
--with-mysqli=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config --with-zlib-dir=/usr

I am trying to compile in both mysql and mysqli, the php configure line
works without any errors, i was having problems with it not finding mysql
but i fixed that (had to install the binary package for osx and then compile
from source and combine the 2 directories.  The source would have worked but
not with the system prefs panel as some scripts were missing for the startup
stuff.  Now MySQL is running just fine i can login via the command line but
phpMyAdmin says it cannot find the sock.

Thanks,

--with-unix-socket-path=/usr/local/mysql/run/mysql_socket ;;

Try setting mysql.default_socket=/usr/local/mysql/run/mysql_socket in 
php.ini


Hopefully that works.

You may have to expose the port to the outside.  In System Preferences,
click on Sharing, then Firewall.  You may have to add a port there (like
3306) and/or allow "Personal Web Sharing" on Port 80.

I second Rolan's comments on PayChex. I was paying nearly $76/month per 
and dissatisfied frequently with the service levels. I have also had ADP 
process a $90k/month salary level without thinking and not handle the 
subsequent
"problem resolution" attempts very well. Yeah, sure I pay $90k/month to 
an employee. Duh.

By the way, that showed up as a $46k tax witholding... pulled right from 
the checking account. If you ever wondered what it would be like to make 
$1.09 mill per year, I can tell you it's gonna suck at tax time :-)

One thing to watch when you go to any payroll service is the state 
add-on fees.  They correctly show you how they will auto file for you 
various required state forms for HR, EOE and such, and they are correct 
it is a hassle. However, an accountant in your field knows about that 
stuff and files it for you for a lower overall fee in my experience. I 
found it to be a FUD factor used to keep you on a higher cost plan.

Silly Joe.

It was supposed to be $9k but the ADP person keyed in $90. Nobody makes 
$90k/month ;-) and that should have been obvious to them, considering 
they are after all a payroll company.

Message-ID: <6.1.2.0.2.20060923131358.02f2a7e0@pop.snet.yahoo.com>

Hi,

after looking around for a while it appears as that there is no single 
command to move a file from A to B. I know that I can first copy the file 
and then delete the source. In order to do so I'd need to check if the copy 
was successful and then check if the delete was successful. Is that so or 
am I just too dense to read the docs right?

Answering my own question but assuming that this may be interesting for 
some, I am not to dense. OK, that wasn't too interesting, I admit. What is 
interesting is that there is indeed no move function per s?, but I saw at 
http://webxadmin.free.fr/article/php-move-file-211.php that you can abuse 
the rename function to move a file...and potentially rename it at the same 
time.

Rarely found a case where a workaround is better than the desired solution.

Yeah all they would have to do is patch this function:

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.move-uploaded-file.php

To move_file without the _POST/_FILE checks and you would be good to  
go, but I would think its a major security concern to have the www  
user moving files around.

Sounds like the move/rename confusion in a different context. The mv
command has been the target of the same criticism for decades, but the
other way around.

What leads you to believe this is an abuse of rename()?

if you are using *nix you can mv files:

exec("mv /path/to/oldfile /path/to/newFile");

Well, the command says rename, not move_and_rename or sth like that. I 
should have called it "unintended use" or such rather than abuse. I didn't 
think it is evil or bad, but for the not so clever making a command move or 
move_file to be an alias of rename would clear some confusion.

Hi,

         I am not entirely sure what you mean with web board, but if it is 
about some fourm framework, I'd take a look at phpBB. It looks really 
fancy, has many features, works with several databases, and is a freebie. 
Many for profit companies use that as the platform for their support forum. 
I tried it myself and is darn easy to set up.

         David K.

Yes, but using exec to do mv works on the *nix platform. How do I know on 
which OS my script will end up one day. The PHP commands are more likely to 
behave the same and be present. I use the XAMPP on Windoze and may change 
over to a Linux server sometime soon. So, in order to make it work using mv 
I needed to write code to detect the OS and if it is not anything ending in 
nix I need to come up with an alternative.

Besides that, my point is that rename indicates that one can change the 
name of a file, but it doesn't make it even slightly obvious as that it can 
also be used to move a file as well as move and rename it at the same time. 
Many PHP commands are quite descriptive and several have one or more 
aliases. Just thought making "move()" to be an alias of "rename()" woudl be 
nice.

Hi,

         I am not entirely sure what you mean with web board,
but if it is 
about some fourm framework, I'd take a look at phpBB. It looks
really 
fancy, has many features, works with several databases, and is a
freebie. 
Many for profit companies use that as the platform for their
support forum. 
I tried it myself and is darn easy to set up.

I think you might have missed my point. Twice.

I'm not trying to suggest using the mv command (although that should
suffice). Rather, I'm pointing out that it can also be used to rename
things. These operations are the same.

In other words, you seem to be equating a violation of your semantic
preferences to abuse.

That is well possible. And apparently I still don't get it. I guess we 
better leave it at that. Thanks for trying to explain it to me.

David,

I think the point Chris is trying to make is that 'moving' a file is
really just changing the name, in general the operations are the same.

Saying that a.txt is now named b.txt is really the same thing as saying
that /mydir1/a.txt is now named /mydir2/a.txt.

When you 'move' a file it is not actually moved unless you move it from
one drive (whether physical or logical) to another, you're just changing
the name that it is known by.  This is why 'moving' a file is more or
less instantaneous.

On a side note, if you are moving a file from one drive to another the
operation is not really a 'move', it is first copied to the destination
drive then deleted from the source drive.

Ach so!! Why didn't he just say so? I guess he did, I just didn't get it. 
It makes sense and after some refreshing in file system fundamentals it is 
pretty obvious. You just have to use simple words and type slowly so that I 
can understand it. ;) This shows that you can teach an old dog new tricks.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] relative paths in Windope
Message-ID: <6.1.2.0.2.20060924171352.02c59ec0@pop.snet.yahoo.com>

Hi,
although I managed to find a workaround I still wonder how one can make use 
of relative paths on Windows when using commands such as mkdir, rmdir, 
unlink, etc.

For example:
unlink(.\oh11je9qfrh9ns3evmee794qh3\PDRM0660.JPG)
fails with this error
No such file or directory in 
E:\piviviewer\administration\pics\addpictosystem.php on line 276
but the file in the directory in which the script file is located has the 
folder oh11je9qfrh9ns3evmee794qh3 and in that is the file PDRM0660.JPG.

For now I created a function that figures out what the path is to the 
current location by taking the [SCRIPT_FILENAME] of $_SERVER and cutting 
the filename of the current script file off at the end (I vaguely remember 
that there is a better way to do this with some command that just returns 
the path portion) and then combine this with the path and file to be deleted.
That is quite annoying, but using relative paths on Windope doesn't work as 
it seems. Anyone has a better solution (besides dumping Windoof) than to 
massage strings until it fits?

Thank you very much in advance.

That would work as well. What I did is use this
dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'])
in the start file and assigned the output to a session variable. It 
basically gives me the "root" of my entire folder set. This way I can 
always extend the path if needed. Using getcwd will work fine when I deal 
only with things that are in my current directory. In the described case, 
that is so, but I know for sure that I will need the path to point to some 
place that is down a different tree from the root.

Thanks for the tip.

Message-ID: <1159190616.21856.0.camel@localhost>

I'm building an RSS aggregator so I'm trying to find out the best way to
parse users account feeds equally so Lets say we have 20.000 user with
average of 10 feeds in account so we have about
200.000 feed

How would you schedule the parsing process to keep all accounts always
updated without killing the server? NOTE: that some of the 200.000 feeds
might be shared between more than one user

Now, what I was thinking of is to split users into
1-) Idle users (check their account once a week, no traffic on their RSS
feeds)
2-) Idle++ (check their account once a week, but got traffic on their
RSS feeds)
2-) Active users (Check their accounts regularly and they got traffic on
their RSS feeds)

NOTE: The week is just an example but at the end it?s going to be
dynamic ratio

so with this classification I can split the parsing power and time to
1-) 10% idle users
2-) 20% idle++ users
3-) 70% active users.

NOTE: There is another factors that should be included but I don?t want
to get the idea messy now (CPU usage, Memory usage, connectivity issues
(if feed site is down) in general the MAX execution time for the
continues parsing loop shouldn?t be more than 30 minutes 60 minutes)
Actually I?m thinking of writing a daemon to do it ?just keep checking
CPU/memory? and excute whenever a reasonable amount of resource
available without killing the server.


Please elaborate.

I finally setup my localhost to do all dev work with php/mysql. Now I have
my office work pc and home pc (both windows) and a 1gig flash drive to bring
the files back and forth. Does anyone use some kind of data sync software to
make sure you are using the most updated files?  Sometimes I'll forget to
copy an include file to my flash drive then have to wait till the next day
to continue working.

Yup,

Set yourself up a subversion repository, then you can not only keep your
machines in sync but keep track of everything you do.

I'm just starting to figure out SVN for my office projects but for my side
projects I just wanted to sync my files in a few set folders.

I think this may work but I wanted to see what others more experienced had
to say

thanks!

I use SyncBack too - it pushes incrementally changes to a Samba share
automatically.  I have it set to do a fast backup after 5 minutes of idle
time, and a full backup at 4pm everyday.  Quite nice.

realpath() is a handy function too when dealing with relative paths:
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.realpath.php

Also, if you like to type less, there's the "magic" constant __FILE__ 
that will give you the full path to the current file:
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.predefined.php

I often do this:
realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../somefile')

Subversion for work (since its available anywhere via svn+ssh://)
Rsync for incremental backups 

However, Ive learn to *NOT* put too much faith into backup drives (kinda
ironic) after having 3 Lacie drives and a thumbdrive fail after a while
of use. YMMV.  

It may after a while prove pretty useful for online storage to be a
better alternative (gDrive, Amazon S3, etc).  Just need to wait a bit
longer for more sync-like features + better UI.

This might have been asked before but ...

Would there be any way you know of to "filter" these feeds by
application?

My current Mac client (NetNewsWire) can't but maybe there is any client
that can actually filter (regex?) over a feed .. 

Thanks.

Definitely only parse each feed once across the server (not once for 
each user).  I'm sure that would cut down your number a lot from 
200,000.  You should figure out how much processing time it takes to 
parse a feed.  I wouldn't think it would be all that much.  If it 
doesn't take too long for your code to parse a feed, you should just do 
it on demand. 

i.e. - when the user checks their account, loop through their feeds, 
determine if the last time you parsed the feed was longer than xx amount 
of time (like a half hour or hour or something like that) and then 
determine if any of those feeds have changed (maybe by comparing the 
file size of the live version with a cached local copy).  For the ones 
that have changed, pull down the new content, and mark the current time 
as the last updated time for the feed.  I would model feed entries into 
a database table for easy sorting, searching and other stuff like that. 

In terms of the user interface to deal with this possible wait time in 
updating the feeds, you could show the user the latest cached version of 
the feed and then do an ajax call to do the update.

This way of doing it would avoid parsing feeds that no one accesses and 
also avoid having to predict your user's activity.

Not to be a subversion zealot but I've been using it to back up my  
home directory for a while now and it's great. I have a web hosting  
account with dreamhost (that's not a plug nor a recommendation) and  
they have subversion available. I have a directory in my /home called  
mikesfiles and I put things I need backed up in there. All I have to  
do is check the stuff in and out.  It works out for me because I  
never know what state my home pc or my laptop will be in, so it's a  
remote backup solution in a sense.

I'm sure other syncing software can do the job but it really is worth  
it if you know subversion already, because it's F/OSS, and it does  
offer many other options, especially in a case where you have a  
secure remote machine holding your files. It's actually saved my butt  
a few times where I forgot my laptop and needed some files that I had  
in my repo.

Hans Z or Nate or somebody:

Can you elaborate on "bring your laptops?" That is, laptops already AMPed
up and with the latest Cake on board, or what? Or is there gonna be
wireless for all so we can download whatever on the spot?

(I'd have to borrow a machine, so I ask before going to the trouble of
doing that and setting up a dev environment on it.)

It's on the  SW corner of 59th and Madison. You need a photo ID (if 
you have one). The guards will accept a non-picture NJ Drivers 
License if that's all you have.

The IBM building is on the southwest corner of 57th street. You 
should rsvp at http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php and then bring a photo ID.

Hi,

you could set the server root to your USB drive and have MySQL live on that 
drive as well, although based on my development work (which may be quite 
different of yours), the database tends not to change that often and if it 
does, you will notice it quickly by all the failing queries.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [OT] grep assistance
Message-ID: <000d01c6e15f$0f0dc060$6701a8c0@SUNCODE1>

Four grep regular expressions I could use help with...
 
1) match all id numbers between 100 and 199
2) match all id numbers less than 550
3) match all id numbers greater than 550
4) match all id numbers from 0-550, but not 400-480
 
thanks if these are right at your fingertips.
 
 
For extra special, extra credit what is the following regexp expected to
match.
([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[1-3][0-9][0-9]|4[0-6][0-4])$
 
I see it as match any id in several ranges: 1-9, 10-99, 100-399, 400-464.
But there must be a more effective say to say this?

    This is fun.  But it's certainly not a "best practice" way of doing 
things.  (Ask somebody to explain what the #4 regex does...)  I'll take 
a crack at it with PCRE's,  but it's very likely that some of them have 
mistakes on boundary cases.

    If you're working on the UNIX command line,  the easy way to do this 
is with awk.  If you're handling space separated data,  say

775 some data
776 other data

    you can write something like

awk '{if ($1<550} print}'

    awk defaults to space as a separator,  but you can change this with 
the -F option,  say -F: or -F,.  Somebody can look at that command and 
have a pretty clear idea of what it does and a decent chance of doing 
the right thing if 550 changes to 549.

    Note there is a bit of a cheat below in that I'm not considering 
proper fielding...  If you want to match any numbers embedded anywhere 
in the document,  I think you can change ^ -> (^|[^0-9]) and $ -> 
([^0-9]|$).  If you know numbers won't be at the beginning or end of a 
line and will be delimited by spaces,  you can replace ^ and $ with spaces.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Help -- header redirection problem
Message-ID: <000001c6e1b7$5c23e980$7c03a8c0@HirschLaptop>

I have a short script that redirects pages to http or https as required,
but am having problems.
 
The function works fine, but hiccups once output buffering is turned on.
Unfortunately, some redirection can't occur until after output buffering
is on - legacy code.
 
I though redirection should work fine though because I clean the output
buffer as follows:
 
ob_end_clean();
header("Location: https://$path");
exit;
 
Firefox gives me the following error message:
 
The page isn't redirecting properly
Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this
address in a way that will never complete.
This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept
cookies.
 
Any ideas? I'm pulling my hair out.
 
Cliff

I tried the following code just now using multiple URLs, both HTTPS &

have not managed to trigger that error :(

ob_start();
print 'before';
print 'do stuff...';
print 'xxxxxx';
ob_end_clean();
header("Location: https://www.paypal.com");
exit;


Anything else in there that might be causing the problem?

Bork? Is that in the dictionary?!

I just completely isolated the script down to this:

<?
$sslmode = 'https';

This fails, but comment out the last header and exit in the else and it
work. Perhaps I have been borked. Where do I check for
borking/mod_rewrite? Next step is to download PHP 5.1.6 to see if that
solves the problem.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] About Human Readable Variable Names Moving Among PHP,
	HTML and MySQL
Message-ID: <000901c6e220$827786a0$6701a8c0@SUNCODE1>

I'm always attempting a tight level of coordinated, human readable
consistent naming for my data, i.e. I try to:
a) use the same name such as "First Name" on my HTML form, 
b) use that variable name in my PHP script (i.e. $First_Name), and 
c) get the field name in tables in MySQL to match (again i.e. FirstName).
 
When I work on projects that have HTML forms, email confirmations, MySQL
storage, 
and Admin tools that view and sort the data, it is very handy when all the
data variable names 
are uniform and human readable at the same time. This way the onscreen HTML 
display name for data variables can be the actual data name itself, and then
I can 
do less custom work when presenting data to all the users, in any
permutation. 
 
My issues are about the spaces in data names. (To me, spaces is what makes
data names 
human readable.)
 
In MySQL:
I forget, you can use spaces, but should surround in tics, right. Like so:
'First Name'.
 
In PHP:
Can't have spaces.
 
In HTML forms:
Can have spaces, but might cause problems.
 
So I'm just asking for an opinion, do you deal with spaces in variables?
Never use spaces? 
 
Is the problem of spaces just an old legacy, cross platform Windows/Mac/Unix
bad memory I have?

Not recommended. using "_" instead of " " is as readable as " ".

Yeah, so "_" is better solution even here.

> Never use spaces?

Nope, we never use spaces. Instead we use "_". Since PHP doesn't allow  
declaration of variables having space in it, It would be difficult to  
handle data (coming from Forms or stored into Database). I think "_" more  
or less denotes treating it as space.

Hi,

         just for the reasons that you mentioned, I never use spaces in 
variable names. I typically ue the "_" as space replacement. I also tend to 
use telling names. For example:
- I do not use $i, but $counter as counter variable
- I always craft SQL queries as a string first before using it in 
mysql_query. All my query string variables always end in "query". Similar 
for the result of mysql_query which I assign to a variable that has the 
same first portion of the name as the query, but ends in "queryrun". Any 
results if available are assigned to a variable that has the same first 
portion of the name as the query, but ends in "queryresult".
- All variables used in functions are prefixed by "fct_"
- All variables that I get from and / or write back to session are prefixed 
with "session"
- As you indicated, I try to name the form element, the variable that gets 
the value from $_POST, and the table column in the database the same

I think what is more necessary than spaces is to have the variable names 
mean something and consistency in nomenclature. And on top of that, 
document everything in an external document. Of course, comment liberally, 
especially when initializing variables (I initialize all of them at the 
start of a script) add a comment what that variable is for. Add a general 
note where the script gets values from (script name, and if from POST 
and/or SESSION).

My approach isn't perfect, but it keeps myself out of trouble. My variable 
names are David Krings-reable, I have no idea if they are humanly readable 
as so far only one other person ever used any of my scripts (MP3 script 
using the Flash MP3 player from Jeroen Wijering).

IMHO, there are better things to worry about than spaces or no spaces.

         David K.

Peter:

Opinions?

It depends upon what _you_ want to see in _your_ code, unless you're 
working with a team. I've seldom worked with a team, so I'll leave 
that to others to comment.

I use mixed case (i.e, pageNum). I try to keep my variable names 
short and to the point. I never use spaces -- besides, spaces aren't 
consistently allowed anyway.

I try to keep the variable name the same across different languages 
(i.e., $pageNum - php, pageNum - MySQL).

With counters and other temporary/short-scope variables I use i, j, 
k, l (left over from my FORTRAN) days, which is one of the reason I 
use lowercase. Likewise, I never use i, j, k, l for anything but 
short-scope variables.

You say: "To me, spaces is what makes data names human readable."

Not for me, spaces mean to me that these data names aren't variables. 
Just give me a variable that looks like a variable; and a name has 
some relationship to the data they hold; and I'm happy.

If you want to see a problem with names, trying reviewing some of the 
constants that Apple has for it's development (I'm sure they are not 
alone) -- they are approaching the limits for name length.

Another consideration, while I've never had to do it for php, I've 
worked with variable names that were further identified by their 
prefix, such as gPageNum -- meaning that it was a global variable. If 
you have a very large project, you might want to consider using a 
prefix for naming, such that you would know where the variable 
originates.

Chris Shifett (in his book Essential PHP Security -- in my mind, 
required reading) used "$clean" for variables that were sanitized -- 
not a bad idea. I would consider expanding that idea by adding a "c" 
to the front of a sanitized variable, such as $cPageNum.

In any event, whatever scheme you adapt, you're the one who will have 
to live with it. The more consistent and easy for you to identify and 
work with, the better.

A long time ago, a mentor once told me "Be careful picking your 
religion, because you're the one who has to live with it." Wouldn't 
it be interesting if what we believe is what it is?

Without running it, I'd say this script makes an infinite loop. When the
redirect is sent, isn't the else being executed again?

Well, I won't pursue it any further but as has been returned here, I use:
$camelCase, $no_spaces, and a styles of Hungarian notation such as:
$strVariable

I try to avoid $firstname because that leads to: $weatherwithwindspeeds

But, I guess patiently, precisely tracking vars is one of the hearts of the
job.

$final_close_complete="";
$strHheader='Thanks';
$connective_interruptor_symbol_as_verbal_glue=",";
$closerText='ps at pswebcode.com';
$thanks_all='';
$thanks_all.=$strHeader;
$thanks_all.=$connective_interruptor_symbol_as_verbal_glue."\n\r";

Carlos:

Yep -- you the man. I finally figured this out, but you're the first
person that saw it too. 

Was hard to see when it was deeply buried in my application. Lesson
learned -- Cliff, don't call an http/https redirect function twice with
varying conditions you really know what your doing! Translation -- be
careful with that BASIC-style goto code.

Thanks,
Cliff

P.S. But all is not lost. I picked up a new word. I'll try it tonight --
"Hun, you borked the lasagna again."

Camel?

Well... which of the following is the easiest to read?

Arrays don't properly overwrite strings in multi-dimensional arrays.
PHP folks feel that everything works as it should.

Any thoughts?

The reply to the bug is correct,  PHP is doing what its supposed  
to.    When you are executing the line:

$test_array['name'] = 'value';

You are declaring $test_array['name']  as a string.   Then when you  
access that string using brackets you are telling PHP that you want a  
character from that string.  For example:

$test_array['name'][1]

should and would give you 'a'.    The confusing part is that you are  
using a text key.  Since $test_array['name']  is a string,  PHP is  
expecting the value in brackets to be an integer.  Consequently php  
does a type conversion on your 'count' key turning it into 0.  0 in  
this case corresponds to the 'v' in value.  Your statement is  
actually the equivalent of

$test_array['name'][0] = '2';


To "correct" your code, you have to force php to change the type of  
$test_array['name'].  This would be done by reassigning the value to  
array():


$test_array['name'] = array();
$test_array['name']['count'] = '2';



That all being said,  I would agree that PHP could be slightly more  
intelligent and see the fact that you passed a text key.  Seeing that  
you passed a text key,  that would imply you want to type convert  
that element from string to an array.    My guess is that you are  
going to have a tough time convincing anyone to make the modification  
tho.

You are not turning the string into an array. You are overwriting the 
character at position 0. "Array" syntax is how you access an individual 
character in a string (a string is basically an array of characters). If 
you want to ensure that you overwrite the string with an array, then 
force the string to be an array first.

php -r '$s = "string"; settype($s, "array"); $s[0] = 3; var_dump($s);'

Summary: I agree, it is not a bug.

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.58.0609271141220.15377@emra.pair.com>


svn co https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/trunk/cake/1.2.x.x/
svn: SSL is not supported

According to some google research, I should compile Subversion against a
version of neon that has SSL enabled. (I think that's the first time I
even heard of neon -- but then I'm a lightweight, what can i say...)

I'm on Fedora 4 and running the svn that came with the distro (i think --
don't remember compiling my own). So... do I really have to do all this
wget whatever.tar.gz/tar -xzf whatever /cd whatever-x.x.x/configure
--with-whatever/make/sudo make install or is there any easier way? Should
I first erase my current svn package via yum?

The goal is simply to get CakePHP 1.2 so this seems like a lot of
hoop-jumping.

Thanks much!

If you want to be on the safe side just unpack it and do something like 

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/svn --with-ssl 
/usr/local/svn/svn co https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/branches/1.2.x.x/
cake1.2

(It's only available currently in the ~branches~ dir @ the moment)

You should be fine compiling svn on your own to get the binary going if
you already don't have a subversion repository on that box.

If installed it's already updated to the latest version.

$rpm -qa | grep ssl

should list it's rpm /version info.

try:

subversion [not svn]

(go figure)

FWIW:
I'm using FC5+ and don't have any problem with svn client and https urls.

Also, a centos4.3 (clone of FC3) box also works without incident.

go with camelCase.  very easy to read once you start working with it

built-in wiki functionality allows for camelCasing (might be a plugin) 
and you can help integrate documentation of projects with your code 
repository.

now if we could just get rid of that Hungarian notation.....

Why not be consistent and make the"w" be upper case as well
$WillGoBackUnderMySteamyPileNow = true;

...and spelling variable names correctly is a plus as well. I wouldn?t 
count on mistyping it every time. ;) I can?t tell you how often I borked my

I downloaded the svn 1.4.0 tarball and the deps, unpacked them into the
same dir, and ./configure --with-ssl threw an error "... configure failed

You sure those are the magic words? Ain't working for me.

Maybe the problem is that
https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/branches/1.2.x.x/cake1.2 actually doesn't
exist.

If you open it in a web browser and poke around a little, you'll see
that the correct url is:

https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/branches/1.2.x.x/cake/

This works:

I think Jon B. said

   svn co https://svn.cakephp.org/repo/branches/1.2.x.x/cake1.2

and there is a 'cake' subdir, turally, but not cake1.2

Ahhh, now you touched on another subject, which is how do you name functions?

I've seen code (not that I practice it) where functions names begin 
with uppercase whereas variables do not.

Again, it's what makes sense to you, or your team. It's similar to 
formatting, which only leads to "Where do you put the brace?" 
discussions -- no right, no wrong, just what works for you.

i am a bit confused how you can share the mouse and keyboard between
machines without special hardware, do you split the cable 2-3 ways with
splitters and connect to each machine?  Obviously if the mouse or keyboard
is not connected to the machine you cannot use it on that machine.

I thought the only way to do this was with a KVM switch

Thanks,

Synergy works via your network. Basically you have a client/server 
setup. So on the machine you have your keyboard and mouse plugged into 
you run the Synergy server, on the machine you want to use that mouse 
and keyboard you connect to that server. It is quite fantastic. I have a 
setup with a KVM as well, letting me develop on my linux box on dual 
monitors, however have the ability to switch to my windows box at any 
moment and still move my mouse from screen to screen sharing the 
clipboard at will. Synergy is absolutely fantastic.

Out of curiousity, did you try 'yum install subversion'?

Svn, apr, neon, etc seem to be updated on a regular basis, and having
the packages installed would free you from having to recompile with
each new release... 'yum update' and you're done.

yum is the best thing to happen to red hat, ever.

Some people reserve capitalized variables for class names only, so  
that function names and variable names will always start with a small  
letter:

class NutJob {
	var $crazyPerson = "billy";
	function whackCrazyPersonOverTheHead(person) { ... }
}

Seems like a good practice to me.

I have this same problem.  One thing I have found to help is using an  
auto-complete feature in my text editor.  Not only has it saved me  
typing time, but also I don't spend as much time debugging, only to  
find I misspelled some huge variable name.  I know jEdit has auto- 
complete, probably Eclipse, too...

I personally like to use compact variable names, and keep them as tightly
scoped as possible. In fact, I don't recall the last time I used a variable
whose length was more than 10 characters - it's just not necessary in my
opinion.

I also come from a C/C++ background, so I tend to think of everything in
lowercase - only capitalizing when using external libraries that someone
else wrote.

You would think. That's the whole point, ain't it.

> yum is the best thing to happen to red hat, ever.

Historically it's been good to me, but lately I get disappointed a lot.
Might it have to do with the phasing-out of FC 4? Maybe the entries in my
/etc/yum.repos.d are wanting.

I use Enginsite PHP Editor, which has a hint function upon pressing Control 
+ Space. A real autocomplete would be much nicer, but that is asking a bit 
too much for a PHP IDE under 100$. I tried the Eclipse based PHP IDEs and I 
somehow don't like it. It is really obvious that Eclipse wasn't designed 
with PHP in mind. I like Zend, but that is by far too expensive for hobby 
use...at least for me.

Looks like support has been moved to Fedora Legacy Project:
http://www.fedoralegacy.org/

Fedora Legacy is another very good thing. I still have an (inherited)
RH8 server in production.

Ok, sorry for all the OT, folks.

Hello,


I have a quick question, I have a client that needs a shopping cart, that's
not a big deal, the thing is that he wants the customers to be able to pick
a sign size from a list, the font color, color of sign which is no big it
can just be pull downs as they are specific size colors etc, after they are
done customizing the products hit a preview button and have an image
generated of the sign they wanted. And have the image saved as an EPS file.

Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated, I think I saw a site using
OSCommerce doing something like this, is this a plug in for OSCommerce? 

Thanks.

ER

Hello,

I am not sure if php can generate EPS files if so it probably uses a 3rd
party library like the GD Library, i am not even sure if GD can do EPS
files.  However you would have to custom code something (if an osCommerce
extension does not exist)

If you could use a PNG or JPG file then i would look into using the GD
Library but a quick google search did not turn up anything for EPS Files
with PHP.

Thanks,

Thank you for the reply Joseph,

 

I think ImageMagic can generate EPS files, I remember reading something
about it, will have to go back and look into that.

 

Again thank you.

Synergy is basically a "software KVM" - as long as the machines can talk 
TCP/IP to each other, they can use it.

Also, if your "master" machine is a Mac, there is a nice GUI for it.

A Perl script (oh, the horrors!) that can turn just about anything into just
about anything else.  I've used it before for .eps files.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Cake PHP and "Active Records"
Message-ID: <451C8168.7030409@devonianfarm.com>

    I greatly enjoyed the talk about Cake.

    I've been thinking a lot about "Active Records" as a part of web 
frameworks.  There are quite a few ways to implement them and they all 
have some strengths and weaknesses.  I'm convinced that we need active 
records to simplify the writing of secure and maintainable code,  but 
there's still an impedance mismatch between SQL and objects.

    Cake's model has a lot of vertical integration with the rest of the 
framework,  which helps in the rapid development department.  As I 
understand it,  developers build out a number of classes that extend 
AppModel.  They can add methods to define actions on the model,  
override methods to change behaviors,  and define a few variables to set 
metadata.

    One of the interesting questions is early loading versus lazy 
loading.  The Active Record from Ruby on Rails,  for instance,  lazy 
loads everything and caches nothing.  When you ask for 'User.name',  
Ruby immediately does something like

SELECT name from user where id=66;

    This is elegant.  It may even be efficient when we can avoid 
SELECTing big values (say the text of a blog post.)  Unfortunately,  it 
takes six SELECT statements to get the value of six columns for a single 
row,  and 60 SELECT statements to get those values for ten columns (say 
to see the last ten blog posts.)

    I've been playing around with something I call a "passive record";  
like RoR,  passive records get their behaviors determined by run-time 
introspection of the database.  You don't subclass passive_record to 
represent classes:  this is one less thing for you to maintain,  but you 
do lose a good extension point.  The code looks something like

// may be something like $user_table=$factory->table in the future
$user_table=new locust_passive_table($conn,"user",");
$user=$user_table->fetch_record($user_id);

echo $user->first_name;

   $conn,  by the way,  is an instance of an OO database access library 
I've written.  It's got some nice features:  you can say

$conn->select_scalar("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ..");
$conn->select_scalars("SELECT measurement FROM measurements");

    Column values are held in a protected array,  access to variables 
like first_name goes through "magic"  __get and __set methods.  (This 
enables a ~sweet~ syntax.)  If you want to make changes to the record,  
you can do something like

$user->first_name="Bozo";
$user->last_name="Clown";
$user->update();

    Now there are interesting questions:  the easy way to implement 
update() is to do something like

UPDATE user SET first_name='Bozo',... WHERE user_id=$user_id

    iterating over ALL the columns in the row to generate the SET 
clause.  This sets you up for "lost update" problems,  however.

Let's imagine that Bozo is updating his user record,  and that

user.suspended="n" in the database before the above code gets called.

     in the process that's doing the above.  Imagine that a sysadmin 
uses a PHP script to suspend Bozo's access...

$user->suspended="y";
$user->update();

      after the first process does fetch_record() and before the first 
process does update().  As a result of this race condition,  "Bozo" 
unsuspends himself,  a bad outcome.

    One answer to this problem is to keep track of which variables have 
been "touched",  and flush out only the ones that have been "touched".  
This isn't very hard to do.  It doesn't eliminate every possible "lost 
update" situation,  but it eliminates many of them.

   Since RoR does SELECTs and UPDATEs as you get and set variables,  it 
avoids much of this trouble,  but opens up another can of worms.   If 
you're not using transactions (or if you're running the READ COMMITTED 
isolation levels),  other processes can see intermediate states.  
Another process might see a new first name and an old last name:  once 
again,  a source of strange,  hard to understand and fix bugs.  If you 
are using transactions,  you're forcing the database to hold the 
"transaction window" open for longer,  which slows the database down and 
increases the risk of failed transactions and deadlocks.

    It looks like Cake uses early loading quite consistently...  Looking at

http://manual.cakephp.org/chapter/models

if I do

$user = $this->User->read(null, '25')

    for a user who is linked to a comment table,  I'd get back an array 
of comments,  so I can do something like

echo $user["comments"]["5"]["body"];

    If I wanted to display a list of (selected) users,  I might want to 
display the number of comments that they've made,  and I could do that 
by doing

echo count($user["comments"]);

    This is quite intuitive.  It's even reasonably efficient if a user 
has,  say,  3 comments,  but it would be quite slow for a user who has 
800 comments.  Efficiency demands that the database do the counting work 
in this case...  I don't really care if it's done by:

(1) A COUNT(*) generated for every user row,
(2) A JOIN/GROUP BY/COUNT(*) over the user and comment rows,  or
(3) A sub-select over comment inside the select on user,

but it's essential that a framework lets me do this.  It would be nice 
if the framework did 1,  2 or 3 automatically,  but I could live with it 
if I had to do (1) manually,  either in SQL or via the framework.

It's straightforward to implement lazy loading if you're using __get and 
__set...  In that case,  you don't even need to look at related tables 
until a user asks a question about them,  say,...

$user->count("comments");

or asks for $user->comments[3]->body.  In the latter case,  there are 
two places where we can lazy load:  (i) when the user asks for the 
comments[] array,  and (ii) when the user asks for the "body" property 
of $user->comments[3].  As always,  we've got a choices...  We can

(A) populate the comments array with fully-formed passive_records when 
we create it (one SELECT),  or
(B) create a number of "empty" passive_records that contain a comment id 
and lazy-load the rest of the variables when needed.

    Which one is best depends on your case...  If you want them all,  
(A) makes a lot of sense.  If you want to look at the first 10 
comments,  (B) works better,  but this is still going to be slower than 
the old-fashioned way with

SELECT * FROM comments WHERE user_id LIMIT 10...

    Although I suppose you could add some special method to do

$comments=$user->fetch_related("comments",10);

    My feeling about this is that I can't accept an "Active Record" 
implementation that (sometimes) uses the database in an outrageously 
inefficient way.  I might trade a factor of 2 for convenience,  but you 
can certainly get into situations where the RoR way and the PHPCake way 
could cost you a factor of 10 or more.  I have to admit that I really 
don't know the answer.

    Something I really admire from the Java Spring Framework is a JDBC 
wrapper which throws named exceptions for database errors:  see

http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/dao/DataAccessException.html

    My current $conn object lets me do

try {
   $conn->query("INSERT ..."
} catch(DuplicateKeySQLException e)

     and that's really nice.  It would be nice to have a fleshed-out 
hiearchy of exceptions for database errors to make error handling a snap.

   No,  it doesn't match 779.  This is why awk is a better way to do 
this than grep...  It's too hard to understand what these regexes do and 
too easy to make a mistake writing them.

I think the one slick point that gets missed w/ Cake is the fact that  
you can effectively bind and unbind your associations @ any time and  
in any way you wish (paying attention to the default association sql  
query it uses) ... this is a bit more advanced topic but basically  
your right + RoR can do it because the entire language is dynamic @  
runtime ...

Im still learning about this more but there is definitely a step @  
the end of your application Id call "Tweaking and Optimizing your  
Models" which is pretty absent right now.

Out of the box its a very basic structure but much like you would  
have a DBA tune a Stored Proc, you would/could do the same to Cake  
models.  From what Nate said is that it will be made an easier  
process in 1.2 ...

The 'passive record' idea sounds pretty interesting + I think you  
would be able to do something like this w/ a behavior + beforeFind()  
hooks.

Also the Set::map($model) stuff should help w/ doing the same __get()  
__set() magic on your own models.  Im pretty sure it will be a useful  
item all around.

He is right, awk for a number range works wonders ...

echo "123" | awk '//{n=$1;if(n>100 && n<200)print}'

There is a good discussion on the qcodo site of
"Active Record" implementations. Specifically
comparing the RoR (and Cake) metaprogramming vs direct
code generation.

What is the significance of the '::' notation in functions?  It seems to
appear in PEAR, as in PEAR::isError()
<http://pear.php.net/manual/en/core.pear.pear.iserror.php> , but I have also
seen it in Seagull, which is based upon PEAR.  I assume it is not a part of
pure PHP since it doesn't appear in any of the indices in the PHP books I
have read.  I have not found an explanation of this notation in the PEAR
Manual.

It is used to call methods statically and it is part of "pure" PHP.

I assume the point of converting to EPS is so the text is in vector
format and can therefore be enlarged indefinitely without loss of
quality.

Whatever you use to generate the image, be sure that the text isn't
rasterized (converted to bitmap) before you export. It seems like the
pslib functions (http://us2.php.net/ps) or any of the PDF-generating
tools that have been mentioned here before might be a better way to go
than either GD or ImageMagick.

<snip>
   One of the interesting questions is early loading versus lazy
loading.  The Active Record from Ruby on Rails,  for instance,  lazy
loads everything and caches nothing.  When you ask for 'User.name',
Ruby immediately does something like

SELECT name from user where id=66;
</snip>


Actually, in Rails the following occurs:

FYI, you can't do this. User is a class, so you need to first find an
user object whose attributes you want to get the records for.

>> user = User.find(1)

This will execute the SQL query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE (users.id = 1) LIMIT 1

>> puts user.name
=> derek

This will execute the SQL query:
SHOW FIELDS FROM users

BUT... Only in development mode. On production it caches this info and
no sql is executed

>> puts user.email
=> devrieda at gmail.com

now, no SQL query is executed. We've already introspected the db.


As far as eager loading sql queries, Rails has a method of doing this.
The sql for finding all comments could be written as

>> user = User.find(1, :include => :comments)

This would generate a single sql query to retrieve the user and all
associated comments so that you can now do:

>> for comment in user.comments
>>   puts comment.body
>> end

This can also cascade as much as you want and continues to only
perform one db query.

>> user = User.find(1, :include=>{:posts=>[:comments, :categorizations]})

a better explanation of how it works can be found here:
http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2006/02/21/eager-loading-with-cascaded-associations

This is very possible in php, and I've written an implementation of
ActiveRecord in PHP that uses the following syntax:

>> $user = User::find(1, array('include' => array('posts' =>
array('comments', 'categorizations'))));

which can do something like this with the resulting data:
>> foreach ($user->posts as $post) {
>>     print $post->title;
>>
>>     foreach ($post->comments as $comment) {
>>         print $comment->body;
>>     }
>>     foreach ($post->categorizations as $comment) {
>>         print $categorizations->name;
>>     }
>> }

not terribly pretty with all the array(array(array())), but it's what
we have to work with in PHP. this can get slow when there are many
associations for the active record objects, and many records are being
loaded from the db. Our own application however doesn't seem to have
any problems because we tend to use paging on any items that tend to
appear in sets greater than 250 records in the interface.

This already works in CakePHP ...

The DESCRIBE TABLE is performed and cached under /tmp/models (describing
the table structure only once)

You can also optimize your cascades by specifically telling the model
what you want from the join, ie:

$this->Model->findAll(null, array("Model.col1","OtherModel.col3"));

On your view use pr($this->_viewVars) and you will see the object
layout.

So in a nutshell, its pretty identical to RoR.

<snip>
   One of the interesting questions is early loading versus lazy
loading.  The Active Record from Ruby on Rails,  for instance,  lazy
loads everything and caches nothing.  When you ask for 'User.name', Ruby
immediately does something like

SELECT name from user where id=66;
</snip>


Actually, in Rails the following occurs:

>> User.name
NoMethodError: undefined method `name' for User:Class
        from
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-1.14.4/lib/active_record/

I assume the point of converting to EPS is so the text is in vector
format and can therefore be enlarged indefinitely without loss of
quality.

Whatever you use to generate the image, be sure that the text isn't
rasterized (converted to bitmap) before you export. It seems like the
pslib functions (http://us2.php.net/ps) or any of the PDF-generating
tools that have been mentioned here before might be a better way to go
than either GD or ImageMagick.

Sure - this is a software solution so you can use whatever hardware you

Hey Guys,

I am running wordpress 2.0 on my site josephcrawford.com and i notice that
when i post images in the entries they are not showing in the rss.

http://www.josephcrawford.com/rss/

however sites like TUAW do

http://www.tuaw.com/rss.xml

are they writing custom code or is there a way to do this with wordpress 2.0
?

Joseph,

If by "showing in the RSS" you mean the enclosure element, I think you 
need to make the image or mp3 or whatever an link with an absolute url 
to the file.
Check out my test post:

http://blog.classyfeeds.com/rss2/

I just added a link in the body of the post to the absolute url of the 
file and Wordpress created the enclosure.
This is WP 2.0

Hi folks!

I'm happy to be coming down to NYPHP in January:
http://www.nyphp.org/content/calendar/view_entry.php?id=98

I'd love to get some feedback on what people would like me to focus on  
for the talk. The blurb posted is a shorter, updated version of the  
tutorial I did at NYPHPCon. Requests, comments, etc. would all be very  
helpful.

Thanks,
