</I>&gt;<i> following example, which I often see:

</I>
This is really a big problem within our community. I can't think of a 
more obvious XSS vulnerability, but here it is in an article that 
numerous developers will read and apply to their own development.

In the past, I have made a conscious effort to contact the author of any 
article that teaches poor practices like this, but I very rarely get a 
response. I can only think of one article that was ever corrected - Zend 
removed one of their articles at my request. I've considered blogging 
about (or otherwise making public) the problems with an article such as 
this, but I don't like to spread unfriendliness - after all, the 
friendly nature of the PHP community is what I like about it.

&gt;<i> First, can't $_POST['email'] create an error, since on first pass,
</I>&gt;<i> the 'email' key would not exist.
</I>
Yes, and although there are many ways to deal with this, none have ever 
seemed very elegant to me. The lesser of evils is to initialize elements 
within $_POST that you reference in this way, but I don't like modifying 
anything in $_POST, ever. I often see people using error supression, 
which I really hate:

&lt;?=@$_POST['email']?&gt;

In fact, this was in some courseware from which I was teaching once. I 
couldn't believe it. Not only is it not a very good practice to be 
teaching, but imagine being new to PHP and trying to digest that 
statement one character at a time:

&lt;
?
=
@
$
_

Good grief!

If I wanted to write code like that, I'd be using Perl. :-)

&gt;<i> Second, how do you set default values? You would be setting the
</I>&gt;<i> Post array, which changes the source of the value from a form post
</I>&gt;<i> to a program. Doesn't seem right to me.
</I>
Me neither. :-)

&gt;<i> Third, if you do want to &quot;scrub&quot; the input, that implies modifying
</I>&gt;<i> $_POST['something'], which is in direct conflict with Chris
</I>&gt;<i> Shiflett's $clean_array approach.
</I>
I think this article neither filters input nor escapes output, despite 
the fact that it's supposed to be an article about input filtering.

&gt;<i> Ok, so what's the harm in letting a user send him/herself a
</I>&gt;<i> potential &lt;nastystuff&gt; script -- still seems wrong to me.
</I>
I usually give examples that use $_GET in an attempt to solicit this 
question - who cares if the user attacks himself? Well, with $_GET, 
clearly the malicious content can be embedded in a link to your 
application. With $_POST, it's not quite as easy, but it's still 
possible - a &quot;link&quot; to your application can really be a form submission.

So, it sounds like you have good instincts. :-)
