<PRE>I think you are bringing up some good points.
For example, at one of my previous jobs I had written a lot of objects 
with functions that operated on $this keywords. Many of the functions 
&quot;needed&quot; to be accessed in a static way like Class :: function(); and 
$this doesn't cut it. So I had to rewrite them. Instantiating classes in 
PHP used to be slow.

Where OOP can shine is when you think in terms of Business Objects and 
Business Logic. And a lot of non-programmers , who pay your salary, do. 
Flowcharts, forms, datasets all can be mapped easily to components that 
can be serialized and reused. Not only that, it's easier to abstract 
these terms to the point where there is code generation. PHP might have 
some cool procedures, but they are likely difficult to reuse with a 
simple include() statement.
That being said, sometimes OOP is just a way to give a set of functions 
a namespace.

I mix functional and OOP programming depending on context, and I try to 
be careful when I use OOP not to require instatiation on helper or  
utility functions.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have long been a fan of PEAR (and other external / third-party)

</I>&gt;<i>In other words: bang it out, test it, ship it, receive feedback, fix it,
</I>&gt;<i>and then back to the beginning again, or: huge design upfront, OO or
</I>&gt;<i>functionized code,UML diagrams, and the 'f' word: a framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I personally cannot write strictly procedural code any more, and I
</I>&gt;<i>prefer a mix of functionized and OO code. Still, real world applications
</I>&gt;<i>- popular real world applications, often totally avoid this approach.
</I>&gt;<i>So, what gives?
