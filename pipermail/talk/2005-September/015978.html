</I>Hi jay.

As someone who works with alot of other people's code, I used to always 
want to re-write stuff rather than learn-and-then-hack with it. It seemd 
like the best aproach in the long term, for everyon einvlved (client, 
maintainers, mission).

I was wrong.

There is alot of cognitive overhead to classes and frameworks. If you 
have to step into an app, you need to get to a point where you can 
visualize the framework before you can be sure of the consequences of 
changes, right? That's a big headache for a highly-utilized yet 
infrequently-modified system.

With procedural code, a new coder can step through it rather easily and 
be pretty sure of the consequences of change... the places where scope 
is ill-defined or dependencies exists pop out at you.

I know I am way out on the fringe when it comes to professional PHP 
coding, but I can understand when an older app with a large community 
sticks with an existing procedural code base. It makes alot of sense to 
me, given the circumstances. Of course, every situation will put its own 
weights on those factors.
