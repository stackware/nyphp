<PRE>You know, I've never understood the &quot;real programmers&quot; &quot;real
languages&quot; &quot;real databases&quot; debate thing. If a technology meets your
needs, does what you want, and makes you more marketable because you
acquire skills that are in demand, *who cares* what idiots like this
think?

*Real* programmers adapt and learn whatever languages they need to
stay competitive in their field. They learn whatever is popular. When
VB was popular, we all leanred VB, when C++ was all the rage we
learned C++. Now that so much is moving to the web, PHP and MySQL are
in high demand. It would be career suicide for a programmer to ignore
those technologies because a few people feel they aren't *real*
somehow. The checks I get in the mail for programming in PHP sure feel
real to me.

&gt;<i> Hey everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Check out this article.  It is a huge slam on the LAMP framework.  It
</I>&gt;<i> may be worth our collective response.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The article is titled:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why the light has gone out on LAMP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Written by:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.develix.com/frog/user/cliff/article/2006-06-04/9">http://blog.develix.com/frog/user/cliff/article/2006-06-04/9</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bits and pieces from the article:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm quite opposed to using MySQL and PHP, and I'm none too fond of
</I>&gt;<i> Apache. Anyone who knows me or happens into a conversation with me
</I>&gt;<i> about development quickly learns of my distaste for these particular
</I>&gt;<i> projects. To be fair, Apache is the least problematic of the three and
</I>&gt;<i> if there were no alternatives, I'd use it without a lot of complaint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL and PHP, on the other hand, really raise my ire. Both of them
</I>&gt;<i> have two major problems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Bug ridden (by this I am including both misfeatures as well as
</I>&gt;<i> actual bugs).
</I>&gt;<i> 2. They encourage bad habits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PHP is another sore spot for me. I've gotten to the point that not only
</I>&gt;<i> will I not write PHP code, I won't even run applications written in PHP
</I>&gt;<i> (my long search for decent blogging software was due to the restriction
</I>&gt;<i> that it not be written in PHP). At some level PHP is a great language
</I>&gt;<i> because the entry cost is so low. Not so much because the language is
</I>&gt;<i> so particularly friendly, but because it was designed to work in an
</I>&gt;<i> extremely simple environment (the web) and because it's quite possible
</I>&gt;<i> to learn PHP incrementally by intermixing it with HTML. So what's the
</I>&gt;<i> problem? Well, first of all, as anyone who's done much web programming
</I>&gt;<i> will tell you, mixing code with markup is *not* a good thing if you
</I>&gt;<i> care about maintenance or extensibility. The very thing that makes PHP
</I>&gt;<i> a great language for beginners is the very thing that makes it a bad
</I>&gt;<i> language for beginners. At some point they will have to unlearn those
</I>&gt;<i> habits, except that usually they don't. Also, because it's so easy to
</I>&gt;<i> whip out a quick PHP webapp, many, if not most, PHP programmers fail to
</I>&gt;<i> delve very deep into the realm of programming, preferring to sit at the
</I>&gt;<i> edge and reap the benefits without the work (I'm not talking about
</I>&gt;<i> coding work, rather the work of understanding your field). PHP
</I>&gt;<i> programmers practically popularized the most common attack in the
</I>&gt;<i> world, the SQL-injection attack. Not only is it the most common, it's
</I>&gt;<i> the most easily avoided. That's how shallow most PHP-programmer's
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge is. &quot;Professional&quot; programmers are still assembling SQL
</I>&gt;<i> queries by concatenating strings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PHP and MySQL are this generation's BASIC, the language that was
</I>&gt;<i> described thusly by the Free Online Dictionary of Computing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BASIC has become the leading cause of brain-damage in proto-hackers.
</I>&gt;<i> This is another case (like Pascal) of the cascading lossage that
</I>&gt;<i> happens when a language deliberately designed as an educational toy
</I>&gt;<i> gets taken too seriously. A novice can write short BASIC programs (on
</I>&gt;<i> the order of 10-20 lines) very easily; writing anything longer is (a)
</I>&gt;<i> very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make it harder to
</I>&gt;<i> use more powerful languages well. This wouldn't be so bad if historical
</I>&gt;<i> accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros. As it is, it
</I>&gt;<i> ruins thousands of potential wizards a year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Replace BASIC with PHP or MySQL and you've got today's most common
</I>&gt;<i> programmer. Worse, the most common programs in existence today mix the
</I>&gt;<i> two in a brain-freezing mixture of stupidity.
