<PRE>

Keeping the user apprised of progress in the back end... Sounds like a
candidate for AJAXification, doesn't it? You could have some Javascript
send an XmlHttpRequest to a back end that reports progress, and update DIV
element with progress information. No? (I'm tentative b/c I'm an AJAX
newbie at best).

More generally, a few months ago I tried writing something similar to what
Robin is attempting and discovered that (at least for me, under my set of
constraints) it was a lot harder than it should have been. The shared host
(pair Networks) doesn't want people mass-emailing with their system, CLI
or otherwise. So I tried running it from my very own box instead, but
because I am clueless and do not have a properly configured mail server,
things were going out with malformed headers and being identified as spam
by a lot of systems on the receiving end, and I got my IP blacklisted by
SpamHaus et al.

The PEAR Mail_Queue class is nice but there's something peculiar to me
about saving the very same message text n times, once for each recipient.
Why?
