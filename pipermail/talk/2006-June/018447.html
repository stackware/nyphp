&gt;<i> MySQL and PHP, on the other hand, really raise my ire. Both of them 
</I>&gt;<i> have two major problems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Bug ridden (by this I am including both misfeatures as well as 
</I>&gt;<i> actual bugs).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Unlike Microsoft/Sun/IBM software? Should we dive into Java's internal 
memory management? Microsoft's excellent security record?...

&gt;<i> 2. They encourage bad habits.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Most languages support GOTO and do not require you to comment, and your 
code will still compile/run.
Any OO language can be used as a glorified wrapper for a bunch of functions.

&gt;<i> and because it's quite possible 
</I>&gt;<i> to learn PHP incrementally by intermixing it with HTML. 
</I>Its also possible to learn ASP by doing that same thing.
In the matter of fact, its possible to be stupid with any programming 
language/environment.


&gt;<i> So what's the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem? Well, first of all, as anyone who's done much web programming 
</I>&gt;<i> will tell you, mixing code with markup is *not* a good thing if you 
</I>&gt;<i> care about maintenance or extensibility. The very thing that makes PHP 
</I>&gt;<i> a great language for beginners is the very thing that makes it a bad 
</I>&gt;<i> language for beginners. At some point they will have to unlearn those 
</I>&gt;<i> habits, except that usually they don't. Also, because it's so easy to 
</I>&gt;<i> whip out a quick PHP webapp, many, if not most, PHP programmers fail to 
</I>&gt;<i> delve very deep into the realm of programming, preferring to sit at the 
</I>&gt;<i> edge and reap the benefits without the work (I'm not talking about 
</I>&gt;<i> coding work, rather the work of understanding your field). 
</I>Im sorry, WTF?... Looked at MediaWiki source much? Joomla?..
Hell, I can paste some code too which doesnt look like BASIC...




&gt;<i> PHP 
</I>&gt;<i> programmers practically popularized the most common attack in the 
</I>&gt;<i> world, the SQL-injection attack. Not only is it the most common, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> the most easily avoided. That's how shallow most PHP-programmer's 
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge is. &quot;Professional&quot; programmers are still assembling SQL 
</I>&gt;<i> queries by concatenating strings.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I love the &quot;most php programmers&quot; part.
I got another great one, &quot;most people are born with sub-standard 
intelligence level&quot;.
That one is also hard to argue for/against...

&gt;<i> PHP and MySQL are this generation's BASIC, the language that was 
</I>&gt;<i> described thusly by the Free Online Dictionary of Computing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BASIC has become the leading cause of brain-damage in proto-hackers. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is another case (like Pascal) of the cascading lossage that 
</I>&gt;<i> happens when a language deliberately designed as an educational toy 
</I>&gt;<i> gets taken too seriously. A novice can write short BASIC programs (on 
</I>&gt;<i> the order of 10-20 lines) very easily; writing anything longer is (a) 
</I>&gt;<i> very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make it harder to 
</I>&gt;<i> use more powerful languages well. This wouldn't be so bad if historical 
</I>&gt;<i> accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros. As it is, it 
</I>&gt;<i> ruins thousands of potential wizards a year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Replace BASIC with PHP or MySQL and you've got today's most common 
</I>&gt;<i> programmer. Worse, the most common programs in existence today mix the 
</I>&gt;<i> two in a brain-freezing mixture of stupidity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
