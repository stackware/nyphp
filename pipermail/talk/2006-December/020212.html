</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We are developing two new web programming courses at NCC, and we need 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some statements from people in management and leadership positions in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IT to support the need for these courses, which will teach HTML, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JavaScript, CSS, PHP, JSP, and RDBMS interaction with MySQL.  If you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feel you can help, please e-mail me, and I'll send you the proposed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course outlines.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something that I notice is often missing in whole or in part is an 
</I>&gt;<i> appreciation of architecture-level concerns.  In other words, people are 
</I>&gt;<i> often taught how to code, but not *what* to code or *where*.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> critical issues of where to place code between the tiers, and how to 
</I>&gt;<i> make such judgements, are often lacking. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another factor that often seems to be missing, strange as it seems, is 
</I>&gt;<i> the simple idea that all programs serve human goals.  In other words, 
</I>&gt;<i> some person somewhere is committing time and money to a system, and 
</I>&gt;<i> almost always it is for the purpose of gain.  While a good programmer 
</I>&gt;<i> will take pride in the quality of his craftsmanship, it often seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> be missing to take pride in serving the needs of the non-programmer who 
</I>&gt;<i> is depending on you.  While this may seem a &quot;soft&quot; issue compared to the 
</I>&gt;<i> nuts-and-bolts of PHP or SQL, it separates a useful employee from a 
</I>&gt;<i> useless one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With those two ideas in mind, a personal beef of mine is the lack of 
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of what a database is and what it can do, so I'm always in 
</I>&gt;<i> favor of more emphasis in that area.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, and this may seem strangest of all, the three most productive 
</I>&gt;<i> employees I've ever had knew nothing of our particular technology when I 
</I>&gt;<i> hired them.  In each case I hired and attitude and an aptitude and then 
</I>&gt;<i> showed them the language we were using and put them to work.  None of 
</I>&gt;<i> them was uneducated, I'm not suggesting no education was needed, but all 
</I>&gt;<i> of them were well grounded in general principles.  It seems the course 
</I>&gt;<i> outline suggested above would be a wonderful cornerstone for teaching a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of very basic CS concepts, which might then produce some 
</I>&gt;<i> general-thinking employment candidates.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

I concur completely.  One thing that would have made it obvious that the things you speak of had been considered is if UML had 
been listed prominently (alongside the programming languages &amp; html).
