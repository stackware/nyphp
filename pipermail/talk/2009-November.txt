Subject: [nycphp-talk] gettext under Windows
Message-ID: <4AEF8F48.5070601@vnetworx.net>

I tried searching the archive first, and I don't think this has come up
before...

I've had a couple of requests to add translations to an open source
(GPL) project, and I'd like to implement it provided it's not going to
become some kind of ongoing burden to me or turn the application into a
resource-sucking monster.  It seems to me that what people are using is
GNU gettext, but I keep reading about various problems from threading
issues to incompatible .MO files when using the built-in support.

Then I discovered PHP Gettext ( https://launchpad.net/php-gettext/ ), an
all-PHP replacement and/or fallback library for Gettext support, which
apparently is used by Gallery and WordPress, among others.  Does anyone
know if this is the path to Gettext enlightenment under Windows?

I'm also open to hearing about other solutions that are suitable for a
GPL project.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] $_SESSION, Logout, and Shared Host
Message-ID: <946586480911041554t4230584aofc2e7616e7b39386@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.  I recently migrated my web app from my personal server to a (*way* more
powerful) shared server, where one of my colleagues also hosts his app.
Both were written in PHP.  Due to neither one of us having run into this
before, if you are logged in to both apps at the same time from the same
browser (which happens; we share more than a few students in common), and
log out of one, you get logged out of the other.  In my code, the logout
routine is as follows:

foreach( $_SESSION as $key=>$value ) {
    unset( $_SESSION[ $key ] );
}

And his code is essentially the same (I think he might use a
session_destroy() or something).

I know that if I add a layer to $_SESSION, like creating $_SESSION[ 'my_app'
][ keys... ], and then only unset those upon logout, I will prevent my
students from logging out of any app other than my own.  But that's a lot of
code to change (not the logout code, that's easy; but all the places I check
to see if someone's logged in) and besides, I imagine there has to be a
better way.

Please pretend that using a different physical or virtual server is not
possible, because it's essentially not (yay county budget!), so: what's the
PHP way to solve this problem?  Is there some way we can namespace-ize our
$_SESSION variables or something?

Thanks,
-Chris

It sounds like both applications are running on the same domain.  If  
that's not the case, something else is going on.

You have a couple of options, none of which might make you happy.

1) In your app, use a custom session name (session_name('MYSESSID')  
before you call session_start()).  You'll probably want to create a  
directory that the webserver can write to, and set session_save_path.

This should work nicely, unless you need to share session data with  
your colleage's appication.

If you do need both apps to access some shared session data,  you're  
stuck changing a bunch of references in code.  However, a global find/ 
replace to replace $_SESSION with $_SESSION['someKey'] will probably  
do the trick, and not be too painful.

Good luck.

Judging from the errors I got, it seems like I may have to do that before
*every* call to session_start(), which is Big Oh of the amount of work in
adding a layer to $_SESSION.

No, we need to not share data with each other -- if you're submitting
assignments in ITE 101, you don't want to accidentally overwrite what you
already submitted for CSC 101, for example.

Yeah, I can do that with find, xargs, and sed.  Thanks for the advice.

Hello,

I'm pretty sure you can control the /tmp/ directory where the sessions 
are stored. Just change it to be relative for each application.

True.  You've just learned a valuable lesson: You should only ever  
call session_start() in one place.  Typically, people it put it some  
file named something like "config.php", that gets included by every  
other page in the application.

True enough.

That's probably how I would do it.

I suggest you do *both*.  If you're repeating configuration stuff  
(session_start()) all over the place, you should be refactoring anyway.

Doing some fake namespacing in $_SESSION is a good idea, too.

I'd do both, but I'd refactor all of your configuration/bootstrapping  
first.

You could also use those tools to replace "session_start();" with
"session_name('whatever'); session_start();"

It's funny; that just occurred to me as I was about to read your response.
"Why on earth," I started saying to myself, "would I have called this from
multiple places?"  Sure enough, my login.php script does exactly that.  What
I should really be doing is starting the session in one place (I call it
_header.inc), which I already include from every other script -- except a
couple of really old ones, like login.php, which I was too lazy to rewrite
when I re-engineered this project with PHP 5 compliance, jQuery, etc.

So, pilot error.  :)

That's exactly what I'm going to do.  I also started thinking about when I
roll this software out for other faculty to use; each instance should be
creating its own session variables.

Anyway, thanks Tim and list for helping me find my mistake.

Hey Guys

This is slightly off topic but I don't know where else to turn.

I just inherited a client who had their site developed in Joomla, and when
it came time for the developer to turn over the access things apparently
went south and the administrative password for Joomla was never given to the
client.  Now, he can't update his site.  He has access to the server with
all the source code, so I'm relatively sure the password can be reset.
However, I'm having trouble finding the variables I need in order to connect
tot he database and reset the variables.

where do I look in order to find out what database information the site is
using, and once I find that file, what specific variables am I supposed to
look at?

Thanks in advance,
Brian O'Connor

I think there is a file called database.mysql.php, but I bet you could
grep for 'localhost', and I am sure you will find the file quickly
(assuming it is set to connect to localhost).

try: grep -R -C 4 localhost *

To recover the admin password, see:

Take a look in configuration.php and grab the following variables:

    $host
    $user
    $db
    $password

That is your database access information. Now to change your admin
password. When you connect to your database, go to a table called
jos_users and look for the admin user:

    select id, name, username, password from jos_users;

Somewhere in those results should be a user called 'admin' in the
'username' column. Now change that password to 'changeme' like this,
and note that I had to run the string 'changeme' through MD5 first as
all passwords in Joomla are hashed:

    update jos_users set password = '4cb9c8a8048fd02294477fcb1a41191a'
where username = 'admin';

Now you can login to the Joomla backend as admin / changeme, and
IMMEDIATELY change your password.

Morning all!

I've been working on the "pull an array from a file" again and trying to implement the "unserialize" suggestion. Cant seem to make it work. Here's the draft:

####

echo "fred";
$my_info = array('me' => 'mi', 'myself' => 'numerouno',  'i' => 'id' );
$fred = serialize($my_info);
$my_file = fopen( '/tmp/me.ser', 'w');
fwrite($my_file, $fred);
fclose($my_file);
echo "<p> $fred.";

Trying to get $new_fred to be an array and duplicate of $my_info. Thoughts?

Have you tried do a print_r with $new_fred? Calling echo $ARRAY_VAR
will output "Array."

echo "<p> new_fred is " . print_r($new_fred, true) . ". ";

Do you guys know of a good tutorial to set up PHP a accelerator for a
Windows system.
or for Drupal.

I google it and  I try a tutorial and apache stop working.  I remove the
accelerator stuff from my
php.ini and apache would start after rebooting the machine.

Thanks,

I have tried APC on 2 different windows servers (windows 2003 and windows
XP)
but it failed in both machines.
I am using php 5.2.9 and php 5.3 together with apache2.2

dowmload the php_apc.dll for php 5.2.9 and for php 5.3 I could not find
a php_apc.dll so I used the php_apc.dll for php 5.2.10.  Apparently they
have
not php_apc.dll binaries for php 5.3.

I am creating a Drupal site and it is slow.  I did already all the
recommendations
by Drupal to speed up Drupal, but is still slow but faster than it used to
be.
I read about APC and eaccelerator, so I just wanted to try to improve the
speed
because Drupal is slow monster.  BTW I tried eaccelerator but it did not
work plus
plus I read that it is not being main tained anymore.

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] CMS - Textpattern
Message-ID: <4AF5B379.30804@gmail.com>

Hi all -
Are any of you familiar with or have used a CMS called Textpattern?  I 
recently have begun working with a designer who uses Textpattern which 
is his CMS of choice. We're still in the evaluation process of my other 
project for a CMS system (thank you for your contributions, and will 
report back here the results when complete) and no one NYPHP Talk had 
brought that one up.  So I was curious as to whether it didn't even make 
the first cut, or just that it is not well known/used, which can be 
indicative of an inferior product at worst or one without a lot of 
support at best.  Any light shed is appreciated.
Once again - thanks,
Peter

I think this is the reason for so little feedback:

http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/joomla.org+textpattern.com+drupal.org

Not presuming anything other than overall web traffic stats, meaning
this project is either one of those great under-the-radar sleepers, a
brash young up-an-comer, or a project that just never took off. Don't
know personally which of the three Textpattern is.

Anybody using it?

That'd be like "off the charts" (in a bad way).  And your question is 
exactly where I'm at.  The designer swears by it, but have not met 
anyone that's even heard of it.  He says it's probably because it's more 
like a set of tags/libraries so it's not as though there's something to 
see except a result.  Well I'm going to have my guys check it out and 
maybe someone will pop up from under a rock somewhere...

I was reading about this and I can not use it.  I am using Thread safe  php
and apache
and the microsoft's windoww accelerator says:
*The Windows Cache Extension for PHP can only be used with the
non-thread-safe builds of PHP.*

Thanks,

xcache is by far my favorite, and they do have windows builds:

Maybe the "pdb" is for pthreads? Just guessing...

Hello,

Sorry for the late reply, there was something wrong with the phpMyAdmin
setup on the server.

I changed the md5 hash of the password to what you gave me (as well as other
strings as well), but I'm getting an incorrect username / password.

Is there something else in the user table that would prevent the admin from
logging in?

Thanks,
Brian

Ah, sorry for double/quick/self replying post.  Apparently they set up a
table prefix and it wasn't jos_users, but <prefix>_users.

Thank you very very very much for your help!

This is very interesting.  Makes me want to learn ruby :-)

I guess if you're a ruby developer it's not totally new, as it's
similar to EngineYard.  Anyone know of something similar in PHP --
turnkey, hosted application infrastructure that works off git and a
RESTful API?

Webbynode offers a "cloud" environment for PHP (and Ruby and Python)

Message-ID: <4bffc350911160620s25ec24a5v6c8658e82f9b9ee5@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking for a forum that supports a very specific, offbeat feature.  I
want one where you can have multiple websites that share a subset of forum
discussion boards and sync those boards between just those sites.

For example,  maybe you want to have a
JoomlaNYC forum
JoomlaCT forum
JoomlaBoston forum

And each site would have a set of boards specific to themselves, and then a
set of boards shared between all sites["northeast joomla events" for
example] so a post to one site gets synced to all sites.

It would have to be in such a manner that the sites are truly independent -
ie you can have different site "owners" and they merely authorize the other
site to sync to them.

It would also be best to have a method of sending Private Messages between
sites.

For those who remember the ancient days of 1200 baud modems and local
BBS's...think "FidoNet"

Anyone know of a forum with this set of features out of the box?  The
closest I can think of is FUDforum.

Gary,

Maybe not the answer your looking for, but why not have one forum site, and
have you considered one forum site, and deleivering specific forums to the
other sites via RSS feeds? You can chop up the RSS with magpie, and add
links to post new maesage, reply, etc.

The problem is, for this usage you can't have anyone in the "network" be a
"master" forum.   Everyone has to be free to choose which of the other
groups they are willing to exchange data with.

You might even have a weird cloud situation, where you have, for example:
Site A
Site B
Site C
Site D

Site A exchanges the "org help" forum with everyone
Site B exchanges the "org help" forum with A and C, but does not get along
with people on Site D so they don't accept D's posts
Site C exchanges with B and A but will accept messages from anywhere
Site D exchanges with just A and accepts from anyone


So a post made to B would sync TO A and C directly, and then when D syncs
with A it would appear there as well
A post made to A would automatically sync to B, C and D
A post made to D would sync to A directly, and from A to C but when it was
sent from A to B, B would reject it.

Does this make sense?  Basically, groups can voluntarily associate with each
other for specific forums, setup sync schedules, etc and they still retain
complete control over their own site.

Message-ID: <4bffc350911160706s578088b8l1b48fd0535b180f2@mail.gmail.com>

The specific usage scenario I envision is to allow schools that follow
similiar philosophies[basically following an open source model to organizing
and running the school, where students are part of the process not passive
receivers of the process.  Two example of this would be the Brooklyn Free
School, http://www.brooklynfreeschool.org/ and my childrens school, the
Hudson Valley Sudbury School, http://www.hudsonvalleyschool.org/] to share
information and discuss issues at both the student level and at the staff
and assembly level.

However, just like in the open source movement there are license
fanatics[some GPL folks don't think the BSD folks are "pure" enough, and
there are BSD folks who don't think GPL folks are "free" enough], in these
schooling communities there are conflicts between schools on "purity" and
"outlook" of philosophy.

So while the option for each school to have their own forum is powerful, and
being able to share discussion about shared interest is very important, at
the same time each school needs to have the right to choose not to
associate/discuss issues in a public manner with other schools when and
where there are personality conflicts.

I am sure there are other communities like this that may appreciate the
ability to bother interact and have the choice to not interact.  LGBT
community centers, Animal Sanctuaries, etc.

So my first look into this is to see if there is anything close to this sort
of functionality out there in forums.  The closes I see at the moment is
FUDforum's ability to sync via NNTP or email list - but then your back to
having a central repository to sync to[the list or newsgroup] where really
the sites need to have a more personal and dynamic method of establishing
connections.

A few steps further would be how to handle mod deletions of posts on the
source forum when syncing, groups that may wish to also have their own
deletion control over external posts internally[and deciding to trust other
groups deletion choices as well], and how to handle the inevitable snit fit
when two groups fall out and decide to ban each other - do past posts get
yanked or left.  That sort of thing.

Ok, digging deep into my first PHP extension, and before I got too far
along I determined that eclipse and pdt were NOT the most efficient
tools to be using.

Maybe I'm just lazy or picky, but I thought I'd ask what other folks
used for developing PHP extensions.

I see XCode (yes, I'm on a fruity computer) wants to open all .h
files, so I'm assuming XCode is an option as well. No idea if I can
trick it out specifically for PHP extension development though.

Thoughts? Comments?

Hello Mitch,

Your writing your extension in c correct? So, XCode will work fine, and 
you don't really have to trick it out
as it will provide you a variety of options for writing in C. Its 
probably the best IDE you'll find next to Visual Studios
for doing C development (your on a Mac, so Xcode it is).

I use xcode almost every day for obj-c/c dev and I think its amazing - 
GDB takes a little getting used to,
but your not going to get a much better toolset on Mac, especially for C 
debugging.

I wouldn't be surprised if there are even Project Templates available 
for PHP extension development using Xcode,
just to help you hit the ground running.

- Ben

I built something like this for PBS in the early 90s.  It was called 
Learning Link and it was a software network of 70+ PBS stations and 
schools.  What I did was leverage Usenet and INN by creating a hierarchy 
of private local and regional newsgroups that a site could subscribe to.

I had considered that, but I couldn't think of a way that site owners could
maintain absolute control over the propogation of their lists.

This seems to call for a central repository.... wheras I don't want any
central repository.

Now, I know at the base level, Usenet works in just the opposite view, where
admins have complete control - but I don't know if there are any user
friendly admin tools for usenet[I know I can admin it....just not sure if it
ever came into the GUI age of admin]

Googling "gui nntp server open source" turned up some things that looked
promising.  You might want to take a look at this:

Hmm.. thanks!  I'll take a look.

Keep in mind I do run a cost/time analysis in my head.

It goes like this at the moment:
I know PHP/MySQL
All interested parties have websites and can most likely run PHP/MySQL
I know FUDforum comes CLOSE to the feature I need
So right now I figure I'm looking at no more than 20 hours of work to
program my own custom solution on top of that

So anything that takes me more than 20 hours to figure out how it works and
customize it has a pretty steep hill to climb.  I'm willing to go up to 40
hours on something that works "out of the box" because then instead of there
being one person to support it technically, there is the group behind the
established project.

So this looks good to check out.....  the main thing is that it has to be
something that does not require a daemon running.  IE if one party sticks
their server on godaddy and another on media temple and a third on a
dedicated box, they have to all work together with nothing more involved
than a config file and a cron job.

Even if it doesn't meet this immediate need it is fun to poke around with
nntp again.

NNTP is a push protocol so you can tell the server which groups to 
propagate.  It's been years but I think this is done in the 'newsfeeds' 
control file.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] front end design
Message-ID: <270718.48909.qm@web30803.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello Guys:
I am hoping that I can get a direction to take on this issue.? I have designed a back-end program using Java.?? The purpose of this program is to be used as an inventory of items in the home or small office.? I could use PHP embeded into HTML, but then I would have to make it a part of the browser, which is not my intension (at least i think ).
I am using Java because of its cross platform capability.
The issue is, can anyone direct me on a interface to use that would serve as a front-end for this program.
I have never done front end programming before that was not related to a database so I am a bit at a lost? as to how or where to begin.
Thanks in advance
Ian

Well, you can do the front-end in Java as well. You know how to use Java and 
there are controls, libraries, etc. available for front-end (assuming GUI) 
development. But, you can also use PHP for that. It is not the typical use for 
PHP, but that is why some clever people created GTK. Take a look here: 
http://gtk.php.net/

Then again, what is the problem with having the UI in the browser?

Why? I don't understand why that restriction is in place. Sure, you need a web 
server then as well because PHP is server side scripting, but there are plenty 
of very simple web servers that could be used. If it has to be OS independent 
and Java is present (which is a given as you need it for the backend) you can 
use a small Java web server like this one: http://tjws.sourceforge.net/

Is the no browser rule something you chose or is that a requirement of the 
end-user / customer? I find it much easier to use the browser as UI container 
because you already know how that works using PHP. Since an inventory program 
is mainly input driven anyway making it a browser based app is typically the 
way to go. So if you are more comfortable coding for a browser interface then 
I'd recommend doing that.

One possibility is to treat your "backend" as a service.  Build in a mini
web server, and expose the data list/update/delete methods as an API[SOAP,
REST, whatever]

So, for example, to get a list of all items in office 1, the url might be
http://localhost:8887/listItems?oid=1

And that returns data in some format, for example and readability, CSV
response
itemid,itemname,itemlocation
005,computer,desk
009,cablemodem,shelf

Than your frontend application can be designed in many different ways, and
they get their data from the backend using the API

If you wanted a PHP solution, that could be put on a web server and run
locally.
If you wanted another Java app, that can be compiled and run indepedently
etc

This also means that you have the ability to provide your application in
different ways.  For those who don't want to run it locally, you could run
the backend on your own web server and give them access to it.

You can also design a PHP frontend to be hosted remotely on your server, so
if their at a friends house they can go to the webserver frontend on his
machine and show them their new cool app without bringing their computer
along.

Note: the above example lacked security.  For a real app, you would want to
have some sort of logon/credentialling step and then those credentials would
be passed for all future data requests in addition to the the other commands
and variables.

If you want to get really technical about it, UI design processes are 
standardized in ISO 13407 "Human-centered design processes for interactive 
systems". That might give guidance as to how to approach such a project, but 
it won't answer the question if Java, PHP, Swing, Curl, Delphi, or machine 
code are best suited for GUI design. There are also several tutorials online.
At my work, this is what we use as process in a nutshell:
- gather requirements: what do the users want and what do they not want
- write a statement of scope: what is it that you are supposed to do
- write a functional requirements document: describe exactly how the the UI is 
expected to behave, that includes any error messages as well as UI layout
- write a tech spec: the approach from the developers perspective, this doc is 
not supposed to contain any code, but screen mockups and program flow
- write a test plan: based on the functional requirements and the tech spec, 
determine all cases that may occur (not just the expected ones, users often do 
not do what you expect them to do) and determine the expected behaviour of the 
app based on the requirements (which is why crappy requirement docs make 
crappy apps)
- code the application and unit test it
- run the test plan against the app, log any errors (even when you are a one 
person operation)
- fix the errors
- run the test plan against the app, log any errors (when there are none, 
proceed, otherwise go back to fixing)
- craft a deployable package for user acceptance testing (also called beta test)
- make any modifications from user acceptance testing, if necessary amend the 
test plan
- run the test plan against the app, log any errors
- fix any errors that may have occurred
- test again to make sure fixes didn't introduce new bugs (you have to keep on 
testing until all cases are passed in one round of testing)
- release the app


That process works and puts a lot of focus at the beginning of the process on 
accurate statements of scope (which also ned to include what the app is not 
supposed to do and if any existing functionality is allowed to be changed, 
typically not the case) and on functional requirements. If it is unclear what 
you need to do there is no point in getting technical at that moment. Choosing 
the programming language is really a secondary thought, you gather the tools 
that work for you and that allow you to make best use of your skill set - 
unless you have the luxury to take that as opportunity to learn new skills.
So, two things to hammer home are detailed documentation of requirements (and 
detailed means going down to each and every button click or other event) and 
testing, testing, testing - and I don't just say that as QA analyst. Even 
simple web pages such as the one at my work for signing up for insurance need 
to be throughly tested. The yahoo that clobbered that SharePoint crap together 
didn't bother to trim leading and trailing spaces, but tested for spaces to be 
in the entry. That probably would have worked out if he or she didn't put a 
space in as default entry. So if you just start typing and hit submit you get 
an error message. Shows that whoever made this and whoever signed off on it 
most likely never even tried it once. Any somewhat formal testing would have 
found that bug. But who knows, maybe it is just the result of someone in HR 
clicking something together using SharePoint Designer. One of the many reasons 
why I loathe SharePoint, it is just bad software.

HTH,

David

Hi Ain,
I don't know  if you're familar with Java Servlet--it's a new and improved technology designed to
do the task (both front-end and back-end) that you're trying to accomplish.
There is a book that touches briefly on the this topic, the Servlet tutorial, which is found at
http://www.ZeroNilZilch.Com
It's called "The Introduction To Java" and the Servlet tutorial is in chapter 11.
Here is a brief snipet of a Servlet code that does both front-end and back-end job:
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
public class ExampServlet extends HttpServlet 
      {
        public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws ServletException, IOException
               {
                response.setContentType(&quot;text/html&quot;);
                PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
               out.println("Example ";);
              String postData = request.getParameter("inputfieldname");
              if (postData != null)
                {
                 out.println(postData); //output the posted data
                }
           else 
               {
                out.println("No posted data was received from the input form.");
              }
          //You can do front-end as the following code shows:
         out.println('Return to <;A HREF="http://www.example.com/MainPage.html"  ');
         out.close();
       }
 }

Hope it helps a bit.
Paul

Hey Chris!

Since when was a video presentation about a document database not
applicable? I found the presentation very informative, as Dwight gives
a pretty simple and clear background on the different types of
alternative databases out there.

Yeah, that's what Eric said too. I was feeling grumpy and it looked

Hi all,

I'm working on a new project and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding what should go in the code vs. Database for this project. 

The database is a forum type schema, so there are a lot of transactions going on. For instance, when a record is inserted into a post table, two counters elsewhere also need to be updated. I was going to use triggers for this functionality, but we have 3 front ends to the site as well. So that has made me want to use stored procedures, but that will limit us to this specific database software (mysql). 

What balance have people found to work well for projects where there are multiple front ends and multiple developers?  Do stored procedures work well for things like that?  

Thanks,

Matt

Stored procedures have their place, but should generally be abstracted.

If you have multiple developers, make one of them in charge of  
providing an API for the front-end developers.  You probably want to  
pick one of the more experienced developers, since everyone else's  
code will be talking to his.

If you're playing in an MVC setup, this API is the model.

The person responsible for the API might choose to use stored  
procedures or not.  If she changes her mind later, none of the front- 
end people need to know, or care.

Tim,

That's how we have things now. We are doing an MVC setup for our main site. But the problem is that our other interfaces aren't programmed in the same setup or language.  Which is why I was thinking stored procedures would be nice because we could have a createUser procedure, for instance, which creates a new account, and can be called no matter what the front end code is.

The question is if this is a problem. In my experience, stored procedures can 
add performance and allow for code to run on a different server than the web 
server. But, if the expectations are to use other database platforms as well 
you may need to take that into consideration. You may end up writing stored 
procedures for each supported database, which adds extra work. But that is 
something that may be postponed after the initial release.

Limit you to a specific database, the same database that thousands of
companies successfully use for handling billions of transactions every
day? I'd say the likelihood of you switching databases later in the
application life cycle is slim to none. After you've invested a few
weeks of development, stored procedures or not, you'll likely have
started using vendor specific features, such as LIMIT, which is not
implemented the same way in all database engines.

Hi Matt:

Whether it's in the database or in PHP, changing DBMS'es requires
recoding some aspects of the project.  So put things where they best 
belong.  In the case you're proposing, a stored procedure is the right 
way to go.

See you,

Hi Dan,

Would the stored procedure route work best for all INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE 
actions of our code (and I'm working on creating views for SELECT's):

Such as:

createUser
createPost
createReply

Or is adding all of this logic into the database not a good idea?

As an FYI, I've done this 3-4 different ways in the past, where the DAL 
was in stored procedures, a "man in the middle" code approach, and inside 
shared libraries.  The problem with shared libraries right now is that 
there are multiple front ends, and even if they are in PHP, some are 
object oriented (MVC), and some are procedural.  Also, some of the front 
ends may be developed not in PHP, which would render those libraries 
useless.  The man in the middle approach is too big for us at this point. 
So that really only leaves stored procedures, but I always question 
putting all this logic in the database.

Thanks for your suggestions all!

-M

Makes sense.  In all honesty, chances are most of our front ends will 
remain PHP, but the problem we're running into is that I'm not an object 
oriented programmer.  So once I get done with the database work, systems 
work, etc., I want to help code, but avoid jumping right into the clean 
code base of our primary site.  To help with that, I designed/developed 
our mobile site, which is a standalone code base split up cleanly 
(MVC-like), but not object oriented.  I find myself duplicating a ton of 
logic, because none of it is in a DAL right now.  Stored procedures would 
be great in this instance, but I wonder if it's for the wrong reason.

Furthermore, eventually we've thought of looking into something like 
MongoDB or Tokyo Tyrant depending on the traffic of the site, which could 
potentially complicate the issue if most of the logic is in the database. 
But as there will only be 20-30 stored procedures anyway, it wouldn't be 
too hard to re-write things at that point, as if we chose to go the 
Tokyo Tyrant/MongoDB route, we'd have to rewrite a lot of the schema and 
code anyway.

As you realize, there needs to be a programming language layer (in PHP, 
Perl, Python, Java, whatever) no matter what.  It is how the data gets 
passed to the DBMS, whether it is via INSERT statements, prepared 
statements, or executing stored procedures.

All of them work and they're all pretty much the same when it comes to 
the programming language layer.

I've never sat down and examined the speed of each approach.  Has anyone 
here?

Except for when the programmers you're working with don't want to/aren't 
strong at writing SQL.  Which is the case here, and I need more to do, 
hence wanting to put some of the DB logic in the database.

I would add that stored procedures also allow you support a mix of 
different application languages sharing the same procs.  For instance, 
some shops mandate PHP on the web side and Perl (etc.) for the async 
scripts.

My experience is slightly different.  Stored procedures are great for making
code-independent business logic, but if they aren't fully documented and
everyone made aware of them, they can also create problems.

For example, if every time you create a user record, you also create some
empty user profile, customer profile, and supplier profile records to go
with that user via a trigger - you can very well have a coder who looks at
the action[create a user through the webform] and then the database
changes[4 records created], so in his new code in a different language he
duplicates the action - suddenly every user he creates has 2 customer
profile records, 2 supplier profiles, and 2 user profiles - 1 he manually
creates and 1 that the triggers create.

So, since you have to fully document what the result is anyway, in the end
it doesn't matter if you use stored triggers and procedures or have each
person code it individually.  It's more a matter of taste and less of
function.

+1.  You're not going to take switching the db lightly and the chance
of "just loading up the data in the new db and switching a config
file" without changing any code is slim to none.

More likely, you'll create a new client (iPhone App, etc.) that you'll
want to talk to the same database.  Putting your logic in the db
eliminates the need to recode that logic.

Thanks,

Just to be clear, what I'm saying is the act of inserting the data is 
pretty much the same regardless of the route.

But, as you're initially asking, several steps need to be performed after 
the record is inserted, then stored procedures are handy.

This is what REST was intended for.

You don't need to limit yourself to one database; and you don't need
to tie to any specific language. Scale shouldn't be limited by a
single database either...

By providing a REST API to your data, you push the concept of stored
procedures up the stack, making it a LOT easier for you to scale the
database as there's no reliance on stored procs.

Second, any language talking HTTP POST/GET is able to interface with
your REST systems, freeing you to choose the right tool for the job.
PHP, java, ruby, whatevah!

Third, REST can also be load balanced across many systems, greatly
simplifying your needs when it is time to scale the system out.

Fourth, REST can be load balanced by URL - assuming you have a half
decent load balancer - so you can segment your REST services based on
function: Authentication, Registration, Purchase, etc.

This is really a perfect situation for a REST service, and you should
consider it.

And on alternative database engines, MongoDB also will have a huge
impact on your development, as you're able to do a lot of
"unthinkable" things that just don't work in the old relational model
- such as your "insert once, update many counters" example is a
perfect fit. MongoDB is great for real time analytics and some pretty
high traffic sites can attest to how well MongoDB performs in that
scenario.

Keep in mind, by setting up another vector to get/modify data from your
database, you are also setting up another vector of data access you have to
secure.

I would only consider REST if your looking to open this up to a large team
of developers, or a number of different companies operating independently.
For internal use, I'd put off REST until you have a mature app.
