In my view everyone should understand the free-beer vs free-software 
argument. It is core to the future of open source technologies and the 
benefits we have all enjoyed.

Free beer is not free - it is given to you so you will enjoy the beer 
and buy more beer and more beer. It is given to you so you will relax, 
and be more easily influenced. It has a catch, a hook, an ulterior 
objective. That is free-as-in-beer, free-as-in-cigarettes, etc. 
Free-as-in-speech is intended to mean truly free of further obligation 
or risk. Of course I can't say it as well as others, but others aren't 
explaining it here ;-)

Were it not for Open Source technologies (like PHP) training would be an 
even larger business than it is, and you all would need very large 
budgets in order to be so productive and innovative as you are. You 
would not enjoy such freedom from supervision and management as you have 
now - I suspect that if you are younger than 30 years old you may not 
have a grasp of this. Open Source has created a whole new world of 
maverick technologists innovating.... the traditional business world 
hates that. It's upsetting. It's &quot;disruptive&quot;. It takes profits away 
from the owners.

I would add that from what I have seen, Microsoft can stop fighting and 
wait for the OS world to complicate itself out of its competitive 
advantage. We are past the point where the average business person can 
feel comfortable with OS licensing. The case for proprietary software 
has just about returned from the value, performance, and innovation 
space, and is settling back into the &quot;nobody ever got fired for buying&quot; 
space (substitute &quot;sued&quot; for &quot;fired&quot;). Corporate limited liability is a 
powerful thing - safer means better, in many cases.

Once that shift starts happening, how do OS companies hedge their bets 
to protect their futures? By preparing for the proprietary commercial 
space (however distasteful it might be). Can they do that with 
free-as-in-beer licenses? Nope.
