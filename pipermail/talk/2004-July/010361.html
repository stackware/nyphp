<PRE>I owned nothing but PCs until I bought my 15&quot; PowerBook (titanium 
edition, dual hinge) in 2002.  After years of Apple propaganda hoisted 
at me by my brother and the emergence of OS X, the switch was on.  I 
have never been so pleased with a computer.

I should note that I did have some problems with OS X when it first 
came out, but ever since the 10.1 series, it's bee perfect, not one 
kernal panic (core dump) in two years.  (I am running 10.2.8 right now 
and will leapfrog 10.3 for 10.4 which is not out yet:  
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/</A> )

I also had a hardware problem.  I have the dual hinge model which isn't 
on the market any longer.  The hinge ceased up as I was opening the lid 
and tore titanium lid pretty bad.  I have Apple Care, so I took it down 
to the SOHO store and they boxed it up and shipped it out for repair 
after a cursory glance a raised eyebrow of accomplishment.  The laptop 
was delivered to my apartment 4 business days later.  Before they took 
it in for repair, I also had them note that some of the paint around 
the edges was pealing (due to the excessive heat the thing produces) 
and that the battery life was diminishing.  They replaced *everything* 
and it looked like I had a new machine if it weren't for the well worn 
keypad!  I noticed that in the new models they've address the hinge 
problem by going to a study single hinge design and the change 
materials to a high grade aluminum which has absolutely not give at 
all.  (The titanium ones bend a bit.)

I installed PHP and mySQL packages from Marc Liyanage's web site (a 
well loved man in the OS X LAMP world.)

O'Reilly's Mac Dev Center is a gem:

Apple's site does a good job of rounding the edges:

This is a PHundamental I wrote for setting up virtual domains for OS X

Good luck!
