Wendy's Drive-up Order System Information Disclosure

Reporter: mi2g (<A HREF="http://www.mi2g.com/">http://www.mi2g.com/</A>)
Date: July 07, 2004
Severity: Medium to High
Attack Class: Physical, Remote, Race Condition
Vendor: Wendy's (<A HREF="http://www.wendys.com/">http://www.wendys.com/</A>)


I. BACKGROUND

Wendy's International, Inc. is one of the world's largest restaurant
operating and franchising companies with more than 9,300 total restaurants
and quality brands - Wendy's Old Fashioned HamburgersR, Tim HortonsR and
Baja FreshR Mexican Grill. The Company invested in two additional quality
brands during 2002 - Cafe ExpressT and Pasta PomodoroR.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of the Wendy's Drive-up ordering system allows an
attacker to gain sensitive information about the order of arbitrary
customers.

During customer/vendor &quot;handshake&quot;, the customer vehicle must come to
a stop
beside the vendor menu ordering system which contains a large screen to
display the current order.
During this process, adequate protection is not given to the space between
the vehicle and the menu allowing for a number of remote attackers to
obtain
sensitive order information.

Once the victim has finished ordering, the information stays available on
the screen for up to several minutes or until another customer has pulled
forward. This creates a great window for exploitation and increases the
chance of winning the &quot;race condition&quot;.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated remote malicious arbitrary
attackers to retrieve the contents of the previous customer's food order
which is a serious breach of confidentiality.

As proof of concept, this attack was carried out against mi2g CEO DK
Matai.
It was disclosed that he ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, large
fries and
a large Coca-Cola.

IV. DETECTION

mi2g has confirmed that all Wendy's with a Drive-up menu display are
affected. Other vendors may be affected but were not tested.

V. WORKAROUND

Use a hard object such as a rock or baseball bat to disable the order
display screen after the late night drive-thru has closed.

VI. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name
CAN-2004-2934 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE
list (<A HREF="http://cve.mitre.org">http://cve.mitre.org</A>), which standardizes names for security
