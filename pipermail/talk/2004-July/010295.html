I spent 2 hours studyig SNMP as a management tool for internetworks 
under Mark Miller many moons ago. He was *passionate* about hands-on 
control of the SNMP process, from hand-crafting MIBS from the ground up 
(for any device you like), to capturing data streams and breaking apart 
each piece for knowledge of what was happening on the network. As I 
recall he was way ahead of his time, in that network management tools at 
the time were all but ridiculously over hyped and under powered.

Standards held back reliable deployment then, which he aptly 
demonstrated every other minute or so.

His book &quot;*Managing Internetworks With SNMP&quot; *was good after taking that 
course, but without the training it is considered a very difficult book, 
not for beginners. The &quot;official&quot; books are listed here
