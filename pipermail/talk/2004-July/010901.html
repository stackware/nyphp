I bought a new laptop a couple months ago and out of sheer boredom (and 
laziness) I just kept XP.  Eventually found Wintel counterparts to all 
of my needs, and rely heavily on Macromedia's environment now 
(Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash).  Thanks to firefox and thunderbird, I 
am comfortable on any platform.  The only thing I miss?  Code folding.  
Sure wish I could collapse those hairy classes and just look at the few 
functions in that script without having to hit page up forty 
times...(grumble grumble)

On to fireworks, I started using Photoshop with the Mac IIcx (Bush's 
daddy was president I think), working my way to the SGI workstation of 
doom; and then switched off to Gimp on Linux when it became usable.  
When I first started playing with Fireworks, I just couldn't figure out 
how anything worked, and had to see some tutorials to grok the 
interface.  Then, I just couldn't trust it, because it had automated 
stuff that took forever to do in Gimp.  But it worked, and well.

Now I can do something in Fireworks and it takes minutes, something that 
would take the whole dingdong day with anything else.  I think you will 
be just fine, as long as you spend the time to learn the Fireworks way 
of doing things(tm).
