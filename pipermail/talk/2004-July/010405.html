<PRE>I have used a mac for the past 4 years, but went to pc solely on my
limited budget from my son and I needed better hardware to play the
newer games, like the World of Warcraft beta, which would need a 1ghz
g4, and I only had a 733.

Apache is built-in to os x - and the entropy site that is linked in
this thread is what I used to update php and also mysql. PHP is built
in, but it most likely isnt the most recent build, unless they just
updated it in a software-update combined with other things.

I had a fully-fledged email server running using sendmail, and web
server using amp. The aliases on the mail server are great, because
you can just create them using their built-in administration tools.

I like the built-in iApps, iPhoto, iChat, iTunes (Which I now use on
pc) - one of the reasons that I went to one.

I used bbedit or dreamweaver mx, but bbedit had better FTP
compatibility, which I loved. It was fast, so you could open right off
of the ftp server within a few seconds, and it kept the connection
alive in the background. Saving was instantaneous.

The only problem that I saw with using the mac was their built-in ssh
client, and when I went into VIM, the home/end/etc keys did not work,
since they had different ascii codes bound to them, but that was
something that I probabally could have fixed.

All in all - I prefer the mac, but I have to settle with a pc for my
cost - 500 bucks for a dell p4 3.06ghz on a 2 day special? Couldn't
pass that up... but I will wait to buy an apple again until they come
out with powerbooks running G5's with a true 64bit OS, instead of the
64bit wrapper on OS X like they have now.
