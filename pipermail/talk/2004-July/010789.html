</I>&gt;<i> In response to Hans's reply, I generally agree with most of what he
</I>&gt;<i> said. However, my one minor nit-pick is that as long as your traffic
</I>&gt;<i> is read-only (or largely reads, with occasional writes), SQLite may be
</I>&gt;<i> a better choice regardless of your traffic volume.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, php.net uses SQLite to power the &quot;Notes&quot; section of the
</I>&gt;<i> PHP Manual. I would say php.net probably has more traffic than your
</I>&gt;<i> usual Web site. Additionally, SQLite 3.0 (now in beta) should be even
</I>&gt;<i> better in this regard as it reduces its locking window during
</I>&gt;<i> writes. (According to the SQLite Web site; I haven't actually run
</I>&gt;<i> SQLite 3.0 personally.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, as I said earlier, you can bundle SQLite with a product without
</I>&gt;<i> paying any fees. While I know MySQL, AB now has a FOSS exemption to
</I>&gt;<i> its GPL license, I don't believe you can sell a commercial application
</I>&gt;<i> that uses MySQL 4.1 or greater as its backend without buying a
</I>&gt;<i> commercial license from MySQL, AB.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I think the issue is somewhat vague, as the current position
</I>&gt;<i> seems to depend on whether MySQL is an integral part of your
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure if I am wrong, Hans (or Zak) will correct me. I'm not trying
</I>&gt;<i> to spread any FUD here, but I want to let people know that there have
</I>&gt;<i> been some licensing changes in newer versions of MySQL that could
</I>&gt;<i> affect them and it's something they need to consider.
