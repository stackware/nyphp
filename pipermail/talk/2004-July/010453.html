<PRE>In preparation to writing two security courses -- a security survey and 
a security tools course, the usual suspects of the latest reference 
books were purchased, as well as knoppix STD.   btw, my area of 
expertise has primarily been in LAN/WAN networking, TCP/IP and routing 
protocols, and forensics.  One book that I hadn't seen before is 
&quot;Exploiting Software: How to Break Code&quot; by Greg Hoglund and Gary 
McGraw.  Overall, it's not a bad book for the most part.   It was 
published Feb. 2004.
One small section that I took issue with and am about to write the 
authors about is their characterization of PHP.  I quote:

from page 190:
&quot;In many cases, software may come preset with various parameters set by 
default. In many cases, the default values are set with no regard for 
security...&quot;  The authors go on to mention PHP global variables and 
characterizes PHP as &quot;In seriously broken languages like PHP, a number 
of default configurations are poorly set.&quot;

First, the authors apparently don't know anything about PHP 4.2.0 which, 
I believe, was released over 2 years ago.  Ironically, their next 
paragraph begins with &quot;In the interest of convenience (laziness?), some 
programmers...&quot; 

Seems the authors were too lazy to check their facts.  It makes me 
wonder if they've even bothered to research their subject to find a file 
called php.ini-recommended.

Further down the page is this paragraph:
&quot;PHP is a study in bad security.&quot;    I believe that if the authors had 
said something like &quot;phpBB is a study in bad security&quot;  they might have 
stated the problem correctly.

So, before I send an email to these guys, is there anything else I 
should point out?

John
