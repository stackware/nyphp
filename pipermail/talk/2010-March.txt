Hi,

I'm trying to use the Zend provided mysql which runs on the ISeries.
However, I also need a way to replicate certain DB2 data files to it.  There
should be a way to do this without having to go out to the network.  So I am
looking for an API and/or a way to write directly to the binlogs if
possible.  Any information on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

One way to go about the replication would be to use the MySQL IBMDB2i
storage engine. If you did, you could handle the replication entirely from
the System i side. Read more about it here The DB2 for i (IBMDB2I) Storage
Engine for MySQL on IBM i
Download<http://solutions.mysql.com/engines/ibm_db2_storage_engine.html>

The IBMDB2i storage engine requires at least MySQL 5.1.35 (which ships with
the ZendServer 5 beta) to run. ZendCore ships with MySQL 5.0.xxx, so you
would need to upgrade to a newer version of MySQL to go this route.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] html to PDF conversion?
Message-ID: <B87CD580-2000-4568-8B5E-1D28F86BF77A@gmail.com>

The solution doesn't have to be written in PHP, but it's fine if it is  
as long as it works.

I'm looking for a command-line way to convert HTML to a PDF on CentOS  
5.4, because I need to do this in a shell script to create the webpage  
as a .PDF file.

I've looked at xhtml2pdf written in Python, but CentOS 5.4 is still  
running Python 2.4 and the best I can tell it needs Python 2.5 or  
later cause I couldn't get it to work.

I also tried PDF-FromHTML-0.31 which is written in PERL, but requires  
HTML::TIDY which seems to be unavailable currently.

Thanks in advance for any advice. If this is now considered trivial to  
do in PHP and I've just not stumbled across it yet, please enlighten me.

The best solution I have seen uses webkit create the PDFs.  You get
pretty much the same results as using the print feature in
Safari/Chrome.

I don't know if it will run on your system, but it is worth a look:

Prince XML has a free non-commercial license:
http://www.princexml.com/overview/

I recently read an article on alistapart.com that mentioned it.  I'm not sure exactly what system libraries might be needed - it installed with little effort on my mac.

I compared it side by side with wkhtmltopdf.  wkhtmltopdf produced a better version of the site I pointed it at.  Looks like Prince has some more options though - like passing in your own stylesheets and working with xml in addition to html.

Thanks to everyone and John for replying.

I installed wkhtmltopdf on a CentOS 5.4 i386 machine without any  
problem. Just the executable was supplied in the i386 version I  
downloaded and installed.

I found something interesting. I used wget to get the HTML and then  
fed it through wkhtmltopdf. The PDF looked OK, then I noticed in the  
help you can do wkhtmltopdf website.com website.pdf, so I thought why  
not let the program do the whole thing. To my surprise the output  
looked even better! When wkhtmltopdf is getting the web page it  
performs some magic to create the PDF properly.

I would guess that it uses the print stylesheet as opposed to the web
stylesheet by default.

Good point, Gary! Maybe a recursive call on the wget option would grab  
all of it then.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] dbdeploy
Message-ID: <4bffc351003080028o1b94fc24wfcbd59bca7abdc56@mail.gmail.com>

Was wondering if anyone here has been using dbdeploy for helping manage
database schema's and if so, what you think of it?
http://www.davedevelopment.co.uk/2008/04/14/how-to-simple-database-migrations-with-phing-and-dbdeploy/

I'm also thinking that for me...one of the biggest issues I tend to have is
with data in your database.

Such data can be split into 4 types for me[I'm thinking primarily us using
something like Joomla here]

Config data that MUST be installed when the application is installed.  IE
all the module and menu entries that get installed when you install Joomla.

Config data that OUGHT to be installed when an sub-application is installed.
 IE all the module and menu entries that get installed when you install a
new set of components.

Sample Data that for testing and such.

Actual live data.

Since space for int's is cheap...my gut feeling would be to use the
auto increment id's to help separate this data.

IE any id under 1000 is system data that should always be migrated,
Any id between 1000 and 2000 is data that goes with an application and
probably should be migrated.

Now, this next part is trickier.  If you are doing work for someone on a
shared host, your somewhat limited, so for that I would say that anything
above 2000 and below 5000 is sample data, and anything above 5000 is live
data.

So basically, upon installing an application and it's related data set, go
through and for every auto increment id field, change the floor to 5000.

It means a little more work when setting up tests and doing dev work to
renumber any field entrees which are not live data and bring them down the
the appropriate range[first 1000 config data, second 1000 application data,
and next 3000 sample data].

Alternatively, if you have the ability to set your auto increment numbering
system, then simple set the live system to an even number and all dev
systems to an odd number and increment by 2's[so 5000,5002,5004 is the live
data, 5001,50003,5005 is the sample data].

To me, this makes it easy when visually looking at the tables to immediately
spot what data goes where - you can take a snapshot of a live server if you
need to work with the data from it...

Just wondering what others do in this regard.


[I generally am working as the sole php programmer fixing someone else's
code...and making a local snapshot of their environment works great, but
then deployment time comes and since some of it includes upgrading/adding
modules that install config data/files it can get...difficult to capture all
that config data without actually installing the data.  So a little more
prep work during the setup/dev will yield a smoother transition in the
future].

Are you talking about multiple user accounts or is it that using different tables for different data doesn't work for you? i.e., a table for config data, a table for sample data, etc.

Message-ID: <4bffc351003081130w52f9e249y809bd2db805da0ce@mail.gmail.com>

I'm talking about when working on large applications made up of components,
with a component system built in and a smattering of components included to
make a complete "application".

For example, Joomla:
The Joomla MySQL database contains a table called jos_components where every
component installed in the system has(or should have) an entry in this
table.

It comes with a number of components by default, some of which fall into the
category of must have(and if their not there, bad things happen with other
components depending on them) and some of which are samples that are
frequently replaced(banners and polls).


Now, if you clone the system and do work offline, you then run into an issue
of deployment.  How do you deploy just the changes you made to the
tables....[say you installed and configured 2 new components] without
updating all of them?

Obviously, storing your database schema in your version control system in
some rational format can be used to automate deployment of new code.

However, I like to go in and look at the tables...and if there is some
problem simply coping rows can sometimes help.

So in that case, my opinion is that if one had set the auto increment id and
ensured the base component id's were all under some number[500]...and any
sample components that aren't actually used are in the 500-1000 range, and
finally all other components are above 1000 - then it is a simple matter to
export the data and import[and of course, if you have multiple developers
and gave everyone a different starting increment and offset...ie planning
for 3 developers, you might choose to start production data at 1000, and
each developer at 1001 through 1003.  Set your auto incremement to 6, and
you have room for 2 more developers with no one stepping on each others
toes].

Now deployment is simplified, as developers can simply migrate their data to
the server when ready.

By the same token, if for whatever reason the developer is creating
data[trying different content layouts around], by ensuring their sample data
id's are all set to the sample range, it is simple to setup a build script
which will skip inserts for any data that is outside the range of
production.

This is called "smart numbers" or "intelligent numbers" and is
generally considered a bad practice.

That said, I can't think of a better approach, but have never tried to
solve this problem so that's only maybe four or five brain cells.

 True, but then so is storing library and configuration files under the web
directory[man do I loathe all the empty index.html files just to keep
directory browsing out]

As long as I am dealing primarily at the low end, shared hosting environment
open source world, I'm inclined to stick with simple solutions that work.
:-)

There actually are a number of ideas for better solutions, but in the end
they require some thought on the developers part.  Wheras using specific id
numbers doesn't require much thought[and setting up increments that we can
ignore requires almost none at all].

I think in the end there are a range of practices, and while special numbers
can and does turn around and bite you in the but eventually[what happens
when you run out of them?] - their good enough for /most/ people.  And those
who do get bitten by the issue are hopefully making enough money hand over
fist to hire programmers from the NYPHP members list. :-)

Yup, and that line of thought is exactly why we've suffered under the
loathsome burden of ItemID all these years.

I think it's more that itemID, ID, etc have stood the test of time as the
best solution.

In the beginning, it was a simple matter of what is the FASTEST comparison
one can make - and an integer is pretty dang close to the fast[bitwise
comparisons being even better] - and for understandability, integers are
easier to deal with.

It allowed one to store relational data in the smallest possible value.

As processor speed increases, and disk space becomes dirt cheap, it is no
longer neccessary to store all these keys to save space and processing
power.  But by the same token, it costs virtually nothing more to store an
integer ID AND data that actually has semantic value[am I using that term
correctly?].

For example, I can have a user table:
Userid, Username, Firstname, Lastname, EmailAddress, etc

And then a forum posting table, and for each post in the old days, I would
store userid.....  while using a combo of username, firstname, lastname,
emailAddress as my key might seem more intuitive.... Why?  We know one of
those is going to change over the lifetime of a system.  If I want to store
that data with the post to make things faster...well, I can go ahead and do
that AND store the userid.  And then I can decide which takes precedence...
 For example, maybe I want to show the username of the person at the time
they posted, but if you go to their profile I will use the id to link to it,
and show their current name.

While you can argue that it costs nothing to use the other data for a key
due to increased processing and disk space...I would argue it costs nothing
to include that other data AND a key field.

Furthermore, no matter how hard one tries, the identifying link is going to
be shown to a user in some manner at some point...in the url, in a profile
page, in a forum posting, SOMEWHERE there will be the identifier shown to
them.

And sure as men suck, there is going to be some woman getting out of a bad
relationship, who has changed her name after the divorce and she is going to
be really really pissed to have that reminder staring her in the face.  And
then the programmer has to go and track down some way to change the data not
only currently, but retroactively...

And then something crashes...and you restore the backup tapes...from 6
months ago because no one was checking the recovery process.  And you have
to figure out how to match up all the data you retconned on the live system
that you now recovered against the original data from 6 months ago.

All data changes, integer key data is the only way to keep things simple[I
love the 'internet' solution for XML, where you namespace things based on
your domain....and then 3 years later the company has changed hands, the
domain went to someone else...and you have this domain for some porn site in
your code...yick]

And by the same token that you can store more textual data in a row, you can
also store larger integers so you can never run out of them.


Then there are spreadsheets...  spreadsheets never ever die....  and
business people love them.  So try explaining to them why they have to have
a key identifier that is 300 characters long in order to match spreadsheet A
to spreadsheet B.

No, I see no reason to kill the humble ID.  Supplement it with extra data,
sure.  You can normalize your data to an extreme and still duplicate it in
every table if you wish.

Dealing with ID's can be painful from time to time for developers and admins
- but dealing with semantic data as a key is painful from time to time for
users.  And I am firmly in the camp of choosing to make life harder for a
few geeks who can handle it - then the end users who just won't get why it's
not a trivial matter to change their last name on every report ever filed in
the system because they fell in love and got married...

<puts on assembly language hat> Not necessarily, bit operations may 
generate more machine code instructions than a straight integer comparison 
would and therefore more clock cycles :-)

Disk space and memory truly were expensive...in the 90s. Joomla was
born in 2000 though.

Here's a (hopefully) interesting little story. I once got into a huge,
heated debate with a consultant about data modeling. His argument was
that random incrementing integers were bad design and negated the
benefits of primary keys. His biggest beef was that your table already
had a primary key - even if it was a composite key - and that slapping
an integer on there would only cause you pain in the long run.

This pain sounds a LOT like the data migration issues everyone has
with all these random, incrementing integers as primary keys :-)

For the record, the conversation was at ClassMates.Com waaaaaay back
around 1997. I thought the guy was a total loon. However the more I
think about it, the more I realize he was just ahead of his time. Back
then we still needed those integers for all the bazillion JOIN
operations across tables with more than fifty million rows each... As
everyone starts to denormalize their data models however, this will
become a bigger and bigger headache, as all your logic is tied to
those numbers when all that is really important to YOU is the post's
title, the user's username, component's name, etc.

So full normalization is no longer the non plus ultra of database design?

Here's a question I know you're all gonna love.

I'm considering writing a small desktop GUI app for my psychotherapist wife
to manage her patient records. It will run on Linux but I guess it would be
good if it's cross-platform. I think sqlite would be a good choice for the
backend. What's a good programming language for the front? It looks like
Python is a popular choice for this kind of scenario.

I happen to speak PHP, Java (went to the trouble of getting Sun-certified in
2006 but have rarely used the language), and Perl (though I was never a
black belt and haven't used it much for years). This would provide an excuse
to learn another language.

I would personally go with wxPython for this sort of task. I've used phpgtk
in the past but found it cumbersome and awkward. If she'll only be using it
on a windows box then VB is as good a choice as any.

You can't ask this question on a PHP list without at least considering 
PHP-GTK. It is cross-platform and uses PHP syntax. The GTK component 
just adds some extra classes that are used for the GUI.

I can recommend a book on the topic if you'd like :)

Have you considered Adobe AIR + HTML + Javascript?

So full normalization is no longer the non plus ultra of database

Perfect answer.  In the old days I be ranting about scripting  
languages, now it's WTF?  We are reaching I guess officially web 3.0   
At this point it's all GUI/js/xml driven.  Make It look awesome.

And then make it look even MORE awesome on the iPad. ;-)

I would also pick Qt since it runs on many many platforms and has bindings 
for several languages (C++, C#, Python, Ada, Pascal (!), Perl, PHP, Ruby).

Yeah, those bozos at Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo, and Google have no
idea what they are talking about. 3rd normal form was good for our
dads, and it's good for us too!

Seriously though: Take whatever popular PHP CMS you might have laying
around, and consider what it would take to migrate content from one
existing website to another website that also already has its own
content... I'm willing to bet all that data is "unique" to a bunch of
incrementally selected, absolutely meaningless integers.

Both databases are certain to have collisions with all those
auto_increment columns. If the design had instead stuck to uniqueness
(hey, sounds a lot like what a Primary Key is!) then you would only
have collisions with content having the same title, for example. But
instead, you're certain to have an article with an id of 1 on both
systems (despite being completely different content), same goes for id
of 2, 3, 4, and so on...

In the end you have to provide logic to your export/import process
that first pulls all of these meaningless pseudo-PKs and inserts each
content item one at a time, and then providing the necessary linkage
to menus, categories, etc. because they also relied on a bunch of
totally nonrelated, pseudo-PKs.

Go ahead and dismiss my points if you want - this point is a very
valid one, one that I initially dismissed as well.

Looks like you're making the same mistake :^P

    I'd question the wisdom of creating a GUI app for this.

    Us PHPers build web-based apps for this sort of business application 
all the time.  This kind of app can be deployed on a distant web server 
via https (which means she can access the app from anywhere she goes) or 
it can be deployed to a machine in her office (behind the firewall) 
running Apache or IIS.  Compatibility with Linux,  Mac, Windows and 
maybe even things like iPads is no problem.  Odds are you're going to 
wind up with a better UI in a web app than in a desktop app,  especially 
if it's the first desktop app you've written in years.

    In my mind,   the niche for desktop apps is small and always 
shrinking:  really,  they only make sense for cases where a web app 
can't do the job.  When you ~do~ want to make a desktop app,  the 
purpose is to make something really awesome that pushes the edges of the 
platform you're running on,  which means the native widget set.  
Cross-platform GUI toolkit have a special role for programmer's tools 
(Eclipse,  jEdit) because a lot of us like to take our toolset around,  
but other than that,  I think they serve a disappearing market.

Content doesn't worry me.  What gives me fits are configurations.

Content is easy to migrate, add 100 or 1000 to all the id fields of the
source data, set a new auto-increment number on the target database to be
higher than the highest number.  Export, import, call it a day.

But when you have a bunch of keyword lookup fields and have tied all THAT
together by id numbers...that can get...interesting.

Especially when your mapping one set of string data to another and half of
them don't directly correlate.

Now there I can see a good argument to forgetting the id mapping to the
keyword table.  Instead, you build the a keyword table with just the
keywords themselves.

It means a little more work when you have to change a keyword because
company A changed their name to Z... so every record with an A in it has to
be updated[or maybe you cheat and include a second column in your keyword
table, "formerly known as" - and whenever a record is retrieved that does
not have a match in the parent table, you go out and grab the parent...
 That works well for speedier migration/changing.  It runs into problems
when you have 2 keywords that where reworded a number of times and at
different points in time they both shared the same label.

It also means a lot more work in documenting your database.

Thanks for the replies.

@Scott: I wondered about PHP+Gtk, and will give it a look. Is your book
pretty much up-to-date?

As for Adobe AIR etc, truth to tell I don't really even know what it is
though I've heard of it. I'll do some reading. Qt, same answer. Not familiar
with it though I've certainly seen the term thrown around.

As for doing it as a webapp with https, that would be the easiest approach
and I've considered it. I still don't think I want to even get into storing
her sensitive data on a shared server or similar, so it would be stored on a
home network... but ours is a primitive home office, having one Ubuntu
laptop and one dual-boot desktop on which the kids are often running Windoze
for the sake of their games, but the AMP stack would be on Linux, so if that
box is the server and she wants to use this hypothetical app from the
laptop... bla bla sorry to bore you.  OTOH if it is a self-contained
standalone kind of thing and she wants to go from machine to machine...

...maybe I will go back to the webapp approach. Probably with belt plus
suspenders, i.e., run inside our firewall AND https.

Thanks again.

Not really. It is a few years old. To be perfectly honest, I wouldn't 
recommend spending money on it unless you are going to continue writing 
PHP-GTK apps. The IRC room on freenode is just as helpful and costs less.

Qt is C++, for the mainstream platforms (plus mobile), should deploy as
easily for any of those (for the kind of project you mentioned).
It's also the kind of stuff KDE is built upon and lately some of nokia's
stuff.

But yeah, why not a web app?
I guess people still feel "real", desktop apps are better.

A web app will allow for growth and backups. You separate the GUI from 
the app and let yourself focus on just the business logic. That also 
means she can upgrade or change platforms, or have her main computer 
down for service, and still get work done.

Best would be dinner theater.  I don't know what's playing at the triad
right now.

That way he can get off work and jet up town for dinner and entertainment.

It can actually happen on a work day, in case he wanted to hang out with the
family and relax on the weekend instead of dealing with traffic in the outer
boroughs.

You could send the person to a modern dance performance.  That might be a
nice change of pace.  Who ever does that?

I was a sign for the Paul Taylor Company the other day.  Rings a bell.
You could try the Graham Company.
Maybe, see what's going on with Alvin Ailey.

Check the Village Voice for local dance performances.

Baryshnikov can be good for a laugh. (He did a comedic piece once.  I
think.)  Maybe, he's still around.

Plenty to see in Manhattan.

But, I'm thinking like a girl.

If I was thinking like a guy, I might have other ideas.

                        Drupal makes me hAPI: open
                   source social publishing architecture

Drupal is open source social publishing software that empowers individuals,
teams, and communities to easily publish, manage and organize a wide
variety of content on a website as well as build more complex web
applications.  Tens of thousands of people and organizations have used
Drupal to power scores of different types of web sites, including community
web portals, corporate web sites, social networking sites, personal web
sites or blogs, and much more.

Drupal's roots extend deep into the Linux and Open Source communities.
Drupal had its "coming out" at the 2005 FOSDEM conference in Brussels and
early iterations were mainly developed on Linux.

This talk will cover the Drupal framework with an emphasis on architecture
and programming patterns while touching on a number of other topics such as
performance tuning and hosting integration as well as considering the
underlying reasons for Drupal's wide-ranging success, all served up with a
healthy smathering of awesome sauce.

The presentation will also include a short real world case study of a
Drupal SaaS implementation "the BeerCloud" (an Android and iPhone
application which uses Drupal as a backend)

    fopen('filethingy', 'a')
    passthru()
    exec()
    `echo "stuff" >> filethingy.txt`

Basically I am trying to find the most incredibly fast way to append to 
a file, and support a massive potential concurrency (think huge logging 
system for an ISP etc.).

Hi Ed,

I very much doubt exec-ing and then backticking (which is forks and
then execs again) would achieve the desired result.

One thing that might, would be to write a long-lived daemon that opens
the file(s) being appended to and waits for data on a named pipe. PHP
callers can just open the pipe, write data to it, close and move on.
The deamon would read the data and write it to the desired descriptor.
Meanwhile the calling PHP process is probably off doing other things
by then.

Mike

I know this is a board full of developers who love their hammers, but 
this job looks like it's not a nail. I'd try a Python or Perl daemon if 
you're looking for something incredibly fast.

Why not look into syslog-ng or mongodb's gridfs and/or capped collections?

Just wondering if you've checked these to avoid reimplementing the wheel :-)

I did check out the available source for them, but It's a slightly 
differing usage from those; It's looking like I'm going to build it in 
Java then...

Sorry I wasn't more clear in my OP, That was a list of the various 
writing mechanisms I am comparing... not the procedural order of the code.

Not to revive a dead issue potentially but I have been using Netbeans (Also
Java based.) with Mercurial for my development environment and I have never
looked back since.  This is coming from a developer who almost had a "VI"
tattoo on his calf.  It is pretty robust and version 6.8 is as solid as I
could ask for.  I do recommend you take a look at it.  There are Linux
packages available as well as binary install files for Windows users.  It is
actually so good that I have installed it on Windows and Linux so that when
I dual boot I feel comfortable in any environment.  Take a look here:
http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html.  You can download the PHP specific
build or just download the massive "ALL" option if there are other languages
you work with.

My big problem with PDT and Zend's work on the product is the lack of
speed.  Eclipse would slow down to a snails pace and then error out or exit
on me violently.  It became apparent that it was not the environment for me
when I lost a large chunk of recent work because the IDE couldn't manage its
own memory efficiently (Netbeans has an indicator bar to tell you how much
memory you are using and I have never seen it spike over 150mb).

Hope this helps.

-Anthony

I was discussing with one of the product development individuals at my
company the idea of implementing a live chat interface akin to Facebook.
Are there any existing open source initiatives (php based) that mimic this
behaviour or am I going to have to re-invent the wheel Facebook created?
Google unfortunately has failed me when I typed in the search term "facebook
chat php clone".  CometChat seemed like a good alternative but I cannot
understand the price jump from 49.99 for a branded license to a 129.99 no
branding version.

You could also look at using a Meebo chat room - they have a simple API 
and its free. Ive used their API.

I would go with XMPP in the backend, there are plenty of clients
available in different languages (including pure javascript).

How much development time does $80 buy you if that's the only reason
you're looking at rolling your own?

If I was the sole developer (which I am) $80 would be a steal but then I
have to worry about limitations of the software as well as the
ability/inability to add my own custom code to mould it to my needs.  I had
a chance to scan the XMPP website and I like what I see so far.  I am going
to spend an hour this afternoon learning more about the product and what is
involved in the implementation.  Thank you Dan and Ajai for the
recommendations.

Take a look at orbited (orbited.org). You can use that to connect to
existing chat protocols like jabber or whatever you want.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Anyone using Indeferno?
Message-ID: <4bffc351003210655u203f4114i60ac97dad21ad011@mail.gmail.com>

I gave redmine a try and it's good, let's me work the way I think and
all....integrates with Bazaar.....etc etc.

All the good stuff.

The downside though was that it just lacks  a decent templating system,
lacks some basic API's, etc.

At the end of the day...  to get to where I want to be I find I need to
change /something/.....

In the case of Redmine....it meant implementing a SOAP API in order to do
some integration with some tools that already have SOAP connectors but don't
have REST connectors...  And the Ruby kids are so down on SOAP that a lot of
the cool generators that are supposed to make Ruby on Rails so fantastic
don't really work well - and the Ruby answer is a smug "well, you should use
REST"...... given a choice between coding a new integration library in Java
or coding an API in Ruby, I would prefer to work in Ruby.

Wheras Indeferno, http://www.indefero.net/ is PHP.....which in theory makes
it easier to program for[of course, it uses it's own fun little
framework]...

It means switching to Mercurial or Git....but then those are more widely
used anyway, so it's not a hardship.

Figured I'd ask if anyone else has played with it before looking further
into that route.

Message-ID: <3719ecad1003220800n434c284et9d15c718d5e3707a@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking to analyze and speed up some of my queries by adding any
necessary indexes.  Is there a formula to follow in adding indexes to
multiple join queries?  I have made some attempts using explain but am not
sure I understand it all that well.

For example:
    $sql = "select dt1.*, d.* from
        driver d join
        (select `driver`, date(`leave`), sum(`points`) as pnts,
        sum(`xpnts`) as xpnts from check_head
        where date(`leave`) = '".$sdate."'
        group by `driver`) dt1
        on dt1.driver = d.id_num where `store` = '".$userStore."' ";

It depends on where the join is occurring.  If you have a HABTM 
relationship between the join tables then a index should be added to the 
pivot table.  If not then I would assume that the column you are joining 
on would be a candidate for an index.  Do these tables have a PRIMARY 
KEY already established?  Take for example the following tables:


/* create our habtm tags table */
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pictures_tags (
  picture_id int(11) NOT NULL,
  tag_id int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`picture_id`,`tag_id`),
  KEY `fk_tag_id` (`tag_id`),
  KEY `fk_picture_id` (`picture_id`)
);

On the pivot table I have added two foreign key constraints for look ups 
either by tag or by picture on the pivot table.  With an average load of 
ten pictures per tag it loads the picture set of ten tags in about .003 
seconds.  When adding indexes I never have found a magic formula to 
always use.  Just look for the basics (PRIMARY KEY) and then move onto 
any columns that you are joining on.

Hope this helps.

This looks like a pretty difficult query to tune.  There's a lot going on in your subselect - date functions, grouping, sum.  I'd skip the date() functions and do that conversion in php.  

Honestly, you're best bet is to denormalize this and have another table that stores exactly what you need (the points summed by driver and leave date and store).  Then you add indexes to leave date.  Every time you write to check_head, you also update the summary info in this new table.  When you select from it, you can query on just that table - no joins.  If you need more info on the drivers, gather up all of the unique driver ids in php, then issue another query with an "IN" in the where clause for all of the driver ids to get their info.  Then when you display to the user, iterate through the summary info and add in info about the drivers from your other query.  This way, you're only querying via indexes, not grouping or summing anything on the fly, and you're not even doing any joins.

You definitely need an index on driver.id_num if you don't have it already.  Going by the query as is, you need an index on check_head.driver too if you don't have it.  Mysql joins only perform decently if there are indexes on the columns you are using to join.

Good luck,
Rob

In addition to what others said...

There is a lot more instruction both online and offline, but here is a brief
example illustrating EXPLAIN:

http://www.experts-exchange.com/articles/Database/MySQL/3-Ways-to-Speed-Up-MySQL.html

The docs can be a bit dense if you're not familiar with what you are looking
for, but here it is for reference:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/using-explain.html

The first things you need to look at are the `type` and `ref`s columns. They
will tell you what, if any, keys are used. Another thing to look for is any
comments in the `Extra` column. If that has NULL, or 'filesort', or 'full
scan' then you have some work to do.

Finally,
I took a glance at the slides in this page and they look informative, but I
haven't watched the presentation. I will need to d/l it and watch it later.

Below are a couple of optimizations:
1:  add an index on the timestamp 'leave', and then change
WHERE DATE('leave') = $sdate
to:
WHERE leave > $sdate AND leave < ($sdate + INTERVAL 1 DAY);

This is because mysql never uses indexes when a function is on the
left hand side.

2. Do you really need the subquery?  I mean why not just use an inner join?
The query can probably be re-written as:

SELECT d.*, DATE(), SUM(), ...
FROM driver
JOIN checkhead dt ON dt.driver = d.id_num
WHERE dt.leave > $sdate ...
GROUP BY dt.driver

The fastest query plan is to filter the check_head to the day in
question, and then do the joins/groups on the small subset of records.
 You have to trick mysql into executing it that way.  If you have 3
years of data, and you should see a 1000x speedup by doing it my way.

There is no "formula" to follow, but you need to intuitively
understand how relational databases work to write fast queries.  As a
starting point, 1. index foreign keys
2. no formulas on the left side of a where statement
3. create indexes for columns in the where clause.

John Campbell

One caveat to this is that mysql will only use one index per table in your query.  So it can either use the index on the foreign key for the join, or it can use the index on the column in the where clause.  Sometimes, by creating a multi-column index, it's able to use that index both for the join and the where clause... but it doesn't seem to work in all cases.  The query profiler can help you figure out what mysql is doing - http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/using-new-query-profiler.html.  This gives you a lot more info than EXPLAIN.  With EXPLAIN, you can only check the key_len to try to figure out how much of your index is getting used.

By the way, you might want to make posts like this to the nyphp-mysql list because it seems to be watched by some experts in the mysql community.

Ouch.  You need to read up on how MySQL queries work.  There are sections 
in the manual that explain it pretty well.

Most importantly, it's a really bad idea to use functions on a column in 
a WHERE clause.  The function has to be run on every row in the table, 
then those results get compared to the value ($sdate in this case).

Second, joins only use indexes when you're joining tables.  Here, you're 
joining a subquery, so no love.

Third, don't delimit your identifiers.  If you're using identifiers that 
need delimiting, don't.

Fourth, start queries from the table where the WHERE clause does the 
work.

Try something like this...  Note, I'm leaving date(leave) out of the 
output since you didn't put an alias (AS) on it makes me believe you're 
not using it in your output because the likelyhood of you doing 
$row['date(leave)'] in your PHP is low.  Also, you better be sure the 
value of $sdate and $userStore are safe for use in a query / can't be 
tainted to perform an SQL injection attacks.

SELECT driver, SUM(points) AS pnts, SUM(xpnts) AS xpnts
FROM check_head
JOIN driver ON (driver.id_num = check_head.driver)
WHERE leave = '$sdate'
  AND store = '$userStore'
GROUP BY driver

I'm having trouble finding exactly where it says it.  The language on this page touches on it, but the way it's written it seems to assume that you already know it's only going to pick one index per table:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-indexes.html

If you run EXPLAIN, you'll see it only picks one index to use for each table.

Technically though, there is the "Index Merge" optimization introduced in MySQL 5 that gets it to use more than one index under certain conditions:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/index-merge-optimization.html

And don't forget indexes can be made on multiple columns:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/multiple-column-indexes.html

It's thrown around through some of the links Rob mentioned, but it's true
and notorious issue with indexing in MySQL.  Furthermore, indexes must be in
left-right ordering, if there's a multi-column index.  Things I suppose are
trying to improve a bit, but the rule is typically to create specific
indexes for every major type of query.

That may be true for the queries you ran.  If that's the case, you don't 
have enough rows for the optimizer to realize that using more than one 
indexes makes a difference.  Once you do, your EXPLAIN output will look 
something like this...

EXPLAIN
SELECT person_id
FROM person
JOIN person_status USING (status_id)
WHERE department_id = 11 AND status_id = 10 \G

*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: person_status
         type: const

          key: PRIMARY
      key_len: 4
          ref: const
         rows: 1

*************************** 2. row ***************************
           id: 1

You have two tables here and you'll see the second table is using the "index_merge" optimization that I mentioned.  So you're right, there is a few ways that mysql can use more than one index.

If you don't have enough rows, then the index is probably not being used because mysql only uses the indexes when they provide a significant enhancement over a full table scan (I know... throwing out another statement without a reference, but I think this is stated in the documentation page I send on how mysql uses indexes).

I'm looking for recommendations of Flow Charting software that's "Open

You could look into Dia:

http://projects.gnome.org/dia/

Is that the kind of app you are looking for?

How specialized do you need to get? I put some nice charts together using 
OOo's Draw and Impress. Looking for something to replace Visio?

Inkscape is open source and outputs SVG (as well as the usual formats).

David,

Perhaps you should ask this on a linux mailing list or superuser.com?

It seems off topic to me.

Yes, thanks Mitch and everyone else that responded.

  Justin, this isn't off-topic since it's Flow Charting for program  
design and the application is in PHP. Thanks for the resource of  
superuser.com, since I've never heard of it before.  I'll add it to  
the intranet.

Cool.  Before I would even look at flowcharting software I would sketch out
the program flow/navigation on paper.   A pencil is a miraculous thing.
Also a roll of yellow tracing paper can be magic.  :-)

Hi Edward.

I've done program flow charts on paper for years, but my hand-writing  
skills are horrible if I need to share this with others. It is a  
wonder why I didn't become a Doctor, although an Art Director told me,  
"Bad hand writing? That just means you are very expensive!".
