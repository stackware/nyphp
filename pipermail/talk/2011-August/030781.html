<PRE>If she doesn't need any modification go for Magento or other open source
e-commerce, if she needs custom e-commerce is the solution, con: needs time,
pro: total control on any features. After a few pretty bad experience with
os-commerce, I started to install my custom CMS with an e-commerce module to
all of my clients, here an example www.supermercatodellarotonda.com, easy
and clean.

</I>&gt;<i> Greetings All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been asked by my sister in-law to provide an ecommerce solution for
</I>&gt;<i> her small business. As I do not consider myself to be knowledgeable enough
</I>&gt;<i> in this area, I am posting to this list to ask your thoughts and
</I>&gt;<i> recommendations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For a &quot;small&quot; business with only a few products, I find PHP ecommerce
</I>&gt;<i> applications to be overly complicated and complex.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SimpleCart works very well from a small business perspective:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://simplecartjs.com/">http://simplecartjs.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your sister is editing her items directly, it just means you add a
</I>&gt;<i> little html markup to each item to make it an item which can be purchased.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a number of PHP scripts which have been written for different
</I>&gt;<i> platforms to make creating products simpler[for example, RokCart is a
</I>&gt;<i> simplecart implementation for Joomla! which adds a button on content editing
</I>&gt;<i> to set the price and such and create a product.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The downside of simplecart is that because it is all done via javascript -
</I>&gt;<i> there is very little you can do to stop malicious buyers.  If a buyer can
</I>&gt;<i> edit the javascript, they can go ahead and change the prices on the products
</I>&gt;<i> and then submit the sale and it will be processed.  This means your sister
</I>&gt;<i> would need to make sure to check the sales invoices in Paypal before
</I>&gt;<i> shipping products and make sure the price is correct.  Full fledged
</I>&gt;<i> ecommerce solutions often have this type of functionality built in - they
</I>&gt;<i> check invoice information returned by paypal and make sure it is valid - and
</I>&gt;<i> flag invalid transactions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a low end solution, but honestly I've run into a lot of people who
</I>&gt;<i> only get 3 or 4 sales via the internet a month.  Spending lots of time
</I>&gt;<i> and/or money to implement a high end ecommerce application is a waste.
</I>&gt;<i> If/When business takes off and it is taking too much time to process the
</I>&gt;<i> orders is when you upgrade[preferably to something that will support
</I>&gt;<i> something like Amazon Fulfillment so that you can automate the entire
</I>&gt;<i> process at some point].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not knowing what business your sister is in, another thing I'll mention is
</I>&gt;<i> to think very hard about whether or not to have a 'pick up' option for
</I>&gt;<i> purchases and if so, set a reasonable shipping and handling cost.  As an
</I>&gt;<i> example, a small art Gallery which expects to sell mostly within 200 miles
</I>&gt;<i> can be better served by offering local pick up and placing a 50-100$
</I>&gt;<i> handling charge on shipping paintings.   If you can get the buyer into the
</I>&gt;<i> gallery, then you have the chance to cross-sell other items.  If you ship
</I>&gt;<i> the item, it's a one time 500-1000$ sale AND packaging the whole thing up
</I>&gt;<i> properly is a pain.  So charge for that pain/inconvenience and encourage
</I>&gt;<i> buyers to come to the store.
</I>&gt;<i>
