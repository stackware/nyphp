Hans,

Happy to organize an osCommerce SIG but, being a relative newbie to nyphp,
need some help doing so.  Any sites/background information you can direct me
to/forward regarding other nyphp SIG's would be helpful.

Awaiting your thoughts,

Mark

We're all virtual baby! :)  I'd be happy if you wanted to start organizing
it; let me know.

Great; I think people will enjoy a osCommerce SIG (by the way, sorry for missing your previous message).  The other SIG NYPHP currently has is New York Front End (NYFE).  Dan Krook had setup that up, so he'd probably be the one to talk to.  Basically, maybe our first steps should be to get some web page up, describing the SIG, and then creating a mailing list.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed, Mark, andn let's take this discussion to the NYPHP-Development list (http://nyphp.org/lists)

i think the best thing for showing off oscommerce would be a complete case
study that could fit into 30-45 minutes.  something from start to finish
(hosting, php setup, ssl, payment, etc) ...

@ the moment im attempting to integrate phpbb w/ oscommerce (in terms of
menu + admin) ... much of the work has been more tweak/config related but i
can throw a case study together eventually.

why doesn't oreilly already have the book out??? :-)

Has anyone seen this one before? I'm working in a shared hosting
environment and I'm using session vars to pass values from form to form.
I grab the session id, append it to the URL and redirect to the next
form. Everything works well. HOWEVER, the strange thing is that no
matter how many times I play with the form, it always comes back with
the same session id (even though I'm using session_destroy).

Any clues?

I think session_destroy( ) just destroys the session DATA, but leaves 
the session mechanism intact

I posted a topic over on the forums under New York PHP ->
Technical Discussion -> AMP Technology
and titled it 'PEAR::DB_NestedSet'.

It probably should be under New York PHP -> NYPHP Staff ->
Dev Team ->  Nested Set Models Blow Chunks

I was going to move it via the moderator's control panel --
but the action looked like it could be pretty drastic. The
part about pruning everything made me uncomfortable.
It looks like you are supposed 'pin' things down before you
move topics from a forum.
I thought I better read up on what the heck I am
contemplating doing before pruning everything into oblivion.
Then my attention span expired (sorry).

Bottom Line: If anybody feels strongly that this is in the
wrong place -- feel free to move it.

I have this piece of data:
$data="blah blah<br /><?php popbig('holster'); ?>";

Popbig puts up a link to a javascript popup.

When I echo $data, I get the "blah blah<br />" but not the popbig.  I can't 
say I'm completely surprised because I didn't really expect it to 
work.  But how can I make it work?  Maybe write it out with hex characters 
or entities (doesn't really seem as though that would work either).

I hope this is clear; I can provide more script if necessary.

hmmm, thanks but this writes it out as data (not displayed because of the 
<> but in the source).  So it's there but it's not processed.  I fixed it 
by replacing the function call with the actual text of the function.  This 
seems a bit clumsy but at least it works.

A word of explanation:  I have some very similar pages which I'm converting 
to one page, with various display data in arrays and choosing which array 
by getting which one from the link to it.  Sometimes there is a chance to 
view a larger picture of the product.  So it's that link that I'm trying to 
get in here and there.  This means I'll need to repeat the language of the 
function every time it's needed, but still this is cleaner than a lot of 
different pages.  Or is there another way to do this?  (I think I hear 
somebody whispering "you need object orientation.")

Why do you try to call php within php?
When you say $data = ......, you are already within php. So it should
be:
$data = "blah blah<br />".popbig('holster');

Should you be in the html part then it looks something like this:

<body>....
blah blah<br /><?php echo popbig('holster'); ?>
.....
</body>

Hope this helps.

Wait.  I'm confused as to what you're doing.

I thought you were using this script to generate a PHP page which THEN got 
browsed.  Now, it seems the script you're writing is the browsed page 
itself.

In this case, you need to do something along these lines, depending again 
on what you're trying to do...

If you're trying to stick the string returned by popbig() (assuming you're
returning a string, and not using the function just to echo out strings)
into $data...

$data = 'blah blah<br />' . popbig('holster');

By the way, don't forget to put in means for people to examine your photos

Putting page contents in an array sounds wasteful.

Store each page as a file.  Store common headers and footers in two
separate files.  Include the headers/footers at the top/bottom of each 
page.  Then, in the body of each page, include your popbig() function as 
needed.

http://www.webkreator.com/php/concepts/counting-users-online-with-php.html

The following two URLs illustrate different approaches to the idea of showing "how many
users online" issue.  I am looking at two different sites where I am looking into implementing
this type of script; one that has mySQL and one that has no db access of any kind; both use
PHP 4.1.  

I (for once) understand what I would need to do to implement it; problem comes in as to which
solution would be the fastest, most efficient and most secure considering that one of them
deals with sessions (then there is the cookie issue, but that's another issue altogether,
see http://www.webkreator.com/php/configuration/php-session-security.html on security issues
and cookies/sessions).

What would one best recommend I use: the PHP/mySQL solution (for the non-db issue I would have
to write complicated XML procedures instead), or sessions?

Oh, more info:

Site #1 (has mySQL) is Linux/Apache ??/mySQL 3.23.41 and PHP 4.1
Site #2 (has no DB) is generic UNIX/Apache ?? and PHP 4.1

Thanx

I think both links you mention are fairly good, and secure.  Using the non-db solution (ie, it counts the number of session files in the tmp directory) would probably be slower.  And, you'd have to take notice of the expire time for the sessions; by default, the php sessions files hang around for quite a while, and you'd be getting false counts.  If possible, I'd go for the mysql method, but it obviously wouldn't work for the non-db site, and it might not fit with the architecture of the existing site.

Thanks,

Hans

I might be missing something, but won't counting the session files only 
work if you have one webserver?  You can totally forget about 
scalability with that solution, and building crippled solutions always 
struck me as a bad way of doing things, as you'll just have to redo them 
in a few months anyways.

So my vote is definitely for a db-based solution.  Ours uses a db, and 
it works well.

Message-ID: <000601c3a2c8$293e6620$bf8d3818@oberon1>


For users or Microsoft Outlook:
here's a tip on how to send text only email.

If you use the internal Outlook editor as the default editor (as opposed to
Word)
It is easy to make you email message text-only.

Just click on the Format in the menu bar on top, Then choose 'Plain Text' from
the
Drop down menu. (not sending in HTML format has the added benefit of not
attaching those
ATT0003.txt files which annoy some people).

If you want to turn off HTML format and you have some other email program you
can look at
the following: http://www.expita.com/nomime.html#programs.

Also Outlook users might want to search their help for "auto-format".
(auto-format is what usually makes me send out HTML format when I wanted to send

'Plain Text')

Sessions can be stored in a central database, shared among a cluster
(msession), and things like that.

If they're in a database, then you're using a database already.  And can
you do something as simple as the listed:

    $handle = opendir(session_save_path());
    if ($handle == false) return -1;
 
    while (($file = readdir($handle)) != false) {
        if (ereg("^sess", $file)) $count++;
    }
    closedir($handle);

...if you're using msessions?  Does it store a local file for each
session on each webserver in the cluster?

If not, then you're right in the same boat again.  Regardless, it seems
to make more sense to me to do it yourself in a database, then you have
full control over the parameters of the application and can adjust it as
needed (timeouts, data stored, parameters, whatever).

This sounds like a good solution, but I don't understand why you would
store a session cluster in a central database, in fact, why store sessions
at all if you have a database in the first place? According to the initial
information I received and researched on it, the DB solution doesn't
involve sessions at all; it involves storing the user's IP address instead
along with a session-like timestamp column; you compare the entered
timestamp field with the current time to compare whether the user is still
"in session" (simulated session you could say).

Phil,

You would still need a unique identifier (session ID) to identify the users.
Session data whether stored on the file system, database, RAM, etc. is still
session data regardless the storage medium.

I believe that 2 dimensional arrays need to break out of the echo statement
to print the string. By the looks of it, you are printing $PRODUCTS[$here],
which is an array, which is why it just prints Array, and php thinks [$here]
is printing the [ and ] characters, with the variable $here inside. I like
to break out of all my strings for arrays just to be on the safe side of
things.

When $PRODUCTS[$here]["v1b"]="holster"

echo "<a href=\"path/$PRODUCTS[$here][$j]\"... evaluates to path/Array[v1b]

Why this difference?  Thanks in advance.

I think in both instances you _should_ put $j in quotes since you are
going after the associative key/label.
why it works in the second and not the first? not sure.

PHP doesn't know if you're referring to a two dimentional array named
$PRODUCTS or some other potential weirdly constructed variable. They
way to solve this while still using double quotes is to place the
whole variable inside of {}s:

echo "{$PRODUCTS[$here][$j]}"

This "forced coersion" feature isn't well known.

Hi there.

I am trying to use the cURL functions to connect to a secure server, 
and it's failing with this error:

Error [60]: error setting cerficate verify locations

I don't know what this means.  Anyone with relevant experience they 
can share to save me some time?

Mark,

You're missing some info needed to help out.
i.e.   is it an apache server

but assuming apache:

you might try looking here:
http://www.apache-ssl.org/docs.html#SSLCACertificatePath

It looks (on the surface) like the server can't find the certificate path.

It was Keith who analyzed exactly what was happening:
$PRODUCTS[$here] --> Array
[ --> [
$j --> vib
] --> ]

Both the breaking out of quotation marks and Adam's { } "forced conversion" 
work perfectly.  I had already figured out breaking the variable out, so I 
just stuck with that.  Thanks again, guys.  And Brian, sorry about 
misspelling your name.

Actually, this is the way the pages are set up already:  everything is 
includes except the specific data for the page.  So then I thought:  this 
should be just one page with variable data; instead of ten pages each 2K, 
have one page 10K.  Smaller and faster.  This worked fine (once I got the 
coding correct) because the image display was formulaic.  But it broke down 
with the print stylesheet which can't be formulaic because it's dependent 
on the sizes of the images; so newpages have to be decided 
individually.  So I gave up on this.  The whole application isn't really 
large enough for the "smaller and faster" to make much of a difference (so 
in that sense it was kind of an exercise).

But what do you all think of the concept?  Is there something I was 
overlooking?

I posted a problem on www.phpfreaks.com about the means of determining if a
function you write will work by using array_walk to test a collection of
parameters.  Though I can verify that my function works by using scalar
parameters, using array_walk completely fails to work (though it does
produce a "true" output upon execution).

The thread of my discussion, along with code and further explanation of my
methodology, can be found here:
http://www.phpfreaks.com/forums/topic10189.php

I'm not in any major hurry, however, I would like to be able to
successfully use array_walk in the future and, so far, I cannot; every time
I use it the callback function never returns my changed value, even while
using a reference as a value parameter in the callback function (again, see
message thread).

Thanks

You can't use the return value of the callback function, and it's not passed back through array_walk().  array_walk() only returns a boolean, and if you take particular note of the last paragraph at http://php.net/array_walk

It sounds like you might find PHPUnit to be of interest.
http://phpunit.sourceforge.net/ I bet you can write a test that will walk
through an array of parameters and pass them to your function. It will
take a little work to set up, but the setup work will already be done for
the next test you write.

It's bigger and slower.  PHP now has to parse 10k of code instead of 2.  
Plus editing the content in such a way seems unwieldy.  I find it far 
more direct to manage items by file name.

Whatever is common between the pages should get templated.  Then, there 
are two options:  1) have the template include the content, or 2) have the 
content include the templates.  The approach you want depends on what 
you're doing.

Michael -

Thanks for the follow-up, I've been meaning to post my solution to list.

I decided on using Basketlib.. which ended up being the exact toolset that I
needed.  It's a real simple session management toolset.  It could be used
for keeping track of all sorts of visitor inquiry information.  For example,
if you were building a site for a used car lot and you wanted the user to be
able to email the owner of the site with a list of cars they are interested
in, this would serve as a good engine for that as well.  They could browse
the 'catalog', add to favorites list or whatever and then you could add the
code to email the list.

The documentation was good but I think I found a bug in one his examples.
in his REAME [sic] file, he states the following:

Here is sample code to enumerate the basket.

if ($basket->Get_Basket_Count()>0) {  # are there items in the basket

I found this to be incorrect, that it required me to change the comparison
operator from > to >=.

re: I need to provide an extremely user-friendly search function for a

Out of curiosity is that for a  Berylium2 site?
Are you searching for content that is already stored in a database --
or html pages?

I am just trying to get an understaning if its a good way to go. 
I have not implemented a full blown web based business application before but I have been doing a bit of looking around the net on the topic. It seems people say for anything that is not trivial and involves some tricky business rules go with full featured dbms, in my case that would be postgresql. For fast search/lookup stuff like many web stuff mysql may be faster. Then choosing mysql the option of stored procedures is no longer available. What I am afraid of is if I use mysql alot of my php code would be start looking like this start trabsaction->query->process->query->proces->query->end transaction.  If this is the case why not just put most of this mess in a stored procedure? 

I dont like this turn into another pg vs mysql thread. I like to hear how people made decisions on wheather they needed stored procedures on basis of their project requirements.

A mix of static and dynamic.
But it would be easy enough to write a crawler that loaded the text of 
all the static pages into a database.

I have one that I really like but it's a pearl search engine.

KSearch from KScripts http://www.kscripts.com . 

Easy to set up & can be as powerful or as simple a search as you want it to be. Uses flat files but should be plenty fast for a 400 - 500 page site. It may be able to use MySQL as a db but I don't remember off the top of my head.

Over the past few days I made substantial progress converting the first 
leg of a web application to "AMP".  Compared to my non-AMP production 
version, it is wonderfully fast and has me really energized to move 
forward.

I just want to thank the contributors to the NYPHP forum, as I have 
been trying to absorb the general types of advice regarding site 
structure, strategy, and coding practice. Even though I'm just 
scratching the surface, it has helped me a great deal already.

Hi everybody,

I'm experiencing an interesting problem with Apache 1.3 , php 4.3.3 (as so)
on Redhat linux 9 and I need your thoughts about this since I've spent
almost three days without any success and started to feel like kicking this
linux box. Here's the situation: I'm using php to connect to a java
interface to a proprietary so library. When I run the java interface class
code from the command line (java), as long as I set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
variable and java -cp option to include necessary jar files the code works
perfectly. But when it comes to using php interface, although
LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable and all related java paths, etc in php.ini are
set correctly, the java class code acts as these variables are not set and
returns an UnsatisfiedLinkError to the proprietary so library or a
NoClassDefFoundError. These two errors alternates without any specific
pattern during the php calls to the interface java library. One thing I've
noted is that, when I restart httpd service and open the php page calling
the java class, I first get the UnsatisfiedLinkError and then it starts
alternating. BTW, PHP calls to Java looks working perfectly since I don't
have any problems when accessing java.lang.System properties.
Any suggestions? Do you see anything that I'm missing or I should test?

Zillions of thanks in advance,

Kerem

Just got OS X Server.  Pretty much the end of my Linux days for now.  A 
  beautiful piece of software.  It looks like someone spend 6 months 
just designing icons.  And if you really need the command line, it's 
always there. I drop into vi just to keep my hacker roots intact, but 
otherwise I've been swept away.

And today I found out It includes QT Broadcasting with available 
plugsin's for live video streaming for the Japanese cell phone market, 
now that's kinda of radical.    :-)

The Java extension? Ugh. Thar be dragons. I hate to say that there's
really been no activity on this bridge in a year or two, so I'm not
surprised if you encounter bugs. Personally, I find it a miracle that
you can get get java.lang.System to work. :)

I can also tell you that any future Java extension development will be
PHP 5 only. So, unless you're providing patches, I wouldn't look for
any updates on the 4.x branch.

Sorry I don't have anything helpful to add here.

Hi mpm.

I have enjoyed the cascade calendar class for PHP:

I am using it for, among other things, the shipping/delivery date
calendar for tastygram.com (http://www.tastygram.com/).  (FYI, this
site is build in InterShop/Perl; just the calendar HTML is built
by PHP and then stuffed into a database...).

Jeez, the challenge is that there are so many to choose from. There are a
few at phpbuilder.com's code gallery, as I recall. There's even one I
wrote myself, if you want to look at it let me know and I'll put it
someplace public.

Don't return the modified value; assign it to the first parameter of
your callback function.

Well, further research yielded a solution, but leaves me with more
questions, such as:

1) Why does the PHP manual say that "array_walk" CAN change the values in
the array, when, in fact, it can't?
2) If 1 is answerable, does that mean the manual is either misleading on
array_walk, or, oh no WRONG?

Anyway I found the solution: don't use array_walk at all, use array_map
instead.  I would provide the URL to verify this but I am not sure how many
of you here at NYPHP speak fluent French for me to be able to provide it w/o
translation.  On second thought, I will anyway to verify my claims in the
belief that there are Francophones among you:

yes it can!

>From the manual:
Note: If function needs to be working with the actual values of the array,
specify the first parameter of function as a reference. Then, any changes
made to those elements will be made in the original array itself.


Some code to test:
<?php
$arr = array('a', 'b', 'c');
var_dump($arr);
function change(&$array, $index) {
	$array = 'I have changed you!';
}

array_walk($arr, 'change');
var_dump($arr);
?>

The output:
array(3) { [0]=> string(1) "a" [1]=> string(1) "b" [2]=> string(1) "c" }

array(3) { [0]=> string(19) "I have changed you!" [1]=> string(19) "I have
changed you!" [2]=> string(19) "I have changed you!" }



Oh my, it works !! Great job PHP Team !

Ok, Daniel, let's investigate here:

1) what version of PHP are you using? I am using 4.1.3

2) Why does your work, here is mine and it does NOT work!

<?php

 function change(&$array, $index) {
  $array =  strtoupper($array);
}

$blah = array('a', 'b', 'c');
var_dump($blah);
array_walk($blah, 'change');
var_dump($blah);

?>

Go to http://valsignalandet.com/aablah.php and see the results.. It does NOT
work!!!

However, yours does (go to http://valsignalandet.com/aablah2.php) Here is
the code I copied:

 <?php
 $arr = array('a', 'b', 'c');
 var_dump($arr);
 function change(&$array, $index) {
 $array = 'I have changed you!';
 }

 array_walk($arr, 'change');
 var_dump($arr);
 ?>


Why does yours work and mine does not, exact same logic only different
methodology, one returns a result, the other does not..  That is not enough
proof to just say "Good job PHP Team" and declare array_walk saves the
universe from eternal peril.

Marv Albert here with the instant replay... including the behind the 
scenes action!!!

Phil learned of the array_walk() function, but he didn't fully read the
manual about it, so couldn't get it to work.

Phil goes ahead and posts in several places about it:
  * Here on the NYPHP Talk mailing list
  * http://forums.nyphp.org/index.php?s=6a864e7ce96614312a68fc4f4b5a0fa2&showtopic=52&st=0&#entry150
  * http://www.dbforums.com/t968865.html
  * http://www.phpfreaks.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=38181#38181
  * http://groups.google.com/groups?q=powell+array+walk+php&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=1cdca2a7.0311061401.6f9bed04%40posting.google.com&rnum=1

Then, back here on the list, Adam is kind enough to tell him how to get it 
to work.

But Phil still misses the point and thinks he's found a bug in PHP or the 
manual.

Now, Daniel goes to the manual for Phil and cuts and pastes the crucial 
text from the manual right here for him, PLUS provides an example.

Folks, stay in your seats, the game's not over yet!!!

I never wonder why you give me a hard time.  I just wonder why you can't
provide solutions as your name suggests.

An array is not a string. That's your problem.

As for thinking that there is a bug and your general approach to asking
questions, you should really take the time to read this:

http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

Specifically, this is relevant:

--------------------------------------------------
Don't claim that you have found a bug

When you are having problems with a piece of software, don't claim you
have found a bug unless you are very, very sure of your ground. Hint:
unless you can provide a source-code patch that fixes the problem, or a
regression test against a previous version that demonstrates incorrect
behavior, you are probably not sure enough.

Remember, there are a lot of other users that are not experiencing your
problem. Otherwise you would have learned about it while reading the
documentation and searching the Web (you did do that before complaining,
didn't you?). This means that very probably it is you who are doing
something wrong, not the software.

The people who wrote the software work very hard to make it work as well
as possible. If you claim you have found a bug, you'll be implying that
they did something wrong, and you will almost always offend them ? even
when you are correct. It's especially undiplomatic to yell ?bug? in the
Subject line.

When asking your question, it is best to write as though you assume you
are doing something wrong, even if you are privately pretty sure you have
found an actual bug. If there really is a bug, you will hear about it in
the answer. Play it so the maintainers will want to apologize to you if
the bug is real, rather than so that you will owe them an apology if you
have messed up.
--------------------------------------------------

Hope that helps.

Chris

According to the manual:

Applies the user-defined function function to each element of the array
array. Typically, function takes on two parameters. The array parameter's
value being the first, and the key/index second. If the optional userdata
parameter is supplied, it will be passed as the third parameter to the
callback function.

[see http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-walk.php]

This then indicates $array, which Daniel used as his parameter name, is NOT
an array, BUT a string, as is also in my case, lest his assignment:

$array = 'I have changed you!';

Be invalid because you are assigning a scalar value to an array (using
http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php in the manual as my
backup), so therefore, I believe $array is a string, not an actual array,
based on these findings.

Phil,

Chris must have been mislead by my stupid naming convention! I should never
have named an array element $array....

Then perhaps you should call it $element or something that makes sense.

If Daniel's example does what you need, and you want to find out what is
wrong with your own, alter one thing at a time in his example to make it
exactly like yours and test after each change.

One of these things is not like the other. One of these things doesn't
belong...

Phil,

Please take your personal thoughts off this list. We have over 1,300
subscribers, and we shouldn't be filling in their mailboxes with off topic
emails.

And now back to PHP :) Could you recheck your version. Dan mentioned that
the one you are using shouldn't exist!

Thanks,
Daniel

That's a perfectly valid line of thought, and is exactly why MySQL will be getting stored procedures in the next major release.  MySQL/PGSQL are difference animals, at least for the moment, and excel in different areas.  You might even consider using both for a very large project.  That said, there is business logic and then there is business logic.  Pick the database(s) that are correct for the project, but don't pick something because of buzzwords (like "business logic goes in stored procedures") and be sure to define your tasks well.

It's a tough call.  I still have not been romanced by PGSQL, but certainly see it's value.  As a side note, we'll be having a great presentation on PGSQL from one of the core developers in Jan or Feb.

Many thanks Michael.  As this list continues to mature, I'm so happy to hear people are finding value in it and with AMP Technology.

Thanks again.  Notes like this make it great.

i just installed php on a zaurus (w/ openzaurus 3.2) and wrote some small
cli networking scripts to test out php embedded and they work fine but does
anyone know if there are ui options i could use or how to go about
cross-compiling a library like libncurses or qpe/qt for it?  im trying to
use it for mapping.

The performance of stored procedures over regular queries can be substantial. I'd recommend writing up a typical query as a stored procedure and run a benchmark. Then put it into your app and try it, and see if there's a noticeable difference.

I see the MySQL dudes plan to add stored procs in 5.0 and triggers in 5.1,
so the arms race continues (got to maintain the balance of terror!).

I wonder when the PGSQL dudes plan to make it a little easier to play with
PGSQL on Windoze systems.

There was some discussion at the conference on this topic actually.  From what I understand, PGSQL sees that Windows will not be worth supporting for real production deployment and so it'll most likely be on the back burner.  In fact, a BSD family OS (like FreeBSD) is deemed the best environment for PGSQL.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] smtp socket error that i just don't get
Message-ID: <E1AIEmc-0006bk-Ru@server1057.webserver33.com>

Hello all,
 
I'm hoping you guys can lend a hand... Below is some code I grabbed from the
manual (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mail.php) for sending mail directly
through the socket rather than using the mail command.  Now it works well on
my server, but when I installed it on my client's server, I get an endless
loop of errors like so:
 
Notice: fputs(): send of 41 bytes failed with errno=32 Broken pipe in
/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/bostonindoorgames/admin/mailer.php on line 136

Notice: fputs(): send of 42 bytes failed with errno=32 Broken pipe in
/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/bostonindoorgames/admin/mailer.php on line 136
 
The code is below, and line 136 is right under the comment // --------
PROBLEM STARTS HERE!!! ----------------
 
Now, as I mentioned, this same code works on my server just fine.  There is
surrounding code, but it's all involved in setting the vars and such for the
email itself.  I assure you all vars are set properly, as I've checked them
at least 6 times.  I thought that there may possibly be some kind of socket
issue, but then wouldn't it have a problem connecting to the socket in the
first place? Or even sending the HELO command after the connect?
 
When searching for the error, I came up with this (which is a ll gibberish
to me):
 
Broken pipe
===========

This condition is often normal, and the message is merely
informational (as when piping many lines to the head program).
The condition occurs when a write on a pipe does not find a
reading process. This usually generates a signal to the executing
program, but this message displays when the program ignores the
signal.

Check the process at the end of the pipe to see why it exited.

The symbolic name forthis error is EPIPE, errno=32.

   $connect = fsockopen (ini_get('SMTP'), ini_get('smtp_port'), $errno,

I've been meaning to clean it up and seperate it out into it's own PCOM, which I've begun to do at:

http://posit.nyphp.org/~praxis/pas/

It's basically modeled after TCP sequence numbers.  However, unlike a true TCP/IP connection between two systems, a browser-server relationship is one sided.  That is to say, the client (browser) can't maintain it's own sequence numbers.  This means that my sequenced sessions implementation is probably a bit weaker than the true TCP/IP scheme.  Details of TCP/IP are in sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. of http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc793.html

I've honestly just thrown the code together, but I'm curious if people can break it.  It should be able to detect when a session becomes out of sync, and I'd love to hear ideas for making it better, or ways it can be broken - and even if in fact it works at all :)

The mail server is probably not liking something about what you're sending it; either here, or later in the code.  I'd begin to replace the simple:  $rcv = fgets($connect, 1024);  with some debugging that prints what the actual mail server's response is, for instance:

$rcv = fgets($connect, 1024);
trigger_error($rcv);

Add this each time you try to send something to the mail server and see if it's having a problem.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Advice: Too many mysql connections. 
Message-ID: <8F6336C4-119A-11D8-A40D-003065778656@plusfour.org>

Hello,

I need some support.

There is a site I do sys-admin type stuff for, that consistently has 
Too Many MySQL connections. Today, it happened 3 times already.

Here is some info.

Hardware:
Dual Pentium 4, 1.8 GigHz, 40 Gigs SCSI Raid, 512 MB Ram.

Server Software:
Apache 1. 3.27, PHP 4.3.1, MySQL 4.0.12 Max

Here is the my.cnf file.

[mysqld]
bind-address=127.0.0.1
set-variable = ft_min_word_len=2
set-variable = max_connections=300

The developer uses a phplib based database class. On average each 
'page' is using 3 instances of the database class. The connect method 
is using mysql_connect();. The developer is re-working the db class so 
a maximum of instance of the class will be initialized on any page 
load. The site is used book dealer, and relies heavily on the full_text 
indexing of about 100,00 records.

The site gets a lot of traffic. According to webalizer, it gets been 
getting about 20,000 'Visits' a month. There are not any other sites 
running on the computer. It is just this site.

MyQuestions.
What are your opinions regarding 1. Hardware, is there enough ram on 
the box to handle increasing the 'max_connections' to 500. 2. Which 
my-*.cnf should we be using. Everything is basically the defaults.. 
Here is a link to the results of the show variables.

http://plusfour.org/mysqlVariables.txt

2. At what point do i give the my-large.cnf a try.. how can I test it.. 
3. What are the pear classes for load testing?

Thanks for any suggestions.

Ian

Yes, probably. I frequently push MySQL up to 4096 connections. All you
need to do is use top to tune your server. Also, use the prebuilt binaries
MySQL AB offers if you're going to be pushing MySQL hard. I've experienced
random crashes under heavy load when using a binary built from source.

I've looked into this at one time, and came up dry.  AFAIK, if you're on Windows you need an ODBC interface, and thusly myodbc.

Mostly as an FYI, keep in mind mysql_connect()'s behavior.  If a connection already exists with the same host, user and password information, the connection will be reused by default.  This means that even if 3 objects are created, they should be using a single MySQL connection (assuming they have the same connection information).

I would most likely say "yes."  Of course, use the standard utilities to determine system state (top,free,memfree,mem,vmstate,/proc,etc, depending on the platform).  Also keep in mind the limit on file descriptions.  I don't remember off hand what default values are, but MySQL is generally file descriptor heavy.

I'm not seeing anything shockingly wrong here.  There are some formulas to dig up and tweaks you could make, but since the issue seems to be connections now, this should probably wait until the box is humming along in a reliable state.

512mb is not a large RAM system, and I'd hesitate making a change like that without first seeing how it responds to an increase in the max connections.  Personally, I'd write a quick script for load testing so I can't be much help there either.

What about accessing a MS Access database from a LAMP system?  I would
like to ftp the database to the Linux server, and be able to get to it
from PHP.  Has anybody been able to do that before?

Is there something that keeps you from using MySQL on the system where
access runs?
I'm just curious.

I would say export your Access DB as a CSV and use phpMyAdmin to import
it into mySQL. If you have to get the data back out and into Access, you
could dump it out as CSV using phpMyAdmin.

I don't think you can "run" Access on a linux server, or open it in any
other way. I could be wrong, because I would never try it.
You might be able to put Access on a Windows server and have php connect
to it. I don't think I would ever try that myself, either.

This is one of the stranger queries I've seen on this list. The "M" in
LAMP is for "m"ySQL, not "M"S Access. Contemplating accessing MS Access
from LAMP is a little contradictory.

If you're stuck with your MS Access database, this would be one of those
times (if I didn't hand the work to someone else), that I might consider
just using ASP on a Windows box (ugh).

good luck

Exporting it to CSV wouldn't include the structure, though. Is there a 
way to dump a MS Access DB to SQL + data the way you easily can with 
MySQL so you could just transfer it?

Could be useful. Say if you wanted to have an office LAN MS Access db 
with client data to access with Outlook, and you could sync it with 
MySQL to have it available for web based apps.

Unfortunately, our local swim team uses a vendor application that runs
only on Windows, and uses Access.  The meet results, etc. get entered
into it that way.  However, I run a web site on a LAMP platform, and
would like to be able to query the DB real-time from PHP.  So, it's read
only, which should make it easier.  I will try the links that others

Is there something that keeps you from using MySQL on the system where
access runs? I'm just curious.

No what I meant was is there a reason you couldn't run a version of MySQL
on the Windows box. That way you might be able to have MySQL on the
Windows system reading the info with a somewhat more native(?) odbc and
let the Windows MySQL replicate the data up on the LAMP machine. Never
tried replication -- but it might be less painless than the Linux odbc
route.

for a long time ive been tunneling mysql connections + finally looked into
an ssl connection to a box @ home and came across the conlusion that you
can't use the ssl php connection (like with using mysql client w/ --ssl
flag) without using the php5 mysqli functions (specifically
mysqli_real_connect, its c counterpart) ...

from the docs the only thing im trying to figure out is if you need to
connect and then set ssl via mysqli_set_ssl on the connection itself?

how can one attempt this < php5?

No good.  The Windows box is just my laptop.  The server hosting our
swim club is a shared server, running Linux.  I don't have any other
server on the Internet itself, so it has to be that one.

Hmm, that's an interesting point.  While the mysql_connect() docs at php.net don't mention MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL as client flag, I think it is valid (in very recent versions of PHP).  Jon, I'd be interested to know if you're able to get it to work, and if so, it's a documentation bug at php.net.

People,

I am trying to translate a ASP site to PHP, but I encounter is ASP some code
for session time out.  Is there session time out variable in php
so that the php automatically logout after certain of ianctivity?

This is the ASP code:
--------------------------
Response.Expires = -1000 'Makes the browser not cache this page
Response.Buffer = True 'Buffers the content so our Response.Redirect will work

'-----setting session timeout to 1400 minutes----
Session.Timeout = 1400
--------------------------


Thanks,

Nestor :-)

It sounds like you might be talking about session.gc_maxlifetime, see
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php

Then again maybe I've misunderstood session.gc_maxlifetime so when someone
sets me straight, I'll learn something too.

Actually i think there are a few more steps ... what you need to do is
provide the cookie with a timeout:

session_set_cookie_params(int time - ms)
then set a timeout for the cache (depending on ur setup)
session_cache_expire(int time - m)

To get accurate timeout working you need to include before every
session_start();  Not to mention other timing adjustments:

You are probably familiar with the following:
http://asp2php.naken.cc/notes.php

where Michael Kohn writes:
"Time and Date functions aren't fully supported at this time. There was a
reason for this, but since I haven't worked on that in a while I don't
remember why."

This fact will probably not be of any immediate help to you (sorry) -- I
am mentioning this as a sort of a warning that there are some differences
between ASPs concept of time PHPs (concept of time) which may present some
'gotcha's down the road.

I'm not sure what Mr. Kohn means by this (even after reading the above URL).  PHP's time/date functions are some of the most accurate and stable (they are wrappers on the underlying C libs), especially on a UNIX system.  Granted, Windows' munge of what a date/time is may cause some confusion; but UNIX timestamps have been around longer :)

In response to Nestor's original question, the only "foolproof" method of timeing out a session is to store it outside the session data itself.  This is to say that timing out a cookie can be forged, and this is probably the method the previous ASP code uses.  The only true method for timeouts, or just about anything sent to a browser, is to record the data privately and send only an ambiguous key to the client.

Thanks very much, for the tips. I am going to make something to open up 
http connections till the connection results in a 'too-many mysql 
connections' error page late at night. I'll keep track of how many 
connections are opened. I'll trade in the different my-*.cnf config 
files and see what happens.

When we tried setting max-connection to 500 using our existing minimal 
my.cnf config, we could not access the server via http, ssh, etc.. I'll 
see what happens after load tests. That way I can have some concrete 
data. Maybe its time for more ram.

Again, thanks for the tips.

Ian

I think he means you can't use his stuff to automatically convert asp to
php because of what you pointed out namely:

> ... Windows'

> UNIX timestamps have been around longer :)

I meant the post to be a friendly reminder to watch out for the
discepencancies in the representation of time which (can) exist when going
from asp to php.

I certainly didn't mean to imply that one time representation was better
than the other. I think its safe to say that both are accurate -- just
different.

Settings in the php.ini file have an important
effect on the operation, security and reliability of your application.
For example, setting register_globals to a value of "on" makes it easier to
pass variables from one script to another, but opens serious security
vulnerabilities--so best practice is always to set it "off."

What settings do you consider essential?  How should they be set, and why?

In next month's PHundamentals, we'll discuss how to manage these settings 
most effectively.

Hi Folks:

I've whipped up a patch file in Unifed Diff format which I apply to my new 
PHP 5 installations.  Do note, this is a _development_ environment, so not 
all settings are appropriate for a live deployment.  But, this patch file 
approach is helpful tool for upgrades, regardless of what settings you 
use.

Enjoy!

Alot of shared hosts set register_globals to off in their php.ini file.  If one needs to run scrip with register_globals to on then a nice trick exists. In .htaccess file one  can set  'php_value register_globals 1'

Also I seen programs that dont like magic_quote_gpc to be set to 1 to its one can also set that value to 0 in .htaccess file.

well, for one, error_reporting should ideally be set for "all errors" 
(E_ALL)

But when using someone else's code, Notices (E_NOTICE) may have to be 
turned off.  If not, you may get lots of "benign" Notices being thrown 
because the programmer was not careful to code using good practices. 
(e.g. testing a variable when it was never set or reset should throw a 
Notice).

Also, there are times when you might want to have display_errors set to 
"On" when developing, but turned off when the site goes live site so the 
user doesn't get nebulous error messages that they can't do anything 
about anyway.  Logging to a file is recommended.

When needing to do File Uploads, upload_max_filesize defautlts to 2M. 
Handling large [graphic] files may be a problem if this is too low.

It is best to code with the short_open tags set to "Off", and use <?php 
in all cases, but again, if using someone else's code, they may have to 
remain on.  This option will be defaulted to "Off" in a future release, 
I believe.

Session save path differences between Linux/Unix and Windows boxen
(/tmp vs. c:\temp) or whereever you choose to save session info. 
Whether session cookies will be used, or not for some.

A segment on magic quotes meaning and usage is essential.  Perhaps 
someone can volunteer that one.

The usual info about register_globals, max_execution_time caveats, 
working with output_buffering enabled, needs to be included.


There are no doubt other goodies, but these are the ones that come 
quickly to mind.

Also on some servers that use php as um.. Not a module (cgi?), they may
sometimes allow you to have your own php.ini in your directory, so you can
set 'register_globals=0' locally even if the server has them on.  I do the
same for overall error reporting on a site by site basis.

The local .htaccess and php.ini can be real life savers in vhost settings...

Well, here is one contribution:

display_errors   off
log_errors       on
error_log        /var/log/php_errors

The path to the error_log is not as important as not displaying errors to
the end user. This is for a production environment; errors on the screen
are handy during development. :-)

This is pretty obvious, but since we're talking Phundamentals, it bears
pointing out that the php.ini settings that cannot be overridden at
runtime with ini_set() or via .htaccess probably merit special
consideration, since you can't change them without editing php.ini and
restarting apache.

Of course, if you don't control the server, then you don't control the
PHP_INI_SYSTEM values at all, so it's moot. http://www.php.net/ini_set
is essential reading.to find out which are user-overridable and which
aren't.

My $.02: some of the ones I like to customize in php.ini, where possible
are error_reporting (E_ALL for development); include_path (something sane
for convenience's sake, but not too long for performance's sake);
register_globals (off); display_errors (on, for development); log_errors
can be your friend too.

Its normal operation. Everything in .htaccess applies to the directory the file is in and to all the directoried below.

i currently use apache on the outside to specify certain php.ini values with
<IfDefine>, example:

/usr/sbin/httpd -DEV

<IfDefine EV>
<VirtualHost *>
ServerAdmin foo at foo.com
DocumentRoot "/var/dev/www"
ServerName dev
# php stuff
php_value auto_append_file "/var/dev/dev.inc"
php_value error_reporting "E_ALL"
</VirtualHost>
</IfDefine>

One thing it lets you do more easily is within the append file include dev
mysql settings vs. production values (ssl cert, user, pass, etc) ...

Also, since it kinda pertains to php.ini but using php as a shell CLI it's
worth I guess pointing out the 3 flags (-n to use no php.ini - giving you a
"vanilla" php and -c to show where to locate a php.ini and -d key=value to
set a value @ runtime).

Is there a specific reason for this? I mean for register_globals we
understand the risks involved, but why should the short tags not used? Just
wanting to clarify this.

I tend to leave /tmp in place for session save path on my windows
installations and create a tmp directory in the root of the webserver's
drive. i.e. if apache is on D:, the /tmp will map to D:\tmp.

This is definitely not true. This gets brought up on php-dev from time to
time, and it always gets shot down. I know Rasmus, Zeev, and Andi are very
much against either disabling short tags or defaulting them to off, so I
can't see this ever happening.

Of course everyone has an opinion about register_globals.
Since it was defaulted to "off" I've learned to live with it think it's
the right thing to do.

If you're using third-party warez that need it "on," you could include
something at the top of each page that defines the EGPCS vars as regular
global vars. You'd have to put it on every page, but better than fixing
every reference to a register_globals var instance in the code.

Speaking of EGPCS,

I find this to be a more useful setting than just GPCS:

variables_order    EGPCS


short_open_tag    on

why not? fewer keystrokes and the file extension is already .php.
Moving to a server with it off? Just do a grep on all the files... easy.
also, makes reading inline var includes much easier
<?=$varname? or <?php=$varname?>

this is not really a big deal, but i was wondering how other template
engines besides Smarty deal w/ null,empty characters when using "default"
settings ... for example:

$val = '';
$smarty->assign('code',$val);
$smarty->display('code.tpl');

{$code|default:"N/A"}

in Smarty a non-existant(NULL) or length of 0 would give me the default but
might not always be the case on what id want (for example if it exists but
the length is really 0) ...

On a side note:

A good way to get script specific register globals support without having to
modify every program to call some other script is to in your apache config
add a line to your virtual host:
php_admin_value auto_prepend_file /wwwPath/registerGlobals.php

In php.ini turn register_globals off.

The registerGlobals.php script took the view of which scripts are converted
to support register_globals off, added them to an array and if the script
being loaded was not in that array I emulated the action of register globals
manually. Now when I redo an existing script I can make it register globals
safe add it to the array and hopefully one day I will be able to turn it off
in the ini file.

The down side of this is for includes. If you include another script that
requires register_globals on then the calling script must not be in the
array until all the includes are fixed.

Adam, Dave, and I spoke on a PHP Panel recently for a bunch of CEO and CTO
type people. It was pretty revealing to me, because most of these people
considered themselves to be way ahead of the curve by being interested in
PHP, and it was as if PHP was considered bleeding-edge technology.

I think PHP might be penetrating the enterprise much like Linux did
originally. Instead of people using Linux as a declared platform, it was
simply the tool of choice when the task was to build a Web server, name
server, firewall, mail server, or whatever. I think in the same way, PHP
is used a lot of times when developers are asked to create a Web
application of some sort. The application is the important part;
management doesn't care so much about the tools you use to build it.

Of course, Linux was in the enterprise the whole time, and companies like
Google prospered while using it. The same can be said of places like Yahoo
for PHP. But, the technologically savvy companies are always going to be
making the best choices. What is more interesting, in terms of numbers
alone, is when the non-savvy companies pick up on something. This is where
PHP is just now knocking on the door, and this makes up a very large
percentage of the enterprise. PHP is just getting started. :-)

When it comes time to post job openings and such, I think the management
just throws around words that they have heard. The more savvy companies
have people that know what they're talking about write the job
descriptions, make the job postings, and perform the interviews. I think
these types of places will be in the minority for a long time, so we will
only see PHP dominate job postings once it becomes a word that managers
associate with Web development. It will happen, eventually.

52% of Apache sites (Apache accounts for about 67% of websites?)... so
php is found on about 35% or one-third of ALL sites 

http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html
"the survey would have shown that PHP has grown to be roughly equal to
Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP)"
But Microsoft web servers only account for 21% of webservers.


Did I do this right?

"Little-known," indeed.

Exactly. I think PHP is doing what Linux did but with a 4 or 5 year lag.

In 1998 I was at a conference of newspaper (online and offline) publishers.
On a panel about open source I made the (I thought then) optimistic
prediction that Oracle would release a Linux port of their database software
in a few years. Most people there thought I was, to put it politely, way too
optimistic. Oracle released a Linux port six or nine months later. Both I
and my detractors were wrong.

I don't know if there's an analogous PHP event like the Linux Oracle port
(Yahoo! using PHP maybe) but PHP is still sort of in the stage that Linux
was back then -- all of the technically savvy people are aware of it, it
does a fabulous job at a certain well-defined set of tasks, it needs way
better marketing and corporate backing, and there are crucial "enterprise"
(ugh, I hate that word but it's handy shorthand) features that it still
needs.

Whether PHP will follow in Linux's penetration success depends hugely, IMHO,
on the marketing and corporate backing piece (which leads to the
feature-adding piece). When there are more companies, more larger companies,
more well-publicized and well-publicizing companies that provide for PHP
things like systems integration services, round-the-clock support, patent
indemnification, pre-configured hardware and software, first-class
benchmarks, reusable class libraries, application servers, and everything
else that makes Fortune 1000 IT VP's sleep soundly at night, then PHP has a
fighting chance to become more than a "little known scripting language".
Netcraft surveys impress engineers. Magazine covers impress managers. Like
it or not, that's the way the IT world works.

Some of these are technical issues, but most of them are not, and that, I
think, is PHP's biggest weakness. There are a lot of brilliant technologists
hacking away on PHP but there are not very many brilliant marketers or deal
makers. However distasteful that kind of thing is for programmers, it's
absolutely necessary to break out of the geek ghetto and become the kind of
phenomenon that Linux is.

It's been several days since I read that article, but I think the part you
quote was stating that no similar survey is performed on IIS, but if one
was, it would likely show PHP to be as popular as ASP, even on Windows.

On a similar note, I recently attended a Novell Linux semimar populated 
primarily with technical people.  I sat in my usual place in the back 
where I could see "the show of hands".  It was interesting that out of 
more than 150 people, less than 5 raised their hands when asked who knew 
about things like the Mono project and the Evolution package, and 
others.  The ingredient Novell brings to the table is marketing -- and 
along with it, decent product naming skills :)  I could site examples, 
but it's pointless...

the first time I got caught in a PHP vs. Java debate it had mainly to do
with the fact that normally if there was a security issue it was forced up
fixing the virtual machine itself which meant you had to wait for Sun's
patch/rebuild.  I see more and more PHP security bugs come out everyday but
they are mainly XSS/SQL + other items which can't really pertain to the PHP
language itself but it will still get the rap, because of the coding I
guess(?) ... but alot of the "PHP sucks" people I speak w/ have issues with
the eyeball  popping debugging and the security still, yet its funny that
they will still sit and wait for patches before continuing work.

Amen. Job recruiters squawk out a bunch of techno-babble buzzwords just

Well what I don't get is why so many programmers (and hence the bosses who
do the hiring and firing) become 'enraptured' (as in 'rapture of the
deep') with Java. Perhaps given that it is only prudent to look and see
how a certain component is actually being implemented before you use it.
And given the fact that one has to go so deep into any given Java
framework -- i.e. though mounds of javadoc cluttered with structures and
interfaces that are not germaine to the task at hand -- to find the
'active ingredients' of a component, they do suffer from a lack of
something to the brain when they (the programmers) stay down there too
long.

Indeed. The first question in the last "general intro to PHP" talk I gave
was "I heard that PHP has lots of security problems. What's with that?!" My
answer tried to separate problems with the language with problems in
programs written in the language and turn it into a virtue of PHP: "because
it's so easy to learn, beginning programmers often use it and since they're
beginners, they often write programs that aren't as secure and robust as
what an experienced programmer would do. But if you're a good programmer,
you can write perfectly secure PHP programs."

This is a perfect example of a problem PHP has that can only be fixed with
marketing, not with technology.

 From the "Let's Do Something About It Dept."

I'm almost finished with moding the phpTest engine for phundamentals 
quizzes, and I had a thought ( related to time :).

I would volunteer to *contribute* to a document (html and .pdf) that 
would be available for downloading from the NYPHP site.  The document 
would be geared towards the 'marketing aspect' of getting the word out 
concerning AMP technology and other closely-related areas.  Since I've 
co-authored about eight technical books ( "semimar" and the use of 
"site" for "cite" notwithstanding :), I'd be happy to give it a go.
Ideally, it would be less than 30 pages and pithy.

Some suggested sections:

- Executive Summary
- Company software assets and the GPL
- Links (Appendix) to Open Source studies (David Wheeler's, others)
- Overview of AMP technology (pictures, bulleted items)
- Where the pieces fit and what they can do
- Where the pieces are not a good fit and why
- Q & A (for ease of addressing important issues without the verbiage)
- The compulsory "Interesting Statistics" section (who, where, how much)
- ...


It would be an NYPHP branded document (written using OpenOffice.org and 
exported to .pdf??), with additions as appropriate.

what do ya'll think?

I have a function library that comes with me to each new project I start.
Stuff like a MySQL class, HTML class, email address validation,
authentication tools...that sort of stuff.

I have a master function file that includes all of the other files.

In my new site's .htaccess file (both on my Windows local development
machine and the RHES production server at Rackspace) I set auto_prepend,
like this:

php_value auto_prepend_file path/to/my/functions/library/masterfile.php

That way, I don't have to bother with making sure the path to my functions
files are set in subdirectories or execute logic like:
If this is my local workstation
	include from this path
If this is the production server
	include from that path

I just wanted to share this because I remember when I discovered it, it made
me really, really happy.

Thanks, Glad to be with you all,

A nice idea.  But people need to keep in mind, for this and in general,
not all servers will allow you to set PHP stuff in .htaccess files.

Yeah, I guess that would be a problem...
But this is a good discussion as it prompts PHP folks to think more about
what to consider when selecting a host.

Of course a lot of times we inherit stuff to work on that places the hosting
environment outside of our control.

Anyway, if that helps anyone...

I very much like this idea, too.  Debunking the myths that surround PHP is vital.

Simply put, marketing.  When involved with Open Source, it's easy to forget "everyone else."  That is to say, it's a big world, and frankly most people don't *know* computer technology except for what is delivered to them in semi-technical trade magazines, tv, and those ads on the top of taxis. [1]

Sun and Microsoft have more marketing muscle than all of Open Source; even Linux.  It's not until IBM got on board, and floated $1 billion, that Linux was even known outside tech-heavy sectors.  And it still has a long way to go.  While it's beginning to become a buzzword (which has it's own pros-and-cons) and pushed heavily on TV, the old boys of technology don't move that fast; even in an industry that moves faster than any other.  Ironic.

[1]  I bring up taxi ads because I still remember the day I saw a Penguin on a cab's roof and was dumbfounded.

PLEASE NOTE:
   This event is at the World Financial Center Winter Garden, meeting up
   at the corner of Park Place and Broadway. NOT at IBM. 

WHAT ?
  An introduction to RPMs.  Specifically discussion will focus around
  learning how to *create* RPMs.  We are all aware of the power the RPM
  packaging system has.  Surprisingly, tapping the power of RPM is quite
  *easy*.  This, in turn allows for endless possibilities.  By creating
  your own RPMs, you may customize software to your desire, provide
  updates that your distribution has yet to provide (new Gaim all the
  time! no waiting!), and have the ability to support your distribution
  to the end of time (Red Hat Linux will ever die!).

WHO ?
  Sunny Dubey will be the speaker.  If you wish to speak as well, simply
  email him! (See below)

CONTACT ?
  Sunny Dubey:  sdubey at nylug dot org

WHEN ?
  6:15 PM
  Friday the 14th, Nov 2003
  (Sorry for the late announcement!!)

WHERE ?
  The "Winter Garden" in the World Financial Center of lower Manhattan
  (Insanely *lovely* area).

  However we are meeting on the corner of Broadway and Park Place before
  going there.  (MAPS: http://nylug.opencurve.org/location.html )

  There is a Duane Reade on the corner, you can't miss it !  Just look
  for a guy with a leather jacket, and holding a newspaper in his hands.
  (haha!)

DIRECTIONS ?
  Trains:  A, C, N, R, 2, 3, 4, 5
  Buses:  M1, M6, M15, M22, M103, B51, X25

  A & C trains:
    Take the train to Chambers street.  Once you exit, you will 
    need to walk one block East towards Broadway.  Once you hit
    Broadway, simply walk 1 or 2 blocks south.

  N & R trains:
    Take the train to City Hall.  Once you exit, you will simply 
    need to 1 block south.

  2 & 3 trains:
    Take the train to Park Place.  Once you exit, you need to walk
    1 or 2 blocks towards Broadway.

  4 & 5 trains:
    Take the train to Brooklyn Bridge City Hall.  You will need to
    walk East along the park.  Once you hit Broadway just walk 4 blocks
    down to Park Place.

  M1 & M6 Buses (UPTOWN DIRECTION):
    Try to get off as near as possible to Park Place. and simply walk
    one block east to Broadway.

  M1 & M6 Buses (DOWNTOWN DIRECTION):
    Try to get of as near as possible to Park Place. Nothing more
    needed!

  M15, M22, M103, B51, X25 (All directions):
    Get off at Park Row, and simply walk west till you hit Broadway, and
    1 block north to Park Place.

Hi Michael,

I'll prime the pump by starting on the Executive Summary section next 
week.  The document needs to be concise and minimally technical (a 
handful of pages to begin with is ok).  The process should help to get 
the contributors in marketing-mode.  There's some very heavy techies on 
NYPHP (not to mean horizontally challenged :) and I'm always learning 
from them.  Here's an opportunity for those folks to sharpen their 
marketing skills -- and to remind the contributors to back off the 
technical.

First question should be: "Who's the audience?"

I think taking it offline after this would minimize noise on the lists.
Do you want it in HTML first?  I figured you'd be in the better position 
to drop it where belongs for others to comment.

Since I'm throwing the first pitch, I'll take the "you're off-base" hits 
  from people.  It's all about process.

John

Subject: [nycphp-talk] apocryphal safe mode bug and SANS' alert CAN-2003-0863
Message-ID: <000b01c3aba3$bd889650$bf8d3818@oberon1>

I was searching the SANS Institute's website looking for reported
(purported) PHP bugs.

When up popped s blurb about CAN-2003-0863. I knew that CANs are only
candidates for becoming a CVE (common vulnerability and exposure) but the
following made me want to look into it further.

"CAN-2003-0863" "The php_check_safe_mode_include_dir function in
fopen_wrappers.c of PHP 4.3.x returns a success value (0) when the
safe_mode_include_dir variable is not specified in configuration, which
differs from the previous failure value and may allow remote attackers to
exploit file include vulnerabilities in PHP applications."

clicking on the link
(http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0863)

took me to a page which gave the origin of the 'bug' report as coming from
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=105839111204227 

And clicking on that link provided an email written by 
Michal Krause and dated 2003-07-16 7:46:43 
subject line:  "PHP safe mode broken".

In the body of the email Krause states:
"This behaviour could make older working setups insecure after upgrading
to PHP 4.3.x.

I tried to report this bug to PHP developers twice in last weeks, but I
didn't receive any answer."

I can remember thinking this looks bleak for me (as I had 
already upgraded from 4.2.2) and how could I mend my "broken safe mode".

I thought to myself surely something as important as this will show up if
I search http://lists.php.net -- but I couldn't find any mention of it.

Then I thought maybe there was a response to his post. So, I went back to
bugtraq link above. There was indeed a response from Krause himself
stating:

"To test it[his patch], create simple PHP script owned by some regular
user, which will try to include /etc/passwd for example.

<?
echo("trying to read /etc/passwd");
include("/etc/passwd");
?>  

This script should fail on safe mode error (when safe mode is enabled, of
course). "

I couldn't believe my eyes -- this guy had it 180 degrees backwards -- or
did he? I searched Google again and found more about "CAN-2003-0863". I
think I got something different than what comes up now -- namely
http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/12714 But that web page looks pretty
authoritative (after all ISS is the home of "X-Force Research"-- with a
name like that how could it be wrong?)

The ISS web page states:

"Platforms Affected: 
Linux Any version
PHP 4.3 to 4.3.2
Unix Any version
Windows Any version


Remedy: 


No remedy available as of July 2003.


Consequences: 
Bypass Security "

I'll just stop here -- I  have already gone on too long.

Anyway its no wonder people think PHP has security problems.

(also I apologize for going on and on -- but this gets me upset)

I might be misunderstanding, but someone thinks it is a bug in PHP if,
when you don't enable safe_mode, that safe_mode is not enabled for you?

I read your entire email, and I saw nothing that could be classified as a
bug or a security vulnerability. If I omit safe_mode from my php.ini, why
should PHP assume I meant to enable it?

Please correct me if I misinterpreted anything.

OK, I read this email. I think I misunderstood before.

This guy seems to be claiming that having safe_mode enabled but ommitting
safe_mode_include_dir in your configuration basically disables the check
when you go to include something.

He also cites some code in fopen_wrappers.c.

Well, it seems to me that he is just wrong. From the code:

PHPAPI int php_check_safe_mode_include_dir(char *path TSRMLS_DC)
{
     if (PG(safe_mode)) {
          if (PG(safe_mode_include_dir) && *PG(safe_mode_include_dir)) {
               [snip]
          }
          return -1;
     }
     return 0;
}

The part I snipped out is where the checks are made, and that part is
irrelevant for this argument. As you can see, the default return (since
any previous return would end the function) for the case where safe_mode
is enabled is -1. This is a safe approach. Unless safe_mode_include_dir is
specified and the permissions checks succeed, permission is not granted.

The default return for when safe_mode is not enabled is 0, which makes
sense.

This guy's argument is that the code returns 0 when safe_mode_include_dir
is not set, which is untrue. Doing a cvs annotate on this code shows this
for that particular line:

1.141     (jflemer  01-Feb-02):     return -1;

So, that line has not changed since Feb 2002. His email is from Jul 2003.
This leads me to believe that his argument is completely invalid, even at
the time that he wrote that email.

Firstly, thanks very much Chris for taking the time to read
and respond to my earlier post.

Your response is pretty compelling evidence that there is and was no bug
(and your response is much more concise and concrete than the argument I
had in mind)

The guy was clearly wrong but still SANS picked it up and published it as
a 
possible problem.

And the ISS page makes it look like there is a gaping security hole in
PHP.

Maybe NYPHP should have a section debunking some of the myths which get
propagated
about PHP.

Looks like the same may happen for Mozilla in the coming months.  Here are
a couple of snippets.   : )


"IBM has led the industry in promoting compliance to open standards and
interoperability. It is critical that IBM adhere to Java and W3C Web

IBM CIO office is planning to adopt Mozilla as the default/standard browser

"The IBM Browser Development Center is dedicated to helping IBM developers
support Mozilla within their application frameworks. It also assists people
in working with the Mozilla community, and enhance the browser as
necessary.

"It's important that IBM products are designed to work with a
cross-platform browser like Mozilla," says Walter Lee, manager of the
Browser Development Center. "IBM is investing billions in Linux development
and Mozilla is an especially great browser match for Linux."

The team has helped provide Mozilla compatibility for several products. The

teams. "We're able to help make middleware work with Linux and Mozilla
browsers," says Mike Kaply, Mozilla advocate, Browser Development Center. "

To some, these might be old news, but I thought it interesting enough
to post.  Interesting, too, is the release of MaxDB and PostgreSQL
within hours of each other :)



-----------------------------------------------------
http://www.postgresql.org/presskit/en/presskit74.html

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) is pleased to announce
the availability of version 7.4 of the PostgreSQL Object Relational
Database Management System (ORDBMS). This major release is the work
of our world wide network of hundreds of developers and contributors
over the last 9 months. It provides commercial-grade enterprise database
functionality and performance with the flexibility and low total cost
of ownership widely associated with Open Source software.

"If you tried PostgreSQL before, and went with a commercial database
like Oracle or DB2 instead, it's time to re-evaluate," says Rod Taylor of
Inquent Technologies. "PostgreSQL's expanding enterprise feature set and
performance improvements over the last two years make PostgreSQL competitive
with even the highest-end database systems.  And you can't beat the cost."

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Failure to write session data
Message-ID: <001a01c3ae42$22f741d0$6401a8c0@EZDSDELL>

My client's website is running PHP v. 4.1.2. The website's error handler
sent me the following:

"ERROR NUMBER: 2
ERR DETAILS: Failed to write session data (files). Please verify that
the current setting of session.save_path is correct (/tmp)"

The interesting thing here is the specific error (failure to write
session data) even though session.save_path is already set in the
php.ini to "/tmp."

A bit of Googling turned up the following: creating a tmp folder in
SERVER ROOT like /var/www/tmp and setting permissions accordingly. 

I'm not sure if the following is relevant to the above problem but since
it is "session" related, it may be of some importance here. When going
from one page to another, I pass the session ID by appending it to the
URL, e.g., header("Location:
http://{$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']}/mynextpage.php?code=" . session_id());

And then, on that next page, I grab the ID using session_id
($_GET['code']);

The path in the error message reflects the path in the ini file.  It 
sounds like you're saying that you're expecting it to be the other way 
around: that you need to set the ini file to "/tmp" just because the error 
message says so.

The question is _why_ /tmp wasn't accessible.  Was it working okay until 
all of a sudden you got this error message?  Or did this message come up 
as you're trying to initially configure things.  I'm assuming it was a 
sudden error...

So, is /tmp on the same computer and/or hard drive as the web server?  If
/tmp is being served from another computer, then it could have been a 
transient network failure.

To avoid such, change the path to something that's on the same machine as 
the web server.

Dan,

Just to clarify things a bit. It was working fine all along. Nothing was 
changed either in the INI file or the location of the tmp directory 
(which is on the same physical drive as the site itself).

Plenty of disk space left?  And make sure the permissions on /tmp are correct.  They should be owner, group, world writeable, with the sticky bit set (it'll appear as a 't' on the perms line).

I think these types of inflammatory security alerts, and then them being blindly accepted by ISS and the like, is a real problem.  As we've discussed in regards to prior SecurityFocus alerts, and as Chris I think rightly points out in this case, no one reviews these "alerts" - and frankly it's a little scary what other false positives there are, not only in PHP.

I think it would be of great benefit to PHP's growth to have some followup to security alerts than come out for PHP.    Even something as simple as "yes, it's valid" or "no, we can't find any backing to that claim" would be of great value, and might get these "expert security teams" to wake up.

Plenty of disk space and all permissions are set correctly.
Let me also add that this seems to be an intermittent problem and not 
one that is tied to, say, a browser version issue. It can happen if 
someone is using a very old browser version or a new one but it is *not* 
easily reproducible in either case.

One of the Googled solutions mentioned setting up a new tmp directory. 
However, my guess is that the directory would not accomplish anything (I 
would think) since all permissions are already set correctly on the 
server and there is a lot of disk space.

Someone did write (again, this comes from my Googling) that this seems 
to happen "under load" though the writer was not particularly helpful in 
defining "under load." It should be noted, however, that the server has 
DEFINITELY experienced an increase in hits since the average number of 
transactions through the site has nearly doubled in the past two days 
from approximately 500 per day to a bit over 900 per day. So...that 
translates to 900 or so session files per day with the bulk of them 
happening between the hours of 6am and 10pm. Just seems like a lot of 
session files in a short period of time.

I think 26 gig of disk space is probably enough. No? ;)

Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda2              33G  5.0G   26G  16% /
/dev/sda1              23M  5.9M   15M  28% /boot
none                  503M     0  503M   0% /dev/shm  (<== Vat's dis?)

And here are the permissions (everything looks kosher...even the sticky 
bit):
drwxrwxrwt    3 root     root        12288 Nov 18 23:32 tmp

What's the general number of files in /tmp ?  Are we talking thousands?  Might be time to increase the garbage collector frequency; or, upgrade PHP as we had talked about :)

I noticed in the manual under
session_write_close()
it says: "Session data is usually stored after your script terminated
without the need to call session_write_close(), but as session data is
locked to prevent concurrent writes only one script may operate on a
session at any time".

If it is safe to assume that your are not using framesets -- i.e. the
above does not apply,
I would consider other errors that might occur -- i.e. it might be that
the version of PHP you are running is mis-reporting the error as a file
write error ( this thought has probably more than likely occurred to you
but I throw it out just in case).

Sorry I can't be of any more 'real' help.

Mark,

Are you having an issue with Dezign?  We use it, and so far it has been OK.
We also use ErWin, but I don't think qualifies as reasonably priced.

I would say it is, we bought it and some of the other associated plugins as
well, and we haven't had any issues.  We use it fairly often - a few times a
week.  Large ERDs without problem.

I would say it is stable - but if anyone has any alternatives, I'll gladly
listen.

I use http://www.thekompany.com/products/dataarchitect/ I would consider it
barely stable and some real bugs still exist in it. I am lucky in that the
biggest database I have to keep tabs on is only like 40 small tables and we
don't use it to keep track of much more then the basic structure. It
reversed several mysql databases with no real problem. But the program
crashes every now and then on save and it can be a real kludge to work with.
For the $40 it cost it was a good deal I guess. In short I wish I had ErWin
again it always seemed to do exactly what I wanted not that I wanted much
from it.

You might try looking at this
http://www.fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/doc/index.html

I don't have much experience with it (just toyed around with
a few tables)

But it looks pretty good.
(If you find any serious flaws in it I would be interested in
hearing about them)

Afternoon all.

Can anyone suggest a GNU license solution for an action items list.
It could be a PostNule or PHPNuke module ... but I need to build a
portal site and the one requirement is that it handle Action Items:
Listed them, who is responsible, and the current status (Open, closed,
re-opened, etc.).

Can anyone help me find a basic solution that is open source? I want to
use PostNuke or PHPNuke ....

Message-ID: <E1AMjxH-0000Y1-2g@server1057.webserver33.com>

Anyone here ever create a cross-domain login system?  I'm still waiting for
details to see if the domains will have access to the same db or same
server.  I figure one way to do it would be to somehow transfer session info
form one domain to the other, but it seems like there's plenty of security
issues in doing so.  I thought maybe passing an md5 encrypted string with
the username, password form one site to the next might work as well, but I'm
still not too sure of the security issues, especially considering the issues
pointed out a couple weeks back regarding auto-logins.
 
Anyone have experience with this?
 
Thanks!

In addition to passing some type of key (for instance an md5), you can fingerprint the browser.  If a shared DB is available, you could store the browser's request header and then compare it to what the browser requests on the second server (domain).  This adds a bit of security.

I once had to do a cross-site login thing between a cold fusion server and a PHP server.  They didn't share a DB, and I had very little control over the CF site.  What I finally did was implement a call-ahead to the php site.

1)  User logs into CF and is directed to a protected page.
2)  Within this protected page is a <cfhttp> tag that makes a request to a private URL on the php server.
3)  The php server records the unique key, and could store other info, like a browser fingerprint.
4)  When the user clicks a link with the unique key to get to the PHP server, the PHP box is already aware that this person is coming.

While I'm still passing a unique key via a get, the call-ahead provides some added security, especially when the systems don't share a DB.

Not sure, but I think this might be a good job for cURL login script.  I've
got one kicking around if you need it.  Let me know and I can rummage
through my sock drawer and find it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Cross domain Logins


Anyone here ever create a cross-domain login system?  I'm still waiting for
details to see if the domains will have access to the same db or same
server.  I figure one way to do it would be to somehow transfer session info
form one domain to the other, but it seems like there's plenty of security
issues in doing so.  I thought maybe passing an md5 encrypted string with
the username, password form one site to the next might work as well, but I'm
still not too sure of the security issues, especially considering the issues
pointed out a couple weeks back regarding auto-logins.
 
Anyone have experience with this?
 
Thanks!

Message-ID: <E1AMq5a-0006te-UP@rslrs1-server.com>

The way to do this is to use what is called a "pixel beacon" or "web
beacon."

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html
(Of course, PHP won't let you make a GIF, but it's a reasonable
description).

Use PHP to create an image which is called from the "other domain."
When calling that image, pass along login information in the query
string (in some decryptable format).
As part of the image creation, you can set a cookie or session.

Basically, what you'll have is...

Site1.com makes a call to an image on Site2.com as
http://www.site2.com/beacon.php?action=login&username=foo
(ok, not encrypted or anything)

beacon.php generates an image and sets a cookie:
(Sample code, YMMV)


SetCookie("username",$_GET['username']);
Header ("Content-type: image/jpeg");
$im = ImageCreate (1, 1)
    or die ("Cannot Initialize new GD image stream");
$background_color = ImageColorAllocate ($im, 255, 255, 255);
$text_color = ImageColorAllocate ($im, 233, 14, 91);
ImageString ($im, 1, 5, 5,  $_GET['username'], $text_color);
ImageJPEG ($im);
ImageDestroy($im);


There, by visiting one domain, you've now set a cookie on the other domain.
The only catch is that it requires a little bit of cooperation between
the webmasters (if they won't put your image/beacon on their page, all
is lost).


This technique is regularly used in banner ads and Yahoo! even includes
it in their privacy statements.
http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/pixels/details.html


I haven't done it yet, but I've been tempted to put ALL of my session
and cookie functions into images, even when not going cross-domain.

my understanding is to continue to use 1.3.x since there are 3rd party 
modules and libraries out there that are not thread-safe

Is there something specific about Apache 2 that you need?  If not, stick with Apache 1.

Very little, if any, progress has been made on this front.  It's not PHP/Apache 2.0/ per se, but rather the libs that PHP uses.  For instance, let's say you compile PHP with GD support - is GD thread safe?  Then you compile GD with libjpeg - is libjpeg thread safe?  The number of combinations of libs that PHP can be used with is huge, and thus ensuring each is thread safe is very hard.  That said, the PHPZend/Apache 2.0/ interaction, at the SAPI and engine levels, could be improved, but there is little motivation because of the library issues.  It's a chicken-before-the-egg problem.

You could use Apache 2 with the prefork MPM.  However, that's basically the same as Apache 1, but using a not-so-well-tested SAPI - so why switch?  :)

Don't know the nukes myself, but there are some project management types of applications - dotProject comes to mind, IIRC.

Seems that some might use the thread-safety issue to knock PHP with FUD. 
  Perhaps we need to nip that one in the bud by saying a few [mininally 
techy] words about the effectiveness of running in Apache 2 prefork mode 
in the AMP marketing doc?  I'll at least put in some info and then 
others can improve. Anyone have any stories on this?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Hello / Geo coords
Message-ID: <00c001c3afa0$60c5f4c0$6501a8c0@spot>

Hey everyone,

Just thought I would introduce myself as new member to the list and pose a question at the same time.

My name is Spot(yes, legally). I am with deviantART.com. We are the largest art community in the world with a little under 500,000 artists, almost 3 million pieces of art and close to 80 million hits a month. We move about 55mbit/s average. Running on 37 boxes (last I checked) and two 9 terabyte fibre enclosures. All on Apache/PHP/Mysql. Except for Zues talking to the fibre enclosures for raw data (images). All of our code is from the ground up. No external libraries.

Currently we are employing somewhat of a locational system where we allow artists to provide their Geo coords (after getting them from Maporama.com) and then, currently using GeoURL.org, we pull in RSS feeds and allow them to see lists of artists close to them.

We are interested in bringing as much of this "in-house" as possible. Especially the GeoURL functionality. Does anyone have any information on methods for creating "crow flies" distances between artists based on geo coords? I would be interested in using a third party library if there is one.


Thanks!

That's quite a setup.  While some other major PHP sites might get more hits, I'd bet deviantART is heavier (because your primary dealings are with images).  Are you guys hosted out of LA?

Dealing with lat/long is fairly straightforward... just a series of mathematical equations and you can generate distances.  I used to deal with these equations alot back in the GPS days, but of course they escape me now.  Maybe this is handy:

noteably:

and I think the formula actually is at the top of:

http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~cvm/latlon_formula.html


Newer versions of MySQL also support GIS types of operations, and postgresql might already.  Also, there are loads of zipcode calculation libs out there, which work on basically the same principal... actually, just using zipcodes might be easier  :)

Who's the 'some' -- java fanatics?

You might find this interesting:

"Despite a strong commitment among enterprises that are developing
applications around Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, those
organizations are only averaging about 88 percent availability for
existing Java-based production applications..."

"With an average availability of 88 percent, that is "the equivalent of
having an application down one day a week..."

"When it comes to meeting performance expectations, respondents also
reported that on average they achieved their target performance only 80
percent of the time. Some 65 percent of the respondents reported achieving
their target performance 90 percent of the time..."

I used to run a production system with Apache 2, PHP 4 and MySQL/Oracle under RH 7.3 and used the threaded MPM.  It ran, for the most part, 100%, until it was decided we needed it to do other fancy things.  Initially, only the MySQL and OCI8 extensions were compiled in, which is why it had worked.  When we began to add other stuff (somehow mhash sticks out?) a lot of strange things happened.  So, we went to Apache 1 and haven't looked back since :)

Touching on this subject for the marketing document is a great idea, but something we'd have to treat with care.  Anything surrouding the topic of thread safety gets extremly technical, extremly quickly.  Suffice it to say, possibly, that "bigger version numbers aren't always better."  I think the CTO types, in dealing with Windows NT, 2000 and 2003, could understand that :)

Rasmus had began a list for this, but the URL escapes me at the moment.  It might be on his site (lerdorf.ca) but a bit of googling I'm sure would locate it (I did look, but no luck :(

Hans, I'm beginning to have trouble reading the nested "wrotes" can we 
start using braces?  :)

yeah, I agree with caution on keeping it as non-techy as we can, after 
all, there's enough tech stuff available out there to confuse them further

To backtrack a bit...

A lot of the replies to this last PHundamentals thread was in regards to the act of setting the ini settings.  Going back over my mailbox and seeing the wording we chose, "How should they be set..." I can see the confusion.

That was next month's topic :)  This month was to be a seeding of what ini settings are important to keep in mind, and what values they should have.  So, here's my 2 cents, albeit a dollar short and a day late:

In simple terms, compare the recommended php.ini and the standard php.ini that come with every PHP distribution.

http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/php-src/php.ini-dist?login=2
http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/php-src/php.ini-recommended?login=2

Those that have a stricter setting in the recommended version should be kept in mind :)

When I set up a new environment, production or development, I generally just drop php.ini-recommended into place (named as php.ini of course) and things are happy.  The directives noted at the top of the recommended php.ini are most crucial, with these additional notes:

register_globals:  NO!  OFF!!

display_errors:    On if it's a very big site and you're in development mode.

log_errors:        Always on, production or dev

output_buffering:  This is one of the few directives I will sometimes tweak, even when using the php.ini-recommended.  While buffering can be great, it can sometimes cause a lot of confusing and subtle bugs.  I'll typically turn this off, especially during development.

magic_quote_gpc:   This is up there with register_globals, IMO.  Having stuff do a lot of automatic stuff for you generally isn't good.  Keep this off, always.

error_reporting:   This is a big one; E_ALL is good.  With log_errors and display_errors on, in development, you can watch your site work perfectly, without even a warning.  Then when it goes it to production, flip display_errors off and you're golden.  Coding to E_ALL error standards can also help trace bugs, or even catch intrusion.  If a lot of warning about undefined variables come up, either there's a bug in the call to that script, or someone is where they aren't supposed to be.


There are some others, not even considering the safe_mode, session, and more specialized ini settings.


max_execution_time:  I personally think 30 is too high on trafficed sites.  If you know you're not doing any heavy calculations, bring this down and save a Denial of Service attack.

max_input_time:  Same here.  DoS friendly.

include_path:       can often be a critical setting, of course


Viva php.ini-recommended!

I am moving a site from one server to another one (the new one is in nyc

working perfectly, but identical code on the new one isn't.  Phpinfo tells 
me that sendmail is there and presumably working.  Docs say that mail() 
returns TRUE or FALSE so I tried this code:
----------------
if (mail($to,$subject,$message,$from)==FALSE) do something
else do something else

which always does something else so mail seems to be returning TRUE but the 
message never arrives.  How do I do a better job of debugging what's happening?

This one slipped past my previous post.  I agree that always using long opening tags are the way to go, but turning this to off prevents sexiness like this:

<li><?=$somevar?></li>

One of the conundrums of php I guess :)

what reason other than portability ease (moving from server1 with
short_open_tags=on => server2 with short_open_tags=off) is there for
having short_open_tags=on??

I mean, why sacrifice the "sexiness" of <?=$var?> ?
We're programmers, we need all the help we can get! ;)

You might have also missed Chris Shiflett's response re: the defaulted 
off statement.  (I had to check the correct spelling of his last name on 
his book I bought with my hard-earned money I had set aside for my cat's 
birthday present :)

anyhoo, Chris [rightly] took me to task about it and said that they 
vetoed that idea in more rarified circles.  This list is good practice 
for forcing me to think about making statements like that.

normally when working with mail on a local basis or @ least up to the
gateway its very convienent to do protocol analysis yourself using ethereal
or ngrep.

Where does phpinfo() tell you your sendmail path + setting is on both boxes?
i accidentally copied a php.ini over to a box once w/ bad settings.

Do you have shell access?  If so, ssh in and do something like:

mail your at email.com

fill in the subject and enter a period on it's own line to finish up the body of the message.  If you get the email, then the mail subsystem is probably fairly sane.  If not, it's not sane, and you need to tinker with sysadmin stuff to get it working.

You can also view the system mail logs.  Depending on the platform, it's probably /var/log/maillog

Depending on the success of the step above, do:

tail -f /var/log/maillog

while trying the webpage or using the mail command from a terminal.  If the mail command works, but the webpage doesn't, ensure that your permissions are set correctly.  The settings php.ini has for mail (noteably the sendmail command) needs to be readable and executeable by the user apache is running as, or as the user if it's cgi.

WOW, 3 incredible suggestions!!!

Brian, Mark and Hans, Thank you all so much for your methods.  I'm going to
get my morning thing moving (yes it is 744 pm) and read over these again
over some coffee to figure out where to go with this.

I've gotten the reply from my client and it turns out these will be on the
same server and if I wish, we can use the same database for the two sites.
This is great news, and I would have probably come up with something fairly
subpar for this, but I'm really going to look into what you guys have given
me for a far superior solution.

I definitely figured grabbing the user agent and remote address info would
prove helpful.  Even if it changes due to aol's proxies, etc, they will just
have to enter the password, and continue - but the majority should be
verified appropriately.

The callahead (kinda like a reservation - good for function / variable names
:) is what I has in mind but I wasn't quite sure how to implement it.

And the image thing.. Magnificent!  Now doesn't this cause security errors
on IE without some kind of specialized privacy policy that explains the
off-domain image?  At least for ie?  Getting the image on both sites is not
an issue by any means - Just wondering if it's absolutely a tried and true
solution.  Definitely an incredible idea.

OK, dunkin donuts, here I come.

Thank you all for your input!!!

Mark

To: NYPHP Talk
Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] Cross domain Logins

The way to do this is to use what is called a "pixel beacon" or "web
beacon."

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html
(Of course, PHP won't let you make a GIF, but it's a reasonable
description).

Use PHP to create an image which is called from the "other domain."
When calling that image, pass along login information in the query string
(in some decryptable format).
As part of the image creation, you can set a cookie or session.

Basically, what you'll have is...

Site1.com makes a call to an image on Site2.com as
http://www.site2.com/beacon.php?action=login&username=foo
(ok, not encrypted or anything)

beacon.php generates an image and sets a cookie:
(Sample code, YMMV)


SetCookie("username",$_GET['username']);
Header ("Content-type: image/jpeg");
$im = ImageCreate (1, 1)
    or die ("Cannot Initialize new GD image stream"); $background_color =
ImageColorAllocate ($im, 255, 255, 255); $text_color = ImageColorAllocate
($im, 233, 14, 91); ImageString ($im, 1, 5, 5,  $_GET['username'],
$text_color); ImageJPEG ($im); ImageDestroy($im);


There, by visiting one domain, you've now set a cookie on the other domain.
The only catch is that it requires a little bit of cooperation between the
webmasters (if they won't put your image/beacon on their page, all is lost).


This technique is regularly used in banner ads and Yahoo! even includes it
in their privacy statements.
http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/pixels/details.html


I haven't done it yet, but I've been tempted to put ALL of my session and
cookie functions into images, even when not going cross-domain.

I had dinner with Rasmus last night and brought this specific topic up. I
can't say that I've ever been entirely clear on it all, especially since
mod_perl 2.0 has plenty of third-party modules and such that aren't thread
safe. But, since he has always been the person warning against Apache 2
the most, I figured he was the best person to talk to. It was also
convenient, because 2 of the 3 core mod_perl developers were there as
well, so I sparked a good conversation and basically sat back and
listened. :-)

Apache 2 is fine in pre-fork mode is what I got out of it. Rasmus just
isn't a big fan of using software until it has been around for a very long
time, but my opinion is that Apache 2 is working well for a lot of very
important sites, including Ticketmaster (those guys had some crazy stories
about server load when a big show goes on sale). But, he did admit that
using the pre-fork MPM eliminated the threading issues as well as pretty
much all of his complaints.

Nat Torkington came to the same conclusion, as mentioned in his journal
(http://use.perl.org/~gnat/journal/15902).

So, I'm going to start telling people that Apache 2 is fine as long as you
use the pre-fork MPM or you're sure that all third-party modules you use
are thread safe.

Ding!  That reminds me, there are some vendors/libraries out there where  
you can obtain tables that map zip codes centroids to lat/long data. 
  
I even have a table of zipcode, state, postoffice, latitude, longitude.  I
don't feel like looking at my notes as to the source, but if you want it,
you can have it.

Enjoy,

I was fortunate to be in a similar situation when I had to use this;
same server leveraging the same database.

Not that I'm aware of. Again, consider banner ads. Do you get warnings
from IE everytime a banner tries to set a cookie? (ok, if you have it
set to prompt you when cookies are being set, with the option to refuse
them, but that is different).

this is why I included the link to yahoo's privacy policy. I'd say it's
pretty tried and true just based on that.

Spot,

Here's some code that I have from a long time ago that calculates the
distance between airports based on longitude and latitude. You can do the
same with Zip codes once you convert a zip code to long/lat.

Best,
Daniel Kushner

$db = new My_DB("SELECT *
      FROM airports AS a
         WHERE id IN ('$origin', '$destination')");

 $db->next_record();
 $a = deg2rad($db->f('latitude'));
 $b = deg2rad($db->f('longitude'));
 $origin_id = $db->f('id');
 $origin_name = $db->f('name');

 $db->next_record();
 $c = deg2rad($db->f('latitude'));
 $d = deg2rad($db->f('longitude'));
 $destination_id = $db->f('id');
 $destination_name = $db->f('name');


 $r=3963.1; //radius of the earth in miles

 //calculate the distance between the two points
 $distance = acos(
      (cos($a) * cos($b) * cos($c) * cos($d)) +
      (cos($a) * sin($b) * cos($c) * sin($d)) +
      (sin($a) * sin($c))
     ) * $r;

 if($origin == $destination) {
  echo "Distance = 0<br>";
 } else {
  echo "Origin: ($origin_id) $origin_name<br>";
  echo "Destination: ($destination_id) $destination_name<br>";
  echo "Distance in miles: ", round($distance,4), "<br>";
  echo "Distance in kilometers: ", round(($distance*1.609),4), "<br>";
 }

  Hey everyone,

  Just thought I would introduce myself as new member to the list and pose a
question at the same time.

  My name is Spot(yes, legally). I am with deviantART.com. We are the
largest art community in the world with a little under 500,000 artists,
almost 3 million pieces of art and close to 80 million hits a month. We move
about 55mbit/s average. Running on 37 boxes (last I checked) and two 9
terabyte fibre enclosures. All on Apache/PHP/Mysql. Except for Zues talking
to the fibre enclosures for raw data (images). All of our code is from the
ground up. No external libraries.

  Currently we are employing somewhat of a locational system where we allow
artists to provide their Geo coords (after getting them from Maporama.com)
and then, currently using GeoURL.org, we pull in RSS feeds and allow them to
see lists of artists close to them.

  We are interested in bringing as much of this "in-house" as possible.
Especially the GeoURL functionality. Does anyone have any information on
methods for creating "crow flies" distances between artists based on geo
coords? I would be interested in using a third party library if there is
one.


  Thanks!

Just thought a brief follow-up may be of some interest.
Well, as a result of my brilliant programming skills, the problem has 
been solved! What did I do? I did nothing! The problem, being 
intermittent, has decided - on its own - to go away. This happened 
despite the still high number of daily transactions. Go figure.

Ah, wonderful. Thank you Daniel.

Unfortunately the zip code solution is not going to work for us (as hoped). About 45% of our traffic is non-US/Canada.

This code will be very helpful.


Thank you again.

Perhaps there's some sort of OS limit on the number of inodes and/or file
handles that can be used?

Hi Michael:

The sendmail path may be wrong.  If you can log in to a shell, you can 
try some commands to find it.  For example, one of the following:

   find /usr/sbin -name sendmail
   find /usr/bin -name sendmail
   find /usr -name sendmail
   locate sendmail

Make sure the path matches what's in the php.ini file.

Enjoy,

Hi Folks:

Sorry to ask this here, but maybe someone knows.  I'm looking to examine 
the current MySQL CVS source.  I've searched high and low on the web and 
newsgroup archives but haven't found it anywhere.  Not even in the MySQL 
documentation.  Is it out there?

Of course, the right place to ask is the MySQL list, but I'm already

I don't think mySQL uses CVS anymore. From this page,
http://www.mysql.com/portal/sites/programming/index.html , they are claiming
to be using BitKeeper.

"BitKeeper is a powerful, distributed source management system which has
been used by the MySQL team to manage the MySQL development since July of
2000. Prior to that, MySQL source code was stored in CVS."

Dan,

Now *that's* an interesting thought! The puzzling thing is the 
intermittent nature of the problem even though the number of 
transactions has been, for the past several days, nearly double its 
usual amount. It hasn't happened again since the first time I posted the 
problem. As soon as it surfaces again, I'll revisit the file handle issue.

However, following your lead, I Googled the following (see below). The 
PDF doc goes into a fair amount of detail on many issues though I'm not 
qualified to comment on its accuracy.

"Your exceeding the default 8192 (if this is Linux) file handle limit.
This is a pretty low limit, raise with
"sysctl -w fs.file-max=32767" as root.  If your on a RH box put
"fs.file-max = 32767" in /etc/sysctl.conf  so it gets redone next time
you boot.

They use bitkeeper.

Morning all...
 
I've recently got a small job from a client who wants to run with oracle
(they already have it).  Unfortunately I can't have access to their server.
And as much as I've always wanted to, I've not yet had the opportunity to
learn oracle.  I use adodb, so i figured i wouldn't run into too many issues
learning the basics (as this is a very basic job - basic updates and selects
only.).
 
So does anyone know where i can get access to oracle somewhere.  I couldn't
seem to find a trial or developer download or anyhting that might suggest i
could use / learn it without purchasing it.
 
Thanks!!

  Subject: [nycphp-talk] Oracle Access?


  Morning all...

  I've recently got a small job from a client who wants to run with oracle
(they already have it).  Unfortunately I can't have access to their server.
And as much as I've always wanted to, I've not yet had the opportunity to
learn oracle.  I use adodb, so i figured i wouldn't run into too many issues
learning the basics (as this is a very basic job - basic updates and selects
only.).

  So does anyone know where i can get access to oracle somewhere.  I
couldn't seem to find a trial or developer download or anyhting that might
suggest i could use / learn it without purchasing it.

  Thanks!!

  Mark

here's a function i've ben using for a couple years now.  I can honestly say
I have no idea whether or not i wrote it as i'd done a LOT of variations of
it at the time.  From what I know it's worked well for around 2 years now
(for my client).  I've only tested with US values, but i imagine it should
work for other values as well.
 
Good luck!!

Spot,
 
Here's some code that I have from a long time ago that calculates the
distance between airports based on longitude and latitude. You can do the
same with Zip codes once you convert a zip code to long/lat.
 
Best,
Daniel Kushner
 
$db = new My_DB("SELECT * 
      FROM airports AS a 
         WHERE id IN ('$origin', '$destination')");
 
 $db->next_record();
 $a = deg2rad($db->f('latitude'));
 $b = deg2rad($db->f('longitude'));
 $origin_id = $db->f('id');
 $origin_name = $db->f('name');
 
 $db->next_record();
 $c = deg2rad($db->f('latitude'));
 $d = deg2rad($db->f('longitude'));
 $destination_id = $db->f('id');
 $destination_name = $db->f('name');
 
 
 $r=3963.1; //radius of the earth in miles
 
 //calculate the distance between the two points
 $distance = acos(
      (cos($a) * cos($b) * cos($c) * cos($d)) + 
      (cos($a) * sin($b) * cos($c) * sin($d)) + 
      (sin($a) * sin($c))
     ) * $r;
     
 if($origin == $destination) {
  echo "Distance = 0<br>"; 
 } else {
  echo "Origin: ($origin_id) $origin_name<br>";
  echo "Destination: ($destination_id) $destination_name<br>";
  echo "Distance in miles: ", round($distance,4), "<br>";
  echo "Distance in kilometers: ", round(($distance*1.609),4), "<br>";

Hey everyone,
 
Just thought I would introduce myself as new member to the list and pose a
question at the same time.

My name is Spot(yes, legally). I am with deviantART.com. We are the largest
art community in the world with a little under 500,000 artists, almost 3
million pieces of art and close to 80 million hits a month. We move about
55mbit/s average. Running on 37 boxes (last I checked) and two 9 terabyte
fibre enclosures. All on Apache/PHP/Mysql. Except for Zues talking to the
fibre enclosures for raw data (images). All of our code is from the ground
up. No external libraries.

Currently we are employing somewhat of a locational system where we allow
artists to provide their Geo coords (after getting them from Maporama.com)
and then, currently using GeoURL.org, we pull in RSS feeds and allow them to
see lists of artists close to them.

We are interested in bringing as much of this "in-house" as possible.
Especially the GeoURL functionality. Does anyone have any information on
methods for creating "crow flies" distances between artists based on geo
coords? I would be interested in using a third party library if there is
one.
 
 
Thanks!

Interesting... but did he, or anyone else, have a compelling reason to use Apache 2 in the pre-fork MPM?  As I understand it, Apache 2's architecture is significantly more complex, incurs more overhead, and as Rasmus pointed out, is not as well tested.  And, when combined with being more complex, this becomes exponentially more important - not to mention PHP's SAPI for Apache 2, is eh, new.  If you could run this by him over dinner tonight, that'd be great  :)

I suppose the only advantage is it forces your code to use the long tags, which are generally easier to read.  Also, I recall there were some issues with the short <? in XML documents, but I could be blowing in the wind.

Yes, sexiness must be preserved.

Hi Anders

You name looks some where nordic / scandinavian so I'm confident that 
you will be able to read the danish page

http://www.eksperten.dk/spm/350755

It's the larges IT-community in Denmark (and the rest of the nordic 
contries)... The thread is about which danish pages are running PHP...

a quick summary
www.tv2.dk <- the second larges TV-station in denmark
www.tvdanmark.dk <- another tv-station
www.nokia.dk <- guess
www.roskildefestival.dk <- the (somewhere) world famous fesival in roskilde
www.boomtown.dk <- the larges internet-cafe in denmark
www.tdc.dk <- the larges ISP / Phone company in denmark
www.buy-hp.dk <- guess
www.tiscali.dk <- another big ISP
www.sdu.dk <- second larges university in denmark

Thanks for all the responses (though many suggestions

the problem was angle brackets in the $from variable ($from="my name

the other one (haven't yet figured out why).  Changing them to entities 
fixed everything--but I think I'll just get rid of them anyway.

In-Reply-To: <3FBE27AB.3060004@nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <LBEDJMJGLEPEKJAJMHBDKELBGLAA.tom@supertom.com>

Hey gang,

The greatly anticipated monthly LIPHP meeting is once again upon us!  Don't
be fooled, 11/24 IS the last Monday of the month.  Get your fix of LIPHP
BEFORE your turkey!

Our meetings are the last Monday of every month, at 8pm in Hauppauge, LI,
NY.

For directions and to join the mailing list (90 members and counting!), go
here:
http://liphp.org

Regarding the meeting topic, we are switching things around bit, to elicit
more participation and attendance, and frankly, to make up for the shortage
of speakers.  In future meetings where we do not have a speaker, the format
will be more of a discussion:

- Problems/Questions/Interesting things regarding PHP and AMP technology
- Found any cool sites using PHP and AMP technology
- show your site - attendants are encouraged to show their work, and
demonstrate functionality/design/etc.
- web related discussions - front end design, cool javascript widgets,
happenings in the "corporate" web world, etc.
- trends in development, and even open source in general

Basically, I have found that many interesting discussions flourish on
related topics after the presentations, so I felt this was a way to bring
this fact out to the community - that all this web/PHP cool stuff is going
on right here on Long Island!

We'll still be doing presentations in the future, but they will most likely
be either less in-depth or not monthly, again due to the lack of speakers.
I personally have some ideas for future presentations, but am not confident
to say that I would have them available before January.  Anyone interested
in doing presentations please contact me directly or send email to the list.

Newbies and Pros are both encouraged to attend, LIPHP has something for
everyone.  If you are just learning, or polishing off the next big ERP
system, we are all very interested in hearing about it.

Thanks to the folks at NYPHP and LILUG, who I have gleened many of these
(and future!) ideas from.

The Krispy Kremes will definitely be here (and we always have leftovers -
come and eat them, already!!).  You should be, too.

See you Monday @ 8pm

Tom

By entities, you're referring to &lt; and &gt; ?

And you mentioned you're going to get rid of them.  So are you only going to
use the email address without the Name?

Wondering as I've run into a couple uunexpected missed emails from a
newsletter system I wrote and I'm not finding errors in the logs, no
bouncebacks or much of anything..

Thanks for all the responses (though many suggestions
assumed--incorrectly--that I have access to the server).  It turns out that
the problem was angle brackets in the $from variable ($from="my name
<email at somewhere.xx>";), which were no problem on one site and a problem on
the other one (haven't yet figured out why).  Changing them to entities
fixed everything--but I think I'll just get rid of them anyway.

1) You want to use mod_perl 2.0. (That's why Ticketmaster uses Apache
   2.0, they're all mod_perl hackers.)

2) You want to use Windows. (Insert disclaimer here.)

3) Your answer here.

Seriously, I most often see #2 posted as a reason why someone's
running Apache 2.0.

Yeah, mod_perl 2.0 seems to have some nice features over mod_perl 1.0,
including increased stability (I know this sounds odd, since it's newer,
but their testing framework is brilliant). So, Ticketmaster probably wants
to take advantage of this, plus Apache 2 has been out for over a year and
a half now, so it's not as risky to use it now as it might have been a
year ago.

> 2) You want to use Windows. (Insert disclaimer here.)

Good God. :-)

> 3) Your answer here.

Apache 2 is considerably faster - at least, that's what a lot of smart
Apache hackers tell me. Some people would probably exchange some
reliability for speed, depending on their needs (and depending on how much
perceived reliability they have to exchange). And, like I said, a lot of
people consider it to be quite stable and reliable now, and the internals
have been redesigned and are supposedly better.

Yahoo uses Apache 1, and Rasmus seems to still prefer this to Apache 2.
For those who want to use Apache 2 and were being held back because of the
perceived problems with it and PHP, I think they can go ahead now.
Basically, don't switch to Apache 2 because of PHP, but don't let PHP stop
you either. That's my take. :-)

I believe this (and all other variations, including an article in
php|architect) comes from piece of code written by Dave Sklar.

http://px.sklar.com/code.html?id=88

As far as I know, he was the first person to come up with the idea of
leveraging the US census ZIP Code data in combination with this
algorithm. Of course, Dave did not invent the "great circle"
algorithm, so the credit only goes so far. :)

It seems odd that there would be no record someplace if they don't go out, 
and if they do go out why would there be any problem further down the 
line?  one more of those baffling and maddening things....

It seems the standards say they should be there:
   name-addr   =  [display-name] angle-addr
   angle-addr  =  [CFWS] "<" addr-spec ">" [CFWS] / obs-angle-addr

>From Section "3.4. Address Specification" of RFC 2822.

Though I didn't feel like taking the time to figure out if
"obs-angle-addr" means that this is depricated, no longer necessary or
what.

It means that you can use the format listed OR "obs-angle-addr" which is an
obsolete addressing format (described, cryptically, here:
<http://esprix.net/~takuya2/rfc2822_keywords.en.html#obs-angle-addr>).
Either way, the lt/gt symbols are part of the standard.  Not that following
standards ever meant you weren't going to break something. :-)

It seems the error has resurfaced (it has only occurred once since my 
last posting). Following Dan's lead, I checked the file handles using 
this command: sysctl fs.file-nr and came up with the following:

fs.file-nr 11145  10529  104856

According to the Linux performance doc that I had referred to in an 
earlier post, it says the following:

"Value #1 ? The number of allocated file handles
Value #2 ? The number of used file handles
Value #3 ? The maximum number of file handles the kernel will allocate
You can raise the file handle limit with sysctl -w fs.file-max=32767
Ideally, the first number should approach the maximum number with the
center number far behind. Raise the limit until this occurs.
A system needs to be up for a reasonable period of time before you should
measure against these values."

*HOWEVER*, if this performance doc is correct, well, the max. number of 
file handles *already* seems quite large. So I have the following question:
	Since the max number (value #3)is already quite large, is there 
something that's preventing Linux from allocating additional file 
handles? (And, just an observation...is it a coincidence that the 
allocated file handles is about 10% of the max. number?)

But, of course, you're looking AFTER the fact.  Though, admittedly, this 
probably isn't your problem.  To check at the moment of the error, put 
some code in your error handler to check the handle situation.  Hmm... 
perhaps even add a debug_backtrace in there and/or other system 
performance examination tools.

Unfortunately the debug_backtrace is a 4.3.0 function and I'm using 4.1.2.

    Hey everyone,

    Just thought I would introduce myself as new member to the list and pose a question at the same time.

    My name is Spot(yes, legally). I am with deviantART.com. We are the largest art community in the world with a little under 500,000 artists, almost 3 million pieces of art and close to 80 million hits a month. We move about 55mbit/s average. Running on 37 boxes (last I checked) and two 9 terabyte fibre enclosures. All on Apache/PHP/Mysql. Except for Zues talking to the fibre enclosures for raw data (images). All of our code is from the ground up. No external libraries.

    Currently we are employing somewhat of a locational system where we allow artists to provide their Geo coords (after getting them from Maporama.com) and then, currently using GeoURL.org, we pull in RSS feeds and allow them to see lists of artists close to them.

    We are interested in bringing as much of this "in-house" as possible. Especially the GeoURL functionality. Does anyone have any information on methods for creating "crow flies" distances between artists based on geo coords? I would be interested in using a third party library if there is one.


    Thanks!

Message-ID: <002801c3b246$2f129e30$6500a8c0@thinkpad>

hi,

ive notice a few applications post a nice neat installation script located
usually under /install directory - mainly for mysql schemas and such + then
a new session tests to see if the dir exists warning the user to remove it
for security purposes.

normally when you pop in the mysql user/pass/db like this its considered
unsecure unless you tunnel or SSL (which ive still not been able to
accomplish w/ MySQL4 + php client classes) ...

@ the moment it seems as if every app has its own way of installation
(README vs. GUI scripts), but is there anything or any method on articles
anywhere discussing this from 3rd party view ... i see more + more apps
applying phplib/smarty so i thought maybe there would be a norm (since there
is no actual .jar like install) ... php --install *.gz would be a nice idea
...

i had been thinking pear install would make more sense but is there a way to
run a php script from within the install (for db setup?)

Hi Folks:

I'm looking forward to being one of the presenters at this month's 
meeting.  I'll be providing highlights from the
http://www.bikesummer.org/2003/ site.

I just implemented some fixes tonight.  So, if you've looked at the site 
at any point using Internet Explorer or Netscape 6 on the Mac OR you 
viewed the photo gallery at some point over this weekend using any 
browser, please stop by again to see how things really look.

FYI: on the Mac IE front...  it took me a while to pin down, but it turns
out table row background colors end up being shown in the cell spacing.  
Thus, background colors are best specified for cells. See a new page I put
together explaining/demonstrating the whole shebang:
http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/iemac.htm

See you,

Tim,

Thanks so much for tracking this down. This *definitely* adds another 
set of questions (or at least, possible solutions) as opposed to 
assuming the issue is simply (or only) a file handle issue.

I must admit I was recently a victim of this during an interview showing off
a project which looked like crap under a mac, back in 2000 (40 years ago) i
had a nice g3 to test and qa stuff on + now im left w/ calling friends
asking how things look :-)  Thank you for pointing this out ...

BTW, is there any online solution to this?  I had been thinking a while back
a nice idea would be a box which could do this type of work, snapshot to the
web for other developers ...

Interesting concept, but not cheap.

Noted they don't have Mozilla only up to 1.1 (let alone none on the mac)
and no Firebird or Camino.

It's actually an incredible service.  You can sign up at their site for an 8
hour trial.  They offer screenshots on so many browsers on each platform,
and even offer to generate a PSD (photoshop file) for download so you can
flip through all of them at once.  (As a warning, I tested a site with every
browser and every platform and that psd came out to about 150 mb).

The guy who runs it seems to be incredibly helpful service wise as well.
I've been wanting to get an account, but I'm waiting til I have enough work
to supplement the monthly price ($40 which isn't much, but it is Christmas
season).  They offer hourly signups as well which does well for me.

Message-ID: <26F69C024813D811BFFD00508B8FA3E319F074@webproxy.uat.dbinsight.com>

I'm sort of cutting my teeth in PHP (i know very minor stuff, but I'm
otherwise a newbie) and I'm trying to come up with a directory lister that,
well, lists all the files in subdirectories from $path and does it in
alphabetical order (well, acutally numerical, since the subdirectories are
all numbers). They're all MP3 files and each folder has files named simply
"01.mp3", "02.mp3", etc.

Here's the code I have. I left in a few commented lines, but don't hold that
against me.

<?php
$path = '/usr/local/apache/cmjnetwork.com/htdocs/sirius/';
//$handle = @opendir($path) or die("Unable to open $path");
$handle = opendir($path);

while ( false !== ($file = readdir($handle)) ) {
	if($file=='.' || $file=='..' || $file=='index.php')
		continue;
	if (preg_match("/\.(esp|mp3)$/", $file)){
		$filetlist[$file] = filemtime ($path.'/'.$file);
	}
}
asort($filetlist); //this is line #35
// reset($filetlist);
while (list ($key, $val) = each($filetlist)) { // this is line 37
	echo '<li>'.$key.' => '.$val.'</li>\n';
}

closedir($handle);
?>

The problem I get is that this error message when I try to view it:
Warning: Wrong datatype in asort() call in
/usr/local/apache/cmjnetwork.com/htdocs/sirius/index.php on line 35

Warning: Variable passed to each() is not an array or object in
/usr/local/apache/cmjnetwork.com/htdocs/sirius/index.php on line 37

Does anyone know why?

Cheers.

Your code works for me. When you had the original opendir() or die()
line, did your code die? If so, it probably means the you don't have
permission to read the directory. (Which does seem weird because I'm
guessing its globally readable, but still.)

Try putting a 'print "$file\n";' line here to make sure you're
actually iterating through the files you think you're iterating through.

> The problem I get is that this error message when I try to view it:

This would happen if no files get placed in the $filetlist. The it's
not an array, but a string (or some other non-initialized value, like
NULL) and asort() will complain.

> Warning: Variable passed to each() is not an array or object in

Likewise with each().

To prevent errors like this, always initialize variables. Placing a
simple:

$filetlist = array();

at the top of your code will prevent these errors even when there are
legitimately no files in your directory.

Actually, this is a lie. Your code lists files, but doesn't do them the
way (I think) you want them to.

You should be using ksort() instead of asort() since you're sorting on
the filename (which should be the array key) not the modified time
(which is the array value).

Also, you don't want to put \n inside single quotes. You should place
it inside double quotes, or it will be a literal \n and not a newline.

Last, check out natsort(), which will sort your numbers how you expect
them to sort. You may need to actually use uksort(), since there's no
knatsort(). Try: uksort($filetlist, 'strnatcmp');

I really appreciate the help. Hooo, boy, am I close now.

Here's the current code. It seems to work, with only two problems:
1) it outputs all the filenames under the FIRST bullet point.
2) likely related to #1. the links do not point to the proper subfolders.

function dirlist($path) {
	$handle = opendir($path);
	$filetlist = array();
	$subflist = array();

	while ( false !== ($file = readdir($handle)) ) {
		if ( ($file!='.') && ($file!='..') && ($file!='index.php') )
{
			$filetlist[] = $file;

			$subpath = $path.$file;
			$subhandle = opendir($subpath);
			while ( false !== ($subfile = readdir($subhandle)) )
{
				if ( ($subfile!='.') && ($subfile!='..') ) {
					$subflist[] = $subfile;
				}
			}

		}
	}

	natsort($filetlist);
	natsort($subflist);

	echo '<ul>';
	while (list ($key, $val) = each($filetlist)) {

Dear Members of NY PHP List!
Unfortunately, the programmer I've enlisted to help me redesign Dean
Rocks.com hasn't been able to work on the site very much. I have a clear
idea of what the site needs in order to really get going. We have over a
thousand people visiting the site every day and there is no LOGIN! Nothing
has changed on the site in the last month, partially due to my own
frustration with not being a web savvy person! The first thing I need help
with is a LOGIN system, the next thing would be some sort of database or
blog to catalogue Dean's endorsements. Please, anyone who really has the
time to do this..HELP ME! This could bring in many, many votes for Dean by
transforming endorsements from a name on a list to a powerful tool to
inspire people. If you would like more info on my vision for this site,
please e-mail me ASAP! Thanks and sorry to bother the list again! Amanda

Your problem is that your code collects all thee subfolder files but
doesn't track their parent folder. So, when you natsort() them
everything gets mix up.

The easiest way to solve this problem is with recursion. When you use
recursion, you call a function from *within* that function. (If you've
never done this before, it can be a bit of a mind twister.) In this
case, your code to print a subfolder is practically identical to the
code to print its parent. Whenever you notice this self-similarity,
it's a good sign you want to use recursion.

Here's a rewritten version that does the same thing that you were
trying to do:

function dirlist($path, $level) {
  if (is_dir($path)) {
    $files = array();
    $handle = opendir($path);

    while ( false !== ($file = readdir($handle)) ) {
      if ( ($file!='.') && ($file!='..') && ($file!='index.php') ) {
        $files[] = $file;
      }
    }

    closedir($handle);
    natsort($files);

    echo "<ul>\n";
    while (list ($key, $val) = each($files)) {
      if ($level) {
        $val = "<a href=\"$path/$val\">$val</a>";
      }
      echo "<li>$val</li>\n";
      dirlist("$path$val", $level + 1);
    }
    echo "</ul>\n";
  }
}

dirlist('/path/to/songs.mp3', 0);

If you look at the code, you see that I iterate through a directory
and gather up all the files. Then I sort them. Last, I print
them, but after I print each item, I call dirlist() again!

If it's not a directory, nothing happens. If it is, then I repeat the
whole process inline.

Since you print <li>s differently if they're in a subfolder instead of
the top level, I needed to use a $level variable to track where you
are and add the <a> tag around $val. Also, I used $path as the prefix,
but this isn't really right. You'll probably want to modify
this. That's left as an exercise for the programmer.

Sorry again. I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to

The code there is similar, but superior to the function I just hacked

Very rudimentary (especially for this skill sets of most people on this

  Subject: [nycphp-dev] intro & content protection question


  Hiya listies,

  I'm cross-posting this to both the dev and talk lists, as I
  am not quite sure in which category this really belongs.

  I'm brand-spanking new to both PHP and mySQL, though
  I've been programming for a number of years (since about
  1985) and am based in C so I think PHP is going to be
  pretty easy to pick up. I've had exposure to SQL through
  Cold Fusion in the late 90s and the mySQL documentation
  makes it look pretty easy/straightforward, but I'm sure I'll
  have some basic questions about both aspects of the
  current design I'm working on once I get to coding. Until
  then, I'm still shaking out the bugs in the architectural 
  planning stage and need some help deciding how to 
  implement my design.

  Here's the deal. I am designing a thing (don't want to
  release too many details until the project is released)
  that best compares to the old SAT reading comprehension
  test with one difference: I don't want people to skip tests
  or skip around the reading/test sets out of order. This is
  not a problem, as I can just validate the user's position
  in the sequence and control their flow through the sets.

  There will be a total of 20 reading/test sequences with at 
  least one or two forms at the start of the process to collect 
  demographics and set up the user prefs. Again, all of this 
  seems pretty straightforward to me and is not my issue yet 
  (not until I start coding ;-))

  Okay, here's my question, I was originally thinking along
  the lines of doing this in Flash to protect the content of
  the reading tests (don't ask why, just accept I wanted to)
  from being lifted. If I dynamically generate the pages, the
  resulting content will be HTML that can just be saved and 
  walked off with by whomever views the pages. 

  The content of the reading tests is of value to me and I don't 
  want to present it in "liftable" text format. In Flash, the text 
  is part of the SWF file and cannot be saved easily (I do realize
  someone with enough motivation could manually retype the 
  content viewed and walk off with it but that's an awful lot of 
  effort to steal something publicly accessible for free, isn't it?) 

  Since I was planning on doing this in Flash, I planned on
  controlling flow through ActionScript to PHP and PHP 
  to mySQL. I also wanted to use the PHP/mySQL combo
  to allow users to stop the reading/test sequence and
  come back to it, as well as to set a variety of env vars
  (like colors, fonts, other fluff). 

  The more I think through the functional flow of this project,
  however, the more silly it seems to be involving Flash at all. 
  The only thing stopping me from keeping it purely PHP at 
  this point is how to protect the content at the point it appears 
  in the client browser. Is there any way to do this? Since PHP 
  parses and then returns HTML to the client, I don't see how 
  to make the page content not accessible via View | Source 
  or by saving the resultant page.  Ideas? Suggestions?

  Oh, one more kink in the works, one of the user prefs may
  be to view the reading sections in a language other than English,
  (i.e., read in a non-English language, take the test in English)
  and again, this is not hard--just have separate source files
  for the content of the reading part and insert whichever one
  based on the user pref). This is a LOT easier to do with PHP
  by just setting the CHAR-SET and displaying HTML than it 
  is to import non-English into Flash. This user pref may have
  to wait for a "rev 2" of this project ;-)

  ADthanxVANCE!

This is the correct list (NYPHP-Talk), although the NYFE (Frontend) list might be helpful too.

I have little experience in this field (that is of frontend stuff) but I do remember taking some tests online (like at Brainbench way back when).  I think they used some type of Javascript to block cutting-pasting, and saving. True, this is easily circumvented, but might be enough for what you need.  Lastly, if you can for people to use IE, there are probably a number of ActiveX and browser plugin types of components that could offer the most protection.

Well there's nothing wrong with using flash strictly for the text display,
and it might be one of your easier / more reliable options.  Just have the
swf on the page call up the correct text (via xml file, getVariable, etc)
accodding to what question they are on, and use the swf as the 'text reader'
with a scroll bar, etc to allow the user to read all the text.   Make sure
the text is not selectable (just a basic attribute on a flash text box).

This allows you to have easy control of the entire app over nice and
comfortable php, and still protect your text with a usable and protective
text reader. 

The reason I say it may be your best option is that no matter WHAT you do,
the user COULD just take a screen shot of your text and keep the image
files.  And if you're generating images, you're giving them something to
save already.  Flash allows for dynamic text loading without much server
side work and a small clientside footprint.  And since the text will be
dynamic, even if they decompile the swf, the text won't be there.  Just make
sure your backend script only sends data to the swf In the testing browser.

Good luck!

You could display the content in a popup window without the menubar and
then use javascript to disable the mouse right-click.

In either case, thanks for the help.

If your in the mood to buy something
and you have an extra $15 lying around you 
could look at http://www.aw-soft.com/htmlguard.html

It has nothing to do with PHP (per se)
but you might be able to work it
