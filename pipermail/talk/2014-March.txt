Have you seen this?

http://developers.slashdot.org/story/14/03/04/2310240/the-new-php

Looks like a lot of people over there think PHP is beneath them.

yup, finally most developers are moving away from monolithic framework into
more component based projects, a few months ago Rasmus in a conference said
that framework sucks, since then lot of people on Twitter are following
this trend:
http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/226-4-Reasons-Why-All-PHP-Frameworks-Suck.html

Why this is a good news? Well the next time you change company you won't
have to learn a "new" framework (usually the framework is old when you join
into the company). Sure this won't stop legacy code and quantum
entanglements into the code, but at least will limit the damage developers
can do inside the vendor folder of composer.

All frameworks suck... except for the one you use.

"The new PHP is about interoperable components using their comparative
advantage to provide the best combination of ingredients for your project."

And once upon a time, there was this thing called PEAR...

My experience is that even the one you use sucks. It may just suck less then 
others for your project.

Huh? I have no idea what this means. From which marketing brochure for C level 
management was that copied?

Pear was great back in the time, in the old days of PHP 3 with pear we had
ORMs, templates engines, debug tools, logging, caching and a lot of more
tools. The problem was if you wanted to include your new component in the
pear repository, that was pretty hard since it was a very closed and
elitist community. The benefit of that was that the components were real
good and very useful.

Composer is great, is like the new pear, you can find almost anything in
packagist, good components and also a lot of shit. That is good because you
can have more components and a bigger community but the sad part is that
most of the components are zipped shit (same problem that node.js users
have with npm).

Anyways, for me openness and variety is a good thing. These new wave based
in interoperable and reusable components between different frameworks is
great, is a good step in the evolution of the PHP ecosystem and his
community (not just the language).

Regards

Hi,

I am looking for help with an AS2 configuration with Amazon Drop Ship
Central.  Has anyone done this?  Has anyone done this with free open source
AS2?  Have been trying to use AS2 Secure which is an open source php AS2
client/server.  Not sure how to troubleshoot.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Nick
