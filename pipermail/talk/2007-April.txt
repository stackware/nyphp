    I've mostly worked with ADODB.  When I last looked,  ADODB was far 
ahead of PEAR:DB, but it looks like PEAR:DB has come a long way.

    I have a few serious complaints with ADODB,  but it sure beats 
having to switch between a few database APIs to do my work.  Things I'd 
like to see in a database API are:

(i) no use of globals to switch between numeric and associative result sets
(ii) lazy initialization of database connections ('create' the 
connection early in your app,  but don't suffer the overhead of using it 
until you need it)
(iii) a subdivision of database exceptions,  so I can write something like

try {
    $db->Execute("INSERT ...");
} catch (DuplicateKeyException $e) {
...
};

The 'spring' framework in Java does something like this.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] DB-based sessions and destructing objects problem
Message-ID: <20070402142706.M83063@pinestream.com>

I am implementing a MySQL-based session handler and am confused by the dialog
in the PHP manual regarding this issue:

"Write and Close handlers are called after destructing objects since PHP
5.0.5. Thus destructors can use sessions but session handler can't use
objects. In prior versions, they were called in the opposite order. It is
possible to call session_write_close() from the destructor to solve this
chicken and egg problem."

The English please....

First, my app uses PEAR DB. So should I use PEAR DB for access, or use the
mysql or mysqli primitives and open a new connection? It seems like opening a
new connection would be a waste of resources. But using PEAR DB adds overhead
and brings up this object destruction problem.

I've seen register_shutdown_function('session_write_close'); as a way to get
around the destructor issue, but what is the PEAR DB class is destructed
before the session handler?

Thoroughly confused...

Thoughts?

Cliff

Hello Again, 

I've been researching auction software .. and since I really dont want to attempt to write this kind of stuff,
I need to find something that works well out of the box, plus includes the source (since I will be integrating
it into another site).

So far, the most promising software package I've found is: http://www.phpauction.net/index.php

I believe the source code EP version would be best for my auction needs.

Does anyone have experiance w/this company and its products?

Thanks!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] single quote vs. double quote
Message-ID: <4611AAF6.1070306@gmx.net>

Hi!

The old topic is at it again. After some long long time I started again 
with doing some PHP. Task: internationalize my existing project. Goal: 
read strings from a text file. First step: open the file.

I used this:
$langfile = fopen('$langfileloc', 'r');
and constantly had it fail. The path and file name are OK, I 
quadruplechecked.

Now, when I do this:
$langfile = fopen("$langfileloc", "r");
It works like a charm. Which makes me wonder as some long time ago we 
had this nice discussion that ended with sth like "one needs only the 
single quote for everything in PHP".

Do I recall this incorrectly or are the exceptions (bugs?) in PHP?

Well, took me quite some time to figure out that my use of expert advise 
wasn't that great this time around.

Ah, no. The discussion probably went along the lines of "use single
quotes for faster program execution," because, as you learned, PHP
does not need to check for and evaluate variables inside of
single-quoted strings.

But really, all you had to do was not quote at all.
$langfile = fopen( $langfileloc, 'r' );

The difference would come into play if you wanted to, say, add a file
extension to the end of $langfileloc. In that case, fopen(
$langfileloc.'.txt', 'r' ) would be infintissimally faster than fopen(
"$langfileloc.txt", 'r' ), because concatenation is supposed to be
faster than string evaluation. Hans Z. will likely point out that
fopen("{$langfileloc}.txt", 'r') is even faster, because concatenation
is too slow for some folks.

Processor speeds being what they are, the only good reason to use
single quotes is so you don't have to use the shift key while you type
your code.

True, but I still like the ability to quickly look at a string and know
wheather it should contain variables or is static :)

Another good reason is to enclose strings that contain double quotes, 
eliminating the ugly (IMHO) backslash double-quote escape that so 
many people use.

Please remember below rules while writing PHP expressions.

#1 There is practically NO use of "double quotes" in PHP in writing 
expressions EXCEPT expanding sequences like converting "\n" into newline, 
"\t" to tabulator (in regex etc.). Which means you should not use "double 
quotes" at any other place than above.

#2 When your data is static, use 'single quotes' to tell PHP to use it "as it 
is", if dynamic then should not be enclosed by ANY quote.

#3 If you have mixture of static+dynamic then use $dynamic.'I am static' style 
to concat dynamic and static data.

When you use "double quotes" PHP will try to EXPAND everything which is 
enclosed in "double quotes" which means variables will be expanded, static 
string will be looked for constants first and if not found then will be used 
as it is and then finally expression will be prepared.

Hope these will clear your thoughts about '' vs. "" quotes.

Message-ID: <46122771.6030509@secdat.com>

Wondering if anybody can give personal experience with a linux-based 
flexible file viewer.

The file in question is a mixed binary/ascii (yes ascii, not utf-8) 
format from a DOS program.  It appears that financial data and dates are 
encoded as binaries, probably to save space, and that would mean there 
are also pointers in there.  I've got to identify about 4 important 
fields and pull them out.

I've done jobs like this plenty of times, but not since my fox days, and 
fox was pretty good with stuff like this.  I've never had to do it with 
*nix tools.

I'm aware that there are plenty of hex viewers out there, what i'm 
hoping for is that somebody has done something similar or close and can 
recommend a good viewer from personal experience.

That is indeed so! Thank you. I just wonder why the examples in the PHP 
manual on php.net do not show it like that. This is so much easier and, 
gee, more logical.

Yea, that would be if I'd use a US kezboard. I have a german kezboard 
and I need to shift either the 2 for the double quotes or the # for the 
single quote. I wonder how programming languages would look like if 
Germans would have invented them. I mean, all or most of them. Konrad 
Zuse did indeed invent the programming language, called 'Plankalk?l' in 
1943.

I'm not sure if what you are saying includes this, but I use double 
quotes all the time in php for producing html. For example:

[1] echo("$myResult <br/>");
[2] echo('<a href="mydomain.com/mywidget.php" >$myResult</a>');

The use of double quotes in [1] allows me to print something without 
having to use the dot operator.

The use of the single quotes in [2] allows me to use the double 
quotes in html without having to escape them.

Note in both usages, the variable $myResult was used without regard to quotes.

Cheers,

tedd

How you write number [1] comes down to personal preference. I'd 
rather write it as:

echo $myResult . '<br/>';

In number [2], I hope you realize that the string '$myResult' will be 
treated as a static string and will not be evaluated.

Also, since "echo" is a language construct and not a function, the 
parenthesis are not required.

1. Yeah, you're right. In that example I have to put in those escape 
operators to get it to work correctly. But in my defense, I was 
typing code on the fly -- it was the topic and not the syntax I was 
addressing.

echo("<a href=\"mydomain.com/mywidget.php\" >$myResult</a>");

2. Yes, echo is language construct and not a function, but my 
personal preference is to use the parentheses.  It makes it easier 
for me to read and I know if I want to send it more than one 
parameter, then I can't use parentheses. But, my simplistic approach 
to problems usually finds another way.

Cheers,

Not sure if you are looking to just parse/analyze but Ive used these  
scripting options:

xxd -ps file.bin (pipe to grep | pipe to tr | piped to xxd -r)
cut -b 10-13 | xxd -ps

There is also a great rubygem called bindata which is dead simple to  
use, just build your own struct.

    If I wanted to code like that,  I'd be coding in Java.

    I did a long stint of programming in Perl,  which offers you about 
30,000 ways to quote text.

    Here are my rules for PHP.

    (1) Use ?>...some HTML...<?php as much as feasible
    (2) Avoid heredoc -- it's particularly treacherous in PHP
    (3) Use " in most situations.  Use \ to escape ", $ and \.
    (4) Make a habit of writing {$like_this}

    Convention (3) turns out to be an effective convention 
cross-language.  Double quotes work the same way in shell scripts,  perl 
scripts and other places.  It might not be the most elegant syntax, but 
it works well.

Since I'm not sure on your database structure, I'm not really able to 
fill in the blanks there... not to mention you don't have a WHERE clause 
on that query, and you're checking to make sure there's only one row; 
unless your table has only one row in it, it's likely nothing will 
happen.  Also, if you're looking to delete them, why not just replace 
your "SELECT * FROM" to a "DELETE FROM ..."?

It is matter of preference and convenience. As I said when you use double 
quotes to enclose expression, PHP will try to look for "constants" that will 
match part of static string. If constant is not found then will use string as 
it is but if found then will replace that part of string by matching 
constant's value.

In your above example, if there is defined a constant as "href" (though not 
likely to exist) then it's value will be replaced in final output. That is 
why "" should not be used there. Hence proper expression could be written 
like below:

echo '<a href="mydomain.com/mywidget.php">'.$myResult.'</a>';

Now there is no harm of expansion of static data.

Message-ID: <4613AEB8.5040801@gmx.net>

Hi!

Working on my internationalization project I am now ready to load the 
contents of a string file into an array and use the strings. Now, I have 
to ideas when to do this:
a) run this on load of every page with output
b) run it once on the start page and store the array in the session

Does anyone have any experience with doing one or the other (or both)? I 
wonder which way is the faster / more robust.

My guess is that after I'm done the string file will have several 
hundred entries.

Thanks in advance.

Hello,

I worked on a large PHP project, we used to have HUGH arrays (it would 
sometimes timeout the script)
I can't remember..but they were slow...but more often, a particular SQL 
statement
was even slower when we did performance related tuning..it was SQL we always 
had to fix.

What about storing the result in a temp table?

There is no SQL or database table involved. I don't see any good reason 
to keep static stuff like text strings in a database table. Also, since 
I do not know all languages (only two) others will find it much easier 
to translate a flat ASCII file than something that is stuck in a table.
I also don't see a point in loading the strings from file, putting them 
into a temp table, then use SQL to pull that stuff back out, stick it 
into an array, and then use it. Unless accessing a temp table is quicker 
than picking an element out of an array by key, but I doubt that is the 
case.

David,

I recently had to do some work with our companies meeting room booking
system, which was originally based on the open source PHP based MRBS
project that's out there somewhere.

For their internationalization they had used separate include files for
each language, with the correct one being included at runtime based on
the users language.

Each of the language files basically just built the same associative
array but with the correct translations for that language.  The required
language file does get read with every page load, but this seems to take
no time whatsoever.

Hope this helps... it is my first post to this list :)

This is incorrect.  Strings are never evaluated for constants.
Double-quoted strings are evaluated for "$variableExpansion" , which
incurs a slight processing cost 

Unquoted strings are first evaluated as constants, and if not found, an
E_NOTICE is issued, and the unquoted string is treated as a string
literal (as if it were surrounded by single quotes) 

kenneth at gilgamesh:/tmp$ php -r 'define("XYZ", "hi there"); echo "XYZ\n"; echo XYZ . "\n";'
XYZ
hi there

except for that detail, I agree with Anirudh's advice to not use "" except 
for the few places you need it ("\n", etc)

    There's a short form and long form of substitution in PHP.  The 
short form is

$x="$y an example of the short form";

and

$x="{$y} is an example of the short form";

    You can get in trouble with the short form because it's greedy.  
Imagine you're trying to make the name of a logfile

$logfile_name="$year_$month_$day_logfile.txt";

    PHP evaluates "$" expressions in a greedy manner,  so it will look 
up the variables

$year_
$month_
$day_logfile

rather than

$year
$month
$day

that you probably want.

$logfile_name="{$year}_{$month}_{$day}_logfile.txt";

gets the desired effect.   The long form also lets you do cool things 
with arrays and object,  like

"{$my_array[$index]}"
"{$my_array["i_can_really_use_quotes_to_have_a_string_here"]}"
"{$object->special_property}"

If you do complex databases, where complete integration of security, 
constraints and automations are very important, then you may want to 
check out our Andromeda framework, www.andromeda-project.org.    I 
should let you know that it is right now a linux-only, postgres-only 
project, so if you are married to mySQL or Windows it won't help you today.

Wouldn't I rather do the following anyway?
$logfile_name=$year."_".$month."_".$day."_logfile.txt";

I would never have gotten the idea to do this the way you described. 
Concatenation of the strings is IMHO way easier to comprehend, at least 
for me and maybe even for PHP.

Yes, this all sounds so easy. Makes me wonder why I use gettext, in fact.

If/when you use apc or some other compiler cache, you'll never notice
the include of an array with a few hundred entries. Much better than
doing database lookups, like I've seen in some applications.

The Yahoo! team had to re-architect several parts of the framework to  
get it to do what they wanted.  Regardless of that, I hear they were  
having some significant scaling issues.  The Firefox Add-ons portal  
(https://addons.mozilla.org/) was built on CakePHP, and you can check  
out the source code here: http://svn.mozilla.org/addons/trunk/site/ 
app/.  To date, the site has handled the arguably higher load without  
a hitch.

Hi David

I would prefer the following anyway?
$logfile_name = $year . '_' . $month . '_' . $day . '_logfile.txt';

Although I would love to use my own, but as you have asked for publically 
available frameworks then top 3 are Symfony, Zend and CakePHP (not in order 
of rankings)

Do you have any additional insight into what "scaling issues" means?
Database overload? Session problems? Bloated "helpers? Their YAML is
compiled and caching is part of the framework, so I'm curious where the pain
points are versus say...for example...Cake.

I've used CakePHP for several projects at this point and I'm pretty 
happy with it. I've also had a hand in symphony, RoR, and some others 
and found CakePHP to be the best fit for my needs and coding style. YMMV.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Use of unneutered JSON considered harmful
Message-ID: <b76252690704050739g18415c0fu6375825201b93323@mail.gmail.com>

I've recommended (and continue to recommend) JSON as an efficient
alternative to XML for passing server-side date to client-side web
apps. But, as explained in the report linked below, an attacker can
use an everyday <script> tag to make a cross-domain request for
confidential JSON data, and access that data on execution by
overriding native methods on Object or Array.

http://www.fortifysoftware.com/servlet/downloads/public/JavaScript_Hijacking.pdf

The simple fix is to ensure that your JSON responses will not execute
when called via <script> tag, either by wrapping the JSON in a block
comment or by placing a while(1); command before the data. Your
Javascript code is responsible for removing the comment or while(1);
before eval()ing the JSON.

Again, if your web app returns JSON, make sure it cannot be executed
by placing a while(1); before the data.

It sounds like the major frameworks are being updated to deal with
this (I know Dojo and MochiKit have). If you use a framework to handle
your JSON, you should consult recent traffic on their developer's list
for the preferred means of neutering the code.

Hi Cliff,

Unfortunately, I wasn't privy to the specifics, but there are several  
other relevant bullet points from which you can draw some inferences:

(1) The developers of Symfony specifically discourage running it  
without a PHP accelerator.  In the PHP world, where limited control  
over deployment is often a reality, an accelerator is not always a  
given.   The fact that they essentially require one says something, I  
think.

(2) Several comparative benchmarks have been published, including  
this one: http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/?p=238  As with any benchmark,  
take it with a grain of salt, YMMV, and any other disclaimers or  
preemptive strikes I may have forgotten.  Read it carefully.   
Benchmarks can be affected by a million and one different things, but  
PMJ was very thorough in documenting his methodology.

Btw, the consensus on why the Zend Framework benched so fast is  
because it seems to do nothing for you. :-P

Kidding, kidding...

Bear in mind that they started working on that way before 1.0 even came 
out. I see that Yahoo Bookmarks is no longer beta though...

Surely, if you're getting enough hits to really need an accelerator then 
you should be running on your own server(s) where you *do* have control 
over whether an accelerator is used or not?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Running exec et al on a windows box
Message-ID: <46155B48.1020306@secdat.com>

I feel dumb asking this, but ole Ken ain't used windows in many a year.

When I execute exec() in a PHP script, a cmd.exe box flashes briefly on 
the windows console.  This is one of those annoyances I'd love to turn 
off if I could figure out how.

A long time ago I would have known how to turn this off with a PIF file 
or something, but I wouldn't know where to begin these days.

Any pointers?

Message-ID: <9CB3476D-2C4E-4D2B-85A8-7EFC00479566@email.smith.edu>

Hi there,

I have a little app that is a pseudo-day-planner.  Users can enter  
appointments via a form and then I use PHP and GD to write the  
appointment blocks onto a calendar image.

It works great in Safari on Mac and Firefox on PC.  However, it  
doesn't work with Internet Explorer on PC.  It appears that the issue  
is that IE is not loading a fresh version of the calendar image each  
time a change is made.

How can I force IE to load a fresh version of the image, either via  
PHP or HTML/HTTP code?

Thanks!

-Aaron

Just add a unique string to the URL of the image

<img src="createImg.php?<?php echo time(); ?>" />

So the URL of the string changes every time the user reloads the page

Message-ID: <8f494f760704060658w7d2d68e9x64fad089621606fc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I would like to know what would be the best way to do paged search
results for LDAP. Is it even possible to do it similiar to mysql limit
offset  functionality? Or should i do it via PHP.  However, I do know
LDAP has pagedSearch control.  i don't know how or if i need to invoke
it via php.

Thanks ,

alex

You better be VERY careful about the value of $Tablename.  If it's set 
directly by your script, that's fine, since you control what it can be.  
But if $Tablename comes from user input, you MUST check that $Tablename is 
a legitimate name before allowing it into a query.

I use echo rand(), but it's the same idea.

You could also use the following as an include file.:

<?php # nocache.php
// this script prevents all caching
// expires on any past date
header ("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00: GMT");
// last modified at current date and time
header ("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . "GMT");
// for HTTP 1.1:
header ("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
header ("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
// for HTTP 1.0
header ("Pragma: no-cache");
?>

Cheers,

I don't disagree, but that's not the point.  The point is that they  
basically require an accelerator for running Symfony applications,  
period; they don't qualify that statement by traffic levels or any  
other considerations.  This, to me, seems like a tacit acknowledgment  
of inefficiency, and they seem to be okay with that.

This conclusion also (ostensibly) reflected in the benchmarks I  
linked to previously which, you'll note, are based on Symfony 1.0.   
I'm not saying that performance is the end-all-be-all of web  
frameworks (I, for one, consider my own brain processor cycles more  
valuable than those of my server), but it's certainly a priority,  
though apparently less so for some than others.

The below code demonstrates how to use the pagedResultsControl. The PHP
LDAP API is somewhat course but it should work.

$continue = true;
while ($continue) {
    $paged_control = array(
                        array(
                            'oid' => PAGED_CONTROL_OID,

                                                        PAGE_SIZE, $cookie)
                        )
                     );
    if (!ldap_set_option($l, LDAP_OPT_SERVER_CONTROLS, $paged_control)) {
        echo "Not OK: ldap_set_option (controls)\n";
        exit;
    }     

    $sr = ldap_search($l, $query, $query_filter, $query_attribs, 0, 0, 0,
                      LDAP_DEREF_NEVER);

    if ($sr === FALSE) {
        echo "Not OK: ldap_search\n";
        exit;
    } 

    if (!ldap_parse_result ($l, $sr, &$errcode, &$matcheddn, &$errmsg,

        exit;
    }

    $paged_control_found = FALSE;

Using time() to add a unique string to the img src seems to work  
quite well, thanks!

I think I prefer this to the nocache solution which gets applied to  
all page elements.

This example will only prevent caching of the one image, so all other  
items on the page can be cached, which I don't mind.  Will help the  
page load faster, particularly beneficial for users on a slower  
connection.

Cheers,

As far as I understood the HTTP No-Cache Solution you should include 
this file in the Script that generates the image.

<?php
// createImg.php

require "nocache.php";

header ("Content-Type: image/jpeg");

imagejpeg (..);
?>

So this actually should only prevent the createImg.php from being 
cached. I am not quite sure whether this works with IE, tough. This 
browser seems to have some http caching related bugs.

Cheers,
Jay

Very interesting... thanks for the heads up.  With Firebug, you can  
set it so that it's only enabled for certain sites.  I've been only  
enabling it for sites I want to debug and it seems that  
vulnerabilities like this are a reason to keep doing it that way.   
Limiting the number of sites that Firebug is enabled on also seems to  
help keep Firefox from hogging tons of memory too.

That's cool that addons is using Cake.  I came across this article by  
Mike Morgan of addons a few months ago (actually posted about a year  
ago) about rewriting addons and using APC, LVS (linux virtual  
servers), and a memcache server: <http://morgamic.com/2006/04/14/

bitching about Smarty and Pear:DB as possibly causing too much  
overhead, so it's interesting that they ended up getting involved in  
Cake (not sure if he's still involved or not).

I've been very interested in scaling lately.  Most of my servers ar  
using APC and I'm currently getting by with having apps only using  
one server... but the day is rapidly approaching where I'm going to  
have to get serious about a multiple server setup.

Is anyone here using virtual servers?  It seems to have some nice  
benefits in terms of being able to easily move them between physical  
boxes and scale them up to more ram/cpu.  However, I've heard that  
you lose some performance and am trying to figure out when it's worth  
it.  I'm talking about virtual server's at the kernel level... like Xen.

Thanks!

    A great aid to scalability.

    My personal web sites are hosted on a "virtual private server" 
account where I get to have a lot of control over my Apache,  MySQL and 
PHP installation.  For a $20 a month I can host an unlimited number of 
virtual hosts.  I've got plenty of bandwidth and CPU -- but not so much 
RAM.  The system administrators have occasionally moved my virtual 
server to a different physical server.  They can do this in a few 
minutes and there's never a hitch.

    If my site gets more traffic,  I can contact Westhost and they could 
quickly move me to a better server,  with the dedicated resources I 
need.  I can quickly provision new servers to build a cluster,  a 
dedicated e-mail server,  or staging and development servers.  If my 
traffic drops,  I can move to a cheaper hosting plan.

All the cool kids are running Amazon EC2 Xen-based servers if you  
want to just give it a try :-)

I don't think you lose much performance when you "slice" it right  
(another science altogether).  I think there is a misconception that  
one can take > 8+ app/db/web servers and stack them on one box and  
have them run like they would expect if it was dedicated.

A good example of virtualized power is the MyEC2Manager written in PHP.
http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/servlet/KbServlet/ 
downloadImage/442-102-14/ec2-manager.gif

When PHP apps themselves are written w/ virtualization in mind is  
when it will get very interesting.  Imagine something like:

function job($queue) {
   // can I handle all of it?  If not fire up another x instances to  
help me out //
}

On top of all that there is an identical Firefox extension I use for  
EC2 instances ...
http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?entryID=609

Good stuff :-)

Guys,

We are going round and round with the methods for SSO.  Can something
like this be done?

EREJobs.com will include a file from ERE.net, the file on ERE.net
executes on the ere.net domain while doing so can it read the ere.net
cookie?  I know that is probably not allowed due to XSS.

We have looked into Open SSO and even the chapter from Advanced PHP
Programming on SSO however that leads to issues when using multiple
sites.  For instance you go to erejobs.com and login, it directs you
to ere.net authenticates you, sets a cookie for ere.net and back to
erejobs where a cookie is set.  However if you then go to another site
say eredirectory.com it will not see you logged in because no cookie
is set so you again have to click the login button.  You wont have to
login because the ere.net cookie exists it will just redirect you back
to eredirectory but it seems like a rats nest we will get into.

Any ideas on how else to accomplish something like this?

Hey Joe,

When I was at MIT we used certificates for multi-domain SSO
authentication (and authorization). I also have looked into other types
of SSO schemes and from a security and implementation stand-point
certificates look to be the best tool for the job. Here is a link to
MIT's user documentation on their certificate system:
http://web.mit.edu/ist/topics/certificates/

As far as the technical implementation goes, I found a lot of good
information by Googling. But if you contact someone in MIT's IT group
I'm sure they could provide some specifics on their implementation.

I'm not sure it could be implemented using Network Solutions type
hosting service, but something like SSO across multiple domains would
require a more extensive setup then they could provide anyways.

You may want to try other variants of the exec function such as passthru 
or system.

Tim,

THanks for your response.  Implementing a certificate system like MIT
is probably out of the question.  They are looking for a good solution
that will not take long to get up and running.

They are only going to have a handful of domains, probably 6 max that
will be setup for this.  Although I am sure they would expand in the
future I am not sure a system like this will be cost effective for
them.

At this point, you should be redirecting them back to your SSO server
(ere.net) (as opposed to showing a login form) and automatically logging
them in if the ere.net cookie is present.

[re]Read through the list on page 340 and 341 of Advanced PHP
Programming very carefully and study the figures 13.1 and 13.2.  It make
take a few times to click, but it really does describe the process well.

Also check out using UML kernels like the Linode guys:

Ive been giving it some serious consideration.

They have their own tools for handling config and console access to 
the virtual machine. Being able to upgrade via software is pretty cool.

Does anyone know approximately how much longer double-quotes take to parse
in a controlled environment?

I'm about to inherit a project using double-quotes all over the place, and
due to (mis)management, I need to back up my assertions with data.  (In
other words, a link showing varying runtime's using happy colors will do :)

My understanding is "little if any"; recent versions of PHP 4 have  
eliminated the time-difference in single/double quote parsing.

In fact, here's a blog entry about it from Sara Golemon:

Hrm.. I just ran a real world test and the results were drastically 
different.

With single quotes, it took about 3.4 seconds to complete.
With double quotes, 22  seconds on average.

My setup:
# php -v
PHP 5.1.6 (cli) (built: Nov  3 2006 07:27:53)
Zend Engine v2.1.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2006 Zend Technologies
AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2200+
1GB RAM

It would be interesting for you guys to share your results too.

Here is the code. Run it from the command line with: "php -f quotetest.php"
or load it in your browser.

<?php
// Test speed of double quotes vs single quotes
// Rolan Yang rolan at omnistep.com   4/10/2007

$insertthis="abcdefg";

if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) {$newline="<br>\n";} else 
{$newline="\n";}
$start=microtime(TRUE);
print "Start: $start{$newline}";


for ($x=1;$x<5000000;$x++) {
        // comment out one of the two lines below when testing
        
#$test="aerg;jia;rgjia;erigja;ergja;rga;erigjae;rigjae;riogja;eriogjae;rgjae;riojga;erji{$insertthis}";
        
$test='aerg;jia;rgjia;erigja;ergja;rga;erigjae;rigjae;riogja;eriogjae;rgjae;riojga;erji'.$insertthis;
}
$end=microtime(TRUE);
print "End: $end{$newline}Total=".($end-$start).$newline;
?>

I wouldn't have believed it, but I got similar results.  However, it
simply just isn't the presence of the double quotes, but the actual
interpolation taking place in the string.

this:

$test="foostring".$myvar; //double quotes

was just as fast as:

$test='foostring'.$myvar; //single quotes

So, any dreams you may have had of just writing a sed script to
replace all double quotes with single quotes have been crushed. :-)

Curious how writing for virtualized/clustered environment like that is
different from writing for threaded environment, which we've pretty
much decided PHP isn't capable of doing.

Is it just about finding places where you can spawn more processes
using shared memory?

Or is it about assuming that multiple local servers will be marshalled
to handle any one request to a front-end controller -- like web
services but without the nasty http lag because all the services are
on the same subnet?

Seems that's how they used to say Google Search worked, where the
request was dispatched in the background to multiple servers, each of
which was responsible for looking in its own slice of the index. All
the responses were aggregated, ordered by pagerank and rendered as a
response.

I don't think complete elimination is possible. Because it is obvious that 
when some thing is looked first for "expansion" and then taking 'as it is', 
if it is not to be expanded, then there must be some time-difference. However 
it could be that time-difference may have been reduced. But I don't think 
complete elimination is possible. To me 2nd effect of "bad practicing" is 
more important as far as coding is concerned.

Even if there is little time-difference, this also tells that one is using 
inappropriate ways while coding. So this issue has impact from both sides. To 
me it is against good practice. To some extent it is quite fine but when 
people "double quote" paragraph of 100 lines containing static data, it would 
be called as bad practice.

Thanks

I agree, I thought for some time on how to optimize my code and I am 
pretty sure there are things that give me a bigger bang for the buck 
than changing double quotes to single quotes.
I further think that there is a balance between code performance and 
readability. I've seen code where the programmer drops out of PHP for 
even a single word instead of concatenating that into the echoed string. 
  That is plain silly and I doubt that this turns into a performance 
improvement at all compared to doing that for the before mentioned 100 
lines of static text. But even for that there is maybe an explanation. 
The first thing for PHP that I learned was this:
print("Hello World!");
It took me about a year to make the move to the much easier echo and 
much later I learned that I can drop out of PHP into plain HTML and then 
go back. Bad practices are typically coming from bad teaching, and 
especially the PHP manual on php.net makes excessive use of double 
quotes. No wonder only a few really understand what the difference is, 
what to use when and why.

It is because, probably, those who knows such differences do not do 
documentation or if they don't have time to do documentation then they are 
not reviewing what has been done by documentation team and how it is written.

There may well be.  One issue that I have not seen discussed in this

nearly unconscious. This situation minimizes errors and maximizes 
speed, which is always a good combination goal. A good text editor

which is always (or at least almost always) more important.

I'm thinking that such a php optimizing script would definitely be very 
useful.
It would be beneficial if someone were to write one up and share it with

Hey all, 

I've searched the sites calendar and see nothing listed for April.
I do see an event that passed, March 29th.

I'd like to attend the next meeting, just want to know when and where.

Thanks.

Thank you.

There are some, like myself, who come from different language 
backgrounds/customs and use that experience to program in php. 
Additionally, if you are an "all purpose" web programmer, then you 
also program in other languages as well (i.e., mysql, javascript, 
ajax, html, xml, etc.).

The "jumping-in/out" boundaries between languages becomes blurred 
when solving a problem in concert with different languages. I often 
look at web programming not as several languages, but as a single 
language with many different rules in which I have to find a common 
path. No one set of rules can be applied to all, at least not yet. 
But the trend/need, as I see it, is there.

Cheers,

tedd

I would also like to express agreement with Micheal.

Code readability is extremely important. In PHP you're often working 
with several different languages at once, and it's important to keep 
that in mind (especially if you're working with other developers who may 
be specialized in certain areas).

A few microseconds are important when speed is your *top* priority, but 
rarely does it ever become that. As developers our job is to evaluate 
the priorities that come into play and make the decisions that offer the 
best balance.

This is a very good point, and one I am a firm believer in.  If you keep
a consistent style throughout all your coding you benefit in many ways.

The biggest single advantage for me is that I can quickly scan any given
block of code and see roughly what it's doing.  Because all correct code
'looks' the same, it is also much easier to spot things that are out of
the ordinary and might be bugs.

There are advantages too, once you start doing things consistently a lot
of common sequences do become automatic, which definitely makes for
faster and more accurate coding, and fewer parse errors!

Joel Spolsky actually has a pretty good article about this kind of thing:

http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html

I don't use all the techniques he discusses in the article, but the
principle of using rules that make 'wrong code look wrong' is a good one.

Message-ID: <8d9a42800704111051y599368dbj911d6c29eb9e3918@mail.gmail.com>

Guys I know why this is acting the way it is, however I do not know
how to correct it.

## Rewrite something.domain.com/... to something.domain.com/...
RewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} ^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^((dev\.)(.+)\.)?(ere\.net)$ [NC]
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|runtime|robots\.txt|assets)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/%3%{REQUEST_URI} [QSA,L]

the 3rd RewriteCond says to run this is the first /something/ does not
match the ones in that list, so if i add /index\.php/ before the %3%
in the RewriteRule it works fine, however I wish to not have the
/index.php/ in the URL, yet I cannot list out all of the sub-domains
in that RewriteCond list. I tried to use %3% in the list but it
failed. It continued to run the rule.

The rule is running properly but never stopping until the browser
stops it. if you go to http://dev.sub.domain.com/ it will redirect you
to http://dev.sub.domain.com/sub/ but it goes continuosly adding more
and more /sub/ to the url.

Also i do not wish to show the url in the address bar. All i want to
show there is http://dev.sub.domain.com/ but in the background that
should rewrite to http://dev.sub.domain.com/sub/

So if i type in http://dev.sub.domain.com/folder/ in the background it
will actually be calling http://dev.sub.domain.com/sub/folder/

I hope I have explained the issues clearly.

Any help will be appreciated.

April will probably be another informal meeting.  Any ideas from anyone?

June is Adobe which I'll be adding to the calendar soon.

But April and May are open for now - if anyone has any ideas, let me know -
otherwise we'll probably do another informal NYPHP-Live discussion (probably
at IBM this time though).

I'm happy to give a talk, if you don't get a better offer.

Am I right in thinking the date of the next meeting is 24 Apr?

My favorite topics are web application security, sessions, and testing.
I can also speak about DTD strategies:

Hey all,

Some application penetration testing would be fun.

Maybe using both tools (nessus) and scripts, brute forcing, cookie altering,
sql inject.

I dont know if that's something to put together in the next week, but
I would donate time to providing a portion of what's listed.

Just some thoughts.

- Ben

That's not a bad idea - maybe a cooperative presentation on a specific set

Security, sessions and testing all sound great.

Specifically, I would be very interested in discussions about  
practices that can be done to write secure code/apps, and things that  
can be done to test it, attempt to find vulnerabilities, etc.

Have you ever considered a database primer?  A very simple presentation 
could be built around a handful of ideas:

1) Vocabulary demystification,  column=field, tuple=row=record, 
relation=table, foreign key = reference, primary_key = "code" or unique 
value

2)  Why you can do so much with primary and foreign keys

3)  Is normalization a black art, or a simple matter of technique

4)  What do people mean by denormalization, why do some people hate it 
so much?  Why do others say it is no big deal?

5) Finally, why programmers have trouble with databases and why database 
people have trouble with code, the so-called "impedance mismatch".


I'd be happy to prepare something.

This is a good idea, too.  So, we went from not having any speaker, to
having too much material :)

Folks who would be willing to present (April for sure, possibly May) please
ping me directly and we can schedule things in.

Both talks would be very cool....  Chris, I would prefer the testing 
discussion.  Are you talking about security testing or general testing, 
like the use of test suites to perform regression testing, ect?  I would 
prefer the later.  Seems like an issue that comes up once a year and 
deserves that attention.

Off the top of my head, I think one simple way to solve it is to put  
a .htaccess file in each of your "subdirectory" folders that simply  
has RewriteEngine On which clears out the rules for that folder so it  
won't try to process the rules of the parent folder.

Either that or you figure out how to put a conditional so that it  
doesn't match the second time around.

The http://%{HTTP_HOST}/ part of your last rule is causing that.

I'm actually having a bit of trouble deciphering how your rule works  
exactly.  There might be a simpler way to do it.  I guess I could  
RTFM... but if you've got a second to explain in english, what does % 
{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} and %3%{REQUEST_URI} do?

I know testing was mentioned.  Has anyone played with Selenium at all?

http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide/

Our development team is beginning to look at integrating this platform 
into our testing.  Anyone else using this at all?

I have used this a bit in testing some of the web-apps that I've 
developed. The problem is that none of the other developers on my team 
are willing to use it, and our application changes often enough that it 
often breaks the tests and they have to be re-written.

I use SimpleTest more often (there is a plugin for Selenium that I've 
not managed to implement successfully), even though Selenium does a much 
better job of testing "the big picture" (Javascript included). The 
problem is that it's so easy to break the Selenium tests 
unintentionally, and it involves quite a bit of time to write another test.

It's a pretty powerful tool, and I highly recommend it, despite it's 
shortcomings.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Anybody using JSON parser?
Message-ID: <461FF273.3000409@secdat.com>

Andromeda uses its own syntax for data files, which I would love to get 
rid of.

JSON strikes me as a worthy candidate.  Is anybody using it on the 
server-side with enough confidence to answer this question:  Can I type 
a file of JSON stuff by hand and convert it easily into a nested 
associative array?

The example from andromeda would be:

table table_name {
   module: demo;
   description: My Table Name;

  column example { primary_key: Y; }
}

which we convert into an associative array:

$tables['table_name'] = array(
   'module'=>'demo'
   ,'description'=>'My Table Name'
   ,'column'=>array(
      'example'=>array('primary_key'=>'Y')
  )
);

The only real need I have is a syntax that can easily specify 
property-value pairs and nested elements which have their own 
property-value pairs and their own nested elements and so on.

I use JSON in slidePresenter for transferring nested arrays between PHP 
and JavaScript.  It works so well I pretty much just forget about it.

The parser I'm using is this file: 
http://mike.teczno.com/JSON/JSON.phps, which is a part of the PEAR 
proposal for JSON 
(<http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=198>).

For converting PHP associative arrays into JSON format this has been 
very good, and I've not seen any limit to the levels to which the arrays 
can be nested.

See around line 94 in the source file for a quick howto.

I don't see why not.  JSON is just a standard javascript object, so
hand-typing is pretty simple and decoding into an array with the json
extension is as simple as
$aPhpData = json_decode($sJsonData);

I highly recommend using the json extension if you can (comes standard with
php5.2).  The speed difference over using a script is astounding.  I use it
on all my projects (ajaxified cms) without issue.

If you're pre-php5.2...

Win32: http://pecl4win.php.net/ext.php/php_json.dll

Thanks for the tip.  Will have to check it out when we start porting up 
to php5.

It's available for php4 as well, which is where I started using it.  Only
upgraded my code base to 5 recently (February) and have been using the
extension for nearly a year.

For those who read PHP Architect magazine, you can expect to see quite a mention of the PHP JSON functionality in my upcoming article scheduled for the May, 2007 issue.

I'd heard/read the term a few times, but after this post I finally took a
look.  Very interesting.  Thanks John!

Rob i ended up getting it working :D

I am not sure about the REDIRECT_STATUS but here is what i do know
about the code

RewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} ^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^dev\.((.+)\.)ere\.net$ [NC,OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^((.+)\.)?ere\.net$ [NC]
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|images|robots\.txt|ZendPlatform|assets|zxcv)(/.*)?$
[NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/%2%{REQUEST_URI} [QSA,L]

The second line says that the HTTP HOST must match the pattern
following it, it must start with dev.*.ere.net.

The third condition says that it must start with *.ere.net

The fourth line says ONLY run this rule if the following are not found
in the url.

The last line re-writes the urls so that they all go through /index.php/*/

meaning if i called the following url

http://dev.auth.ere.net/this/is/a/test/
it would be re-written to
http://dev.auth.ere.net/index.php/auth/this/is/a/test/

that would match the second condition.

The issue i was running into is when i was trying to match the following

http://dev.ere.net/this/is/a/test/

it wouldnt see anything since dev. was required and matched so it
would do something like this

http://dev.ere.net//this/is/a/test/

However it is all solved now and will work on our dev domains and
production domains.  Since we are using dynamic sub-domains we needed
a way to route them all to the same index.php file.

Thanks for the response.

I can't answer that question specifically, but I can say that we've been
using the JSON functionality in 5.2 quite heavily for some social networking
applications and it's been solid.

Whether someone wants to write config files in it is another matter :)
Personally, I'd recommend XML for that.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SQL Full text searcing and storing
Message-ID: <001a01c77e9f$d2979dc0$6a01a8c0@gamebox>

Hello Again,

I'd like to know if anyone can recommend a book or whitepapers on SQL for full text searching and storing.
I'm working on an application that will essentially store a fixed number of web pages cached ahead of time
and allowing searching of those records.

I've worked with large (million) record tables before, but not ones that store large amounts of text.

I'm curious what field types, indexes are best for this type of application.

I'm also curious about benchmarks. Google can return a huge number of records in a fraction of a second.
Is this a forked process, each doing small amounts of work, or one large beefy server doing the transaction?

My DB experiance is mostly mySQL and I would prefer to build using this.

Thanks

- Ben

Have you considered search engine software, such as mnogosearch?
You'll get all of the fancy heuristics (plurals, stopwords, page
element weight), URL indexing, query tracking, status code resolving
(what if the page is no longer available?), etc..

I realize that this isn't what you asked for and you probably aren't
building a search engine "proper", but you might want to check out a
search engine product anyway as it may resolve some of your
application issues for you.

Plus, mnogosearch has a PHP extension so you can talk to it directly,
get your results and display/use them as you like.

Good Luck,

Tom

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PCRE, utf8, Exceptions and you
Message-ID: <002d01c77edc$f5e6ff90$6400a8c0@enobrev>

Afternoon all,

What I'm trying to do...
------------------------
The validation classes in my library use PCRE's utf8 modifier.
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php (look for
PCRE_UTF8)

This allows me to do something like this:
echo preg_replace('/[^\p{L}\p{Nd}\p{Zs}]/u', '', 'abc123@#$'); // outputs
abc123

Which for ASCII is the equivalent of:
echo preg_replace('/[^\d\w\s]/', '', 'abc123@#$'); // outputs abc123 - or
echo preg_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/', '', 'abc123@#$'); // outputs abc123

Or rather, replaces anything that's not a letter, number or space, but with
the added benefit of supporting Unicode characters.
 

The Problem
-----------
Unfortunately, some (definitely not all) of my clients' on managed hosting
servers don't have PCRE's Unicode support configured.  I'm dealing with
their support staff to resolve the issue when possible, but would like to
look for these issues in my library as well to degrade and handle them
gracefully.

It seems php does not allow you to catch the PCRE warning given by the
server if PCRE isn't compiled to support Unicode.  I've seen this in the
past with named captures ('/(?P<numbers>[\d]+)/'), and resorted to just
taking out the named parts instead of working around the error.


Proposed Solution
-----------------
In this case, I would like to be able to fall back to ASCII checks if the
support isn't built in, like this:
try {
	echo preg_replace('/[^\p{L}\p{Nd}\p{Zs}]/u', '', $sVar);
}
catch (Exception $e) {
      echo preg_replace('/[^\d\w\s]/', '', $sVar);
}

And then probably output to a log warning me (and not my beloved visitors)
that the server needs to be reconfigured)


The Error
---------
Unfortunately this doesn't throw the exception.  It just outputs:

"Warning: preg_replace() [function.preg-replace]: Compilation failed: PCRE
does not support \L, \l, \N, \P, \p, \U, \u, or \X at offset 3 in
/home/whatever/pcretest.php on line 3"

I suppose I could capture the error with an error handler and try to figure
out if it was the error I'm looking for, but that seems so messy and
potentially unreliable.  Aren't we supposed to be able to use exceptions for
this sort of thing in php5+?


The Question
------------
Does anyone have experience with catching PCRE errors or just preg function
errors in general and dealing with them accordingly?


Thank You
---------
Mark Armendariz

    Most popular relational databases have a full text search 
extension.  This includes MySQL,  Oracle,  MS SQL and Postgres -- 
unfortunately,  these implementations do not correspond to any 
standard,  so the details are different for different databases.  MySQL 
has a full-text index that works quite well,  with that caveat that it 
only works for MyISAM at the moment:

    http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-search.html

this means you can have full-text indexes or transactions,  not both.  
Assuming you have a MyISAM table,  implementing fulltext search is as 
simple as creating a FULLTEXT index and running queries with the MATCH 
operator.  You could be benchmarking MySQL with your own data in less 
than half an hour (unless it takes more than that to rebuild your 
index!)  The fulltext index will be updated automatically when you 
modify the table,  so it's a real "set-it-and-forget-it" proposition.

    Postgresql implements FT search with the "tsearch2" extension which 
involves a shared library and stored procedures.  It feels a lot like 
somebodies science project -- you'll need to write your own code to 
maintain the index,  and dump/restores of your database may be an 
adventure,  but tsearch2 is flexible and lets you do really neat things.

    Years ago I spent a weekend writing some perl scripts that create an 
inverted index in mysql tables.  It's an inefficient way to do full text 
searching,  but it lets you do things that other search engines don't 
do,  such as similarity searches.  I loaded about 200,000 short 
documents into it on a cheap PC and found I could get interactive 
responses (<10 seconds) doing some pretty fancy things.  I've used this 
to support a few little research projcts.

    There are plenty of other specialized full-text engines,  such as 
Lucene and Xerces,  that do a great job,  but would require you to do 
work to maintain the index.

    So far as Google,  here's what I can tell you:

* Google almost certainly is based on a distributed main-memory 
database.   Google keeps it's index in the RAM of a large number of 
computers...  It's too big to fit in the RAM of one machine,  so queries 
get split between several machines.

* Google's most critical 'secret' isn't pagerank,  but the use of 
implicit phrase searching.  Older methods of text retrieval don't 
consider the ordering of words when scoring -- if you want to get 
results like Google,  you really do need to score words higher when they 
are in proximity to each other,  and you need an algorithm that blends 
this well with other sources of information.

* Google's other 'secret' is that it's a got a huge amount of text to 
worth with.  The real intelligence is in the data it searches,  ~not~ in 
it's algorithms -- Google's algorithms just bring that intelligence 
out.  You have different problems when you do text retrieval at 
different scales:  if you've got 100 documents and expect 2 to be 
relevant for a query,  it's probably not acceptable to have a recall of 
50%...  For small numbers of documents,  you have to work hard to 
eliminate false negatives.  If you've got 10 billion documents,  and 1 
million are relevant to a particular topic,  you don't really care if 
you lose 90% of them -- but you do care that a few really excellent 
documents float to the top.

Academic researchers who tried applying algorithms like PageRank to 
small data sets (1 million documents) couldn't produce evidence that 
PageRank works -- because it doesn't for small data sets.

Hello Again, 

Tom: I looked into the software mentioned, but my project
is an application I'm developing on my spare time, so my budget
is small. It does look very good, but a bit too much money at this point.

Ted: The paper you supplied is great, I read it over and understood it
well enough. A good start.

Paul: The information you provided was helpful as well. I printed out
the mySQL full text search page and read it over. mySQL seems to have
everything I need for searching.

Since I'm doing a search of "title" and "body", I believe mySQL can
take me pretty far.  

One question I still have is about building/rebuilding the indexes.
Is this done when new fields are added to the database?
Or a routine that needs to be done more often?

Thanks for you help everyone.

- Ben

Ben, mnogosearch (and there are others) is free software with a GPL
license.  You can pay for premium support (which is very good, BTW),
but it is not required.

If you are distributing your application and don't want to release
your code (or are developing on Windows) I guess you would then need a
license.

    That's the beauty of it -- a mySQL fulltext index is maintained 
automatically.  Once it is created,  it is automatically updated when 
you insert,  update and delete rows,  just like any other index.

My understanding (I could be wrong) is that every time you add more 
data, you have to rebuild the index to be able to use FULL TEXT. 
However, that doesn't need to be done until the next search.

So, what I'm thinking is to set a dirty flag that will be true if 
data has been added and false if the index is up to date and then 
have the indexing triggered by a search request. However, I'm still 
working on it, so there may be better ways to do this.

Anyone care to comment?

Cheers,

tedd

Which is it? If its the first one, that's great, but what if I'm doing a ton 
of inserts
throughout the day...Will the database be locked while its rebuilding the 
index?
How long will this take? I should have around 1 million records, but since 
the data
goes stale after about 5 days, I can prune the database. So, I should never 
have
much over or under 1million records.

My data is being populated by a cron job and could insert 100's of new rows 
every day, throughout the entire day..
is this going to be a problem?

That sounds good, but I dont want a single user to wait 20m while
the index file is rebuilt....

Like I said, I could be wrong -- I would go with the other advice OR 
ask the MySQL list.

5.2 introduced recoverable errors, I believe those can be caught...
doc is spotty on this though.

A warning is just a warning, so can't be caught, though it can be supressed.

If you haven't already solved this problem, I would suggest a test
where you try compiling a very simple preg_match using the unicode
codes, suppress any warnings with @, and see if you get the expected
result. If you do, proceed with unicode, if not log and fall back to
ascii.

I'd just noticed it right after I made the post.  I plan on mixing it in and
I'm glad to see them, though the client server I'm currently working with is
on 5.16 at the moment, so I still have to work around it for now.

No doubt.  I try to catch every little error, warning and notice I get and
handle or report it accordingly when possible so I can have a production
server running E_STRICT without a bead of sweat.  Anal to be sure, but it
leaves me warm and fuzzy and makes for happy portability.

No doubt a good suggestion.  I ended up trapping the error with my error
handler class doing a strpos for 'preg_', which is doing the job well.
Here's a couple excerpts (slightly modified so they'll make sense here):
    
class PregException extends Exception {
    public function __construct($sMessage, $iCode = 0, $sFile, $iLine,
$aContext = null) {
        parent::__construct($sMessage, $iCode);

        $this->file     = $sFile;
	  $this->line     = $iLine;
	  $this->context  = $aContext;
    }
}

class Error {
    function __construct() {
        set_error_handler(array(&$this, 'eh'));
    }

    function eh($iErrorNumber, $sError, $sFile, $iLine, $aContext) {
        if (strpos($sError, 'preg_') !== false) {
            throw new PregException($sError, $iErrorNumber, $sFile, $iLine,
$aContext);
        } else {
            $this->add($iErrorNumber, $sError, $sFile, $iLine, $aContext);
        }
        return true;
    }

    // other error handler code
}

// part of my validation class
function checkRegex($mValue) {
    // Unicode Letters, Digits and Spaces
    try {
        $bBadData = preg_match('/[^\p{L}\p{Nd}\p{Zs}]/u', $mValue);
    }
    catch (PregException $e) {
        $bBadData = preg_match('/[^\w\s]/', $mValue);
    }
    
    if ($bBadData) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

Thanks for the suggestions!

Mark

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [OT] MySQL Queue
Message-ID: <003701c780fc$afd75ff0$6a01a8c0@gamebox>

Hello Again, 

I have questions about implementing a queue w/mySQL.

I was thinking the simplest way to build it would be as such:

job_queue table:
First[job_id, time][job_id+1, time+n]Last

1) Every x min, select the oldest time from the queue (LIMIT 1)
2) DELETE that row from the queue
3) Execute the job

A record is inserted into the que whever a user completes the job application wizard.
That new row contains (job_id, time( )).

Seems like a pretty simple way to build the queue. I think when I run jobs, they'll be forked off
so I can run multiple jobs. However, I have not considered how the parent process that forks
these children will watch over the jobs.

What if a job takes to long, I should prolly kill it, and reinsert it into the queue, plus keep track
of failures. We dont want to keep running a job that fails.

Any ideas?

- Ben

Simple improvement would be to mark the job as "active" along with the
pid of the process that is working on it, rather than deleting the
record. That way if something goes wrong, you don't have to reinsert.
Also, you can tell how many active jobs you have and decline to start
new ones past a certain threshold.

Think about what information you need for error recovery, too. After
all, you probably only want to retry a "problem" job a certain number
of times before giving up, notifying an admin, etc.

Hello, 

Good points.

So once the child finishes, it returns the status (failure || success)
to the parent. Then the parent can mark the job as completed
and remove it from the queue?

If it returns failure, we could do various error_log/debug.
We could also, increment the attempted_run counter (+1)
and if it reaches, two failed runs, we remove it from the queue
as well.

Has anyone done forking on PHP5 or have sample code?


- Ben

I assume that just one parent process would be performing this and  
then forking a process to handle the job afterwards, right?   
Otherwise, you'd have the chance that two processes would read the  
queue at the same time and process the same job -- in that case, a  
read lock could work.

I've only done forking in C.  I saw this in the php manual: "Process  
Control support in PHP is not enabled by default. You have to compile  
the CGI or CLI version of PHP with --enable-pcntl configuration  
option when compiling PHP to enable Process Control support."  The  
examples in the manual seem like a good starting point:  http:// 
us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.pcntl.php

Hello, 

Yes, the parent process would handle the fork, 
the reaping of the children, etc...

I've looked into pcntl in the past, never got to
far w/it. I've read a lot about forking in C/Perl, 
but never really had to code it myself.

Thanks, I'll go back and read the php.net stuff.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OOP Question: Calling a classes function from another
	class
Message-ID: <001d01c781c0$e85f6ba0$6a01a8c0@gamebox>

Hello Again, 

I've been porting my PHP4 libs to PHP5 OO, and I thus I have no formal OOP training.
This is my crash course.

So, I've created an error logging class, 

class Error

and I want to call it from another class.
Is it necessary to create another instance of the class?

I tried to use the Error:Log("error", log_level) (Calling form the Class Utility)
way of calling the function, but the Log( ) function
using $this->someOtherFunction and this is being mistaken for the parent Class (Utility->someOtherFunction) not the Error class.

So, do I have to create a new instane of the object?

Is there any way to create the object in the constructor of the other class,
and then pass it around and call it when I need it via $this->OBJECT->function?

Thanks!

- Ben

If you're just starting out in the PHP5 OOP world, I highly recommend 
Zandstra's "PHP 5 Objects, Patterns, and Practice." I promise you it's 
worth the $20.

If you need it in the entire class, you could create a new instance of 
the object in the __construct function ($this->Error = new Error) and 
then use it later. Either that or you could make it static and call it 
throughout the program (assuming that fits your needs).

Something along these lines might work for you:

class Error {
  public static function Log (param1, param2, 
) {
    

  }
}




Error::Log (value1, value2, 
);

Hello Brian,

Thanks, that's what I did.

$this->Error->function( ... );

Works great.

Thanks to everyone.

I just went to order the book on bookpool.com, but its out of stock.
I'll wait a bit and get it soon. Thanks.

When you get the book (or sooner if you look online), you should  
check out the Singleton pattern.

If your class method can't be static (because it needs access to  
$this - which isn't available for static methods), then a Singleton  
is a good option to use if you only  need one instance of the object  
in your app.

It works basically like this:

class Error
{
   private static $_instance = null;

   public static function singleton()
   {
     if (self::$_instance === null) {
       self::$_instance = new Error();
     }

     return self::$_instance;
   }
}

Then, wherever you need to get your Error object, just call

$error = Error::singleton();

Somewhat unrelated to all of this, can someone point me to a good and 
concise primer of the benefits of OOP? So far I cannot think of 
something where I said, gee, I really think that would be awesome to 
have, and it turned out to be an object. Why would I want to use objects?

Thanks for wisening up an ignorant.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] IPC Problems
Message-ID: <008201c78292$ab365810$6a01a8c0@gamebox>

Hi All, 

I'm trying to write a script, that forks children to each run a job, provided by
the parent in the form of a job_id, passed by IPC msg_send( ).

Now, when I run the job, I get some problems w/the DB loosing the connection.
I also have problems w/the job_id that's get passed ..sometimes, somehow, its the
PID...I dont get it.

It seems like the IPC is all over the place ... I've included the output from the script,
the database tables, and the source of the script.

Any help is greatly appreaciated. I've read the php.net pcntl_and msg- (IPC) stuff over and over.


What the goal is:
1) Parent, selects the next job to run.
2) Marks job as active =1, stores the PID
3) Forks off a child to run this (job_id passed to child via msg_send( ))
4) Child runs, finishes job and marks as active = 0, incremenents run count, tells parent to kill them
5) Rinse lather repeat

Message-ID: <dc1507df0704190800m252faf95w7f3d5f9645a9694c@mail.gmail.com>

Wondering if anyone has any thoughts on a strange problem I'm having
with Mail_Queue. I have an application that's been using it and
working great, but now it is recording two records in the mail_queue
database table for every email it sends. So it sends double the mail
it is supposed to send.

This does not appear to be a problem of lag time between the send
command and marking the records as sent in the database -- instead, it
is actually writing extra rows in the database and sending them
accordingly.

Any thoughts?

Thanks-
Robyn

Hi All,
 
Anyone have a code sample or link to an example for getting UPS shipping
rates via UPS's XML Online Tools?
 
I downloaded their documentation but the only examples they provide are
in ASP or Java.
 
Thanks for any help you can provide.

Hi Ben,

It's been a couple years since I had to deal with forking processes
and such, so I'm not up to debugging your code. But one thing that
might help you simplify is to remember that, at the time of the fork,
the child's environment is the same as the parent's.

If the parent loads the job record from the database into an array or
object named $job, and then forks, the child will have its own copy of
$job and can just go to work on it.

IIRC the database connection is a special case because it's a resource
-- same goes for file pointers. Nevertheless, the child should have
access to the username and password (in $dbSet?) to be able to make
it's own connection to the db.

Hello Chris, 

Ok, makes sense.

I tried having the child create its own DB connection (object)
which seems to work all right, until it executes the query,
at which point it says the DB is gone.

I'm trying something a bit different now, using two files, parent
and child and then using the queue to send messages back in forth,
such as, the childs PID (so the parent could kill it if it runs to long)
and the return value of the child (success of failure).

This way eliminates the fork and the reaping, as the child's just exit(0)
when they are done, or worse (haven't coded this yet), the parent can 
kill them (since it tracks the pids and job_ids).

Truthfully, I dont know what the easiest way to do this is, nor 
can I find any good documentation on IPC and php.

- Ben

I've tried to accomplish with two scripts.

Execept I didn't think ahead of enough and now
I'm having the problem of calling exec( )
and the parent script waiting until it returns.

I can't seem to call exec(script &) <-- & to force to background
but the parent still waits...

Any way to get around this?

..............FROM PARENT.................
    /* Run the child_job to execute this job_id. */
    exec("env -i /usr/bin/php child_job.php -i $jobIdToRun");

    /* IT WAITS HERE UNTIL child_job.php IS DONE RUNNING */

    /* Child needs to report back its PID. */
    msg_receive($MSG_QUEUE, 1, $real_type, 16384, $childPID, 1, 0, $err);
    error_log("childPID($childPID)");

Have any of you guys had any experience doing sftp transfers with PHP? I 
need something fairly robust that allows me to confirm that the file did 
indeed arrive intact.

I've looked into libssh2 (using ssh2.sftp:// wrapper) but I've had 
little luck with that. The next best thing I've found is being able to 
use a key to use ssh without entering a password (something I've done 
before, but not with PHP).

I'm not asking for code or anything, just wondering if anyone else on 
the list has ever done this and perhaps if you could point me to any 
resources that were helpful when you were setting it up.

It sounds like you might be making this more complicated than it needs
to be.

The child can read the job_id from a variable set in the parent before
the fork, why not just do this?

> 4) Child runs, finishes job and marks as active = 0, incremenents run count, tells parent to kill them

Why does the child need the parent to kill them?  A call to exit() at
the end of the child section should do the trick just fine.

Hope this helps,

Dan

A good (maybe better) alternative is to use FUSE ssh bindings,  
basically you mount your SSH as something like /mnt/ssh/server1/ and  
read it as a normal file.  fopen() or md5() check.

On some systems it's already there.

On Mac ... http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/

Have you thought of using CURL to upload the file over SSL? The 
receiving script could respond with a confirmation, or even better, 
return an md5 hash.

The problem is that I have no control over the receiving script (another 
company is involved). The receiving end isn't even a Linux server, it's 
some sort of Windows/ASP server running an SSH implementation. So I'm 
required to send the file via some sort of SSH tunnel.

I am mulling the idea of using scp, but I'm not sure at this point how I 
would confirm the file arrived intact.

Wouldn't scp generate an error if there was a problem?

I don't know anything about the libssh2 extension but you could simply
use popen to call scp. To validate the file was transferred successfully
you could then follow up with a call to popen and a command like:

 ssh host.foo.net "ls -l file.txt"

and then parse the size from the output and compare it to the local
file size.

Hey again,

Good point.

I've simplified this all into two small scripts.

If anyone is interested in the solution, contact me off
list and I'll send the source.

I will have an additional sanity/mantience script that ensures no
job runs longer than a given threshold.

Thanks for the help.

  Hi All,

  Anyone have a code sample or link to an example for getting UPS shipping rates via UPS's XML Online Tools?

  I downloaded their documentation but the only examples they provide are in ASP or Java.

  Thanks for any help you can provide.

Eric,
 
I purchased the two PHP Architect editions you mentioned and was able to
use the code for my purposes. The code produces the correct result (the
rate price) however the shipping class throws a warning as follows:
 

Warning: fgets() [function.fgets
<http://10.100.54.10/bitweaver/themes/styles/supercoups/function.fgets>
]: SSL: fatal protocol error in
C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\bitweaver\themes\styles\supercoups\ups_shipping.class
.php on line 64
 
Line 64 reads as follows:
 
while(!feof($fp)) $upsresponse[]=fgets($fp, 4096);
 
Any idea why this happens or should I just ignore the warning? I have
display_errors turned on temporarily for debugging purposes otherwise
this wouldn't show up.
 
Thanks,
 
Tim Boyden

It is possible that the UPS server is now running under IIS in which case it will have the same issue as the AuthorizeNet server mentioned on page 44 in part 2 (php|architect Sept. 2004) where SSL connections do not get cleanly closed. If this is the case and the code works perfectly otherwise then you can preced fgets with an @ and it will surpress the error.

As just announced today, I'm giving tomorrow's talk, and the topic is
Security 2.0. Yeah, I'm poking fun at Web 2.0 with the title, but there
are some interesting things that have been happening in web application
security partly due to Web 2.0, and I think this will be a fun /
interesting talk.

I worked on the my slides over the weekend, but if anyone has any
specific curiosities or questions that fit within the "emerging web
application security trends" topic, please let me know, and I'll do my
best to accommodate.

As a bribe, I'll be bringing a copy or two of Essential PHP Security to
give away:

Hope to see you there. :-)

Nope, that's too much of a reach - no one would get it. (A restaurant
named after a song that contains the lyrics mentioned above.) The
original link is to the song.

Im sure some of the Security 2.0 details apply to the world of Rails  
as well.  I agree a dodgeball match is the works as Id like to attend

OK! Apparently my question was so stupid that nobody could produce an 
answer that low to reach my level. So I do it myself. ;)
My plan is to create a session, authenticate the user, then generate a 
new session ID for the session )I read that this improves security and 
is easy enough to do), write that to a table with a time stamp and upon 
login (who bothers to log out correctly??) check the timestamps against 
now and make a decision if the session is stale and can have its temp 
folder ditched. That way I keep track of 'my' sessions rather than 
trying to figure out which ones are mine from all the sessions the 
server may have.

Sounds reasonable? Standard practice? OK, maybe, but I'm doing this for 
the first time and try to write and understand the code myself. Copying 
is cheating, reinventing the wheel is so much more fun....for a hobbyist 
like me.

Thanks for not answering and making me think about this a few days. No 
really, that was much better than getting an answer in five minutes.

Message-ID: <983600F2-E14D-48AC-AD03-20315A177177@jonbaer.com>

Hadn't seen this on the list before (sorry if report) but recently  
needed a mailer with Gmail TLS support to interact with Google Apps  
and came across this nice library as an alternative to PHPMailer:

http://www.swiftmailer.org

-snip-
The current list of features includes:

     * Send uses one single connection to the SMTP server or MTA
     * Doesn't rely on mail()
     * Custom Headers
     * Multiple encoding options
     * Unlimited redundant connections (can use mixed types too)
     * Connection rotating/load balancing
     * TLS Support - for Gmail servers
     * Embedded Images or other file types
     * Builds and sends Multipart messages
     * Sends single-part emails as usual
     * Extremely flexible message customization when sending to a  
list (via plugin)
     * Fast Cc and Bcc handling
     * Unicode UTF-8 support, with auto-detection
     * Handles denied recipients in batch mailing whilst still  
delivering to the others
     * Smart runtime caching (in small, self-maintained packets)
     * Send attachments of ANY size even with PHP's 8MB Memory Limit
     * Optional auto-detection of SMTP or Sendmail settings
     * Batch emailing with multiple To's or without
     * Send to hundreds of thousands of addresses without cron
     * Support for multiple attachments
     * Protection against header injection
     * Set message priority
     * Request Read Receipts
     * Sendmail (or other binary) support
     * Pluggable SMTP Authentication (LOGIN, PLAIN, MD5-CRAM, POP  
Before SMTP)
     * Anti-Flooding support (reconnect every X emails) via plugin
     * Throttling support to limit bandwidth/resources used
     * Bandwidth tracking and monitoring via plugin
     * Secure Socket Layer connections (SSL)
     * Loadable plugin support with event handling features

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [Announce] Andromeda on Windows
Message-ID: <462DF167.9050802@secdat.com>

Andromeda is an application framework written in PHP.

We have been working lately to have it running on Windows.  With 
feedback from users we have identified and removed the largest glitches 
and now are able to use Andromeda on Windows for regular Andromeda 
development.

The features that we have tabled for now involve source and version 
control, so a person using Andromeda on Windows today would have to 
manually copy files from a dev machine to a production machine.

Andromeda makes use of Postgres (not mySQL), but you don't have to know 
much about Postgres, the install of Postgres runs pretty smooth in our 
experience, and it is not known to interfere with mySQL (any feedback on 
that would be welcome).

We have a special page just for installing on Windows:

Hi all,

Looks like I'll be driving in to the city for the meeting tonight.   
I'm planning on coming in early and am looking for a place where I  
can sit down and get some work done with my laptop.

Any suggestions, like an internet cafe or something?
Necessary - being able to plug in to a power outlet
Optional, but definitely helpful - internet access (preferably free)

Thanks!

Aaron,

There's a cool little place just west of Washington Square park (just 
north of W 3rd Street, two blocks west of the square, I think) called 
"Tea Spot" that has free wifi and decent drinks. It can occasionally be 
pretty busy, but there are ample power-hookups (there's a basement 
downstairs where you can work in addition to the entrance).

We have all of that... but we charge per amp of power usage (kidding)

You're welcome to come down to our offices - 55 Broad street.  Give me an
offline email and I'll get you my cell.

Since its warm outside, you might prefer to sit in a park. Most of the 
parks in the city have had free WiFi for a few years now...

See nycwireless.net for info and node maps.

Hi all,

Looks like I'll be driving in to the city for the meeting

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Update a table using AJAX
Message-ID: <1b3d2fde0704242210x606ad162u7b2d9eee10a0f3b7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I have a html form with action to paypal's site. When submitting the page, I
need to update the table with the form values( USING AJAX) .

To do this I write the following code.

<script>

/* Call this function on the onClick of the submit button */

function check_form_values()
{
    /* Inside this function I check wether the USER enters the details */

    ajaxFunction();

    /*  IT WORKS PERFECTLY IF WE UNCOMMENT THIS ALERT PAGE  */
}



function ajaxFunction()
{

append_url =
'contact_info.php?contact_id='+document.form1.user_id.value+'&contact_name='+document.form1.contact_name.value+'&position='+document.form1.position.value+'&email='+document.form1.email.value+'&telephone='+document.form1.telephone.value+'&mobile='+document.form1.mobile.value+'&company='+document.form1.company.value+'&address='+document.form1.address.value;

  var xmlHttp;
  try
    {
    // Firefox, Opera 8.0+, Safari
    xmlHttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
    }
  catch (e)
    {
    // Internet Explorer
    try
      {
      xmlHttp=new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
      }
    catch (e)
      {
      try
        {
        xmlHttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
        }
      catch (e)
        {
        alert("Your browser does not support AJAX!");
        return false;
        }
      }
    }
    xmlHttp.onreadystatechange=function()
    {
          if(xmlHttp.readyState==4)
           {
        //response_txt         =    xmlHttp.responseText;

       }
    }
    xmlHttp.open("GET",append_url,true);
    xmlHttp.send(null);

  }

</script>

I am trying to update the table using the contact_id field, I did not return
any values from AJAX action page.

But this code did not work properly.


If I uncomment the alert inside the function "check_form_values()", then
updation will work perfectly.


Can someone help me to fix this problem ?

Hello All,

I am trying to send one mail with HTML content. To do this, I have added HML
header to mail function.

Inside the content, I added a Javascript function that calls a Ajax Page( to
send one mail to my mail address).

I called this Javascript function on the onload of body of html like

<html>

<head>

/* Javscript function and make call to AJAX action page */

</head>

<body onload="return functionname();">

 /*matter*/

</body>
</html>


But it did not work . Can we able to call JavaScript when loading the
content inside the mail ?

Can somebody help me?

I really wonder why? HTML is for port 80, not 21. HTML in emails is IMHO 
the biggest waste ever. Nobody likes it, but almost everybody sends it.
If it is about adding graphics or other non-text content that is 
necessary, create an attachment.
Sorry to sound so harsh, but in fact, not doing HTML emails will likely 
solve your problem.

Check out the documentation for session_set_save_handler -- http:// 
us.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php  This is  
how you can override the way php handles sessions by default and put  
in your own code.  The "gc" function (stands for garbage collection)  
is where the "housekeeping" code goes.  Note that the default php  
session handlers should be cleaning up the expired session temp files  
for you automatically.  The location for these temp files is  
specified by the session.save_path php.ini setting.

As far as regenerating the session id after login, it *is* simple --  
http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.session-regenerate-id.php -- but  
if you're overwriting the default session handler to store sessions  
in a database table, you need to make sure that it's getting updated  
the way you expect.

I'm not sure I can agree, David.  HTML is merely a markup language meant for
improving how information looks and definitely has a place in our most used
means of commication.  We have things such as bold, italics, listings, etc
in all printing apps because how they help us communicate.  Sure, some can
be mocked in plain text but what's so wrong with someone selecting text and
hitting ctrl-b to bold the text and having a standard any email client /
browser will understand.

As for images within, it can easily be misused, but so can ascii art and
bananas in tail pipes.  Just because it's handled poorly and poorly utilized
doesn't mean it should be done away with.

As for Javascript in emails, I'm not sure that email clients will run it,
and if they do, I expect they would block XHR for security risks.  I really
really hope they would.  XHR in emails worries me.  If you're trying to
track emails, consider adding an image and tracking that image's load -
allowing the user the option to turn on their images in most modern clients.
Or even better, give them a link to click and let them choose to be tracked
(if that's what you're using it for).

Chris did an excellent job with the introduction on how to make PHP code more secure.  Love that he used an Ajax example.

I do have a question since I wasn't able to go to the question time at TGIFriday's.

How ever can someone inject their code/script onto my webpage?  The code is on my server so they don't have access to it.  Am I missing something here?

If you allow the user to submit anything that is then displayed our  
your site, they can inject javascript code unless you do a very good  
job "sanitizing" the user input.

And the submission may not just be limited to $_GET and $_POST... many
of the $_SERVER vars can be problematic as well.

The example Chris gave about Google's old 404 page, where it echoed
the requested URI without escaping it first, could have been exploited
by sending the following link to someone. I don't remember the
mechanism exactly, but perhaps something like:

<a href="http://www.google.com/something/not/found/%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27XSS%27%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E">hey
victim, click here</a>

Given that link, if Google were to echo the value of
$_SERVER['SCRIPT_URL'] without escaping, it would inject
<script>alert('XSS');</script> into the page.

That makes sense with database data, but how about "hijacking" the submit button by putting their script on the button/image that sends the login info to a different domain site?

I'm not really looking for a specific how it's done (of course), but more for how ever is it possible if the webpage code is in a secure place?

Thanks for the pointer. I misused the term "temp file". What I do is 
create a folder that has to be unique and therefore is identical with 
the session id. That is not the temp folder that the web server / PHP 
creates when starting a session. I called it temp folder because I dump 
upload files and other stuff in there in order to do all kinds of things 
with it, once done the files are moved to the final resting spot. Since 
all this real client server and stateless stuff doesn't let me know when 
a client just went away, I have to come up with some way of cleaning up 
a bit at some point. When the client goes away right after an upload and 
before initiating the final submission, files may be left in there. 
While some stale folders and files are OK (although not nice), having 
them pile up over time will become a problem. So I need to keep track of 
  the sessions that were generated through my script in order to ditch 
that folder with contents (annoyingly, there seems to be no PHP code 
word that does exactly that) when the session is most likely to be 
expired (24 hours later for example).

Well, my idea is to start the session, do the login and authentication, 
when the user is accepted, regenerate the session id, and then write it 
to the table with a timestamp. I don't see any reason to write the first 
session id to the table, because I throw that one away soon after. I 
really only want to keep the ids because I want to clean up the folders 
that I created.

Sounds like a workable and reliable approach to me...if I'd just had the 
time to finally do it. Working with ZIP files at the moment, which go to 
that session id folder as well. Still haven't really understood how the 
unpacking works and what this new and -> stuff is about, anyhow (OK, I 
read too much Bob Pease).

Thanks for the help,

David

Those font attributes are in printing apps because they are printing 
apps. Email is and always was intended and therefore designed to handle

I think you meant that HTTP is for port 80.  HTML is a markup  
language, not a protocol.  Anyway, you can use HTTP on any port.   
Port 80 is what is webservers conventionally listen to.

HTML in email is difficult mostly because there are so many email  
clients with different ideas of how to implement the HTML DOM.  Think  
about it: not even the two major browsers on the market today can  
agree on this (Firefox, IE).

I agree that it's a waste of time, but sometimes you don't have  
control over whether you have to do something like this or not.

I get newsletters and flyers which have a picture based layouts.
If I turn
off HTML I cannot get a quick look at the page a know anything. 

To me this is a case where HTML mail is desirable and

way too much

updates...that
worries me.

Those font attributes are in printing apps because they are

handle 
flat ASCII.

I think you need to think about your temp folder idea some more. You
say that you are going to keep temp uploads and other things there
that get destroyed after the user logs out. But if you are
regenerating the user's session ID multiple times you will need to
keep the temp folder in sync with that.

I always think about the way online banks do it when I approach this
problem. They put a META refresh or perhaps a setTimeout() on the page
and force a page reload. If the request came from the refresh, then
you know the user isn't paying attention anymore and can dump the
session.

I think you're missing the point - if you dont sanitize user input and 
then use it (maybe you re-display a form with an error message), then they 
could put JavaScript code into your page.

This has nothing to do with how secure your server is because your code is 
NOT changed...

Thanks for the kind feedback, Susan. I appreciate it.

> How ever can someone inject their code/script onto my webpage?
> The code is on my server so they don't have access to it.

This is possibly a topic that I need to give more attention in the talk,
and I appreciate the constructive criticism.

I don't spend much time demonstrating what mistakes you might make to
allow such things to happen, but in most cases, not doing what I suggest
for remediation is all that's required. In other words, doing nothing is
usually enough of a mistake.

For example, here's a simple example that's likely vulnerable to XSS:

<?php

$html = array();
$html['user'] = htmlentities($_GET['user']);

echo "<p>Welcome back, {$html['user']}.</p>";

?>

If the Content-Type header does not indicate ISO-8859-1 as the character
encoding (which htmlentities() uses by default), an attacker can provide
a UTF-7 encoded payload as the value of $_GET['user'].

Of course, a more obvious mistake is this:

<?php

echo "<p>Welcome back, {$_GET['user']}.</p>";

?>

Hope that helps.

Chris

For clarification, Google's mistake wasn't that they forgot to escape
the value. (Sorry if I seemed to be making that assertion.)

Rather, they didn't indicate the character encoding in the Content-Type
header, and they escaped the value assuming UTF-8.

Now they send this:

Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

Note: This is a longer response. I do not write concisely and probably 
will never do. If you are short of time, go on to the next message. 
Also, please keep in mind that I'm a hobbyist who learned PHP from a few 
books, trying things out, and lurking on this list. I never learned 
programming and in fact, I really hate it - with the exception of PHP. 
Stuff is so much easier and more logical in PHP than with Java or C. PHP 
is more like Commodore Basic V2 on the C64, something that is simple 
enough so that I can comprehend it.


Adrian, thank you for your comments. I think I need to explain better 
what I do and I really regret using the term "temp folder" in my 
original post. That folder that I am talking about is not the folder 
that the server creates somewhere for storing the session data. I am 
working on an app that allows me to upload pictures (and later flash 
video) straight from my digital camera into a database supported system. 
The database keeps track of where the picture is stored, the date and 
time it was recorded, the name and description (one for each supported 
language), and ten categories and the location where the picture was 
taken (call it meta tags if you want) per picture and supported 
language. I also store if the picture needs to be rotated on the fly, 
who added it, when it was added, which user level is allowed to view it, 
how often the picture was viewed, when and who viewed it last, and some 
other stuff. Data such as date and time of the shot come from the exif 
header.
I provide a simple browse box for individual uploads. Since I cannot 
control what gets uploaded, I have to accept the upload, then check if 
it is a jpeg or gif. I try to do this by figuring out what the file 
really is rather than to rely simply on the file extension. Once I 
deemed an upload to be a picture file in a supported format, I display 
it in a preview and allow for the entry of the name, description, 
categories, location. For all this checking and previewing I copy the 
file from the location where $_FILE put it into a folder. And THAT 
folder is the one that I create using the session id so that I can 
handle multiple uploads at the same time and not have them cross their 
paths. Once a picture is named and categorized it is written to the 
final storage location, which is a set of folders based on year and 
month. I don't want to rename picture files ever, but it can be that the 
PDRM0692.JPG from 2004 is not the same as the PDRM0692.JPG from 2007. If 
I throw it all into one big folder I will get collision at some point, 
latest after making 10.000 shots with my camera, likely earlier. Also, 
it is much easier to locate pictures in that setting without using the 
system.
While holding the file in the session id named folder and before final 
submission several things can happen. The client can just go away, the 
user can decide not to add the picture (hence the preview from a 
momentary storage location before adding it to the final set of files), 
or other things that leave that session id named folder with content on 
the system. I also allow now uploading of zip archives either directly 
or from an ftp/http accessible location. That way I can stuff several 
dozen (hundred?) files in one go into the system and tag them with some 
bogus name and location (I decided to use ~~~~~~~~), filter the table on 
that, and worry about the correct name and description later. I also 
need this session id named folder for that purpose and things may happen 
(power loss of the server for example, this is the US after all) that 
leave now a considerable amount of gunk behind.
Now I get back to the original question, how can I degunk these folders? 
I need to know which sessions are still likely to be active and which 
ones are not. That all has nothing to do with the temp folder that the 
web server creates somewhere for holding the session data. I have no 
idea where that temp folder is and if I'd now what happens when I just 
dump some files in it (such as the extracted files from the zip 
archive). I really like to know where the files and folders are and thus 
create/copy/move them on my own.

OK, I could use the user ID as well for my folders, but then I'd need to 
guess when the user logged out. Of course, I have a logout function and 
I track last login date and time (maybe even logout, don't remember), 
but I can't expect anyone to use the logout function religiously. People 
just don't do that, they simply kill the browser. With a session id 
based folder for whatever I need to do before final commission I can be 
very sure that after the maximum lifetime of the session and a generous 
grace period that folder with contents is stale and can go. But how to 
know when that session was started?
My first idea was to ask the server which sessions are currently active 
and then ditch all the folders that have session ids as name from 
sessions that are not active. But there seems to be no way for asking 
the server which sessions are currently active. I then decided to simply 
write the session id and a time stamp to a table. And while I am working 
on session tracking, I might as well throw in that extra line to 
generate a new session ID after authentication and before writing it to 
my session tracking table, assuming that this increases security a bit.

I have no idea what banks do and I hope they do a better job than I. I 
do not claim to have designed the most reliable, secure, and optimized 
system. But I can follow its flow and explain what happens where and why 
(and I still can after not working on this project for almost six 
months). And above all, it just works. I am especially amazed how easy 
it was to get the zip stuff working. That is the real power of PHP. You 
want to do gnurf then there is probably a PHP command gnurf() for it. I 
love it! So many people are so much smarter than I am, but I can still 
make use of their ingenuity and unzip uploaded files, read out exif 
headers, and rotate an image on the fly, write a whole bunch of stuff to 
some database, and much more. Uh, and I love PHP's session handling, it 
is so nice to drop stuff into the session and have it available anywhere 
I go rather than to use tons of hidden inputs and post it all over the 
place.

OK, back to work. :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Copying file from HTTP/FTP using copy()
Message-ID: <463330C1.3020404@gmx.net>

Hi!

Here is what I like to do:
Get a user entry (text string) that is either an HTTP or FTP url to a 
file, for example
http://my.server.gov/download this.zip
or
ftp://username:password at your.server.gov/download that.zip
and then use the copy() function to download it and store it locally on 
my server.

This is the piece of my code that is supposed to do the copying:

if ($nourl == FALSE) {
   // Make local zip file path and name
   $localzipfile = sessiondir.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.$sessionid.".zip";
   // urlencode url
   $urlupload = urlencode($urlupload);
   // Copy file
   if(!copy($urlupload, $localzipfile)) $nourl = TRUE;
}
   // Check if error occured
   if($nourl == TRUE) {
   errmessage("OUCH - Downloading the file from ".$urlupload.
              " to temporary storage failed! Try again!");
}

$nourl is an error flag, $localzipfile is the path and name of the local 
file (directory exists, I created it earlier), $urlupload is the 
submission from the user (file on my own web server, if I put the url in 
a browser, the download works), errmessage is a function that displays a 
nice  error message and some buttons to go back.
The PHP manual claims that copy() handles the same wrappers that fopen 
supports. Unfortunately, the response from copy() is either 'worked' or 
'did not work', not much to go by.

The questions of the day:
Why does copy($urlupload, $localzipfile) fail?
Is copy() even the right command to use?

I found a piece of code here
http://sandalian.com/11/php/copy-remote-file-into-local-directory.htm
but I wonder if that works for binary files as well.

As usual, any help is greatly appreciated.

David

You would probably be better off using the libcurl commands ...

http://us.php.net/curl

As getinfo is one of the better options to get stats on the transfer  
in question ...

Thank you for this hint. I really is the far better way for downloading 
files via HTTP/FTP. I had some problems first with setting the right 
options, but managed to get this straightened out for allowing redirects 
and binary downloads.
And once again I'm sitting here in front of a few lines of PHP code and 
can't believe how awesome this is! Now that I got the download portion 
done, I will go on for getting the stats.

This is so kewl!

Thanks again,


David

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Casting string "false" to boolean
Message-ID: <46349D06.7020807@gmail.com>

Hey!

I'd like to cast a string "false" to a boolean.
So I tried the following:

<?php
$var = (bool)"false";
var_dump ($var);
?>
Here var_dump gives me:
bool(true)

I also tried using settype:

<?php
$var = "false";
settype ($var, "bool");
var_dump ($var);
?>

The same result here:
bool(true);

So is there a way to cast such a string to a boolean (without using 
conditions)?

Cheers,
Jay

The string "false" will evaluate to true, any way you slice it. The  
only strings that evaluate to false are "" and "0".

http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.boolean.php

I suppose you could eval the string... But you should think hard  
before doing this. I can't image a justification for it. If you're  
getting input for a false value as "false" you should really use some  
kind of conditional statement.

Wow.
No offense, but this sounds like a case of "All I have is a hammer, and
everything looks like a nail".

In a page taken from the ADODB manual: (
http://phplens.com/lens/adodb/docs-adodb.htm#cacheflush)

If you want to flush all cached recordsets manually, execute the following
> PHP code (works only under Unix):
>   system("rm -f `find ".$ADODB_CACHE_DIR." -name adodb_*.cache`");

I use a slightly different line in my crontab:
@daily find /path/to/tmp/files -mtime +1 -exec rm -rf {} \;

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Subscription Billing and Querying account status
Message-ID: <00c701c78b31$7b872020$0200a8c0@gamebox>

Hello, 

I'm using paypal to take CC payments from clients.

One of our products, is subscription based, and I need to be able to 
check if the client has paid for the month. And if not, I'd like to suspend
access.

Can this be done w/paypal.

If not, what type of E-Commerce or Merchant account allows that?

Currently, I just have a link directly to paypal, and once they pay, I create the account.

I'd like to automate this process, be able to query the account status, and even
send out reoccuring billing/invoices.

Any ideas/experiances?

Thanks!

- Ben

Are you talking about automatic monthly renewals, or cases where a

I haven't done the first, but I have done the second.  We do it the 
other way around from what you are describing.  When a person 
subscribes, we send them to paypal for payment.  When the paypal success 
call comes through, we mark them subscribed to whatever issues they have 
paid for.  From there we don't have to ask paypal, we just query our own 
database on each resource access attempt.

Sign up @ developer.paypal.com and do a search for IPN or Instant  
Payment Notification

Essentially from what I remember anytime payment is made (via normal  
purchase or subscription) your server is pinged.  The idea is then to  
calculate on your own if $user has made a payment for $month/$year, etc.

That's the whole Payapl IPN system.  Download their demo code and dig 
through it and ask questions here. 

In a nutshell, when you send somebody to paypal, you populate this array 
and call some code the provide to you, which redirects the user to Paypal.

Once the user pays, Paypal makes a POST to your server that contains all 
of the  information on the payment.  You have to be able to process this 
unseen, as the user doesn't know its happening, and you can't watch it.  
My code logs these events with lots of detail at each step so I can 
always see what happened on every payment.

Then, when the user is done, they are sent back to your site, and you 
need a page for that too, the "Thanks for ordering, we're all done" page.

Paypal recurring payments/subscriptions combined with IPN works well,
( https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/xcl/rec/subscr-intro-outside )
The only downside to using the paypal subscriptions is when you need to 
modify the amount to be charged (upgrades? downgrades?) It is a real 
pain. To do that, most people just cancel their existing subscription 
and sign up with the new plan.

You could also obtain a regular merchant account and use a processor 
like authorize.net
The break even point between authorize.net and Paypal is somewhere 
around 150 transactions at an average of $20/transaction per month. 
Above that, paypal becomes more expensive.

That's a good one! Yes, I think that my approaches are often not what 
one would call "smart", "effective", or "to the book" - but in the end 
they work reliably. I have no professional training as a developer, I 
tried VB, C, Java, Pascal, and several other programming languages and 
IMHO they are all way to complicated for me. OK, I can make something 
happen in VB6, but that's old. PHP is different, maybe because I learned 
it on my own and nobody told me from the start what I have to do to 
prevent going to hell. Some things just have to bite me in the behind a 
few times before I understand what someone would have told me all along 
(comments in source code, initialization of variables, proper naming 
conventions, RTFM, etc.). Still, I'm a hobbyist and do this for fun, a 
few hours per week.

Ah, now I see. Well, that would be one option, but one that wouldn't be 
part of my script and thus not portable that easily. It for sure would 
be faster and not burden the clients. I rather have me remove the mess I 
make than rely on some 3rd party to do the cleanup. I plan on adding 
configurable system settings at some point and may make this optional. 
Someone who doesn't like this can turn it off and do it on their own.

Thanks for the tip.

Yeah... like this:

$string = 'false';
$bool = ($string != 'false');
var_dump($bool);

I believe Adrian was showing how ADODB uses a Unix command to clean  
up it's files and saying that you could also use a Unix command.  I'm  
not sure I would call it "3rd party" if you're always using a unix- 
based server.  Of course, it wouldn't be portable to Windows.

At any rate, you can use PHP's filesystem functions to go through  
your directories and figure out the last time they were changed via  
filemtime(): http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.filemtime.php

On a side note, if you use custom session save_handlers like I  
mentioned before, then you can know which sessions are active.  I use  
custom save_handlers to store all of my sessions in a database rather  
than in temp files.  Then I can just query the database to find  
active sessions.  The only downside is I'm not sure what libraries/ 
classes there are for storing sessions in a database that are easy to  
use and up to date.  As I'm sure Chris' recent presentation showed  
(unfortunately I had to miss it... audio recording?), there are many  
ways for sessions to be compromised.

Anyone know of a good, up-to-date, database session library?  I  
originally used DB_eSession, but it hasn't been updated since 2004  
and my version has been very customized and patched over the years.   
I think I'm happy with it, but would like to review some other code  
if there are other options out there.

Thanks,
Rob

Not only that, anyone using my script would need to make sure that the 
cleanup task is present. Not everyone runs their own web server at home, 
although with Apachefriend's XAMPP and DynDNS I can't think of any 
reason why not...OK, I can, but the point is that many may want to run 
this on their web space that the ISP gives them.

All I need to know is the age of the folder with all the files in it. 
The manual doesn't explicitly state if filemtime works on directories as 
well. I then could get all directories and check for their timestamp 
rather than hitting the database a few times for this. And it will save 
me from making yet another table. I will try this out.

I first planned on writing the session id and a timestamp to a db table 
and use that, but what I need to do hasn't anything to do with the 
session per s?. So, if filemtime works for dirs as well (and works on 
Windope) then I am much closer to something smarter. I then have a 
screwdriver and a hammer. ;)

Great, this discussion really helps me a lot. I went from no clue over 
complicated and bloated to something that is potentially done in half a 
dozen of lines without the need of tables and queries and such.

It's funny, half of my scripts come from NYPHP and the other half is 
just commentary. Nah, have to give myself some credit, I figured the zip 
stuff out on my own. That is quite an accomplishment for someone who 
still thinks that arrays are just wicked awesome. And it is still like 
magic that this stuff really works.

Thanks to everyone who pushed my nose in a better direction.

Someone else already did:
To get the last modification time of a directory, you can use this:
$getLastModDir = filemtime("/path/to/directory/.");
Take note on the last dot which is needed to see the directory as a file 
and to actually get a last modification date of it.
This comes in handy when you want just one 'last updated' message on the 
frontpage of your website and still taking all files of your website 
into account.

Looks as if I'm all set. :)
