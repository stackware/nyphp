Subject: [nycphp-talk] Fedex Server Telnet
Message-ID: <CAGVtho6nRodRyHm8gWTTa2JOSaskZJgqo4T_Z5HC2HU7Nn_shQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to write a PHP front end for the Fedex Server which uses telnet
to send/receive shipping data.  I am hoping that someone has already done
this and can tell me how to send/receive this telnet data in PHP as I am
having some trouble with it.  The string of data is made up of numeric
'options' and a quoted value pairs.

String data format:
Send:  0,"020"1,"119999"4,"Jon Doe"....  ,"01"99,""
Recv:  0,"120"1,"119999"10,"232593318"...  ,"00"99,""

The strings always start with 0,  and end with  99,""

Any suggestions welcome.  Many thanks.

Nick

Hi Nick.

I needed to do something similar to this. I wrote a shell script to telnet
to (I think it was a Linksys) router to obtain it's IP address.

# cat getip.sh
  (
    sleep 3
    echo "USERNAME"
    sleep 1
    echo "PASSWORD"
    sleep 1
    echo "ifconfig clink0"
    sleep 1
    echo "exit"
   ) | telnet 192.168.1.1 2>/dev/null | grep netmask | awk ' { print $1 } '
| sed 's/ip=//g' | sed 's/,//g'

The above shell script does a login using telnet to the router, enters a
command, parses the output and returns the IP address.You could write a
shell script like the above, and call it with exec() in PHP to get the
output and parse it.

Does the Fedex Server have anything else available to interface with this
data such as REST or SOAP so it could return XML format data to you?

Why not open a connection using PHP sockets?

Hi,

Thanks for the help with the telnet issue!  I am now trying to save text to
a file that is going to be placed on a different server.  I planned to use
shell_exec in PHP but cannot seem to get it to work:

shell_exec('echo testdata > file.txt');   - this doesn't work   but
shell_exec('ls > file.txt');    -does work

trying to get  shell_exec('echo '.$str.' > file.txt');   and ultimately:
shell_exec('ssh root at 172.20.8.20 "echo '.$str.' > file.txt" ');

to work but cannot.  Perhaps there is a syntax or escape character issue?
Any help appreciated.

Thanks.
Nick

If you're going to write to a file and then move it to another server just
use PHP's fwrite() to write the file:

http://php.net/manual/en/function.fwrite.php

Then scp the file to the other server (using stored authentication keys so
your security is somewhat maintained).
