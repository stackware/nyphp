	Problem with $_SESSION, PHP 4.3.2, register_globals off,
	class methods
Message-ID: <40940AB3.6090507@adnet-sys.com>

Very first lines of index.php:

[PHP]
session_start();        // USED FOR ANY STORED SESSION VARIABLES (ONLY 
HAS TO BE SET HERE)
echo "PHPSESSID = $PHPSESSID<P>";
echo "SESSION the moment you first enter this script of $PHP_SELF is: "; 
print_r(array_keys($_SESSION)); echo'<P>';
[/PHP]

This is what you see the moment you first go into index.php and have not 
yet submitted a search query:

[QUOTE]
PHPSESSID = a964d0d6683757cafbe5576737ea5bf9

SESSION the moment you first enter this script of 
/image_catalog/index.php is: Array ( [0] => search [1] => sql )
[/QUOTE]

Ok, now you submitted a search query.  You entered some form stuff and 
submitted.  You're now at the search results page (which is also 
"index.php"); this is what you see:

[QUOTE]
PHPSESSID = a964d0d6683757cafbe5576737ea5bf9

SESSION the moment you first enter this script of 
/image_catalog/index.php is: Array ( [0] => search [1] => sql )

GET: Array ( )

POST: Array ( [0] => image_name [1] => allAlbums [2] => album [3] => 
boolword [4] => keywords [5] => persons [6] => events [7] => image_alt 
[8] => image_creation_start_month [9] => image_creation_start_day [10] 
=> image_creation_start_year [11] => image_creation_end_month [12] => 
image_creation_end_day [13] => image_creation_end_year [14] => 
image_location_city [15] => image_location_state [16] => 
image_location_country [17] => sortBy [18] => search [19] => 
isFromSearch [20] => section )

SESSION: Array ( [0] => search [1] => sql )

PHPSESSID = a964d0d6683757cafbe5576737ea5bf9

SESSION after setting it is: Array ( [0] => search [1] => sql [2] => 
hidden )
[/QUOTE]

(note: to save space and sensitive info I am not doing: 
[PHP]print_r($_POST);[/PHP] but instead I'm using 
[PHP]print_r(array_keys($_POST));[/PHP], and the same with $_GET)

$_SESSION['sql'] is set via an instance of SearchPerformer object that 
runs the generateSearchSQL() method:

[PHP]
class SearchPerformer extends DBActionPerformer {

 function SearchPerformer () {  // CONSTRUCTOR
  $this->doSearch();            // THIS METHOD RUNS generateSearchSQL()
 }

 function &displayResults() {     // STATIC HTML STRING METHOD
  $html  = SearchView::retainFormElements($html);    // SEE BELOW FOR 
CODE DETAIL
  // DO MORE STUFF TO $html
  return $html;
 }

 function generateSearchSQL() {    // SQL STRING METHOD
  // BUILD $sql HERE WITH STUFF
  $_SESSION['sql'] = $sql;
  // DO MORE STUFF
  return $sql;
 }

}

$performer =& new SearchPerformer(); // CONSTRUCTOR
[/PHP]

So everything is fine so far; I have $_SESSION['sql'] and I even have 
$_SESSION['hidden'] which is set via the displayResults() method in the 
SearchPerformer object, it running this class method (class SearchView 
is *NOT* instantiated here!!!):

[PHP]
class SearchView extends View {

     function SearchView() {}    // CONSTRUCTOR (you will be 
instantiating SearchView objects elsewhere, just not in 
SearchPerformer's methods)

     function &retainFormElements(&$html) {                // STATIC 
HTML METHOD
                print_r("<P>GET: "); print_r(array_keys($_GET)); 
print_r("<P>POST: "); print_r(array_keys($_POST));
print_r("<P>SESSION: "); print_r(array_keys($_SESSION)); print_r("<P>");
        if ((!is_array($_POST) || @sizeof(array_values($_POST)) == 0) &&
$_SESSION['hidden']) {
         $html .= $_SESSION['hidden'];
        } else {
        
 /*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Set $collection to either $_POST (if form post variables 
exist in $_POST) or default to $_GET
            to parse through either/or and produce HTML hidden elements 
in either case
        
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
         $collection = ($_POST && is_array($_POST) && 
@sizeof(array_values($_POST)) > 0) ? $_POST : $_GET;
         foreach ($collection as $key => $val) {
          if (!is_array($val)) {
           $hiddenHTMLRetainer .= "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"$key\" 
value=\"$val\">\n";
           $html .= "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"$key\" 
value=\"$val\">\n";    // ADD FROM QS TO PASS BACK
          } else {
           foreach ($val as $innerKey => $indivVal) {
            if ($indivVal) {
             $hiddenHTMLRetainer .= "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"${key}[";
             $html .= "<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"${key}[";
             if (!is_numeric($innerKey)) $html .= $innerKey;    // 
NUMERICAL KEYS DO NOT NEED TO BE PLACED INTO HTML ARRAY-FORMATTABLE FORM 
ELEMENTS
             if (!is_numeric($innerKey)) $hiddenHTMLRetainer .= $innerKey;
             $html .= "]\" value=\"$indivVal\">\n";    // PUT IN 
INDIVIDUAL ARRAY ELEMENTS
             $hiddenHTMLRetainer .= "]\" value=\"$indivVal\">\n";
            }
           }
          }
         }
         $_SESSION['hidden'] = $hiddenHTMLRetainer;
         global $PHPSESSID;
         print_r("PHPSESSID = "); print_r($PHPSESSID); print_r("<P>");
         print_r('SESSION after setting it is: '); 
print_r(array_keys($_SESSION));
        }
        return $html;
    }

}
[/PHP]
Now, in the search results page I click a link to sort my results.  The 
link takes me back to, you guessed it, index.php (in fact, every single 
portion of my application literally has only one address: "index.php" 
and nowhere else).  The moment I do that, this is what I see:

[QUOTE]
PHPSESSID = a964d0d6683757cafbe5576737ea5bf9

SESSION the moment you first enter this script of 
/mu-spin/image_catalog/index.php is: Array ( [0] => search [1] => sql )

GET: Array ( [0] => section [1] => search [2] => isSort [3] => sortBy )

POST: Array ( )

SESSION: Array ( [0] => search [1] => sql )

PHPSESSID = a964d0d6683757cafbe5576737ea5bf9

SESSION after setting it is: Array ( [0] => search [1] => sql [2] => 
hidden )
[/QUOTE]

This is totally wrong!!! The $_SESSION['hidden'] variable is gone!!! It 
is, in fact, erroneously RESET once again (with the wrong values), 
whereas it was supposed to have been retained within $_SESSION 
superglobal array, yet it is not.

I hope this makes it a bit more clear as to what is literally going on.

Synopsis:

1) I go to index.php
2) I see $_SESSION
3) I submit form elements
4) I see $_SESSION
5) I add $_SESSION['sql'] in generateSearchSQL() method
6) I add $_SESSION['hidden'] in SearchView::retainFormElements() method
7) I see $_SESSION with both elements
8) I click a link to go back to index.php
9) I see $_SESSION.. with just 'sql' and NOT 'hidden'
10) I tear my hair out, what little I have left!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] confused by classes
Message-ID: <200405011850.34004.cwf@axlotl.net>

The first program I wrote a couple months ago was (of course) an email program 
and now I feel it's time to try to learn the OOP aspects, so I thought I'd 
rewrite that program. After a few days, I've become utterly confused. I've 
been trying to figure out which question to ask; this one seems to capture 
several of the issues confusing me.

Each user can have several mail servers, and it seemed useful to start once a 
user logged into a session by constructing an object containing server 
addresses and passwords, and then maybe add in methods as needed. So I made 
this class (stripped down):

class mailUser{
? ? ? ? var $user;
function mailUser ($user){
? ? $dsn = 'mysql://username:pass at localhost/db';
? ? $dbh = DB::connect($dsn);
? ? $user = $dbh->quote($user);
? ? $this->user = $dbh->getAssoc("SELECT server, m_user, m_pass, pop, smtp, 
u.name
? ? ? ? FROM servers s, users u, server_pass sp
? ? ? ? WHERE sp.user_id = u.id
? ? ? ? AND sp.server_id = s.id
? ? ? ? AND u.username LIKE $user");
? ? }
}

And then when a user is logged in (returns $user ) I go:
$cur_user = new mailUser($user);

This gives me an object with an array of servers, each of those having an 
array of parameters. But I guess what I really need, maybe, is a class that 
returns 
$this->server
with a few methods (seperate queries?) to extract the parameters specific to 
the currently active server? I'm trying that now, but it's maybe my twelfth 
scheme, and it'd be nice once it fails to pan out to check this list to see 
if anyone has some pointers. 

So, I realize it's a rather broad query; anyone in a pedagogical frame of mind 
today?

Ending my lurking ways,
Chris

Hi List.   A quick question.  I have some categories that are really long
and I would like to re-word or re-format them when I am bring data in from a
DB.  Now which would be better:

Do it with PHP
or
Do it with MySQL

Any suggestions as to how to?

Example:
A column name: Customer --> VARCHAR
Values in Customer: "USA-North Upper ABVDFR Co. and Sons" 

I would like to re-word it for example: ABVDFR Co.

I know I could use SUBSTRING or MID, or replace but the issue is since the
column is a VARCHAR, the length of the value may change from row to row, for
example: one row it maybe 20, in the next 13 and so on so forth.  I also
thought that if I could use a length statement and come up with a
formula...but so far no success....any suggestions?

Thx in Adv.

Assign the return by reference in order to conserve memory, etc:
  ? ? $dbh =& DB::connect($dsn);

quote() is deprecated.  Use quoteSmart().

So, there can be multiple rows of data returned for a given user?  If it's
only one row, use getRow().

Don't you mean "= $user" rather than "LIKE $user"?

Again, do that with "=&" to assign by reference instead of assigning a 
copy.

It's not clear what you're looking for here.

While posting a virus definitely seems to cross an ethical boundary of
some sort, I think an exploit is an essential piece of a security
vulnerability announcement. It really helps developers to both clearly
understand the vulnerability and gauge the danger. However, this is
frequently debated.

Hiya folks.. was juts sitting here wondering if there was a way to make a
jump menu that got its info from a flat file.
This way you can just drop the jump menu into your web pages and have 1 file
( text/php/include) which changes the
jump menu details accross the whole website..

any ideas? and is this even possible.
regards
yury

I use an array contained in a separate for navigation items on some sites.  
The array's key is the name of the file and the value is the text to 
appear in the hyperlink.

Certainly is possible, try something like this...

<?php

function drawNav () {
      // items.txt would look like this:
      // http://ibm.com/|IBM.com
      // http://google.com/|Google
      $lines = file('items.txt');
      $html = '<select onchange="go(this);"></select>';

      foreach ($lines as $line) {
            $items = explode('|', $line);
            $html .= sprintf('<option value="' . $items[0] . '">' .
$items[1] . '</option>');
      }

      echo ($html . '</select>');
}



The JavaScript function in the select tag is:

/**
 * Jumps to the selected item in the dropdown list .
 */
function go (dropdown) {
             location.href =
dropdown.options[dropdown.selectedIndex].value;
}

See http://nyphp.org/content/presentations/bikesummer/navigation.php
and the frame after it as well.

The example doesn't show the foreach loop used to extract the data from
the array and print out the stuff, but here's a summary:

foreach ($Nav1 as $Page => $Title) {
   echo '<a href="' . $Page . '/' . $Page . '.php">' . $Title . "</a>\n";
}

Sorry, Monday morning.  My example should have looked like this:


<?php

function drawNav () {
      // items.txt would look like this:
      // http://ibm.com/|IBM.com
      // http://google.com/|Google
      $lines = file('items.txt');
      $html = '<select onchange="go(this);">';

      foreach ($lines as $line) {
            $items = explode('|', $line);
            $html .= sprintf('<option value="%s">%s</option>', $items[0],
$items[1]);
      }

      echo ($html . '</select>');
}

Of course, don't forget to embed that in a <form> element for those who 
have JavaScript turned off.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] regexp for URLs (is this correct?)
Message-ID: <40968FD8.6090109@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I came up with this Perl-style regular expression to validate URLs.

For example, if I want to match "http://www.google.com"
then I would test it against the following pattern:

#^([a-z]{3,}://)(([0-9a-z-]+\.)+[0-9a-z]{2,4})$#i

maybe I want to do something like this though:

#^([a-z]{3,5}://)(([0-9a-z-]+\.)+[0-9a-z]{2,4})$#i

so that
http://www.google.com

and
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org

and
https://www.amazon.com

are matched

but
httpsabc://www.somewhere.com

is not matched.

I primarily want to validate http:// links, though.

Another thought: I want to be flexible and allow the user to enter 
something like:

www.google.com

Should I first try to match against:
#^([a-z]{3,5}://)(([0-9a-z-]+\.)+[0-9a-z]{2,4})$#i

and then, if that fails against:
#^(([0-9a-z-]+\.)+[0-9a-z]{2,4})$#i

I also realize that something like
http://www.google.com/

will not be matched.

Any suggestions or corrections?

Thanks in advance!

Best Regards,

- Jay

A Perl expert of some repute did the hard work of reading all the
relevant protocol specs, BNF notation, etc., and came up with this
valid URL parsing regexp.  Anything shorter is likely to miss some
special case.

This is an article about how to do this:
http://www.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/url2.html
(Note that there were some judgement calls involved in interpretation
of some of the edge cases.)

This is the URL for the actual regexp:
http://www.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/url3.regex

This is the regexp (note that it is broken up into many lines but 
actually needs to be
one long line; note also that it does not support https):

(?:http://(?:(?:(?:(?:(?:[a-zA-Z\d](?:(?:[a-zA-Z\d]|-)*[a-zA-Z\d])?)\.

I would think to simply support "https" all you would have to do is 
change "http://" to ((?:https)|(?:http://...))

Then again, it's pretty beastly as it is!  If that's not a call for a 
global included variable, what is?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Training at New York PHP
Message-ID: <W102164574124911083610614@webmail4>

Tim,

In the next week or two, I will be launching a new PHP training
portal web site. The site should be an excellent medium to
promote PHP training courses. The site is still under dev BUT
should be ready in a week or two. I'll send an email once the
site launches.

I trust Jeff Friedl's regex. He wrote "Mastering Regular Expressions"
for O'Reilly and works at Yahoo!

http://www.regex.info/listing.cgi?ps=208

Also, FWIW, it's often faster and easier to write two regular
expressions to check a string than trying to cram everything into one
hugegantic regex.

You end up spending more time working on the regex than you ever save
during the course of the total run time of the program. OTOH, it's
fun. :)

...

His is a little out of date.  He's missing some of the new TLD's e.g. 
.museum.
For example, check out this cool URL (as the Netscape mailto default
subject used to say):
http://musedoma.museum/musedoma.html

There's a .name, and .coop, and .aero, and others, too.

OTOH, I didn't check if the URL that ate Toledo handled the new TLD's
either.

That's probably true, but it's easy to tack on new TLDs.

Most regexen just check that the TLD is something like [a-zA-Z]{2,}

I know this is sort of a copout but once, when I had this situation and
had the resources to kill -- importing thousand rows from a text file to
MySQL and sanity-checking a ton of things in the process -- I said the
hell with it, let's just try to access the resource that the URL points
to. No response means URL no good, well-formedness notwithstanding.

 if ($handle = @fopen ($url, "r"))

True, a site could be down temporarily. Call it the
one-strike-and-you're-out rule.

Jay,
I've played with this one a lot and I've got a regex that I'm using.   
It has one bug that I know about, maybe someone on this list can  
suggest a fix:

$regx =  
"^((http|https|ftp)\:\/\/[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,5}(:[a-zA-Z0 
-9]*)?\/?([a-zA-Z0-9\-\._\?\,\'\/\\\+&%\$#\=~])*)$";

The bug is domain names with a hyphen fail.  So, www.big-boots.com  
would fail, where www.bigboots.com passes.

You're over escaping things.  Items in [] don't need to be escaped, and to
search for "-" itself, put it at the beginning or the end, [a-zA-Z0-9.-],
so it doesn't think you're creating another range.

Also, I don't think ":" needs escaping and you can change your delimiter
from "/" to some other character that's unused in the expression so you
don't have to do "\/" over and over.

... snip, the polite thing to do ...

I'm glad I don't have to debug that.

I like the idea (sorry, I deleted the original post) of checking with
fopen.  Perhaps create a DB table with a column for last good result
from fopen.  If that column reaches a threshold, chuck the URL.

What I'm looking for is an answer to a general design question. I see three 
vaguely defined ways of doing this.
 Should I make the functions generic, and customize the sql in the script 
(that is, write a specific query and pass that and an array of parameters for 
each specific need, reusing a very generic DB connect/query function)?

$res = ("SELECT $sql, $data")

 Or is it better to code a catch all query in the function, and return a bunch 
of methods like this (my most recent brainstorm):

$res = ("SELECT w, x, y, y, z
              FROM [...])

Returns an array, or:

$this->one = $res[0];
$this->two = $res[1];
$this->three = $res[2];
...etc...

Or, lastly, is it best to make a bunch of rather specific functions with 
queries hard coded in them, but which are only returning tightly restricted 
datasets:
function a(){
$res = ("SELECT w FROM x");
return $res;}

function b(){
$res = ("SELECT y FROM z");
return $res;}

I guess I'm asking if I should be working with some general principle 
governing in which direction I should be pushing complexity. Towards the 
functions, or towards the scripts? Or should I just go away and run my head 
into a wall until I've learned enough to come back and ask more coherent 
questions (a reasonable answer, I would have to admit)?

Message-ID: <4096FB1B.8010905@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

thanks for the excellent pointers regarding URL validation.
I think that since I am only validating http:// and https:// URLs for 
now, the really (30 - 50 line) long one would be too much to incorporate 
for this job ...

But I just realized some things that were wrong with my previous regular 
expressions (those matching 'http://www.google.com' and 'www.google.com' 
respectively):

a) I could check for a optional slash at the end by using something like:
/?

b) In both cases, input such as the following would fail:
http://www.google.com/something/something.html

OR
www.google.com/something/something.html

With a bit of experimenting (I really need to upload my interactive 
Perl-regex tester script to my public scripts area), I came up with the 
following:

/*
Should match:
http://www.google.com/something/something.html
http://www.google.com/something/something
http://www.google.com/something/something/
http://www.google.com/
http://www.google.com
*/
#^(([a-z]{3,5})://)(([0-9a-z-]+\.)+[0-9a-z]{2,6})((/[0-9a-z-]*)+?/?([0-9a-z-.]*)+?)$#i

and
/*
Should match:
www.google.com/something/something.html
www.google.com/something/something
www.google.com/something/something/
www.google.com/
www.google.com
*/

#^(([0-9a-z-]+\.)+[0-9a-z]{2,6})((/[0-9a-z-]*)+?/?([0-9a-z-.]*)+?)$#i

It is getting close to my bed time now, so I am not sure how correct 
these are. I will do some more testing tomorrow. If, however, they do 
work, they might be of use to others.

If anyone finds anything wrong with them, please let me know.

Best Regards,
- Jay

PS: I changed my regexps to allow 6 letter domains ( .museum ) after 
reading some responses today. The [0-9a-z]{2,6} part, that is.
PPS: I will be using these expressions to mostly evaluate newly 
submitted URLs via a text input box. The other regexps that I posted 
recently were for batch validation (and transformation / import) of lots 
of invalid MySQL data. Thanks for the fopen() tip, David.

The education dept. at New York PHP will be 
awarding at least one partial scholarship to 
the upcoming two day training session 
scheduled for May 17-18.

The criteria used to select recipients of the
scholarships will be based primarily on (but 
not limited to) the following factors:

a) past participation on the mailing lists 
   as well as contributions to general meetings 
   at NYPHP

b) willingness to contribute and help others
   (can be demonstrated by participation in 
    groups other that NYPHP)

c) a brief write-up from the applicant 
   stating how the granting of a scholarship 
   to him or her will make a beneficial impact 
   (for the individual as well as the open source 
    community at large in terms of widening the 
    understanding PHP, MySQL, and Apache tools)

The scholarships are to be for fifty (50) percent 
of the full tuition price, presently $780

Please address questions and responses to:

Message-ID: <C92A8F8B60F96B42911EFA70AF30A88F060A46EC@msp7-msx1.ingenix.com>

Hi list.  Admittedly a very silly and basic question:

I need to pass data vector to a variable that could be later used to plot a
graph.  I am able to -finally!- get the data in an array format...and it
looks like this:

Array ( [0] => 59 [1] => 72 [2] => 45 ) 
Array ( [0] => 118 [1] => 77 [2] => 107)

But apparently I am not passing this data correctly.  My code is as follows:
[code]
<?php
....
while ($row=mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { 
  $time['time'] =( $row['time']);
  $prio['priority'] = ($row['Priority']); 
  $valu['total'] =( $row['total']); 
//creating arrays
if(!is_array($plot[$prio['priority']]))
	{
        $plot[$prio['priority']] = array();
    	}	
	array_push($plot[$prio['priority']], $valu['total']);
}
// Assigning values
$g0=$plot[''];
$g1=$plot['1 - Started within one hour'];
$g2=$plot['2 - Started within four hours'];
$g3=$plot['3 - Started within 24 hours'];
$g4=$plot['4 - As soon as possible'];
// Printing those values
{
 print_r($g0);
echo "<br>";
 print_r($g1);
echo "<br>";
 print_r($g2);
echo "<br>";
 print_r($g3);
echo "<br>";
 print_r($g4);
}
?>
[/code]

Q1. Should I not use associative array?
Q2. How can I pass the data points in the var $g0-$g4 so the data vector is
passed?

I am signed up for some formal class in PHP in June-04, but I have to figure
this out before that, and plz. trust me when I say that this basic level of
headache is really embarassing, and yes, I have been reading and reading and
...

Hi there:

I'm primarily an OS X user, but I have an XP box that I am testing on.

I've got a client who is using a tool I created to manage all the 
content on their site.  It includes file upload capability, and some 
of their files were getting mangled somehow in the upload process.

It looks like the browser they are using (Windows 98, IE 5, or IE 6 
on Windows 2000) is chopping the file name and inserting an ellipsis 
character.  This seems really stupid to me, since the ellipsis 
character is not part of the valid ASCII set.  Anyway, they have 
files whose names are getting changed to something like:

ABU_REP_70_2004_04_01_Certificate_for_FSC_web_page_tradema....pdf

which translates to:

ABU_REP_70_2004_04_01_Certificate_for_FSC_web_page_tradema%E2%80%A6.pdf

Therefore, browsers can't find the file, even though it is uploaded 
to the proper location.

She sent me a file that she can't upload, which is called:

FSC_STD_20_001_General_requirements_for_FSC_certification_bodies_V1_0.PDF

Obviously, this file name is long -- maybe even obnoxiously long -- 
but it's only 73 characters.

My problem is...I have tried and tried, and I can't NOT get this file 
to upload properly, on either my Mac or my XP box.

Is there some file length restriction in Internet Explorer for 
Windows 98 or 2000?  Is there something else causing these files to 
end up with phantom ellipses?

Just hoping someone has encountered this before.

I would tell him to check that apache is set up properly.  Make sure 
that his httpd.conf file has this line:
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
If apache isn't told to pass the file to PHP it will just spit it out as 
is and the users browser will ignore any tags (<?php ?>) it doesn't 
recognize.

Message-ID: <4098F45A.9010406@adnet-sys.com>

I'm curious as to how I should handle this, other than the obvious H*LL NO:

A guy posted a request for bids for a project whereby he needs an entire 
file management application system, complete with ability to handle 
streaming audio/video uploads and downloads, search engine, advanced 
search engine, "Top Ten" videos, a "My" personalization feature, and at 
least 12 - 13 other major applications.

Total time to develop ALL of this: 15 days
Max bid: $20

Hey if anything I gave you all the laugh of the day! :)

A lot of time people who do that are looking for pre-built opensource
scripts to be installed.
$20 to upload a file and ungzip/untar a file and change a couple things
is not to bad for people.. in particular people overseas.
I run a small job bid site and see those a lot.

$20 for even just an upload and configuration is absurd.   Even so, 15 days
max says that s/he's looking for some customization.  I don't even know of
overseas groups that would do 15 days of work for $20.  Besides that, bid
for work sites have the silliest pricing I've ever scene (nothing against
you or your site personally, joel).

Well, while staying in India, my daily rent for a GREAT apartment was 
about .50 cents a day (Rishikesh). Assume living in NYC your rent is 
$30 per day. So it's about 1/60 the cost. Thats why the odds are this 
vendor may actually get someone for $20 for this project. And why I'd 
HIGHLY recommend to any up and coming USA based programmer  to learn 
welding. plumbing, or carpentry as a sideline, or at least Java2ME.

Usually the "lower-bidders" i.e. $1 for a portal site + graphics.
are just trying to get into talks with the buyer, they then try to bring
them up to more realistic terms.

But, I have seen russian programmers do a ton of work for very little,
however the quality is usually kind of low as they will take on a
multitude of jobs.

Job bidding is a strange deal.
Poke around on http://listbid.com/ which is my board. and you will see.
I make a good bit each month just in referrals from this site.

$30!!.. haha, I wish.. Not sure where you are getting your numbers for
NY rentals.
try about $61 on a 30 day month for this loft in Chelsea. I chose to
live in Manhattan though, if I lived in Brooklyn I could get something
similar for much much less.. NY is one of the most expensive places to
live. I think San Francisco 'might' actually be more but they have a lot
of vacancies there and the market got bombed after 2000.

According to CNN/Money, the Great City of New York is not only America's 
most expensive city, it's #11 in the world.

And if you think New York is something, it's like INDIA.. compared to 
Oslo, Norway!!!!

Give you an idea:

McDonald's Happy Meal:

DC: $5
NYC: $6
Oslo: $12.50

For that matter, you could try becoming a wholesale heroin and/or cocaine
distributor here in New York City. Judging from the numbers of people I
see undertaking that career, there must be fabulous opportunities.

Hi all, this is kind of strange it seems to do with timing but...

I am using our CMS which will regenerate images as needed... So I
publish, all images get regenerated with new ones, but my browsers keep
seeing the old images for a few minutes.

- we know that the images changed in the directories, we can see that
- we have cleared the browsers cache
- further we go with a computer that has never seen the page and still
sees old images

Environment: PHP 4... On IIS, using Smarty templates. And don't ask why
IIS, please!!!

We also have a script that runs within the publish that access the Linux
server to create the images with fonts. We thought it could have been
that but we see the images in the directories right away, no delay.

WHO THE HELL IS CACHING my images? This is driving me nuts.

Any one had a similar issue?


Thanks,
Carlos

Sounds to me like you have a proxy somewhere between your boxen...some 
ISPs run transparent proxies which could cause this behaviour...

All the servers are in-house. There is a 3Com switch and a hub between
the servers and us. I wonder if it could be the switch then.

Message-ID: <012a01c432dc$e8ad1e30$e98d3818@oberon1>


when I run msqld_safe &

it says:
"Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /usr/local/mysql/data 040505
15:57:51  mysqld ended" 

jobs says: "jobs

[2]-  Done                    ./bin/mysqld_safe

the last lines of the error log say:
040505 15:54:51  mysqld started
040505 15:54:51  Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already
in use 040505 15:54:51  Do you already have another mysqld server running
on port: 3306 ? 040505 15:54:51  Aborting

so I edited my.cnf 

to have 
#port		= 3308
#socket		= /tmp/mysql.sock

in both sections [client] and [mysqld]

and reran the safe start script 
exactly the same results

I haven't change any permissions on any 
directories anywhere (intentionally).

I am starting to think that the error logging 
is mis-reporting the stuff about the port being used.



Any advice would be appreciated

Subject: [nycphp-talk] has anyone ever used "exif_thumbnail()" PHP 4.3+?
Message-ID: <40994BEC.3070402@adnet-sys.com>

PHP 4.3.2 with --enable-exif

I have the following class:

[CODE]
<?php

class ThumbGenerator extends MethodGeneratorForActionPerformer {
 
  function ThumbGenerator() {      // CONSTRUCTOR
    // DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF HERE
  }

  /**
   * This method can only be used if you are using PHP version 4.3+ and 
if you have TIFF or JPEG image
   *
   * @access private
   */
  function generateTIFFJPEGThumb() {                            // VOID 
METHOD
        global $section, $thumbLocationPath;
        
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Because of the different methodologies of each method, the 
constructor must be called, thus, the class object
            must be initiated.  If "$this" does not exist, trigger an error
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
        if (!$this || !is_object($this)) trigger_error('You must first 
instantiate a ThumbGenerator object to use this method', E_USER_ERROR);

        // STREAM FILE EMBEDDED THUMBNAIL CONTENTS INTO BINARY STRING 
VARIABLE
        if ($this->isSuccessful) {
         $thumbStreamObj = exif_thumbnail($this->locationPath . '/' . 
$this->fileName, $width, $height, $mimeTypeInt);
         print_r('<P>thumbStreamObj: '); print_r($thumbStreamObj);
         if (!$thumbStreamObj) {
          $this->isSuccessful = false;
          $this->setErrorArray(array('section' => 'Could not extract 
embedded thumbnail contents from "' . $this->locationPath . '/' . 
$this->fileName . '"'));
         }
        }

    }

}

?>
[/CODE]

The class is being used to literally generate a thumbnail from an 
existing image.  I read in the PHP manual (see 
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.exif-thumbnail.php ) that 
exif_thumbnail() only extracts embedded thumbnail information from a 
TIFF or JPEG
image.  In knowing that I've simplified my method to only handle TIFF or 
JPEG images (this is done in the class constructor - sorting out what 
image type you got).

At this point, however, I am receiving nothing into the $thumbStreamObj 
binary stream string variable; it's "empty" (false):

[CODE]$thumbstreamObj = exif_thumbnail($this->locationPath . '/' . 
$this->fileName, $width, $height, $mimeTypeInt);[/CODE]

I checked the values of $this->fileName and $this->locationPath and both 
contain the correct values to be able to locate the image in the system 
for the function to extract the embedded thumbnail information 
reportedly found in TIFF and JPEG images.

Has anyone had any luck using this to create a thumbnail?  I could use 
some more experted advice than I would think to find in the manual 
notes, which I am certain I'll find among you gurus here.

Thanx
Phil

Message-ID: <002301c432de$16a8b460$8b01a8c0@DB>

Howdy folks,

I'm working on generating a file on the fly by sending headers and echoing
out the content of the file. The trouble is that the php script that does
this makes a database query to retrieve the content, and it seems to cause
problems. Merely echoing out the string if content itself works fine. In
short, the process looks like this:

1. database is queried to retrieve the content based on some variables
passed to the page
2. content is built from the query
3. http headers are sent
4. finally the content is echoed out

for your curiosity, the headers are the following:

header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="file.m3u"');
header('Expires: 0');
header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0');
header('Pragma: public');

Now, what's interesting is that when the query to the db is limited (eg. "
LIMIT 30") to 30 or less results, it works. Any more, and it doesn't.

My first line of thought is that the connection is dying too quickly

I'm interested in trying out the 'connection: Keep-Alive' header to see if
it does anything, but I'm also thinking that a 'content-length' header might
be interesting. And that is why I am asking about measuring the file size of
a string. content-length expects units in octets (bits / 8).

Is there a way to measure the file size of a string?

Or even better, can anyone illuminate what might be happening?

Thanks,

Eric Rank

It looks like MySQL is already running.  What's the output of the 
following command (assuming your OS has sockstat)

   sockstat -4 | grep -E (mysql|3306)

and/or

   ps | grep mysql

Thank for the idea -- I think I am just going to have to

I am tires of playing 'wheel of fortune' trying to

There is your answer, it will *only* work on an image which has an 
*embedded* thumbnail, which is not many images.

You need to look at the GD or NetPBM or ImageMagick functions for 
resizing images if you want to be able to reliably create thumbnails.

Your images almost definitely *do not* contain embedded thumbnails.

Hmm, not likely to be the switch, sounds like it might be put down to

You can embed thumbnails?!  How cool is that?  Any idea if gd, imageMagick
or netpbm can utilize such things?  Would be equally sweet if browsers
couple access such things.  

Ah well. 

Time for a Mexican dinner and a few shots of tequila (El Cantinero on 11th
and University if anyone's interested)

Happy Cinco De Mayo!

Thanks for the help Jon,

I think I jumped the gun a little bit on this one. Another guy I work with
was testing this thing, and it didn't work for him, but it works on all
other computers I've tried. But that itself doesn't mean the php is right
yet.

Thanks

Eric

Ok, facing both "fully customizable solution" and "manual resizing", I 
am using the GD library to do so, what would you do in this scenario, 
would you just come up with an arbitrary size (e.g., 115) and factor the 
new image size to that, somehow recalculating height and width and 
presto, new image?

Yes, there are quite a lot of projects out there that do this already, 
it's not too complicated.

That should get you started, failing that there is plenty on google.

I've also done this myself (from scratch)... not that hard.

Got it 60% completed.  I kept the original method in case the image is 
JPEG/TIFF with embedded thumbnail info inside, otherwise, it'll default 
to generateGenericThumb() method which makes a size-proportioned 
thumbnail (right now at 120 width).  Thanx!

Now I can go celebrate Cinco do Mayo.. Pero yo no soy mexicano, pero, 
por que no?!

Yeah, my digital camera does it (and I imagine others do as well).
It's all EXIF information - date taken, image size, etc., is all in
the EXIF record.

be shutting down:

"Webmonkey, the site that turned humble Web developers 
into attention-grabbing authors, said last weekit is closing

Well, it's bad enough that this buyer is not only willing to only pay 
$20 for 15 day-only work of an entire file management/streaming content 
management application/display application..

He doesn't want it in PHP because "I'm not happy with PHP at all, maybe 
it was bad coding, but I want ASP"

*sigh*

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Dumb Pear Question
Message-ID: <200405071509.IAA06620@earth.he.net>

Hey Folks,

I have what is probably a dumb Pear question.  I have been from the PHPLib camp for quite a while now, and am now moving over to using Pear in my development.

In PHPLib, there is a Table class, which takes a dataset and builds the table for you.  I've extended that class over the years to include search, sortable columns, callback functions, pagination and a few other goodies.

I'm looking for the equivalent in Pear.  I just tried DB_Table, and was disappointed when I got through the tutorial and discovered that I was left holding the query result and was expected to handle the display myself - I'm too lazy for that! :-)

I'm now looking at DB_Pager, but it is old (2002), and DB_DataObject, but I don't think these do this either.  I have the "form" stuff handled with HTML_Quickform, but can't seem to locate anything that does what I am looking for recordsets.

Any ideas or experience with this?  Perhaps someone out there has extended one of these Pear modules and would like to share?

Thanks,

Tom

How 'bout PEAR::HTML_Table?

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.html.html-table.php

Or maybe Pager?

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.html.pager.php

Or maybe even Pager_Sliding?

I am looking to get an ODBC connection working between linux and a DB2
database on an IBM AS400.  Ultimately, I need this to work with PHP.
According to the IBM website, this involves installing and configuring
unixODBC and I am hoping someone has some experience with this.  Any
input would be appreciated.  Thanks.

	workaround?
Message-ID: <409C0D0D.6040408@adnet-sys.com>

re: http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.imagegif.php

I have one class method that resizes images, including GIF images, and 
works just fine doing so, even up to this line:

[PHP]
eval('image' . $extArray[$type] . '($newImage, "$tmpImageDownloadDir/" . 
$this->fileName);');         // SAVE TO TEMPORARY IMAGE DIR FOR DOWNLOAD
[/PHP]

(yes even with.. EVAL!)

However, in another class method, THIS line produces the following error:

[Quote]
Fatal error: Call to undefined function: imagegif() in 
/www/html/mu-spin/image_catalog/include/classes.inc.php(2262) : eval()'d 
code on line 1
[/Quote]

The line:

[PHP]
eval('image' . $extArray[$type] . '($newImage, 
"$this->thumbLocationPath/$this->fileName", $thumbDimensionInt);');
[/PHP]

I've taken out the reference to $thumbDimensionInt, to no avail.  Same 
exact error every time, but ONLY for GIF images.

But why is it the nearly-identical line in one class method resizes GIF 
images, but the near very same line in another class method (creates 
thumbnails) bombs for GIF images?

Both work just fine for all other images (i.e., JPG, TIFF, PNG, SWF, 
BMP, etc.)

Thanx
Phil

Did you read the manual page you linked to?  GIF is not supported by all 
version of GD, and I'd be willing to bet yours doesn't support it, hence 
no imagegif function.

Also, using eval like that is just nasty, you should really be doing 
something more like the example code found on that page and at 
http://www.php.net/imagetypes

That is quite disgusting.  I hope that all PHP developers snub their

This is probably a silly answer, but:

-- but if possible, do it in the DB.
-- otherwise, select all records from the DB, process in PHP, and reload
the DB.  Don't forget to lock the database if concurrency is a concern.

Sometimes string manipulation is too complex for any database.  But, if
possible, do the process in the DB with a function or two.  If things
get too sticky, then a real programming language like PHP is in order.

I've always done this by compiling from source, but maybe:

would help?  Maybe even a:

make deinstall

first, then a make install from the ports.

This would make a very interesting article in the upcoming AMPeers.

I've run PHP daemons for some time (we're talking several weeks) without
any indication of memory leaks.  In fact, I even coded a timer in to
email me stats of the process so that I could keep an eye on it.  At the
end of a couple weeks, I brought the process down normally, and all
seemed good.

In fact, I'm looking to deploy another daemon in PHP.  This one will
accept considerable network traffic from a remote sensor (using FUID I
believe it will be) and then manipulate an inline Apache PHP via MySQL
for web page generation (yeah, it's crazy; it's an art project).

Well ,I'm definitely interested, but nowhere near well schooled enough on
the subject.  I've been reading quite a bit on it lately (thanks mostly to
all the input I've received from a bunch of you).  I have posix on my
server, but unfortunately not pcntl.  I can probably request it, but I
figure I should set up something local for such a thing before putting it on
my remote server.

Indeed something can always go wrong.

Good error handling should take a page 
out of basic journalism's playbook.

when something goes wrong you want to 
know the five W's --

Who, What, Where, When, and How.

Roughly speaking there are three Where's:

Hardware     (e.g. disk full)
OS or system (e.g. a process never gets
environment   scheduled for some reason -- 
              that is, it doesn't seem to 
              be running for lack of a 
              'time slice')
Software      (this includes utility software 
               like a compiler generating 
               some sort of 'wrong stuff' and
               the developers' logic flaws in
               the application software)

Basically the Who's are determine by what 
mode the code is running in. For example:
kernel mode, user mode etc.

The what's are generally governed by the 
Where's. For instance in unix-like operating 
systems events may be signaled. On a specific 
CPU the hardware may 'trap' to a vector 
interrupt when you try to divide by zero.

In application software (or frameworks as well) 
there will quite likely be a list of possible 
exceptions.

When's are not only the time according to 
the system clock, but also the order in 
which things have happened like a misbehaving 
routine was called just after calling some 
other routine (generally you can get this 
type of information from some sort of 
stack trace).

Putting all the W's together show help 
to come up with an answer for the big 'W' -- 
WHY did something go wrong?

In trying to answer the big W you sometimes
can find yourself sounding like a member on 
a congressional investigation committee.
Saying to yourself things like:
"What did this routine know -- and when did 
he know it".

So after performing the 'investigation' you 
determine the extent of criminal behavior 
(misdemeanor, felony, etc) -- if any 
criminal behavior exists.

Once you've determined how bad the behavior is, 
you can let your error handler 'fit the crime'.

(this is in response to: "What types of errors can 
be safely ignored, and which ones should be trapped 
by an error handler")

Can you narrow this down in the context of PHP programming?
Not everything may be relevant (or maybe it is?) in the context of 
building/programming a website.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Best alternative to imagegif()?
Message-ID: <409F876B.8090906@adnet-sys.com>

My application has no problem doing image resizing to any other type of 
image, except, obviously for GIF images, since imagegif() is not [yet] 
fully supported by GD (based on what I read at 
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=0p6l909ujs8bdqjtu4r9j6asn8tjqel3rv%404ax.com 
and plenty of weekend personal experience in hair-tearing-out).

What would be the experts' best suggestion for an alternative to 
imagegif(), bearing in mind that everything else works thus far.

Thanx
Phil

I guess I was jumping ahead a bit in 
thinking it might be nice to develop an 
error handling class structure in the article 
to show how error handling decisions might be 
implemented.

The granddaddy class would be rather 
abstract. It would have member variables 
correlating to the five W's.

The 'abstract' class would be extended to 
take care of more specific situations.

But in general all the descendant classes would have 
inherited methods for dealing with felonies, 
misdemeanors, and ethical infractions and 
perhaps a method for granting immunity (especially 
on a 'quid pro quo' basis for more information 
leading to an indictment of other guilty routines)
The methods would be just overloaded -- whoops, 
pardon me, I mean extended to deal with the specifics 
of each of the more specialized classes 
(and their environments).

Maybe there could be classes for Linux, Windows, 
HP-UX, BSD, etc. directly inheriting from 
the base class. And an Apache class and maybe a an 
IIS class. 

Towards the end of the line you might have 
a PHP error class and an Application error class.

Something like this:

Err_class
  Err_Linux
    Err_Apache
      Err_PHP
        Err_App_Framework
          Err_demo (the class in the article)

You could make a simplified framework (really 
just for demonstrating the ideas in the article)
and extend the framework class to handle 
things that can go wrong with some mini-app.
(again the mini-app using the Err_demo class) 
would exist mainly to demonstrate the ideas in the article -- 
but might indicate how you could do something useful)

This kind of article would be a major departure 
from most articles that often include 
comments in the code saying something like
//  handle exceptions here... 

Further, regular readers of PHundamentals 
could become familiar with the (admittedly over 
simplified) (PHundamental ?) error handling framework.

And you could put in some realistic (and concrete)
error handling code snippets to indicate things that 
might go wrong (as a danger signs for potential problems) 
in future article example code using the error framework 
that readers have gotten accustomed to -- rather than
vague comments which remind readers that 
'Something can always go wrong'.

This comes from a technique (questioning 
routines for 'what they knew and when they 
knew it') which I have been using informally 
for quite some time now.

I call it the 'Senate Hearing Investigative 
Technique'.

When things break, I sometimes have to 
go through a whole lot of 'S.H.I.T.'
to fix them.

No discussion is complete without mentioning PHP's native error and
logging functions (http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.errorfunc.php),
especially set_error_handler(), error_reporting(), trigger_error()

No discussion is complete without mentioning PEAR_Error which offers a lot
of flexible and convenient means of error handling
(http://pear.php.net/manual/en/core.pear.pear-error.php)

One of the criticims of languages that don't have real exception handling
(try/catch/finally) is that checking the return value of every call gets
tedious and hard to read. One of the things I like about Pear is that you
can set an error handling callback function, and then go ahead and run a
few lines of e.g. database stuff without bothering line-by-line.

Another point that bears mentioning -- since this is a Fundies thread --
is whether and how much error output to display it the browser in
development versus production, from the security standpoint as well as
style. Development:  verbose and informative. Production: apologetic and
vague.

Perhaps it also bears mentioning by way of Fundies that if you have error
reporting on and warnings on, you can still supress error output on a
per-function-call basis by prepending an @ to the function name.


I would (and could) elaborate on all of the above but I just wanted to get
a shot in before someone else beat me to it (-:

If you need to ensure records are unique, use primary and/or unique 
indexes on the columns in question.  Doing this gets the database to 
automatically reject duplicates for you.

That, plus using IGNORE ("insert IGNORE into table_b(field1,field2) ...")
will have MySQL insert all non-duplicate records without choking on the
dupes.

Try something like this:

INSERT INTO table_b (field1, field2)
(SELECT table_a.field1, table_a.field2
  FROM table_a
   LEFT JOIN table_b
    ON (table_a.field1 = table_b.field1
        AND
        table_a.field2 = table_b.field2)
  WHERE table_b.field1 IS NULL
   AND table_b.field2 IS NULL)

I would try the select first to make sure that it will get you 
everything in table_a that isn't already in table_b.  And then if you 
like the results from that add the insert part to the begining.

Putting PEAR aside for the moment, how should someone use those three 
PHP functions? For example, if someone uses trigger_error(), then what?

Speaking of php's inherent error functions, has anyone ever tried building a
try/catch/throw sytem of sorts using php's current error handling?  I've
personally never run across one.

You could have a look at some of the code in cowiki.

The class.RuntimeContext.php has something that might interest 
you around the function putToCache.

Why would you do that when PHP 5 supports try/catch/throw? Seems
easier to upgrade to PHP 5. :)

While that would stop records already in table_b from being copied from
table_a, it would not stop duplicate records in table_a going into
table_b.  You could throw in a GROUP BY clause to take care of that.

All that aside, adding primary/unique keys is the way to go.

If tables already have duplicates but aren't keyed, like the original
poster said, then you've got to mysqldump the data, drop the old table,
change the table structure in the dumpped SQL data to add the indexes
needed and then rebuild/import the table/data.  Use the -f command line 
option that keeps SQL errors from stopping execution.

Well that will definitely help *here, but I figure if I want to start moving
in that general direction, I'll want to overall, including on client servers
which will probably run 4.3 for at least few more months.

Very interesting, I'll definitely take a look.

You can probably replicate some functionality of exceptions in PHP
4.3, but it'll very coarse grained. For instance, if all you want to
do is bail out to an error handling section, then you can do that.

However, I doubt you can replicate more subtle features, like
exception bubbling.

Oddly enough, this is the last chapter standing between me and book
writing freedom. We're involved in a stare down over how to best order
the material. :)

The pear port is never installed so that won't work.

It is also a problem in FreeBSD to install from Ports the mod_php and php
CLI ports at the same time. I think this is why Pear may be failing.

I am rebuilding my play box after a HD crash and I will experiment more
thene. Amongst the options I am considering so far is to install the CLI
on the play/test box and then make a tar of the files an copy them over to
the production box. Then manually change php.ini and anything else...

Although most likely my first option will be trying to install Pear by
manually and see if that is not too much work.

I think it's much simpler; usually, over-abstraction is a bad thing.
The original PHundamentals seed was this:

"Something can always go wrong in an application so it is essential that

your application have an error handler. What types of errors can be=20
safely ignored, and which ones should be trapped by an error handler?=20
What is the best way to handle those errors?"

I think the always important distinction of development vs production is
again vital when talking about error handling.

The first rule of error handling, in my view is to be alerted of ALL
errors, notices, warnings, etc.  As such, in php.ini I always have:

error_reporting  =3D  E_ALL

or if I can't modify my php.ini:

error_reporting(E_ALL);

is set in the top level include of my application.  I do this for both
dev and production environments (it's often more important in dev).  I
also ensure display_errors is off and log_errors is on.  This is all
automatically set correctly if you use php.ini-recommended

By default, with log_errors set to on, errors go to the Apache error
logs.  So:

tail -f /var/log/www/mydomain.com/error_log

(or whatever the path obviously)

will show all signs of errors, as they happen, without splashing errors
to the browser.  Even in development, errors dumped to the browser are
bad because they can become hidden in the HTML.

So, the big question; what is safe to ignore?  Basically, nothing.  I
always code so that I never have any warnings about uninitialized
variables, which is a common error (actually, notice) to ignore.  I
admit, there are times - like when repopulating form values on small
sites - when I will suppress an uninitialized variable using a @ if I'm
sure a NULL or 0 value will be handled correctly.  It's good practice to
not throw any "sloppy" errors in your application, and under any states
of the page; this is "PHundamentally" good programming.

So what about "non-sloppy" errors; or those errors caused by an
exceptional or unexpected condition?  For one, there are two sides to
this; what the user (browser) sees, and what the maintainer (developer)
sees.  Always - *always* - show a generic error to the user.  If the
database is offline, don't say "Our database is currently offline" but
rather "System under maintenance".  If the system is about to crash and
PHP's core has become horribly corrupted:  "System under maintenance"

This does two things.  One, it makes it harder for crackers to fiddle
with your application - they never really know what they're doing or
what affect it has.  Two, it makes error handling much simpler and
eliminates complex class abstractions and hierarchies.

In most cases, these bits of code is what I use:

set_error_handler('myhandler');

if( $majorproblem ) {
   trigger_error('This is a major problem',E_USER_ERROR);
}

Then, the myhandler() function could look like:

function myhandler( $message,$code ) {
   mail('siteadmin at domain.com','MAJOR PROBLEM
at'.time(),trigger_dump($GLOBALS));
   error_log('MAJOR PROBLEM at '.time().trigger_dump($GLOBALS));
   go2('/error.php');
   exit;
}


I know that code won't really work and is horribly sloppy; if anyone
wants real code, let me know.  go2() is part of the this_server PCOM
(http://pcomd.net/this_server) to handler redirections and
trigger_dump() is the PCOM at http://pcomd.net/trigger_dump as a wrapper
for dumping variables.

While many are probably shocked by the no-frills approach to this error
handling scheme, it's all I've never needed.  It's very "un-enterprise"
I know.  Look at it this way, when something goes wrong:

-- you need to know the state of the application; trigger_dump($GLOBALS)
-- you need to know when it happened; time()
-- you need to know that it happened; mail()
-- you need to have a record of the above three items; error_log()
-- you need to prevent the user from knowing any of this, except that it
happened; go2()

I'm also curious as to other's approach.  Granted, in PHP 5 we'll have
exceptions - which are a great thing - but doesn't really change that
much.  Exceptions are for *detecting* errors, no handling after the
fact.  I'm curious as to other's thoughts.

Hi:

Have you ever noticed that when someone is sloppy in one place, they're
probably sloppy in loads of others?  Well, this seems to hold true when it
comes to the people responsible for buggy code.  When reading the SF
newsletter I need to determine if the reported package uses PHP.  Many of
the websites of the software in question don't say right up front which
language the application is written in or even what their pacakge does.
Oy.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] re: Wiki anti-spam CAPTCHA patch: $_SESSION conflict
Message-ID: <40A18E1F.8050300@ceruleansky.com>

Hi Hans,

thanks for the followup on my previous session-conflict thread.

I think what was happening was that on Windows my session files could be 
renamed / overwritten, but on a (shared) Linux server that did not work. 
I might be wrong about this though ...

Also, a good topic for a Phundamentals article might be incorporating 
anti-spam measures (such as Captcha code generators) into web 
applications / scripts (e.g. Wikis, blog comment forms, email-this-page 
forms, etc).

Best Regards,

- Jay

Subject: [nycphp-talk] NEW PHundamentals Question - Error Handling
Message-ID: <40A19607.2060203@ceruleansky.com>

Hi all,

Here is what I did recently for error handling within a (PHP 4) class. 
(This was for a redesign of a class that was originally written out of 
the need to collect 10 - 20 separate functions, all having resided in 
different files.)

By the name, the naming scheme I use for class names and methods 
(functions) is unconventional - all lower case.

This class's functionality has been fictionalized for your (and my) 
enjoyment.

I am not sure if the way I do it is good or bad, but you can definitely 
let me know what you think.

class appreciate_life

{
var $bitterness; // on a scale of 0 to 10
var $sweetness; // on a scale of 0 to 10
var $satisfaction; // how satisfied you are

var $harddrivehealth; // on a scale of 0 to 10
var $freshairintake;  // on a scale of 0 to 10

var $oopsies = array(); // errors
var $oopsies4devs = array(); // debug messages

// constructor
function  appreciate_life($bitterness, $sweetness, $harddrivehealth, 
$freshairintake)
{
$this->bitterness = $bitterness;
$this->sweetness = $sweetness;
$this->harddrivehealth = $harddrivehealth;
$this->freshairintake = $freshairintake;
}

function measure_life_satisfaction()
{
	if ($harddrivehealth < 0 || $freshairintake < 0)
	{
		$this->oopsies['warning_get_out_more'] = "Your hard 		drive just went 
kaput or you have been staring at that computer screen too long. Forget 
the computer and go to the Japanese pond at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.";
		$this->oopsies4devs['take_user_on_walk'] = "This user needs to be 
taken on a walk.";
	}	

	else if ( $this->sweetness > $this->bitterness )
	{
		return "<p>Bravo! You are one happy (wo)man! </p>";
	}

	else
	{
                 return "<p>Life sure sucks, huh? If life is a lemon, 
maybe you can make some lemonade from it ... </p>";
	}
}

function is_okay()
{
	if ( count($this->oopsies) > 0 || count($this->oopsies4devs) > 0)
	{
		return false;
	}
	else
	{
		return true;
	}
}

function print_error_messages()
{
	/* retrieve contents of $this->oopsies array and format them for display */
}

function print_debug_messages()
{
/* retrieve contents of $this->oopsies4devs array and format them for 
display */
}

}

/*
Instantiation
*/
$debug = 0;

$life = new appreciate_life(5, 6, -1, -10);

$sat_level = $life->measure_life_satisfaction();
echo $sat_level;

if ( ! $life->is_okay() )
{
	if ( ! empty($debug) )
	{
		$life->print_debug_messages();
	}

	$life->print_error_messages();
}

/*
End
*/

I don't know if that made much sense at all - but I am way past my 
bedtime, so that is why I am a bit  ... delirious.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] reporting hosting fraud (off-topic)
Message-ID: <40A197F2.3040702@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

This is a bit of an off-topic question, but I did not know where else to 
ask.

To make a long story short, it seems that an individual or group of 
individuals is responsible for setting up a series of hosting companies 
under fake names and then prompting over charging customers before going 
under.

I have been in contact with at least one defrauded customer who has lost 
data and money, and heard from many more at webhostingtalk.com.

I have written about the matter on my weblog:

http://www.moztips.com/index.php?id=229

To which authority (FBI, BBB) should I report this case of suspected 
fraud? Should I also report it also to the press?

Thanks in advance.

- Jay

Just for laughs I had to include the details of the 15-day $20 project:

Dear Bidders,

1. The new website needs to be coded preferably in asp. All pages need
to be linked to one another.

2. I need an internet radio for the website so that when a member
chooses a genre of music, media player will automatically open and start
to play that specific genre of music, but only the music of our members
that will be played by random. We will have further discussion on this.

3. A rating system where members will be able to rate other members.

4. Another rating system where members will be able to vote for their
favorite members and whomever gets the most votes in their genre will be
placed on our top 10 list.

5. There will be a calender for each member that they will have access
to and will be able to add and delete messeges on their calender.

6. There will be a mail system on our website that will only be
internal.

7. Information on how our members will be able to have their own address
from our website, meaning if a members username was 'meme', that member
could give the following address to someone so they may visit her on our
site:

[withheld so I wouldn't get sued]

8. There will also be a statistics page for every member, the statistics
page is for them to see how many people will view them often.

I think I have mentioned everything. If you haven't bid, I suggest you
bid now so that I may make my decision.

Thank you.

it looks as though your example is more concerned with evaluating user
input than error handling per se. In other words for purposes of this
discussion we need to distinguish between user input validation/evaluation
on one hand, and server-side error conditions on the other

$.02.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] How do I use readfile() and redirect at the same time?
Message-ID: <40A26E60.5090206@adnet-sys.com>

[PHP]
class DownloadGenerator {
 
  var $fullFilePath;

  function DownloadGenerator($fullFilePath) {
   $this->fullFilePath = $fullFilePath;
  }

  function &generateForceDownloadHeaders($fullFilePath = '') {        
    // STATIC VOID METHOD
        $file = ($this->fullFilePath) ? $this->fullFilePath : $fullFilePath;
        if (if_file($file)) {
         $filesize = @filesize($file);
              header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$file");
              header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');
             header('Content-Type: application/force-download');
             header('Content-Type: application/download');
             header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary');
             header('Pragma: no-cache');
             header('Expires: 0');
             @set_time_limit(600);
             readfile($file);
        }
    }

}
[/PHP]

I am trying to "have my cake and eat it too", so to speak.  I want to do 
a forced download of a file using readfile() and manipulating the 
headers; but at the exact same time I need to redirect to another page, 
the page that says "hey everything is cool" success message and display 
the rest of the application.

Right now what it does is that it does force a download (in Mozilla) but 
your window is blank.  The user has no ability to navigate any further 
and is forced to close and re-open their browser and start all over 
again, definitely not an option.

How can I use readfile() to force a download of a file, yet at the same 
time display a screen indicating the rest of the application?

The idea I thought up (that obviously fails) was this:
[PHP]
  foreach ($_REQUEST as $key => $val) if (!isset(${$key})) ${$key} = 
$val;        // RETRIEVE ALL PASSED VARS
   
    if ($forceDownload) {                                                
    // HANDLE FORCED DOWNLOAD
     $dlGen =& new DownloadGenerator($fullFilePath);
     $dlGen->generateForceDownloadHeaders();
     echo "<a href=\"index.php" . $dlGen->generateQueryString() . 
"\">Continue</a>\n";
     $dlGen = null;
    }
[/PHP]

This resulting from 
[Quote]index.php?forceDownload=1&fullFilePath=/tmp/images/blah.jpg[/Quote]

Thanx
Phil

Last night, Hendry came up with three key ingredients to a successful 
conference that were woefully absent in Amsterdam:

1) Endless coffee
2) Good wireless (with enterprise bandwidth)
3) Abundant power outlets

There should also be a mechanism (CMS? secretary?) for getting 
presentation slides and additional material onto the conference website 
in real time.

Passively listening to speakers can be a chore (especially without 
caffeine!) -- but if you can code examples on your laptop, do research, 
run demos, and communicate with your peers at the same time, you become 
an active participant.

I wish you luck! FBI requires that the victim has at least $5,000 on
losses before they can make it a Federal case. I know that if you get
the right person this can be put aside. But from experience, it will not
be easy.

You may want to talk to the Trade Commission and Commerce Commission in
Washington.

Also try to find out where this person is and contact the local PD for
information about the person. 

But most of all, you need to find VICTIMS of this person to allow the
FBI to build a case.

Hi all, any of you have any good experience in creating and running PHP
programs as a standalone applications? I think it can be done with the
Zend Suite, but any other applications out there?

Thanks,
Carlos

Message-ID: <C924AC7A-A510-11D8-8E28-0003930D07F2@email.smith.edu>

Hi all,

I would like to set up php locally on my laptop.  Currently on 
PHundamentals I only see mention of local setups for Windows or Linux.  
I googled the archives and found a thread where it appears that the 
setup offered on entropy is a good way to go:
http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/

I'd like to get this going on my powerbook.  Would folks recommend this 
as the best way to go for a OS X powerbook setup or are there 
alternative methods that may be more desirable?

Thanks,

-Aaron

I've been working with classes that are executed both within webpages 
and as cron jobs (cli).  For this, I am pretty happy with PHP as a 
scripting language, especially when coupled with a database that 
supports stored procedures and triggers (like PostgreSQL).

As for pure application programming though, I try to do most everything 
in python.  I stay away from GUI applications, as that is not really my 
forte, so no experience working with phpGTK.

(looks up from desk)

So what is everyone else around here doing in this regard?

You know that PHP is installed and ready to go by default on OSX, right?
Turn on the webserver in the sharing control panel and you're set.

It's installed as a shared object, too, so you can compile a newer / 
custom version if necessary. Just pick up the configure line from 
phpinfo(); and use that to configure a custom version from source.

Groovadelic.  I'm not much of a mac person, but I never knew that -- I 
was all set to say what Mitch said (fink) when I read your response and 
tried it.


To be completely pedantic, it wasn't "quite" ready to go.  On my panther 
(osX 10.3) machine, I had to go into /etc/httpd.conf and uncomment these 
two lines:

#LoadModule php4_module        libexec/httpd/libphp4.so
#AddModule mod_php4.c


After restarting the Personal Web Sharing service, it is indeed all set.

	thanks for this,

Note, however, that the default PEAR installation that comes with 
Panther is broken. From a terminal prompt, do:

curl http://go-pear.org | sudo php

to install PEAR properly.

I started Personal Web Sharing and successfully received the Apache 
start up page.  However, after running phpinfo(); at it from the 
"Sites" folder, it doesn't appear to be running php by default.  I 
searched my hard drive for "httpd.conf" and came up with no results.

I'm running Panther as well, can you give me a little more detail where 
I can find the httpd.conf file?

Thanks,

Welcome to command line unix. :-)

Aotearoa:~ csnyder$ which find
/usr/bin/find

You didn't turn up httpd.conf because the FreeBSD filesystem is loosely 
off-limits to Finder, one of the few barriers remaining to the 
unix-ification of the Mac desktop.

BTW, I hear that the NYCBUG list is a good place to discuss the 
ins-and-outs of OSX as a server. There are also some excellent O'Reilly 
texts on the subject.

Sorry if this seems too obvious, but you didn't happen to get AppleCare 
for it, did you?  If so, that's probably covered.

I have never had to bring my Mac in (yet), but the place I would 
probably feel most comfortable would be an Apple store, unless I had 
some good recommendations to use someone else.

Avoid CompUSA Apple, they promised us it'd be back in a week and when we 
went there over a week later it'd not even gone out.

There's an apple store in NYC, I think. One in the King of Prussia (PA) 
mall.

I'm in mid-Joisey and this person has been highly recommended:

I run PHP CLI on a regular basis.  This is usually by use of cronjobs.
Basically, as a data mining method, PHP CLI scripts pull and process
over 400K rows from Oracle, cooks them into about 100K rows and inserts
into MySQL.  There are about 5 such scripts running on a regular basis
and run perfectly.  Each script typically reaches 200mb in size - on a
system with 256mb physical :)

The other application-style use of PHP I've had great luck with is as a
regular console application.  The PHP CLI script talks to a card reader
through a serial port (using a C extension), uses my own ncurses C
extension to interface with the user, and uploads data to a MySQL
database across the network.  The application has run - without restart
- for over 5 months on a throw-away Pentium-133 running RedHat 7.3.

These scripts, however, still require a compiled PHP binary somewhere on
the system.  The Roadsend Compiler for PHP that Shannon spoke of
eliminates this need by compiling a static binary (correct any details
Shannon).  This - among other features - is some very exciting stuff,
and I hope we can get a presentation on it soon :)

I generally find that Tek-Serve have the reputation for being straight
shooters and are cheaper than the Apple Store. I bet the hardware is
the big cost here anyway.

Aaron,
Open up Terminal
type in:
cd /etc/httpd/

then type
ls -la

you should see httpd.conf

if you do, then type:
sudo vi httpd.conf

then search for php by typing /php <enter>

remove the # sign in front of the two lines that contain php.
you can remove a single character by typing x.  x will remove the 
character under the cursor.

when you're done type
:wq

then restart Personal Web Sharing

It can compile to a "stand alone" binary (not requiring an interpreter
or source). The actual executable can be linked either statically or
dynamically to the various runtime libraries.

It can also generate static and shared libraries, which can be used
either with stand alone applications, or as compiled web applications
run directly from apache.

Also included is a complete interpreter for running code 'on the fly',
just as Zend PHP does (from both command line and from the web).

Hopefully once we've released the final product, we'll have time to
schedule a presentation!

Thanks Chris.  I was able to get things going nicely last night by 
doing the following:

In Terminal:
"locate httpd.conf"

bbedit /private/etc/httpd/httpd.conf

and then made the necessary changes in bbedit to enable php.

This page was a helpful resource:

Thank to everyone for their suggestions,

Michael,

  If it is just the ethernet port, why not throw in an airport card and 
buy an inexpensive wireless access point?  The access point can be 
purchased for under $40.00 and the airport card for under $100.00.

Just my $.02

This is in fact exactly how we solved it.  Many thanks to everybody who

Subject: [nycphp-talk] How do you do the equivalent of $PHP_SELF for PHP
 scripts not in docroot?
Message-ID: <40AA363B.3060303@adnet-sys.com>

Is there a way to get an equivalent of $PHP_SELF for a PHP script that 
is not residing in the document root?  Apparently if you have PHP 4.3.2 
and Apache 2.0 in Red Hat Linux 7.3, at the very least, $PHP_SELF is 
only populated with content indicating the location of the PHP script 
calling $PHP_SELF if that PHP script resides in Apache's document root 
or below.

But I have some PHP scripts that will be ultimately referenced via cron 
that have to reside outside of the document root.  When I do

[PHP]phpinfo();[/PHP]

I get "no value" for the variable $PHP_SELF.  This tells me apparently 
that it can only identify itself from within the document root. 

So this leaves me with a problem.  How can I find $PHP_SELF, or 
something like $PHP_SELF, in a PHP script that's outside of the document 
root?  I am looking for values within the path that I will need to 
dynamically populate portions of that same PHP script, otherwise, the 
user, upon inheriting these cron files, have to MANUALLY change values 
inside the PHP script every time!

Thanx
Phil

Try the __FILE__ constant.  Example:
    echo __FILE__;

There is also getcwd() for the dir.. i.e.
$dir = getcwd();
$file = $dir . "/" . $PHP_SELF;

Thanx.  This, however, opened up a rather annoying can-of-worms at this 
point.  My company wants me to ensure that the application I built is 
thoroughly portable and scalable, of course, not unreasonable.  Which 
means that all of the required code will be thoroughly portable from 
Client A thorugh Client Z and will work exactly the same for Client A 
through Client Z.

This means that it needs to globally include two library scripts I 
wrote: one (client_globals.inc.php) that will set all of the 
client-related global variables/functions/classes/stuff, and one 
(project_globals.inc.php) that will set all of the 
client-related-project-related global stuff specific to that client's 
project.

The code I wrote to do this is this and resides only in one file 
(index.php):

[PHP]
 require(realpath($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . 
'/acme/acme_globals/client_globals.inc.php'));        // GET GLOBAL ACME 
- SCOPE ITEMS/CLASSES

  // GET PROJECT-SCOPE VARIABLES FOR I.C.
  
require(realpath("$DOCUMENT_ROOT/$clientFolderName/image_catalog/image_catalog_globals/project_globals.inc.php"));
[/PHP]

Here's the problem.  Suppose that my company wants to market this 
product out to another client, Foo Industries.  That would mean that the 
folks that get my application will have to literally MANUALLY change the 
lines in index.php from 'acme' to 'foo' or whatever the folder name will 
be for that client.  This is, of course, quite a major-league hassle to 
ask for.  And frankly, I just can't think of any system I want to use 
that would be able to automate the process so that the code in index.php 
can remain fairly "static" and not needing to be physically altered from 
client to client.

If anyone can think of how I might be able to approach this, I'm all ears.

Thanx

Well, how most generally do it is via a define, in a config.
define("APPPATH", "/var/www/html/project");

Then in code that includes this file with this and other settings.
You call defined vals like so

include APPPATH ."/file.php";

Does that answer the question?
getcwd() is what I usually use to set this all programmatically.

Yes and no.  Perhaps my understanding of "config" and "define" are a bit 
overcomplicated in my head for me to come up with a simplified version, 
so I came up with the complex one, as usual.

I created a binary 0644 text CSV file that reads the required globals 
and sets them into $_SESSION variables one time shot only.  Problem is 
that the CSV file is 0644, a huge security HOLE!  It needs to be 0600, 
but then Apache can't read it and the application breaks.  The CSV file 
is created via a command-line PHP scripts "install.php" which creates it 
in /home/me/scripts/cron and then you have to physically move it to the 
docroot, in the same place as index.php

like so.. why are you messing around with csv files?

file config.php
<?
	define("APPPATH", "/var/www/html/project");
?>

file app.php
<?
	include 'config.php';
	echo APPPATH ."\n";
?>

bash-2.05b$ php app.php
/var/www/html/project

The client wants the easiest means possible of inputting necessary data 
(I didn't say the most secure, the easiest), and CSV files can be opened 
up in Excel and edited.

I can easily write config.php, however, my knowledge of "define" comes 
from the PHP manual, and I see nowhere where it states that anything in 
define() is in a persistent state.  If I run "config.php", I lose all of 
my defined constants, don't I?  And when I go to "index.php" via 
browser, how would it know how to go to config.php if config.php would 
have to reside outside of the docroot?

Again I'm probably overcomplicating this but I can't honestly follow 
your train of logic, though I want to.

just try it.

if you want to know all your defined constants try the following in a
script.

echo "<pre>\n";
print_r($GLOBALS);

I tried it, and here are the steps I would have to take to ensure that 
it would work.

The admin guy will do this:

php -q ../install.php

Here is install.php:

<?php

  
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    File: INSTALL.PHP
    Created: 5/18/2004
    Modified: 5/18/2004
    Purpose: This file will be housed in the /docs document folder for 
the IVC project documentation list and not kept inside the document
             root.  It will generate all necessary global scripts for 
use within the IVC.
    Dependencies:
            Will be called via command-line PHP and can be set up as a 
cron, if so, move to /cron/[client folder name]/[project folder name].
            Takes two required parameters:

                1) client folder name
                2) project folder name

    Cookies: NONE
    Sessions: NONE
    Privacy Scope: Command-line PHP and not meant to be viewable by web 
server
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
  if (!is_file('client_project_folder_info.csv')) {
   $clientFolderName = $argv[1];
   $projectFolderName = $argv[2];
   $contents .= 
"\"clientFolderName\",\"$clientFolderName\"\n\"projectFolderName\",\"$projectFolderName\"";
   $fileID = @fopen('client_project_folder_info.csv', 'wb');
   @fputs($fileID, $contents); @fflush($fileID); @fclose($fileID);
  }
  @chmod('client_project_folder_info.csv', 0644);
  // BE SURE TO COPY IT MANUALLY INTO /[document root]/[client folder 
name]/[project folder name] DIRECTORY TO BE READ BY index.php

  define('CLIENT_FOLDER_NAME', $clientFolderName);
  define('PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME', $projectFolderName);
?>

And again, I'm not at all following your train of logic.  In 
"index.php", on the docroot, I have this line:

[PHP]
list($clientFolderName, $projectFolderName) = array(CLIENT_FOLDER_NAME, 
PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME);
require(realpath($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . 
"/$clientFolderName/${clientFolderName}_globals/client_globals.inc.php"));
[/PHP]

You go to your browser, open up "index.php" and this is what you see:

[Quote]
*Fatal error*: main(): Failed opening required '' 
(include_path='.:/usr/share/pear') in */www/html/index.php* on line *64
[/Quote]

Just read David Sklar's  "Essential PHP tools". It serves as a great 
reference for Pear DB, Auth,HTML_Quickform etc.. I don't even know him, 
so I'm not being biased.

But I was curious about people's feelings of Smarty. Do most think this 
extra processing is worth it? A conscientious job of keeping logic and 
presentation separate would accomplish this as well. Any feelings?

Also, any feelings about DB and whether there is a big performance hit? 
Also, does it work well with stored procedures and other RBDMS specific 
goodies?

Wow, ok I did overcomplicate it, the solution was so simple it escaped 
me altogether.

Here is my install.php, I just run this from command line:

[PHP]
<?php

  
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    File: INSTALL.PHP
    Created: 5/18/2004
    Modified: 5/18/2004
    Purpose: This file will be housed in the /docs document folder for 
the IVC project documentation list and not kept inside the document
             root.  It will generate all necessary constants for use 
within the IVC by dynamically generating the necessary content from the
             $argv array values from user input and include them into 
script that will be placed into
             /[your document root]/[your client folder name]/[your 
project folder name]/include/constants.inc.php

    Dependencies:
            Will be called via command-line PHP and can be set up as a 
cron, if so, move to /cron/[client folder name]/[project folder name].
            Takes four required parameters:

                1) client folder name
                2) project folder name
                3) your home directory path where this script resides
                4) the document root (e.g. "/var/www/html")

    Cookies: NONE
    Sessions: NONE
    Privacy Scope: Command-line PHP and not meant to be viewable by web 
server
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
  if (!$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] && $_SERVER['PWD']) {
   $clientFolderName = $argv[1];
   $projectFolderName = $argv[2];
   $installHome = $argv[3];
   $docRoot = $argv[4];
   $includeCode = '<' . "?\n\n define('CLIENT_FOLDER_NAME', 
\"$clientFolderName\");\n define('PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME', 
\"$projectFolderName\");\n\n ?" . '>';
   $fileID = 
@fopen("$docRoot/$clientFolderName/$projectFolderName/include/constants.inc.php", 
'w');
   @fputs($fileID, $includeCode); @fflush($fileID); @fclose($fileID);
  }
?>
[/PHP]

Then once this runs it creates a PHP script within the docroot called 
"constants.inc.php" that is included by "index.php" to, you guessed it, 
define constants.

[from index.php:]
[PHP]
 /*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This script will now look for a file called 'constants.inc.php' in 
the /include folder.  This script had to have
    already been generated by the user/admin running "install.php" from 
the command line.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/ 

  if (!defined('CLIENT_FOLDER_NAME') || !defined('PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME')) 
@include('./include/constants.inc.php');
  if (!defined('CLIENT_FOLDER_NAME') || !defined('PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME')) 
die('You must first run "install.php" from the command line - please see 
admin');
  // BOTH CONSTANTS EXIST AS SET BY install.php - SET TO LOCAL VARIABLES
  list($clientFolderName, $projectFolderName) = 
array(CLIENT_FOLDER_NAME, PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME);
  
  //---END OF CONSTANTS RETRIEVAL 
BLOCK--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[/PHP]

*whew* so simple it naturally escaped me.  Thanx
Phil

Deja Vu. :-)

This question sparked the largest thread I've ever seen on PHP-General:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-general&m=108126501502164&w=2

It always makes for a nice debate between three groups of people:

1. Smarty rocks.
2. PHP is a templating system. Why learn another?
3. Templating is good, but Foo is better than Smarty.

This was also the focus of a NYPHP presentation. I encourage you to read
the 100 or so messages sent to PHP-General on the topic and read through
the slides from the NYPHP presentation. You should at least get an idea of
all of the perspectives. :-)

I think Smarty is a helper in that "conscientiousness" department. If 
that help, for your project or company or whatever, is worth the 
performance tradeoff, then Smarty is a good idea.

There are plenty of ways to boost Smarty's performance (caching, using 
an accelerator), so you can minimize the performance hit. And, to be 
completely honest, most web sites aren't running at the level where 
every last bit of performance is so crucial.

A legitimate downside to Smarty is that you need to learn, essentially, 
another programming language -- Smarty's syntax for variable 
interpolation, its function names, etc. But if that syntax is easier to 
grok for your site designers, then that's a good thing.

See also Adam's spot-on mini-rant a little while ago about including 
human time spent and programmer convenience in your calculations of cost 
and performance. Smarty's advantages definitely fit into that category.

> Also, any feelings about DB and whether there is a big performance hit?

I think the big win of DB is that it provides a unified API for database 
access, not so much that it abstracts SQL features whose implementations 
vary across databases. Whatever database program you're using, 
DB::query() sends a query off to the database and (perhaps) returns a 
result handle. The contents of that query can be standard SQL, 
vendor-specific SQL, a stored procedure, whatever you want.

I'm not super techincal when it comes to installing applications on my
Linux server. I'm co-located at Rackspace, and they do a good job of
installing programs when I need it at $75 per hour. The one thing that I
didn't like about Smarty was the installation, which is why I haven't
used it yet.

Right now, I use phpLib's phpCache v1.4 - PHP caching engine. I just
uploaded the templating file and that's it. Any page I want to use the
template on, I just call it via the include and call the object.

Right now, I'd like to get more into XSLT and see if this would be
better.

I find that you take less of a performance hit dealing with templates
than you do with things like large db results that require a lot of
post-processing. While I usually use something a lot smaller and less
involved than Smarty, I feel with a cache/optimizer such as
Turck-MMCache, it almost makes templating a moot point if you cache
the heavy things correctly. For instance, on a site I made, I have
roughly 10 join queries on the front page. I use Turck to cache the
processed query results in shared memory (although you don't need to
use turck, it provides a really simple interface) for five minutes,
and that way, when 1000 people hit my page in 5 minutes I'm doing 10
queries/template calls instead of 10,000.

Something that I've been playing with recently is XDebug (
http://www.xdebug.com/ ), it's pretty useful for code profiling and it
lets you know pretty quick where your slowdowns are.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP License Management
Message-ID: <40ACE586.2030408@phpwerx.net>

Hi all,

I've been asked to come up with a licensing solutions for a 
closed-source php application, and wondered if anyone had any advice.

The application will be licensed either in perpetuity or on a 
subscription basis, and each license will be tied to a particular server 
to make unauthorised distribution more difficult.

The idea I came up with was to create a server app where the user could 
log in and view/purchase/extend licenses and manage the IP address(es) 
each license is tied to.

The 'license' itself would be an encrypted token containing the client 
id, expiry date, ip address(es) etc signed with a private key.

The actual software would then be encoded to protect the source from 
(casual) prying eyes (I was thinking of using the Turck MMCache encoder 
for this) and include code to check the license validity and take 
appropriate action.

The most obvious (to me) attack on the system is to reverse-engineer the 
code and remove the license check, which could be mitigated somewhat be 
encoding the entire app and 'hiding' the check within the code.

It seems to me like a viable solution, but I'm no security expert and 
would appreciate any and all comments or pointers to existing solutions.

Dan

There's no perfect solution here, you just want to be sufficiently ahead 
of likely attackers in the arms race. One thing that might help (but 
will cost you more $) is to use a closed-source encoder like Zend 
Encoder or the ionCube Encoder. Reversing the encoded code is much 
easier when you have the source code to the encoder.

The ionCube encoder offers some protections similar to your licensing 
scheme (but users can't change things), so that might be helpful, too.

I'd look for a way other than IP addys since they're a moving 
target, especially if the customer is running a NATed network.

You are right, the closed source nature of ionCube may make it more 
resistant to reverse engineering...in fact I think the company may 
already have a license for it...

ionCube seems to be a lot cheaper than the Zend solutions...and they

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Change key values in array
Message-ID: <C92A8F8B60F96B42911EFA70AF30A88F060A4777@msp7-msx1.ingenix.com>

Hi folks.  Is it possible to change the key value type in an array?  I have
an array that has string key values, for my purposes I need it to have int
index

NOW LOOKS LIKE:
array(6) { ["04-01"]=> int(0) ["04-02"]=> string(2) "32" ["04-03"]=> int(0)
["04-04"]=> int(0) ["04-05"]=> int(0) ["04-06"]=> int(0) }

I NEED IT TO LOOK LIKE:
array(6) { [0]=> int(0) [1]=> string(2) "32" [2]=> int(0) [3]=> int(0) [4]=>
int(0) [5]=> int(0) }

REASON:
I am getting date value from a DB, and than doing an array_merge with
another template to ensure that any missing month for a category get a zero
in the correct sequence.  Problem is that, the resulting array needs to have
int index for the graphing utility to work.

TIA

 From first glance I would say just use array_values(), that creates the 
enumerative array you want from the original array with the values in 
the same order.

I have used Zen and ionCube on small-scale projects, and I can add:

Consider your vendor in light of your support needs - how much do you 
provide and how much do your customers need. If you will be doing the 
server setup/config then maybe there's no issue, but if the customer has 
to accomodate your use of Zend or ionCube then you may want to consider 
how each of those vendors handles inquiries (since they now become a 
contributor to your companies customer satisfaction quotient). Last 
thing you need is a great product that gets a bad rep because your 
encoder vendor had some compatibility issues.

When I was using ionCube there were some issues with the order in which 
ionCube and Zend extensions were to be installed, and when I used Zend 
there were some additional issues as well related to other products in 
use on the same server. It got messy when the customer moved from dev to 
production servers, especially.  I handled the Zend issues with Zend 
support (they responded very well) and handled the ionCube stuff via 
Internet searches. In then end my solution was dependent on end-user 
server configuration -- something to be aware of. That was a year ago.

I would recommend tying the product to domain name instead of IP. Makes 
for fewer support calls and customer inquiries (change of DNS doesn't 
require support), and perhaps most importantly ties integrity to a 
brand. IMHO companies are less inclined to try beating it  when their 
brand name may be compromised/banned. There may be security issues of 
which I am not attuned that make IP a better choice.

I would also recommend you encode only choice parts using a modular 
approach, perhaps only encoding parts that tie to IP or domain, and then 
a few random bits for obfuscation. This deters the casual cracker, and 
occupies the  determined infringer. Not sure how it plays into 
performance though.

IMHO the  Zend  solution is more likely to need an update when the Zend 
suite is updated, while the ionCube product is more stand-alone (and 
perhaps may be a better value if you only need a perpetual license for 
the encoder).

Finally I have noticed alot of back and forth banter in vendor pre-sale 
forums when encoding is part of the solution, related to how it is used, 
how it effects portability (the IP vs. Domain name thing), who supports 
the server config, etc. If you make it clear that you use encoding, 
perhaps provide sufficient info up front about how it is used or you may 
end up increasing your pre-sale support costs.

Hi all,

I've been asked to come up with a licensing solutions for a 
closed-source php application, and wondered if anyone had any advice.

The application will be licensed either in perpetuity or on a 
subscription basis, and each license will be tied to a particular server 
to make unauthorised distribution more difficult.

The idea I came up with was to create a server app where the user could 
log in and view/purchase/extend licenses and manage the IP address(es) 
each license is tied to.

The 'license' itself would be an encrypted token containing the client 
id, expiry date, ip address(es) etc signed with a private key.

The actual software would then be encoded to protect the source from 
(casual) prying eyes (I was thinking of using the Turck MMCache encoder 
for this) and include code to check the license validity and take 
appropriate action.

The most obvious (to me) attack on the system is to reverse-engineer the 
code and remove the license check, which could be mitigated somewhat be 
encoding the entire app and 'hiding' the check within the code.

It seems to me like a viable solution, but I'm no security expert and 
would appreciate any and all comments or pointers to existing solutions.

Dan

There's no perfect solution here, you just want to be sufficiently ahead 
of likely attackers in the arms race. One thing that might help (but 
will cost you more $) is to use a closed-source encoder like Zend 
Encoder or the ionCube Encoder. Reversing the encoded code is much 
easier when you have the source code to the encoder.

The ionCube encoder offers some protections similar to your licensing 
scheme (but users can't change things), so that might be helpful, too.

I'd look for a way other than IP addys since they're a moving 
target, especially if the customer is running a NATed network.

You are right, the closed source nature of ionCube may make it more 
resistant to reverse engineering...in fact I think the company may 
already have a license for it...

ionCube seems to be a lot cheaper than the Zend solutions...and they 
claim it's faster too.

Hi folks.  Is it possible to change the key value type in an array?  I have
an array that has string key values, for my purposes I need it to have int
index

NOW LOOKS LIKE:
array(6) { ["04-01"]=> int(0) ["04-02"]=> string(2) "32" ["04-03"]=> int(0)
["04-04"]=> int(0) ["04-05"]=> int(0) ["04-06"]=> int(0) }

I NEED IT TO LOOK LIKE:
array(6) { [0]=> int(0) [1]=> string(2) "32" [2]=> int(0) [3]=> int(0) [4]=>
int(0) [5]=> int(0) }

REASON:
I am getting date value from a DB, and than doing an array_merge with
another template to ensure that any missing month for a category get a zero
in the correct sequence.  Problem is that, the resulting array needs to have
int index for the graphing utility to work.

TIA

 From first glance I would say just use array_values(), that creates the 
enumerative array you want from the original array with the values in 
the same order.

I have used Zen and ionCube on small-scale projects, and I can add:

Consider your vendor in light of your support needs - how much do you 
provide and how much do your customers need. If you will be doing the 
server setup/config then maybe there's no issue, but if the customer has 
to accomodate your use of Zend or ionCube then you may want to consider 
how each of those vendors handles inquiries (since they now become a 
contributor to your companies customer satisfaction quotient). Last 
thing you need is a great product that gets a bad rep because your 
encoder vendor had some compatibility issues.

When I was using ionCube there were some issues with the order in which 
ionCube and Zend extensions were to be installed, and when I used Zend 
there were some additional issues as well related to other products in 
use on the same server. It got messy when the customer moved from dev to 
production servers, especially.  I handled the Zend issues with Zend 
support (they responded very well) and handled the ionCube stuff via 
Internet searches. In then end my solution was dependent on end-user 
server configuration -- something to be aware of. That was a year ago.

I would recommend tying the product to domain name instead of IP. Makes 
for fewer support calls and customer inquiries (change of DNS doesn't 
require support), and perhaps most importantly ties integrity to a 
brand. IMHO companies are less inclined to try beating it  when their 
brand name may be compromised/banned. There may be security issues of 
which I am not attuned that make IP a better choice.

I would also recommend you encode only choice parts using a modular 
approach, perhaps only encoding parts that tie to IP or domain, and then 
a few random bits for obfuscation. This deters the casual cracker, and 
occupies the  determined infringer. Not sure how it plays into 
performance though.

IMHO the  Zend  solution is more likely to need an update when the Zend 
suite is updated, while the ionCube product is more stand-alone (and 
perhaps may be a better value if you only need a perpetual license for 
the encoder).

Finally I have noticed alot of back and forth banter in vendor pre-sale 
forums when encoding is part of the solution, related to how it is used, 
how it effects portability (the IP vs. Domain name thing), who supports 
the server config, etc. If you make it clear that you use encoding, 
perhaps provide sufficient info up front about how it is used or you may 
end up increasing your pre-sale support costs.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] pear makerpm
Message-ID: <0HY100MMEKIOL2@mta5.srv.hcvlny.cv.net>

Hey folks,
 
Anyone have experience with the makerpm option in PEAR?  I can generate the
SPEC file just fine, but I can't build the rpm with rpmbuild -bb, as it says
in the manual.  I have the source tarball in the SOURCES directory, and the
SPEC file in the SPECS directory.  The error that I receive is:
 
error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.31347 (%prep)
 
I get a similar error for any of the packages that I try to build.
 
I also have some questions about the pear format in general.  I'm going
through the developer's guide at pear.php.net to learn more about the pear
package format.  What I don't see is where the package is "registered", so
the system knows what version you are running.
 
Can anyone shed some light on these?
 
Thanks,
 
Tom

I don't know that much, but can you send the spec file? The (%prep) 
stanza may need looking at.

Hi,

I have an script that was written after PHP 4.0.5 and wish to figure out what functions need to be worked around to get it to work on the 4.0.5 server. 

Other than checking the functions one by one on the function / PHP version table at php.net, is there a tool out there that would do it for me?

TIA,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL 4.0.10 Fulltext Search Relevancy Problem
Message-ID: <40AE1149.6060609@adnet-sys.com>

Apologies in advance if this is off-topic but this has been a perplexing 
issue now for weeks and found no resolution on several PHP and MySQL 
boards and forums.

Environment: PHP 4.3.2, MySQL 4.0.10, Apache 2.0, Linux Red Hat 7.3


I have a rather complicated query that is dynamically created via PHP 
class method, with a combination of LEFT JOINs and two MATCHES where the 
first match is non-boolean to get the accurate score, the second to 
search as boolean:

    quote:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    SELECT
    image.id, image.image_name,
    (MATCH (image_name, image_alt, image_location_city,
    image_location_state, image_location_country) AGAINST ('test')
    OR MATCH (first_name, last_name) AGAINST ('test')
    OR MATCH (keyword_name) AGAINST ('test')
    OR MATCH (event_name) AGAINST ('test')
    OR MATCH (placement_name) AGAINST ('test')
    ) as score,
    image.image_path, image.image_creation_date
    FROM image

    LEFT JOIN image_person_assoc ON image_person_assoc.image_id = image.id
    LEFT JOIN person ON person.id = image_person_assoc.person_id
    LEFT JOIN image_keyword_assoc ON image_keyword_assoc.image_id =
    image.id
    LEFT JOIN keyword ON keyword.id = image_keyword_assoc.keyword_id
    LEFT JOIN image_event_assoc ON image_event_assoc.image_id = image.id
    LEFT JOIN event ON event.id = image_event_assoc.event_id
    LEFT JOIN image_placement_assoc ON image_placement_assoc.image_id =
    image.id
    LEFT JOIN placement ON placement.id =
    image_placement_assoc.placement_id

    WHERE MATCH (image_name, image_alt, image_location_city,
    image_location_state, image_location_country) AGAINST ('+test+' IN
    BOOLEAN MODE)
    OR MATCH (first_name, last_name) AGAINST ('+test+' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
    OR MATCH (keyword_name) AGAINST ('+test+' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
    OR MATCH (event_name) AGAINST ('+test+' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
    OR MATCH (placement_name) AGAINST ('+test+' IN BOOLEAN MODE)

    GROUP BY image.id
    ORDER BY score DESC, upper(image.image_name) ASC
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------



Sample Results:

    quote:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    +-----+----------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+

    | id | image_name             | score |
    image_path                                     | image_creation_date |
    +-----+----------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+

    | 100 |blah.jpg                   | 1        |
    /html/images/blah.jpg                  | 2003-01-01 |
    | 101 | mysql-81x42.png | 1        | /html/images/mysql-81x42.png |
    0000-00-00 |
    +-----+----------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------



Using this query I always get a relevancy score of 1 every time; I do 
not actually get the floating-point decimal number that I was seeking 
(the accurate relevancy); this based on information I found at 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Fulltext_Search.html . The SQL query 
is correct, though (I receive no SQl-related nor MySQL-related errors), 
just not numerically accurate in its relevancy.

Anything I might need to do to finetune this?

Thanx
Phil

This is because of your MATCH statements.  Because you are doing OR,
it's a logical operator, and thus:

1 OR 1 OR 1 =3D 1

I think you need to revisit your query and possibly break it into
multiple queries.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Output Buffering and Blank Page
Message-ID: <d0cb92620405211137422deb1e@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everyone!

I have a problem that is about half solved and I am looking for some
input from the group.

The site I work for has a large member base (~1000 - 3000 members
online at any given time)

We have output buffering turned on to improve performance.  It seems
to work great but on scripts that have large queries the user will see
a blank white page until the script finishes. Sometimes this can be
annoying when the script takes more then a few seconds to execute.

In order to avoid this I have come up with a scheme that works very
well but I would really appreciate some criticism/tips to improve it.

The Scheme is comprised of three parts the loading script, the process
script and the display script.

Loading Script
-----------------------------
Displays a cute loading icon and forwards GETS/POSTS to an embedded image.
When the page/image finishes loading (javascript onload) the page is
forwarded on to the display script.

Process Script (embedded image in the Loading Script)
-----------------------------
The process Script will do all the work and create the output that
normally is shot out to the screen after waiting for the white/blank
screen to go away.  When the script is finished the output is stored
to a session variable and the buffer cleared.  Finally a one pixal png
will be output so the Loading Script will know its done.

Display Script
-----------------------------
The user will be directed here after the process script is done.  If
the output of the process script is in the session variable it is
displayed and the session variable is unset.  The user sees the
results.

So at this point this little hack is working great in my staging area.
How will this scale to all of our users?  Is it safe to put the html
(about 1k) into the sessions for that many people at the same time? Am
I going at this problem all wrong?

Thanks in advance everyone!

Try the PEAR PHP_Compatibility package
(http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=27): "Finds the lowest
version of PHP needed to run a PHP file/PHP files in a folder. Will soon
parse a script and check all includes and find the lowest common version.
Additionally, it finds all extensions needed to run the code. This could
easily be used in PEAR_PackageFileManager, say you set a PHP dependency of
"auto" and it'll detect it. Also could be used to find all extension
dependencys."
Very alpha but probably better than doing it by hand.

Thank's,

Exactly what I was looking for. Much better than looking up things on the Function/Version table.

No problem. Maybe you could report back on how well it works. I'd be

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SQL statement question
Message-ID: <04c501c4410e$d11e54b0$0200a8c0@desktop>

Hello,

I'm going to create a MySql table that looks something like the following (I think). It's a history of courses taken by students.

History_ID Student_FID Course_FID
1          34          2
2          17          7
3          21          5
4          02          5
5          34          5
6          17          4
...        ...         ...

I'd like to be able to say which students have met the requirements of certain programs. So, I need a statement that will produce a list of Student_FID's that are matched with a particular set of Course_FID's. For instance, which students took both course 5 and course 2? 

So, I'm trying subqueries to find students who have taken courses 1,2,and 3:

"SELECT *
 FROM
 (SELECT *
  FROM
  (SELECT *
   FROM history
   WHERE course_fid = 3)
   AS id3
  WHERE course_fid = 2)
  AS id2
 WHERE course_fid = 1"

I get an error that my sql syntax is wrong. Maybe it is. Or maybe my host's version of MySQL is too old? Is there a better SQL statement? Any help is appreciated...

Thanks!

Did you try:

SELECT * FROM history WHERE (course_fid=1 AND course_fid=2 AND 
course_fid=3);

You could also use OR instead of AND, depending on the results you want.

Unless you're using MySQL 4.1 or later (which I doubt, since it's not
production level yet) sub-queries are not supported.

To answer your question "which students took both course 5 and course
2?" I'd recommend a query like this (assuming History_FID is unique):

SELECT H1.Student_FID
FROM history H1 LEFT JOIN history H2 ON H2.History_ID=3DH1.History_ID
WHERE H1.Course_FID =3D '5' AND H2.Course_FID =3D '2'

I'm by no means an expert is browser and JS tricks, but it sounds like a
clever way of doing it.  Clever enough even for a presentation?  :)  It

Thanks, Bill.

I tried the following, but I get an error that table TMPhistory does not
exist. Do I have to somehow create the temporary tables first?

SELECT a.student_fid from TMPhistory a, TMPhistory b, TMPhistory c
WHERE a.student_fid = b.student_fid = c.student_fid
AND a.course_fid = 1 AND b.course_fid = 2 AND c.course_fid = 3

Also, I tried the following and it works, sort of:

select * from history
inner join history as t1 using (student_fid)
inner join history as t2 using (student_fid)
inner join history as t3 using (student_fid)
where (t1.course_fid = 1)
and (t2.course_fid = 2)
and (t3.course_fid = 3)

I get the correct student_fid, but I get it 3 times, I guess because it
shows up 3 times (once in each of the tables). Is there any way to just get
unique student_fid's?

Thanks for your help.

I called it TMPhistory on my system so that I would know to drop it 
later.  The name you choose is up to you, so calling the table "history" 
should be fine.

To get just one answer (supposing there are more registration rows per 
student per course) you can place the word "distinct" before the name of 
the column you are selecting (and be sure not to select a unique column 
like History_ID):

SELECT distinct a.student_fid from TMPhistory a, TMPhistory b, TMPhistory c
WHERE a.student_fid = b.student_fid = c.student_fid
AND a.course_fid = 1 AND b.course_fid = 2 AND c.course_fid = 3

you could take another approach which avoids table joins and is easier to extend with more courses:

$courses = array(2, 5...etc);

$sql = 'SELECT count(*), student_FID FROM TMPHistory WHERE Course_FID in ('.implode(',', $courses).') group by student_FID having count(*) = '.count($courses);

I would have to agree.  As well, take a look at how the travel sites, like
expedia and orbitz do it.  From what I could tell, they have a basic
animated image showing during page load, and once the page is finished some
js outputs to hide the loading stuff and load the data.  I've used their
method in the past and it worked well. 

I've also seen a few people do the same with file uploads since php can't
grab the file headers as well as asp and perl can to show uploading info.

I would imagine both those sites run fairly well with heavy traffic (as I'm
sure they get far more day to day traffic than the majority of the things
I've worked on thus far).

Thanks, that works too. Thanks to everyone for your help. I didn't realize
there would be so many different ways to approach the same issue. Is there
an online resource you would recommend to learn more about 'advanced' sql
queries? This seems to be a pretty good start, but there's not much
explanation, and it's not complete:
http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp. Thanks again...

Hey,

I have a directory that is password protected using .htaccess. How can I
cancel that protection for specific subdirectories?


Thanks,

Daniel,

you would either need to use cpanel or whichever control panel your host
uses, there should be an option in there for editing your htaccess file, if
they do not use a control panel, you will need to edit the file manually.

I am not sure of the default in unix environments if you have access to this
file or not, you may want to check with your host.

I have full access to the files. The question is what goes into the
.htaccess to cancel the "AuthType Basic" from the parent directory.

i believe you just remove the line with the directory path that you want to
unprotect ;)

Not really:

In /var/www/html/.htaccess there is
AuthType Basic
AuthName "admin"
AuthUserFile "<path to passwd>"

I would like to unprotect /var/www/html/somedir
/var/www/html/somedir does not have an .htaccess, so there's nothing to
remove.

Daniel, 

check the .htpasswd file, i believe the line you want is in there ;)

.htaccess and .htpasswd work together.  I forgot to mention that ;)

by the way i believe that having your htaccess file and or htpasswd file in
your web directory is very insecure, there are programs that can crack
htaccess passwords.

Looking through the Apache docs it doesn't seem there is a way to do 
this, the only supported AuthType directives are Basic and Digest.

You may want to try placing a .htaccess file in /var/www/html/somedir 
with the lines:

Allow from all
Satisfy any

You can read more about these directives here:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#satisfy

Hello all,

does anyone remember the URL for the online version of David Sklar's 
excellent presentation on QuickForm from last night?

I looked at his website, but did not seem to find it (I know, I know, I

And as my aging memory is failing me, if someone could me fill me in, it 
would be great.

Thanks!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] using PHP for an offline / CD-ROM presentation
Message-ID: <40B4B2C1.2080902@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I have done some research on the topic of using PHP to power a CD-based 
presentation/data retrieval program; I have not come up with any good 
answers yet (on how best to utilize PHP for this purpose). I thought 
that the smart people on this list might have insight into this issue.

The problem is as follows:
I would like to create a program that pop-ups when a user inserts a CD 
into their computer. This program will let the user enter the product 
code of Company A or Company B and it, in turn, will display the 
corresponding code for the same product manufactured by Company C. (This 
project would be for Company C.) When the code for the product by 
Company C is shown, corresponding details such as product image and 
specifications should also be available.

So, I would (most probably) need to store all this product data in a 
database, and then retrieve that information from another program.

Doing this thing with PHP, Apache and MySQL is no problem. The problem, 
however, occurs when I want to package this program onto a CD. Wouldn't 
a PHP, Apache, MySQL combination be too heavy for an offline, 
run-from-CD program? Would users cancel any installation program and not 
use the CD if it were that heavy? What would other solutions to this 
problem be?

Here are some answers I came up with:

* PHP-GTK - http://gtk.php.net/ + SQLite
I looked into PHP-GTK and played with it a bit. It looks nice, but I am 
still confused by the wide variety of tools available for it, especially 
on Windows. And I am not sure if PHP-GTK programs can talk to SQLite. If 
they can, I am not sure how to package my PHP-GTK programs along with 
the PHP binary and the SQLite database  on a CD. Can anyone recommend a 
good book on PHP-GTK ?

* XUL + PHP + MySQL / XUL + PHP + SQLite
The MozPHP plugin available at http://mozphp.mozdev.org/ lets you run 
PHP scripts directly through Mozilla, without needing the Apache server. 
  So, I could add Mozilla to the CD (along with the MozPHP plugin) and 
then make Mozilla display a PHP script which will generate a XUL based 
interface. The PHP script will still have to access some database: 
SQLite, perhaps? MySQL, maybe?

If it is MySQL, is there an embeddable / portable version of MySQL?

* JavaScript + XUL + MySQL -
There is are a couple of Mozilla add-ons that lets Mozilla directly 
access a MySQL database via JavaScript.
There is one by Jan Varga at mozilla.org (the one that looked better), 
but I cannot find the URL for it now.
The other one is at http://mysql.mozdev.org/ .
I do not like JavaScript's syntax that much, and as far as I remember 
both add-ons were not documented that much.

* Java + MySQL / Java + SQLite / Java + Berkeley DB
Well, in this option I am abandoning PHP totally. I will use Java to 
create a program that embeds another database engine.

Which option do you think is the best / most practical? Is PHP suited to 
making offline programs ? Can MySQL be embedded in PHP / Java programs ?

Thanks in advance.

Best Regards,

- Jay Sheth

I have done this in the past, but only used JavaScript and flatfiles for 
data.  This was the CD version of a LAMP site (ironically for Microsoft) 
and I just didn't have time to look for any other options.  It was ugly, 
I hated doing it, but it worked.  Now that there are more options for a 
richer 'client experience', I'm very interested in the choices that you 
make, as well as the results...

PHP-GTK is not much more than a CLI program that creates its own GUI. 
Anything you can do with a "normal" PHP application you can do with 
PHP-GTK.  Unfortuanately I haven't found any books dedicated to PHP-GTK 
yet.  Adam and David's PHP Cookbook does have a chapter on PHP-GTK 
though.  For me the hardest part of getting any GUI stuff running was 
trying to get PHP-GTK installed with all of the goodies.  I still can't 
get Scintilla to work with it.

PHP-GTK 1.0 doesn't work with PHP5.  If you want to use it with PHP5 
you'll have to wait until PHP-GTK 2.0 comes out.

Guys,

http://webpanels.sourceforge.net/

i am not sure if this will be of interest but i thought i would pass this along since it took advantage of PHP 5.  I thought it was quite cool how php could have a system like ASP.NET however i guess it is just namespaces and classes ;) 

I think this project would have been better done as an extension rather than a ton of classes though just my opinion.

Jayesh-

Have you considered using Flash or Director? Flash, in particular, has some
very nice classes for working with XML data. I bet you can do everything you
wanted to with PHP with Flash instead. You can either embed the Flash file
in an HTML container to run in a browser, or output it as a projector for
Mac/Window (not sure about Linux). Actionscript is a very nice language to
work with, and with the new data components in Flash 7, the display and
parsing of data (XML, flatfile, or from a database) couldn?t be easier.

You might consider a Linux Live CD setup, with instructions for the user 
to boot from the CD.

Knoppix and Gentoo come to mind... they boot fast and are way 
compatible, and you end up in a full LAMP environment for running your 
ap. Not sure of licensing issues but you can check that out.

I did this with a library situation where they had a bunch of old PCs 
networked but unworthy of M$ upgrades. Booted them all with a liveCD and 
custom desktop, and never looked back (486's and PII's still running 
virtually overhead free to this day).

If you like this idea, check out the K12 linix project for an example of 
how some guys did this really, really well (although they use RH and not 
a liveCD, because they need alot of stuff)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] when PHP outsourcing is not cheap any more
Message-ID: <40B4C945.5040007@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I came across an interesting ad on Google which led me here:
http://php-mysql-developer.com/default.aspx?aff=google&key=php_india_6mo

It seemes a programmer in India who lives outside of where I grew up 
(Pune) is advertising his services on Google. He is the requesting the 
small sum of $500 per week for his services, provided that he is 
guaranteed a minimum of 6 months of employment.

In his FAQ, he has these snippets:

"
What do I seek?
I am looking for a full-time telecommuting job as a PHP/MySQL developer. 
I will work as a WEB-BASED employee to your company , or in other words, 
I will work from my location and communicate with you over the Internet.

[...]

Isn't the salary you are asking for, low?
NO. I live in India where a salary of $500 is sufficient for my needs, 
provided I have a job security.

[...]
What are your other traits?
Intelligent, Sharp, Hard working, tech-savvy, self-managing, honest, 
committed, excellent communication skills.

I hope I have answered some of your questions. Here is MY CHALLENGE :
I can perform the job of TWO developers alone. I can take up projects 
from scratch, design and develop them all by myself. The end result 
would be comparable or BETTER than what a developer with $80,000 annual 
salary would do! GUARANTEED!!
"

I just visited my family in India this spring, and I say with certainty 
that $2000 per month is a HUGE sum in India. Even talented developers 
there are paid $500 - $600 per month.

I have nothing against outsourcing - I think it can be quite useful in 
some cases. But the thing is, it is surprising to find individuals based 
in India marketing themselves with such self-assurance: asking $2000 per 
month and 6 months of *guaranteed* employement and claiming to be able 
to do the work of two people over that period of time.

This curious offer could mean one of several things:
- The demand for outsourced services from India has gone up so much that 
their prices will soon be approaching New York prices
- This guy is marketing himself at prices WAY above standard Indian 
rates and in fact employing other people
- Another, unknown factor is at work

On a side note, I recently posted a help wanted ad on Craigslist for 
some direct (snail) mail marketing work - I got over 100 resumes, some 
from people with MBAs. And from operating in the New York tech market 
for some time now, I know what kind of pressure there is on the price of 
services. Often, if I propose an hourly rate, the sale won't be made or 
will be harder than if I had proposed a fixed bid for a project.

So, putting any resentment or bias aside, can anyone else explain what's 
going on here?

Thanks,

- Jay Sheth
PS: some time ago there was a thread at NYPHP talk which I did not 
bother to respond to; it went something like this (I am exagerating): 
PHP programmers in India are paid $10 per month! OMG! Well, rest assured 
that they are paid a decent amount ($200 - $500 per month), but 
definitely NOT $2000 per month. Even graduates from their top colleges 
(IIT, for example), make about $8000 - $10000 per year.

Hello,

I think the best solution for what you are looking to do is to use Flash,
you can code all the data in , you can make the flash file an executable
file and just a small auto run script will make it start automatically..

Does any one has comments regarding shifting an APM solution to Solaris?
Good or bad?  My exposure has only been on Linux, WIN2K, and IBM as the
basis for the said APM solution.

Kindly give me enough so I could do a business case... or better yet point
me to some relevant articles please.

I did some php/flash integration for http://www.collegeaccess529.com on
Solaris with Oracle9i.

I really didn't notice anything different from a linux system. I haven't
used any Windows servers, but I would guess that a basic difference
would be in filesystem paths.. 
C:/foo vs /foo
but since both unix and linux both use the /foo approach, it's not an issue.

probably not enough for a business case, but that's all I got for ya

Hello all,

thanks very much for your responses and suggestions regarding making an 
offline CD application using PHP. Jeff's suggestion seems to be awesome 
( http://www.indigostar.com/microweb.htm ). I will definitely try it out.

Thanks also to the person who suggested Flash. My brother also suggested 
Flash - but the thing is that it might take me some time to get up to 
speed with Flash. And its (vector graphics) nature is a bit ... 
different. Flash used to be associate more with graphic designers than 
with developers, but this has clearly changed by now. (The website of 
the person who suggested Flash is incredibly well done, by the way. 
Congrats on the great job!)

I should buy a book and Flash and read up on its database capabilities ...

Best Regards,

- Jay Sheth

So, Phil, how do you manage to feed yourself while you're bidding on $15
projects?

$500/wk would get you seven dinners at a total of $71.42
Sounds pretty lavish to me.

You can browse the code here:

--> http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/pres2

(Check it out by following the instructions at 
http://us4.php.net/anoncvs.php but checkout the "pres2" directory 
instead of "php-src").

There is also a presentation about it here:

$500/wk would get me a TV dinner, after spending $750/mo on rent, 
$500/mo on car payments,
$100/mo on utilities, $100 on car insurance, $120/mo on gas and $250/mo 
on debts.

Haven't even won a $15 project yet.  Not that I'm looking at this point.

> Does any one has comments regarding shifting an APM solution to Solaris?

Rafi,

I currently run my AMP setup on Solaris 9 SPARC, and built everything from
source (I have a quick and dirty set of instructions here:
http://krook.net/os/lamp-install.txt).

I've also put AMP binaries on Solaris 9 x86 via pkg-get, which is similar
to RPM or apt-get on a Linux system (pkg-get is available for both SPARC
and x86 though).  Both environments run fairly smooth and were simple
enough to set up, but I only run them on my home network - not in an
enterprise environment.  However, I've heard rumors that the Apache/Solaris
combo has the highest average uptime among production web servers, but I
haven't seen a recent set of stats to confirm that.

On either a SPARC or x86 machine, you would need to make sure that your
Solaris installation had the standard set of GNU developer tools, and that
where possible they are in your PATH when building instead of the Solaris
versions.  For example, Solaris tar is not able to untar the MySQL binary
tarball, and you would need a copy of gcc to compile Apache and PHP anyway,
as Solaris does not come with a C compiler.  The commercial version that
Sun sells goes for a hefty price if I recall correctly.   I believe I've
also had problems using the stock unzip instead of gunzip.

All the standard GNU tools in package form are available at
http://sunfreeware.com/, which is where pkg-get gets its binaries.  Other
resources to check out are:

Everything Solaris
http://everythingsolaris.org/

The home of pkg-get (CSW - Community Software Packages for The Solaris
Operating Environment):
http://blastwave.org/

Sun's Big Admin site is also full of resources on AMP tools and Linux
migration / dual boot etc.:
http://sun.com/bigadmin/
http://sun.com/bigadmin/faq/
http://sun.com/bigadmin/resources/

Solaris Resources at Kempston:
http://www.kempston.net/solaris/contents.html


I picked Solaris for reasons other than to run AMP tools on it, and if I
had to do it all over again using what I use now, I probably would have
picked a Linux distribution.  That said, it's still a solid and proven
platform for AMP.

What's your motivation for exploring alternatives to Linux or AIX?

Actually I can get you a kick ass dinner in Manhattan for $2 bucks...    
Try the Punjabi place on Houston & 1st Ave. X-CELLENT.  After your job  
has been outsourced a few times you get to know the low budget ethnic  
eats.

greetings ...

ive been struggling getting something compiled (its for a wireless
honeycomb project) and was going crazy today through googling my problem
and could not come up with a single solution, so maybe someone here has
seen the same issue (a few people compiling php modules seem to have the
same issue without solution) ...

configure bails out @:
sed: file ./dsjfoidsfjods/subs-1.sed line 84: Unterminated `s' command

now i figured it was shell related because through bash this happens:

$ echo "php" | sed "s/php/\\/"
sed: -e expression #1, char 8: Unterminated `s' command
$ echo "php" | sed 's/php/\\'
\

im not sure what to conclude here since i ran through config.status and
could not find any "" expressions.  just one of those problems i just
like to understand.

Try adding a statement like

error_log = php_errors.log

to your php.ini

try to get the page in 
question again and 
see what is in the 'php_errors.log'
(or whatever you named the logfile)

You have a table with id, name, and title fields.

You want to create a query that selects * where title is distinct -- 
that is, if two or more records have the same title, only the fields 
from the first are be returned.

Should be easy, right?

Is this a question?

SELECT DISTINCT title, id, name from table GROUP BY title;

Might actually need the GROUP BY on all (ie, GROUP BY title, id, name), or
some functions, I just did this, if it helps:

Select DISTINT carriers, MIN(price) as price, maxStops from paxflights where
paxiticket = 'abcde12345' GROUP BY carrier, maxStops;

I've offered to do a book review on '*Macromedia Flash MX Professional 
2004 Unleashed*' by David Vogeleer 
<http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?userid=mHu1Qciy9P&ath=David+Vogeleer> 
and Matthew Pizzi 
<http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?userid=mHu1Qciy9P&ath=Matthew+Pizzi> 
(ISBN:  067232606X).  There is a chapter dedicated to integrating flash 
applications with PHP (and chapters for other languages as well).  As 
flash is really coming into it's own as a front-end for Internet 
applications, we all would be better of at least knowing how to 
integrate our application logic with flash...

There's also a sourceforge project providing flash remoting capabilities 
as a PHP class:  http://www.amfphp.org/  I HIGHLY suggest you take a 
peek.  ;)

My old pad was $3000/month on the Upper East Side.  Now I got twice the 
pad for half the money, and I'm one block from the ocean (Brooklyn).  
Fuhgeddaboudit!  $500/week and I'd have to live in an empty Westinghouse 
box!

The humourous side of this outsourcing drama is that the outsourcers are 
getting outsourced, too...  Just look at Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, not 
to mention Hong Kong.  I suppose Australia is next?

I haven't, but it looks intriguing enough to be worth giving it a whirl.
Thanks for pointing it out.

It looks like a person who likes HTML_QuickForm and Smarty could use this
and forgo HTML_QuickForm. OTOH, HTML_QuickForm has a few other nice bells
and whistles of its own, and you could port an HTML_QuickForm/Smarty thing
to another template engine by changing a line or two.

I had a date calculation bug that was driving me nuts all day, and I finally figured it out... on two different servers (one UNIX, one Windows; both PHP 4.3), midnight 10/31/2004 and midnight 11/01/2004 are 25 hours apart. Does anyone else get the same result? Here's a snippet to try:

<?
$ts1 = mktime(0, 0, 0, 10, 31, 2004);
$ts2 = mktime(0, 0, 0, 11, 1, 2004);
$diff = ($ts2 - $ts1) / (60 * 60);
print "ts1 = $ts1<br>ts2 = $ts2<br>difference is $diff hours";
?>

Here's my output (both servers):

ts1 = 1099195200
ts2 = 1099285200
difference is 25 hours

All other consecutive dates I tried give a 24 hour difference, as does 10/31 - 11/1 in 2003 and 2005... is this a PHP bug? could it possibly have anything to do with daylight savings time?

That's the day when the change between Daylight Savings and Regular time
happens.

so does that mean that when the switch the other way occurs the difference will be 23 hours?

The next question is, what do you do about calculating real (not clock)
differences between two dates that straddle the time change?

I've looked at the recipe in the <fawn>justly legendary</fawn> PHP
Cookbook. It involves converting to Julian day. I came across it
belatedly, after I'd rolled my own solution that converts the input dates
to GMT and then does the arithmetic. It appears to work with every case
I've thrown at it; I've tested the hell out of it. Still I wonder if you
guys think the strategy is sound.

One thing I like about my solution is that it doesn't require any
extensions to be loaded.

Doing all your internal date math with GMT is a good idea. As long as 
you don't use $timestamp += 86400 or $timestamp -=86400 for incrementing 
  or decrementing by 1 day, then you should be OK. strtotime() is pretty 
good about respecting DST changes. Depending on your system, though, 
Julian days handle a wider range of dates than epoch timestamps.

Just so I can get a clearer picture, is there something evil about
installing Julian, or is it that it's not a "standard" package and therefore
just an annoyance?

There's nothing evil about it, but the functions are part of the 
"calendar" extension, so there is a small chance they won't be available 
on every PHP installation. I say small chance because the "calendar" 
extension is included in the default configuration and depends on no 
external libraries.

(I'm really starting to dislike Outlook Express as a list reader, the
replies get unthreaded :( Barring that..)

As far as having "calendar" installed, I recall reading that some parts of
calendar (or was it one of the user-submitted new calender-like extens?)
were not always available on Windoze for some reason. Stupid windows. :(

Hey David Sklar:

One more question about the cool presentation tool. Mind if I peek at the
underlying *.xml files, for your slides so I can ape and learn, and if so
where? I can't seem to track down any example slides and the documentation
I've been able to find is sparse.  In particular, I want to figure out how
to add a live HTML form that will invoke some PHP when submitted.

If anyone else knows where to find tips or docs I'd be grateful.

I'm not sure whether Dave committed his stuff to the presentations
project, but even if he didn't, you can find lots of good examples there:

http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/presentations/

It's a separate project from pres2.

Hope that helps.

* pres2 is the name of the presentation program (e.g. PowerPoint)

* presentations is a collection of presentation files in pres2 format.

Thanks guys.

That is one cool tool. I am planning a mini-spiel on using HTML_QuickForm
and Smarty together for the July meeting, and it would be the very epitome
of uncoolness to show up at a NYPHP meeting and give a presentation with
Microsoft PowerPoint, don't you think?

well..... I for one wouldn't trash you for doing that :-)

When I do a talk that isn't interactive (something like one might do 
with powerpoint) I don't even bring a notebook anymore. I carry my 
<insert your favorite brand here, mind ends in TRAX> portable hard 
drive/video player, which plugs into a projector and displays slideshows 
(and it's also a video/mp3 player and "infinite storage" for my camera's 
CF cards). The slides are just image files so they can be just about 
anything....

It's quite another scanerio when you need a php interpreter at the ready...

Personally, I don't like how the output looks (at least on my recent 
Mozilla build with JavaScript turned off, perhaps it looks better in 
other browsers.)

I've brewed my own presentation system and used it for the three 
presentations I gave to the group.  The source code for it is available at

http://cvs.nyphp.org/cvsweb.cgi/nyphp.org/content/presentations/bikesummer/
or 
cvs -d :pserver:nyphp at cvs.nyphp.org:/repo co nyphp.org/content/presentations/bikesummer

One really nice thing about it is the keyboard navigation (ALT-X takes you 
to the next slide).  The auto-generated table of contents helps too.

Enjoy,

--Dan

pres2 is the presentation system, whereas presentations are the
presentations. Think of pres2 as a DVD player and presentations as the
DVDs.

I've seen some very good presentations given with PowerPoint. A friend of
mine goes through an average of 150 slides for a 45 minute talk, because
he does things like highlight specific bits of code while he's talking.
The lack of interactiveness can be overcome with some carefully-prepared
examples, in my opinion.

At ApacheCon, Theo Schlossnagle was showing me his Keynote slides. That
seems like a better product than PowerPoint for the static slides
approach, but it only runs on Mac.

There's a couple of interesting articles in today's NY Times about HP's
upcoming announcement on support for MySQL and JBoss.

... and it's about time.

HP hardware has always been open source friendly (unlike, say, Dell) but 
their corporate policies since the Compaq meger have been a turnoff.

So now we have Sun, IBM, Apple, and HP supporting open source... when 
will Sony finally come around?

Yeah, good stuff at MySQL... big buzz about this last week.  This could
be a significant move, since one of the lacking aspects has been a
certified app server platform, based strictly on open source.

Not 100% but I think you need to escape the escape when using double
quotes...

echo "php" | sed "s/php/\\\/"
