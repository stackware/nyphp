No.  dlopen() is a powerful feature of the language, and with power comes ability.  When you load an extension into Apache/PHP, you would hope it could read the memory of that process; otherwise, it'd be pretty useless.

It's a real shame that securityfocus blindly registers this as a vulnerability.  I've emailed them twice, questioning who it was that actually submitted this, and whether they reviewed this as a true security hole.  I haven't heard from them yet.  Furthermore, if you dig on the internet for the author's name (who, I might add, doesn't supply any valid contact information) it becomes quite clear that it's some kid who just wanted to get their name on securityfocus.com.

I'd continue to be wary of securityfocus.com's claims, as this type of behavior isn't an isolated incident.
