<PRE>Hi all,
I apologise if these questions are too broad in scope, but I'm working 
on redesigning a medium-sized e-commerce web application written in PHP 
with a Postgres database. I've already decided on the frame work 
(MVC-type model based on the Phrame project using smarty for the view, 
objects for my business model and a php file as the controller), but 
there are a lot of other pieces I'm still considering and the same 
question keeps coming up.. &quot;Is this just overkill or will it help with 
maintainability, reusability, etc.?&quot;

Some of these questions are as follows:
1. I'll be using Pear's DB abstraction layer, but am still wondering 
about a database class to encapsulate my sql, querying the db, and data 
retrieval.  I've seen libraries (like DB_DataObject) which create a 
class for each table (with that table's columns as its class attributes) 
that extend a base class which has functionality for building sql for 
simple selects updates and deletes. I like this idea, but it seems to 
get pretty squarely when it comes to joins and more complex queries. I'm 
wondering if any of you have had a good experience with DB_DataObject or 
similar libraries. My alternative is to have hard-coded sql and database 
calls within each script, which seems like a poor choice.

2. I've also seen &quot;form&quot; classes to handle form elements and data 
validation for all html forms (think oohforms, and others). This is a 
little bit more difficult to implement when using Smarty templates, but 
still possible. However, with only about 10-20 forms on the entire site, 
it seems like it's potential overkill. Does the group have any opinions 
about the best way to handle forms?

3. Lastly is a question that's specific to my frame work (the MVC 
model). The Phrame project includes a huge array used to map the user's 
request to an action. Although this provides a loose coupling between 
requests and actions, which would be good for extensibility, it seems 
like a pain to have to build and maintain this array. Alternatively, I 
could just assume a 1-to-1 relationship between requests and actions. Do 
any PHP/MVC gurus have an opinion about this?


Also, if anyone has any general tips for designing profesional-grade web 
applications that they'd like to share, please do so.

-Rob
