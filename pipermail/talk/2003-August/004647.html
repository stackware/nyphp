<PRE>Alternatively, I found the EZSQL product I mentioned in my previous note to
be a bit &quot;biggie-sized&quot; for a quick job. So, I might suggest this from the
great people at Wrox.

In the book &quot;Professional PHP 4&quot;, Chap 17, they build a q quickie class for
PHP to MySQL only. Then give you lots of sample PHP code to execute it with.
You can get the sample code for the entire book from their site Or you can
go to: <A HREF="http://www.pswebcode.com/downloads/">http://www.pswebcode.com/downloads/</A> where the only the database class
and all the sample PHP files are zipped.

Okay. Yeah, the other response was just good  talk. 

But, here is response to your topic.

A php class that does every kind of db access (select, update, etc) (on
every db type: mysql, postgres, oracle) and has it all knocked down to a
couple of terse functions. Lots of documentation too:

back to the subject, I'm not looking for database management / deisgn /
access type tools, I'm looking for something (classes, packages, products)
that will allow me to concentrate my php programming efforts on the business
logic, and not spend so much time creating the &quot;plumbing&quot; for basic database
operations such as create a new row, edit a row, read a row or delete a row.

phplens is the closest to what I want that I've found so far. Has anyone
here ever used it or heard anything about it ? (other than what's on the
phplens site and the php|arch &quot;review&quot; )

Thanx
Ophir

I have used NaviCat also, and liked it very much.  Right now, I am using a
product from EMS that I also find very nice.  It has all the standard
features a MySQL GUI needs, is lightweight, and user friendly.  Overall, a
very nice tool.

On this topic, I have recently been using a product called NaviCat found at
<A HREF="http://www.mysqlstudio.com/">http://www.mysqlstudio.com/</A>

Provides very nice graphical interface on MySQL servers, including
import/export data transfer of tables and/or whole databases from server to
server, backup and user management. Exposes SQL schema code that makes up
tables. Run queries from Query window.

30-day full-functioning demo.

Hey Ophir,

One thing I've found that dramatically helps me deal with database issues is
a good database design tool to help me visualize what's going on.  I found
something recently that I really like, CaseStudio:

<A HREF="http://www.casestudio.com">http://www.casestudio.com</A>

After a couple of hours learning the demo Lite version, I bought it. The Pro
version has a reverse engineering feature that logs into an RDBMS and
creates a model from an existing database.  I demoed this as well and found
a couple of things I should have been doing to optimize my digest archive.
Supports MySQL 4 and PosgreSQL 7.x too.
