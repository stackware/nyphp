Turns out the dbg people are NuSphere as it seems. Anyhow, after digging 
around on the NuSphere website I came across the sales page that lists 
quite different prices. They currently have a promo that ends tomorrow 
and anyone evaluating their apps gets a 10% coupon. I then looked deeper 
into the various things that differs in Standard vs. Pro version. I took 
the advice to heart that less is often more and went with the standard 
version that clocks in at 53$ after promo and coupon. That is a fair 
price for a quite nice environment.
I worked with it this afternoon and really like it, especially the 
debugger that works &quot;VisualStudioish&quot;. One nice thing is also that if 
the script generates a PHP error it instantly stops the script at the 
offending line and turns into debug mode. That's sweet! The only beef I 
had so far with it is the quite crippled PHP version that comes with it. 
I replaced it with the one from the Luckasoft IDE and only had to change 
the dbg dll entry to match the file name and version.
I save you all the ooohs and aaahs and write it up nicely with a 
comparison between the IDEs I tried and tested with my opinion.


Thanks for all your pointers and hints. Although I didn't go with 
anything that got proposed, I tried most of it and it helped me a great 
deal to separate the lights from the darks and go with something that 
really suits my needs and wallet.


David
