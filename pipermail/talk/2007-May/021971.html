OK, here is my report back. Generally, NuSphere, WaterProof, and 
Luckasoft have about the same feature set. The big difference is the 
debugger implementation. Luckasoft uses the free dbg, WaterProof uses 
XDebug, and NuSphere the commerical dbg.
XDebug doesn't require stopping at the start of every script, but blows 
up after hitting a rather harmless header(&quot;location:.... redirect. I use 
  those all over the place to send the client to different places after 
the user made a decision as to what he/she wants to do.
The only one debugger that doesn't have to run in hiccup mode and 
doesn't get confused by a redirect is the commercial dbg....exclusively 
for NuSphere. :( That may explain the price tag.
WaterProof's PHPEd also comes with a personal license. One can write to 
WaterProof and explain why one needs a PHP IDE for free and depending on 
their good will one gets a personal license for free. Nice move!

So, the conclusion so far is, unless I can come up with the 300$ for 
NuSphere there isn't any reason to change IDEs...at least not on 
Windows. Really disappointing and not because I want a pro IDE for free 
or on the cheap. If I'd have the bucks I'd buy NuSphere in a heartbeat, 
but you know, they don't pay much for a tech writer.Next try is to bug 
the dbg people.


Gee, this rapidly inhales!

David
