Actually SquirrelMail is pretty good at this. I just searched my
Spam folder with 1600 messages in it for the word 'incredible' in the
Subject+Body and got 17 results in less than 5 seconds. I don't know if
it's issuing a server side search command but SquirrelMail and IMAP are
on the same host.

But if you're just searhing for a ticket number you could also limit the
search to the Subject line. And closed tickets could be moved to a
'Closed' folder so the search might also be limited by folder.

Overall I'm not really clear as to why you think performance would
be a problem. There would be nothing happening that you wouldn't do with
a regular mail client and AFAIK IMAP servers are supposed to be able to
handle a large number of users.

&gt;<i> I'm not saying it's not crazy, but it is fun to think about. Until

</I>
True but I suspect someone could do the same on any ticket system.

Clearly an &quot;IMAP server as the ticket database&quot; ticket system would not
be ideal for everyone. But I think it would be ideal for me since 90%
of the time I would just want to handle tickets as email.
