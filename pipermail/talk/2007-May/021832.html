</I>    Sometimes you can process UTF-8 without doing anything special.  For 
instance,  if you want to pull some text out of a MySQL database and 
display it on a web page,  you can pass the UTF-8 text through without 
using mbstring in PHP:  the one thing you need to do is set the 
character encoding of the HTML document to UTF-8.

    A big strength of UTF-8 is that UTF-8 is compatible with US-ASCII;  
all US-ASCII characters are the same in UTF-8.  This means that you can 
explode on &quot;,&quot;,  &quot;\t&quot;,  &quot;\n&quot; or a space just like you always do.

    Any regex on Unicode 'characters' can be translated to a regex that 
works on UTF-8 bytes.  This may be awkwards sometimes,  but it can be an 
efficient way to do many operations,  including those that &quot;get under 
the hood&quot; of your language.

    Avoid unnecessary character conversions.  If you can take UTF-8 in,  
process it as UTF-8,  and output UTF-8,  that's really the best.  People 
who work with languages like Java,  that do character conversions for 
you,  often find they're not in control of their character conversions.  
Years ago I discovered that the contents of a postgres database were 
double-encoded...  The bytes that made up the first UTF-8 encoding were 
treated as iso-latin-1 characters,  and re-encoded in Unicode...  If 
you're working with Unicode,  you'll probably need to deal with problems 
like this from time to time.

    The main weakness of UTF-8 is that it's a variable-length encoding.  
That means it's hard to pick out the N'th character of a string.  
mbstring has a function that lets you do this,  but be careful how you 
use it.  Getting the N'th character of a UTF-8 string is an O(N) 
operation,  and iterating over the whole string is O(N^2)...  Ouch.  
Efficient algorithms for UTF-8 tend to work sequentially -- and quite a 
few of them can be translated to string algorithms over the bytes.

    There's no substitute for understanding how Unicode and UTF-8 and 
related representations work -- if you work with it enough,  you'll see 
all kinds of malformed text and you'll need to be able to deal with it.
