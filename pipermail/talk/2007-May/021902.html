<PRE>Hello,

David, great points.

The stuff im building utilizes an activeX component to read into .STL 
(cad/cam) files
and actually display a picture of what the part looks like.

That code was written by someone else and Im just piggy backing off the 
modules
ability to draw a 3D image of the .STL file.

The zip is a good idea, its something to ask my client about. Right now,
the need is to allow users to upload multiple files and then display a
picture of what each part looks like. Zip is a good.

Thanks for the thoughts.

- Ben

</I>&gt;<i> I just came across this and went the ZIP file route. User creates a ZIP

</I>&gt;<i> (after I was told that I have more than a hammer and that not everything

</I>&gt;<i> is easy to address), and the file size can be big (several MB, but that is 
</I>&gt;<i> also somewhat easy to address). It also requires a user that is capable of 
</I>&gt;<i> using a ZIP tool and locating the resulting file.
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage is clearly that it doesn't require any JS, AJAX, Flash or 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever else, but works with a plain simple HTML browse box. Also, since 
</I>&gt;<i> the archive has a directory you know exactly which files and folders you 
</I>&gt;<i> get and where they are located after unpacking. That saved me from getting 
</I>&gt;<i> complicated and parsing through a bunch of unknown territory. You can also 
</I>&gt;<i> check the contents first and decide if there is anything in the archive 
</I>&gt;<i> that is useful for the purpose without handling the individual file. Hmmm, 
</I>&gt;<i> I should add this to my project.... In any case, this solution doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> require fancy tools, the code needed is a few dozen lines, and all 
</I>&gt;<i> components involved are for free and exist on many systems. For what I 
</I>&gt;<i> want and can do this is the best solution.
