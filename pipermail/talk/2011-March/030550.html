If that is the case, then change it -- I don't see a problem. I do 
see a problem IF one wants to keep both email addresses as indexes 
for that record. An index must be unique.

The main point here is that you must have a unique identifier for 
each record. Some way to access *that* record. You may choose 
anything you wish -- such as: email address, social security number, 
time of record entry with a random extension, or an auto-increment 
id. The choice is yours, but the final choice should be unique. You 
must be able to find the record without ambiguity.

</I>
No, you are misunderstanding what a &quot;primary key of a record&quot; of a 
record is -- it is simply unique. As said before, it can be anything 
you want provided that it is unique.

</I>
You are misunderstanding the process. There is no &quot;update [of] all 
related records&quot; -- you are simply changing a single record. That 
record contains all data necessary for that record including all keys 
to remote tables -- there is *NO* reason to change any remote key.

</I>
Normalization of a database is simply moving redundant data to remote 
tables and replacing that data with remote keys to those tables, as I 
demonstrated in my last post.

People can often over-think this process. but it is a very simple concept.

Cheers,
