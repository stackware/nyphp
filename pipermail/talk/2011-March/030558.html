<PRE>I think most mom and pop biz use a shared hosting provider, so their site
would be stitting on a server with 100 copies of Wordpress or whatever;
therefore those 100 installs need to be optimized.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am no longer convinced that the cpu cycles saved by using a numeric id

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> space....and your likely going to want to stick the user mapping data into a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cache in memory somewhere anyway, so the time saved is not that big of a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> deal.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     It's not cpu cycles that matter here,  but I/O bandwidth,  seek time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  and RAM for cache on your  database server.  Although MySQL in an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impressive product,  it's remarkably easy to put enough data into a database
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that you'll have performance problems,  particularly if you're importing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data from public sources or if you develop a successful community site.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I highly doubt that unless you are Facebook, Google, or Amazon that you can
</I>&gt;<i> put enough &quot;user records&quot; into your database for this to matter.  Note, I am
</I>&gt;<i> specifically referring to the user table - not any other bit of data but
</I>&gt;<i> where you need to identify a user uniquely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see no point in placing the added burden of using integer identifiers for
</I>&gt;<i> userids on all applications in order to accomodate &quot;but what if someone has
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of thousands of users or more!&quot; - if they have hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of users, they can afford customizing - why should everyone else
</I>&gt;<i> pay for those few people's convenience?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do I mean by &quot;pay&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take any mysql application used by a mom and pop store.   For whatever
</I>&gt;<i> reason, there is no canned report to retrieve some aspect of data from a
</I>&gt;<i> table[could be the order table, could be the payment table, or here is one
</I>&gt;<i> that often occurs, the SHOPPING cart table to see how many abandoned
</I>&gt;<i> shopping carts there are].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a plethora of tools that the owner of the data can use to view
</I>&gt;<i> the data, Navicat, PHPMyAdmin, export it to CSV and look in excel, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> And the data tends to be very nicely laid out so it the primary bits are
</I>&gt;<i> understandable.....and then you come to &quot;what actual person did this?&quot; - and
</I>&gt;<i> it all breaks down.  Sitting there is some number....  Now suddenly from
</I>&gt;<i> viewing an individual table[which is easy] the person needs to join and link
</I>&gt;<i> the data to another table.   So he has to pay a programmer everytime he
</I>&gt;<i> wants a report to figure out these linkages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So all the little websites of the world pay a premium just so that open
</I>&gt;<i> source applications can say their &quot;scalable&quot; and that the few big businesses
</I>&gt;<i> which could have afforded to pay to tune the system don't have to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That to me is a poor business decision.  Making many other people pay so
</I>&gt;<i> that your code can be &quot;scalable&quot; and &quot;good coding practices&quot; and &quot;well
</I>&gt;<i> engineered&quot; is not the sign of a good coder - it's the sign of an artistic
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what happens if you do it the other way around?  What if you put the
</I>&gt;<i> users name in every one of those records and used that as the key?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, performance for those little sites doesn't take any significant hit.
</I>&gt;<i>  On the rare occassion that someone wants to change their name, you do have
</I>&gt;<i> to either go and change it in every existing table - or you have to maintain
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of history table that you can link through so the program can say:
</I>&gt;<i> This order was placed on December 15th at 2:00pm and at that time, the
</I>&gt;<i> userid garyamort referred to the user who is garyamort today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, for the mom and pop's of the world, take the hit and update it in
</I>&gt;<i> all tables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a different paradigm.  Throwing &quot;art&quot; out the window and replacing it
</I>&gt;<i> by practicality.  Of course, it also means &quot;know your market&quot;.  If you are
</I>&gt;<i> coding a specific app for a specific person who is planning on growing
</I>&gt;<i> exponentially, then designing something for him which has to be changed
</I>&gt;<i> later is a poor choice.  But if your making an app for tens of thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> people to use - make simplicity for the end user the driving force.   Do
</I>&gt;<i> stupid ass things that would never scale....and then note what they are and
</I>&gt;<i> how you change it[if you scale past 10,000 users convert all usernames to
</I>&gt;<i> integer keys and always use the aliases table.... here is the high level
</I>&gt;<i> overview on how to do it.  if your not a coder, make it your business model
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to afford to pay for a coder when you reach that point.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key point, for me, is it should not be so difficult for me to change an
</I>&gt;<i> application so email addresses can be used instead of usernames.  Or to make
</I>&gt;<i> it possible for multiple usernames to use the same email address.  Or to
</I>&gt;<i> change the rules on usernames to allow different charectors.   And truely,
</I>&gt;<i> it is easy to make that change for the one bit of core code....it's tracking
</I>&gt;<i> down all those other bits of code that worked on the assumption of those
</I>&gt;<i> rules...merely because those where the rules....that I find troublesome....
</I>&gt;<i>   and it bothers me greatly to charge for this coding time because I am
</I>&gt;<i> basically fixing the mistaken design decisions made by people who are
</I>&gt;<i> applying rules by rote.  &quot;Always use an auto-incrementing primary id&quot;
