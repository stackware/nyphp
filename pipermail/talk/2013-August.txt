I don't think I've seen a discussion of this. What is your favorite
PHP debugger? What do you find works best for stepping through your
PHP code while under development?

I use a Mac, and Codebug and MacGDBp are pretty good. I've been meaning to
try SublimeXdebug, but somehow haven't yet. I actually gave a talk on this
(among other things) at OSCON last week :)

I use zend studio with either zend debugger in zend server or xdebug.

xdebug + Netbeans are a good combination, as long as you don't need to
debug any application that uses rewrite rules

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL HA + Xen
Message-ID: <CAGVtho6aOY-k9m24MGCPUaFVu5Aaf+U9-VUnUwgx5Y3PTXdYbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I have several MySQL servers that are mission critical to operations
including an API server that processes incoming Internet orders.  Looking
for the best option for HA.  Currently using Heartbeat with MySQL
replication.  Open Source solutions are preferred -- as I really don't want
to deal with Oracle licensing!

Also, what is the consensus on using a virtual server (Xen) for MySQL?
Thought the excessive I/O would make this a serious problem.  The Xen
server is configured with ZFS SAN and bonded interfaces for 4gb bandwidth.

If you don't have either of the above servers, what are you using to handle
similar issues and how much do you pay if anything?  Outsourcing is an
option but from my experience if there is a problem here, it is impossible
to get anyone on the phone.  Also, to protect against liability, all
outsources make it clear there are no guarantees on up-time.

Many thanks,
Nick

The only scale I know of is "beginner/expert"...  Studies show that for 
beginners, productivity and code quality increase dramatically when they 
adhere to a set of code quality rules, version control guidelines, etc 
as agreed upon by the expert coders in the group.

At the same time, productive and code quality DECREASES dramatically for 
the expert programmer when they are asked to adhere to those same rules.

Can you provide a link to that study? I've never heard that, and my gut
says it's folk wisdom that "experts" use to justify their behaviour.

Neither quality not productivity decrease in any way if developers adhere to 
code quality rules, version control guidelines, and good programming and code 
commenting practices in general. Yes, the expert coder might be able to throw 
something together that works well, but how does that look three months later 
when a different developer needs to extend or fix that code? I hear it every 
day, developers complaining about each others code as being convoluted and 
unreadable - except for one developer's code. He meticulously sticks to all 
the rules and guidelines the team agreed to and adds copious amounts of 
commentary, so much and so clearly written that even I (non-developer) can 
easily follow. Unfortunately, he just quit, but none of the other developers 
had any issues with picking up where he left off.
There is no excuse for not adhering rules, guidelines, and agreements and the 
claim that ignoring all that improves productivity for expert developers in 
the long run is a myth. At least going by my almost 20 years in QA and quality 
related fields.

I'd think that the scales of competency for programming languages are similar 
to those of natural languages. So can you express what is needed in code and 
can others with little effort understand it? Further, can you read and 
understand the code of others assuming they do not use some slang or shorthand 
that only few comprehend?
