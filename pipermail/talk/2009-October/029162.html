<PRE>Hey guys, I hope this isn't too off-topic, as I'm sure there's a few people
here who are in the self-employment arena that can shed some advice.

As a prefix, I'm going to assume no one is a lawyer and such won't hold you
accountable (unless you otherwise say I can).

I've been doing some side web development over the past 6 months with a
designer and things are going great, and we seem to be getting clients at a
great pace.  Obviously, the question is arising as to whether or not we
should LLC our &quot;group&quot; and make things official and to prevent losing
everything we own, and to look more professional.  However, I've heard
conflicting things about what to do.

I was always under the impression that LLC was the way to go, but now I
might not be so sure.  What are the rules to getting an LLC?  Do I need an
address in the state I registered the LLC in for it to work?  Does the LLC
need an official bank account in order for the checks to be cashed / money
to be transferred?
 How do the taxes work if there's 2 members of the LLC?

I'm very curious about how this all works!

Thanks in advance,
Brian O'Connor
