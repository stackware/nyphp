Hi Nate,

Yep, I'm still a beginner. Thanks for the suggestions--they are indeed
helpful.

Yesterday I ended up going to Security in PHP Projects, then I tried the
Zend Framework tutorial, which quickly went over my head. I ended up
switching over to the Code Review talk after the break (I didn't have
time to check the list Saturday night, so I didn't see you
recommendation). A good deal of that was over my head also, but I
understood the points they were making and the speakers were great. They
were also very patient in addressing my beginner questions/frustrations.

I'll definitely report back on how it goes.

Bev
