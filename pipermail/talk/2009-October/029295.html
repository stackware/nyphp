</I>&gt;<i> A couple of points:

</I>&gt;<i> You say a framework is opinionated (fair comment) but that to me

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Glue&quot; is certainly right, but its really a library of components - how

</I>&gt;<i> is how they're often used. If you like gluing things together, that might
</I>&gt;<i> be OK. But it also brings up the issue of long-term maintenance, when you
</I>&gt;<i> have to hand the code over to someone else that has a different idea of
</I>&gt;<i> how things should be structured. While a lot of frameworks have a common
</I>&gt;<i> layout that facilitate easier maintenance by different developers, most
</I>&gt;<i> also allow you to tweak and customize a little, so they are not as rigid
</I>&gt;<i> as seems to be implied.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing is, despite being full stacks, many frameworks can be
</I>&gt;<i> scaled up and there are many options to tweak that. You can switch off
</I>&gt;<i> layers you dont want to use (like maybe you dont want to use an ORM or
</I>&gt;<i> you want to swap in a lighter component). Many frameworks have a lots of
</I>&gt;<i> options for caching functions, templates, etc. You would have to build
</I>&gt;<i> that yourself if you want to glue something together with components.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are many large sites using frameworks, so your comments about
</I>&gt;<i> scalability and performance might be a bit off. Frameworks require much
</I>&gt;<i> more learning to get the best out of them, this is why picking four
</I>&gt;<i> frameworks and bulding a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; page merely scratches the
</I>&gt;<i> surface and cannot be regarded as a serious testdrive, but these
</I>&gt;<i> unoptmized experiences are sadly often used as benchmarks to pick!
</I>
You just made me re-read my own article, as you make it sound I said
things I didn't. And that makes me nervous that other folks would
misunderstand as well.

This article is about the different types of frameworks, and only
cites a few as examples for reference. I have no idea what your
talking about regarding benchmarking frameworks with a typical &quot;Hello
world!&quot; test app. Lastly performance was specifically mentioned as a
challenge with scaffold frameworks, and as a strength with glue
frameworks.

You sure you read the right blog post Ajai?
