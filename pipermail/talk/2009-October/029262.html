What a small world - I was a morning speaker and talked a little about
Dojo and Thin Server Architecture; and might have met some of you
while hanging out...

As always, the devil's in the details. You have to balance the
advantage of having a CMS that gets love from an active community
(free updates and maintenance) versus the flexibility of a do it
yourself approach (which would call rather for a framework like Zend
or KohanaPHP).

Joomla is a great platform, as long as what you are doing can be done
within Joomla. You start to lose the benefits of a full platform when
you start coding outside of it, which you obviously noticed ;-)

To take advantage of a full platform like Joomla you do need to
approach your implementation the Joomla Way(TM), otherwise consider
eschewing a CMS and go one level lower to a glue framework that gives
you the flexibility you need.
