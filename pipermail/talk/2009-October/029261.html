<PRE>OK, So thank you so much for the input, but now here's the funny part 
Mitch....the first prototype site that we somewhat inherited and are 
completely redoing from scratch (nearly), used a combination of Joomla 
and PHP :-))  This was less to get away from anything in particular, 
just that we know a lot more about what we need to do now and the 
business is smart enough to let us do the right thing (so rare these 
days). 

There are some great things about Joomla, but the site implementation 
felt somewhat schizophrenic in that there was the Joomla half and the 
PHP half.  I'm sure there's better ways to integrate between the two 
than was done, but we had no deep expertise in Joomla and managing the 
site between/across dev, staging, preprod and prod, became quite onerous 
with separate instances of Joomla on dev, preprod and prod.  Felt almost 
like it was defeating the whole purpose of a CMS.

As we're at the beginning stages of spec'ing out the new site, nothing 
is off the table, and maybe there is a clean way to integrate Joomla 
into Zend (and this is a consideration), but it seems like a lot of 
overhead for things we just don't need....ergo trying to do a more clean 
break between the style (handled through Zend) and the content (handled 
through ?).  The challenge with most of the tools/frameworks out there 
is that they want to make building a site as easy as possible which 
usually means mashing the 2 together.  But there always seems to be that 
point of diminishing returns where you start spending more time on the 
work arounds than you ever saved in the beginning - ahh the trade-offs.

Anyway - really appreciate the input and the team here had not heard of 
the other suggestions that were made, but are now looking at and 
evaluating.  Thank you, this really is a great group and think I (or my 
team) may have even met some of you at Code Works 09 in Manhattan.  
We're going to try and get down to the next local meeting if we can 
(we're in CT).
