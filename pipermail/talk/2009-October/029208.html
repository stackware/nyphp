Hi Allen,

Every year or so I just go to Best Buy and get a cheapo desktop with
gigabit ethernet and as much RAM as possible. You can probably find an
ASUS or ACER for $600, you don't pay shipping, you get instant
gratification and it's easy to take back if there's something wrong
with it. They're usually super ugly (like a chrome-plated Star Trek
shuttle craft) but the only technical concern I would have is Linux
hardware support. Sometimes the cheapo machines have very new and
unusual hardware that Linux doesn't quite support yet. But knowing
this I always just get something with an Intel chipset with everything
onboard. Meaning get Intel video, Intel network, Intel usb, etc. One
time I got a machine that didn't recognize the network card. It was
some obscure Realtek or some such. I had to download a driver form
their site and build it. Otherwise, the cheapo Best Buy machines have
always just worked great for me.

Incidentally I usually also try to get a 64 bit CPU with Intel VT or
AMD-V capability so that I can run 64 bit guests in VMWare Server.
This is important for testing all of the different flavors of OS. If
someone says your thing doesn't work on Vista SP-this with IE that,
then you can replicate that exactly without too much trouble.

Mike
