<PRE>Hi Everyone,

I'm going to the CodeWorks conference this weekend and was just taking a
look at the final lineup of tracks that'll be offered.

<A HREF="http://cw.mtacon.com/schedule/city/new-york">http://cw.mtacon.com/schedule/city/new-york</A>

Since it's not required that I stick to one track, I'm going to jump
around. For the most part I chose things that I want to know more about,
but in some cases (the ones preceded by asterisks below) I'm not at all
sure what to go for. I don't want to waste time attending something
that's going to be totally over my head, but OTOH I don't want to miss
something important just because I'm too inexperienced to realize it's
important, y'know?

I'd appreciate any advice you can offer on what might be most beneficial
for me at this stage. Also, if you think that the choices I DID make
might not be optimal, kindly let me know that also.

Thanks,
Bev
