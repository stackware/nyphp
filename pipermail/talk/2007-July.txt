Exactly that's what I tried telling you :-D. Of course the HTTP Client 
(=user) does not connect to mysql it's the PHP script, but the PHP 
script gets executed when the client makes a request and regardless how 
many requests he makes the PHP Script/Mysql does not know that this user 
has already been here. That's what I wanted to tell you as I thought 
that you thought that persistent connections mean that for every user a 
new connection is opened and that each connection corresponds to a user 
and is kept open for e.g. 30 minutes, but that's not true.

Anyway, it seems to mean that you got it now and that's actually 
everything that counts.

I believe the latest version of PHP Mailer takes care of this problem. (Ver
1.73 is the latest and this was addressed in 1.72).

It should also be noted that connections will automatically timeout, so you
don't technically need to close it (though it's a Good Idea (tm)). With
pconnect, PHP *should* reopen the connection if it's timed-out on MySQL's
end.

As for me, I always close doors after I travel through them -- just a 
force of habit. I don't open files, take what I need and then not 
close them. Likewise, I don't open a dB without also closing it after 
I get what I need. I may do that several times in a single script and 
I know there is a bit of overhead cost in doing that, but always 
knowing that I closed the door means something to me. Besides, 
computers are getting faster than I can adapt anyway, so I'll keep my 
old habit.

Cheers,

tedd

Hey, just an aside for everyone.

I always had my DB close statement as the last line of my scripts. Then one
day, everything stopped working properly. Why?

Seems right -- when you're done you're done -- right? Wrong. PHP does plenty
of "stuff" after your script is finished.

Remember -- if you use database-base sessions, use session_write_close
BEFORE you close your DB connection. And you probably want to use
session_write_close before any header redirects as well to eliminate timing
issues.

Thanks for pointing this out. I will add it to my scripts as I make 
frequent use of header redirects, they are just so effective.

Although I should know if I use database-based sessions, I am not sure 
as I am not sure what exactly a database-based session is. So, what is that?

Standard PHP sessions are stored in flat files on the server. Not conducive
to scale-out as the session is local to a specific server, and there can be
security issues in a shared hosting environment. One alternative is to store
your sessionz in a database.

See: http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php

Aha! So, if I'd have multiple servers and want to carry a session from 
one server to the next I could do so via a database assuming that the 
servers each have access to it. Now that's clever!
Writing to each own's database will keep the session stuff separated for 
shared hosting. Good to know.

And again, NYPHP in persona of Cliff Hirsh made me a smarter person.

Thanks!

Unfortunately your script allows anyone to log in, because you're not
escaping user input before sending it to MySQL.

If $_POST['Password'] is "foo' OR '1'='1", the query will always
return a result, and the user will be logged in.

Please always remember to use mysql_real_escape_string() on
user-submitted values before using them in a MySQL query.

Perhaps your application is deployed in an environment that has
magic_quotes turned on, in which case it won't be vulnerable to the
example attack, but it is considered bad form to rely on that feature.

Just FYI, CakePHP allows you to switch between flat-file and database  
driven sessions with a single configuration setting. ;-) It also  
allows you to drop in additional session storage engines.

Persistent connections need to be used with care.

The following article explains some problems:
http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2006/11/12/are-php-persistent-connections-evil/

Additionally, the default configurations for PHP, Apache and MySQL don't
lend themselves well to persistent connections. One disparity that will bite
you in the end is the default timeout to close the connection. MySQL's
default timeout is 8 hours. The expected environment is a desktop client
that will re-use the same connection again and again. HTTP does not work the
same way. If you wind up with several orphaned connections to the DB server
they will just sit around waiting for nothing until the connection times
out. This will use up all your available connections.

Another configuration issue is the number of MySQL connections need to match
the number of threads/processes configured for Apache.

http://us.php.net/manual/en/features.persistent-connections.php
"You are probably using a multi-process web server such as Apache. Since
database connections cannot be shared among different processes a new
one is created if the request happen to come to a different web server
child process."

Im all for showcasing new stuff but it should be out of the !core!

         throw new Zend_Date_Exception('Calendar class yet not

I was not expecting that folder to be there when I downloaded the

That's just one of a number of things that some people are upset about. And
it does have its learning curve, and there are some apparent oddities that I
do not grok. And yet, still, in my ever so humble opinion, this is the FW
that looks most promising. The MVC is idiot-simple to set up, and it's easy
to take pieces a la carte -- you aren't bound to adopt a whole monolithic
package. Of course lots of FWs claim this flexibility but this one really
does seem pretty loose. The documentation, while not bug-free or beyond
criticism, is extensive and detailed. There are lots of tasty classes with
tons of power and convenience.  I like.

It might depend on the setting for ignore_user_abort, if that's off, and the

Hi!

Is there any (noticeable) difference between using short variable names 
and long ones? I rather use variable names such as $firstnamecounter 
than just $i, $john, or $doe (I've seen code where the developer used 
almost exclusively his first and last name for just about everything).
I try to give each important variable a name that is descriptive and 
unique within my project so that I can name the same thing by the same 
name across multiple scripts.

I just wonder if I should get used to a different naming convention now 
that my projects get more complex.

Usually I like to give my variables descriptive names, but in the shortest
way possible.

However, with regards to $i being the counter, that's a pretty common coding
practice ($i being used to increment, and usually $j being the next variable
(I believe because its after i in the alphabet but if there's an actual
reason beyond that I'd like to know).  It's used because it's short (one
letter) and almost everybody knows what it does.

I also don't think there's ever a time to just use your first and last name
(or at all, for that matter) as variables, unless somehow those were
descriptive of what they hold (doubtful).

There are, however many standards that people use for variable naming.

camelCasing is one of them (first letter of each 'word' in your variable
name is capitalized except for the first), which I like to use.  Other
people prefer the underscore notation, where each word is seperated by an
underscore (ie my_variable_name).

Other things include Instance variables in classes.  Although not so useful
in PHP (and other languages that require you to prefix instance variables
with something [$this->]), some people prefix instance variables with an
underscore, or sometimes 'm_', for member.

Global variables are usually all capital letters with underscores between
words (MY_GLOBAL_VARIABLE).



These are just some standards however, and there is much debate around them.
Some languages also have different standards than other (C# comes to mind
with function names starting with a capital letter, rather than most that
say start with a lower letter).



The best is really to be able to adapt to different projects if you join
midway, and if you start your own, make sure you're consistent.

Should probably stick w/ Zend coding standards ...

conventions.html#coding-standard.naming-conventions.variables

But I think all you really need to do is answer the question, "If  
someone else were to takeover my code would they understand it @  
first glance".  Ive had people come back to me three or four times  
when I first started PHP and realized time to change the way the code  
looks/feels.  Ehh not to say it still doesn't happen, maybe less  
frequently :-)

Hi All:
I am in the process of creating a php script that adds a item to a database.  This script works fine.  The portion that i am asking assistance for is, after adding the item to the database, I am not sure how to use the i
#insertgoto for the newly added item to be displayed in a view page script.
I looked at dreamweaver on examples, but this from DM is  a bit confusing.
could someone please show an example of using this command in a more simplistic fashion.

Thanks very much

I had a professor back in college who told a story about a program he
received from a student in which each variable was the name of a beer.  The
student had done such a good job documenting it, though, that the purpose of
each variable was easily understood.

To get back on topic, Hungarian Notation is one way of prefixing variables
(does anyone still use it though?).
http://web.umr.edu/~cpp/common/hungarian.html

The important thing to keep in mind is to be consistent in your conventions.
It will make things easier for someone (even you) reading your code.

As far as i goes, I've always assumed it was just shorthand for something
like index or increment.  Nested for loops are often then controlled with j
and then k.  You can use these with confidence that people will understand
the meaning.  But if you feel more comfortable using a variable called
$counter than one called $i, by all means do so.  There are plenty of people
out there who refuse to use i.

The use of variable names like $i, $j, $k, etc for counters is a hold  
over from early Fortran which declared that only variables starting  
with certain letters could be integers. The first letter was "i". I  
seem to remember that only the letters i, j, l, l, m, n were used for  
integer variables, so the use quickly became a "standard" and it's  
been carried over into other languages through the use of examples  
written by old time programmers.

All this time I'd thought it meant 'index' and was specifically to keep
loops short and sweet - and then j, k, etc just incrementally from index.
Thanks for info, Ken.

As for hungarian notation, I have my own similar convention that I try to
use everywhere (php, javascript, actionscript, python, etc).  I picked it up
from the developers at Cuban Council in SF.  A is array, I int, O is object,
etc.  My own addition to their convention is to make array counts an integer
with the same name as the array:

$aEmployees = $oEmployees->getAll();
$iEmployees = count($aEmployees);

May be hard to read for some, as it probably just looks like 4 of the same
variable, but for my own internal cpu, I can see I have 3 related variables
all with their own specific purpose.  It does very well for me, though
everyone has their habits for good or not.

Hey, let's watch those "old programmer" remarks, because some of us 
are still around. But, you are right about the i, j, k, l, m, n 
integer thing as a legacy from FORTRAN. Oh, those were the good old 
days when programming was more like adventures in key punching. Where 
you would drop off a large stack of IBM cards one day and then pick 
up a few reams of paper the next day with all your key punching 
errors.

Not any different today. I write some PHP code and need until the next 
day to figure out all the runtime errors. ;)
I talked today with a developer and the talk came across functions and 
modular code. He thought it is something "new", but I learned about that 
20 years ago programming LOGO on the C64. LOGO is a nice language to 
pick up the basics, but at least the C64 version was more a NOGO. 
Although, the turtle was cute, looked like a triangle...


BUT...back to the original question, does the length of a variable name 
have any impact on performance or such?

Hi.

In older  php versions it does.  Variables with long names was much slower
then with short names. But in php5 i am not sure  if  this problem exists.
And it is very simple to determine, just test it with a small script
accessing short and long variables.

Does the length of variable names have any impact on performance?

I doubt it, but it should be easy enough to prove. Just write two 
routines -- one with short names and one with long and have them run 
a set time (perhaps years) and compare their performance.

Does the length of variable names have any impact on such?

If you're the programmer reviewing/maintaining someone else's code, I 
would say "Yes, it does." Both too cryptic and too long makes code 
difficult to read.

Cheers,

tedd

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Using PHP for a Stand-Alone application
Message-ID: <009d01c7be5a$bb8e55b0$6600a8c0@adam>

Hi All - 

I've developed a web-based audition registration application for musical
organizations (All-State Chorus, Regional Band, etc).  The application has
been well received, but some organizations are too small to benefit from the
web orientation and have asked if the application could be provided in a
single-user version without hosting.

 

I'm exploring how to rewrite the app in PHP5 using sqlite as the backend
database, but haven't figured out how to package the code so that it can be
loaded onto another PC without the need to install and configure an Apache
server for each user.  My prospective clients will not be PC-literate beyond
medium-weight spreadsheet usage.

 

Any and all thoughts are most appreciated!

 

Best Regards - 

 

Rick

There are several stand-alone web servers available for free that are 
optimized to run with PHP. WebSrv from Luckasoft comes to mind, which 
has a nice installer that loads the latest PHP distribution and installs 
it. I am sure that you could package this up or at least create some 
simple documentation for installing the server and your code. If the 
users leave the defaults in place you can create a self-extracting ZIP 
that writes the files to the right place.
You can get the EnginSite WebSrv from here:
http://luckasoft.com/download/websrv.exe

I always use Apachefriend's XAMPP, which installs nicely, but not in a 
way I think a novice can deal with it, but it does not need any 
configuration.

Or, you can make a 'real' desktop application using PHP and GTK (see 
http://gtk.php.net/).

You could also use a real installer such as INNO Setup or the one from 
NullSoft (both freeware IIRC). That puts the burden on you and you need 
to make sure that everything installs right. Or you can make a video / 
simulation showing how to install everything.

HTH,

	David

Not the answer you want, but I would address this as a business model
issue.  Everything that isn't web based today will probably be tomorrow.  If
I'm "reading into" your statement correctly they seem to have an issue with
the hosting cost.  The answer then, is, to reduce or replace the hosting
cost.  Build it into the support costs perhaps.  If they don't want
recurring fees then build it into license cost (with an availability cap of
say, 3 years).  Keeping it web-based will benefit you both in many ways,
including:
- Deployment
- Support (if they have internet access and a web browser it should work, no
PC issues to worry about)
- One code base
- They can access the application anywhere and one day, not too far from
now, they'll want to.
- tons more which I'm sure you've heard before

See above, this is only more work (and a lot more work at that) for you with
no real benefit IMO.  You now have the issues of backups, upgrades, support,
maintenance, security fixes on individual, possibly not-internet-connected
machines for which you probably can't charge for.  The computer-illiteracy
of your clients is even more of a reason to keep it web-based as they don't
want to deal with this stuff, either.

HTH,

Tom

I think its fair to say that PHP is definitely not a standalone  
friendly language, the best effort I have seen is something like Phar  
format but even then you need to bring the kitchen sink to each  
client and its not a format built into PHP itself (shame).

It's sad that there is not anything like a small lightweight portable  
vm you can run around with, there is a project called Slingshot in  
Ruby/Rails which is the idea, a "web browser" with your embedded web  
app.  I think this issue is what Adobe AIR is trying to showcase.

If the code is possibly doable where it is just really data access,  
you might look to port your code to Javascript and the client:   
Firefox with GoogleGears installed.

http://code.google.com/apis/gears/

You can seriously get away with writting a full blown data app w/  
just a single html file and few lines of Javascript.  Im not sure but  
I think trying for a single "master" table and then having some  
mechanism for getting all the "slave" sqlite databases and merging  
(or copy to master) is a piece that is missing for this solution.

While I agree with everything Tom said, if you really *must* have a web
server, check out nanoweb. A web server written in PHP.

Wow, +1. I'm busy trying to wean the .org I work for off of a desktop
app because the deployment and support costs are staggering as
compared to a web business model. Do you really know what you're
getting into deploying to the desktop?

In addition to what Tom said, think through how you will release
critical updates, particularly if they change the database schema. Are
you willing to visit (or at least do remote desktop sessions with)
each of your clients to handle the details? What if they customize the
app between upgrades?

These issues crop up with web deployment as well, obviously, but one
deployment on a server (and one monthly hosting fee) could support
thousands of users.

Hey again,

So, I had a string of interviews over the last two weeks.

I have just hired one candidate that I believe will be a good addition to 
our company.

I ended up using the Joel Spolsky (or whoever coined this) question:

I have two variables and I want to switch their values.

Some candidates totaly froze, and other's got it quickly.

I also showed some source code, a *small* 150L script, and asked them what 
it did.

Not only was it commented, but the function & variable names are extremely 
obvious.
Some looked in awe and said, "this is a small script?" while some took a few 
minutes
and looked over the code, then attempted to explaint to me what it did.

Overall, it was a great experiance. I look forward to finding new talent to 
add to our growing
company.

Thanks for all the responses and feedback!

- Ben

I'd use a third variable to keep a copy of one variable before basically 
making both the same first and then assigning the saved to copy to the 
originally uncopied variable.
Did I get hired?
No! Well, unless you are desparate...
Thanks to Google I now know the answer:
$x = $x xor $y;
$y = $x xor $y;
$x = $x xor $y;

I guess this shows that I have no formal programming training. Although, 
when would anyone want to switch variable values? Just use the one that 
already has the right value. Saves three lines of code! Same amount of 
lines is used with a helper variable, but the xor stuff uses less memory.

Mind sharing that test script with me (us)? I simply want to know how 
good or bad I am.

My record is currently at 761 lines for a script including comments and 
empty lines. I think 150 isn't huge.

Thanks for asking and sharing with us. And for giving a PHP beginner an 
awesome opportunity to pick up some more skill. I wish I could spend 
more time on learning PHP.

Hey again,

"I think 150 lines is huge, I want to do it in two. =D"
heh.

"Although,  when would anyone want to switch variable values? Just use the 
one that
 already has the right value. Saves three lines of code!"

Good point. I just liked the question because it makes them think.

"My record is currently at 761 lines for a script including comments and
 empty lines. I think 150 isn't huge.".

So what did you do in those 761L?

That script I showed is actually:

[sk at tinman dmiid]$ cat mine.php | wc -l
125

Only 125L of code. You can view it here:
http://www.projectskyline.com/phplist/mine.txt

Its a datamining script.

"I wish I could spend more time on learning PHP."
Me too. Right now I'm working through, 'PHP5 Objects, Patterns and 
Practice",
& 'The PEAR Installer Manifesto'. <-- Is pretty neat so far...I'm curious 
about
using phing and the pear channels for distributing applications and 
application
updates. Oh, and not to mention 'Pro PHP Security'.

I should buy some stock in bookpool & Apress! heh.

Made me think, too, because I guessed that the helper variable deal is 
way to obvious to be the desired answer. Besides that, we all do many 
things that have no real purpose.

Grab an image file, check if it is jpg, check if it has exif information 
in it, if yes, grab the exif data, then check against all known keys of 
the exif array and echo those with explanatory text in a table.
There are quite a few keys that can be in the resulting array and I want 
to show only those values that are really there and provide for 
explanatory text. Most exif reader scripts just barf up the content of 
the array and don't bother to format it nice and add the field 
definitions to it. So there are tons of isset checks and several switch()es.
Is there a shorter way? Sure there is. I could parse through the array 
keys and load the definitions from an ini file and add a check for the 
case that the value is yet another array. Why check for 50 keys when the 
array has only three. To my defense, the isset and switch way makes it 
less intellectually challenging covering all the weird array values. 
Some are binary strings (Flash), some are just some wild numbers who 
each mean something different (LightSource), then there is the thumbnail 
image, and so on. That exif array is a total mess and dealing with each 
key separately is just easier. It also allows me to show things like 
picture orientation in a more obvious way. Rather than showing 
"Orientation: 6" I show an image of the letter "F" rotated in the way 
the image is oriented based on exif information. That isn't obvious from 
the image itself, because by the time I show exif information I already 
rotated the image on the fly based on rotation settings that I get from 
the database. Sure, I could use the exif values, but not all cameras 
record orientation. The one that I have doesn't and it is the main 
source of the images, but some other user may have a nicer camera.

It threw me off at the beginning as I think "browser" when thinking PHP. 
That script strikes me to get executed typically from the command line. 
It grabs results from Google searching for files of a particular type 
and stores them in a local folder.
Right?


Thanks for sharing.

I've been following this thread with interest. To a certain point I think
you're going about this in the wrong way. Programming is about
problem solving, it's about syntax, that's the easy part. I good
problem solver can use a book to lean the syntax to code a solved
problem. Someone who aces a programming test because they
have memorized a manual is non necessarily a good problem
solver.

Try this on a candidate.

Write an algorithm (not language specific code) to do the following:

Players is a variable holding the number of players in a single
elimination tournament. If you loose a match, you're out. The
winner is determined when there is no one left to play.

Output the value of Matches which is a variable containing the
number of matches required in the tournament.

On problem that is non-trivial will have multiple solutions, we
want the most efficient.

Resist the temptation to express the algorithm in PHP or any
other programming language.

The algorithm is like:

1. Input Players as the number of players in a single elimination tournament.
...
...
X. Output Matches which is the number of matches required in a single
elimination tournament containing N (Players) players

Hire any candidates who come up with an elegant solution. Then teach
them any syntactic structures they don't know.

BTW, I personally think swapping the contents of two variables without a
temporary variables proves nothing. It's a trick we learned if we studied
assembly language. Tricks do not a good programmer make. When is
the last time you used an XOR is a real program?

I fully agree with that! I worked with many developers and the really 
good ones weren't the ones who knew the latest tricks, but who 
understood the business.

Huh? That is a mathematical, statistical problem of half-life periods. 
IMHO is not that useful unless providing the logic behind it is 
sufficient as an answer.
My objection is about asking for an "efficient solution". I think it is 
much more important to stay with Confucius on this: the way is the goal. 
I'd say that someone who gets this requests and asks for a pen and paper 
to draw a picture is already a good candidate.
Asking for an efficient algorithm and a mathematical approach is 
unfortunately in line how programming gets taught these days. No wonder 
why people rather get MBAs instead of science degrees. Who wants to get 
beaten with the math stick each and every time? Use math and logic if 
common sense fails. I met many engineers who where math experts, but too 
stupid to operate a screw driver. They could design complex machinery 
for a site, but didn't bother checking if the parts would fit through 
the doors. I studied EE and would have enjoyed it more (and probably be 
better at it) if it wasn't always about some integral to be solved first.

I created quite many scripts that are in no way efficient, but they all 
work and I got them to work reliably. When I look at them today I know 
at least a dozen ways on how to improve them and do the same with less, 
but at the core the path to finding the solution remains the same.

I also tried and dealt with many different programming languages and in 
general they are all very similar, excluding machine code and assembler 
(means 'real' programming). They all got their decision structures, they 
all got their output commands, they typically use pointers for files, 
database, etc., they generally all know about arrays. So yes, nailing 
someone on a specific programming language doesn't mean all that much. 
Although in this case knowledge of PHP is key and the more I look at 
that script the more I think it is a good choice. One doesn't even need 
to know anything about OOP in order to figure out what it does. Another 
option is to ask what the steps are to accomplish this data mining process.
One other intriguing problem I came across recently was this:
I have a set of several file folders. They are all numbered 
sequentially. I want to create three independent functions for adding 
one folder, deleting one folder, and moving a folder to a new position 
and each time end with consecutively numbered folders and have those who 
are not affected by the operation keep their names.
Writing the code was somewhat easy after I figured out what I need to do 
and in which order. In my case I also had to sync the changes with a 
database table, so I had to make sure that one thing worked before doing 
the other (I chose to first do the file system stuff, then change the db 
record, but the other way around is as good/bad).

> BTW, I personally think swapping the contents of two variables without a

Exactly! I think that using the temp variable is a good solution even if 
it takes a few bytes more of memory. The days of 64kB RAM are over where 
that really mattered. As long as someone doesn't answer this:
$a = $b;
$b = $a;
it is not a lost cause (but some may even stop after the first line!).
Take my example from above with moving the position of one folder within 
the set of folders. Need to rename one folder first, then complete the 
sequence until the new position for the folder is reached, and then 
rename that folder. In case of two folders I have the same problem as 
asked with exchanging the variable values. So, how do I XOR folders in a 
file system? And how many XORs does it need to accomplish this for the 
likely case of having more than two folders?

IMHO, any test that has a direct practical approach is way better than 
some question about a nifty, but useless trick. In the end interviewing 
and hiring people isn't any different than learning programming. 
Practice makes perfect and one just has to be aware of the fact that not 
everything works out as intended.

Ben:

I hate interviews and I hate test. Both are usually conducted/written 
by people who have less talent/knowledge about the subject than the 
people they expect to hire.

When it comes to programing, what I provide to my employer/client is 
not just me, but rather a collection of experience, knowledge, 
talent, computer, and resources -- it's a package deal.

If you want to test any of those elements separately, then you're not 
testing my capability. You might as well ask my computer if it plays 
well with others.

Solution -- give me a task and time to complete it -- and then review 
my code and let me explain how it works. After all, that's what you 
should be concerned about, right?

Cheers,

tedd

This is trivial:
number of matches required to get a winner = number of players - 1
explanation:
one match eliminates one player
every player but one must be eliminated to have a winner

         That's easy for you to say :-)

         I'm not asking for a mathematical proof, just a logical proof.

         Again, any non-trivial problem will have multiple solutions.

         What is a picture of this problem?

         I don't think you'll see that when we get to the "ideal" solution.

         Let's assume I buy that approach, which I don't. What is the 
logic to solve this
problem?

         Many years ago we learned to flow chart a problem before programming.
It is, unfortunately, a dying skill. In the early 1970s Edsger 
Dijkstra , one of the
great pioneers of computer science, delivered a paper in which he suggested
that the first programming course in a CS curriculum be taught without a
computer. When I first read the paper I though he was nuts. As time has
passed I am now of the opinion that the may was correct.


         Will anyone take the challenge and give the group an 
algorithm to solve
the problem? If you have seen this problem do post it until people 
have a chance
to think.

         I didn't know someone has actually solved the problem when I
posted the last message.

         The answer is elegant, not trivial. I gave this problem to people
in a first programming class over a period of 15 years. Maybe 10
people solved it correctly in the approximately 1,000 students who
took it. Almost everyone did something like.

N = N /2 rounded up.
M = N /2 rounded down.
If N = 1 display Matches

about half tried it with an example of N being a power of two and 
never rounded.
This is an emulation of an actual tournament.

Another variation was:

N = decrement N
M = increment M
If N = 1 display Matches.

         Your answer required a different philosophical approach.
You are asking, how is a looser determined? The above two
approaches ask how is a winner determined?

Yes, exactly, but doesn't demanding an efficient solution mean that only 
one is correct whereas all others are not even if they work fine?

A diagram as shown for the NCAA basketball torunament pairings in the 
sports section of a newspaper. Or in my case the pairings for the German 
soccer cup.

The ideal solution to the problem or the ideal solution to teaching 
programming? Assuming you mean this problem, it ends up to be a 
mathematical problem. My point was that figuring the problem out and 
then crafting the mathematical formula for it is IMHO a better approach 
than to start with a formula and then see if it fits the problem.

Ah, there were several studies done in Europe asking high school 
graduates if they want to study science. Many said no citing the need 
for advanced math skills to be the main reason. I also inquired once 
about the results of the recruiting efforts for engineering students of 
one of the best German universities for science. They even went with a 
"science truck" to high schools showing off all kinds of neat stuff. 
Their efforts fell flat mainly because they told all the school kids 
they have to be good in math to be an engineer. I think that learning 
concepts and guessing right is way more important than learning theories 
and exactly calculating the 10th position after the period.
Maybe it is taught differently around here.

Now, the logic is like this:
Let's start with 4 teams (final four): we get two semifinals and one 
final, which makes for three games.
Let's take 6 teams. First we get three matches and then have three teams 
left. One gets a bye, the two others play, for a current total of four 
matches and two remaining teams, which results into one final game for a 
total of five games.
Now with 5 times four play and one gets a bye, having two matches down 
and three teams left. Two play one game, one gets a bye, for a total of 
three matches, two teams left, which brings a total of four matches.

So far odd and even start numbers as well as odd and even intermittent 
numbers are covered. Shows that the total of games is always one less 
than teams starting. That is something a fanatic, straight thinking ESPN 
watcher can figure out without ever attending any advanced math classes. 
OK, counting and the first rules of arithmetic proof to be helpful, but 
it is assumed that after 4th grade everyone knows that. I count that 
under common knowledge.

See above, I basically proposed a flow chart. And this is how I was 
supposed to learn ANSI C 12 years ago. My flow charts were great, my 
code sucked.

It is coming back to life, but today it is called UML and has flashy 
drag&drop applications. But this is exactly how I was introduced to 
computer programming. My 5th grade math teacher was a computer whiz (an 
Apple IIe specialist) and each exam had at least one task that started 
like this: "Stell' Dir vor Du bist ein Computer..." - Imagine you are a 
computer...
I got Ds in math until I got a female (and pretty) math teacher in 
grades 11-13. My grades went from almost F to A. Whatever does it. ;) 
Even got the BSEE in below average time with an above average grade.
As mentioned earlier, I also got a written warning for bad grades in 
English, now I am a tech writer at a US reasearch foundation. So much 
for concluding anything from test results.

Indeed an interesting discussion!

Urb:

No offense, but I've taught computer programming (and other 
disciplines) and I believe that most people who are taking a course 
in programming have a better than average intelligence.

If I presented a question to 1000 students and had less 10 people 
provide a correct answer over 15 years, then I would be examining the 
question, not questioning the ability of the students. Especially, IF 
the question might had been presented differently would have rendered 
a larger number of correct answers. What did the 990 students learn 
from your question?

As you know, the most important part of any solution is to understand 
the problem.

If I asked you "Why are manhole covers round?" -- would you get the 
answer right away?

Conversely, if I asked what shape would best stop a cover from being 
dropped down a hole? -- would you better understand the problem and 
find the answer quicker?

And most importantly, would you be better off for being asked a 
straight forward question and discovering the answer or a tricky 
question and getting it wrong?  From my perspective, the point is to 
teach, not to confuse.

PS: As for flow charts, never used them and never will. For some 
people it's a complete waste of time, like pen and paper vs the 
keyboard -- I haven't the time to waste to do it twice.

Uhm, just out of curiosity....is that answer wrong (just because Google 
shows it as a result, doesn't mean it is right, but the page I got it 
from gave a plausible explanation)?

Undoubtedly, my skills in software QA, support, and tech writing are 
better than my programming skills.

Well, give it a try in php and see if it works.

But actually, my response was a knee-jerk reaction against code tries
to be clever when simple would work just as well.

Your first instinct, make a copy and then reassign the values, is a
straightforward way to do it. Other developers--web developers--will
immediately understand, and not have to audit your code to figure out
what's happening.

Don't let lack of computer science theory psych you out of being a
good engineer.

Yo! I wouldn't hire myself. Blindly trusting what someone else claims is 
the thing to do isn't clever. I finally did what I should have done 
before posting this: I tried it out and it doesn't work.
But again prooves the point that this test isn't all it should be. The 
help variable approach works and I got that in place much quicker than 
this broken stuff.
The correct answer was posted earlier and is also in the PHP Cookbook on 
books.google.com. Supposedly it enhances clarity, which I doubt it does 
unless one is very intimate with the list() and array() functions.

Ah, I guess I can't talk myself out of having screwed up. LOL

Only if there are no draws.

Was it given that every match had only two players and each match 
resulted in one winner and one loser? If so, I didn't see it.

If draws are allowed, then there is no answer.

If you like these sort of brain teasers, then try taking the LSAT 
sometime. I think you'll find the questions a bit more difficult. 
But, does answering questions like that prove lawyers make better 
programmers? I would like to think not.

David:

Nothing enhances clarity better than familiarity.

True, the answer was noted in the PHP Cookbook on page 120, but the 
point was that I remembered it. I have literally scores of different 
programming books which I read time and time again. Each time, I 
learn and remember something new -- AND where I read it. My books are 
filled with sticky notes sticking out of the pages with dozens of 
things I want to remember.

Even with this list -- every time someone post a routine or a snip-it 
of code to solve a problem, I copy, make an index for it, catalog it, 
list who said it (that's important), and sometimes even make a 
working example so I can reference it later when I run into the same 
problem. I have hundred's or working examples as my reference.

Sure, it's a lot of hard work, but it's necessary if you're going to 
be good at what you do. No profession is easy and what you know, is 
what you sell.

Like the old mechanic who was brought a car that didn't run right. He 
listened to the engine and took a hammer and hit it. Suddenly the 
engine ran like it was new. The customer asked "How much do I owe 
you?" To which the mechanic said "A hundred bucks!" The customer 
replied "That's a lot of money just to hit an engine with a hammer." 
The mechanic replied "No, that only cost a buck -- it was knowing 
where to hit it that cost the most."

Cheers,

tedd

I agree that using xor isn't a very straightforward solution, but I do
like to look for creative, clever solutions:

$foo = $foo + $bar;
$bar = $foo - $bar;
$foo = $foo - $bar;

By the way, I'm hiring. :-)

Hello all,

I'm new to this list but not to PHP. I've been architecting and
developing Web applications and networked software products for about
17 years and have had the good fortune to work for some very
interesting clients such as Nike, BMG Direct, the Chicago Tribune,
Lycos, &c.

 I've also conducted programming skill assessments which resulted in
stronger candidate matches for fast paced projects. However, I've also
interviewed candidates whom I thought were weak technically and poor
choices, but with whom the hiring manager had long-term relationships.
Guess what? Those candidates worked hard, got up to speed, and ended
up being valuable long term investments!

I agree with Urb in that I'd much rather see a third variable for the
value-swapping question than the "xor" which obfuscates the code. Only
in extreme resource duress (embedded systems, PDAs, watch PCs :) would
I resort to obfuscation for optimization, and when I do I always feel
a slight pang of guilt.

Thanks for this resource, and I hope to meet you all when I re-move to
NYC (grew up there, left a decade ago) in July/August!

Regards,

Patricia Ju

Hey Again,

There's been a ton of great comments...I realize that the questions and 
tactics
I used in this interview session may not have been the best, but I have 
learned
a lot through this process, and look forward to doing it again in the 
future.

Someone mentioned asking the candidate to write a solution to a problem
then walk me through their code ... I like this, and I've had to do it in 
the past.
Actually, they just took the source code and told me they would get back to 
me.

I guess I wasn't 100% sure what types of questions would be appropriate, 
since
this is an intern position, and I don't except too much language specific 
knowledge.

I do expect..er want, a smart, hard working person.

"My books are filled with sticky notes sticking out of the pages with dozens 
of
things I want to remember."
heh, mine too!

"Someone who aces a programming test because they have memorized a manual is 
non necessarily a good problem solver."

Very true.

"Write an algorithm (not language specific code) to do the following:"

That's a good idea ... I may give more thought as too what I will ask as a 
problem
solving question in the future. I'll probably do a bit of googling to see 
what
others have asked, and been asked.

"BTW, I personally think swapping the contents of two variables without a
temporary variables proves nothing."

True, I guess I just like to see how quickly, and what way, they solve the 
problem.
*Any* problem will do I suppose.

Thanks again for all the feedback, its been a pleasure reading the replies.

- Ben

That would only work if the variable were an integer. If I remember 
correctly, the variable type was unspecified. ;-)

But this is a PHP list. :-)

list($a, $b) = array($b, $a);

Wow that was a blast from my past.   Now using the stack is kind of like 
using a helper variable but all us Forth programmers know that the stack is 
much more efficient.  Oh yeah not to mention using RPN.  I still use my 20+ 
year-old HP 15C calculator and find it extremely difficult to use a non RPN 
calculator.

Fermi questions are well respected 
(http://mathforum.org/workshops/sum96/interdisc/fermicollect.html), but 
the bottom line is YOU do the hiring and YOU suffer the consequences (or 
reap the rewards). Someone once said "A" people hire "A" people, and "B" 
people hire "C" people :-)

I think the environment has more impact on the development of an 
individual as a worker than the hiring process or the technical skills 
at hire time. So hire accordingly. But hey, that's just me :-)

Hi!

I have an array with numerical keys. I need to remove one element of the

rekeying down, but how do I pop off an array element in the middle of an 
array? Is that done using unset($array[123]) ? I'm having a

Hi David,

Ran into this myself a short time ago.   There's probably a better 
answer, but I ended using array_diff.  Basically I pass in the original 
array, and a new single element array containing the element to remove, 
and pocket the difference.

To (kinda) rewrite the manual/online help for this purpose:

|$array1 = array("a" => "green", "red", "blue", "red");
$result = array_diff($array1, array("b" => "green"));

should return $result as containing red, blue and red, but no green.

Look at array_slice

Based on the vote tally array_slice won, but I don't get this command. I 
just went for broke and tried my unset suspicion and indeed it works.
This is the scenario: I have abunch of record IDs in an array, which I 
stuffed into the $_SESSION variable. The IDs belong to pictures and I 
just deleted one picture, which means that I need to remove the 
non-existent ID from the array.

This is the code:
     // Remove current element from display array
     $display = $_SESSION['sessiondisplay'];
     unset($display[$_SESSION['sessionviewpointer']]);
     // Rekey display array
     $display = array_values($display);
     // register new array with $_SESSION
     $_SESSION['sessiondisplay'] = $display;

The unset on a specific array key unsets only that value. The array key 
is gone and thus the value is no longer in the array. Rekeying using 
array_values patches the hole and gets me a consecutive, numerically 
keyed array.
I also store the current pointer in $_SESSION and as it turns out I 
don't even have to do anything with the pointer as it automatically 
points at the next array element.

Nevertheless, I am intrigued by array_slice, but I guess I postpone 
understanding that until tomorrow.

Thanks for the pointers.

Your solution seems fine to me. You just save a couple of lines with  
array_splice.

I think you want array_splice, not array_slice.

array_splice removes a section of an array an optionally replaces it  
with another array. It resets the keys of the array if it is  
numerically indexed. In your case, you leave out the replacement  
argument.

An example in your context might look like this:

array_splice($_SESSION['sessiondisplay'], $_SESSION 
['sessionviewpointer'], 1);

This would only makes sense if $_SESSION['sessiondisplay'] is a  
numerically indexed array, and if $_SESSION['sessionviewpointer'] is  
an int.

Thanks, I'll try that out as well and probably use it. The array is 
numerically indexed and the pointer is an integer.
If I understand this right, my approach would then work on any array and 
any pointer. Good to know as well. :)

Message-ID: <C2B93AAF.5C50%cliff@pinestream.com>

For long and indeterminate page processing, like connecting with a credit
card payment gateway or calculating pi to thousands of significant digits,
what is your preferred method for displaying ?please wait??

I see two techniques:
1. Use Javascript upon form submission to display the ?please wait? message
2. Echo a ?please wait? page from the server and then do a 302 redirect upon
completion of the scrpt.

Issues:
1. Not everyone uses JavaScript
2. Can you issue a header redirect after echoing a ?please wait? message. I
though headers need to be sent first. Is a 302 header redirect an exception?

Never really thought about it.

If your backend processes is asynchronous (or if you make it so) you 
could have your "progress" script just meta refresh until the back-end 
has a result, and then on the next refresh, 302 out of there.

Hi all:

I'm a developer who has concentrated more on smaller-scale projects,  
but as it turns out one of my projects is beginning to stress the  
limits of a single server, and so I'm about to begin venturing into  
the unknown.

The project is currently in the "tens of thousands" of users range,  
but it looks like we need to start drafting a plan to scale it up to  
"hundreds of thousands" to a million or so users.

This is a site that is running on a custom built PHP framework (which  
seems to be performing rather well), and MySQL.  The server's running  
Apache and Linux (Red Hat). There is some image and data uploading  
from users, and most pages are served dynamically, currently, with  
very simple SQL.  I have taken the step of caching any page elements  
that require any kind of recursion or iteration to produce (such as a  
list of categories that displays the number of related items from  
other tables in it), but I have not cached, for example, database  
calls to just one item matching on the primary key.  I think this  
approach has been sensible so far.

If I had to classify the site, I'd say it follows a similar usage  
pattern as something like last.fm, or facebook, only much smaller.   
Social networking-type thing, but users are not constantly visiting  
and reloading pages, like a news site.

So, more than the PHP coding strategy, my question is about what kind  
of hosting/server arrangement I would be looking at to handle the  
kind of load I'm talking about.

How many servers will I need to handle the kind of traffic I  
require?  If this question is not so easily answered, then what would  
be my equation for figuring this out?  A friend told me he works on a  
site that has 4,000,000 users and they have their system optimized to  
handle 500 requests per second.  This is for a search engine-type  
site...is this a reasonable metric?

When you separate database and http servers, then what should be the  
hardware priorities for each?  CPU speed? RAM?  hard disk speed,  
etc.?  Perhaps the database is more RAM and HD dependent, and the web  
server will need more CPU and RAM?

I'd be interesting in learning a bit from those of you who are  
working on larger-scale projects what's powering your servers, and  
what kind of capacity you think your setup's giving you.

Thanks for helping me determine exactly where to research.

Cheers,

I'm not a scalability expert, but one thing I've learned is that many
things that perform well now can still cause problems when the scale
increases, so keep your mind open to all possibilities.

Do you have the feature that allows people to see how many degrees away
they are from another user?

Anyway, read that book. :-)

Message-ID: <C2B944BF.5C62%cliff@pinestream.com>

What is the best way to escape JavaScript data?

The PEAR JavaScript package does this:

 function escapeString($str)  {
        $js_escape = array(
            "\r"    => '\r',
            "\n"    => '\n',
            "\t"    => '\t',
            "'"     => "\\'",
            '"'     => '\"',
            '\\' => '\\\\'
        );
        return strtr($str,$js_escape);
    }

I also found this, which converts every character to its code ? pretty
extreme.

function javascript_escape($str) {
    $new_str = '';
    for($i = 0; $i < strlen($str); $i++) {
        $new_str .= '\x' . dechex(ord(substr($str, $i, 1)));
    }
    return $new_str;
}

Thoughts?

+1

Also, take a look into memcache, it's not as fast as local caches but
scales well. Created by the guys at facebook, memcache gets plenty of
real-world high traffic exercise ;-)

Also consider two separate mysql groups, one cluster for CRUD ops
(Create/Replace/Update/Delete) and the other (slaves) for reads
(SELECTs).

Chances are, once you get busy with memcache you will start spending
most of your time dealing with the database itself; and having a
separate cluster optimized for SELECTs makes the job a lot easier.

I've been using Webload from Webload.org quite a since it went open
source in the last couple of months. I'd highly recommend it for
testing out a new system you'd set up before you put it online in
production. You definitely learn a lot about how well your code scales
when you load test it with a system that simulates actual activity.

Sounds fairly reasonable, but of course it depends dramatically on the type
of site it is.  Social networks typically have a "heavier" traffic pattern.
There's generally more complex application logic, session storage needs,
etc.

And I think it could be argued that the users would be more likely to
constantly refresh and visit pages, as opposed to a search engine or news
site.  The idea of social networking sites are to keep the user navigating
through the site - there's no "external" usage really.  And serving socially
matched metrics is going to be more intensive - heavier - than a more
static-orientated news or search site.

Add in Ajax magic, and you could be generating a substantial number of
requests per page load.  If Ajax is important to the site, get a good
JavaScript developer that understands server interaction, load, etc. (I
know, I can't believe I just said that).

Throw the big iron at your database - CPU, RAM, HD.  The database is the
aggregation point for your application.  It's easier to add web servers than
to add database servers (and take full advantage of them).  And since this
is a social networking site, the database will be busy looking up
matches/etc (ie, whatever the social magic is in this case).

For the web server, I've found that 1gb of RAM, snappy CPU, and any HD
works.

Put your money in the database hardware, or in development time so that your
application knows how to scale across databases completely (read/write).

memcached is very useful for session storage, as can a dedicated database
be.

Hi,

Does anyone know how to force an iframe to handle varying page lengths  
such that it starts back at the top of the page each time?  I have a  
menu.php called from an iframe in index.php.  This menu calls  
balances.php, workdues.php, etc which have varying page lengths  
depending on the data displayed.  Upon pressing 'Return to main menu'  
I am left to scroll back up - as the menu is a much shorter page than  
all others.  How do you handle this?

Any thoughts or suggestions much appreciated.  Thanks.

json_encode() loosely takes PHP data types and converts it to JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON) -- it actually doesn't escape the data itself that
well.

It depends on your app -- you may want to retain HTML tags, for example --
but I tend to trim, remove all UNIX chars, strip HTML tags and convert to
HTML entities.

I'm not sure I get your problem exactly, but whether you are on the web
page inside the iframe or on the parent web page that contains the
iframe you can force your self to a certain position on a web page by
using HTML anchor tags.

You put the (hidden) anchor tag at the top of your main menu:
<a name="menutop"></a>

And the link to the main menu top anchor is like so:
<a href="#menutop">Return to main menu</a>

A link to an anchor tag will force the web page to scroll up to it. This
is a potential solution.

Additionally, I believe you can even do URL hrefs like this, that will
go to webpage.htm and move to the posiiton of anchor menutop:
http://www.exanmple.com/webpage.htm#menutop

But, my raw HTML gets a bit foggy nowadays.

There is no standard solutions for this problem. However you can use a 
technique called "background-transfer" or "early transfer" in which as soon 
as user moves to 2nd box to select 2nd picture for uploading, transfer of 1st 
image starts in background. You need to use Ajax for this.

Hence when user moved to last box or finally to upload button, 70% of images 
would have transferred in background. This saves lot of uploading time and 
user thinks that transfer of images went faster however in reality it is 
same.

Many large image, graphics, video sites use this technique to reduce large 
uploading time just by controlling the way of transfer.

Resizing images at client is not good solution even if it is possible to 
resize because then on server side you may have very limited image data to 
make further processing on them like printing, enhancing etc.

And what would one do if the user changes his/her mind and browses to a 
different picture in the first five boxes? If the concern is 
transmission time / amount then why design a system that allows for 
bogus uploads? And what to do if the user turned ECMAScript off?

Just asking....

Nelly:

Sure, you'll have to write something client-side, namely javascript 
to do it. But, there's all sorts of javascript scripts to resize 
images available to choose from, try Google "resize images javascript"

Here's one that should do with a little work:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~sbpoley/webmatters/resize.html

Here's one that allows the user to crop and resize their pictures.

http://mondaybynoon.com/2007/01/22/crop-resize-with-javascript-php-and-imagemagick/

Lot's of neat stuff.

I would like to see your end-result.

Cheers,

tedd

surface; but you will need to check a little deeper under the surface to see 
what I mean.

Ah, you may need to modify the @mysql_query() command like so:

@mysql_query('CREATE DATABASE '.$_REQUEST['db']);

So that the final submitted query looks like (for $_REQUEST['db'] =
'myDatabase'):

CREATE DATABASE myDatabase

Whereas before you were issuing the query:

myDatabase

Which makes no sense and would have resulted in an error, except that
you were using an the error control (@) operator. See
http://us2.php.net/@ for more information.

I don't believe there is any way to actually modify and image file on  
the client-side using Javascript. (If someone knows a way, I'd love  
to hear about it!) For client-side image processing you'd need use a  
technology that has image resampling capabilities, and possibly  
something that has write permissions on the client's machine. First  
thing that comes to mind is a Java applet.

php Gallery created a desktop client that serves a similar purpose,  
but I'm pretty sure it's specific to the php Gallery API. But this  
gives you an idea of what it would take to implement client-side  
image resizing... probably Java.

This is cool, but it doesn't actually resize the image. It just  
displays different pre-sized images that are already on the server.

Also cool stuff, but all the processing happens on the server-side.

You would also need to set special GRANT privileges for user "paul".

Hi Paul,

You've gotten some good answers on your actual question, so I won't 
repeat them.  But as an important side note, watch out what you copy 
from the books.  This line is terribly risky:

> $rs1 = @mysql_query( $_REQUEST['db'] ); 

If, for example, I requested 
http://example.com/create_db.php?db=drop+database+mysql%3B the script as 
it is would attempt to drop the mysql database (and hopefully you're not 
connecting to mysql as a user who could actually do that...)

See this great article from Chris Shiflett on why user input should 
always be filtered and escaped: http://shiflett.org/articles/sql-injection

I realize you copied most of this code out of the book, and that's no 
shame -- learning by example is one of the best ways to do it.  It's a 
shame that the author has published code examples like this.

- Allen

My bad - you're right. I had a senior moment.

I was thinking that because the operation had to take place 
client-side that a client-side language should work. However, 
javascript doesn't have access to client-side files.

Sorry,

tedd

Javascript doesn't have access to the client-side files.. But Java and Flash
do. You could do this in Flash pretty easily.
Agreed as a general rule you would want to store the full size images server
side, but I can think of many exceptions to that rule, a common one is,
using it for an icon/avatar.

ImageMagick is a great command line tool that can modify images but the
processing will happen on the server side after image has already been
uploaded.  You can use exec() within your script to execute the ImageMagick
commands

Subject: [nycphp-talk] TRUE/FALSE and $_SESSION variables
Message-ID: <6.2.3.4.2.20070711223935.028ee1e0@mail.optonline.net>

This tiny script:
<?php
session_start();
$ineligibleFlag = FALSE;
if ( $ineligibleFlag === FALSE ) echo 'it is false<br />';
$_SESSION['ineligibleFlag'] = FALSE;
print_r( $_SESSION );

produces this output:
it is false
Array ( [ineligibleFlag] => )

The docs tell me that sessions can handle everything that can be 
serialized, and that serialize can handle everything but resources, 
and that I shouldn't define resource constants.  But FALSE is not a 
resource that I know of, and so none of that explains (that I can 
see, anyway) why the session can't hold this value. I can easily work 
around this, but I'd like to understand it as well.

"false" is a keyword, same as "true" and "null".

This assigns $ineligibleFlag the boolean value of 0 or "false"

> if ( $ineligibleFlag === FALSE ) echo 'it is false<br />';

This tests to see if $inelegibleFlag is boolean and false (triple equals 
requires type and value to match), which is exactly what you just 
assigned it to, so you get a match.

Try assigning $ineligibleFlag = 0, or '0' , or '' (empty string) and see 
the various results you get.

When cast to a string, FALSE is the empty string.

Let me  try to suggest some general points.

At client environment you may use Ajax (and JSON) to increase responsiveness 
of your website. But effective implementation of Ajax requires good knowledge 
of JS and how it interacts with server.

On server side you may split your application in 3 type of environments viz:

Database environment, Static server environment for serving static contents of 
your site like images, css etc and Main environment for executing PHP code 
and serving output. Hence good configuration and well written code can 
effectively utilize all of 3 environments.

Database environment may include Replication of Clustering depending upon 
requirement, load and budget, Static environment may be running on 
lightweight web server like Lighttpd just to serve static data, and Main 
server environment may be implemented using LVS (type of clustering) to 
execute PHP code and to server output from more than 1 servers to balance 
load.

Additionally, you may also implementing caching of output and code at various 
levels. For that, you can use Opcode/Bytecode cacheres like XCache, APC, 
eAccelerator etc. to execute your PHP scripts more faster, if you are using 
frameworks like Symfony, Zend etc. then you can use their own caching methods 
and finally reverse proxies like Varnish, Squid to cache static and dynamic 
data at web server level.

I hope these suggestions will help you in understanding scaling of your 
application.

Then those 5 pictures will get uploaded again to replace older ones hence no 
bogus uploads. However you can say that 5 images were uploaded without any 
need but practically it has been seen that only 15% to 20% images are 
re-uploaded by users.

If script is off then regular form will upload all images at once using POST 
method.

We run into this kind of situation all the time with our CMS. Clients
just don't seem to get why they can't upload photos from their 9
megapixel camera to their website and then have them display properly.
Usually we have to actually show them that a 72 ppi image is something
like 24 inches wide on their 19-inch monitor, then they get it.

Assuming that these people who are uploading images are all in the
same office, or work together, then it's simple. They need to go buy
copies of Photoshop LE and you need to give them the instructions on
how to resample and resize the images before they upload them.

A less expensive option (if you're going to go the "fix the root cause" 
route) is to use the free program Irfanview. I'm sure there are other 
free alternatives, but Irfanview is fairly easy for the uninitiated to use.

Check out http://picnik.com/

This is a surprisingly powerful and easy-to-use online image editor.  
All implemented in flash. Basic accounts are free.

One cool feature is that you can email the image somewhere after  
you've finished editing it. I've been toying with the idea of  
implementing a CMS tool that supports image uploads through a pop  
account. The idea would be, after you've finished editing your image  
in picnic, you would email it to upload at SOMDOMAIN.COM, and the CMS  
application would automatically check that mailbox for new images.

Probably some security issues with this though... any thoughts?

I think you can rely on Javascript being present and enabled, with  
the all the web 2.0 stuff out there it just about has to be.

When I needed to run something long, I've run it in the background  
using the exec command. If you have command line php enabled, this  
could be just another php script. In that script you could use  
pcntl_fork to speed things up even more (multiprocessing).
I would then periodically call a script to check on the progress. Or  
the user could surf and do other things and then come back the page,  
at which time a check would be performed. O'Reilly sort of works this  
way when you want to create a PDF of  a book chapter.

If you use exec, you need to make sure it disconnects itself from the  
php process. As I recall you need to run it in the background (&) and  
send output to /dev/null. I forget if you need to do nohup also. You  
could get a bunch of things going at once, credit card payment and pi  
calcs.

I don't imagine they've stopped working on it.  I used it for years until I
started doing my own abstraction late last year.  Still a huge fan of the
library.  Last I read on the list a few month back, they were still pretty
active with it stating that even in the world of PDO they would still be
useful.

Good point. I tested this with the following script:
<?php
if (ini_get ("ignore_user_abort")) {
     die ("ignore_user_abort must be disabled");
}

class Foo {
     public function __destruct () {
         file_put_contents ("/tmp/isRun", "ok");
     }
}

$a = new Foo();
sleep (5);
?>

The destructor definitely gets called as the file exists regardless if I 
  abort the request or not.

@ this point it really depends on what you are looking to do, for the  
most basic stuff you can use either, 1.2 comes w/ more behaviors and  
helpers and a nice Memcache engine for more advanced usage.  Umm  
ConsoleShell is 1.2 and a few other niceties.

Just keep you eyes peeled + im sure using 1.2 would help the team out  
tracking issues ... anything crucial to your app should be reviewed  
in link below.

Did you at least google for "PHP POP3 SMTP"? That gives as the top 
result this page:
http://www.weberdev.com/get_example-501.html
You then need some mail server, there is usually one or more in every 
Linux distro or you can use Mercury Mail on Windows or ask the IT 
department at your school if they can provide you with a dummy server 
that can only send email to itself or so.
You may want to find the most popular mail server applications and read 
through their documentation. That will give you a good start to learn 
how to talk to a mail server. You can also read up on the POP3 and SMTP 
standards, I am pretty sure they are documented in detail to the nth degree.

Sure, you can copy the example and hope that it works, but be sure that 
your prof will do the same (profs tend to be quite smart). Also, this 
mailing list gets archived on the web and is searchable, so be careful 
what you ask for. If you copy, at least reference the source or better 
come up with a good story. Otherwise be prepared to get exmatriculated 
for plagiarism.
That aside, I think you should talk to your prof and discuss this with 
him/her. I don't consider this a "minor project" and wonder what a major 
project would be. Maybe you both can agree on something that is still 
challanging to you, but isn't impossible given your current knowledge 
and the time available. You asking this now makes me suspect that this 
is a summer session course, so you won't have much time.

Good luck!

This implies that both POP/IMAP and SMTP server share same backend for 
authentication/storage - LDAP or SQL would be easiest because you can 
easily change those in PHP.

There are plenty of documents describing how to set something like this 
up. This sounds like 50% programming project and 50% sysadmin project.

Good luck.

Hi all,


   Well , I suppose the people on the community are still not clear with my question. So let me make it clear ....

I mean if somebody registers with my email service..... then his/her POP3 and SMTP accounts should be created automatically in the email server ..... like as they r created on YahooMail and Gmail or ant other web-based email service without the intervention of the admin.

Also Mr. David suspected that is this a minor project and wondered why not its  a major project !! 
So well, this is really a minor project as there is nothing special about building an email service as far u r clear how our application is going to communicate with the email servers.

Also someone asked to share the degree i will be getting upon completing my graduation !!
So well, i would always like to share it with NYPHP ....
I would awarded the degree of ------  Bachelor of technology  (B.Tech) in  IT upon completion of my graduation.
Its equivalent to a BS degree earned from a US University.

So you want to make a user interface using PHP that creates an account 
on your mail server. Right? In that case, I wonder why you need MySQL...

OK, so for which mail server do you want to create the user interface? 
Or do I still not get it?

So, if it is nothing special, why do you ask for help?

I think that was just a clever way of telling you that if it is your 
study project you are expected to figure it out / learn about it 
yourself rather than to ask others for the solution. So, is it really 
the same like a BS from a US university? 3/4th of the courses are like 
history, language, and sports and only 1/4th is about your major? 
</exaggeration>

Regardless of that, I for my part don't have any reservations against 
helping you out. I don't even want half or your degree or such. But, 
before I speculate any longer, first create clear specifications.
1. What is this gizmo supposed to do in general?*
2. Which tools do you want / have to use?
3. What are all the other prerequisits and limitations?
4. What are the individual functions you need to implement?
5. How are the individual functions supposed to work?
6. What is the required input and expected output of each of these 
functions?

* Describe this without stating "has to work like GMail" or similar 
comparisons that are not nutritious at all. I have no clue how GMail 
works, I only know that it works.

If you have written detailed and revised answers to all these questions 
80% of your work is done. The remaining 20% are 10% for coding and 10% 
for documenting your code. I have no problem in helping you with the 10% 
of the coding to the best of my abilities (which aren't that great, 
sorry), the rest of it is your task.

So, and with that I already did 5% of the first 80% for you. Here is 
your plan of action, get working...at least this is how I got my 
technician certification as well as my BSEE and MSTM degrees.

Yes I agree. In my many years of experience specifying the design is often
the biggest part of the project. In commercial projects the team can get in
the way of the goal with things like feature creep and simple ignorance. 

I suggest that you do a lot of reading or searching&reading and then ask
specific questions of the group...such efforts will bring you the most
useful results. 

I am curious, what country offers a B.Tech degree?

Dirty, inelegant, but does the job according to your specs above:

1) run sendmail or postfix, which is probably installed by default on 
your linux distro
2) run the pop3 daemon
3) install and run squirrelmail
3) adduser php script which does something like this:

<?php
// get $user and $password from $_REQUEST
// validate it
// check to make sure account doesn't exist
`sudo adduser -u $username -p $password -s /sbin/nologin`;
// show confirmation message that says your account has been created.
?>


This will probably get you a C- grade, but it works :)

Wow, everyone's beat you up a bit. I'm not about to do your homework for 
you, but here's the way you should be thinking:

1) What POP3 server will you be using?
2) Can you be sure that the POP3 server will run on the same box as the 
web server?
3) How does that server store user information? in files, what kind of 
format? in a mySQL database? in an LDAP directory?
4) What features of PHP can you use to write to those files, or that 
database, or that directory?

AFAIK, the POP3 protocol has no facility for creating accounts, so 
account creation will not happen over POP3. You'll need to write some 
PHP to manage user accounts in whatever datastore the POP3 server uses.

A note about (2) above -- if the web app is required to deal with a 
remote POP3 server, you're going to have to figure out how to manipulate 
the user accounts on that remote server. If your POP3 server is using a 
file for user accounts, you'll need to figure out what mechanism you'll 
use to (securely!) modify that file remotely. If it's mySQL or LDAP, 
you'll have an easier time?

Wow, we're giving the webserver sudo permissions now?

You don't need system accounts in order to have mailboxes. Use a mail
server that allows virtual user lookup in MySQL. This also allows you
to scale your mail operation across multiple servers.

Dovecot is apparently a good choice, one that I'm considering after
many years with good ol' uw-imap. You can make up virtual UIDs so that
the mailboxes are still owned by individual users or all the mail can
be owned by a single system user. There's a lot of flexibility there,
and good docs on how to get it all integrated with Postfix.

Not an easy project, Shadab, but one that has the potential to teach
you a lot about how internet email works at the nuts and bolts level.

Too cute for words. But it doesn't do anything about
resizing/resampling pictures before uploading.

Steve Francia mentioned Flash as a platform that has access to local
files, but I can't think offhand of how you'd resize images using
actionscript--otherwise everyone would be doing it by now. But
maybe...

On client education front, if you are lucky enough to have clients
with Macs, you just need to teach them about Cmd-Shift-4, which gives
you crosshairs for taking a screenshot. Open a large image in
Preview.app, scale it onscreen, and then Cmd-Shift-4 to produce a
smallish png (I know, not jpeg) that can be uploaded in a reasonable
amount of time.

Yeah, how do you keep someone from publishing personal enhancement
product ads to your CMS? It should be trivially easy to fake an email
from picnik, or for that matter to just use picnik to spam in the
first place.

That was just an example of how to set something up in the 
simplest/quickest way.

I've set up and still maintain a some large custom made clustered mail 
installations using a combination of 
postfix/mysql/courier-imap/squirrelmail blended an arsenal of mail 
blocking/filtering utilities like dspam, spamassassin, and antivirus.  
Some other interesting additions to that were things like a public key 
encryption proxy. Perhaps this would make an interesting talk one day, 
but it's more of a "systems" project than php one.

I got this idea from backpack http://backpackit.com/

They provide an email api for adding to page content. They get around  
the security issue by randomly generating a reasonably long and  
complex mailbox name for each page that you create.

ex: mouse55allice at youraccount.backpackit.com

They also make it easy to regenerate the mailbox name with a single  
click if you believe it has been compromised.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Functions Question

Is anyone aware if there might be an 
undocumented or obscurely documented 
special session function called: 

session_startI() 

...instead of the regular: session_start()

May have been introduced in PHP 5? 
And if you know about it, 
what is the intended purpose.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] how to find the mysql server status
Message-ID: <30ce306c0707151755mceabf8fxa7fc48c24a847e0b@mail.gmail.com>

hi All,

 How can I get the mysql server status, no. of queries executed in a single
page and the time to execute total queries in the index.php page.
I would like to get the output like this.
 [ Execution time: 0.92 secs ]   [ Memory usage: Unknown ]   [ 50 database
queries used ]   [ GZIP Disabled ]   [ Server load: 0.05 ]

 If anyone has the idea please reply to this mail.


 Thanks in advance
 Shaiju

Execution time - use microtime and calculate the difference between 
start and end time.

Mem use - no clue? Maybe some MySQL command line thingie to query the stats?

Query count - counter, each time a query is run/was successful a counter 
is increased by one. You can also have different counters for total and 
failed queries (difference is the number of queries that worked).

Server load, GZIP - no clue.

Sounds like you might want something like mytop ...

http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mytop/

Or

SHOW PROCESSLIST
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/show-processlist.html

Or

mysql_stat()
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-stat.php

However the fact that you want # of queries made in a single page  
might be better to just do a query log dump and view it.

mysql_stat is good.  You can use a more direct status query if you
need more than that using "show status":
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/show-status.html

<?php
	function dbg($var) {
		echo '<pre>' . print_r($var, 1) . '</pre>';
	}
	
	function get_mysql_full_status() {
		$aReturn = array();
		$oStatus = mysql_query('SHOW STATUS');
		while($aStatus = mysql_fetch_row($oStatus)) {
			$aReturn[$aStatus[0]] = $aStatus[1];
		}
		
		return $aReturn;
	}

	$oConnection = mysql_connect('localhost', 'me', 'y0 m at m@');
	
	dbg(mysql_stat());
	dbg(get_mysql_full_status());
?>

If you're using a class or function for db access, you could increment
a static or global var  each time you run the mysql_query function and
then in a destructor or at the end of the page you have your query
count.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Practical Extraction in PHP
Message-ID: <b76252690707160637qbbd9ad0jd567e4cc22bdb2e1@mail.gmail.com>

I've had this idea in the back of my head to do a project that
systematically tracks values embedded in web or email reports. For
instance, I get logwatch emails from the servers I admin, and each
time one of those comes in I'd like to extract the disk free space and
put it into a round-robin database. Or I want to track the rendering
time for various key pages in a CMS.

The problem is that the value isn't always in the same place. It might
be a few lines down because of alerts or content that precede it. Or
it might look different some days (ending in GB rather than MB). It's
possible that some combination of regex and recurrence number ( 5th
instance of /[0-9]*(MB|BG)/ ) could work, but it seems messy.

We all probably do a little of this on an ad hoc basis, scraping
values out of websites and whatnot. Does anyone do it a lot? What kind
of tools do you use? Is Perl better suited to the task? Or sed+awk?
Does anyone know of a system (preferably php) that does this in the
general case?

TIA, y'all.

Chris,

I just recently was faced with a similar problem, but I'm not sure if my 
solution is 100% helpful or not. I ended up using grep to find what I 
was looking for, and then indicating the column position (which was 
pretty reliable) to further narrow down any false positives. It's sort 
of difficult to give a lot of help since we can't see the files 
themselves. I know for the project I worked on there was a lot of 
tweaking involved to make it 100% accurate.

Would it be easier to obtain the results in another fashion? If you ran 
some sort of 'df -h' on a Linux file system you could get the disk space 
from that. Are the emailed reports are your only option?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Manipulating $_REQUEST Directly
Message-ID: <001201c7c819$ed88eda0$c89ac8e0$@com>

I have inherited some old legacy code that down and dirty uses $_REQUEST
to universally grab all varibales from combined GET and/or POST form
submissions.

So I want to be equally blunt and directly chop up and massage $_REQUEST
before any code handles it.

I want to have an array of acceptable "white list" $_REQUEST variable
names I am looking for, allow those to remain in the $_REQUEST array,
but I want all other $_REQUEST variables removed/destroyed out of
$_REQUEST.

Then simply allow the the remaining "white list" $_REQUEST to flow into
the code.

So, for example I want to do something really short like so:

$whitelist_var_names = array('name', 'address', 'phone');

$_REQUEST = array_intersect_assoc($whitelist_var_names, $_REQUEST);


Can anyone give me a really short code burst, or isolate the proper
array function(s) that will do this for me? 

Thank you one and all, if you can help.

Down and dirty calls for a foreach. ;-)

foreach( $_REQUEST AS $key=>$val ) {
  if ( !in_array( $key, $whitelist ) ) {
    unset( $_REQUEST[ $key ] );
  }
  else {
    // do you have validation routines?
    // whitelist could include type info for validation...
    switch( $whitelist[ $key ] ) {
      case 'text':
        $_REQUEST[ $key ] = validated_text( $val );
        break;
    }
  // end else
  }
// end foreach
}

Maybe you were looking for something more efficient, but being able to
independently validate the values might make it worth a few extra
cycles, depending on whether the downstream code performs validation.

Message-ID: <469CDB21.3030507@php.net>

As a side note to this discussion, using $_REQUEST is a poor practice.
For one, it makes it practically impossible to adhere to the HTTP
specification:

"In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and
HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other
than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows
user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in
a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a
possibly unsafe action is being requested."

If you're not distinguishing between GET and POST, you can't adhere to
this recommendation. This can lead to numerous problems:

Hope that helps.

Yeah, it's probably just better to have various scripts that extract a
value in context, rather than trying to create a general system for
extracting values.

But extracting from email is particularly attractive because the email
is already coming in, so there's no remote configuration necessary.
Plus, the systems sending the reports are in many flavors of OS, some
of which I have no direct control over (such as firewall appliances).

Hello,

http://www.phpwordlib.motion-bg.com/ Looks good...but cost $..so doesn't 
look so good.
But has a demo.


Also, this code snippet:

One easy way to grab the text from a word doc is to use the command line
program catdoc.

here are a couple of examples to get you started.

Dan

function catdoc_string($str)
{
	// requires catdoc

	// write to temp file
	$tmpfname = tempnam ('/tmp','doc');
	$handle = fopen($tmpfname,'w');
	fwrite($handle,$a);
	fclose($handle);

	// run catdoc
	$ret = shell_exec('catdoc -ab '.escapeshellarg($tmpfname) .' 2>&1');

	// remove temp file
	unlink($tmpfname);

	if (preg_match('/^sh: line 1: catdoc/i',$ret)) {
		return false;
	}

	return trim($ret);
}

function catdoc_file($fname)
{
	// requires catdoc

	// run catdoc
	$ret = shell_exec('catdoc -ab '.escapeshellarg($fname) .' 2>&1');

	if (preg_match('/^sh: line 1: catdoc/i',$ret)) {
		return false;
	}

	return trim($ret);

This one is a bit old but comes in handy too:

I used a variation of it earlier this week.  Thanks Chris.  ;)

I think he was asking about a .doc file directly?  Im suprised that  
manipulation of Word docs always comes up on the list + the resources  
are pretty limited.

One project I found a while ago was antiword in which the sources are  
available:

http://www.winfield.demon.nl/

There is one file in there particularly useful: findtext.c

The only bad part is that it is < Office XP/2000.  Of course if you  
got off Word and switched to OpenOffice you have alot more open  
options for read/write and maintain compatibility.

My apologies, the web browser decided to send prematurely on that one.

Hello all,

I've been on this list for a few years now reading, and attribute much of my
knowledge of PHP to users on this list (in one way or another).

I am currently rebuilding my homepage from scratch, which means I have to
redo all the server side code.  Now, traditionally I've built all my web
sites using php4, but I've looked a lot into php5 and its new OOP support.
As a little background, I'm currently a computer science student in college,
and have studied oop to a great deal.

Here's my problem : I don't see how using php5 and oop would really benefit
me in building websites.  I understand objects, code reusability and all
that.  So I'm going to put the areas of my site here, and see how you guys
would build objects for them.

I have these sections:
News
Portfolio
Code (samples of code that I've written, for resume-type purposes)
Tutorials
Contact
About Me

At first glance, I thought to object-ify the portfolio section, where each
"project" would be an object.  But other than that, I don't see anywhere on
the site to use objects, and I could easily do that without objects.

I'd like to expand my resume by being able to say that I have done OOP in
php5, as I see on the jobs list that that is what employers are looking for
(at least quite a few are).

In addition, I was wondering what your suggestions are for php5 and oop, I
don't need an oop introduction or anything like that, I'd just like some
examples of how using objects would make the site better and how to
structure them.

Thanks in advance,

Brian,

I suggest that you look into MVC frameworks (like CakePHP) to see how 
you could use them to create your new website. That would help you to 
better understand OOP, and how you seperate different functions into 
logical categories.

For example, with some of your pages that will probably be stored in a 
database (Tutorials, News, maybe Code Samples) you could create 
functions to create, update, and delete these records inside the MVC 
framework. Using something like CakePHP would, I think, put you on the 
road to discovering why OOP is so important even in web-based 
application development.

I think the announcement of end of life for PHP4 should be enough to  
move on to PHP5.

As per why OO is beneficial I think it would be best to @ least look  
at one of the major frameworks out there, either CakePHP, Symfony,  
Joolma, etc and see how they are built since it is a good case of how  
code reuse and not just using OO but extending OO is extremely time  
saving.  Personally it sounds like you would benefit from learning  
MVC and just running with it.  Also most of today's frameworks  
already have structures in place for where to place items like models  
(Article, CodeSnippet, etc) and other content, another benefit I think.

Another good part ... people are sharing much of what they write w/  
them (http://bakery.cakephp.org).  I also think PHP5 is better for  
test driven and behavior driven development which I think will become  
another must have.

Personally, I use objects in 'boring' websites for the entire page. I have a
page object which is instantiated at the beginning on the script and starts
up the output buffer. From there, I can set the title any number of times
throughout the script, add external stylesheets, external javascript or
change the format overall.
Then, when the script is done, the __destruct magic method turns off the
output buffer, takes the contents of the buffer and throws it into the
content section of my XHTML. Then it outputs the entirety to the browser.

The advantages of all of this is that I make one include at the top of my
page (which automagically creates a $page object and starts up the buffer)
and from then on out, I know that all of the output from my script will be
properly placed in the XHTML and be consistent with the rest of my site.
Also, I can start out the script with one title "Please fill out this form"
and, depending on where things go in the script, I can have to change to
"You made a mistake on the form" or "Thank you for filling out the form" all
with a simple $page->setTitle(); And I never have to worry about planning
ahead to set titles, or include stylesheets, javascript, keywords,
descriptions, since I can add or change these things right up until the very
end of the script without a problem.

Aside from that, I use a database object to manage my connection and queries
(it's nice to have helper functions in that object) and I also find myself
using them a lot for repetitive tasks (though I guess these could be
relegated to functions).

Overall, just about anything you can do with an object can be done with a
bunch of functions and variables, but objects just make it easier. If a
group of functions and variables are all used for the same thing, shouldn't
they be grouped together anyway?

Sorry for the extended commentary, I just love objects.

Hi Brian,

Hope my last email was received more as playful than annoying.  I 
figured you had done what I've done too many times in the past and just 
sent a message before it was ready to go out.  Happens to all of us.

You're getting good advice from others already on the OOP questions. 
It's time to move on from PHP4, and rebuilding a site sounds like the 
perfect opportunity.  A personal site can also be a great chance to 
experiment with new concepts.

- Allen

Yes, I took it as a playful response to my mistake, I laughed :)

Thanks to everyone who has responded so far, I was thinking of looking at
CakePHP already so this is just more reason to do so.

I think more of my problem is when I see potential objects, I see more code,
and more work to accomplish the same goal.

I think when I said PHP5 in my previous post, I really meant OOP.  I can
switch to PHP5 without using OOP, which isn't my problem.  It's more
migrating toward the OOP approach to web development.  My problem is as of
now, when I see a task, and I think of how to do it with objects, I see more
code and more obstacles than just placing it in the file (not even
necessarily a function), and more work, for nice, but not essential
benefits.

Think of it this way: All computer programming can be reduced to procedural
code. Run line 1, followed by line 2, followed by line 3 and so on. This
will work. It's a hell to code the first time through, and beyond hell to
maintain. It's just a breeding ground for bugs.

So we create functions. Repeated code gets thrown in a function to be
re-used. If there is a bug found, we fix it once, and it's fixed for every
time that function is called. Nice. But when we start manipulating
variables, we run into a problem. We end up passing the same variables to
all these functions. Sometime we want to edit those variables. We could just
pass by reference, but that can get messy. And typically we find that the
same set of variables are used over and over.

So we create objects. Now we have the wonders of encapsulation. Everything
that has to do with one specific thing is grouped together. For example,
look at eBay. When you do a search on eBay, you (hopefully) get a screen
full of search results. Each of those could be an instance of a bid object.
Then each one is calling a special method (function) of the object to
display search results.

$searchResults; // array containing the ids of the various auctions
foreach ($searchResults as $auctionID)
{
    $auction = new auction($auctionID);
    $auction->showSearchResult();
}
And there you go, every auction result is displaying a similarly formatted
result to the user. You can make a change once in the object and have it
reflect anywhere it's referenced. Plus, you don't have to worry about
variable wrangling, since all the variables associated with each auction are
encapsulated inside the object and can't be changed by accident. You know
exactly which set of data you are working with and changing.

For me, it was sort of a paradigm shift to OOP. One day I was thinking
"What's the point of creating all these objects when I can do it all with
functions and arrays?" and then something clicked and I realized "Objects
make life so much easier and clearer. I think this one just baked me
cookies. I like objects."

Okay, maybe the last bit didn't occur, but it could have. A cookie factory
class.... mmm

Yeah, MVC. It works really well to model the HTTP protocol: Users make
Requests for Resources (aka pages), Collections, and Forms in your
Domain.

Beyond modeling HTTP, you have helper classes that add a layer of
abstraction and convenience to your code: Database, Filesystem,
Calendar, Mailbox, Template.

Is it worth doing all of this for a one-off personal website? Well
yeah, if you've studied oo in great detail, you should have access to
some patterns that will make it easy to write the code.

But if you don't want to put that much time into it, use one of the
many frameworks that have already been suggested, and just see what oo
"feels" like in this context. That should be good enough for a resume
entry, anyway.

Let me just say that I am absolutely *relieved* to see stuff like this
happen to someone other than me. I was beginning to think it was a
personal problem, but clearly it is not.

There was a reference earlier to catdoc. The url for that project is
http://www.wagner.pp.ru/~vitus/software/catdoc/

The changelog shows slightly more recent activity than AntiWord, but I
suppose it all breaks with Office 2007 (or whatever year they're up to
in Redmond).

This is very nice command line utility to extract text from Word and 
Powerpoint slides. It runs on most of *nix systems. Can be used to extract 
text (in form of CSV) from XLS files also.

We have been using it very happily for long time.

Hi Marc,

Pretty much all of my work is with social networking type sites... so  
I can chime in a little bit.  First off, in my experience the number  
of requests per second that can be handled by these apps is usually  
much less than your typical web app.  With it running on one server  
without major caching, we have a tough time handling more than 60-80  
requests per second.  This is because so many pages (at least for us)  
provide a portal of information that is very dynamic.

So... if you're not using APC... I'd recommend popping that in on  
your server for good measure... however, you might not notice much of  
an increase in the requests per second though because it is most  
likely database/disk i/o bound.  The main thing that will speed up  
your application is caching those database queries and objects.  If  
you're not doing any of this right now, I'd recommend making the leap  
straight to memcache (rather than a file based caching system)  
because ultimately this is the way to scale caching in a large  
setup.  Another step that will quickly alleviate stress while you're  
building out your caching solution is to separate your web server  
from your database server.  I think the number one thing you want  
with a database server is fast disk i/o.  Memory is nice on a db  
server to increase the various caches... however, (we're talking  
mysql here?) the mysql query cache gets invalidated so fast on a lot  
of your tables do to all the updates that usually happen in a social- 
networking system that you need a programmed cache solution that you  
can control when data is stale (hence the memcache recommendation).   
Another thing to consider is denormalizing certain parts of your  
database to eliminate certain complex joins and calculations you  
might find yourself having to do... this has really sped up parts of  
our applications.

The suggestion to have a static server is a good one as well as you  
can use a light web server tuned to serve the static content rather  
than the heavy apache processes loaded up with the php module +  
extensions.  It can also serve as a master server for all user  
uploaded content (i.e. user uploads content, regular server handles  
it, then moves the file to the static content server).

Good luck and post any findings/issues that come up because I'm sure  
a lot of us are interested in this topic.

-Rob

As others have stated, it's current... and it's awesome!  I'm pretty  
sure it's faster than PDO for mysql.  I recommend additionally  
installing the extension for it which replaces parts of the php code  
with c and provides a major speed up to certain methods.  Also, if  
you're serious about portable SQL statements, there's a good guide  
linked from the documentation that tells you which abstracted  
functions to use for certain SQL commands that differ across databases.

Thanks. I think it looks very powerful after a quick scan of the API. PEAR
DB is seeming a bit simple these days. ADOdb might be a nice alternative.

Great comments on scaling too ? I think everyone on the list will find your
comments very insightful.

Message-ID: <E474AB1D-A9F5-4215-BC5E-ECB991B8F17D@sala.ca>

Hi all,

I'm doing some research on using GPG from PHP to encrypt sensitive  
data that will be stored server-side. I came across an old but good  
article:

http://devzone.zend.com/article/1265-Encryption-and-Decryption-using- 
PHP-and-GnuPG

Decryption example from article:
> $gpg = '/usr/bin/gpg';
> $passphrase = 'My secret pass phrase.';
> $encrypted_file = 'foo.gpg';
> $unencrypted_file = 'foo.txt';
> echo shell_exec("echo $passphrase | $gpg --passphrase-fd 0
>    -o $unencrypted_file -d $encrypted_file");

They did mention one pitfall related to using shell_exec:

http://devzone.zend.com/article/1265-Encryption-and-Decryption-using- 
PHP-and-GnuPG#Heading7

Quoted from the article:

How is it available for all to see? Are all shell commands called  
from PHP logged somewhere public? This didn't seem right to me, but  
maybe I'm missing something. Anyone know what they mean by "available  
for all to see"? Thanks!

What is meant is that a shell/terminal session pops up to run the command,
and a person on the terminal could see it running.

There are 2 issues at play here.

As you have mentioned, the passphrase is passed on the command line,
which does make it vulnerable to various attacks.  The most basic would
be that it would be visible in the output of 'ps auxfw'.

The other issue is that the decrypted data is written to disk in the
clear, so an attacker could read it directly from the disk.

A much better approach is to use the proc_open function to execute the
process and allow you to provide the passphrase directly to the gpg
process on stdin and read the decrypted data from stdout.  This way the
passphrase & cleartext are much less vulnerable to simple sniffing by
other users of the machine.

It probably safe enough to encrypt the data with a passphrase-less 
public key. Whenever I need to store credit card data, I encrypt it with 
GPG before storing it in the database. The private key file is not to be 
stored on the same machine and should definitely not be accessible by 
the web server!

Since OpenOffice has very good capabilities to read all Microsoft
Office file formats, you can script OpenOffice to be your
'library/utility', and in the end save to HTML, ODF, XML or whatever
you need.

There are many projects and examples that you will find for scripting
OpenOffice, and even php libraries to interface with it.

Check the presentation I did for BostonPHP
http://rundlett.com/s5/oasis
slide 16 provides a list of PHP projects, including and especially
Docvert which is probably exactly what you are asking for
http://rundlett.com/s5/oasis.html#slide16

Of course, I'd like to see more people working on these projects so
they were household names :-)

That's always been my understanding. But it occurred to me that the  
private key is useless without the pass-phrase. What if the secret  
key is stored on the same machine as the encrypted data, but the pass- 
phrase isn't?

As long as the pass-phrase is submitted along with every request that  
shows decrypted data, the pass-phrase never needs to be stored on the  
server ... unless of course the pass-phrase is somehow accessible by  
the use of shell_exec.

This sounds like a good suggestion. It seems to solve the shell_exec  
problem.

I'd just love to create a simple solution for storing sensitive data  
without requiring a special decryption setup on the client side. What  
do you think? Am I playing with fire?

The strength in public key encryption lies in the fact that the private 
key is not accessible by the "evil" third party. The passphrase is a 
secondary level of defense which protects in the event that the private 
key file is stolen. I don't have numbers off the top of my head, but 
it's far easier to brute force crack the passphrase than to crack a 
message encrypted with the private key.

To avoid storing or transmitting the private key, you might want to 
consider using... gasp!.. javascript to decrypt the payload on the 
client side. There are probably some javascript gpg examples floating 
around on the net. I remember a company called hushmail which used 
something similar to implement encrypted webmail. Trusting the browser 
for security is a slippery slope though. If you don't control the 
content, a cross site scripting hack could easily steal the private key 
from your cookies or right out of memory. But that is another can of worms..

~Rolan


I believe hushmail used to (and may still do) use an scheme where an 
encrypted message is sent

Message-ID: <000b01c7c9ff$09468b10$0300a8c0@X9183>

I want to set up primary keys made up of several fields. Referring to the 
COBOL type example below is it possible to set up group data structures as 
illustrated by ACCOUNT and NAME?



01                  EXAMPLE-RECORD.                 SYNC.

05      ACCOUNT.

10        BRANCH                  PIC 9(6).

10        ACCOUNT-NO        PIC 9(8).

10        PIN                             PIC 9(4).

05    BALANCE                            PIC S9(6)v99        COMP-3

05      NAME.

10         GIVEN                       PIC X(25).

10         SURNAME              PIC X(30).

05    FILLER                                  PIC X(40).



This way I could use ACCOUNT as a primary key or if I so wished I could 
concatenate NAME and ACCOUNT and use that as primary key. Can concatenated 
fields be used as a primary key?

Hi, Paul

A PRIMARY KEY can be a multiple-column index. However, you cannot create a

Most databases allow a *compound* primary key, so that you specify 
multiple columns as the primary key without concatenating them.  This is 
better than concatenated keys because you can use columns of different 
types.

You may want to look into the mcrypt extension for PHP, which supports a
number of different ciphers.

First, I want to say thanks for your solid reply.

Yet, below is a snippet of PHP.net documentation on $_REQUEST which shows that $_COOKIE is also found within $_REQUEST. 

//*****************
//START PHP.net Quote

Request variables: $_REQUEST 
Note: Introduced in 4.1.0. There is no equivalent array in earlier versions. 
Note: Prior to PHP 4.3.0, $_FILES information was also included in $_REQUEST. 
An associative array consisting of the contents of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE. 

//END PHP.net Quote
//*****************


So what I need to know is:

1) By unsetting/eliminating $_REQUEST vars are we also actually unsetting/eliminating cookie vars at the same time.

or 

2) All these PHP arrays ($_REQUEST, $_GET, $_SESSION, $_COOKIE ... ...) are all independent of each other and carry their values discretely and basically sometimes in duplicate of each other. And manipulating the contents of one set of globals vars does not change the other set of global vars during this script run... or what?

Down and dirty calls for a foreach. ;-)

    // whitelist could include type info for validation...
    switch( $whitelist[ $key ] ) {
      case 'text':
        $_REQUEST[ $key ] = validated_text( $val );
        break;
    }
  // end else
  }
// end foreach
}

Maybe you were looking for something more efficient, but being able to
independently validate the values might make it worth a few extra
cycles, depending on whether the downstream code performs validation.

I was wondering if anyone know about a free Open source package that
will allow for recording live video and audio stream for Win OS.

Thanks,

I believe #2 to be the case. $_REQUEST is not populated by reference.

Icecast is a stream server software.  You can creat your own radion station
on the internet.

I want to be able to record a live video stream on windows.

Thanks,

   Hi,

I am looking for the easiest way to put an existing form (PDF) on the  
web for very non-tech users to fill out.? Currently we have a form  
that is downloaded as a PDF and mailed back to us.? I need to make the  
online version as similar as possible to filling out the existing form  
so our users don't get confused.? For the final submit, the data will  
be saved to our DB and the full form will be printed as a PDF for the  
users records.

The way I see it there are two parts to this process:
1. Filling in the form:
I have taken a Word.doc version of this PDF form and saved it as  
HTML.? I don't know if I can trust this layout for all browser and OS  
versions.? Are there better ways to convert word to html?? How do  
other sites handle this?

2. Saving data and printing filled out PDF for user records:
Is there a php library that allows me to place fields in an existing  
PDF which does not have any embedded field names?? This would allow  
users to save the completed PDF to their hard drives which would be  
helpful.

If anyone has any thoughts, suggestions or references to existing  
sites, it would be much appreciated.? I'm looking to get started on  
the right foot with this.? Thanks.

Regards,
Nicholas Hart

Try this:

I've used it successfully on both windows and linux.

I've had great results with FPDF.
http://www.fpdf.org/

1) Create the HTML web form.
2) Use PHP to store the data in your DB and then use FPDF to output a  
PDF to the web browser for the user to print.

I believe that ffmpeg has a windows binary.

Read the website for Streamripper.sourceforge.net and it can only do
video in nvs format which Winamp uses.

I need to record live video in any format from webpages.


Thanks,

Nestor :-)

You might want to check out Flash Media Server to accomplish this. With a very small and simple script you can trigger the users webcam and mic and record the stream to the server for later use.

For Pete's sake, please do not use Word's "Save as HTML" feature. :P It 
makes a god-awful mess that won't render properly in most browsers.

My suggestion is thusly: instead of making them fill out a "PDF" form 
(which means the fields are afterwards difficult for you to get to), let 
them fill out a web form which stores the information in a database. 
When you want to print the information out to a PDF file, use FPDF 
(http://www.fpdf.org) to inject the information into a PDF file (via X,Y 
coordinates) and then output it to the user.

It's much easier and far more flexible this way, and you won't have to 
muddle about with Word documents.

OK,

I decided to use oRipa, because it is the only that I found that would let
me test it
before I paid for it.  Could not find a open source for windows,  there are
plenty for
the Linux os.

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

Nicholas:

You might try something like this:

http://www.sperling.com/a/pdf/

That's all done with free pdf stuff( i.e., FPDF).

Hi,

Anyone know a simple way to read-protect a file/library via a php  
login?  I have a login page which starts a session but there are  
certain dynamically created result files which I need to protect from  
potential prying eyes.

For example, you can connect to https://www.mptf.org:75/docs/TF2.pdf  
but I want to find a way to test your login status before permitting  
you to view this file.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks!

Regards,
Nicholas Hart

Feed it through a PHP page.

Something like:

<?php
	if ($_SESSION['Auth'] === true) {
		// set headers?
		fread('/not/web/accessible/dir/file.pdf');
	} else {
		echo 'Denied, foo.';
	}
?>

I shouldn't be in such a hurry. On review, use file_get_contents($file).

The point is to put the actual file in a directory that is not web 
accessible directly. This prevents people from guessing at the filename 
and pulling in your unprotected private information.

I'm not positive, but you'll probably have to set the headers to set it 
as an attachment and the mime-type pdf.

Yes, you'll definitely want to set the headers, you can do this based on
the extension or use something like the mime_content_type function or
Fileinfo extension.

Also, you can use an apache RewriteRule to force requests for any
documents you want to protect to go to your php script, something like:

RewriteRule ^(.*\.php)$ - [L]
RewriteRule ^(.+)$ protect.php [E=ORIG_FILE:$1,L]

Will force all requests for non-php files to go to your protect.php
script, where you can grab the requested file using the
$_SERVER['REDIRECT_ORIG_FILE'] variable, send the appropriate
Content-Type header and send the file contents.

If anyone has a more elegant way to achieve this or potential security
gotchas I'd love to hear them!

Just a note on creating PDF *forms* and not just PDF documents
(although the OP seems to have found success with FPDF
http://www.fpdf.org/ as suggested earlier)

I've seen recently that Scribus is a good PDF form editing tool, as
described in this article
http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/04/06/1545203&tid=152&tid=39&tid=33&tid=111

There are a couple of scribus wikis describing this, and I'm not sure
if there is a canonical version (the wiki or the docs site)?

On errors, PHP crashes ApacheHello, 

What are these types of "crashes"..what exactly is happening?

What OS are you using .. version? Which PHP/Apache versions are you using?

Infinite loops may cause you to have to restart apache.
I'm curious what you mean by "crash"...

Can you post some sampe code that's crashing apache.

It seems my favorite spot, mwave.com, is slowly going downhill, customer

Anybody care to share where you go when you need to buy the odd hard drive?

For small things like hard drives I order from gcserve.com (very cheap).

Normally when Apache crashes you don't get an error, you just get
blank browser window. Or perhaps you're looking at a log?

In my experience, PHP+Apache only crashes due to exceeding its memory
limit--a clear sign that infinite recursion or looping is taking
place.

Windows XP, XAMPP 1.5.5 (PHP 5.1.6, MySQL 5.0.24a)

I traced the crash to my error handler routine.

The first error ? a missing method -- is captured as indicated below:

Error number: 8 
Error type: e_notice
TEXT: Undefined variable: method
LOCATION: C:\Program
Files\xampp\htdocs\kerbeaz\business_objects\admintasks.php, line 299, at
July 20, 2007, 10:17 am
Showing backtrace:
FilterRecordSet.ValidateForm() # line  266, file: C:\Program
Files\xampp\htdocs\kerbeaz\business_objects\admintasks.php
FilterRecordSet.Init(false) # line  165, file: C:\Program
Files\xampp\htdocs\kerbeaz\business_objects\admintasks.php
AdminTasks.DisplayTasks() # line  227, file: C:\Program
Files\xampp\htdocs\kerbeaz\business_objects\admintasks.php
AdminTasks.DefaultPage() # line   65, file: C:\Program
Files\xampp\htdocs\kerbeaz\business_objects\admintasks.php
AdminTasks.init() # line   43, file: C:\Program
Files\xampp\htdocs\kerbeaz\admin.php

The second error ? an undefined variable ? is picked up as indicated below:

errorno 8, undefined variable min, file admintasks, line 299

But then when my error handler tries to build the error backtrace like that
shown above, this line crashes Apache:
$traceArr = debug_backtrace();
 
That?s where I?m stuck ? I can?t dig any deeper, since debug_backtrace() is
a native php function.

I ordered a hard drive enclosure from them.  It was defective.  They  
shipped another one out right away and took back the one I received.   
No problems.

This is the error message I received from Apache:

Apache HTTP Server has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are
sorry for the inconvenience.

It's one of those Windows popups that says you're screwed with technical
details, send error report to black hole, etc.
 
I single stepped, using Zend debugger. An infinite loop seems like a good
explanation. But the problem hits on the second pass through $traceArr =
debug_backtrace();

What is the best place to bug someone about a pure SQL question? I need

So, any pointers are welcome.

What if debug_backtrace() threw an error for some reason, and it got
caught by your error handling? That probably isn't it, but it's fun to
think about.

That would be a beautiful catch-22. It really sucks when your debugger
crashes Apache -- there's something's just fundamentally wrong with that
picture.

PROBLEM SOLVED!!! FYI everyone:

So...a goggle search turns up plenty of problems with the debug_backtrace()
function. I disabled Zend Optimizer in my php.ini file and now the
debug_backtrace() function works fine.

Go figure.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mod_rewrite changes
Message-ID: <eddeb3d5e3a07ee2a29fcb46280e6d13@jobsforge.com>


Kinda like asking a Wings question on a Beatles list,:


I recently upgraded PHP and had to recompile Apache and all it's 
modules.

I now notice that where I had once never really needed to explicitly 
make a rewrite rule for every case, i.e

RewriteRule /about /about.php

would also work for:

/register going to register.php

and every similar case.

I now have to state each unique case.

Also noticed that for directories:

/?something=something

used to be synonymous with

/index.php?something=something

but no longer is.

Did I miss a directive somewhere?

Message-ID: <001a01c7cb44$e21a7d70$07d6f4a7@ced>

I recently sat down with a candidate for a Software Management/Architect
position here is what I presented:

 Software Architecture
  a.. Name 3 design patterns.

  b..
  c..
  d..
  e.. Which of the following general statements about a class are true?

  f.. Select Answer:

  g.. 1. A class represents a concept in an application domain

  h.. 2. A class defines a new data type

  i.. 3. A class contains data and operations

  j.. 4. All of the above

  k.. 5. None of the Above

  l.. What is the average anticipated load per processor (2GHz) that a web
application server can support? (in concurrency)

  m.. Name 3 Scopes.

  n..
  o..
  p..
  q.. Name 3 Aggregate SQL functions

  r..
  s..
  t..
  u.. Name 3 Network Layer protocols

  v..
  w..
  x..
  y.. Name 3 Transport Layer protocols

  z..
  aa..
  ab..
  ac.. Language agnostically describe how you would do the following:

  ad.. Switch the assignments of variable A and variable B.

  ae.. Reverse the string ?apple? into ?elppa?.

  af..
  ag.. Describe to your best ability the following:

  ah.. Polymorphism

  ai.. Clustering

  aj.. Persistence

  ak..
  al.. Using language agnostic regular expressions how would you do the
following:

  am.. Find ?apple? in ?Christine?s Apple pie?

  an.. Replace the 2nd ?p? with ?g? and change ?Planned? to ?Plotted? in
?Peter Piper Planned Poorly?

Now I thought that these questions were certainly challenging yet basic
enough for an expert software architect, however, and much to my surprise
the candidate wasn't really even interested in looking at it, in fact he
refused to answer any of it. Other than being surprised, and needless to say
concerned, It made me re-visit our many emails a few weeks ago about
interviewing... and here was my conclusion:

1) If you're given an exam, just try your best, but don't refuse, after all,
are you or are you not confident in your abilities
2) When administering an exam, be sure to have informed the candidate before
hand, it gives them the opportunity to prepare
3) In the end, trust your gut. We have all been at various places of talent
throughout our respective careers, you know when someone isn't completely
up-to-speed, and when someone is simply bashful about their skills.

Thoughts?

Frankly, I think that is an arrogant and fascist interviewing technique. 
You only mention informing the candidate about the "test" AFTER the 
fact. Putting an already nervous candidate on the "hot seat" with a 
surpise 'examine' like they were some kind of a highschool student is 
unconscionably irresponsible and most certainly an offensive act and can 
easily be interpreted by the candidate as a hostile environment.
Furthermore, I think that the candidate would be completely justified in 
just saying goodbye rather than playing your silly little game. IMHO. 
You probably already lost the best candidate for the job with your game 
playing so you deserve whatever you get as a result.

The bottom line: Do unto others as you would have done onto you...

Having been on both sides of that table many, many times, you have much 
to learn about interviewing techniques. Unfortunately, you can not 
repair the damage you have already done to the candidates you have 
already humiliated with your arrogance and inexperience.

Too bad...

Mike,

I received your first off-color flame, and am wondering if you read my email
in its entirety, I by no means would 'pop-quiz' a candidate. If you just
read the questions and are assuming that it was 'SURPRISE!', it explains
alot. But if not, I'd ask you to justify your comments and character
assaults.

Sorry Edward if I misinterpreted your email and characterized you 
incorrectly as a bad guy BUT nowhere in the description of what you said 
went down did you say anywhere that you informed the candidate 
beforehand of the test requirement, though you did list it as something 
that "ought to be done". I perhaps assumed that was an "after the fact" 
observation of the failed interview.

My apologies if I misinterpreted your meaning.

Personally, I have done hundreds of interviews over the years and as I 
have stated, been on both sides of the table. I am very confident that 
you can get a really GOOD feeling and a lot of information from a 
candidate by having them go over the details of a recent project that 
they have successfully deployed. It is an excellent opportunity to ask 
very specific details about their skill level and experience.

kindest regards, mikesz

Hi!
What is the best place to bug someone about a pure SQL question? I need 
to join multiple tables and no matter what I do, it just doesn't get me 
the wanted results.
So, any pointers are welcome.

What is live video stream on windows? Are you saying that you want to
capture streaming media as you see it on screen to a file, for later
playback? 

Are you asking for a way to capture your screen (and audio?) of a webpage
browsing experience to a ?streaming? video file with the audio (from a
microphone) and the video (from the browsing session) in sync? There are
different tools for doing each of these tasks. 

 

Are you desiring to record the voice conversations and interactions of more
than one user? Are you asking to record the screen and someone talking as
they interact with the screen, as in recording a user?s interaction with
their computer?  Do you desire to record the ?video? in multiple formats
(using multiple codecs?) and then distribute them in those formats? 

 

Does all this need to operate cross platform so for example, a screen
captured from Windows can be played on Linux? 

 

Each variation typically involves different technology and most of these fit
the description of: record live video in any format from webpages

Read the website for Streamripper.sourceforge.net and it can only do 
video in nvs format which Winamp uses.

I need to record live video in any format from webpages. 


Thanks,

Nestor :-)

Try this:

I've used it successfully on both windows and linux.

Besides the unintersting fact that I couldn't answer no more than one or 
two questions, I wonder what else you asked the candidate. I also wonder 
if that test is necessary given that you probably want candidates with 
experience. I think to put someone through such a test who already 
worked for ten years in sw development is plain silly. I'd take it as an 
insult and even if I could write a dissertation about each topic, I 
wouldn't do it. Read my resume and check my previous work.
Also silly for a recent CS graduate who probably can answer many of 
these questions without ever having completed a project that also 
worked. That test is more applicable when you get a candidate who 
previously did not work in the sw industry, which doesn't mean that 
he/she cannot code. It tests theoretical knowledge, not skill.
In regards to the test, do all of those areas matter substantially to 
what the candidate is later expected to work on? Does it require 
extensive networking knowledge? Regular expressions? SQL? Keep in mind 
that you are hiring a human being, not god.

And as discussed in great detail earlier on this list, just please cross 
off the question "ad.. Switch the assignments of variable A and variable 
B." I think we established the fact that this is a useless exercise.

Oh, and don't use letters if you plan to ask more than 26 items. Use 
numbers - this is the tech writer talking.

And the one that refused to take the test? I'd call him/her for a second 
interview. You do want gutsy people on your team, not just yea-sayers 
and bobbleheads. Of course, make sure that the skills are there by just 
talking to people.

C'mon, they all went to school for 20 years and have some experience. 
You want to treat them like a freshman and give them a bubble sheet to 
fill in? Talk to them, have them explain what they did? Can they do 
that? Do they show passion for what they are doing? Did they do 50 times 
the same or 10 times a bunch of different stuff? Are they eager to 
learn? Your test will not answer any of these fundamentally important 
questions.

Uh, and one other thing, in "an.. Replace the 2nd ?p? with ?g? and 
change ?Planned? to ?Plotted? in ?Peter Piper Planned Poorly?" there is 
no second lower case "p". Maybe that is an intentional gotcha.

Just....talk to the candidates, don't do a test. NCLB doesn't apply to 
the workplace.

I'm getting back the rows that I want, but not in the correct order and 
only by using DISTINCT, which I once was told is a nono and not needed 
if I'd just do it right.
My attempt to output the columns that contain the values the reocrds are 
to get sorted on ends up in being a cartesian join, which barfs up 1248 
rows instead of the 26 I epxect.
I looked at about a dozen tutorials on the web and they all take the 
easy way out and cover joining two tables, which is trivial.

And it has nothing to do with PHP, as the query browser gives me the 
wrong results as well.

I did pop the question on the NYPHP MySQL list, but so far with only a 
few answers and no success.

I'm thankful for any additional pointers.

Message-ID: <00ed01c7cba3$8c37e690$6401a8c0@gamebox>

Hello, 

This week a similiar question surfaced about word docs...

Not Im trying to convert .xls files to .csv files, automatically from linux.

I have a datamining script that fetches data as .xls...anyone have a good
way to turn that data into .csv?

I've looked at catdoc, but have had zero success with:
/configure, make, make install

So, I'm looking for something else.

Thanks!

David,

I agree with everything you've written, and we certainly did discuss some of
the questions I had on there, a complete background was:

That this candidate had started his career in a VERY different industry
He then moved into some project management positions within IS, which were
difficult to tell form his resume what the technical level was.
He had noted several 'projects' that he claimed were enterprise level, but
didn't seem to be what I consider enterprise level, and certainly not for
this position.

So here I was thinking, "Wow, we just touched on all of this on the NY
forum, I can't tell if this would be offensive or if it would be expected."
So I told him I'd be offering him an exam that I felt would be a challenege
to most candidates, but due to the variety of his resume I felt it necessary
to help me gauge really where he was at. After all I'm responsible for
millions not hundreds, and this particular position is VERY high-level. He
seemed total fin with the idea... until he saw the questions... So that was
when I thought I'd come to the forum...

I do plan on reaching out to him again, just to hopefully help to clarify
with him where I'm coming from and the highly technical need of the
position; as well as to continue some of the informal conversations (Which
is where I'm hoping to learn the most). I guess the bottom line is I have
been smoothed talked a lot in my earlier years, and have grown well beyond
that. I know what I want in a mid-level and entry-level guy; but I'm also
far more clear on what I want in a super-guru. I thought that my approach
covered the gammit, but apparently some here think I'm just a big
peepee-head.

-Edward

Wasn't there a way to use OpenOffice from PHP? And wasn't there a module 
for PHP as well? You could load the xls into OO and export it as csv.

I?m looking for a charting package with ajax support. Something that can
create a chart like Google?s stock charts, which has a really cool slider
feature.

I was going to use jpgraph, but don?t see ajax functionality. Some of the
packages out there are flash-based. ChartDirector looks like it might be
able to do what I need. Does anyone have suggestions?

I wouldn't take your test either.

Examine my resume, ask for experience and/or even give me a take-home 
test, but don't test me on what I know in the interview other than 
discussing general concepts.

I have a MSc (which included courses in vector calculus) and I had 
one employer after reviewing my resume wanted me to take a math 
fractions test. I declined and I was history -- what did that test 
prove or to whom's benefit did it serve? Few HR get it right.

Cheers,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Integrated eCommerce/POS?
Message-ID: <46A4237D.2030200@o2group.com>

Just thought I'd ask here.

I'm looking for (open) tools to develop an integrated web-based store, 
and also a POS for the brick and mortar side of the business (two 
locations for an importer of specialty items and antiques).

The client imports a bunch of high-end, mostly unique, items from the 
east.  Ideally, there would be a module for oscommerce or similar that 
wo0uld provide an interface tuned for POS activity.

Anyone have any pointers?

So far, google hasn't turned up much that looks promising.

Without seeing the actual SQL query it's impossible to guess where the 
problem is.  In general though, cartesian joins are the result of 
incomplete join conditionals and, sometimes, overly-complex WHERE 
clauses in cases where a left join or sub-select would be more reliable.

The classic cartesian join:

SELECT * FROM users, orders;

OK, here is what I posted on the NYPHP MySQL list several days ago. That 
list is by far not as active as this one. In the meantime I came across 
VIEWs, which seem to work in the end the same as temporary tables. I yet 
have to figure out why a VIEW is considered as good and a temp table as 
evil.

Hi!

I need some crash course in table joining. I tried several variations 
and the closest one generates the right results as it seems, but not in 
the right order and only by using DISTINCT.

OK, here is the situation. I want record IDs from a table called 
cupssbmain and have those sorted based on position numbers located in 
three additional tables cupsmodules, cupslessons, and cupspages. The 
sorting on modules is to take precedence over the sorting on lessons and 
that has precedence over the sorting of pages. Each table has a column 
called CourseID and I want the sorted sbids for course 23.

My query looks currently like this:
SELECT DISTINCT cupssbmain.StoryboardID AS sbid,
       FROM cupssbmain, cupsmodules,  cupslessons, cupspages
      WHERE cupssbmain.CourseID = 23
          AND cupsmodules.CourseID = cupssbmain.CourseID
          AND cupslessons.CourseID = cupssbmain.CourseID
          AND cupspages.CourseID = cupssbmain.CourseID
      ORDER BY cupsmodules.Module_Position ASC,
           cupslessons.Lesson_Position ASC,
           cupspages.Page_Position ASC

There are a total of 26 rows returned and indeed those values in the 
sbid column are the IDs that I expected, but not in the right order. The 
right order would be 1,2,3,4....26 as I just added the records to 
cupssbmain. I do get 23,11,24,12,25,13,26....

I tried to get some idea of what is going on by showing the fields with 
the position numbers using this query:

SELECT DISTINCT cupssbmain.StoryboardID AS sbid,
         cupsmodules.Module_Position,
         cupslessons.Lesson_Position,
         cupspages.Page_Position
       FROM cupssbmain, cupsmodules,  cupslessons, cupspages
      WHERE cupssbmain.CourseID = 23
          AND cupsmodules.CourseID = cupssbmain.CourseID
          AND cupslessons.CourseID = cupssbmain.CourseID
          AND cupspages.CourseID = cupssbmain.CourseID
      ORDER BY cupsmodules.Module_Position ASC,
           cupslessons.Lesson_Position ASC,
           cupspages.Page_Position ASC

But that no longer gives me the desired 26 rows, but now out of a sudden 
1248 rows showing all possible combinations of the sbid field with the 
three position number fields.

Obviosuly, I'm doing something wrong, but I have no clue what. I looked 
for examples on how to join multiple tables, but they all show only how 
to join two tables. I did try some things, but generally get syntax errors.

Can anyone help me? I could do the sorting in PHP, but I expect the code 
to be somewhat ugly.

Thanks in advance,


David

...and also this....

Hi!

Thanks for the reply. The only common field is the CourseID field. It is 
present in all four tables, has the same type (integer), and is to be in 
all cases 23 (or whatever the ID of the desired course is). My guess was 
that since I limit cupssbmain.CourseID to be 23 and ask for all other 
CourseID fields in the remaining tables to be equal to 
cupssbmain.CourseID that this would be sufficient.

The tables have these columns (and a few others unrelated to this issue):

cupssbmain: StoryboardID, PageID, LessonID, ModuleID, CourseID
cupspages: PageID, LessonID, ModuleID, CourseID, Page_Position
cupslessons: LessonID, ModuleID, CourseID, Lesson_Position
cupsmodules: ModuleID, CourseID, Module_Position

Any advice on how to craft something better out of this? I am at a total 
loss. :(

David

http://l-ane.net/ was the one that I found quite some time ago.  The
company behind the project offers the traditional support and
consulting business model behind the software, and the project grew
out of a real-life implementation so it's not vaporware or dreamware.

The same question was just asked on SlashDot, with many more
references that I don't have time to check out, but shows that there
are many Free Open Source POS projects

Hi David,

I tried replying on the mysql list the other day but never got a bounce 
and it never went through.  Here's what I posted..

I'm taking a guess here and please forgive me if I'm incorrect in my 
assumptions, but it looks like you're going to want to look into your 
normalization.  It seems you  may have too many relationships between 
all the tables.

I'll take a hypothetical guess that the data hierarchy might look like 
this - if not, follow along to see why I'm stating a hierarchy
Courses
   Storyboard
       Modules
           Lessons
               Pages

Where
A Course has a bunch of Storyboards associated with it
A Storyboard will have a bunch of Modules associated with it.
A Module will have a bunch of Lessons associated with it
A Lesson will have a bunch of Pages associated with it

If that were the case, I would make the tables look something like this:

cupssbmain: StoryboardID, CourseID
cupsmodules: ModuleID, StoryboardID, Module_Position
cupslessons: LessonID, ModuleID, Lesson_Position
cupspages: PageID, LessonID, Page_Position

You'll notice that each 'sub table' has only its own id and a 'parent' 
id.  This chain of relationships would allow you to grab all the lessons 
for a specific course by id as long as you join the storyboard and the 
module, or all the pages as long as you join the chain of parent tables 
and so one.  Basically to get to any sub table, you join the parents on 
the way down.

something like this (I added Titles to your sample for display purposes):

SELECT
   s.StoryBoardID,
   m.Module_Position,
   l.Lesson_Position,
   p.Page_Position,
   s.StoryTitle,
   m.ModuleTitle,
   l.LessonTitle,
   p.PageTitle
FROM cupssbmain s
   LEFT JOIN cupsmodules m ON s.StoryBoardID = m.StoryBoardID
   LEFT JOIN cupslessons l ON l.ModuleID     = m.ModuleID
   LEFT JOIN cupspages p   ON p.LessonID     = l.LessonID
WHERE
   s.CourseID = 23
ORDER BY
   m.Module_Position ASC,
   l.Lesson_Position ASC,
   p.Page_Position ASC


Which would give you a flat version of your data - something like this

SBID     M_Pos     L_Pos     Pag_Pos
1      1      1      1      Story 1      Module 1      Lesson 1      Page 1
1     1     1     2     Story 1     Module 1     Lesson 1     Page 2
1     1     2     3     Story 1     Module 1     Lesson 2     Page 4
1     1     2     3     Story 1     Module 1     Lesson 2     Page 3
1     2     3     5     Story 1     Module 2     Lesson 3     Page 5
1     2     3     6     Story 1     Module 2     Lesson 3     Page 6
1     2     3     7     Story 1     Module 2     Lesson 4     Page 7
1     2     3     8     Story 1     Module 2     Lesson 4     Page 8

Or more specifically - but in a flat version
Story 1
    Module 1
        Lesson 1
            Page 1
            Page 2
        Lesson 2
            Page 3
            Page 4
    Module 2
        Lesson 3
            Page 5
            Page 6
        Lesson 4
            Page 7
            Page 8

Otherwise, I'm afraid I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to 
accomplish with your current structure, but I predict a lot of confusion 
into the future without clarifying the order and hierarchy of your data.


Good luck, and have a fantastic weekend!

Mark Armendariz


P.S. As a side note, with a complex sql question like this, it's always 
helpful to offer SQL create and insert statements so people can easily 
and quickly create sample data to help you solve your problem.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Escaping output in array isn't working
Message-ID: <46A4A369.5010507@gmail.com>

Hello

I surely this is easy & I'm just overlooking something...

Basically, I'm wanting to copy $event into $html, but have all the 
values within the nested array escaped with htmlentities().

The problem must be this line:
$v2 = htmlentities($v2, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');

...but I have no idea how to fix it!

Is anyone able to point me in the right direction?

Thanks
Tim


Here's the code:

<?php

# Sample array data
$event[0]['title'] = '"Tea & Biscuts" Evening';
$event[0]['desc']  = 'At my house.';
$event[1]['title'] = '"Cheese & Wine" Lunch';
$event[1]['desc']  = 'At yours!';

# Escape for output into html
foreach ($event as $v1)
{
    foreach ($v1 as $v2)
    {
       $v2 = htmlentities($v2, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
       echo "{$v2}<br>";
    }
}
$html = $event;

echo '<h2>html</h2><pre>';
print_r($html);
echo '</pre>';
exit;

?>

Almost, it is
Courses
     Modules
	Lessons
	     Pages
		Storyboards

That is what I have in my tables. I do carry some IDs in the lower level 
tables that I know I could do without, but knowing from previous work 
with an application I supported, having the whole set of IDs in the 
tables may simplify queries, for example getting all storyboards for a 
course requires then to look only at one table rather than five.

AHA! I see a LEFT JOIN, which probably takes out all those records that 
confuse the query (and myself) otherwise. Given the hierarchy and the 
fields that I need (I do not care about the titles), the query should be 
like this

  SELECT
    s.StoryBoardID,
    m.Module_Position,
    l.Lesson_Position,
    p.Page_Position,
  FROM cupssbmain s
    LEFT JOIN cupslessons l ON l.ModuleID     = m.ModuleID
    LEFT JOIN cupspages p   ON p.LessonID     = l.LessonID
    LEFT JOIN cupssbmain s ON s.PageID 	     = p.PageID
  WHERE
    s.CourseID = 23
  ORDER BY
    m.Module_Position ASC,
    l.Lesson_Position ASC,

Correct?

And I try to prevent this with putting some more effort into 
normalization and keeping the number of fields in tables small. For 
example, cupssbmain has only the array of IDs and a flag field for 
Delete, nothing else. Name or attached files will go into a separate table.
Right now I try to create an array in PHP that contains all the 
Storyboard IDs in the correct order so that I can provide a navigation 
tool for flipping through the storyboards of a course.


Thanks for all your help,

	David

V1 and V2 need to be references. See online php manual

foreach ($event as &$v1)

The problem is that by default $v1 and $v2 are not *references* to  
the elements in the array you are looping through. Instead, they are  
copies of the values, so changing them doesn't have any effect on the  
original array. There are a couple ways around this:

1) if you're using php 5, you can make the value variable in the  
foreach statement a reference by prefixing it with "&":

foreach ($array as &$value) {
    $value = htmlentities($value);
}

2) or you can use the array keys to reassign the value back to the  
original place in the array:

foreach ($array as $key => $value) {
    $array[$key] = htmlentities($value);
}

As Cliff said, you can find the full details here:

Perhaps the test did exactly what it was supposed to.  My assumption is that the company which attempted to give you the test 
wanted not only someone that they could *verify* had certain technical skills, but they also wanted someone who wouldn't be a 
"social" problem.   By also weeding out the people who refused to take the test, perhaps they thought they'd be getting a certain 
kind of worker (one less likely to complain about certain tasks).

I won't try to argue that that's how *I* would hire someone (I'm not that convinced that a test score means much), rather trying 
to look at the bigger picture.

I guess if you wanted a drone, the test could confirm that you got a drone.

I add my vote to the rest of the group. I've been in the industry for 
nearly a decade and if someone at a job interview had presented me with 
that test I would have balked. (I've been asked to provide code samples 
before, which I find completely acceptable.)

I'm certainly no complainer, either, so I really don't think that has 
anything to do with willingness to take a test like that.

I ask ALL candidates only ONE question.  Show me your portfolio of
work.  That's about it. I think anyone can come up with 10 good
questions that can EASILY stump a PhD Comp Sci candidate from MIT if I
wanted to.

One of those life lessons?  Speaking to the team project manager for
IBMs personal computer line (he was one of the smartest hardware
engineers in the world at that time) - I was a young whippersnapper
(AKA wise-ass as my dad would say).  :-)

Me:
1, Question 1 ...... (blah, blah, bandwidth specs, etc).
Him:
Sorry, I don't know the answer to that.
2. Question 2 ..... (blah, blah, ethernet specs?)
Sorry I don't know the answer to that one either.
3. Question 3 ....   (blah, blah, support 7 layer protocol?)
Sorry, I don't know the answer to that one.
"Son, let me tell you something, at one point I knew it ALL.  Now NO
one knows a fraction of  it any more - BUT I can get you the answer.
Now sit down, and shut up."

One of those life lessons. I love the idea that the candidate  said
"I'm not taking that test."  HIRE him!  He' s the kind of coder that
will probably work 30 hours straight to solve a bug when  everyone
else runs out the door at 5PM.

PS... i did venture out about 6 months for a job interview, managing a
fairly large team of coders, got to HR, she asks, "So what would you
do if there was a marij&uana issue with one of you best programmers?
Well, if they did their work, and kept it to the roof, I would have no
issue with that.  Needless to say, she fell off her chair, and I did
not get the job. Looked like a pretty depressing place to work to me.
:-)

O, my own question taking?  Took a Perl test at Goldman way back when,
scored the highest the guy said they had ever seen. Now I'm not sure I
could even write Hello World in perl at this point (but in 1.1 seconds
on google I'm sure I can find the answer), so I think these test have
to thought out before you spring them on someone.


PS  jQuery rocks!  :-)

Yikes there, get turned down at one too many interviews? I think it
incredibly inappropriate to snipe someone looking for advice on, what I had
considered, a professional forum.
Hiring is an art and full time job on its own. Some positions require
textbook knowledge of software development minutia and Information Services
vocabulary. The most direct method for determining whether someone has those
skills is a written test. Although some candidates may be insulted, the
point is to accurately gage what skill set they have within a finite amount
of time; not necessarily to win them over or hold their hand through the
interview process.

I don't think CED's test was an entirely credible way of determining whether
the candidate was right for the job, but then, I don't know what the
requirements are for the position, nor does anyone else on this list. So,
assuming CED is not a fascist, he probably made the best decision he could
in giving the test.

hmmmm, fascist?

I take friends to strange restaurants in WAY out sections of Queens, I
don't let they have menus, use forks or inquiry what exactly is in the
Fish Eye soup (hey, why is there a shoelace in my bowl?  me:  EAT
IT!).  Yes, it gets messy, and they call me a "Food Fascist".  Of
course the die-hards always come back for more.  :-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] inserting data into MySQL table.
Message-ID: <000a01c7cd3d$8d985ba0$0200a8c0@X9183>

I have been having real difficulties try to insert a 20 column record into a 
table (using PHP not MySQL monitor). If I hardcode I can add a record 
.Taking the script that works I then doctor it substituting the hardcoding 
with $_POST values and then fall over (meaning no record is written). I know 
I have got to the point of writing away a record by putting a checkpoint 
just before the write. I have tested the insert-record-into-database with a 
smaller database of 4 columns and it all works fine, but with my MySQL 20 
columns it just doesn't work can anybody see what I am doing wrong?

Id guess that one of your data types (or more) is still not valid for  
the type declared but ~not sure if you know this~ but you can add  
column names before your query ...

INSERT INTO my_table (col1_name, col2_name) VALUES (col1_value,  
col2_value) // Try a few values up until you error out

First do a print_r($_POST) and maybe sure data is valid coming in  
(and make sure to scrub it before you deploy), then dump the $query  
itself to make sure it's valid.

Then look @ CakePHP to save yourself from getting this type of  
headache :-)

I'm not sure if this answers your question well (I know next to nothing
about openid, but your question sparked my interest on the subject), but I
took this from the wikipedia page on OpenID:

*OpenID* is a decentralized single
sign-on<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on>system.

The full article is here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openid

Hope that helps,

Hey David,

I just got around to checking the list... would have replied on the  
NYPHP-Mysql thread... but it seems like it's back here now.

Are you using MySQL?  If not, the syntax could be slightly different  
but should be mostly the same.

Data Hierarchy:
> Courses
>     Modules
> 	Lessons
> 	     Pages
> 		Storyboards

So you're saying that each course has multiple modules... each module  
has multiple lessons... each lesson has multiple pages... and finally  
each page has multiple storyboards?  Are modules, lessons, pages, or  
storyboards shared between courses?  Like could a module appear in  
multiple courses?  Or a lesson in multiple modules or courses?  etc...

I'm going to assume that they are not shared... but I can rework this  
if you come back to me saying that they are.

cupscourses: CourseID
cupsmodules: ModuleID, CourseID, Module_Position
cupslessons: LessonID, ModuleID, Lesson_Position
cupspages: PageID, LessonID, Page_Position
cupsstoryboards: StoryboardID, PageID, Position

Yeah... that's true.  If you put indexes on the ids, it shouldn't be  
too big a deal to join the tables together.  Plus, as you're finding  
here, you have to join them all to get the right position anyway.  De- 
normalizing certain things like that can be useful sometimes if the  
joins are complex enough to really slow down your app... but I would  
say in this case, all the joins are on primary keys so it's simple  
enough to leave it normalized.  Your call though :)

Notice that I split cupssbmain into cupscourses and cupsstoryboards.   
Maybe you already have a "cupscourses" table... if not, I think you  
should create one.  That seems to be the main missing piece from your  
structure.

OK... so now, if I want to select all the storyboards for a course...  
here's the sql:

SELECT
   s.StoryboardID
FROM cupscourses c
   LEFT JOIN cupsmodules m ON m.CourseID = c.CourseID
   LEFT JOIN cupslessons l ON l.ModuleID = m.ModuleID
   LEFT JOIN cupspages p ON p.LessonID = l.LessonID
   LEFT JOIN cupsstoryboards s ON s.PageID = p.PageID
WHERE c.CourseID = 23
ORDER BY m.Module_Position, l.Lesson_Position, p.Page_Position

Just remember there are some "gotchas" when using foreach with 
references. If you do this, remember to unset the variable after the 
loop so you don't accidentally overwrite anything.

I find it even less confusing to use the SET variant that makes
INSERTs look like UPDATEs:

INSERT INTO my_table SET col1_name=col1_value, col2_name=col2_value;

I'd echo the query before sending it to the db engine, copy and paste it 
  into the query browser, and then see what happens. It seems as if you 
do not escape anything and if one of the POST values has some single 
quote or other objectionable character in it the query will not go 
through because of a syntax error. If that is the case, you hit the best 
case scenario of failure, because the worst case is SQL injection.

Since the only difference is the values that you get from $_POST I'f 
take a look at those and print_r the$_POST array for testing (or use a 
debugger for that).

Dingdingding! The left join really did the trick and I now get what I 
expect to get. So, I guess now that I got this settled I better learn 
what a left join is in case someone asks me to explain my code. :)

Thanks to everyone who replied!

Sorry I didn't get back in sooner, but it looks as though Rob took care 
of business.

Glad it all worked out...

Hi everybody,

Thanks for the information, unfortunately for me there are no arrays being 
used. The names used are solely the names of each individual column/field in 
the table. I have already tried all the suggestions to no avail. That is why 
I hardcoded a version of my insert-data-into-table and once I knew it worked 
I substituted all the hardcoded fields with $_POST in place of the 
hardcoding, I then cut and pasted in each field the corresponding  hardcoded 
value and just before writing the record. I echoed the record values and all 
appears to be well. Then via the MySQL Monitor I check to see if the record 
had been written and found that nothing has happened. Please forgive me if I 
appear to be ungrateful, which is not the case I am just frustrated. 
Especially after proving that one version of my insert-data-into-table 
(hardcoded) worked and a version of my insert-data-into-table works with a 4 
column table (a different table) and will not work with a version using as 
input data the values of the hardcoded version. I knows the fault lays with 
me but I cannot see it.

You said you tried everything, so you did echo the query string and 
copied that into the MySQL query browser and that adds the record? If 
yes, you are looking at some db connection error (alhtough PHP should 
throw a fit there). Maybe you sent the records to the wrong 
table/database? That happened to me once while testing on the production 
side. I just copied all the working scripts over, including the one that 
connects to the test database.
So, you want to look for an error somewhere rather than just at the 
result. And you limited the error down to the variable values from 
$_POST. Can you post the query in the exact form as you plan to send it 
to the database in an email to the list? It is possible that a few dozen 
eyes may see more than yours (no, I'm not calling you blind...I hope you 
know what I mean).

Hmm, is there any input filtering going on that is modifying the
values in $_POST, to make them different from the hardcoded version?
Is the dreaded magic_quotes_runtime enabled?

Also, you have a semicolon in your POST test code, maybe you caught
that already?

As far a verifying if I could do fractions, that's pretty lame. If 
they want to verify my education, then they contact the colleges I 
graduated from. In the process, I did tell them that I could prepare 
a math test that no one in their office could pass, but I doubt if 
that helped anything. The interview was long over by then. :-)

In any event, their process worked -- it got this socially 
maladjusted programmer out the door.

But, if that's what they were doing, then I don't really agree with 
the process of insulting someone to judge if their desire for the job 
outweighs their self esteem. Who would anyone want to work for a 
company like that?  (Rhetorical)

Cheers,

The easiest way is when the template identifies itself. I use a script 
for output in two contexts and want to make sure to return to the right 
place. I registered the path of the calling script with the session and 
use that to figure out what to do and where to go.

There may be also a way to use the $_SERVER array, I think one element 
includes the name of the calling page. I tend not use $_SERVER as it 
contains different things with different names or sometimes not that 
much on various servers.

I *beleive* you can do something like this:

<?php
$filename = include("file2.php");
echo $filename;
?>

Somewhere in file2.php:

<?php
return __FILE__;

There's plenty of helpful info in the array it returns.

  Check out debug_backtrace. http://us2.php.net/debug_backtrace
  There's plenty of helpful info in the array it returns.

Sweet!  Here's what did it:

$_trace=debug_backtrace();
echo $_trace[0]['file'];

Outputs /path/to/calling/file, which is a different file in all cases.

Thank you for helping make this a hackless endeavour.

LEFT JOIN actually is short for LEFT OUTER JOIN.  OUTER JOIN means  
that it doesn't require finding a match... if it doesn't, it returns  
null.  LEFT OUTER JOIN means that the table on the left side of the  
join tries to join to the table on the right.

So... for an example, let's say a "user" table has an id and a  
"session" table also holds a reference to the user id.

SELECT u.id, s.id FROM user u LEFT JOIN session s ON u.id = s.user_id  
WHERE u.id = 5

If user id = 5 exists in the user table but there aren't any records  
with user_id = 5 in the session table, the result would be:
u.id		s.id
5		null

If you did an INNER JOIN:
SELECT u.id, s.id FROM user u INNER JOIN session s ON u.id =  
s.user_id WHERE u.id = 5

This would return an empty set because the INNER JOIN requires that  
it finds rows in both tables.  So in your case, I actually think you  
could have done INNER JOINs - but since it's not broken, no need to  
fix, right :)

When you right a query like this:
SELECT u.id, s.id FROM user u, session s WHERE u.id = 5 AND u.id =  
s.user_id

You are doing a cartesian join - the commas imply the join.  Usually,  
this works pretty much the same as an inner join but the difference  
between a cartesian join and an inner join it that the database tries  
to figure out all of the ways that the tables can be joined -- rather  
than just using what you specified in your ON clause.  If you go back  
to your original query, you're joining everything off of the  
cupssbmain tables (based on the links to the CourseID in your where  
clause).  The database tries to figure out all the different ways to  
connect the tables based off this and this is how it wound up with  
the 1248 rows.  Also, the reason the SELECT DISTINCT worked when you  
were just getting the sbid was that it was going through all of those  
rows and eliminating the ones that returned the same sbid.  This is  
why people say that DISTINCT is bad -- because it's a lot of extra  
work for the database to get this huge number of rows and then go and  
figure out which results aren't duplicates.  If you take out the  
DISTINCT part of the query, you can see how many rows are actually  
getting returned and see what the database has to search through.   
When you added the position from the other tables, it then returned  
1248 because that was all the different combinations of sbid, module,  
lesson, and page positions.

Going back to that original query, you can write it like this:

SELECT cupssbmain.StoryboardID AS sbid
FROM cupsmodules,  cupslessons, cupspages, cupssbmain
WHERE cupsmodules.CourseID = 23
   AND cupslessons.ModuleID = cupsmodules.ModuleID
   AND cupspages.LessonID = cupslessons.LessonID
   AND cupssbmain.PageID = cupspages.PageID
ORDER BY cupsmodules.Module_Position ASC,
   cupslessons.Lesson_Position ASC,
   cupspages.Page_Position ASC

I think that should give you the right result.  So... it is possible  
without using INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN.  We had a discussion last year  
on NYPHP-MySQL about INNER JOIN versus commas (cartesian join) -- you  
so often see it with commas in tutorials and other people's code.   
But the concensus we came to was that it's best to be as specific as  
possible... so I've always used INNER JOINs instead of commas ever  
since.

Later,
Rob

It has also been argued that WHERE clauses, even very elaborate ones 
like those above, are preferable to joins, since they are (unlike 
joins) absolutely explicit about what is to be matched, and are thus 
less likely to lead to confusion and problems. I rather like that 
argument myself.

I don't care what POS, as long as I can hack it. 

In this particular instance (low volume, high-value retail/web 
transactions of unique items) what I really need is a very hackable 
inventory management database with *both* a POS interface as well as a 
web-store interface.

I can talk to POS vendors all day, and they just wave their hands around 
and say "sure we can integrate it with your web site", but it's always a 
lie.  The source is generally secret, oftentimes the internal database 
is not documented or even reasonably hackable.

Imagine you're selling masterpieces.  There is only one Mona Lisa, so 
you really don't want to get into a situation where someone buys on the 
web, and then someone else walks out of the shop with it before the POS 
polls the web site and discovers that the ML has been sold. 

Another application for the core database to support might be an 
in-store kiosk, so if you see things you like at location A, the kiosk 
can show you photos of items you can go see at location B if you're 
interested.

At the end of the day, I want *one* central DB of inventory, with at 
least some amount of (hackable) code that drives a POS interface and a 
web store interface.   I'm trying to avoid an integration kludge that 
sells one of those interfaces short.

If I can't find something useful, I might just do it from scratch and 
make it open.  It seems like it's going to be an increasingly common 
itch.  I've done plenty of web stores from the ground-up, but the 
point-of-sale stuff is what I'm more concerned about.

Note, that in this particular instance, it's no problem for the store to 
lose access to the POS in the event of a connection problem.  If the DSL 
goes out for a few hours or even a day, the chances of a collision 
between web & bricks is unlikely, and can be reconciled (low volume/high 
prices & margins).  If the sales staff need to just write up receipts, 
run credit cards manually, and take notes, they can log the information 
against the inventory later.  I guess that's what makes this not already 
a common need.  These guys don't care much about logging who did what, 
or tracking timecard info, etc.  They just want a POS solution that's 
better than their home-grown filemaker DB, and they want to be able to 
sell fancy stuff to rich people on the internet.  They want it to work 
most of the time, if not all of the time, and they want to avoid having 
to enter/reconcile inventory between two discrete systems.

Hope the detail helps, TIA for any pointers.

Hello, 

I believe it was CAKE PHP or one of the framework sites that had a tutorial, "build a dating site in 60 hours"
or something.

Rob,
Is INNER JOIN synonymous with JOIN ON? Does one imply the other?

And do you remember the time frame of that discussion to look it up?

Hello all,

I am currently contracted by my boss to create a candide/company tracking system in PHP/MySQL and have hit a little snag.

Here is the code:

function displayCandidates($managerid)
{
	$sqlcandidates = "SELECT * FROM `candidate` WHERE `managerid` = ".$managerid."";
	$resultcandidates = mysql_query($sqlcandidates) or die('Error, get candidates query failed');

	while($row = mysql_fetch_array($resultcandidates, MYSQL_ASSOC))
	{
		echo "<tr style='border: solid 2px black; background-color: ".$row['color']."'>\n";
    		echo "<td style='border: solid 2px black; width: 100px;'></td>\n";
		echo "<td style='border: solid 2px black; width: 300px;'></td>\n";
		echo "<td style='border: solid 2px black; width: 300px;'>".$row['name']."</td>\n";
		echo "<td style='border: solid 2px black; width: 100px;'>".$row['status']."</td>\n";
		// add a edit button
		echo "<td style='border: solid 2px black; width: 100px; text-align: center;'>\n";
		echo "<form action='./edit.php' method='post'>\n";
		echo "<input type='hidden' name='id' value='".$row['id']."'>\n";
		echo "<input type='hidden' name='database' value='candidate'>\n";
		echo "<input type='submit' name='edit' value='Edit'>\n";
		echo "<form>\n";
		echo "</td>\n";
		echo "</tr>\n";
	}
}

Now that code would create a button at the end of the table row that should call the php file "edit.php" however when I go to the webpage the button links to "names.php" which is the name of the file that contains this code.  I do have references to $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] in the code in other places to call the script itself if certain buttons are pressed but I don't see how that could have interfered.  It is blowing my mind because I thought it would be a simple thing to fix but I can't figure it out.  I even moved the form echo statements to a test file on the server and it does not do this at all.

OK... I actually looked in the manual this time to get some  
clarification - http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/join.html:

"INNER JOIN and ,  (comma) are semantically equivalent in the absence  
of a join condition: both produce a Cartesian product between the  
specified tables (that is, each and every row in the first table is  
joined to each and every row in the second table)."

"Generally, you should use the ON clause for conditions that specify  
how to join tables, and the WHERE clause to restrict which rows you  
want in the result set."

For your question Adrian... I can't find any information backing this  
up... but I'm pretty sure that INNER JOIN...ON and JOIN...ON are  
synonymous.  I did find this "In MySQL, CROSS JOIN is a syntactic  
equivalent to INNER JOIN (they can replace each other). In standard  
SQL, they are not equivalent. INNER JOIN is used with an ON clause,  
CROSS JOIN is used otherwise."  In the join syntax definition they  
show "table_reference [INNER | CROSS] JOIN table_factor  
[join_condition] " -- and that's why I think they're synonymous -- at  
least in MySQL.

I also found the old conversation... now I remember what it was  
about.  I saw an article on contentwithstyle.co.uk saying that INNER  
JOINs were faster and posted it to the list - http://lists.nyphp.org/ 
pipermail/mysql/2006-July/000162.html  Ellen Coen responded that she  
didn't know about the validity of it, but felt that the more  
specific, the better.  That sounded good to me.  http:// 
lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/mysql/2006-July/000163.html  So I guess the  
consensus was just between the two of us... if anyone else can come  
up with a good argument or knows anything more about what the  
database does behind the scenes, feel free to chime in.

Thanks,
Rob

Anyone know of an easy way to rename an associative array key in place?

array( 'vegetable'=>'lettuce', 'fruit'=>'coconut', 'bean'=>'chickpea',
'grain'=>'corn' )

I want the third element to be 'legume'=>'chickpea', but it seems to
involve rebuilding the array...?

What you can do is first identify the key/value pair you want to change. 
Then read out the value, then use unset($array['key']), then add the 
saved value to the array with the desired key name.

Is there an easier way? Maybe...I'd just open the main page for the 
array functions in the PHP documentation and go down the list if there 
is anything that can do that in one line of code. I have it open and 
browsed through the list and the only somewhat likely candidate is 
array_splice...but I cannot figure anything out with these hypothetical 
examples that the PHP documentation always has.

My first proposal will for sure work.

Great question...
I just spent some time to figure it out and came up with a cool way!


check it out!
[sk at tinman fakie]$ cat test.php
<?php
$set = array( 'vegetable'=>'lettuce', 'fruit'=>'coconut', 
'bean'=>'chickpea',
       'grain'=>'corn' );
$set = array_flip($set);
$set['chickpea'] = 'legume';
$set = array_flip($set);

/*
$set2 = array_slice($set, -2, 1);
$set2 = array_flip($set2);
$set['chickpea
*/
print_r($set);


So, I flip it, rename the new index and then flip it back to normal. This 
way lets me edit the index
I normally couldn't edit.

Donald,

Thanks for the recommendation, I tried it and it did not work.  I even
looked up one level to the function that calls this function and I couldn't
trace back and incorrect code.  I moved the code out of the function and put
it in its own php file:

<?php

		echo "<form action='./edit.php' method='post'>\n";
		echo "<input type='hidden' name='id'
value='".$row['id']."'>\n";
		echo "<input type='hidden' name='database'
value='candidate'>\n";
		echo "<input type='submit' name='edit' value='Edit'>\n";
		echo "<form>\n";
		
?>

Results: It pointed to edit.php.  This is weird and mind blowing as well.

The trick is that your new key=>value pair will be at the end of the
array, not the third element.

I need to rename a single key "in-place" in a very large array.

Then use Ben's proposal...way cleverer than mine and it gets you what 
you want. I really don't understand why position within the array 
matters. That is why the values have a key, isn't it?

Could you provide the HTML from the initial setup (the one that was broken)?
I'm curious about what was output to the browser (since that's what dictates
where the form is sent anyway)

Thanks

It looks like the problem is that you're not closing the form properly:

		echo "</form>\n";
not
		echo "<form>\n";

So the browser is probably getting confused on where to send the form  
submission.

Good one! Er, except, it breaks if you have duplicate values in the array.

Try it with  $set = array( 'vegetable'=>'tomato', 'fruit'=>'tomato',
'bean'=>'chickpea', 'grain'=>'corn' );

Oh well. I think I'll have to create a map and use that to keep the
array in order:

$set = array( 'vegetable'=>'tomato', 'fruit'=>'tomato',
'bean'=>'chickpea', 'grain'=>'corn' );
$map = array_keys( $set );
$map['bean'] = 'legume';
$set['legume'] = $set['bean'];
unset( $set['bean'] );
foreach ( $map AS $orig_key=>$key ) {
  print $set[ $key ]."<br>";
}

As Tim Gales is fond of saying, "Any problem in computer science can
be solved with another layer of indirection."

Rob,

Thank you so much for the help.  Cleaned up the <form></form> tags, works
like a charm now.

I don't think the -- $map['bean'] = 'legume'; -- part is doing what  
you expect. It would have to be $map[2] = 'legume' intead.

Are you using php5?  There's an array_combine() function... you could  
do this:

$array = array('vegetable'=>'tomato', 'fruit'=>'tomato',  
'bean'=>'chickpea', 'grain'=>'corn');
$keys = array_keys($array);
$values = array_values($array);
$keys[2] = 'legume';
$array = array_combine($keys, $values);
print_r($array);

That avoids a foreach loop.  I am a little surprised php doesn't seem  
to provide a function for swapping a key name in place.

All that is really needed is a preserve_key to be added to  
array_splice function and you pretty much have it ...

Tom,

Definitely can, I re broke it and the HTML is as follows from IE's source
function.  Now I also noticed that I had a top most nested <form></form>
tags that were not correct so I fixed them all but this is the HTML output
from the non working version.  I wonder if a top level <form></form> tag
will corrupt any other similar tags below it.

Could you provide the HTML from the initial setup (the one that was broken)?
I'm curious about what was output to the browser (since that's what dictates
where the form is sent anyway)

Thanks

Right, I keep forgetting that about array_keys()... I remember using
array_combine() for building just such a key=>key array before.

Indeed. When I saw your post I got all excited about doing something like:

array_splice( $set, 3, 1, array('legume'=>'chickpea') );

But as you point out, "keys in replacement array are not preserved."
Not really worthy of the name "splice" in my opinion.

I looked at that splice function a bit more and at arrays as well. I 
still don't get why the position matters. To me the key of an array is 
like the autoincrement primary key on a table. You can't just start 
messing around with it and expect everything to be fine.

What you could do is split the array into two numerically keyed arrays. 
Each array can then be referenced using the same key and you can then 
change the value of the desired original key in the array with the 
original keys. Once done you glue the two together by specifying the key 
for the glued array.
That preserves keys (except for the one you changed, of course) as well 
as order and can handle duplicates if there would be any.

Sometimes it matters because you want things to be in a particular
order. In this case, I have an array with a whole bunch of form values
for a unit test. I want to rename one of the keys, but I want the
values to be in the same order. Of course there are other ways to do
it, which is probably why no one has bothered to code
array_key_replace().

True, and without jumping through as many hoops as my hack involving $map.

$keys = array_keys( $set );
$values = array_values( $set );
$replace = array_search( 'bean', $keys );
if ( $replace !== FALSE ) {
  $keys[ $replace ] = 'legume';
}
$set = array_combine( $keys, $values );

Thanks, David.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Two objects of the same type in same script
Message-ID: <46A79353.9040705@gmx.net>

Hi!

As recommended to me some time ago, I used the FCKEditor for my current 
project and so far with good success. I will need three editor 
components on the page and now wonder on how to add a second editor 
object. I am totally uneducated in regards to OOP and PHP and I hope 
someone here can fix that a bit.

Currently, I got this:
      $oFCKeditor = new FCKeditor('sbtext');
      $oFCKeditor->Width  = '100%';
      $oFCKeditor->Height = '200';
      $oFCKeditor->Value        = $sbtext;
      $oFCKeditor->ToolbarSet = 'cups';
      $oFCKeditor->Create();

When I now want to initiate a new editor, do I change it like this:
      $oFCKeditor = new FCKeditor('sbnotes') ;
or like this
      $oFCKeditorNotes = new FCKeditor('sbnotes');

So, unrelated to the editor, how do I instantiate a second instance of 
an object?

Any tips are greatly appreciated.

David

Your second choice is the one you want.  The code "new 
FCKeditor('whatever')" returns a distinct FCKeditor object, which you 
should store in a distinct variable.  If you just use the same variable 
as for the first object, $oFCKeditor, you'll overwrite the value of that 
variable and lose the object.

OO concepts can be daunting at times, but in this case it's a simple 
matter of storing someting in a variable.  If you wrote:

	$fruit = 'apple';  // I need some fruit
	$fruit = 'pear';   // I need another kind of fruit

then you'd expect the 'apple' value to be overwritten and gone.  Same 
with the objects.

Hope this helps.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Inserting duplicate SQL primary keys
Message-ID: <C2CD240B.6446%cliff@pinestream.com>

Apologies if this should be in the MySQL list, but it does seem to be a
PHP-level issue.

While testing, I just did a page refresh, which caused this action to be
repeated:

$query_string = "INSERT INTO task_category (task_id, category_id) VALUES
($taskId, $categoryId)";
$this->dbManager->DbQuery($query_string);

Obviously, on the page refresh, it threw an error (DB Error: already
exists), since it was already inserted.

The question:

Where should I be checking for this? Should I just suppress the error with
@$this->dbManager->DbQuery($query_string);? Should I just do a select
before-hand to see if the join is already in the table? Other ideas?

Cliff

Seems like the real problem here is that the application itself is not 
aware of which requests have been submitted already and which haven't. 
Of course you could do some things to skip out the error (error 
supression with @, using "insert IGNORE into ..." to prevent errors on 
duplicate keys, etc.), but I think you will make your life easier by 
addressing the root of the problem: if the page is reloaded, make sure 
the code isn't run a second time, unless that's what's supposed to happen.

In my systems, I'll assign a unique ID (based on microtime) to each 
submitted request (added as a hidden input in forms, else appended to 
the query string), to be stored in the database.  For each request, the 
system checks to see if the ID has been submitted; if so, the action 
code is skipped and only the display code is run; if not, the request ID 
is recorded in the databse, and the action code is processed as normal. 
  Garbage collection routines keep the request-ID cache from getting too 
big but keep the contents long enough to avoid false negatives.

That's just one way to do it.  Others here can probably recommend better 
methods, but I think you have to find some way to do it.  You probably 
don't want to go down the path of just supressing errors all over the 
place, because when a real error surfaces you need to be able to see it 
and handle it properly.

Thanks. Your comment made me realize I already do this, I just had it
disabled for testing -- late day brain fart! But I tend to be paranoid, and
check at probably too many levels.

The simple, straight-forward way would be to just do a search of all the
files that make up your site for the filename. You might hit some false
positives, but it shouldn't be anything unruly.

The alternative, coding, indirect way would be to have the include file
output something to the browser or make some sort of database entry every
time it's called and use debug_backtrace to see who is calling it. This
would then mean going through every possible page on the site and checking
to see if the special output is present.

I would go with the first idea though.

Hi Aaron,

Are you using any IDEs? This can be done using Eclipse's search feature. It
can execute a text search on your entire project directory and return the
file path in a tree branch format of all files containing your text search.

Any multi-file find and replace tool will do the trick. You simply 
replace the include line with nothing. I know of a few tools, but it 
depends on which OS you are using. Also, some IDEs have such an option.

Or...youc write a quick and dirty PHP script that does that for you. ;)

Just fgrep for the filename ...

fgrep -Rn "file.php" /path/to/docroot

Depending on your versioning and app-flow, you can either do a SELECT first
to see if your key exists, or something like:

INSERT INTO table(primaryKey,someData) VALUES (1234, 'test')
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE someData = VALUES('test');

Jon's would return more references (including comment references and such)
Could also do this - specific to php includes

find -name '*.php' | xargs grep -E "(include|require)(_once)? 'file.php'"

Very handy might need to $1 it + save that command.  Thanks Mark.

Combine that with a little sed and you would be able to do your full  
find + replace in a single line.

I recommend rpl if you're a unix person...

There's a Debian package, other distros probably have it too.

I'm using a text editor, BBEdit on Mac OS X.  It has a nice find  
feature but as far as I can tell it's only applicable for local  
searches on my hard drive.  It doesn't look like you can use the find  
feature on a remote ftp/sftp site.

Rpl is nice...

I went ahead and got carried away with a php5 solution...  I know it 
could be refactored pretty far down, using filters and a recursive 
directory iterator, but f-it, i need to actually get some work done this 
evening.  Sure would be great to have the time to make a refactoring 
library, no?  Or even pick up some java to do such things for zend's 
eclipse project (pdt).  one can dream... but not too long lest he end up 
homeless.

<?php  
    function getExtension($sFile) {
        return array_pop(explode('.', $sFile));
    }
   
    function findFiles($sDir, $sPattern, $aFiles = array()) {
        $oFiles = new DirectoryIterator($sDir);
       
        foreach ($oFiles as $oFile) {
            if ($oFile->isDir()) {
                if ($oFile->isDot() === false
                &&  $oFile->getFilename() != '.svn'     // Shake fists 
violently at subversion directories
                &&  $oFile->getFilename() != '.bzr') { // Shake fists 
violently at bazaar directories
                    $aFiles = findFiles($oFile->getPathname(), 
$sPattern, $aFiles);
                }
            } else if (getExtension($oFile->getFilename()) == 'php') {
                $sCode  = file_get_contents($oFile->getPathname());
                if (preg_match_all($sPattern, $sCode, $aMatches)) {
                    $aFiles[$oFile->getPathname()] = $aMatches[0];
                }
            }
        }

        return $aFiles;
    }
   
    function findIncludes($sDir) {
        return findFiles($sDir, 
'/(include|require)_?(once)?\s+(?:\'([^\']+)\'|"([^"]+)")/');
    }
   
    function findClasses($sDir) {
        return findFiles($sDir, 
'/class\s+([a-zA-Z0-9]+)(\s+extends\s+([a-zA-Z0-9]+))?\s?{/');
    }

    function dbg($var) {
        echo '<pre>' . print_r($var, 1) . '</pre>';
    }
   
    dbg(findIncludes('D:/W/Enobrev/Library/'));
    dbg(findClasses('D:/W/Enobrev/Library/'));
?>

Have a funtastic evening...

Hi,

How does one determine if a command line PHP script is being executed as root?

If there's no posix extension there's no posix_getuid and if the user
did 'su' and not 'su -' then the USER environment variable may not be
root.

Any other ways?

One possible way ...

$php whoami.php

$sudo php whoami.php
root

For what it's worth, on my linux box, su root results in the same
thing as su - root, uid==0.

It may depend on the shell in use, I don't know, but it seems pretty
important unixwise to return the correct UID no matter what the
environment says.

Good morning, 

So, I have a script where I'm calling:

    function ReceivePOPEmail($popObject)
    {
        $error = $popObject->Login($popObject->username,$popObject->password,
                                   $popObject->apop);
        if ( $error != '' )
        {
            /* We've had an error. */
            Error::Log("Error: " . HtmlSpecialChars($error), LOG_LEVEL_ALERT);
            return PROC_FAILURE;
        }
        return PROC_SUCCESS;
    }

that's function ... I don't want to pass the Error Object around, so I just want to call it via:
Error:Log(.....);

Now, inside the Error class, there is this code:
            case LOG_LEVEL_ALERT:
                $this->Backtrace( );

Which is getting executed. But I'm getting the error:

PHP Fatal error:  Using $this when not in object context in /var/www/html/sk/OOPLIB/ERRO.php on line 101

So, how do I call that class's method w/out passing the object around?

want to call it via:

Error:Log(.....);

 

Now, inside the Error class, there is this code:

            case LOG_LEVEL_ALERT:
                $this->Backtrace( );

 

Which is getting executed. But I'm getting the error:

 

PHP Fatal error:  Using $this when not in object context in
/var/www/html/sk/OOPLIB/ERRO.php on line 101

 

So, how do I call that class's method w/out passing the object around?

Hello, 

Thanks, both your fixes fixed this issue.

However, it broke it in another place.

PHP Fatal error:  Using $this when not in object context in /var/www/html/sk/OOPLIB/ERRO.php on line 80

Inside the Backtrace( ) function I have:
        $this->builtMessage = $errorStr;

To save the message to a string within the object. I can't do self::builtMessage = $errorStr,
so what can I do?

Here's the backtrace function:

    static function Backtrace( )
    {
        $btSet  = debug_backtrace( );
        $iValue = 1; /* [0] is the traceback for the Error:: *///sizeof($btSet) - 1;
        $eSet   = $btSet[$iValue];
        
        $errorStr = "\ndate: " . date('r')
                  . "\nfile: " . $eSet['file']
                  . "\nline: " . $eSet['line']
                  . "\nfunction: " . @$eSet['class'] . '::' . $eSet['function']
                  . "\nargs: ";

        /* Build a list of the functions arguments. */
        while(list($argIndex, $argStr) = each($eSet['args']))
        {
            $errorStr .= "[${argIndex}]$argStr ";
        }
        $this->builtMessage = $errorStr;
    }

Which is called from another function:
            case LOG_LEVEL_ALERT:
                self::Backtrace( );

Try self::$builtMessage = $errorStr;

 

Or another option is to adopt the singleton pattern.  This will give you the
same instance of the Error object anywhere you try to use it in your code.

 

Something like:

 

class Error {

  private function __constrct () {

  }

 

  public function GetInstance () {

    If (self::$instance == null) self::$instance = new self;

    Return self::$instance;

  }

 

  public function Backtrace () {

    // code from below

  }

 

  private $builtMessage;

  private static $instance = null;

}

 

And in your code:

 

$err = Error::GetInstance ();

$err->Backtrace ();

Hello Andy, 

I tried your 1st, quicker method, I get:

PHP Fatal error:  Access to undeclared static property:  Error::$builtMessage in /var/www/html/sk/OOPLIB/ERRO.php on line 81
        self::$builtMessage = $errorStr;

builtMessage is declared as:
        $this->builtMessage = '';
in the class.

I am still learning OOP and had just started it when I wrote this code ...
So, I may need to rework it, but I'd prefer to not do that right now.

If you don't have PHP's POSIX extensions you can get it from the shell 
with the 'id -u' command.  If it returns the string '0' then the user is 
effectively superuser.

I created a MySQL database with tables. In one of the tables, the Customer 
Name& Address table, I use as the PRIMARY KEY a numeric field that I call 
LICENCE which is a number generated through a random number generator.

When I set the table up I set the LICENCE to INT(8). When populating this 
field I was expecting any number larger than 8 digits to be truncated and 
any number less than 8 digits to be padded out with zeros, in both cases 
this is not happening. LICENCE is being populated with a random number of 
varying size returned from the random number generator. sometimes 9 digits, 
8 digit, 7 digits and so on; but each time a unique number. I thought INT(8) 
meant an interger of 8 digits long, no more and no less. Does anybody know a 
way around this?

The way interpret the size setting is that it is the maximum length in 
characters. So I am a bit surprised that you can stuff something longer 
in the field. I never would expect MySQL to pad anything as there is no 
means to know by MySQL what you want it to be padded with.
I also wonder if one can limit an Integer field by character length 
anyway. Before crawling through the ifs and buts of MySQL, I'd just pad 
the number, if that is necessary at all. You should be able to set the 
random number generator to spit out integers of fixed and thus the same 
length.
Keep in mind that there is no real randomization with those generators. 
They use an algorithm that on millions of tries likely generates 
millions of different numbers, but does not guarantee to do so. That 
scam is the same in any programming language I ever came across. I'd go 
with something that is really unique, such as the unix time stamp. 
Unless you anticipate more than one entry per second that will be as 
unique as it gets as there will no second be repeated ever 
again....well, unless the system clock doesn't run on GMT and gets 
potentially set back from a time server sync. You can combine unix time 
stamp with the numerical portions of the current session ID (assuming 
you use sessions). That ought to do it.
Is there any specific significance to the LICENSE field (I doubt it)? 
Maybe you can make it to be the primary key and set it to autonumber or 
read the highest field value and add 1 through code.

Nope.  An Int is an Int is an Int.  The number in parentheses specifies how 
large the zerofill will be, but, oddly, you have to specify the zerofill 
separately.

So if you declare a column as "int(5) zerofill", it means that it's an int 
(four bytes of storage, range 2^31 to -2^31), and if you output it and it's 
less than 5 decimal digits, it will be padded with zeroes up to five 
characters.

It's bad practice to intentionally try to truncate data when inserting it 
into a table.  I might come along later and fix your "bug" without 
understanding what you were trying to do.  Probably you should tell your 
random number generator to give you a number of exactly eight digits, if 
that's what you want.

Hi Mike,

Thank you for pointing me in the right direction. My problem was 
mis-understanding what INT(8) meant.

Randomize a number, convert it to a string, pad and truncate as you 
want and use a string and not int.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] alternate to scandir()
Message-ID: <100414.17442.qm@web30814.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I am currently using PHP version 4.3.10 and need a bit of help.  I created a script to display images in a directory.  part of the script is shown here :

$dir=$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."coles/admin/new_images/".$_FILES['image']['name'];
$files=scandir($dir);

this opens the directory and an returns an array of files and directories found within the folder.  The array is assigned to $files.

the problem is that when i execute the file, i am getting this  warning:

"Call to undefined function:  scandir()...."    and points to this line: $files=scandir($dir);

is there an alternate syntax to writing this function call in version 4.3.10? and wher can i find a link to a manual for this version?
thanks

  I am currently using PHP version 4.3.10 and need a bit of help.  I created a script to display images in a directory.  part of the script is shown here :

  $dir=$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."coles/admin/new_images/".$_FILES['image']['name'];
  $files=scandir($dir);

  this opens the directory and an returns an array of files and directories found within the folder.  The array is assigned to $files.

  the problem is that when i execute the file, i am getting this  warning:

  "Call to undefined function: scandir()...."    and points to this line: $files=scandir($dir);

  is there an alternate syntax to writing this function call in version 4.3.10? and wher can i find a link to a manual for this version?
  thanks

Try using glob() instead. You'll probably use it something like this:

$fileList = glob($dir.'/*');

http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.glob.php

BTW: something looks funny with your line that computes "$dir". Is  
$dir supposed to be a file or a directory?

As Ben stated, scandir is only available in PHP 5.  As you stated, you are using PHP 4.

The manual page to which Ben linked provides an alternative to the scandir function for users of PHP 4.

Hey Y'all:

I encourage everyone interviewing job candidates to look at portfolios, 
ask technical questions and have them code some stuff for you on the 
spot.

I asked an interviewee to pseudo code a basic operation for me.  The 
person wrote code with several unnecessary steps and didn't accomplish 
the goal requested.

I suggested we don't hire them.  Well, the powers that be did anyway.  
Then everyone on the team got to see similar convolutions, etc.  
Fortunetly, they were let go not too long after they were brought on.

Hi Guys,

Actually what I settled on was:

function is_root() {
    if (is_writable('/'))
        return TRUE;
    if (extension_loaded('posix') && posix_getuid() == 0)
        return TRUE;
    if (getenv('USER') == 'root')
        return TRUE;
    return FALSE;
}

But looking at this now I think perhaps
function_exists('posix_getuid') would be better than extension_loaded.
I'll have to change that.

Also, I guess is_writeable('/') isn't fool-proof.

Mike

Hi Paul,

While researching something completely unrelated (general field
validation stuff), I ran across this, which seems to be exactly what
you're looking for:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/numeric-types.html
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/numeric-types.html

(across versions)

Truncating...
"The display width does not constrain the range of values that can be
stored in the column, nor the number of digits that are displayed for
values having a width exceeding that specified for the column. For
example, a column specified as SMALLINT(3) has the usual SMALLINT
range of -32768 to 32767, and values outside the range allowed by
three characters are displayed using more than three characters."

Number Padding:
"When used in conjunction with the optional extension attribute
ZEROFILL, the default padding of spaces is replaced with zeros. For
example, for a column declared as INT(5) ZEROFILL, a value of 4 is
retrieved as 00004. Note that if you store larger values than the
display width in an integer column, you may experience problems when
MySQL generates temporary tables for some complicated joins, because
in these cases MySQL assumes that the data fits into the original
column width."

(digression) Which confuses me as all this time i figured an unsigned
TINYINT(1) was a good boolean field and find it rather disappointing
that it makes no difference.  As far as I can tell, the length hint is
specifically for display purposes, which seems... well, useless -
considering I can't recall the last time I used SQL to show data
anywhere outside of a console window and could care less about the
column widths there. (/digression)

Hi Everyone,
I am working on Windows 2000 test and production boxes.  The production was
very out of date, so I began building the test box up.  On the test box I
have Instant Client, Apache 2.0.39, and PHP 5.2.2.  It works fine.  On the
production I just attempted to update it to the same.  It had on it, Oracle
Client 9 and Webserv 1.1.3 (it is a package that has Apache, MySql, and
PHP).  I removed both Oracle Client 9 and Webserv.  I installed Apache, PHP,
and Instant Client.  I could not connect to the database.  I used the same
tnsnames, the same httpdconf, the same php.ini from the test.  I had the
msvcr71.dll and oci8.dll in sys32.  Couldn't connect.  In frustration, and
that its a production box, I tried to rollback to client 9.  Then I got a
PHP error, unable to load php_oci8.dll.  I did not get this error when
instant client is called.  I can use a db utility and connect to the Oracle
Database.

Facts:

Both boxes have Windows 2000.
Production is real server hardware, test is a desktop.
Database to connect to is Oracle 9i.
Test box was a fresh install of OS, production was not.
Production was running PHP 4, upgraded to PHP 5.

If anyone would be able to provide assistance, it would be extremely
appreciated.

I found that Oracle 9.2 client is not compatible with PHP5.  Any ideas why
the Instant client was not working properly?
