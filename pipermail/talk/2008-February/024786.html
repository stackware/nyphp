<PRE>I don't know if anybody else has been having a problem when trying to FTP 
PHP scripts. I am using &quot;1and1&quot; to host my website and have uploaded  PHP 
scripts All have uploaded. Unfortunately some scripts are loaded correctly 
and other arrive as 0 length. No matter what solution is suggested by 1and1 
Tech. Support or tried, nothing appears to work I simply cannot overwrite 
these 0 length scripts. I have even deleted the sub diectory and reFTPed 
over new. The interesting thing is it is alway the same scripts that are 0 
length, I have rename the scripts and ftp them and still no joy. I have 
looked at the scripts but there is nothing to suggest anything that could 
stop an FTP, which is logical anyway, as what is contained within a script 
should not affect a script's upload.

&quot;1and1&quot; level2 support say, they cannot reproduce the problem and I am able 
to demonstrate it to their level1 support, thus the reason for level1 
support esculating the problem to level2 support. I have tried doing 
everything they have suggested and now have used FireFTP, Filzilla and Wise 
FTP5 to upload. I am now scrapping the bottom of the barrel, I would not 
have thought that this has anything to do with PHP; But just in case, has 
anybody else had this FTP problem and what was the solution?

Paul
