<PRE>NYPhP:

I have been holding off on this, waiting until things are &#179;perfect&#178;, but
finally realized that could be an eternity. So...

Kerbeaz went live on Monday. I thought the hard part was behind me, but now
the true adventure begins &#139; building traffic.

Check out the site. Try creating a task as a performer or sponsor. Would
love to receive any and all feedback &#139; don&#185;t be shy; don&#185;t hold back! Based
on the few users that have tried it so far, I have a laundry list of things
to do, ranging from a new splash page, to more merchandise (of course), to
bug fixes, new features, etc. The kids are the easy ones &#139; walking my father
through it was pure torture:

Dad: &#179;I never received a confirmation email after registering&#178;
Me:   &#179;Duh, you registered using Mom&#185;s email&#178;
Dad: &#179;How come Abby never responded?
Me:  &#179;You misspelled her email address&#178;
Me:  &#179;Why did you make the reward 1 point? That&#185;s one penny. What were you
thinking?&#178;
...
...

Targeting seniors &#139; what was I thinking?

Most importantly....

Thank you NYPhP. If you hadn&#185;t noticed, I ask a question or two...now &#140;n
then....  There is no way I could have accomplished this without your
support. Everyone makes a big deal about open source. Well, the reality is
it&#185;s not open source that matters, it&#185;s the community support that is the
backbone of open source. The level of sharing and support is truly
inspirational. I&#185;d love to repay whoever I can. Next time I&#185;m in NY, the
beers are on me. And if any of you plan to visit Boston for Drupalcon, to
heckle us over the upset (we all know what that refers to now &#139; right. No
need to further rub it in), or for any other reason, please look me up.

Many thanks,
Cliff
