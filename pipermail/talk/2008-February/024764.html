Hi Marc,

If you really care about security this isn't really the kind of thing
that you should dream up on your own. What your describing is called
&quot;Single Sign-On&quot; or SSO for short.

Are your sites on the IntErnet or on an IntrAnet?

If your sites are on the IntErnet OpenID is one solution although I
don't know what sort of access control it offers such that you can
stop anyone with an OpenID account from accessing protected parts of
your sites. There's also something called Stanford WebAuth which is
Free so you can setup your own isolated auth server.

If you're on an IntrAnet there are a lot of products that do this sort
of thing. SiteMinder is one that's been around for a long time.

Although SiteMinder, Stanford WebAuth and products like it are not
*true* SSO since you have to enter your credentials twice - once to
login to your workstation and then again with the auth site. With true
SSO users never have to enter their credentials at all when they
access a site, they just go right on. True SSO is sometimes referred
to as Enterprise Single Sign-On.

If you want &quot;Enterprise SSO&quot; there's something called SPNEGO
authentication which is a special feature of IE and some other
browsers like Firefox. Microsoft calls this Integrated Windows
Authentication or IWA. IIS supports SPNEGO but PHP can't access much
info about the user once your authenticate and of course you have to
use a Windows web server.

Finally, my company (yes this is a proprietary pitch after all) offers
a full featured SPNEGO solution specifically for PHP on Linux and
FreeBSD. See sig for details.

Mike
