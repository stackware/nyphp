<PRE>Hello Matt,

Thanks for the note. I loaded the page in my browser, copied the source, 
and uploaded that for the client to test.

As far as table rendering, there really shouldn't be an issue since the 
page is just one table with maybe half a dozen rows, one or two columns max.

I'll try validating my html, but I doubt there are any major issues with 
it; the page is pretty simple, just pretty big.

I doubt I can get the client to use Firefox, but probably can get them to 
upgrade their IE to version 6.

Daniel earlier suggested that even though the client and assistant are on 
different machines, they're &quot;probably on the same network and using the same
route over the Internet to/from your server. Have them run trace route.&quot; 
But actually the client and his assistant are at two different companies, 
different machines, networks, etc. Unless of course they are in the same 
building and are sharing the same connection, which I guess is possible. 
I'll check.

With some tips from Brent, I implemented a potential fix that he suggested 
earlier, &quot;My recommendation is to change you code so you are storing 
everything in a variable, then echo the variable when you have everything. 
That will probably speed everything up considerably.&quot; Still waiting for the 
client to test and get back to me.

Rahmin suggested breaking up the long form with the list of bands into a 
few smaller pages, but the client already complains that there are too many 
pages to click through.

So, that's where I am right now...

Thanks to everyone for their help so far.

Harvey

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello NYPHP,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I've got a page that works totally fine for me. Takes a few seconds

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; on cable connection with IE 6 PC. Works fine for a colleague with 
</I>&gt;<i> DSL on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the Mac (not sure which browser). But for the most important person
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; (client!) the page is taking over a minute and a half to load. He's 
</I>&gt;<i> on Win
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; XP and IE (probably 6) with cable connection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why are you looking at code changes when the problem is obviously with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the client's computer/connection?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You should find out what the problem is before you start fixing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Same thing happened to the client's assistant in a different location 
</I>&gt;<i> on a different system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe both their connections are slow. Can't change that. But I can 
</I>&gt;<i> change the code if that will help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is not a slow connection problem unless every page on your site loads 
</I>&gt;<i>slow for them. You could test by making a very simple, text/plain page 
</I>&gt;<i>with as much content as your bands/shows page and seeing if they download 
</I>&gt;<i>it faster. But I think I know what's going to happen (it will load fast). 
</I>&gt;<i>If it does load slowly, they have bigger problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Nor do I think it's a problem with your code, unless you are generating 
</I>&gt;<i>bad HTML (have you validated it?). The browser doesn't see the php, only 
</I>&gt;<i>the HTML. And if it goes fast for you, the php part is fast. I suspect a 
</I>&gt;<i>table-rendering issue with their browsers, or maybe they have some funny 
</I>&gt;<i>filtering setup that scans big pages slowly, or whatever (they, hopefully, 
</I>&gt;<i>should be able to tell you what the &quot;whatever&quot; might be). Or maybe (like 
</I>&gt;<i>most Windows computers out there) they're crammed with viruses and spyware 
</I>&gt;<i>and ... In any case, most likely it's on their end and changing your code 
</I>&gt;<i>won't fix it, unless you can remove all HTML tables from the generated 
</I>&gt;<i>page and/or you're sending bad HTML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>First, test the connection by having them download a large, but simple 
</I>&gt;<i>page. Second, validate the HTML your code generates. If it validates your 
</I>&gt;<i>code is good, or good enough. Third, Firefox is free. Ask them to install 
</I>&gt;<i>it and try your (validated) pages with Firefox. Or, if they don't want to 
</I>&gt;<i>install Firefox, have them update IE to exactly the version you're using, 
</I>&gt;<i>or something newer (check to verify what they're actually using--you're 
</I>&gt;<i>not sure, right?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Note: I am more of an admin than a programmer. If that was my network, I 
</I>&gt;<i>would assume something was wrong on my end and take responsibility for it. 
</I>&gt;<i>I sincerely believe that your responsibility here is to generate valid 
</I>&gt;<i>HTML (unless they specified otherwise :-)), and anything else is their 
</I>&gt;<i>problem. Maybe that's difficult in some way, but you shouldn't be afraid 
</I>&gt;<i>to say it. If there's something wrong over there, they should know about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Good luck,
</I>&gt;<i>Matt
