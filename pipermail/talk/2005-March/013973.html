I concur that Atomz had a very nice search product, but expensive. I was 
quoted $20k for the Atomz service for less pages than requested here. I 
used that version of Atomz for two years and it was very good.

Atomz was recently acquired by Website Story, and is being integrated 
into their analytics software suite. It will not be a stand-alone search 
product any longer. From the webside story site:
&quot;*Atomz* name will be sunset upon closing of the transaction and the 
organization will operate as the WebSideStory Search and Content 
Solutions Business Unit.&quot; and  &quot;Some of the products are already 
partially integrated, such as HBX Analytics and *Atomz* Site Search. 
Deeper integration should occur within one year. The engineering 
organizations are working on an integrated roadmap that we will announce 
in the coming months.&quot;

As you can see from swish-e and DTSearch the problem is indexing quickly 
and managing the index. In my experience there is no good product right now.
