It's been my experience (and MySQL certainly encourages this approach)
that databases are frequently not reused. Obviously, I can't
generalize to all of the database usages out there - there are lots of
different patterns. But I think developers for a while have been
slowly migrating to strongly tying this kind of thing to the
applications rather than the data stores. Accessing the same data is
then not done by connecting straight to the db, but through an API
provided by the app, which enforces your model rules. This gives you
better portability to other data stores within the context of the app,
but less easy reuse of the data directly, but also a different kind of
distributed functionality.

Whether that's a good thing is arguable - I think there are tradeoffs
both ways. But it's definitely a pattern I see a lot of.

In, I must point out, a language that's specific to the database. I'm
sure you've tried to migrate MSSQL stored procedures to Oracle, yes?
Not what I'd call pretty.

&gt;<i> you can share that logic with any application that can connect to your

Heh.
