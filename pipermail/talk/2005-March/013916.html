<PRE>Harvey,

If you have phpMyAdmin on that server run your SQL queries with the 
COMMAND &quot;EXPLAIN&quot; in front of your SELECT Queries. Make sure your have 
the proper indexes on the tables.

Someone previously suggested copying all output to a variable then 
transmitting it to the browser.  This will increase the speed of your 
page loading.  There will be a slight pause on request but then it just 
flows in.

500 - 1000 form items is quite a bit of formatting for the browser so 
make sure all formatting is done via CSS. It's one setting for all 
TABLES, TRs, TDs, INPUTs.

Good Luck,
John Nunez

&gt;<i> Hello Matt,

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the note. I loaded the page in my browser, copied the 
</I>&gt;<i> source, and uploaded that for the client to test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as table rendering, there really shouldn't be an issue since

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt I can get the client to use Firefox, but probably can get them 
</I>&gt;<i> to upgrade their IE to version 6.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel earlier suggested that even though the client and assistant are 
</I>&gt;<i> on different machines, they're &quot;probably on the same network and using 
</I>&gt;<i> the same
</I>&gt;<i> route over the Internet to/from your server. Have them run trace 
</I>&gt;<i> route.&quot; But actually the client and his assistant are at two different 
</I>&gt;<i> companies, different machines, networks, etc. Unless of course they 
</I>&gt;<i> are in the same building and are sharing the same connection, which I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess is possible. I'll check.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With some tips from Brent, I implemented a potential fix that he

</I>&gt;<i> storing everything in a variable, then echo the variable when you have 
</I>&gt;<i> everything. That will probably speed everything up considerably.&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> Still waiting for the client to test and get back to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rahmin suggested breaking up the long form with the list of bands into 
</I>&gt;<i> a few smaller pages, but the client already complains that there are 
</I>&gt;<i> too many pages to click through.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, that's where I am right now...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to everyone for their help so far.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello NYPHP,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I've got a page that works totally fine for me. Takes a few 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seconds to load
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; on cable connection with IE 6 PC. Works fine for a colleague 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with DSL on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the Mac (not sure which browser). But for the most important 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> person
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; (client!) the page is taking over a minute and a half to load. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He's on Win
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; XP and IE (probably 6) with cable connection.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why are you looking at code changes when the problem is obviously 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the client's computer/connection?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You should find out what the problem is before you start fixing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Same thing happened to the client's assistant in a different 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> location on a different system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe both their connections are slow. Can't change that. But I can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change the code if that will help.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not a slow connection problem unless every page on your site 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loads slow for them. You could test by making a very simple, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> text/plain page with as much content as your bands/shows page and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seeing if they download it faster. But I think I know what's going to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happen (it will load fast). If it does load slowly, they have bigger 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nor do I think it's a problem with your code, unless you are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generating bad HTML (have you validated it?). The browser doesn't see 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the php, only the HTML. And if it goes fast for you, the php part is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fast. I suspect a table-rendering issue with their browsers, or maybe 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they have some funny filtering setup that scans big pages slowly, or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatever (they, hopefully, should be able to tell you what the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;whatever&quot; might be). Or maybe (like most Windows computers out 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there) they're crammed with viruses and spyware and ... In any case, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most likely it's on their end and changing your code won't fix it, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unless you can remove all HTML tables from the generated page and/or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you're sending bad HTML.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, test the connection by having them download a large, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple page. Second, validate the HTML your code generates. If it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> validates your code is good, or good enough. Third, Firefox is free. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ask them to install it and try your (validated) pages with Firefox. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or, if they don't want to install Firefox, have them update IE to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exactly the version you're using, or something newer (check to verify 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what they're actually using--you're not sure, right?).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note: I am more of an admin than a programmer. If that was my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network, I would assume something was wrong on my end and take 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responsibility for it. I sincerely believe that your responsibility 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here is to generate valid HTML (unless they specified otherwise :-)), 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and anything else is their problem. Maybe that's difficult in some 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way, but you shouldn't be afraid to say it. If there's something 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrong over there, they should know about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good luck,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Matt
