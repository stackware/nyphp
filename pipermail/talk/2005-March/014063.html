<PRE>Sorry for the vagueness.

Here is an example class I might write in order to retrieve
information for my news page:

class News

var $id;
var $rs;

  function News($id)
  {
     $this-&gt;id = $id;
     $query = &quot;SELECT * FROM news WHERE id = $this-&gt;id;&quot;;
     $result = mysql_query($query);
     $rs = mysql_fetch_array($rs);
     $this-&gt;rs = $rs;
  }

  function getTitle()
  {
     return $this-&gt;rs['title'];
  }

  function getCategory()
  {
    return $this-&gt;rs['category'];
  }


etc with more methods almost identical to that
}

Also, it's not that I necessarily want to write OOP for everything,
but I don't like being lost when reading code with OOP in it.  I
understand some of it, but a lot of times certain things go right over
my head.

</I>&gt;<i> That's code re-use. You can achive it without using OO.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; website for someone and have someone else maintain it with ease.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which can be done without OO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My advice is that you look for basic sites that explain Object Oriented
</I>&gt;<i> programming and once you better understand the concept see if you think
</I>&gt;<i> you like it and if it will be helpfull to you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Brother was attempting to explain to me how to do OOP without double
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; querying the database, but it was over the phone and it was a bit more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complicated
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you post the class you wrote myself and others would be able to give
</I>&gt;<i> you feedback on your class.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking for are some tips on how to use it properly, or some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recommended books / websites that explain this.  Thanks in advance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will try and give you my 2 cents version of what OO is.
</I>&gt;<i> It's a way to see operations based on items (or objects as used in the OO
</I>&gt;<i> lingo).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whereas before you would have functions like
</I>&gt;<i> format(string)
</I>&gt;<i> compute(number)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OO tells you to think of &quot;objects&quot; and how different operations can be
</I>&gt;<i> performed on them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example you could have a class &quot;figure&quot; to refer to a geometrical figure.
</I>&gt;<i> You could think of what type of interaction you would need with such as
</I>&gt;<i> figure such as finding it's area or volume.
</I>&gt;<i> In the non OO world you would have something like
</I>&gt;<i> area(figure)
</I>&gt;<i> volume(figure)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But how do you know the figure has a volume?
</I>&gt;<i> In OO you have
</I>&gt;<i> figure.area()
</I>&gt;<i> figure.volume()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The class itself can handle returning the proper value if there is a
</I>&gt;<i> volume or perhaps 0 if the area is only 2 dimensions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am certain there are very decent explanations/tutorials out there in the
</I>&gt;<i> net on OO. Once you understand the concept it is not very difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> apply it to PHP.
