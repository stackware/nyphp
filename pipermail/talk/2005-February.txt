Hi folks..

I have 2 servers I work on:
- cobalt raq 3
- ensim redhat

I wanted to install some type of php/apache/mySQL services on my laptop so i
can hack up some php stuff..

Can someone make a recommendation of a bundle for windows XP which will work
on both the platforms above.. I'm postive both have legacy issues ( php
4.xxx/mySQL 3.xxx ) etc.. so grabbing a bundle with the newest php/mySQL etc
might be overkill plus result in certain issues not working once they get
off the laptop and onto either one of the servers...

I've used firepages in the past and really enjoyed it.. but the bundle was
usually the newest stuff and i ran into the legacy issues...

http://www.firepages.com.au/

any advice?
regards
yury

I have squandered the last several minutes trying to determine how old
dirt actually is, i.e., how long "dirt" itself has been in existence (on
Earth). I know it's gotta be older than PHP.

Perhaps one of you clever NYPHPistas you knows some geology can help us
out.

No, not the word "dirt," but its referent -- the substance itself! (-:

 (how old is dirt?)
Recent archaelogical investigations have shed some light on this 
question. Dirt was invented in Egypt around 6023 BC. Before this time 
farmers had to grow their crops directly on top of rocks, resulting in 
poor yields. The Egyptians discovered, quite accidentally during the 
construction of the Great Pyramids, that plants grow better in ground-
up rock than on solid rock. This ground-up rock, which we now 
call "sand", was the first dirt. So successful was the idea that rock-
grinding became a huge new industry in Egypt in only a decade. Too 
huge, in fact, and an industry-wide shakeout put nearly 80 percent of 
the rock-grinders out of business. Their excess stock can still be seen 
today in the Sahara Desert.

What experts recognize as the first modern dirt was developed about 
1000 years later in Assyria, when the eldest son of a struggling rock 
grinder named Zom (now called the "Father of Dirt") fell into the rock 
grinding machine. The resulting mix of sand and organic material proved 
to be far more potent as a plant growing medium, and the old-fashioned 
sand soon was obsolete. Unfortunately the Assyrian civiliation 
collapsed soon thereafter, what with all the children being ground up 
to make dirt, but in neighboring Babylon the idea was taken up and 
further developed. The Babylonians realized it wasn't necessary to 
grind up their own children; they could obtain equally good results 
simply by grinding up other people's children. This discovery paved the 
way for the Babylonian Empire.

In Rome circa 2044 BC, inefficiencies in the collection and grinding of 
dead children led to the discovery of the next leap forward, compost. 
With this improvement, Roman dirt became the world standard, and it was 
produced with such efficiency that we still use it today.

Message-ID: <41FFD62E.9060603@cyberxdesigns.com>

I am working on migrating a site from one server to another today.  On 
the old server there were multiple domains pointing at one virtual site 
eg:  www.domain.com, domain.com, www.domain.org and domain.org all point 
to the same virtual site and therefore the same content.  (Duplicate 
content.)  I am trying to devise a migration strategy that will include 
301 redirects and DNS. 

Do the search engines handle A records and CNAME records differently?  
If www is a CNAME to domain.org, is that the same as two A records 
www.domain.org and domain.org as far as search engines are concerned?  
Is that subject to the duplicate content penalty?  Do I need to create 2 
distinct virtual sites one for www and one for domain.org and have one 
of them redirect to the other?

With apache you can use the Alias directive, meaning that anything
pointed at an entry under Alias will get fed to the virtual host
silently.

You could also use redirects for each vhost, so everyone eventually
learns where the consolidated site lives.

I'd like to see what others have to say on this as well.

An A record assigns an IP to the domain, so that's not the issue 
w/respect to search engines. Your issue is in the virtual hosting or C 
name/alias configuration.

Your means of implementing a C name (alias) will determine if it is 
"appropriate" or not. For example I have seen cpanel implementations 
(older) deploying 302 redirects, and I have seen cpanel (newer) 
implementing c names as a transparent alias (Apache simply generates 
200OK plus the site content), which appears to the search engines as a 
completely separate site (hence duplicate content). With a modern cpanel 
set the c name alias and then put a 301 in place at that location for 
each additional domain to feed the primary domain. I guess that is the 
same as you called "Do I need to create 2 distinct virtual sites one for 
www and one for domain.org and have one of them redirect to the other? 
". That is what I do.

It is always best to test and examine headers. Avoid 302's and if yu 
have multiple domains serving the same content make sure all but one are 
robots.txt for noindex (as a mirror).

I can't see how A vs. CNAME records can possibly make a difference to
crawlers. CNAME is simply a matter of convenience within DNS -- it
allows you to change the IP address on one A record and have it apply
to many hostnames.

It has nothing to do with HTTP or Redirects at all. 

That said, all of John's comments apply at a higher level, which is
where you should be concerned if multiple virtual hosts point to the
same content.

I do something similar.  I have all domains point an A record at the
same IP, which normally would cause duplicate content.  To solve that I
have an include that goes in the my prepend of every site that looks
something like:

    $Config['Hostname'] = 'www.somedomain.com'

    if ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] != $Config['Hostname']) {
        Header("HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently");
        Header("Location: http://" . $Config['Hostname'] . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . (StrLen($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'])? "?".$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] : ''));
        exit();
    }

... which ensures that the hostname being used to access the requested
page is the one we want to be called by...  "I'm not Drew, I'm Andrew!"
I call this "hostname assertion".

Regards,
Andrew

Yeah, I would assume that the very early Earth is too hot for dirt to
exist as such, and that it forms some time after things cool down, and
that there's a technical term for that period -- a term one could throw
around next time someone uses the expression "older than dirt" (-:

I do something similar.  I have all domains point an A record at the
same IP, which normally would cause duplicate content.  To solve that I
have an include that goes in the my prepend of every site that looks
something like:

    $Config['Hostname'] = 'www.somedomain.com'

    if ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] != $Config['Hostname']) {
        Header("HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently");
        Header("Location: http://" . $Config['Hostname'] .
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . (StrLen($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'])?
"?".$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] : ''));
        exit();
    }

... which ensures that the hostname being used to access the requested
page is the one we want to be called by...  "I'm not Drew, I'm Andrew!"
I call this "hostname assertion".

Regards,
Andrew
<

Interesting to see PHP used to "bypass" Apache config...sort of (?)

What I wonder is why this might be a good thing to do? It won't get called
unless Apache says it belongs (hence you still have to set all the A
records) and then this has to tell apache to redirect anyway (which it
would have done if properly configured).

Maybe I ammissing something or maybe it's like mountain climbing?

Hi gang,

Hope this isn't too off-topic, but there's plenty of Mambo users here
and this is only to help -

We just fixed a problem with sites that run with register_globals
enabled, and it allows for a particularly nasty remote PHP injection
attack to occur.

You can get patches and a new release (4.5.1b) here:

Hey, I'm a geologist (by academic training, anyway). Dirt comes from 
rock. The oldest possible dirt would then be about 3.5 billion years 
old, since the oldest rocks on the planet are about that old; but any 
dirt formed that long ago would have become rock again at some point in 
its history.

Given the periodicity of subduction/orogeny, probably no dirt ever gets 
to be more than a couple hundred million years old before being washed 
out to sea, sedimented to the ocean floor, and either compressed into 
sedimentary rock, or failing that, subducted and either remelted 
(becoming igneous rock upon cooling) or metamorphosed. Of course most 
dirt would turn into sedimentary rock much more quickly than that: 
sedimentary rocks form on scales on the order of hundreds of thousands 
to millions of years, rather than tens or hundreds of millions.

There are places where, theoretically, dirt could last longer--I'm 
thinking of the trailing edges of the continental shields, like the east 
coasts of North and South America (among others). Those places are 
stable, at least until the worldwide pattern of plate tectonics 
collapses into some other pattern. That happens roughly every 500 
million years or so (don't quote me on that--but I bet I'm right within 
a factor of 2). But really most dirt would get buried and turn into 
sedimentary rock relatively quickly, anyway.

Thanks for asking!!

One day, a Pretty Sharp Guy decided to ask God about some stories he'd 
heard.

[PSG] umm... Hi God, what's happenin'?
[G] The Usual...
[PSG] Mind if I ask you a coupla questions?
[G] Shoot, you've got the floor.
[PSG] Is it true you can make stuff?
[G] What kind of stuff do you mean?
[PSG] You know, "stuff".  o O (if he's God, he should know what I mean)
[G] I know what you mean, but I like when people ask me specifics.
[PSG] o O (how did he know what I was thinking?)
[G] waits...
[PSG] Well, I heard you can make things. Ants, bugs n' stuff like that.
[G] This is True.
[PSG] And bigger n' more complicated things like dogs and platypusses.
[G] Well, I just slapped the platypus together real quick.
[PSG] I even hear that you make donkeys.
[G] Yep.
[PSG] Donkeys are pretty stupid.  I could probably make one myself.
[G] You think?
[PSG] Sure, it's just a matter of puttin' the ingredients together.  It 
can't be THAT hard to do.
[G] You're right.  It's easy.
[PSG] I think I'll just show you how it's done.  (goes to get some dirt)
[G] WAIT!!
[PSG] What?
[G] Get your own dirt.

// load user cert

 $fp = fopen("04.pem", "r");

 $cert1 = fread($fp, 8192);

$cert2=openssl_x509_read($cert1);

$cert_data=(openssl_x509_parse($cert2));

 

// state whether signature is okay or not

You could use PHP to generate a different page depending on what a user 
clicks on but this would require a round-trip to the server for every 
change. I would say Flash is a better way to go in this case.

I'd say an attractive idea would be to create a flash animation that
allowed one to select what music/sounds to hear, and toggle that sound
on/off. This would degrade gracefully, as folks with flash turned off

Message-ID: <8d9a428005020209086d8b80d9@mail.gmail.com>

Can anyone here explain or point me to a good description of what a
static class is.

My assumption is that it is an instance of a class that will be
available for many users on the site, say user a goes to the site,
they can use the static class, it increments users to 3 then user a
leaves the site, the object still exists, user b goes to the site and
it increments users to 4 etc...

i have been told by a few people that static classes are only static
while that one user is on the site, so each user get's thier own
static object.

here is what i am thinking.

I have been wanting to create an online game such as worldofhatred.com
and pimpkane.com but i wanted to make my game much more in depth and
maybe create a framework that can be used for many games at one time.

the underlying engine would need to be a static class so that it could
keep track of how many players are playing, game settings etc...

if the object is created with each user visit this will not work,
however if it is created when the very first person goes to the site
and stays going after the very last person leaves (basically until i
tell it to destroy) then this could work

Are you building a decision making system in PHP?
(otherwise I don't see what this has to do with this list)

Anyway -- there are lots of javascripts out there.

I didn't read your whole inquiry, but let's answer what I think you're 
asking.

Static has to do with how it can be used.  In object oriented programming, 
when using a class, one normally instantiates a class into an object 
variable, like this:

  $o = new SomeClass();
  $o->someMethod();

But, when a class is being used statically, you can use the method 
directly:

  SomeClass::someMethod();

But, be aware that functionality is limited when using classes statically 
because $this is not available inside the methods.

Of course it is PHP, otherwise I wouldn't have posted. The whole chess site is 
in PHP.

All you need to do is store the data you want to be global in the 
database and access it from each client.  So long as you write your SQL 
to avoid problems with concurrent users this will work 100% fine.

Fellow PHP Folk,

I've seen postings for shopping carts and online catalogs in the past.  I've just been asked for something similar, but with a twist.

I have a new client who is a theatre with a very small budget.  They have recently gotten credit card set up through a local bank and want to sell tickets online.  

The current web host already has a certificate so there is no cost associated with secure https access to certain pages in the existing site.  

They want to collect orders and run cc's manually with their new cc machine.  As all seats are General Admission, there is no need for immediate cc processing online.

So... does anyone know of an open source, or low cost, app or module (e.g.Xoops) that I could set up and make appropriate cosmetic changes?  The budget is so small I can't see many billable hours here.

As always, your input is greatly appreciated,

PJF

Hey Patrick,

You can try osCommerce.  You might need to setup each show as a product 
and then stock count to maximum seating per show.  I have heard about 
Mambo's PHPShop?  But I haven't tried it yet.

It may help (or not) to think of these objects and methods like static 
web pages, being the same for everyone.
Which is why you can't use $this, because it is not particular to an 
instance of the object, but to the whole class of objects.
Likewise, static methods do not operate on an instance


Object->method();

but as shown in the previous post above, and often taking some action 
on a parameter fed to the method like this worthless example


class MyMathClass {
  ??  public static function squareroot($num) {
  ?? ? ? return sqrt($num);
  ??  }
  }

MyMathClass::squareroot(4);

my question is how long will the object reside on the server though?

i understand that the object is the same for all users, but what if
the site has 0 users, does the object still exist? does it still
retain all the information?  when another visitor comes, does it
continue to use that instance or create a new instance

You are confused. Static objects are constant within the request, but
they do not persist between requests.

A new instance. Here is a better way of thinking of static in an OO
context. Static properties are similar to namespaced global variables;
static methods are similar to namespaced functions.

You can refer to them anywhere within a script without worrying that
they might vary from instance to instance. (i.e. based on specific
instance data.)

You cannot set a value in one request and then access it in a second
one. As Dan says, that's what a database is for.

Hey folks,

I've put together a walk through on configuring an existing IBM HTTP 
Server - WebSphere Application Server - DB2 UDB Enterprise Server Edition 
installation to work with PHP 5.   For good measure, I added a little 
MySQL 4.1 configuration as well.

     Configuring PHP 5 with IBM HTTP Server, WebSphere Application Server, 
and DB2 UDB
     http://krook.net/os/php-ihs-websphere-db2-mysql.txt

I was surprised that this all went down pretty smoothly, but since IHS is 
really Apache under the hood, I guess it was always easy to do, though no 
Googling fetched results on anyone else who went through the process. 
Hopefully this helps out others looking to set up an all-in-one LAMP/J2EE 
development box.

The tutorial assumes that you have a Linux box already set up with IHS, 
WAS, DB2 and MySQL which all have pretty good installation instructions 
from their respective sources.

Please let me know if you have any improvements I can make on any part of 
this.

Thanks,
-Dan

There are quite a few reasons why I don't let Apache do this.  Its
extremely useful in various situations and for various reasons.  In
general, its a consistent method that works for me and its part of my
usual framework.

If you're on a shared host, you don't always have control over Apache.
For instance, as you pointed out earlier newer CPanel versions park
domains w/ an A record pointed at the same IP, creating dupe content.
On a dedicated box w/ control of Apache you might still use this to
allow less technical people to have a method of managing requested URLs,
add new domains on-the-fly (you actually don't need to have it configed
in Apache if there is only one site on the box), etc.

Having a more complex version than the simple example above lets you
manage how these alternate domains are handled - either by redirecting
to the same desired domain with the same requested path & query string,
or maybe to a specific page.  Think of a site called paintstore.com who
buys latexpaint.com and wants the latter to redirect to
paintstore.com/latex - easily managed if its all handled by your PHP
application.  Or, paintstore.com buys paint.com and wants to convert
that to their main domain.  This is a challenge to perform properly to
maintain your SEP.  You can even transition a user's session between old
and new domain so that there is no interruption for users at the time of
the cutover.  If you have code in there to inspect and manage the
requested URLs you can globally implement 301s, create hooks, etc.  Let
your imagination go.  There is a lot more power in having PHP in there
than just Apache, IMO.

Sure, some of this can be done in mod rewrite. And I do use some mod
rewrite stuff to complement this and even have some PHP to manage mod
rewrite rules.

Your thoughts on this?

Well, I don't know about mountain climbing. Maybe its like taking the

Absolutely. Not only do I agree, but I practice it to a much greater 
extreme than your example. I just wondered why you did it your way, 
since you didn't go to as far an extreme, and you have to configure the 
Apache directories anyway.

I avoid mod rewrite whenever possible because it is just that - 
re-writing. Via PHP, you can "write" correctly, and avoid having to 
"re-write what you wrote".

The big IF is IF you have total control over all aspects of the site. IF 
you do, you can do amazing things. IF you do not, you may end up 
rewriting. Of course it must be driven by strategy.

The power is in having a clear strategy when the site is conceptualized, 
so that the architecture can be designed to support the objectives. I 
don't know of too many business objectives that are directly met with a 
"design the look and feel of the display of the content and then code a 
back end to support it" approach. That's bass ackwards. So is "code a 
back end to serve up the data we will need on each page, and then design 
the display of that data" approach. Both cases for some reason assume as 
a requirement that the site must be made of interlinked pages which are 
rendered at run time as a linear combination of content and style. That 
may have been the case in 1996 but it is not the case for most business 
websites today. Neither considers the user interaction with the site 
data or pages to be the primary factor to accommodate, and especially 
when that "user" is a search engine.

As you suggested, if you can free yourself from that restrictive 
mindset, all sorts of possibilities come into view.

I meant the old "why do you climb the mountain?".. "because it is there"

You might want to mention (as a reminder) that you can optionally 
run 'make test' in step 6. of section II.

I liked the reminder to run 'apachectl configtest' to make sure 
that no errors have crept into the Apache config file.

Quick story:

I work for a local newspaper website, but we are a big News 
Corporation. Lots of money and lots of Java technology.

We are about a month behind schedule for a launch of a hosted 
obituaries solution with an outside vendor.

The IT department was working on a feed script. I asked how it was 
going.

"We are really busy. we may have to hire someone from outside to write 
it. "
I heard this as "it's tougher than I thought, I don't know regular 
expressions very well."
I don't know this worker well, though I heard he is a Solaris snob. (I 
have nothing against Solaris, only his disregard for FreeBSD and Linux)

"Do you want to take a look at it?" they asked.
"Okay, " I said, "what platform is it running on.?"
"Unix or Mac OS X." (lots of Macs in the Printing business)

That was at ten a.m.
By  the time I left, PHP had it working.
I probably could have done it without preg_match , but I used it anyway 
as it  made it more flexible.

Now I probably saved the company a thousand dollars, the IT project 
manager a headache, and myself some drudgery, since we upload the obits 
manually every day till this gets launched.

But I won't even get a free lunch.

It's running on an OS X server, so PHP was installed already.
I saw the IT director.
"hey, did you hear about that script I wrote for you guys? blah blah"
"really, what did you write it in?"
"PHP."
"What's that?"

"OOooh that hurts."

I work for a big IT consultant, and we are 98% a Java shop. About two 
years ago, I turned one of our guys onto PHP. He loves it. He's always 
complaining now about how he can do things in 2-3 lines of PHP that take 
  so much more effort in frameworks like Struts.

I've been playing with it. Some aspects of the UI seem a little obtuse,
but it certainly feels fast. I've found a couple of security issues in my

Judging from their website it appears they are completely delighted with

Actually, I saw it quoted, and here is the part that was quoted:

One implementation would be to store the secret in the user's session:

    $_SESSION['secret'] = $secret;

Yikes! That sure is a weak secret.

I'm sure the date for edits has passed, but would anyone mind if we

I'm no license expert. But I plan to be one in the coming months/years.

But this seems like a point of contention between different OS licenses 
that might become divisive for certain causes.

Hans -- this got cross posted from the NYCBUG list, so a little
background might be in order.

He's referring (I think) to this post on FreeBSD-Questions:
http://tinyurl.com/3z98f

It's about Clustering, not Replication. The claim is that the cost to
license MySQL Cluster for non-GPL'd applications is ~$5,000 per cpu.
Which limits the market somewhat, but probably addresses some real
support and implementation costs on MySQL's end. One suspects that as
the tech matures the price will come down.

Either that, or we're going to be seeing a lot of GPL'd cluster
implementations that just happen to be accidentally used for
commercial purposes. Oops.

Message-ID: <0a87d92dc73b4c9eb029ec75de965395@jobsforge.com>

Allow me to ramble a bit. i know it's no revelation and I'm not sure I 
have a point.
I don't think anyone at my Super Bowl party will care. :^)

A few months back we had a discussion about errors.

I think everyone was in agreement about E_ALL and numerous other 
details, but I never quite fully bought in to the danger of sending 
errors to the browser during development, though of course I understand 
hiding them from the end user.
You just instead  tail -f the error log, which is fine.

But anyway, that's not why I started this thread.

I was testing my shiny FreeBSD 5.3,  PHP 5.2, PostgreSQL 7.4 install on 
a web page trying to connect to the DB.
I have the file open in Emacs and making edits, saving and testing in 
the browser.
I noticed errors get displayed in Emacs. True also of Vi.

I'm not sure whether I like this or not. Also happens when errors are 
only being logged and not displayed.

I guess it was never an issue because I usually save and close, then 
test, or if working remotely, use a local editor and transfer files.

Not as dangerous if you are working locally on the server, but if SSH'd 
in, then  the ease of Mac cut and paste could accidentally write the 
errors to a source file.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP 5 and IIS
Message-ID: <8d9a428005020713206410a55b@mail.gmail.com>

guys i have installed PHP using the ISAPI modules however i am having
problems...

i have specified the extension_dir in php.ini to reflect 

extension_dir = "c:/php/ext/"

but whenever i restart iis it tells me that it is unable to load the
c:/php/ext/php_mysql.dll because it doesnt exist.  I have physically
checked and the dll is there.

any help would be appreciated.

Hey Everyone,

i recently setup php 5 on my windows machine and moved a site from a
linux machine to this machine.  I am having an odd problem.  On the
linux machine everything works, the registration form submits does all
the error checking etc.. On the windows maching though, nothing works,
i mean the pages all load fine but when i submit the login or
registration form (only 2 forms completed as of yet) it just reloads
the page.  doesnt show any errors or anything, also i have an if(
isset( $_POST['submit'] ) ) { and i added an echo 'here' for debugging
and it doesnt echo so it's not executing the on post code.

I am not sure why i would get this, i have register_globals turned
off.  Is there some setting in the php.ini that would be stopping this
and causing this effect?

A while back I heard of some weird things with IE relative to testing 
for 'submit'.  Try putting a hidden field in the form and setting it to 
a value of "1".  eg. a field named "go".

<input type="hidden" name="go" value="1">

Then the test would be:

if (isset($_POST['submit']) || isset($_POST['go'])) {
	// stuff...


see if that changes anything..
HTH,
John

Joseph:

I strongly suspect 
    print_r($_POST);
will provide you some insight in the matter.  If that doesn't set off any 
lights in your head, check phpinfo() from both machines and compare the 
settings (and don't you DARE post the phpinfo() output here :) ).

very odd, $_POST is an empty array even after the form submission,
nothing is getting set, what could be causing this?

As I said, look at the differences between phpinfo() from your old and new 
machines.

I've got a situation where I need to adjust the kerning on some text
generated by the GD ImageTTFText function.  Anybody else run into this?
I'm pretty sure I know what needs to be done and know I don't have the
time nor patience to code it.  I was hoping that someone could point me
at a OS library/class/function that does this?  I've had no luck.

Thanks!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [ OT ] - PHP Web Hosting.. Connecting to MSSQL remotely
Message-ID: <8d9a428005020806017e40eaa1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

i have been struggling with using a windows host so that i can connect
to a MSSQL remote database, i have this all working using COM to do
so, however i would really like to get away from the windows hosting
platform.

does anyone here have a host that they currently use to connect to a
MSSQL database using either FreeTDS or some other method where you can
use the mssql_* functions?

i am really tired of COM already and the support from the web host is
unbelievable. They are having problems with MMap being able to read
the file that is executing and they are telling me that i need to tell
them what configs to change in order for them to fix the problem.... 
I dunno what kind of web host will change anything a client says, nor
one that doesnt know how to setup thier own machines.

If anyone here knows of a good linux host that they have used or
currently use and CAN connect to a remote MSSQL database, please reply
to this.

We need a new host!!

(sorry if this shows up twice, gmail timed out while I tried to send
this response)

I have had issues with this at my previous job - their intranet server
was an IIS machine running on a 2000 server. If I had a protected
directory for user logins, say phpmyadmin (because they wanted root
access to all of the IT personel, which then used IIS built-in auth).
It posted fine, but once your browser session went to view php pages
that werent in protected pages, the $_POST variables would not send at
all.

It took me a while to figure out that it was going in and out of the
protected pages - as I would edit pages & have phpmyadmin loaded. I am
not sure what caused this, or what the fix is, but all I had to do was
close my browser and re-open.

I dont know if anything else can cause this, but that is how I saw
those issues come up.

if it's just learning C# that you're running IIS for...

take a look at mono:

Also, can you tell us a little bit about the windows setup like what o/s 
(and SP)?

ok, I've had trouble running XAMPP at a place that just installed SP2 on 
XP.  I've not run IIS for a long while, but it may be something that SP2 
is doing to you.  Is it safe to assume that PHP5 works fine with Apache 
on your windows box?

John,

I run 4 systems in my office and now avoid SP2 on all but the notebook.
XAMPP worked flawlessly on every one except the one that had SP2. I didn't
play with it I just wiped it and re-installed w/everything BUT SP2 and it
works fine.

Anectodal evidence, but backed up by a friend who just reported XAMPP
failure after accepting SP2. XAMPP should be easy uninstall, no registry
hooks, but a re-install didn't work either.

Not solid evidence by limited experience. I have had no trouble with direct
installs of PHP5/MySQL/Apache2 on XP either but again, I don't use SP2.

For the record I just now received a video card driver update from ATI to
fix SP2-related problems on XP. That's what, 8 months later? Now if I could
just eliminate the VIEWMGR.EXE crashes I just started getting...

yeah, I've got a note scribbled on my whiteboard that I just glanced at 
"xampp xp sp2" -- it's on my todo list to have a look at.  Although I 
run XP Pro, I do not have SP2 installed.  I did do some preliminary 
poking around with Google and saved this note:

***************************************************************
File Name: WindowsXP-KB884020-x86-enu.exe
Download Size: 507 KB
Date Published:  9/17/2004
Version:  884020

Overview
This update helps resolve an issue on computers running Windows XP 
Service Pack 2. Programs that connect to IP addresses in the loopback 
address range may not work as expected and you may receive an error 
message indicating you cannot establish a connection. After you install 
this item, you may have to restart your computer.
************************************************************************

This does not sound like the problem Joseph is experiencing though.  He 
didn't mention an error and I got an error when I tried it.  My backup 
plan when I go into a place to deliver a class is Knoppix and USB drives.

Thanks for the info,
J

I've got SP2 going and have no problems with using MySQL 4.0.x and 4.1.x, 
Apache 1.3.x and PHP 4 & 5 (all installed separately).

i found the culprit,

/ *
if( get_magic_quotes_gpc() ) {
	
	if( isset( $_GET )) {
		$_GET = array_map( 'ArrayStripSlashes', $_GET );
	}
	if( isset( $_POST ) ) {
		$_POST = array_map( 'ArrayStripSlashes', $_POST );
	}
	if( isset( $_COOKIES ) ) {
		$_COOKIES = array_map( 'ArrayStripSlashes', $_COOKIES );
	}
	if( isset( $_REQUEST ) ) {
		$_REQUEST = array_map( 'ArrayStripSlashes', $_REQUEST );
	}
}

// just a recursive function to strip slashes from variables/arrays
function ArrayStripSlashes( $val ) {
	if( is_array( $val ) ) {
		return array_map( 'ArrayStripSlashes', $val );
	}
	else return stripslashes( $val );
}
*/


some reason that code was hindering the super global variables.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] xml_parse and CDATA
Message-ID: <4208F70B.8000308@crisscott.com>

Hello,

I am having some trouble parsing XML files and determining what is text 
between two elements (<tag>Some text</tag>) and what is text inside 
<![CDATA[ ... ]]>. xml_parse() is giving both types of text to the 
function I set as the cdata handler but it doesn't give any indication 
of whether or not in was inside a CDATA tag. It acts as if the <![CDATA[ 
part wasn't there at all.

Does anyone have any tips on how to tell if this is text between two 
tags or text following a <![CDATA[?

Thanks,

Joseph,

did you try asking in the FreeTDS user group.  They probably been thru it and can give you an answer.
I used to be a member of that list and they were very helpful.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [ OT ] - PHP Web Hosting.. Connecting to MSSQL remotely

Hello everyone,

i have been struggling with using a windows host so that i can connect
to a MSSQL remote database, i have this all working using COM to do
so, however i would really like to get away from the windows hosting
platform.

does anyone here have a host that they currently use to connect to a
MSSQL database using either FreeTDS or some other method where you can
use the mssql_* functions?

i am really tired of COM already and the support from the web host is
unbelievable. They are having problems with MMap being able to read
the file that is executing and they are telling me that i need to tell
them what configs to change in order for them to fix the problem.... 
I dunno what kind of web host will change anything a client says, nor
one that doesnt know how to setup thier own machines.

If anyone here knows of a good linux host that they have used or
currently use and CAN connect to a remote MSSQL database, please reply
to this.

We need a new host!!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP 5 Menu Objects
Message-ID: <8d9a428005020817275575a397@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I have been working with PHP 5 for a while now and i have attempted to
create a Menu Object that i will extend at a later time to have one
object load and hold all of my site menu's throught a session.

The problem i am having is this

$et->Menu()->Group( "Group1" )
$g1index = $et->Menu()-GetIndex( "Group1" );

$et->Menu()->Group( $g1index )->Item( )->Title( "Item1" );
$i1index = $et->Menu()->Group( $g1index )->GetIndex( $i1index );

/* this should go through and set the link
   for the correct item.
*/
$et->Menu()->Group( $g1index )->Item()->Title( $i1index )->Link( "page.php" );

$et->Menu()->Draw();

it is not drawing the menu, and i dont think the correct items are
getting set as they should be.

the code for the classes you will find below, the reason i am doing
this is so that i can eventually implement a user system and have the
menu's either dynamically generated from database content and also
hide or show certain menu's for different user levels.







class Menu {
	static private $_groups;
	
	public function __construct() {
		$this->_groups = array();
	}
	
	public function GetIndex( $title ) {
		foreach( self::$_groups as $key => $group ) {
			if( strtolower( $group->Title() ) == strtolower( $title ) ) {
				return $key;
			}	
		}
		return -1;
	}
	
	static public function Group( $index = 0 ) {
	
		if( ( $index == 0 ) && ( count( self::$_groups ) != 0 ) ) $index =
count( self::$_groups );
		if( self::$_groups[$index] == null ) {
			self::$_groups[$index] = new MenuGroup();
		}
		return self::$_groups[$index];
	}
	
	public function Draw() {
		foreach( $this->_groups as $gkey => $group ) {
			echo $group->Title().'<br>';
			foreach( $group->_items as $ikey => $item ) {
				echo '&nbsp; &nbsp;'.$item->Title().'<br>';
			}
		}	
	}
}




class MenuGroup {
	static private $_items;
	private $_order;
	private $_title;
	
	public function __construct( ) {
		self::$_items = array();
	}
	
	public function Title( $var = "" ) {
		if( $var != "" ) {
			$this->_title = $var;
		}
		return $this->_title;
	}
	
	public function GetIndex( $title ) {
		foreach( self::$_items as $key => $item ) {
			if( strtolower( $item->Title() ) == strtolower( $title ) ) {
				return $key;
			}	
		}
		return -1;
	}
	
	static public function Item( $index = 0 ) {
	
		if( ( $index == 0 ) && ( count( self::$_items ) != 0 ) ) $index =
count( self::$_items );
		if( self::$_items[$index] == null ) {
			self::$_items[$index] = new MenuItem();
		}
		return self::$_items[$index];
	}
	
}




class MenuItem {
	private $_order;
	private $_title;
	private $_link;
	
	public function __construct( $order = 0 ) {
		$this->_order = $order;
	}
	
	public function Title( $var = "" ) {
		if( $var != "" ) {

Ok i am having some problems with this now.

I have tracked down where it is going wrong but i cannot see why it is doing so.

You will find all of my code at the bottom of this email.

$et->Menu()->Draw( $et->User()->Level() );

this will basically call the constructor for the Menu.class.php file.

the constructor will use a database connection to grab all menu
groups, and for each of the groups grab all the items for that group.

The issue i am having is that it seems to set the items and thier
properties, but when i retrieve them with the Draw method it shows
them as empty objects.

here is the results printed to the screen (from the Draw Method)

General
Files
Community
Control Panel

when i do a count( $items ) it returns 0 for some reason :(

General
0Files
0Community
0Control Panel
0

Here is my code.


class Menu {
	static private $_groups;

	public function __construct( $db ) {
		$this->_groups = array();
		$res = $db->Query( "SELECT id, title, req_level, display_order FROM
menu_groups" );
		// make sure there are some groups in the database
		if( $db->NumRows( $res ) > 0 ) {
			// loop through the groups and add them to the menu
			while( $group = $db->FetchArray( $res ) ) {
				// add the group and set the info
				$g = $this->Group( );
				$g->Title( $group['title'] );

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP 5 Throwing Exceptions in Constructors
Message-ID: <20050209200136.889A1A85F0@virtu.nyphp.org>


Hi all,

All PHP 5 code examples I've seen show try/catch pairs like this:

try {
	$obj = new MyClass;
	$obj->DoSomething();
} catch( Exception $e ) {
	echo $e->getMessage();
}

I am the only one in thinking that these examples are incorrect 99% of the time?  Based on other languages, like Java, exceptions should very very rarely be thrown from a class' constructor.  The simple reason, as in PHP 5, is that the object never gets created if an exception is thrown in the constructor.

Is there something particular to PHP 5 that I'm missing?  While it could be considered pedantic, PHP 5 code examples should be as:

$obj = new MyClass;

try {
	$obj->DoSomething();
} catch( Exception $e ) {
	echo $e->getMessage();
}


In fact, in PHP 5 I cannot find anyway to determine the "return" value of the new operator.  This leads me to believe that PHP 5's concept of proper OO is to always assume the object is created successfully, unless a catastrophic event happens, in which case an exception is thrown, and the object isn't created at all.  This of course makes sense, but then I'm confused as to why the code samples all seem a bit incorrect.

Interested in hearing thoughts on this...

PHP is not Java. :)

In PHP 5, the way to signal failure in a constructor is to throw an
exception. There is no other way to communicate errors. As "new" will
not return "false".

Exceptions do not have to occur due to catastrophic failures, such as
lack of memory. This can also occur due to bad input parameters. For
example, passing the wrong number of parameters, or if you try to
create a DOMElement with an illegal XML element name.

See pages 188-9 of "Upgrading to PHP 5" by, um, I forget. :)

Just playing around with FTP_CONNECT and would like to know how to carry 
the connection resource id across multiple pages. $conn_id = 
ftp_connect(.....)

I have tried $_POST and $_SESSIONS and setting them to $conn_id and also 
$$conn_id

$conn_id = something like Resource ID #7 does anyone know what this is 
or how to use it without reconnecting on every new page?

Unfortunately a resource id cannot be carried from page to page, you 
have to re-establish it each time.

Riiiight... but it does have the same behavior :)

But what if a class should still be instantiated, even if some of the arguments are incorrect, or subsequent parts fail for some reason?  True, this validation could be done outside of the constructor, even in a totally different class that the constructor instantiates itself, but this still would prevent the instantiation of the original class.

class Top
{
	protected $Child;

	public function __construct( $value ) {
		$this->Child = new Child($value);
	}
}

class Child
{
	public function __construct( $value ) {
		throw new Exception('Bad Value');
	}
}

try {
	$mytop = new Top($_POST);
} catch( Exception $e ) {
	echo 'You had an exception';
}


In the case above, it'd obviously be trivial to change, but with complex class relationships, and factory methods as my particular case involves, it gets cumbersome.  Thus, it seems that instantiation of a class that might have some parts of it not successfully work out, which could be totally acceptable, would cause the Top class to not be created at all, and force the $mytop = new Top($_POST); to be done outside the try/catch, with subsequent checks done inside a try/catch.

It has similar behavior, but is just different enough to slip you
up. For instance, there's no concept of Checked vs. Unchecked
exceptions in PHP.

This is a ZE2 limitation. The only way to signal failure from a
constructor is via an exception. Even extensions that never throw
exceptions throw them in the constructor.

If you're concerned a non-essential portion can fail, you can either:

a) Don't throw an exception in that instance, return the object, and
provide developers with a way to check status.

b) Don't place that functionality in the constructor, and provide a
method to update the object with the additional data.

Message-ID: <20050210000152.GA2880@leitz>

I'm looking at doing some side work setting up CMS and shopping carts for small businesses. The web-host I use has a few offerings that are php based and I'm looking at the requirements and set up to see which one I'd want to support.

OScommerce requires register globals to be on, and Zen Cart requires some world-writeable directories in the DocumentRoot. THe other possibilites are AgoraCart, Interchange Cart, and CubeCart. 

I'm reading Chris' security workbook and trying to critically review anything that deals with money. My biggest fear is that one of my customers has a compromise and the public image of the business goes so bad that they lose their business. 

Yeah, I'm generally a "worst case scenario" sort of guy...

How do you protect yourself against liability, and more importantly how do you give the customer the security they deserve?

We started a project with OSCommerce and found it to be a hairball of
code/presentation and security issues.  It was really a pain to extend
without bastardizing core code.

We ended up scrapping it and using IC (interchange).  The documentation
is bad (they really need a wiki-doc-project), and we re-wrote most of
the templates (they were filled with "legacy" HTML coding -- i.e tables
within tables, inline styling, etc,).  

But after you get going on IC, it is a quite stable, secure and very
extensible platform.  My favorite part is IC uses a daemon process to
handle all the heavy lifting, while completely detaching critical
procedures from the client.  The "catalog" (or store-related files) are
completely separate from core and you can also override any core
functions with your own without breaking core stuff.  This all points to
a solid framework.

You can protect yourself and clients with a software license.  You are
protected by the IP portion and your clients by the warranty section. 
Here you can mitigate your clients risk by taking some or all of it on,
even offer your clients full indemnification, all for a charge.  Or, as
the other extreme, us "AS IS" verbiage.  You can also sell warranties
for many OSS (but refer to the specific license for the project).

The OSRM group also offers insurance for open source stuff.
http://www.osriskmanagement.com/

Redhat and HP offer indemnification protection for their Linux-based
products.

Dang, all good info! Two quick things.

THe host is a shared host, so I'd have to work with interchange in that sense. 

The liability issue is more "I recommended this application and it just got cracked with all your business data" sort of thing. Not indemnity for the code itself but for the vulnerability of the apps I set up for them.

ciao!

This is getting worse as I go.  Interchange doesn't work on CPanel, which the host uses. Agora cart looks real clunky and I need something that the customer can easily use to add to the cart. CubeCart is moving servers, is commercial, and I can't tell how it looks.

*sigh*  At least this *is* a market--most business owners I know wouldn't want to work through this hassle.  ;)

Hi Hans,

I was dealing with this exact same dilemma on a project I'm currently coding.
We ending up going with Adam's option B: move the code which can fail
to outside the constructor.

In the original design the you could create an object where the
constructor could read some information from a database.

In the final design, we moved the database code to a new load()
function that executes the actual database call. This does add an
additional step, but having the constructor throw an execution just
messes things up.

The simple reason, as in PHP 5, is that the object never gets created if an exception is thrown in the constructor.

This leads me to believe that PHP 5's concept of proper OO is to always assume the object is created successfully, unless a catastrophic event happens, in which case an exception is thrown, and the object isn't created at all.  This of course makes sense, but then I'm confused as to why the code samples all seem a bit incorrect.

This is a best practice in many OO languages (for instance c++)

Is it possible to gain some insulation in certain cases by using a 
specific exception subclass object type?

To clarify what I mean, I'm wondering if Hans can't add an additional 
catch like Example 20-3->example 1 below
and somehow only abort the instantiation if a critical exception is 
thrown

It up to you to choose if you want to abort the
instantiation. However, if you want to return an error in a
constructor, you need to throw some form of exception. It can either
be the base Exception class, or a subclass, but you can't do something
like returning false.

I've never looked at any of these things, but I've heard OScommerce
mentioned a few times recently. It's not obvious to me what this software
does by visiting their site. Is it just a content management and shopping
cart thing, or does it have more sophisticated support for payment
processing and such?

There seem to be all of these common problem spaces where someone needs to
write a solution that doesn't suck. I'm wondering if this is yet another
one.

> I'm reading Chris' security workbook

:-)

You might be interested to know that this has been renamed to the PHP
Security Guide and is now a project of the PHP Security Consortium:

http://phpsec.org/projects/guide/

It should be enhanced and translated as time passes.

> How do you protect yourself against liability, and more

I've been asking these same questions recently. It sounds like having a
separate business entity protects you personally, and having a signed
contract can protect your business. I haven't spoken with a lawyer yet, so
take this with a grain of IANAL salt.

As for security, I truly think that giving a damn is the most important
step, so you're already on the right track. :-) Learn as much as you can
(I've tried to do my best to provide lots of free resources over the past
few years, and many are available at http://phpsec.org/), and focus on
filtering input and escaping output.

If you're security needs are very demanding, you can have someone perform
a security audit of the code.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Looks to be. I'm an SA by trade and have worked in secure/paranoid backgrounds before. My gut feeling is that the authors of this sort of thing accept that credit card systems are going to be hacked and they just hope people are too embarassed about it to reveal it.

Yeah, something led me to the PHPSec site and that's actually where I found it. PHPSec could probably make a bundle of money by offereing code-review and "certification" of the code; "This product has met the standards set forth by the PHP Security Consortium".

The Small Business Info center I'm learning from says commercial insurance carriers often have "Small business packages". It may well depend on the insurer's understanding of the computer industry, so something to research. At the moment I'm totally secure as I don't have a product to sell!  ;)

Is there enough filtering that can happen to over-come the problems with register_globals? I'm only about a third of the way through the work-book.

Yup, and thanks for posting the Security guide on-line. *I* certainly am putting it to use.

"Factory methods are sometimes a more flexible way to instantiate 
a class than directly calling the constructor of the class, for 
the following reasons:

Unlike constructors, factory methods are not required to create a 
new object each time they are invoked...
 
from 'The Factory Design Pattern' by  Amit Goel
http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/08/11/factorypattern.html 

In the article Amit goes on to point out that objects returned by a
factory 
"need not even exist at the time the factory method is written."

(the article draws on examples from the .NET Framework Class Library 
to explain the potential advantage of using a factory pattern)

That's good - this is a "worst case scenario" sort of business...

>From the above and subsequent posts, it sounds like you are on a shared host.  Frankly, if you're really concerned about security and storing sensitive data (like CC numbers) get your own box.  All the code review and careful planning is pointless when some other idiot on your server is running phpNuke 1.0 from 1997.

Get a lawyer - get a dedicated box (or even a jail).  Doing the latter will require less of the former :)

Yes it is! ;-)

I built a prototype site with OSC and found it to be a real hairball.

And the last time I used Interchange it required Postgres and used a lot 
of Perl.

Right now, Mambo with the phpshop component is the only decent thing Ive 
found.

(Xaraya is an excellent framework too but alas they have no ecommerce 
components yet...).

Completely true about dedicated server, but if you do your own box then 
you can't share liability with the host, right? You are responsible for 
making that box secure, in addition to your app.

Isn't it more fun to spread the liability across a number of deep 
pockets, distributing the risk and making a case for common practice etc?

Scenario: If you were an underwriter considering offering errors and 
ommissions insurance or a business owner package for this application 
developer, which would be more risky?

1. He's following industry norms and leased a server from the hosting 
provider ATT, which offers levels of ecommerce features and allows him 
to pick and choose pieces, or

2. He's using a dedicated server he bought from vendor X, running 
hardened *BSD or XXES, acting as sysadmin, and  has even demonstrated 
he's an excellent high-security sysadmin?

After you get past the punchline (he's an insurance guy, so he doesn't 
know anything about computers) you go with #1 because of the access to 
deep pockets (ATT). You are offering insurance against ERRORS and 
MISTAKES so it doesn't matter if he's an expert... everybody makes mistakes.

Ajai,

I agree osCommerce is a pain to alter.  I have made so many changes 
that I think it would have been easier to just re-write it.  But then 
all the modules would not work. Interchange looks good but my perl 
skills stinks.

How are the features of Mambo w/ phpshop when compared to osCommerce?

osCommerce features needed:
Top selling items, newsletters, categories and a few other.

New features needed:
Manufacturer Mini Stores (just pages listing manufacturer's products 
with a different template), backend security with Groups and tons of 
other stuff my boss will come up with midway through this project.

Thanks,
John Nunez

The main thing with the mambo-phpshop plugin is that it gives you a 
pretty impressive pre-built backend for managing products, categories, 
vendors, shippers, payment methods, inventory, orders, etc. Since it use 
PHP and MySQL, the setup is pretty simple (in most cases this is a 10 
minute install). In addition to the phpshop plugins, there are added 
separate components that give you things like featured products or 
top-sellers, etc.

As far as customization goes, there are two facets to this: you need to 
build a custom Mambo site template (or several if you like) for the 
overall site, then you will need to customize the various product 
detail, checkout, etc. pages that the shop component uses when loading 
shop pages.

Im still working on a site that uses this stuff so Im no expert and Im 
still learning stuff myself (but having worked through OSC and IC, I am 
already finding it much easier to build this than either of those). I 
usually refer people to www.buyinnovation.com as a reasonable example of 
a mambo-phpshop site. Ill probably publicize the site Im working on when 
its finished.

Addressing a few of these points:

I believe the mini stores can be handled by the vendor features in 
mambo-phpshop but Ive not had the need to use it yet. (In addition, the 
privileges system allow mini-store owners to manage their own products 
separately from other store owners).

The backend has various privilege levels that you assign to users you 
create - I dont know if these are fine-grained enough for what you're 
asking.

The features list is here: 
http://mambo-phpshop.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=69&Itemid=62 
but the best thing to do is to install and spend an hour playing with it.

OsCommece, although very buggy  and budensome to it's databases is still the

is even and average PHPer he can make OsCommerce beautiful, and functional.
With thousands of developers paticipating and hundreds and hundreds of

it a good honest try.

Thanks Aj!

The roles would be more on lines of Product Manager (Add and remove  
products), Shipper, Accounting Personel, Admin.

Another feature... Logging! We need to know who logged in to the  
backend and changed stuff.

I am going to install Mambo on my gentoo box and see what I can do over  
the weekend.

Perhaps it has been upgraded since my last bout with OSC, but based on
my experience, I tend to disagree.  All the logic is mixed into the
presentation.  So, for example, if you want to change a UI element you
risk breaking core code.  This seems inflexible to me.

If OSC used a template engine or template design pattern, it would be a
big step in the right direction. 

I spent a few months last summer (2004) trying to use OSC, so this is my
direct experience.  But new releases may  have cleaned up "under the
hood" stuff...

Hi Edward,

I have been working with osCommerce for two years now and it has a huge 
array of modules but I when it comes down to configuration of the 
visuals it really lacks! I heard rumors of a re-write to use Smarty 
templates and make the entire system OOP but I have been pulling copies 
and nothing major has been done. When the re-write is complete every 
module will need to be re-written for it. So I think I will invest some 
time in Mambo since I also want to create an online magazine with 
article approval system.

Thanks,
John

possibilities are.

It sure is, and this is even more doable with a dedicated host than with shared.  Simple reason:  hosting providers tend to give better SLAs when you pay them more money.  Dedicated hosting with Verio, for instance, would give you more security and monitoring than you could do yourself, let alone some mom+pop shared hosting.

Dedicated hosting isn't necessarily collocation; it's often their hardware, and their job to maintain the box.

But this brings another good point.  Even if you do need/want to go with shared hosting for sensitive information, pick a big name provider - with big pockets and their own team of lawyers.

While this isn't always true, chances are the big names have more security, monitoring, and experience than the smaller companies.  This is by no means against the small hosting firms, but sometimes size does matter.

There are blue chips of hosting, and just like no one ever got fired for buying IBM, not many have gotten fired for buying Rackspace, Verio, etc.

If you want to build a pure magazine site, then you may be interested in 
something Ive been playing with (in between Mambo that is!) which seems 
to be excellent for this kind of thing: Xaraya (xaraya.com).

Unfortunately, Xaraya doesn't have ecommerce features yet so Im not 
using it for that. But I built a mini intranet with it and found it 
really easy to customize (in some ways, easier than Mambo). It separates 
presentation and logic and uses XML tags.

But it is generic enough to build any sort of content site (blog, help 
pages, wiki, whatever). The admin tools include the ability to create 
your own document types without writing any code. Also, instead of 
having specialized modules for a feature, it has something called hooks 
that allow you to use one module's functions in another. For example, if 
you had a recipe site and wanted to allow visitors to comment on a 
recipe, you could hook the comments module to that publication type. (Im 
probably not doing a good job of explaining this concept but it 
basically means you dont need to write a new module that combines the 
functionality others).

Ive been playing with too many content systems trying to find an ideal, 
but, you know what they say about the right tool for the right job...

I'd like to add that regardless of where you host, or what software
you use, or what services you provide or what you charge - if you
develop software for money, then you absolutely need liability
insurance.

Trust me on this one... Someday you might find yourself 'collateral
damage' as the result of some bigger firms being more dangerous and
resistant to legal attack, so the little guy gets crushed between the
clashing titans.

If you write code for people and accept money for it, you MUST get
liability insurance.

-- Mitch, and I am NOT an insurance salesman ;-)

My feelings exactly. I'm finding Mambo and phpshopcart to be a royal PITA to get
installed.  Well, I can't even get phpshopcart installed since I'm
getting fatal errors from the Mambo (PEAR?) libraries.

Now, it turns out that most of these shopping carts are overkill for
what I need.  All I need to do, ecommerce-wise, is to track the items
the end-user wants, gather up their pertinent info at checkout time,
encrypt it all and email it to my client.  No credit-cards or Paypal.  
No online registration. 

Anyone know of a CMS/shopping cart that *isn't* all tricked out?

Yeah, but some generic exception thrown from a class two or three 
levels away shouldn't be a concern of a developer who may not even be 
aware of the inner workings of that class.
Back at the example below,  I do believe  something like the Java 
compiler would complain about  new Child in the Top class because the 
child constructor can throw a bad value exception, therefore it must be 
caught.
That would make the subsequent user of the Top class shielded , no? 
That is, the exception would be caught before it got into the arms of 
the try/catch below.
But with no enforcement, I guess it's kinda hairy.
Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm learning this, not arguing it.

class Top
{
	protected $Child;

	public function __construct( $value ) {
		$this->Child = new Child($value);
	}
}

class Child
{
	public function __construct( $value ) {
		throw new Exception('Bad Value');
	}
}

try {
	$mytop = new Top($_POST);
} catch( Exception $e ) {
	echo 'You had an exception';
}

Nope, no PEAR libraries in Mambo, still waiting for a chance to put
ADOdb in there. Can you send the errors that you are getting? With
more detail I'm certain I can help.

Mambo and phpShop is actually the easiest way for anyone to get
started, so we probably just have a config or permissions problem.

Sounds like you don't need a shopping cart as much as you need a
filebase, or some sort of file distribution tool. Mambo has several,
as do some of the other CMS' available. Maybe a shopping cart isn't
the best approach?

Log in as Admin, select Componenets->Download mambo-phpShop (the first
one (I have two)), and select "Downloand Component".  It  d/les from
mamboforge.net and the errors are:

That's what I thought. I've checked the permissions and they're 755.

Possibly not, but I've not come across a better solution.   Dp you have
any links handy?

That doesn't mean Mambo uses PEAR though, that is just PHP showing you
your include path saying that it cannot find the files it is looking
for - and /usr/share/pear is in your include path (common for PHP).

You must be using some 3rd party goodies for all of this, as Mambo
does not download packages. I'd suggest downloading the phpShop
component from here:

http://mamboforge.net/frs/?group_id=38&release_id=2916

And skip the remote installer for now (sounds like it still needs some
work). You can install the component using the standard installer in
the admin -> Components -> Install...

If you just install the component, you will have no problems. Just
make sure you clear out any prevous broken installations of phpShop
before you install the component this time.

Interestingly, a fellow LUG member down here works for an ISP and
they'll give local LUG members a $50/month/1U colocation deal. Speaking
of isolating the host makes this good timing. Now if I can just figure
out a way to make it pay but not be quite so "shared", it'd be neat.
Especially since I can take all the PHP security stuff and set up a
decently secure server.  :)

ciao!

Mitch,

Can you point me to these "filebases" that you speak of?  The ones I see
look to be templates.  

Out of the box Mambo/phpshop looks to be overkill as well, so something
simpler would seem to be in order.

Also, the CSS don't work very well under Linux/Firefox; MS/Firedox and
MS/IE look okay.  I assume I'll need to redo the CSSes?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP segmentation fault with custom-compiled binaries -
	Zen Cart
Message-ID: <420D2CF9.9060102@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I have been having quite an 'interesting' time with some Zen Cart 
issues. The customer had Zen Cart installed on his shared host, Dreamhost.
The only payment module he had set up was PayPal. On step 3 of the 
checkout process, the cart would fail to post to PayPal, because it did 
not draw the required PayPal HTML form. Instead, it simply posted to his 
own site. (For a detailed description of the initial problem, please see 
my post here:
 http://www.zen-cart.com/modules/ipb/index.php?showtopic=16869&st=0&#entry96673 
)

Anyway, "Kim" from this forum with some 10,000 posts to her name, 
suggested that the reason it was failing was because the "Zend 
Optimizer" was not installed along with Dreamhost's PHP 4.3.10 binary. 
This seemed wrong to me, because Zend Optmizer only deals with 
'interpreting' compiled / encoded PHP code, and none of Zen Cart's code 
is compiled.

I installed Zen Cart on my local Windows, PHP 5, Apache 2, MySQL 
machine, and it ran fine. So, we thought that perhaps doing a custom 
compile of PHP 5 on Dreamhost (  for more info. please see: 
http://www.moztips.com/php5_install/ ) as a CGI binary, and registering 
that binary through a .htaccess file for .php files would make the 
program work, because there seemed to be some conflict between the 
current PHP version and Zen Cart.

The binary compiled file, the phpinfo() test script ( 
http://www.permanentimpressions1.com/phpinfo.php5 ) and other test 
scripts worked fine. But then, when encountering the main "index.php" 
page for Zen Cart (which serves as the main page controller / director 
to all its inner modules), produced an "internal server error". I custom 
compiled PHP 4.3.10 too, the phpinfo ( 
http://www.permanentimpressions1.com/phpinfo.php4 ) and test script 
worked fine too, but I got the same error with Zen Cart.

Apache's error logs said the following:
[Fri Feb 11 12:53:58 2005] [error] [client 209.194.148.130] Premature 
end of script headers: /home/*username*/*domain*/cgi-bin/php4.cgi

I then decided to run the script in question through the command line to 
see what was happening:

cd /home/*username*/php/bin
./php /home/*username*/domainname.com/index.php

Then I got:
Segmentation fault

(The same thing happened with the PHP 4 compiled binary)

But with Dreamhost's PHP binary, it worked (And all the HTML spewed forth)
# It looks up php from the system path and runs it
php /home/*username*/domainname.com.com/index.php

Does anyone know:
a) Why Zen Cart failed to go past Step 3 in the first place?
b) Why the PHP interpreters are seg faulting on this index.php script? 
(It must be one heck of script!)

Thanks a billion in advance for any help.

- Jay

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PEAR Prepare and Oracle to_date
Message-ID: <00b101c51088$8406c500$6501a8c0@Libby>

Hi - I'm having issues with getting a compiled query working with PEAR
using ->prepare when I have a DATE field in my Oracle 10g table. I have
gotten the 'prepare' to work on a table with fields other then type DATE
- so I know my 'connect', 'prepare' and 'execute' with the compiled
query works.

 

Any help would be much appreciated. I have tried numerous iterations of
using 'to_date' and the date mask. Below is my code that works without a
date field and it works fine

This is the oracle table it inserts into

CREATE TABLE CUSTMAST.TESTERIC (

  FNAME VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,

  LNAME VARCHAR2(25) NOT NULL,

  AGE NUMBER(5,0) NOT NULL

) tablespace "WADATA04";

 

 

<?php

require_once("c:/Inetpub/wwwroot/CustMast/includeav/classDefs.php");

define('DATE_END_FUTURE','9999-12-31 23:59:59');

define('DATE_MASK_ORA','yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss');

$dateEndFuture = "'".DATE_END_FUTURE."'";

$arrData = array('Eric', 'Gewirtz', 46);

 

$dbType = "oci8";

$db_UserName = "CUSTMAST";

$db_Password = "xxxxxx";

$db_HostName =
"(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=xxxxx.xxxxxx.co
m)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=ORCL)(SERVER=DEDICATED)))";

$dsn = "$dbType://$db_UserName:$db_Password@$db_HostName";

 

$db = DB::connect($dsn);

if (DB::isError($db)) die($db->getMessage());

 

$sql = "INSERT INTO TESTERIC (FNAME,LNAME,AGE) VALUES (?,?,?)";

echo "The prepare sql is below \n";

echo "$sql \n";

$compiled = $db->prepare($sql);

if (DB::isError($compiled)) {

            echo "PREPARE FAILED \n";

            die($db->getMessage());

}

echo "data string is \n";

var_dump($arrData);

$result = $db->execute($compiled, $arrData);

if (DB::isError($result)) {

            echo "EXECUTE FAILED \n";

            die($db->getMessage());

}

?>

 

This code does not work - it is using the Oracle to_date in the VALUES
parms

This is the oracle table it inserts in to

CREATE TABLE CUSTMAST.TESTERIC (

  FNAME VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,

  LNAME VARCHAR2(25) NOT NULL,

  AGE NUMBER(5,0) NOT NULL,

  BDATE DATE Not NULL

) tablespace "WADATA04";

 

<?php

require_once("c:/Inetpub/wwwroot/CustMast/includeav/classDefs.php");

You're using the wrong object to get the error message.  Second, use the 
getDebugInfo() method instead because it shows the native error message 
from the DBMS.

So, make that last line:

              die($result->getDebugInfo());

Now you should be able to figure out what's going on for yourself from the 
error message.

There are several projects available:

  * DocMan document manager (use software as documents)

  * Remository (file/software repository)
    http://mamboforge.net/projects/remository/

Those should get you started, or at least provide some inspiration ;-)

That is my thought as well, you will spend a tremendous amount of time
trying to turn phpShop into something it was not intended for.

That is just the template, and I assume you mean SolarFlare, the
default that ships with 4.5.1 series. It is a very beautiful template,
but also a very, VERY temperamental one. Check out the following site
for a demo of hundreds of templates:

  http://demo.mambohut.com

Find anything you like? Probably will find the template for download at:

  http://www.mamboportal.com/

Didn't like a single one? Then take the tutorial and do it yourself,
you will be amazed at how easily you can create a tempate for Mambo
(there is even a DreamWeaver extension for the html-source-impaired):

  http://www.mambosolutions.com/dw_tutorial/

That might give you a better experience trying Mambo. BTW, we are
getting ready to announce a new family of sites to bring all this
information together, hoping to speed up both adoption and the
learning curve (yes, I will personally make sure API documentation is
very visible!).

I'm working on a one-script project (pretty basic: takes some _GET

Is it possible to compile it into a standalone cgi executable so that
I can run it on another Linux system that may not have PHP installed?

Thanks Daniel,

I will attempt to be more concise in the future. Your suggestion was
helpful, at least now I know what Oracle is complaining about.
Unfortunately, the error message is not useful because my date is in
range even though Oracle is saying it is out of range.

Below is the output of my code. I did a var_dump of the data array that
I am passing to ->execute, my date looks good and the format of the
compiled sql insert does not have a syntax error.

data string is 
array(4) {
  [0]=>
  string(4) "Eric"
  [1]=>
  string(7) "Gewirtz"
  [2]=>
  int(46)
  [3]=>
  string(21) "'2010-12-31 23:59:59'"
}
EXECUTE FAILED 
INSERT INTO TESTERIC (FNAME,LNAME,AGE,BDATE) VALUES

Any help would be appreciated - thanks

I found the solution. Daniel thanks again for pointing me to the
getDebugInfo().

I did some hunting on the web for the ora-01841 error message I was
getting and found the following information;

Jon, it looks like you are wanting to use to_date with two parameters
but you are only giving it one bind variable (which,taken together, will
be something Oracle won't know to convert into a date). Oracle is trying
to take your single bind variable interpret it as a date using the
default date format for your Oracle session (which is probably
YYYY-MM-DD already). Give two bind variables a try, and it should work. 
-- Michael A. Cleverly, March 21, 2001

This was exactly what I was doing - I was only giving to_date one
parameter and hard coding the date mask - now my insert sql to be
compiled by the prepare looks like this (THIS IS CORRECT):

"INSERT INTO TESTERIC (FNAME,LNAME,AGE,BDATE) VALUES
(?,?,?,to_date(?,?))"; 
vs
THIS IS WRONG
"INSERT INTO TESTERIC (FNAME,LNAME,AGE,BDATE) VALUES
(?,?,?,to_date(?,'".DATE_MASK_ORA."'))";

Hello all,

Regarding my previous post - here is a backtrace produced by the gdb 
debugger when PHP (5) crashes. This was produced by a debug build, with 
the same configuration.
I also forgot to mention in my previous post that this error includes 
when index.php (of Zen Cart) includes the file 
'includes/application_top.php'.

Does it seem to be a problem with MySQL ?

Seems like it might be.  From looking at the ./configure you used at http://www.moztips.com/php5_install/ you didn't specify any mysql options.  Depending on the version of MySQL being used, try adding:

--with-mysql=/usr

or

--with-mysqli=/usr/bin/mysql_config

Hi Hans,

I did change the page moztips.com/php5_install from what I originally 
did, since it also serves as a guide for other people. Originally, I 
tried compiling PHP 5 by linking it against the system MySQL libraries - 
by using --with-mysql=/usr. But for some reason, that was not working. 
The configure script would produce an error when I tried that. I 
downloaded PHP 4.3.10, and could build it using its built-in MySQL 
client libraries. But PHP 5 does not come with MySQL client libraries.

So I downloaded the MySQL source and compiled just the client libraries 
( --without-server ) locally. Then I tried compiling PHP 5 against those 
libraries. This got past configure, make and make install. But when any 
PHP script encountered a mysql_fetch_row function (or something 
similar), the PHP binary segfaulted. I boiled it down to a testcase, and 
reproduced this.

So my last hope (I think), is to build PHP 5 against a MySQL shared 
object library ( libmysqlclient.so ). But when I tried doing this on 
Dreamhost (Debian Stable, shared hosting), it would not output the 
shared object files, even after 'make install'. I tried doing the same 
thing on my SuSe box (dedicated server, root access) and it worked fine.

So my question is: can I build a MySQL shared object library on one 
system, then copy that to Dreamhost, and then build PHP 5 against this 
shared object using something like:
--with-mysql=shared,/home/myusername/shared_so
?

Do I need to build the shared object on a Debian system if it is going 
to be copied to a Debian system ? Do shared object work just like dlls 
on Windows - i.e. they can be copied from system to system and just 
"swapped in"?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Best Regards,

- Jay

You would need to build the libraries on a machine 
with exactly the same dependencies. The various executables 
and intermediary libs often depend on version specific shared libraries 
and sometimes in very intricate ways -- so you are more than 
likely going to mess up somewhere if you try copying things around.

A package manager can keep track of all those dependencies for you.

Assuming you can use apt-get (or some other package manager).
which will take care of the dependencies, you should use that   
to install MySQL and then rebuild against that installation.

Does anyone know something about "internet broadcasting systems"
is there a similar PHP program like 'http://www.live365.com'.
Thanks

Message-ID: <4210C602.6030905@ceruleansky.com>

Hi Tim,

thanks for the link. It will be useful to keep on file. However, the 
customer in question is using a shared account on Dreamhost, so he will 
not be able to un apt-get.
But I think we have identified other issues in the code (of Zen Cart) 
that are causing the problems. So it is not a conflict with the PHP 
version that Dreamhost has, which we originally suspected.
So, for now, we can use their system-wide PHP CGI binary instead.

If one were to want to compile PHP 5 on Dreamhost, one could do so, 
except (I think) without MySQL support. There would be a way around it - 
place all PHP 5 scripts in a separate subdirectory ( 
www.mysite.com/php5docs/ ) and instruct Apache via a .htaccess file to 
parse .php files in that directory using the compiled PHP 5 binary. 
Then, modify the data object layer of the PHP 5 scripts to use a 
webservice (XML-RPC) to access the MySQL database via a script in 
www.mysite.com/mysql_xmlrpc.php. In other words, one could let the PHP 5 
binary select, insert, update and delete data in a MySQL database by 
posting to a PHP 4 script one directory "above" it. If it is a well 
architected app, just the data object layer would have to be changed. 
But sadly, most open source apps do not have this strict three tier 
(data object, business object, presentation layer) separation. It would 
be an interesting exercise though, to modify one PHP 5 cart that I know 
of ( the one in the excellent new book from Apress on PHP 5 and 
E-Commerce - http://apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=356 ) so that 
it can run on a shared server (such as  Dreamhost) with a PHP 5 binary 
and without built-in MySQL support. Oh - this cart in question is a 
PHP5-only cart, but it is exceptionally well architected (perhaps a bit 
over-architected, but nevertheless good).

Many businesses however are already set up with Zen Cart, which seems to 
be an incredibly complex and temperamental piece of software. It does a 
lot, and from an end-user perspective (shopper and store owner) it does 
look appealing. But it has these gotchas: mess with some settings 
(stored in the DB), and then it bombs out before the payment step. And 
many of the (good-intentioned) people helping in the forums are 
non-programmers, so you cannot post a piece of code and expect them to 
have an opinion on it ...

Anyway, I am rambling here ... thanks to you all for your help so far.

Best regards,

- Jay Sheth

If you have a test case, it might be a bug.  However, it might also be that you didn't compile against the libs you thought you did.

I would shy away from this.  Moving binaries and libs around is often asking for trouble.

Your hosting provider should have the proper MySQL libs installed for the database you're connecting to, and you should be able to compile PHP against them.  Also check out the version of MySQL they have; they might have an old one, etc.

Okay, I'm missing something here. How do either of these help me keep
track of items and money, allow the end-user to fill out a form, and
email it all to myself?  Don't get me wrong, I like the DocMan one and I
think I've got another client who can use it, but I don't see how these
are going to letme build my mini-shopping-cart.

I rather like the new box_business_new.  I'm thinking of redoing my site
with it and Mambo.

Huh?  Then I must have been looking at the wrong docs
(http://docs.mamboserver.com/HomePage) because a quick
glance didn't make it look "easy".

And the other thing I'm looking for is a tutorial on how to build a site
with Mambo; the interactions between the different menu items.  The stuff 
at http://docs.mamboserver.com/HomePage is as helpful as KDE's help,
i.e. not very.

Good.  Can I have it yesterday? :-)

Re: 32 bit or 64 bit - it think it's 32 bit, but I will confirm with the 
host.

The ./configure script fails with this error:

configure: error: mysql configure failed. Please check config.log for 
more information.

The complete ./configure directive was:

./configure --prefix=/home/singerm/php5_debug

I have posted the entire config.log here:

Maybe that log will have clues in it regarding this problem.

If you can make it through the week, I am presenting Mambo at NYPHP.
Make sure to be there, and machine-gun me with template questions and
such.

That will be the point of the presentation, showing and exploring
Mambo as both a tool and as an application platform. :-)

I'm in Boston this week for LinuxWorld, and encourage anyone to stop
by booth #22. I'll be pretty much offline as a result - hance the
offer to help in person next week ;-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Static Method Referencing
Message-ID: <20050214175039.EA78CA863E@virtu.nyphp.org>


Given this test case:

<?php
class MyClass
{
   private $StaticMethod = 'SayHello';

   static public function SayHello( $name ) {

      echo "\n\nSay Hello, $name!\n\n";
   }

   public function HelloWorks() {

      $tmp = $this->StaticMethod;

   public function HelloNoWorks() {

      MyClass::$this->StaticMethod('NoWorks');
   }
}


$myobj = new MyClass;
$myobj->HelloWorks();
$myobj->HelloNoWorks();


?>

Results in this:


Say Hello, Works!

PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method MyClass::StaticMethod() in /home/praxis/test.psh on line 22


Line 22 is:

      MyClass::$this->StaticMethod('NoWorks');


If I change line 22 to:

      MyClass::{$this->StaticMethod}('NoWorks');


Then I get a parse error:

PHP Parse error:  parse error, unexpected '{', expecting T_STRING or T_VARIABLE or '$' in /home/praxis/test.psh on line 22

I this expected behavior or a bug?  Do I have to set the method's name to a $tmp variable before using it as a reference to a static method?  Is there some other way to do it that I'm forgetting?

Yeah, I in fact have an Init() method just for these reasons.

The issue really wasn't even about a constructor.  It boiled down to the fact that throwing an exception is just too "strong" for what I wanted to do, ie, let the object be created regardless.

Even after moving the throw out of __construct(), if __construct() called some other object or method that threw an exception, it was killed.  Sure, I could have added a bunch of try/catch pairs, but I started to feel I was removing encapsulation.  I ended up having these potential problem areas simply set properties, which can then be accessed later.

I guess the takeaway here is that if you have simple base classes that can succeed to different degrees or not, it's better to not have them throw exceptions unless you want to ensure a major change in program flow (thus, an exception :)

Sure does, check the bottom of the log.  It's not finding the SSL libs, and seems that MySQL is compiled against SSL.  Talk to them about building against their MySQL client libs and have them check that they are working ok.

I doubt it's programmed in PHP, but Icecast (http://www.icecast.org/) is 
the popular OSS streaming server. I kind of doubt you'd want to program 
audio streaming in PHP--but you could set up a PHP-based site to 
organize your teaching materials, and then deliver them with Icecast.

Maybe you should publish a FAQ, Adam.

I don't have the book, but from the code snippet above, that's not it anyway.  StaticMethod is a property, containing the name of a static method to call.

Maybe my choice of naming the property was confusing, so here is another:


class MyClass
{
   private $StaticMethodName = 'SayHello';

   static public function SayHello( $name ) {

      echo "\n\nSay Hello, $name!\n\n";
   }

   public function HelloWorks() {

      // this dereferences the static method call, calling the SayHello() method
      $tmp = $this->StaticMethodName;
      MyClass::$tmp('Works');
   }

   public function HelloNoWorks() {

      // this does not
      MyClass::$this->StaticMethodName('NoWorks');

      // also does not work (parse error)
      // MyClass::{$this->StaticMethodName}('NoWorks');
   }
}


$myobj = new MyClass;
$myobj->HelloWorks();
$myobj->HelloNoWorks();


Perhaps this is just a limitation of the parser, but I don't see any reason it shouldn't work, so perhaps a bug.

Basically I'm seeing that's there's no way to dereference a property into a static method call, whereas a regular variable can be dereferenced in this respect.

For additional clarification of the underlying goal, a non-OOP example:

function my_func() {
   echo 'This is my_func';
}

$thefunc = 'my_func';
$thefunc();

Calls a function by the name of my_func()

Oh. Yea. You can't do that. It doesn't work. :)

I can't remember if I filed this as a bug, but it's come up before on
internals. I also can't remember if/when this will come to PHP 5.

Hi Hans,

I can't seem to find a way to do this by dereferencing, but yet
another way of doing it:

call_user_func(array('MyClass', $this->StaticMethod), 'NoWorks');

I believe you can also use the reflection classes, if you're into an
all OO solution.

You are the one that must be high to not see it... trying to eat your
cake and have it too. You're trying to be slick, sneak around the gate
and get away with something. The ultimate fact of the matter is that
you cannot access the contents of the $StaticMethod  property
("SayHello"), without instantiating the object. It does not matter
that you are then trying to do a perfectly legal operation with that
information, but that you do not have access to that information in
the first place.

Doh! That certainly is not an appropriate tone for a public list. Hans
& I were having a parallel conversation, and I inadvertently sent it
to the wrong address. That's what I get for hitting the reply button
before being sufficiently caffeinated.

This list is great because it is almost always free of that kind of
response, so common on almost every other list I've seen, and I
apologize for even the slightest implication that that sort of thing
is OK around here.

Heh. Been having a lot of fun, and definitely have a lot of news. Too
much for this post, but I want to quickly say that any of you that use
Mambo need to stand up and take a bow. There is absolutely no way we
could have walked away with the Best Overall award without such an
awesome, dynamic and demanding community.

GROUP HUG!   hehe

Just a quick note on this, and then off to bed for me!

You know what this means for PHP and LAMP? I had an exec from Intel
walk over and ask what all the fuss was about. I was interviewed, and
it wasn't by my Mom. I had a guy walk over and say "What is a Mambo?
One of the guys from Novell told me I needed to come over here and
talk to you."

This is cool for Mambo of course, but more importantly this validates
PHP and the LAMP platform as a force to be reckoned with. It sends a
message that companies are deploying LAMP applications for serious
purposes, not just brochureware sites. It means that there are
developers (and whole companies) that are making a living customizing
applications based on the LAMP platform.

We just sent a very loud and clear message to the business world:

* you can make money with this stuff
* you can run your business on this stuff
* you can trust and depend on this stuff

Congratulations to everyone, as this is a huge coup for the LAMP
community as a whole.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Problem with Quickform and email rules
Message-ID: <4214CFD9.7020308@magpie.com>

I've got an application that's got an email element I want to validate. 
  This is being done through the Array/Smarty interface, if this matters.

The element is created:

$form->addElement('text', 'email', 'Email',
   array('size' => 30, 'maxlength' => 100));

Then I registered and added a rule:

$form->registerRule('emailcheck', 'function', 'emailCheck');
$form->addRule('email', 'Enter a valid email address',
   'emailcheck', 'function');

emailCheck() is a custom function in the same file.

Problem is, this rule never gets called.  I even dumped a phpinfo() in 
the function so I wouldn't miss its invocation.


So I tried using QuickForm's built-in email rule:

$form->addRule('email', 'Enter a valid email address',
    'email', null, 'server');

This too doesn't work no matter what garbage I put in the email field.


However, the 'required' rule works on it:

$form->addRule('email', 'Please enter an <b>Email</b> address.',
   'required');

If the email field is set, .errors get set with the error message.


What am I missing here??

Welcome to the club. (-: I was already speculating that that might be your
problem after reading the first couple of sentences.

print_r($renderer->toArray()) is nice for seeing what's really there.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [OT] Apache Testing Server Config Problem /
	Mod_Rewrite?
Message-ID: <s214d37d.016@webmail.sussex.edu>

Hi All,

I'm upgrading all of my server software and need to test out before the upgrade. I'm using the ApacheFriends xampp for windoz package.

I whish to fully test out my current online site on the test server so I know all php, perl, mysql scripts and related webpages will work properly.

Problem: I have some includes and hard coded links in the site. This causes the browser to resolve to the online server rather than the test server when using the dropdown (javascript) menues etc..

I have been looking, trying to configure mod_rewrite all day to do this:

When you see mysite.com/bla/bla/bla.htm in the 
page (server is parsing all pages) change the mysite.com part to 127.0.0.1 so the browser will navigate properly down the directory tree. 

This is what I have in the htaccess file in the webroot folder:
RewriteEngine on 

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}   !^mysite\.com [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}   !^$
RewriteRule ^/(.*)         127\.0\.0\.1/$1 [L,R]

Can someone point me in the right direction or offer an outright rule/fix that will do this. I've been all over the mod-rewrite.com site and google and do not see any examples of what I'm trying to do.

Thank You,

Jessica

I think you're trying to get mod_rewrite to do something it doesn't.

Mod_rewrite only rewrites requests, not responses.

You want to run all of your responses through some kind of filter (a
PHP script perhaps) that will preg_replace() all of the mysite.com's
to 127.0.0.1's.

Do you have Dreamweaver? You could do a global search and replace on
the site to change them all, test it, then do another to change them
all back... Keep a backup of the originals!!!

You could temporarily add an entry to your hosts file that tells your 
machine that mysite.com is 127.0.0.1

On Windows XP the hosts file is:

C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

You will need to open it with your favorite text editor and add a line like:

127.0.0.1    mysite.com

Until you remove that line the system will think that mysite.com is your 
local machine.

Oooh, that's a much better solution than a filter. (slaps forehead.)

This is a great post :)  As Jeff mentioned after this, these types of posts are not acceptable, and in fact a perfect example of what not to do - but apparently Jeff thinks it ok to talk like that privately :)

Funnyish aside, the problem I was having was to use an object property to call a static class method.  There was no use of an object ($this) in the static part of the class.

Had one entry in the DB and the match function didn't work. I figured 
the database need more entries to actually create the index.
I created five more entries and the searches worked, but when I have a 
search term which is present in more than four rows, I seem to be 
getting an empty set.

I'm combing Google and mysql.com but don't see anything yet.

As I recall, MySQL will disregard words that appear in more than x% of
the rows as "noise".  

In my example, I put together a database of IT resumes.  Since
practically everyone had "Microsoft" and/or "Windows" in their resume,
a search on either would turn up nothing. I eventually went with a
straight text search (WHERE field like '%foobar%') IIRC.

There are a series of search word length, frequency, etc. constraints that can be applied.  Take a look at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/fulltext-fine-tuning.html

This is usually a webserver plugin (like mod_auth) that replaces your
standard authentication mechanisms.

What kind of information are you looking for?

I haven't worked with this in a while, but it usually involves
installing the apache module which communicates to a running daemon,
but then it feeds through the standard http authentication
mechanism. You'll have multiple options for setting up users and
access levels. Clients have to present the token (from the hardware
key) in addition to their local password. From within PHP, this should
look exactly like any other kind of standard SSL authentication - you
don't have to do anything except collect the username of the logged in
user.

You should download the trial and check it out. All of these
components should be included:

As some of you may know, I am a recent switcher.  I moved from a doz
notebook to a powerbook.  I would like recommendations for Flow Charting,
UML and Modeling software for OS X.

Sorta off topic but good stuff anyway, good work Mitch and the Mambo team!
 We use your software extensively and have had great luck with it.  We
have delivered several very succesful projects based on Mambo and will
continue to use it.  Our clients love you guys.

Poseidon for UML is a decent UML editor. I used it for a while for
some Java work. They have a free Community Edition which you can get
from http://www.gentleware.com/products/download.php4

Since it is java based, it should run fine on you powerbook.

Check your PowerBook for Omni products.  Mine came with OmniGraffle and 
OmniOutliner already installed I just found out.  Older versions, but a 
good way to check it out and use the upgrade price to get to the latest.

Message-ID: <728813C3358BF04CB3A3DA2341D44A71015E61DF@e2k11.na.baesystems.com>

Hey Gang,


A quick question.  I am supporting an organization that is currently using a web-based tool that includes pop-ups.

Obviously, this is causing issues with users who are using pop-up blockers.  And I'm one of the guys who has to talk users thru enabling pop-ups for this site (even though we didn't develop the tool).


Has anyone seen a white paper or a how-to presentation for enabling pop-ups on a browser by browser basis?  Preferably on how to enable pop-ups on a site-by-site basis.  I want to point folks towards something that will help them during this transition.

Thanks,

PJF

You could temporarily add an entry to your hosts file that tells your 
machine that mysite.com is 127.0.0.1

On Windows XP the hosts file is:

C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

You will need to open it with your favorite text editor and add a line like:

127.0.0.1    mysite.com

Until you remove that line the system will think that mysite.com is your 
local machine.

Hi Folks:
  
I think/hope/pray I've come up with the final release candidate for the 
XML_RPC package.  This is a widely used and vitally important utility, so 
I don't want anyone getting burned by upgrading to the stable version when 
it comes out.

If you use the PEAR XML_RPC package, PLEASE, get the latest version and   
test it out.
 
    via PEAR installer:
        pear upgrade XML_RPC-beta

    via a tar file:
        http://pear.php.net/get/XML_RPC-1.2.0RC7.tgz

For more info, see http://pear.php.net/package/XML_RPC.

Thanks very much,

Guten Tag,

(Dan used hola, so I thought I would try something different too.)

I just saw this, and I thought it was pretty cool:
http://www.php-compiler.net/

Here is some info. from their site. Very cool, in my opinion. Looks like 
it is only available for non-commercial use though ( 
http://www.php-compiler.net/License.htm).

Hope to see the regulars (and some new faces too) at the meeting tonight.

Hi.

As cool as this one is.. it only runs on MS clr. however there is a
more open version that runs on mono. it is written in C#. it can be
found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ironphp/. however it is too
much in alpha.. php-compiler.net seems much more complete.

Interesting stuff guys - seems like it'd be a good topic for a presentation.  Has anyone played with these at a somewhat in-depth level?  Even a comparison between the various options?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] newbie question/confusion
Message-ID: <319FD9EAB7A43E43895ACA5AA1F81E05F8897F@xmail.nybg.org>

This may be more of a MySQL question than a PHP question but here goes:

First, I will confess to the fact that I'm using PHAkt/AdoDB with Dreamweaver to help myself learn PHP... 
So, that is why the syntax is what it is. It's a place to start...  :-)


I have a small database with two tables in it.  It's a database of
Botanical Gardens in the US.

Table 1 contains the botanical gardens and has 8 fields:

(I'm abbreviating for brevity and clarity):  id, name, address, town,
state_id, zip, phone, url

Table 2 contains the states referred to in the 'state_id' field and
itself has 3 fields

id, abbreviation, name

So, 'id' in the 'state' table is linked to the 'gardens' table via
that table's 'state_id' field.

Now, in pulling data out of the database to display on a web page I
have all of my connection stuff working and the query of 'select *
from gardens' along with this php code:

 <td align="center"><?php echo $row_Recordset1['botgard_name']; ?></td>
   <td align="center"><?php echo $row_Recordset1['botgard_address']; ?></td>
   <td align="center"><?php echo $row_Recordset1['botgard_town']; ?></td>
   <td align="center"><?php echo $row_Recordset1['state_id']; ?></td>
   <td align="center"><?php echo $row_Recordset1['botgard_zip']; ?></td>
   <td align="center"><?php echo $row_Recordset1['botgard_phone']; ?></td>
   <td align="center"><?php echo $row_Recordset1['botgard_url']; ?></td>

works fine, pulling records out of the 'gardens' table and displaying
it on a web page, but, of course, I'm seeing the 'state_id' instead of
either the 'state_abbreviation' or the 'state_name'.

I am at a complete and total loss as to how to edit my code at this
point so that, before displaying anything, i can grab either
'state_abbr' or 'state_name' from the states table, properly
associated with the 'state_id' and display the actual state
abbreviation or state name in my web page.

I'm so close, yet so far.  I know if I can be shown once how this
works, I'll be able to apply the solution again in the future.

Thanks in advance for any help with this.

Sincerely,

Joshua

Are you asking "how do I do a JOIN on the tables"?

SELECT botgard_name, botgard_address,
yadayadayada, state_abbr
FROM gardens LEFT JOIN states 
ON gardens.state_id = states.state_id

(I think that's the syntx) or, to be safer, you might want to do

SELECT botgard_name, botgard_address,
yadayadayada, state_abbr
FROM gardens, states
WHERE gardens.state_id = states.state_id

(I know that syntax will work). There are subtle differences between the
two, but either should work in your circumstance.

You want to RTFM at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/join.html which
isn't too helpful, IMO, or try

I used the second syntax first... I'll test the first syntax tomorrow!

Now I just have to figure out how to write my insert statement for when people want to add gardens!

INSERT INTO gardens
(field1, field2, field3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3)


http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/insert.html or do what I do: google
for "mysql insert syntax".  First link.

Good job on "normalizing" your database.  Suggestion: use the same column 
names in each table for the key:  state_id.  It makes things easier to 
join and is clearer.

Faber was on target.

My MySQL tutorial, while mainly geared toward how to install MySQL on 
Windows, also includes SQL syntax tips:
http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/code/mybasic.htm

A later post mentioned your inquiry regarding inserting new gardens.  When 
accepting user input, make sure you carefully validate the information so 
it won't permit "SQL injection" attacks or other corruptions/errors.

Yeah, and you might be able to include bridging PHP to Java objects in 
this way http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223
And I'm wondering if  a PHP script has ever been compiled by a Java 
compiler.

Just to add a little more onto the pile of more-answer-than-you-asked-for:
it's probably wise to create some indexes on your tables to speed up
SELECT operations. The columns frequently appearing in your WHERE clauses
are good candidates.

There's http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/article.php/1382791
but I'm sure there's plenty of other fine reading material out there.

About that ... when you create a unique field on a table, does that
automatically make that an index as well?

So,

I can now create a page that reaches into the database, grabs all the records and then displays the first 10 records (or however many I want to set it to) and displays buttons for the next 10, etc...  

I also have a form so that people can add new records to the database.

going back to the issue of displaying records in the database, I want set up the ability to bring up a record-edit form by clicking on the name of the Botanical garden... any pointers?

You could add an "operation" argument to your list/view page:
<input type="hidden" name="op" id="form_op" value="(Edit | View | New |
etc.)">
 
Then next to each record, your EDIT button passes the record's ID and the
EDIT operation to your action page. When I see EDIT as the op, I redirect to
the Edit page or whatever means I've built to edit a record, (which happens
in a current case to be the same page as my list page).

So,

I can now create a page that reaches into the database, grabs all the
records and then displays the first 10 records (or however many I want to
set it to) and displays buttons for the next 10, etc... 

I also have a form so that people can add new records to the database.

going back to the issue of displaying records in the database, I want set up
the ability to bring up a record-edit form by clicking on the name of the
Botanical garden... any pointers?

Hi Joshua:

The list of gardens has the name of the garden as a hyperlink.  The link 
goes to the add/edit page and has the garden id as part of the query 
string:
  echo '<a href="edit.php?garden_id=' . $row['garden_id'] . '">'
       . $row['garden'] . "</a>\n";

Adding and editing items should be done via the same page/form.  Makes 
long term maintenance easier.

You could add an "operation" argument to your list/view page:
<input type="hidden" name="op" id="form_op" value="(Edit | View | New |
etc.)">
 
Then next to each record, your EDIT button passes the record's ID and the
EDIT operation to your action page. When I see EDIT as the op, I redirect to
the Edit page or whatever means I've built to edit a record, (which happens
in a current case to be the same page as my list page).

Joshua,

You can do something like the following:

"<a href=\"editpage.php?id={$rows['myID']}\">{$rows['NameofGarden']}</a>";

Of course...those are bogus names for the database columns...you'd use 
the real ones. I assume, also, that you're using something like 
mysql_fetch_assoc.

Silly but true story/word of caution:

If you add a "delete record" button, be sure your admin page is 
protected with a password and also add a robots.txt. A few years back, I 
had a unprotected admin page (security through obscurity, heh!). 
Googlebot found the page (linked from an automated daily web stats page) 
and proceeded to spider all the [delete] links ultimately wiping out all 
the records. Luckily I was able to restore from a nightly backup. It was 
quite embarrasing to be owned by a search engine.

Thanks!

fwiw, this little database is going to be behind our corporate firewall and only accessible to a few people... 

Basically, our retail department (the people who manage the shop) keep a Microsoft Word doc. list of all of the other Botanical Gardens in the US that have shops.. the idea being that we might be able to get those other shops to purchase items from us that we have manufactured for OUR shop.   When I saw this MS word doc. I figured it'd be a good, small project for me to start building LAMP apps.

Ha.  I had the same thing happen to me... luckily it was just a prototype 
application though. 

I had cleverly attached JavaScript confirm()'s to the delete links which 
was pretty good at making it a two step process of deletion for users, but 
Google just plowed on through.  :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Setting up PHP 4 OOP to work in PHP 5 environment
Message-ID: <421DD273.1010003@r2communications.com>

I have a nice little codebase that I have written in PHP 4 OOP. I am 
very leary that my host will someday switch to PHP 5, and although 
backwards compatability may be turned on (if it can be), I am still 
leary that my objects will fail upon instantiation.

I have three classes that I use on every page for the following 
functionality:

- connecting to the database (class_db.php)
- controlling the display of the page (class_display.php)
- validating user input (class_validator.php)

In all of my other classes, I use a constructor to instantiate the above 
classes so that I can use their methods and properties.

class Employer {
	
	//constructor
	function Employer(){
		$this->db =& new DB;
		$this->display =& new Display;
		$this->validator =& new Validator;
		$this->db=$this->db->conn;
		}

	//properties

	//methods

	}

I am really still new to the whole OOP thing, but I am learning. I 
definitely see the benefits of it, but I want to make sure that what I 
am describing above will not break in PHP 5. I have a second machine at 
home that I am going to install Apache and PHP 5 on this weekend, but I 
thought I would ask for some feedback first.

TIA.

In general PHP4 OOP is forwards compatible with PHP5. 5 will still
call your Emloyer() method as the constructor, for instance, even
though it prefers __construct().

Out of curiousity, why are you assigning by reference ( =& ) when
creating the new objects?
Is it because DB, Display, and Validator implement a singleton pattern?

i was under the impression that =& created a new instance of the object, 
and that was the proper way to do it.

> Is it because DB, Display, and Validator implement a singleton pattern?

unfortunately, i have no idea what 'singleton patter' means:)

i am merely a designer learning to move from procedural scripting to 
OOP. so all i know is that in order to access the properties and methods 
in the other classes, i had to use a constructor.

Message-ID: <6.1.0.6.2.20050224091615.04a17778@127.0.0.1>

Hello,

I'm drawing a blank on this...

I've got a table of "show" information and a table of month names.
When listing the shows, dates, prices, etc, I do something like the following:

SELECT shows.name, shows.id, month.month_name AS openmonth
FROM shows, months
WHERE shows.openmonth_fid = months.month_id

I get the opening month name fine.
Now I also want to get the closing month name.
But I know a query like the following won't work.

SELECT shows.name, shows.id, month.month_name AS openmonth, 
month.month_name AS closemonth
FROM shows, months
WHERE shows.openmonth_fid = months.month_id
AND shows.closemonth_fid = months.month_id

How would I go about doing something like the above?

I know I can create two separate months tables (one for opens, one for 
closes) but there's gotta be a better way, right?

Thanks!

Harvey

for clarity's sake, it sounds like your tables are like so...

SHOWS
------------

showName
showID

see if the following works. if it doesn't try 'left join' in place of 
inner join.

You need the following syntax:

SELECT s.name,s.id,m1.month_name AS open,m2.month_name AS close
FROM shows AS s
JOIN months AS m1 ON m1.month_id = s.openmonth_id
JOIN months AS m2 ON m2.month_id = s.closemonth_id

A singleton is a class which returns an instance of some object. If
the instance doesn't exist yet, the singleton creates it. Otherwise, a
reference to the existing instance is returned. It's good for things
like database connections that you only need one of.

But that's beside the point... you don't need the =&, you can just say:
  $instance = new className;

If you have a lot of classes that instantiate the same objects over
and over on construction, you might consider something like:

class Employer {
  function Employer() {
    global $DB;
    $this->db =& $DB;
  }
}

$DB = new DB;
$employer = new Employer;

The global command brings the previously created $DB object into the
local scope of the constructor. And you *would* use =& here so that
you create a reference (memory pointer) to the $DB object instead of a
copy of it.

ok. thanks for the explanation. fwiw, i am starting to read up on OOP, 
starting with adam's php 5 book.

you are exactly right. but i found that my approach....

...allowed me to only have these lines in my php page...

$employer = new Employer
$db=$employer->db;

as far as i knew, this just allowed me to put less code in my pages.

Thanks! That makes total sense. I didn't know you could put the AS on the 
JOIN...

Doing so in PHP 4 saves on memory.  For example, in PEAR DB, the connect 
method creates and then returns an object.  As I understand it, in PHP 4, 
if references are not used, the object returned will be a whole new 
copy of the object created inside the method.  But if you assign by 
reference, you get the object created inside the method.

the reason i asked is because there is someone in my office running php 
5, and we have noticed some strange 'notices.' but i have not had the 
time to look into it. i do intend to install it this weekend. i just 
wanted to throw it out there and make sure that what i already have 
wasn't a poor implementation. it sounds like i am ok, at least so far.

True, but you'll have four objects in memory per Employer object you create.
It's not really that big a deal, and maybe you need a separate Display
object for each Employer...

I'll bet they're E_STRICT notices about the need to use "public", 
"protected" or "private" instead of "var" to declare properties.  You can 
turn them off via error_reporting.

Thank you so much. I was quite impressed with the turnout, as well.
The one thing I didn't get to illustrate was how you (as a developer)
could base your applications on Mambo for rapid site/application
development. Maybe some other time ;-)

Actually I was thinking about that and started feeling the old heart rate
increase. Imagine you're a small-time part-timer like me whose specialty
is really programming rather than page design, but friends of friends etc
keeping wanting you to make a "web site," and you're like, oh man, I'm
really not a graphic artist or drop-dead sexy page designer... no wait. If
I can get Mambo-proficient, maybe contract out some graphic work to get
the pretty images.... Maybe you can do (almost) everything "yourself"
without being a complete rocket scientist/android who never sleeps.

Looks like we do need a presentation:  Mambo Part Two.

Hello everyone:

I've been searching for the solution to my problem. I do not want a form to be 
resubmitted when i refresh a page.
i use this in the <head> portion of the html page:

<META Http-Equiv="Cache-Control" Content="no-cache">
<META Http-Equiv="Pragma" Content="no-cache">
<META Http-Equiv="Expires" Content="0">

But i can't get this to work. Can anyone tell me if i need to use something in 
php as well in order for a refresh to be done without re-submitting a form.

Thank you.
Henry

mambosolutions.com has a template of the month club, and there are
hundreds of little Mambo template shops popping up out there, for a
very similar reason:  It is just as easy for the graphics people to
work with Mambo as it is the programmers.

Custom templates will run you $100-300, so it is typically a negligible cost :-D

That is not possible as far as I know.  To work around it, process the 
form in one script and then forward to another page once processing is 
done:

form.php
   <form action="process.php">

process.php
   <?php
   // validate and save info
   if (!$errors) {
      header('Location: http://host/thanks.php');
   }

thanks.php
   <h1>Thanks for your submission</h1>

One other solution is to embed a one-time token in each form you want to 
protect.  Below is a simplified example:

if (!isset($_SESSION['tokens'])) {
   $_SESSION['tokens'] = array();
}

if (isset($_POST['action'])) {
   if (array_key_exists($_POST['token'],$_SESSION['tokens'])) {
     // do something here

     // unset token so it can't be used again
     unset($_SESSION['tokens'][$_POST['token']]);
   } else {
     // form was submitted twice
   }
}

$token = md5(uniqid());

$_SESSION['tokens'][$token] = time();

<input type="hidden" name="token" value="<?php print 
htmlentities($token);?>" />

As you may have noticed the code above also stored the issue time for 
each token, so you can also prevent users submitting 'stale' forms.

There are also definite merits to using a system which redirects users 
to result pages after they submit a form, especially in terms of making 
the 'back' button work in an intuitive way.

I think you have it backwards.

"The directive CACHE-CONTROL:NO-CACHE indicates cached information should 
not be used and instead requests should be forwarded to the origin server."

But even if you fix that, I don't think it will solve your problem.

I think you can create a "process.php" page that takes the "form.php" data, 
processes it, and then returns to the form page. The form page should now 
be considered a "new" page and refreshing should not resubmit the old data.

Or you could have a hidden timestamp be submitted and compare posts, not 
processing if the questionable post is less than X seconds after the last post.

Well I am thinking about a miniMambo presentation that focuses solely
on developers and 3rd party types, who wish to use Mambo as the base
platform for all of their development.

Might be interested to see how much demand such a presentation would
have (hint, hint).

There are over 350 subscribed to the jobs list, but it's not very chatty (which is good).  We'd prefer to keep the jobs list for jobs, and this list for general discussion.

Even though I've given up on Mambo until some better docs come along (I
simply can't figure out the paradigm for this thing), I'd be very
interested in seeing this presentation as well.

This is probably one of the biggest hurdles to CMS adoption by
experienced developers -- when faced with a system as complex as Mambo
or Drupal or whatever, it seems like it will take months just to
figure out, big picture, how everything works together. It seems
easier to just start from scratch.

While any core developer could easily communicate the paradigm to
another programmer face to face, doing so in a written document is a
daunting task.

Does anyone know of a project (doesn't have to be PHP) that has done this well?

That is exactly why this Mambo mailing list was created. Signup and

Message-ID: <LOBBJOCDHNEMOHLKCPIOKELDCOAA.frank_wong2@informationideas.com>

Can someone shed some light on the following issue?

1: I have an object, A, that I create on a page.
2: Object A's constructor create an object, B and is stored in a variable in
object A.
3: I register object A as a session variable.
4: On my next page, I grab object A from the session and everything is fine.
5: I try to get object B from object A and it is not an object.

All objects definitions occur before session_start().

Is that the way object serialization supposed to work in PHP4?

If so, what is the best alternative to having an object within an object?

After further testing, objects inside an object are serialized without a
problem.  I made the mistake of reading someone's comment on php.net about
object serialization stating the problem I posted before and then looked for
evidence to prove his statement.  Stupid me.

An interesting read :)


"IBM backs open-source Web software"
http://www.nytimes.com/cnet/CNET_2100-7344_3-5589559.html?


Some snippets:

"IBM is putting its corporate heft behind a popular open-source Web 
development technology called PHP, in a move meant to reach out to a 
broader set of developers...

"The two companies [IBM and Zend] intend to devote programmers to make PHP 
work better with corporate databases and Web services protocols. IBM also 
plans to establish an area dedicated to PHP on its developer Web site, 
which will include technical resources such as white papers...

"Big Blue's public commitment to PHP is significant because the company 
has the technical and marketing resources to accelerate usage of the 
open-source product. IBM's investments in Linux and Java, for example, 
were crucial to mainstream corporation adoption of those technologies...

Could somebody help me on that one ?

I'm trying to retrieve a 300 char long text from a database and place it into a
textarea...
Here is the message I get from my browser :

-----------
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate
61 bytes) in
/home/r/e/user988508/html/primaire/pagesFr/personnel/infosFlashModify.php on
line 59

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate
138 bytes) in Unknown on line 0
-----------

If I display the same text (coming from the same database) as text on the page,
then there is no problem  !
What should I do to fix the problem ?

Thanks in advance

Umm, are you sure that your script isn't going into some kind of endless loop?

You say the text is about 300 chars, but is there other stuff in the
script that might push the size over 8MB?

Hello -

Has anybody had any experience using PHP/MySQL on a Windows machine 
running SBS?

So far I have only worked with PHP/MySQL running Apache on a *nix 
machine.  I am curious to get any advice to know if this is a good or 
bad idea.  And yes, this machine will be in a production environment.  
I've often heard the questions to the statement, "I want to run 
PHP/MySQL on a Windows box,"  --  "Why?"  Which leads me to believe 
that there are significant concerns and/or it's just not the most 
optimal situation.

(please excuse me if this topic has been covered in that past, but i 
didn't see anything in my archive folder.)

Thanks,

Stephen

I do it every day, though it's my development box.  The "why"'s probably
have to do with it not being optimal as opposed to it being a really bad
idea.

I've also written a (very popular) tutorial about getting MySQL going on
Windows machines:

I believe there is a speed issue with PHP running on IIS as a CGI.  The 
www.php.net site has some information.  There are also different 
Windows Installer packages that will install pre-built binaries of AMP.

What is SBS?

Not for production use (see Dan's article for that) but an easy way to
get AMP on Windows for development or testing is to use the XAMPP
distribution:
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

Does anyone have a checklist of things to look at when securing /
locking down a Windows server for use as a production website?

Philippe,

This usually happens when you are not careful with what you pull from the
database. Especially if you are putting the results into a hash or an array
with a foreach or similar  loop. I would suggest to take a closer look on
that part of the code.

So then you'd have to use IIS, right? I'm guessing it's already
latched onto port 80...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XML(?) problem
Message-ID: <20050225214947.GA27758@uranus.faber.nom>

I'm attemtping to write a webapp using the XMLHTTPRequest functionality
as described over at
http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/02/09/xml-http-request.html .  I'm
assuming someone in here has already done this.  If not, anyone know the
URL for the NY XML group (I saw mention of their existence, but no URL).

My problem is here:

function processReqChange()
{
    // only if req shows "complete"
    if (req.readyState == 4) {
        // only if "OK"
        if (req.status == 200) {
            // ...processing statements go here...
    alert("getting the response");
      response  = req.responseXML.documentElement;

    alert("So far, so good!");
      method    = response.getElementsByTagName('method')[0].firstChild.data;
    alert("method  = " + method);
<snip>

I successfully get to "getting the response" alert but it fails at the
next line.  The Javascript console complains that req.responseXML has no
properties and javascript aborts the function (silently!).
req.statusText says everything's OK and I can even see the text of the
XML in req.responseText.

So I'm guessing the error is that I don't have a wellformed XML
document.  Here is what I have:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<response>
    <method>refreshQ</method>
    <result>My Results!</result>
</response>

which, to me, is well-formed.

I googled for everything I can think of and came up with nada.  Any
suggestions?

Latched?!?!  Death Grip on port 80.

There are some hacks out there to allow Apache to handle port 80 but I 
haven't done any of this for a while.

I?ve just gone through something similar.

I read somewhere that the xml request object likes to see that the content
is served up as XML, so either the file extension ends in .xml or you have
the header set as header("Content-type: text/xml");

I?m not sure if this makes any difference or not, but I have gotten it work.
I?d also try alert(response); and make sure you get [object], if not, then
you know that something?s not coming through correctly.

You can also pass your xmldoc into this quick and dirty recursive function
to see what you?re working with:



/**
*    DESCRIBE AN XML FILE BY RECURSIVE LISTING
*
*    calls traverse() recursively to list out nodes and child nodes as list
items
*
*    
** DON'T USE ON FIREFOX: the document.write overwrites the document object
(for reasons unknown)
*    
*    @param xml
*/


function describeXML(xmlDoc){
    var root=xmlDoc.documentElement;
    traverse(root);
    //for(var i in xmlDoc){ document.write(i+"<br>"); }
    /* this is interesting, but not too useful */
}
    



/**
*    TRAVERSES AN XML NODE
*
*    recursive function
*    @param xml.node
*/

function traverse(tree) {
    if(tree.hasChildNodes()) {
    document.write('<ul><li>');
    document.write(tree.tagName+' ('+tree.childNodes.length+') : ');
    for(var i=0; i < tree.childNodes.length; i++){
        traverse(tree.childNodes[i]);
        }
            document.write('</li></ul>');
        }else{
            document.write('<b>'+tree.nodeValue+'</b>');
        }
}

Actually, if IIS on SBS behaves like IIS on XP Pro, it is easy to direct
port 80 to Apache instead of IIS.  The following steps will stop IIS from
grabbing port 80.

1) Goto IIS admin
2) Right click on 'Default Web Site'
3) Select 'Properties'
4) Under 'Web Site' tab, change 'TCP Port' to anything other than 80.
5) Hit Apply

or the other method is to goto Services and stop the 'IIS Admin' service
then set it to manual start.

Either of those ways will get IIS of your back.

Latched?!?!  Death Grip on port 80.

There are some hacks out there to allow Apache to handle port 80 but I
haven't done any of this for a while.

I'll have to set the header then, because ulitmately it's going to be a
PHP file.

You're right.  I get NULL when I do alert(req.responseXML).  Now how the

I couldn't resist responding to this. XMLHTTPrequest is too cool to ignore....

I'd suggest using the DOM methods available to you for both extraction
and insertion. I find them much more friendly and clean to use than a
bunch of document.write statements. I've had pretty good luck with
them for the major mainstream browsers / platforms.

Some of the relevant players will be:

//for the response you get after making your XMLHTTPRequest.
req.responseXML.getElementsByTagName("item");
//create a new element
document.createElement('tagname')
//retreieve a node reference
document.getElementById('id');
//insert a child node
appendChild([node reference])

I created a simple directory listing app that you can check out. Be
careful where you put it though, it shows all the contents of whatever
directory the webserver can read! As a result, it's password protected
with 'password' as the password. Just put it on your server and browse
to 'directory.php'

http://lo-fi.net/blog/archive/getfile.zip

It's poorly documented, and it comes with no warranty. It also has a
problem reading dirs and files that have apostrophe's :-)

More about DOM scripting: you can see what methods and properties are
available to you with the DOM inspector that comes with Firefox
(tools>DOM Inspector). After you open it up, look in the right column
at the top. you'll seee a grid-like icon with an arrow; click that and
choose 'Javascript Object'. Then you can check out all of the
available properties and methods available on the node you have
selected in the left column of the window. It's an extremely handy
tool when debugging. It also tells you what the current DOM structure
is, regardless of your source code. So as you're building up your page
dynamically with your xmlhttprequests, the DOM inspector gives you an
accurate snapshot of the tree.

Well, I'm not.

items = req.responseXML.getElementsByTagName("item");

retunes an object HTMLCollection for item, but I'll be damned if I can
find anything in them!

I certainly will!  Perhaps I can glean some info from it!

Okay, I missed that.  Maybe that can tell me what's going on.  That
venkman debugger was worse than useless.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] 32bit vs AMD 64 versions of Apache and shared objects
Message-ID: <OFC91E13D9.D333141F-ON85256FB5.007CE9E9-85256FB5.007D7991@us.ibm.com>

Hey folks,

I'm trying to configure a Xeon processor-based (EM64T/AMD 64) SuSE 9.2 
Professional machine to run Apache 1.3.33, PHP 5.0.3 and WebSphere 
Application Server 5.1.1.3.   I was able to get all these guys cooperating 
on a 32 bit Pentium III machine on the same version of SuSE Pro.  But I 
seem to be running into some 32 bit vs 64 bit issues on this new machine.

The way things worked out on the older machine was that I had a binary 
installation of Apache (IBM HTTP Server, based on 1.3.28) which used a 
shared object to communicate with WAS, and which used libphp5.so that I 
compiled against it via apxs for PHP.  All was well.

On this machine, however, I can't get the precompiled 32-bit Apache (IHS) 
talking to PHP via libphp5.so, as the PHP build against it creates a 
64-bit object:

# /opt/IBMHttpServer/bin/apachectl configtest
Syntax error on line 231 of /opt/IBMHttpServer/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /opt/IBMHttpServer/libexec/libphp5.so into server: 
/opt/IBMHttpServer/libexec/libphp5.so: cannot open shared object file: No 
such file or directory

# file /opt/IBMHttpServer/libexec/libphp5.so
/opt/IBMHttpServer/libexec/libphp5.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, AMD 
x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped


On the other hand, if I try to compile my own version of Apache, it will 
work with the 64-bit version of libphp5.so, but will not use the 32-bit 
WebSphere plugin:

# /opt/local/apache/bin/apachectl configtest
Syntax error on line 243 of /opt/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /opt/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/mod_ibm_app_server_http.so into 
server: /opt/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/mod_ibm_app_server_http.so: cannot 
open shared object file: No such file or directory

# file /opt/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/mod_ibm_app_server_http.so
/opt/WebSphere/AppServer/bin/mod_ibm_app_server_http.so: ELF 32-bit LSB 
shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped


So, I guess my question is how can I get my 64-bit version of Apache to 
use the 32-bit WAS plugin, or alternately how can I get the 32-bit version 
of IHS to use the 64-bit PHP object?  Is it possible to do that?  If not, 
how would I compile a 32-bit version of libphp5.so on AMD 64 so that the 
32-bit version of IHS can use it? 

Thanks in advance for any pointers.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Safely running root commands
Message-ID: <20050228002347.GA13631@uranus.faber.nom>

Well, my playing around with/obsessing over the whole XMLHttpRequest
object paradigm is paying off.  I've done nothing but write code since
Thursday (well, I've slept some, too) and I have only one major step to
work through...

My GUI talks to a PHP backend.  At the moment, I have some stuff
hard-coded in the PHP functions.  What I need to do is to run some root
commands (specifically postcat and mailq), get the output into PHP,
XML-ize them and send them to the GUI.

My question is: how can I safely run the root commands? Only root can
run those commands.  The PHP script will run as the apache user who
doesn't have access to the root commands. I want my GUI to be accessible
over the web, so some extra security is needed on the backend (as well
as a password on the front-end, but that's a different matter).

I've thought of three ways to do it: 1) have the sysadmin create a sudo
user that can run the given commands with no password, 2) create a
sudo user and store his name and password outside of the document root,
or 3) write some C wrappers and set them suid. I'm not crazy about any
of these solutions. 

Anybody else have a better idea?

Well back in the old days I would copy the binaries required (when
possible) to a separate path for the httpd/apache user, but I was
always very careful to restrict what the apache user could do.

Your OS on the server may also provide some extra protection (chroot
jails etc.). I'm definitely interested to see what everyone else would
do in this situation.

The simplest and most straight forward would probably be number 1 or 2 - but then don't forget that sudo is basically like giving them root for that command.  If that command can modify, the sudo can too.

3) is probably the safest if written well, but then there lies the trick :)  For complex root operations, like filesystem stuff, I hand commands off to a very simple and carefully written daemon that runs as root.  The daemon only accepts very specific commands and responds accodringly.  This is actually similar to option 3, except that the apache process is "further" away from the infamous UID 0 in many ways.

Since the scope of root operations needed in this case seem limited, I'd avoid root all together.  How about a cronjob that dumps the info you need to a database, or even a file?  Or a queue system, where jobs are queued by apache, and a cronjob wakes up every so often to fill the queue with a response?  There might be some delay, but depending on the load you expect, it might be insignificant.

I don't like any of those options.

Are you sure it isn't possible to set this up in such a way that either:

1) cron can run the necessary commands as root, and you scripts just
pick up the data from a neutral location

or 

2) you write a daemon using PHP that runs as root, and listens to a
some port or file for a "go" command, runs the commands, and then
returns the results

Either of those seems preferable to giving the webserver any kind of
escalated privileges.

That's the point of sudo, isn't it? :-)

Nothing that complex.  What I'm doing is manipulating the mail queue:
viewing, deleting and holding email.  Not all that dangerous, but email
is sancrosanct and only root is able to do those things.

No, the point is to have real-time manipulation of the mail queue in a
GUI.  cron won't cut it, IMNSHO.

No can do.  See my email to Hans.

Hmmmm, a daemon. There's an idea I like.  But why would I write a daemon
in PHP?  Sure, I *could* do a daemon in PHP, but I _could_ do it in bash
as well.  Perl or even Python would seem a better language, IMO.

I agree. Now, to figure out how to do it...

This worked really well for me.  I recently used this approach (although the
daemon-portion was written in Perl) and found you can add a nice security
boundary between the PHP script and the system.

Not dangerous?  Check how many sendmail and other mail queue related bugs there have been in the last years - it's up there :)

As I mentioned originally, I'd go with a daemon then, and yeah, in PHP - there's no reason not to.  Something like this to get you started:


function daemonize() {

   $pid = pcntl_fork();

   if( $pid < 0 )
      return NULL;

   if( $pid )
      exit(1);

   posix_setsid();

   $pid = pcntl_fork();

   if( $pid < 0 )
      return NULL;

   if( $pid )
      exit(1);

   return posix_getpid();
}

As far as I know (and from what I learned at our AMD meeting) it's not possible.

You basically need to compile against the 32bit libs, which it probably is doing already, since you're not using PHP 5.1.  But then, to get it to link for 32bit, I'm not sure - possibly try --target=x86-unknown-linux-gnu in your ./configure.

Would be interested to hear what happens :)

I've been trying to transorm some XML on the fly and for whatever reason I
keep getting XML errors... I don't find anything wrong with the xml files
though. I've tried both local and remote files too...still no luck

nat.xml
Warning: Sablotron error on line none: cannot open file
'/hsphere/local/home/skoilnog/edwardprevost.info/PHPStuff/html_style.xsl' in
http://www.edwardprevost.info/PHPStuff/XMLMaker.inc on line 8
Unknown error building web page from XML & XSLT sources. The reason is that
cannot open file
'/hsphere/local/home/skoilnog/edwardprevost.info/PHPStuff/html_style.xsl'
and the error code is 4

The variable magically echos out, but the xslt_process() never runs the
container. Weird.
Anyway here are the files I've been using. Any help would be much
appreciated as xsl and xslt is relatively new to me.

The simplest and most straight forward would probably be number 1 or 2 - but
then don't forget that sudo is basically like giving them root for that
command.  If that command can modify, the sudo can too.

3) is probably the safest if written well, but then there lies the trick :)
For complex root operations, like filesystem stuff, I hand commands off to a
very simple and carefully written daemon that runs as root.  The daemon only
accepts very specific commands and responds accodringly.  This is actually
similar to option 3, except that the apache process is "further" away from
the infamous UID 0 in many ways.

Since the scope of root operations needed in this case seem limited, I'd
avoid root all together.  How about a cronjob that dumps the info you need
to a database, or even a file?  Or a queue system, where jobs are queued by
apache, and a cronjob wakes up every so often to fill the queue with a
response?  There might be some delay, but depending on the load you expect,
it might be insignificant.

html_style.xsl is not HTMLStyle.xsl.
