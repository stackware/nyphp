&gt;<i> PS Ed, your own link to the TIOBE website showed that they listed Cold

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I believe this to be a straw man.
I never said I had &quot;problems with their methodology&quot;. I said &quot;which i 
think are erroneous&quot;, and logically so.
I posted a link to the 2 illogical assumptions that support the TIOBE 
indexes as being fallacious.
I will clearly list them here, as it seems you didn't follow that link 
(poor scholarship):
# that the number of search engine hits for the phrase &#8220;/foo/ programming&#8221; 
is proportional to the &#8220;popularity&#8221; of that language.
# that the proportionality /is the same for different languages/.
It is therefore logically unsound to deduce that the TIOBE indexes are 
correct in a truly accurate esteem.
All they are graphing reduces to search engine results, and nothing more.

&gt;<i> I mean let's face it, people have &quot;proved beyond doubt&quot; all sorts of 
</I>&gt;<i> things which flat out ain't so, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- Kristina
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'm not sure what you are looking to express with that (perhaps 
rhetorical?) question.

&lt;X&gt;Out of curiosity&lt;X&gt;
&lt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&gt;
What would be an example of something &quot;proved beyond doubt&quot; that &quot;flat 
out ain't so&quot;?
(Please refrain from listing some historic event of ignorance, such as 
meat becoming maggots or the Earth being flat. We are discussing a 
comparison of actual market holding betwixt two modern programming 
languages. Feel free to respond off list.)
&lt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&gt;

In fact, there is not a clearly quantified amount of conclusive 
information to accurately deduce that PHP (or any other language) holds 
this or that particular portion of the 'market'. Therefore, to propose 
we find a 'reason' for PHP holding the majority of the 'market share', 
is pure nonsense, as we do not know that PHP holds such a portion. We 
may as well propose to find a reason for which Coldfusion holds the 
largest share of the market, or Python, or Flex, or Java, or COBOL...

Perhaps this thread may be a catalyst to develop a better means of 
accurately surveying language utilization in a granular fashion.
