<PRE>The May meeting of Unigroup (next Thursday May 22) will be a presentation on
web performance, at least one-third of which will be spent on speeing up PHP
in Apache and faster lighter web servers.

This should be a great meeting, and hoping to see many NYPHP'ers there!

  MAIN PRESENTATION
  -----------------

  Topic: Serving High Performance Web Sites - Where Apache Fails

  For nearly a decade, Apache has been seen as the only practical
  choice for serving static and dynamic content.  To this day, it
  powers the majority of all web sites.  However, Apache has several
  limitations and forthcomings (especially in the area of
  performance).  Nearly a decade of experience has many people
  believing that these limitations are inherent in serving content
  (An entire industry has even been created to deal with these
  limitations).  In reality, none of these limitations exist.
  We'll look into some of these shortcomings, and alternative
  technologies which exist that do not suffer from them.

  This talk will focus on technical and theoretical limitations
  inherent to the design of Apache.  There will be at least a few
  benchmark results shown and explained.  A big part of the talk
  will focus on why mod_php fails, and why FastCGI is superior.

  The following alternative web servers will be discussed:
    - FastCGI over mod_{php,perl,ruby,etc}
    - Lighttpd Web Server
    - Nginx  (if there is time to finish the benchmarks)
    - TUX webserver  (discussed briefly, including some
        system layouts possible with it)
