<PRE>localhost:7070/test is what the demo says to type
Windows 2003
Trying to run on my computer until I upload to site
I don't think I have another server running...
I'm sure more info is needed - just hard for a newbie to know what info you 
need until you ask the questions -- thanks!

 want to create a website that's database driven at www.WorshipMV.com 
(recently moved files so need to fix blips in code that are there, there is 
a sample page at <A HREF="http://www.worshipmv.com/site_flash/mzm.html">http://www.worshipmv.com/site_flash/mzm.html</A> - I have a 
list of over 200 houses of worship and the only thing that's stopping me 
from getting this running and selling ads and such is that I want to make it 
searchable so if someone wanted to find a spiritual home that has childcare 
specifically for autistic kids they could do a search and find it - or say a 
Methodist church within 25 miles of their home... that kind of thing - any 
assistance is greatly appreciated.

  What url are you typing to get this error page?

  This does not look like the default apache page.

  What OS are you operating?

  Is this a stand alone server/development system?

  Do you have another http server running?

  It's hard to help without knowing details.

  Subject: [nycphp-talk] error message, trying to see test page,apache is 
running



  Hi,

  I'm very new at this and am following at TechnicalLead tutorial; have 
installed mysql, apache and php, have set up a data test folder, a my.ini 
file (for mysql), an htm test file...

  Can I assume if the apache server is running that I should not change the 
httpd.conf file? that there is something else wrong?

  Kind of frustrated that I'm following the tutorial and that the last 10 
seconds of video one has stalled me with an error message:


       The webpage cannot be displayed



       Most likely cause:
          a.. Some content or files on this webpage require a program that 
you don't have installed.


       What you can try:


             Search online for a program you can use to view this web 
content.





             Retype the address.





             Go back to the previous page.




        Please help!

        Veronika
