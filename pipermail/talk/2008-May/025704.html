<PRE>Ed, I agree, it would be great if we could find some methodology that 
could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt on an empirical basis that PHP 
is a more popular platform than Cold Fusion.  I can't adequately defend 
my contention to your exacting standards at the present moment, because 
you're right, I don't have the data.  But I believe that the data is 
gatherable and that my theory is valid. 

So anyone have any ideas how to do that, links, information, empirical 
studies, etc. etc &amp; etc ... bring 'em on.

We could do an empirical analysis of job postings on 10 or so general 
tech job boards over a time period of a year...?

PS Ed, your own link to the TIOBE website showed that they listed Cold 
Fusion at the bottom of the popularity grid...and PHP was in the top 
half.  But you're saying that you have &quot;problems with their 
methodology&quot;, OK.  But you can have problems with any methodology or  
means of proof, and that in and of itself is an emotional 
response...based on your beliefs and temperament...and btw there's 
nothing wrong with that! :=]

I mean let's face it, people have &quot;proved beyond doubt&quot; all sorts of 
things which flat out ain't so, right?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My comment was solely intended to offer the theory that there is a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cold Fusion -- whatever that reason might be, and to solicit 
</I>comments 
&gt;<i> &gt; therein from the other people who post to this list as to what that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason may be.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> But you  are assuming your conclusion in your premise Kristina.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;PHP has so much more of a market share overall than does Cold Fusion&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You need to prove that before anyone, including members of this list, 
</I>&gt;<i> can even begin to look for 'the reason'.
</I>&gt;<i> In other words you can't ask:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Why does PHP have a larger market share than Coldfusion?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Unless you can demonstrate that it does.
</I>&gt;<i> You may 'feel' that is true, or even 'think' that it is, but that is 
</I>&gt;<i> poor (and emotional) scholarship.
</I>&gt;<i> Show us some links. Give us some data. Prove that PHP &quot;has so much 
</I>more 
&gt;<i> of a market share overall&quot;, don't just declare it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My impression on the much larger market share is primarily based on 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> &gt; fact that there are a lot more people looking to hire PHP 
</I>programmers 
&gt;<i> &gt; than there people looking to hire Cold Fusion programmers.  
</I>Therefore, 
&gt;<i> &gt; more companies must be using PHP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> Now that's getting better, but what is your 'impression' based on.
</I>&gt;<i> It's my impression that I see as many Coldfusion offers floating 
</I>around 
&gt;<i> as I do PHP.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that is most likely because I subscribe to both a PHP and a 
</I>&gt;<i> Coldfusion jobs-list.however, I wouldn't say that I can deduce from 
</I>that 
&gt;<i> information which language is being used more, and actually holding 
</I>more 
&gt;<i> of the market.
</I>&gt;<i> How do you know &quot;there are a lot more people looking to hire PHP 
</I>&gt;<i> programmers&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> And what if &quot;a lot more people looking to hire PHP programmers&quot;, are 
</I>&gt;<i> doing so because they are migrating FROM it, or translating it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [Not only do I have 12 years as a consultant (with the concommitant 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; huge volume of time perusing job postings and answering RFPs), but 
</I>I 
&gt;<i> &gt; have 3 years as a recruiter/account manager in the tech field and 
</I>an 
&gt;<i> &gt; abundant knowledge of the job market in tech, and who is looking 
</I>for 
&gt;<i> &gt; what, what companies are using what platforms, and etc. -- is this 
</I>data 
&gt;<i> &gt; not &quot;relevant&quot; or &quot;scholarly&quot; enough for your taste?]  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> Nope. I'm a geek, give me numbers, graphs charts and information, not 
</I>&gt;<i> your opinion alone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With all due respect,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kristina
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> (My tone is challenging, but I mean no offense Kristina, just looking 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> spurn you unto defending your assumption. =D)
