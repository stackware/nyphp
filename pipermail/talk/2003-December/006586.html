&gt;<i> What about vBulletin ?

</I>Yes, vBulletin does looks pretty good. And I 
think it was under consideration for NYPHP.

I am not sure why it wasn't chosen.
(I do recall Hans saying something
like buying a license for something 
was definitely an option -- so price 
was not an issue)
The  impression I got was that some
members already were experienced with
Invision -- so we went with that.

Anyway the present forum (Invision) is a short term 
solution -- the long term solution is going to be
to build as Chris Shiflett put it earlier
('twas oft thought but ne're so well expressed)
&quot;...a forum in PHP that doesn't suck.&quot;

Maybe you could start a topic in the NYPHP 
forums describing vBulletins best features.
In it you could ask for opinions about which 
features people think would be of most value 
for the new forum which is in the works.
