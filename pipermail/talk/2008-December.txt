Subject: [nycphp-talk] Htaccess and php user account
Message-ID: <20081202011457.CVNE11341.hrndva-omta01.mail.rr.com@DeJaVu>

I'm trying to set up a user account with htaccess and mysql.

 

But the shared hosting account doesn't have mod_auth_mysql htaccess module
installed on the machines and I can't get root access.

 

How else are folks implementing accounts?

 

In php?

 

If so, what's the best general way to implement that.  Do you use session
variables for that?

 

My primary concern about implementing accounts in php is that php can stop
running on the server.  If that happens, the security becomes non-existent.
Plus, the php code can be dumped right to the browser.

 

I'd much rather server level security than in processes that can stop.

 

Thoughts on account security approaches, please.

Can you describe a senario where php stops working and as a result php would
stop?

Yes, theoretically apache could be reconfigured so its thinks that .php
files are just a text files, but if mod_php were to "crash", which generally
brings down the worker thread and fixes itself.

Session variables and a name and crypted password string in the database are
the way to go generally. I could reccomend more sofisticated approaches,
such as having php authenticate against LDAP, or the mysql database users
(assuming you restrict database access on a per user level), but if your
doing shared hosting (no root access), this is probably the best way.

Most php web apps work this way.

I'm not sure which process died, but I was programming one night and all of
the sudden all of my php code was being dumped to my browser.

 

I called my hosting provider and they said the underlying process had died
for some reason.

 

I can't remember if we did a reboot or if the process was started back up
independently.

 

Ever since then, I've taking into consideration that php is not necessarily
that secure.  One hiccup from the server and security could be compromised.
I keep sensitive data out of those files.

 

I was more curious about how it might be implemented in case my client
didn't upgrade the server, but my client will upgrade for more than just
this reason.

 

I know Zencart and other apps doesn't rely on htaccess, but rather php, but,
if I'm going to develop an app for which I am liable, I really think server
level is the only way to go.

Michele,
I think your ISP lied to you. Assuming its apache and mod_php I'm pretty
sure that the only explanation was they reconfigured apache wrong, restarted
apache, you saw the issue, reported it, and they fixed it.

If your server is a windows server (unlikely in a shared hosting senario) or
this is something like lighthttpd or php running on apache through some
configuration I'm not totatly familiar with like CGI, then maybe this can
happen.

If what you experienced is a common occurrence with mod_php, I hope others
on this list will chime in. If it is I'm going to cease using apache and
mod_php in production environments.

I heard that PHP has always been notorious for sometimes not  
processing requests poorly and sending back the source code for pages  
to the client:

It's a shame that guy's blog no longer exists. At least the TechCrunch

Justin,

 

I wouldn't stop using php.  It's still a useful language, but it runs as a
process on the server.  It's not build into server behavior.  I just
wouldn't use if to account security, personally.

 

I was on a virtual dedicated linux account with godaddy.  I know they have a
bad rep, but I'm under the impression they know how of configure a server
properly.

 

Also, here's the situation.  It was down for a short time before I
discovered it.  The likelihood of a hacker being on the site or sniffing the
site at that exact moment was fairly slim.  However, if it goes down and you
don't discover it, it would be a problem.

 

It's just something to keep in mind.  I would store data in a databasesand
passwords in a separate directory where http access has been revoked
entirely.  I do not put password in php, just in case.

 

Perhaps, there's a better way to configure the server, but the servers I use
have all been configured by the hosting provider.  Godaddy's not the only
one I've worked with, but you have very little way of knowing how different
providers have configured the shared accounts.

 

Michele

I don't want to seem insensitive, but please keep in mind that you're  
speaking to a pretty informed community of people who don't look upon  
FUD and misinformation too kindly. It's pretty clear that you lack the  
depth required for your personal preferences to be helpful to others.

Wearing my sys admin hat: mod_php is not thread-safe right? Using 
mpm_prefork or mpm_itk you can make Apache 2.x run without threading.

This has nothing to do with mod_php/Apache that I've ever seen.  It's a
configuration issue.  As I said in my talk, if security is a real concern,
don't use a shared server that's administered by who-knows-who.

Shiflett's post nails it - as does this quote:

"PHP has always been notorious for sometimes not processing requests
poorly..."

Maybe those who configure servers should learn what a double negative is
first.

More generally, your top-level scripts getting dumped to the browser  
should not be a security issue to begin with.

If one is concerned that access to source makes something insecure,  
then they have no business using an open-source web server (like  
apache!).  I mean, anyone can just go grab all the source code!  The  
sky is surely falling!

Following up on my previous, more general post.

If you're just using PHP to control access to html content, and you're  
worried that your shared host is going to bork your apache  
configuration (which clearly is what happened in your case, assuming  
apache), you basically do the following:

1) Do a typical PHP auth setup of whatever design.  User accounts in  
mysql, with md5'd passwords.
2) Keep anything sensitive out of the web root.

So, very simplified, you've got something like this:

/some/dir/webroot -- webroot
/some/dir/secure -- not accessible by apache
/some/dir/lib/db.php - php script that contains any sensitive database  
connection information (note: your database shouldn't be accepting  
connections from just anyone, either.  That's why there's a "host"  
field in mysql.user.
/some/dir/webroot/page.php might look like:

<?PHP
// make sure the user has authenticated.
if (! auth() ){
	header("Location: login.php");
	exit();
}

//include the protected content
include "../lib/page.html";
?>

So even if your apache config goes south and spits out PHP code, all  
anyone sees is the content of page.php, above.

Exercise: Find the vulnerability in page.php that anyone can exploit.   
It must be useful.  The fact that there's a "lib" directory above the  
webroot is not really something that needs to be a secret.

Many PHP frameworks out there (cake and zend come to mind) use exactly  
this approach.

Thanks to your soft, delicate input, I've been doing a little more research.

I was ps -ef on the linux server.  Php appears to be configured into the
server and the process goes down due to misconfiguration, is it not the same
process handling the htaccess?  Does that mean basically all web services
have stopped on the server and not even htaccess would protect it, leaving
the entire server vulnerable?  Or will htaccess still be working?

So, if this is a misconfiguration issue, that means if you don't have a sys
admin, that the programmer needs to learn the configuration and ensure it's
correct on the server?

mod_auth_mysql *is* an Apache module.

My personal opinion is that programmers should know more than just

You're still operating under the impression that something went wrong  
with the software.

Nothing went wrong with the software.  The software worked exactly as  
it was supposed to.  The problem was that it was misconfigured.   
(Unless there really is some bug in apache that nobody here has ever  
seen/verified).  So, Garbage In (Configuration), Garbage (or, your  
source files, in this case) Out.

Even that facebook story ends up saying:

	"After looking at every possible angle, I was unable to configure our  
Apache build to serve source code even if we wanted to. What we  
eventually found was a single server running a standard distribution  
build of Apache in our production pool of several thousand web severs.  
A lot has been posted online blaming PHP for this, however, the server  
that we eventually found was not running PHP."

He goes on to suggest the same thing I did in my last message.

If you rely on a server to deploy your applications you should do one  
of two things:

	1) Know enough about server administration/configuration
	2) Pay someone (or some organization) that does.

Thanks for the interesting post. I was initially confused by one thing:
> /some/dir/lib/db.php - php script that contains any sensitive database 

I was always under the impression as that Apache/PHP cannot access scripts 
outside of webroot, which after some further thought appears to be only 
applicable to script files that are directly accessed (such as the page.php 
script in the original post). The script file with the db access information 
is not to be served up under any circumstances and it is also not necessary as 
Apache/PHP can access the local file system and read/write from/to any place 
the access restrictions allow.
This way the sensitive information is off-limits via the web and technically 
all that is needed in webroot is a single script file that only calls at least 
one other script that is located somewhere else outside of webroot. Sometimes 
the most difficult things are really darn easy.

This isn't necessarily PHP but... close enough? You could script a solution
in PHP and indeed I might.

I had two CentOS servers' date info somehow go bad over the weekend. When I
came back to work they thought it was 1993, wreaking havoc with the
PHP/MySQL application hosted thereon. I restarted ntpd and they are now
apparently doing fine, thanks. But I have some tables where the record
creation date is saved using MySQL's  now(). There are now some rows with
the wrong value in this field and I am not quite clever enough to see the
best way to fix.

The last output I have from the 'date' command before it was corrected is
Wed Mar  3 18:40:05 EST 1993. When we got back to the present, 'date' said
Tue Dec  2 09:20:05 EST 2008. Should I convert both to Unix timestamps,
subtract the smaller from the larger and add that number of seconds to the
values that I know are wrong? btw I know this number won't be exact but
close enough will do, there being no alternative AFAIK.

Gratefully,

As someone else pointed out, if you don't then you should probably hire

I love answering my own questions (no sarcasm intended).

SELECT timestampdiff(SECOND, '1993-03-03 18:40:05', '2008-12-02 09:20:05');

Answer: 497025600

UPDATE your_table set created = date_add(created, INTERVAL 497025600 SECOND)
WHERE year(created) = 1993;

If anyone sees anything worth commenting please feel free. Otherwise, case
closed, just thought I'd post an answer for the record.

ffmpeg

I compile it myself on linux, but I'm sure you can find windows binaries.

The developers of the project rarely do formal releases and highly encourage
you to download the latest code from SVN. I find it an annoying policy on
their part, but would find it forgivable it they would at least linked to
websites that provided binaries.

Once the purchase is completed, we want to provide the link to the

Unfortunately we keep getting 404 errors. This is a shared

If you want the file to live outside the www that's fine, but i doubt  
you can do it like you did in the rewrite.  I would make the rewrite  
point to a php script that reads the file then outputs it for download  
using the appropriate headers etc.

Hello,

Why not just email them the book (size permitting)?

It's too big. My other option is Amazon S3, which we've already used
on another, larger project. But I thought it would be kind of useful
to figure out how to do it this way as well.

I'm not really concerned about the customer downloading the book
multiple times, I just don't want people to be able to access it
directly and get it.

Like I said have a php script serve it as a download. Doing it this  
way allows you to make sure that the user logged in.

Message-ID: <27158556.251228337220036.JavaMail.root@twoguyshosting.com.>

So I am trying to use Apache Lucene to add searching to a site I am working on. And so far I have been able to use the PHP/Java Bridge for this. 

http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/ 

Has anyone used this before??

For the most part I have this working but I am trying to impletement MultiFieldQueryParser but not sure how to pass the fields.  I have tried the following:

$parser = new Java( 'org.apache.lucene.queryParser.MultiFieldQueryParser',array('name','description'),$analyzer );

I have also tried:
$parser = new Java( 'org.apache.lucene.queryParser.MultiFieldQueryParser',"name,description",$analyzer );

AND
$parser = new Java( 'org.apache.lucene.queryParser.MultiFieldQueryParser',"name description",$analyzer );



And I am not getting anything, has anyone done this before??

Thanks,

Donald

This question and solution seems to come up time and time again. Perhaps 
it needs to be incorporated in the FAQ.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Session timing out too soon
Message-ID: <8787CB11-546D-4A4F-9EB1-F8114F243DE5@email.smith.edu>

Greetings,

I have an application built for internal use that has a user login and  
then uses sessions to track their state.  I am running into a problem  
in that their session seems to expire if they are on one page for  
somewhere between 15-25 minutes.  This creates a big problem because  
they type up a long report, submit it and then get booted out of the  
application without the report being saved.

I would like to have the user be able to be logged in for a full eight  
hour day, regardless of their level of activity.

How would I do this?  I would appreciate any suggestions.  Also of  
note, I am in a shared hosting environment.

I tried three different solutions without any luck so far:
1) Using session_set_cookie_params() to extend the lifetime of the  
session cookie.
2) Using a javascript function to to periodically call an image to  
simulate page activity.
3) Using ini_set(session.gc_maxlifetime) to set the the number of  
seconds for php to wait before data may be seen as garbage and be  
cleaned up.

Thanks,

-Aaron

The default setting of 0 for session.cookie_lifetime means 'until the
browser is closed', so you shouldn't need to mess with this.

You're on the right track here, but you need to be calling a php script
which accesses the session to renew the last access time.  Just
requesting a static image won't do it.

The problem you're most likely having here is that any scripts on the
machine which don't have this setting will trigger the session garbage
collector with the default settings, and cheerfully delete your session
files.

If you switch to a custom session storage system (ie, database-backed
sessions), then you can control the GC this way because they won't be
cleaned up by the default garbage collector.

This one has been asked before.  The default lifetime for sessions is 24 
minutes.  However, in a shared environment, the default lifetime is the 
lowest of any user's choice; so if one user on the shared server has the 
default lifetime set to 1 minute, EVERYONE'S sessions expire after one 
minute (more or less; read up on how session files are randomly deleted).  
Because PHP can't tell the difference between that user's session files and 
your session files, they're all in the same common directory.

So.  What you need to do is specify your own directory for your session 
files (/sharedserver/myroot/mysessionfiles/), and then set the cleanup 
lifetime to whatever you want (session.gc_maxlifetime).

Here's an explanation with some sample code:

    This is the real answer.  PHP sessions (as well as the session 
mechanisms built into other systems such as JSP and ASP.NET) are flawed 
in a number of ways.  They are highly seductive to newbies,  since they 
help you write an application that almost works quickly,  but you can 
spend forever dealing with glitches and stability problems with them.

    User authentication should be done like this:

http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/webauth:sec10.pdf

    That paper has been around for a decade and it still astonishes me 
that people are still using authentication systems that don't really 
work.  I mean,  an authentication system that's bound to a specific 
language?  That isn't good enough for the booby prize,  never mind the 
enterprise. 

The cryptography-based system in the above paper is scalable and can be 
implemented in about 100 lines of code in just about any language.  That 
mean you can log in once and access applications written in PHP,  Perl,  
Java,  Ruby,  C# or whatever.  It's possible to authenticate a user 
using only cryptography,  so you put a very limited load on a central 
database or session store.
 
Other than that,  it turns out that the sessions scope is rarely the 
~correct~ scope for any application.  For instance,  I've seen that 
sites that use language-bound sesson mechanisms often lose about 50% of 
sales because of glitches.  These glitches are hard to reproduce or 
monitor because session systems don't provide any log of lost shopping 
carts.  You'll hear businessmen complain about how they can't afford to 
do things right,  but then they're just happy to lose $2K of sales a day 
to a bad shopping cart.

That was an awesome read.
I felt really good for doing something similar for some years now :)

I also agree that authentication should not rely on anything more than a
well written algorythm.

I was going to recommend you post this over to the PHP/Java Bridge list, 
but I see you've already done that :)

I have not used Lucene before, but there are some resources I came across 
when building a Project Zero/WebSphere sMash app recently.   They may be 
of use:

I have a confusion about solution mentioned in this article, although I can't 
test this properly.

Read following line from that article:

"Now our session files are stored in the new directory and the regular garbage 
collector will not see them, so those files will survive at least that long 
as defined in gc_maxlifetime."

Does it mean that Garbage collector will automatically remove session files 
after new "session.gc_maxlifetime" value?

However according to PHP manual, as defined in php.ini, one has to write own 
garbage collection solution to clean-up such files. Here is relevant section 
from php.ini.

; NOTE: If you are using the subdirectory option for storing session files
;       (see session.save_path above), then garbage collection does *not*
;       happen automatically.  You will need to do your own garbage
;       collection through a shell script, cron entry, or some other method.
;       For example, the following script would is the equivalent of
;       setting session.gc_maxlifetime to 1440 (1440 seconds = 24 minutes):
;          cd /path/to/sessions; find -cmin +24 | xargs rm

If author means that session files will last longer till 
new "session.gc_maxlifetime" but after that "it will do reside there" then he 
would mention about above php.ini's NOTE to design own garbage collection 
method.

Thanks,

When creating a report how do you guys handle line breaks?
When printing a  table text table cell how do you do so that part of

Are you looking for line breaks or page breaks?

Line breaks, you'll have to stick with a well placed PHP_EOL

Page breaks, you'll need to use the page-break-before page-break-after CSS
properties.There are actually a bunch of print specific CSS properties
available: http://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_ref_print.asp

It's surprising how much control you can get over printouts with CSS.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP FTP function...
Message-ID: <1653101522.20081209121012@qualityadvantages.com>

Hello and Greetings, NYPHP,

   I have a potential project that requires the ability to do file
   transfers from one website to another using FTP, i.e. the files and
   folders are on an ftp server and need to be downloaded to a folder
   /directory that is running on the server making the request.

   Is this a possibility using PHP? Has anyone done it successfully?

   I am looking at the possibilities of using :


   $url = "http://test.com/index.html"; fopen($url, "r");

   and/or
   
   $f = fopen("ftp://test.com");
   ftp_pasv($f, true);

Pointers very much apprecated. TIA.

In theory... those CSS properties are only supported by Safari, and
IE8.  Unfortunately I found that out the hard way.

There are FTP functions built-in to PHP. See http://www.php.net/ftp

Sorry, just found the page that has all the ftp commands in the PHP
manual, didn't see it the first time.

But I would appreciate any pointers in any event.

Opera should be able to do it as well, but I assume you tried it and found it 
not to be the case?

Have you tried fpdf (fpdf.org) to make things in PDF format? 

I tried making HTML reports a few years ago and concluded the support is 
simply not there to make it worthwhile, and went PDF instead.

But with PDF can you control page breaks? Page headings?

Is there a default number of lines per page?
When printing a cell in a table is there a way to tell how many lines
printing a cell will take
because a cell can be 1 line or many.

I have create a report but the managers do not want part of a table record
in one page
and part on another page

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

The CSS method will work if you allow for ample clearance between page 
margins (which, when printing in HTML, you have no control).

I have gone the fpdf route before also, but that led to it's own 
challenges such as making sure the content fits within the fixed box 
cells drawn, and then there are all the precalculations required to 
figure out how large an expandable table can be before it exceeds the 
page length and when to split the table onto the next page.

The easiest way, I think (might even be considered a cop-out!), is to 
export the table data to Excel and let the end user figure out how they 
want the report formatted. It's usually an easy sell once you point out 
that, with the data in a spreadsheet, they have the power to manipulate 
the data in hundreds of ways and generate their own additional reports.

Determined by font size, line height and page size.

This is a bitch.  FPDF can do this, but it becomes damn near impossible 
if you have more than one such entry in a row.  I put a lot of effort 
into it and finally decided it only works if there is one multi-line 
value and it is at the *end* of the line.

Thanks to all for your answers.

I have been searching the internet and it seems that it is very hard to
create reports.

Thanks again,

Nestor :-)

Nestor,  you could use html2pdf which will let you create all the code in
HTML and then export it as a PDF, a line break is just adding a <br>

or dompdf as someone suggested before, but i think that the 2nd has no more
support (i read so in the forums at sf.net some months ago)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] reports/graphs realtime mashups
Message-ID: <493EC3D3.3060902@omnistep.com>

This is somewhat, but not completely related to the "Report with line 
breaks" thread.

I discovered yesterday that Google spreadsheets allows importing 
external data into the tables with the "=importData(URL)" function. 
Thought it would be cool to import some weather and home automation data 
which I am store on my home server.

Here's a small mashup which I threw together this morning that displays 
real time usage of my home furnace and the outside temperature.

http://www.omnistep.com/furnacemonitor/

Runs off linux,apache,php,mysql,google spreadsheets & gadgets.
There are links to source and component info in case you are interested 
in how it works.

It was surprisingly easy to throw together graphs and reports with 
google apps+gadgets. The only issue I might have with using this in 
"real" production is the passing of proprietary company data over Google 
(and possibly third party) networks and also the fact that running large 
dataset apps with javascript can turn a Pentium x GHz computer into what 
seems like a 386sx running Windows 3.1 (occasional freezing and crashing 
is expected).

Message-ID: <721f1cc50812091230y198f3751qf5a3a99803ad1f9c@mail.gmail.com>

Working on a page that gives the user the ability to do some sophisticated
searching of a database. I do an Ajax request, display the query resullts in
a table and add an event handler to the 'click' event on each row so that a
tooltip/context menu pops up for the user to do various actions with that
row of data. One of those actions is "view details" -- zoom in to see more.
The decision to be made is, should this view

(a)  pop up in a new window (or tab, if the user's browser is set to do
that) so that the state of the form that did the search will stay intact if
they decide to go back, even though it adds some clutter their workspace? or

 (b) appear in the current window, even though it means if they hit their
back button they will have to start over with their search parameters? or

(c) do something else? e.g., me go to the trouble of saving their search
parameters in the session and restoring the form state from session,
whenever such exists?

Just wondering how you folks approach this not-uncommon problem in the age
of Web 2.0

I have always liked the way that ebay motors allows you to search, it  
uses a sidebar and then allows you to remove items by clicking an X

Another method may be that of how politics.com does the login screen  
using a modal div that greys out the background page.

Display the record in a (possibly modal) float-div-type window.

Most of the major javascript libraries do this out-of-the-box or with  
some kind of UI plug-in.

Or it might make more sense to do some kind of border-layout with  
three panes.  A Search Form pane, a search results pane, and a detail  
pane.

slide down the new content.

A client had a similar requirement so so I built him something like this:

https://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/listing/dodMovies.jsp?category=All

My stuff runs on a protected server but you get the general idea.  You 
can do it a couple of ways, either by stuffing the extra data in a 
hidden DIV when you generate the results table or by making an Ajax call 
to populate the DIV when you make the display:none -> display:block call.

As a Front End guy, another vote for this. And a general nudge for using
thickbox.
http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
We use it all the time. I consider it the best implementation of the
modal window.

My thanks to everybody. Modal div sounds like a nice idea. I am already
using Prototype so I think I will look for an implementation based on it
rather than JQuery.

Maybe 
http://ui.jquery.com/
will convince you to use JQuery :-)

Using multiple libraries got you down?  With the Google AJAX Libraries API, it 
makes it easy to use libraries without actually installing and maintaining the 
library infrastructure locally -- with some other benefits like opening the 
possibility that the user already has the library cached.

Hi everyone,

Been discussing with one of the many Hanses about a possible
presentation in 2009, and would like to know which topics would be of
most interest to you:

* The standard Joomla update
* Experiences learned implementing a massive traffic site for MTV
* Integrating your site with KickApps for rich, hosted social media
functionality

DISCLAIMERS: I'm a founder of Joomla, and seem to give a yearly
presentation on what is happening with that project. I'm also VP
Developer Relations at KickApps, and have done a lot of integration
with Joomla, Drupal and Wordpress since they are such an open company
;-)

Are you using this in production? Seems they recommend that we don't.

Interesting.  I'm wondering what the security implications of this are.

Also there's the issue of giving Google even more data about browsing 
habits.

Finally, there are folks like myself that use Firefox's No Script add on 
that allows me to limit which domains can load JavaScript in my browser.  
I tend to not allow sites other than the one I'm looking at to run JS.

Thanks for the counterpoints Dan,  

I agree with you and use NoScript too.  Google's AJAX Libraries can be 
convenient, but like everything, there are drawbacks to consider.

You pretty much nailed it, Dan. In exchange for convenience, you let
Google own your users' browsing habits.

I'm not so concerned about security -- I think it would be incredibly
embarrassing to Google if one of those hosted javascripts got
compromised -- but I do would worry about application breakage should
Google update to a newer version of a library, or delete an old, buggy
version.

And agreed wrt NoScript. On the other hand, it should be safe to allow
those scripts... see potential embarrassment to Google if any of those
hosted libs contains trojan code. One hopes they have part of the
brain trust actually looking at the scripts before committing them to
the global Googlescape.

Although if you want to, you can tell Google which version you want, which
should protect you from an unwanted upgrade.

Ok, I can setup HD video, and will stream it too. However y'all still
have to help me decide on what to present.

There could be problems with man in the middle attacks, but that's goes for
just about anything being served up remotely.

DNS hijacking could be a worry. I'd say ajax.googleapis.com is a
pretty high-value target for someone who wants to quietly inject their
code into a lot of different sites.

Instead of re-inventing the wheel, I suggest taking a look at some of 
the code written by others. This is a common problem to any web developer.

One example would be CakePHP's Sanitize class:
http://api.cakephp.org/1.2/sanitize_8php-source.html

Chris Shiflett's blog has a lot of resources on PHP security:

Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.00.0812142058420.27188@pluto.atopia.net>

Hi All,

I'm wondering if there are any open source good project management tools 
out there (PHP based).  They would have to be web based and integrate with 
email, and provide:

"state-of-the-art project management software which will include automated 
project scheduling, issue management, risk management, resource management 
and other tools; skills training for project managers; consistent project 
management methodologies, and Proactive communication of project and task 
status."

There's a larger list, but before we purchase something, I'm wondering if 
there's anything open source?

Thanks for any suggestions!

-MJ

purchase decision is based upon the irrational hope that some piece of  
software will mitigate organizational and managerial weaknesses.

I'd be delighted to see a system that actually facilitates work  
getting done instead of getting in the way, if anyone has seen such a  
thing.

I agree. Most of these project management solutions stink. Its for an online web based company.

And you forgot the kitchen sink :-)

I think Ive spent years looking for a good open source solution and Ive 
never found anything close. (Maybe we should write one? :-)

As far as commercial solutions go, right now we're using FogBugz but 
Mingle looks pretty good too.

FogBugz is nice for what it does.  The killer feature is email  
integration, IMO.  Mantis (mantisbt.org) is a nice (PHP) open-source  
issue-tracker that's pretty flexible as far as use cases go.

Project Management is bigger than just issue-tracking.

There's the school of thought that says "Project Management is about  
Communication (and everything else is a waste of time)" -- mostly  
championed by the 37signals guys (their product, basecamp (http://www.basecamphq.com 
), is actually pretty useful for a small-ish kind of enterprise.  (At  
least) one of their founders, Jason Fried, is pretty outspoken about  
the philosophy.  I went to an event while I was out in Denver where he  
pontificated about that sort of stuff for a long time.  I don't agree  
with a lot of what he says, but it's still thought-provoking.  There's  
a low-fi recording of the talk and some Q/A here:

<http://blog.electricmindcontrol.net/2008/08/jason-fried-of-37signals-new-denver-ad-club-audio-notes/ 
 >

The highlight for me was when he said he'd run his company into the  
ground before including GANTT charts as a feature, no matter how many  
people ask for it. So if there's an interest in taking a step back,  
you might want to pass that around as food for thought.

We used to use it. Not good enough to track what's going on in our 
projects. FogBugz was a compromise. Now Ive been looking at Mingle because 
the workflow is pretty useful.

Agreed.  I think there's a big market here for an open source project 
management solution.  I'd gladly provide hosting/svn, etc. if people 
wanted to get together and start one.

The company I used to work at used scrum for projects and used VersionOne
http://www.versionone.com/ for planning, tracking, etc

Once i got used to it i found it to be of great use in keeping things on
track and specific tasks etc in order.

Building of the Empire State Building was project managed with a pad  
and a pencil. 365 days start to finish.

Would be interesting to read up on how they did it. And not an iPhone  
in sight.  :-)

You should check out web2project.net  This is a new open source project
management tool that sounds like it answers most of your issues...you can
demo it at demo.web2project.net

Back in the day, I wrote 6502 assembly code using pencil and paper before 
sitting down at a keyboard, but I dont think that would work for project 
management today :-)

Hi All,

I'm wondering if there are any open source good project management tools

out there (PHP based).  They would have to be web based and integrate
with 
email, and provide:

"state-of-the-art project management software which will include
automated 
project scheduling, issue management, risk management, resource
management 
and other tools; skills training for project managers; consistent
project 
management methodologies, and Proactive communication of project and
task 
status."

There's a larger list, but before we purchase something, I'm wondering
if 
there's anything open source?

Thanks for any suggestions!

-MJ

Hello,

I've had great experience with mantis and basecamp (again, for small 
organizations)..

I tried using SugarCRM for a while, even built some custom views, but 
the UI is
pretty awful and the workflow didn't fit in with us.

Gantt charts aren't that bad. = ]

Dears,

I need to run PHP script every 10 seconds , I can do that with (while true)
and sleep(10), but I need to the script always run on Linux machine as
service.

Any Ideas?

if you could change it so it runs every minute (instead of every 10 seconds)
you could use a cron...

On your distro of choice execute "man crontab".  Also try "crontab -l" to familiarize yourself with how the cron layout looks.

While not as elegant as some of the other suggestions above, you could 
run "screen" to create a virtual terminal that remains active (even when 
you log off), then use the "watch" command to run a script every x 
seconds like so:

watch -n 10 ./myphpscript

Use CTRL-A D to drop out of the screen terminal and leave it running in 
the background.

Or craft the script so that it loops five times while waiting ten seconds and 
then hook that script into cron.

You probably want the script to run 10 seconds after it last ran to
prevent multiple instances in the case where the script takes more
than 10 seconds to run.   If you use cron, make sure you have a lock
to prevent the script from running simultaneously.

Message-ID: <40fcda730812161621u514fd3cfvcd1e6fec5792168b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Can anyone suggest an offline program or utility to profile response time
for an intranet website during various visits.

I'm trying troubleshooting a peculiar problem with one of our intranet
websites in IE6. The site is not fully functional in non-IE browsers (IE6
being the company standard). On the first visit to site for the day, the
site takes good 30-45 seconds to respond, any subsequent visits are under 1
sec, as expected. After some general testing (cache, cookies, etc.) I am
fairly confident that the workstation configuration are not a problem. The
issue can be reproduced on a number of workstations using a number of
different NT accounts. For every account, the slow down is only once, during
the initial visit.

I have been looking for various tools to profile the site response and have
consistently been running into the following issues:

1. the site is on an intranet, inaccessible from the internet, which rules
out all the online tools.
2. the site is using SSL, which caused Fiddler (
http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/) and couple of other utilities to skip
it altogether.

I am not the developer of the site in question, but since I'm given the task
of troubleshooting the issue, I want to back up my obvious conclusions with
some numbers.

Thanks in advance.

- Nasir

You can try using some unix utilities like wget to do timings. PHP has  
CURL commands you can use to automate some testings. There are also  
testing tools, like Selenium, you can use on any computer to do  
automated testing.

The fact that it doesn't work with non-IE browsers is somewhat of a 
hurdle, but if it does with with Firefox, there is a nice plugin called 
Yslow that will profile your web pages and offer suggestions on how to 
optimize.

Will try cURL and see how it works.

Just browsed through Selenium's site. Interesting concept. I will see how
involved the setup is and would it even be worth the effort.

Thanks for the suggestions.

Yeah, that's a bummer. YSlow is my first choice for any task like this. But
the site not working in FF is one of the reason I'm looking for another
solution.

What do you mean by "not working in FF"?  Things just don't look right
or functionality is actually degraded, or more importantly, requests
aren't actually being made?  If it just appearance, you can still get
some good data with FF.

as far as I can tell, requests are being made, but the it seems to encounter
an XML error in the first few lines of the data that is sent back.

Wasn't sure if I would get any useful data out of YSlow with that. Will try
it first thing tomorrow.

I am passing a variable and value using the query method to myreport.php.

I can see using phpinfo() the query string and the var and the value:
_GET["drange"]AND (proj_adv_date >= DATE_FORMAT(\'2008-12-17\',\'%Y-%m-%d\')
AND proj_adv_date <= DATE_FORMAT(\'2009-12-17\', \'%Y-%m-%d\'))

but when I put the following code in the program dies:
 $drange  = $_GET['drange'];

I jjust discovered that if I change the variable to $xdrange the program
does nto stop
 $xdrange  = $_GET['drange'];

What????

I need the variable to be $drange because it is a date range that I use to
create the query and this program calls itself.

What could be causing the problem?  What should I do to use this variable
$drange?

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

When you say it "dies", you should get some sort of an error status
message. Make sure you're displaying error messages (E_ALL, maybe),
and you should get something more useful.

Difficult to analyse but Is directive "register_globals" set to "On" either in 
php.ini or in your script?

Btw, passing SQL chunk (i.e implementation logic) via query string is not good 
method. Instead you should pass just necessary values of dates etc.

Hi,

web2project is not new.  It is really /dotProject/ with a new skin but 
it does not include the Helpdesk module.

Former dotProject and current web2project contributor here...

First off, Helpdesk hasn't ever been a core module and iirc, it's
deprecated... I don't think it's a purposeful decision, just the fact
that it's rarely updated.

More importantly,, web2project is not just "dotproejct with a new skin":

*  We're steadily working towards XHTML 1.0 compliance.  Since I was
one of the guys to do this on the (since deprecated) dotProject Head
development, I'm taking care of these things as we can.

*  The underlying permissions system has a caching layer built in.
>From our tests - both in dev and in production with 400+ products -
we've seen response times improve by over 50% and a 90% reduction in
the number of queries performed.  I am hosting 5-6 production
customers on it right now.

*  The security fixes are numerous, but the biggest one -
http://caseysoftware.com/blog/vulnerability-disclosure-dotproject -
limits users from performing arbitrary actions.

*  We've reworked portions of the database - for example, making
enumerated types separate fields as opposed to /n delimited strings -
to make the system easier to interact with programatically.  The
Vision for this is to eventually have a RESTful API included in core.
I gave a *brief* overview of it at the DCPHP Conference a while back.

*  A great deal of the cruft in the system has been removed.  By
simply deleting code that was executing *but not doing anything*,
we've improved response times of certain screens by 50%... independent
of the permissions caching noted above.

*  In terms of general code cleanliness, we're in progress in actually
using the CakePHP coding standard to make sure things are all
readable.  I've also been working to remove all the extraneous bits of
PHP from the HTML.  We're no where near complete on either of these
pieces, but making things steadily better.


Next month I'll be giving a demo and overview of web2project... all
are welcome to attend the Northern Virginia Linux Users' Group (03
Jan), the DC PHP Users' Group (14 Jan), or the soon-to-be-announced
php|architect Webinar Series (mine is 23 Jan).

Thanks,
keith

Hi Nasir:

That could be the reason the site is slow.  It may be downloading fine 
but the browsers are choking on the rendering phase on the first page 
load because your HTML or style sheets are totally broken.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Captcha/Question
Message-ID: <20081224220136.TWZZ13791.hrndva-omta05.mail.rr.com@DeJaVu>

I see zencart moved from using a captcha to a security question.

 

They only have a finite number of questions like "What is the color of a
blue sky?"

 

Can't that be easily gotten around?

 

You can just read the security question from the page and program the
response for that question.

 

Thoughts on captchas and security questions?

Well, the answer is per user, so you would have to know their answer
to begin with, right?

Well, either or both combined shouldn't define your security policy.
For example, if you're running on a shared host, or non-SSL your
"security" is very limited.  What are you trying to protect against?
What is your concern?

With that said, I tend to like the multi-step process that involves both.

The purpose of the captchas and security question is to prevent automated
login attempts and automated password guessing.

Agreed.  I think there's a big market here for an open source project 
management solution.  I'd gladly provide hosting/svn, etc. if people 
wanted to get together and start one.?

Great!  I'll look at them, thanks!?

Hi!

Count me in for QA / tech writing (help / manual). I guess I am way better at 
that than the programming.
