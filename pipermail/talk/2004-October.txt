I figured i would ask this here since there is not much for
documentation i have found on the web.

When you create a socket connection in PHP, will it carry from page to
page or will you have to reconnect the socket everytime?

I was thinking of implementing an AOL IM from a web page that will
allow you to sign on and send IM's from the site, however i either
need to keep the main window open and figure out some way not to close
the socket until they click logoff and open all IM windows as new
windows.  Or i need to be ablet o have the connection stay between
page calls.

If anyone has any links that could be helpfull i would appreciate it,
all i have been able to find is this

You would have to have the socket remain open but Im not sure that is a 
good way .. the options I know of @ the moment:

aim:goim?screenname=screenname&message=Hi.+Are+you+there?

(Client already has aim protocol registered with Mozilla/IE)

http://simpleaim.sourceforge.net/

(You could do some funky javascript calls I beleive - not sure)

http://www.aim.com/developer.adp?aolp=

(Wait for whatever dev docs become available)

the aim:goim method you provided above just registers to be used with
AIM and opens the AIM window, i am thinking of implementing a 100%
totally web based version of this, similar to what aol.com has when
you sign in as an aol member.

You would have to reopen the socket on each page.

There are a few different possibilities, depending on the system you 
want to run it on.

In any case to do this through php you would most likely have to have a 
background server process running for each IM session (this can just be 
a php script), which would maintain the socket and do the actual 
communication.

Your frontend would then pass any user inputs to the server process and 
read the output for display.

One way to set this up would be to use proc_open 
(http://php.net/proc_open) to launch the server process with both its 
input and output redirected to files.  Then when someone sends an IM 
you send the command to the input file, the server process does the 
communication and it writes the result to the output file.

Your script to display the conversation just grabs output from the 
output file.

I haven't tried to build a system like this myself, but in theory I 
think it should work.

Another possibility is to use a database to communicate between the 
frontend and the server process, but it would probably be too slow for 
your purposes.

i would pick up on flash but i suck at graphic design and i already know PHP :)

so the only way to do something like this is to communicate to a
server process? i mean i cant have someone go to the site, login and
have the socket remain open such as this.

user goes to the site, logs in, that page doesnt change once they
login, when they click a user in thier userlist it opens a new window
via javascript that will allow them to send the message in some way.

That fine book is Trachtenburg's, not mine.  Though in Chapter 2 of 
"Advanced PHP Programming" I talk about DB wrapper classes.

I think Mitch is actually referring to that code in your book because
I don't remember talking about this in Chapter 2 of "Upgrading to PHP
5."

Ok, here's the details:

The Book:  Upgrading to PHP 5
The Author:  Adam Trachtenberg
The Chapter:  2, Object-Oriented Programming
The Bonehead:  Me

Page 22 has a rough outline of a class that could open connections if
needed, or reuse existing persistent connections if available.

Sheesh, and I hadn't even been drinking!

class Mitchy extends Bonehead;

Oh man.  The fact that I too was trying to come up with something like 
that proves that there's a strong demand among NYPHPers for a Dorkable 
interface in PEAR somewhere.   : )

if you can run a jabber server, try this. BTW, this uses http and must 
retain an open connection, so your average little server will only 
scale to a couple hundred users(big generalization).

Oh right! I forgot about that. There's also some stuff on page 28,
when I talk about static properties.

I don't have George's book, but believe he goes into a far more
in-depth than I did.

I have used X-Cart on a bunch of projects.  It is a beast but I like 
it.  Both implementations of X-Cart that I did this summer have included 
a lot of customization.  I normally completely re-skin it and then I 
modify for my clients needs.  I like all the features it comes with out 
of the box.  The re-skinning process can be tedious and there are some 
cross browser compatibility issues that need to be solved.  But I like.

It does have some draw backs, it can be slow and there are regular 
security updates.  If you customize it too much you will have to make 
the security updates manually.  Not fun.  By the way, I do not consider 
the updates the draw back, I consider the manual application of the 
patches a pain in the arse.   I know this does not answer your question 
about a cart that fits your criteria but I figured I would add my $0.02.

Support and the forums for X-Cart are very helpful.  I always find the 
answers I need in the forums and I have had some vexing problems.  So 
the short of it is that X-Cart has solved my client's ecommerce needs 
and I will continue to use it for a while.

If you have any x-cart questions you can contact me off-list and I am 
more then happy to answer them.

yes  that database class from Adam;s book was what I had in mind.
I even took it another step and used that static property technique 
within all classes which might use the database class.

So in effect, the class only requires() the database class and 
instantiates it if hasn't already. If instantiated, the database class 
only connects if it hasn't already.
I'm liking PHP 5 so much I wrote a Haiku.

Cascading Database
Requires one connection
Slash Dot here we come.

Just wish more web hosts upgraded to 5  and offered Postgresql. Guess 
it's just a matter of time.

You understand I meant using Jabber and a transport to access AOL's 
protocol.
Even so, you might be able to learn about the protocol from the open 
source AIMT transport project over at jabber.org.

It is, but some people have written transports for Jabber servers that 
communicate with other networks. You'll also find a number of open 
source PHP clients there.

See , we are back On Topic.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Returning from Includes 
Message-ID: <20041002023353.B3145@scruffy.atopia.net>

Hey all,

Just had a quick question.  I've got a system that currently runs that has a 
basic module file (module.main) which includes a couple files...

header.html, footer.html, and the current module file .... go.none is included 
if $go is NULL, action.none is included if $action is NULL .... if action is 
UpdateUserInfo and go is ManageUser then action.UpdateUserInfo and 
go.ManageUser is included ... and so on and so forth.

go.* is the text displayed to the screen and UpdateUserInfo is the include of 
the action that does updating, deleting, etc....

It all works great, except for when someone modifies the URL ... for instance, 
changing go from NULL to go equals "ManageUser" .... go.ManageUser requires a 
userID, which is hard to check for in go.ManageUser because it pushes all the 
code in ....

for instance:

File go.ManageUser

if (!empty($UserID))
{
 	echo "missing";
}
else
{
 	// 100 lines of code here ... indented... :-(
}

I could do something else like

if (!empty($UserID))
 	$errors = "Missing file";

if (empty($errors))
{
 	// 100 lines of code here
}


but that still does the indent ... so what i want to do is this:


if (empty($errors))
{
 	return; // return from the include
}

//rest of code here


I can't do an exit; because then it won't go back to the main "module" file and 
print footer.html, so the page will look messed up.  Will that single return 
work though?  What if I wanted to do multiple layers?  I've tried this and I 
can't seem to get it working like i want it to.  Is there a better way?

Thanks :)

Why don't you check for the user id before you include the file?

if ("ManageUser" == $go)
{
     if (!empty($UserID)) include(go.ManageUser);
     else echo('User ID is missing');
}

Otherwise I sometimes make includes into functions. This allows me to 
break from the code at certain points as well as keep track of 
variables:

function largeIncludedProcess()
{
     global $action;
     global $UserID;
     etc.

     code, code, code

     $GLOBALS['result1'] = $result1;
     $GLOBALS['result2'] = $result2;
     etc.
}

If you're looking to do this so a user can be on a web browser looking at 
a page on a web host, it seems you're misunderstanding how the HTTP 
protocol works.

A web browser opens an HTTP request to a web server, asking it to return a 
specific page.  If the page in question is a script (such as PHP or Perl), 
the server tells the appropriate interpreter to run the script and 
generate the HTML.  The HTML is then passed to your web browser.  The 
transaction is finished and the connection closed.  Your browser then 
renders the HTML.

So, once your page request is fulfilled, there is no more connection 
between you and the server.  Therefore there is no way to maintain an 
interactive process like you want.

The only way to get this to work is with another protocol.  Java or 
Flash, among other things, can be used to do that.

that must be how AOL and ICQ do it then, they both have an online
version so that you can sign on to thier service.

Another thing i thought about was the possibility of creating a
php-gtk AIM application, this should be able to be done right?

well, like I said, you can keep the http connection  open. Not 
scalable, works on port 80 through firewalls, but will not work with a 
proxy since it will wait for the complete request and then forward it 
to the browser or client.
very similar to streaming over http.

Message-ID: <330532b604100217276bc928e@mail.gmail.com>

Thought this would spice things up on the list ;-)

Years ago, I asked a perl guru friend of mine what he used to connect
application objects and relational data.  Certain he would provide
insight, he replied that there was nothing to use, and he built his
own stuff for each and every project.

That did provide insight - that there was no easy solution ;-)

I then spent several years in Zopeland, living with this frightening
thing called Zope Object DataBase (ZODB).  Not mapping to relations,
this was a true object database.  This was really great, until you
needed to access it from outside Zope however...

I've just been pointed at Propel:

http://propel.phpdb.org/wiki/

Instead of a pure relational or object environment, Propel takes PHP
(5) objects and maps them to a relational schema.  This concept was
brought over from Java, and similar exist for just about all the other
application languages - so it is not a surprise to be coming to PHP.

Anyone at NYPHP have experience with this strange yet beautiful
environment?  Ease of use?  Performance?

Those who know me will expect this response:  I don't think it makes
sense :)

Not too mention a performance hit, the relational and objective models
don't mesh well in my opinion - they are really different animals.  In
fact, there are object-based databases, but they have had limited
success from my experience (again, though, I'm probably biased :)

That said, the propel implementation does look like a good one,
regardless of whether I think it's a good idea or not.  Seems like a
good presentation topic, too, if there's anyone who has found success
with it :)

Actually, you CAN implement a chat client using only a web page.

Without going into to much detail, you have one frame which refreshes 
every 5 seconds or so to check if there are any new messages.
If there are it pushes the message to the chat window.

At one of my previous jobs I implemented the front end of such a beast 
using only apache, php, mysql and javascript.

The javascript was more complex then anything I thought I'd ever do :)

Looking at jabbix.com i see they seem to be doing the same thing more or 
less:
Q: Technically speaking, how does this service work?
A: Jabbix Messenger uses a combination of PHP+MySQL (on the server side) 
and XHTML+CSS+JavaScript (on the client side). The PHP back-end 
transmits commands to the browser in realtime, which are then executed 
using JavaScript to create an interactive interface without the use of 
plug-ins. On the server-side, Jabbix Messenger uses Jabber 
<http://www.jabber.org> technology to communicate with other Jabber 
servers and other third-party chat networks.

Another way is to use chunked transfer encoding, so that you just send a
chunk at a time. It's sort of the opposite approach, but it seems pretty
popular.

Hey, now that's pretty slick -- from the documentation there's
obviously some intelligent people working on that project. Check out
the code -- is it simple and straightforward? Does it look like code
you'd write, if you had the time?

I went down this road on my own a couple years ago -- defining schemas
outside of SQL, letting the code build the tables and worry about the
query details. I never actually got to the point where I implemented
SelectPeer( $obj ), though. Even though I could see the usefulness of
that, I didn't like being so out of control.

The problem comes when you start trying to do selects based on complex
criteria, as evidenced here:
http://propel.phpdb.org/docs/user_guide/chapters/FindingObjects.html#FindingRecods.Criteria

In my opinion, SQL is graceful compared to the code you have to write
to do create a complex Criteria object. At the end of the day, you
probably still need to know enough SQL to handle the edge cases, while
also knowing how to read the XML schemas and construct Criteria
objects.

That said, it-just-works object persistance is a real power tool, and
if you take this up seriously you'll probably never look back.

Yet ANOTHER way to do this is using Dynamic Javascript, which gets
dicey in some browsers (Safari) but otherwise works pretty well if you
know what you're doing.

1) script tag in <head> of the Document includes external.js
2) external.js rewrites part of the Document with new html content
3) external.js then issues a setTimeout for myrefresh()
4) myrefresh() uses the DOM to add another script tag to the <head> of
the Document
5) goto 1

When the browser sees that the new <script> has been added to the
<head>, it dutifully fetches and executes the script. Whether this is
a bug or a feature is still moot.

Jose,

Because I have a static main file, module.inc, which I can't modify.  
All that does is check to see if the include file exists, and if it 
does, it includes it.  All my other checks need to be done in the actual 
module include file ... which is why I wanted to include ANOTHER file at 
the top of that that does checks....

Wow you guys have told me several ways to do this, i think i need to
do some more learning as none of these methods is clear to me ;)

i think i just might have to learn javascript and what the DOM is ;)

any really good resources for learning these?

Jabbix was formerly an open source project called web messenger. I 
ported a version to postgres at one point.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/webmessenger/

But I believe I remember the main author saying he didn't poll the 
server with new HTTP requests, but kept the connection open, which is 
why it wouldn't work through a proxy. I have no idea how the current 
implementation works.

I want to store a class with data in it and have it accessable from
page to page - I would normally use sessions for normal data - but I
dont think I can store a class, because the class has to be defined
through the php scripts.

How would you guys go about doing this?

Depending on the complexity of the class you could go with serialization ...

What Jeff said, and the bottom line is: store the object in $_SESSION.
Just make sure you include the class definition before you call
session_start().

<?php
include_once('lib/myclass.php');
session_start();

if ( empty( $_SESSION['myobj'] ) ) {
  $myobj = new myclass;
  $_SESSION['myobj'] =& $myobj;
}
else {
  $myobj =& $_SESSION['myobj'];
}

// etc..

Thanks for the 'mad pr0pz' Jeff ;)

The biggest thing to remember when storing objects in the $_SESSION
array is that you must have the class definitions loaded before you try
to open the session.

In your main script you would want to have something like this:

<?php

include('myclass1.inc.php');
include('myclass2.inc.php');

session_start();

if (!isset($_SESSION['myobject1'])) {
   $_SESSION['myobject1'] = new myclass1();
}

if (!isset($_SESSION['myobject2'])) {
   $_SESSION['myobject2'] = new myclass2();
}

$_SESSION['myobject1']->foo();


This is potentially a topic for a phundamental, which could also cover
the use of the __autoload functionality in php5.

Has anyone here ever integrated FedEx shipping on a site before? A
client of mine has a site that i have been working on and they want
fedex integrated.  The client sent me the FedEx API but from the docs
in the API i am gathering that it is mainly for C/Java apps and not so
much for web based apps.  Is there a way to do this? There must be...
Fedex wouldnt be slacking that much.

I want to be able to use the functionality of headers_list() in PHP4 
formatting.  Upgrading is not an option in this case (it's the 
government, go figure).  I can't find anything online that comes up with 
a PHP 4.0+ variation to headers_list(), a PHP 5+ function.

Does anyone have anything like this for PHP 4.0+ or know where I can go?

Thanx

Dan,

this is nice but where i am stuck is with the API

This class is intended to be used with FedEx's Ship Manager Direct API
and can support all of its transactions.

i have scoured the FedEx site and all i can find is a c/java sdk and
code examples in ASP that say you need to install the windows API
etc.. if i could find a php compatable API i would have the web host
install the API for me so that i can get this done ;)

This has been one hell of a client and personally cant wait to get
this work done and get them out of my hair.

If you download the source and take a look at the README you will see that:

You don't need anything other than PHP with cURL support to use it.

Hi Joe,

We wrote and maintain this module (and the sister Perl version).  If you
need specific help, feel free to contact me off list.  FedEx contacted
us and requested that we remove the actual URIs so developers would
formally go through their implementation and registration process.

You're going to want to follow Dan Cech's idea using child processes for
each connection.  Essentially, in order for php to run as a socket client,
it has to run an eternal loop which consistently checks the socket and
maintains the connection.  As explained, by the time a browser sees a php
generated page, php has been finished and closed the script and sent the
output to apache (or whatever other http app) to send to you.

Flash would be one of the best ways to go, and actionscript 2 is a treat to
work with if you're an oo fan (although the flash ide is a failure - if you
get into it, find another app with as2 code hinting / highlighting).

Unfortunately, you're going to run into an issue using any client side
solution.  Flash, javascript, etc will need to connect directly to the aol
servers which could be a problem with firewalls and proxies.  If you run the
connections for the server, they have access form the browser over good ol
highway 80 and you can control the chat app and the access to / from it.

Here's what seems to be a great implementation of php sockets talking to
aol's servers: http://www.rsbauer.com/webdev/aimsocket.txt

I've gotten it to work once in the past while trying to learn how to
implement it myself, but it's been a while.

Good luck!

Guys can anyone explain why this is returning odd results?

function &getObject($class, $params=NULL) {
	if (!is_array($_SESSION['objects'])) {
		$_SESSION['objects'] = array();
	}

	if (!isset($_SESSION['objects'][$class])) {
		if (is_array($params)) {
                        // this is what is erroring
			$args = implode(", ", array_map("paramType", $params));
			echo $class.'('.$args.')';
			$_SESSION['objects'][$class] =& new $class($args);
		} elseif($params != NULL) {
			$_SESSION['objects'][$class] =& new $class(paramType($params));
		} else {
			$_SESSION['objects'][$class] =& new $class;
		}
	}

	return $_SESSION['objects'][$class];
}

function paramType($var) {
	if (is_string($var)) {
		return "'".$var."'";
	} else {
		return $var;
	}
}

when i call this

$dbParams = array(
	'server' => 'localhost',
	'database' => 'ipro2',
	'username' => 'root',
	'password' => '**********'
);

$db = &getObject('Mysql', $dbParams);
$db->connect();

it seems to take this, (which is the actual call in the getObject function
Mysql('localhost', 'database', 'user', '**********')
it seems that 
'localhost', 'database', 'user', '**********'
is being taken as one parameter, i am guessing because the getObject
function creates it as one string, my question is how can i get this
to think it is different arguments, i keep getting errors like this

mysql error: Unknown MySQL Server Host ''localhost', 'database',
'user', '**********'' (-1)

I absolutely agree. I've put quite a bit of time and thought into advanced
sql generators and object oriented database... er... gateways, wrappers,
whatever...

It all actually works really well for the basics.  The moment you get into
joins, relationships and complex criteria, things get mushy.  The objects
become obstacles and you find yourself writing pseudo sql in 8 functions
instead of a single sql sentence.

Sql is very powerful and has been around for quite some time because as ugly
as some may feel it is, it does the job well.

Nonetheless, propel seems to be very clean and well written, and I've been
reading good things about it on forums and lists for a couple months now.

Good luck!

Guys,

i know you can use a lon/lat database to search for things X miles
from a zip code, has anyone here ever had the challenge of marking an
address as the center of a radius and searching for other addresses
within 3 miles of that address?

i am asking because a potential client only delivers up to 3.5 miles
from his shop, however he has over 20,000 customers in that small
area.  Now have you ever heard of doing a search to find out if an
address is 3.5 miles from his shop address? the client checked with
mapquest and they want something like $35,000 a year to provide him
with this service.

Check this, it's under GNU GPL and there's a module for PHP, Perl and C.

Hope you get good bussiness.

This is another one for MySQL but it's still young.

Check out the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER files:
http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/. They're used primarily for GIS work,
but you can use the underlying .dbf files for streets. They contain address
ranges for every street in the U.S. So, a particular street segment record
would have something like name:Main St., left_from: 120, left_to 300, right
from: 121, right_to: 301.
In a GIS, you could pull out only those street segments within 3.5 miles of
your customer's address, then match queries against that limited set of
street segments.

don't have any experience with this yet, but have you looked into 
MySQL's GIS features

Richard,

Geocode seems to look like the best result since you can get the
lat/lon for a specific address, do you happen to know of any PHP
examples that use Geocode?  I have been looking over the C source and
i am able to sorta follow it but i am not the best with C.

Also anyone know where to find information about doing mile
calculations with lat/lon degree's?

Wow, Andy -- that TIGER/Line database is a great find! 

I kinda figured the Census Bureau made that stuff available, but I
didn't think I could just go there and download it. Better get a copy
before someone decides it's a Natl. Security Risk for us to know where
all the congressional district boundaries are located...

It's actually an incredibly rich data source. Great for GIS, but also useful
for stuff like proximity calculations for web apps, and the only free source
of such data on a nationwide level (that I know of). Some local governments
provide more up-to-date and therefore possibly more accurate street segments
and political boundaries, for example. Companies such as GDT and Navteq, I
believe, use this data, and collect additional data from hundreds of local
governments, polish it up and sell it for a premium.

Try this:

// Look up the original (Center of radius) in the zip table (Schema 
below)
         $query = "SELECT longw, latn FROM zips WHERE zipcode = '$zip'";
         $zip = $db->query($query);

  // Assign the longitude & latitude variables.
         $orig_longw = deg2rad($zip_row->longw);
         $orig_latn = deg2rad($zip_row->latn);

// Set the radius of the zip search can be anything
$radius = 100;

// Find all zips in a given radius
  $sql = "SELECT *, (3956 * (2 * atan2(sqrt((pow((sin(((((2*PI())/360) * 
latn) - $orig_latn)/2)),2) + cos($orig_latn) * cos((((2*PI())/360) * 
latn)) * pow((sin(((((2*PI())/360) * longw) - $orig_longw)/2)),2))), 
sqrt(1-(pow((sin(((((2*PI())/360) * latn) - $orig_latn)/2)),2) + 
cos($orig_latn) * cos((((2*PI())/360) * latn)) * 
pow((sin(((((2*PI())/360) * longw) - $orig_longw)/2)),2)))))) as 
distance FROM zips HAVING distance < $radius ORDER BY distance";

$result = $db->query($sql);

This will return all the zips within a 100 mile radius, then you can do 
whatever you need with that array. It's pretty accurate.

The Zip Code table schema the query above searches is as follows:

CREATE TABLE `zips` (
   `city` varchar(28) NOT NULL default '',
   `state` char(2) NOT NULL default '',
   `zipcode` varchar(5) NOT NULL default '',
   `Area_Code` char(3) NOT NULL default '',
   `County_FIPS` varchar(5) NOT NULL default '',
   `county` varchar(25) NOT NULL default '',
   `Timezone` varchar(5) NOT NULL default '',
   `DST` enum('Y','N') NOT NULL default 'Y',
   `latn` double NOT NULL default '0',
   `longw` double NOT NULL default '0',
   `ZipCode_Type` enum('P','U','M') default NULL,
)

Jeff,

this is nice code but i was not looking for the distance between 2 zips...

i need to get the distance between 2 addresses within the same zipcode.

Today alone many people have given great input and i plan to do
something with this even if the client doesnt want this feature
anymore.  Even if it means i am doing it to just mess around to learn
about it.

I appreciate everyone's input and help

Check your PHP version. socket_create doesn't exist prior to 4.1.

Older version do have socket functionality, but you'll need to rewrite
the socket function to accomodate that.

There are older versions of the docs out there somewhere, but I don't
remember offhand where.

I meant your socket function, obviously, not the PHP one.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] databases, classes, and you
Message-ID: <330532b6041006084317adff19@mail.gmail.com>

Hi gang,

Here is another philosophical question:

When working with an existing database class, it is common to create a
separate class for all SQL (commonly called the SQL class or DML
class).  It is possible to just extend your database class and add all
the SQL/DML methods there, as opposed to creating a completely
separate class that defines all of your database calls.

What are the pros and cons of this approach?

For example, building a site using PEAR::DB, why not just extend the
DB class with the site-specific methods?  Or is it really different to
keep that logic in a separate SQL/DML class?  To me it appears that
you are basically getting the exact same thing in the end; but would
love to hear a spirited debate on this topic.

Perhaps this could be something worth writing up for the NYPHP site?

Discuss ;-)

I am making an offline version of php application that I have on the web.

The client will take the software offline, save data to an offline Oracle
Lite database, and then sync the data back online at a later date. I am
trying to determine the best way to perform remore procedure calls and
transmit large amounts of data back to the online database.

I have been looking at XML-RPC and SOAP which seem like good solutions for
remote procedure calls, but not necessarily for transmitting large amounts
of data. Does anyone have any suggestions on this?

SOAP supports file attachments, so your application could attach a
compressed file containing your data. Might make more sense than sending a
huge amount of XML.

Message-ID: <8d9a428004100612275811627@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone here have any experience with news servers and storage space?

i am thinking of setting up a server that will run a news server and
another on the same network that will host a website that will allow
people to read/post newsgroup messages.  I thought about scratching
out the idea of running a news server but after playing with php and
noticing how long it would take for php to query the remote news
server and update all of the messages i dont think it can be done
logically with php.

I am talking about having 1 server but maybe upwards of 10,000 groups
that could have upwards of 1 million messages each so retrieving them
with php would take forever, i have also thought of making a c/c++
program to run on a cron to update the database with the new messages
on the server but that would lead to a lot of space needed.

I guess my question is, how much storage space do you think i would
need to do this? i hate to have to duplicate messages etc... by
storing them on yet another news server but i dont think there is a
way around this without it taking forever to get the messages.

This is typically the approach I take - I have a base class that I use
a lot - written during the Amsterdam conference ;)

And I extened for more complex queries - I assumed it was out of my
own lazines because I never coded my base class to be fancy enough to
handle complex queries, but from what I'm seeing recently (and was the
case with the original app) - I found that the more specific the base
class is, the less useful it is because it can never properly handle
nuances.

There is a USENET HowTo out there that tells you exactly what you need
and how to go about setting it up.

If I remember correctly, it also cautions that only large ISPs have
the bandwidth and storage to handle a useful collection of newsgroups,
but I suspect that was just there to scare off the hobbyists.

That really depends on what you consider "a useful collection".
I worked at an ISP a while back and the newgroups servers were real 
monsters, not to mention bandwidth which was enormous.
I don't remember the exact numbers but I do remember that the sys admins 
were constantly discussing how much to keep, what groups and how far 
back, because of bandwidth and storage usage.

If you just want to keep just comp.lang.php you'll be fine.
If you want to keep alt.*   .... well, you get the picture.

Frankly, if you want to keep a few of your own newsgroups then its fine 
but to run a full news server is a major committment - much better to 
outsource all that to people like Giganews.

Although not available (at least, I don't believe so) with Oracle Lite,
this seems best handled by database replication.  For instance, you
could have a local MySQL server running, then when it comes online, it
would replicate and automatically synchronize with the central database.
I know of several cases (for instance, embedded databases on trains that
sync with a central database wirelessly when they are at the station).

These would work work, but depending on how large your data is, it might
become inefficient.  Another option might be to just use some type of
FTP or SFTP process to move the actual data, then import it on the
central database side.

I know you know Shell Script, you're all LAMP demigods out there, so I'm 
not surprised you dream in Shell Script as well.  In any case, I need 
some help with a very simple function I wrote for a command-line 
PHP-based application program migrator I wrote:

# SYNTAX: delete_tar $folderPath $origFolderName $today
delete_tar()
{
 echo "Are you sure you want to delete TAR file ""$1/${2}_${3}.tar.gz""? 
(Y/N Enter = N) "; read isOKDelete
 if [ $isOKDelete = "Y" -o $isOKDelete = "y" ]; then
  rm $1/${2}_${3}.tar.gz
 fi
}

------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------

I  continually get the "too many arguments" error on the "if" line if I 
do not enter either "Y" or "y".

[Quote]
/home/me/scripts/icatalog_unpackager.sh: [: too many arguments
[me at www me]$
[/Quote]

As dumb as this is going to sound, how must I do this correctly?  I have 
already gone to Linux Shell Script tutorials and apparently am not 
grasping this.

Thanx

Hmm.. interesting, considering that was what I was taught to use as the 
"or" comparator in Shell Script (see 
http://www.freeos.com/guides/lsst/ch03sec02.html* )

*I know you also can use "||" (which I've always understand as "or") but 
only between blocked expressions and not within one.

Try this:
# SYNTAX: delete_tar $folderPath $origFolderName $today
 delete_tar()
 {
  echo "Are you sure you want to delete TAR file ""$1/${2}_${3}.tar.gz""? 
 (Y/N Enter = N) "; read isOKDelete
  if [[ "$isOKDelete" = "Y" -o "$isOKDelete" = "y" ]]; then
   rm $1/${2}_${3}.tar.gz
  fi
 }

If that does not work, then let me know and I will come up with something
better.

BTW, the double [[ ... ]] uses the shell built in test command. What you where
trying to use would call the external UNIX test command.

Also instead of using echo, you can use print which is built into the shell
language.

Disclaimer: The above recommendations should work under ksh and I believe most
shells are enhancements to the ksh. (Although I could be wrong since I only
work in ksh anyways)

I'm sorry but it didn't work, off-the-bat syntax error:

/home/me/scripts/icatalog_unpackager.sh: line 21: syntax error in 
conditional expression
/home/me/scripts/icatalog_unpackager.sh: line 21: syntax error near 
unexpected token `-o'
/home/me/scripts/icatalog_unpackager.sh: line 21: ` if [[ "$isOKDelete" 
= "Y" -o "$isOKDelete" = "y" ]]; then'

I've never heard of "[[  ]]" before, simply because I was taught to use 
Shell Script with as much of the external UNIX capabilities as possible 
and as little built-in shell, if that makes sense.

I always use the '||' for OR

if [ ${isOKDelete} = "Y" ] || [ ${isOKDelete} = "y" ]

You can always use the case statement

case $i in
	     -[Yy])     *...*
	esac

Good luck,

Nestor :-)

Everyone's favorite topic!  :)

So we all know that PHP 5 doesn't have multi-inheritance, which is fine.
The natural answer is, "it has interfaces!"

So great... but really, how does that help all that much?  I've seen
this:

http://www.sitepoint.com/article/dual-inheritance-classes-php

But that's just wrong (he's basically rewriting source files on the
fly).

So really, how do interfaces provide a means for MH?  As I understand
it, PHP support isn't quite like Java, so the way they do it doesn't
seem possible.  What am I missing here?

Thanks,

H

They don't in the C++ way that you seem to be expecting. You cannot
have a child class inherit methods from multiple parents.

Instead, interfaces allow you to create a way to require a class to
implement a series of methods. Since you know they class must
implement foo() and bar(), then you know you can invoke them, just as
if the class extended a parent that implemented foo() and bar().

Alternatively, you can use __call() to aggregate a second class inside
the child class. Inside of __call(), you can embed logic to determine
how the methods are dispatched.

This is a pretty unfair response.

A frequent abuser of this list sends yet another completely off-topic
email, and Dan makes a funny Strongbad reference. Seems pretty "light" to
me. Not only did it make me laugh, but it provided a gentle reminder that
this list should not be abused in this way. Everyone should delete these
types of off-topic emails, because answering the question only ancourages
further abuse.

I would just ban the frequent abusers, but as George often says, "maybe
I'm just cranky."

Correct me if I'm wrong (as you will!), but Interface definitions
can't contain code. You're specifying method names, but not actually
defining those methods.

So how can you inherit from them? 

As far as I'm concerned, Interfaces are a pre-production tool for
large or distributed projects. A lead developer writes the Interface
definitions, then directs the coders to write Classes that implement
those Interfaces.

I don't see the utility for smaller or single developer projects,
unless there is a code repository (!!!) somewhere that has a
collection of extremely-well-written standard interfaces.

I would add that signal is easily more deserving of slack than the
noise which always seems to get it. By his frequent valuable posts to
this list, Dan has earned the right to such a remark.

Let's not go down this road again folks... I'm going to kill this thread
right here and now.

If people feel changes are needed in what's acceptable to post and
what's not, please subscribe to the NYPHP-Org list
(http://nyphp.org/lists) and we'll discuss there.

If anyone isn't sure of our posting policies in the past, check the list
archives or subscribe to the NYPHP-Org list and ask.  At the end of the
day, our policy has been "if it's a well formed technical question, it's
ok."  If that's not a good policy, we've been asking for someone to
write one.

Hi,

Try the following:

#SYNTAX: delete_tar $folderPath $origFolderName $today
delete_tar()
{
 echo "Are you sure you want to delete TAR file '${1}/${2}_${3}.tar.gz'?
(Y/N Enter = N) "; 
read isOKDelete

if [ "${isOKDelete}" = "Y" -o "${isOKDelete}" = "y" ]; then
 rm ${1}/${2}_${3}.tar.gz
fi
}

What I changed:

- in the test statement, variables are surrounded by double quotes.
That is because if the variable is empty (user pressed Enter for N),
it will not be passed onto the test statement. Surrounding it with
quotes will make sure that if the variable is empty, an empty string
is passed on to the test.

- [[ ... ]]   :  The only shell I've seen using this syntax for test
is KSH. So you should have specified which shell you are using.

Hi,
 
   How can I escape these characters in the sql where clause. 
 
Select * from table1 where name like 'John smith*'.
 
The * is part of the name itself.

Depending on the SQL server you're using, an asterisk '*' isn't
generally a special character in SQL.  That said, you can always escape
characters with a blackslash, '\'

% and _ are wildcard characters in LIKE predicates, not *.

Now, the trick is how to escape THOSE. :)  Here's what the SQL-99 
standard says:

    select * from foo where cf like 'a^%%' escape '^'

You can pick any character you want for the escape.

It works for most DBMS's, though don't try it with SQLite.

What a weird subject line. Is it an OOP or procedural question?

What I mean is. . .

Well, suppose you have a User class and  a register() function in the 
class.

Then on a given script/page you are looping through some values and you 
want to create a new User and register it every time through the loop.
Of course it doesn't work because you can't do something like:

$name = new User;

more than once.

1) Do most people use dynamically named variables?

2)I had a couple beers so I can't think of the other solutions I had 
earlier today.

This is probably just a result of bad program design, but I'm having 
trouble wrapping my mind around it.

Message-ID: <C3B89F80-1995-11D9-BF62-000A95AF225A@email.smith.edu>

I'm having trouble getting sessions to work on a new server.  At this 
point I have tried to back my code down to the simplest use of sessions 
that I can think of, but still to no avail.  My hosting company hasn't 
been much help to date.  I'm wondering if the following code should 
work?  (The server is running PHP 4.3.6.)

first page:

session_start();
$_SESSION['user'] = "Frank";
header("Location: full_url.php");

second page:

session_start();
echo $_SESSION['user'];

also later on in this page:
<pre><? print_r($_SESSION); ?></pre>

The output produces nothing reflected from the echo statement and the 
print_r produces an empty array:
Array
(
)

I'd appreciate any tips or pointers.  I use sessions a lot on my usual 
server so I'm at a loss as to why the same code isn't working on the 
new one.

Thanks,

-Aaron

I did check the session settings, basically to see that session support 
was enabled.  To be honest, beyond that I'm not sure what to look for.  
The reference book that I am using doesn't get very deep into sessions.

I just checked session.save_path and it's set to \tmp.

Does that work on your operating system?  Needs to be /tmp on most 
unices.

Crap.  So much for low-lying fruit!

Hmm, can you tell us what all of your session_* settings are?

Also, some hosting companies can use some pretty strict settings for
shared servers.  I would look into any docs/lists from your host to
see if they may be restricting your PHP configuration.

I posted the session settings:
http://www.fswebworks.com/laraza/session_settings.pdf

I've poked through the areas of my control panel that pertain to php.  
I'll poke around my host's website.

BTW, I'm using phpwebhosting.com as a host.  Thought that might be 
helpful to mention if others have used or are using and ran into 
similar obstacles.

That's an incorrect use of the Location header - it requires an absolute
URL, not a relative one. This misuse has been known to cause problems with
certain browsers where cookies are not included in the request for the new
URL. This might be your problem.

When debugging these types of problems, it's usually best to assume that
PHP is not making an error. :-) How could it - PHP is perfect! Just
kidding, but it is the least likely source of the problem.

What is the problem then? Well, 9 times out of 10, it's that the browser
doesn't properly identify itself. The best way to determine this is to
dump both the $_GET and $_COOKIE superglobals. I have a feeling this will
reveal the problem, and it might be the improper use of the Location
header that is causing it.

Hope that helps.

I actually am using an absolute URL with the location header.  
full_url.php was my analogy for the actual URL.  Sorry for the 
confusion.

$_GET reveals an empty array.
$_COOKIE reveals:
[PHPSESSID] => d53035174762f0fc192a1c3d3bd60067

Actually, this will work just fine.

> 1) Do most people use dynamically named variables?

Very rarely, it's generally clearer to use an array if you want to keep 
the variable for later, or just unset/reuse it.

ie:

$users = array();
foreach ($signups as $id => $signup) {
   $users[$id] = new User();
   $users[$id]->register();
}

or:

foreach ($signups as $signup) {
   $user = new User();
   $user->register();
   unset($user);
}

the call to unset is optional, if you leave it out the variable $user 
will be overwritten on each iteration through the loop.

At the risk of this being a security issue, can you create a simple page 
with <? phpinfo() ?> so we can see all of the server settings ?

I just discovered that the sessions are functioning as expected when I 
test with Internet Explorer.  They are not functioning when I test with 
Mozilla (Firefox) and Safari.  I typically use Safari and have never 
run into this problem before.

So, it appears that the problem is browser specific...

Right... interfaces just declare the methods that a implementing class must
define.

Many call it a solution for multiple inheritance, but really it is an
alternative that doesn't achieve exactly the same thing...  but they are really
really useful!

Interfaces aren't JUST for that.  They can be useful for creating an API that
will be guaranteed to be implemented.  Think of it as a contract between the
caller and called code.  If two pieces of code can expect each other to
implement particular interfaces, they in theory should be able to inter-operate
without changes.

Consider the the SPL API in PHP 5... it defines a collection of very useful
interfaces that will allow code to operate on your custom classes seamlessly
provided they implement the interfaces.  Right now it is limited to just
Iterators, but eventually I'm sure we will have more and more standard
interfaces in PHP that will help inter-operation between various libraries and
applications, or just simply standard methods for doing the same thing.  For
instance, nearly every OO database abstraction layer I've used in PHP operates
differently.  If they all implemented the Iterator, at least I could loop over
results the same way.

C++ has the STL. Java has all kinds of standard interfaces... Collections,
JDBC, JAX, JAAS, JSP, etc...  the list goes on and on.  What Java has
accomplished with these collections of interfaces are common APIs that allow
multiple implementations of the same API to be swapped in and out for each
other.  It gives you plugin-like functionality because they emerge out of
common patterns in coding.  It isn't necessary to do things the same across
multiple code bases, but it helps interoperability if you do.

Consider the following example of a single developer taking advantage of this
in Java.  There is an array of items that to date was static in memory, and
they're stored in a List java object.  Since a List is an interface and it
can't be instantiated, the ArrayList implementation is used because it offers
constant random access time, it's low-overhead, BUT it doesn't offer constant
time to add or delete many items to it.  But now, this list has become dynamic
in memory and the performance is sub-optimal.  The implementation class can
easily be swapped out for the LinkedList implementation of the List interface
which is optimal in this situation because it offers constant time for adding
and removing elements from the list, however, it offers poor random access
time.  So the change is simply what class gets instantiated... which can
actually be decided by a configuration/properties file or even dynamically at
runtime.

I'd suspect that most PHP developers aren't concerned about things like this
but increasingly there are many that are... maybe because their applications
demand such behavior or their business requirements dictated this.  As PHP
grows-up and becomes adopted in enterprise (eek, i said that word) applications
more and more, there will be a need for more and more interfaces.  Hopefully
these interfaces will be made public and standard, and not kept internally.
Individual developers will reap the benefits of them because of well-documented
and standard APIs that allow for easy integration of external libraries or
applications into their own.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] php mysql question
Message-ID: <200410091410.30969.henry@beewh.com>

hello people:

i was wondering if someone tell me if this is possible...

i have this:

$q = 'select * from users';
$result = mysql_query($q);

There's no problem with that. I want to know if i can do this:
	$newresult = $result;

I want to run the query once, but use the result set again. Whenever i do 
this, $newresult is empty, for example when i place it in:
	while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($newresult)){
		
	}

Can someone tell me the right way of doing this. I don't want to query the 
database more than once.

Thank you,
Henry

Tried out session_write_close, it didn't change anything.

Sessions are working in IE but not Safari or Mozilla.

Fair enough. But say you have this situation.

function doSomething() {
$obj = new object;
$obj-> doing something
other things happening
$obj->destruct;
}

what happens if the script calls doSomething a second time before $obj 
is done. Am I in some danger of overwriting $obj before I'm through 
using the previous instance?
if not, Is the same true if the instantiation happens outside of a 
function?

I guess the distilled question is:

When the engine instantiates a new object, is the memory allocated to 
that object unique, both from within a given script and across multiple 
scripts, if indeed that object is passed around an application?

I've seen this suggested before (using session_write_close()), and I've
never understood it. It's possible that I'm just missing something, but
the header() function never terminates the script, and PHP always writes
session data once the script ends.

Has anyone ever actually seen the user of header() result in the session
data not being written? I'd be very interested in knowing whether there is
some fringe case or bug that prompted this suggestion. I used to do this
myself, until I actually thought about it for a minute and couldn't figure
out why it made any sense. :-)

not at all when you create a new instance it is just that a new
instance if you do
$obj1 = new user();
$obj2 = new user();

they have nothing to do with eachother except that they are of type User

If you want to do something along the lines of mysql_num_rows($result)
then do mysql_fetch_array($result) I don't believe that queries it
twice, and its the same data.

Brian:

i know this.... and i have no problems doing mysql_num_rows($result) and then 
mysql_fetch_array($result).

My problem is that i want to query the database once. 

I want to be able to reuse the $result in as many mysql_fetch_array($result) 
as i want. Or i want to know if i can copy $result to another variable(s), 
and then do mysql_fetch_array() or mysql_num_rows() or any other possible 
function on the new variable(s).

My question is on how to handle this.

Thanx,
Henry

Session data not written due to segfault? 

Is there a manual way to cause a PHP script to terminate unexpectedly,
so that sessions aren't written and resources aren't released?

I was just giving those two commands as an example, and my answer was
yes I believe you can and no I don't believe it queries more than
once.  What I believe happens is $result gets set, it then has the
data from the query, and that's what is in the variable.  You can use
the data however you want from there and I don't believe it queries it
again everytime you wish to extract the data from it.

Message-ID: <20041009202149.GI3559@leitz.earthlink.net>

Ever the newbie...

I have some forms that submit stuff into a database. The "entry" form calls the "insert" form, and then the "insert" form echos "Done". Inelegant, and certainly a pain to my users who will have to click "back" everytime they want to insert more than one entry.

Is there a good way to have the "submit" action do the submit and then go back to the "Entry" form?

ciao!

Hey Leam,

An easy way to do this is to check at the top of your script if the
form has been submitted yet - and if not, then render the form.  So
for example a login form with login and password fields:

<?php
if( $_POST['login'] ){
  // insert data into database and so on
} else {
  // output the form here
}
?>

Of course a much better way to handle it would be to just use
HTML_QuickForm from pear.php.net, as it also has a bunch of handy
routines to validate form input, sanitize data, and so on.

Do take a look, it could save you a lot of time ;-)

Hello, you can do something similar to this.

I would use one form.
================================
<?
if (isset($_POST["insert_button"])){
	// 1. do all you need to insert to the database
	// 2. you can create messages that are contained in some variable.
	// for example $message
}
if (isset($message)){
	echo $message;
}
?>
<form name="insert_form" action="" method="post">
<?
// all the form elements
?>
	<input type="submit" name="insert_button" value="Insert">
</form>
===============================================
Basically, if $_POST["insert_button"] isn't set then this means that there is 
no need to insert in the database, otherwise the form elements can be 
inserted.

I hope you understand this. It's easy.

Henry

I have a feeling you want to be using mysql_data_seek($result, 0).  Don't 
copy the result resource.

Interesting that it works with one browser and not the other.

But wouldn't it be the case that the user has already been redirected to 
a different page before the script has terminated? That is, when the 
code is:

header('Location: otherpage.php');
exit;

Nope, because until the script terminates, no response is sent. The
header() function only sets an HTTP header within the response, although
Location is a special header in which case PHP also changes the response
status code.

The browser requests the new URL (which should be specified in the
Location header using an absolute URL) once it receives the response, but
prior to that, it has no idea that it's coming.

So, I've been wondering if this suggestion to use session_write_close()
came about because of this misunderstanding about how the header()
function works or something. That's my only guess, unless there is a
special case that I'm unaware of.

Thanks for the link, and great discussion guys... interesting stuff.

Not being a huge OOP fan myself, I haven't dived too deeply into this
stuff.  After cursory reading about these topics over the years,
interfaces were always pitched as the elegant answer to multiple
inheritance.

However, in both the Java and PHP worlds, I'm tending to think there is
a common misnomer about interfaces and multiple inheritance.  When
defining multiple inheritance to mean inheriting functionality, it
simply doesn't exist, and interfaces don't help.

This is a good link:

http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2001/jw-0907-java101.html

In the "The power of the interface" subsection, the author states:

"Interfaces don't just provide a workaround to Java's lack of support
for multiple implementation inheritance."

This just isn't true, to me.  They aren't a workaround.  Without
inheriting functionality (implementation), they are a completely
different animal, providing only syntactic inheritance, as stated in the
next sentence:

"Interfaces factor out commonality across diverse class hierarchies,
resulting in compact and understandable source code."

It's all about the source code, not the functionality, to put it
bluntly.

So, while interfaces certainly have their place, and I know the
complications that true (C++) multiple inheritance can add, something in
the middle would be nice, in both Java and PHP.

Thanks Henry, that did the trick. Well, it took me a bit to grasp; I'm easily lost on some things. But the form does work and resets it self *and* enters stuff into the database.

I'd take a look at the HTTP headers being sent back and forth.
I'd put my money on something being different from IE to the other browsers.

I don't know what your options are for Firefox and Safari, but with IE i 
use ieHTTPHeaders to see what's going on:

For Firefox, you can use LiveHTTPHeaders:

http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/

My only complaint about this plugin is that I can't figure out how to
examine the content of the HTTP messages. I'm glad it only logs headers by
default, but sometimes I want to see everything. Does anyone know how to
do this?

For Safari, I'm not aware of any good options. I hesitate to mention this,
because it's such a hack, but I did write something in PHP several years
ago to address this problem called Protoscope:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/protoscope/

Hopefully it still works. I haven't touched it in a few years. :-)
Basically, it's an HTTP proxy, so it's not a Web script at all. You run it
from the command line (some people have figured out how to run it on
Windows, and one guy sent me a document that I posted at
http://shiflett.org/docs/protoscope/windows), and then you setup your
browser to use it as an HTTP proxy, just as you would any other.

If it works correctly, it embeds the HTTP request and response into the
response. I'm sure that sounds confusing, but basically you can scroll to
the bottom of any page and see what the HTTP transaction for that page
looks like. It was pretty handy when it worked, and before there were
better options. I may try to hack on it again sometime and make it at
least stable. :-)

Hope that helps.

Chris

I haven't used this, but it appears to be similar to the proxy you 
describe (but it's written in python). It's GPL circa 04/2004

This would seem to bring us back to a browser-specific issue.

One way to do this would be to allow the creation of new methods at runtime. 

Which you can, using the PECL extension ClassKit, *not bundled with PHP*:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.classkit.php

ClassKit gives you:
bool classkit_method_copy ( string dClass, string dMethod, string
sClass [, string sMethod])

I have a lot of questions about this (as only just discovered it), but
it looks like a path to multiple inheritance. You could either make
these calls manually, inheriting just the methods you want, or write a
function that automatically merges one or more complete classes into
another class.

In general, I believe the whole point of interfaces over MI is that MI
is evil, so you shouldn't try to route around the language or you'll
end up shooting yourself in the foot.

MI may be evil, but so is Flash and people still manage to use it for
good every now and then.

That said, here's a demo of how to accomplish a limited multiple
inheritance using the ClassKit extension:

<?php
class lucy {
  public $isLucy = TRUE;
}

class charlie extends lucy {
  public $isCharlie = "Good grief!";
}

class football {
  function kickBall() {
    if ( isset( $this->isLucy ) ) print "You missed!";
    else print "Good kick!";
  }
}

// give charlie the football
classkit_method_copy ( "charlie", "kickBall", "football" );

// charlie now extends lucy AND football

$chuck = new charlie;
print $chuck->kickBall();
?>

Verified using PHP 5.0.1 on OSX.

I have found this stuff about MI (multiple inheritance) being evil 
many times to be asserted by Java zealots, who similarly decry 
'pointer arithmetic' in C++. 

'classkit_method_copy' looks to me like self-modifying code -- 
something which arguably has more potential for mishaps than MI 
(or pointer arithmetic for that matter).

What output did you get?

This looks to me like you have dynamically 
implemented an interface -- and so have 
gained only what interfaces give you. 

Something which could have been written like:

interface IkickBall
{
  public function kickBall();
}

class charlie extends lucy 
      implements IkickBall { 

  public $isCharlie = "Good grief!";

  function kickBall() {
    if ( isset( $this->isLucy ) ) print "You missed!";
    else print "Good kick!";
  }

}

(I could very easily be missing the point here)

The example was simplistic of course.

Let's say football::kickBall() is a complex method that needs to be
updated every time some external API changes (welcome to the world of
.NET, right?).

You have fifteeen diverse classes that you want to add kickBall()
functionality to.

Unless you want to copy-and-paste through fifteen source files every
time the damn football API changes, you have to jump through some kind
of hoop:

1) you refactor all of your classes to extend the football class
2) you implement football::kickBall() as a static method
3) you use classkit_method_copy()

The classkit solution is the least portable right now, but it also
seems the most useful if you don't want to (or can't; think PEAR)
rewrite your classes.

4) you can use the delegation pattern and delegate that method to the 
class that implements it.  I don't see any real benefit for using 
classkit() for this.  When using it to emulate multiple inheritance, 
you lose all the is_a() information on a class, which is one of the 
major benefits of inheritance over delegation.

Well, the I in API stands for Interface. 
It doesn't matter if the method underneath is simple 
or complex (hopefully the complexity/simplicity of how things 
get done is hidden).

If the API you are using keeps changing, perhaps its time 
to shop around for a better thought-out framework.

Does the .NET API really change that often -- 
I don't really keep close tabs on what's happening 
with it. But Microsoft developers in the past have 
avoided changes to the MFC API like the plague -- 
if for no other reason than to avoid admitting that 
the framework wasn't too well thought-out -- so I 
would assume the NET developers would follow suit 
and avoid changes to the NET API unless things get 
pretty drastic.

(As an interesting footnote concerning the 
the 'though-out-ed-ness' of the NET API, many 
developers laugh at the fact that the C# spelling 
of 'Icloneable' is uncomfortably close to the spelling 
of the Java interface 'Cloneable', which probably 
should be spelled 'Clonable' -- somebody may have 
copied JINI's (instead of Jimmy's) homework)

Couldn't you just require a file which implements the 
interface function (in this case 'kickball')? That way no 
matter how many classes depend on it, they would all get
the latest and the greatest.

Ah, so:

class charlie {
  function kickBall() {
    $f = new football();
    return $f->kickBall( $this );
  }
}

That's a better option, I agree.

No, it doesnot. It says incorrect syntax near escape. * does not work with '-" but not with like.  
 
I have lot of characters '+' , '++' in the name that I am comparing in the where clause. Every time I run mssql_query with those names, I get an error. Is there anyway I can handle these.
 
Thanks,

Hi all,

I have only been scanning this list on some days, so I hope no one has 
mentioned this yet.

I was planning to buy HTTP Interceptor from Siliconwold:
http://www.siliconwold.com/

I tried it out and it seemed quite good. I need it when I was madly 
debugging an issue where my XUL Fortune Cookie thing was not working on 
very recent versions of PHP 4.3.x ( greater than 4.3.4, I think). (I 
eventually figured out with the help of this program that the issue 
seems to lie with a newer version of the PEAR XML-RPC library which is 
bundled with PHP 4.3.4+. This version does not "play nice" with the 
JavaScript client XML-RPC library. I have a brief write-up on that here, 
in case any one is interested: http://moztips.com/index.php?id=360 . I 
planned to put together a detailed debugging tutorial with a conclusion 
stating where the problem lay; I gathered all the necessary scraps of 
information, but my brain bluescreened before I finished putting those 
scraps together. For those of you still waiting for the source from my 
NYPHP presentation: I have not forgotten, and sorry for the delay. I 
will publish a document on why this incompatibility issue is occuring, 
and steps to resolve it - which I still have to work out myself.)

In any case, I should conclude with this statement:
I wanted to write my own proxy thing, and I plan to take a look at Chris 
Shiflett's Protoscope script. In the mean time, I might just buy HTTP 
Interceptor, so that I have something to work with before my own thing 
is ready.

I should also state that I tried another shareware program which worked 
differently from HTTP Interceptor. You have to configure HTTP 
Interceptor as a proxy HTTP server in your browser. This other program 
tried to automatically monitor and log all HTTP traffic by hooking into 
what Windows was receiving and sending. I do not find this system to be 
good; I should also mention, that this other program torpedoed my 
computer, and I had to resort to a safe-mode rescue attempt to bring it 
back to a working state.

(I keep trying to end this email, but then I think of more things I want 
to say ...)

In debugging web services programs, I found this techique to be useful. 
Suppose I am posting to a remote PHP script which acts as an XML-RPC 
server. I want to monitor what it is sending back to the XML-RPC client. 
I do the following: I use print_r() or var_dump() or echo to output an 
array or variable's contents, then I use PHP's output buffering to save 
that outputted debug info to another array or variable. Then I use 
PEAR's excellent logging library ( http://pear.php.net/package/Log ) to 
save that info to a log file. Then I use the client to communicate with 
the server, and look at the log file to see what the server tried to 
communicate back.

I hope that all made sense.

Best Regards,
- Jay

Jay -

Take a look at Charles ( http://www.xk72.com/charles/index.html ) which we
use extensively for Flash/XML integration debugging or the new .NET
Microsoft Fiddler ( http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/  ) to quickly
inspect headers.

Here's a list of other proxys of various repute:
http://www.manageability.org/blog/stuff/open-source-personal-proxy-servers-w
ritten-in-java/view

If you're on a Mac or Linux, Ethereal can't be beat for inspecting
everything that's going on behind the scenes.

Hope this is helpful to you.

You really need to be specific.  You finally mentioned you're using 
mssql.  That's imporant to know.  Now what's important to know is the 
exact query you're running.  I mean, how can we tell you what you're 
doing wrong if we don't know what you're doing? :)

Before telling us that, make sure you do some testing yourself.  
Break it down to a very simplistic level.  The query's WHERE clause 
should refer to only one field and the query should return only one 
column.  This way it's easy for us to read and test ourselves.

Then tell us the complete and exact error message that comes back.

I've been reading my Shiflett (HTTP Handbook, Chapter 13) on session
security and my Schlossnagle (Advanced PHP Programming, Chapter 13) and
this (possibly dumb) question is for....  Schlossnagle!

Do I read correctly that you don't suggest passing around a URL-token as a
sort of secondary client identification/anti-hijacking mechanism, and if
so, is that because you don't think it's really necessary, or not really
worth it, or some other reason?

Thanks much,

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.58.0410121453470.87792@emra.pair.com>


Anybody wanna help me figure this out? You say 'apachectl start' and it
says:

Syntax error on line 223 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_rewrite.so into server:
/usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_rewrite.so: undefined symbol: dbm_fetch

This is with Apache 1.3.31 and RedHat 9 (kernel 2.4.20-31.9).

I found a web page that talks about this very issue at
http://www.vttoth.com/rewrite.htm but I can't get the fix he suggests to
work for me. He says:

<<The problem, as it turns out, is that mod_rewrite.so is compiled
incorrectly. It should be linked with a dbm library but it isn't.

If you have an up-to-date set of Apache source files, you can easily solve
this problem by manually rerunning the last compilation step of this
module, using the correct options. When you execute make mod_rewrite.so in
the appropriate directory, it performs this final step:

gcc -shared -o mod_rewrite.so mod_rewrite.lo

Rerun gcc, this time adding a reference to the GNU gdbm library:

gcc -shared -o mod_rewrite.so mod_rewrite.lo -lgdbm

Next, copy the newly created mod_rewrite.so over to
/usr/local/apache/libexec or wherever your Apache module files are
located.>>

However, there's nothing called mod_rewrite.lo to be found on my system.
Maybe there's another step that was presumed self-evident that I'm
missing.

And I can't seem to 'make mod_rewrite.so' because "make: *** No rule to
make target `mod-rewrite.so'.  Stop." (which seems reasonable even w/ my
miniscule understanding of make)

In the meantime I have commented out "LoadModule rewrite_module..." in
httpd.conf and that works, but...

Many TIA, so I can start learning to use this oh-so-cool module.

I'm looking for a regular expression that matches all newlines, tabs,

works, but also removes the spaces which I want to keep.

I know '\r' and '\n' are the right seed but I can't seem to get them to 
work through the string (which make contain many newlines and line feeds).

For the next PHundamentals article, we are exploring best practices in

PHundamentals Question on Headers & Downloads

1) How should headers be used to force browsers to download specific 
types of files, including PDF, CSV, Word, Excel, and generic files?  Are 
different headers required for different browsers?  How can you ensure 
the correct file extension is maintained for downloaded files?  What 
issues are there with SSL? Our aim, as always, is to arrive at "best 
practices" so please be specific as to how your solution is the optimal 
solution.

I usually use something along the lines of:
    /(\r\n|\r|\n)/
which catches all variations (Unix, Mac, Windows).

I ~should~ reply off-list because I'm a mere demi-geek and tired of
publicly embarrassing myself, but <sigh /> .....

You might be able to use str_replace():

    $find = array(chr(10),"\n","\t");
    $replace = '';
    $string = str_replace($find,$replace,$string);

I have used this combination of headers with pretty good success:

Given an array containing the details of the file like:

$attach = array(
   'filename' => 'myfile.pdf',
   'mimetype' => 'application/pdf',
   'content'  => 'pdf here'
);

header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='. $attach['filename']);
header('Content-length: '. strlen($attach['content']));
header('Content-type: '. $attach['mimetype']);
echo $attach['content'];
exit;

The Content-Disposition header tells the browser to open the download 
dialog, and lets it know the correct filename/extension.

The Content-length header allows the browser to display a meaningful 
progress bar.

The Content-type header lets the browser correctly display an indication 
of the file type to the user (PDF,XLS,EXE etc).  In most browsers it 
will also influence the default action (open vs download).

For some files (pdf mostly) it can be a good idea to use a different 
Content-Disposition header, namely:

header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename='. $attach['filename']);

In most browsers this will result in the pdf file being opened within 
the browser window.

I have a bunch more information regarding the use of headers for cache 
control...but that wasn't what you were asking was it ;)

Did you just compile Apache from source?

What did your ./configure command look like?

Did you get errors during make?

can you load a PDF file integrated with your design or do you have to

Ummmm.... nothing fatal. I said make and make install and it seemed to
comply. But I didn't redirect the output of make to a file or anything so
I can't say if there were warnings or what. Want me to do it again and
post the output?

Dan,

If the cache control is relevant to the issue at hand - forcing browser 
downloads - then it would make sense to explore that too.

I'm not saying this is going to solve the problem, but unless you need
*everything* you could try:
make clean
./cofigure --enable-module=so --enable-module=rewrite  

...which would build rewrite as a static module. Simpler.

Oh, heavens no! But if you see anything suspicious involving libdbm or
somesuch, it could help you track down the problem.

Needs a helper application, new window.

Would be cool if it could be done though.

I know this isn't necessarily technical, but I figure pushing php benefits
us all.

http://blogs.phparch.com/mt/index.php?p=30

"    *  The basic idea is to build a war chest of marketing and business
resources that insiders and independent consultants can use to promote the
introduction and use of PHP in a company-be it large, medium or small.
    * I am interested in case studies that showcase how PHP solves problems,
lower costs of implementation and ownership and lives within the enterprise
    * I am particularly interested in how PHP was adopted and why,
especially if the company has a long tradition of taking advantage of
commercial software.
    * Do remember that these are marketing documents, not technical ones. As
such, you must be ready to write from a marketing and business point of
view, rather than a technical one.
    * Studies that showcase a particular product that your company
implements are ok, under two conditions: (1) the case study must focus on
the benefits of PHP, and not only your application and (2) your application
must be connected (as in "written in" or "written for") PHP."

Yeah, but that fires up an external helper application, which is not
consistent across all browsers IIRC.

I see what you mean.  In that case, sans native pdf support in all browsers,
it's just not going to happen.

I would think that anything can be embedded in a page with an iframe. Does

Hi

Anyone know if its possible to 'define' an array?

define(DEFINED_ARRAY,$my_array);

tried this

<?php

???$my_array = array('yaks','llamas','wombats');

???define("DEFINED_ARRAY","test");
???// assigning value
???${DEFINED_ARRAY} = $my_array;
???// getting value back
???echo ${DEFINED_ARRAY}[0];
????>

but no really what is wanted more like

echo DEFINED_ARRAY[0[;

Yes, it's not possible. Constants must be scalar.

Ethereal can also run on some Windows machines 
(XP and 2000 at least).

You can use it to read tcp/ip traces from other 
machines.

For example, it could be used on a desktop computer 
to read a tcp/ip trace from a VMS (mid-range) system 
running UCX 5.x (BSD-style sockets).

And let's also remember that NYPHP has asked for case studies in the
past so if anyone does have a good case, please let us know and we'll
include it on nyphp.org and our new AMPeers section (sort of like

Hey Group,

I have been doing more freelance stuff lately and wanted to know how
everyone handles their invoicing, support, and trouble tickets.

Is there any good open source apps out there? 

I recently had the pleasure of dealing with another developer who was
using the eSupport program to handle support-ticketing and I was very
impressed.  I do not do enough freelance work to justify the 250$
price tag however.  I would like something that has invoicing
integrated into the same system if such a beast exists out there.

What are all you folks using?

Tom,
I was using peachtree accounting, what hell that is, but a nice app for this.

however i recently made the move to linux and found GnuCash an OS app
that works good.

I havent decided if i am going to use GnuCash or install VmWare for Peachtree.

I've been wanting to write my own for quite some time now (as is the case
for this stack of personal projects toppling over my desk).

I was using QuickBooks for a while, which is very good if you don't mind the
fact that intuit hasn't updated their interface since 1990.  I do.

I tried MS Money for small business, and it's a complete waste of time.  The
interface is actually pretty nice, but their 'business' section is so weak,
you can't import or export to / from it and I'm just not a huge fan..

Otherwise, I'm still looking, both for a great all-around app (that has good
reports for tax time, recurring billing, past due reminders, good invoices,
etc - and syncing with my bank would be good as well), or at least for the
time to roll my own.

Thank you Chris.

I did make clean, ./configure per your suggestion, make and make install,
and it seemed to go fine. Apache was starting happily but mod_rewrite
still wasn't getting loaded. I played with my httpd.conf some more and
uncommented a pair of AddModule directives that I noticed I had forgotten
to uncomment.  Now it's all rocking, but I am not sure whether it's
because of the way we rebuilt Apache, or the edits to httpd.conf. I think
it might be the latter.

Still-a-bit-confused-but-happily yours,

	David

not exactly.

AMPeers is a collection of articles *written by users* on any topic likely 
to be of general interest to the community, long, short, or whatever, and 
published by us as a community service, without any editing beyond a simple 
"is this worth publishing?"  Final announcement of this project is awaiting 
resolution of some issues about the exact structure of the website, but you 
will hear something shortly.  So please start getting together your own 
submissions:  "How I do this" or "What I found out about that" or "Things 
to watch out for in whatever."

PHundamentals are articles *written by the PHundamentals team*, Jeff Siegel 
with some minor help from me, consolidating responses on Talk and elsewhere 
to questions about best practices in various areas.  One such question is 
live now:  best practice for headers for forcing downloads (see 
http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2004-October/012375.html ).

Hello Corey and others,

Sorry for the delayed response.
thank you for the good links. Fiddler looks excellent, and I am going to 
try it out. The other link seemed to be slightly broken.

I might not need to buy HTTP Interceptor after all.

I will also check out Ethereal for Windows as Tim (Gales) mentioned.
Best Regards,

I had @ one time thought of trying a crack at this app I found on
SourceForge once:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ebills/

I think my search dealt with "PDF Billing" stuff .. Looked pretty
interesting but like everything else got tied up with other stuff and never
looked back ..

If you do the same search you'll find some cool stuff.

Hey Group,

I have been doing more freelance stuff lately and wanted to know how
everyone handles their invoicing, support, and trouble tickets.

Is there any good open source apps out there? 

I recently had the pleasure of dealing with another developer who was using
the eSupport program to handle support-ticketing and I was very impressed.
I do not do enough freelance work to justify the 250$ price tag however.  I
would like something that has invoicing integrated into the same system if
such a beast exists out there.

What are all you folks using?

Maybe that'll be the next PHunny question on headers :)

Anyway, I've done much the same as Dan.

For instance, to force a download, even if a plugin for the file type
exists, this I think generally works:

header('Content-type: application/x-download');


And of course the disposition - we don't want a grumpy file...

header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$filesaveas");

Then spit the file out:

readfile($filepath);

This of course would be an echo for non-filesystem content.

That's all well and good, but I've run into some tricky problems with IE
and SSL.  Now some would argue that this is a bug, but I think IE is
actually inline with the standard.  Details are at:

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q316431&

Basically, when a previous header has been sent to not cache anything,
it won't let you save a file - that actually makes sense.  So, the
workaround, which I've found works all the time, it to replace the
default caching headers (ie, no-cache) with this:

header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate', TRUE);
header('Pragma: ', TRUE);

Next would be to send the standard disposition, type and so forth
headers, per above.

So that's one little gotcha, that I think I've been able to resolve.

Another gotcha, that I can't resolve, actually involves Mozilla.  For
instance, Mozilla (and derivatives) always append the file extension of
the type of page originally viewed.  What do people do for this?  For
instance, in phpMyAdmin, downloading a .sql file will be saved as a
.sql.php file.  I frankly haven't looked too deeply, but a work around
for the future would be nice.

So at the end of the day, I think it's somewhat of a black art.  On
occasion, trying to force a download vs a file open seems impossible,
depending on browser, version, and plugins.  Has anyone developed a
matrix like:

Browser -> Version -> Required Behavior -> Use These Headers?

Getting some definitive answers from the Browser/HTTP/Front-End guys
would be invaluable.

Note the case of Content-Length and Content-Type. This doesn't affect
implementation, but we may as well be perfectionists. :-)

I think using an array makes the syntax a bit cumbersome, but that's just
personal preference.

As shown, yes. You can specify the inline attribute to do the opposite,
basically making the resource an embedded one. Dan clearly knows this - I
only mention this to make sure our wording isn't misleading. I know a lot
of people who think the header() function is for redirecting, for a
similar reason.

I have read where developers intentionally set an unknown mime type when
they want to force a download. Does anyone know whether this is justified?
The argument I've seen is that when the browser has a default action
specified for the given mime type, the attachment attribute of
Content-Disposition is ignored, and the resource is displayed inline
instead.

You may wish to use specific headers to force proxy servers not to cache 
your files.  Examples of this would be if you wish the files to be 
accessible to only authenticated users, or if you are regenerating 
content regularly (daily reports, etc) and you want to ensure that the 
user has the most recent version.

I have attached an example of a function used to set appropriate 
cache-control headers for preventing proxy/client caching.

The best source of information on this subject is of course RFC2616 
(http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html), and any recommendations on the 
subject of headers should refer back to this document for justification.

I apologize for the capitalization errors in my previous email, the 
example should have read:

$attach = array(
   'filename' => 'myfile.pdf',
   'mimetype' => 'application/pdf',
   'content'  => 'pdf here'
);

header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='. $attach['filename']);
header('Content-Length: '. strlen($attach['content']));
header('Content-Type: '. $attach['mimetype']);
echo $attach['content'];
exit;

You could also add an MD5 header to allow user agents to check the 
integrity of the downloaded file:

header('Content-MD5: '. md5($attach['content']));

For a further discussion of the Content-Disposition header see RFC2183 
(http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2183.html).

Interesting. I agree with those who would argue that this is a bug. :-)

Section 14.9.1 of RFC 2616 is where you want to read to determine whether
you agree with my intrepretation. Of particular note is the opening
description of no-cache:

    If the no-cache directive does not specify a field-name, then
    a cache MUST NOT use the response to satisfy a subsequent
    request without successful revalidation with the origin server.

>From the description on Microsoft's Web site, it sounds like you simply
cannot display a Word document in the browser when the no-cache directive
is set, which makes no sense at all. If this is true of Word documents,
why is it not true for HTML? The HTTP specification does not advocate
inconsistent interpretation of the specification depending upon the
content type. I don't even see how anyone could pose a good argument in
favor of this.

It seems to me that someone at Microsoft has confused no-cache with
no-store. The irony is that the opposite worked in favor for Microsoft
during the browser wars. When a resource used no-store, Netscape would
request the resource again for simple things like printing, whereas
Internet Explorer would not. Anyone remember this?

I've cited sections of RFC 2616 before that might explain this
inconsistency regarding the interpretation of no-store, but I cannot think
of a defense for Microsoft's interpretation of no-cache, unless it's based
purely on semantics and not on the specification.

> Another gotcha, that I can't resolve, actually involves Mozilla.
> For instance, Mozilla (and derivatives) always append the file
> extension of the type of page originally viewed.

I would argue that this is a bug in Mozilla. :-) I've heard of this also,
and I'll try to recall the workarounds. Mozilla is not alone on this, as
Internet Explorer has been known to have similar problems, and it even
goes a step further by not just ignoring the filename given in
Content-Disposition, but also the content type given in Content-Type.

Would you mind taking a look to see if phpMyAdmin sends the correct
Content-Disposition header? I wouldn't assume that the browser is
necessarily the one at fault here. :-)

> So at the end of the day, I think it's somewhat of a black art.

I totally agree, which is what makes this a great Phundamental.

> Getting some definitive answers from the Browser/HTTP/Front-End
> guys would be invaluable.

Everyone can help with this by doing some testing, especially if you've
encountered any of the problems Hans and I have referenced. It's been
quite a while since I researched this, so I'll have to dig up some notes
to hopefully find some better answers.

Hehe, I was wondering how long it would be before someone called me on 
that, see my previous mail to the list... That's what I get for posting 
before I check the relevant RFC.

The most common trick seems to be to specify the mime-type as 
application/force-download or application/x-download, though I haven't 
been able to find any specification relating to these mime-types.

This is possible, though it seems a nasty hack because the download 
dialog for the user would most likely display an 'unknown file type' and 
would probably trigger such things as the WinXP 'firewall', etc.

The idea I guess would be to work around a user who has told their 
browser to always open a particular kind of file without prompting 
(usually such things as .pdf,.xls or .doc files), but in doing so you 
are really exceeding the limits of the specification, and are really at 
the mercy of implementation quirks.

According to the (RFC2183) spec you can use an unknown 
Content-Disposition, as the spec states it should be treated as 
Content-Disposition: attachment.  However I haven't experimented with 
this myself.

Well, I know Bugzilla can be hooked up with CVS so changes are reflected 
in Bugzilla for customers to look over. If you can do that, I assume you 
could tie it into other stuff - like something that would pull hours out 
and make invoices, and then you could send it to a PDF maker. Distinct 
pieces, real UNIX style stuff. Might be 'fun' (or at least useful!) to 
work on it as a team.

maybe this could be turned into a project :) i know that when i finish
the code archive for NYPHP i would be willing to help out.  I also
thought of writing my own web based thing like quickbooks but i am not
that great with javascript LOL

i love how quickbooks has thier online edition but if i we could
develop something along the lines of that obviously not as feature
rich at the start i'm game ;)

I do.  Can you send me one of your pprof files (and the relevant lines 
from your php.ini as well, for good measure)?  Also, can you verify 
that your apd version is 1.x and not 0.9.x?  The latter shouldn't even 
run on PHP5, but I have sketchy feelings about the pear installer.

Maybe it could even turn into an OS online service.

This email consists of a number of quotes from the different responses 
to the PHundamentals question on headers & downloads. (See: 
http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2004-October/012375.html)
Each quote is followed by a question. When responding, feel free to 
slice up this email as needed but please include the particular 
quote/question you are responding to.

QUOTE No. 1 - Mozilla and file extensions:
"Another gotcha, that I can't resolve, actually involves Mozilla.  For
instance, Mozilla (and derivatives) always append the file extension of
the type of page originally viewed.  What do people do for this?  For
instance, in phpMyAdmin, downloading a .sql file will be saved as a
.sql.php file."

QUESTION FOR QUOTE NO.1: Has anyone resolved the problem mentioned in 
quote no. 1? Has anyone NOT had that problem?



QUOTE NO. 2 - IE, Caching and SSL:
"...but I've run into some tricky problems with IE
and SSL.  Now some would argue that this is a bug, but I think IE is
actually inline with the standard.  Details are at:

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q316431&

Basically, when a previous header has been sent to not cache anything,
it won't let you save a file - that actually makes sense.  So, the
workaround, which I've found works all the time, it to replace the
default caching headers (ie, no-cache) with this:

header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate', TRUE);
header('Pragma: ', TRUE);

Next would be to send the standard disposition, type and so forth
headers, per above."

QUESTION FOR QUOTE NO.2: Are there any SSL issues with non-IE browsers?



QUOTE NO. 3 - Using Unknown MIME Type:

"I have read where developers intentionally set an unknown mime type 
when they want to force a download. Does anyone know whether this is 
justified?"

QUESTION FOR QUOTE NO.3 - Any one have any experience with this?



QUOTE NO. 4 - Browser/Header Matrix:

"Has anyone developed a matrix like:

Browser -> Version -> Required Behavior -> Use These Headers?"

QUESTION FOR QUOTE NO.4: Anyone have such a matrix or know of the 
existence of such a matrix?



QUOTE NO. 5: A Black Art?:

"So at the end of the day, I think it's somewhat of a black art.  On
occasion, trying to force a download vs a file open seems impossible,
depending on browser, version, and plugins."

QUESTION FOR QUOTE NO.5: Agree? Disagree? And why?

Hi gang,

Being that I host several PHP driven websites, this isn't completely off topic.

I used to use RackSpace, but the high prices didn't match the
nonexistant service.  So I switched to Server Beach, where the prices
rocked but they refused to provide backups, even when I offered to pay
extra.  So I switched to aPlus (who got a high rating as a hosting
provider) - and was lied to by the sales agent up front; lied to by
another who promised a customer I referred I would get credited one
month; and then told to bugger off when I had complaints.  And after
half a year their backup is still not implemented anyway!

Are any of you out there happy with a dedicated provider, and paying
in the $100 - $250 range?  Do you get backups?  Do you get printed
invoices?  Do you speak with a human when something goes wrong?

I'm looking to mirror Mambo in the US, and also am gearing up to
launch a new online magazine (more on that later, the domain will blow
your minds), and have no interest in spam or pr0n - my content may be
misspelled, but is nevertheless clean.

Anybody out there lend a helping hand to a distressed and distraught soul?

I don't use them (yet), but I've heard good things about these guys:

http://johncompanies.com/

This is who OSDir.com uses, and they can handle a Slashdotting just fine
(it happens frequently for them, so this was a requirement). At
$105/month, it seems pretty reasonable, especially given the high level of
service I've heard and read about.

The company I work for runs VoxRox (http://www.voxrox.com/).  It's 
small, but they have a good datacentre and the support is top notch.

If you want an indication of speed, check out their sourceforge mirror.

kattare.com has been good to me. Also small, but in a good way. The 
owner/founder handles customer service.
slightly pricey at $250/ month. they are proponents of slackware linux 
there.

What about tar and then transferring it to another system? You can 
mysqldump into that and you shoudl have a whole site. What am I 
missing? I use apollohosting and have had only limited issues. Is the 
issue incremental or hourly backups? Let's be honest if you do not own 
the server you really are not going to get real backup, ie. hourly or 
better. If I am wrong I would love to give that ISP my business.

I have used valueweb.com for a small linux dedicated server - 59$ per
month with ensim basic on it, which you have to do the configuration
for the accounts. 20$ upgrades it to pro, which lets your customers do
their own managing. you can configure options that you can add
redundant hdd, and other options.

I used them until my server hdd died, which then I was already in
process of switching to free hosting from gamingsource.co.uk, so i
just cancelled it.

Support was nice, price was right.

I have also used rackshack.net - but they were about 120$ or so for a
lower end server.

I have a co-worker that runs http://www.intelliwebplus.com/ - he has a
cat5 connection right to time warners datacenter since he is in the
same building, and has great service, and has no problems with you
calling him, since it happens all the time :P

Other than that, I would just search webhostingtalk to see for other companies.

Hi there:

This is a very general question, but I don't know where to begin, but 
generally.  I have, over the years built a fairly complex publishing 
system which is installed on several sites.  Recently, I've noticed 
that my mailing list component is choking; PHP bunks out with a 
memory limit error, which is very unfortunate, since there's no way 
of knowing how many messages were sent before this happened.

I need to address this issue, but I wanted to get people's strategic 
opinions about what to cut out in order to reduce memory consumption.

Basically, my central data class extracts names and email addresses 
out of a database, stores that in an array.  We're talking around 
6,000 users here...not a huge number, but sizable.

Then, I loop through the returned users, create a custom message for 
them by replacing codes in a template, and pass it off to a class of 
mine which is just a wrapper for PHPMailer.

That's the basic structure.

So, what should I do?  A few salient points:

: Do objects and arrays eat up a ton of memory?  Should I instead 
select each user separately inside the loop (more database 
connections, but fewer items stored each time)?

: Should I be unsetting variables as soon as I no longer need them? 
Would this make much of a difference?

: Anything else I should look at?  My goal here is to build it so it 
will scale upward; this project will eventually have tens of 
thousands of users...maybe hundreds of thousands.

Thanks much,

I have quite a few sites, from different clients, all with separate
email, some with MySQL, others with PostgreSQL, some in PHP, others in
python, and I have to keep their backups segregated.

For a one-man army this is a PITA.  So paying $20 monthly is worth it
for me.  Nighly is fine.  And no, I don't want to backup 3GB of IMAP
over my puny little DSL line every night...

There are dedicated providers out there that have backup as an option.
 If you really need hourly backup, then you need your own server, no?

Couple things ....

1)  I do hard drive to hard drive backups anyway.  Just write a script and put it in cron, and use public/private keys to scp back and forth between the servers.  It works like a charm. I don't trust tape devices, you never fully know if the data is there.

2)  johnscompanies.com is good, but they are virtual servers. Not a dedicated solution.  Still good.

Matt

I always poo-pooed virtual servers, but this has my interest for some
strange reason ;-)

Anybody have good/bad experiences with johnscompanies.com and virtual servers?

I wouldn't mind having a virtual server, as long as it wasn't really
on a 2 processor Sun from 1994...

-- Mitch, really, REALLY irate at aPlus, will probably put up a page
it is so bad...

You should check out their Web site. They basically provide two options:
colocation and dedicated. It sounds like you want dedicated, which is
$105/month instead of $75/month (or $65/month if you choose FreeBSD) for
colocation.

I'm thinking of using their colocation services. It still looks and feels
like a dedicated server, but the OSDir guy tells me that these accounts
slow down when you get Slashdotted, and that's when he needs to be up the
most.

Another thing that caught my eye is that I can get it for $45/month as an
open source developer. That makes it a very good deal for my needs. :-)

How does everyone keep their mailing lists in tune?  I just have way too 
many folders lately.  I used to have all my mailing lists come into a 
single folder, but then it would just get flooded.  Now I'm thinking about 
making a single folder for "hightrafficmailinglists" and a single folder 
for lowtrafficmailinglists .... but I wanted to know what everyone's 
thought was.

I know of no FOSS editors, but XMLMind is very nice.  We are using it
for the new batch of documentation for Mambo, and it is usable by
non-programmers as well ;-)

If all you want is syntax highlighting, then most of the IDEs and
editors out there will do as well.

When I used Evolution I lived in virtual folders.  Then I switched to
Gmail for the threading, and use filters to apply labels and archive
mailing lists.

My only problem is cvs committs are just too much activity to keep up,
Mambo cvs is at 1797 messages and climbing...

xml-mode in emacs/Xemacs has syntax highlighting, tag matching,
well-formedness-checking, and various context-sensitive tag
insert/modify/etc operations. Plus, if you're a pidgin elisp speaker
like me, you can limp along enough to write some small functions that
do common tasks like insert frequent tag sequences.

There's no built-in schema validation (only DTDs) but there may be a
package floating around on the Internets to do i -- I haven't checked
in a while.

thanks David -- I also looked at the XMLMind that Mitch mentioned and

John,

If you're only going to need an XML editor for a short project of less 
than 30 days, you might want to look at the trial of XMLSpy, which is 
fully functional for that period:

I used to do a lot of work for American data center and boxnix, and their
hosting and service are top notch (haven't switched from them, and don't
plan to very soon):
http://www.boxnix.com/
http://www.americandatacenter.com/

On the other hand, MediaTemple has a really sweet deal on their appliance
server.  If I didn't have the deal I have now, I would absolutely move over
to MT.  I know tons of designers who use them and a couple developers who
work with them, and they come highly recommended.

I've only used their shared hosting, but pair Networks has dedicated

I used XMLSpy about 2 years ago, and it was well advanced from the other 
choices... truly an XML-centric tool as opposed to "an editor that can 
be used for XML"... once I was knee-deep into the  DTD management and 
nitty-gritty that comes well after  you get started, XMLSpy proved to be 
a power tool.

The following presentation I put together covers several similarities

PEAR DB works perfectly for both Sybase and MySQL, as long as you

I would read up on Sybase's procedural language (T-SQL, IIRC) and get
solid practice playing around with triggers and stored procedures. 
These two things alone will keep you busy, and could have significant
impact on how you develop future applications.

For example, in the past I have written that it makes great sense when
you know you are using a database with stored procedures and triggers
to put as much of that logic in the database, as you will be able to
reuse that logic from ALL applications, regardless of target audience
or programming language.  Your PHP websites, python admin scripts, and
VB client apps can all use that logic.

Of course really enforcing referential integrity will also be a
learning experience, as you will learn there are oddities for each
database (making sure indexes and datatypes match for foreign keys,
loading/deleting must happen in the correct order, etc).

Building a little 5 table test application and seeing how you can max
out the features of the database would be the best way to learn IMHO,
but I am a 'learn by doing' type so my opinion may be biased.

I just looked at that myself the other day. I'm going to go with 
Wordpress. As my hosting needs have swelled to several domains I'm now 
contemplating a dedicated server or hosting environment that could suit 
better than several seperate agreements.

You could process 100-500 users at a time, using a LIMIT condition on
your SELECT.

There's a bunch of different ways to implement this, but I would
probably end up writing a mailer that would:
1) launch every minute from cron
2) check for another running mailer instance
3) if not, check for a pending message
4) look up the id of the last user to be sent the pending message
5) load another 100 users beginning with that id
6) loop and send
7) write the id of the last user somewhere that the next instance of
the mailer can find it, or close out the message if done.

This gives you a lot of control over the amount of mail that's flying
out of your box at any one time, and you can also queue messages to be
sent. If everything breaks, you have some idea of who got the message
and who didn't, so you avoid duplicates.

Can you submit the form using Mac IE?  Chances are this is a browser

I really like the book titled Transact-SQL Programming from O'Reilly.
It doesn't cover 12 specifically, but the content should still be very
valuable.  I've been away from Sybase for a couple years, so there may
be better books out there now...

Have you tried just increasing the memory limit in the php.ini file? I 
think it defaults to 8MB.

Of course, that is a temporary measure. The problem is really that your 
code doesn't scale. Are you passing by reference? PHP4 makes copies of 
variables when you pass them to functions, so you may actually have 2 
or 3 (or more) copies of your data depending on how your classes are 
setup.

Are you merging the complete list with the template and then passing 
the resultant array off to be mailed? That's a lot of customized copies 
of the template (6,000+) to hold in memory. It's probably the size of 
the template that is causing you problems. Adding 1 character to the 
template will cause an additional 6,000 characters to be stored in 
memory. That eats up lots of memory real fast. To scale it, you would 
need to do it in reasonable chunks, or even one at a time, reusing the 
variables to "flush" memory.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] gmail domain keys headers broken?
Message-ID: <20041015193323.GD1185@lola.aquick.org>

Sometime yesterday, gmail started adding DomainKeys-Signature headers
to all outgoing mail. It seems to have non-standard line breaks, and
it displays badly (in mutt, at least).

Is this a problem for anyone else?

This is just one example:

When I used Evolution I lived in virtual folders.  Then I switched to
Gmail for the threading, and use filters to apply labels and archive
mailing lists.

My only problem is cvs committs are just too much activity to keep up,
Mambo cvs is at 1797 messages and climbing...

if you're not into extreme overclocking and especially if (like me) you 
don't mind having coverless computers on your desk, spend your money on 
other stuff.

I don't see your disk configuration or video selection, but if it will 
be running Windows nothing spells performance like dual 10k SATA drives 
and 2GB of paired DDR memory. Not sure you can go that route on your 
budget, however.

-=john andrews

(I am not a gamer) P4 at 2.8GHz, Intel 875PB MB (for stability, has SATA 
RAID on board), Matrox Parhelia triple headed video (for utility), 2GB 
Corsair XMS extreme paired  memory, dual 36GB 10kRPM SATA drives, POS 
case left open and decent 480W PS. RTD under CPU runs reports steady 
84F/28.1C most of the time...in August ambient was high and I did have 
some issues (up to 106F), but nothing a deskfan couldn't solve.

Unfortunately I don't have a solution to offer but do have some 
information to share.  I recently ran into a similar situation.  
Nothing would happen when a user clicked submit when they were on a 
windows box running IE.  The form does work fine when submitting from a 
Mac using Safari.

However, submitting using Netscape on a windows box does work.  It was 
an intranet application, so I was able to just ask the users to use 
netscape for that app.  Not an ideal solution, but other priorities 
called.

Seems to be a browser specific issue...

Yes, I have been noticing that .. It was just hard to (or @ least USED to
be) download Sybase/Oracle and play around with until MySQL creeped in to
steal customers away for expensive licenses :-)

In early days playing with ODBC/Access was the only way to try db stuff, the
JDBC-native stuff came along and I never got around to stored procedures
(which MySQL 5 will have) ... And I can understand the need for logic to
occur on that side ..

Thanks everyone for the great suggestions.  Much appreciated.

>>> For example, in the past I have written that it makes great sense when
you know you are using a database with stored procedures and triggers to put
as much of that logic in the database, as you will be able to reuse that
logic from ALL applications, regardless of target audience or programming
language.  Your PHP websites, python admin scripts, and VB client apps can
all use that logic. <<<

I had a smiliar issue and found that some? browsers had problems if the
submit button was named "submit" if there was Javascript on the page.  This
was a few years ago and I can't recall the exact details of it.

I've been very happy with 1and1.com's dedicated hosting. My servers are 
each under $100/month (most are $50). If you want them to back your data 
up for you it's an extra fee I believe. Myself, I'd rather backup my own 
data so that I can verify it better. I think they send me printed 
invoices although I don't actually open them as I just look at the email 
invoices I get. Their tech support has been pretty good overall. Usually 
I get to talk to a real person within 2-10 minutes and they actually 
seem knowledgable and not just wanks. I could comfortably recommend them 
for dedicated hosting.

Amazon.com sells iPods. It doesn't mean they don't sell books. :-)

Seriously, just check out the Web site. It's a very simple page without a
lot of bloat. You don't even have to click any links to see that they
offer dedicated hosting:

In my case at least, there was no Javascript on the page.

FYI you can now get a native Windows port of PostgreSQL 8 (curently in
beta).  Comes with a graphical administration client, and gives you
access to Oracle power at MySQL's price ;-)

I'm coming in on the conversation late, so excuse me if the following
has already been suggested/tried:

1. Closing Form tag?  I have seen the absence of this cause problems
(although I would expect it NOT to work with Safari in this case)
2. Windows users: are they running SP2?  Is this an intranet app, or is
the host proxied in some manner?  MS is handling web requests to
machines on the local network differently now.

Hope that helps,

Tom

1.  Yes, closing form tag present.
2.  MS SP 1, not yet installed SP 2.

I'll have to do some digging to confirm, but I don't think it's proxied.

Hi All,

Dreamhost has their Dreamserver set of offerings too:

All Debian-based, and also can have the awesome normal Dreamhost control 
panel. I have used their shared hosting for some time now, which have 
been (knock on wood) pretty good. I have been thinking about upgrading 
to a dedicated server from them.

They also offer customized add-on support plans which turn an unmanaged 
box into a semi-managed or fully-managed one.

Prices are $150 per month and up (excluding add-on service plans).

URL:
http://www.dreamservers.com

I have also considered http://www.johncompanies.com ; they are supposed 
to be good. As Chris (Shifflet) mentioned, they offer steep discounts 
for open source developers. My only concern with johncompanies.com is 
that they don't have much contact information on their site. And I fear 
that they are a (very) small company. That does not have to be a bad 
thing, but small companies can easily go under. On the other hand, 
Dreamhost is not that big either, but I think they host at least 30,000 
domains on their shared servers, and have at least 30 employees. I hear 
that the founder of John Companies, John Kozubik, worked for Yahoo's 
(now discontinued ?) dedicated server offerings.

Best regards,

- Jay

Ouch. Non-standard line breaks seems very un-Gmail. 

That said, Mozilla mail and Outlook 2003 are both fine with it. The
syntax is right for multi-line headers, did they forget to put in the
carriage returns or something?

Chris -- 

Do you have any info on the company itself? Their site is a little too
un-bloated, I think. Who runs the joint?

It's not just Johncompanies -- most colo providers have a dodgy web
presence, and it makes it very hard to be a savvy customer.

Even Pilosoft has nothing about Alex or about the work he does for

Aaron,

Some browsers won't put anything in the $_POST['submit'] field.. try 
this script on your various browsers and let us know what you get:

<html>
<body>
<?php

if (isset($_POST['go']) || isset($_POST['submit'])) {
     print_r($_POST);
     die();
} else { ?>
     <form method="post" action="<?=$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']?>">
      <input type="text" name="value1"><br>
      <input type="text" name="value2"><br>
      <input type="hidden" name="go" value="1">
      <input type="submit" name="submit"><br>
     </form>
<?
}
?>
</body>
</html>

Agreed... colo can be a unique business, and actually web sites don't
mean anything.  For instance, I can grab photos from Verio, Rackspace,
etc. and call it pictures of my facility.

True, but I can bring you down to his facility :)

He also manages VoIP, DSL, etc. - great technically, just not good as
far as marketing  :)

It was obvious, just not to me...

I used a different "body" phrase and forgot the closing ">". So IE saw the form tag start in the body declaration. :(  Netscape overcame it, IE didn't. As a unix weenie, I'm not surprised.

Thanks all! It was the validator that gave me the first clues.

ciao!

I use Pilosoft DSL.
Good speeds and it's nice to have a static IP.

Hi there.

In my post about memory usage, the suggested solutions are pretty 
much in line with the path I was thinking, but I could probably use 
some help, at this point in my PHP 'career' with a good reference on 
coding efficiency.

Does anyone know of a good website (preferred) or book (second 
choice) that really discusses strategies for script optimization, in 
terms of performance, of passing by reference vs. not, and how to 
structure loops for optimal performance, and so on?  How I can 
profile my projects and spot inefficiencies?

This is probably all CS 101 stuff, but I'm a self-taught coder, and 
could use the guidance.

Thanks,

Marc

I started out with dedicated machines at Exodus, then moved to Dialtone 
(Miami center), which was bought out by Interland, then to 
Rackshack.net. I also have a virtual server with johncompanies as a 
backup. With the exception of Exodus, I still run machines at all the 
above data centers. I have set up a web of nagios machines at those 
sites (and a few others) monitoring  each other for uptime.

Rackshack as decent prices and offer plenty of bandwidth (Haven't 
shopped around lately so I don't know if they are still competitive).
Johncompanies offers reasonable prices and prompt personal service.
Dialtone used to be a very reliable provider, but after they were bought 
out by Interland everything went down the tubes. I still host some 
servers with them only because it is a pain to migrate services that 
require 24/7 uptime.

Good morning boys and girls!

What are some of the PHP/Apache settings that determine whether this works
or not?

Nevermind. I think I found a clue. (set output_buffering = off in php.ini
or via 'php_value outputbuffering off' in a .htaccess)

Actually, this has to do with the browser as well is the server.

I found a comment of mine from 2000 on the flush function (via google cache):

I've had problems where IE would buffer the output on it's own before
showing it on the screen.
What I did is to print 300 spaces before the flush. This seems to have
filled the IE buffer and output it to the screen.

Pity that php.net has removed older comments as I see that some of
them are still helpful. I just noticed this now.

Neither the mailing list nor the IRC chat are dead. The irc is just 
really quiet. (You can usually find someone to help there 9-5 EST)

That error means that you are trying to stop the main gtk loop but it 
isn't running.  The problem is that your call to connect is wrong. The 
connect method takes two strings as arguments but your second argument 
in your button class is executing a function and passing back the 
functions return value. You are executing the gtk::main_quit() method 
and using the return value (NULL) as the name of the function to connect 
the signal to. That is why you get the warning about connecting to the 
callback ''. The Gtk-CRITICAL warning comes from the fact that you tried 
to execute the gtk::main_quit() method before executing the gtk::main() 
method.

On a side note, whenever you pass a PHP-GTK widget to/from a method you 
need to do it with references. Otherwise you are making a copy of the 
object and you are adding the copy to window (or other container). Then 
what you think is pointing to your button in your window is really 
pointing to the original button that you created which is still floating 
around in space.

I hope that helps.

Message-ID: <BD9991F0.7A55%corey@domanistudios.com>

Does anyone know of a way to dynamically output jpeg and eps format graphics
server side with php? It looks like GD only does png, gif, and jpeg.

For example, http://snowflakes.lookandfeel.com/ lets you design a snowflake,
save it, and then download it as a jpeg or eps file. Basically, their front
end puts together a coods array that is fed into a  page that uses something
to do the drawing and outputting.

What package is capable of that?

Here?s an example of the jpeg version:
http://snowflakes.lookandfeel.com/viewflake.php?id=469249

Here?s the eps version:
http://snowflakes.lookandfeel.com/flake.php?id=4692494&output=eps

Your flake looks much better than mine.  Mine turned out like a big white poop.

Never let the guy with only one good eye design your flakes!

Seriously, I'd assume they were using Flash capabilities to create and
output that image.  I did notice that the big ugly poop-flake I
created is not so nice in JPEG format, as they forgot to antialias the
lines.

netpbm (http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/) and ImageMagick 
(http://www.imagemagick.org/) can both output various flavors of EPS.

They are both command line utilities, though I know of a PECL extension 
for ImageMagick (http://pecl.php.net/package/imagick) and another 
extension called MagickWand (http://www.magickwand.org/www/apis.html).

Scott,

it doesnt look like an IRC client can be made in PHP :(

this is from the phIg project

This was more a failed experiment thn anything else. PHP does not
support multi-threading, and as such...the client had some major
flaws. The project has been discontinued. Feel free to learn from the
source though.

Somebody seems to think IRC has a place with PHP though.
http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=146

I found this little note on threads with PHP but I can't find the PECL 
package that Zeev is talking about.

"We don't plan to add threading support to PHP at this point. The focus 
of PHP remains dynamic web pages. Several people have experimented with 
adding threading support for PHP - you can test it yourself by trying 
PECL/threads (experimental)."

Hello, folks.  I'm not sure that what I want to do is possible.  If it
is, I'm sure it takes a lot more JavaScript than I know (which is
precious little).

PHP 4.3.2 on Apache on Linux.  I would like to create an object of a
PHP class by choosing an element from an HTML select drop-down box,
and using the selected value to specify a parameter to the object's
constructor.  (Then, if the selection changes, throw out the old
object, and create a new one in its place, with the newly-selected
value being sent to the constructor.)

Can I do this?  TIA,
-c

sure, in javascript make an if tree (Remember it's 'else if' with the space)
or switch-case construct,

inside each case put the PHP code for the desired constructor...

if(document.formname["controlname"].value) == "X")
{
<?
	var $classX = new classX($parm);
?>
}
else if(document.formname["controlname"].value) == "Y")
{
<? 
	var $classX = new classY($parm);
?>
}
else
{
...
}

Syntax might be wrong a smidge here of there, YMMV.

I'm not sure if this is what you mean, but here is a simple example:

Dan

<?php

if (isset($_REQUEST['param'])) {
   $_SESSION['myobj'] = new myclass($_REQUEST['param']);
}

class myclass
{
   var $value;

   function myclass($value)
   {
     $this->value = $value;
   }
}

?>
<html>
   <head>
     <title>Test</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <form>
       <select name="param">
         <option value="1">1</option>
         <option value="2">2</option>
       </select>
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>
     <pre>
<?php
   if (isset($_SESSION['myobj'])) {
     print_r($_SESSION['myobj']);
   } else {
     print 'hit submit to create an object';
   }
?>
     </pre>
   </body>

Thank you, Chris and Dan, for your quick answers.  I've realized that
I left something out of the original question.  I'd like to change the
object without having to reload the page, or even hit a submit button
-- just on the action of changing the pull-down.

There's an "onchange" event in the SELECT object.

No, it can't be done. You can't parse the php code on the client side. 
That means that you have to request/reload a new page. Even if you use 
the onChange feature of the select box you will still be submitting the 
form. The use just might not notice.

This brings to mind that there is a way to trick some browsers into
reloading your javascript, but actually Scott is 100% right - It slipped my
mind that this would require submit-to-self if nothing else, to change the
state of the PHP script at the server.

Sorry bout that :(

it can be done, but you need to have a way of communicating with the 
server other than through the regular request->response cycle.  for 
example you could use a JavaScript XMLRPC client to make an XMLRPC 
request to the server which would then update the object.

However, this begs the question why?  If you want to change an object on 
the server without being able to see the results of the change what is 
the point?

If you are trying to populate a form dynamically without the overhead of 
reloading the whole page, then you are going to have to make a 
round-trip to the server of some kind.  One way to do this is using 
Harry Fuecks project ScriptServer (currently pending name change), which 
you can read more about here:

http://xmlrpccom.sourceforge.net/scriptserver/scriptserver/docs/scriptserver.html
http://www.sitepoint.com/blog-view.php?blogid=9

I guess we need to know more about exactly what functionality you're 
trying to achieve to be able to give you any more meaningful advice.

Harry Fuecks has been doing quite a bit of research in this arena
recently...

Take a look at this (3 part article):
http://tinyurl.com/6was6
http://tinyurl.com/6n6vg
http://tinyurl.com/6qsac

And the eventual outcome was this project:
http://xmlrpccom.sourceforge.net/scriptserver/

"***Intro***

ScriptServer provides tools to "hook up" PHP and Javascript,

for the purpose of fetching data from PHP into a web page

which has already loaded, without reloading the entire

page."

Hope that might help you do what you need to do.

Fair enough.  I created a calendar-type class in PHP, where certain
dates become links based on a parameter to the constructor.  Which
dates become links is based on data in the DB -- I pass in a course,
and it highlights the days the course meets.

I have a list of this semester's courses in a drop-down.  When I
choose a different course from the drop down, I'd like the linked
dates to change.  (I'm using the links to fill a text field in the
form; that much is working.)  So, instead of displaying 5 calendars,
I'd like to display only one, and have it be pertinent to the selected
course.

I suppose I could re-implement the calendar class in JavaScript, if it
would help.  Would it?  Or can I keep the PHP class?

You can also use dynamic javascript, a la Chris Hendry's Paxi, see
http://nyphp.org/content/presentations/paxi/index.php?slide=4

You don't refresh the page, and you don't use XML-RPC -- you use
javascript to append a new <script> element to the head of the
document, which causes the browser to fetch the script from the server
and execute it. Doesn't work in Safari, tho (last we checked).

Hello everyone,

My name is Salman Mazhar. I have a script that searches for a keyword in a 
text file. I am able to search the word using the stristr() function in php. 
This function is non-case sensitive. However, I want to display the searched 
word in the line as highlighted in a different color than the line. I use 
the str_replace() function and replace the word with the word in red color 
but the str_replace() function is case-sensitive. If I am searching for the 
word Computer and I type in upper case C, its only going to replace those 
instances of computer that begin with upper case C and leave the rest of 
them without any color change. Does anyone know how to get around this 
problem?

Thanks.
Sincerely Yours,
Salman Mazhar.

Hi:

This only helps if you use PHP 5.

Is there a way to do what was asked with PHP 4??

Thanx.

It is not elegant but you can try searching for the word lowercase, 
then search for it with an init cap then plural (add an s). Like I said 
not elegant but 90% sufficient.

Here is something that seems to work. It isn't very elegant either but 
it does the trick.

<?php
$term = 'bob';
$phrase = 'Bob likes bobbing for apples';
$highlightStart = '<b>';
$highlightEnd = '</b>';

// Case insensative version of the string.
$lowerPhrase = strtolower($phrase);

// Position of first occurance.
$pos = strpos($lowerPhrase, $term);

// Loop through the search phrase until we don't find any more of term.
while ($pos !== false) {

   // Cut the phrase into chunks around the term and add some highlight 
chars.
   $phrase = substr($phrase, 0, $pos) . $highlightStart .
     substr($phrase, $pos, strlen($term)) . $highlightEnd .
     substr($phrase, $pos + strlen($term));

   // Capture the strpos offset.
   $oldPos = $pos + 1;

   // Recreate the lowercase string.
   $lowerPhrase = strtolower($phrase);

   // Get the next position
   $pos = strpos($lowerPhrase, $term, $oldPos + strlen($highlightStart));

   // Debug output.
   echo 'Pos ' . $pos . 'Old pos ' . $oldPos . "\n";
   echo $phrase . "\n";
   echo $lowerPhrase . "\n";
}
?>

There is a way to do this in php4 for those who don't have/want to use 
preg_replace:

function str_ireplace ($find,$replace,$string)
{
   if (!is_array($find)) {
     $find = array($find);
   }

   if (!is_array($replace)) {
     // this will duplicate the string into an array the size of $find
     $rString = $replace;
     $replace = array();
     foreach ($find as $fKey => $fItem) {
       $replace[$fKey] = $rString;
     }
   }

   foreach ($find as $fKey => $fItem) {
     $between = explode(strtolower($fItem),strtolower($string));
     $pos = 0;

     foreach ($between as $bKey => $bItem) {
       $between[$bKey] = substr($string,$pos,strlen($bItem));
       $pos += strlen($bItem) + strlen($fItem);
     }

     if (isset($replace[$fKey])) {
       $string = implode($replace[$fKey],$between);
     } else {
       $string = implode('',$between);
     }
   }

   return($string);
}

the easiest way is to use preg_replace though:

$highlighted = preg_replace('/('.preg_quote($searched_for).')/i', '<span 
class="highlight">$1</span>', $searched_in);

With preg you can do even more fun things like pulling out context 
around matching terms, etc, for example:

function hilight_body($searched,$found)
{
   $newsearch = preg_replace('/\s+/is','|',preg_quote($searched,'/'));
   $found = htmlentities($found);

   $find = array(
     '/\$/is',                                              // remove 
dollar signs
     '/(('.$newsearch.')+)/is',                             // hilight
     '/(^|^[^<]*?\s)([^<]{0,100}<span)/ise',                // trim front
     '/(<\/span>[^<]{0,100})($|\s[^<]*?$)/ise',             // trim back
     '/(<\/span>[^<]{0,25})(\s[^<]*?)?(\s[^\s]*<span)/ise', // trim between
     '/###DOLLAR###/is'                                     // replace 
dollar signs
   );

   $replace = array(
     '###DOLLAR###',
     '<span class="highlight">$1</span>',
     '(trim("$1")==""?"$1":"... ")."$2"',
     '"$1".(trim("$2")=="$2"?"$2":" ...")',
     '"$1".(trim("$2")=="$2"?"$2":" ...")."$3"',
     '$'
   );

   $newfound = preg_replace($find,$replace,$found);

   if ($newfound != $found) {
     return $newfound;
   }

   $find = array(
     '/\$/is',                                              // remove 
dollar signs
     '/^(.{0,100})($|\s.*?$)/ise',                          // trim to 
length
     '/###DOLLAR###/is'                                     // replace 
dollar signs
   );

   $replace = array(
     '###DOLLAR###',
     '"$1".(trim("$2")==""?"$2":" ...")',
     '$'
   );

   return preg_replace($find,$replace,$found);
}

Which will return 100 characters before the first match, 25 characters 
after each match and 100 characters after the last match with the 
matched terms surrounded by span tags, or the first 100 characters of a 
string with no matches.

I wasn't sure if you wanted to return a line from the text (which Dan seems
to have taken care of pretty well) or if you just wanted to replace words
with formatted versions of themselves.  Here's a really basic function I use
to do the latter with multiple keywords (sep. by spaces):

<?php
    function highlight($keywords, $text) {
        $keywords = trim($keywords);
        
        if (strlen($keywords)) {
            $keywords = explode(' ', $keywords);
            
            if (count($keywords)) {
                foreach($keywords as $keyword) {
		        // you could, of course use whatever html formatting
you want here
                    $text = preg_replace('/(' . $keyword . ')/i',
'<b>\\1</b>', $text); 
                }
            }
        }
            
        return $text;
    }
?>

Good Luck!

Just curious, why are you exploding the string into an array?
You can just do:

    function highlight($keyword, $text) {
                 $text = preg_replace('/\b' . $keyword .
'\b/i','<b>\\0</b>',$text);
                 return $text;
    }

Woops - I read your code to fast :)
I didn't see you were doing this for multiple key words.

In any case though it would be good to use the \b word boundry
modifier so you won't be highlighting substring word matches.

IF one wanted to put up images with F/OS LAMP solution (like Gallery), 
and Gallery was not an acceptable option, what would you suggest be 
investigated today?
It doesn't have to be as complex as Gallery... perhaps a thumbnail 
scroller with CSS stylin' and a database backend for a single "album" or 
somesuch....

All suggestions welcome, but of course those based on actual experience +1.

The word boundary modifier is a good idea if that's what you want, but 
be careful about constructing preg strings without using preg_quote, you 
can get into real trouble if the user enters something odd.

The syntax should be:

function highlight($keyword, $text) {
   return preg_replace('/\b'. preg_quote($keyword,'/') 
.'\b/i','<b>$0</b>',$text);
}

Note that the character used to delimit the preg expression (in this 
case /) is passed as the second parameter to preg_quote.

I'm not sure exactly why but the PHP manual indicates that $0 is the 
preferred form for backreferences in the replacement string since 4.04.

 From http://php.net/preg_replace

> Replacement may contain references of the form \\n or (since PHP 4.0.4) $n, with the latter form being the preferred one.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] simplexml, gentoo emerge

Kinda offtopic? Maybe. I'm trying to compile 5.0.2 using gentoo's
portage (which I am learning about this week: crash course). Anyway,
if I understand things, instead of ./configure options, one sets flags
called USE flags. They generally mirror the ./configure options, but
not one-to-one, and therein lies the rub.There's one called simplexml
(which is either + [yes] or - [no]) but when I look at the simpleXML
documentation on php.net, I find:
"Installation

The SimpleXML extension is enabled by default. To disable it, use the
--disable-simplexml configure option."

but still, I include simplexml in my flags. but when I run a script
that includes a call to a simplexml function, I get:

"Fatal error: Call to undefined function simplexml_load_file()  in
/var/www/etc."

So it must have been explicitly disabled, but when I make an info.php,
there's no reference whatsoever to simplexml, and indeed the
./configure script (which is logged, of course) doesn't include the
string 'simplexml'.

I guess this actually is offtopic because installation is not really
within the realm of topics discussed herein. Nonetheless, I'm asking
if anyone has some insight here. I am suspecting it's a problem with
gentoo's "ebuild" (as they call them), but maybe someone can save me
from such guesswork.

thanks.

Thank you all for your help.  I solved my own problem.  I realized
that I could reload the page on choosing something from the pull-down,
use $_GET to keep track of the value, and create the object when the
page loads.  I'm not sure why I was resistant to reload the page,
except probably that I hadn't realized it was a viable option.  Thanks
again!

Did you set your USE flags?  Add USE=simplexml before your emerge call 
or put simplexml in your /etc/make.conf in the USE flags.

So the command should be roughly:

USE="simplexml <any_other_flags_you_want_set>" \
emerge -pv /usr/portage/dev-php/mod_php/php/mod_php-5.0.2.ebuild

That'll do a pretend emerge on that specific version, and tell you what 
use flags it's going to use, or will accept.  If you see any that have a 
(-) minus in front of them that you want compiled in, add that to the 
USE="" statement.  Once you've got things looking the way you want (with 
at least the +simplexml showing ;-)  then remove the -pv and run this:

USE="simplexml <any_other_flags_you_want_set>" \
emerge /usr/portage/dev-php/mod_php/php/mod_php-5.0.2.ebuild

You should be good to go.

/mk

You can look at the USE flags for the package by doing:

*emerge -pv mod_php
*
The USE flags for mod_php (4.x that is) are:

*dev-php/mod_php-4.3.9  -X -apache2 +berkdb +crypt -curl -debug -debug 
-debug -doc -fdftk -firebird -flash -freetds -gd -gd-external +gdbm -gmp 
-hardenedphp -imap -informix -ipv6 -java +jpeg -kerberos -ldap -mcal 
-memlimit -mssql +mysql +nls -oci8 -odbc +pam +pdflib +png -postgres -qt 
-snmp +spell +ssl -tiff +truetype +xml2 -yaz*

Looks like xml2 is switched on by default.

Did you install php or mod_php? IIRC, installing mod_php results in 
*both* php and mod_php being built and installed.

BTW, Matt's suggestion is correct however setting the USE flags on the 
command-line is not persistent and so you have to repeat it for 
subsequent updates (not to mention you have to lookup and/or remember 
what you set on a previous emerge!). Much better to create the 
/etc/portage directory and in there create a file called package.use 
with the USE flags for each package, one per line. (See "man portage" 
for more info on what files you can use in /etc/portage).

On one of my web servers, my package.use file has these lines for php:

*dev-php/php     -X berkdb crypt -curl -doc -fdftk -firebird flash 
freetds gd -gd-external gdbm -gmp -hardenedphp -imap -informix -ipv6 
-java jpeg -kerberos -ldap -mcal -memlimit mysql ncurses nls -oci8 -odbc 
pam pdflib png -postgres -qt readline snmp spell ssl -tiff truetype xml2 
-yaz
*
*dev-php/mod_php -X -apache2 berkdb crypt -curl -doc -fdftk -firebird 
flash -freetds gd -gd-external gdbm -gmp -hardenedphp -imap -informix 
-ipv6 -java jpeg -kerberos -ldap -mcal -memlimit mysql nls -oci8 -odbc 
pam pdflib png -postgres -qt snmp spell ssl -tiff truetype xml2 -yaz
*
Note that you dont use + when switching a flag "on" and I dont use 
version numbers so these flags will be used for all php emerges.

Maybe you can tell us how exactly how you emerged PHP? I also remember 
that PHP5 is a "masked" ebuild - did you specifically enable the masked 
version? Which version exactly? (You can do "emerge -s ^php$" to find 
out what version you installed).

Yeah, it's masked, and I'm on amd64 architecture FWIW. My emerge
command (roughly from memory) was
$USE="berkdb crypt curl <etc..> xml2 simplexml" emerge
/usr/portage/dev-php/php/php-5.0.2.ebuild

Looking over the replies, I'm wondering if my problem is that I need
to re-emerge mod_php too? But I never did before and php works fine.
Thanks for the replies; I'll put the ideas to the test when I get back
home.

Several things here:

Looks like you emerged a masked ebuild (well, its masked for x86 
machines - not sure if it is for amd64). Also, you don't need to know 
the full path to the ebuild if you set up your Portage files beforehand. 
Ill describe that here:

1. Remove the ebuild you installed (*emerge -C php* and/or *emerge -C 
mod_php*)

2. Create the /etc/portage/package.keywords file and put in something like:

    *>=dev-php/php-5        ~amd64
    >=dev-php/mod_php-5    ~amd64

*This basically says "unmask for amd64 any ebuilds for php and mod_php 
greater than or equal to version 5".
Bear in mind that packages are usually masked by the Gentoo developers 
for a reason (caveat emptor and all that). I wouldn't recommend putting 
~amd64 in /etc/make.conf as that will globally unmask all unstable AMD64 
packages - which wouldn't be great if it emerged a broken system package 
that hosed your machine...

3. Create the /etc/portage/package.use file with the USE flags for each 
package.
I usually specify all the flags but you dont have to (the defaults will 
be used for flags you haven't specified). To get a list of USE flags for 
each package (so you can cut and paste) do:

    *emerge -pv mod_php*

It should show you the flags for mod_php *and* all dependencies 
(including php). Set what you need and save the file.

4. Now you can emerge the package by simply doing:

    *emerge php*

Go away and have a coffee while it builds (it might be pretty fast for 
you but I dont have the latest and greatest hardware so Im used to it 
taking a few minutes even on a fastish x86 server).

I should also say here that Gentoo uses Apache2 by default (if you 
didn't install it then the emerge will pull it in automatically as a 
dependency for mod_php). It sounds like you have already installed it 
and configured it to use mod_php (the config for the init script should 
be in /etc/conf.d/apache). Personally, I am still using Apache 1.x (I 
permanently masked out Apache2 by adding an line in 
/etc/portage/package.mask).

Hopefully these instructions will help you install packages the 
"correct" way and help you understand Portage better.

Last one:
Does anyone actually have php-5 or greater installed with emerge under
gentoo with the simplexml commands working properly?

Thanks to Ajai and Matt: I got emerge to work properly across the
board. But simplexml commands STILL don't work. So I'd like to ask a
different but related question concerning USE flags and ./configure
options. These two sets overlap but don't exhaust each other. Is there
a way pass configuration options to emerge other than with USE flags?
I ask because though simplexml commands are enabled by default, I
notice on phpinfo() that it was configured with --disable-libxml. I'm
wondering if that might be a problem. Note that this was *with* the
xml2 USE flag. But there's no libxml USE flag. So what if I could pass
an explicit --enable-libxml to emerge?

I know simplexml is SUPPOSED to be enabled by default in >=php-5, but
I also wonder if the simplexml USE flag isn't actually being passed
(clues: doesn't show up in phpinfo, etcat-u php returns a list that
*doesn't include simplexml*. Could gentoo actually be using the 4.3.9
USE flags?

I emerged mod_php not php.  Maybe that has something to do with it?

"Me too!"

I had no problems getting PHP 5 it to work on Gentoo.  Guessing from one
of your recent emails, one thing that *might* be key for you is the
difference between the php and mod_php ebuilds.  php is the CLI/CGI
version of PHP.  mod_php is the Apache module that you setup as the
handler for *.php pages served through Apache.  You should be emerging
the latter.  Restart Apache after your emerge, too.

HTH,
Andrew

There are three PHP packages in Portage: php, mod_php, php-cgi

Yes there is (though if you set up the /etc/portage files correctly you 
shouldn't need to).

But for future reference you do it like this:

Set a variable called *EXTRA_ECONF* before you do the emerge, i.e.:

*EXTRA_ECONF="--with-simplexml" emerge php*

Note that doing it this way is not persistent so if you ever do any 
upgrades you will have to manually set this up again.

Actually, looking at the USE flags for PHP5 I see it *off* by default:

*[ebuild  N    ] dev-php/mod_php-5.0.2  -adabas -apache2 -bcmath +berkdb 
-birdstep -bzlib -calendar -cdb -cpdflib +crypt -ctype -curl

I have tested this on a spare machine: setting up the package.keywords 
file on my machine I was able to run emere -pv php and see the resulting 
flags - the USE flags for PHP5 are different to PHP4 (there are much 
more flags!). There is no xml USE flag presumably because the xml2 
library supercedes it so there is an xml2 flag instead.

Usually emerging mod_php will emerge php too (its a dependency).

My bad... you're right.  Though you can use PHP as a CGI with just the
php package, though... I have.  I can't say I have any idea whats in the
php-cgi package.

Yes, true, you can use the command-line PHP in CGI scripts though there 
are subtle differences as the PHP manual states 
(http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php):

"Remarkable differences of the CLI SAPI compared to other SAPIs:

    *

      Unlike the CGI SAPI, no headers are written to the output.

    *

      Though the CGI SAPI provides a way to suppress HTTP headers,
      there's no equivalent switch to enable them in the CLI SAPI.

    *

      CLI is started up in quiet mode by default, though the -q and
      --no-header switches are kept for compatibility so that you can
      use older CGI scripts.

    *

      It does not change the working directory to that of the script.
      (-C and --no-chdir switches kept for compatibility)

    * Plain text error messages (no HTML formatting).


Mind you, this makes little practical difference (espec. if you've done 
any perl CGI scripting) - Im just splitting hairs with a very large axe ;-)

Hi Stephen,  

Try running EXPLAIN on your statement and post the results.

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/EXPLAIN.html

Likely you may not be using indexs or keys most efficiently.

Can you clue us in on what exactly you're trying to do here?
The best solution might be a different data structure but we'd really
need to understand what the tables represent.

Do you have indexes on column2 and column3 on each of the tables?

The output of explain would probably be helpful.  Just put the word
"explain" before the select.

Ok,

IF you want anyone to be able to help you out, you're going to have to 
give us some of the details of your particular problem, or a least some 
table schema.

That said, you might want to look into turning your inner joins into 
LEFT JOINs with the WHERE clauses moved into ON clauses for the joins, I 
suspect that this will yield a large speed increase.

After that I would examine the output of EXPLAIN to check on which 
indexes the query is using, and consider optimizing the table structure 
if this is inefficient.

I noticed that an announcement was posted about LISA 
<http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa04/>, which is taking place in Atlanta 
in November.

Anyone know if there's a Birds of a Feather Session (BoFs) for PHP? If 
there is, I discovered that attendance at the BoFs and vendor exhibition 
is free, so I've decided to go to the exhibition and a BoFs for PHP, if 
one exists.

Message-ID: <417941F2.5040901@nyphp.org>

For the next PHundamentals article, we are exploring best practices in
the use of headers. Previously we examined the issue of headers and
forced file downloads. The issue we would now like to focus on deals
with HTTP Authentication.

PHundamentals Question No. 2:
How are headers used when implementing HTTP Authentication? What are the
security issues? When is it a good time (and bad time) to use HTTP
Authentication? Are there any differences when PHP is running as an
Apache Module or as a CGI? Are there any differences when running on
*nix servers or Windows servers? Our aim, as always, is to arrive at
"best practices" so please be specific as to how your solution is the
optimal solution.

<<When is it a good time (and bad time) to use HTTP Authentication?>>

I would say:

(1) Plain old http authentication, using a flat file for password storage,
is ok if you don't expect much traffic and/or if you're file is small.
Otherwise, it's too inefficient for Apache to scan that whole thing on
every request.

(2) Plain old http authentication is ok if aesthetics and fashion are not
a big concern, because the generic popup window that prompts for
username/password is not particularly exciting to look at.

(3) If what's at state is truly sensitive and a security breech would be
catastrophic, use SSL regardless of the authentication method.

There's no reason to use a flatfile.  Anyone who's serious about using 
HTTP Auth at least uses a DBM.  No arguments with points 2 and 3. :)

Um, that should be Basic with a capital B, apparently. Zounds!

  header( 'WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Members Only" ' );
  header( 'HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized' );

Guess I should RTFM.

While it's true that auth over SSL is the ideal situation, for sites
on a virtual host I find HTTP Digest Authentication to be an
acceptable compromise, and not really any harder to set up in an
.htaccess context.

But I think this is a PHundamental because of PHP's built-in support
for requesting a username and password via Basic Authentication. The
idea is that you put:

   header( 'WWW-Authenticate: basic realm="Members Only" ' );
   header( 'HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized' );

At the top of your script, which causes the browser to cough up one of
those little username/password dialogs. On submit, the request comes
back to your script with $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] and
$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'], as documented in the manual here:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php

So now you can look those up in a MySQL table or something (or DBM if
you like) and allow access or not.

I've always thought it was a silly feature -- why not just code a
login form? But I can see the utility for intranet applications, where
you don't need it to be pretty and you don't need all the "Forgot your
password?" and "Register here" stuff.

I think it's perfectly acceptable on an Intranet to authenticate a 
known user, but obviously not secure enough for sensitive areas on the 
public web.
For non-secure login pages, I guess it's just an easy way to accomplish 
"lite" security.

The questions I ask are, "Is the effort it takes  to breach this 
security  going to be worth it for anyone?" the answer is usually 
clearly yes or no. And of course, "How paranoid are you?" Sounds funny, 
but the answer to this changes depending on the environment (intranet, 
public, wireless) and depending on the data you are hiding.

While it is a step up from clear text, It should be made abundantly 
clear that it is not for purposes of hiding sensitive data from 
hackers.

I don't see two of the biggest differences on anyone's list:

1. With HTTP Authentication, you can't easily make pages that are
accessible to both users that are logged in and users that are not
(with different content for each). It's really meant for pages that
you can either view or not. Technically you could do probably do it
using custom 403 (access denied) pages but that sounds messy.

2. HTTP Authentication is probably more secure than anything you'll
ever write yourself. Especially if you implement it at the server
level (.htaccess) you won't have to worry as much about security holes
in your code :)

I don't think we've yet mentioned one other thing, perhaps because it's so
obvious:

with http authentication, logged-in users can't exactly "log out", they
can only log out de facto by closing the browser, and thereby make it
forget the login credentials it had cached.

Right?

The limitations (can't see safe content, can't logout) are only true
with .htaccess based HTTP Auth. But if you implement it in PHP
instead, you should be able to accomplish both those things using
session vars.

Well, in my case it is certainly more secure than anything I'd write. 
(short pause and burst of laughter)

I might be wrong, but my understanding is:
1. basic auth sends password in clear
2. sends them every request making it easy for sniffers
3, digest auth does not send password but content can still be swiped

from:   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt
    "The Digest Access Authentication scheme is not intended to be a
    complete answer to the need for security in the World Wide Web. This
    scheme provides no encryption of message content. The intent is
    simply to create an access authentication method that avoids the most
    serious flaws of Basic authentication."

I meant secure as in if you leave it up to the web server to ask for
user/pass (and not directly in your PHP) then the code in apache that
does the authentication is probably pretty good.

If on the other hand you're just using a normal form for the user and
password, there are probably more ways a hacker could get around it,
especially for beginning programmers.

Regarding sniffing the user/pass, in both cases it's clear text unless
you use SSL.

You can use digest auth, that doesn't involve transmitting your 
password, just a hash of it.

That's a pretty strong statement, but I think I understand what you're
saying. Is your point that implementing HTTP Authentication is more secure
in terms of access control? I agree with that, since your own
implementation could have flaws in that regard.

I think saying HTTP Authentication is more secure is a bit misleading,

Perhaps it could be mentioned that if you use prepends or includes, 
it might be wise to put in a check to see if the headers have 
already been sent. Otherwise with error notification turned down low,   
you might miss the fact that the headers you are trying to send 
are not going out. Something like:

if (headers_sent($filename, $linenum)) {
   trigger_error( "Problem: Headers already sent in $filename on line
$linenum ");
   exit;
} 

header( 'whatever...

And further it could be pointed out that it is a 
*bad* practice (worse than usual) to use PHP versions 
before 4.3.4, if you plan to use headers_sent.

see:
 http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=25701 

(if you move up to PHP 5 and you could use headers_list 
http://us2.php.net/headers_list to see what's going on --  
or will go on -- with headers)

I think it's a good feature, although I rarely ever use it myself. Here
are a few reasons, off the top of my head:

1. You can protect static resources like HTML, images, etc.
2. It's quick and easy to implement for existing content, whether static
or dynamic. Any solution is sometimes better than no solution, and there
are many situations that might require such a thing.
3. You can protect any collection of content that can be identified in
httpd.conf (using a number of different approaches).
4. The access control is mature and well-tested - you can be certain that
any resource protected with HTTP Authentication will require the
authentication credentials (and not be forgotten by a sloppy developer).

Feel free to add to the list. :-)

Yeah, but the reasons you gave mostly apply to using HTTP
Authentication via Apache directives.

I thought that the issue here is HTTP Authentication implemented via
PHP header() functions, which is listed as a "feature" of PHP in the
manual:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php

In that case:

1. You are only protecting scripts that implement authentication, not
the static contents of directories
2. It *is* quick and easy.
3. If you also implement authentication in httpd.conf, you'll have to
use exactly the same password database in your PHP scripts
4. The access control is implemented by you -- possibly not as secure
or well-tested as Apache's.

Very true. I agree with your points in the context of using header() to
implement this. I suppose I was unknowingly drifting off-topic (I should
have read all of the threads first). :-)

Could be a bug, but RFCs are often buggy themselves  :)

The argument, I suppose, of IE's behavior is related to the "Cause"
subheading in the Microsoft article, above.  An HTML file is only loaded
into memory, while an Office or some other "out-of-process, ActiveX
document server" type of file needs to be stored on disk temporarily.
So, it's not a difference in the MIME type at the HTTP level, but in the
way the OS needs to deal with the file.  Actually, the behavior is
exactly the same for Mozilla, et al (they need to write the downloaded
file to a temporary file), though they don't have this behavior, even
with SSL.

Six, half dozen the other...

You may be exactly right, in that they are confused with the difference
between no-cache and no-store.  Then again, I think sometimes the RFC
confuses them.

With Firefox 1PR1 this actually has gone away, even with old versions of

I think John was working on something like this, and I hope to have it
on nyphp.org at some point soon.

Basically, all public NYPHP lists can be filtered in two ways.  The
first is to filter on the To or Cc header of the email.  They will go to
the name of list, at the lists.nyphp.org domain.  So for example, for
this list, you'd put everything with talk at lists.nyphp.org into a
separate mail folder, as I do.

The other way is to use the subject.  The subject of every mail uses the
list name surrounded by brackets.  So, for the NYPHP-Org list, you could
filter the subject on [nycphp-org].

As someone mentioned, there is a memory limit directive in php.ini that
could eliminate this error right off the bat.

That sounds about right.  You could use the LIMIT clause, although there
is a chance that you get the same row twice.  This might happen if a
DELETE/INSERT happens during your routines.  The other way to do it
would be to use a range of the primary key, or even an alphabetic range
(all 'a' users, then 'b', etc).

They do, but 6000 isn't really that much.  You could SELECT the users in
chunks, per above.

If you set the same variable to another value, and it's not referenced
from anywhere else, the Zend Engine should free the old memory block.
This applies to scalar variables and arrays, but NOT objects, or even
within objects and their properties, AFAIK (assuming this is PHP 4).

The simple answer is to stay away from objects - they will eat memory,
unless numerous confusing ampersands are used.  I'd do this from a
simple function (not a method).  If you're using PHP 5, then this isn't
so much a concern.  Also, if this is MySQL you could use
mysql_unbuffered_query(), or mysqli_use_result() if it's MySQL 4.1.
That said, depending on how you're handling your PHP variables, this
might not make a difference at all.

Exactly; this PHunny regards HTTP auth as a PHP feature, per:

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php

This eliminates the need for any .htaccess or other Apache directives,
logout is possible, and the user database could be anything that PHP can
speak to.  The headers and logic are controlled entirely in PHP.

And according to the link above (the first line of the page):

"The HTTP Authentication hooks in PHP are only available when it is
running as an Apache module and is hence not available in the CGI
version."

Also, as I read through that page, the number of "Notes", "Configuration
Note", "Compatibility Note", and so forth subheads, quickly lends me to
think it's hard to determine a good time to use them.  I suppose for a
quick and dirty auth system, they are built in and handy, but then so is
.htaccess.

Lastly, the plain-text password issue isn't related to HTTP auth.  If
you create an extremely wonderful PHP solution (that doesn't use the
HTTP auth headers), and it's over HTTP versus HTTPS, your password is
just as clear as ever.

So, at the end of the day, with the advent of sophisticated web
languages like PHP, I think HTTP auth headers are antiquated.

A third way is to use the list-id header which all civilized mailing 
list managers should support (alternatively, there's the mailing-list 
header). This lists list-id header looks like:

List-Id: 	NYPHP Talk <talk.lists.nyphp.org>

I sort on the list-id (or the mailing-list header) into a folder 
specific to that mailing list and then read through each list, catching 
up as time permits.

Yes, I have been working on this. I had Firefox filters set up, and
discovered problems with consistency of config of the TO From and CC
fields. Since I like to have certain PHP "people" filtered into individual
folders, and lists in their own folders, it is necessary to keep "peple"
who send to lists separate from the messages those same people send to me.

Some changes were made and now (understandably) my set up is hosed ;-(

If all of the lists are stable and following a convention utilizing
list-named FROM, REPLY TO, or CC fields, I can revisit this and straighten
it out. It will be a web doc. I'd like to avoid using combinatorial logic
in the filters.

The "subject" line is unreliable, as some "people" will forward a message
from a list to me *directly*, preserving a list-like subject field, yet
that message would not belong in the lists folder but in the person's
folder. I also noticed some inconsistency withthe way different lists
handle "OT" and "Re:" in the subject line.

I gues sit is time to revisit and document the current status for all
lists, and see where we are with it.

A third way is to use the list-id header which all civilized mailing 
list managers should support (alternatively, there's the mailing-list 
header). This lists list-id header looks like:

List-Id: 	NYPHP Talk <talk.lists.nyphp.org>

I sort on the list-id (or the mailing-list header) into a folder 
specific to that mailing list and then read through each list, catching 
up as time permits.

What is everyone's threshold of pain concerning the length of a talk?

Yes, that's a loaded question. Geoff and I have been doing a lot of work
lately with the Apache-Test framework and PHP, and we've got a lot to talk
about.

Also, are there any PHPUnit or Simple Test experts (or moderates) who plan
to be in attendance? I know some Perl people are showing up, so this might
be a good chance to exchange ideas and methodologies.

You mean, with no beer and no food? I can take 1.5 to 2 hours easy.

Don't suppose anyone is willing to videotape and encode for those of
us who can't make it?

1.5-2 hrs sounds good if it is meaty, with good examples, less if it
is more of an overview type of talk.

I'd rather hear an interesting talk than be poisoned at Friday's
anytime, but that's damning with very faint praise...

I think our threshold is pretty high...

If there's a lot of good in-depth stuff, that'd be great.  Of course,
I'm sure any presentation you guys come up with will be fine.

So the reason for my gibberish above is not about *our* threshold, but
rather IBM's threshold (and Krook, correct me if I'm wrong).  We
officially start at 6:30 but people are late so we don't really get
rolling until 6:40.  As far as I know, IBM needs us out by 8:30.  We'll
probably need around 15-20 minutes for giveaways and miscellaneous
chatter, so that math ends up basically being the threshold.  Again,
Krook/DeWitt, let me know if these number are off...

Well, if Perl folks are showing, we'll need about 8 hours to discuss
things :)  Oh right, there's Jeff's favorite, TGI Fridays, and a bar
afterwards  :)

There's more "in-depth" than there is flair at this point, but I think
this audience will appreciate it. :-)

Yikes! We might have to cut some stuff.

Yeah, Apress sent me some stuff to give away in addition to whatever you
guys already have.

4:30 might be the real threshold. :-)

I wouldn't worry too much about a strict 8:30 cutoff, there isn't anyone 
else that uses the room after us.  That said, 10pm would be pushing it :)

I'd be more concerned about audience patience, TGIF's kitchen closing and 
Knight's liver growling.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Idea for PHP site (series of articles)
Message-ID: <f1dc81bb04102520473a98e200@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've been playing around in my head with some ideas for a web site
about using PHP.
Unlike most other sites, it won't have (almost) any PHP in it.

Most of the sites I see have mostly articles that deal with "how do I
use function ABC" or "how do I solve problem XYZ  in PHP".
I've been interacting with various other PHP developers quite a lot
over the past couple of years and feel that there is a big issue most
other sites don't seem to really tackle.

How to become a good PHP programmer.

I know that "really good" isn't well defined but I think you get the point.
I can't help but noticing some of the questions and example code
people ask about.
For example, I just saw this questions a couple of days ago:
http://www.experts-exchange.com/Web/Web_Languages/PHP/Q_21070233.html

I'm thinking of something that doesn't explain so much the "what" as
the "why" (and hope that the what naturally follows).

So, am I barking up the wrong tree?

Comments ?

Ophir

My liver is accustomed to the abuse, but TGIF's kitchen closing can
only be a good thing.

I personally think it's a good idea, but a hard task to tackle.  These
things in my opinion come in time, but if you were to accomplish this
goal I'd definetly be a visitor of the site.

Maybe you could turn it around a little
'How to become a better programmer using PHP'  

Good programmers are like good cabinetmakers; 
and good programs are like well made cabinets -- 
useful and sturdy.

When you build a cabinet you can use a 
measured drawing or you can improvise. 

But usually it is not a clear cut 'either/or'  
situation. Many times, depending on your skill 
and experience, you can produce a variation of 
a blueprint which is tailored to the final 
installation ? la 'built-in' cabinets. 

When you improvise like this, it is quite beneficial 
to know the structural characteristics of your 
materials before deciding how to 'join the pieces' 
together. 

In this context, the 'nuts and bolts' of PHP are 
really more than just fasteners.

I hear there's a pretty good site called nyphp.org (-: Granted it's got a
lot of PHP in it, but I wonder if there's room for a series of
essays/articles along the lines you describe. In fact Tim Gales just

I'm still not sure of the best place to publish my articles, or under
what license, but back to the subject, any more thoughts on the
question itself ?

Maybe such articles already exist I just haven't found em yet?
Maybe most people are indeed just looking for quick and dirty answers
to specific questions?

Any more comments on the idea itself ?

Also, as a side note to Tim, I also have a tendency to use analogies
but usually use something more complex than just cabinets. I like to
compare creating applications to creating a house or building :)

So then.... are your classes the cabinets? Or would that be the database?

Anyway, like Hans said, if you're interested in writing about
programming practices, you'll find a receptive audience (and helpful
editors) at NYPHP.

Anyone recall whether the IBM conference room has audio? It's not

That sounds like a good idea. I'd be glad to give you space on one of my 
servers for your site. You could code it all by hand or I could set you 
up a wiki to post on. That way you could let others post similar 
articles to the site. If you have a domain name you could point it at 
the site - otherwise I'd just make up a domain name for you.

Certainly a noble proposal, but is it doable?

That example you linked to... wow. It appears the poster had a 
functional requirement (use a form to select a stylesheet) but little 
concept of procedural programming. Therefore she brute-forced her way 
through a long script.

No concept of model/test program development, and an obvious lack of 
awareness of conditionals/flow control structures.  The first is the 
larger problem, IMHO. Why would anyone type out 83 sets, when developing 
a script?

So is this a PHP programmer needing training on how to be a better PHP 
programmer? I don't think so. Anyone can insert PHP code, but that does 
not a PHP programmer make (?)

Now writing code examples that are well-documented and thus didactic... 
that is a good idea. I'd start with foreach().... conceptually is can be 
a bear for the newbie (even anewbie with good concept of 
procedurealprogrammer and flow control).

Obviously, this person knows nothing about data structures beyond using 
variables (not to mention many other programming constructs!) and is 
probably sick of answering questions like "why did you write it this 
way?". As John already hinted at, the example cited is not a good 
example because that person hasn't got past the basics yet...

Dont get me wrong, I think something along the line of PHP "best 
practices" would be quite useful.

I think good PHP programming needs to build on top of good generic 
programming skills.

I wholeheartedly agree.  It's the reason a lot of us, over time, end up
using 3 or 5+ languages regularly and fluently.  The theory and the patterns
behind the languages generally carry over.  After learning 2 languages well,
including best practices and tweaks, all we need is a reference manual for
the 'vocabulary' and basic formatting (brackets, indentation, etc) and we
can move forward in almost any programming language.

I've always felt a useful site would be one that takes on each topic and
applies a multitude of languages and perspectives, in order to show the
basic idea behind the topic (basics like loops and conditions and
application concepts like shopping carts and content management) and show
how they carry over, while remaining similar.

As far as the well beaten cabinets analogy is concerned, you don't start
over when you change your wood and tools, you apply your previous knowledge
of the wood and similar tools with variation to make a good solid cabinet.

The best place for such information would more likely be the

Just wanted to post a "thanks" to the NYPHP group. PHP is a cool, fun language that I've been trying to learn for some time. In addition to work stresses, we've moved, changed jobs, had a dear pet nearly die, and a few volunteer projects I help with have been needing attention.

Lately, everytime I've come here to ask a question I've been under one deadline or another. And every time I've gotten a good answer that fixed my immediate problem. And at no time have i gotten guff for my question, even when I wrote too fast and failed to provide enough good info.

Just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate it.

ciao!

Geoff has posted our slides from last night's talk as well as a tarball
that you can play with:

http://www.modperlcookbook.org/~geoff/slides/nyphp/

I hope everyone enjoyed the talk. There was a lot to talk about, so I know
it was hard to follow everything, especially since this is all very new
(even if you do a lot of testing already). Hopefully reviewing these
slides will help, and I plan to generate some better documentation once
we're further along.

If you want to play with the tarball, just follow the steps in the INSTALL
file (it even gives you an example set of steps for installing Apache with
PHP, which you can probably skip). The sample application lives in
t/htdocs, and the tests are all *.t files within t. Examples of tests
written in PHP exist within t/response/TestFunctions.

Lastly, as I've looked more into Simple Test and PHPUnit, these seem to
only be simplistic functions that can help you write unit tests (similar
to Test::More in Perl), but they provide no automated way to run these
tests nor an easy way to create a good test environment that resembles
production (testing from the command line? Yuck!). I'm not suggesting that
they've ever claimed to be more - I just wasn't sure. Until now, they've
been our best options for testing PHP applications, but no longer. :-)

Because PHPUnit and Simple Test seem like good approaches to unit testing,
and because there are likely many developers who have a lot of tests
already written in these, I will probably write a compatability layer that
implements the same tests but with Test::More compatible output, so that
people can easily port tests to the Apache-Test framework.

There seem to be problems with IE (shock!).

You're not alone.  Many, including myself, have been through this with
IE & SSL also.

Try dropping this into your apache config:
    SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
    SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP

See:

There are definitely problems with IE with the default SSL settings in
Apache. 

Try changing the SSLCipherSuite line to:

SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP

Message-ID: <20041029025731.GA5408@panix.com>

Hey Folks:

mysqldump -A will export all of the databases.  But, what if I want to 
exclude a particular database?  Is it possible?  How, please?

I looked at the documentation and the --help output.  I'm hoping 
there's an undocumented option. :)

Thanks,

Is there a way to A) list all the databases (databasi?), B) run the
output through 'grep -v' and then C) mysqldump the result?

Assuming your db password is mypass, and the database you want to 
exclude is test, the following should do the trick:

mysql --password=mypass -B --skip-column-names -e'SHOW DATABASES' | grep 
-v 'test' | xargs -n 1 "mysqldump" "--password=mypass" > nottest.sql

Here's some quick bash for that:
    for TABLE in $(echo "show tables" | mysql -u <username> -p'<password>' <database> | grep -v Tables_in_ | grep -v <some_table_to_exclude>)
    do
       mysqldump -u <username> -p'<password>' <database> ${TABLE}
    done

...replace things in angle brackets.  That could certainly be wrapped in a
shell script w/ proper params and stuff, but I'm leaving that to you.

HTH,
Andrew

Come to think of it, you could do this:

ls -al $mysql_dir  | grep ^d  | egrep -v '\.[\.]?' | grep -v $test | awk '{
mysqldump $9 }' | sh

where $mysql_dir is the directory wherein your mysql databases reside
and $test is the directory/database you don't want.

For those of you who don't read shell, the command line reads:

list all files in the mysql directory | show only the
directories/databases | do not show the . and .. directories | don't
show the $test directory/database | print out the statement "mysqldump
directory" |  pass those strings to the shell for execution.


Simple, no? :-)

It is if you speak shell, but the drawback is still that you execute 
mysqldump multiple times.  If you look at my previous email, I figured 
out a way to execute mysqldump only once to dump all of the required 
databases.

Whoops... thats for excluding tables, not databases.  Try:
    for DB in $(echo "show databases" | mysql -u <username> -p'<password>' | grep -v Database | grep -v <some_db_to_exclude>)
    do
        mysqldump -u <username> -p'<password>' ${DB}
    done

Same rules apply.

HTH more,

Suppose you have a form with a textfield for people to enter a string to
search for in your database, and you don't want people using % or _ unless
they mean it literally. This is kind of ugly:

$input =  preg_replace('/(%|_)/',"\\\\$1",$input);
$input = mysql_escape_string($input);

Is this more or less what you should do, or is there a classier solution
that I'm overlooking?

David,

Why not just the latter (the mysql_escape_string()) ... if that doesn't take care of %'s and _'s (not sure off the top of my head), then what you've got seems to take care of everything...

Unless I am completely missing something?

I prefer str_replace() to preg_replace(), but this is essentially what
I do. Use the feature which allows you to pass multiple search/replace
pairs as arrays to reduce this to one call.

Somehow this seems missing from PHP Cookbook. I will add it list of
things for the 2nd Edition.

Can you explain what mysql_escape_string() isn't escaping?

Yes, we want a recipe in the 2nd edition. :-)

I am currently looking for a very good CMS that has
good colloboration functionality to build a web site
from. I am looking for a cms that is very customizable
and modular with good performance and security.

The following are the CMSs I am looking into so far.
XARAYA, PHPNUKE, MAMBO, TIKIWIKI...

Just starting out with PHP so I dont have much experience
with programming. I am hoping to get some feedback/suggestion
from folks that have worked with the above CMS or others worth
considering - Thanks!

Yes. It doesn't escape % or _.

I hear people sing the praises of Drupal, but I've never seen "PHP CMS"
and "security" used in the same sentence without the word "vulnerability".

An excellent resource for research is OpenSourceCMS:

     http://www.opensourcecms.com/

As a core developer on mambo, I am unabashedly biased ;-)

Functionality-wise, the king of the hill IMHO is plone, but also has
the greatest complexity and performance requirements (dual processor
machine with >1GB RAM is minimal for a serious site).  After that it
becomes a pick-your-poison type of exercise.

You must weigh the importance of simplicity, ease of installation,
features and 3rd party availability in your decision accordingly. I
joined the mambo team because I felt they had the cleanest/easiest
administration interface, and the most active 3rd party community (for
add-ons and extraneous goodies).  Write me directly for any background
information on the latest developments, as I believe you may find them
interesting.

Just make sure that the CMS you choose has a good active community
behind it, and a dedicated team of developers working on the core; and
you will be assured that your CMS will be able to grow with you.

Since you seem to be using MySQL, and are searching for textual data,
you might want to look into MySQL's fulltext search.

If you're doing LIKE searches, a fulltext search could be a better solution.

Could you give us some more details on the data people can search?

Yeah, what he said. Also last I looked Plone was written in Python not 
PHP, and fluency in the native language of the app gives a major 
advantage when working with large, complex apps (IMHO this is especially 
true with Plone).

I suggest you look again at why you need security, and be very, very 
specific. You may find the CMS is fine for you, or that you can modify 
your intended use a bit to alleviate concerns.

Hey David:

Do note, the official way to escape items in a LIKE clause is:

   select * from FOO where cf like 'a^%%' escape '^'

Security is going to be a trick...

Don't use PHPNUKE - in fact, don't use anything with the word "nuke" in
it...

http://oscom.org can also be a resource.  It's generally a matter of
trial and error, but I can say Mambo, Midgard, eZ Publish, Drupal have a
generally good reputation.

Another thing to keep in mind is cost.  If you're willing a little,
you'll probably end up with a solid CMS.

PHP 5 is often compared to Java because of its attempts at a correct
object model.  But this story, below, is a different take I haven't yet
seen, as it's likened to ASP.NET

While it is certainly a different take., what is the author's point? 
"Some developers know more than one language and platform?"  Big Deal.
What would be interesting is if PHP could be compiled into .NET 
bytecode the way javascript, VB and C# are. But I'll bet that'll happen 
with the Java virtual machine first.

I guess it only makes sense, but I wasn't expecting it.

You mean you can read a cookie from the same server that sets it? :-)

There is no way to restrict a cookie to a specific port, unless that's
part of the Cookie2 spec (which isn't really supported anyway).
