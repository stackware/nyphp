Aren't some of you breaking the law by suggesting actual amounts to charge for specific work?

That's exactly right.
 
Most of my projects are done a &quot;cost for project&quot; basis.
 
Often I figure out how much time the project will take me and then I 
provide the client with a &quot;project cost&quot;, which usually looks like a 
better deal for them because I *do* charge $100 per hour.
 
For example, I'm current working on a project that if I spent all my 
time (100%) working on it I probably could have it done in two weeks. 
That would be $8K at $100 per hour.
 
However, in this case (which is more often than not) I determined 
that the client can't be ready in that length of time -- they simply 
don't have the graphics, text, and money. So, I provide a quote 
saying I can finish the project within two months at cost of $10k. 
That gives them time to get things together and gives me room to fit 
their project in to my schedule.
 
If they come back and negotiate, then I have $2k of wiggle room. 
However most of the time, clients jump at the &quot;project cost&quot; for they 
feel that two months is much longer than 100 hours so they are 
getting something additional. Realize that often it perception and 
flexibility that you sell, not programming. In any event, the 
arrangement presents a win-win situation -- and that's what you want.
 
So, when the client has the money, I take 50% up-front and the 
remainder when the project is finished. It sounds reasonable to the 
client and works most of the time for me.
 
Now, what I *also* do in these cases is to stay with the client until 
they get what they want. This conduct will provide me with favor, 
which results in more work from both the client and their friends. 
Word of mouth means a lot!
 
Sometimes, this means spending up to 50% more time than expected 
without billing for extras. However, at some point, the client should 
come to a realization what the scope of the project was at the 
beginning and what it turned into. Most clients realize what &quot;feature 
creep&quot; is and you can come to a reasonable solution as to how to deal 
with it.
 
If you run into an unreasonable client (rare), then it's best to take 
whatever was outstanding and walk away -- don't do the court thing. 
As for an unreasonable example, I had one client who offered to pay 
me $50 *per week* until the project was finished as he kept adding 
things as if this project was a software buffet. I walked and left 
the remaining 50% payment plus the 150% effort on the table. In this 
case, I made $33 per hour on a failed project. Not good, but not so 
bad either.
 
The bottom line is to determine what the client wants and work their 
needs to your advantage. It may sound like you're taking advantage of 
them, but clients seldom understand and often underestimate what you 
do and that is taking advantage of you. In the end, work the system 
to provide quality service for reasonable pay.
 
Cheers,
 
tedd

</I> 
Hi Anthony,
 
This is impossible to answer without intimate knowledge of the product
(and I apologize in advance for saying I don't care to know).
 
But if the M/O of the product is your typical business application
running as an HTTP service accessed by potentially many clients, then
the low end would probably be around $500 USD. That's about what it
takes to cover the costs of just helping people get setup and
collecting payment. If the product is a little side component like a
plugin for something then you might make it less but your margins in
this case are going to be poor. If you're app is something small and
you're thinking about a price like $100 or less, don't waste your
time. You need to write something that is useful enough to reach that
$500 range. If the application is really good and solves an important
business need, it is not unreasonable to charge $10,000 or an annual
fee of $1500 or so (but my guess is that you're not in this upper
range because it would probably be something that requires a
significant amount of man hours in which case you would have one
product and not three). Again it really depends a lot on what the
product does and how well it does it. If your software is really good
at something, customers will gladly buy it and they will not care much
if it's $200 or $500. Most developers / operators are not paying for
this stuff themselves. They're just doing an evaluation and submitting
a purchase order. You have to get to about $1000 before someone is
going to ask &quot;why?&quot;.
 
And of course customers are going to expect a trial package that
doesn't cost anything. And customers demand options. You must have a
trial version that costs $0. And even after the trial expires I
recommend leaving that installation functional in some limited way. Of
course you can also have a version limited to a certain number of
users say for $300 as opposed to a &quot;platinum&quot; version for $600 or
whatever. I provide a lot of pricing options. I have a separate
&quot;confidential&quot; document for each product that I attach to every sales
email query which describes all of the pricing options about
discounts, the cost of versions limited to a certain number of users,
reseller conditions and so on. You can make a lot more money if the
options are structured well. For example, I have a simple formula (and
corresponding easy to read price table) that increases the discount as
the number of installations goes up. I think this scheme alone has
accounted for significantly larger invoice prices.
 
Another thing you can do is to make the debut price less than the
ultimate target price to leave room for increases. After a few months
when you have a better idea of who the customer's are, what they want
and the product has matured a little, you can decide to go higher
depending on the software's popularity, the economy, etc. Then when
you do a major revision 2 years later maybe you increase again.
 
Good luck,
 
Mike

To sum up my response to Mike, this is why I'm a big believer in Software as a Service (SaaS). Built it once, sell to many.
