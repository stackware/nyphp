<PRE>Ed,

The reality of this economy is that small &amp; medium sized businesses ARE 
NOT GOING TO PAY more than $2,000 a week for an engineer.

If you disagree, I mean, that's great, I'd love to make twice that but 
the reality is that if I ask for $4,000 a week, I'm going to be looking 
for work for A LONG TIME.  And $2,000 in US cash is worth far more than 
$4,000 in my fantasy world of what I'd &quot;like to earn&quot;.

I'll even take $6,500 a month on occasion if the project is for someone 
I want to help.  I think that it's great to aim higher, I am all in 
favor of making the bucks, but in this economy $8,000 a month is A LOT 
in these company's minds.

I agree if someone is getting jerked around and asked for &quot;small 
updates&quot; (which I don't waste time with, I take on larger projects in 
the area of $5,000 + only), then yeah.  But the reality is, $8,000 a 
month is what people earn.   This is provable, this is reality, and 
fantasizing about making what lawyers make isn't going to change that 
reality.
