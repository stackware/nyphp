<PRE>Bruce,

Also, please bear in mind that 95% of the budget on these &quot;big 
redesigns&quot; goes to non-technical persons (management, artists, and 
various hangers-on).   For systems consulting, say, you know, where it's 
just for a few hours or a day or two, and someone restores data and/or 
deals with a hardware emergency, then yes, $90/hr or even $100/hr is 
common.   Major league Sys Admins and DBAs can also score that much.

But at $50/hr, that comes to $2,000+ a week or about $9000+ a month 
(depending on how many hours you can get per week).  For a humble 
programmer of PHP that is about as good as it gets, unfortunately.  I've 
been consulting in the NYC market for over 10 years, BTW, and also was 
on the sales end placing consultants for several years during the middle 
of the last decade, so I know what rates really are...

Stand your ground on a reasonable rate as long as you can; the forces at 
work to undercut us and reduce our income are relentless and brutal.  
Yes, you as a programmer do deserve to make a decent living, no matter 
what you are told by people looking to save a buck or two.  Good luck!!

Kristina
