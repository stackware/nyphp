<PRE>So what your saying is after your QS person finds issues, they go into the code/design and fix it themselves??

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] How much is a site redesign worth? 

The decision on what to build comes down from on high where some confab of management pinheads make decisions based on &quot;wow this will make us rich if we hire some cheap labor to build it for us&quot; and &quot;my Uncle Frank told me PHP was the way to go while we were golfing last week&quot;. 

The tech lead then assembles a team of inexperienced, cheap programmers (because management has decided the budget, too) who crank out a horrifying batch of really awful code that kind of looks like it might do what management requested be built, with the tech lead taking all the credit for anything good that might happen along the way, and blaming the programmers he personally likes the least for whatever bad things inevitably occur. 

This poo poo stew then gets dumped into the lap of our hapless &quot;QA Analyst&quot; who is expected to work a miracle on par with parting the Red Sea by turning it into Tasty Texas Chili for distribution to the masses.

But, I guess you can look at senior devs/leads as the architect of the house, and your the house inspector. 


Get what I mean? Not saying one out weighs the other, just one is more involved in architecture, and the other is involved in making sure it meets city requirements aka business reqs.

You are wrong. The work of a qa analyst is alot simpler. You don't need to do 
any architecture based on traffic retention, judge framework usage etc. 

Not in my QA world....
