<PRE>Kristina,
Ok now I get where you are coming from, see we where taking about 2
different situations, I very rarely take jobs that require me to go into the
clients office for X amount of time every day. 

I like to take projects I will give the client an estimated date of
completion and update him accordingly. So if it takes me 3 weeks or 3 months
the quote that I gave him stands unless he asks for extra features. I live
in Long Island so for me to go into the city for less then $75 per hour is
not really worth it cause I have to account for the 2.5 hour commute time
every day that's over 12 per week that I'm loosing, I know a lot of people
don't count their commute time cause that's just part of the job, but I take
everything into account when taking a job, hey that time is time that I
could be spending with my family and that's worth a lot more then $75 per
hour.

But again to each its own, it seems like you are doing well and are happy
with your rates and many others here who are charging more are doing well
and happy also. So I guess the lesson here is that there is a market for
every one. One thing though, one reason why I don't charge less and always
try to stand my ground is because some time back when I used to charged less
some companies actually wouldn't hire me because they thought that since I
wasn't charging them as much I probably was not as good!! Go figure, ones I
raised my rates I got more jobs :) people are strange.

ER

Ed,

The reality of this economy is that small &amp; medium sized businesses ARE 
NOT GOING TO PAY more than $2,000 a week for an engineer.

If you disagree, I mean, that's great, I'd love to make twice that but 
the reality is that if I ask for $4,000 a week, I'm going to be looking 
for work for A LONG TIME.  And $2,000 in US cash is worth far more than 
$4,000 in my fantasy world of what I'd &quot;like to earn&quot;.

I'll even take $6,500 a month on occasion if the project is for someone 
I want to help.  I think that it's great to aim higher, I am all in 
favor of making the bucks, but in this economy $8,000 a month is A LOT 
in these company's minds.

I agree if someone is getting jerked around and asked for &quot;small 
updates&quot; (which I don't waste time with, I take on larger projects in 
the area of $5,000 + only), then yeah.  But the reality is, $8,000 a 
month is what people earn.   This is provable, this is reality, and 
fantasizing about making what lawyers make isn't going to change that 
reality.
