Hi,
I've read your interesting article:
http://www.nyphp.org/phundamentals/5_Storing-Data-Submitted-Form-Displaying-Database

I have a couple of questions about the function fix_magic_quotes:
1) Why do you disable magic_quotes_gpc and magic_quotes_sybase via
ini_set? Fixing the content escaped by magic quotes should be enough
in my opinion, am I wrong?

2) As far as I know, stripslashes is affected by magic_quotes_sybase,
s  if magic_quotes_sybase is on, both addslashes and stripslashes work
in a  sybase-style way. For this reason I don't think you need to use
str_replace.

And finally a more general question: are you aware of any method for
un-escaping content based on db-specific escape function? I mean
something  kuje stripslashes but specific so: the counterpart of
addslashes is stripslashes, is there any counterpart  for
mysql_escape_string or for the adodb function qstr or the PDO quote
function?
I know that, in an ideal world, we don't need them but if an
application has been build using a "escape everything" approach and
you need to work with that, you need to unescape content when you
don't use it in a query  and stripslashes doesn't work if you switch
from addslashes to something  like adodb->qstr.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

The article you mentioned is from April 2004, so I could not rely on that.

Starting from PHP 5.4 magic_quotes_gpc has been removed
http://php.net/releases/5_4_0.php

Also since PHP 5, the best way to go is to use PDO prepared statements,
which avoid any double escaping and allows you to connect to different
database, so you don't really need anymore Adodb.

If your database has escaped contents, you can either run a REPLACE query
(to solve definitely the problem on the database) or as you well said use
stripslashes, or a custom function, it depends what you escaped!

Also that I know mysql_real_escape_string it doesn't have any reverse
function, but if you look at the doc, somebody wrote a reverse_escape for
it:
http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php


Hope this was helpful :)

Hi Federico and thanks for your reply.
I know that magic_quotes_gpc has been removed but I bet that most of
the PHP installations use PHP < 5.4. As far as PDO is concerned, yes,
I'm using PDO as well.

> If your database has escaped contents, you can either run a REPLACE query
> (to solve definitely the problem on the database) or as you well said use

No the database has not any escaped contents, the problem is an
application, which, instead of escaping just the content that needed
to be used in a query it:
- escaped everything from GPC, using addslashes
- unescaped content coming from GPC when the content itself needs to
be just displayed, using stripslashes
It worked pretty good but I then switched from addslashes to db
specific functions (namely adodb qstr and PDO quote), the problem is
that stripslashes of course doesn't work anymore and I don't find a
general approach for unescaping (I read the comment on
http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php but it
seems more a hack than a general solution).

Now, I'm wondering if the DB specific escape functions really give
additional values respect to addslashes. This is what you can read on
the PHP Web site but if you read here:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-real-escape-string.html
"Characters encoded are ?\?, ?'?, ?"?, NUL (ASCII 0), ?\n?, ?\r?, and
Control+Z. Strictly speaking, MySQL requires only that backslash and
the quote character used to quote the string in the query be escaped.
mysql_real_escape_string() quotes the other characters to make them
easier to read in log files."

it seems that, if we are talking about queris execution, just  \ and '
needs to be escaped.

What do you think about?

Chris Shiflett's article from 2006 had the best argument I've seen on why addslashes is not enough to secure your code.
http://shiflett.org/blog/2006/jan/addslashes-versus-mysql-real-escape-string

Keep a copy of your unescaped data.  Escape it for inserting into the database.  Then take the original unescaped data and do what else you need with it.  If you're ouputting to html, you need to run something like the following on each variable you output:

echo htmlspecialchars((string) $var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');

All you want to escape for MySql is ' and \.
In javascript you have to consider also double quote " and new line \n,
which is equivalent to use semicolon ;
In HTML you want also to be secure from XSS, so you want to use
htmlspecialchars (as Rob said).

Anyway, I'm not sure I understood your problem, so I strongly recommend to
deactivate GPC, which you can do from php.ini, or by stripslashing the
input variables:
http://php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.disabling.php

Instead if your contents is already escaped and your problem is to
un-escape, try to understand how is escaped, then str_replace or
preg_replace will do the job!


And yes, they are workaround :)

magic_* anything is a bad idea - it's an infamous mistake that PHP made.

Explicitly escape what you need, based on the destination the data is going
to.

For databases (MySQL in particular), you must always use the database
specific escaping.  This means mysql_real_escape_string().  This is because
of character encoding.

Yes, you should never need to "unescape" what you read from a database.  And
the problem you're facing here, is exactly why you should use the MySQL
escaping functions, rather than generic magic_*, addslashes, etc.

If you've inherited an application that does this, then it could be painful.
If it were me, I'd first run a script/process to clean up the existing data
as best as possible, and get away from these bad escaping practices.  Then
code the rest of the application correctly, using MySQL's real_escape()
function.

I was following a discussion on stackoverflow and I actually ended up
reading exactly that article. I think it's a very good article and
yes, he explained the advantage of using mysql-real-escape-string.
However, like most of the examples on sql injections I have read, it
focus on a user authentication query which (at least the way I use to
code) I don't think could be affected. Maybe I'm wrong but when I
execute a query looking for a user, I always check if the result is
just one row (as expected), if not I produce an error.
I am sure there are other examples in which the use of addslashes
would be dangerous though.

Yes, I know this is the best practice but changing an old application
is not easy so I was trying to find something having less code impact.

Yes, that's one point, it's not always clear what the escape functions
did (unless you don't want to look inside the PHP source code) :)

The whole charm of using common multmedia standards (specially playing videos) in HTML5 is spoiled now since different browsers support different codecs. So either you have to keep 2 or 3 copies of each video or forced to use Flash format.

Following is link about various video formats, standards and their support in various browsers

What companies like Mozilla fail to consider is that by dancing around
video formats and standards all they do is kill the little guys.

Running anything video related knowdays seems to have too many side costs
to even dream of making it profitable. Unless you are Hulu or netflix of
course.

They should decide on a format (whatever that is) and stick to it for at
least 5 years. Then find an alternative, since I assume there will be a
much better one, and move on keeping backwards compatibility.

If I can download a free media player that plays everyvideo out there, I
would except the latest Firefox to do the same. At least the popular
formats.

Hi!

The reason for Mozilla's dance was that they wanted a video codec to be added 
to HTML5 that is royalty free so that the codec required by HTML5 is as open 
as the standard itself. But first Apple and then Microsoft were strictly 
against that and as usual for monetary reasons. I agree that finally picking 
any one codec is needed, although I'd liked that this doesn't become as a 
barrier of entrance for any new browser vendors. Because they now need to pay 
up in order to support that codec. In all that discussion always keep in mind 
that HTML5 is NOT an approved standard. So why get all worked up about things 
that aren't even final yet. I know that reality is different. The major 
browser vendors already implemented their own interpretation of partial HTML5, 
which is right back to the 'works only on browser X' problems of the past. I 
blame the standards for that, because they (intentionally) only describe the 
markup, but not the end result. As you already pointed out, if you want 
something to look and work the same in every browser use Flash. Unfortunately, 
Flash got a bad rap over the years, partially self-inflicted, but mainly 
because irresponsible web designers plastered page after page with Flash. 
Silverlight never got off the ground and is all but canned by Microsoft. Fast 
forward a year or two when Flash is banned and all you got are a bag of screws 
called HTML5 we will also say goodbye to RIA and cloud apps. That change is 
already done in the mobile area, there you mainly find only fat clients. Even 
popular 'cloud' services require you to download a client app.

As far as ease of use and user experience we are currently making big steps 
backwards.

How many of those fat clients are just wrappers around an HTML5 app?
Phonegap gets a lot of love for making that possible in a
cross-platform way.

Be as pessimistic as you like about HTML5, but the reality is that it
is already possible to use it to create full-featured and powerful RIA
and cloud apps. It's just much easier to market and sell those apps to
the masses when you take the extra step of converting them to native
apps for listing in the various vendor app stores.

And for the vast majority of apps, which will never sell (think
corporate and/or free as in freedom), you never even need to think
about native, because HTML5 is already native to every device you care
about. It already has a wider installed base than Flash or Silverlight
could ever hope for!

Is anyone here still running PHP using mod_cgi on Apache?

If so, you need to read this: http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-03-1

The vulnerability gives an attacker access to your source code, which
may reveal database passwords or implementation details that lead to
further, more serious attacks.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Database Abstraction / ORM
Message-ID: <CAMMfqL1k9Pnzx75cU11Q7ESTuczNhFSHJRCfFrOBz__Qqmx3aw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello PHP Talkers,

How do you guys feel about ORM systems and other database abstraction
layers? I've been working a lot lately with an older version of Kohana
(fun!) and doing a lot of performance optimization. A good chunk of
improvement has come out of removing reliance on the old Kohana ORM and
replacing it with simple mysqli calls. Is there any ORM system out there
that just does it right? Namely, I'd be looking for things like:

1) When I instantiate an object by it's ID multiple times, it doesn't
bother to hit up the database after the first time, but just keeps giving
me copies of the same object

2) Lazy load the object values. There are a number of patterns where I've
seen people instantiate a bunch of objects and then only use a small subset
of them. It would be nice if the object only loaded the data when we try to
reference one of its non-ID properties.

3) Ability to tweak the back end to work with other database systems
(especially Riak, Mongo and Cassandra)

I have had really good luck in the past working with Yii and integrating
with Redis to use their Active Record structure, but I'm not sure of the
performance there. Also, I've been hearing a lot about Doctrine 2 lately
and the necessity of having an extra Data Mapper layer in the middle that
separates the classes and properties from the fields and tables that store
the data.

Let me know what you guys have experienced, and no pressure since this
decision is probably going to affect my sleep and happiness for a few
years!! ;)

Wow, that's pretty cool. My first reaction was pretty strongly against
it... anything that does database voodoo on the fly worries me, but it
allows you freeze the schema or even partially freeze the schema if you are
working on adding new features, it has validation hooks, you can build in
your own mapper, it has event listeners at key points and it looks like it
wouldn't be that hard to adapt it to other data store styles.

Impressive and thanks!

I think that Doctrine is a good alternative, have several features.

http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/index.html

Also have a version for Mongo as Backend

http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/latest/

Another option is Propel, is more simple and fast but not so powerful like
doctrine.

Hi,

I'm one of the Doctrine developers and I can assure you the extra data
mapper you mentioned is easier than you imagine.

There's a reason for that and that's probably what separates the tools
for creating simple websites to huge ones. One simple example is how
you map composite keys, how to deal with inheritance, etc. Trying a
very quick look to RedBeanPHP I couldn't see any of these support.

Also, people tend to compare Doctrine 1 and Doctrine 2. They can't be
compared. The first one implemented ActiveRecord while the second is a
DataMapper. They are fundamentally different and the approaches are
completely different.
Lastly, you may miss the old behaviors that Doctrine 1 had, like
NestedSet, Sluggable, Timestampable, Translatable, etc. You can
achieve the same by incorporating an extension called Gedmo and
available at: https://github.com/l3pp4rd/DoctrineExtensions

If you are using Symfony2, the integration is natural and
configuration is nearly to 0.


Thanks,

One other feature that I would be interested in is friendliness to unit
tests. Is it possible to easily set up faux-objects and pass them around
without having them hit the database? Is it possible to use some of the
more complex fetching and management operations without actually hitting a
real database?

I had a debate on the values of data mapping vs active records a while ago
with a coworker and from my understanding, data mapping isn't so much
"completely different" from the active record approach as it is the next
logical evolutionary step to support the needs of large application
development. A lot of the ideas of data mapping have been filtering their
way back into simpler ORM systems like Yii that still call themselves
"Active Record".

Back to the point, how well does Doctrine 2 play with unit tests?

Personally, I do not like them.  I find that the ORM layers
specifically violate SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and are
usually not worth while.  Instead, I prefer a light weight Data Mapper
layer ( http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html ).  I
usually hard-code SQL in the mapper, but you *could* use an ORM there.
 But the key is to keep it completely separated from the business
objects.  That way your data model is free to evolve independently
from your business objects...

Well, do you really want this all of the time?  I can see cases where
you do want to re-query the database (especially in sensitive
areas)...

Why?  Your business objects should have all the data they need at
creation time.  Otherwise you can wind up in the situation where
objects representing the same state have different states.  Which is
not a good thing...

Unless you're building a project that you want to distribute to
others, I find this a bad feature.  Sure, it's nice to know you can
switch to another storage with a config change.  But practically, how
often do you do that?  And if you do that, you're going to want to
tune your data model specifically towards the strengths of the target
backend.  Otherwise you're constantly stuck with a sub-optimal
solution, and little way out when you need to scale...

That mapper layer is a good thing...  It allows both to vary
independently of each other.  Which avoids un-needed coupling between
the layers.

As far as Doctrine 2 goes, IMHO it's the best layer out there.  I use
it when I have projects that dictate requirements that it helps fill.
But usually, I just use the database specific layer (MySQLi or
MongoDB).

I hope that helps,

Anthony

My issue ends up being that we can't always expect everyone on the team
(it's a pretty large team) to deeply understand the proper way of doing
everything. I want this feature as a way to help prevent people from
shooting themselves in the foot, so yes, I do want this all of the time. I
have seen a lot of code that pretty much assumes the ORM objects are just
like any other variable and the objects can be instantiated very often to
make the logic of a for loop simpler.

See above. Retraining everyone is not an option, and I've seen a lot of
people assume that if they aren't accessing the data, then the object
should be a very cheap call and they instantiate it frivolously. We can all
argue that you need to know your platform in detail in order to really use
it right and it certain things will be better in optimal cases, but these
are the variables I have to work with. The other issue is that at small
scale, most of the time the performance is still quite acceptable, but as
the product grows and the scale grows, these cases become more obvious.
These kind of lazy loads enable me to pass objects around to functions that
may need them, but only incur the database hit if the function does end up
needing them.

At the same time, I do welcome best practice recommendations for myself and
for the rare cases when I get complete control of the architecture and
implementation :)

This isn't so much something that I want to consider as "completely
extensible" or that I would want other people to extend my platform for.
This is because I actually use hybrid MySQL/Mongo/Redis, MySql/Cassandra,
and MySQL/Riak/Redis environments for my projects and I need it to work
that way now. If Doctrine is awesome for all things MySQL, but very painful
to work in Cassandra support, then it wouldn't be my choice for that
project. The fact that it has some Mongo support already is wonderful news!

When working with Mongo, do you just pass around the stdClass / array
representation of the document to do work on it? Do you do anything at the
code level to force a standard attribute list for it?

That does help, quite a bit :-D thanks for the time spent on the reply.

I use the Lithium php framework... so I'll include some notes for your
requirements as it relates to that framework.

On Mon, May 7, 2012 at 8:16 AM, Justin Demaris <justin.demaris at gmail.com>wrote:

I would imagine that most db abstractions won't assume you want to do this
and you'll need to implement it in your application.

In Lithium, your config/bootstrap/cache.php file, you would register a
filter around the Model::find method:

Filters::apply('lithium\action\Dispatcher', 'find', function($self, $params,
$chain) {

// examine the arguments to generate a cache key
// Lithium cache has a "memory" adapter that can be used
// if object found in cache, return
// could also check for a param `$params['cache'] === false` to
// support skipping the cache

$data = $chain->next($self, $params, $chain);

// add storing the data to the cache

return $data;

});

2) Lazy load the object values. There are a number of patterns where I've
> seen people instantiate a bunch of objects and then only use a small subset

With Lithium and MongoDB (I'm not sure about other dbs), the result of the
database call for a list is just a MongoCursor and the "entities" (as
Lithium calls them) are only instantiated when needed.  It does cache those
objects inside the result object.  It is possible to unset that cached
object though and free up memory (I was able to roll out a huge CSV file
this way without using much memory).

3) Ability to tweak the back end to work with other database systems
> (especially Riak, Mongo and Cassandra)


MongoDB support is strong and built-in to Lithium.  It's not too difficult
to roll out adapters for other databases - especially those that operate
over http.  There is a CouchDb adapter included that works this way.

We could debate this point, but I think it's a bit off topic.  My
counter would be simply that "If you can't trust your own developers,
you can't solve any other problems"...

Would you rather train someone and risk they leave, or not and risk they stay?

Well, but I'd counter there that by making things lazy loading, you're
putting a HUGE burdon on your caching layer.  Not only does it need to
know about the normal objects, but also about all the micro-queries
your executing to do the lazy loading.  Which means that when you need
to invalidate the cache for a record, there are hundreds of possible
queries instead of a handful.

Not saying that either approach is right or wrong.  Just that each has
pros and cons.  I'd much rather have a simple, non-lazy loading app
that I needed to scale rather than one with the complexities of lazy
loading...

That's the job that my data mapper does for me.  It takes the stdClass
and maps it to my business objects.  So my business objects have the
enforced properties and schema, and the data mapper does the
translation (knowing about both sides).  Nothing in the model layer or
above (view, controller, etc) has any knowledge of the data storage
format, or how to create the business objects.  That's the role the
data mapper plays in my applications.

Thanks again for the feedback Anthony :) I really have to look into this
Data Mapper approach more. I like the sound of your architecture a lot.

To play perfectly with unit tests, you can use another project under
Doctrine umbrella called DataFixtures.
It allows you to load fixtures and also reference things between the tests.

For a better support around not hitting unnecessarily the database,
Doctrine contains a concept called Proxies (which PHP needs years of
evolution until fully understand and implement a similar support of
interceptors of Java, which can benefit later), which creates
references to existing entities on DB, but not loading them until they
are actually needed.

People don't recognize that PHP sucks at memory management in OO.
No matter how much people complain about it, core doesn't focus into
paradigm in the language, they still want to do all and fail to do at
least one efficiently.
ActiveRecord can't be efficiently implemented in PHP due to that.
Creating records takes tons of resources, which was probably the main
reason why Doctrine 1 failed. You just can't load more than 10k
records. It's just not possible.
That's where DataMapper comes to play and solve most of the issues on this.

It's amazing! =) Try it and please come to talk about it here later.

Any good ORM relies on a UnitOfWork.
Under this concept, you can tell it to "forget" about a certain object
or "know" about an object.
Based on that, both perspectives you mentioned are support.

As I mentioned in the other email, any good ORM tool should deal with
Proxies/References.
If you want to load, or only load partially, you should have this ability.
I disagree with Anthony that is bad. That's the biggest principle to
avoid (and also to cause if misused) the N+1 problem insanely referred
by beginners or ORM haters.

I disagree with you, unfortunately.
The time needed for certain operations using certain DB drivers may be
huge for functional testing purposes.
By tweaking your application environment, you can use sqlite:memory
for testing and mysql in prod, running the tests quicker.
I hate advertising too much, but unfortunately, PHP lacks so much of
good competitors of Doctrine. You can use ORM and ODM mappers and
almost swap one with the other and your application can still run
smoothly.

There's a reason why you need a mapping layer.
Depending of your domain problem, you may want for example different
strategies for inheritance. There're 3 types available, but not all of
them are implemented by D2. Class Table Inheritance, Single Table
Inheritance and Concrete Table Inheritance. You can read more about
them at PoEAA of Martin Fowler's book. Each type has pros and cons.
Also, associations may map to a composite foreign-key, you also have
locking strategies to play, etc. All these things must be taken into
account and are not trivial to be done without a mapping layer.

Hi all,

So, in a mix of rant-and-feedback-gathering - is it just me, or have
browsers largely gone downhill in the last few months?

Chrome:  freezes continually with 1mb view source.  Seems more worried about
trying to get me to login to the mothership and track my social networks,
than actually being a browser that can download text from a web server.
And, if I would so happen to want to reload a page (crazy, right?), it's so
hell-bent on caching everything that I have to restart it to see any new
content - control-r, forget about it.  Guess they want their browser to be
"fast" :)

Firefox:  what happened to my friend?!?  Great, now we get a new release
every few minutes, but it crashes, can't correctly repost a form (everything
is always expired), view source hangs or won't display the source of a POST,
and it won't even copy the HTML out of Firebug into a text editor...
control-c doesn't capture anything!  Not to mention it's using 800mb of my
RAM and renders pages about as quick as a 286.

IE9:  so, disable cache for all requests; that's handy.  Fast, but will
actually re-request the page from the server when told to do so.  Developer
tools aren't great, but it's not using 1gb of RAM either.  View source is,
eh, well...

These are all the latest version of these browsers.  Though right now the
best I've found is:

wget -O - test.site/something | less

So that I can actually see what the server is spitting back - and it works
like a charm :)

So am I missing something here, or... anyone else having these types of
problems (more so) of late?

Big picture, things are great -- html5 / css3 support, much better
cross-browser rendering than we've ever had, developer tools in
consumer builds.

But yeah, Firefox has been a mess recently. And Chrome breaks things
then fixes them from release to release -- especially around
content-editable support.

Firefox is probably one of the better browser out there still.  If you are
experiencing crashes, this most likely indicates corrupted profile -- this
occurs often during upgrades, but there many factor why it would go
corrupt.  Try creating a new profile and see how this affects it.

Here is my OSX user experience, I was using Firefox for inspect/debugging
web page, it's good but too over-bloated with functionalities and plugins.
I recently found my nirvana in Chrome, clean and fast.
Safari is the Zen for sailing the interweb.

That spot will always be held by IE 5 for Mac, where by Zen I mean
that it felt like a kick to the head.

That's not a bad idea - though it still seems as though it's broken
functionality (recently) with how it handle form reposts.  Anyone seeing
this?

I suppose, but at the same time it feels that the front-end functionality is
bloating the browsers beyond the basics... we're all still talking HTTP
here, folks - and for server-side development, it of the utmost importance.

Maybe the developer tools in consumer builds is part of the problem.
Browsers are trying to do too many things, and supporting too many different
types of web developers.

Where's the "developer's browser" or more specifically, the server-side
developer's browser... maybe we should recommend that to the "big three" :)
Or maybe there's a magic-soup of settings that can be applied to these
browsers to turn off all the consumer stuff?

Speaking of FireFox, has anyone realized that youtube videos don't
play on the latest FF on a Mac, even after updating Adobe Flash?

I don't have those problems, but sometimes when I close FF it takes like 20
minutes to actually close. Chrome just pisses me off (I prefer IE9 to
Chrome). I reccomend giving Opera a try. It is my favorite browser, and
though (useful) developer tools are virtually nonexistent its still worth a
try

It's fast, but apparently because it caches everything.  It's also way too
big-brother for me.

I've been defaulting to Chromium for a while, with the occasional switch 
to Firefox / Firebug (I work on Ubuntu)

I think it's either ctrl+refresh or shift+refresh to skip the cache on 
Chromium.  I'm not exactly sure, because it's one of those muscle memory 
things.

I tend to prefer chromium for most testing (except video links which 
tends to give an "oh shnap").

The main thing i miss is firebug's inline request drill-down.  In 
Chromium, you can have your XHR requests listed, but when you click them 
it opens the networking tab, and another click or two to actually see 
the raw headers and results.  Firebug's inline version is SO much more 
useful, especially since it's embedded within the rest of your console 
debugging context.

There's also a "disable cache" setting in Chromium that may help with 
what you're having problems with.  I haven't tried it yet - mostly due 
to my ctrl+refresh habit.

My only beef with Chrome is the lack of application-specific proxying.
 With FireFox, I can set the proxy to be different than the system
one.  With chrome, I can't.  Sure, foxyproxy exists for Chrome, but it
switches the bloody system proxy on demand (imagine what else that may
blow up).

Otherwise, I use chrome for 99.95% of my activity.  And the other 3
browsers that I use are only for browser-specific bugs that come up...

Hi!

During the past few months? It is like that for quite longer.

FF 4 and higher just sucks, the UI is horrible and the switch from 3.6 to 4 
broke a lot of things that are still not fixed....unless you happen to know 
the add-on that unfixes the 'fixes'. I also get the impression that the 
Mozilla folks got way more arrogant. They use to be thankful for constructive 
criticism or had at least a good reason for why things are the way they are. 
Now they ignore any user input and if a response comes along it is typically 
along the lines of "Go away!"
You can escape the rapid updating (which Google started with for no reason) by 
installing the FF10 ESR build. That branch is back to the old, reasonable 
update schedule.


Chrome is IMHO crap from the start and it did not get any better. Yes, it 
loads pages faster and uses less memory, but it also doesn't do anything other 
than that. I also like some UI with my fat client.

IE is very dependent on the local settings, when they are a bit harsher than 
mildly restrictive a lot of things just stop working. It also get the 
impression as if we are back to being forced to IE-only development dragging 
around different code for IE while the typical code works just fine everywhere 
else.

Opera is technically nice and can do a lot of things, but I find it utterly 
kludgy to use. Safari is like Chrome, a lot of sauce with not much meat.


As far as getting things to work the way I want I still have most success with 
FF followed by Chrome. I tend to not try it with Opera and IE and Safari are 
not even considered. I have the luxury to consider it the other's loss when 
they use these browsers and things don't come out right. Not everyone is as lucky.

Generally, I agree, browsers are heading back to the stone age, especially 
with Flash getting thrown out all over the place. HTML5 isn't properly 
implemented in most browsers and the pieces that are included are working 
differently. The problem is that HTML always only specified the markup, but 
not the display or functionality. It suggests an option, but really leaves a 
lot to interpretation.

Chrome has all of my favorite debugging features now, and I cant even stand  
to open other browsers for the most part.

But within the past 3 months or so its performance has been going down for  
me. If I was running Windows I would figure its just time to format and  
reinstall but I have never had this happen in OSX and Ubuntu before.

It's fast, but apparently because it caches everything.  It's also way too
big-brother for me.

Federico, thats a long term trend. Although I have to say the spread of  
-moz-drop-shadow type browser specific CSS has felt like its getting a bit  
out if hand....

Within the past few months I think performance and bloat have been hitting  
Firefox and Chrome. Does anyone know if Opera is still holding strong or  
does nobody even bother with them anymore?

I Agree with most of issues mentioned here. They are even worse on Linux OSes (of course not IE). But I think another important factor in bad behavior of certain browsers or version is Level of integration of 3rd party contents. Today a typical webpage contains only 50% native conent. Rest content are loaded from various 3rd party websites based on various criteria be it 3rd party banners, Promoted ads, Social integration, Integration of forum discussion etc.

I am sure various frontend tools and technologies (specially JS and Ajax) used in delivering them as well their server response time plays major role in rendering native webpage. And any possible complexity in any of above non-native content could possibly hang, distory, cramp native web page also.

I think you raise a good point - there's a difference between quality and
capability.

While the capabilities of browsers have certainly increased as front-end
technologies have matured (Javascript, HTML, CSS of course), the quality of
the browser software itself has suffered.

And David, as you point out - the whole release-early/release-often mantra
is a good one, stemming from open source.  Now, unfortunately, it appears to
have become more of a marketing tool for releasing poor quality software.

Thought I would chime in here. I heard that Microsoft currently has plans not to allow third party browsers in Windows 8. Meaning IE 9 only for Windows 8. This to me is yet another bone head move as IE 9 still lacks the standards that Chrome, Safari and FireFox support. 

As for bloating, I have not noticed it, mainly because I use minimal add-ons. Firefox, IMHO, is slightly above IE now. I prefer Chrome and Safari as they seem to handle the standards in a similar way.

How long do you think that would last before the DOJ gets a hold of
that and replays 1998 all over again...?

My thoughts exactly. 

UPDATE: It seems that what I heard on the radio was only half the story. According to this article it is only doing that on the ARM version of Windows 8 so any tablet or phone running windows 8 RT will only allow IE.

Bruce,

I'm glad you verified your not completely true information. Unfortunately,,
I did not see tis message until after I installed Chrome on my 1st
generation EEE PC running windwos 8 consumer edition just to prove that it
can be done:

https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bmSCawI606ULfWRFNMdFrOnR9yYBD3zw5d0l22edA_o?feat=directlink


I'm going to te Philippines so I'm setting up an all beta windows system
(windows 8 visual studio 11 and resharper 7) so I can do some mongoDB .NET
driver development on the 16 hour plane ride to hong kong. Thank god cathy
pacific has 120v outlets in coach.

Anyway, what Microsoft is doing with ARM is annoying, but there following
in apples footsteps, and honestly if anyone has a monopoly in the space
win8 on ARM will be in, its apple with their iPad.

That depends on which Windows 8 you are talking about. The Windows RT formerly 
known as WOA (Windows on ARM) Windows desktop will NOT provide for anything 
else other than IE. Only in the Metro view other metro-style browsers are 
allowed. That said, who cares what W8 does. It is another Vista, or even worse 
than that. The flop of the century. But I'm digressing....

As others noted, it's only true for Windows RT on ARM -- they are
basically saying that that is a mobile OS and so they can limit it the
way that Apple does with iOS. Of course, there are third-party
browsers (Opera mini, others?) available on iOS now, but it's not like
you can make anything other than Mobile Safari the default browser.

Daring Fireball recently linked to an interesting tweet about the
anti-trust decision, which is that they were careful to word it so
that it only applies to Intel-compatible PC operating systems. Since
ARM is not Intel-compatible, the restrictions may not apply.

Message-ID: <CACus1SxO2kwxKND3xRfT49vrhm0T2Oxkh8PKHkjnGJ7rr+v7bw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I need to distribute an application that potentially can be used with
many different DBMSs (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL
Server). The charset used in the databases can be ANY.

I would like to always output UTF-8 text when possible and my
questions are about the current best practices to handle this kind of
application with PHP.

1) As far as I know, PHP still doesn't support natively utf-8 so to
avoid problems with string functions, I still have to use mbstring
fucntions, am I right? What does PHP 5.4 change about that?

2) How to handle the fact that the data I receive from the database
can be stored using any possible charset? Do I need iconv functions
and convert everything in utf-8? And then convert it back in the
original charset when I have to write to the DB?

Thanks!

Eugenio

Personally, I stick to CentOS / RedHat for any server installation.
Ubuntu/Debian is fine as well.  I'd stay away from Gentoo and to a
more package based server, unless you have a dedicated server admin
(just from the overhead of maintenance).

I just have never had luck with the dependency management of APT when
installing bleading-edge (latest release) stable packages...  But
plenty of people have, so it's a fine alternative.

More, it's personal preference.  Do you prefer the debian approach?
Do you prefer the RedHat approach?  Go with what you're comfortable
with...

I'd echo this.  I'm using CentOS, personally, and the biggest reason is my comfort level. It's true that there are slight variations in footprint among the distros, but the difference between that is probably smaller than the difference in the amount of energy consumed by your comfort level, or lack thereof. So on a new project I like to start with what I'm most comfortable with and work from there.

When it gets to the point where you need every single ounce of performance, it probably means there are more resources to work with, and then maybe a switch can be made (with help).

Cheers,
Marc

Rackspace sucks. Get off them unless you like your box running slow
every three days and their customer support team telling you "they
have a team working on it right now." every time you call to ask what
happened.

My canned response is Ubuntu if you want to work with Linux, Centos/Red 
Hat if you want to work on Linux. I have a Red Hat background, FWIW.

Darryle,

I manage over a hundred cloud instances with Rackspace without a problem. What are you encountering?

Nothing since I left. But when I was on them my box was being super
slow. My cursor would take forever to blink every now and then when I
was coding in VIM. I called RS customer support and nobody had a solid
answer for me or explanation. I just had to wait it out. After three
times of that happening within the first month I left Rackspace.

You can get a small footprint with pretty much any distro. The key is
to only install the minimal set of packages provided by the
distribution.

You don't need x.org and KDE on EC2. Unless you do, of course.

I agree with Chris. Federico, I use YUM to install most of my
packages. You can see how big the files are before you install them
and which packages they depend on.

Easy just use a recursive function as shown here:

Another trick would be to not use function recursion, but a recursive iterator:

http://codepad.viper-7.com/9PeM9c

function maxDepth(array $a) {
	$it2 = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(
		new RecursiveArrayIterator($a)
	);
	$max = 0;
	foreach ($it2 as $val) {
		$max = max($max, $it2->getDepth());
	}
	return $max;
}

It will actually process less data, since the
RecursiveIteratorIterator mode is to skip non-leaf nodes (in other
words, elements that are arrays).  So the max() call will only ever be
called for non-array values...  A micro-optimization for sure, but
something worth noting...

Hah, nice. I love the warning: count() does not detect infinite recursion.

Same here - I've used Cent for years and am always happy with it.  Couple
gotchas here and there when building svn/apache/PHP types of things, but
always easy to get around and I actually prefer CentOS to RHES at this
point.

In terms of footprint, it's easy to get down to 700mb with basically only
ssh running as a stock image.

Except that doesn't do what you think it does...

$a = [[[1,2]]];

The depth here is clearly 3.

But count($a, COUNT_RECURSIVE); gives 4: http://codepad.viper-7.com/7xPYCu

It counts the total number of elements in the array, and any child
arrays (including the child array)...

Also: constants exist for a reason.  I'd suggest not doing count($a,
1), but using the reserved constant: count($a, COUNT_RECURSIVE).  Not
only does it make it future proof (for example, what if the value of 1
changed in the future), it also makes it easier to read the function
call...

Another +1 for CentOS.  It hasn't let us down over many years of production
use.

Really?  I've used remi for 5.3: http://blog.famillecollet.com/pages/Config-en
and Webtatic for 5.4: http://www.webtatic.com/packages/php54/

Couldn't be simpler...

Yeah, I don't remember the error message I was getting, but it should
be some where in the PHP list threads.  Once I compiled PHP form
source I didn't have any problems.

I'm learning and not a Unix guru bit FWIW,

Do it yourself and learning: Ubuntu Server the latest  LTS (long term
service) version. Learning curve isn't too steep and there's a good user
base for support, plenty of books and docs that are easier to understand
IMO than usual. 

If it's "critical mission" server then I think have a reputable host
with a team of experience sysops do it for you using FreeBsd.

I have test some of these out, but count(recursive) doesn't give the depth
of an array

I'm going through a preliminary comparison of Amazon and Rackspace clouds
myself.  I've been with EC2 and they've been ok, however, the problems arise
on the lower-end instances.

Medium/large work well (I use mostly large) but they're not very cheap, yet
they're very often much more power than is needed for your average site.
So, I've been trying out a couple of micro instances, but they are basically
useless - think along the lines of entering single user mode in Linux and
still not having enough CPU resources.  Even compiling PHP can be a very
long undertaking.

So I've been in search for that sweet spot - somewhere in the middle, that's
cheap, yet functional.  I've been playing with Rackspace instances (the
smallest one) and while the storage and RAM is of course small, the CPU
doesn't seem as cut-down as with EC2 micro.  I can compile normally, etc.

So while the jury is still out, I'm liking Rackspace so far for these
low-end sites/instances.  Anyone have similar experiences or thoughts?

Ive been using Linode (linode.com) for small servers for years. Good 
value, reliable and very flexible.

Have your tried a SoftLayer cloud instance?  I use a mix of dedicated
machines and cloud instances and I am pretty happy.  In one implementation,
I am running a 1 core 2ghz + 2gb ram with CentOs 6.0 for a relatively light
traffic site and I have been very happy with it.  I am paying $61/month.  If
I am compiling stuff and I want some horse power I add cores and memory.
When I am done, I dial the horse power back and go into production.  This is
after 7 years of using dedicated rack mounted boxes.  The only bummer is
that to add cores or ram requires taking the instance off line for a reboot.

I forgot to mention that once my basic instance is setup, I duplicate them.
I don't continually recompile apache and php on each instance.

Ha, This is the problem with using EC2 or any cloud provider, you have zero
security on the top-down.  I only trust physical boxes.

Once I left RS , I moved to linode and haven't had any problems. Also,
when I created a ticket with RS , it took them about 3 days to respond
back, but when I create a ticket with Linode it takes them about 3
hours  to respond back. I'm assuming RS has more customers so I'm not
really complaining about that, but it's still nice to get your ticket
answered 3 hours later.

I was using AWS/Rightscale at my last job, we had a dedicated server admin who I helped out, many problems.  I've been using Rackspace cloud since it was called Mosso (and was horrible) with Ubuntu 10.04 for which I'm the sole admin and spend most of my time coding.  

Generally Rackspace has been pretty good, they do have one serious problem.  If a server in your "cluster" gets hit with a DDOS then it your site will be inaccessible while they negate it.  Usually this happens for 5-10 Min. about every 2 months to our cluster (the DDOS has never been to our site directly).  A tech there described it as a known problem with internal switching they have but they don't have a solution.  Maybe the openstack shift may fix this.  

Otherwise I've been pretty happy With Rackspace and Ubuntu.  I believe the new 12.x LTS is out and if Rackspace has it as an option I would use that.

Interesting, well I did get an email saying my server will require a
reboot because of a maintenance issue. To quote verbatim  "This
maintenance is required due to a software issue which our vendor will
disclose to the public in a few weeks. " . I'm curious to know if this
is the reason why.

Thanks so much for your feedback about the distro, that helped me a lot, so
in the end I setup a Debian instance on Rackspace. Following your
suggestions I chose the one I know better. I may change it in future if any
good reason, as better performance or free cookies :)



Talking about "AWS vs RackSpace", we are comparing apple from the farmer
with apple from the market, because AWS has it's own (server) farm, instead
Rackspace use Akamai, although soon they will have their own farm with
OpenStack
http://www.rackspace.com/information/mediacenter/announcements/openstack/.


In my opinion, the choice depends by needs and budget. For a startup in
bootstrap I could suggests Rackspace, because easy to setup and maintain
with a low price (on the paper). Amazon fit the best for company with high
traffic and budget, because AWS offers more tools and control, but needs a
dedicated system admin and is more expensive for low usage but become
"relatively" cheaper on high usage. Also they recently added Cloud Alert,
which control your bandwidth, CPU usage, but especially your bill, which
can save your wallet from a DDOS
http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/calc5.html


Personally I've used AWS, for some websites with a million visitors, and
some personal project, and I found it very good, but little
expensive. Today I started using Rackspace on a project of mine, so far I
like it, but I'll wait the first bill to confirm :)

Folks,

I feel I really need to correct a lot of the discrepancies going on here. 

This post is a little dated, but I wrote it about a year ago and most still holds true:

http://www.bitlancer.com/blog/2011/08/amazon-ec2-vs-rackspace-cloud/

Rackspace runs their own infrastructure, even on their cloud platform. They only use Akamai for their CDN technology. Cloud Files is already OpenStack, and Cloud Servers is the same platform Slicehost used before being acquired (which is being phased out in favor of OpenStack across the board). Data centers are dfw1/2 and ord, primarily. All owned by Rackspace. 

Under the hood, the servers (unlike ec2) are built for stability, as Rackspace Cloud targets more traditional types of customers. Their instances are not designed to die, and while Rackspace will not back up instances automatically, they will replace failing hardware. Launching a random ec2 instance at Amazon is always scary, as you're likely to lose it within a year, unless it's EBS backed. I'm a very big fan of Amazon, no doubt, but only when solutions are architected for it correctly. 

As for cost, a Rackspace Cloud small is around $10/mo. It doubles from there (20, 40, 80, 160 , 320, 640, 1100 ish). Bandwidth is around 18 cents/gig. If you launch a single, 1 GB instance, you'll have 1 GB RAM, and at *minimum* a guaranteed slice of the CPU and I/O. Unlike other providers, Rackspace *will* let you burst. Launch a couple 1 GB instances, and then launch one 16 GB instance, run setiathome for a bit on all instances, and see which option is more cost effective :) I have some graphs from tests I've done if anyone is interested. 

Hope this helps,

Matt

It was a wide range, with 2 being maxed out I believe, but still - I
couldn't even quantify the costs.  I used a TON of bandwidth and it didn't
even register on my bill really.

Matt thanks for point that out, with your correction now I feel even more
happy to have choose Rackspace for my project.
I found funny that both AWS and RS didn't fix many of the issues you listed
in your article one year ago!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] UTF-8, databases and best practices
Message-ID: <CACus1Sxomoq-Yz_h5egEuDhM6rhaabMDpEbnyGhoVMs-tY1ncg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I need to distribute an application that potentially can be used with
many different DBMSs (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL
Server). The charset used in the databases can be ANY.

I would like to always output UTF-8 text when possible and my
questions are about the current best practices to handle this kind of
application with PHP.

1) As far as I know, PHP still doesn't support natively utf-8 so to
avoid problems with string functions, I still have to use mbstring
fucntions, am I right? What does PHP 5.4 change about that?

2) How to handle the fact that the data I receive from the database
can be stored using any possible charset? Do I need iconv functions
and convert everything in utf-8? And then convert it back in the
original charset when I have to write to the DB?

Thanks!

Greetings, all!

For a while now I've been tossing an idea around in my head -- building
and maintaining a saleable open source product rather than doing hourly
consulting.  Specifically, a product in the CRM / marketing software
space, which I feel is under-served.

Does anyone have any experience with hooking up with business side people
to refine ideas, get their input, and obtain funding/business partners?

I've become increasingly disenchanted with hourly and per-project
consulting as the economic pressures increase (and increased economic
pressures are another reason why I think CRM/marketing is the area to go
with).  But, I'm not sure exactly how to go about making my dream come
true and look forward to any input.

On a side note, if anyone has any overflow work, please contact me off
list.  No reasonable offer refused. :)

Thanks guys.

Kristina

Morning Kristina!

I'm not sure if I understand your prime motivation as I see more than
one. To go from hourly consulting to a longer term gig then I'd
recommend finding a code house that supports products you are
interested in. Or that use technologies you want to integrate into
your future solution. For example, look to 10Gen for MongoDB, etc.

If your driver is income stability then there are lots of recruiters
who will happily make $$ off your desire for resource levelling. There
were some recent posts on the Jobs list, I believe.

If your desire is to raise your income then perhaps you need to look
at marketing and selling yourself better. I highly recommend Josh
Kaufmann's "The Personal MBA" as a way to get better in business
without the overly expensive and often pointless sheepskin.

If your desire is to build a better mousetrap then perhaps getting
work with a current CRM shop to see what goes on behind the scenes
owuld help. It doesn't have to be a PHP based product but you'll
probably be able to transfer your knowledge fairly easily.

Hope that helps! Many of us are in the throes of career growth or
transition and there seems to be a lot of good out there.

Leam

I agree totally with Leam.

>From open source you don't do money, unless you create something great,
that sometimes break (Mongo for example), because people use it and need
you to fix it.

7 years ago I published a template engine called RainTPL<http://raintpl.com/>,
lot of developers use it and help me to improve it, which is good because I
use it in all my website, but I never got a penny from it. Is fun yes, but
if you want to do money get a job :)

Leam,

I'm interested in hearing any tips from anyone on how to obtain funding /
business partners for an open-source project (and also put a note at the
end just in case anyone DOES have any work lying around they can pass
through).

I'm definitely NOT looking to get a "job" and I'm NOT looking to deal with
any recruiters.

Thanks!!

Kristina

I definitely think that marketing oneself is important and time consuming,
which is just one more reason that I do NOT want to do consulting any
more, but want to team up with marketing genuis and let the code do most
of the work so I don't have to!!!  :)

Kristina,

The resources I have found most useful, in addition to Kaufmann's
"Personal MBA", are:

  SCORE.org
  biznik.com
  LinkedIn.com
  gm4jh.com
  elance.com
  guru.com

If I were in your position, and I have been, I would build my
reputation on what I can do personally by showing the same or similar
experience. You are, in fact, trying to get a VC or marketing guru to
"hire" you. The more you can show a good chance for success the more
likely you are to get funds or sweat equity from team members.

Investors are only interested in open source because programming
talent claims it as a condition of employment, not because they see
any intrinsic advantage to it. So you might as well leave it out of
your equation (though not out of your toolkit) and concentrate on
finding a marketing genius, or maybe better a visionary with some head
for business, and becoming the architect of their own private
skunkworks.

But that's aside. What I really wanted to say about this issue is that
I think convincing investors to give you money is a waste of valuable
programming time. Build the product first, launch the service, prove
that there is value (and profit?) in it... and then if you still need
investors they will come to you.

But of course you have to eat and have a place to live, so if you
don't have money to cover those expenses while you build stuff, maybe
you'll have to suck it up and go work for the man for a while until
you do.

Hi Kristina,

I can't think of any open source product that is profitable by itself.
The value in such a product is almost always really from the knowledge
and support of the people selling it.

My recommendation would be to double down on whatever you're doing.
Become the absolute uncontested expert in that CRM / marketing
software you're talking about so that you're the go-to person when it
comes to that package. Buy a cheap PC with 8GB of memory and run
VMWare with 5 VMs running various combinations on Windows, Linux,
different Windows OSs with different browsers, etc. Meaning create a
test network and try various permutations of the package in parallel.
Create test scripts to test the stability of the application. Help
people in forums (with a link to your website in your signature). Pick
something specific like how to make your iPhone work really well with
it and then blog about it. Etc.

I think a lot of developers (and entire software companies for that
matter) make the mistake of doing a wide variety of things in a
shallow way when they should really focus on a few things intently.

Mike

Hi Kristina -

I work at 10gen (company that develops & supports MongoDB). I'd be happy to
chat with you sometime and give you some ideas/feedback. In the interim you
may want to check out this article about JBoss. It's the best overview of
the open source biz model I've read:
http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/sales-marketing-machine/jboss-example/

Good luck!

Cheers
Meghan

Hi Meghan!

Steve Francia gave an interesting webinar on MongoDB and PHP Friday; I 
completely enjoyed it and am looking more at MongoDB and how to spread 
the word.

Thanks for a great product!

A little late on this thread, but another problem with EC2 is that
Amazon, because of its massive consumer retail operation and global
profile, is a much bigger and juicier target for attackers than
Rackspace or Linode.

I have never liked the idea that I order books and shoes with the same
user account that has control of my servers. Of course you can and
should create a separate account just for AWS admin, but you can't
limit an account to *only* AWS access, so the attack surface is much
larger than it should be.

I agree, Amazon does to many things, and some does it in a horrible way,
like FPS, I registered my account to create a subscription payment button,
and to complete the registration they asked me login / password of my bank
account. What if they get hacked like Sony? Also they recently started with
a groupon-like service.

I only need somebody who provide me a server and that I can trust, and for
now Rackspace it seams the best choice, in term of price, service and
customer care.

Message-ID: <CACus1SxvS_aMeGMg3FZNrF50pwD4kZ72LZ5aakjcnpSGFZXswg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I need to distribute an application that potentially can be used with
many different DBMSs (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL
Server). The charset used in the databases can be ANY.

I would like to always output UTF-8 text when possible and my
questions are about the current best practices to handle this kind of
application with PHP.

1) As far as I know, PHP still doesn't support natively utf-8 so to
avoid problems with string functions, I still have to use mbstring
fucntions, am I right? What does PHP 5.4 change about that?

2) How to handle the fact that the data I receive from the database
can be stored using any possible charset? Do I need iconv functions
and convert everything in utf-8? And then convert it back in the
original charset when I have to write to the DB?

Thanks!

Eugenio

AFAIK, correct, and there hasn't been many significant changes with this
recently.

I'd be interested to hear other's thoughts, but the general consensus these
days is "convert all to UTF-8".  Is there an application-requirement-reason
that you'd need to convert data to a different charset at different times?

In general:

1. Raw data (any charset/encoding)
2. Detect and convert to UTF 8, clean-up, etc.
3. Store in database/etc
4. Read/display in UTF 8

This should support the vast majority of written human languages, though I
believe there are some exceptions.

Yes about point 4: save your PHP file in UTF-8 and add the encoding to your
HTML
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>

obvious things that can make you lose hours of deugging

This actually brings up a good point/question that I've had.

I commonly use HTML 5 boilerplate, and they too have a similar meta tag as
above to set the charset.

However, while developing along one day, I was seeing an erroneous request
hitting the web server (from Firefox).  After much debugging and bug
searching, I arrived at commenting it out and leaving this note:

/*
This causes problem with Firefox (double requests) if output comes
before the doctype.  Use PHP to set the Content-Type and charset,
not a meta tag.
<meta charset="utf-8">
*/

So obviously having output before doctype isn't what's supposed to happen,
though it does, and when it does and Firefox suddenly makes double requests
for no reason, it's really difficult to pin down.  Anyone else see anything
like this?

 My Recommendations. I use this successfully in several multiple language
projects.

# my.cnf
[mysqld]
default_character_set = utf8
character_set_client       = utf8
character_set_server       = utf8
[client]
default_character_set = utf8

#php.ini
default_charset = "utf-8"

#httpd.conf
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

<VirtualHost>
    AddCharset UTF-8   .htm
</VirtualHost>

MySQL connection  (extra precaution)
SET NAMES utf8;

HTML
  <meta charset="utf-8">

PHP
header('Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8');

And last but not least, even editing files in shell can be affected (.e.g
UTF-8 data to be inserted into DB from file).  Ensure

LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
LANG=en_US.UF-8

Regards

Ronald

I hadn't seen this, but there's a stackoverflow answer that verifies it:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1903925/firefox-makes-two-http-requests

From that page: "I've had a similar issue if the encoding of the page didn't match the <meta> tag. If the page was encoded using default windows encoding, but the meta tag specified UTF-8, then firefox would stop downloading once it reached a non-ascii character (e.g. ?,? or ?) and it would redownload the page from the beginning. This would mess up view counts and lots of other logic since the server side script would run twice."

Make sure your editor encoding is set to UTF-8.  A lot of them don't come with it set to UTF-8 out of the box.

Hi all and thanks for the interesting answers!
The problem 2) is still the one I'm not completely sure about; in
almost all your answers you suppose I can decide how to setup the
database but it is not the case. This application has to work with any
database settings, I can't force the users to ALTER the database
charset and make it UTF-8.
So should I have to read and convert on the fly (using PHP ICONV) to
UTF-8 from the database and then convert it back again before writing?
I can't just assume to work with UTF-8, right?

Thanks again.

Hi!

In case you haven't seen this, ComputerWorld published an article about how to 
make PHP apps scale:

I'm only passing this on, I don't know enough to determine if this is true or not.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT: Microsoft Outlook folders being written to in the
	background?
Message-ID: <CAN7=Vv9U2ZW+tiFfuaRrT=b-LK-+BWEiC1qyAG8xJGVvBS8+PA@mail.gmail.com>

This is an off-top post. While it doesn't relate to PHP it does relate to
the Linux server. I appreciate any insight some kind soul could offer.

There was a legacy of Outlook PST files we needed access too. So we fired
up Outlook 2010 on a Window 7 PC and imported the legacy Outlook PST
files/folders. The odd thing is, we don't use Outlook on this PC at all for
anything. The applications has not even been launched (to the best of our
knowledge) for a couple of weeks. However, I noticed in the backup that
several of those legacy Outlook files/folders are being written too. I know
this because during the rsync backup of the Linux file server, I noticed
they are being backed up again as if they have been changed.

I'm not an Outlook user and don't use Windows much. If Outlook isn't being
launched on this PC, what could be causing this legacy Outlook files to be
written too? Does Outlook or part of a Microsoft Office do any sort of
background housing cleaning/re-indexing of Outlook files/folders? If so, is
there a way to stop this process from being scheduled? Thanks in advance!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Form frustrations
Message-ID: <4FC38AD7.3080004@gmail.com>

Morning all!

I'm trying to get past two of my many programming hurdles and would 
appreciate your help. Pointers to documentation are fine, my goal is to 
learn, not just get the question answered.

I'm writing a small application to plan scuba dives. The planning takes 
in lots of user input and checks it against safety margins, recommends 
gas requirements based on time, etc.

There are two topics I'm working on and three issues within those 
topics. First, I'm trying to build my Object skills so am using an 
object and some methods. The other topics, and two issues are on forms. 
I prefer to stay with straight PHP while I learn, before going to a 
Forms tool or framework. So I'm thing to set things up so that a user 
could do a quick query or a full dive profile using the same object and 
methods.

Here are some use cases, hopefully they make sense.

You want to dive to 114 feet to see a certain wreck. What's the best 
Nitrox mix for a 1.6 PPO2 at 114? What's the mix for 1.4 PPO2?

You just want to go dive and your tanks have 36% in them. What's the MOD?

You and a buddy want to go to 65 feet FFW and penetrate 500' into 
Jackson Blue. What are your gas requirements individually and for 
matching to meet the rule of thirds? What mixes can you use?

You expect to need 27 minutes on task at 130 feet to survey the first 
part of the wreck. What mix can you use, how much deco gas will you 
need, and where's your CNS clock at the end?


 From a PHP perspective the math is pretty simple. What I am less 
skilled at is designing the form flow and logic to retain inputs while 
error checking and incrementally entering form data. For example, you 
can't compute gas used without SAC, ATA, and Time.

A simple, non-functional view is at: 
http://reuel.net/dive/demo_dive_planner.php

What I would like to have is a form that lets them compute parts of the 
dive or all of it, depending on what option they pick and what data they 
fill in. That is:

Fill in Depth and click "Compute ATA". Which is doable.
Fill in Depth, Time, and SAC and click "Gas Required". Which is doable. 
If you forget one return the form with the data you already provided and 
error mark the parts you forgot.

Make sense?

Woot! Have spent most of the day working on OOP, form logic, and 
snacking. Only the first four entries do anything and the middle column, 
except for "Calculate" are pointless. The form figures the numbers if 
the required variables are set.

What I'll probably do, if someone is bored enough, is finish up what I 
can do and then ask for recommendations on making it better. I know my 
coding leaves much to be desired but no way to learn except to ask.

Hey guys,
what tools do you use to develop in PHP? Are you using Jenkins with all the
fancy plugins? And what about the IDE?

I'm installing Jenkins PHP (finally) and as editor I'm using Netbeans 7.2.1
on OSX with PHPUnit plugin, I've also tried to install Code Sniffer and
Mess Detector plugins but with no success (so if you know how, please let
me know).

I installed Jenkins recently, but not actively using it yet.  Transitioning
off of Atlassian Bamboo.

Aptana for a heavy IDE.  vim for light editing.

xdebug, xhprof, and MacGDBp are a few more tools that come to mind.  I have
Phabricator installed, but haven't transitioned from using Github for code
reviews.

Have tried several different Chrome extensions for integrating FirePHP.
 Haven't settled on one yet.  Maybe FeverPHP.

Is Lync running? That will write archived PM chats to the pst file.

Hi!

I'm using no plugins or frameworks and only a handful of modules that come 
with stock PHP. Using Apachefriend's XAMPP as server / stack on W2k3. Using 
NuSphere's PHPEd as IDE, but also use Waterproof's IDE (free private license).
BUT...I write PHP maybe a few times a year for personal use. So I am NOT the 
norm in any way. I just feel that once in while I need to contribute a bit to 
the list here. ;)

Thanks for the reply, David.

No, Lync isn't being used.

I guess the next step would be to get a list of all the processes and try
to identify their purpose. Auto-archive in Outlook has been off through
this whole mystery too.

I'm about like David, I get to do fun PHP stuff on what little of my own 
time I can squirrel away. Vim, moving to sourceforge or collab.net for 
version control, and mostly stock PHP.

Need to up my skills in unit testing and documentation.

Aptana Studio (mentioned before) is the only tool I've tried that correctly
colors and indents PHP, Javascript/jQuery, and CSS in the same file.

You may now start mocking me for commingling all that in one file.  Maybe
on my next rewrite...

After over 10 years of coding php, I still can't remember the parameter order for a number of basic functions (is this the one where the haystack comes first or the needle?)

So that saves some time.

Autocomplete and context based documentation of your own methods is pretty helpful.

Being able to jump around files in a large project by highlighing a class name and hitting a function key is nice.

Also, the on-the-fly syntax checking can be helpful.

However, the downside is that most of the really useful IDE features use a lot of memory and processing. They basically tokenize and turn your code into a giant database behind the scenes.

So it's helpful to have a lightweight editor handy when you're ready to throw your heavy IDE out the window.

Hi David,

This should clarify it:

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/269520

Every time you open a pst file and navigate it in anyway, it writes back
metadata to the pst file.

Thanks for the reply and the link, Nasir.

What makes this such a mystery, is that while the Windows 7 workstation is
being used daily, the Outlook 2012 application is not being launched or
used at all. But somehow something is writing to several of the PST legacy
files each day the PC is on. This might mean that independent of bringing
up the Outlook 2012 client itself, there may be some process(es) from
perhaps Office or when Outlook was installed that runs and does it's house
cleaning/indexing routine. This is causing GBs of data to be backup each
day that should be sitting their untouched. I'd like to be able to stop
this process from running if Outlook isn't being used. Or I could remove
the Outlook 2012 application, but that seems like an odd thing to have to
do, because if access was needed to the legacy PST files, it would have to
be re-installed and then removed when finished.

I don't know enough about Windows 7 to know if I can do a Linux-type 'ps'
command and check logs that would have any meaning for me.

So is it safe to safe that when it comes to power and being
lightweight that VIM reigns supreme? There are still plenty of good
developers out there who don't really realize the true power of VIM
and all of the cool time saving things you can do with it. Not only
have VIM never froze or crash on me, but you can also share or kill
the memory buffer between your tabs.

I use Komodo Edit. At work they use(d) DreamWeaver when I started. Most of the code they write is ColdFusion, so adobe being Adobe made syntax highlighting for ColdFusion in DreamWeaver. However for PHP it has to be one of the worst. So I set out looking for a replacement. Normally I would have used BbEdit, or Xcode, but I wasn't on a Mac. I looked at a few and found Komodo to fit my needs the best. It lets me create projects out of any language or framework and the IDE is extendable. Since using Komodo Edit at work I have converted 2 others, both use ColdFusion, and I am now using it on a Mac at work. On the PC you can extend it via a plugin that adds subversion, or on the Mac I added subversion via command line to some GUI buttons and dialogs.

Hey guys,

what tools do you use to develop in PHP? Are you using Jenkins with all the
fancy plugins? And what about the IDE?


I'm installing Jenkins PHP (finally) and as editor I'm using Netbeans 7.2.1
on OSX with PHPUnit plugin, I've also tried to install Code Sniffer and Mess
Detector plugins but with no success (so if you know how, please let me
know).

I know this may not apply to most people here, but I've been doing PHP
development on Linux and UNIX systems since 2000...

Developing on Linux, I've been using gedit most of the time lately--it's
a nice compromise between the lightweightedness of Vi or Pico/Nano, but
with all the standard text editor features of a GUI (multiple undo,
mouse-based nav and selection, etc.) with the added benefits of
automatic syntax highlighting for PHP (and many others) as well as my
favorite feature, RegEx-compatible search and replace with escapable
characters... 

I used to be heavily devoted to Quanta+; if someone picked up developing
that again I would be using it exclusively. Quanta+ did all the stuff
Eclipse did without being as obtuse about it; I recall having to
document a sprawling crufty project as my first task at a new job, and
my boss being amazed that I could just go through every variable,
function, object, include file and so on through Quanta's handy sidebar.
But alas, my new job requires me to code in HTML5, which Quanta doesn't
support; gvfs support is also very spotty in KDE applications.

Another great open source editor for PHP is Geany, which could use a bit
more development and will soon match or surpass Quanta's value in GNOME.

I'd say contextual highlighting is really useful. Even more useful are
features like Quanta's bracket highlighting, which will visually show
you where your brackets, parentheses and brace blocks open and close.

I don't know if there are easy ways to use these tools on MacOS or
Windows, but I'm sure it's possible... even though they're open-source,
it may cost you too much time to set up GNOME on a non-UNIX machine.

PhpStorm on development box/s and vim on the servers.

PhpStorm really helps with a large MVC codebase.

I've been using Zend Studio 5.5 -- the pre-Eclipse version -- since
forever. I've been documenting how to keep it running on OS X through
the many Java upgrades since Zend stopped supporting it.

I know it's crazy, but it offers the best fit to my way of working.

Netbeans is Plan B if ZDE finally stops working entirely.

If anyone from Zend happens to be reading this, please PLEASE consider
donating the source for ZDE 5.5 to public domain so that those few of
us who really love it could fix some annoying issues and bring it up
to date with current versions of PHP. Eclipse, though excellent, is
just not the same.

I do the same thing on Windows.  Long live Zend Studio 5.5!  Long live the
Amiga.  I could never get the Eclipse version to perform.  I also use
EditPlus.

I have been developing PHP for about 14 years now and I have used the
following.

1.) Zend Studio as my IDE
2.) Jenkins as CI server
3.) PHPUnit for unit testing
4.) Zend Framework (when I get the choice)
5.) Codeigniter (when I don't get the choice)
6.) Zend Debugger / XDebug for stepping through the code line by line
7.) Zend Server CE for development
8.) SVN for version control, I would like to move to GIT though

I have also used Aptana, Netbeans, etc but stick to Zend Studio since it is
based on Eclipse and I already have a license.

If I didn't have a license for Zend Studio I would use Eclipse PDT for my
IDE.

I write PHP full-time and find that the benefits of code intellisense in my
IDE for rapid development outweights a light editor like VIM, however for
quick fixes I will use VIM.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford
Zend Certified Engineer

Maybe there should be a Zend Studio 5.5 community for those of us still
happily cemented to the tool.

I do the same thing on Windows.  Long live Zend Studio 5.5!  Long live the
Amiga.  I could never get the Eclipse version to perform.  I also use
EditPlus.

Hi Everyone,

       I'm writing a cron script which I'm testing by executing the
script from the command line. The output is obviously displaying in
the terminal and I would like to change the font color for three
different arrays to red, white or yellow.  How do I need to write my
echo statements to make print_r( $array1 ); display red, white or
yellow in the terminal?

If you just need a quick hack and you're using bash, this will help:
http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/colorizing.html

Note that where it says \E in the examples you should replace with
\033 to get an ESC character.

Thanks Chris ,

That's exactly what I was looking for. For anyone else who needs help
with this, here are my working examples, with a little explanation.

echo -e "\033[34m Contact List \033[0m";    <-  The "34m" part makes
Contact List a dark  blue color and  the  "0m" at the end  stops the
coloring. If I don't change it to 0, my prompt will also be  dark
blue.

If I use 31m instead of 34m, then Contact List will be red, instead of
dark blue,

echo -e "\033[31m Contact List \033[0m". I hope that helps someone.

One more thing, this works well from the command line, but if you want
to make it work from within a PHP script that output data to the
terminal then remove the  "-e";.
