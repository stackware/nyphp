Hi Matt,

You can combine KnowledgeTree, Drupal, Subversion, WebDAV / Apache
ModDav, WebSVN, Eventum (to do over I'd use Drupal tracker, or
something else), FreeMind, MediaWiki, and TaskJuggler into a complete
platform.  Still, it's a lot of work and depends entirely on
adoption/fitting into the organizations workflows.  I did not get a
chance to actually document or share much of the &quot;how to&quot; of that
system, but hope to someday.  There are a lot of possibilities out
there, but no matter how well crafted the solution is, the success is
going to depend more on how motivated and engaged people are in seeing
the system meet their needs.

I would have to say that even among big/enterprise solutions, there is
not a single product that does everything you mention.

One other thought is that Ubuntu has a pretty good system (in several
parts) that can stand as a model -- but it's neither available to
install, nor a single solution.  It bears repeating that their system
too is highly dependent on agreements between educated participants
about methods and procedures of the system.
