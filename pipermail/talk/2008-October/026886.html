  Speaker:  Paul Charles Leddy

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  INTRODUCTION:
  -------------

  The Asterisk web site says: Asterisk is the world's leading open
  source telephony engine and tool kit.  This month, our speaker
  will give us a hands-on demonstration of setting up a free PBX
  (Phone System) and IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system,
  using VoIP (Voice over IP) phones and a VoIP provider (Internet
  Phone Service).

  Previously (back in the year 2000), Unigroup had presented
  the &quot;Bayonne&quot; Open Source Telephony Project.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
  ---------------------

  To REGISTER for this event, please RSVP by using the Unigroup
  Registration Page:
        <A HREF="http://www.unigroup.org/unigroup-rsvp.html">http://www.unigroup.org/unigroup-rsvp.html</A>

  This will allow us to automate the registration process.
  (Registration will also add you to our mailing list.)
  Please avoid emailed RSVPs.

  Please continue to check the Unigroup web site and meeting page,
  for any last minute updates concerning this meeting.  If you
  registered for this meeting, please check your email for any last
  minute announcements as the meeting approaches.  Also make sure
  any anti-spam white-lists are updated to _ALLOW_ Unigroup traffic!
  If you block Unigroup Emails, your address will be dropped from
  our mailing list.

  Please RSVP as soon as possible, preferably at least 2-3 days
  prior to the meeting date, so we can plan the food order.
  RSVP deadline is usually the night before the meeting day.

  Note: RSVP is requested for this location to make sure the guard
        will let you into the building.  RSVP also helps us to
        properly plan the meeting (food, drinks, handouts,
        seating, etc.) and speed up your sign-in at the meeting.
        If you forget to RSVP prior to the meeting day, you may
        still be able to show up and attend our meeting, however,
        we cannot guarantee what building security will do if
        you are &quot;not on the list&quot;.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  MAIN PRESENTATION
  -----------------

  Topic: The Asterisk Open Source PBX/Telephony System:
         From The Ground Up!

  We'll compile the code and start up the asterisk server.  Then
  hook up a couple of phones so we can make an internal PBX call.
  From there, we'll register with a VoIP provider and make
  a real call to someone in the audience.  Last, we can also build
  a basic voice response system to make a virtual &quot;haunted house&quot;
  for this coming October 31st.

  Outline for the Talk:

   - About The Asterisk Project
   - Getting the code and compiling it
   - Basic configuration
   - Setting up phone extensions
   - Registering a SIP phone
   - Making an internal call
   - Registering with a VoIP service
   - Calling an outside line, receiving a call from an outside line
   - Basic call routing and IVR (Interactive Voice Response)
   - (Helping people get a system up and running on their laptops)

  Speaker Biography:
  ------------------

  Paul Charles Leddy has been a Linux Systems Administrator for about
  10 years.  The story of how he got involved with computer telephony
  is: &quot;Dreaming of voice over the Internet since circa '96, when
  Paul heard about Mark Spencer's Asterisk, he just had to get it up
  and running.  He downloaded the code onto his Mac laptop and had a
  dial tone within minutes: Wow!  Since then, he has gone on to
  implement a few phone extensions, Interactive Voice Response
  playhouses, hooked up to a real live VoIP service or two, like
  Junction Networks and VoipJet, and helped friends and family
  discover the wonderful world of cheap talk, walking the walk.&quot;
