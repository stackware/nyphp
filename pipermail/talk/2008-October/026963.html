</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I think you have your real question here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Having been recently hacked and several of my webmaster email account

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; How about fixing the problem, instead of adding new security measures?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Please define &quot;hacked&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hacked meaning that they, the badguys managed to ftp a folder full of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> php code but has no data to support that claim thus far. So, I can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say that the site authorization was compromised with any certainty.

&gt;<i> To me, this seems manipulation of URL/s on your website that has file

That was essentially what the assumption was by the ISP, they think
that the hacker got in using one of the folders that is required to be
&quot;writable&quot; by the script for stuff like image processing and they
speculated that having gotten in, they simply uploaded their junk to
an obscure folder that contained a single php file. My problem with
that theory is that they can not produce the hack that let them into
the system, like I would normally see something like this in my
logifles - /inc/design.inc.php?dir[inc]=<A HREF="http://www.etc">http://www.etc</A>

Hackers try to use this technique on some of my site all the time but
I have plugged that hole and have the script send me an email when
they attempt to piggyback the url. I didn't get one for the hack that
got executed to load the porn onto my site so its still a matter of
speculation about how it actually got accomplished. No new exploits
have been reported against this software either for that matter. I am
reasonably certain that my site isn't the only one that has been
hijacked by porno peddlers but I can only find references to my site
when I do searches for keywords the badguys are using.

I do think it might have been a URL manipulation in spite of the fact
that I don't have a log entry to confirm it.

thanks for the reply.
