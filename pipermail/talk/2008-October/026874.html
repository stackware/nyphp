<PRE>IMO registration forms should only use POST beacuse REQUEST is a
conglomerate of POST, GET, etc and is affected by the php.ini with the
variables_order and  can be  messed up and set insecurely by the host;
having said that, i do believe that cURL can do a POST. so it's not a 100%
solution to the problem.

Having said all of that -- make sure all of your forum software is up to
date with the latest patches, etc; they release those for a reason, and it's
not because they are bored.

Can you specify which forums you are having problems with?  A name might
help with other solutions and suggestions.

&gt;<i> Hello NYPHP,

</I>&gt;<i> I am seeing that Registration forms are taking a huge beating from
</I>&gt;<i> scammers and spammers today, especially forum sites. I spend most
</I>&gt;<i> of my time lately collecting and filtering data to find the freaks
</I>&gt;<i> before they find the membership. Use to be and &quot;every now and again&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> but now its thousands per day and you can't tell now whether its a
</I>&gt;<i> robot or cheap labor doing the form input. Aside from my own sites
</I>&gt;<i> that are getting pounded daily I have several client site that average
</I>&gt;<i> 500 badguy hits a day now and those are just the ones I have a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;known badguy&quot; status, they are hijacking and adding new addresses
</I>&gt;<i> everyday, spammers mostly, all forum sites. Just unbelievable, and of
</I>&gt;<i> course, mustn't forget my recent episode with the porno  pirate hijacking
</I>&gt;<i> my server is still giving me no joy either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anybody else having these kinds of problems?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think someone suggested (here I think) that the scammer/spammers
</I>&gt;<i> were using CURL to access the database directly, is that possible? If
</I>&gt;<i> so how, and how can that be prevented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the trap that I have set up, I log the contents of $_REQUEST but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see anything unusual about the submission and all of a sudden
</I>&gt;<i> the bad guy ends up in the system as a &quot;Registered&quot; user bypassing all
</I>&gt;<i> the captcha security and &quot;moderation&quot; step in the approval process,
</I>&gt;<i> like they are accessing the database directly but I don't see any of
</I>&gt;<i> this database being passed in $_REQUEST? Any ideas? Or where else I
</I>&gt;<i> need to be looking to trap the data that is being passed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TIA for any pointers.
