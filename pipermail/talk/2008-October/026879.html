Through SQL injection, the bad guys need not approach through the front-door 
registration process.  Perhaps some query on a random page somewhere is 
being hijacked: Get the stupid widget from the stupid table, and oh, by the 
way, insert this new user into the registered members table.

I'm not familiar with vBulletin but if you can grep through ALL the queries 
being executed on your site, and search for the new badguy usernames that 
are being injected into your table, then you can find which query is being 
used to add them.  It need not be anywhere on the registration page.
