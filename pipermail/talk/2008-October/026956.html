<PRE>Hello Mike,

I think you have your real question here:

Having been recently hacked and several of my webmaster email account
names being hijacked by spammers, I am looking for viable solutions to
safeguard my websites and the membership of these sites.

How about fixing the problem, instead of adding new security measures? 
Please define &quot;hacked&quot;?

Did they guess the passwords to theses accounts - Enforce 
non-standard/dictionary passwords, implement password expiration policies.
Did they brute force an account - lock the account after N failed 
attempts in Y minutes (example: 15 failed logins in 1 minute).
Did they sniff traffic - Require all credentials (and maybe everything) 
be sent over SSL.
Did they sql inject - Bind your params &amp; validate all user input.
Don't let someone send out &gt;N emails in Y minutes (example: 50 emails in 
1 minute) - If you control the front end to the mail, you could add some 
last line of
defense checks into that.

- Ben

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of my websites run php forum and CMS software of varying flavors
</I>&gt;<i> so I am not convinced that OpenID is a viable solution to secure them
</I>&gt;<i> against the kinds of attacks I have see recently and wonder about the
</I>&gt;<i> integrity of a system that claims (from phpMyID):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * The whole point of OpenID is to allow you to manage your own identity, and phpMyID lets you do that without giving control to a third party.
</I>&gt;<i>     * It's easy to install and easy to configure. Edit just a few lines in your config file, and you're off and running!
</I>&gt;<i>     * Allows &quot;Smart Mode OpenID&quot; (more secure) transactions, even if you don't have a &quot;big math&quot; library available. Seriously, phpMyID comes with a pure-PHP math library which can be used if you want to demand that extra level of security.
</I>&gt;<i>     * Ensures secure password transmission even if you don't have SSL! By using HTTP Digest authentication, phpMyID ensures your password is never sent or stored anywhere in clear or decypherable text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would really appreciate an eye opener on this one. It looks like
</I>&gt;<i> more flim flam to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
