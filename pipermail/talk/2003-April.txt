Jim,
No reason to blame NYPHP.  I've been working on anti-spam technology for a
couple of years and can list dozens of ways how your NYPHP e-mail address
ended up on a spammer's mailing list. Harvesting the Web is not the only
way.  Perhaps that's really the case that someone joined NYPHP just to
collect e-mail addresses from the web archive. However there are all kinds
of other things done by spammers to get e-mail addresses.  You gotta realize
that once you send an e-mail message to a mailing list, the message is
distributed to all subscribers, therefore many different IPS's and PC's. ..
and then you have things like:
- evil admins who extract addresses from mailbox and mail log files on mail
servers
- weak security on shared mail/hosting servers where any user can do the
above
- e-mail worms harvesting addresses from e-mail client mailboxes
- the list goes on ..
I hope you'll be able to sleep tonight and use e-mail ever again  :)

Cheers,
Jerry

Subject: Performance hit from including classes
Message-ID: <004a01c2f828$59caabf0$e1951d18@enobrev>

Up until now, I've been only including (via require_once) only the
classes I need within the script that's executing.  My upload class for
file processors, database class for mysql, my dropdown class for
selects, etc, etc.  I suppose it would be much cleaner and more
manageable if I included them all in my application_top.php or
configure.php file.
 
Does anyone know how much of a performance hit it would be to include
all 6 or 8 classes at once?
 
Thank You

I ran into this problem on a couple of my lists.  The culprit turned out to 
be unauthorized, third-party web archives.  Bots were subscribed which fed 
my lists to their archives, operated by sharks scavenging the net for 
content to wrap their advertising around.

Googling on "nyphp" reveals one site (alicebot) which has mirrored at least 
some NYPHP posts.  One of the bigger ones I found archiving my TBL list 
apparently blocked search engine 'bots so it didn't show up on the search 
engines at all.  A subscriber told me about it.  Of course, robots.txt is 
only advisory and useless against address mining robots.  They had five 
years of my digests published on their site.

It really depends on how much traffic you're dealing with.  If it's mild
traffic, I doubt you'd see any difference - obviously more traffic would have
a greater impact.

If I remember correctly, here are some details on the include/require family
(please correct me if I've made a mistake):

require/require_once
   -- compile time (using a cache will make the overhead very small)
   -- require_once() has more overhead than require()

include/include_once
   -- runtime directives (more expensive than any of the require()s)
   -- include_once() has more overhead than include()

You might want to try something like Spamassassin to tag/divert
your spam. I receive, on average, about 400 pieces of junk mail
per day. With a combination of email client filters + spamassassin,
I'm down to reading/deleting only about 5 unwated daily spams.
That is roughly 2-3% of my daily email ham - which, for me, is acceptable.

Thank you!!

What I did was change the includes to Dan's format:
<? include("./copyright.html") ?>

And change all the files (i.e. formerly index.html, aboutus.html) to .php
as per the suggestion from Louie (Translated by Tim).

Thanks!!

That's a deal on ASP and AMP Technology Training -- $780, I figured it

I knew it. As soon as we start using ASP, the site is full of bugs.

Can I suggest dropping the LAMP and AMP acronyms altogether?  It should now
be WISA for Windows, IIS, Sql Server, ASP.

You may have problems when the group needs to change it's name to NYASP
since this domain is already taken by some school pshycologists.  Probably
don't want to negotiate with them for the name either, they might think our
transition is crazy.

Jim

P.S.  Did any of you catch the latest Gateway commercial on TV where they
mention PHP?

Today is "All Fools Day".  It's an American tradition that might
not be well know to people from other cultures.

One year, working at a large company, every member of my entire
department put letters of resignation in the boss' in-box.

"...entire department put letters of resignation in the boss' in-box."
This could really backfire for someone in the dept!

I was considering for last 2 weeks of getting a cheap wedding ring and
performing a mock marriage proposal to a rather pessimistic lady I know,
but she might end up with hurt feelings or worst yet- take me seriously!?

Choose your jests wisely.  But enjoy!

LONG LIVE Bill Gates & ASP!

I don't think this is originally an American tradition.  In fact it
originated in Europe.  It has to be really old, since some european
countries still use a latin name for it -'Primo Aprilis'.

cheers,

another reason why I love php:

Seeing a dog on the top of my phpinfo page gave me the chills for a sec,
before realizing it's April's fools ;)
Anyway, just wanted to be sure this was just a harmless easter egg:

A closer look at /ext/standard/info.c...

if ((ta->tm_mon==3) && (ta->tm_mday==1)) {
   PUTS("?="PHP_EGG_LOGO_GUID"\\" alt=\\"Thies!\\" /></a>");
} else {
   PUTS("?="PHP_LOGO_GUID"\\" alt=\\"PHP Logo\\" /></a>");
}

Once again, another reason why I love php and open source... and another
moment to wonder how much crap there's behind windows that we can't see  ;)

I might take a moment to point out just how many of us never read the

Thanks Carlos!

unintentional surprises, as well!)

Regardless of origin, it IS an American tradition.  As with most
of our culture, I'm sure we stole it fair and square from somewhere.

I just started reading this article:

      http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-linphp/

and the first sentence caught my eye
"In contrast with other open source languages like Perl and Python, PHP
lacks a robust community effort to develop a math library."

Anyway, php has some math functions built in the standard module (and also
bcmath)... but I don't recall any advanced math libraries (lineal algebra,
statistics, series, complex numbers).

I am originally a mathematician with good experience in algorithms, and
would be interested in building (or at least sizing the possibility of) an
advanced math module for php. Could this be worth it for PHP ?

If anybody is aware of any work being conducted in that direction, is
interested in discussing this a bit more, has any suggestions of other
contacts in that area, please reply or contact me directly

thanks,

Carlos

I thought someone out there might know how to do that as I am trying to
help a friend with a rather complex Excel formula he has to write and my
rudimentary VB and Excel formula-writing skills are not helping right
offhand.

All he wants is a means of translating a letter grade in a column of cells
into a number (e.g. "A-" or "a-" -> 3.7 or "B+" or "b+" -> 3.3).

Thanx
Phil

I use the VLOOKUP function.  I have two columns which look like this:

0     F
60    D
65    D+
70    C
etc...

Let's say that starts at cell A1, and goes through B8.

Now, if cell D15 has a number grade in it, put this in E15 to
calculate the letter grade:

=vlookup( D15, A1:B8, 2 )

That means, look up the value stored in D15 in the table mentioned
above in the cells A1 through B8, and return what you find in the
second column, which is the letter grades.

No macro needed, so now you can e-mail it to people and they won't
flip out.

The last thing I do is make a separate worksheet with the letter
grades, so from each section's worksheet, I just refer to the grades
worksheet:

=vlookup( D15, 'Letter Grades'!A1:B8, 2 )

Done.

I am having a persistent problem with Javascript appearing in the body of
my .php page when it first loads.

NOTE: the code in question is NOT in the body of the page -- it's in the
head.  Sometimes it's just a half a line of code, other times it's a
combination of Javascript from the head and partial HTML tags from the
body. I had noticed that it seems to start with a particular line of code,
and I have since gone through and cleaned up and reduced the number of
lines of script (removed comments, vestigial routines, etc.) but the
problem persists.

On Reload/Refresh the page rights itself and all is well.

Any ideas?

Clyde

I hate to be this way, but your friend must be doing something wrong.  I
just did a mockup in Excel 97 (we're still in the dark ages here) and it
worked fine going from string to number.

If you're going to go the VBA route, there is a "Switch Case" construct,
instead of using a bunch of if-elses.

Can someone do me a favor and run this script with the latest release of PHP

<?php
$t = gmmktime(2, 0, 0, 4, 6, 2003);
printf('%d = %s expected 2:00 AM<br>', $t, gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s T', $t));
$t = gmmktime(2, 30, 0, 4, 6, 2003);
printf('%d = %s expected 2:30 AM<br>', $t, gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s T', $t));
$t = gmmktime(3, 0, 0, 4, 6, 2003);
printf('%d = %s expected 3:00 AM<br>', $t, gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s T', $t));
 
gmmktime(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1970); // causes later calls to gmmktime to be wrong
 
$t = gmmktime(2, 0, 0, 4, 6, 2003);
printf('%d = %s expected 2:00 AM<br>', $t, gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s T', $t));
$t = gmmktime(2, 30, 0, 4, 6, 2003);
printf('%d = %s expected 2:30 AM<br>', $t, gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s T', $t));
$t = gmmktime(3, 0, 0, 4, 6, 2003);
printf('%d = %s expected 3:00 AM<br>', $t, gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s T', $t));
?>
 
I'm running version 4.2.1 and the output makes no sense to me.
 
1049590800 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 01:00:00 GMT expected 2:00 AM
1049592600 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 01:30:00 GMT expected 2:30 AM
1049598000 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 03:00:00 GMT expected 3:00 AM
1049598000 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 03:00:00 GMT expected 2:00 AM
1049599800 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 03:30:00 GMT expected 2:30 AM
1049598000 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 03:00:00 GMT expected 3:00 AM

First off, calling gmmktime in the middle of the script changes the return
value of later gmmktime calls even though they are identical to the first
set of calls. Second, I figured gmmktime(2, 0, 0, 4, 6, 2003) would always
return 2 AM even though that's when the time "Springs forward" for me.
 
Thanks!

printf('%d = %s expected 3:00 AM<br>', $t, gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s T', $t)); 
?>

I'm running version 4.2.1 and the output makes no sense to me.

1049590800 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 01:00:00 GMT expected 2:00 AM 
1049592600 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 01:30:00 GMT expected 2:30 AM 
1049598000 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 03:00:00 GMT expected 3:00 AM 
1049598000 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 03:00:00 GMT expected 2:00 AM 
1049599800 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 03:30:00 GMT expected 2:30 AM 
1049598000 = Sun, 06 Apr 2003 03:00:00 GMT expected 3:00 AM

First off, calling gmmktime in the middle of the script changes the return
value of later gmmktime calls even though they are identical to the first
set of calls. Second, I figured gmmktime(2, 0, 0, 4, 6, 2003) would always
return 2 AM even though that's when the time "Springs forward" for me.

Thanks!
Lance

Hi All:

I just rebuilt my copy of PHP to enable gd support...but now my apache keeps
trying to get me to download my php pages...I've kept my existing httpd.conf
file, which was working perfectly fine before.

Does anyone know why this happens?

Thanks,

Probably not what you wanted to see.  That's on a FreeBSD 4.7 system, 
and there are significant bugs (that I think some of the PHP folks are 
trying to skirt :) in relation to DST, mktime() and BSD.

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=22163

is just one of them.  Search for mktime and gmmktime at bugs.php.net as 
well.

I might be way off base here, but for some reason I have the feeling
that GMT has no Daylight Savings setting.  You ever notice that we're
either -0500 or -0400, depending on the time of the year?  I think
that's what you're running into.

Of course, I may be wrong.

Subject: Caching only images (to save Bandwidth)
Message-ID: <006b01c2f9a3$25c6b480$0164a8c0@com1>

Hello Peeps,

Is it possible to cache only images at my ISP? My exact situation is that my site has thousands of images, that I want to share among lot of users without loading it from server each time. I know i can use browser cache, but it can store whole documents including images but it works for 1 client only and I don't want to cache whole document, but i just want to cache only images. Morover I prefer to cache images on my ISP server rather than relying on client's browser cache. 

In short if user A request a page that laods from server then ISP should retain all images on it's cache and when user B request same page or a such page that contains same images, then images should be loaded from that ISP only not by loading it from my server so that I can save my valuable Bandwidth.

Thanks,

Anirudh Zala

It's every list's nightmare: bad procmail rules.  A recently subscribed
member has an error in his procmail rules, which reflects all mail right back
to the list - without rewriting any headers.  This is obviously very bad.

The user has been isolated, and while I don't think it was malicious, we're
keeping an eye on it.  My apologies for the spam, and enjoy your day!

Assuming I understand completly, the answer is no.

No - you have no control over how other people access your site.  If user is
using an ISP that uses caching, and you have proper caching headers set on
your pages, then it'll save you bandwidth.  But you have no way of enforcing
this.

That said, there is a *slight* chance that you could work something out with
*your* ISP, whereby they cache content for you, and for some insane reason
would charge you less for the bandwidth used, but this is all highly
unlikely.

Probably not what you wanted to see.  That's on a FreeBSD 4.7 system, 
and there are significant bugs (that I think some of the PHP folks are 
trying to skirt :) in relation to DST, mktime() and BSD.

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=22163

is just one of them.  Search for mktime and gmmktime at bugs.php.net as

I agree, although am skeptical on the "robust community effort to develop a
math library" for the aforementioned languages, as well.

Regardless, PHP is geared toward Internet connectivity, databases, and
frontend types of manipulation.  Not until recently has it been recognized as
useful for other, "old school" jobs, and there is a lot of room to grow.

I haven't seen anything like this either.  That said, there are some
libraries for graphing functionality (not just drawing the actual graph, but
doing the number crunching), albeit not onpar, last I looked, with some of
the C libs for similar purposes.

I think so; especially from the perspective of graphing, statistics and
analysis.  It could be hugely useful in the mapping, financial/stock markets,
and scientific arenas.

I wish I could help more than saying what a good idea it would be.  This
doesn't help much:

http://www.google.com/search?q=php+math+library

but:

http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=98&discrim=164

may be a nice list of libraries that would be canidates for wrapping in a PHP
extension.

That is the kind of thing a service like Akamai does for you.  They 
store copies of whatever images or video you want on servers all over 
the world and when someone makes a request the data is drawn from the 
server closest to the requester.  Go to Akamai.com for more info.  
Otherwise I agree with Hans, you can't do it.

One thing you could try doing is having all of your images go through a 
php script, send some cache headers, then output the image.
Alternatively you could see if there was something you could put in a 
.htaccess that would do the same thing.

This may or may not work but it's definately worth a try.

For more info on caching headers see

Message-ID: <HNEIIKCCBICBCOEIJDEOOENJENAA.danporcher@earthlink.net>

Can anyone tell me why I can't successfully write out session variables.

I'm test in a Windows AMP environment. I doublechecked the session folder in
php.ini and I'm successfully creating and deleting the sessions themselves.
When I look at the variables in the session file after I execute the code
below, all I see is:

!ses_user|


The code:

<?php

session_start();

loginuser();

function loginuser()
{

   global $_POST;
   global $_SESSION;

   $userid = $_POST['userid'];
   $passwd = $_POST['passwd'];

   //I validate user against DB here, if valid I write out session variables

   $_SESSION['ses_user'] = $userid;
   $_SESSION['ses_access'] = odbc_result($rsSecurity,'AccessType');
   $_SESSION['ses_orgtype'] = odbc_result($rsSecurity,'OrgType');
   $_SESSION['ses_orgid'] = odbc_result($rsSecurity,'OrgID');

}

you incur by including a file in php.  Specifically I have a script
with two main branches.  Does it make any sense to separate those out
into two different include files, or does the cost of getting a file
outweigh the cost of downloading both branches when only using one?

thanks,
David

The performace hit of reading a file should be very very small.
If the file is read often it'll probably be in the OS's file cache anyways,
so you won't even be reading it from disk.

This is unneeded, and may be your problem (although I'm pretty PHP would just
ignore it).  $_POST and $_SESSION are superglobals: they are available in all
scopes.

Double check that you're actually getting what you expect:
var_dump($userid);
var_dump($passwd);

>    $_SESSION['ses_user'] = $userid;
>    $_SESSION['ses_access'] = odbc_result($rsSecurity,'AccessType');
>    $_SESSION['ses_orgtype'] = odbc_result($rsSecurity,'OrgType');
>    $_SESSION['ses_orgid'] = odbc_result($rsSecurity,'OrgID');

This should work, although I would double check that the odbc_result() calls
return what you expect before investigating it as session troubles first. 
var_dump(); is your friend.

It might; if you expect a rise in traffic, or experience performance issues
now, you may see a benefit.  It's really a the cost of PHP reading and
compiling the files that's important.  I had a similar message about this:

http://nyphp.org/list/paralist_archive.php?L_mid=3771

( sorry folks - a new, SEARCHABLE mailing list archive is around the corner )

It really depends on your traffic and load if you can afford it or not.
For some web tools (low traffic), I've included all classes in a file
header to make maintenance easier, as well as code completeness.
This choice, of course, after having profiled my code and realized that
initialization took around 10% of execution time (acceptable for this tool)
(this 10% was after using code cache, it was around 20% before).

The PHP Internals (nee php-dev) mailing list has a few messages from
Rasmus about this topic. (Say about 1-2 months ago.)

In general, unless you're running FreeBSD, things are pretty fast. If
you're running FreeBSD, things can be slow, especially under heavy
load. In his case, heavy load was Yahoo!, so YMMV. :) He made some
modifications to improve performance, so if you do find this to be a
problem, make sure you're running the most recent CVS code, as I don't
know if those patches made it into the current final release.

Sorry if this is a little off topic, but i was hoping to get some help with
a mod_rewrite problem.  I used a statement in my .htaccess with an error
that caused an infinite loop, and understandably my host got a bit peeved.
If I get it wrong again, they may cancel my account - the problem being,
that I think I have the error corrected, but I don't want to risk testing it
and losing my hosting.

What I am trying to do is to make everything redirect to /index.php:  so
http://inexact.info/this/that would go to http://www.inexact.info/index.php
where lives php that would make use of /this/that as variables - thus
avoiding having urls like inexact.info/index.php?var1=this&var2=that.

Is the following correct to put in .htaccess and achieve this goal, or will
it simply loop infinitly and cause me to get booted from dreamhost?


RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule !\\.(gif|jpg|png|css)$ /home/risoeng/inexact.info/index.php

Thanks,
Melissa

Message-ID: <HNEIIKCCBICBCOEIJDEOEEOOENAA.danporcher@earthlink.net>

I appear to be setting the Session variables within the program, but nothing
is actually being stored on the server once the program ends.  If I open the
session file after the php file is run, the file is completely blank.

At first I thought the problem was related to the fact that I was using a
redirect after I set the variables, but removing the redirect made no
difference.

Any other thoughts?

My understanding of how sessions should work is you use session_start() to
create a new session if none exists or access the current session, if it
currently exists.  Writing to a session variable will either create a new
one if it doesn't exist or overwrite an existing value if the variable has
already been created.  Is this correct?

Dan

Here are the var_dumps:

POST:
array(4) { ["action"]=> string(9) "loginuser" ["userid"]=> string(10)
"testagency" ["passwd"]=> string(6) "agency" ["submit"]=> string(5)
"Enter" }

SESSION before accessing DB:
array(0) { }

SESSION after writing variables from DB:
array(4) { ["ses_user"]=> string(10) "testagency" ["ses_access"]=> string(1)
"1" ["ses_orgtype"]=> string(1) "1" ["ses_orgid"]=> string(1) "1" }

ID: 8b516266d29b2b69fb47f2c3145f53f9

Hans,

your comment:

"If  user is using an ISP that uses caching, and you have proper caching
headers set on your pages, then it'll save you bandwidth"

Here seems some hope, then i would like to know what are those proper
"caching headers set" that i need to set in my php script. Consider below
example of function header. (page will be cached for for 1 day, including
all objects that reside in it)

header("Cache-Control: max-age=86400, must-revalidate");

Above function caches page on client or isp (for now forget where it
stores), BUT it stores whole document. While i need to store only IMAGES
that resides in this document. So do ineed to write above header in some
other way so that it will cache only images rather than docment? In short is
there any other arguments like
"Content-type: image/jpg" that i need to pass in above header functions so
that i can cache only images NOT document. I assume it is possible but i
just don't know how, nor i could find any example anywhere.

Thanks,

Anirudh Zala

Embedded resources such as images are fetched with a separate HTTP request.
What does this mean? It means that the HTTP headers you use in blah.php do not
affect the caching behavior of images within blah.php in any way.

If your images are generated by a PHP script (for example, you use <img
src="/image_generator.php">), then you can use header() calls in the
image_generator.php script to alter the headers of images.

Otherwise (this is the more common case), the headers returned for images
relies completely on your Web server and has nothing to do with your PHP.

Hope that helps; I actually wasn't following this thread, but I wanted to throw
that in. It has been known to cause great confusion (and I'm not entirely sure
I explained it clearly).

Chris,

This is right. I am not generating any images using my php script, those are
just static ones that reside in images directory and is being used in php
scripts. My document outputs 270 kb as results including 100kb of those
static images that remains static all the time. So i assumed that if
somehow, by passing headers or something like that i can tell browser cache
or isp cache to store those images at locally and always using from there
only, whenever requested. So for me my script will output only 170 kb and  i
can handle more clients and can save my bandwidth. But i guess it was my
misunderstanding. what do u think?

Thanks

Anirudh Zala

Do any of you by any chance know how to check if a script is called via
command line or from a browser?
 
I have a script that is called from either one, and I need to change the
output methods accordingly.  Looking at the phpinfo, I don't see any
variable that seems like a solid "this is from the command line".
 
Oh, and to slip a second one in here.  What is $_SERVER['PWD']?  I
noticed it shows the dir structure to the current file on my server,
which is fantastic.  Is that what it's supposed to do?  And what does
PWD stand for.

I don't know if this is the right way, but it might work:

'PHP_SELF' 
	The filename of the currently executing script, relative to the
document root. For instance, $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] in a script at the address
http://example.com/test.php/foo.bar would be /test.php/foo.bar. 
	If PHP is running as a command-line processor, this variable is not
available. 
Also, I am curious what get_browser() returns or 'HTTP_USER_AGENT'  under
CLI

It stands for "present working directory". What you could do is run your
command line script from a specific directory and then use $_SERVER['PWD']
to determine if it's in the command-line only directory. Unless you have
some requirements for running it from a specific location.

Sorry if this is a little off topic, but i was hoping to get some help with
a mod_rewrite problem.  I used a statement in my .htaccess with an error
that caused an infinite loop, and understandably my host got a bit peeved.
If I get it wrong again, they may cancel my account - the problem being,
that I think I have the error corrected, but I don't want to risk testing it
and losing my hosting.

What I am trying to do is to make everything redirect to /index.php:  so
http://inexact.info/this/that would go to http://www.inexact.info/index.php
where lives php that would make use of /this/that as variables - thus
avoiding having urls like inexact.info/index.php?var1=this&var2=that.

Is the following correct to put in .htaccess and achieve this goal, or will
it simply loop infinitly and cause me to get booted from dreamhost?


RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule !\\.(gif|jpg|png|css)$ /home/risoeng/inexact.info/index.php

Would also redirect index.php to index.php! I am sure that this is not what
you want.

Try something adding "NOT index.php" in your regular expression.

So it seems to me that you MUST put the PHP code in the INCLUDED file IN and ?> in order for it to be parsed. It doesn't matter that you are

It will not be parsed if it is not in .

I like the new appearance, more organized and sophisticated. But....
#1)  Sluggish - ... was this new site made with coldfusion?!
	Takes at least 3-4 seconds to load/render most pages.
#2) The "Store"...Love it ! Didn't know NYPHP mugs and teddy bears were
available.  Even a NYPHP Thong!

My hat's off to the dev.nyphp team! Kudos!

Subject: Parameter Question
Message-ID: <20030410173746.46279.qmail@web11508.mail.yahoo.com>


I'm trying to pass the parameter '#' between PHP programs, as in:

program.php?letter=# 

and I'm finding the '#' parameter does not get passed, although other alphanumeric characters do. I just need confirmation '#' is a reserved character that cannot be used as a parameter. Also, what other restrictions are placed on parameters? Do they have to be alphanumeric?

Thanks,

Jeremy

The pound sign indicates a fragment in a URL, so it is an invalid character to
be used otherwise. All you have to do, however, is URL encode it:

program.php?letter=<? echo urlencode('#'); ?>

That's a bit verbose, but you get the idea. :-)

You might be speaking about the "yahoo store" proprietary language.
They claim it's a "real programming language", but the only time I had to
deal with it I found it quite hard to work with...

Yes, you are right. but have to know it if I want the store be
more like a website. Did you try to build a template? Is there a
way I can edit it in local machine? what is the file 's
extension? Can I just use IE or netscape to run it?

thanks for your help!

Jeremy,
Some characters need to be URL-encoded in order to be included in a URL.
# should be represented as %23.. in your case:
program.php?letter=%23

These should help:

since it has my name on the subject, I might as well answer it ;)

I haven't had much exposure to RTML, but as tech lead on a store migration
from Yahoo, I played around with this code.
I know RTML was developed by a small group of folks who didn't quite
document it... my impression is that it's a holdover from the 'good old
days' and that they don't know how to get rid of it. (yeahh, I know, I'm
also thinking they should replace it with php).

Resources: I remember downloading an ebook ("RTML for Yahoo! Store") which
was useless, think I lost the file, but if I find it I'll send it to you.
I am not aware of any compiler or local environment to do local
development.

I also remember that I felt the same frustration, since being not
documented, an industry of "specialized firms" that make yahoo stores, and
they are not releasing any documentation or knowledge that they might have.

It's still hard to believe why yahoo decided on a proprietary language,
instead of some open standard... well, maybe they learned the lesson and
that's why they are going for php now...

The site is slightly slower, since it does more, but I've never seen anywhere
near 3-4 seconds to load up.  We're continuing to make some tweaks, so keep
an eye on it and let us know how things end up.

Subject: PHP/ASP anomaly
Message-ID: <29950-2200345111351250@M2W046.mail2web.com>

Hey.. the past few days I've noticed a rather strange phenomenon occur..

On my website (http://valsignalandet.com) I have a link to some pages on a
site that are written in ASP (because of the demands of the host those
pages are on).  On occasion the site will go berzerk due to possible memory
leaks on the server end and thus my ASP pages will all crash..

All but one..

This one page is called up by a PHP script I wrote on my V?l site
(http://valsignalandet.com/events/calendar.php), and every time everything
else crashes on the site where the ASP scripts are, this one PHP page
consistently pulls up the remote ASP script anyway!

What does anyone make of that? I'm both dumbfounded and devilishly
delighted at the same time! >:)

Phil

Message-ID: <20030411134333.64662.qmail@web12803.mail.yahoo.com>


Good morning,

New York PHP is in need of one or two more exhibitors for PHPCon 2003.  The
badge would give you access to both Opening and Closing keynote addresses,
all evening sessions (after 6 pm on Thursday), and all social events.

The needed times are:

Set Up and Clean Up:
Display space set up: Wednesday, April 23, 2003 - 2 pm to 6 pm
Display space clean up: Friday, April 25, 2003 - 5 pm to 8 pm

Exhibit hours:
Thursday, April 24, 2003 - 9 am to 6 pm
Friday, April 25, 2003 - 9 am to 5 pm

Evening Sessions:
Thursday, April 24, 2003 - 6 pm to 9 pm


We currently have spotty coverage, so someone who could dedicate at least one
or two full days would be great.

Thank you,


=====

Subject: MySQL & 2.5 million rows!
Message-ID: <4b59d74b8c12.4b8c124b59d7@optonline.net>

You read the subject line correctly!!! I'm loading 2.5 million rows from an ASCII file into a MySQL database. So...here's a little background on what I've done and then a question. (Please keep in mind I'm a Php/MySQL newbie...though I'm learnin' fast!!)

I created three tables - data_new, data_old, data_live. The Ascii file gets read, line by line, and inserted into data_new. When it's completed and there are no glitches (i.e., no problem with the Ascii file), I want to move the data from data_live to data_old and then move the new data from data_new to data_live. So...the question...is there a fast way to move the data from one MySQL table to another (from data_new to data_live) other than walking through data_new row by row...creating an Insert statement on the fly...and then inserting the row into data_live?

BTW, in case you are wondering why there are three different tables, I felt that this was a better way  than my client's present system which simply wipes out the live data and then reads in the Ascii file. If there is a glitch then they have to empty the table and reload the Ascii. Doing it this way, if they need to go back to the old data, I would move it data from data_old to data_live.

phpMyAdmin has a nice tool to do it for you.

But this is all that it's really doing.

INSERT INTO dbTwo.tableName SELECT * FROM dbOne.tableName

a better system would be to store all of the data in one table and then
have a "status" table that kept track of what was live data, old data,
etc.  then when you want to pull the "live" data, you query the
"status" table which holds a foreign key to the data table.

no moving data around.  no duplication of data.

phpMyAdmin is GREAT tool. However, this is something that the "end user" (i.e., my client) would be doing and I don't want to allow them to use phpMyAdmin. 

I had thought of the the Insert into...select statement but, though I hadn't tried it...I was bit concerned since the select statement would pull 2.5 million rows...unless MySql is smart enough to handle this without running out of memory or temp space.

Hey Jeff

Why don't you put all of the data into the same table and add a smallint
field to keep the status of a particular record (i.e. showing which group it
belongs)? If needed, you can make it 2 or 3 different fields. That way
you'll have just one table and if I'm not missing something, it should work
pretty fast compared to your 3 table structure.

Good luck.

A status table or an additional column that notes whether the data is live/old/new? Keep in mind that the website gets about 1000 inquiries daily that hit this particular table...that's why I thought about 3 separate tables. (Having it all in one table would be about 7.5 million rows).

You may want to save time and not move the data around at all.

The idea would be to have 3 tables all structured the same each named
uniquely.  Start by loading up table 1, then in the application point the
data to table1.  When doing the next import, detect that table 1 contains
the live data so use table2 to import the data.  If the data imports
correctly, change the app to point to table2, table1 now becomes your old
data.  Next import table 3 becomes your import, then live, table 2 becomes
old, table 1 gets emptied ready for next import.  Next import, 1 becomes
import then live, table 3 becomes old, table 2 gets emptied ready for next
import.

Hope you get the idea.

Jim

With a status field approach you will have to modify all your queries to
filter on the appropriate status.  With staying with a 3 table design you
avoid concerns about mistakenly pulling old data when you are expecting to
pull live data.

A similar suggestion to the one below is to rename the tables to do the move.
The table naming then can remain human readable at any given time.

I've gotten a lot of great suggestions (thanks so much for the quick response...I hope to get to one of the NYPHP meetings some day) and I definitely *LIKE* the table renaming idea. 

Now...of course...I've got to make a choice as to which method to use!!  :)

One word of warning for the table renaming, it relies on specifics of the
SQL Server in use, ie. mySQL.  This would mean that If you were to change
out your DB Server in the future, you are not assured that your app will
still work without tweaks.  If no plans are to ever change the SQL Server
then the renameing is probably the simplies solution.

Message-ID: <4b830c4ba1de.4ba1de4b830c@optonline.net>

Did a quick search and noticed the following concerning table renaming:

"The rename is done atomically, which means that no other thread can access any of the tables while the rename is running." (from MySQL online docs.)

Correct me if I'm wrong but this would mean that website visitors would not be able to query the database during this operation. Is that correct?

How about just renaming the tables?  All the references to the tables 
stay the same, and you just have to add the instruction to juggle the 
table names.

What's involved with writing some of my functions in C and plugging them

Once they are plugged-in do I have to recompile PHP?

Do I have to restart Apache every time I make a change?

What kind of speed bonus can I expect?

Links? Stories? Wisdom?

I just pulled in a gig (finally).  They are building a literary
reference guide. 
 
Well, while planning they hit me with something I'm not too versed in.
They want to eventually have something they called "fingerprint"
searching.  The term alone meant nothing to me (beyond the obvious -
which google agreed with).
 
Basically it has something to do with using synonyms and misspellings
and all types of other fun algorithms to find what a user is looking
for.  Does anyone hear have any experience with such things, or maybe
know where to look?
 
Thanks!!

I'm not sure about synonyms, but support for misspelled words can typically be
achieved with the Levenshtein algorithm, and PHP supports that:

Hope that helps.

Hi,

Is there any PHP library or tool that would allow me to search the site without a database?  Some leads would be appreciated.

If your search terms are in a database you could search with LIKE. Some databases can search for things that sound like something, too.

That is correct, but only for the duration of the rename which take 
only a split second.

Sounds to me like your looking for fuzzy logic.  The misspellings etc. sound
like phonetic lookups where each word is attempted to be converted into
phonetic tokens then looked up by them with a nearness factor set which may
mean if the phrase breaks into 20 phonetics and a nearness of 80% then if 18
phonetics match return it.

Seems about right on.. and definitely worth looking into.  A google on
fuzzy logic gives me a good starting point.  Hopefully I can expand it
all enough to moisten the client..

Thanks a lot to all of you.

Message-ID: <E7F20B466062D511973800508B6DBC6C0586BCE0@MDRCI-C02-EXCH>

First, there is a free option (depending on the number of total pages) that
I've used before.  That would be Atomz.com's "Atomz Search"
(http://www.atomz.com/search/.

I've utilized their services before for small to medium sites.  You set up
the search pages with your CSS and/or background, tell the spider at Atomz
what to catalog at your site, how often to do it, and then let it work
auto-majicly.  There is an Atomz ad when your results come up... but it's a
great solution if you don't have a lot of time or $$ and a smaller site.

Second, you might look into a Verity Search solution using PHP.  Verity uses
a series of flat files for it's "collection", so mySql would not be
necessary.
(I could give you more info on that if you'd like).

Third, Check out the resources available on SearchEngineWatch.com:
http://www.searchenginewatch.com/resources/article.php/2156591

This is a great resources for what you are trying to do....

Hi,

Not sure if this helps (this is my first post!) but you may want to look at the SOUNDEX function in MySQL (All major DB vendors provide it, too). Here's a link:

http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/String_functions.html

The soundex listing reads:
SOUNDEX(str)
    Returns a soundex string from str. Two strings that sound almost the same should have identical soundex strings. A standard soundex string is 4 characters long, but the SOUNDEX() function returns an arbitrarily long string. You can use SUBSTRING() on the result to get a standard soundex string. All non-alphanumeric characters are ignored in the given string. All international alpha characters outside the A-Z range are treated as vowels:

mysql> SELECT SOUNDEX('Hello');
        -> 'H400'
mysql> SELECT SOUNDEX('Quadratically');
        -> 'Q36324'

MS-SQL also has a DIFFERENCE function that compares the difference of the SOUNDEX pattern results between 2 strings.

-- Using DIFFERENCE
SELECT DIFFERENCE('Smithers', 'Smythers')
-- The difference returned is 4 (lowest possible difference).


Hope this helps...

Cheers,

Israel F.

Levenshtein is pretty useless in this case.  It'll tell you what words are semantically
equivalent, sure, but it doesn't do spelling correction.  I suggest you take a look 
at using pspell for spell checking.  As for synonyms, you need a pretty large dictionary
for that - take a  look freshmeat.

I normally help my clients implement some flavor of dedicated Google 
search. Even on the free version they let you brand the results pages 
with a logo and colors.

http://www.google.com/services/index.html
and specifically http://www.google.com/services/free.html

If the content you want to index is already online, it's a quick, simple 
solution.

That's arguable, but vacation responders should use the Return-Path anyway.

First, there is a free option (depending on the number of total pages) that
I've used before.  That would be Atomz.com's "Atomz Search"
(http://www.atomz.com/search/.

I've utilized their services before for small to medium sites.  You set up
the search pages with your CSS and/or background, tell the spider at Atomz
what to catalog at your site, how often to do it, and then let it work
auto-majicly.  There is an Atomz ad when your results come up... but it's a
great solution if you don't have a lot of time or $$ and a smaller site.

Second, you might look into a Verity Search solution using PHP.  Verity uses
a series of flat files for it's "collection", so mySql would not be
necessary.
(I could give you more info on that if you'd like).

Third, Check out the resources available on SearchEngineWatch.com:
http://www.searchenginewatch.com/resources/article.php/2156591

This is a great resources for what you are trying to do....

Hi,
Speaking of the search techniques, I have a small client with a static
shop-like website who wants search abilities for a CD catalog.  There is no
database available, but PHP is operational.

Is there any PHP library or tool that would allow me to search the site
without a database?  Some leads would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Stephen

I'm not sure about synonyms, but support for misspelled words can
typically be
achieved with the Levenshtein algorithm, and PHP supports that:

Thanks to all for the suggestions.

Patrick Fee,
What is this Verity Search you speak of?

The client has a CD catalog.  The client will soon have over 300 CDs for 
sale, and would like customers to be able to search the site to find 
this catalog information.
The business doesn't not have a lot of money (even $200 is a stretch 
right now), so I need something low-cost.  I'm helping this client as a 
personal favor, so I'm using what PHP knowledge I've acquired to help 
strengthen my understanding.

Thanks,
Stephen

Subject: GNUbie // Need help with coding problem
Message-ID: <200304120120.VAA32636@www20.ureach.com>

Hello!

I am trying to learn PHP and attended the "GNUbies" meeting on
Wednesday, April 9th on the "Introduction to PHP".  I am using 

phpNuke for a web site I am working on.  It was suggested that I
post a problem I am having on the NewYorkPHP mailing list.

I would like to get the login boxes to change to Private
Messages when a member logs in.

I attempled to do this at the bottom of the header, under where,
I have "Create an Account" change to "Welcome 
(MemberName)[Logout] after a Member logs into the site.

I have not been able to get it to work.  Please see the phpNuke
v6.0 site located at,
http://members.lycos.co.uk/testmenow/nuke/index.php

The code that would control the present display and change I am
trying to get is in two files.  The "theme.php" and "header.php"
files.

I placed the working "header.php" code back (that is the code on
the site presently) just so the site would look better.

Because I do not know the policy of the mailing list about
attachments, I am placing the code inside of this e-mail below
.
theme.php
header.php (This is the "header.php" code on the site now)
header2.php (What I tried and did not work)

I have also created a login so you can see what I am talking
about.
UserID:  sitetester
Password:  sitetester

If you look at the block titled "User Info" on the top right of
the page, you will see the login boxes have changed into a 

"Private Messages" area after you login.  I just want to get the
login boxes on the top of the page to change into the  the 

"Private Messages" portion  that you see on this block.  I do
not want the rest of the information on the block.  

Thanks in advance for any and all help you can give me.

Maybe a Unix guru will correct me, in which case I shall be happy to 
learn, but I don't think there are any standard commands that do this. 
There are, however, a number of shell scripts out there that do.

Yeah, that's frustrating. I feel the same way every time I try to pipe 
commands together in DOS. :-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] RTML -- yahoo store tools
Message-ID: <200304140422.h3E4MSae006499@gw00.com>

LY et. al.,

	I have had to work with RTML for Yahoo! store, since
our company's business practically runs on Yahoo! stores (for
better or for worse).  I have written a bunch of PHP/cURL tools
for replicating a Yahoo! store in a local MySQL database, which
allows for much quicker and easier editing, as well as the
ability to do a lot of global changes which would be next-to-
impossible with the Y! store editors.

	(For example, on Friday we had to replace all of
our chocolate accessories with fudge, since fudge doesn't
melt in shipping during warmer months.  We did this in about
two minutes with a few MySQL queries, and then uploaded
this data back to Yahoo! in a background process.  The same
process with just the Yahoo! editor would have taken
several labor-intensive hours and would have been error-prone.)

	There is one *book* on RTML which I'm trying to get back
from a former employee who "borrowed" it.  It is rumored to be
better than any of those unofficial and incomplete online
documentations.  Hopefully I'll see it in the next few days,
so I could give you a better comment then.  Our only other
documentation was a photocopied Word (or PDF?) document which
I could find out more on tomorrow as well if you want.  It
at least got me "up the ramp" with RTML, but then it left me
there with nowhere else to go except trial, error, and a whole
bunch of unanswered questions.  (RTML is, oddly enough, *not*
supported by Yahoo!)

	There is apparently no editor for RTML other than
the annoying click-based HTML online editor.  Each element
and argument must be assembled separately, and you cannot
copy, import, or export templates into, out of, or between
Yahoo! storefronts.  There is one company, however, which I
found easily from Google, which sells a Windows-based RTML
Template Editor, which allows you to do these things, in a
somewhat less cumbersome manner.  However, its interface
with Yahoo! is the same as the human's; i.e. apparently
the software must click through all of those annoying element
edits... so uploading templates is not exactly an "atomic
operation."  Also, I believe their software is charged by
the number of templates you want to ever upload... i.e. you
have to keep "refilling" this software!

	Feel free to email me for more info on any of these
sub-topics, or to chat about any other RTML stuff.  I would be
interested in hearing your experiences with Y! stores.  Although
all of the tools I've built for Yahoo! store *are* in PHP,
(un?)-fortunately, RTML and other non-PHP-related Yahoo! topics
are probably outside the interests of this group....


Best, George.

How will the user be searching for the CD and what is the layout of the
static pages?

Do you ask the user to enter the genre (rock, jazz, rap, etc.), band name,
or album name?

Is the layout by genre, band name, album name, or other?

For an on-search site, you really need some type of database unless you
only have a few pages such that for example you have a page for rock CD's
another one for jazz CD's etc., and the user is confined to this type of
search.

If you have a non-restricted search with 300 pages and the user can put in
genre, band name, album name, all or some, etc., then you would really
need to have a database where you could query by the various fields and
spit out the links to the query results.

Hope this helps.

this is a continuation of my previous reply that is implicit in what I
wrote but I want to make it more clear.

Although your focus is on the actual search mechanishm, you also need to
look at the user interface design.  This will impact on what needs to be
done on the back end to deliver the desired results.

This will be important to you given the limited budget/resources your
friends have.

Hi Bruce,
Thanks for your input.

I agree with you on a need for a database-backed search engine hosted on at my client's site with searchable fields the way you describe.  But, between the infancy of the business (i.e. low funds) and my lack of technical know-how at the moment (i.e. learning as I go), such an implementation would appear too costly at the moment.

I think a general site search is fine.  On the suggestion of Chris and Patrick here on the list, I followed a link to Search Watch and Google.

It looks like my client is ok with Google's free SiteSearch.
My client just wants a basic way of search the domain.
I'll have to manage expectations if my client wants more. :)

Thanks for your input.

--Stephen

Just wanted to say "THANK YOU" for all the suggestions that were provided when I asked about the best way to deal with 2.5 million rows of data. The solution I decided on, and which works quite nicely, was to simply rename (and drop) tables as needed. This allows me to have the latest data and a copy of the previous version of the data. In addition, I can just switch table names if I need to go back.

Thanks so much for the GREAT response.

Well obviously this is writing extensions (PECL) and you can generally get a
good start with phpinstallpath/bin/phpize and:

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/streams.php

Negative.  You generally compile them as shared objects, then can dl() them.

Negative (AFAIK).

Depending on tasks, considerable.  For instance, heavy text parsing or
manipulation can probably get you big boosts.

Ahh, the hardest part.  Finding a nice HOWTO on the subject is impossible
AFAIK (if you find anything, please post it) and I've had the best luck with
the links above, some articles strewn around the net, and probably the best
is looking at other modules (dbg is nice).

Of course, some on this list write extensions day in and day out (look at the
ADT extension).

I'm not sure of a good HOWTO on the Web either, but I know Rasmus's book
(Programming PHP) has a pretty straightforward explanation (it implements
rot13, so the extension logic itself is as simple as possible).

I also seem to recall Sterling's book, PHP Developer's Cookbook, having a nice
explanation as well. Maybe he can confirm/deny that. :-)

Hi,

I am installing MySQL 4.0 on a Mac OSX 10.2.5 server and was having 
some trouble. Wondering if anyone else on here had any luck.

I follow the instructions to installing using the Mac OSX package and 
when I issue the command

./bin/mysqld_safe &

the daemon starts and then stops.

When I check the hostname.err log these errors are listed

InnoDB: Operating System error number 13 in a file operation.
InnoDB: The error means mysqld does not have the access rights to the 
directory.
InnoDB: File named ./ibdata1
InnoDB: Cannot continue operation.

I tried to find the file ./ibdata1 but didn't have any luck. I was 
going to try to change the permissions on it.

I was hoping someone on here had the same problem and new how to fix it.

This may be a shot in the dark, but are you executing this as root? If not,
that may be why you have the permission problem. If memory serves correctly,
enabling root access on OS X is deliberately difficult, so you may just want to
use sudo to execute that.

Also, thanks for mentioning mysqld_safe. I haven't kept up with MySQL 4, so I
didn't realize they switched the name around. :-)

You are better off not using dl() if possible. It's slower than using

Yeah - but dl is useful for development.  To be honest (I and most core
devs I know), just recompile php as a cli when debugging.  Using dl() is
an afterthought, since you rarely have to do a make clean anyway, it
takes just as much time, and usually requires less futzing (all your
object files are assured to reference the same symbols.)

Subject: Survey questions in new website
Message-ID: <4f18f34efe59.4efe594f18f3@optonline.net>

Some of these items may have already been addressed but...so ignore items that may have already been addressed.

Jeff
==================================

Survey page 1

1. "How did you first heard about PHP"

Should be, "How did you first hear.....

2. "Which platform have you seen used most for PHP development"

"Which platform have you seen PHP deployed to most for mission-critical applications deployment"

The phrasing is a bit awkward and the "intent" of the question may not be obvious to someone completing the survey. It's not obvious why you have the phrase "have you seen" as opposed to just saying "Which platform have you used most for PHP development." 

3. You may want to unpack this question a bit: "Based on your experience, has flexibility and rapid development been leveragable from PHP." I feel that "leveragable" needs further explanation or just rewording (perhaps a phrase describing "leveragable.").

4. Type: "For PHP questions/problems/support, rantk the order of where you go for help "

"rank" is mispelled.

Survey Page 2

1. "When working with clients, how is PHP most often brought onboard" and "When working with clients, what is the existing status of PHP in the majority of cases" could probably be combined into one question since the first question implies the "existing status" which is asked about again in the second question.

2. "Please estimate your non-HTML related PHP code base (Object Oriented % vs Prcedure %)"
Just a typo...should say "Procedural."

Message-ID: <004301c30469$82984400$de01a8c0@duron.lan.newageweb.com>

I'm trying to figure out how I can restrict people to using an <a href> link
to send a request to a script.
To be more specific I don't want them to send requests by submitting a form.
In case they do the script would respond with '401 Unauthorized' header or
something to that effect.  For a while I thought I had a solution.. by
looking for an additional GET var which would reflect the presence of a
'Submit' button, but then I realized that a form may be easily submitted
with JavaScript's submit() method == no additional GET vars.
I know it may seem like I worry too much, but in this project security is
*extremely* important.
I hope someone comes up with some clever idea..  my brain needs a reboot to
maintenance mode for a few hours..

cheers,
Jerry

Hi Jerry.

	The only way I can see how to do this is something
like the following PHP code:

<?php
if ( $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] == '' )
	my_fail_handler();
elseif ( $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST )
	my_fail_handler();

/* Else, continue normally... */
?>

	This will only work if HREFs to your PHP script
don't already have query string arguments.  I.e.,

	http://yourserver.com/yourscript.php

will work, but

	http://yourserver.com/yourscript.php?foo
	http://yourserver.com/yourscript.php?arg=test
	http://yourserver.com/yourscript.php?arg=test&arg2=test2

all will be rejected, so I hope that's okay....  Make sense?


Best, George.

You can't really do that. When someone clicks a link, their browser sends an
HTTP GET request. If someone wanted to write their own form that used a method
of "get" and submitted to the same URL, they could reproduce this exact same
request. Of course, they could also just manually send their own GET request,
though that is less convenient.

I'm not sure what sort of security you think is lessened by this fact. If you
are wanting to make sure people can only access a particular page, it is best
to use sessions or something and just make sure that person has access.

If you are particularly concerned that the user clicked your specific link, you
can use something like a shared secret. For example, when you generate the
link, attach a URL variable to it that you also keep on the server (in the
session or something). You can then check to ensure that this URL variable is
correct when determining whether the user can access the page.

Maybe that gives you some ideas. I recommend, however, that you don't concern
yourself with what happens on the client. This can lead to a false sense of
security. It is best to consider each HTTP request as a request that can truly
be anything. Use your own programming logic to determine the rest.

Hope that helps.

Chris

This wouldn't really help. The url will have a query string as is. When I
mentioned detecting a GET var reflecting the presence of the 'Submit'
button, it would be an additional GET var to the ones generated by the query
string.

Thanks for your help,

Yeah, Chris is right.  A form with no form elements
would not get caught.  What kind of weird situations are
you trying to protect against, anyway, Jerry?


	I'm not sure if this would help, but if you want
to kill all the incoming user params, I think you could
un-set $_REQUEST, $_GET, $_POST, and all those to NULL.
Of course, if you have register_globals ON, you'd have
to unset all your globals individualy.

	We could probably suggest better ideas if you
would explain what your security issues are.


Best, George.

Hi,

New guy here.  This may help.  I use this too, so if you can point out any
weaknesses, please let me know.

<?php
$host = "www.yoururl.com";
if (!isset($HTTP_REFERRER) || ($HTTP_HOST != $host)) {
    # access denied message
}
?>

You may have to use the long-hand variable call.  Anyway, it basically say
that to load this page the request must come from another page on the same
host.  This way people cannot create form on their site and link to your
pages, nor can they type in the address directly.

Any comment is appreciated.

Thanks,

Pinyo

I know this does not make much sense when you don't know what the project
is.  Unfortunately I can not reveal any details at this point. This is a
client's project.  The significant fact is that for a specific reason the
users will want to link to the some scripts by submitting a form instead of
clicking on an <a href> link.  I know there is no difference on the back end
whether the request came from a form or a <a href> link, but it's not really
about the back end. The request needs to come from an <a href> link, period.
I know it sounds weird but trust me there is a very good reason for that.

None of these would apply. I forgot to mention that the links will be placed
on third party sites (or rather extranet sites) by other webmasters. In
addition to checking the referer header against a database containing
qualified referer URL's, I also need to make sure that they are not linking
from a form. Again, sounds weird but you need to trust me.

This usually applies to all my other projects but this one is really
different.

ok - dunno what I'm talking about, but could you possible append some sort
of hash value to the href - which could only be generated by your script and
not any third party?  Make the key available only to the valid websites in
order for them to generate it - and don't accept anything that does have a
submit.

The links would be placed on other websites, but only ones who register, so
I do check the Referer header against a list of authorized URL's.  Even
though the Referer can not be trusted (that's the weakness I'd like to point
out) I'm using it as one layer of security (in addition to other stuff).
However I also need to make sure that the links at those sites are <a href>
links and not HTML forms sending a GET request to my scripts. I usually
would not matter whether it's a link or a form but in this case it does.

Thanks for your help,
Jerry

Seriously, you're going to need to elaborate here for us to help you. Why would
it matter if these other sites have a button instead of a link? Would it also
matter to you if they used an image as a link instead of text? I do not
understand the security concern you speak of.

I actually do a couple of things that let me reliably determine whether the
request is authorized. The problem however is that there is a good reason
why the authorized webmasters would want to replace the links with forms
even if they are told not to.  Unless there is a way to check whether they
use a link or a form they will get away with "breaking the rule" and will
keep doing it.  The only option I have left is to build a bot that would
check each authorized URL for existence of the required <a href> link. Since
most of those sites are extranet sites protected by different types user
authentication I'll have to use a cURL based bot for cookie/session support.
I'll have to require the webmasters to provide username/password for the bot
to use when checking their site.
This is much more work than I expected.

Please explain this rule they would be breaking. We need to better understand

Chris,

I wish I could do that. But unfortunately  I can't.  I'm afraid I'm already
in breach of my contract by discussing technical details of the project
here.


>Why would it matter if these other sites have a button instead of a link?

It does not matter on the back end part of the system, but it does in
general, trust me. I can't tell you more.  I just wish there was a way to
detect it on the back end.

>Would it also matter to you if they used an image as a link instead of

No, both are ok, text or image.

>I do not understand the security concern you speak of.

That's not really important.  I'm stuck with one specific thing: the ability
to determine whether the request came from an <a href> link or a form.

Well, maybe this will help. I created the following test page, http.php:

<p><a href="./http.php">Link</a></p>
<form action="./http.php" method="get">
<input type="submit">
</form>

When I click the link, my Web browser sends this:

Of course, I can also telnet directly to the Web server and type the request
in, so that's three different ways to generate the exact same request.

As my example shows, this is really impossible. You cannot detect it based on
the request itself, so you're going to have to think outside of the box. Since
it is the authors of the Web sites you are worried about, perhaps the only
viable solution is for you to check up on them with an automated script of some
type, much like you were describing.

Sorry I can't help more. I must admit that I am really curious why it could
possibly matter. :-)

I knew that the request seems identical in both cases. That's why I came
here for suggestions. Perhaps when I get some sleep I'll start thinking out
of the box :)  I did not get any sleep in 41 hours.  I really appreciate
your effort in trying to help me.  I think I'll go with the web bot solution
for now.

I wish a could tell you what it's all about.  I should be able to reveal
more when the project is finished.

I agree with both Chris and Jerry... you should log
all the referring URLs and build a nice interface to
list them all.  Then either a human can manually
check them all periodically, or, yes, you could try
to write some smart page-sniffer to parse for
yourUrl as a FORM action.

	It sounds like your company needs to track your
remote webmasters for more reasons than one... so
writing a script that sniffs their pages might actually
be a good investment...(?)

Not having done this myself this is only from memory:

Well, if you end up going the parse a page for a link route, couldn't
you just parse the referrer for that link?  I mean grabbing a page and
using RegEx to find a link takes a second, tops.  So you parse the page,
find the link you're looking for and then allow the script to continue.

I suppose that would require a login on some sites.. Dunno - hard to say
without more specifics.

Good header example, btw Chris.  I was wondering if here would be a
difference in the headers.

Since
it is the authors of the Web sites you are worried about, perhaps the
only
viable solution is for you to check up on them with an automated script
of some
type, much like you were describing.

Sorry I can't help more. I must admit that I am really curious why it
could
possibly matter. :-)

Since you asked... :-)

There are many ways to defeat this, and here is an example. Assume your above
script is named foo.php and outputs "access granted" immediately after your
conditional statement:

[chris at alpha]~> telnet www.yoururl.com 80
Trying 12.34.56.78...
Connected to www.yoururl.com (12.34.56.78).
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /foo.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.yoururl.com
Referer: http://www.youonlycheckifthisisset.org/


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2003 14:46:11 GMT
Server: Apache
Content-Type: text/html
Content-length: 14

access granted

Connection closed by foreign host.
[chris at alpha]~>

Basically, those variables that start with HTTP are just the headers sent by
the client, so if you trust those for any sort of security, it's like a teacher
asking the students to grade their own papers. It will work fine on honest
people, but those aren't the ones to be concerned with.

Hope that helps.

Well, I'm not sure what you're wanting to do exactly. In general, I try to
focus most of my creative thinking on two things:

1. Storing everything that isn't necessary for client identification on the
server (such as in a session) and trusting nothing from the client.
2. Making it very difficult for someone to impersonate another user.

If you tell me your primary concern(s), I might be able to offer some
suggestions.

This is a fairly vague problem, so I'll give my suggestion to what I 
think you are trying to do.

On each non-local website do something similar to this:

<script type="text/javascript" 
src="http://example.com/offsite/link_creator.js">
<a href="#" onClick="return linkCreate();">Click Me</a>

(where example.com is your server)

On your server you would have link_creator.js be a PHP script that 
creates dynamic Javascript. This allows you to grab information such as 
the referrer, and the remote IP address, and any other information you 
could need. You could even make the JavaScript source append a get 
variable for that site like link_creator.js?site=www.remotesite.com

The PHP would create a one time use hash, depending on if
all of your security requirements have been met which then is inserted
into the temporary table along with the remote IP, referrer etc.

The dynamic JavaScript would then include a function (linkCreate) which 
just changes the browser's location to the link you have created.

This would cause some heavy traffic load, especially if all of the 
remote sites get a lot of traffic. This would allow you to make 
one-time-use hashes that would be required for a successful page load on 
your server.  Once the unique hash has been found in the query string, 
you just expire it on the database.

Not sure if that would help, but it may be relevant.

It is not possible, in an absolute sense.  Regardless of what HTTP, client
side, javascript or PHP tricks you can think of, it's forgable.  How can a
web server know I'm connecting via telnet, let alone cURL, or anything else? 
You'll need to establish a baseline security measure (read: what's good
enough) and then make an implementation.  

I'm just jumping in on this thread, so forgive me if this was covered, but
you may be able to do a callback method.  You'd could connect back to the
requester, asking for the referring page.  Could this be forged?  Sure, but
it may offer some level obscurity, in addition to SSL options (since it's
harder to forge SSL, nix cURL).

Good luck,

H

Could you show me an example of how to use TO_LOB or LOB within a SQL
statement? And is it possible to write this w/o having to write a stored
procedure or function?

A sketch of the SQL statement I want is below (note "templateBody" is the
renaming of t.BODY, the LONG column datatype):

SELECT t.ID, t.TITLE, tp.PATHNAME
FROM vigaudi.template t, vigaudi.template_path tp, vigaudi.vgn_ci ci 
WHERE t.ID = tp.ID 
AND TO_CHAR(t.ID) = ci.RECORDID 
AND ci.PROJECT IN ('/pr/64', '/pr/79', '/pr/7b', '/pr/7c', '/pr/7e',
'/pr/80', '/pr/81', '/pr/82', '/pr/83', '/pr/84', '/pr/85', '/pr/8c',
'/pr/90', '/pr/93', '/pr/97', '/pr/99', '/pr/9a', '/pr/9b', '/pr/9e',
'/pr/9f', '/pr/a0', '/pr/a3', '/pr/a4', '/pr/a5', '/pr/63') 
--AND templateBody like '%Constants %' OR templateBody like '%TypeConstants
%'

Max,
This is exactly what I came up with while eating my oatmeal this morning :)
However one thing still concerns me:

<input type="button" onClick="return linkCreate();">

BTW, what's the difference between ="return linkCreate()" and
="linkCreate()"  ?

If I recall correctly, you would need to return false so it doesn't
actually continue with the current operation. For instance if you did it
in an onSubmit, returning false would keep the form from submitting
(this is quite useful for form validation).

Just keep in mind that this is all just allusion. If someone really
wants to use a form to do this, they could pull it off with some simple
scripts and a small amount of time. If the security of this application
isn't really mission critical this solution should suffice though.

I've got a strange situation. I'm working on a php shell script that
connects to LDAP and Oracle, and transfers data. This works fine
from the command line, but, when put into crontab, the LDAP connect
fails. What am I missing? I've gone through all the combos I can

are you making sure you it's using the same binary as the one you are
using from the command line. and it's in the user's path etc?
maybe you are using the cli binary as opposed to the cgi binary?

I always use explicit paths in cron. I cut-n-paste the command part
from crontab to the commandline, and it runs. I'm confused.

Does your script make relative (vs absolute) references to files?
There is a possibility that when you're testing, there are directories
included in your PATH, that aren't when cron runs.

Sometimes you have to do dirty scripting stuff to get things working 
properly.
For example, the old RealServer daemon use to require starting from the
"/usr/local/realserver" directory and then running "bin/rmserver"
so I had to create something silly like "cd /usr/local/realserver; 
bin/rmserver"

I need to set up a "Construction Web Cam" (photo, not streaming) where I work. The main server is outside the firewall but the computer that the camera will be attached to is inside the firewall and you can not FTP through it nor will the network admin. turn on the FTP ability. I am doubtful that he can map a drive or folder to the main web server (apache on a win 2k advanced server). He states that I must use HTTP protocol but apache is not configured with web DAV and I wouldn't know how to recompile if I needed/had to.

Does anyone know of something(s) that would/could work? 

I also need the ability to have some program (PHP?) to automatically take the resulting pictures and generate a page with either thumbnails or links to the photos generated.

I'm looking for a free or next to free solution that will work on a windows platform.

Thank You,

Jessica

What kind of camera do you plan to use?  If it is an IP camera (as in 
network addressable, embedded OS, web server onboard), an http 
request can be sent to the camera that returns a still image.  I 
contract for a company on Long Island that does this type of work.

If it is a USB camera, search for webcamXP -- it is a pretty decent ap 
and I think the registered version does what you need.  It's Windows 
only and is cheap (~$35 last time I checked).

I FTP to the server but my production computer is outside the firewall (as is the web server) so that's not the problem. The computer that the web cam will be connected to is behind the firewall and can not FTP to the server.

It's surprising because it's completely unexpected (to us)...
but I could probably bet you there are some non-technical managers
out there that might have had this question come across their minds,
but were either not curious enough to ask or didn't want to suffer
embarrassment due to ignorance.

Due to the enormous amount of information available out there, some
folks make a point to be ignorant of certain things to keep
their lives as simple as possible; for example, One time I asked
"When is Labor Day?" to a co-worker and he was totally floored
and dumbfounded by my question.  Knowing what day that particular
holiday landed on wasn't important, until the that day when I asked.

In this case, since the webcam is behind the firewall, but you are 
allowed http requests, you can simple access the image directly with
<img scr="http://[ip of cam server]/image.jpg]" etc etc etc..>

I have a  small java applet that refreshes periodically so if you are 
overwriting the image, the image on your webpage will refresh.  If 
that is what you need, I can send it to you offlist.

Some webcam programs will allow you to email the picture to someone.  
You might be able to use such a program to email the picture to your 
production computer from the computer with the web cam and then have a 
script upload the attachments to the server.  I can think of a few ways 
to do it if the webcam computer and your production machines were Macs, 
but I'm not certain of what is available on Windows to do this.

Subject: Setting directory permissions
Message-ID: <31ba4333ef.333ef31ba4@optonline.net>

I'm sure this is an easy one but...since I'm still learning PHP...I'm scratching my poor bald head. ;)

Here's a code snippet:

//create new directory with the id name if it doesn't exist, chmod to 777
if(!is_dir($id)) {
    $root = getenv('DOCUMENT_ROOT');
    $id = $root . '/pic_test/' . $id;
    mkdir($id,0777);
}

The problem is...this only works if I chmod the subdirectory "pic_test" to 777 using my FTP application. However, I want to quickly change the permissions via PHP code, upload some pictures with my form, then change the permissions back to 755.

Thoughts/comments greatly appreciated.

Jeff

Jeff,

The value you pass into mkdir() is always AND'd with the current
umask. To be certain that the dir's permissions are set to exactly
what you pass, first clear the umask, as in:

if(!is_dir($id)) {
    $root = getenv('DOCUMENT_ROOT');
    $id = $root . '/pic_test/' . $id;
    $old_umask = umask(0000);
    mkdir($id,0777);
    umask($old_umask);
}

You could just set umask to 0000 at the top of your script, but
make sure you understand the full ramifications of doing that.

I haven't had much experience with shareware/freeware implementions but
phpShop springs to mind.  As for commercial products, I've heard good things

How about your environment?  For instance, with Oracle, you need the
ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_BASE environment variables set, and if I recommend
correctly, LDAP needs similar things.

Also, as mentioned, check user permissions if running under different
UIDs/GIDs

Pat,

Thanks for the help. Unfortunately I didn't have any luck with this. I wonder if it has to do with the permissions that PHP is running under, that is, PHP itself does not have the permission needed to create the directory. (Am I making sense or am I confusing apples and oranges?)

Note that the is_dir($id) call isn't nessecarily checking the dir you think
it is.

Assuming you're running PHP as an Apache module, you'll be limited to the
user priveleges of Apache itself.  While in most cases this is good, for
writing to the filesystem things can get hairy.

For one, you won't be able to change the permissions of a directory/file you
don't own (read: apache's running user doesn't own).  So, trying to change
the permissions from less-restrictive to more-restrictive 'quickly' is a moot
point, since if a malicious page is written, he'd just change the perms if
desired anyway.

It's a catch-22 (as it should be) and is only solvable by having proper
ownership (or improper ownership, depending on your viewpoint), suEXEC
(achtung!) or a daemon to handle file operations.

HTH,

You might want to try osCommerce, which is very easy

If you're looking for a picture gallery option, then http://gallery.sf.net is
probably your best bet.  It requires Apache writable directories and
safe_mode=off (PSaw may be able to expand on this, since he implmented it for
NYPHP.org).  This isn't inherently insecure, but a shared environment and a
clever malicious user, may be food for thought.

> Should I upload them (the pics) into a database as blobs?

This certainly is the 'cleanest' option; but performance could be a
consideration, especially for large images.

Having apache writable directories isn't always a bad thing, but if you end
up writing the code yourself, just be very careful with paths and such.

Well its basically saying that you have a header that includes the total

one is added using the same form (same page) ... so if you say:

newVacancy.php (includes header.php) - 0 vacancies
-enter new data-

-click to new page-
newPage.php (includes header.php) - 1 vacancies

Is there something I could put into newVacancy.php to reflect the changes?

Well, I would guess that newVacancy has a form processor in it that
basically takes the submitted data and inserts it into the db (upon
submission).  If you place the insert query  before the header include
on NewVacancy.php, the count query SHOULD reflect the new sum.  

Are you doing it in this order, and not seeing the updated vacancy
count?

Sorry, I saw your question and your lack of luck with someone's code - I
didn't read the rest of the posts just because I'm in a rush right now, but
I figured I'd give you the code I used when I needed to make a directory
that I could upload to.

function new_projectdir($project_name)
{
 $old_mask = umask();
 umask(0000);
 chdir('/directory/whatever/');
 mkdir($project_name, 0770);
 umask($old_mask);
 return 1;
}

Jeff-- a couple people have suggested solutions to this that involve 
giving the Apache user write-permission on the directory, which is 
traditionally the way to handle uploaded files.

I'd like to point out that there is another, and I believe better way, 
but it requires you to recompile PHP with the FTP functions enabled. 
After uploading the file, you FTP it to the directory where you want it 
to go. This has the added benefit of making the files owned by you 
instead of by nobody, meaning you can edit or delete them later.

If this is something you want to try, check out Fiatlux: 
http://fiatlux.chxo.com
It uses this method to enable web users to create directories and upload 
files that can also be admin'd via FTP.

hi there.

i'm just wondering if there is a problem with setting a large session 
variable, like performance-wise?  i've been using session variables 
for years, but i always, for some reason, have kept them to just 
storing small stuff, rather than, like, a gigantic associative array 
representing search results or something.

anyone have any rules of thumb here?

just sort of fishing for opinions.

if i'm understanding you correctly, this probably has nothing to do 
with PHP; are you still seeing this behavior if you turn off caching 
in your browser?

you can put this in the <head> of your document:

<META HTTP-EQUIV="Pragma" CONTENT="no-cache">

i know it's not 100% bulletproof, but it's a start.  search for that 
on google.com, and you'll uncover a hornet's nest of anti-caching 
strategies.

If you're using the default session handler, it serializes the session data
(akin to serialize()) and then stores it on disk.  Aside from the
serialize(), sessions are about as fast as you can get, concerning data
storage; baring storing everything in memory.  If you were to write your own
session handler if performance really became an issue.

I don't know exactly what 'gigantic' means, but don't forget about stale
sessions.  If the garbage isn't collected, or you're getting heavy traffic,
you could run into some space and disk contention issues.

Bradley,

Thanks so the suggestion. The problem is that I get a "Permission Denied" error on the "mkdir" command. Is there something I'm overlooking?

Show us the code you're using...
Its obviously a permissions issue.. perhaps its the user that apache is
running under?

You might need to have a shell, if you do -- try chowning the directory that
you're creating the directory in so that you have permissions...

Sorry for the late reply, I just got back from vacation.

I've been involved in a fair amount of search engine related projects and
have dealt with all of what you're talking about.

I have no idea what size of data they are talking about, how much traffic
you have to support and what their budget is,
but any searching beyond exact pattern matching requires strict client
expectation management.
You can get products that will do anything you'd ever want for 5 digit
figures, but I'm guessing that's beyond their budget.

Depending on their budget and how important it really is to them (broken
down by specific features) and how much work they're willing to do on their
side, I could give you some more advice.

For just the spell checking, using pspell (as Sterling suggested) could fit
the bill.

Message-ID: <BAY7-DAV45R0rmTIVvL0000239f@hotmail.com>

Hey guys and girls,

Got a simple yet complicated question. here
I have to launch 4 surveys, which any user on a mailing list can access only once per survey.
survey1 - survey2 - survey3 - survey4
The amount of time these surveys will be online is two months.
So if the user has filled out survey1 he can only go to 2,3 or 4 ... etc.
The mailing will direct the user to one of the 4, per mailing list.

Now the surveys are done ... wrote the code ... did the Oracle thingy, etc. 
But what would be the best way to make sure that the users will only enter one of each survey's?
I know the cookie issue is not 100% so I was looking into alternatives, but if it is gonna  be cookies ...
well ... so be it . These surveys are going to get hit hard since the mailing lists contain around 3 
million users per survey/mailing. And these surveys are not cached so I can't put to much stress on the
boxes.

If anyone has any ideas ... or has done this in the past and was fairly successful. Let me know.
And ... if anyone has any code snippets that can do the job, please let me know ... or maybe post it,
since it is one of those rush jobs (what's new), that marketing wants in day. 

Arno ....

Thx in advanced.

Hans, 

We really need a seconday NYPHP location in the CT region, since I can never make any of the meetings

Well, if it's everyone on a mailing list, then each person should have
their own email address, so they should be able to enter their email
address as part of the survey (or as a pre-login) and you could track it
like so.  Possible?

Yeah Mark,

That thought crossed my mind, marketing is using a third party company to
these mailings, and they can't insert even a normal id as reference. So I'm
basically working with a non-referrer and no data. And yes ... I told the 
marketing department that we might as well do these mailings from within the
company since that would make my life easier. But ... well ... we all know
how these people think. (do they actually think?)

I wrote this email last night and I'm starting to write a simple cookie
procedure and ad this to the submit button of the surveys. (Just in case
nobody can help me ... hehe)

Made a spelling booboo last night.

A friend of mine wants to know the answer to this, and since my Apache
setup on Win2K doesn't involve virtual host domains, I couldn't help him. 
Anyone out there might know?

Thanx

quick question about the apache on win2K :
I can't access the cgi-bin folder...

here's the setup:

d:\\www\\apache\\apache2\\htdocs\\downtown\\cgi-bin (for the client)
d:\\www\\apache\\apache2\\cgi-bin

virtual host runs into the downtown-folder. both cgi-bin folders have
.htaccess in it, but when i open the browser i get he message:

http://virtualhost/cgi-bin/
forbidden, you don't have permission to access /cgi-bin/ on this server

<= i assume that that's why I can't run the scripts either...

any suggestions ???

You need to add ScriptAlias to the httpd.conf and some directory 
parameters..

Do a search in your existing httpd.conf file for ScriptAlias. I have 
copied config info from my httpd.conf, I am running 1.3.27 version of 
apache.

>

I am just guessing, but the virtual host should look something like.. 
Just add the ScriptAlias info into the virtual host tags

<VirtualHost downtown.com>
DocumentRoot "d:/www/apache/apache2/htdocs/downtown"
ServerName "downtown.com"


     # ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server 
scripts.
     # ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
     # documents in the realname directory are treated as applications 
and
     # run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to 
the client.
     # The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias directives 
as to
     # Alias.
     #
     ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ 
"d:/www/apache/apache2/htdocs/downtown/cgi-bin"

     # CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
     #
     <Directory "d:/www/apache/apache2/htdocs/downtown/cgi-bin">
         AllowOverride None
         Options None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
     </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

> d:\\www\\apache\\apache2\\cgi-bin

This would be the default server config info. If you did not added the 
ScriptAlias Directive to the VirtualHost, any 
http://servername/cgi-bin/ will resolve to the default server config.

     # ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server 
scripts.
     # ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
     # documents in the realname directory are treated as applications 
and
     # run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to 
the client.
     # The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias directives 
as to
     # Alias.
     #
     ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "d:/www/apache/apache2/cgi-bin"

     # CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
     #
     <Directory "d:/www/apache/apache2/cgi-bin">
         AllowOverride None
         Options None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
     </Directory>

note the forward slashes..

Subject: PHP Storing Query
Message-ID: <000801c30a6d$c45c1d30$46f9943f@michaelk>

Hello;

I am adding a web (using php) interface to an existing MS Access database application.  Currently, databse is stored on a network drive and 10+ users query/update records daily.  Because some people cannot handle change very well (never mind a computer related change)  I would like to keep the existence database application and slowly migrate the users over to the web.

My problem is, the application was developed very poorly.  I need to know if I can (and how to) create a query online and save that query (sql statement) in the access database as a query itself.

thanks,

Mike,

Not sure if you got a response to this (I'm on vacation using a crummy dial-up connection so it's hard for me to check email) but the short answer to your question is you should be able to store the query in the Access database. However, I'm not sure if you can do it using PHP (I assume if you're asking the question here you are using PHP) so you may have to use ASP (Active Server Pages). I would be surprised if PHP's ODBC support allows you to create a query and store it in the MS Access database.

I've used ASP against an MS Access database but have not explored the capabilities of writing queries to the MDB file. 

Jeff
P.S. If you did a Google search concerning this particular problem, most of the code you'll find...though it is likely to refer to directly to MS Access...you can port it over to ASP with only a few modifications.

I'm not sure what you are are trying to do with storing  queries in a
database, but I think you mean storing query strings into a table.

If your queries are simple without any conditions, then this is a
strightforward matter of merely storing the text of the query as a string
value in an appropriate table structure. a query like "select * from foo"
should be easy to handle.

Most likely though, you have conditions and have queries that use a
condition, i.e., "select * from foo where bar=$bar" The question is whether
or not you want to store the query string before or after evaluating the
value of $bar.  It should be doable either way.

The issues you will face if this along the lines of what you want to do is
properly escaping the data to allow Access to accept your data and using the
PHP eval() function to allow embedded variables returned in a string from
the database to be interpreted as variables and not merely part of a string.

Again, I am not sure what you hope to gain by doing this, as you may find
better answers if you present your need or issue rather than asking for help
with a solution.

I use both ASP and PHP, and for me PHP is so much more capable (especially
under a *nix), I would stick with PHP and perhaps consider migrating your
data to a better DB like mysql or Postgres. Postgres supports views which
may be the db function you are trying to emulate?

Hope this helps.

Mike

Message-ID: <18D7B8CAA5284F478470828806DB124603789DB5@psle01.xchg.pwj.com>

Hi everyone,
 
I'm having trouble running a script from the command line on WINNT4.0 - The
script runs fine via HTTP requests, but when I try to execute the same
script via the command line, a MSSQL connection fails. There is also an ODBC
connection to an Access DB that seems to connect fine, but for some reason
the MSSQL connection will not happen.
 
I thought about permissions, but I don't see what the difference would be
since the script partially executes. The script passes the SQL
username/password to the DB server, so I can't see that being it either.
Anybody have any ideas?
 
Thanks.

When you run from the command line, there are a few things that might be
different:

1. Different user. I know very little about Windows, but I think it might only
have the root user, so this might not be an issue for you.
2. Different environment. Even if you're executing the script as the same user,
your environment may be different. For example, many databases (Oracle, for
example) have environment variables that indicate where the client libraries
reside.

Hope that gives you some ideas. Someone more familiar with Windows can probably
help you more.

Chris

I thought he wanted to store the query as a query (as opposed to just storing the SQL in a table). I've probably got too much MS Access on the brain. ;)

know where I can find more information about that "Visitation" data

During the talk Sterling Hughes mentioned that there were 
algorithms/examples/more detail online about defining the left & right 
values, and redefining them when inserting/deleting a node. That's what 
I'm interested in...

Hmm.  Well, having attended the talk (although, I must admit I didn't
pay very much attention), I believe what Sterling Hughes said was that
there is PEAR's Tree class, available online at http://pear.php.net/. 
The Tree class will manage visitation for you.

Good morning,

My apologies for the mailing list troubles of late.  While I'm anxious to get
the current system offline and upgraded, I've hacked in some temporary
precautions to prevent the mail loops we've seen.  Hopefully, this will catch
illconfigured vacation responders, email clients, and forwarders.  However,
if you should notice any future loops, contact me ASAP at zaunere at yahoo.com
or hans at nyu.edu

Lastly, all mail to both the Talk and Dev mailing lists within the last 24
hours has been lost.  If you had sent a lengthy message, let me know and I
can probably dig it up; but please do repost your messages.  I'll also be
standing by to monitor potential mail loops.

Best regards,

Just thought Id pass that URL along to anyone that wasn't subscribed to the
newsletter ...

Some new features include:

* Subqueries:
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a=(SELECT t2.b FROM t2);
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (1,2,3) IN (SELECT a,b,c FROM t2);
* Derived tables: SELECT t1.a FROM t1, (SELECT * FROM t2) t3 WHERE
t1.a=t3.a;
* `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ...' syntax. This allows you to
`UPDATE' an existing row if the insert would cause a duplicate value in a
`PRIMARY' or `UNIQUE' key. (`REPLACE' allows you to overwrite an existing
row, which is something entirely different. See
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/INSERT.html

Nice.

I just upgraded to 4 from 3.22.32 last night/this morning (yea, it's 
been a while since
I touched the thing). Converted all tables from iasm to myisam. The new 
version
"feels" a bit slower (haven't done any benchmarks yet), but disabling 
innodb support
freed up some extra RAM, which seemed to help a little.

I do have to admit though, the machine is a meager Cobalt celeron 300mhz 
with 96Megs of RAM
and it is wacked with a lot of daily traffic (currently hosting parts of 
the Mozilla project,
RealServer, about 150+ other websites, and a whole gaggle of other services)

The subqueries feature is something I'll definitely look forward to using.

Not me, but -- the certifications look like an intriguing idea. I see from
browsing http://www.mysql.com/training/ that they want good money for
those courses. I wonder how one goes about training through just
self-study. In the Microsoft and Java worlds there are loads of test-prep
books, but this is of course a whole new thing.

Hello by the way. I'm new to NYPHP.  I work in downtown NYC at the federal
court as a Spanish interpreter; I use AMP for our office's needs, and
dabble on the side in (both paid and volunteer) web development and
maintenance. I discovered NYPHP at the PHP conference last week. Did that
rock or what?

Im trying to attempt something simple and already have a proto in Java for

like to know if it's possible to create a simple app that could be cron'd to
do the same thing ... Id like to build some analysis tools around it that's
why ...

Hi Jon,

I guess you would be using the PHP Sockets to send messages to the DHCP
server.

Yeah, although perhaps not very nicely.  It escapes me exactly what layer
DHCP operates at (it must be frame/link layer right?).  If this is the case,
then you'll have problems; PHP doesn't like binary, and it doesn't like raw
sockets; although, you could use libnet
(http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/) maybe.  If all you need are TCP or UDP
packets, then you're golden; just use the socket extension, which while
called experimental, has worked well enough for me.

Subject: dl() and extension directive in php.ini
Message-ID: <20030430204217.58047.qmail@web12803.mail.yahoo.com>


Hi,

I'm hearing some conflicting reports and I'd like to see other's thoughts
before I have to dig, dig, dig.

Loading an external module using dl() at runtime obviously loads the module
per request (ie, performance hit).

On the other hand, which I believe is the recommended method anyway, is using
the extension= directive in php.ini.  While this is still a dynamic module
load, it should only happen once; for instance when the Apache process
spawns.

While reading some Zend API stuff I began to doubt this, so I'm interested in
any confirmations either way.

Thanks,

H

Subject: Setting up PHP5 under Windows
Message-ID: <3EB06AC4.5010602@gadhra.com>

Hey all,

I've got some real rough instructions for setting up PHP 5 for testing on Windows (eek!) at:
http://www.vespatech.com/papers/php5.php

I'm coming from a Linux-y background regarding AMP, so I'm not sure if I got all (any?) of the details right on the installation; I could use any feedback ya'll might have.  I'm not rolling this to anyone special, but I don't want some poor sap googling to this page and being lead into the mouth of catastrophe.

Also, please excuse the design.  I'll come back to it when I'm done with content.
