I've been dealing with Eclipse for several years now (I was working at IBM when they were creating it, so I think that gives me a little affinity towards it).  I like the outline view of my class for navigating it, the task list for grouping my &quot;TODO&quot; notes, quick custom code templates, the tooltips with function definitions, etc.  But I've grown to not be able to live without the &quot;Open Declaration&quot; feature which lets me highlight a method or class name, hit F3, and get right to that file.  With a large project, that has been a huge time saver.  I think NetBeans has something similar?  I remember downloading NetBeans and being a little turned off by it... but I can't remember why now.

Eclipse caps its memory usage and if it's not large enough, it spends a lot of time figuring out how to clear heap space.  I edited my eclipse.ini file and set 
-Xmx1024m
to let it have up to 1GB of memory if it needs it.  That seems to be enough.

I also stopped using any source control integration.  Subversive would just bring my machine to a halt continually.  I wish it worked well, but I'm handy enough with svn on the command line to not really need it.

I also split my large project into several small projects in Eclipse that reference each other.  This has seemed to help with keeping the &quot;building workspace&quot; time to a minimum.  It also lets me keep libraries I don't use much closed.  I found that certain 3rd party libraries with tons of files -- and especially yui from Yahoo -- would kill performance in Eclipse if I kept it as part of my project.

It seems to me that Eclipse PDT is a beast that needs to be kept at bay continually, but is really powerful if tuned to a tolerable level.
