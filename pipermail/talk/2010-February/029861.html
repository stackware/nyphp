<PRE>As silly as the buzzwords are and we can laugh about them, it's a  
short-cut to people doing evaluations for a field they know very  
little about. We all do this. I know nothing about blenders, so I look  
in Consumer Reports and gather buzzwords on what to look for. I don't  
have the time or desire to become a food appliance design engineer  
just to select a blender for consumer use, even though I want a good  
one.

This just shows how much you have to talk with the perspective clients  
to understand what's important to them. I'm not saying they always  
know what's best, but being able to successfully figure out what's  
important to them can be key. What's important to them might be  
considered lame to the proposal writer, but it's about getting the work.

</I>&gt;<i> Over the winter break in Decemember, a lot of NYPHP's posted various  
</I>&gt;<i> amusing

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of which was MongoDB for DBA's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, another of which[or I just ended up seeing it as a related

</I>&gt;<i> was about &quot;How to talk about Web 2.0 like you know what your talking
</I>&gt;<i> about&quot;..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically a presentation on keywords to throw into conversations to  
</I>&gt;<i> act like
</I>&gt;<i> you know stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was talking to a friend the other day and she mentioned how she  
</I>&gt;<i> got so
</I>&gt;<i> sick of the word &quot;dynamic&quot; 5-6 years ago since she had to use it in  
</I>&gt;<i> every

</I>&gt;<i> show
</I>&gt;<i> her this video because it was so funny.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But now I can't find it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, NYPHP's, come to my rescue and give me a laugh.  I really need
