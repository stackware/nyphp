<PRE>Have you tried aptana? It was built for ror, but they took over pydev
and have a php plugin as well.  I just started using it and its pretty
decent (not sure about the code folding).

&gt;<i> Too many little consoles..  :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which is the main item which has put me off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Written in Java and needing to know Java to do a lot of extending of
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse[though with PDT going to a markup language for rules, I might be
</I>&gt;<i> able to do quite a bit there]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oddities with network connections:  I went through half a dozen install
</I>&gt;<i> processes, and each one broke irrepairably at some point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Too many versions: which one to use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PHP code folding inadequacies:  just doesn't fold everything the other IDE's
</I>&gt;<i> I've used can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Source Class browsing failures:  I've yet to see a function like Ultraedit
</I>&gt;<i> where an entire project of files is kept up to date for the class/function
</I>&gt;<i> browsers.  OTOH you can emulate all this functionality if you document your
</I>&gt;<i> code as it will pick up documentation in standard formats.  So here the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;downside&quot; is a matter of getting really good at commenting code that should
</I>&gt;<i> be commented anyway!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My setup:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I ended up with the all in one PDT installer. Then I added in the Bzr
</I>&gt;<i> plugins for source code repositories.  Then I REMOVED Mylin and installed
</I>&gt;<i> the latest version of Mylin....
</I>&gt;<i> Then I installed the Mylin/Eclipse Redmine plugin[and installed the server
</I>&gt;<i> side 2.6 plugin on my server].  Finally, the one item that caused weird
</I>&gt;<i> problems when I installed originally, I loaded the RSE plugins[Remote Server
</I>&gt;<i> Environment].  Note: the local one caused me to be unable to open local PHP
</I>&gt;<i> files, so the 3rd time around I specifically excluded that one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I added my Redmine server to the task servers[small nit here: under the
</I>&gt;<i> current setup, I cannot get a list of /all/ issues.  I have to add project
</I>&gt;<i> by project, and sub project by sub project.  Gotta find out why and fix
</I>&gt;<i> that]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, outside the &quot;project&quot; concept as I was debugging code that was offsite,
</I>&gt;<i> then for the Remote Servers I added my FTP and SFTP servers and was able to
</I>&gt;<i> browse those repositories online and open the files directly.  [Note: small
</I>&gt;<i> nit here, a LOT of the tools I wanted are kind of hidden.  I had to keep
</I>&gt;<i> going to Window-&gt;ShowView-&gt;Other to get a long list of windows to find a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of these things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, so with all this setup, I had 3 features to change.  So I opened the
</I>&gt;<i> first task in my project in eclipse, checked the spec, hit activate, and
</I>&gt;<i> then hunted around for the files on the server.  Finally found the oddball
</I>&gt;<i> layout and located the 2 PHP files that needed minor changes to.  Updated
</I>&gt;<i> and tested them.  Then when I was done, I went back to the task and used the
</I>&gt;<i> feature I am now in love with: there will be a tab to &quot;Add Context&quot;.....
</I>&gt;<i> click on that and you have a list of all open files[or is it files you have
</I>&gt;<i> opened?]..   Clicked save and I believe it generates an XML file of all the
</I>&gt;<i> file paths/files and zips them up, then it gets attached to the issue.  Next
</I>&gt;<i> I close the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So NEXT time I have to make a small change, I can go back to this issue and
</I>&gt;<i> open the context from Eclipse and it will automatically open the files from
</I>&gt;<i> the FTP server for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second feature, again changed 2 files.  This time I had to dig through a
</I>&gt;<i> dozen files to find the area to change and had left them open.  As an
</I>&gt;<i> experiment, I went to add context and sure enough, lots of stuff I did not
</I>&gt;<i> change was there.  But I could right click and remove items from the context
</I>&gt;<i> that were not relevant, and then save them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Soo... that one feature has me sold.  It was quick and easy and I will live
</I>&gt;<i> with all the other little annoyances for now to be able to easily record
</I>&gt;<i> which files were changed directly into my project management tool AND be
</I>&gt;<i> able to open them later[it's easy to add changed files by adding an issue
</I>&gt;<i> keyword to the files and checking into version control - Bazaar can check
</I>&gt;<i> files for keywords in the commits and files and update the issue id number
</I>&gt;<i> as needed - but that is one way communication, wheras this two way
</I>&gt;<i> communication is great!]
</I>&gt;<i>
