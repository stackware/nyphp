<PRE>As I was reading, I was thinking that would be my approach.
 
I'm not seeing anything ugly about it.  Records being processed should have
a status as such.
 
You might have some additional logic, that picks up records in the event one
of the processes fail for some reason.   Sever goes down or some one
accidently kills the process, etc.
 
We'll see what the other folks think.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Best way to accomplish this task


Hello Everyone,
 
I'm designing a system that will work on a schedule. Users will submit data
for processing into the database and then, every minute, a PHP script will
pass through the db looking for unprocessed rows (marked pending) and
process them.
 
The problem is, I may eventually have a few million records to process at a
time. Each record could take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to
perform the required operations on. My concern is making sure that the
script, on the next scheduled pass, doesn't grab the records currently being
processed and start processing them again.
 
Right now, I'm thinking of accomplishing this by updating a 'status' field
in the database. So unprocessed records would have a status of 'pending',
records being processed would have a status of 'processing' and completly
processed record will have a status of 'complete'.
 
For some reason, I see this as ugly but that's the only way I can think of
making sure that records aren't duplicatly processed. So when I select
records to process, I'm ONLY selecting one's with the status of 'pending'
which means they are new, unprocessed.
 
Is there a better, more eleqent way of doing this or is this pretty much it?
 
Thanks!
Anthony Papillion
