<PRE>Well, from an admin viewpoint, I'd recommend a lot more thinking before 
doing this. The &quot;script every minute&quot; idea causes all sorts of issues on 
the server as well as the database. One hokey query, or one large 
dataset, and you can cause a lot of problems for the entire machine.

What I don't understand is why you need to have a cron job to deal with 
the user data. Why not have your processing script called when the user 
submits? This keeps your script from having to go through the entire 
database to find uncommitted changes. If you're going to have a 
gazillion row database aren't you going to be spending a lot of time on 
queries just to find those not committed?

One other possibility would be to have a second, separate database that 
stores the user input. Have a script that grabs a small number of rows, 
does it's thing, deletes the rows it just worked on, sleeps for a couple 
seconds, and then calls itself. That way your primary database isn't 
getting hit so hard, your secondary database is the one that has to do 
disaster recovery, you can split the machines up if load gets too much, 
and your SA team won't stuff you in a trashcan when your query trashes 
the system.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a better, more eleqent way of doing this or is this pretty much it?
