<PRE>Aptana was what convinced me to try Eclipse again.

I gave it a shot and it installed and looked layed out the way I think.
 However, doing Aptana as a stand alone I had all kinds of problems with
trying to get eclipse plugins to install PLUS they have discontinued their
PHP plugin and plan on donating code from that to PDT.  So you still have to
use PDT[which is a shame, because their plugin had a much better feature
set....  it was limited in that it did not support the new PHP 5.3
functions, but since I'm not using 5.3 it didn't bother me]

&gt;<i> Have you tried aptana? It was built for ror, but they took over pydev

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Too many little consoles..  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Which is the main item which has put me off.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Written in Java and needing to know Java to do a lot of extending of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eclipse[though with PDT going to a markup language for rules, I might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to do quite a bit there]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oddities with network connections:  I went through half a dozen install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; processes, and each one broke irrepairably at some point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Too many versions: which one to use?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PHP code folding inadequacies:  just doesn't fold everything the other
</I>&gt;<i> IDE's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've used can.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Source Class browsing failures:  I've yet to see a function like
</I>&gt;<i> Ultraedit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where an entire project of files is kept up to date for the
</I>&gt;<i> class/function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsers.  OTOH you can emulate all this functionality if you document
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code as it will pick up documentation in standard formats.  So here the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;downside&quot; is a matter of getting really good at commenting code that
</I>&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be commented anyway!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My setup:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I ended up with the all in one PDT installer. Then I added in the Bzr
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plugins for source code repositories.  Then I REMOVED Mylin and installed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the latest version of Mylin....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then I installed the Mylin/Eclipse Redmine plugin[and installed the
</I>&gt;<i> server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side 2.6 plugin on my server].  Finally, the one item that caused weird
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems when I installed originally, I loaded the RSE plugins[Remote
</I>&gt;<i> Server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Environment].  Note: the local one caused me to be unable to open local
</I>&gt;<i> PHP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; files, so the 3rd time around I specifically excluded that one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I added my Redmine server to the task servers[small nit here: under the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current setup, I cannot get a list of /all/ issues.  I have to add
</I>&gt;<i> project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by project, and sub project by sub project.  Gotta find out why and fix
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, outside the &quot;project&quot; concept as I was debugging code that was
</I>&gt;<i> offsite,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then for the Remote Servers I added my FTP and SFTP servers and was able
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browse those repositories online and open the files directly.  [Note:
</I>&gt;<i> small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nit here, a LOT of the tools I wanted are kind of hidden.  I had to keep
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; going to Window-&gt;ShowView-&gt;Other to get a long list of windows to find a
</I>&gt;<i> lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of these things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, so with all this setup, I had 3 features to change.  So I opened the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first task in my project in eclipse, checked the spec, hit activate, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then hunted around for the files on the server.  Finally found the
</I>&gt;<i> oddball
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layout and located the 2 PHP files that needed minor changes to.  Updated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and tested them.  Then when I was done, I went back to the task and used
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature I am now in love with: there will be a tab to &quot;Add Context&quot;.....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; click on that and you have a list of all open files[or is it files you
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opened?]..   Clicked save and I believe it generates an XML file of all
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file paths/files and zips them up, then it gets attached to the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>  Next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I close the issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So NEXT time I have to make a small change, I can go back to this issue
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open the context from Eclipse and it will automatically open the files
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the FTP server for me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second feature, again changed 2 files.  This time I had to dig through a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dozen files to find the area to change and had left them open.  As an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experiment, I went to add context and sure enough, lots of stuff I did
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change was there.  But I could right click and remove items from the
</I>&gt;<i> context
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that were not relevant, and then save them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Soo... that one feature has me sold.  It was quick and easy and I will
</I>&gt;<i> live
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with all the other little annoyances for now to be able to easily record
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which files were changed directly into my project management tool AND be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to open them later[it's easy to add changed files by adding an issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keyword to the files and checking into version control - Bazaar can check
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; files for keywords in the commits and files and update the issue id
</I>&gt;<i> number
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as needed - but that is one way communication, wheras this two way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication is great!]
