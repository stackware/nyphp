<PRE>True story:  I have a colleague who bid on a project and was expected to be the winning bid.  However, another bidder used the phrase &quot;Web 2.0&quot; in their proposal and for that reason alone the project was awarded to the other bidder!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Web 2.0 &quot;how to talk like you know something&quot;
    presentation
Message-ID: &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">4bffc351002251457mf19998cq175a15b28e53952 at mail.gmail.com</A>&gt;

Over the winter break in Decemember, a lot of NYPHP's posted various amusing
presentations done tongue in cheek at various conventions.

One of which was MongoDB for DBA's.

However, another of which[or I just ended up seeing it as a related video]
was about &quot;How to talk about Web 2.0 like you know what your talking
about&quot;..

Basically a presentation on keywords to throw into conversations to act like
you know stuff.

I was talking to a friend the other day and she mentioned how she got so
sick of the word &quot;dynamic&quot; 5-6 years ago since she had to use it in every
proposal she did at her company, multiple times.  And I was going to show
her this video because it was so funny.

But now I can't find it!

So, NYPHP's, come to my rescue and give me a laugh.  I really need it today.
Pull out your most outrageous BSing presentation, bonus points for those
who can find the one I refer to based on so little info.  [Mitch, you need
not apply. :-)]
