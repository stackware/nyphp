Subject: [nycphp-talk] Pear::LiveUser (or other ACL / RBAC Package)
Message-ID: <55361.82162.qm@web65811.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hello,

Does anyone have any experience with PEAR::LiveUser ?
It's still listed as beta, but been around for a long time even before the last 
release.

I am looking for an ACL / RBAC package and management component, but not finding 
much.
A year and a half or so ago, I used ZF ACl, but was not totally happy with it. 

So any suggestions would be great. 

Thanks.
Bill

I wasn't sure how many people are close enough to the Albany area, but
we have a sweet happening coming up:

Bar camps are super fun and a great way to learn a lot of cool things...
hope to see you there.

What were some of the short comings you encountered while using Zend_Acl? I
switched a fairly large PHP app to Zend Framework a year ago and thought
Zend_Acl was a helpful component over the homegrown system we had built.

Seems they have a pretty high opinion of themselves, but that's not too
unusual in the CMS business. I am planning to play around and see for myself
but I wonder if any of you have any experience/opinions about this.

Hi all,

My company needs a jQuery/CSS developer for a couple of weeks. I posted 
the job description on the NYPHP Job list, but I vaguely recall that 
there was mention on this list of a dedicated Javascript list that would 
be more appropriate for Front-end development.

Am I halluca-remembering? Any leads?

Hi Folks:

I'm wondering if anyone here has personal experience using Rackspace's
Cloud service and/or Slicehost.  If so, what's your take, please?

I guess if you have some other preferred vendor, that'd be interesting
to hear.

Thanks,

Hey, 

Rackspace is pretty good - I've used them for many years for professional work.
Slicehost is great as well - except that I had some issues I couldn't solve and moved to linode instead.

Slicehost's management UI is really slick.
Recently I've been using linode (I still use Rackspace for work) for personal stuff and I really like it.

I don't think you'll go wrong with any of those companies.

I've used both EC2 and Rackspace Cloud extensively, and I'm a much larger 
fan of Rackspace Cloud for numerous reasons.

See my blog posts here: http://www.atopia.net/blog/ -- there are two of 
them relating to Rackspace Cloud.

What's your project like?  Will you be developing entirely for commodity 
hardware?  Will you be using something like puppet/chef to spin up and 
control instances?

I've been following these new cloud offerings specifically for php:

http://orchestra.io
http://phpfog.com

I just received beta access to phpfog, but I haven't gotten a chance to try it out yet.

More than that... same company.

http://www.slicehost.com/articles/2008/10/22/big-news-today

I've had slicehost for over 2 years. I'm happy with them. Even before 
the acquisition, they had rackspace-like levels of customer support. It 
was a natural fit.

  The only beef I have is that their pricing is a little stale. I can 
find the same specs cheaper on other providers. One notable one I am 
trying right now is chunkhost.com; $18 cheaper than slicehost for 512MB 
VPS. I've only had a week with them so I haven't had any support issues yet.

Free beta till March 9th.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] I am about to pull my hair out over file uploads with
	cURL. Help!
Message-ID: <4D5B9412.4010806@gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

So I'm working with this new API and doing something that SHOULD be
really, really simple. The API documentation says that I should pass
parameters in a POST call They are:

cmd
session
file_name
message_guid
media

The final variable (media) should contain the binary data of the file
I'm uploading through this call. I'm using cURL and the following code
to perform the call to the API:

post = array("cmd"=>"uploadmessage",
                    "session"=>"$_SESSION[sid]",
                    "message_guid"=>"$msg_guid",
                    "file_name"=>"$file_name.mov",
                    "media"=>"@$target_path",);

                        $ch = curl_init();
                        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
                        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 0);
                        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
                        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
                        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $baseURL);
                        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post);


                        $response = curl_exec($ch);

A few notes:

1. the file is stored in a subdirectory called 'uploads' which is
directly under the current directory the script is executing in. The
variable $target_path will include the directory name and file name
(which will vary). So an example of a $target_path value might be
/uploads/myfile.mp4

2. Since I realize I *might* need to pass the full path to the file,
I've tried replacing $target_path with something like
/home/anthony/workspaces/appname/uploads/$filename and that didn't work
either.

For some reason, I am simply unable to upload this file! Isn't the code
above *supposed* to work? Can anyone spot what's wrong? I've been
wrestling with this little snippet of code for two days and Googleing my
heart out. Help, please!

Thank You,
Anthony Papillion

Hi Anthony

Your example code looks a bit sloppy, probably because you have changed it so 
much in order to try to make it work ;)

In either case, are you using the double quotes around your variables to 
type-cast them? Consider removing the quotes unless really necessary, or results 
might be unexpected, e.g. rather use curly braces for $_SESSION[sid]: 
"{$_SESSION[sid]}".

You mention that

The final variable (media) should contain the binary data of the file


In that case, the following code might be what one would expect to use?

$post = array(
     'cmd' => 'uploadmessage',
     'session' => $_SESSION[sid], // No need for double quotes
     'message_guid' => $msg_guid, // No need for double quotes
     'file_name' => "$file_name.mov",
     'media' => file_get_contents($target_path) // Assigning the binary file data
);

Also, purely judging from the variable name, it looks like $baseURL might be 
pointing to a local URI or only a URL fragment? Is that what was intended?

Regards,
Werner

That and an extreme lack of sleep. Unfortunately, that sloppiness has
infected a good part of my codebase over the last two days since I've
gone through it and changed things to try to get the code to work. A
cleanup job is definitely in order.

No, I did not need to typecast my variables. Hadn't even noticed the
double quotes around them. They weren't there when I started this, I
swear! lol

You're very right. THAT code seems to work with no problem at all. Well,
there *is* a problem, but I think it's on the server side as it seems to
think that there is no 'cmd' variable being passed. Yet, when I
print_r($post) I can clearly see that 'cmd' is being passed. Weird.  But
anyway, YOUR code does indeed work! Thank you for the corrections!

Right. $baseURL has the HTTP address to the API (something like
www.sitename.com/api). I'm using that so I don't have to type out a long
site name over and over as this snippet is part of 9 different calls I
have to make to the API to get a file uploaded and operated on.

Again, thank you *very* much for the help. It is much appreciated. The
use of file_get_contents() never even entered my head and I totally
missed the double quotes.

Thanks!
Anthony

Using the @ sign is the proper way to upload a file via curl in php.  But it's possible that the API is expecting the data differently than how that works (or perhaps there's an issue with the path contained in $target_path).  I think you need this to be an absolute path on the file system rather than relative to where your script is running.

From php.net:
CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS	The full data to post in a HTTP "POST" operation. To post a file, prepend a filename with @ and use the full path. The filetype can be explicitly specified by following the filename with the type in the format ';type=mimetype'. This parameter can either be passed as a urlencoded string like 'para1=val1&para2=val2&...' or as an array with the field name as key and field data as value. If value is an array, the Content-Type header will be set tomultipart/form-data. As of PHP 5.2.0, files thats passed to this option with the @ prefix must be in array form to work.


The server returning that 'cmd' wasn't passed is strange.

Did you try setting verbose to true?  It should output debug info to your error log (or output on command line if you're running it that way).
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, true);

Maybe also add follow location in case the server does some type of redirect?
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);

Is HTTPS involved?

I'm a php developer (beginning level) and I really want to join a
community or a group to discuss php or do trouble-shooting.

Any recommendation?

Yes, you could join the php General user List -- it has a lot more traffic.
