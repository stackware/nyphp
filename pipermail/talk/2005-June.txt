Subject: [nycphp-talk] Making an array from a list item?

Dan;

That took me a couple minutes to transcribe. Probably a little longer to comprehend well enough to use again.  ;)

Does this sond like a reasonable english translation?

	Create an array called $output
	Create a query. Make the query and store the result in $result.

	Iterate through the rows in $result
		if there is no variable $output[$row]['skillID']
			Create one as an array
		Add the $row['knackID'] onto the array $output[$row]['skillID']		

	print it so I can read it.

It works! Thanks! I think the coffee has to really start kicking in before I fully get it though...

ciao!

We could - we easily have it for a handful of people.  Over 10 or so though, we'd have to look at another space (which would be a bar/rooftop in the LES).  Either is doable without much effort.

I am trying to make SOAP work on my Solaris machine which is running PHP
4.3.4. I searched for a simple ?hello world? demo and found some very
convoluted stuff out there. Tried a couple with no luck, I am wondering if
there is something wrong with PHP or my install of SOAP or the ?hello world?
demo.

Anyone out there who has done this and can guide me?

I would be eternally grateful!

Message-ID: <330532b6050601211576f53b90@mail.gmail.com>

Hi gang,

Apologies for the cross post.

There was a security issue found in the included domit-xml xml parsing
library in the current version of Mambo, which we have fixed with this
release (4.5.2.2). The vulnerability includes information disclosure,
including the contents of your configuration.php - so this is an
immediate, critical upgrade.

You can get the full version or patch at MamboForge:

I don't have it here so I can't quote chapter and verse, but Sklar's book
"Essential PHP Tools" has some good examples. You should buy it, but if
you don't, it seems the code examples are available online from apress.com

If you could upgrade to PHP5 you'd enjoy better SOAP support. (-:

2. Does mysql_unbuffered_query really lock the table(s) until all result

they're paying pretty well(so they say) @ ~$35-45 / hr
based in manhattan, 20-30 hrs per week, mysql+php+perl;
they want you to be on-site at least once a week - Which is why I couldn't accept.

Anyone interested, let me know.

That's not bad for a full-time job with benefits and job stability, but 
$45/hour (or less) is not "paying pretty well" for consulting work.

Friends don't let friends get screwed. :-)

no for consulting/freelance no stability you're getting screwed. Here in 
Vermont i get $50 hour for contracting but then again that's vermont. In NYC 
i am not sure of the rates but i am sure you could get more than that ;)

As a freelancer you gotta get your own equipment, software,
communications, etc., and ALSO health insurance, liability insurance,
accountant etc. So you most definitely need to make sure your hourly
rate makes it possible to fund all the non-salary stuff.

NYC PHP programmers should make a minimum of $50/hr, and I get offers
up to $120.

Short-term projects of real high import are the $120/hr variety, and
the longer term projects are typically of the $50-75/hr variety.

This is all from my direct experience, which is questionable at best :-)

As a frequent employer of consulting programmers (not so much php, but 
similar) I agree. I run the IS department at a Museum ... a non-profit. 
$40 is what we pay consulting IT people and programmers when we beg them 
to work cheaper because we're poor and they go for it; $60-70 is more 
typical; and $125 is not unheard of (though we can only pay it in rare, 
extremely well-funded circumstances and for engagements with strict 
completion requirements).

But they other thing I will say: we /always/ advertise a job for the 
lowest amount we think we can possibly get, and we /expect/ talented and 
experienced people to request higher pay. Just because it says $35-45, 
it doesn't mean that's the best they'll do.

As a consultant I agree with Mitch 100%. As a hiring manager I have to add that because it is an hourly rate, it will depend a great deal on the level of supervision exercised over your work (which includes the work environment).

The more you know the better you can negotiate - so try and go as far into the process as you can without agreeing to a rate, to learn all you can about their situation. If you are a good fit for them, show them that, and ask for a higher rate. It's very much like a poker game, by the way.

As a freelancer you gotta get your own equipment, software,
communications, etc., and ALSO health insurance, liability insurance,
accountant etc. So you most definitely need to make sure your hourly
rate makes it possible to fund all the non-salary stuff.

NYC PHP programmers should make a minimum of $50/hr, and I get offers
up to $120.

Short-term projects of real high import are the $120/hr variety, and
the longer term projects are typically of the $50-75/hr variety.

This is all from my direct experience, which is questionable at best :-)

May I ask real dumb dilettante question? Thanks. How is it that a client
can agree to an hourly rate without there being some kind of cap on it? If
I say $75/hr and bill for 20 hrs, that's one thing; quite another if I
bill for, say, 50.

There is the balancing act. If you push too high on the hourly rate,
the client will then push you to get the whole thing done in an hour
;-)

Ultimately, they will have say $20,000 to get a given project done,
and they will pay you the same amount in the end, either take your
time with a low rate, or bust your butt for a high one.

I avoid T&M (Time & Materials) projects for this very reason - they
already know how much they are going to spend, and are only looking to
get someone cheep.

Adding my two cents (or perhaps non-cents).

Nearly all the "big" consulting companies follow this format when proposing
consulting work:

1.  "Through our vast knowledge we think this project will cost $xxx" (fyi -
this rarely occurs);
2.  "This is only an estimate, using best practices" (and witchcraft);
3.  "We used the following rates/project plan to price this estimate";
4.  "If for some reasons the job take longer (e.g. reality sets in) we will
use this rate card for all work going forward";
5.  "We of course will never charge you additional money without another
estimate and your approval" (oh, btw when we get to this point you'll be so
far into the project you'll have no choice but approve the new estimate)
6.  We will meet frequently to ensure that you're aware of when we're going
pull this stunt.
7.  rinse and repeat. 


Can you tell that I live up in Boston - home of the "Big Dig" ;-)

Enjoy the weekend

I've personally have never done any "real" consulting work....
except maybe in college... where I was paid like ~$15/hr...
I was just a student and just learning at the time...
so very different situation.  I've always been able to work
full time w/ benefits.  Consultants' needs are a foreign topic to me.

However, consultant or not, I would never knowningly let a colleague
get "screwed" on pay; like someone else said...the pay is most likely negotiable.

Work is work...money is always green, to someone who needs it enough.
Or wants some experience bad enough.

That's not bad for a full-time job with benefits and job stability, but 
$45/hour (or less) is not "paying pretty well" for consulting work.

Friends don't let friends get screwed. :-)

Hi gang,

Today we (Mambo core developers) learned that our IRC server was going
offline for good. It was provided gratis, so we couldn't complain :-)

The question has been posed, "What now?" Is there anyone here that
would be interested in providing IRC services for the Mambo project?

I'd donate the servers myself, but the hosting center forbids IRC :-(

New York PHP would have the bandwidth/server to do this.  However, we'd need someone with experience to set and maintain the IRC server software itself.  If this is something to discuss, ping me off list.

An alternative, as Joe mentioned, would be freenode - they have a nice network.

haha.. that's a temporary honor. It was Denver with their massive 
baggage handling system for many years ( I still get a kick out of 
seeing blue screens on their baggage claim monitors -- they is always at 
least one when I pass thru).

I suspect the Big Dig will be dethroned if NYC gets an Olympic 
opportunity, or perhaps even with the West Side stadium project.

Me and a couple of friends used to host/admin one of the irc.2600.net servers some time ago, was an obsd machine at exodus. (i used to nick muted on that network, im sure someone still remembers that time..) 
It was a Hybrid box, we set the thing up, it ran pretty well.
I also have a server, at pilosoft, its a 1U netra t1, so I can host it if you want. Ill make you a jail. Or, you can have a couple of machines hosting it, for load and redundancy reasons. Or of course, something like efnet or freenode would be the way to go. It is nice when you are a server admin, not just a channel op tho, dont know about freenode, but i dont think that would be that easy to get at something like efnet

Ditto that.

With irc.freenode.net positioned to give IRC hosting to open source
projects...why not use them?

I am regular on several channels there and can attest to their reliability.

In the case of Brooklyn Museum--actually yes, we often agree on an 
overall price for jobs. But it depends partly on where the funding is 
coming from. When it's my IT department funding and I know I'm going to 
be supervising the work directly, I don't mind doing it hourly 
(especially because then I can often ask the programmer to do additional 
work that was not part of the original spec, without having to get it 
approved by people outside the IT department). When the work is being 
funded by some other budget (kiosk content for a special exhibition, for 
example) it's always this-much-work for this-amount-of-money.

Sometimes I'm hiring programmers not just to do exact work that's 
perfectly spec'ed out--sometimes I'm hiring programmers to tell ME the 
best way to do things, and to do it that way. In that case, hourly it is 
(usually).

There is already a #mambo on freenode. What we need is a private IRC
channel for the core developers, hence the need for a private server.

If there was a way to have a private channel (authentication required)
on freenode I would be all over it.

Mitch,

in freenode's poliy anything not directly related to the project needs to 
use ##mambo, hence if you go there, you get #mambo and the other channel can 
join you or they will be moved to ##mambo.

check ##php since they are NOT related to the actual PHP but a support 
channel they have to move thier channel.

anyhow i think freenode would be a good home since you are an OSS project 
and they are focused on them.

Mitch,

sorry i missed the actual mention of private channel.

All IRCD's offer a way to have a private channel you would just set it 
secret

/mode #channel +sk your-key-here

the s makes it hidden from /list results and the k makes it so to join you 
have to type /join #channel your-channel-key

hope this helps :)

I am getting all manor of errors. It must be something I am not doing, or
something I am doing and should not be...

The last error I got said something about needing to install cURL, so I did
that. Now it is still giving me an error when I try to use print_r(); and it
only returns Object when I use print();

Please someone help or just plain shoot me!

Thanks!

I am involved in an educational program full time
every day (8 ? 4).  But I also need to work to support
myself while continuing in the program.  Is there any
possibility for PHP work during evening or weekend
hours?  I am wondering and hoping that someone on this
board has some experience or ideas about the
possibilities and how to look for them?

Thanks in advance for you advice and any input.

Don't know where you're at with this, but I hit your client, and I see
you get this error from cURL:   "curl_exec error 60 SSL certificate
problem, verify that the CA cert is OK"

Looks like cURL is trying to verify the authenticity of your cert,
which being self signed, may be giving it problems (dunno).  Have you
tried:

curl_setopt( $res, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0 );

Which should stop cURL from trying to verify it.  Or test it without SSL?

Would anyone be interested to review some of my PHP
scripts?  I don?t know if this is too much to ask, I
hope not.  I?m trying to make my code according to the
best practices and style.  I?m reading Zend
certification study guide, which is great.  But I?m
coming from a C++/Java background and old habits are
hard to break.  I think I could use the advice of a
more experienced PHP developer to catch myself.

Many thanks in advance for any help and advice given.

Is it code you can make publicly available, I'm sure you'll get plenty
of feedback if you do  :)

Otherwise, send me some snippets off list, I'd love to see how a
C++/Java programmer is using PHP.

Is it PHP5?

Hi,

I don?t know if making my code publicly available
would help since my scripts might not be useful to
anyone, so they might not get anyone?s attention.  I
try to make my stuff interesting in terms of coding
style.  I definitely know what I need to do but having
useful tips how to do certain things is something
else.  I?m sending a few of my scripts (in a zipped
file) anything you care to browse through and comment
would be great.   I?m using PHP4.3.5 so there isn?t
much object oriented coding. That?s too bad since I
could really do it up with features like protected and
private members.

Thank you in advance for your time, and in case you?re
interested in a comparison between Java and PHP I
found this link that you may like 
http://www.tek271.com/articles/JavaOrPhp.html and find
useful.

Hey gang,

Somewhat related is what happens when you want to bring a store online
for a small local business. What procesing partner can you recommend?

I'm used to doing this for gigantic megacorporations where it doesn't
matter and relationships are already created; but this is only useful
to the megacorporations...

For the SMB market, who can you recommend for payment processing (and
I don't mean PayPal!)?

hrm, I got so caught up arguing with the site you linked
that I forgot to look at your code :)

Four things that stick out during a quick look

1. In several places you echo out links to the user agent, but encode the
ampersand, I don't think you need to do this, since you are using it as 
a seperator, not a charecter (or such is my understanding).
eg.
doQueryIndex.inc
line 59
href="/anp/auth_man.php?event=doQueryLogin&amp;loginAgent=doQueryLogin&amp;target=doQueryIndex

2. You're using a global array to store data in physiology.php
$_REQUEST['issue'] = htmlspecialchars(urldecode($url_array[4]));

By storing processed data (in this case by urldecode) in a global
variable, you make impossible for another function to determine
later on wether or not the processing has occured. What if I passed
an issue paramater in either a GET or POST?

3. This looks really dangerous
   $app = $class . '.inc';
   include ($app);  
If url fopen wrappers are enabled I can include any file I want, from anywhere.
If you absolutly need to do something like this, base it on a switch or if 
structure, 
if $class == "something" include "something.inc" elseif
$class == "somethingelse" include "somethingelse.inc".

4. Your zip structure didn't include any directory structure, it's a 
good idea to keep your .inc files out of the document root. This way
they can't be viewed by end users, or executed unexpectedly.

Hi,

Thank you for your review.  Interesting to know in how
many ways a code can fail.  I?m going to find a better
way to handle the points you mentioned.

Thanks again for your time and help.

Using &amp; as a separator in output URLs is required if the output is
XHTML, because an ampersand by itself is not an allowed entity. So the
above snippet is fine.

I stand corrected, thanks!



An entity reference was found in the document, but there is no
reference by that name defined. Often this is caused by misspelling
the reference name, unencoded ampersands, or by leaving off the
trailing semicolon (;). The most common cause of this error is
unencoded ampersands in URLs as described by the WDG in "Ampersands in
URLs".

Entity references start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon
(;). If you want to use a literal ampersand in your document you must
encode it as "&amp;" (even inside URLs!). Be careful to end entity
references with a semicolon or your entity reference may get
interpreted in connection with the following text. Also keep in mind
that named entity references are case-sensitive; &Aelig; and &aelig;
are different characters.

Note that in most documents, errors related to entity references will
trigger up to 5 separate messages from the Validator. Usually these
will all disappear when the original problem is fixed.

Does anyone know of any good documentation about how
to add a component to mambo?  A few months ago I
looked at a number of online resources for good
documentation on how to add a component to mambo and
found nothing either comprehensive or complete.

I am now reading an article on different CMS and it
brings me back to my original questions about mambo. 
Here?s the article if anyone is interested

Too many horror stories, too much frustration for non-PayPal clients
to get started, and too much difficulty dealing with PayPal in
general.

If you want to sell something online, PayPal only represents a small
percentage of the market - as everyone has a debit/credit card
nowadays, but few use PayPal.

I think being technical skews our perspectives - when you talk to a
non-geek, it becomes painfully clear that PayPal is only ancillary,
and not a major provider.

You can use Paypal as a processor for credit card transactions
The purchaser does not need a Paypal account
Millions and millions of people are familiar with it through eBay
I think the main issue for the developer is ease of customization

One good one in my experience was netbilling.com
Another thing to consider, is that may be Yahoo store is a better option. At some point we set that up for a customer, because there was a deadline, and there was no need for a ridiculous ammount of custom code - yahoo will process your payments, as well as host your inventory and give you a shopping cart and tools for management - great if you want to setup someone with a do once and forget option. You will still make plenty of hours doing support, trust me : )

Horror Stories: http://www.paypalsucks.com/

Much of my displeasure with PayPal dissolved away when
they switched to stop requiring an account to send payment.

These days you can send a payment via paypal just by using
your credit card, no lasting account.

Hey Leila,

Andrew Eddie (fearless development leader for Mambo) has written a
two-part series on creating components for Mambo, you can see them
here:

http://help.mamboserver.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=11&id=135&Itemid=64

Running out the door, but will most definitely be reading the
Drupal/Mambo comparison when I get back - thanks for the link!

Since we do seem to have a lull on the list... :)

This project was brought to my attention this morning.   Seems 
interesting, though I haven't had time to dig into it yet.   They're 
looking for testers and developers.  The have a very comprehensive 
developer's guide in PDF at: http://znf.zeronotice.com/docs/znf-0.7.0.pdf


"[ZeroNotice] have developed an open source PHP5 reimplementation of 
Struts.

This is not the first attempt to rewrite the Struts implementation, or 
part of it, in PHP, but after spending a lot of time studying existing 
open source frameworks, like Phrame, PHPMVC, Struts4PHP, Seagull and Vida 
we decided to reimplement a brand new framework from scratch for many 
reasons. First of all, all the mentioned frameworks, except Vida, are 
written in PHP4 and we believe that its object engine (Zend Engine 1) is 
too limited for developing enterprise level web application. 

At the same time the code we analyzed is written without a rigorous 
approach (coding standards, compliance to W3C standards, output of 
notice/warnings, lack of documentation/examples). 

Last but not least frameworks claiming to be a porting of Struts have made 
no code optimization during the porting from J2EE to PHP. We're searching 
for comments, feedback, bug signaling and best of all new developers. Any 
kind of contribution will be appreciated! ZNF is free software released 
under GNU/LGPL license, the official ZNF home page is at 
http://znf.zeronotice.com/."

I know a lot of people are busy and/or out of town, but none of it has
to do with fun. Many of the usual suspects, in fact, will not be on
hand for tonight's salute to php's 10th at the Remote Lounge.

You can add me to the list of workload casualties, as I have been
burning the midnight oil on the upcoming Mambo 4.5.3 release and a
pile of articles/writing, and consequently getting behind on my
project work and domestic duties, which just makes the days go even
longer!

Would love to be there tonight, and am truly disappointed that I am
not able to make it. Everyone please have an extra beer for me to make
up for my absence ;-)

You're almost there.  Run the same command at your shell prompt instead
of the mysql prompt.  In other words, don't login to the mysql command
line client first.

Or, if you want to run jaime.sql once you are already sitting at the mysql
prompt:

mysql> \. /path/to/jaime.sql

I just noticed while doing a little fact-checking that apparently the
source file has to be in the same directory or a descendant directory of
the directory you were in when you launched mysql; you can't go back up
the tree. True?

Anyone here ever pitch PHP to a Java house?

 

I have a fairly large client who's interest may be waning due to their
current Java setup.  They are listening, but not necessarily intently.  I've
been doing my reading, but my time is very short.  I'm finding a lot about
scalability, but for the most part, the articles are short and the
discussions are generally
my-language-can-kick-your-language's-ass-cuz-I-said-so, and
you're-all-children-use-C-or-perl.  I need to get off the playground and
actually prove to this client that php is a viable option.

 

Current site is running Struts, using customs Java for model and controller
and JSP for the view

F5 Labs Big IP load balancer

8 Machines running Apache 2 in worker MPM mode (which I've read that PHP
doesn't quite love)

Resin 2.1

Oracle 9i db

 

A good friend mentioned that he usually argues that the development time is
preferable with PHP. Anyone here have resources to share or a good general
direction to walk in with this argument?

 

Thanks!

Mark,

You could take the following three-pronged approach to a situation like 
this; after you've honestly evaluated the client's needs and decided that 
PHP would suit them better than Java.

* Establish PHP's corporate credibility
Point out that IBM has partnered with Zend Technologies to provide support 
for PHP.  Better yet, plan to attend and let them know about NYPHP's 
upcoming June meeting with members of the IBM Software Group: 
http://nyphp.org/ 
You might also have them take a look at SourceLabs: http://sourcelabs.com/

* Show how PHP's features are enterprise ready
Pick some case studies from Zend about PHP's application in the 
enterprise:  http://www.zend.com/company/customers.php
 
* Show examples of a migration path
To keep their J2EE developers comfortable, show them that their existing 
Java knowledge translates nicely to PHP5.   They might be interested in 
reading about the ZNF (PHP5 reimplementation of Struts) which I found out 
about today: http://znf.zeronotice.com/ or phpPatterns from Harry Fuecks: 
http://www.sitepoint.com/articlelist/210
Of course, they can even choose to run PHP and J2EE side by side to take 
advantage of each platforms relative advantage. :)

You may find this to be of interest:

Also this blog by Peter Yared:
http://peteryared.blogspot.com/2003/09/next-language.html

Peter Yared is the founder of ActiveGrid which has developed
something called the 'Grid Application Server', which uses
LAMP to create horizontally scalable 'transaction grids'.

It might be worthwhile to take a look at the ActiveGrid approach, 
particularly the 'old thinking' vs. 'new thinking' at:

Hi Mark,
 
In addition to the good points made by others, you may also want to mention
Oracle's involvement/investment in PHP, especially since your client is
using Oracle themselves.

A company for whom I consult was considering porting their existing ASP 
software from PHP/Perl to Java.  Their reason had mostly to do with 
their new tech director and the fact that he only knew Java.

Most of my arguments fell on deaf ears.  The one that finally caused the 
bosses to put the kibosh on the Java porting project was my reminder of 
how the software is hacked almost daily to add new chrome and doodads 
for specific ASP clients without affecting the others.  PHP (and Perl) 
are simply better suited to this sort of ad hoc surgery than Java.

It also helped when I told them that their PHP/PostgreSQL production 
servers had been up for 480 days without a reboot (they were also 
considering porting to an MS architecture).

Mark:
I concur with Krook's three prong approach and would like to elaborate on 
the third point -- Coexistence.

I would suggest that you do not want to challenge the J2EE skill base and 
mindset of this client. Instead you want to show them that PHP can be used 
as a productivity enhancement to the front-end of their web application 
development. Focus on segmenting their project into Web/UI (client-side) 
and backend business process (server-side) architectures. Then site 
examples about how PHP is a more productive than Java for developing web 
application. Avoid comparisons about Java and PHP. The bottom line is that 
both are adequate languages, especially with PHP5 moving to OO. Focus on 
productivity as this correlates to time which == $$. To make this argument 
clear you want to stress that integration between a struts based PHP 
framework and a J2EE backend is feasible.

One word of caution,  
Warning the following is a rant, read with caution or
don?t read if you don?t want to be bothered,


With success comes migration of jobs elsewhere and
more than 100million hungry programmers poised and
ready to take the jobs away.  Sorry for the trumpet of
doom and despair but it?s happened before.  

Since I already spilled the beans, let me elaborate a
little more.  The only reason PHP remains a good
source of employment in New York is because the big
boys (mid to large size corporations) don?t take it
seriously.  Once they start doing so, next thing you
know they?re importing cheap programmers to do the
work and whatnot. Let the Java people remain in their
Java houses and think their big giant cow of a
language is the best thing that ever happened to the
IT community.  

With PHP5 becoming the standard installation in all
shops, we all know that Java loses its lead as a
better object oriented language and the only thing it
has to boast.  But let?s keep this a sweet secret.  

Sorry for the rant, I hope I haven?t ruined your
morning.

What has happened at a few shops I worked with, use php to "model" the
project, then move it over to Java.  What happens?   No one moves it
"over" to Java, it just works as is. And everyone just moves on.

I think one of the answer avenues here is that for raw competitive purposes,
the single developer/small shop should deliver PHP and JAVA 
and be able to handle the maximum diversity of the client's needs. 
 
>From my experiences in corporate environments with competing technologies
setting in, the most successful shop/developer/IT manager 
in the mix has a handle on the broadest array of technologies at play and
manages and delivers the thoroughbred mix.
 
The corp will/must go where it needs and the emps typically need to ratchet
to match. 
 
I feel independent work works out best when one really focuses gangbusters
on what one does best and delivers it in spades and fast. When the client
really 
doesn't want your stuff, you leave your portfolio/card and you must nail the
next client that wants your stuff now.
 
I think PHP would benefit most from making/delivering compatibility
extensions/strategies that embrace (I mean, just swallow up) what JAVA puts
out. 
And then PHP moves on, shoulder to shoulder with JAVA taking all it can give
and sucking up more marketplace nonetheless.
 
So that in theory the discussion becomes more how do we get our JAVA to
maximize its integration with PHP which is just obviously such 
an incredible monster everywhere product.
 
Of course, I have not yet jumped on the continuing JAVA up tick myself. But
I think if I add a new technology to my personal portfolio (and I want to
keep my technologies very portable and very web related), JAVA would be
next.

Anyone here ever pitch PHP to a Java house?

 

I have a fairly large client who's interest may be waning due to their
current Java setup.  They are listening, but not necessarily intently.  I've
been doing my reading, but my time is very short.  I'm finding a lot about
scalability, but for the most part, the articles are short and the

You guys never cease to impress me.  And in such a short time as well.

I began writing a summary of the pros and cons of php and whatnot, but it
felt so loaded and bs.  In the end I pointed out that the languages are
comparable as far as the web is concerned and have their preferred uses and
environments.  I'd emphasized the "Time-to-market" and bottom line and gave
examples of large companies switching to PHP.  You guys gave me a great
palette to work with.

Thanks so much!

i believe the CSS has to remain in the header for it to be recognised but i

i know yoiu can embed css using the <style> tags like you can js.

If you wish you can include a css file by putting something like

<style type="text/css">
<?php include('styles.css');?>
</style>

However, this will mean that the css data has to be sent on each and 
every request.  By using the link syntax the styles fie will only be 
fetched periodically assuming the client is using caching, and can also 
be cached by proxy servers, which will increase the performance of the 
site/application.

.css and .js files can typically be included anywhere in the HTML doc and
the info will get pulled in. It is not pretty but it works.

But for clarity, in a hypothetical file such as base.php with content of:

<?php
inlcude_once(../../../head.inc.php);
include(variablebody.php);
include_once(../foot.inc.php);
?>

If the hypothetical content of head.inc.php is similar to:

<?php
$switchvar = 33;

$style1='<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/externalstyle.css"
title="style" />'; 
$style2='<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/internalstyle.css"
title="style" />'; 

($switchvar==33)? $stylechoice = $style1 : $stylechoice = $style2;

echo <<<END

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<title>$switchvar Page</title>
<meta name="Description" content="" />
<meta name="Keywords" content="" />
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" />
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="mon, 04 dec 1999 21:29:02 gmt" />
<meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache" />
$stylechoice
</head>

END;

$newbodyvar = $switchvar++;
?>

Then it doesn't matter at all where the file called head.inc.php is
physically located because the .css file won't get included until
PHP has composited the page and sent it down to the browser as raw HTML and
the browser will grab the .css include according to your 
true web site dir structure.

Is your stylesheet within document root? If it is, the first method that 
you mention is best. This lets the browser handle fetching the 
stylesheet, so it can cache it and issue conditional GETs for subsequent 
requests. This cuts down on your bandwidth consumption.

As per your specific question, just remember that PHP only cares about 
PHP code - CSS, JavaScript, and HTML are all things you output with PHP 
(or place outside of PHP blocks). This stuff is up to you.

Hope that helps.

Chris

To be far, internet giants can't be compared with other industries.  For example, the "enterprise" market, such as automotive, financial, and manufacturing, have a completely different take on technology than these internet behemoths.  The internet pillars are technical institutions, and have technically savvy people by the dozens.

The classic enterprise, however, have a very different view, and thus rely on the sealed-and-delivered solutions like Java.  But with backing from the blue-chips like IBM, PHP can integrate deep within these environments, thus reducing the do-it-yourself nature of open source, and providing the total solution non-technical enterprises expect.

I was wondering if NYPHP or Zend are participating in this program? I

Google got full and didn't have room for PHP or Zend.

We jumped on the chance immediately, and barely made it. Looks like
this was a very popular idea, but tragic that PHP/Zend don't get to
participate.

OTOH there are several notable PHP projects that are participating,
which IMHO give a good show of the PHP community in general, as well
as the technology's importance in the open source universe :-)

I completely agree, but this was part of my point.

If I raced cars for a living, and I was in the market for a car to drive 
around town, I might be looking at something like this:

http://www3.porsche.com/english/usa/carreragt/

If I was an average Joe, I might be more interested in this:

http://www.fordvehicles.com/cars/focus/

The latter is clearly more practical. With open source software, there 
is no price barrier to deter anyone. So, we can all drive around with 
Porsche Carrera GTs, even though very few of us can properly appreciate 
such a machine. However, this doesn't justify the argument that Porsches 
wreck too often, so it's better to stick with Ford.

Then again, maybe my analogies are too far-fetched. :-)

I think this is the kicker--though I'd rather have the .css file not in the docroot I think the performance is a more desireable choice. Well, mostly. I'm just starting to use CSS and I'd rather figure it out now when there are only a couple requests per page instead of later.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <20050610040406.27209.qmail@web30810.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Java is not an easy language to work with.  If anyone
has the time and the interest you can validate this
for yourself.  Java has a lot of features that can
bring a shop to a halt. For example garbage collection
is supposed to be one of those magical features of
Java, except there is caveat.  The garbage collection
system reclaims a memory if and when the memory is
released.  When is the memory released?  That?s where
you have to watch out for traps and pitfalls,  just
because you?re done with an object and it?s apparently
out of scope does not mean that it?s released.  I saw
this happen at a Java shop I used work at, every day
at 12 noon the server went down!   It took a few days
of intense debugging by the most senior level
developer to figure out the problem.

Just take a quick look at this one post from a popular
Java forum,
http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=24&t=027721
.  There seems to be confusion over whether Java
passes by value or reference, and that is supposed to
be one of the most basic and fundamental rules of the
language, one of the features that made Java oh soo
soo.. much better than C++.   Except it seems with all
the exceptions nobody is really sure when the rule
applies and when it doesn?t.  

But Java was developed by Sun Corporation, so it has
the seal of approval of the big corporation bosses. 
It didn?t hurt that Sun was in the news for years over
fighting with the big bad Microsoft to keep Java pure
and open (yawn).  Plus, the CEOs and CTOs of
corporations that choose Java don?t have to worry
about the cost and time of development they already
solved that problem.

 i installed xampp on my computer and when i go to http://localhost. it seems to work
however, how do i set up the configuration file so that i can have access to the pages of my websites tests.

this is when i type http://localhost/mywebsite that it shows the file list instead of showing the index.htm page.

before i installed Xammp, the document root was var/www/html (where all my websites folder were located) but since i i installed Xammp, the document root seemed to have become, somehow, /opt/lampp/htdocs/. if i leave my websites folder in var/www/html and i type http://localhost/something, it says not present on the server. when i move the website folder in /opt/lampp/htdocs/ and i type http://localhost/something, then it display the directory contents of the folder without launching the index.htm file to display the page.

Furthrermore, i was able to enter in phpmyadmin, but when i want to create a new database, it tells me :

#1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '' at line 1

any idea what is wrong ?

i tried to add privileges, but it is the same thing after that.

Is there any tutorial that explain how to setup the configuration files :

/opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf The Apache configuration file.

In /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf you need to change the DirectoryIndex
directive so that it looks for index.htm as well as index.html

Check the DocumentRoot setting in opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf  -- Xammp
does not use your system httpd.conf, it uses its own. So yes, none of
your previous settings apply now.

You have 2 issues here.  Once is changing the default directory for
Apache.
The second is the default page within that directory (e.g.: default.html
or index.php or index.html).

First, the default directory issue.

XAMPP is set up to install in its own directory structure.  According to
the literature this is to make it easy if you wish to remove it:  

"If you decide that XAMPP isn't needed any more just delete the XAMPP
directory and it's completely removed from your system."
	-http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

To change that you need to change the default directory in your Apache
config file.  (Although the default location is usually " var/www/html",
so xampp must have changed it...) That can usually be found in the
following directory structure:

apache/conf/httpd.conf

To change the default directory (e.g.:DocumentRoot from
"/opt/lampp/htdocs/" to "var/www/html" Add the following:

<Directory  "C:/[the path]/var/www/html ">
    # Changing default None to All in next line, to enable .htaccess
    AllowOverride All
    Allow From All
    Options  ExecCGI
    SetHandler cgi-script
</Directory>

Second is the default FILE issue:

However, you may change these default settings if you edit the
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file in this section: 
#
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
#
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.shtml index.php ...
</IfModule>

Obviously there may be differences in different versions of Apache, and
I haven't really delved into XAMMP yet.  But I hope this helps a bit.

Thanks, I did not know that Xammp sets up it's own httpd.conf.  But that
make sense, considering the ability to remove it by simply deleting the
directory structure.

DO you like using Xammp?

Message-ID: <20050610190139.B0D9BA86DE@virtu.nyphp.org>

Attn: cross posted to ATLPHP

I am working on a project that will require running about 3500 street
addresses through a geocoder application to return lat/long pairs.

My first idea was to use cURL to post the address to the http://geocoder.us/
site...once for each address, parsing the returned result to get lat/long
and store those with the address record in my db.

I haven't tried it yet because a quiet but persistent voice is whispering to
me that looping through 3500 records and opening a cURL session to another
website to screen-scrape the results is somehow not a good idea...for my
server or theirs. I don't know enough about all of the issues to be able to
articulate why (perhaps you want to enlighten me)...just that it seems like
a bad idea.

Does anyone know a better way? I can't pay for a commercial service for this
but if there's a faster, more efficient means of usign the free services
available I'd appreciate hearing about it.

Thanks,
John Corry

I think these days, 3500 hits is a drop in the bucket.  Maybe if u did
a few million someone would call the boss, but for 3500, I doubt it.

Apparently their web service is based on this cpan module.

http://search.cpan.org/~sderle/Geo-Coder-US/

You should be able to cook up a perl frontend script you can call to do 
the lookups pretty easily.

Heh, for 3500, I would just go ahead and scrape it.

Once I wrote an app which, when given a street address, would fetch and 
scrape zip+4 results from the usps.gov website.
It worked without a hitch until google and yahoo linked it from their 
front page.. around noon, the app stopped working..
and so did the entire usps.gov website. A minute later my client was on 
the phone informing me that the postmaster general called and was going 
to shut them down for DOS'ing the servers.

This request intrigued me, since I've been looking at creating an 
interface to Google maps via PHP and I needed to get lat/long points 
for the addresses currently in my database. My first attempt was to 
use a query to Google Maps, capture the output and use preg_replace 
on the returned XML string to extract the lat/long pair. Looking at 
http://geocoder.us/ I saw that one use SOAP, XML-RPC, and REST-ful 
RDF clients to get the information. I chose to use the RDF method, 
since it returns the shortest string.  I then used the miniXML 
package <http://minixml.psychogenic.com/index.html> to turn the 
returned XML string into an associative array.

Here's the code I used:

<?
include('./minixml.inc.php');
set_time_limit(0);  // the code took a long time to go out and back
function get_lat_long($q) {  // $q is the address string with ZIP code
         $xmlDoc = new MiniXMLDoc();
         $gm = fopen('http://rpc.geocoder.us/service/rest?address=' . 
str_replace(' ','%20',$q),'r');
         $tmp = @fread($gm,30000);
         fclose($gm);
//
//  I probably should do some error checking here to make sure I got 
an XML string
//
         $xmlDoc->fromString($tmp);
         $tmpa = $xmlDoc->toArray();
         return(array($tmpa['rdf:RDF']['geo:Point']['geo:lat'],$tmpa['rdf:RDF']['geo:Point']['geo:long']));
}
?>

I wrote and debugged this in less than an hour.

For those looking to use your skills for volunteer endeavors, take a 
look at Taproot Foundation, a non-profit that awards services grants 
that are fulfilled by professionals.  I've recently heard that they are 
running low on technical volunteers.

	http://www.taprootfoundation.org/

Taproot has more of a marketing agency model than a technology model.  
I've been on two projects with them, and it hardly gets more complex 
than HTML, CSS and mailto form.  This might not seem to exciting for 
some of you, but the whole process of going through a well-defined 
project provides complementary insights (training).

Thanks,

Stephen

As far as I know, Electronic versions of O'reilly books are only
available through their Safari service for online reading (or chpater
based downloads). So, I don't think those are legit. Can't say about
the others.

The way I see it, it's all about risk.

Hourly rate. The customer takes all the risk.

Fixed rate. The consultant takes all the risk.

I have not found much middle ground.
There are different strategies to try and reduce risk, but who carries the 
risk, on my experience, doesn't change easily.

On this, I agree, but I think your black and whites below are too
black and white.

> Hourly rate. The customer takes all the risk.

That depends. Do you have accurate specs and reasonable estimates? In
my experience, the upfront work done to make hourly contracts work
makes for better projects with higher customer satisfaction at the
end. It also results in happier consultants, who don't feel like
they're getting nickel-and-dimed all the time.

If you don't trust your consultant to do the work as efficiently as
possible, don't hire that person.

> Fixed rate. The consultant takes all the risk.

Depends. Again, in my experience, fixed rate bids are often heavily
padded, because the consultant assumes they're going to get screwed.

I work almost exclusively hourly, and if I finish something early, I
always bill less than the estimate. Yes, this has happened a few
times, and when it does, it's actually cheaper for the client.

Either way, I get paid for work I actually do.

Sensible discussion.

I disagree about the risk part. If the consultant takes on too much risk, such as might happen with a loosely-defined,  fixed-price project, it is risky for the client. In that case, who took on the risk?

It costs money to make careful, detailed specs. That effort has to be covered somewhere -- is it a product of a prior loss (client's last project failed, but now they know what they want) or is it fruit of the consultant's expertise and experience (in which case her rate should be commensurate, no?). There is no free lunch.

Also detailed, careful specs preclude much of the creative/techno-creative input a consultant can have. If bound to a spec, then sure -- it goes well, but many consultants want to contribute creative solutions and not just code to specs. 

Bottom line is satisfy the client, no? If the client knows what she wants, then do the work for hire. If the client doesn't, then help her define it, for hire, or perhaps choose to limit your scope of involvement until the project is well-defined.

Just be sure not to choose to do a project that is not defined, or define a project for free (perhaps expecting to get the build). That way you either work on well-defined projects, or work on defining projects. 

As a hirer/manager I prefer to pay hourly rate for technical services, commensurate with knowledge, skills, and experience. Then I apply frequent checks of work against desired product, which requires me to project manage in light of project goals and objectives (blasphemy!). It permits market rates for services, with the good guys able to charge higher rates -- which is fine, because I also don't buy large blocks of time. I bear the risk, because it is my project, and the consultant bears the risk of reputation and uncertain employment -- as usual. 

Most of the problems I see are between naive clients who don't manage and don't hire a manager, and consultants who took on ill-defined work or work that looked like a loser, hoping to convert it somehow or perhaps bail if it got too bad (or something better came along).

Caveat emptor. Nothing new here, move along...nothing to see.

Then at least I could outsource myself to someone local (rimshot)

In all honesty, I think the toughest part in this city is developing
the contacts. Once that is done, your talent and work ethic will take
care of the rest, and give back what you put into it.

A funny sidenote - in the Mambo universe there is a horrible slant
regarding talent on the template making side, where anyone and
everyone is promoting themselves as 'Mambo template specialists'. Even
when they suck. What blows me away is that there are still floods of
people in panic mode because they cannot get a template put together
in time, or need someone to setup a Mambo and import their (usually
static) content.

So if you know anything about PHP, HTML and Mambo, you should be doing
just fine ;-) Take on the $300 template gigs, and eventually you will
establish a reputation. If that is a good reputation, then you should
not have to look for work anymore, and people will find you looking
for Mambo help, which of course ups your rate.

You will NOT however find the $150/hr stuff as a Mambo template guy.
Those gigs are almost exclusively with the financial research firms
and so on, and it is very hard work that (occasionally at least) is
not worth it.

I would rather spit out Mambo-based products.

That's just my view. :)

They are countless things that can go wrong.. even with good specs.
For instance my impression is that you describe a near perfect scenario 
which rarely happens.

* The people who gave the specs to the consultant may be a fraction of the 
user population.

* People that interface with the consultants may not be available making 
the consultant having to do more work than planned.

* The people that gave the specs may have forgotten a key few points 
because they only occurr rarely, but yet are major showstoppers.

Even if you trust the person the risk for hourly work is still 100% on the 
customer.. What do you think the customer will do if the project is late, 
but the consultants, that they trust, keep saying it's coming along ok? 
They will likely continue.. or if this system/implementation is critical 
for the business? The customer basically may have no choice but to take 
the hit.

I don't pad excesively my bids, because then the customer may just decline 
and go with someone that will low ball the bid to just ask for more 
later..

I wish I had contracts where the work was as much as expected. :-)
The people I have done systems for are non technical or not the primary 
users that will have to do the system. The end result.. I rarely ever get 
the full picture until the project is on the way.

Although I tend to do primarily fixed price work I am learning on how to 
mitigate the risk.. but still think that there is no mid point (and again 
that's just my very biased view). The 2 main things I am doing to reduce 
risk are having a detailed list of what the project will entail AND to 
specify what is expected from the customer.

My last two projects have gone less than perfect not because I didnt' get 
the "right specs", but because the people that gave me the specs didn't 
know the entire picture.. so the "right specs" I got where not the specs 
needed by the users.. The other problem I have had is users not giving 
enough feedback or giving feedback on a timely manner.

I hope to improve my contracts to increase price if there is a problem 
with user feedback or the specs given by the contact I worked with.

I think each person needs to do what they are most confortable with.
I guess if I was better marketting I would convince my customers to pay 
hourly.. but find it easier to close the deal going fixed... :-(

:-(
I rather work for $50/hour than to work with financial firms... although I 
am doing work for one right now..

The pressure and stress from working with financial firms is more than 
long living human beings can take.. I think working for financial firms is 
a slow form of suicide.. but maybe I have just worked/dealt with the wrong 
financial firms. :-)

I need to better qualify my statement..
I was refering to risk related to money paid to the consultant(s).. ie 
whether the consultant can loose money or the company can loose the money 
paid for the work.. or overpay for the work...

There IS risk on all projects for the client outside of just the cost of the 
project. Business disruption, loosing customers because the system 
malfunctions, etc..

> It costs money to make careful, detailed specs.

That's something I am doing more of.. Ask for a fee for a detailed analysis. 
I explain to the client that whether I do the project or someone else this 
analysis will be helpfull.

My personal biggest problem has been getting to talk to the right people at 
the client side. You may be delegated to work with a small set of people or 
just and individual and that person may not understand completely what needs 
to be done.

Absolutely.

Exactly.

Not always possible if there is a budget for a project. They simply have to 
get the best person they can within the budget.

i thought safari wasnt really an ebook site since you cannot download the 
entire book (only chapters) in PDF or CHM format, you have to view them 
online... and it's not only oreilly ;) it's actually Safari which several 
people use, not only publishers ;)

safari.oreilly.com <http://safari.oreilly.com>
safari.informit.com <http://safari.informit.com>
safari.java.com <http://safari.java.com>
safari.bvdep.com <http://safari.bvdep.com>
safaribooksonline.com<http://www.safaribooksonline.com/products/individuals/it_prof.asp>

sorry had to be a smart alec and just list all the sites google found LOL

so anywhere to "legally" purchase PDF or CHM ebooks or are they all illegal?

Safari consists of more than O'Reilly. Here are some others (about half 
of the publishers who participate):

Peachpit
New Riders
Addison Wesley
Prentice Hall
Que
Sams

O'Reilly just happens to have better marketing and branding than any 
other publisher (by far). As a result, many people think Safari is owned 
and operated by O'Reilly.

Many of the other publishers have their own URLs:

http://safari.samspublishing.com/
http://safari.informit.com/

Anyway, this concludes the useless trivia of the day. :-)

Safari is not worth it if you want the downloadable chapters.

David Sklar's Learning PHP 5 book would cost you $32 to download all the 
chapters from safari, search amazon you can get it for $19.77

I've been interested in this job with Safari for a while, 
http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/j/31

I'm considering applying once I graduate. 

Those who know my employment history may see some irony in the
selection, but it sounds like a neat job.


That posting is also one of the reasons I though safari was a wholly
owned subsidry of O'Reilly/

LOL after a bit of whois research i can find out that the Name servers that 
the books.allofthem.com <http://books.allofthem.com> is
queldor.net<http://queldor.net>,
nothing is at that page, so i am assuming he registered it to use just for a 
Name Server, however if you just trail the name servers etc.. you finally 
get down to a name ;) I'm sure this may not be the end of the line but more 
digging could probably turn up more lol

Subject: [nycphp-talk] NYPHP Courses
Message-ID: <7e2c731f0506131227513ff03d@mail.gmail.com>

The NYPHP pages seem to point me here with any questions on the courses, so 
if anyone can help I'd appreciate it. Essentially I'm trying to figure out 
which course I should take, leaning towards the two-day "programmers track" 
as opposed to leaping right into one of the intensive 2-hour RAMP courses (
e.g. the February course on OOP in PHP). 

To this point, totally self-taught (with the help of some of the authors who 
frequent this very list), I've used php mainly as "glue" to automate, say, 
photo galleries and for mail forms and the like. I've written a few sites 
that included database abstraction layers to interact with small MySQL 
databases - I'm pretty comfortable with SQL, but I am having trouble getting 
a useful grasp on Classes and object-oriented php in general (I wasn't a CS 
major). I would say my comfortable vocabulary of built-in functions is 
rudimentary - I always need a reference open. On the other hand, I run my 
own linux webserver and have been using linux as my desktop for almost a 
decade and until gmail made it painfully obsolete, my main (web) email 
client was a php app I wrote.

My worry is that the two-day course is going to be too basic, though, like 
"Now we're going to write our first F-U-N-C-T-I-O-N." Can anyone give me a 
sense of the level of the course? I don't have a generous employer to pay my 
tuition; it will be coming out of my own pocket, so I want to make sure I'm 
not taking the wrong course. I do feel that I've kind of run into a wall in 
my auto-didactical regimen and could be well served by merely _talking_ with 
other people who use these tools. Lately I've set my php books aside in 
frustration, distracting myself by writing greasemonkey scripts. If it's a 
useful bit of info, web programming/designing is not my day job (yet), 
though I do make some money doing it. 

Thanks,
Chris

Hi Chris,

 

Those who have taken the course are welcome to give feedback, but for specific questions we have a form:

since we'd prefer not to clutter already busy lists.

 

Thanks,

Thanks, Hanz. 
I was reluctant to post such a question here, but wasn't fortunate enough to 
be able to find the page you posted. And also rather hoped to find input 
from people who had taken (or taught) any of the courses. I'll submit my 
question to the form.
Chris

Can anyone recommend a web freelance site that is worth while? Something 
like guru.com I guess.

I've also been seeing a lot of php related jobs on these sites.

thanks,
Aaron

Thanks, I figured my only hope was looking for jobs where people wanted 
someone local. Found a few, but haven't heard back from any.

Worth a shot eh?

I think you could look at the top level
http://newyork.craigslist.org and then check the different categories.

Also I sometimes check other sities and check by using the "telecommute" 
flag. Many of the jobs are not telecommute, but some are.

Other than the craigslist site, mentioned on another email, I have not 
foudn any other good site. Most "General" sites have too many people 
overseas that can underbid you by a long shot.. no way to compete with 
those rates while living in the US.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] RE: Sending OCI array through XML_RPC
Message-ID: <11B62D16D13187468EEF6726E13214641EBBAF@icbf-server1.icbf.com>

Hi All

 

Could anyone adivise on the best way to send the results of an OCI query
through XML_RPC ?

 

I have a server side function that queries an Oracle database and sends
the results back via XML_RPC.

I can get it to work fine for single row result set by just binding out
variables but I'm finding mult-row result sets more difficult.

 

I'm using oci_fetch_array to put the results of my SQL query into an
array.

I then want to encapusulate this and send it as normal.

 

Below is my latest attempt.

 

$idbConn = oci_new_connect(DB_USER, DB_PSWD, DB_NAME);

                        $call = "SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM mytable";

                                    

                        $Statement = @OCIParse($idbConn, $call);

                        @OCIExecute($Statement, OCI_DEFAULT);

                        

            

                        while($data_array=oci_fetch_array($Statement,
OCI_BOTH))

                        {

                                    

                                    foreach ($data_array as $key =>
$value)

                                    {

                                                $arData = new
XML_RPC_Value(array(

                                                new
XML_RPC_Value(array($key => new XML_RPC_Value($value)),

                                                 "struct")));

                                    }

 

                        }

 

                        $strucData = new
XML_RPC_Value($arData,'struct');

 

                        return new XML_RPC_Response($strucData);

 

All I get on debug is

---GOT---

Make a multi-dimensional array.  The main array contains an element for 
each row in the result, then each of those elements contains a sub array 
of the data contained in that row.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Timing out in php batch
Message-ID: <01a601c57118$e923f9d0$6501a8c0@Libby>

We are having a time out issue running in php batch mode. It was my
understanding based on the php manual that the max_execution_time
parameter in php.ini is overridden by batch and set to unlimited, yet
our application is getting the following error.

 

<b>Fatal error</b>:  Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in
<b>/home/abc/def_html/xxxxxxx/p2/prod/prodscript.php</b> on line
<b>315</b><br />

 

The process is a database OLTP oriented application so we are
'selecting' from a MySQL DB and we are you using mysqlimport to load
tables as well as insert / update / and delete processing using PEAR DB.
The process usually runs for about 45 minutes but when the machine has
other processing going on it could take up to 2 hours and occasionally
it times out :-(

 

In this particular case the code was reading a 400,000 plus record flat
ascii file to get a record count (I know we could have used 'wc -l' but
we are trying to do everything in php so we are platform and OS
independent). While this was going on another process was applying about
4.5 million transactions to database tables.

 

We have been running this code for almost a year and we do get this
error when we run a lot of scripts on the server at the same time. This
time the error message identified a specific line of code that caused
the time out but this is not consistent - it times out within other
areas of the code too.

 

Our hosted server is dedicated to us - it is a dual processor (2ghz) - 2
gig memory

The following is the output of 'uname -a' from the server ---> Linux
xxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.com 2.4.30 #2 SMP Thu May 19 12:34:10 CDT 2005 i686 i686
i386 GNU/Linux

We are running php version 4.3.10

 

Any help would be appreciated - thanks

Eric,

Try using http://php.net/set_time_limit at the top of the script to 
increase/remove the time limit.

Hello NYPHP members,

I thought I would ask your opinions on using structured programming (
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming and
http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=31001
) principles. More specifically, what are your opinions on single points
of entry and exit for functions?

For example, consider the following three code snippets:

What if you are stuck using PHP 4, and you have to use any of the
following error handling methods instead of exceptions, which one would
you choose? If so, why? Thanks in advance for reading through these
snippets!

----
Snippet 1

function make_beverage($bev_type, &$bev)
{
 if($bev_type == 'coffee')
{
		 $aw = add_cwater($bev);
		 if ( ! $aw)
		 {
		   return false;
		 }
		 $bc = brew_coffee($bev);
		 if (!$bc)
		 {
		   return false;
		 }
		 return true;
}
else if ($bev_type == 'tea')
{
		 $aw = add_twater($bev)
		 {
		   if (! $aw)
		   {
			  return false;
		   }
		 }
		 $atb = add_tea_bag($bev);
		  if ( ! $atb )
		  {
			  return false;
		  }
		  return true;
}
}
-----
Snippet

function make_beverage($bev_type, &$bev)
{
  if($bev_type == 'coffee' || $bev_type == 'tea')
 {
 	if($bev_type == 'coffee')
	{
		  $aw = add_cwater($bev);
		  if ($aw)
		  {
				   $bc = brew_coffee($bev);
				   if ($bc)
				   {
					$return = true;
				   }
				   else
				   {
				   	$return = false;
				   }
		  }
		  else
		  {
		  		$return = false;
		   }
	}
	else
	{
		  $aw = add_twater($bev)
		 
		   if ($aw)
		   {
			     $atb = add_tea_bag($bev);
				  if ( $atb )
				  {
					  $return = true;
				  }
				  else
				  {
				  	 $return = false;
				  }
		   }
		   else
		   {
		   		$return = false;
		   }
		 
	 }
    return $return;
 }
}

----
Both Snippet 1 and Snippet 2 introduce an interesting problem. $bev is
passed in by reference, and so the functions that make_beverage() call
also act on $bev, which is defined outside of make_beverage(), before
make_beverage() is called.

So, if you want to know what exactly failed, what would you do?

Would you use return codes? For example:

----
Snippet 3

function make_beverage($bev_type, &$bev)
{
 if($bev_type == 'coffee')
{
		 $aw = add_cwater($bev);
		 if ( ! $aw)
		 {
		   return -1;
		 }
		 $bc = brew_coffee($bev);
		 if (!$bc)
		 {
		   return -2;
		 }
		 return 1;
}
else if ($bev_type == 'tea')
{
		 $aw = add_twater($bev)
		 {
		   if (! $aw)
		   {
			  return -3;
		   }
		 }
		 $atb = add_tea_bag($bev);
		  if ( ! $atb )
		  {
			  return -4;
		  }
		  return 1;
}
}
----

Or would you do something like:

----
Snippet 4
function make_beverage($bev_type, &$bev, &$errs)
{
  if($bev_type == 'coffee' || $bev_type == 'tea')
 {
 	if($bev_type == 'coffee')
	{
		  $aw = add_cwater($bev);
		  if ($aw)
		  {
				   $bc = brew_coffee($bev);
				   if ($bc)
				   {
					$return = true;
				   }
				   else
				   {
				    $errs[] = 'bc';
				   	$return = false;
				   }
		  }
		  else
		  {
		  		$errs[] = 'aw';
		  		$return = false;
		   }
	}
	else
	{
		  $aw = add_twater($bev)
		 
		   if ($aw)
		   {
			     $atb = add_tea_bag($bev);
				  if ( $atb )
				  {
					  $return = true;
				  }
				  else
				  {
				  	 $errs[] = 'atb';
				  	 $return = false;
				  }
		   }
		   else
		   {
		   		  $errs[] = 'aw';
		   		  $return = false;
		   }
		  
	 }
    return $return;
 }
}

Jay:

Man, your coding style gives me a headache.  Way too much nesting, let 
alone inconsistent widths of nesting.  Then putting braces below each if 
statement makes the code take up loads of extra vertical space, so it's 
hard to see as much logic on a page.

That aside, the notion of having one exit point per function doesn't carry 
much weight in my mind.  If one reaches the end of execution, it seems 
clearest to me to actually say you've reached that point by leaving the 
function.  Otherwise, you're left wondering what else happens down in the 
rest of the function and have to go hunting, only to find out, oh, it's 
done.  What a waste.

Something I noticed in your examples is you're not handling the situation 
if $bev_type isn't coffee or tea.  I'd likely use a switch with a default 
case here.

You're assigning the returns of add_twater() and add_tea_bag() to 
variables, but the values are only used for evaluation in an if statement.  
It's more efficient to just do:

        if (!add_tea_bag($bev)) {
            return false;
        }

Now, as far as how to handle reporting of errors, that's really situation 
specific.

Here's how I'd write your function:

function make_beverage_dan($bev_type, &$bev) {
    switch ($bev_type) {
        case 'coffee':
            if (add_cwater($bev) && brew_coffee($bev)) {
                return true;
            }
            return false;

        case 'tea':
            if (add_cwater($bev) && add_tea_bag($bev)) {
                return true;
            }
            return false;

        default:
            return false;
    }
}

I notice you're passing in $bev by reference.  If that's solely to get the 
value out of the method, I tend to prefer returning the values.

But that is not the purpose of this thread - remember, this is an
intellectual exercise in Structured Programming - of course we all
would most likely put this in a switch statement, but then that
violates the concepts behind Stuctured Programming in the first place!

Yes the code is ugly, it reminds me of really bad COBOL, but it
satisfies the requirements of the exercise.

Raj, you are a better man than I, because I simply cannot do it.  ;-)

I like the consistency of it, but I prefer code that is easy to read.
As long as the exits are well-marked, I say return wherever it makes
sense.

I typically bail out of functions or methods at the top if the
arguments don't validate, rather than create a big nested block.

As for figuring out why a function returned early... well, that's why
PHP needed exceptions, isn't it? Otherwise, I'm partial to using a
console to track those things...

$log = array();
function console( $message ) {
  global $log;
  $log[] = $message;
}

function make_beverage( &$bev ) {
  $aw = add_cwater( $bev );
  if ( ! $aw) {
    console( 'make_beverage: Unable to add water.' );
    return FALSE;
  }
  // ...
  return TRUE;
}

//...

// display console messages - developers only!
print '<pre>'.implode( "\n", $log ).'</pre>';

But Jay's examples all had multiple exit points, so he wasn't using SP to 
begin with.

I agree with Dan, and I wanted to inject a little experience here. I
spent a few years doing Delphi programming and it got me into a habit of
declaring and using $result in most of my functions. Now, whereas I use
multiple-exit logic like most folks here, a $result variable does (IMHO)
lend itself to the SP method of single-exit. Perhaps this is a suitable
"hybrid" approach, if that's the correct term?

My example modified from Dan's: (I went with my habit for case syntax
 function make_beverage_cb($bev_type, &$bev) {
     $result = false;
     switch ($bev_type) {
         case ('coffee'): {
             if (add_cwater($bev) && brew_coffee($bev)) {
                 $result = true;
             } 
             break; 
         }        
         case ('tea'): {
             if (add_cwater($bev) && add_tea_bag($bev)) {
                 $result = true;

             break;

             $result = false;
             break;
         }
     }
    return $result;
 }

Hello guys,

thanks a lot for your valuable feedback! Sorry for the irregularly
spaced code Dan - I first began typing in a textarea then in JEdit.
Mangling was unintentional :-)

I often like returning when I need to do, but some believe exactly in
the opposite ...

What are the most valuable hard copy book resources that you would

* The freelancer with intermediate skill in procedural PHP 4 and MySQL 4.0 
who is looking to strengthen his/her existing technology skillset and to 
smoothly transition to PHP 5 OOP and the mysqli interface.

* The traditional C/C++ programmer beginning to develop web applications 
(and possibly begin work with relational databases).

* The veteran PHP 4/5 programmer looking to advance his/her understanding 
of UML, OOP, patterns & methodologies.

* The second-year university computer science student looking to develop a 
web application foundation (HTTP, SQL, HTML).

* The mid-career interface designer with strong XHTML, JavaScript, CSS and 
a dab of ASP/JSP scripting?

* The J2EE programmer who is migrating midsize Java applications to PHP, 
assuming the database is to remain DB2/Oracle etc.

My modification to compact things a bit:

 function make_beverage_cb($bev_type, &$bev) {
     switch ($bev_type) {
         case ('coffee'):
             $result = (add_cwater($bev) && brew_coffee($bev));
             break;
         case ('tea'):
             $result = (add_twater($bev) && add_tea_bag($bev));
             break;
         default: 
             $result = false;
             break;
     }
     return $result;
 }

If you want to stick errors in an array as the original question
asked, you can also do something like this (code off the top of my
head -- NOT TESTED):

 function make_beverage_cb($bev_type, &$bev) {
     $err = array(); // Could be passed in instead
     switch ($bev_type) {
         case ('coffee'):
             $result = ((add_cwater($bev) || (($err[] = 'aw') && false))
		     && (brew_coffee($bev) || (($err[] = 'bc') && false)));
             break;    
         case ('tea'):
             $result = ((add_twater($bev) || (($err[] = 'ac') && false))
		     && (add_tea_bag($bev) || (($err[] = 'at') && false)));
             break;
         default:
             $err[] = 'bad bev';

             break;
     }
     handle_errs($err);  // or this can be done after returning
     return $result;
 }

$err could also be an array that's passed in and handled later.

Forget the job, I want to know what everyone else is using for SOAP
services! hehe

There are several routes to take, and I'd like opinions and feedback
from folks that have implemented SOAP. What libraries are recommended,
and where are the gotchas?

Eric,

Try using http://php.net/set_time_limit at the top of the script to 
increase/remove the time limit.

According to the manual page I referenced earlier, the 
max_execution_time setting does not take into account time spent waiting 
for 'system calls using system(), stream operations, database queries, 
etc.'.  As far as I am aware the timeout will still be in effect for the 
script itself, regardless of whether it is run from the command line, 
cgi or apache module.

Please see Chuck's message on the PEAR list. The latest PEAR::SOAP is
much improved, and you should try it out.

Hi Dan - 

Can you point me to what you were reading?

Also, since we are running in batch we are running php (cli)

-bash-2.05b$ php -v
PHP 4.3.10 (cli) (built: Feb  3 2005 23:39:53)

When run in batch, the following returns "0" as documented to be
unlimited execution time
<?php
ni_get("max_execution_time");
var_dump($t);
?>

Yet, we are still timing out only when the machine is bogged down - when
run standalone the process always finishes in about 50 minutes of run
time.

Here is what I see in the manual -
 
There are certain php.ini directives which are overridden by the CLI
SAPI because they do not make sense in shell environments: 


Table 43-1. Overridden php.ini directives

Directive CLI SAPI default value Comment 
html_errors FALSE It can be quite hard to read the error message in your
shell when it's cluttered with all those meaningless HTML tags,
therefore this directive defaults to FALSE.  
implicit_flush TRUE It is desired that any output coming from print(),
echo() and friends is immediately written to the output and not cached
in any buffer. You still can use output buffering if you want to defer
or manipulate standard output.  
max_execution_time 0 (unlimited) Due to endless possibilities of using
PHP in shell environments, the maximum execution time has been set to
unlimited. Whereas applications written for the web are often executed
very quickly, shell application tend to have a much longer execution
time.  
register_argc_argv TRUE Because this setting is TRUE you will always
have access to argc (number of arguments passed to the application) and
argv (array of the actual arguments) in the CLI SAPI. 

As of PHP 4.3.0, the PHP variables $argc and $argv are registered and
filled in with the appropriate values when using the CLI SAPI. Prior to
this version, the creation of these variables behaved as they do in CGI
and MODULE versions which requires the PHP directive register_globals to
be on. Regardless of version or register_globals setting, you can always
go through either $_SERVER or $HTTP_SERVER_VARS. Example:
$_SERVER['argv'] 
 


Note: These directives cannot be initialized with another value from the
configuration file php.ini or a custom one (if specified). This is a
limitation because those default values are applied after all
configuration files have been parsed. However, their value can be
changed during runtime (which does not make sense for all of those
directives, e.g. register_argc_argv).

I was reading http://php.net/set_time_limit, based on the error message 
you are receiving.

It does appear that the time limit should not be enforced for cli 
scripts, so I guess you need to track down where the error message is 
coming from.

Does the main script call out to any other scripts or web pages running 
php which could be timing out?

[Eric Gewirtz] Not that I am aware of but it certainly does appear that
this is happening - the entire script is written in php. The script is
called from a shell script but that's it. The script is kind of like JCL
- it's running other php scripts, executing sql statements against mySQL
and invoking mySQL msqlimport - I'm thinking that maybe the sever
conection to MySQL is timing out

Head First Design Patterns. The examples are in Java, but there's
pretty much no difference between that and PHP in this context.

The PHP Anthology Series by Harry Fuecks (Sitepoint) is my fave PHP
book(s), it is readable even away from the computer. Nice coverage and
introduction to OO and patterns, too. Gets my highest recommendation.

The error message you saw was definitely from PHP's max execution time.
Are you sure you're running the script against the CLI build?  You may be 
hitting the CGI build.  I saw you tested this with php -v, but put in an

    echo php_sapi_name() . "\n";
    exit;

at the top of your prodscript.php and see what it says.  Make sure you 
invoke this test of prodscript.php the same exact way you did when the 
timeout errors came up.  Out of curiosity, when you got the timeout error, 
how were you invoking prodscript.php?  Sometimes, different means of 
invocation result in a different version of PHP being used.

Regardless, throwing in a call to set_time_limit(0) at the top of the 
script should solve the problem.

Dan,

Thanks for the info, we will try your suggestions and see what we get - 

Regarding, the questions as to how we are invoking prodscript.php, we
are executing a shell script via cron on a nightly basis. The contents
of the shell script looks like this;

Sorry for the second post - should have waited for the results and sent
everything all at once - 

We put 'echo php_sapi_name() . "\n";' at the top of the prodscript.php
script and it returned 'cli'

We will put the set_time_limit(0) in and see if this helps -
unfortunately the time out issues occurs randomly and of course when we
try to force it to happen by intentionally running a lot of processes at
one time, it does not fail :-(

Thanks again

I've gotten some strange results invoking scripts from bash shells on some hosts, but wrapping the request with env always seems to fix it:

env -i /path/to/php -q -f /path/to/script.php args > log

  Hello!

   

  We had a turnover here and need immediate assistance from a system administrator familiar with BSD/Linux, Load balancing, DNS, and other aspects of system administration.  If someone is able to fill in our gaps or even looking for full time work, get back to me immediately (like, this morning).  We'd especially appreciate your ability to get to our Englewood Cliffs, NJ office.

Eric,

Try using http://php.net/set_time_limit at the top of the script to 
increase/remove the time limit.

Adam, Chris & Mitch,

Thanks for your suggestions, I'm surprised you didn't mention your own 
books in your individual replies, though I can attest to their usefulness 
for you :)

Any recommendations from other folks?   Particularly for this audience:

Hey Guys,

if you have ever seen any training video's where people have recorded thier 
screens such as thier actions then packed it to work with quicktime or 
something like that, anyone here know how this is done? I am sure they use 
more than just one application to do this but i am not sure what they use to 
capture thier screens like they do.

I think this is largely uncharted territory.  In light of PHP 5, some Java folks would be willing to migrate, but that's only fairly recent.  For those on the list with a Java background, this would probably be a good book to write, since I haven't seen anything like it.  I do know of some cases where these types of migrations have happened, but it's largely experience that's already in house - frankly, good Java developers can pick up PHP 5 pretty quickly.

Yeah, we're registered with them, although I'm trying to remember who the point person is on that.  If someone remembers, please let yourself be heard :)

Two good screen recording applications:

Camtasia: mutliple output options, including flash, quicktime and windows
media.  Also has "full frame" capture (true video card output capture, full
motion video):
http://www.techsmith.com/products/studio/default.asp


Quaron Viewlet Builder:  only flash output, only "keyframe" images, but
works really well and is less expensive (slightly) than camtasia.  
http://www.qarbon.com/

I have used both extensively.  Viewlet builder output is very lean and fast,
but authoring can be kind of frustrating.  Camtasia is good but does not
optimize movie size like Viewlet can.

I'm surprised no one mentioned it, but I think Chris' HTTP Developer's
Handbook is great for everyone but especialy for these three groups of
developers. It really fills in a lot of gaps about the 'why' of
PHP/HTTP development that a lot of 'how-to' books leave out and that a
lot of us only find out after years of web dev.

We have a database where we store articles for a web site.  We have  
begun a project to allow another site's users to access our articles.  
I thought that best and easiest method would be to have the user  
click on a link to our database site and that link passes and  
encrypted string that contains the user's information.  Once our  
script receives the string it is de-crypted with a key and a session  
is started.  The problem I get is that the blowfish encryption is  
giving a different result than the one that is used on the ASP.NET  
server. Plus the encrypted text contains many unprintable  
characters.  How can I accomplish this so I can pass a value via a  
URL and it's compatible between different implementations of the  
encryption method.

Thanks,
John

How are you performing the encryption?

Use base64_encode() to translate the binary into printable ascii. This
increases the length of the string by about 30%. It will still need to
be urlencoded as well, but will be much shorter than urlencoding the
binary string.

I am using PEAR:Crypt:Blowfish to encrypt the string.  I will test  
the base64 encoding to see if that is the error.  What is MIME64?   
The reason I ask is that the ASP COM object has the option to encode  
into MIME64.

Thanks,

"Mastering regular expressions" by Jeffrey Fridel is the best book on
the subject that I know of, but it may be a little too advanced
depending on your CS background.

I found Mastering Regular Expressions by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl
(http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/index.html) to be an incredible
resource.  I haven't looked at it in some time (it's in NY and I haven't
been for a couple months), so I'm not sure how good it is for beginners, but
I do remember learning quite a bit from it and referring to it often.

Since the Perl regular expression library functions are really the preferred
method of using them in PHP, and because Larry, Tom and Jon do such
an outstanding job of explaining even complex topics, I would recommend
chapter 5 of Programming Perl, 3rd edition:

Pattern Matching

You can get a 14 day trial subscription to:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] How HTTP connection life relates to PHP script life
Message-ID: <1119324008.13527.236803548@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello all,

I am sorry if this message went through twice. The first time I stupidly
posted it from the wrong email address (that was not subscribed to this
list).

I have a rather interesting and multi-faceted question, but since it's
nearing my bed-time, I will try to type a few coherent lines before I
doze off at the keyboard.

Here's the deal:
Suppose you have a PHP application, which is running in the traditional
PHP way:
1) A user visits http://localhost/mailings/send_newsletter.php
2) The user selects a list, pastes in a letter, and pressed 'Submit'
3) The browser open an HTTP connection, and Apache processes the
request.
4) Apache passes the script to the PHP 4 module (not to a PHP 4 CGI
binary)
5) PHP looks up all the addresses in a MySQL table for the chosen list,
loops through them, sends an email to each person on the list. After
each message is sent, a confirmation message is echoed.

Now for the questions:
a) If a the user hits the stop button or navigates to another page, will
Apache realize that the HTTP connection has been closed and thus
terminate the script? If not, will it keep running, and if so for how
long?
b) I know this is not the best way to do it. What are your opinions on
the following method: the PHP script should invoke a command line (CLI)
script that runs as a separate process through the PHP CLI binary. That
process writes how many emails it has sent to a MySQL table or to a
file. The user's page simply META-refreshes, polls the MySQL table or
log, and says 'x messages sent, y to go'.
c) Are there any things that I am missing here?

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,

- Jay

I agree that "Mastering"  is the definitive resource, but it is written 
by someone who is really a serious regex optimizer. Whenever I need to 
know why my own regular expressions that seems to work well actually 
sucks, I can count on that book to highlight it for me. It is really 
quite hard to imagine all of the special cases that are missed by 
regular expressions.

For a PHP programmer wanting to learn regex,  I would suggest first 
challenging every apparent need for regex. Plenty of times the regex 
solution is sub-optimal compared to a PHP native solution, and with so 
many native functions available in PHP these days there is less and less 
need for loading the regex engine. Sure there are plenty of times regex 
is the right solution -- but shouldn't a good php programmer know PHP 
well enough to do make that call only when necessary?

There are arguments in favor of a standardized notation for "regular 
sets" (i.e. regex) and of course it is handy to utilize one knowledge 
base for pattern matching with grep and vim/ex and perl as well as PHP,  
but if it is pattern search/match functionality that is needed in PHP 
code I think mastery of the PHP natives will get you over most hurdles. 
Maybe you'll have more readable code with fewer missed cases, and less 
dependence on the regex engine.

In the Mambo world I use a mambot called MosTextile:

    http://www.jamboworks.com/content/view/18/40/

...which parses plain text and creates HTML output. The mambot is
really a simple wrapper for Textile, which is where the real
functionality resides.

I will never use the WYSIWYG demon again!!! Not sure if this fits your
needs or is overkill, but you may find it interesting nevertheless ;-)

I'll second that one. The "Mastering" book is the biggest and
mostest-detailedest resource, but you should approach regex as a sort
of last resort. I often spend countless hours perfecting regex, only
to have a comrade humiliate me in irc by mentioning the native PHP
function that does the exact same thing.

Hi J,

A: Once you hit submit button in any page, request is immediately sent to
Server and then Php script is executed even if you hit stop button and
navigate through other pages or do other stuffs, and since you are not on
that page you will not get any response sent back that script to your once
it's task is finished.

B: You are right sending any kind of mails more than few hundred is never a
good practice to follow, because it is almost a back end task to be
performed by any script hence keeping page open or increasing server time
out  until script sends all mails is not good option at all. So CLI script
is best option since it has not any timeout that happens while running
script through Apache and it lasts as long as you wish to perform background
tasks.

What you want to do is proper option according to my knowledge, another
similar option is to divide this functionality in 2 parts:

1: determining how many mails are to be sent based upon selection criteria
submitted by admin and determines how many mails are to be sent and display
that number to user who is running this script (please note mails will not
be sent at this moment) instantly and store that Sql criteria or part of
script in DB.

2: and next day at early morning or at same day at midnight invoke another
script by cron etc. which executes stored Sql criteria and actually sends
emails.

Thanks

There is actually a php function to set this behavior:
<http://www.php.net/ignore_user_abort>

Yes, I would agree with that idea.  Due to the nature of the web, I
always strive to return control to the user as quickly as possible, less
_hourglass_ time.  I like to do just as you are saying by decoupling the
time consuming process.

Over time I have used many techniques, invoking command in background,
Cron jobs monitoring a DB queue table, even a locally running daemon for
executing specific tasks once triggered.  Also depending on the desired
end user waiting activity, I have implemented a few different behaviors:
- Message area embedded into the framework of the site, viewable while
they click through other pages. (e.g. area saying 13 of 200 done.)
- Reporting/Updates page where they can see the progress, and possibly
be emailed when complete.
- And recently, for short tasks, I have been returning the user to a
wait page and then utilizing AJAX to update the users in realtime, very
slick.

YMMV
Flavio

I should apologize once again to Hans Z for sending my reply from the
wrong email add. Please delete the earlier reply form the non-sub'ed
email address.

Hello Anirudh and Flavio,

thanks for your detailed and well-thought-out replies. I can say without
exaggeration that the NYPHP talk list is one of the best technical
resources for programmers in existence.

I also thought of third, somewhat resouce-heavy option:
Let the user have an AJAX application, whereby the browser downloads a
list of addresses, and posts them (along with a message body) one by one
to a another script without refreshing the page. That script sends one
email at a time. This way the browser can stop and start email
dispatches at any time. I am not so sure how well this will work out in
practice though.

Any thoughts?

Best regards,

- Jay

THE easiset solution for you is to grant the remote site read privileges 
on the database and let them sort out how to authenticate the users and 
display the information.

Anyway, if you do want to pass encrypted information in the URI, here's 
how I do it:

/**

 * @link http://ftp.emini.dk/pub/php/win32/mcrypt/

 */

    return urlencode(
        base64_encode(
            mcrypt_encrypt(
                MCRYPT_BLOWFISH,
                'Your Passphrase Goes Here',
                $string,
                MCRYPT_MODE_ECB,
                mcrypt_create_iv(
                    mcrypt_get_iv_size(
                        MCRYPT_BLOWFISH,
                        MCRYPT_MODE_ECB
                    ),
                    MCRYPT_RAND
                )
            )
        )
    );
}

/**

Hey, Joseph,
You might find this little windows app useful:
http://weitz.de/regex-coach/
It's an interactive regex parser that highlights the target dynamically as 
you construct your regex. It can be help illustrate the effects of each 
added operator. Also, here's a website with a rather nice overview, even if 
it is all an extended advertisement:

I didn't need no book, I used Regex Buddy : http://www.regexbuddy.com/
It helps you to visualy build your expressions and returns language specific
(!) code...
 
Hope you like it as much as I did.

This is a quick & dirty example I slapped together for the PHP class I
teach at SCPS/NYU. It's far from bulletproof, but... HTH

Hello,

I've got code that queries the 'zipcode' tables in a database and finds the 
zips that are within X miles of Y zip code. Works fine.

<?php
	$z = new zipcode_class;
		$zips = $z->get_zips_in_range($zipcode,$distance);
		if (empty($zips))
		   { echo "Error: " . $z->last_error; }
		else { foreach ($zips as $key => $value) { echo "<b>$key</b> is 
<b>$value</b> miles from <b>$zipcode</b>.<br>"; };  }
?>

Now I want to query the 'organization' tables and return all the orgs that 
have one of the zips found above. But I'm not sure how to go about it. 
Something like the following (which I know is incorrect)?

SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE org_zip IN ($zips)

Thanks in advance for your help...I'm sure it's some very basic concept I'm 
missing.

Harvey

Almost there, the correct sintax is as follows:

$query = "SELECT * FROM `organizations` WHERE `org_zip` = '$zips'";

Bye.

AFAIK, in MySQL <=4.x you'll have to do a code-aggregation:
[PHP]
$result = array();
foreach ($zips as $key=>$val) {
  $result[] = $val;
  $rs = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE org_zip = $val");
  if(@mysql_hum_rows($rs) != 0)
    while($row = mysql_fetch_array($rs, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {
	$result[$val][] = $row;
    }
}

var_dump($result);
[/PHP]

In MySQL 5, you could do an IN SELECT or similar aggregation.

IN is a standard construct in every DB engine I can think of... IN expects a comma delimited list:

SELECT cols FROM table WHERE zip in (11111, 22222, 33333)


with PHP, you can do something like:

$zips = array(11111, 22222, 33333);
$rs = mysql_query('SELECT cols FROM table WHERE zip in ('.join(',', $zips).')');

When building sql queries dynamically, I find it very useful to store
the query in a variable first:

$sql = 'SELECT cols FROM table WHERE zip in ('.join(',', $zips).')';
$rs = mysql_query($sql);

If you have problems with the query, you can easily print it.

This also helps when you ultimately decide you want a database wrapper
and you're replacing mysql_query with something else - you can just do
a global search and replace for "mysql_query($sql)". :)

I do the same... but since I'm a lazy typist, I just cut and pasted from the prior code snippet :)

Actually, I usually include debug options to display/log SQL statements and email DB errors to myself, which are built in to my DB wrapper classes - I never use native engine-specific PHP functions.

That worked.

I just added $zippers[]=$key to the foreach loop and then used a tweak of 
your SELECT.

$query_zipsss = "SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE org_zip IN (". 
join(",",$zippers) . ")";

Thanks very much!

Hey folks,

With just a week to go, this month's meeting is rapidly approaching and it 
promises to be a great one.   Don't forget to get your RSVP in if you 
haven't yet done so.

Agenda:  http://www.nyphp.org/
RSVP:  http://www.nyphp.org/rsvp.php

Since there will be a lot of information presented and because we have a 
large virtual membership which can't always make it into Manhattan, I 
thought it would be helpful to survey the list in advance to see what 
questions or topics people would like to hear about most, even if they 
can't attend.... Essentially to help IBM match their presentation to what 
interests the varied group of developers that is NYPHP and to help get the 
most out of the time.

For example,
* After taking a look at the agenda, is there something technical you'd 
like to see covered in more detail?
* Is there any particular aspect of the Zend/IBM partnership that you'd 
like to hear more about?

Don't limit it to questions; what suggestions would you give?  E.g., 
* What parts of PHP could benefit most from IBM's involvement?
* What would you like to see IBM do or say to put your clients who are 
wary about PHP (or AMP) at ease with the technology?

And, as usual, please get the word out about the meeting on your personal 
sites, blogs, etc.   : )

Thanks in advance and see you next Tuesday,
-Dan

not sure why I'm answering this, but this seems you're doing something
in PHP you could/should be doing in the database.

the " IN (zip1, zip2, etc)" solution aint that bad, but what you
really should be doing is using one query with a join or a subselect.

for the join crowd, something like this:

select 
org.* 
from 
org, zips 
where
org.zip = zips.zip
and <zip code sql goes here>

i usually just use a rough zip code distance check using a square box.

I was debating almost the exact same question about a year ago.
I wasn't looking at such a diverse group of "php-ers" and was mostly
looking at people who don't have a university degree in computer
science.

My conclusion was that none of the books I would recommend have the
word PHP in them.

For %99 of all web developers, I think a good SQL (not mysql) book is mandatory.
I can't really say which one, but make sure it covers all aspects of
database theory and design as well as advanced queries.

One of the books would probably be a general comp sci books, depending
on what knowledge the person lacked.

The third would be about software engineering or software development
in general.
While many people are fine at actual coding, the process of creating
the software is lacking.

I'm sorry that I'm not recommending any specific books.
email me if u want to discus this more.

Ok, I surrender, you guys are top! I'm asking for help.

I have been strugling to have a clean cross reference check code in PHP
using a MySQL database.

I have a table called "CATALOG_READING" with two entries, one is the ID
(CR_ID) and the other a value.
Then I have 16 tables each with 4 rows that have a value from CR_ID, in
order to use the values from the CATALOG_READING table in different
situations.

What I need to check is which values from CR_ID are NOT USED in any of the
other tables, so I can identify and remove it.

Before you ask, CR_ID has 3900 entries and the other tables have 4*700
entries (AVG), so I can't do it by hand... :p

Thanks in advance,

SELECT c.cr_id
FROM catalog_reading AS c
LEFT JOIN table_x AS x ON x.cr_id=c.cr_id
LEFT JOIN table_y AS y ON y.cr_id=c.cr_id
LEFT JOIN table_z AS z ON z.cr_id=c.cr_id
...
WHERE x.cr_id IS NULL
AND y.cr_id IS NULL
AND z.cr_id IS NULL
...

Give something like that a shot.

Ophir,

could you recommend any books that are directed towards software engineering 
or software development? As you said most people are fine with coding but 
dont have the necessary knowledge in this area. That is me :).

I have gone through book after book and taken the zend course so PHP is not 
new to me but when i try to get into a large project i find myself lost in 
the planning stages. I know how it should work and can make it work but i am 
sure it's not going to be coded the proper way.

I have no CS background.. are there any books i could pickup to get some of 
this knowledge as well? I am looking to forward my knowledge in PHP but 
other aspects as well.

I know the easiest answer is to go to college but the largest obstacle wirh 
that is time and money. :(

Joseph-
 
if you're interested in the practice of software development, two classics
that have been highly recommended to me are:
- code complete
- mythical man month
i also would also suggest kent beck's eXtreme Programming (XP) book, as XP
practices, especially test-driven development, have been very helpful for
me.

Ophir,

could you recommend any books that are directed towards software engineering
or software development?  As you said most people are fine with coding but
dont have the necessary knowledge in this area.  That is me :).

I have gone through book after book and taken the zend course so PHP is not
new to me but when i try to get into a large project i find myself lost in
the planning stages.  I know how it should work and can make it work but i
am sure it's not going to be coded the proper way.

I have no CS background..  are there any books i could pickup to get some of
this knowledge as well?  I am looking to forward my knowledge in PHP but
other aspects as well.

I know the easiest answer is to go to college but the largest obstacle wirh
that is time and money. :(

Dan. Thanks for your tip, but it doesn't seem to work.
If i use your code, it returns me all of catalog_reading contents, meaning I
do not have any null values on my tested table.

On the other hand, if I say NOT NULL, it returns all the lines of
catalog_reading that are present on the tested table. It's nice, but not at
all what I need ;)

Any other thoughts?

Cheers

SELECT c.cr_id
FROM catalog_reading AS c
LEFT JOIN table_x AS x ON x.cr_id=c.cr_id
LEFT JOIN table_y AS y ON y.cr_id=c.cr_id
LEFT JOIN table_z AS z ON z.cr_id=c.cr_id
...
WHERE x.cr_id IS NULL
AND y.cr_id IS NULL
AND z.cr_id IS NULL
...

Give something like that a shot.

Alberto,

If you paste the exact SQL code you are executing we should be able to 
figure out where it is going wrong.

Perhaps some details on the inner workings (if different) of the IBM PHP, and what it means in terms of versions, available extensions, etc.

I'd be interested in PHP support on big iron.  And, similarly to the above, what new extensions/functionality will the partnership produce?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] compiled PHP 5.1 seg faults - gdb bt interpretation
Message-ID: <1119454996.31384.236932380@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello all,

I downloaded PHP 5.1 beta and tried to compile it with:

'./configure' '--prefix=/home/jay/php5_1' '--disable-cgi' '--enable-cli'
'--with-xml' '--with-libxml-dir=/home/jay/php/lib'
'--with-config-file-path=/home/jay/etc/php5' '--without-pear'
'--enable-debug'

PHP 5.1 (unlike PHP 5.0) seems to need libxml2.

It compiles okay, but when I do ./php --version it seg faults.

Here is the GDB output. I was hoping someone had insight into what is
causing it.

Thanks in advance,

- Jay

Hello,

I want to share with you what I have learned through
my actual work experience, I hope you?ll find it
useful.  Planning a large system should start out by a
process, referred to as (1) requirement gathering and
(2) specification writing. 

Before you write even a single piece of code you
should decide what you want the system do and how,
thoroughly and in detail.  You?ll know you?ve done
this part right when you can describe the system in
detail and complete with all the user interfaces,
again before you start coding.  When you?re writing up
your specification, based on the requirements, your
technical choices should address not only providing
for the requirements of the system today but also some
future extendibility.  For example should you require
the users login to the system?  How should you
validate the information and what should be done if
the validation goes through or does not go through. 
If you have a set of information or options that are
valid today would they always remain the same or would
you like them to change sometime in the future?

The process is almost intuitive once you develop the
right mindset.  I hope this helped.

Dan:

Although it didn't work, it drove me into reading mysql manual with another
focus, and alas, I fount it!
I will explain the problem and the solution, because it may just help
somebody else.

This is in a .org site, non-profit, and it relates to bible readings.
"catalog_reading" is the complete bible references repository for the site,
no matter what language or liturgic calendar, all the references are entered
and read from there.

Then we have country-specific liturgical calendars, like
calendar_liturgic_am for american english ;), and our problem was to know
which of the 3900+ entries on the references table was not used by any of
the daily readings on any country.
My solution was found on the manual in the UNION sintax pages, and it goes
like this:

require_once("../common/php_functions.inc"); // please notice I use my
libraries
$trans =
array('am','ar','bbn','de','default','fr','it','maa','maa_orig','nl','pl','p
t','sp','tra','trf');
if (!sql_server_connect())
	{echo "Connection error<br>";}
else
	{echo "Connected<br>";}
if (!sql_choose_db())
	{echo "Db not selected}";}
else
	{echo "Db selected<br>";}

$CR_query = "SELECT * FROM catalog_reading WHERE NOT EXISTS (";

for ($count = 0 ; $count <= 14 ; $count++)
{
	$CR_query .= "SELECT CL_FR_CRID,CL_PS_CRID,CL_SR_CRID,CL_GSP_CRID
FROM calendar_liturgic_".$trans[$count]." WHERE ";
	$CR_query .=
"calendar_liturgic_".$trans[$count].".CL_FR_CRID=catalog_reading.CR_ID OR ";
	$CR_query .=
"calendar_liturgic_".$trans[$count].".CL_PS_CRID=catalog_reading.CR_ID OR ";
	$CR_query .=
"calendar_liturgic_".$trans[$count].".CL_SR_CRID=catalog_reading.CR_ID OR ";
	$CR_query .=
"calendar_liturgic_".$trans[$count].".CL_GSP_CRID=catalog_reading.CR_ID
UNION ";
}
$CR_query = substr($CR_query,0,-7);
$CR_query .= ")";

$CR_query_result = sql_do_query($CR_query);
$CR_count = sql_count_lines($CR_query_result);

echo "lines = ".$CR_count."<br>";
while ($CR_line = sql_do_array($CR_query_result))
{
	echo "CR_ID: ".$CR_line['CR_ID']." CR_READING:
".$CR_line['CR_READING']."<br>";
}
 
Thank you, Dan and the other, for the inspiration.

I would second both of those suggestions.  Here are a few others I'm
fond of off the top of my head:
- The Pragmatic Programmer
- Coder to Developer
- Joel On Software (his book & blog)

I also just picked up Professional Software Development by the same
author as Code Complete & Rapid Dev, but haven't read it yet, but have
heard good things about it.

Learning other languages is also a good idea.  You'll find new
approaches to problems, learn other development environments and
practices that you'll pack into your toolbox and use throughout your
development career.  The Pragmatic Programmer will teach you all about
that.

HTH,
Andrew

Hi all,

I recently bought Code Complete by Steve McConnell, and found it to be
immensely useful so far.
Amazon has it:
http://tinyurl.com/byvds

Joel On Software's articles are really good too. So these two
suggestions were excellent, and I second them.

For those who want to know more about PHP 5 and OOP, I would recommend
PHP 5 Object, Patterns and Practice (Apress).
As for a general SQL book, I would recommend The Programmer's Guide to
SQL by Apress too.

Best regards,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] What does PHP use to find programs that are exec'ed?
Message-ID: <1119471802.26652.236953746@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello all,

I was wondering what the PHP 4 module of Apache uses to find programs
when using the exec() function. 
I am trying to use a script invoked through the Apache PHP 4 module to
exec() the CLI version of PHP.

For example http://localhost/test.php has:
<?php
$output = '';
$exec = '';
exec('php --help', $output, $exec);
print_r($output);
?>

I compiled PHP 4.3.x as an Apache module, but also seems to have
installed the CLI version in:
/usr/local/bin/php

The above exec call from does work. 

However, I compiled PHP 5 with: '--disable-cgi' '--enable-cli' and
copied the PHP 5 binary to /usr/bin . When I change
http://localhost/test.php to be:

<?php
$output = '';
$exec = '';
exec('/usr/bin/php5_0 --help', $output, $exec);
print_r($output);
?>

no it does not work (no output is produced).

The phpinfo() function for the PHP 4 Apache module (through which exec()
requests are being passed) has the following info for Apache's
environment variables:
PATH    /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

When as root I do:
echo $PATH 

I get:
/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin

Apache's user and group are both www-data.

So my question is:
what do I need to do to let the PHP 4 Apache module find a program so it
can exec() it?

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,

- Jay

Great thoughts.  My two cents:

I agree wholeheartedly that it's important to elicit business requirements
for what you're developing and to consider expected/potential changes that
could be required in the future when architecting a system.

I'd suggest being careful of too much "big design up front" (i.e., spending
a lot of time on architecture, especially of things that aren't immediately
required).  Usually the best approach is to try to iterate as much as
possible -- i.e., flesh out some requirements from the "customers" (usually
the business folks), develop and test the functionality that's most
important to them (not the nice-to-haves) in a short timeframe (e.g., 1-4
weeks), and then give it to them so they can use it and refine their
requirements (which usually leads to the software providing more value for
the business).

Extreme Programming, one of the agile development philosophies, stresses
trying to do the simplest thing possible when developing a feature.  Usually
the cost of refactoring something that could be architected better is less
than the cost of developing features that aren't valued or used...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Callback function in a class
Message-ID: <BEDF5753.157E1%corey@domanistudios.com>

I have a need to use a callback function from uasort within a class, and I?m
having a hard time figuring out how to pass the name of the custom sort
method in as the second parameter (it?s a string... not a reference).

For example, here the basic code structure:

class StoreLocator{

    function searchByZip($zip){
        [ some code that builds a store array ]
        
        $stores[0]['name'] = "store1";
        $stores[0]['distance'] = "3.4";
        $stores[0]['name'] = "store2";
        $stores[0]['distance'] = "5.6";
    
        uasort($stores, 'sortDistance');
        
        return $stores;
    }



    function sortDistance($a,$b){
        if($a['distance'] == $b['distance']) return 0;
        return ($a['distance'] > $b['distance']) ? 1 : -1;
    }

}


So, in the code 

uasort($stores, 'sortDistance');

doesn't work, I've also tried:

$sortDistance &= $this->sortDistance();

uasort($stores, 'sortDistance');

This technique is able to find the method sortDistance, but isn't able to
pass in the ($a, $b) arrays to sort.


The last thing I've tried is

$sortDistance &= $this->sortDistance($a, $b);

uasort($stores, 'sortDistance');

Which also doesn't work. Any ideas?

maybe it doesnt work because you have this

$stores[0]['name'] = "store1";
$stores[0]['distance'] = "3.4";
$stores[0]['name'] = "store2";
$stores[0]['distance'] = "5.6";

so when you actually pass in the $stores array it only has one element 
$stores[0]....

Yeah, I was thinking the same thing....  [0][name] and then [0][name] is going to be naming and then renaming.... but i didn't know if he had just banged this out for demonstrative purposes

       $stores[0]['name'] = "store1";
       $stores[0]['distance'] = "3.4";
       $stores[1]['name'] = "store2";
       $stores[1]['distance'] = "5.6";

Out of curiosity, why does everyone seem to use join() instead of 
implode()? I've seen it used three times in this thread alone, but maybe 
it's just a copy and paste thing. :-)

less typing? as a matter of fact, join() is just an alias of implode()...

You need:

uasort($stores,array(&$this,'sortDistance'));

You can read more about the syntax for callbacks here:

Maybe we've stumbled on the ex/closet-Perl hacker NYPHP contingent?   
I know I fit into that category and use join instead of implode.   
It's hard to break a 10 year habit. :-)

But implode sounds so much cooler!

As someone with no perl experience, I'm happy to use implode() as the
perfect compliment to explode(). There's no unjoin(), is there?

Why not simply specify the fullpath to the program... 
/usr/local/bin/my_program

Hello Francisco,

Thanks for your help.
I did try using the full path, but it did not work. It's really weird. I
thought it was a permissions or ownership issue, but the other PHP
binary which did work had 'root' as its user and 'staff' as their group,
and both had permissions of -rwxr-xr-x .

For example:
jay:/usr/bin# ls -l /usr/bin/php5_0 /usr/local/bin/php
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root staff 17327872 2005-06-22 15:52 /usr/bin/php5_0
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root staff  8492541 2005-05-24 16:38 /usr/local/bin/php

The code I used to run the exec with the full path was:

<?php
$output = '';
$exec = '';
exec('/usr/bin/php5_0 --help', $output, $exec);
if ($exec)
{
	echo 'Yes';
}
else
{
	echo 'No';
}
print_r($output);
?>

>From the shell (bash), if I do /usr/bin/php5_0 --help it outputs stuff.

I am running Debian Linux - I am not sure if a Debian quirk is at work
here (but somehow I doubt it).
Shouldn't exec() be able to run any executable on the system with a full
path, or are there some other requirements for that executable?

Maybe I am doing something dumb here, or just missing something. 

Thanks,

- Jay

Have you tried running something else?
Trying to run PHP from within PHP may be a problem in and of itself.. At 
least something to consider.

PMFJI, but I myself had no end of troubles with exec() and ended up using
backtick, something like:

$command = 'php batch_program.php';
`$command`;

For some reason exec() just never worked, and backtick did, so I did not
investigate further.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] What does PHP use to find programs that are exec'ed?
Message-ID: <1119538495.6301.237013015@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello all,

I think I figured out why it was not working. I had compiled libxml2 to
my home directory, and built the PHP binary against it.
Even thought it was installed to /usr/local/php5_0 and worked from the
bash shell, somehow when it was exec'ed by Apache, it did not work. When
I rebuilt it without libxml and only against system libraries, it
worked.

I guess I made a mistake building it against a library compiled to my
home dir.

Best regards,

- Jay

You should check out the various safe mode features.  They can restrict
such things and are possibly getting in your way:
	http://us4.php.net/features.safe-mode

Specifically you might check out open_basedir as it is not dependent on
whether safe mode is on or off IIRC.

Joe,

I learned java  and I forgot most of it, because the lack of use.
I tried to get a job in Java but never landed one because I needed
Java working experience...catch 22
But I like a book by Dietel and Dietel  <--for applications and Applets
for web programming get a book on j2ee or on JSP

I recommend "Head First Servlets & JSP" for learning Java web 
technologies.  It's technically a study guide for the Sun Certified Web 
Component Developer exam but it's excellent even if you're not after the 
cert.

http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/headservletsjsp/
http://www.wickedlysmart.com/HeadFirst/HeadFirstServlets/HeadFirstJavaServlets.html

It made it to number 3 on Amazon's 2004 "Top 10 Editors' Picks: Computers 
& Internet" list.

And if the callback method happens to be static, whether declared static
in PHP 5, or sort of de facto static in PHP 4:

uasort($stores,array(__CLASS__,'sortDistance'));

I think Java is probably a lot more fun the .NET.   Python & Ruby are
the new kids on the block. Google will turn up lots of info to get you
started.

Check out the books at B&N, and then get them for a fraction of the
price on Amazon used books.

Subscribe to an RSS feed of the del.icio.us tag for the languages(s)
you want to master. Read those links, that reading will keep you on
top of it all.

And have fun!

would suggest java.  main reason for chosing it over .NET is that there's a
LOT of helpful info out there on the net and open source projects/libraries
out there that you can utilize or learn from.  and you can get everything
you need for free (e.g., eclipse is a very helpful IDE)

I'm coming from a php and java background and would prefer dotnet to
j2ee. Reasons being...

Development time is less for dotnet.
Visual studio
MSDN
C# is not bad when compared to java

And yes.. i know this might be read by people who don't like MS
policies and platform dependencies etc ...these are my humble opinions
and i'm sure many of my friends might disagree..

It also seems like Ruby-on-rails is also good. It provides a sound
framework [where php is deficient] and ease of development like php---
but don't know how enterprises are responding to it

The MySQL error is just a warning. 

The real problem seems to be in the PDF extension...  there's a big
note on http://www.php.net/pdf about how this needs to be installed
through PEAR in 4.3.9 ... not sure what or why, but maybe that's the
first place to look?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Data encryption on ISP server
Message-ID: <42BC7E60.8090001@informationideas.com>

I have an encryption strategy question and was wondering if anyone can 
help.

There is data that I'm storing on an ISPs server that I would like to 
encrypt.  This data can be access through the hosted website via 128bit 
SSL that is username and password protected.  Therefore, the data and 
the password to access the data are all encrypted using a pass-phrase 
and AES through php. However, my concern is that where and how do I 
store this all important pass-phrase since it is the key that opens all 
doors.  My ISP does not allow the webserver process to access any 
directory outside of the www root directory so my pass-phrase needs to 
be either stored within www root (plus sub directories) or in the 
database.  If either of those places are considers secure, I would not 
need to use encryption in the first place.

My logic must be flawed as I'm certainly not the first to deal with 
encrypting sensitive information.  Where am I not thinking correctly 
other than behind my desk?  Thanks to all in advance.

Message-ID: <0MKyxe-1Dlw0x0Aac-0001p4@mrelay.perfora.net>


This seems like a silly question, and something that would be common.

When managing URLs during PHP runtime, how do you get the fragment part that comes after the hashmark?

http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php

Says it will return an array containing the fragment part, but the function also requires you to pass in the URL.  Yet, I can't find a way to get the URL that includes the fragment, so it's a chicken-before-the-egg problem.

I'm probably forgetting the function or variable that does exactly what I want, but I just can't place it.

Thanks,

H

I can't figure out any better logic that's realistic either.  Storing the pass phrase is always the conundrum of encryption.  For very secure stuff, you'd get much higher security and flexibility with a dedicated server, if possible.

I'd hope that you could at least use htaccess to restrict access to
certain files or filetypes, which would be another layer.

OTOH, if someone has a shell on that server, then the game is already
over and all your additional efforts might accomplish is buy a little
time.

On the internet, you will ALWAYS be a target. So take a little effort
to make sure you are not an attractive one :-)

Although the suggestion of dedicated hosting sounds better; here is a
possible solution:

Multifactor encryption.

You could perhaps encrypt this _all important passphrase_ with the users
password.  Then the process would be: User supplies password, this
password is then used to decrypt the master passphrase, then the
decrypted master passphrase is then used to decrypt the data in the db.

If you have multiple users, you could keep the user identification and
their version (passphrase encrypted by user password) in an un-encrypted
data store.  If they need to change their password, you could decrypt
the passphrase with their old password; encrypt passphrase with new
password and stash back in data store.

A few caveats:
1) Not as secure as dedicated hosting.
2) If the master passphrase must be changed, all users must update their
passwords.
3) New user setup would be a manual process to get the initial
(unencrypted) passphrase encrypted with their password.

*****ok, so I shot this off the top of my head so take it with a grain
of salt and a word of caution!  If there are flaws, I am sure one of the
sharp people on this list will point them out. ;)

Frank-

Not sure if it's possible with your ISP, but one option that I've seen used
in the past is requiring both server and client certificates.  If I recally
correctly, it was mostly handled through Apache and OpenSSL, although it's
been a while...

This seems like a silly question, and something that would be common.

When managing URLs during PHP runtime, how do you get the fragment part that comes after the hashmark?

http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php

Says it will return an array containing the fragment part, but the function also requires you to pass in the URL.  Yet, I can't find a way to get the URL that includes the fragment, so it's a chicken-before-the-egg problem.

I'm probably forgetting the function or variable that does exactly what I want, but I just can't place it.

Thanks,

Hy Hans.

Have you tryed to explode the url, it works for me with this little
function, which i changed for you ;)

function hashContent ($urlToBlow)
{
	$explodedUrl = explode("#", $urlToBlow); // this works because there
is only one # per url
	$reversedArray = array_reverse($explodedUrl); // because the part
you want will be at the end
	return $reversedArray[0]; // ask only the end...
} 

Hope this works for you.

http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#media-type-fragid

Interpretation of the fragment identifier is performed solely by the
agent that dereferences a URI; the fragment identifier is not passed
to other systems during the process of retrieval. This means that some
intermediaries in Web architecture (such as proxies) have no
interaction with fragment identifiers and that redirection (in HTTP
[RFC2616], for example) does not account for fragments.

As other people have already pointed out, dedicated hosting is the way
to go if you have data you need to keep secret.

The exception to this is if you have data that only needs to be
decrypted by you (or the staff of your organization), such as credit
card numbers. In that case, you can encrypt the incoming data using an
RSA public key. It can then only be decrypted with the matching
private key, which you would store locally. You could download and
decrypt the data (or upload the private key temporarily and decrypt on
the server) whenever you need to access it. But this couldn't be
automated, and your users would not be able to access the data.

No matter what scheme you use to encrypt, if the decryption key is
available on the server, and an attacker can read your application's
code, then they have access to the data. Both these conditions are, in
theory, true on any shared server.

I like this idea in theory, and it might be an excellent solution for
medium-security data. But let's play with it.

If the passkey for decrypting the data is itself encrypted using the
user's password, and the user's password is not stored on the server
(only an md5 or sha1 hash is kept for verification), then this is safe
-- provided a realitvely strong password is used.

But that's a good thing. If just anyone could come along a register as
a new user, then an attacker with shell access could just register and
then use his password to decrypt the passphrase, game over.

So for a limited userbase with known-strong passwords, this could
indeed be a workable solution. There's every possibility that we're
overlooking something, though.

This is true. 

You don't get to know the anchor identifier server-side, sorry.

Maybe you could use a javascript hack?

I guess you are right, it's not really a caveat (more like a feature ;).
 It also wouldn't need to be as manual as I first thought.  The person
with the Authorization to create accounts would be able to encrypt the
new users first password during setup seeing as they all ready have the
un-encrypted db passphrase (from their password.)

I sometimes use a sort of poor man's shared server security: php-cgiwrap,
and set permissions as restrictively as possible. Obviously you don't get
to run PHP as an Apache module, but -- unless I am mistaken -- your
scripts and data files should be no less secure than your shell account
itself.

Well heck - that covers it.  So, when rewriting URLs - for paging for example - there's no way to keep the fragment.

I suppose, if it really mattered so much, someone could write a JS snippet that would call ahead to the web server, which would track via the user's session, but that's a lot of work just for a fragment.

All of sudden my mail client won't reply with only selected text. Then 
I accidentally deleted the original post. I can't blame some people for 
hating computers. . . anyway. . .PHPBeans. . .

Presumably, if you have a need for a distributed system, you want some 
scalable, reliable way to access remote information.

For instance, you need to get information from the accounting 
departments system before you approve this customer's transaction.

if it were a third party vendor, most likely they would expose this 
remote call as a web service(using SOAP etc), or maybe since Java has a 
lot of clout they might only support Enterprise Java Beans.

But I guess if you are doing it internally, you might say "I love PHP 
so much, I'm going to make this distributed transaction an end to end 
PHP deal."

With Enterprise Java Beans, you presumably get to write beans that run 
inside the EJB container and all you have to worry about is 
implementing the basics and the container will handle security, 
reliability and a mess of other things, so the developer doesn't have 
to worry about it.

Also, with EJB, you theoretically should be able to write a bean that 
works in any EJB compliant container, meaning you could move from 
vendor to vendor.

I can't say whether PHPBeans is successfully modeling this type of 
system, but it looks to be what they are after.

thanks for this explanation. So Java and PHP beans are just another way to

as Group Manager of one of the IT Groups here BAE Systems in the
Performance Based Solutions (PBS) area.

I'm currently faced with a problem that is NOT directly code-related,
but someone out there may be able to help me none-the-less.  You folk
are one of the places I've always turned to help solve my technical
issues... so you were the first place I thought to bounce this current
dilemma off of.

I currently on the hook to find a Visual Basic Programmer with .NET
experience for one of our contracts.  I'm looking for a Visual Basic
person who is familiar with all facets of the software lifecycle and
could come up to speed quickly on a project that I am helping to staff.
The need is immediate.

 

You can find out some more information here:

 

http://careers.na.baesystems.com/cgi-bin/prjps/req_ViewJobs.cfm?id=2&rn=
211515&start=1&searchtype=A

 

Or call me at either of the numbers below.  I need to find someone
immediately, as this project is currently understaffed.  If you don't
feel you are the right one for this position, please let me know if you
are aware of anyone else who might have the necessary qualifications.


Thank you.  You may now return to your regularly scheduled NYPHP

Dear all,

I'm not sure if I'm at the right place to ask, but one of my PHP UG 
Colleagues -- Aaron Wormus .. here in Frankfurt (Germany) suggested to 
me that your group is using a 64bit machine and maybe encountered the 
same problem as I have.

If I'm completely wrong - I say sorry - but I would appreciate a hint to 
whom to write...

The problem:
I try on a 64bit SuSE 9.3 to compile PHP5 --with-oci8-instant-client 
support. Oracle doesn't provide 64bit version of the instant client.

Therefor the compilation fails because of incompatibilities even after 
some modifications in the oracle files (see php.net/oic.8 annotations).
My idea was to compile php as 32bit binarie by providing

export CC='gcc -m32'

to the build process. But with these parameter the other extsenions (the 
one based on libxml2 for example) doesn't work any more.

I work for 4 days on this issue and I'm quite frustrated.

BTW the compilation with the Oracle Client from a Database install 
doen't work either with 64bit even if I'm using the 64bit Version of 
Oracle 9 (i.e. --with-oci8).

I'm thankful for every hint and suggestion.

All the best from Germany

Thanks to all for your input on this topic.  I guess the consensus is to 
use a dedicated server to properly secure the data.  One thing that I'm 
not clear about is specifically how does a dedicated server provide more 
security?  My first instinct is that I can write a compiled object such 
as a DLL to handle the encryption/decryption.  Then I could have the 
pass-phrase broken up into multiple pieces stored in different locations 
(maybe files outside of the web tree and databases) where only the DLL 
has the instructions to reconstruct the pass-phrase.  The pass-phrase 
would also include something that is unique to the server like the MAC 
ADDRESS so if everything is installed on another computer without 
recompiling the DLL, the encryption/decryption would fail. This would 
allow the following scenarios of security.

1) Compromised database - data is encrypted
2) Compromised file system and database - no code with decryption info 
in files and data is encrypted
3) Compromised file system (including DLL) and database - cannot read 
compiled DLL, no code with decryption info in files, and data is encrypted

Is this kind of what you have in mind while stating that dedicated 
servers can be secure enough for sensitive data?  Thanks.

Well, this is a tough problem.  The original 64bit problem I had was trying to get PHP to compile on a box (either Fedora or SuSE) that had *only* 64 bit libs (/usr/lib64 and /lib64).  PHP 5's ./configure had /lib and /usr/lib hardwired.  The only solution is to use PHP 5.1 (right now, beta 2).  Which version are you using?

Mixing 32bit and 64bit libraries is asking for trouble.  Try version 5.1 of PHP with the 64bit Oracle libs.  When compiling, you need to supply --with-libdir=lib64

And an important gotcha:  if you have both 32bit and 64bit libraries installed on a system, PHP will default to using the 32 bit libs (/lib and /usr/lib), resulting in what's basically a 32bit build.  You need to use the new --with-libdir to force a 64bit build.

And, this all of course assumes a 32/64 hybrid system (like Opteron) and not something like Itanium.

Reto, I assume you mean the x86_64 version of SuSE?

> I work for 4 days on this issue and I'm quite frustrated.

Since you've been working for a while on this, why don't you test running 
the 32-bit version of SuSE on this system as a fallback?   I ran into 
similar problems on an Intel Xeon EM64T system (x86_64) trying to get PHP 
working with some IBM libraries and that was how I eventually got it to 
work.

My original problem was here:

Doosn't work too...

That was new to me -- thanks.

It is a dual XEON.. And SuSE installs a BiArch (43nit/64bit).

When compiling against Oracle Instant Client (32bit) it results in a 
linker problem (I think it is one):

/usr/lib64/gcc-lib/x86_64-suse-linux/3.3.5/../../../../x86_64-suse-linux/bin/ld: 
skipping incompatible /opt/instantclient10_1//libclntsh.so when 
searching for -lclntsh

/usr/lib64/gcc-lib/x86_64-suse-linux/3.3.5/../../../../x86_64-suse-linux/bin/ld: 
cannot find -lclntsh

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

make: *** [sapi/cgi/php] Error 1

But I have no clue about such things. Maybe someone else knows about 
such things...



I found a workaround but I'm unhappy with it. I'll post in my next 
answer to Daniel Krook because it fits theamtical...

Bye for now and thanks again for your support

Silly question, but how can I force a 32bit installation during setup on 
64bit machine?

I tested a 32bit Suse 9.3 in VMWare on my development machine and php5 
compilation --with-oracle-instant-client worked like a charm. ONly 
little hassle but everything is documented.

> similar problems on an Intel Xeon EM64T system (x86_64) trying to get PHP

As mentioned in my last answer to Hans I found a workaround but I'm not 
happy with it... And I will try to replace it as soon as poosible 
provided that I get the intended soultion to compile...

Or I have to wait until Oracle releases the instant client for Linux x86_64.

I installed XAMPP from Apachefriends instead of all the SuSE things and 
the oci8-Extension works with the oracle client installation. It is a 
cheap trick but for now I can't help myself in another way...

Thanks again for your help.

Bye

Use the 32bit installation CDs/ISOs.  It will ask you at the beginning of 
the installation if you really want to do it, but will proceed normally 
after that.

looking at the errata, i thought there was something wrong with thier --$a 
but then i thought maybe it was just the font they used didnt space them 
enough ;)

anyone know how i go about submitting these corrections?

I'm way in over my head with most of this thread, but ... a XEON (dual 
or not) is a 32-bit machine. I thought. Could this be right?

I'm pretty sure it is 64bit as the specs are telling so.

And Suse installs a biarch version of Linux (x86_32/x86_64).

Heh, not only that, but for an official study guide, I felt it was a bit
off the mark in places (it shouldn't be your only study guide.)
Defiantly review the PHP manual (<http://www.php.net/docs.php>).

Although there were questions on the exam that weren't covered in either
of these places...

The reason we tend to think that dedicated servers are safer is that
at the system level, any decryption key or suid program that can be
run by the webserver on a shared box can be run by anybody else who
can script that webserver. If "nobody" can run it, I can run it.

We all know that isn't the end of the story, and that you can build
fences that keep users on shared hosts from getting into each others'
business. A properly configured shared host at an ISP is likely to be
more secure than a Linux box managed by a part-time sysadmin.

But removing other users from the picture reduces the risk, and the
number of hoops you have to go through to protect things. I mean,
write and compile a binary so it can be suid? It's a lot easier to
just run a script as root.

Greetings to the List,

I thought I recognized the above error message until I saw that Line 247 was
simply the trailing tag to <?php, i.e., ?>.  There was no ";" on that line,
and a review of neighboring code did not reveal anything out of order.

Has anybody seen this type of behavior before?

My appreciation in advance.

The missing ";" is from further up in the code. It doesn't complain
about it until the closing ?> because it isn't sure until then that
you aren't going to provide it.

So could someone please clarify what is true?  Does
PHP support <% %> and <script language="php">and
</script>.  I tried <% %> and it didn't work.   So I
just figured that there was an error in that paragraph
and left at that.

Thanks again for the insight.  That makes sense to me now.  It is easier 
to secure data on a dedicated server and not that a shared server can 
never be as secure as a dedicated server.  Now is time to convince the 
client to splurge on a dedicated server.

PHP does infact support them both, it doesnt support the ASP style tags by 
default you have to enable them in the php.ini <% %>

Hi Leila,

You probably need to enable asp_tags in php.ini!

Look for:
asp_tags = Off

Sounds like there is an extra ';' where it isn't supposed to be.  It can
be re-produced with the following code:

<?php

class foo
{
	;
}

?>

Php supports <? ?> but with apache you can change it to accept <% %> or some other way
:-)

So could someone please clarify what is true?  Does
PHP support <% %> and <script language="php">and
</script>.  I tried <% %> and it didn't work.   So I
just figured that there was an error in that paragraph
and left at that.

Nestor,

PHP supports all 4 ways i showed above, nothing you need to do to PHP, 
except the asp tags you have to enable in the php.ini file

But is it good practice?  I think I remember reading
somewhere that developers should stay away from ASP
like tags.  Personally I don't think I will be using
that tag but it is good to know it's a valid tag.  I'm
really grateful to be getting so much good information
from the members of this list.  To continue on a
related note, I have used <?= ?> which is similar to a
JSP tag and found it to be very useful.

yea the certification guide said to stay away from that tag if you are going 
to use mixed technologies but i dont see why the ASP engine would execute a 
PHP file... I suppose if you accidentally named it .asp you would have 
problems.

Bitwise operators are easy, and if you use *nix you use them all the 
time in the form of file permissions.

Basically any integer can be represented in binary form:

1   0001
2   0010
3   0011
4   0100
5   0101
6   0110
7   0111
8   1000

etc.

Bitwise operators simply operate on the binary representation of a 
number, one bit at a time, eg:

1 & 3 = 1

   0001
& 0011
= 0001

3 | 6 = 7

   0011
| 0110
= 0111

I usually get that error when there is an extra ';' in my code. I find that 
error extremely unhelpful, and threw me off greatly when I was first 
starting. I understand why they do it (as previously mentioned), however I 
feel they should reconsider the message if possible.

ahh dan is a binary head ;)

yea i understand how they work i guess what i dont understand is how the 
programmer is supposed to know how to convert a decimal to binary and do the 
shift math in thier head to program fast at all :)

basically i need to know how to make an integer into binary.

If you don't want to do it all yourself by hand as a learning exercise (or
whatever), you might like http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.decbin.php

Incidentally, I welcomed Joe's first comment in this thread --
essentially, "I don't know from bits" -- because neither do I, really. (-:
It seems you can program PHP for years without (knowingly) shifting any
bits.

My thanks to the following who responded to my call for help:

 

Flavio - I tested your code and reproduced the same error message.

 

Brian - The extra ";" is the prime suspect, but two visual reviews have not
surfaced the problem.

 

Jeff - I suspect you are right about the missing (or extra) ";" further up
the code.  That makes sense.

 

Joseph - The suspects have been narrowed with the help of Flavio, Brian and
Jeff, but the problem is still unresolved.  What is the best way to send the
code - attachment or paste into e-mail?

 

Phil

Hmm, I guess not. 

Lively meeting, no? But even in light of the take-home moment ("Now you know 
what we know. So what?") I though it was interesting to see that IBM used 
the same methodology I used last time I looked for a CMS (troll boards, 
google search) and made the same decision, mambo. I thought I was just 
wallowing in my own ignorance. Turns out I'm top corporate caliber!

The way I usually find it is through Zend, but I'm assuming you're not using 
Zend, or another editor with the red underlining on errors. My only 
suggestion would be to do a search for a ';;' (two semi-colors), or try out 
Zend :D

Good luck.

Agreed, the only time I ever encountered a need for understanding bits and 
bitwise operators was the Sun Java Programmer 1.4 exam (and they're 
apparently no longer included on the 5.0/1.5 exam).   I had a good grasp 
of them for the time I was studying, but before and since I've rarely used 
them.  Like Joe, I wasn't a computer science major so I never had to learn 
them from an academic point of view either. 

I seem to recall that this article came in handy for getting a grasp on 
binary, and from there the bitwise operators:

"Learning Binary and Hexadecimal"
http://codeproject.com/tips/binhex.asp

So, to pose a new question on the value of learning about bitwise 
operators, what would you use them for in a standard web application?  ACL 
determination?  What else?

I've done it accidentally twice, although that was a while ago with 
much older laptops. No harm done, but newer laptops do have tighter 
tolerances.

I do remember reading an article a long, long time ago regarding 
floppies going through x-ray. No harm the first 3-4 times, but the more 
the floppies went through the more they degraded. So I wouldn't make a 
habit of it.

Oh wait, I thought you were talking about x-ray. The stories I've heard 
about airport security screening it is most definitely hazardous. Like 
the FBI agent who was allowed to take his gun, but not his nail file.

I utilize bit functions for flag handling and simple ACL in the same
fashion as the built error reporting
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php>

for example:
define( 'D_VIEW_FORTUNE',     ( 1 << 0 ) ); // 00000001
define( 'D_VIEW_LAST_LOGIN',  ( 1 << 1 ) ); // 00000010
define( 'D_VIEW_LOGIN_COUNT', ( 1 << 2 ) ); // 00000100
...
// Normally dynamically set for each user
$display_view = D_VIEW_FORTUNE | D_VIEW_LOGIN_COUNT; // 00000101
...
if( $display_view & D_VIEW_FORTUNE )
{
    // display fortune
}
...

I will also use them as an efficient way to detect every other row ;)

    $i = 0;
    while( ... )
    {
        if( ++$i&1 ) // Row is odd;
    }

Brian,

 

I did a Find Next on ";;" and found nothing, then a Find Next on ";" and
likewise found nothing suspicious.  I am using Macromedia's Dreamweaver
editor, which offers PHP editing with syntax coloring, but it did not
complain when I introduced the ";;" error.  I sense that this editor was not
designed for PHP but simply offers PHP editing as an add-on.  I'll
investigate Zend.  Thanks for the tip.

 

Phil

For PHP, I suggest the PEAR standard. 
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php

I don't know any standards for MySQL.

Same here. I sweated over bits in preparation for that very exam.  There
was just one itty-bitty question (sorry), and it was easy. I wonder how
many Qs there are about them on the PHP exam.

not sure but in the first chapter of the test book it asks about << so i

binary used for is in this tutorial

if you scroll to the bottom he shows a user permission example

Phil,
 
I use Dreamweaver as well for php.  For certain syntax errors that it
catches, it displays the closing php tag (?>) in a lighter color to tell
you something is missing or added.  Maybe a missing or extra parenthesis
or bracket, or a missing or extra semi colon.  If the file is not too
large, just paste it into an email, and I will take a look.

Years ago (back in the '80s), hardware was expensive.  Memory and disk
storage were at a premium.  When we wrote programs, we kept efficiency
in mind.  Using bits to set/clear flags, we could get 8 flags using only
one byte of storage.  Today it seems ridiculous to do things like that,
when a boolean variable will do, but at that time computers were slow
and expensive.  I don't see as much value to bit operations today as I
did in the past.

I utilize bit functions for flag handling and simple ACL in the same
fashion as the built error reporting
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php>

for example:
define( 'D_VIEW_FORTUNE',     ( 1 << 0 ) ); // 00000001
define( 'D_VIEW_LAST_LOGIN',  ( 1 << 1 ) ); // 00000010
define( 'D_VIEW_LOGIN_COUNT', ( 1 << 2 ) ); // 00000100
...
// Normally dynamically set for each user
$display_view = D_VIEW_FORTUNE | D_VIEW_LOGIN_COUNT; // 00000101 ... if(
$display_view & D_VIEW_FORTUNE ) {
    // display fortune
}
...

I will also use them as an efficient way to detect every other row ;)

    $i = 0;
    while( ... )
    {
        if( ++$i&1 ) // Row is odd;
    }

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Seagull Framework
Message-ID: <1120054134.31939.237409876@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi all,

In light of last night's presentation by the IBM folks on PHP
frameworks, CMS'es and application integration, I thought I would
mention Seagull.

I tried out its latest version, and I was very, very impressed. Even
though it's billed as a framework, it comes out-of-the-box with an
awesome installer, sample data, and sample applications. It builds on a
lot of PEAR libraries, by extending and improving them. In many ways, it
is like a very, very well-written, easily-extensible version of
PHP-Nuke.

http://seagull.phpkitchen.com/?ref=phpkitchen

It is distinctly PHPish in flavor, without trying to be port of a Java
framework such as struts. But it really seems to work, and in the brief
moments I spent looking at the code, it seems well thought out, and well
written. I have not looked at it that deeply yet, but so far I am
impressed.

I think this is the first PHP framework that I would actually use, and
actively recommend to others. It does not re-invent the wheel - instead
it builds on work others have done, and well.

Let me know what you all think.

- Jay

Although I do agree that you can do everything without using bit
operations, and a few bitwise operators here and there are not going to
make your code ultra fast.  I still see value in using them.

Clean Code:
In the example I demonstrated, I find it actually keeps the code simple,
clean, and easy to read.  For example, If I was to track those flag
values as booleans, I would want to aggregate them all in another data
structure such as an array or object.  With this comes more code and
complexity.

Speed:
Php is parsed at runtime (aside from code accelerators/caching).  Even
if you have a fast processor(s), there still is alot that happens every
time a php script is requested.  If you can replace arrays of options
with a few bitwise operators, it may not be much, but it's gotta do
something. ;)

Just my opinion.

Er, maybe. A common trick to obtain a new laptop is for 2 people to
get on line, one go through with no problem, and one 'forget' to remove
change, etc from their pockets. You put your laptop on the belt, it goes 
through, and you are stuck behind the guy ringing the bell. By time you
get through, your laptop is missing.

*Hang ON* to your laptop until you walk through the portal.

I used to be a big fan of masks and bits.   But you're absolutely right that they've lost a lot of use.  One of the few places they're still seen regularly is in IP addresses and netmasks.  That said, of course, if this was New York Embedded Systems or New York Assembler, instead of New York PHP, we'd probably have a different viewpoint.

I do still use them at times in PHP, especially for flags.  For instance, they can be real handy - and REAL fast - for storing multiple values in a single column.


define('USER_ATTRIB_SU', 1024);
define('USER_ATTRIB_BAN', 2048);


mysql_query("INSERT INTO UserTable (UserID,Attributes)
             VALUES ('500','".USER_ATTRIB_SU."')",$MYDB);


mysql_query("UPDATE UserTable
                SET Attributes = Attributes | '".USER_ATTRIB_BAN."'           
              WHERE UserID='500'",$MYDB);


/*** Now get all users that are super users ***/

mysql_query("SELECT UserID FROM UserTable
              WHERE Attributes & '".USER_ATTRIB_SU."' = '".USER_ATTRIB_SU."'",$MYDB);

http://www.vipan.com/htdocs/bitwisehelp.html

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/bit-functions.html


There's an elegance to using them that is nice, instead of StudelyCaps and <TAG>Verbose Tags</TAG>

Rolan,

I am getting close to determining if my investment in Seagull was
worthwhile.  I can tell you that the community associated with a framework
is a very important part of the decision, and I am thoroughly impressed with
the Seagull community.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Question about frameworks
Message-ID: <5458518f05062911426d817674@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

In light of today's discussions about frameworks I think now is a good time 
for me to ask a question that's prevented me from using frameworks in the 
past and doing everything the "straight PHP" way:

It seems that all of the frameworks I've run across are somehow tied to 
CMS's. In my mind, and perhaps wrongly, this limits their usefulness to 
creating CMS software. What about people who are creating other type of 
software? And does it also mean that one has to install a complete CMS just 
to have acess to the API's? This seems like a lot of overkill to me.

Perhaps, and probably, I am wrong. I am very eager to work with a framework 
since they really seem to eliminate a lot of work. Can anyone tae a little 
time to shed some light on these issues for me?

Thanks!

I think the tie in is simply because, at the end of the day, when you
are done designing coding and testing (the part that the framework is
most useful for), most php applications will need to spit out
html/images/etc (content) which warrants the need for an
html/images/etc (content) management system of some kind...

I'd say install/try out the framework and ignore as much of the CMS as
you need to, to get your app done. The benefits of reusing the
framework code and the inherent coding methods will be an improvement
from coding the straight PHP way.

As a side note, where I can get some more info on OOP in PHP5? :)  Is 
there a nice book or tutorial for people who already know PHP but not much 
OOP?

I actually use geocoder.us commercially ... the service is nice.  We have 
a deal currently.  For people looking to host their own DB, the census 
data is publically available.... if you can mingle your own DB, then you 
can do an unlimited amount of queries.

Just my two cents.  The people over at geocoder are very nice though. 
What exactly is your purpose?

Very good. Hadn't thunked of that.

Of course the question is...why would someone bother to sprinkle this
throughout their code. 

For example:

function O1en($l1eh          ) {
	$this->O1ds=$l1eh["t\171\160e"];
	$this->O1dh= (int) $l1eh["i\144"];
	$this->l1dt= (int) $l1eh["\143\151d"];
	$this->l1ey=    (double) $l1eh["\167e\151g\150t"];
}

That's the octal way of writing these characters. See
