Message-ID: <1212360238.3873@coral.he.net>

Hi Everyone --

I'm almost there with my PDF download application and everything is 
working great except that instead of downloading the PDF, it's printing 
it out on the screen like so:@8(??r?;q??7?L??y??&?Q??q?4?j???|?9??

Here is the code that I have right now...something is wrong.  At one 
point I got it to give me the file save/download dialogue box but with 
the pagename not the filename...

//=======

$filename="333.pdf";
$filesize=filesize($filename);
header("Content-Type: application/pdf");
    header("Content-Length: ".$filesize);
    header("Content-Disposition: inline; filename=$filename");
    header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");
$file_contents = readfile($filename);
print $file_contents;

Check the error log. Its possible something in your code above that
smippet (perhaps in an include file) is sending body text and you are
not seeing the error.

Your problem is that you're actually outputting the PDF content twice.
readfile() actually reads the file into the output buffer, so it's the
equivalent of:

echo file_get_contents($file);

See http://us2.php.net/readfile

Well, despite the thread hijack I'll answer. First off a few questions. Did 
you ever design a database for any other application? Did you ever code 
something in PHP that went beyond some basic input verification, did something 
more than put out a static page, and worked in the end? I don't want to sound 
cross, but your question is like calling up Car Talk and asking the guys "I 
want to design and build my own car from scratch. How do I do that?". I'm just 
guessing here, but I assume that your experience with coding and database 
design is not that great. So maybe you want to download and use a CMS 
forwhatever you want to do and start with something that is less complex.

Great answer. Anyone can build a go-cart, but if you want to build a
BMW from scratch you need to get a serious education and a precision
machine shop first.

I think your first step is to define what a CMS is, at least for your 
purposes, and why the existing open source wheels need to be reinvented 
again.  From an ERD perspective, I'd design the data store to be 
polymorphic which the application would aggregate as a set of nodes 
defining a blog article, a comment, a forum post, etc.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] GUI for SOAP/WSDL 
Message-ID: <48459EDE.6090901@polymerdb.org>

Hi Gang,

Maybe I've just got GUI on the brain from Jake's post today 
(http://lists.lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2008-June/025909.html -- 
unbelievabl), but here's my question:

I'm looking for a GUI tool (PHP or otherwise, web-based or otherwise) 
that will help me understand a WSDL spec without actually reading the 
file.  Docs are pretty sparse on the service I'm using, and I've waded 
through many lines of WSDL trying to see what elements are required, the 
name of various methods, etc.  The kind of tool I'm looking for would 
parse a WSDL file and then show me a list of available methods, and for 
each method the required elements, then maybe even prepare the raw SOAP 
request for me (though I can't really imagine needing to see the raw 
SOAP request).  Yeah, sure, that's what I get from wading through the 
WSDL, but something a lot more streamlined would be a big step up.

Any hints or clues from the NYPHP gang?

(BTW, googling for words like WSDL GUI didn't seem like it was going in 
the right direction...)

Thanks,
Allen

Forgot to mention the ideal feature here would be for the tool to 
prompt  me for the method parameters, then send the request and display 
the response.  What I'm trying to accomplish is not only understanding a 
given service better, but trying it here and there without having to 
type a bunch of code just for a one-off trial request.

Thanks,
A.

CMS is just a term for fancy text editor.  I would check around to see  
if you can just find an off the shelf product and play with it.  There  
is usually no reason to reinvent the wheel unless it is going to  
outperform your current competitors.  Drupal (my current punching bag)  
can take a beating and then some and is flexible enough to allow you  
to customize it to your content.  Now I don't want to discourage you  
from learning about the inner workings of a fancy text editor because  
it is good knowledge to have but keep in mind that the time you spend  
reinventing the wheel could be spent improving the current wheel which  
is already stable and works (and has a good support base).

Hi Jake,

Yep, that's a pretty cool thing.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to 
support session headers, which this particular service requires (login 
first, then include the sessionid in the session header of subsequent 
requests).

Guess I'll keep looking.  If this were Open Source I'd hack it to 
support session headers and then contribute the mods, but I'm not so 
sure if I want to try and create such a thing from scratch.  Seems like 
a big task.

Anyway, thanks for the lead.  In general, a good tool to know about.

That's exactly what it is - a text editor or data entry application 
with edit/publish states.  And determining the data to be displayed on 
the front end and designing data entry forms and writing insert strings 
is the easy part...the hard part is the edit/preview functionality and 
determining the edit states needed and how to design the database to 
best handle that.

I inherited a half-finished CMS project and learned A LOT about how to 
design it and how NOT to design it -- but I would not recommend that 
method to the fainthearted!!

That depends. I am still working on my picture and video viewer and archiving 
system. Of course I could have just downloaded one. The goal is to learn 
something more than just click a link. I am convinced that my system isn't 
winning any awards and it doesn't outperform its competition (although jamming 
800 pictures into the system in 5 minutes in one go is sweet), but that wasn't 
the point.
So maybe a simple CMS could have a few tables and as input front-end the 
FCKEditor and then some code that generates output. But I don't know what the 
intentions are of the original poster. It sounded more like "I need a CMS, go 
and program one for me, I'm waiting."

Eclipse has a pretty nice GUI for this.  You can visually create and edit 
WSDL. 

There's a recent developerWorks tutorial that shows how to work with these 
types of files using Eclipse and the PDT:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MSSQL, PDO & Unicode
Message-ID: <4846B7D3.1020705@projectskyline.com>

Hello All,

So, here's the issue I'm stuck against:

We are currently developing on Linux and then deploying to Test, Staging 
and Production on Windows.

We are using the Zend framework, with the PDO driver. (config.ini: 
database.adapter = "pdo_mssql").

The original issue is that when storing XML fields the pdo driver was 
failing to select the "unicode" data from MSSQL.
Here's the error:

Warning: PDOStatement::execute()
       [function.PDOStatement-execute]: message: Unicode data in a 
Unicode-only collation or ntext data
          cannot be sent to clients using DB-Library (such as ISQL) or 
ODBC version 3.7 or earlier. (severity 16)

To fix this, we store the XML in a MSSQL TEXT field. Well, it turns out, 
our client doesn't like that ... they want the ability
to xpath the data.

We returned the field to 'XML' and created a 'view' in MSSQL that cast 
the XML to TEXT. So, now my application selects from the Views,
which works great. However, since the field is now computed (via the 
cast) I am unable to INSERT/UPDATE into it.

I thought, well maybe I can have the selects (fetchAll(), fetchRow()) 
access the VIEW and the Updates/Inserts (insert(), update()) access the 
base table (w/the XML field).
So, I could provide my own implementation to the Zend DB Table Abstract 
insert() and update() methods. Instead of having, say protected $_name = 
'whatever', my models could have another variable named $_viewName = 
'viewWhatever';

However, after looking into that, it doesn't seem too simple. Those 
methods actually pass in a db object, not a table name (like fetchAll() 
and fetchRow()). So programmaticaly, it appears easier to override the 
implementation of fetchAll() and fetchRow().

Lets pretend we can't do that. Another option would be to use Stored 
Procedures. But since my application is already written with ORM/Zend DB 
Table Abstract...that would be a real PITA.

Our client also won't let us provide THEM a view...so keep the fields as 
TEXT for our application and have a VIEW that cast from TEXT to XML (not 
sure if you can even do this) so then they can XPATH to their hearts 
content.

So, I decided that there must be an better driver to use ...  is there?

Does anyone have a solution ?

One of my coworkers just suggested having two fields, TEXT and XML, and 
using a SQLSERVER trigger to keep them up to date.

..Thanks ya'll!!!!!

- Ben

Your problems will magically go away if you use php on windows. The
freetds driver that linux uses and I assume your linux odbc driver
either uses or stole code from has issues with certain things like
varchar above 255. Check the freeTDS website for details. The
microsoft odbc driver just works, and it works great.

Also, two columns will increase rowsize. since were talking large
strings and not ints, guids or the like this will be a big issue.

HI Selyah

This is a bit interesting..i think for rendering 3D objects on web there are
some technologies like flash, .Net enable you to some extent .
other possibility could be to uploading the  video content of the
animation/rendering.

I'm a visual artist not a coder.  I dabble in PHP.  I haven't looked  
in a while but I have not really found an good easy to understand and  
use 3D rendering program.  You might find one of those but not all or  
them.  That said you might rather look to find someone to do this part  
of the project for you and use your own talents where they make you  
the most profit.  I'll hire a coder if I need one because my talent  
and knowledge base is better suited for other things.

Good Luck,

Paul Guba

About 10 years ago VRML was a hot buzzword. Do a search for "vrml java 
viewer" to find some 3d rendering applets.
As far as I know, VRML is a "standard" so you should be able to find a 
utility to port your 3dstudio or autocad objects into VRML.
I was conflicted about replying to this message because subject is quite 
off topic . Perhaps it would be more appropriate to move it to a lower 
bandwidth list like "front-end"?

Does Google Sketchup count?

I've heard it's pretty easy to use. You can embed the output in Google
Earth, but I don't know you can embed the output in a web page other
than as a screenshot.

Did you try the PDO odbc driver. also do you have the latest mssql
server driver.

Or you can also try:
http://pecl.php.net/package/PDO_DBLIB. That might have a newer FreeTDS lib.

Really though find out what the latest FreeTDS can handle before
trying any non odbc driver for sql server on php. After all, any open
source mssql server interface is probably based on freetds.

Hello Justin,

A few weeks ago I build the driver for linux and got it working.

My problems are w/the pdo driver it self, not being able to work correctly.
Also that and Zend doesn't have a SQLSERVER driver (besides pdo).

Ben,

Ah I see. The send framework has a wrapper around that you are using,
and the ODBC support is not fully functional. At least that's what I
gather from Jira:
http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-905

That being said, since the mssql PDO driver uses FreeTDS, I'd spend
some time researching the ability to use xml columns with freetds as
everything rides on that.

Justin,

FreeTDS is a library that allows Linux to talk to mssql. Ben needs this 
to work on a production Windows environment, so FreeTDS has nothing to 
do with the solution.

Justin,

FreeTDS is a library that allows Linux to talk to mssql. Ben needs his 
app to work on a production server that runs Windows, so FreeTDS has 
nothing to do with the solution, unfortunately.

Google Sketchup does indeed have a pretty easy interface.  I recommend 
it as well.

There's also an open source 3d App called blender:
http://www.blender.org/

 From WikiPedia: "Blender has a robust feature set similar in scope and 
depth to other high-end 3D software such as Softimage|XSI 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softimage_XSI>, Cinema 4D 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_4D>, 3ds Max 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3ds_Max>, Lightwave 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightwave> and Maya 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_%28software%29>"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)

I'm not sure what your needs are, but this could be a reason to get 
creative and break some ground.  If you search for "3d engine canvas" 
(sans quotes), you'll find quite a few blog posts, samples and examples 
of people writing 3d engines in javascript meant to draw to the canvas 
tag, which should work in most modern browsers.

Canvas Tag:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_tag

Here's one I found particularly intriguing:
http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas3dtexture_0.2/


Good luck!

Mark

HI Selyah

This is a bit interesting..i think for rendering 3D objects on web there are some technologies like flash, .Net enable you to some extent?.
other?possibility?could be to uploading the ?video content of the animation/rendering.

Does Google Sketchup count?
http://sketchup.google.com/

I've heard it's pretty easy to use. You can embed the output in Google
Earth, but I don't know you can embed the output in a web page other
than as a screenshot.

Message-ID: <1212618748.7375@coral.he.net>

Hi everyone, this is probably something really dumb that I am missing, 
but I need help.  This code upon submit calls this error trapping 
function (to test for duplicate usernames).  There is a hidden field 
named "step" that has a value of "1".
It is working on another page but I am trying to use this code and 
apparently leaving something out?  

Thanks for any help.  


$step = isset($_POST['step']) ? $_POST['step'] : 0;
$username = isset($_POST['username']) ? $_POST['username'] : '';
$error = '';

switch ($step)	
	{
	case 0;	// do nothing, drop through and get user data
	break;
	
	case 1:	// the user has submitted data, now check it.

//if ($error =='')
	//	{					
		$query = "SELECT * FROM Providers WHERE 
username='$username' ";
		echo $query; 
		$result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());	
	
		$myrow = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
		
		if (!empty($myrow))
			{
			$error =  "Sorry, this username is already 
taken";
			}
	//	}
//break;
}

Dave,

I think I've been making false assumptions for a couple of years now.
I always thought that the mssql_foo() functions and the mssql pdo
functions used FreeTDS even on windows. I can't find a definite answer
online so can you point out a source that confirms I am correct or
incorrect in my assumption.

Ben,

Assuming I am incorrect I have to say sorry I'm of no help in this regard.

Well, despite the thread hijack I'll answer. First off a few questions. Did 
you ever design a database for any other application? Did you ever code 
something in PHP that went beyond some basic input verification, did something 
more than put out a static page, and worked in the end? I don't want to sound 
cross, but your question is like calling up Car Talk and asking the guys "I 
want to design and build my own car from scratch. How do I do that?". I'm just 
guessing here, but I assume that your experience with coding and database 
design is not that great. So maybe you want to download and use a CMS 
forwhatever you want to do and start with something that is less complex.

David

Hello Justin,

Yeah, as far as I can tell, Dave is correct. The source I built was for 
linux. I don't see if building for windows. (But I haven't tried)

Thanks though for your feedback.

I'm hoping someone can provide some additional help.

This is REAL problem, because we worked hard to get PHP accepted as a 
development language for enterprise applications
by our client. And now we are having all these problems.

Its a fact that our client's requirements is that we use SQL-SERVER, and 
with Zend And PHP on windows, this is proving
to have many limitations. Its a real shame that Zend hasn't improved the 
pdo or offer something other than pdo for windows/linux.

I'm not a windows/ms user, but our clients are.

Anyways, incase anyone wants to know how I've temporarily solved this 
problem.

Basetable:
...
XmlContent
TextContent

View:
...
TextContent

All my controllers point to my View table. Whenever the TextContent 
field is updated, a SQLSERVER trigger is run
that updates the basetable's XmlContent field.

Its kinda hacky, but it works.

- Ben

PS: Its silly that Zend does a SELECT * for fetchAll() and fetchRow(). 
You should be able to override w/a list of fields (I dont want to write 
my own SQL).

Hi Humayoo,

That certainly sounds like a very big question.  But there are some 
second-language / translation / communication issues here as well, so 
maybe I can assume your question is as innocent as, "Hi. I'm really new 
at this but thought a simple CMS system might be an interesting learning 
project for me.  Can anyone recommend some beginner-level resources that 
touch on CMS design?"

In answer to *that* question, I would recommend something like _PHP and 
MySQL Web Development_, by Luke Welling and Laura Thomson.  Very 
beginner-oriented I thought (it starts off with a section called "PHP 
Crash Course"), and contains a section (30 pages out of 800 in the book) 
on "Building a Content Management System".  Might be useful for you. 

Good luck learning  --  don't forget to learn the basics as you go 
along.  Also, this article will be /very/ useful for you as you go along 
learning.  Bookmark it and refer to it now and then; you'll learn a lot:

All the best,
Allen

HELP!!!!!

I am going crazy trying to figure a problem.

I have an existing code that I wrote and it works(miracle!)
and I am porting it from php 4.1 to php 5.1

I just realized that my $_SESSION  array is empty on php 5.1

Did something changed?  What am I missing?

Thanks,

The better question is how do you build it currently?  Without that I  
can't figure out how it might be breaking.  Also don't forget to call  
session_start(); otherwise $_SESSION won't resume where it left off.

Hi!

I found that calling session_start() before doing anything else seems to be 
the only way to make that work reliably. I make sure that it is the first 
thing a script executes.

Also, just as a test, add this at the top of the script
<pre>
<?php
session_start();
print_r($_SESSION);
exit;
?>
</pre>

If that doesn't show any results something is really wrong and you may want to 
take a look at the error logs. If you are looking for specific keys, did you 
write anything to the session? And watch out for typos. I can't tell you how 
often I was about to jump behind a bus just because I missed a friggin "n" or "e".

I understand this.  Like I said it is not working on PHP 5.1.
I do the session_start()
and then I put the session_id() into my $_SESSION['mysession'];

The problem is that my $_SESSION['mysession'] is empty on php 5.1
when it was not in php 4.1.

Apparently a logs of people where having this problim according to this
link:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16263

I am reading the above link to see what the answer to the problem is.
I was hoping that some one on this list had seen this problem and
knows the answer.

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

You wouldn't happen to have a custom session handler object?

What are the session settings you get from phpinfo()?

Out of curiosity, why do you store the session ID in the session array when 
session_id() will give you what you are looking for? And then, what does 
session_id() produce? If that is an empty value then $_SESSION['mysession'] 
will be empty as well.

The answers boil down to two things:
1. Check where the session files are written to and make sure that PHP has 
full access to that place and that nothing else wipes those files out.
2. Use this:
<?php
session_start();
header("Cache-control: private");

I use sessions extensively in my projects and didn't find that there is any 
issue. I do set the cache control.

To answer the last 3 postings

I get the session_id() and save it in $_SESSION['mysession']
then in every page I compare them if not the same then I send the user back
to
the login page:
  if($_SESSION['mysession'] != session_id() ){
     // redirect to the HR admin page
     header("Location:/login.php");
  }

The redirect works!!!

YES!    $_SESSION['mysession'] is empty,  the session information is
disappearing
from one page to the other.

When i do a phpinfo() I do not have any $_SESSION variables;

My previous system's php:
PHP 4.3.9 (cgi) (built: Nov 24 2004 08:48:16)
session variables work

My new system's php:
PHP 5.1.6 (cli) (built: Jan 15 2008 04:57:50)
session variables do not work

There's a section in the phpinfo() output called session.

Compare those sections between the two php versions.  If you don't  
see anything obvious, post at least the php5 config here, and maybe  
we'll see something.

It sounds to me like wherever PHP5 is trying to save session files on  
disk is not writable, but it could be any number of things.

Are you doing a session_start()?

How can I check to see that the problem is that the session files are
writable
to the disk?  How do I catch the error?
my session.path.save points to /var/lib/php/session

Thanks,

Can you post the session section from php_info() ... it might give some clues.

Do this to see what's in the $_SESSION variable.

<?php
print "<pre>";
print_r($_SESSION);
print "<pre>";
?>

Well that is clearly a problem.  Can you post the header section?  It
also seems strange that your posted version is (cli); that doesn't
make much sense if you want a webserver.  This is clearly an
install/build issue.  Please provide some info on the platform and
distro and how you installed.

phpinfo() and the below code does not show any session info.

I can see the session_id() in mu login page before I call the next php
page.  Then I look at the session info on the second page there is not
session info.
Remember this code I wrote about 3 years ago and it works on my other
linux system running RHEL 3/apache 1.39/php 4.3.2/
my new linux system is RHEL 5.1/apache 2/php 5.1

The login page set mysession id
the second page checks the session ids and  redirects to login page if no
match

This is the output oh my header_list before just before redirecting to the
login
page:
array(4) {

Interesting that the SESSION data is not there but I can the
HTTP_COOKIE PHPSESSID=ttl1fo7uv30sq4hbi8fkq4v683

which just happens to be my session_id().

Still no SESSION section

:-(

You can attach the HTML or even zip it up and then attach it. Or just post the 
sections asked for.

I assume you are testing with a simple page like

<?php
session_start();
echo ++$_SESSION['foo'];

The number should increase on every refresh.  Does it just print 1
every time?  Are there files in /tmp that look like
"sess324afd9asd91874ea"?  Delete your cookies and refresh the page and
check for a cookie like: PHPSESSID=324afd9asd91874ea ?

The session variables are empty.  The save path is /tmp
I do see the PHPSESSID on the phpinfo page.

It has to do with the php.ini set up but  except for the differences I
mentioned
on a previous email I do not see much differences.

I will try it on a small page like you mentioned.

:-)

I tested the same small program on my other server and the value
changes everytime.

PHP works on both the old an the new system

What should I check that I might be missing on one system compare to the
other
so I can pass SESSION information.

Remeber my old system is RHEL 3/apache 1.39/ php 4.3.2  <-- WORKS
New system is RHEL 5.1/ apache 2.2.3/  php 5.1.6  <-- DOES NOT WORK

FOUND THE PROBLEM!!!!

In the php.ini file there was an extra double quote '"'
I found it by a miracle while I was going line by line
on the php.ini file.  I do not know how it got there.

as soon as I removed it then I restarted the service for httpd and it is
working.

I can go home know ................


Thanks to all for your help!!!!   :-)

Hi Humayoo,

Here are two books that take you through the use of PHP and MySQL. Both end with a section about creating a CMS.

How to Do Everything with PHP & MySQL

CMS Chapter 30pp

PHP 5/MySql Programming for the absolute beginner

Here is a link to a free all in one installation package that contains everything you need to work on your local machine:
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

"XAMPP is an easy to install Apache distribution containing MySQL, PHP and Perl."
It uses minimal system resources and there are versions for the following OS's:

    Well, despite the thread hijack I'll answer. First off a few questions. Did 
    you ever design a database for any other application? Did you ever code 
    something in PHP that went beyond some basic input verification, did something 
    more than put out a static page, and worked in the end? I don't want to sound 
    cross, but your question is like calling up Car Talk and asking the guys "I 
    want to design and build my own car from scratch. How do I do that?". I'm just 
    guessing here, but I assume that your experience with coding and database 
    design is not that great. So maybe you want to download and use a CMS 
    forwhatever you want to do and start with something that is less complex.

Justin,

http://www.freetds.org/ says: "FreeTDS is a set of libraries for Unix 
and Linux that allows your programs to natively talk to Microsoft SQL 
Server and Sybase databases."

I've only developed a few things using mssql, but i'm sure that FreeTDS 
is only unix/linux.

Hi all,
does anyone have any experience with amazon ec2 cloud?..
It sounds cheap and like the next best thing since sliced bread.. Has 
anyone tried this beyond a dev environment?

With PHP code of course..


thanks!

I don't have anything in production running on EC2, but I am
considering migrating to it soon.

I tried it in 2006, and voted against it because it seemed impossible
to make SSL work because there were no static ip addresses.  This
changed in March 08 with the release of "elastic ip", and I have now
been playing with it again.  It is now a ton easier to get up and
running on EC2 than it was in 2006 because there are a lot more
pre-built images and online help/tutorials courtesy of the
blogosphere.

I do use S3 to serve static content for a production site, and I have
been extremely pleased with the quality of the service.

So is this the wave of the future then?  Is dedicated infrastructure going 
to go away?  Or only be around for high performance stuff like database

Not likely, right now 1829 UTC 20080606 amazon.com itself is 503, that 
tends to leech confidence out of the system.

EC2 rocks, except for the part where there is no per-instance
persistent storage. You have to build a scheme that backs everything
up to S3 or some other external store in case your instance goes away.
Apparently they are working on that, though.

I see the value in having dedicated infrastructure for development and
some core services, and then surrounding that with cloud or grid
services for redundancy and geographic diversity.

If you trust Amazon enough to store _everything_ there, then you don't
need physical servers. I doubt that most organizations will trust them
to that extent, as EC2 is a pretty juicy target for attackers at this
point.

Meh ... It's an MVC framework.  The controller and view stuff is  
alright.  The Model concept works but is a little frustrating at times.

Give yourself plenty of time to play with it and "do things the cake  
way".

Oh, and use the 1.2 branch, even though it's only just now at RC1.

I don't have anything in production on it, but have played with it
considerably.  It's Xen virtualization.  I've built images, done the
provisioning dance, configuration, etc.  And talked with their product
manager about some new functionality that they need to make it a realistic
hosting platform.

> With PHP code of course..

Their provisioning system is all Java that I think hits a XML web service,
but of course this could be tweaked.  The web service looked
straightforward, but I didn't spend the time developing any code for it.

The biggest problem I had with it is price.  It comes out to about
$230/month for the base package, and that doesn't even include storage or
bandwidth.  For that type of money, I'd rather have dedicated servers at a
top-tier provider.

The other issue is accounting of usage.  Long story short, it's quite
difficult to accurately which VM is using how much resources.  When
providing hosting, then, this makes it difficult to set prices accordingly.
This is what I discussed with their product manager, and I'm apparently not
the first to bring this up with him.

>From speaking with him, it certainly is a interesting service, and at some
point, probably will be the wave of the future.  However, I got a very
"experimental" feel from him.  This perhaps is highlighted by their SLA and
some recent - and significant - outage problems.  At the end of the day, the
price point just didn't make sense and I'm focused back to good old regular
hosting.

+1 on this one. There are some good improvements in 1.2 that make life
a lot easier.

If I were to start a project and had to choose a PHP-based MVC
framework, it would be a dead heat between CakePHP and Symfony.

...or $72 if you do the math right. It's $0.10 per hour.

Bandwidth is $0.10 - $0.17 per GB.

It actually compares well to most VPS plans.

Yeah, I also got a feel of "beta" from this... It does seem cool though.
One thing i heard about it, is that all the ip's they use are published 
in various spam blacklists by Amazon themselves - for obvious reasons.
So if i wanted to send out any kind of email, id have to outsource it..

Thanks to all who replied!

Im going to try them out, and post if i find anything really 
interesting/cool/sucky about them..

Honestly I'm kind of getting bored with the battles, so I'm going to  
do as much letting-the-code-speak-for-itself as possible, in order to  
say this: Symfony is a great framework if you really like Java.    
Compare:

http://book.cakephp.org/view/335/create-a-posts-controller

to

http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_0/06-Inside-the-Controller-Layer

On configuration:

http://book.cakephp.org/view/39/configuration
(only sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.3.2 are required reading)

vs.

http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_0/05-Configuring-Symfony

Just throwing that out there.  Hope it helps.

P.S.  Mitch, what the heck are you doing these days?  We should grab a  
beer or something.

    Hi all,
    does anyone have any experience with amazon ec2 cloud?..
    It sounds cheap and like the next best thing since sliced bread.. Has 
    anyone tried this beyond a dev environment?

    With PHP code of course..

Yeah... I was just talking about this with Larry.  I'm also not  
convinced EC2 is the best thing for hosting pubic web applications at  
this time.  There are hosting companies out there like Larry's that  
provide Xen virtual servers which have a lot of the same advantages as  
EC2 instances, but at a lower monthly cost.

EC2 seems a bit more appropriate for batch and parallel computing in  
short bursts.  For example, anytime you upload a video to S3... you  
could fire up an EC2 instance with an image that has software to  
convert the video into multiple formats/sizes and then place the  
results back on S3 (there's the Amazon SQS service to assist with  
batch processing).  If you don't upload any videos for 10 days, you  
don't have to pay anything.  If you upload 20 videos at once, you  
could potentially start 20 EC2 instances and get the whole job done  
very quickly (20 is the default max for an account... you can raise  
your limit via a special request).

Then there's the stuff that NYTimes has been doing with EC2.  Pretty  
cool:

How much static content?  Large files only... or have you tried  
serving, say, all the images, static html, css, javascript, etc?  I  
seem to remember hearing reports early on that it wasn't necessarily  
the best performance for serving your 2k background png.  It obviously  
works well for stuff like media, photo archives, etc.  But I'm  
wondering if you could use it to really offset the number of requests  
and load from your web server.  Serving static content from apache  
running php is a waste of resources... but I'm wondering if offloading  
it to S3 would be better (or at least cheaper and not too much slower/ 
reliable) than maintaining your own dedicated server for static content.

Thanks,
Rob

I just wanted to take a moment to compliment the NY Times for their
apparently ceaseless commitment to getting the NY Times content online
and then tirelessly ramping in new media delivery styles (slideshows,
inline videos, interactive multilayered charts, flash movies and
presentations, RSS, My Times, etc.), so that the reading of the NY Times
online has actually become a noteworthy and meaningful experience.

For what it is worth, I stopped reading the paper NY Times probably 7
years ago. I get almost all my news from the web and secondly TV. My
radio consumption is also pretty much zero. I do still glance at several
print magazines that I like, but consistently turn to their online
presence as much as possible to actually get some reading done. I don't
have a Kindle, but my personal consumption of downloadable PDFs (maps
and guides, advertising, educational material, user manuals, forms) and
other eBooks has climbed hugely in the last two years.  

But, I must admit that the vast and teeming sprawl of the NY Times
online has, it seems, now even exceeded the sprawl of the Sunday NY
Times print edition (the NY Times online Home Page is 2 feet deep every
single day). Personally, I did not think that would ever happen (and I
got to admit, I stopped reading papers because of their ungainly sprawl
and was lured to web news portals for the better, faster, stronger [<<<
see Kanye West http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZd1Js0QaOI] info
consumption online offered). For expediency, I find myself turning to
other news sites that deliver actually less news but they are somehow
more rapidly, even more literally optically scan-able and digestible.
The evolving triple, quadruple and quintuple sets of intermeshed
vertical and horizontal menu layers at the NY Times online have left me
somewhat put off.

I believe that the NY Times online is one of many elegant living
laboratories of the evolving transfer of serious information
distribution to the web paradigm and it is disclosing that intricacy and
complexity is the norm not the exception. 

But I do think that an as yet unharnessed technique for
compressing/organizing/speeding delivery of online news presentation
(tags, clouds, etc) is yet to come to the fore. 

Personally, I think if before starting any web delivery
task/project/site we first thought how can we optimize this delivery as
if this info was only going to appear in a mobile or ultracompact
format, then we might have a fighting chance of improvising and
reconforming the now totally normal, sprawling, high-bandwidth info wall
of web and presenting it more ingeniously with a smaller faster tighter
delivery format. 

Reflecting on this further, I note that I feel real comfortable and in
control on Amazon.com (despite that they are also retrieving and
presenting millions of units of data) and feel much less in control on
the NY Times site.  

That is all, of course, for what it is worth.

I read the NY Times briefly some years ago and while I think it is a good 
paper it is just too much and lacks, but explainably so, any local coverage. 
And the local papers have 2 pages of local news, a dismal coverage of world 
news, and the rest goes for baseball coverage.
I do, too, get most of my news input from the web as well as WAMC. I have the 
option to read several european papers who publish in German and most of the 
time their reports put a totally different spin on things, which balances the 
typically one sided spin of the US media. What is interesting is how they 
provide their articles. Many have for the Web2.0 age very bland page layouts 
and all put the main navigation at the top and the more detailed navigation on 
the right and typically go easy on images. See, most people in Germany have to 
pay for online time by the minute, others have contracts that limit the amount 
of data downloaded, and then there is still the large portion of people with 
dial-up. Most use the enterprise CMS from Six (www.six.de), a PHP based system.
In general, I think it isn't so much as to what you want to put out on a page, 
but what the audience is most likely able to receive. That is why YouTube has 
videos of often crappy video quality as that makes for smaller files that load 
faster and are an option for folks with dial-up as well.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] comparing arrays to build query?
Message-ID: <1212891730.12890@coral.he.net>

OK, this really has me flummoxed.  I'm not sure if I'm going about this 
the right way.

I have three tables, an Employer table, a Provider table and a Jobs 
table.  Each Provider (worker) has up to nine zip codes and a possible 
metro area which contains all the zip codes in their city which is 
their "service area".

When they log on, I need to display only the Jobs in any of their zip 
codes. 

In the Jobs table, there is a remote zip field (remzip) and if that has 
a value, that is the zip where the job is, otherwise we use the zip 
field in the Employers table.

I've built two arrays one by 
"SELECT * FROM Providers INNER JOIN Employers ON Jobs.empid = 
Employers.EmpID ";

which gives me both the remzip and zip fields and the jobid field.

And one by querying the database for all the zips in the service area 
of that particular Provider and dumping them all into an array.

So now I have these two arrays I can compare...is there an easier way 
to do this or ... ?

I need to compare these two arrays and if any value from array 2 is in 
array 1, pull out the entire row by jobid from the database and display 
it.

Thanks in advance,
---- Kristina

The easiest thing would be to always populate the zip code in the Jobs 
table.  Don't call it "remote zip", call it "job zip" and populate it when 
you create the job whether it's the same as the employer's zip or not.


SELECT * From Jobs INNER JOIN Employees ON (Employees.EmployeeID = 
$EmployeeID) AND ((Employees.zip1 = Jobs.jobzip) OR (Employees.zip2 = 
Jobs.jobzip) OR (Employees.zip3 = Jobs.jobzip))

or let's say you want to show the employer too...

SELECT * FROM Jobs INNER JOIN Employees ON ((Employees.EmployeeID = 
$EmployeeID) AND ((Employees.zip1 = Jobs.jobzip) OR (Employees.zip2 = 
Jobs.jobzip) OR (Employees.zip3 = Jobs.jobzip))) LEFT JOIN Employers ON 
(Jobs.EmpID = Employers.EmpID)


Now, you can still do it in one query even if you don't change the job zip 
code as I suggested above - you'll have to sub-select the zip from the 
employer table, left as an exercise for the reader...

As a general rule, if you can make the database do your mix and matching, I 
prefer to do it there rather than in arrays.  In 99% percent of cases the 
database will happily give you exactly what you need if you just ask it 
nicely.

I think I didn't explain correctly --  the remote zip and the 
employer's zip are two different values, if a job is in a different 
location from where the employer lives then that field will be 
populated.  This would be a ton easier if they were the same value or 
if I had the luxury of redoing the database structure, which I do not 
at this stage of the game (right before deploy).

If anyone has any suggestions, thanks!

I'd go down the path you thought about. I find doing things in code often 
easier and less complex than crafting some tricked out SQL. SQL may be faster 
than code, but that is just my guess. If it is that shortly before deploying 
I'd stick with something that works and that you understand. You do not have 
the time left to try things and evaluate the one approach over the other over 
time. And if you know what is happening then it is much easier to troubleshoot 
and potentially optimize later. I rather work with code that I trust, even if 
it is not the best solution on the planet.

David -- exactly.  With the deadlines I face and pressure from clients 
to "get things done now", it's unfortunate that I rarely have time to 
do anything the "best way possible"...there's always a better way to do 
it but the client won't wait while I sit there and toy with it for 
another week.  This pressure leads me to have to hack things together 
any way I can find that works effectively, and also leads me, when I 
start feeling extreme time pressure, to post questions on occasion that 
I should have and often do figure out are easy and simple and I 
shouldn't have posted (luckily I think this is not one of those silly 
ones).

I would dearly love to modify the database structure as the previous 
replier suggested, but doing that at a late stage of the game always 
leads to consequences of some sort.

I'm thinking we should start a thread about work/life balance on here :)
I'd do it except I won't have a day off until next Sunday!

That's definitely a bit of a Web2.0 design trend - present less info  
per page, use common/simple layouts to make the page easy to digest,  
use large fonts/forms, etc.

I've found that often though when there's numerous people that you  
have to please (and you don't have the final say in the matter)... the  
original simple intent keeps getting more items added, ads thrown in,  
etc.  I wouldn't be surprised if this is the case with the NYTimes.   
You can see that every single department and partner seems to demand  
their little slice of the homepage.

So you have an array of zips, like array(11201, 11206, 11301), right?  
and you need to find all the jobs within that array of zips?

If so your query would look something like this:

mysql_query('SELECT * FROM Providers INNER JOIN Employers ON Jobs.empid = 
Employers.EmpID WHERE Jobs.zip IN (' . implode(',', $aZips) . ')');

Which becomes 
SELECT * FROM Providers INNER JOIN Employers ON Jobs.empid = 
Employers.EmpID WHERE Jobs.zip IN (11201,11206,11301)

Not sure if that's what you're looking for.

that's really really close to what I need ... except that I first have 
to test for if Jobs.remzip is empty and if so, query on Employers.zip 
instead.

This sounds like it might be a task for that Coalesce function we were 
discussing a few months back?

As long as the array implodes before the client implodes, this might 
work :) Thanks Mark

We are using it for static photos and videos.  The main benefit is
that it is cheap and we don't have to worry about space limitations or
bandwidth headaches.  I wouldn't recommend it for css images,
javascript, and static html for two reasons:
1) It requires 3-5 extra DNS queries, so first load will be slow.
2) There is no suitable way to gzip.

Since we buy a lot of adwords clicks, first load performance is
crucial.  I have mirrored all of the css images and javascript onto
S3, and I can flip the switch if needed, but for now we are only using
it for photos and videos.

Well, despite the thread hijack I'll answer. First off a few questions. Did 
you ever design a database for any other application? Did you ever code 
something in PHP that went beyond some basic input verification, did something 
more than put out a static page, and worked in the end? I don't want to sound 
cross, but your question is like calling up Car Talk and asking the guys "I 
want to design and build my own car from scratch. How do I do that?". I'm just 
guessing here, but I assume that your experience with coding and database 
design is not that great. So maybe you want to download and use a CMS 
forwhatever you want to do and start with something that is less complex.

In order to learn how to use Joomla you don't need to know every field in the 
database.

Did you look at the database itself in MySQL and see if there are any comments 
or descriptions? Maybe there is a Joomla expert on NYPHP, but if you can't get 
that information from the joomla forum or developer network, then asking 
others has less of a chance. Also, did you see if there is any documentation 
that comes with the source code?

Yeah, I think many people may not know the difference.

Humayoo: what he means is, be sure to *create a new email* when you want 
to change the topic, instead of hitting "reply" and then changing the 
subject line.  Doing it the wrong way will screw up certain features in 
people's email software when they're reading your message.

This didn't not work. I use 1and1 and they have setup the sendmail and I 
found the sendmail path is /usr/sbin/sendmail

so I set sendmail_path = '/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -t'; This doesn't work 
either - below is the snippet of code.
================================================================
$headers = 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion();
sendmail_path = '/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -t';

Hi Paul,

It looks like you need to add quotes around the items in the mail function
even though they're variables.

This works for me, I receive an email when someone contacts me from a web
form:
mail ("joe-nyphp at joeschmittjr.com", "Contact the web master",
"$message_body", "From: {$_POST['email']}");

Try a simple one (see below), then add variables:
mail ("YourEmailAddress at test.com", "Test Title", "Test Message", "From:
TestSender at test.com");

From ps at sun-code.com  Wed Jun 11 06:24:18 2008

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP LinkedIn 
Message-ID: <000001c8cbad$4f044600$ed0cd200$@com>

Offline, someone wrote to me directly and posed the question(s): Why
have more Connections of LinkedIn? Why use a LinkedIn
compared/contrasted to a mailing list?

I thought that my thoughts were actually worth posting here. 

LinkedIn, Jigsaw, HotJobs, Monster, Dice, MySpace, Facebook, yahoo,
google, Adobe, IBM, Oracle... -- evidence of the success and integration
of the [social] networking aspect of using the Internet to get something
done is evident everywhere.

I don?t think that LinkedIn itself, is everyone's answer -- but what
LinkedIn represents on the Internet is important. 

Even if you don't want to ever use LinkedIn yourself, understanding it
more fully (for say dispassionate professional purposes) by taking an
opportunity to precisely examine the tools of LinkedIn and what the
potential benefits and advantages there are to using them robustly is
well worth the time. For example, LinkedIn has embedded within the
structure professional Q&A/advice-style internal mailing lists too.
Also, all communications on LinkedIn can be public or private,
professional or personal (essentially online or offline, so to speak)
without going out of the interface or needing to state that you are
going private or off list, or using multiple email addresses. One,
technically, doesn't even need email addresses. One more just uses the
right tool/technique for the communication job. 

I believe that what LinkedIn is and how LinkedIn works (and how it even
came to be) is closely meshed with the expansion and growth of the
Internet/Web 2.0 way of life and doing business. I would posit that it
is highly probable that in the future more and more groups/associations
will be more like a LinkedIn or [social] networks from the get go. (In
fact, it would seem, that future is already here. First thing college
kids join is Facebook. Then other local specialized [social] networks.)

I would proactively support the aggressive spread of PHP professionals
(individually and formally as a Group) into LinkedIn territory since
yesterday. Many already have. 

Warmest regards, 
?

Hi Paul,

You want to make sure you're analyzing the situation in detail, looking 
for evidence that will indicate the source of the problem.  That is, 
avoid trial-and-error debugging in which you change some code, run it, 
and then just wait to see if the email comes or not.  At this point 
(that is, since you're asking for help on it) you should be beyond 
trial-and-error.

For example:
- check the return value of the mail() function.  I believe it returns a 
boolean based on success or failure. (Check the manual to be sure.)
- can you get access to the apache error logs, which might contain some 
information about an error?

I also assume you have asked your hosting provider for help on this?  If 
you have, their reply might offer some clues to people here who want to 
help you.  And you've scoured their documentation for references to 
sendmail and php?  It's possible they have some specific requirements 
for sending mail from scripts.

- Allen

Most mail-related problems have nothing to do with the sendmail line
used by PHP. They are typically problems further downstream in the
mail system.

The best way to debug is to be able to watch the mail.log as you send
a message using php. Definitely consult with your provider to get to
the bottom of this.

I have asked my provider and they replied that some of their FAQs are out of 
date and/or are no longer supported and that Level1 support would be happy 
to help but they are not trained in scripting languages. I have already 
asked if there were any special requirements and was told I had to upgrade 
my package from Business to Business-Pro which I did. They further suggested 
that I find a working Linux example, copy it and then implement it, as my 
new hosting package will support it.

If there are any other 1and1 users who are successfully sending out Linux 
emails, I would be most grateful if you would be so kind as to let me have a 
copy of the coding.

Start simply, run this script and see what happens

<?php
$to      = 'paulcheung at tiscali.co.uk';
$subject = 'the subject';
$message = 'hello';
$headers = "From: paulcheung at tiscali.co.uk\n" .
		    "Return-Path: paulcheung at tiscali.co.uk\n" .
		    'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion();

var_dump(mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers));
?>

It is possible that your email is going out, but getting rejected, and
the return path will help you establish that. If mail() fails, as
stated above you're going to need to check your logs for more
information. You might want to even consider using Pear Mail
(http://pear.php.net/package/Mail) to provide you with more helpful
error messages.

A common one is assuming that the localhost mail server is working 
because it accepts the mail from the application.  I see a lot of 
bounces in my mail logs from web sites which ship mail from the 
box-stock and unconfigured sendmail servers on localhost.  These 
machines will often not be registered in DNS or will lack a valid PTR 
record or will greet target server with a generic "HELO 
bogus.site.name".  An increasing number of mail servers are doing DNS 
checks of mail servers as an anti-spam defense.

Case in point:

Jun 11 04:13:55 jack postfix/smtpd[57160]: NOQUEUE: reject: CONNECT from 
unknown[62.160.92.240]: 554 5.7.1 Client host rejected: cannot
  find your hostname, [62.160.92.240]; proto=SMTP

Thanks Brian, all.

The official LinkedIn group for NYPHP is the New York PHP Community.  Oddly,
I can't find a link to the "main page" of it on linkedin.com, but if you
search for it, it should come right up.

Anyone know how to get a link to a LinkedIn group?

And here is our Flickr group:

Thanks Brian and Ed for supporting the group.

You may want to try setting up an email server as a test somewhere else, 
so you can have real access to the logs, and then using phpMailer, since 
it supports real smtp over port 25, with auth and ssl if need be. Access 
to mail log is definetely the first step in troubleshooting this (should 
be something like /var/log/mail.log)

For one project I worked on, email worked correctly only after I set up 
proper reverse resolve for the IP where mail was going out, setting up 
SPF record for the domain with that IP in it (Hi msn/hotmail and co) and 
setting up Domain Keys (Hi yahoo!)

With Domain Keys, at least with Postfix and dk-milter, there was no 
other way to get email signed besides using phpMailer - somehow mail() 
does not interface with postfix right (?) and email was not being signed 
unless the whole SMTP took place over regular port 25/tcp

You should also check the IP address of that server in various black 
lists like spamhaus etc.

Also, Id make sure From: part of the email is a valid address so you can 
receive any bounces.

Hi All,

   When I try to call the second Stored procedure from PHP , I get this
following error
                            "Commands out of sync; you can't run this

  When I search I get the result as, it is because of the buffering problem
with the opened connection. Anyone know how to fix it?



Thanks in Advance,

Hi!

i've done a couple of searches and haven't found anything to solve this bug.? i find it funny that if you do a search for that particular error on google, it will bring you to a whole slough of sites experiencing the same problem.? i might try to debug it on my own, but i just wanted to see if anyone else was able to figure it out and i have a feeling it might be a bit of a lost cause!!??

I had that problem while using mysqli_multi_query on a fairly large 
dataset (imdb database) not too long ago.  I don't remember the exact 
reason that was explained (mostly because there wasn't a very good one 
given), but in the end, I found that running store_result on the result 
set took care of the problem.  Considering the solution, I think it's 
related to buffering, as you mentioned.
                   
        $oDb->multi_query($sUpdate);
       
        // clears the buffer
        while($oDb->next_result()) {
            $oDb->store_result();
        }

Correction: the freetype2 lib was not installed on the machine by 
default and was required.

Unfortunately, I was in a rush to get it done and didn't take notes. I 
do remember now that the true type fonts were not installed on the 
machine either so I copied one over from a windows machine. Here's a 
list of pear stuff installed:

Installed packages, channel pear.php.net:
=========================================
Package        Version   State
Archive_Tar    1.3.1     stable
Console_Getopt 1.2       stable
Image_Text     0.6.0beta beta
PEAR           1.4.9     stable
Text_CAPTCHA   0.3.1     alpha
Text_Figlet    1.0.0     stable
Text_Password  1.1.0     stable
XML_RPC        1.4.8     stable

Here's  a snippet of code that works (for me):

<?php

require_once 'Text/CAPTCHA.php';
session_start();

$captcha = Text_CAPTCHA::factory('Image');
$options = array('font_size'=>'20',
        'font_path'=>'/home/webdir/',
        'font_file'=>'VERDANA.TTF');
$captcha->init(150, 60,NULL,$options);
$image = $captcha->getCAPTCHAAsJPEG();
file_put_contents('captcha.jpg', $image);
$_SESSION['captcha_phrase'] = $captcha->getPhrase();

?>

The captcha has succeeded in stopping any futher spam from hitting my 
clients comment board. I've read, however, that something as simple as a 
fixed image and a request to retype the displayed word is sufficient

That really depends upon how popular the attraction is. The more 
popular the site, the more incentive for spammers to break it.

Here's some of my examples:

http://webbytedd.com/aa/assorted-captcha/

They all work, but they all can be broken as well.

Cheers,

Actually it's not *odd* at all, in the sense that the LinkedIn groups
directory is widely known to be totally broken, and has been for some time.

The search is also somewhat broken, so nice that it comes up at all.

Interesting idea, what types of attributes do you define?

I like the concept of the ObsoleteAttribute in .net and think this
would be one area where I would use that in PHP. Since I've never
defined a custom attribute in .NET, and only modified a custome
attribute class once, I can live without them just fine without them
in PHP for most purposes. If I have to inherit a class instead of
decorating functions with attributes, to create a web service so be
it.

We use it in a lot of place here at massify.   For our ORM, we use it  
similar to how I have it in the example in that blog post.  We also  
use it on our controllers to specify pre and post filters to call  
before we route the incoming HTTP request.

The place we use it the most is in our Model controllers.  For our  
internal API's, we have a base controller class that can perform basic  
CRUD and search on any given model.  To enable this for a specific  
model, we inherit that controller and dress it with metadata to tell  
it which model to use, how to map query parameters to search  
parameters, post fields to model properties, etc.  We can literally  
kick out an API for the model in a few minutes.

You could do this without the metadata, but it makes it easier.  We've  
found anyways.

Best,

Jon.

Hello,

I am new to the Lynn area, I have a project that I have created the  
specs for.  I have 9 years of exp with PHP / MySQL and plan to put  
this idea into action soon.  However rather than using a template to  
start I am looking for an XHTML / CSS / JS guru that can team up with  
me on this project.  If you are a good designer and are interested in  
hearing more about this project please email me back and I will go  
over the basic idea of what the site will be, etc.

Thanks,

The captcha has succeeded in stopping any futher spam from hitting my 
clients comment board. I've read, however, that something as simple as a 
fixed image and a request to retype the displayed word is sufficient 
(http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000712.html)?

Hey, nice use of reflection to pull the yaml out of the class definitions.

I've been doing a similar thing using json to customize existing
models at runtime, inspired by Kenneth Downs Adromeda Project. I went
with json over yaml in hopes of being able to reuse the model on the
client but haven't gotten around to that yet.

Centralizing and automating this stuff is definitely the way to go.

Hi All,

I wish to create a Javascript Highlighter. While we are reading some texts
on a webpage, I need to select certain words or paragraphs. When I click on
the selected portion, it need to remain as unselected. When we move to next
page, no need to keep this selection.

Any ideas would be great!

Thank you all.

Test.

1 Login to their site. URL and other details are:

User Name: anieshjoseph at gmail.com
Password: test123

2. Click on 'Restart Online'. If it doesn't work, please click on 'Start
Online'.

3. On the left side of the question, there is some texts are displayed.
Please select some texts and it will be highlighted. You can select many
text like this and all be highlighted.

 When you click on a highlighted portion, then it will lose the selection.

Please NOTE, this works only in Internet Explorer.

I wish to create a Highlighter like this. I also need it to be work on
Mozilla and Explorer. if possible, it need to work on all browsers.

Can you send some suggestions on where I can start with this work ?

I'm all for CakePHP - as a developer I use it on about 90% of the
PHP-based projects I work on. It makes developing easier and
maintenance a breeze. Like all things programming, though, it has it's
uses and one can use it in situation where better alternatives exist.

You know I was using smarty templates for CSS but I think I like this
better for the following reasons:

1) I had to escape the {} brackets that weren't variables, or change
the variable delimeter in smarty.
2) This just works and does what I need for CSS. The whole smarty MVC
thing is overkill, expecially when my view (the css) isn't a view.

To gain the benefits of browser/proxy caching, trimmed down page size(s) and
thus faster loading pages, CSS should be in its own file.  Just link to the
file in the header of your view files using:
<link rel='stylesheet' href='http://domain.com/css/gui.css'>

However, if you want to keep stylesheets in your Smarty template, place it
within {literal} ... {/literal} tags to force Smarty to ignore everything
therein, including brackets.  JavaScript can also safely be left unparsed by
Smarty in this way.

Hey all,

This fairly short and pretty cool vectored attack came through on the 
dailydave; thought I'd share it here:

- Ben

---------------------

Hi -

Back in 2002 I had published details of a vulnerability affecting most
web browsers. It detailed a security flaw that allows attackers to
abuse non-HTTP protocols to launch Cross Site Scripting attacks even
when a target web application was not vulnerable to XSS.

Six years later I'm releasing an update to this research in this
paper. This security vulnerability still affects popular web browsers
nowadays and the following browsers were tested as vulnerable:

    * Internet Explorer 6
    * Internet Explorer 7
    * Internet Explorer 8 (beta 1)
    * Opera 9.27
    * Opera 9.50
    * Safari 1.32
    * Safari 3.1.1

Others have described how to abuse behavior for purposes other than
Cross Site Scripting. NGSSoftware previously published a paper called
"Inter-Protocol Exploitation" which references the original
EyeonSecurity paper.

Glad to be of service.

If you will consider using a .htaccess doc, then try this:

<FilesMatch ".*\.css">
	ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

That way you won't have to rename the suffix of your css files to 
php. However, you'll still need to have your css files start with --

<?php header('Content-Type: text/css; charset=UTF-8'); ?>

-- for browser like FireFox, which actually does this right. Most 
other browsers don't require a header.

Cheers,

tedd

Actually, I was using smarty to generate per user custom stylesheets
as seperate css files not including it inline in the html. Yeah I
never did consider caching issues. As Tedd suggested in another email
I did set the header.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Smarty templating replacement - Dwoo
Message-ID: <8f0676b40806180922q3726d5e4sc808efcb426cdbc6@mail.gmail.com>

I have noticed a lot of people on the list mention Smarty, and I found
an replacement for Smarty called Dwoo that looks really promising.  It
is still beta, but I have tried it and it fixes a bunch of Smarty
problems.

The website is http://dwoo.org/

A couple of features worth mentioning:

1. Dwoo is designed to be a drop in replacement for Smarty, so in
theory, all of your existing smarty templates will work with Dwoo.
2. Dwoo supports template inheritance.
3. Dwoo can be set to treat brackets followed by a space as a literal
bracket.  This is really helpful for css/javascript.

Template inheritance is a really awesome feature that was borrowed
from the Django templating system.  Template inheritance is similar to
Symfony's slots, but more elegant and powerful.  With CakePhp, I see
crap like embedding the title and required external css/javascript
files in the controller, which is just plain wrong, but I don't know
of a good work around.  With template inheritance, it is easy for a
inner page template to modify the page title, add an additional
stylesheet, or embed javascript at the top or the bottom of the page,
while using a common master template.

I am not affiliated with this project in anyway... I just stumbled
upon it, and thought others may find it interesting.

Cheers,
-John C.

The problem was not really technical. It was the to do with the way 1and1 have setup their webhosting packages. the Linux package I was using, the so named business package, doesn't support sending emails. when I upgraded to their Linux Business-Pro package, which supports SSH, I was able to send emails from PHP applications.

<?php
$to = "johndoe at hotmail.com";
$subject = "Hi!";
$body = "Hi,\n\nHow are you?";
$headers = "From: sender at example.com\r\n" . "X-Mailer: php";
if (mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers)) {
  echo("<p>Message sent!</p>");
 } else {
  echo("<p>Message delivery failed...</p>");
 }
?>

You are talking about manipulating text selection ranges.  I didn't find an
off-the-shelf complete solution, but found several useful sources to help
you.

http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/range_intro.html

/**
 * This code is a derivative work of Moodle
 * and is licensed under the GPL-v2
 */
function getSel(){
  var seltext;
  if (window.getSelection)
    seltext=window.getSelection();
  else if (window.document.getSelection)
    seltext=window.document.getSelection();
  else if (window.document.selection)
    seltext=window.document.selection.createRange().text;
  return seltext;
}
seltext = '';
if(window.frames.length == 0){ // Can't read from another frame, JS security
  seltext=getSel();
}
if(seltext!='') {
  // create a new element at the point of click, wrapping the selection
document.selection.createRange().pasteHTML("<span style='background-color:
yellow;'>" + seltext + "</span>");
  // problem is that pasteHTML is for IE only
  // I didn't have a chance to work out a full solution or test this code

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Disabling browser back button.
Message-ID: <2478B6E0A5284FE9858A62B8DC64C4DD@X9183>

Hi

Can anybody suggest a way around this problem or point me in the right 
direction?

I have a genuinely legitimate reason to disable the browser back button, or 
at least the pages that have anything to do with the PHP application I am 
working on.

Here is the scenario
A user likes the on-line service provided and decides to purchase it using 
one of the standard on-line payment methods, typically PayPal.

Once payment has been made, confirmed and received, the user is directed to 
an customer account creation page. Here the user enters the usual standard 
account details such as Name, Address, Telephone Number, User-Id, Password 
and so on.

The application then generates an access code, which is automatically 
emailed from the application to the customer. As a precaution all PHP 
sessions variables are cleared, the "customer account creation page" is 
cleared and the user steered away from the signup part of the application to 
Google's main navigation page (this last bit being for testing purposes).

Here in lays the problem. After initial creation of the account code and 
when the back button is pressed a few times, the user eventually return to 
the "customer account creation page". Which is the step immediately 
following payment validation. At this point, if the customer wants to create 
another new account all she or he has to do is, fill it the form once more, 
press submit and another new account is created. If the user just keeps 
doing this, he or she just keeps on creating new accounts.

I have tried to disable the browser back button; but am unable to. I have 
researched JavaScript solutions and learnt, if the user turns off 
JavaScript, that is that.

Cheers

Paul

The way this is usually dealt with is to use an HTTP redirect after
the action is performed.

And / or when you create a form you can add a hidden field containing
a random token. The server stores a copy of the random token in the
user's session. When the form is submitted, check to make sure the
token matches the one in the session. If it does destroy it and
perform the desired operation. Now if the user later backs into the
form and submits it the token will be old and you'll know not to
process the POST request action.

Why do you make them wait to create their account until after they  
pay?  Aren't Name, Address, and phone necessary for payment  
processing anyway?

I assume you keep some record of the payment, that has some  
identifier.  Like maybe a primary key on some "payments" table in a  
database.  So why not associate accounts with payment_ids, and force  
accounts to have a unique payment id?  Adding that sort of simple  
rule to the account-creation process would solve things.  If someone  
backs up and tries to come through again, you don't create a second  
account, you just tell the user "Nice try, buddy..."

Of course.

You're trying to solve an authorization problem at the user interface  
level.  If something is supposed to be impossible, it's better to  
make the underlying model or business logic enforce the model.   
Trying to enforce it by tightly controlling stuff that happens in the  
user's browser is ineffective, because you don't control the user's  
browser.  But you do control what happens on the server.  And you can  
make sure the server only allows one account per payment in just a  
few lines of code.

Use a token.

<?php session_start();

$token = isset($_SESSION['token']) ? $_SESSION['token'] : 0;

if ($token == 1)
    {
    exit();
    }

$_SESSION['token']) == 1;

That way the page will be loaded just once per session.

Cheers,

tedd

Tedd -- this is very similar to the way you showed me how to use the 
boolean 'step' value to exit the error checking loop if no error 
conditions were found -- and just as simple to understand and brutally 
effective...I love it!

Im this scenario, if the user for whatever reason needed to reload the 
page because of a malfunction, they'd need to establish a whole new 
session and start over with everything...and presumably pay a second 
time to be able to set up another account, which would dissuade them 
very effectively.  

In the Paypal app I recently built, I had them create an account and/or 
log in using their unique email address before they were able to 
purchase, and then captured their Paypal transaction ID (tx) upon 
redirect, inserted it into a table along with the ID of the product 
they had purchased, and authenticated against that for the download.

I'm glad that you saw what I was doing. But, in all honesty I write 
simple code because I look at problems that way -- I'm simple. The 
complex I find too difficult to write so I pound on a problem until 
it breaks into a series of simple parts that I can understand. Then I 
just assemble the solution.

What you have described is very similar to what I do. I know you know 
how to do this, but for the benefit of any readers, I submit the 
following to consider.

Before any purchase can be considered, the user must identify 
his/herself via a logon, membership, or something that allows the 
process to know this is a real person who wants to purchase something.

After that step, then comes the selection of product followed by the 
payment process.

Once the flow is in the payment process, you don't want the user to 
hit the back button NOR refresh their browser. So, I make a very 
prominent warning (large red type) on that page that says if the user 
clicks the back button or refreshes their browser, then that action 
will cancel their transaction and they will have to start again. Some 
actually read the warning and follow directions.

To accomplish this, I incorporate token checking (as I previously 
described) to make sure they don't refresh the page as well as using 
javascript to disable the submit button -- Ialso don't want users to 
click the purchase button several times. It's really surprising how 
impatient users can get (click, click, click.....).

But, regardless of what you do, you still have to plan that users 
won't follow directions and that's the reason for the token.

Additionally, what happens IF the user has javascript turned off and 
can click the purchase button more than once? In that case, I also 
add another token routine for submitting data to PayPal. That way no 
matter what happens (many clicks, refresh, back button), the request 
for authorization is sent to PayPal only ONCE.

Oddly enough, that still isn't the end of it. You must also contact 
PayPal (or whatever payment processing you are using) and ask them 
for "double transaction suppression" to be turned ON at their end. 
That way, it's almost certain that users won't be charged for the 
same item more than once.

After all that, you should receive an authorization back from PayPal 
that everything is OK. So, record that authorization and whatever 
other user information you need and supply the user user with their 
purchase. But note, it is very important that you drop ALL the credit 
card information you have gathered in your script within 24 hours. 
Keeping any specific cc information beyond 24 hours is against the 
law.

As you well know, with a little work and understanding how the 
process works, you can anticipate what user may do; gather the data 
you need; and make the sale.

Cheers,

tedd

Hi Tedd,
Sorry to say it didn't work or at least I couldn't get it to work. As you 
see the only thing I did was to tidy up the last $_SESSION['token']. however 
I did try using True and False which disabled me completely.

<?php session_start(); ob_start();
    $token = isset($_SESSION['token']) ? $_SESSION['token'] : 0;
      if ($token == 1)
    {
    exit();
    }
$_SESSION['token'] = 1;

Paul:

It does work -- here's a working example:

http://webbytedd.com/bb/one-time/

You can only see it once per session and it uses exactly the code I posted.

You might take out that ob_start() and try it again.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <1214168377.10750@coral.he.net>

Excellent points.  And I will pass the 'double transaction suppression' 
info on to my client so he can enable this.  With reard to storing 
credit card info on customers, I'd in general strongly advise any of my 
clients against going there -- with Paypal's (or whatever vendor they 
end up using) unique transaction ID that information is available in 
some form I'd imagine if requested...and also, that is what you are 
paying Paypal a percentage of the transaction for, so you don't have to 
trouble yourself about needing to store or request such information on 
your end of the app flow.

Interestingly, on this project I learned that there is a thing called 
Paypal Micro, where on transactions under a dollar they only charge 9 
or 10 cents per transaction, which is the only thing that makes it cost 
effective to sell such cheap products through Paypal, as ordinarily 
they'd swoop in and take a higher percentage of such a small sale.  To 
use it, any client has to set up a new Paypal merchant account separate 
from any non-Micro account they might already have, which is a pain, 
but worth it overall with the money saved.

In my app, the actual Paypal form is submitted by an 'invisible' PHP 
page that is never accessible to the user...so it's theoretically 
impossible for them to send it twice...I think.  In any event, this app 
is a single item click & pay thing so from an error handling 
perspective it didn't require as much as some more complicated Paypal 
stuff would.

This is the same method I'm incorporating to handle the error checking 
routine for the two form pages...passing things into hidden fields and 
submitting a second 'invisible' form with the values from the first 
form after the error conditions are satisfied.

I appreciate your coding style, Tedd, because I too am a huge fan of 
keeping it simple -- and also of 'brute force' methods that probably 
are not the most elegant of solutions but the important things (to me) 
are 1.  they work; and 2. when I go back to revisit code I wrote months 
or years ago, it's easier for me to understand what I was doing and 
reuse or enhance it.

I don't think there's ever a good reason to disable the "Back" button
in a web application. If you think it necessary, it's time to rethink
your process.

That said, there are ways to handle it on the back end so that the
user can't submit twice. Have you considered setting a session value
at a point that allows creating the account, and then clearing the
value once the account has been created?

Otherwise someone could just clear their session data and go back to
add more accounts.

We had a horrendous experience with Mediatemple and just moved to Peer1.com.
Using their dedicated virtual (dv) 3.0 Rage package with MySQL was a
nightmare.  Queries that would usually execute in well under .5 seconds
would sometimes run well over a minute - clearly unrelated to the
application being custom built, and obviously a result of poor management on
Mediatemple's part.  Granted, we are paying more for our own dedicated
servers at Peer1 now, but we would have upgraded to private servers at
Mediatemple if their (dv) 3.0 Rage service and accompanying "VIP Support"
hadn't been such a joke.

Your database should be located in the same datacenter as your
application code, otherwise you are going to be in a world of hurt...
imagine doing 10 synchronous queries with 100ms of connection latency.
 If you are using something like CakePHP, your application could be
doing 100's of queries per page view.

I really like Slicehost if you want something cheap.  You get a Xen
instance starting at $20 a month, and you can upgrade the instance or
add instances with about 2 mouse clicks.

+1 for virtual servers.

I pay $20/month for a Xen host with Linode (linode.com). They have a nice 
control panel where you can build disk images, boot/shutdown/reboot 
machines, do upgrades etc. They also give you access to the virtual 
console of your server via screen.

Agreed on that approach for small sites, and also can recommend
ServerBeach for dedicated hosting. For a couple hundred bucks you can
get a dual, dual-cpu system more than capable of running everything
for moderate sites.

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with WebFaction for their
shared hosting plans.  I'm thinking of switching to them after my current
plan expires, but I haven't heard much about them besides what they say on
their own website.  The only concern of mine is their limited disk space,
but in reality I probably won't use 10GB.  I'm looking at their Shared 1
plan at http://www.webfaction.com/services/hosting

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'm currently at Hostdime and am
not very satisfied.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mysql slow Internet connection trickery
Message-ID: <4868E06D.9090603@polymerdb.org>

Hi Gang,

Banging my head against this wall, wondered if you all might know 
something I don't.  (It does happen often, I find.)

I need to provide several users with access to an online php/mysq 
database app, where the user's Internet connection is intermittently 
slow or down.  We've used this (custom-written) database app quite well 
for a long time, but this Internet connection, combined with these 
users' need for real-time data to make moment-to-moment decisions -- it 
makes for a tricky challenge:  either they suffer with using the system 
over this slow connection, or I find a way to bridge the gap for them.

FYI, this is a hotel rooms management system being used to check guests 
in as they arrive.  The Internet connection we've been given here in 
Paraguay is pretty spotty.  We're in several hotels in town and need the 
data shared in real time across all locations, so something like just 
running a local copy seems like its not an option.

Still, I'm trying to make a way for the user to have "mostly current" 
data from the central system, and also enter data without waiting for 
each request to be approved.  I have been thinking you could run a local 
copy of the system on the user's laptop, then have some helper program 
in the back that communicates with the central server to send and 
receive data asynchronously, pushing user changes and polling for new 
data from the central server as fast as the Internet connection allows.  
The idea is that, except for a few minutes of latency, the user would 
never know the difference.

The big problem I'm running into is managing potential data collisions: 
data changes from two or more users that conflict with each other but 
aren't discovered until later because of the latency.  As far as I can 
see this is an application-specific problem -- that is, it's up to the 
developer (me) to make the application smart enough to watch conflicts 
and prevent collisions. 

But, having wracked my brain over this for a few days already, I finally 
thought it would be wise to at least ask somebody if there might be an 
easier way, some product that's designed to serve as a proxy or to ease 
this kind of 'intermittent connection' situation.  A mysql product named 
"mysql proxy" got my attention because of its name, but from what I can 
tell it doesn't do what I'm describing here.

You all have any thoughts?

Allen,

Maybe there's a way of storing data in a structured manner on the
filesystem, so that you can use subversion / etc to manage changes to that
data?

It might be a bad idea, but it's the first thing I thought of.

I would research Google Gears and/or Firefox's Prism (or whatever is finally got named). It would close the gap for the most part by making syncronization easier.

- Allen:

One word -- transactions.

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/ansi-diff-transactions.html

The transaction scheme is one that solves the problems you address. 
The theory is simply a record doesn't get updated unless it's certain 
that the process will happen.

Here's a tutorial on it:

Good idea.  Haven't dealt with those at all yet; sounds like a possibility.

I would point out that:

1. Transactions will not be useful if you cannot connect to the database
2. Google Gears and Prism seem to focus first on bridging the web /
application space for a single user, rather than dealing with multi-way
synchronization

Source code control systems are explicitly designed to manage the process of
synchronizing local state with a repository in a controlled fashion.
Ultimately, if there is a conflict it's not just up to your application to
resolve, but also your users.

How do you prevent a room from being double booked?  You can look at booking
patterns and develop an algorithm can be developed that minimizes
collisions.  But who gets a room if it is double booked?  That's probably a
phone call or a conversation between employees.

Hi Tedd,

If I understand the intro correctly, that article is about standard 
mysql transactions, but the problem I'm having won't really be solved 
with usual START TRANSACTION / COMMIT transactions.  As an analogy, 
consider a instant messenger session between two people on very slow 
connections.  Transactions can make sure that when one types a message, 
that message arrives to its recipient intact -- the sentence is not 
broken up or mangled.  The latency problem, though, is when these two 
people are sending consecutive messages to each other but not receiving 
responses in real time.  It becomes vaudeville very quickly: (Are you 
coming?  Will you be late? Yes. Oh,  I mean no.  Well I meant that other 
question.  Whatever.) 

The problem here is that the user's actions are dependent on the live 
data, and the live data can be changed by multiple users at once, with 
the various users remaining some minutes (or possibly more) behind the 
actual live data.  It's a problem that we already have to guard against 
in a multi-user environment, but the latency period, and the potential 
for collisions, is hugely increased. 

Looks like I have some coding to do.

Hi Patrick,

Yes, you've summarized it perfectly.  I was already thinking of version 
control systems as a similar situation: the conflicts have to be 
resolved by a human being who's aware of the real world situation.  The 
app just can't know which commit to take.

Thought it wouldn't hurt to ask for a magic bullet, but you're stating 
what I figured already: this is application-specific and it's up to me 
to program the collision detection and resolution methods.

Thanks,
Allen

 Though version control systems don't provide the whole solution, they can
provide quite a bit of background information to a users:

1. is the local data up to date?
2. if we can't connect, how old is the local data?
3. if we can connect, are there any conflicts?
4. there is a conflict, when and who committed the conflicting data?

If it is possible to structure the data so that diff can produce the change
sets, then you can get the benefit of the network optimization that tools
like Subversion provide.  But this is a data-representation issue, and I
guess you're concerned that flat files won't give you enough complexity to
represent the business.

Hi Allen:

I think I understand your problem.

You don't want a user being given a confirmation of a room when in 
fact the confirmation has not actually been confirmed because of RACE 
conditions.

You could have the situation where several users are looking at the 
same open room (provided by the most "up-to-date" information) and 
believing that they could reserve it. But, in fact the only one who 
will be able to reserve the room will be the one who get's there 
first -- the classic RACE problem.

While you feel that transactions will not solve the problem you face, 
but the problem you face is the same problem that Transactions face. 
I think any solution you create, will resemble the method that 
transactions use.

Please read part 2 above.

Cheers,

tedd

The odd issue is connectivity.  If there is no network connectivity to the
primary mysql server, how can one use transactions to manage
synchronization?

One other thing to look at is if keeping a database connection is the most 
effective use of the limited bandwidth. Maybe sending the (partial) 
queries/responses as text via sockets has less overhead.
You may also want to analyse the workflow more and see which information 
really needs to be shared and which one can remain local. If you only need to 
exchange the booked/available status for rooms then passing on the guest 
information is not necessary.

Overall, you can minimize the impact, but there is no way to use PHP or some 
other tool to code a better connection.

Well, it all depends on how you engineer the thing.

But something to look into is "replication"

I used it a lot in Lotus Notes, and you can use it with MySQL.  So if 
you can place your database/web servers local to your clients, they can 
use their local server to make the updates, with everything replicated 
back to a master database.

This is in NO WAY a magic bullet.  Conflicts won't be magically handled, 
but what you will have is that all conflicts will be RECORDED and tracked.

Than you can have one or more people who are authorized to use the "fix" 
functions and go in and flag entrees with the latest timestamp to give 
them preference.

What this does is:
1) Saves you the moaning and groaning about the flaky connection - now 
everyone has a local server which gives them maximum speed.

2) Saves you the hassle of deciding how to flag conflicts and track 
them, instead you just need to implement a PHP solution to rectify the 
problems.

Head, meet wall.

Sorry, here is a link on MySQL replication/conflict resolution:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysql-cluster-replication-conflict-resolution.html


Something to note, it will not always be something that is just a simple 
"pick a timestamp" for conflicts, so this system will take some time and 
thought.

For example:
Customer A:
A Record(Name, Address, Favorite sport, whatever)

Customer B:
B Record(Name, Address, Favorite sport, whatever)

Room RC:
RC Record(Floor, keycode, type, etc)

Room RD:
RD Record(Floor, keycode, type, etc)

Reservations:
Customer A reserved room RC from June 1st to June7th
Customer B reserves room RC from June 5st to June 9th

Reserved Records:
Room RC, June 1st, Customer A
Room RC, June 2nd Customer A
Room RC, June 3rd, Customer A
Room RC, June 4th Customer A
Room RC, June 5th, (Repl conflict! Customer A or B)
Room RC, June 6th,  (Repl conflict! Customer A or B)
Room RC, June 7th,  (Repl conflict! Customer A or B)
Room RC, June 8th, Customer B
Room RC, June 9th, Customer B

The only conflict above would potentially be in the Reserved Records, 
all the other records can be updated independently. 

So not only do the 3 conflicted records need to be updated, but 
whichever customer loses must be re-registered for another room(and gap 
days reserved must be released.  If B was given the room, than the 1-4th 
records for customer A must be purged)


In the end, the /system/ you use for catching conflicts will matter less 
than the application you build to resolve them.

In fact there /is/ connectivity.  It's just bone-numbingly slow and 
occassionally non-existent.

This probably isn't the answer you want to hear, but maybe the clients 
money would be better spent on upgrading to a real connection instead of 
on a development resource trying to fix a non-software problem with 
software?

Not sure how expensive telephone landlines are in Paraguay, but you 
might want to roll out your own network with on-demand dialups.. the 
same way credit card terminals work.

Actually, you're right, this is the true solution.  This is the tragedy 
I find in many non-profits (this client included): lack of business 
experience in the executive team can lead to a lack of appreciation for 
the limitations of space, time, and manpower.  Ah, well...

In a lot of cases that might work.  For us, the thing is we're here for 
a single event of 5 days long (with a week or so of on-site prep before 
that).  The network is dependent on local providers, vendors, local 
staff, local budget, etc.  Our team usually works in US, Japan, Korea, 
etc. where the band is a little broader.  If we could come up with a 
system that works in this environment, we'd be much more ready to show 
up on short notice in future similar situations.

Passing arrays in a query string is the wrong way to do it.  Too many  
things can go wrong.

You could try creating a form, and sticking the serialize()d array  
value in to a hidden field.  Then POST the form to your gallery page.

<?PHP
echo '<form action="gallery.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="cart" value="' . serialize($cart) . '"/>
<input type="submit" value="Go To Gallery"/>
</form>';
?>

And in gallery.php
<?PHP
$cart = unserialize($_POST['cart']);
?>
