&gt;<i> Thought this would spice things up on the list ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Years ago, I asked a perl guru friend of mine what he used to connect
</I>&gt;<i> application objects and relational data.  Certain he would provide
</I>&gt;<i> insight, he replied that there was nothing to use, and he built his
</I>&gt;<i> own stuff for each and every project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That did provide insight - that there was no easy solution ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I then spent several years in Zopeland, living with this frightening
</I>&gt;<i> thing called Zope Object DataBase (ZODB).  Not mapping to relations,
</I>&gt;<i> this was a true object database.  This was really great, until you
</I>&gt;<i> needed to access it from outside Zope however...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've just been pointed at Propel:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://propel.phpdb.org/wiki/">http://propel.phpdb.org/wiki/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of a pure relational or object environment, Propel takes PHP
</I>&gt;<i> (5) objects and maps them to a relational schema.  This concept was
</I>&gt;<i> brought over from Java, and similar exist for just about all the other
</I>&gt;<i> application languages - so it is not a surprise to be coming to PHP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone at NYPHP have experience with this strange yet beautiful
</I>&gt;<i> environment?  Ease of use?  Performance?
</I>
Those who know me will expect this response:  I don't think it makes
sense :)

Not too mention a performance hit, the relational and objective models
don't mesh well in my opinion - they are really different animals.  In
fact, there are object-based databases, but they have had limited
success from my experience (again, though, I'm probably biased :)

That said, the propel implementation does look like a good one,
regardless of whether I think it's a good idea or not.  Seems like a
good presentation topic, too, if there's anyone who has found success
with it :)
