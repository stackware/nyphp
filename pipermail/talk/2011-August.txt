If you were to allow spaces in the user name I would force them all to 
lower case (avoid duplicates if properly spaced).  However collapsing 
spaces is an idea I would not even entertain to use.  "John  Foobar" vs. 
"John Foobar" is something that is always prone to errors if a user has 
to input their name into a text field.  You could also break the input 
elements into a first name and last name fields.  When you go to display 
that information then you can properly insert the spaces.

Use case insensitive field or execute query with "lowercase"

SELECT * FROM table WHERE LOWERCASE( $name ) = LOWERCASE( name )

Depends by your goal, I could let user insert space and case only for
personal informations as name, address and such, not necessary on
login, unless you need higher security.

My 2 morning cents :)

Hello everyone ,

  Need some help from you.
 
 Suppose someone is Writing an article like  newspaper article. If user who is in London wrote one article & set publish date & time according to UK timezone ,
Now another user who is in Tokyo wrote one article & set publish date & time according to Japan timezone,

so how can i publish/make available their articles with respect to their timezone?

Please  give me some guidance on php timezone handling..

Thanks in advance.

Hi!

Years ago I was looking into the a similar issue and one way is to run a 
Javascript on the client side that returns the GMT bias of the 
client...assuming they set it correctly. The script reads it from a cookie 
that gets written.
It is from a (still unfinished) project and this part is years old, so my 
memory as to how exactly it works is fading. The JavaScript part is also not 
my invention, I received that from someone on this list.

The attached file contains a function that creates a heading for a page. The 
time displayed in the heading is the time of the client, but based off the 
server time. So the client's time is irrelevant as long as the GMT bias is 
correctly set and, of course, the server has the correct time and local bias.

I hope you can follow the handful of lines of code and hopefully it helps with 
what you try to accomplish.

David

Use one timezone, the server one or where is located the website! When
you show the time and the article time you can get the user timezone,
and show the article with their timezone

does any know of a way to grab an image url that gets returned as a response from a curl call?  what's happening is that i am making a ping call to a service and they render a pixel, but within the url of the image, there is data that i need to parse out.  i've checked the headers and there isn't a file location and the response just renders the image with the url.

any ideas to how to get this?

what do you mean by " the response just renders the image with the url" ?
you mean the url is written in the image OR the url is written after the
data (that is the code of the image)?

Could you provide me/us (privately) the url of the pixel image so I can
understand what's your problem?
Thanks

Guys...

I actually ran into the same problem and never could resolve it.
Anyone know of a tutorial online anywhere? It would prolly be valuable
if someone put one online.

I assume that the single-pixel-image is actually part of that
response.  You're not going to get a different url.  The url you're
using essentially "is" the url to the gif.

I believe WHERE/= in MySQL is case insensitive.  If you want
case-sensitive conditions, you'll want to use WHERE BINARY field LIKE
'data' or the documentation-preferred WHERE COLLATE latin1_general_cs
LIKE 'data'.  Important to keep in mind if you're rolling your own
authentication.

To add to this, there is a fantastic python module called mutagen that
does a pretty incredible job of reading and writing id3 tags.  I used
it pretty heavily on an enormous music-based php project that manages
tens of thousands of mp3s.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP html DOM manipulation
Message-ID: <4E3C713A.4000908@gmail.com>

I was wondering what the current favorites are for PHP html DOM 
manipulation are.

I ran across one library which basically took all the JQuery DOM 
functions and created PHP equivalents for them - so you can do things 
like find all the elements of a certain tag class or type and replace 
their html with something else.

One thing I'd like to see this for is to re-write all those cool 
lightbox style javascript codes into PHP code[so instead of the user 
waiting for all the HTML to download, then waiting for a javascript 
event to trigger to update the links from their old links to popup links 
if they have the appropriate class  - the server can pre-process the 
file and do those substitutions once and then cache the data.]

I like hpricot and mechanize but they are Ruby only. In PHP there is Snoopy,
but it wasn't that good.

Personally, I'm a fan of SimpleHTMLDOM, 
http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/, which has a great interface, but 
uses string parsing instead of DOM.

I haven't had much experience with these others:
phpQuery:     http://code.google.com/p/phpquery/
Zend_Dom:   http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.dom.html
QueryPath:   http://querypath.org/
FluentDOM:  http://www.fluentdom.org/

That said, if you're trying to replace simple javascript functionality 
for anything besides parsing HTML, I might argue that you might not be 
doing enough javascript.  I don't know your client(s) / empoyer(s) / 
project(s), but I've found in the past 2+ years that I could do so much 
more in javascript and keep php in the back for the heavier lifting and 
data access.  The recent flourishing of interesting javascript-heavy 
sites has essentially guaranteed javascript is enabled on most 
browsers.  I recently released a javascript-heavy site that is accessed 
by tens of  thousands of non-technical people every day and there 
haven't been any complaints (besides the occasional javascript bug that 
buzzed past my tests).

Of course, that always depends on your market.  Accessibility is a 
serious js-heavy issue.  And some sites need to be js-light for 
backwards compatibility (banks and other such institutions come to 
mind).  But if those specific cases aren't in your way, I might 
recommend getting cozier with JS instead of trying to replace it with 
PHP.  It's not the toy language of the early 00's, but rather an 
advanced and fast front-end language that has finally grown into its 
potential - and arguably the most popular language in the world.

Greetings All,

I have been asked by my sister in-law to provide an ecommerce solution for her small business. As I do not consider myself to be knowledgeable enough in this area, I am posting to this list to ask your thoughts and recommendations.

I did a quick search and checked out: x-cart, opencart, phpsupercart, squirrelcart, and cs-cart.

All of these look like they could do the job required but, I would greatly appreciate some input from you guys.

Also if anyone wants to discuss/promote their own e-commerce solutions, I am happy to receive your info off the list.

Have A Great Weekend and Thanks In Advance

Rob

For a "small" business with only a few products, I find PHP ecommerce 
applications to be overly complicated and complex.

SimpleCart works very well from a small business perspective:
http://simplecartjs.com/

If your sister is editing her items directly, it just means you add a 
little html markup to each item to make it an item which can be purchased.

There are a number of PHP scripts which have been written for different 
platforms to make creating products simpler[for example, RokCart is a 
simplecart implementation for Joomla! which adds a button on content 
editing to set the price and such and create a product.

The downside of simplecart is that because it is all done via javascript 
-  there is very little you can do to stop malicious buyers.  If a buyer 
can edit the javascript, they can go ahead and change the prices on the 
products and then submit the sale and it will be processed.  This means 
your sister would need to make sure to check the sales invoices in 
Paypal before shipping products and make sure the price is correct.  
Full fledged ecommerce solutions often have this type of functionality 
built in - they check invoice information returned by paypal and make 
sure it is valid - and flag invalid transactions.

It's a low end solution, but honestly I've run into a lot of people who 
only get 3 or 4 sales via the internet a month.  Spending lots of time 
and/or money to implement a high end ecommerce application is a waste.  
If/When business takes off and it is taking too much time to process the 
orders is when you upgrade[preferably to something that will support 
something like Amazon Fulfillment so that you can automate the entire 
process at some point].

Not knowing what business your sister is in, another thing I'll mention 
is to think very hard about whether or not to have a 'pick up' option 
for purchases and if so, set a reasonable shipping and handling cost.  
As an example, a small art Gallery which expects to sell mostly within 
200 miles can be better served by offering local pick up and placing a 
50-100$ handling charge on shipping paintings.   If you can get the 
buyer into the gallery, then you have the chance to cross-sell other 
items.  If you ship the item, it's a one time 500-1000$ sale AND 
packaging the whole thing up properly is a pain.  So charge for that 
pain/inconvenience and encourage buyers to come to the store.

Thanks Gary for your response.

I totally agree with your comments and, have tried to explain these points and many others to her previously but, feel that it fell on deaf ears.

Considering that I don't think she really has the time to manage an ecommerce web site properly, I think she is going to end up being very disappointed.

I have passed your response onto her and hopefully she may take notice!

Thanks again for your comments.

Regards

Rob

Depending on her needs, she might be better off using a hosted service like Shopify.   Before considering any cart package, check it out and see if it fits.

If you're willing to spend some money ($300 IIRC), LemonStand is pretty cool if you want a solid, modern, implementation that makes no assumptions about your store design/layout.  http://www.lemonstandapp.com.  My experience with lemonstand was good.  At one point, I needed a hook added to their event system.  I posted on their forum and it was implemented by the developers within something like 4 hours.

If she doesn't need any modification go for Magento or other open source
e-commerce, if she needs custom e-commerce is the solution, con: needs time,
pro: total control on any features. After a few pretty bad experience with
os-commerce, I started to install my custom CMS with an e-commerce module to
all of my clients, here an example www.supermercatodellarotonda.com, easy
and clean.

It is going to be really hard to beat Shopify.  You can get a store up
and running in no time, and it is very cheap.  If you have less than
100 SKUs it is only $30/month.  A VPS that can handle Magento will
cost about that much.  Do not try and run magento from a shared
hosting account, Magento is a massive PHP application that can be
painfully slow.

This sounds like premature optimization to me.  How can you make a
lightbox with PHP code?  Doesn't even make sense.  Sure PHP can run
selectors and maybe change attributes, but it can't bind an event to
the DOM.

If you want better performance, maybe event delegation in javascript
is a better solution.  See the jQuery docs for "live"

Just to recap how lightbox style scripts work:

1) You take a link to an image, and add an attribute to the link, such 
as rel="lightbox[mygallery]"

2) After the entire page is loaded, an onDomReady event is fired which 
find all href links with a rel attribute of lightbox[x] where x is some 
text.  The javascript code will then check to see if there is a 
thumbnail for the image[by checking for the same image name in a 
subdirectory called thumbs - if so, it changes the innerHTML to an img 
tag pointing to the thumbnail and sets the alt attribute for the 
thumbnail to the original text for the link.

3) Lightbox adds an event listener so that all clicks on any links in 
the page will now check to see if there is a rel=lightbox[x] attribute 
and if so, it aborts the normal click processing and instead sends it to 
the lightbox processing function instead to popup the lightbox.

Step 2 is entire client side processing which could be done by the 
server instead - ie the server could search the dom, find all those 
links, insert the thumbnail image directly and add an onClick even 
directly to the link.

Because of the way this is done, there are a number of problems this 
will cause in an application for slow connections or overloaded systems:

1) Users click on the links before the page finishes loading, this 
causes the page load to abort as the browser now goes to load just the 
image and users wonder why they can't see the product or add it to the cart.

2) Because the link is displayed as text and then swapped for a 
thumbnail, if the page does not finish loading poorly choosen text 
chosen to create on hover picture capturing is displayed as a link to 
the user causing confusion.

3) In complex CMS and Ecommerce systems, if there is a javascript error 
caused by some other module, the browser may abort processing all future 
javascript onDomReady events - so the lightbox enabling event may never 
be run.

Note: there are a large number of lightbox style javascript modules 
which use different attribute's and processes, they all do basically the 
same thing though and have the same type of potential problems.

There is no reason that when a PHP script generates HTML it should only 
go halfway in generating a functional page, and then send partially 
functional garbage to the web client and count on the web client to turn 
that garbage into a functional web page.  Without decent DOM 
manipulation it is easier to allow the client to make these changes.  
However, with PHP 5 and all the advances in PHP dom manipulation - it's 
now possible to send actually usable html code to a client and not count 
on javascript to convert it for you.

PS: This is a little 'known secret' (okay, not really) -- But if you really
want to have fun with DOM Manipulation; install Squid 3 and setup an ICAP
server --- GreasySpoon (http://greasyspoon.sourceforge.net/):

GreasySpoon is a real-time solution allowing you to easily manipulate Web
traffic on the fly.

By providing an embedded development framework, GreasySpoon can be used for
very simple usages up to extremely complex applications: HTTP anonymization,
tracking, access control filters, mashup services, Web Application firewall,
...

What makes GreasySpoon unique is that any code modification is applied in
real time, while providing an excellent performance level. You can in that
way easily build up, test and improve your services, then decide to use the
result in a production environment.
Inspired by Firefox GreaseMonkey extension, GreasySpoon supports various
"scripting" languages, like Java, JavaScript, Python or Ruby. Interfaced
with HTTP proxies like Squid, it runs transparently in the network and does
not require any specific modification on end-user devices. In that way, it
provides therefore multi-OS and cross-browser support.

GreasySpoon supports Java/javascript language per default, but can be easily
extended with other scripting languages: Ruby, Python, AWK, Groovy, etc.
Providing a web based interface, it tries to be as user-friendly as
possible, while keeping an eye on performance that makes it usable from
early prototyping stages up to production environment.

Fully developped in Java, GreasySpoon can be used on merely any platform and
has already been successfully tested with several ICAP clients: Squid 3.0,
Bluecoat ProxySG, Network Appliance Netcache and more.

This is a problem.  For javascript to detect if an image exists on the
server, it must do a HTTP request which takes ~100ms.  For PHP to
check if that image exists on the same machine, requires 1 sys call or
about ~0.01ms.  It sounds like you have a bad lightbox implementation.
 The page should already know if the thumbnail exists, and if a
lightbox is possible when the html is sent.

I think I've seen some lightbox versions that can work like Gary described, but they can usually also be configured to work off of existing thumbnail images that are already in the html.  For this task, I think you would be better off just outputting the thumbnails in the html (in your template or however you do it), rather than trying to parse the DOM after the fact and add them in.  A viable use for DOM manipulation in php is when you need to work with html not under your control (for example, read an html file off an external server and extract data from it).

    Greetings All,

  For a "small" business with only a few products, I find PHP ecommerce applications to be overly complicated and complex.

  SimpleCart works very well from a small business perspective:
  http://simplecartjs.com/

  If your sister is editing her items directly, it just means you add a little html markup to each item to make it an item which can be purchased.

  There are a number of PHP scripts which have been written for different platforms to make creating products simpler[for example, RokCart is a simplecart implementation for Joomla! which adds a button on content editing to set the price and such and create a product.

  The downside of simplecart is that because it is all done via javascript -  there is very little you can do to stop malicious buyers.  If a buyer can edit the javascript, they can go ahead and change the prices on the products and then submit the sale and it will be processed.  This means your sister would need to make sure to check the sales invoices in Paypal before shipping products and make sure the price is correct.  Full fledged ecommerce solutions often have this type of functionality built in - they check invoice information returned by paypal and make sure it is valid - and flag invalid transactions.

  It's a low end solution, but honestly I've run into a lot of people who only get 3 or 4 sales via the internet a month.  Spending lots of time and/or money to implement a high end ecommerce application is a waste.  If/When business takes off and it is taking too much time to process the orders is when you upgrade[preferably to something that will support something like Amazon Fulfillment so that you can automate the entire process at some point].

  Not knowing what business your sister is in, another thing I'll mention is to think very hard about whether or not to have a 'pick up' option for purchases and if so, set a reasonable shipping and handling cost.  As an example, a small art Gallery which expects to sell mostly within 200 miles can be better served by offering local pick up and placing a 50-100$ handling charge on shipping paintings.   If you can get the buyer into the gallery, then you have the chance to cross-sell other items.  If you ship the item, it's a one time 500-1000$ sale AND packaging the whole thing up properly is a pain.  So charge for that pain/inconvenience and encourage buyers to come to the store.

Preface - it is not my intention to start a language debate or anything like
that.  I just want to offer another alternative.

That being said, if you are familiar with Python, I've found the Satchmo
ecommerce framework to be quite good for handling small-medium sized shops.
The configuration out of the box is quite manageable, but the design and
such falls apart a little bit once you hit the larger sized stores (at
least, in my opinion).

If it's a really basic shop without too many over-the-top features, you
_might_ even be able to get away with just installing satchmo and just
overriding the default templates.  I deployed a very basic shop wihtout
touching too much python (although, I made a few patches to the project to
accomplish that).

I created www.topdogwear.com on Satchmo, and there are a host of other
satchmo shops you can look at on their home page.  Hope this helps!

I'm having a problem with spam bots and am currently research how to 
build an effective rate limiter for our sign up form.  Currently I am 
leaning towards IP based limits (with a certain time criteria).  Has 
anyone ever had problems with this type of rate limit and corporate 
proxies/firewalls where every user has the same IP address?  Also if 
anyone has any interesting articles about this type of rate/velocity 
limiting I would be interesting in learning more.

Hello Anthony, 

Have you implemented CAPTCHAs?If you have not, that might help curb some of the automated account creation. Also, you could add in an email verification step to the account sign-up process.

Can you give more details on what techniques you've tried and what (if any) framework or libs (cake, zend, etc)
you might be working with.

As far as rate limiting via IP, not sure, but you can imagine how that could lead to DoS for some clients behind a large corporate IP or ISP. I'm not sure what the de facto timeout it is for that sort of setup or how the software should handle it. Does this site receive "high traffic?" or traffic from only one company or subnet? Or is this a site accessible to all?

Good luck!

- Ben

Are you expecting a dozen people from the same company to try to sign up 
all at once?  If it's from your own company, either take it off the 
limit (exit the function if the IP is your company's) or set the site up 
so it can see the internal IPs of those users and don't limit internal IPs.

I don't limit internal IPs, but external ones either need to use a 
CAPTCHA or the rate is limited, depending on the site.

I signed up for ReCaptcha via Google and have implemented it 
successfully.  I was hesitant to use it based on the ease of which it 
can be defeated by OCR software but it is getting harder and harder for 
bots as well as humans to decipher the images.  I am going to seriously 
consider (well more like definitely implement but just have to plan it) 
email verification.  The ReCaptcha is coupled with Zend Framework.  I 
extended the Zend_Service_ReCaptcha class ass I wanted to provide a 
custom theme for the class and I do have to say that it is working out 
quite well.

I do also see now how IP limiting would definitely lead to DoS for some 
clients and the site is accessible to all.  I plan to write up how to 
extend the Zend class at the end of the day.  I'll post a link to my 
blog by the end of the day.

Hey,

Not sure if there are any other PHP on windows guys out there, but I just
found out that you could run PHP on IIS Express, which means you can develop
PHP from Visual Studio. I just got it working on a coworkers machine.

I've been running PHP on an Apache server on a Win2k box for years.  I 
wouldn't use Visual Studio to write PHP code, though - that's like 
killing flies with a cannon.  Notepad's a little too light, but 
Notepad++ or, the one I use, Edit Plus, are more than enough for web 
development.

Of course I come from the days when "backup your work" and "remember 
what you wrote" meant the same thing.

I'm developing an enterprise PHP application that runs on IIS and MS SQL
Server.  Development is on a XP box using IIS 5.1 (not my ideal choice, but,
that's what I given to work with onsite).

We write our application code in Netbeans 7.0 which wonderfully supports PHP
5.3 + javascript, HTML and SQL.  And it's free.  And you can configure
Netbeans to work with several different version control solutions, too.

At home I mostly do .NET OSS coding, and at work we have an MSDN
subscription, so Visual Studio is a sunk cost or already paid for. I also
have a tendency to do polygot programming where I have WCF services doing
data access, and returning business object. My php code make soap calls and
my javascript makes json calls to these services and takes care of the front
end. I love C#, WCF, and Smarty, but hate ASP.NET webforms.

I've done the eclipse thing and toyed with netbeans, but desktop java apps
annoy me for some reason. Notepad++ is cool used it at an old job. For
editing PHP I use Visual Studio, gvim, vim or the editor in FAR (
http://www.farmanager.com).

My php/.NET combination projects are the ones where being able to test on
IIS Express is the big deal to me. However, I actually discovered this
yesterday helping a coworker out. Also, the real interesting thing is
Microsoft WebMatrix support PHP and .NET out of the box.

Out of curiosity why not IIS? Does apache perform better? Also, if you
actually benchmarked it, have to tried again recently on a modern version of
Windows and PHP? Microsoft has put a lot of time into making PHP suck less
on Windows. If you use FastCGI as opposed to ISAPI and an un-threaded 32-bit
build of PHP, IIS performance is really good.

I never put PHP on Apache for windows and IIS in a head to head comparison
though. I always did PHP on IIS because when in Rome ....

For a number of reasons, most of our web servers are *nix, so for the 
one box that had to be Windows (no way to talk to RDB7 on a Vax from 
*nix at the time), I kept to the same server.  We do have a few boxes 
running IIS, but to me that feels like wearing a skirt - it's something 
someone else does.  Nothing wrong with it, I just don't do it.

I've never done a head-to-head, and I'm sure microsoft.com runs on IIS, 
but there's another aphorism - if it's not broke, don't fix it.

Message-ID: <CAAKrFTzmqne7pRB9ezDDe5GgNbgiuFkien6tD11Wjktw30xGrA@mail.gmail.com>

Does any one have a *spare* laptop they could loan another developer?

I just replaced my laptop that had died on Saturday with a used IBM ThinkPad
T60 1952-CTO, (I know old, but I just use Fluxbox and Linux for basic shell
and vim).

Unfortunately, The ThinkPad's motherboard died Sunday night and this has
completely killed almost my entire week; and I am a bit worried and was
wondering if any one could help with a spare laptop that they could loan or
donate to a good LAMP/Web/PHP developer.  I have coded over half of my life
in LAMP, PHP... But haven't had a good paying job since 2008.  I have been
doing research and more general non-paying projects for fun the past 3
years.

I need a job bad; and I also have rent coming up.  Could any one help with a
laptop donation?  I live in Flushing, NY --- but would really like to meet
any one any where in New York or Long Island.  I don't have a car, but can
take the trains.  PS I don't even have a phone now so I am in quite bad
shape -- I really do need to get a job ..... I am a startup /
entrepreneurial type person people say or it is true; but I haven't been
able to execute on anything; and slowly (amazingly) ran out of money...  Can
any one help me?

I will send you my actual resume if you ask me for it; as well.

Thanks,
Matt

Matt, I have a desktop I that I don't use anymore.  

Is that something that you could use?

Hi Ben :),

I am so glad that I have been on this list then.  I love the T60's honestly;
or at least the ThinkPad's.

I will definitely ping you, at the minimum to say Hello and add you to my
contact list permanently.

David,

It is something I could use; but I am in a pretty temporary apartment right
now; and I don't have any external monitors and I am usually on the go more
than not.

FYI for the list: Just to narrow down on location: I live in Flushing, NY
right now off of Main Street on the 7 line.

I am so happy to see the replies here; everyone; thank you. Also; I was
embarrassed slightly at first to mention: But here is my resume:

Tom,

Regarding "current or new ideas" -- Well That is what I have spent the past
3 years on.

I definitely have isolated too much unfortunately (and un-intentionally ---
the past 3 years; and without realizing it I actually feel like I have
fallen out of contact with the world).

However: Cool --- Any VC or "Entrepreneur" or "CTO" in New York just is full
of fluff lately.

PS: I live on Sanford Actually (whether fortunately or not).

 TOM:

Whatever job you are at; I don't know -- But your work sounds very cool.
Have you ever seen IBM XIV? http://xivstorage.com

*(from your blog: [http://supertom.com/]) -->
*
*
*I?m building the Hadoop cluster, storage and serving layers from scratch,
everything from design to deployment, and much of the code that runs on it.*
*Lots and lots of data, and using Hadoop to process image data is
largely-uncharted water at this point.*
*Lots of code to be written - in addition to the above, I?m helping out the
flight software team in building the encoder that converts the human
readable command manifest into the bits that get radiated to the satellite.*
*This industry is completely new to me, which makes it fun and interesting.
I know nothing about space, aeronautics or mechanical engineering. They?ve
already let me have at it with some of the tools (they obviously don?t know
me too well) and I haven?t hurt anyone yet. *

All the same, if you need a monitor, I have a spare one which I was about 
to throw out. It works fine, I just dont use it anymore.
