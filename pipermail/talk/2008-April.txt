They mix Okay, but don't communicate well without effort.

The reason for this is simple -- just before a web page is delivered 
to a users browser all of php's work is done and as the web page 
loads in the browser, then javascript's work starts.

Communication between the two languages is a question of timing.

Ajax is simply javascript sending data (via POST or GET) to a slave 
php script, which in turn provides data back to the web page without 
the need for a refresh.

The communication is exactly the same as if you were using a form 
minus the refresh.

The problem, of course, is that javascript has security issues and 
some users would rather have a refresh than risk security.

Javascript and php can play well together as this demonstrates:

But, it's not simple.  :-)

I can think of a half a dozen solutions for sending data from
javascript back to the server, below are three.

1) Have javscript set a cookie:
<script>
var clienttime = ... // long caluculation
setCookie('ct',clienttime,365);
</script>

2) Have javascript send the data as a get variable (you could also
auto submit a form if you want POST)
<script>
var clienttime = ... // long caluculation
window.location = "myscript.php?ct=" + clienttime;
</script>

3) Ajax assuming jQuery
<script>
var clienttime = ... // long caluculation
$.get('myscript.php',{ct:clienttime},function (data) {
  alert("script said: " + data);
});
</script>

The cookie method will make the data available to the Server on the
next page view.
The second method will auto redirect and be really sloppy, but it is
the easiest to understand conceptually.
The Ajax method is the best, but will be a real pain in the ass to
implement without a javascript library.

Even though the second method is the worst from a UI perspective, I'd
recommend you implement it first so you better understand the problem.

Why so?

I do Ajax all the time with a simple 50 line javascript routine. No 
large libraries.

Check this:

http://www.webbytedd.com/b/ajax/

It has one 50 line javascript routine, one 75 line slave php script, 
and a very simple html.

Ajax can be very simple.

Cheers,

tedd

No doubt but that PHP can be a prolific author of Javascript without things
becoming overly complicated. Lately I have been using a home-grown
PHP/Javscript helper for Ajax contexts. It emits a content-type:
application/javascript header upon instantiation and has some convenience
methods that echo javascript snippets for the browser to execute.  I can say
$js->message('Foo!") and the element whose id is 'message' is updated to say
Foo!

I don't understand. Is this supposed to indicate that PHP is somehow
inefficient at storing array elements?

"a single integer value stored within an PHP array uses 68 bytes: 16
bytes for value structure (zval), 36 bytes for hash bucket, and 2*8 =
16 bytes for memory allocation headers."

That sounds fairly reasonable to me.

Note that each element does not incur a hash bucket. The bucket holds
a list. The blogger just wasn't smart enough to insert enough elements
to see elements hash to the same bucket.

You're not the only one that isn't following the inference/point here.

What would be an example of a real-life application of array usage that 
would be rendered faulty/unstable due to this limitation?

Wasn't it you who suggested an image hack to avoid the complexity of XML-HTTP?

Your code is fine for trivial example pages, but would be a disaster
for a production application.
1) The use of the global 'http' is sloppy and limiting.
2) You need to highlight the selected menu after the callback
completes.  Your coding style will quickly become a mess of
document.getElementByIds().
3) You use browser detection... you should use object detection.  A
try/catch block is a good idea in your case.
4) Your implementation breaks the back button.
5) Clicking the currently selected navigation element causes
unnecessary requests.

With a library, I can fix all of these issues and cut the amount of
code down from 50 lines to 10 lines.  If you were to fix these issues
yourself, your code would grow to more than 250 lines.

Hello,

If anyone is truly interested in the internals of php (the c code and 
data structures) take a look at the book
"Extending and Embedding PHP". Its got lots of source.

If you don't know c, its not that helpful and will be a challenging read.

Hi

 All I am trying to do is transfer the data and time from the client machine 
upto the server. The goal is to create a MySQL record by customer number and 
store both the client time/date and server time/date for each new record 
created .

Why not just store the client time zone and store server data/time??

That was just a simple example, here's a bit more complicated template:

http://webbytedd.com/a/ajax-site/

But, to add another page is trivial -- so, I think production for a 
typical site would hold up.

Open to be shown.  :-)

You said:

>4) Your implementation breaks the back button.

Only because there's no history. If you access it via here:

http://webbytedd.com/a.php  (last item on the right)

You'll have back history.

Yeah, that's one of my pet peeves too. I just didn't fix it. It's 
easy enough via:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Passing JAVASCRIPT variables to PHP
Message-ID: <1207092152.2241@coral.he.net>

One of the projects I inherited recently contains the following code 
which is used basically to store the record ID and editstate in the 
URL's querystring.  When I first saw it, I was scratching my head 
saying, why would anyone think they needed to do it this way?  

(My preferred way to store data such as this would be in hidden fields 
which are submitted with the form, but I do realize that everyone has 
different coding styles.  And mind you, they do have hidden fields 
which do contain IDs for other purposes...)

The script in the document head is

<script language="javascript">
function jfunc(arg){
	window.location='thissamedocument.php?id='+arg+'&edit=false';
}
</script>

and then throughout the page this script is called by echoing the 
following:

                echo "<SCRIPT LANGUAGE='JavaScript'>\n";
		echo "javascript: jfunc(" . $whateverID . ")\n";
		echo "</script>\n";

Would love to hear any and all comments on the above vis a vis this 
discussion.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Bizarro Bug trying to insert after using
	mysql_insert_row
Message-ID: <1207105068.2075@coral.he.net>

I'm pulling out the ID of the previously inserted row and then 
inserting that as a lookup value in a duplicate row (two rows one for 
edit mode one for published mode).  

Various other places in the app this works fine and there really isn't 
any reason this should be happening.

The query runs fine if I do it from within phpMyAdmin -- but from the 
PHP page the query does not error out but the value in the lookup field 
remains the default value (I've tried both an integer field with 
default value of 0 and a varchar field with default NULL, and in both 
cases the lookup id value will not save to the database).

Anyone ever heard of this happenning before?  I've examined the working 
code in other parts of this app and the related db tables and cannot 
see why this is occurring.

Thanks in advance for any help!

My guess is the programmer didn't understand the concept of a 302 header.

Excellent suggestion - However, for legal reasons it is important to capture 
the client time/date as it is always possible the date/time on the client 
machine has been altered and/or out of sync with the server time/date.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ajax and un-breaking the ol' back button
Message-ID: <721f1cc50804020653x637ef226s6c292bc80b76fbc3@mail.gmail.com>

So I had what I thought was a pretty cool ajaxified page where you could
browse data -- in this case, lists of events scheduled on a given date -- by
choosing a date with a popup calendar or clicking arrows to navigate forward
and back. The javascript callback sends an ajax request to update the
relevant part of the doc. Oh, but then you navigate to another page, then
click your back button and guess what, this page reverts to its defaults
instead of staying in the state you left it. Is this not an example of
breaking the back button?

Before I start trying to un-break it please tell me if this logic is sound:
when they do an ajax request, store the query params in the session.
Whenever they GET the page itself, look first for these session vars and use
them if they exist, else use the defaults.

Thanks!

You say you're using "mysql_insert_row."  I assume you mean PHP's 
mysql_insert_id() function.  If so, there are two possible bugs that come 
to mind.

1) The table in question does not have auto_increment set for the primary 
key on that table.  If that's not it...

2) The PHP code has a bug...

You say this same logic works on other parts of the site.  So, do the 
various parts of the site use the _same_ _exact_ files/lines/functions or 
do you have separate function/include/whatever for each section of the 
application?

If you're using separate code for different sections, obviously the PHP 
code you're using for the problematic insert is where the bug is.  
Perhaps the variable you assign the id to is different than the variable 
you're using as the lookup value in the second query.

Again, if you're using separate code, you should refactor the system to 
allow you to use the same code for the same purpose throughout the 
system.

Yes, sorry, I meant to say mysql_insert_id and corrected myself (it was 
late and I was working on this nonstop).

The ID value is correctly returned and the INSERT string builds 
correctly, so those are not the problems.  For whatever reason, after 
the INSERT is processed, the field that should contain the ID of the 
last record is not updating but remains the default value.

I inherited the system from others to debug, and because this is the 
last functionality that needs to be delivered before completion.  My 
best guess is that it might be something in the table structure that 
I'm missing, I've set up two fields one varchar and one int(11) to try 
to capture the returned ID value.  Both remain blank at this point.

I highly doubt that.  It's a bug in the code.

Perhaps the you're mistakenly running the initial SQL insert string again 
as the second mysql_query() call?

Perhpas the column names and values defined in the second SQL string are 
misaligned?

I'd delete all records from the table.  Do a save from the web form (or 
whatever).  Then look at what shows up in the database VERY carefully.

If that doesn't do it, if you haven't done so already, use your own 
function for running the SQL rather than calling mysql_query() directly 
throughout the code.  Then your central function can have a 
logging/debugging option.

What were we saying about how sometimes when we post to the list, we 
see what the problem is??????

In this case the problem is that I'm a MORON!!! I was calling $query1 
twice instead of calling $query2 in the second case....!!!

$result2 = mysql_query($query1)

{this is not the first time it took me hours to figure out that I was 
doing this....!!!  Hopefully the last time.)

Glad you figured it out.

Let me emphasize what was said in my prior email:

You need to use your own function for running the SQL rather than calling 
mysql_query() directly throughout the code.  Then your central function 
can have a logging/debugging option.

Message-ID: <1207151348.8408@coral.he.net>

One thing that I've taken away from this (aside from feeling like an 
idiot!) is that one reason for my introduction of these bugs is a 
holdover from my "ASP" coding style where I name each query $query1, 
query2, etc rather than what I see in a lot of PHP code I've inherited, 
where each query is simply named $query, even if there are 6 or 7 of 
them on the page.

What is the accepted best practice here?  I find it very confusing to 
try to read code with 16 items each named $query or $result, but 
my "ASP" style code is clearly introducing other editing issues.

Shows that using more descriptive variable names is a good idea, but since you 
inherited that code that advice goes to the other guy I guess.
I'm often overly verbose in my variable naming, but thankfully there is 
autocompleted in PHPEd. :)

Dan,

I will definitely take your advice on this!  Thanks!

Clearly the standard "or die" error handling isn't effective in cases 
where the syntax is correct, but the wrong query is being called in the 
code...especially in these cases where the queries are identical except 
for one variable value! -- logging which query is being called could 
save me hours of fun trying to overcome my own boneheadedness.

I generally wrap all database calls in API functions specific to the 
task being performed, i.e. get_patient_referrals_list(), 
put_private_transport_segment(), update_clinic_demographic().  That way 
the logging is specific to the task and any specialized processing that 
needs to be done to the data can be done in one place.

That's probably the easiest way to do it, if you're already using sessions.

You could also use js to write the current params directly to cookie.

I don't see how query1, query2 would be any more clear than just using
the same variable name.  Using the same variable name indicates that
the previous statement will not be used again and frees the memory.  I
prefer using names like $sql and $cursor over $query and $result,
because they are more accurate names.  It is clear that "sql" is a
string, and a "cursor" is a pointer to a result set, not actual data.

I use $sql for all queries.  It's short and to the point.  Plus it 
ensures you're running the most recenlty defined $sql and are not adding 
overhead with extra variables.  It also allows you to copy and paste the 
actual query execution line over and over and over without having to 
worry (which is probably how your bug got introduced).

Even if you want to give each query string a unique variable name, don't 
name them 1, 2, 3.  Give them real names that descirbe what they are.

That's good.  That still doens't obviate the need to have those functions 
then call one central function that actually runs the query.

I don't know if it is "best practice", but I give the query string variables 
descriptive names. Typically I use three variables for a SELECT query named 
such as
- $getcategoriesquery => that is the variable that holds the SQL query string
- $getcategoriesqueryrun => that is the variable that holds the return value 
from mysql_query()
- $getcategoriesqueryresult => this is typically an array that holds the 
currently read out row from which I would get the value to be added to the 
$categories array

I suspect this to be wasteful as PHP holds on to the variables even when I no 
longer use them within the script, but I found it to be really helpful when 
using the ....queryrun as a flag to decide if some query worked or generated a 
result when using it in an If block or such 50 lines further down. This 
verbose naming helps me a lot to figure out if the current value stored in a 
variable is plausible in regards to the variable name and the expected value.

I don't know if this is the best approach, but I am sure it is better than to 
name all queries $query or just to number them. Half a year from now nobody 
knows what the difference between $query5 and $query3 is unless the line where 
the SQL string is assigned is quickly found.

Back button navigation is specific to the window... cookies/sessions
are 1 per browser instance.  You will have a mismatch, but it may be
one you can live with.  The best way to do it is to save the query
parameters in the address bar.  In gmail, the page view information is
saved after the '#' sign.  Take a look at the jquery history plugin.

This works. It's kind of baroque, if not to say warped, but within a
controller method in a Zend Framework app, we go:


        $session = new Zend_Session_Namespace('Schedule');

        $params = (object) $this->getRequest()->getParams();
        $defaultParams = array(
            'language'=>'all',
            'date' => date('Y-m-d')
        );

        foreach ($defaultParams as $name => $default) {
            if (!empty($params->$name)) {
                ${$name} = $session->$name = $params->$name ;
            } elseif ($session->$name) {
                ${$name} = $session->$name;
            } else {
                ${$name} = $default;
            }
        }

       // then $date and $language get passed to data-fetching methods in my
model

Normally I wouldn't waste bandwidth with a "me too" response, but Dan's

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Passing JAVASCRIPT variables to PHP
Message-ID: <1207168433.17503@coral.he.net>

Paul,

Basically (at least IMHO), the best way for you to start thinking about 
solving problems of how to pass variables from let's say a document 
object back to the server to a PHP script (for instance the user system 
date & time as recorded by the document object as in your example) is 
for you to think in terms of using forms -- you can store your user's 
system date & time in the hidden field(s) and then when they submit the 
form, record it in the database, and it will be accessible to your 
server-side script after form submit.

The good part of hidden fields is it's easy to view the source and make 
sure your variables are where they should be.  The bad part is, 
obviously, you don't want to use them to store anything sensitive, 
confidential or that otherwise you would not want some savvy user who 
knows how to view document source to read, because they will be in 
there.

This is exactly the type of thing that I recall years ago trying to 
wrap my head around when I first started out.  (Now, I'm reduced to 
missing stupid bugs when I mistype a query name!!).

If you guys could point me in the direction of some online examples of 
how people modularize this type of code, I would be very grateful.  

I'm ready to take this to the next level (I just wish I could get back 
those 5 hours I wasted not seeing that I was calling the wrong query).

Dan,

That's how it got introduced for sure...I copy the $result line and 
then just increment the numbers [but forgot to increment the number of 
the query I was executing]...NOT going to do that any more... !

if the memory is freed when you reuse the variable names, then probably 
from a performance standpoint that is the best way to do it?

Hmm.

I've never had much need to generalize the database API functions more 
than that if I'm already wrapping them inside dedicated application API 
functions.  I always parameterize the queries so the only potentially 
reusable components would be:

   $result = pg_query_params($db, $sql, $array);

   if (!$result) {
      return array(false, pg_last_error($db));
   }

   $rows = array();

   while ($row = pg_fetch_assoc($result)) {
      $rows[] = $row;
   }

   return array(true, $rows);

But that's limiting as well because some queries are expected to return 
only one row, some return many rows, some result sets are enumerated, 
some are hashes, some need to return the exit code of a stored 
procedure, not the database function.  Also, I like the function to 
return database errors branded with the __FUNCTION__ or __CLASS__ name 
where the error occurred.

Attached is a radically stripped down version of the database class we 
used on a recent project.  It uses PHP's mysqli extension in 
object-oriented mode.

If you are opened for suggestions, you should give a try to Doctrine project.

http://www.phpdoctrine.org

Doctrine is a ORM tool for PHP.

IMHO, the only ORM tool that exists for PHP (I do not want to open
this thread for discussions, even Propel devs say their project IS NOT
an ORM tool). Also, I do not want to listen to small two-month only
projects.

Yep.  Which is another reason to use a database library rather than 
calling the database extension functions directly all over the place.  
When the DBMS changes, you (generally) only need to change your library, 
not every database function call throughout your entire application.

Forget everything about building your own store, STOP!

Go to amazon, use their new software for store building. DOES
EVERYTHING 10X  over.  Sigh, I'm out of business now.  14 years of
building ecommerce sites, they finally caught up with me, I can't
compete with them.  I guess that's a good thing.

:-)  ed

PS, hmmmmm, magento looks pretty cool however.

I can think of plenty of clients that would balk at a 7% commission.

Not to say the $59.99 per month plus the 7% commission. I would say charge
the 7% but no monthly fees that would be great. But monthly fees and
commissions that's a bit much.

I don't know about that, just because personally I don't shop at stores that
I think over charge for shipping and I don't think I'm alone on that one.

compelling to ignore.

I think there was an interesting study for ebay:

2 items, exactly the same:

1 is $100 with $10 shipping
1 is $90 with $25 shipping

The cheaper item with expensive shipping will consistently outsell the
higher priced item with less shipping costs - even though the cheaper
priced item will end up costing you more.  Just something hard-wired
in the brain.

That's why the 1 penny sellers on ebay make a killing.

Though it is a bit off topic, I suggest that you use one of the available
libraries out there, which will make things easier for you and make your
code more cleaner. Starting from cba.js, to prototype.js there are a whole
bunch

I highly recommend jQuery. I've used prototype/scriptaculous for a
while now but about three months ago I started working on a client's
project that was already using jQuery. I was sold on it and I
definitely plan on using it in the future.

XAJAX is also something worth looking into.

jQuery (http://jquery.com/) is the way to go with JS frameworks. I've  
used it extensively and even wrote a plugin (http://davehauenstein.com/blog/archives/28 
). But if you want to explore, i provided  list of some of the most  
popular JS frameworks. Have fun.

Some other good ones:
http://www.prototypejs.org/ along with http://script.aculo.us/
http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/
http://extjs.com/

I lost it. I just cannot see what I'm doing wrong. All the coding before 
Datum is just working out the date. the following snippet is where I am 
trying to upload the Javascript data to the server.

Paul

Datum = ( +Year+ '/' +Month+ '/' +Day+ ' - ' +Hours+ ':' +Minutes+ ':' 
+Seconds);

var $datum = Datum;
new Image()).src = 'http://www.localhost/showdatum.php?$datum='+"$datum";

</SCRIPT>
<FORM action="showdatum.php" method="post">
<input type='text' name='$datum' size='20'><br>
</FORM>
</BODY>
</HTML>

showdatum.php
===========
<?PHP $datum = $_POST['$datum'];
echo('$datum = ' . $datum . "<BR>"); ?>

You are passing your date variable into a querystring instead of into 
the form.  Therefore when you POST your form, the value is not there 
for the server side to read.  Also I don't believe you should use $ 
characters in your form field names, which in any event won't pass in 
the date value.

try something like this:

<input type="text" name="dateholder" value="<? echo $datum ?>" size=20>

Change the input type to "hidden" after you are seeing the date is 
populating in the form.

I'm see a lot of odd code in the past few posts. $'s mixed in with 
javascript and attempts to blend client side javascript variables with 
server side php variables. Misleading code that simply wont work.
Here's a working example for ya:

<html><head><title>test</title>
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
var date = new Date();
var d  = date.getDate();
var day = (d < 10) ? '0' + d : d;
var m = date.getMonth() + 1;
var month = (m < 10) ? '0' + m : m;
var yy = date.getYear();
var year = (yy < 1000) ? yy + 1900 : yy;
var hours = date.getHours();
var minutes = date.getMinutes();
var seconds = date.getSeconds();
if (minutes < 10) minutes = "0" + minutes;
if (seconds < 10) seconds = "0" + seconds;
var Datum = (year + "-" + month + "-" + day +' 
'+hours+':'+minutes+':'+seconds);
/* The below line submits the datetime as a GET request upon page load */
new Image().src = '/datetest.php?imgdate='+encodeURI(Datum);
</script>
</head>
<body>
clientdate=<?=$_REQUEST['clientdate']?><br>
<form method="post" action="" name="myform">
<!-- The line below sends the datetime upon form submit -->
<input type="hidden" name="clientdate" value="">
<input type="submit" onClick="document.myform.clientdate.value=Datum;">
</form>
</body>
</html>

The example sends the client date back to the server in 2 different ways.
The first is the img src method, which sends the data immediately after 
the page loads
the second is via the form in the hidden field.

Thanks, Jake--every review helps. The client accepted our estimate, so 
now I have to make a CMS choice. I installed Drupal & Joomla and am 
leaning heavily toward Drupal, but I have to do some more code exploring 
lest I end up in over my head.

 Yes, that is exactly what I thought I meant to explain about the 
hidden form... you can't pass the date directly into a PHP variable!  
So you'd have to use document.form.value...

In my defense I have a horrible hangover...? :)

I'd recommend finding some experienced person/agency to review your
plans and work as you go along, answering questions and keeping you
from making big mistakes. Maybe 5 hours a week.

My company does Drupal dev and would do this, but I'm just trying to
help, not pitch. So ask around, go to the local group meetings, etc
and try to find someone to help you have a easier time.

Hi Josh,

That's certainly something I'll keep in mind, but I think I'll be okay 
in the long run. It's inevitable that I'll make some mistakes, but I've 
always learned the most when doing so (and I hope the folks here will be 
kind enough to help me if I get completely stuck).

I padded my estimated hours by about 20% to account for unforeseen 
issues, so (hopefully) that should give me sufficient wiggle room. I 
have no problem working additional non-billable hours on my own time for 
the sake of learning.

I'm hoping to be able to make it to the upcoming April 21st presentation 
and meet up with some of the locals.

Regards,
Bev

Hi All,

I am trying to research about using website/data encryption methods or
approaches out there. Any tools that allows the web site data & db to be
encrypted. I've read about HTML protector (www.html-protector.com) - Anyone
use this type of tool?
What are the open source tools that can do this - if any? What are the
performance considerations? And, how would this type
of encrytion affect search engine rankings?

Would appreciate any comments/suggestions!

Joe,

This is a fools errand, in order for a web browser to display your page 
it must be able to download the html and assets (images, css, etc).

I took a quick look at 'html-protector' and was less than impressed. 
The 'protection' consists of using javascript to write the page from an 
obfuscated string.  The 'password prompt' is javascript also, and the 
password is present in the source.

The cost of all this 'security'? The page is invisible to search engines 
and won't work at all for people with javascript disabled.

If you want to obfuscate your html you can certainly make it (slightly) 
more difficult for people to 'Save Page As...', but the html is always 
going to be out there.

Dan

Hi Dan,

Thanks for your reply and comments.... I am not so much looking to have data
encrypted from the user. But, encryption on the "server side".... For
example, I want to be able to
encrypt a web site folder and DB and upload to my hosting provider and know
the data is
safe but will continue to serve users as normal.

I just read about TrueCrypt (http://www.truecrypt.org/) which is Open
Source. This could be what I am looking for. Anyone use TrueCrypt?

Joe

Hello Joe,

Take a look at ionCube encoder. I use this and it works great.

Well, you could wrap everything into PHP and use one of these PHP obfuscators. 
I haven't heard about encrypting the entire database, but you can for sure put 
some encryption on some fields (I wouldn't bother with an autoinc field).
Still, I wonder why you want to do that? Do you distrust your hosting company 
that much? In that case I'd look for a different provider.

Hi Josh,

That's certainly something I'll keep in mind, but I think I'll be okay 
in the long run. It's inevitable that I'll make some mistakes, but I've 
always learned the most when doing so (and I hope the folks here will be 
kind enough to help me if I get completely stuck).

I padded my estimated hours by about 20% to account for unforeseen 
issues, so (hopefully) that should give me sufficient wiggle room. I 
have no problem working additional non-billable hours on my own time for 
the sake of learning.

I'm hoping to be able to make it to the upcoming April 21st presentation 
and meet up with some of the locals.

Regards,
Bev

Well, I am not much of a php/programmer and don't know how and what it means
to "wrap everything into php".

Still, I wonder why you want to do that? Do you distrust your hosting

Well, I am just looking into a solutions to encrypt data. The question as to
why I would want to do that is not the question - But, thanks for asking.

What are you trying to protect and who are you protecting it against?


I'm looking to protect data/information that could be the software code
and/or customer's client info.. Protection should be from anyone who does
not need to have access to the website data or the DB... Of course, data
will be shown to users (web client) who has been given access to view this
data from the application.

What I am interested in is to find the most effective and most secure way to
upload my website & db to remote host and the data is fully protected by
encryption.

I will look into the ionCube suggested earlier - Though this seems to be a
PHP only base solution. From what I gather, a product like TrueCrypt could
be better as I can encrypt an entire volume or folder and it's done -
Regardless of type of code or application that exist or being encrypted.

I know many software type companies package there software where either
partially or fully the code is encrypted and protected. This is the similar
type of solution I guess I am looking for.

I think there's a little bit of shortsightedness going on here. If any 
reasonable security is to be expected, the entire system from start to 
finish must be evaluated. How much security do you expect? Who and what 
do you trust to be secure? Is your development PC secure? Could it be 
loaded with spyware that is sending your keystrokes off to the bad guys? 
Do you trust the guy/girl standing behind you looking over your 
shoulder? Do you trust the web host that manages your website's server? 
How about the server monkey managing the nightly backups? Or the hacker 
on your shared web host running the sniffer? Or the 13 year old from 
Hungary secretly running irc proxies on your dedicated host? Or the 
NSA's tap at AT&T's networks?  Could your client/customer's PC be 
infected with spyware? Could their neighbor be running a 
man-in-the-middle attack on the wireless network?  How about the guy 
physically standing behind him, or perhaps the nosy wife digging through 
her husbands Gmail account? My point here is that there are so many 
points at which the security of data could be compromised. Dan's 
question is extremely relevant and should be examined thoroughly if the 
true objective is to implement data security.

Unfortunately, for most people (including our government), the 
perception of security takes priority over actual security. Slapping an 
official looking "seal of security" gif on to the bottom of the web 
order form and maybe prepending "https" to the URL (regardless of what's 
running under the hood!) is often sufficient for the general population.

Hi Joe:

This is done by protecting access to the servers.

Encrypting the information is pointless because the data needs to be 
decrypted in order to be served to the viewers.

So, for example, you're talking about using TrueCrypt.  While that's a 
great tool, it doesn't accomplish anything for your purposes, because the 
volume will have to be mounted (decrypted) in order to serve it.  Once 
the volume is mounted, anyone with access to the server can read it.

If you're thinking of dynamically decrypting scripts, data, etc, on the 
fly, you'll need to have the keys and passwords stored on the server.  
Therefore anyone can use those to decrypt the stuff too.

It all comes down to server security.  This includes things like using 
encrypted means to access the machine and move files to/from it (SSH, 
SFTP, etc), keeping the software up to date, running firewalls, etc.

I mean that you need to use PHP to output static page content if you want to 
encode / obfuscate everything.

Well, the reason for me asking is that there may be a better approach than 
taking the big hammer. I speak from experience as I often use(d) the big 
hammer and everything was a nail.

So who is your hoster? Every thought about self-hosting or having the customer 
run the server? Any chance that this might work via intranet rather than 
internet, because then you probably want to add SSL to the pages. I do not 
know if that is difficult to do. But keep in mind, anything that is accessible 
via internet is not what I'd consider entirely secure.
I don't see why you need to protect the software code. PHP is server side only 
and the client doesn't see anything from your PHP code.
And yes, it is assumed that legitimate users are allowed to see information, 
otherwise the whole setup would be quite pointless.

As mentioned above, hosting something offsite and have it be available through 
the internet is IMHO not secure. Taking stuff can be made more difficult, but 
most secure....well, I leave that up to the experts, but I have my doubts - 
see Hannaford, TJX, etc.

Again, comes down to the hosting service that you have. Do you have that much 
access and rights to the server that you can just go ahead and run services 
that encrypt and decrypt entire folders?

Nah, most companies distribute binaries that make it difficult enough for 
people like me to re-engineer the code. But look at the open source security 
applications. Their code is freely available. Security through obscurity is 
one of the worst approaches.

I don't want to rain on your parade, but taking into account that you are "not 
much of a php/programmer" you may want to take a step back and think this over 
if that application is indeed that critical and demands such secrecy that code 
and database have to be encrypted. I play around with PHP for about five years 
now and I don't think that I'd be capable of writing a secure application. I'm 
not saying that you are not capable of that, but I have the impression that 
you think slapping some encryption onto something makes it secure.
I am also wondering a bit about your statement that you want "to find the most 
effective and most secure way to upload my website & db to remote host". So 
are you worried about encryption during uploading or about encryption while 
executing the scripts on the server and serving up content - or both? What 
other security measures did you include? Kaptchas? Multiple time-limited 
passwords? Multiple access levels? Effective session management to kick people 
out of the system after a few minutes of inactivity? Or even other means such 
as biometrics as identification? Your own certificate?
Also, does it have to be a web client? I'd guess there are way more and way 
better means to encrypt data when working with fat clients. Also, which 
database engine do you plan to use? Does that database engine have means to 
encrypt entire tables or data sets?
And what do you do for client security? There is not much gained when your 
server is like Fort Knox, but the users can access the application from any 
client on any network and then do so from theit favourite internet cafe, 
leaving the PC unattended while getting another beer. So you want to at least 
restrict the IP address (ranges) that are allowed to get even to the login page.

Sorry for asking that many questions, but I think those and many more 
questions need to be asked and sufficiently answered.

Wow, I really appreciate the feedback and some of the many comments i am
getting to my original question. I ask my original question not so much I
have some secrecy of any kind of application. As I mentioned, I'm not much
of a programmer in practice. I'm just getting interest in the encryption
technology as a whole and since I have not really used any of them I wanted
to get an idea how effective they are.

Now the feedback with the questions and comments I am getting are good, in
that, they make me think why would I use it and to achieve what purpose.
What I've been hoping to gain from asking my question is then why & when to
use such encryption tool - especially, when hosting your data remotely by a
hosting provider.

My thought is if encryption techniques like TrueCrypt works - Why not use it
regardless who is your hosting provider. Or, having to consider questions
like who you trying to protect data from. I mean, when you buy a nice bran
new expensive car you have a key to lock the doors and some go further to
put in a car alarm or car tracking device. Who you're trying to prevent from
stealing your car is no brainer question to consider - IMO. One knows that
locking the door and/or having a car alarm is a deterrent - Though not 100%
guaranteed. Maybe my example is not the best but just trying to raise a
point.

In my question to deploy some encryption on my data would (help) minimize
people stealing private data - Why not use it, especially if there's not
much performance penalty.

David, regarding you comments below:

> So are you worried about encryption during uploading or about encryption
> while executing the scripts on the server and serving up content - or both?
> What other security measures did you include?


You've hit the right questions I am looking to understand. The answer is
both. From what I understand about a tool like TrueCrypt I can encrypt say
my webfolder (web site) and upload it to my hosting provider. And, what I am
trying to understand is can the encrypted data remain encrypted and still
serve content. Or, once I upload the encrypted data must I need to decrypt
it to serve the content? I am not concern about data being encrypted out to
the users browser. SSL takes care of that - right? So, if it is that I can
encrypt and it remains encrypt while serving content then this is not a bad
solution. And, of course one can take other measures like ssh to the server
to actually keep access to it secure.

Here's another thought I wonder about encryption technology. Could one day
encryption technology replace the need for firewalls - either partially or
all together. Forget about those security policies, is my firewall
configured right, applying security patches & hardening the OS, etc... If
one can just encrypt there entire drive or the data needed to be protected
by encryption - Why need a fw if the data is garbled and useless to those
who can't decrypt it. Of course fw plays other roles but from a pure
"protect my data from the unwanted" to me encryption may solve that. Just a
thought!

In 99% of cases, there's no real argument for storing data on the server 
in an encrypted state.  This is because if your host security is 
compromised, the cracker will have your encryption keys as well as your 
encryption data.

Communicating with server (Administration, Uploading files, etc):  
SSH/SFTP. 

Data On The Server: Usually there is no good argument for encrypting 
it.  If you're going to be serving it to anyone, you'll need to decrypt 
it on the way out, so they can read it.  If the server can decrypt it, 
anyone who compromises the server can decrypt it, so it's useless and a 
waste of resources.

Server Communicating with Clients: use SSL.


The exception case:  You have a small group of users, to whom you want 
to make available some very secret data.  You don't want to do any 
processing of the data on the server.  You just want to upload an 
encrypted file, and have them download it (still encrypted).  This of 
course implies that you've somehow securely distributed the decryption 
key to your users.  This case almost never happens.  You'd be better off 
having your users generate GPG key pairs, send you the public key.  You 
encrypt for each user and send via email or any other method.  By 
leveraging public-key cryptography, you avoid the need to securely 
communicate any keys.

As others have implied, it would be a lot easier to answer your queries 
if we knew more specifics about what kind of data (and what kind of 
operations on that data) you're talking about.

But in almost every case, encrypting things on the server just chews up 
server resources while providing exactly zero protection.

Sure, as I mentioned in part of my last email, in some (few) cases this 
is fine.

That case is this:

    - I Have a bunch of secret data, in a file called "secrets.zip".
    - I encrypt that data with some strong encryption mechanism. 
    - I post that file on http://www.example.com/secrets.zip.gpg -- it 
is world readable.
    - I meet you in a dark alley, we exchange a secret handshake and 
password.  I hand you a thumb drive with the encryption key for the 
data.  (repeat for each person i want to give the key to)
    - You go download the data and decrypt it.

This is only marginally better than me giving you the data itself on the 
thumb drive, as it saves me future trips to the scary alley.

If we use public-key cryptography, we can do away with the meeting in 
the alley, though then I'd have to make a version of the encrypted file 
for each recipient.

Firewalls are always going to be a fact of life, though they aren't 
really necessary in any way relevant to the above scenario.  Well, at 
least for the server that's serving the files..  Of course, if your 
machine where you're doing the decrypting is compromised, then the 
hacker gets your key. Then they can go download the data from anywhere 
and decrypt at will.

At the end of the day, encrypted data is useless unless at some point it 
gets decrypted.  Any machine that will do the decryption (and therefore, 
even momentarily, hold a copy of the key and/or the unencrypted data) 
needs to be suitably secured. 

A machine that's *only* purpose is to hold the data in encrypted form 
you could probably care less about.  Unless it's the ONLY place where 
the data is stored, in which case a malicious individual could destroy 
your data, even if they can't steal it.

Ah, so you are not really creating a PHP application, but only want to inquire 
about encryption technologies? While that is a valid question to ask, you 
seemed to be asking more for an entire protection package, which encyption is 
only a small part from. I used to work for a company that makes electronic 
locks. A simple battery powered mortise lock starts at 1,000$. I once was 
asked by an IT services manager at a university which lock I recommend they 
put on the server room. I told him that it doesn't matter as long as the walls 
are made from sheet rock and one can just crawl in through the plenum anyway. 
The way I see it, the lock is the encryption piece you are looking for, but 
you don't ask about the fact that physical access to the server is easy and 
that someone even left a cart right next to it.
If you want to learn about encryption technology I'd recommend a walk to the 
local library and take a look at what they got. After that a good question to 
ask is who on this list made use of encryption technologies. You may also want 
to contact the various encryption tool vendors, but be warned that they will 
mail you constantly their marketing garbage. I did that once because I wanted 
to get a free 512MB USB drive. VeriSign still owes me the drive, but they make 
sure that my recycling bin is full.

Ah, ok, but repeating myself here, only looking at encryption when using 3rd 
party hosting is really not the right approach in my opinion. You also need to 
see that the database and the web server are not necessarily on the same 
system. And you look only at file encryption as it seems, you need to look at 
data transfer encryption as well, which is a different animal and depends on 
what the server and client is. When the client is a browser you likely will 
have less choice of what kind of encryption you can use. Also, I mentioned 
obfuscation earlier, which is not the same as encryption. And you need to ask 
if encryption is really necessary and if you can secure the systems by other 
means as effectively.

Well, encryption comes at a cost, the performance of the entire system will go 
down and that may require that you create parallel system(s) to handle the 
load. Things get really complicated then.
Besides that, I always leave my car unlocked. Want to steal my crappy 29.99$ 
radio? Go right ahead. Gives me a reason to buy a better one. But please don't 
smash a window, which is way more expensive to replace. Or take the entire car 
and please don't have police find it. I have a cheap car that brings me from A 
to B. I just don't see the point in expensive cars who have big engines, are 
heavy and use excessive amounts of gas - but I guess that is not the point of 
this discussion.

Why would encryption help when I can take the entire server and take my time 
decrypting the data? Or if I can use some off the shelf equipment from 
RadioShack and software off the web to capture and decipher the EMF from the 
client's mouse, keyboard and monitor? Tests have shown that one can read input 
and output this way from an office across the street.

The way I understand it is that you can encrypt it once it is at your provider 
and need to decrypt it once you want to use it. At least that is what I got 
from the articles I read in the past, but I haven't read any more technical 
info about it. But uploading an encrypted folder requires that the hosting 
provider has servers that can decrypt the folder. Again, I don't think that 
file encryption is really the thing to look first at.

You need to decrypt it at some point, the latest is at the client, unless you 
find persons that can decrypt digital data on the fly. I don't think these 
persons exist.

i don't know what SSL takes care of, but I don't think that SSL is what is 
used for file encryption. As mentioned before data transfer encryption and 
file encryption are two different things.

Say, you aren't writing some paper for the school that is due tomorrow, do you?

Hi Tim,

Thanks for your reply and comments. The comments so far from the list has
enlightened me  a lot on this topic. And, I thank all for there comments!

The missing piece of info I guess I did not realize is that if I encrypt
some drive or part of it like folders or some system volume that I had to
have the decryption keys as part of it. I thought the keys was encrypted as
well. And, the only time it could be decrypted is by me.
So, If I wanted to modify and update the encrypted data I would then
download it back to my machine and decrypt it and make whatever changes and
upload it back to the server. While uploading and downloading the data it is
already in encrypted form.

And, my understanding was that new data that is saved/updated by users would
be encrypted on the fly. Encrypted data that leaves the server would be
decrypted BUT then with SSL only the user would see the requested data. This
was my understanding of what tools like TrueCrypt does. So, I think I'm
totally missing the point of the product.

For questions/comments about what kind of data I need to protect is hard to
answer as I don't have any specific data in mind. I'm more interested in
understanding the technology - regardless of data. But, to try and answer
that I would say any kind of typical web based application - but nothing
specific.

Joe

That sounds correct.  In this scenario, you're just using the server as 
a file server.  Since your data are encrypted before leaving your 
machine, you don't need to worry about encrypting it (again) in transit.

This is where things get tricky.  If your users are submitting data 
(over SSL), and the server is encrypting it for storage, you can use a 
symmetric key pair, with only the encryption key on the server (you keep 
the decryption key secure at your location).

Things break down, however, when you want to give other users access to 
the data.  Now, the server needs to decrypt the data before sending it 
(which involves encrypting it via SSL, but you need unencrypted data to 
feed to the SSL mechanism).  Now, even with symmetric keys, you need 
both keys on the server.  Once you have encrypted data + the decryption 
key on the server, the encryption is meaningless, since if anyone 
compromises the server, they have all the information they need to 
decrypt the original data.

Generally, if you're trying to communicate sensitive information via a 
web based application, you want to look at the following areas:
    - The host security of the server.  Is the box hardened?  Are you 
running old, vulnerable versions of server software?  Do you have a 
strong password policy, or are you using SSH keys for authentication? Do 
you trust the people who have physical possession of the server?
    - The security of whatever web-based application is managing the 
data.  If I can break your web-app, then I can steal your data (even if 
it's encrypteded on disk!)
    - The protocol security of the protocols used to communicate with 
the server.  You should be using SSL (for web) and SSH (for shell access 
and file transfer services) -- otherwise you run the risk of a 
man-in-the-middle stealing your passwords, and subsequently your data.

If those three areas are properly addressed, you should be fine. 

If the data is encrypted on disk, that's fine -- but as soon as one of 
the above three is broken, your on-disk encryption is essentially 
worthless.  Which of course means that before any of those are broken, 
it's probably meaninglessly redundant.

Note, there's a forth concern: The security of the people who are 
allowed access.  Are you sure that user X isn't actually a spy.  This 
gets into the Authorization problem, which is probably going to get 
handled in your web app.  If you can limit people to accessing only the 
data they need, you limit your exposure.  This is a non-trivial problem, 
but there's a lot of good reading you can do about it.

Thanks to all who have replied and commented to my questions. To Tim and
Dave, thanks for the input - your comments have all helped me to understand
quite a few things about the encryption. I think I've just graduated
encryption 101:) with much more to learn. Again, thanks for everyones

Hi there:

This just feels like one of those questions that would have been asked  
a million times, but looking at the web site, it appears that the  
archives of this list are not searchable?

Anyway, it can still be worthwhile to ask the same question again, I  
suppose, because new projects come along, and others get improved or  
die.

So, the question is: can anyone recommend a good library for exporting  
MDB or XLS files from PHP?  I'm in a situation where I'd prefer an  
access dump, but an excel dump could possibly work.

I'm googling away, as well, but hoping for some bona fide firsthand  
recommendation from someone who maybe does this a lot (I don't).

Cheers.

PHP has ODBC support and may even have support to talk to Access directly, but 
that may require working on a Windows box. Or you could write everything to a 
CSV and pull that in.

You can search ANY site with google:

You can use Google to search only within one specific website by 
entering the search terms you're looking for, followed by the word 
"site" and a colon followed by the domain name.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP and MySQL Connections
Message-ID: <a9caffe50804110351i527bed4fn4fb3a63c13551b85@mail.gmail.com>

We have been having some performance issues on one of our larger
sites, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about fixing
them. We use the adoDB abstraction library. Since day one, we've used
persistent connections, and I think that might be at least part of the
problem. So if I switch from the persistent connection, PConnect() to
the non-persistent, Connect(), I want to make sure of one particular
thing:

My understanding is that PHP automatically cleans up a database
connection after it has executed the query. Therefore, I don't need to
use the close() function. Is that correct?

On a related note, our main issue is that the site keeps slowing down
and we are getting a 'Too Many Connections' error from MySQL. I had
the number of connections increased from 100 to 150 on both Apache and
MySQL two weeks ago, but we are still having the problem, although
less frequently. One thing I'd like to be able to do is check how many
connections have physically been made to the database. I did this a
couple of weeks ago, but now I can't find the MySQL query returns that
information. If anyone could throw that out to me, I'd greatly
appreciate it.

Most common problem I see is a database that is not optimized or a sql 
server that is just underpowered (not enough cpu, ram, or disk i/o 
bandwidth .. usually it's the latter 2).  If the database can be 
optimized, you will likely not need to upgrade the hardware.

First, examine your queries to see what is slow:
When your website begins to die, check the mysql process list
mysqladmin -p processlist
You'll probably see a list of queries that are taking a long time. These 
will eventually build up until you reach "Too Many Connections".
You can also enable "--log-slow-queries" in mysql to log the slow 
queries to a file.
Track down the queries, prune your tables, add indexes, or rewrite the 
sql properly to speed things up.

You can tweak the my.conf  mysql config file settings to get a little 
better performance but the underlying problem is usually something more 
serious. If it all looks good, next blame the hardware.

Good tools to monitor ram and disk i/o usage using vmstat and iostat.

Leave "vmstat 5" running to see if your machine has run out of memory 
and is swapping pages to disk. This is often the tipping point leading 
to meltdown. The "cpu wa" column will show amount of time in wait state. 
if this is high, you've likely run out of disk bandwidth
Time to buy more or faster hard drives or break the app apart into a 
cluster of machines.

So, we're hiring a new webmaster here at work and I was tasked with 
producing a simple technical test. The person is supposed to have two 
years experience as a web dev. There's three parts: html, css, and 
webmaster questions. What do you think?
(bonus: I'll tell you what my manager thought)

HTML

1) Which HTML attribute is used to define inline styles?
       a) font
       b) styles
       c) css
       d) text
       e) style

2) What is the correct HTML for referring to an external style sheet?
       a) <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mainstyle.css">
       b) <style src="mainstyle.css">
       c) <stylesheet>mainstyle.css</stylesheet>
       d) <link url="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mainstyle.css">

3) Which HTML tag is used to define an internal style sheet?
       a) <script>
       b) <css>
       c) <stylesheet>
       d) <style>

CSS

4) Which is the correct CSS syntax?
       a) body {color: black}
       b) body:color=black
       c) {body:color=black}
       d) {body color:black}

5) How does one set a border like this:

    The top border = 10 pixels, The bottom border = 5 pixels, The left
border = 20 pixels, The right border = 1pixel.

       a) border-width:10px 20px 5px 1px
       b) border-width:10px 1px 5px 20px
       c) border-width:10px 5px 20px 1px
       d) border-width:5px 20px 10px 1px

6) What are the three methods for using style sheets with a web page
       a) Dreamweaver, GoLive or FrontPage
       b) In-Line, External or Embedded
       c) Handcoded, Database-driven or WYSIWYG

PROGRAMMING

7) a and b are variables.

    a = 10
    b = 20
    a = b

    The new values of a and b are, respectively:

WEBMASTER

8) What factors determine your recommended maximum home page size (in
kilobytes)? How are the factors related?

9) Why use Flash in web development? Why not?

10) Why is "separation of style and content" recommended in web
development?

I'd only keep the last two questions:

9) Why use Flash in web development? Why not?

10) Why is "separation of style and content" recommended in web
development?

I think the other questions would be incredibly ineffective in
determining the abilities of a possible employee. All of them could be
picked up in a matter of hours, while the knowledge and experience
required to answer the last two questions is a far better indicator of
of a talented developer. Also, an inability to answer any one of the
CSS questions wouldn't necessarily be an indication of lack of talent,
I think it took me quite a few months to stop checking my CSS cheat
sheet before I memorized Top Right Bottom Left!

Any webmaster/developer with two REAL (full time tech company) years
of experience would be able to have a much more in depth conversation
about web design philosophy, best practices and commonly accepted
methods of accomplishing a given task. This worksheet looks like it
might be appropriate for 1. Straight out of college or 2. Hobbyist web
developer (no CS degree). I'd take the requirement of 2 years off, so
that you attract inexperienced but technically talented recent grad
and hand them an O'Reilly book on day one.

Hello,

I think that the border question is a little specific.  I never memorize
order of parameters,  I learn the concepts behind it.  Knowing which
position comes first in a border-width command doesn't really demonstrate
your knowledge of css.

I think a better question would be something for inheritence of css, and set
up something with

.foo {
    font-size: 10px;
    color: #14191D;
}

    .foo .bar {
        font-size: 15px;
        text-decoration: underline;
     }

<div class="foo">
 // blah blah
 <div class="bar">Hello World</div>
</div>

What attributes will Hello World have on the screen?

correct answer being font-size 15px, underline, and color #14191D.

To get good programmers and designers, the trick is to not test them on
things like syntax.  I consider myself to have a strong command on css and I
would never know the answer to the question to your border problem, as it
really doesn't hold any meaning.  I take 1 minute out of my day to go to
www.w3schools.com and look up the syntax and I've got it.

For your programming question, I think someone without programming
experience could get that :)

I'm a big fan of the fizzbuzz question:
http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html

It's a very simple test that will quickly show to you if someone has basic
programming skills.

Hope that helps

Too focused on CSS.

HTML is simple, and as you may see, you asked 3 questions, all of them
CSS related. Try something more difficult too... one example:

<input> is a block element or an inline element?

A single programming question and very simple one. Anyone that has a
minimal understand of logic is able to answer that. Put another one,
more complex... try 2 questions...
You should try something to be more written and programming focused
too. Try for example to ask for a basic task... for example, given a
number, return only the prime numbers.
This will request the applicant to think a little, but the solution is
far simple.
Another good way is to do the opposite... put a piece of code and ask
for the applicant what does it do, what does it return given "these"
parameters...

About CSS... you could merge 4 and 5 together... =)
Question 6 is ok...

I think you can try something harder in CSS..... =)


About webmaster question... question 8, ok.
Question 9 I'd answer:

Why use Flash?
There's no need to use flash anywhere.
Why not?
Everything that is possible to be done in Flash is possible to be done
with the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

As you may see, the question is rather vague... a designer could tell
you Why use: Because you do not need to rely of browser
inconsistencies. Why not: Flash app size.

Question 10 is ok.


That's my 2 cents.... =)

I used this to write excel files:

it will do multiple workbooks, which was the only advanced feature i 
needed besides just writing data into rows/cols
Not sure if this will work for you..

This one i used for reading excel only:

Right on, Jake.
For me the truly relevant questions are 7 to 10. I was hoping 1-5 might 
just give the hand-coders a leg up. Number 6 is mostly a gag :)

So true! Me too!
It's almost like unconsciously I want to test candidates on what I 
happen to already know. Not a real measure of talent or even real knowledge.

I'm not sure why we're asking for two years experience... I know we're 
not requiring CS degree.
I believe a recent college grad could swing it.  In fact, who cares that 
they even have a college degree?

True. I hope we can find someone who's actually interested in this stuff.
I myself could spend hours arguing about doctypes, semantics shibboleths 
or whatever. But then again, I'm committed to excellence ;)

True indeed.  There's more value in conceptual knowledge than in rote 
memorization of syntax.
Your inheritance question is indeed better. I'll add it to the next 
draft. Thank you.

Great. I don't think that would be a problem. I think that would be a 
pretty smart person.
I knew about fizz-buzz but thought it was too difficult...

I agree with the general consensus that these are really soft ball questions.

Below are a few questions I ask:

Instead of #10, I ask:
Name two tags that were deprecated in html 4.  Why were they deprecated?

Other questions I like:
1. What is the difference between, jpeg, gif, and png?  When is each
one appropriate?
(it is astonishing how many experienced developers can't get this right.)

2. Name four IE6 rendering bugs.

3. When are tables appropriate for layout?

Having been on the interviewer side of the desk many many times -- 
interviewing well over 100 people for operations, development, and other 
positions -- I have to respectfully disagree.

2 years of experience on a r?sum? doesn't really translate into that 
much, and two years of experience might really have been two times one 
year of experience, and the person might have been pigeonholed into one 
small area, or only have been using do-everything-for-you tools...

I have found that many people do NOT gain much general exposure.

Nonetheless, these last two questions are good, and should be included 
as well to allow candidates to show their stuff since they're open-ended.

And yet, you'd like to know that someone you're hiring with "several 
years' experience" doesn't have to learn his ABCs and 123s also.

If this were a ten-year veteran, I'd still want some few basic-skill 
questions, to make sure that he's still in touch, but obviously I'd want 
to know more about more advanced things; more strategy than tactics, as 
it were.

I don't believe that any test of this nature should be strictly 
disqualifying; anyone who uses these blindly (like giving them to an HR 
person and saying "ditch below 70%" automatically) doesn't do himself as 
much good. If you're accustomed to reading r?sum?s, and you're doing 
phone interviews 
(http://www.jbaltz.com/weblog/2006/10/phone_screens_redux_1.html) (in 
fact, using this type of quiz as part of a phone screen!) you'd be able 
to winnow out the clowns much earlier.

I think you put too much faith in time-in-grade. To those of us with 
more than a decade of experience doing the same thing, two years just 
isn't that much :-)

That isn't to say that the questions originally posted aren't a bit 
picayune, only that the idea of a basic-skills test for lower-level (1-3 
years experience) is actually a sound one. "I'd just google it" means 
that the candidate just doesn't have THAT much experience in actually 
*doing* it. (Lord knows that I don't run to google for every little 
lookup, I've got sites I already know and have at my fingertips for 
mundane tasks, like oddball CSS recipes.)

Hello ladies and gentlemen,

I just want to give a +1 to the previous thoughts. Most of the questions 
you had (1-5) are pretty silly.
Ask them to either look at code and predict the behavior, or create 
something of their own.

You can also request they submit code when they apply for the position.

Good luck!

This was the first time I'd seen the fizz buzz problem, I like it
because it can really show what level a programmer is at in only a
couple of lines of code, considering there are so many solutions.

No.  close() is called during PHP's cleanup process that happens at the

Hey Guilherme,

Yes. But what if instead of asking about a particular element,  I asked 
"What's the difference between an inline or block element? How can you 
change it via css?"?

Ha! One would think, no? All too easy...

well, check out what my manager said in response:

lol

What's a prime number? ;)

That's what I tried to do here. But with a generic syntax.

You're hired! ;)

That would be a good answer as well...

WIN!

One of the problems I have with your test is that it doesn't look for 
insights. I
would look for someone who can problem solve. A good problem solver might
do poorly on your test.

Looking at programming specifically, it's not about syntax, it's 
about logic. I've
been programming for 30 years and taught programming and software
engineering from introductory programming to graduate level.

Give a candidate this test.

Write the simplest possible algorithm (don't use a specific 
programming language)
to solve the following:

Given a single elimination tennis tournament (you loose a match and 
you're out)
with N players. How many matches are required to determine a winner? Here is
an example, four players A, B, C, and D. In the first round, A play B 
and C plays
D. A and D win. So far 2 matches and 2 players go to next round.

If they come up with a one statement algorithm forget the rest of the 
test and hire
them. They will figure out what then need to know that they don't 
already know.

I gave this little quiz on the first day of every programming class. 
Less than 5% of
those tested got it right. Those who did went on to great programming careers,
without exception.

There is only ONE question to ask, in the immortal words of Steve Jobs:
Have you shipped ANY thing in your life?  :-)

And my only coder question:
How good are you with vi at the command line?

And my only designer question:
Show me cool stuff.

You will SAVE years of HR time with those 3 questions.

 I don't really care where u worked, went to school, grades, or the
results of a test. Just show me COOL stuff that you worked on - and
can you work 20/30/40 hours straight on a problem, without moaning and
groaning about it -  and love doing it?

Fizzbuzz is an excellent test.  I would not hire a "programmer" if s/he
failed to solve Fizzbuzz in under 5 minutes in your target language(s).  I
would also allow for some minor syntax errors if the solution otherwise
worked.

Regarding CSS, the inheritance question will prove far more indicative of a
programmer's skill than the order of border attributes.  It requires a
greater depth of CSS understanding, while Google (and perhaps del.icio.us)
has become the ultimate digital cheat sheet for syntax and I do not think
developers should be slighted for leveraging them.  I also like the inline
vs. stylesheet question as it demonstrates an important grasp of style
overriding.

This was the first time I'd seen the fizz buzz problem, I like it
because it can really show what level a programmer is at in only a
couple of lines of code, considering there are so many solutions.

me = 24 year old with 20 months experience

1 year 1 month - Crap job outta college (very sketchy lead generating company)
7 months - Two man start up (I was the only developer)
Current gig at a small (50 employees), tech company.

>  2 years of experience on a r?sum? doesn't really translate into that much,

I think I've learned an incredibly large amount in the last 20 months,
especially at the start up. During that time I was responsible for
everything front and back, on a very tight deadline. The experience
was incredible and really pushed me to better myself once it became
clear that I had sole responsibility for every technical detail ala
"Somethings broken on the website? It's Jake's fault!".

So, though I ::barely:: meet the criteria of a developer with 2 years
experience, it would appear I'm grossly overqualified for the position
based on the exam. Yes, I was able to answer all of the questions, but
had I been given the exam, I would have immediately recognized that
this is not the gig for me.

Maybe I'm not in the norm, but I think it's important that you don't
just hire people because they meet certain preset criteria. Look for
developers that have a passion for technology and take the time to
fully explore not just the how of a given language, api or toolkit,
but also ask why it was done a certain way. Ask them about their
hobbies at home, what interests them (personally I like toying around
with a Debian install on my NSLU2), I think you'll learn a lot more
about a person's talents when you find out what they do in their free
time and what interests them.

A number that cannot by divided by any other number except 1 and itself.

For your manager... at the top of my head, a small piece of code
(written in normal algorithm form):

declare match

for i := 1 to N do
    match := 0

    for j := 1 to i do
        if i mod j = 0 then
            match := match + 1
        end if
    end for

    if match <= 2 then
        print N
    end if
end for


So, given 10 will return you:

1, 2, 3, 5, 7

My last job appliance I had 8h to write a full working application of
an address book, with an employee at my side looking at any line I was
writing.
Ah... I had the possibility to use anything I wanted.
The data source was an XML file, no app spec, at least 2 views (table
of all cards and cards view).
The test analised comment ratio, oo level and usability.


You hsould try something like that too.... =)

Fizzbuzz is a good test.  I would not hire a "programmer" if s/he failed to
solve Fizzbuzz in under 5 minutes in your target language(s).  I would also
allow for some minor syntax errors if the solution otherwise worked -
favoring logical thinking over an emphasis on syntax.  Also, while
implementing the modulus operator is more elegant, it is worth noting that
it is not required to solve Fizzbuzz.

 

Regarding CSS, the inheritance question will prove far more indicative of a
programmer's skill than the order of border attributes (syntax again).  It
requires a greater depth of CSS understanding, while Google (and perhaps
del.icio.us) has become the ultimate digital cheat sheet for syntax and I do
not think developers should be slighted for leveraging them.  I also like
the inline vs. stylesheet question as it demonstrates an important grasp of
style overriding.

I concur with Ed, with one caveat:

When bringing on a new programmer for any contract that interfaces with the government you MAY care about "school, grades, or the results of a test [certification]"  It may be required by the contract, either directly or by limiting the salaries based on education and/or certification.  

I have a compatriot who despises advanced degrees or certs, because he run into too many "paper programmers".  However, I swear to Jobs that he dreams in binary and has developed a "man page" for each of his own day-to-day activities.  But I will never be able to leverage his talents against certain projects because they require certain measurement of skills by cert or degree.

Getting off my soapbox, however, I DO  keep a couple of "what's wrong with this picture" html/php/CF code snippets that stumped certain staff folk in the past.  If they can "find Waldo", they have the skills (and the attention to detail) for which I am looking.

And my only coder question:
How good are you with vi at the command line?

And my only designer question:
Show me cool stuff.

You will SAVE years of HR time with those 3 questions.

 I don't really care where u worked, went to school, grades, or the results of a test. Just show me COOL stuff that you worked on - and can you work 20/30/40 hours straight on a problem, without moaning and groaning about it -  and love doing it?

So, you've got, by your own admission, much less than two years of real 
experience :-) In fact, 20 months of clock time and only 7 months of 
system time...you eloquently prove my point.

You misinterpret the purpose of the exam. The basic skills test is NOT 
meant to provide *you* with a view into day-to-day work. It's meant to 
provide *me* an idea of how much teaching I'm going to have to do to 
make you useful *immediately*, and to do so relatively objectively and 
quickly.

Put yourself in the hiring manager's shoes for a bit. You've received 
dozens of responses (...if you're lucky. Sometimes it's either feast or 
famine, I've posted ads and received hundreds of responses and others 
only received a handful.); you've got to fill the gap you've got soon, 
so you can keep things rolling; you've got only a finite amount of time 
to review things. Anything you can do that is an effective zeroth-order 
clown filter is going to save you time and money. Do you risk missing 
out on the next Linus Torvalds by doing this? Yes, that's a risk you 
take. You need to balance that against a) the amount of time you'd spend 
rigorously interviewing dozens of candidates and b) when you need to 
fill that vacancy.

Obviously for any new job there is a learning curve. But if I have to 
teach you the absolute basics, that makes you much less valuable. And if 
you can't recognize that something is basic, or picayune, you're 
definitely a bit on the green side.

> Maybe I'm not in the norm, but I think it's important that you don't

Well, since I'm the (presumptive) one doing the hiring, allow me to 
decide what's important and what's not, ok?
If I'm looking for a PHP coder, and you can't tell me how to get all the 
keys and values out of an associative array, well, that's a preset 
criterion, and unless you're really stellar in some other 
fashion...thanks for your time.

For my firm, it may be a bit different -- we do a lot of production 
support, so letting someone loose with the enable password/sys 
password/root password on someone else's machines means that I need to 
have a really good idea of what they know and don't know, lest someone 
do a join of two million row tables with no WHERE clause or do a 
'shutdown' on the active ethernet port.

I do all that too...AFTER I find out what basic skills the prospective 
brings to the table. "What do you read to keep current?" "How would you 
handle $current_problem_we_have" "What steps would you take to debug 
$weird_intermittent_issue" -- all things used to elicit actual cerebral 
activity.

However, doing those things is a waste of my time if I'm looking for a 
PHP coder and you don't know basic PHP stuff, or an HTML coder if you 
don't know the basics of the DOM (or how to separate content from 
layout), or ... you get the idea. I hope.

Tangentially: in your experience how have those holding industry 
certifications fared compared with those holding more traditional 
academic degrees?
I'm thinking of a B.A. holder with a Red Hat Certified 
Technician/Engineer vs. M.S. degree holder...
(pls feel free to ignore if you feel this is ot)

Also works with: B.A. + certified Zend programmer vs. M.S.

Is he considering getting those requirements? again, just curious...

I think this test is stupid. Sorry for being so blunt, but I'd pass it and I 
think I'd be the worst webmaster you ever had.

> HTML

I'd rather ask the candidate where they'd look that up in case they don't 
know. I'd expect that they mention one of the leading XHTML references. The 
answers to these questions can be answered by someone who is often broed and 
looks at the source of web pages in notepad.

> CSS
OK, this is a bit more challenging, but I'd rather ask the same question as 
mentioned for XHTML (and make sure they know that they should use XHTML and 
not just HTML). Sometimes crafting a CSS by hand is useful, but anyone who 
seriously wants to design pages is likely to use a design tool that comes with 
a decent CSS editor. I'd rather ask them which settings to change to get a 
desired effect rather than rattling down what the correct format is. That is 
something I'd trust a piece of software to do it correctly.

That depends, in PHP you'd get a syntax error right in the first line and both 
a and b remain undefined. Some months ago we had a very lively discussion 
about how to hire a PHP developer. You may want to look through the list 
archives. I think we agreed in the end that this question is pointless. I also 
wonder if you are looking for a web master who runs and configures your 
servers or if you are looking for a web developer who creates content and 
writes scripts or if you are looking for both.

That depends. Are you serving mainly corporate clients with big fat pipes 
coming in or the rural farmer with a 9600 baud dial-up modem?

>

Because there is now Silverlight? Now that Microsoft copied Flash everyone 
goes out of their way to diss Flash. I must say that this is one of the better 
questons for a web developer / web designer. The web master can care less.

Even better to ask, why would one want to not separate it. I'd rather hire 
someone who can come up with a plausible answer to that.


I think test like this one don't prove anything. And if it is for a web 
master, you forgot to add some hardware questions as well as questions about 
how to configure Apache, backup strategies, etc.

If I'd take this test during an interview I'd be wondering quite a bit if you 
even know for which position you are hiring.

Sorry for being so harsh.

This for me would be the ultimate test for a web programmer, specially 
the attention to comment ratio, etc.

Was there a time limit? I guess I would need at least 1-2 hours.  (I'm 
not too keen on pulling data from XML nodes by heart. It would be easier 
for me to pull it from a CSV.)

What makes the webmaster position interesting is that you kinda need to 
be a triple threat: HTML/CSS/front-end stuff + coding (php, 
actionscript, javascript, etc) + basic sysadmin stuff (at least FTP, 
htaccess, etc.)

So if we emphasize programming too much do we leave out front-end and 
server stuff??

They of course would need to be able to explain it. If they can do that, who 
cares from where they copied it unless it violates licensing terms.

Why?  We're not trying to break people down with this test, you know?
You sound exactly like the type of candidate we're trying to reach...

Totally, absolutely agree.  It's hard to standardize this, though...
Multiple choice exams are clearly a poor substitute for subjective 
understanding.

This is true.   My most cherished tech project is, for example, 
tinkering with my slackware workstation at home.

So, do you suggest we just scrap the test instead?

A better test would be to give a line of HTML code or a CSS definition and ask the person to describe what it does.  Anyone can look up code from a book or the internet, but they have to understand the code's usage to look for the answer.

For instance put form code on the test with an image for the submit button and ask what displays.

For CSS, give div style code with an index attribute and ask what the index is for.

For Javascript, use the onblur event in the code and ask when it's triggered.

Hey David Krings,

Thanks for the awesome, sometimes passionate, responses!

> I'd pass it and I think I'd be the worst webmaster you ever had.

The test is non eliminatory, and is not the sole factor being 
considered.  It's just a basic test...
Why do you say you'd be the worst webmaster we ever had? We've had 
*terrible* webmasters in the past! You'd have your work cut out for you! lol

"often bored and looks at the source of web pages in notepad"
Great! This is exactly who we want to hire! I'm adding this to the job 
description... ;)

Sorry, David Krings, but this is not true. 
Many times you won't have access to a wysiwyg tool.  You may not even 
have access to X (i.e. bash via ssh), and still need to perform work.
What would you do in that situation?


> That is something I'd trust a piece of software to do it correctly.

lol :-D  +1funny!

Do you think you could make sense of it and answer it correctly 
nevertheless, though? It's not meant to be PHP specific...

Sorry I missed that. I will look into it. Thanks.

Great question!

This is the heart of the question.

Ideally a webmaster will do both (code and admin).  This is what makes 
the job really interesting, in my opinion. This is what attracted me to 
being a webmaster to begin with.
But lately I've been noticing that the profession "webmaster" is 
becoming... old-fashioned?

I attended the "future of web design" conference in NY last year, and a 
constant theme across many speakers was "the need for specialization".

It was stated that webmasters are a dying breed, and that now one should 
hire a web designer, a web developer, and a train a monkey for sysadmin. 
(jk)

I think webmasters need to stand up and be proud of their triple threat 
status!

So, yeah, where have all the webmasters gone?

Just lie...  ;-)

(I kid...)

I guess you could say "anything but dreamweaver" (hired. went on to grok 
vim later. lived happily ever after)

or say "I used to code in emacs but it wasn't configurable enough, so 
I'm writing my own text editor in lisp..." (not hired. escorted out of 
building. later hired as contractor)

better: "I code longhand using pencil and square-paper. By candle light. 
Meet the debugger <shows eraser>"  (hired for research computing dept.)

The real question is not which editor you use to code. It's what browser 
you use to surf. And the answer is obviously: lynx! :-)

Oh, of course, they'd have to explain it...

You know, this is actually the best idea. Because I myself can explain 
code about an order of magnitude more complex than I'm able to produce, 
on the spot, while nervous, etc...
And after all, in this day and age of mash-ups, open-source apps, etc, 
isn't understanding the code what matters? Right on...

I wasn't out to dissuade anyone from utilizing some kind of pseudo
code testing, I'm just trying to offer an alternative point of view,
the receiving end of interviews (interviewee if you will).

In my, admittedly limited experience, I've found company interviews
that start, contain, or end with, "Hi! Here's a computer / piece of
paper, you'll have 45 minutes to complete this exercise consisting
almost entirely of php.net/[insert function name here]", represents a
company on the path to fail, one which I ended up in because I didn't
know any better, two I rejected offers from.

Here's my point of view: if you (as a recruiter) can come up with
nothing better than a rehash of references and a test of memorization
as the gateway for a new hire, then what kind of quality can I expect
in the rest of the company? Just as everyone here is putting the
emphasis on finding the right candidate, weeding out the weak ones,
I'd like to offer the idea that maybe each candidate is trying to find
the right company, and that puts you (the interviewer) on the spot.

I'm not trying to leave you with the impression that Millennials are
ingrates (compared to what, Gen-Xers?), but that there are many
options available to us, applying for a job is trivial thanks to the
internet/head hunters, and supply (of us) is limited. I think that you
would be doing your company a disservice if you didn't consider this
before giving a candidate a test that makes them reconsider their
choice to apply (or even showup) by insulting their intelligence.

couldn't answer your question without a clearer job description, like
what exactly will be the responsibilities of this new hire?

CSS only requires the semi-colon when there is more than one statement  
in the block.

This is ok:
body {
    color: black
}

This is not ok:
body {
    color: black
    background-color: white;
}

According to http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html  you are right.

It states that "A declaration block starts with a left curly brace ({) 
and ends with the matching right curly brace (}). In between there must 
be a list of zero or more semicolon-separated (;) declarations."

But...

This seem to be a test more for a front end person than a back end
programmer.
A lot of this stuff I have done but I do not remember it.  I think I would
fail this test
without a book around.

I went to an interview once for a Perl programmer and they gave me a test
like
this and I said I will not pass the test without my perl book.  The guy let
me use his
perl book and I pass the test.  I do not have the commands memorized but I
do
know what I need to do to get things done.  I was offered the job and I
turned it down
because I took a another job doing more C programming

I probably failed your test but I can not afford to take a pay cut (ha, ha,
ha..)

I have been doing this for several years since I stopped programming in C
and my answers are embedded.

He is not a programmer is he can not understand that.  The person could be a
designer.

It depends what you want them to do.  IF you want them to do back end work
they better get the answer correct.

But if you want them to do mainly front end work/design web pages then can
get this question wrong and still be great designers.

Yes, well, that's NOT what we're talking about. But those companies do 
exist, and it behooves you to understand what they're thinking. And also 
consider the whole fizzbuzz 
(http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html) problem.

Well, gee, it could be that the HR guy is somewhat divorced from the 
actual development team; or that he's the first gateway in; or that he's 
a recruiter from a firm and not the actual principal at all, and uses 
the results for many of his clients!

That's all well and good from both sides: if you wouldn't like it here, 
it's far more likely you'll spend your time looking for your next 
position. I always open the floor to questions from the interviewee; 
what he/she *asks* us is often about as enlightening as how he/she 
answers us.

In fact, the triviality of application is a sword that cuts both ways: 
because of it, people have had to develop these semi-automated methods 
of separating wheat from chaff because so many people use scattershot 
methods of applying for positions, rather than apply for something 
appropriate.

I, personally, have told recruiters and/or hiring managers: "I don't 
take written tests" when I applied for positions. At that time, at my 
stage in life, if I wasn't talking to a principal, or my CV didn't stand 
on its own, I could pass on the job. That was my decision, and I'm sure 
that I missed out on a few good opportunities. Maybe I was just being a 
prima donna. However, I paid my dues a few times, and I've got the 
references to back myself up, so I can take that chance.

**HOWEVER**, were I applying for some entry-level position, I'd expect 
to be tested on the basics, perhaps *even with a rudimentary written 
test*, and that any company that DIDN'T was showing lack of due 
diligence (read: malfeasance). The industry is rife with these stories: 
dailywtf posts them almost daily ("Tales from the Interview"), 
_Peopleware_ devotes a whole chapter to it ("Audition").

The written test that Andr? originally posted was flawed in 
implementation, but totally sound in theory. It merely needed refining 
(and maybe not even that much). Remember: it is meant as a very very 
gross filter, just to totally weed out the completely incompetent who 
make it past your HR department or cursory scan at a CV.

I said it before and I'll reiterate it: yes, doing this kind of 
pre-testing might make me miss out on hiring the next RMS or Joel 
Spolsky, but I have to weigh that against other very compelling needs 
(like if I spend two days interviewing only 5 candidates, I have lots 
two days of other work that I need to do for clients, etc.).

p.s. top-posting is nasty.

That's actually my main concern, Jake. There was definitely no intention 
to insult anybody's intelligence.
I've been on the receiving end of the interview love a few times and did 
feel mildly insulted by certain questions and attitudes, though.

Yet, yes, semi-colons are helpful, and one must be aware of their impact 
in certain situations, like error handling, for example:

"User agents must ignore an invalid at-keyword together with everything 
following it, up to and including the next semicolon (;) or block 
({...}), whichever comes first."

Yes, but this would be okay:

  background-color: white

Because I run one web server at home using the prepackaged system from 
Apachefriends.org. I let others think for me and they even do it for free. The 
nice thing is that they even do a pretty decent job.

This is how I "learned". I found out that way what needs to go into the header 
section and started to just copy and paste it. By now I have some idea what 
the different pieces mean, but that's about it.

See, that is where I am not sure who you are looking for. Are you looking for 
a web designer who is a Flash god and wrote a thesis on UI design or do you 
look for someone who you can hand five card board boxes and a CD and then come 
back a few hours later and see a working server with the code running. The 
difference is that the first one is an artist and the second one is a techie. 
I guess you are looking for an artistical techie.
Sure, you can code major pages by hand from scratch with just a text editor. 
But if that is the way it is supposed to be I wonder why there are so many 
breaking their necks making IDEs and other development tools. I'm not saying 
that it is pointless in knowing how to edit a file via CLI, but for anything 
that is more involved why would anyone not use a tool?

You may laugh, but after a while doing everything by hand and from scratch is 
getting old.

A gets the value of B and B keeps its value (I think that was 20, wasn't it). 
There is quite some research done with this test debating various thinking 
models that each have some merit and logic, OK, except for those who claim the 
results is that B turns into a string and A is the square root of seven.

No, not really, but since there is so much stuff to do and to know in regards 
to web it is less likely and maybe not even desired for one person to know it 
all well enough. Such a person is ideal for support. The best supporter is 
like a duck, can swim, but not like a dolphin, can run, but not like leopard, 
and can fly, but not as well as an eagle. For development you don't want a 
duck, you want a dolphin, a leopard, and an eagle. So the "knows it all" is a 
rare breed and chances are you get the duck, who can do a little bit of 
everything, but nothing well.

Yes, because your design goddess doesn't give a damn where the files need to 
go on the server and how to make sure the backups are fine and that the logs 
get evaluated. And honestly, I think that is OK, after all you hired the sys 
admin monkey for those tasks.

Well, back then when there wasn't all this flashy stuff and people stared at 
you in disbelief when your page looked like Craigslist and you knew how to 
deal with a server you were the (web) master. Now you have to be certified for 
networking, sys admininstration, be a security expert, know all the software 
development stuff, and be awesome at graphics and UI design. There is no way 
to master all this in perfection, have all the certs, 10 years experience, and 
be an under 20 year old who can work 80 hour weeks straight for peanuts and 
Mountain Dew.
So you need to figure out who you need and in which area you can accept 
weaknesses. It comes down to which skills you need from the new web master now 
and which ones can wait until they are acquired or deemed not needed.

My bad, I was addressing your entire response, should have included

On the topic of tests and testing and unreasonable requests from would-
be employers or clients:

Recently there was a lady who posted not only to Craig's List Gigs 
section but also to this list, "desperate" for a developer to start 
ASAP.  I sent over my resume and she responded saying "send a code 
sample"...and I emailed her back saying, I have 10+ years of 
experience, I don't feel I am in a position to have to prove to you 
that I can write code.  

I guess a lot of other people responded to her the same way, as she was 
searching a while.  What was she going to do with the code, anyway?  
Chances are she was just a "civilian" who could no more read code [ever 
notice how when you show it to them they go "OH WOW MAN look at that" 
and then their eyes glaze over?] than read Russian.  And if she can 
read it, she should have to pay for it anyway.

I'm not really sure why they ask for code, seems stupid to me!

I hate test like that and probably wouldn't take 
it. It doesn't give you any indication of the 
persons abilities and is more likely to show your 
own shortcomings.

I would rather ask a simple question like "Impress me" and listen.

If has online work, then have him show it.

If he has a list of past clients, then supply the urls.

But then again, you have to know enough to know 
how to judge what's correct and current.

Instead, why not instead hire one of us to 
interview your candidates? For those of us who 
know, it's pretty easy to spot the ones who know 
what they are doing.

Cheers,

tedd

>  kilobytes)? How are the factors related?

My answer:

The number of kilobytes is irrelevant to the user.  Page load time is
what matters.
To improve the page load time, the following items are a good idea:
1) Minimize the number of TCP connections -- make sure keep alive is turned on
2) Minimize Number of HTTP requests required -- use css sprites,
consolidate scripts/css.
3) Make sure the page progressively renders. -- if you get a white
flash in IE, you are doing something wrong
4) Remove unnecessary blocking javascript -- e.g. analytics code
should be defered, ads should be placed at the end of the page and
positioned with css if possible.
5) Use expires http headers.
6) Gzip all js/css/html.
7) Use subdomains to get around the 2 connection limit.
8) Replace complicated float layouts with tables  -- standards freaks
hate this, but Google uses tables all the time because they care more
about page render time than standards conformance.
9) Optimize all images for the web.  -- use the "save for web" feature
in photoshop.  It strips out all the unnecessary metadata and
optimizes the palette.

Page size is rarely the issue.

Andr?:

I'm not saying that he shouldn't answered the 
question as you intended, but let's stop and 
examine this incident -- your question was:

7) a and b are variables.

    a = 10
    b = 20
    a = b

    The new values of a and b are, respectively:

And his answer was:

    a= 0.5, b=1

Now, if you were looking at these relationships 
as ratios, such as a:10, b:20, then what would be 
the ratio of a:b ? His answer 0.5:1 would have 
been correct.

I suspect that you confused the issue by using 
the word "respectively". After all, that word 
really didn't add anything to the question except 
to add a bit of doubt as to what the question 
actually meant. Using the word "respectively 
means with respect to each other and thus one 
could interpret that as a ratio question. As 
such, his answer would have been correct.

If you had been testing for grammar, then he 
could have corrected that for you for bonus 
points.

I've seen a lot of trick questions in my day and 
that word would have raised a red flag for me. Of 
course, I would have still answered the question 
the way you wanted -- but I would have never let 
on that your question showed more about you than 
me.

If it had turned out to be a trick question, then 
I could have defended my answer well enough. But, 
I have found myself in positions before where the 
people who wrote the test knew absolutely nothing 
about the subject and in those cases no one wins 
except the dumbest -- try taking a civil service 
exam sometime and you'll understand.

That's the problem with writing test -- not only 
do you have to know what you are asking; but how 
specific and clear the question is; what should 
the answer be (acceptable range); and most 
importantly why you are asking it. What value 
does answering your question your way bring to 
the table? After all, you might be wrong.

I applied for a position with a company and after 
reviewing my resume they required me to take a 
math fraction test. I asked them if they had 
noticed my education (MSc) on my resume which 
required math skills far exceeding fractions 
(i.e., vector calculus, matrix theory, digital 
processing).  They replied "Yes, but we still 
want you to take the test." I declined and we 
parted company. So, what purpose did that test 
serve?

In short, test generally suck as a measure of 
anything more than common ignorance.

Cheers,

tedd

This is so in depth. I hadn't seriously thought about css sprites yet.
I'm saving this for future reference.

CSS sprites are a pain in the ass to manage.  I'd recommend all of the
other options first.  If you do decide to use them, there are two
general strategies:

1) Yahoo - icon strategy:
<a href="/blah/" class="sprite abc" />
css:
a.sprite {
margin-left: 30px;
background:transparent url('sprite.png') no-repeat scroll top left;
}
a.abc {
background-position: -Ypx -Xpx
}

In this case there needs to be a huge amount of white space around each sprite.

2) Google - image replacement method:
<img src="blank.gif"  style="background:transparent url('sprite.png')
no-repeat scroll -Ypx -Xpx; width:25px; height:25px" />

With the Google method, the sprites images don't need any padding
around each image.

John C.

Hi there:

I'm experiencing problems with Safari file uploads into my CMS (self- 
built).  This is a system that's been in use/development for years and  
years, without problem.  It doesn't do anything too exotic (AJAX,  
etc.)...just a simple multipart/form-data form with file upload fields.

For some reason, in Safari 3+ on OS X, file uploads are basically  
failing.  It'll just hang.  It doesn't happen in any other browser.   
Anyone experience any subtle changes in Safari's file upload behavior  
that could be causing this?

Cheers,

Some odds and ends on this test topic, featuring 2 best test scenarios I
can recall:

1) I took a test one time at some big hi-floor Tribeca shop and the
candidate was plunked down at a live workstation in the middle of the
office with staff all around you and you were expected to instantly
learn the folder structure and network. You were expected to use the
office IDE. And you were given basically a PHP assignment of the type
that comes in and you had up to 1.5 hours to do it and save. 

2) At another test, the co. initiated every recruitment with a live
phone interview in which the company chief tech officer grills you live
for 10 - 20 min. on web server maint and PHP coding issues related to
their environment. 

I thought both of these techniques very effective.

And more historically when I managed a 24-hr desktop operation, we had a
3-hour hands on test in which you were put at a workstation, thrown a
big aggressively marked up document and all the assets you would need
for this assignment and you were expected to just do it live using all
the graphics applications and print it out correctly. This hardcore
testing method weeded out the talkers and turned up winners and revealed
in very fine degrees their levels of expertise. 

So I would actually propone a short but rigorous test (maybe with 2 or 3
levels of difficulty) based on exactly how your office works.

Asking for code samples is completely reasonable.  It shows how you think 
and how you code.  This is helpful for two reasons.  First, it's a way to 
back up the statement that one has been coding for 10 years.  Second, 
just because someone has been doing something for 10 years doesn't mean 
they do a good job.

Now that's more like a test of abilities that I would consider. 
However, with one caveat -- allow me to use the tools I work with, 
namely my workstation.

Give me the test on-line and allow me to work on it without the "over 
the shoulder" inspections and at the end of the time limit, just have 
me present my results with my explanation. Keep in mind, that while 
your office may "work that way" -- that "way" may not be the best.

Often in the corporate world the brightest ideas have to pass through 
the dimmest minds. Give me a small group of dedicated and qualified 
people and I'll do just fine. But put me with the corporate "this is 
the way it's done" types, and it's not a test I'll consider taking.

Cheers,

tedd

No, I had not read that -- but the article drives home the point I 
was making in that it's very difficult to test a person's ability to 
program.

Programming is more akin to the basic method of a person's ability to 
resolve and interpret the world around them. I have my own theories, 
but I don't think they would be acceptable in academic circles.

But think of this -- we all know that color-blind people see things 
differently and that's considered a disability. However, in WWII we 
successfully used color-blind personnel to detect camouflaged enemy 
positions. Now imagine a color-blind person trying to teach normal 
visioned people how to do that. That's the type of problem you run 
into teaching programming. But on the same point, a color-blind 
person would have little problem explaining that to another 
color-blinded person (of course of the same color-blindness). That's 
the main reason for the two-humped test results the article mentions. 
You either "get-it" or you don't.

Some of the top programmers I ever met, had no formal education. Explain that.

Cheers,

tedd

Hi Dan --

I feel that in some cases, it may be appropriate to ask for code 
samples.  In the case where it is a full time role and company policy 
is that people are asked to submit code samples as part of the hiring 
package, then OK.

But someone posting some BS few thousand buck gig asking for a 
freelancer?  

The way I look at things, if you go to hire a lawyer or a doctor, you 
might ask around and see if anyone has gotten good service from them.  
You might ask them to recommend some satisfied former clients for you 
to speak with before hiring them.  Might even ask them how many spleens 
they have removed before in their career.  Great.  But are you going to 
sit there and say "send me one of your other client's documents so I 
can see if you know how to file a case" or "let me watch you remove 
someone's spleen so that I  know you are a real doctor"...umm.

And by the same token I'm a professional person providing services, my 
services just happen to be debugging code, and I've been called in 
enough times to fix code that others wrote that didn't work, and 
successfully done so, to know that I am good at what I do.  (My 
sometimes boneheaded code mashups in posts here notwithstanding! :))
I'm not saying I'm the best in the world, but I've been around the 
block a few times and paid my dues.

And when you are choosing clients, sometimes you have to look for signs 
that they might be difficult to work with.  If I have to start trying 
to prove to a client at the outset that I'm not a complete and utter 
idiot, then that could be a red flag....?  A huge part of a successful 
project is good will and open communication between client and 
programmer.

In my opinion, reducing the job role of a programmer/systems 
analyst/application developer/etc to a "task oriented" role where you 
go in and take tests and get asked basic stupid questions about HTML 
elements and if statements (and maybe whether you can remember to put 
mocha in the latte) denigrates the nature of the work we do and the 
character and intellect it takes to be successful in this field.  And 
that is something that I have found is far too common an occurrence.

This is a very interesting discussion. I believe in being able to  
obtain the best person for the job, but  I'm not sure that creating a  
standardize programming test is the best way. Or to devise some trick  
questions. It reminds me of academic hazing constructed to make the  
instructor look smart.

If you were going to hire a personal cook, you would go by  
recommendations and actually sample what they can prepare based on  
the kind of meals you desire. A cook passing a test about the use of  
appliances and what's the best way to melt butter doesn't mean they  
are going to be able to make the Weight Watchers? meat-loaf the way  
you like it. You would have the candidate cook prepare some meals for  
you and ask for their feed back on real questions like, "We eat many  
chicken dishes, what do you recommend?". This would also give you a  
chance to see if this person is not only able to prepare a meal to  
your liking but if they are a good resource for you as well. Before I  
push this any further, I don't have a cook, don't know how to cook,  
but I know what I would want if I was going to hire one cause it  
would be based on what they actually have to do on the job. A  
certified cook doesn't mean much if they can't make White Chocolate  
Mousse on-demand. :-)

Bringing this back to programming, webmastering, or service  
tech'ing. :-) You want to hire a webmaster. Make a list of the kinds  
of things you wish to have a webmaster do on the job most of their  
time. If the job is to be able to re-partition disks or change  
content on a corporate web site using a popular open source CMS  
(Joomla), then I feel those are the things that should be asked of a  
candidate to demonstrate in front of a work station. If most of their  
job will be installing new software and configuring a system then set- 
up some systems with packages for them to do this. This is assuming  
if you can't entirely trust the recommendations for this person or if  
you simply want to see if they can do what you need them to do  
specifically. If the candidate doesn't know how to do something and  
looks on the web to figure it out, and is still able to get the job  
done in a reasonable amount of time than I consider this a plus,  
because someone who is resourceful and works this way on the job is  
better than someone who only knows what they have been shown to do.  
Syntax examples of most things are only a few clicks away.

At the very least, a candidate should walk away from the interview  
feeling that they were actually being evaluated for what they would  
have  to do on the job. If they had difficulty it would be obvious to  
them on what areas they need to improve on and realize why they  
weren't offered a job. As for the hiring manager, you want to feel  
confident that the person you hire can do the real job and if they  
have successfully demonstrated performing small work tasks you will  
know for sure.

This goes back to my point about the status of the profession --  if 
we're being compared to cooks and service technicians, you know times 
are going to be rough for us.  I'd rather be compared to a lawyer...and 
make closer to what they make...what we do is no less complex.

That is probably true for the pure logic, but I tried pretty much any 
programming environment I could get my hands on and I failed in all but two. 
One was the now defunct VB6 and the other one is PHP. I tried Java and C/C++ 
and they are just way too complicated. You have to do so much stuff upfront to 
get to the point where can even bother to think about how to solve a problem. 
That is what I like to so much about PHP, there is often already a good set of 
pieces to the puzzle available and since those are big pieces it is also easy 
to put them together. And in the end the result is as pretty as using 
something else. And still I think even PHP makes programming often way more 
difficult than it has to be, best example is any date or time related 
function. One third uses the illogical US notation, one third uses the less 
illogical european notation, and the last third uses something entirely 
different. Absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary.

The top programmers understand the business and therefore know the 
expectations. My guess is that those things that make them great programmers 
have nothing to do with programming and the fact that they didn't have formal 
education didn't cloud their minds. Not to prejudice an entire group, but back 
at IR when we started working with the developers from India, they impressed 
with all their knowledge about algorithms and SQL skills and what have not. 
All the stuff they learned in the universities. The problem was that they had 
no clue what our business was about and what they needed to do in order to 
satisfy the expectations. They worked hard and put a lot of effort into their 
work, but were too focused on numbers. Rather than giving us 50 lines of code 
that did work well thay cranked out 10,000 lines of code that didn't even 
compile, but in their view they did an awesome job, because they used all the 
examples from their text books. Even worse, you could ask them to do the 
dumbest thing and they just said yes and did it. We also worked with other 
foreign developers and they tended to be way more critical of what was asked 
for. If they thought there is a better way they said so and often were right. 
We worked with one dutch guy who joined the company as an intern. The 
internship was required before starting the studies at the university. He 
never went back to school and just learned what he needed on the job. He is a 
good programmer, but his real skill is that he gets what the business is about 
and what he needs to do to get from A to B and that over and over again. Now 
that's a good programmer, he is so important to the division that he gets paid 
very well, although I am sure that he'd have a tough time getting hired 
somewhere else. The formal education is often just the means to land a job. 
Once you are hired you start at zero.
I made that experience at my current job. I did QA and support for 7 years at 
IR and thought that this experience will help me a lot. It really didn't. This 
industry here works entirely differently, the audience is different and 
compared to what we did at IR what we work on now is far more important to the 
operations of our customers. That makes it much easier to get access to the 
decision makers and get IT and other resources to get a system implemented. 
That also means that the expectations are way higher.

That written, I really should get back to work....

Then you do not know what personal chefs make. Most of them have salaries that 
rival that of senior developers, if not top them. There are also various kinds 
of personal chefs. Some have one customer and are available 24x7, others have 
multiple customers and do the food shopping for them as well as prepare meals 
that can be reheated easily or it just happens that they manage to dish dinner 
at one place and then handily make it to the next one in time.
Besides that,  I know a few lawyers that make less than I do for twice the 
amount of work. In regards to service technicians or supporters in general, 
they are absolutely undervalued. Developers make software so that QA can test 
it, sales can sell it, and support can support it. the group that spends the 
most time with customers is support. Why would you want the least paid 
employees be the face of your company? And the developer is dead in the water 
without the service tech, but not the other way around. From that perspective 
developers should get paid low wages and get the dirty parking spots in the 
back of the lot. But I guess that adds to your point that being a lawyer is 
preferred, especially since in a judicial system like the american one you 
have job security like nothing else.

David:

All very well said.

It's obvious that you "get it" while others have difficulty 
understanding that traditional testing is not a way to measure 
programming skills.

True, and assembler is easier than machine -- which I've done.

But after all is said and done the key is being able to vision things 
in a certain way that is not typical for the majority of people.

All complications can be resolve in time. If you work with it long 
enough, you'll see the commonality between all languages.

David --

My concern here isn't chiefly about the rate/salary levels in the 
profession but moreso about the general public's perception of the 
complexity of the knowledge base and effort required to be successful 
as a halfway decent programmer.

It's true that I do certainly have my opinions about rates, and think 
that the above issue is probably a prime factor in pricing.

Sorry for any confusion.

I have listened to/seen/read about many famous artistic movie directors,
photographers, professional athletes, chefs, musicians, even painters
speaking about their projects/achievements. To the one they are
extremely and profoundly well educated (however they achieved it) in all
and I mean all of the technical aspects and even the most subtle
minutiae that are the bedrock knowledge of their chosen profession.
Also, as far as I know whatever your chosen career you are going to face
a very rigorous testing of your full skill set to get to the top or
acquire the best jobs/projects before you are unleashed unchecked into
your industry. 

For example, you may hear a painter say "Well, I really don't know how I
do that. I get inspiration from anywhere around me and then it just
bursts forth". But you will also uncover that they can make their own
paint from eggs and dirt, they know and understand the concept and
content of every major art technique and why and when they use it, and
on and on and on. 

Whether totally self-taught, immaculate savant or academic thoroughbred
-- it always pays to become an knee deep expert in something before you
become a journeyman and then hands on expert.  

I see no issue with using any kind of testing to suss out
(unfortunately) the outright liars, frauds and lazy two-faced scabs that
might think a little creative deception that is closely followed by a
little creative stealing is just quite alright in their life and
transposes easily into your office.

And I would still maintain all theory aside, that a test that tests for
what your office uses and does will net you better more appropriate
people be better than a generic Q&A.

My personal take on all this is that "process" testing is more useful than 
"memory" testing. In other words, a good developer, systems administrator 
or tech support person should be able to demonstrate or talk through the 
process they would use to solve a particular problem. Even if it 
meant using Google, or searching a mailing list archive or even 
just looking it up in a book. "Memory" testing OTOH, where you're asked to 
regurgitate facts that you have memorized are not terribly useful tests. 

I was once in an interview where I was asking to list all the different 
kinds of RAID and what they're used for. (At the time I had been working 
for an ISP for about 5 years as a systems administrator). I know what RAID 
is and how its used because Id been using it. But damned if I knew ALL of 
the different kinds of RAID off the top of my head because certain types 
of RAID are commonly used and some are not used very much (if at all!).

The same company conducted two hour-long phone interviews with me (yeah, 
it was a bit excessive looking back on it now :-) which I did very well on 
because they were like conversations where I was given a scenario and 
asked to explain the theory and/or walk through a process.

For me, if I were hiring someone, its more important they know WHERE and 
HOW to look for an answer. A good memory doesn't mean you necessarily 
understand anything.

         Profession have educational and licensing/certification 
procedures. It has virtually nothing
to do with how much money one makes. By definition, programming and 
website design is not a
profession. Lawyers require a graduate degree and passage of the bar

states, require a graduate degree and certification. And so it goes.

Not sure about changes, but file uploads have been working fine for me
in 3.1. Have you experienced problems on other sites, for instance
http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload+with_options ?

profession: "An occupation, such as law, medicine, or engineering, 
that requires considerable training
and specialized study"

Houghton Mifflin Dictionary.

Even an engineer must have a professional engineering (PE) 
designation to perform certain types of design.
I don't have a problem with a self taught programmers, I've known 
some great ones, however, a field having
a large number of practitioners without formal training is a trade 
not a profession. A profession is also
self-regulated.

It's another thread but, should there be certification available for 
programmers and web designers? If we
ever want to be considered a profession, that's the first step. I was 
in the stock brokerage business when
the designation Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) first came into 
being. It was extraordinarily difficult
and it took almost two years after the announcement before the first 
designation were awarded. It required
two 8 hour day testing sessions. It made a huge difference in the 
industry and these days you will not get
a senior level job in a research department without a CFA. Same thing 
happened with Chartered Financial
Planner (CFP).

I'm unsure of the procedure, but how/when does one change the subject 
when we have drifted into a new
area?

This is quite a strong summation.

Yet, fortunately, there is some types of accreditation for some
programming and related categories. There is Microsoft MSCE, Cisco
Certified, general network certifications, Oracle cert, Red Hat cert,
security cert, Zend PHP cert, even a Flash cert. 

So, maybe if firms and sites (PHP.net and all such related sites)
started advocating cert programs as one of, if not the first serious
step, toward an evolving measurable genuine industry competency and
competitiveness that would help programmers more effectively work
towards and achieve known knowledge levels that might have nationally
known pay scales.

Then a programmer could plan a career and salary objectives a little
more logically. And businesses could budget and allocate programmer
workforce more exactly.

Somewhere, something is all good and better than the existing free for
all.

I'm not certain of 'Houghton Mifflin' (and whatever traces of etymology 
they use in that particular edition), but the word itself actually comes 
from the monastics/priests, in which one would 'profess' their belief. 
It was later adapted to professional, or 'one who professed an 
understanding of a skill'. It has never been attached to formal 
education or academic achievement; that would be 'academic', 
'baccalaureate </index.php?term=baccalaureate>', 'esquire' or 'master'. 
(And I hope you're not seeking your etymological proofs from wikipedia)

Clearly the word has been equivocated in this discussion, and I strongly 
suggest that a Webmaster is a 'professional', in his capacity (not 
requiring a third party approval), for he is not 'professing' to have 
skills of basket-weaving or ministry, but to have skills of a specific 
nature and practice pertaining solely to 'webmastering'. These skills 
could be verified by a third party, but that verification is not the 
foundation upon which a profession is established. Professions are 
established by a particular set of skills being required to perform a 
particular task, or set of tasks. Hence a professional 'handy-man', 
'professional student', 'professional football player', 'professional 
actor'. The entire concept to be carried in the word is to cognitively 
separate those who have mastered particular skills from those who are 
acquiring particular skills (aka Professional VS Amateur).

Then again, the word itself began in a society and time of greater moral 
concentration, so perhaps you assume that anyone who refers to 
themselves as a professional today, is either lying (if they haven't a 
third party 'approval' or tertiary educational document) or is 
equivocating upon the word, and actually means 'academic', 
'baccalaureate </index.php?term=baccalaureate>', 'esquire' or 'master' 
of 'webmastering'.

Never-the-less, referencing oneself as a 'professional' is not based 
upon academic merit, but upon personal, occupational self-reflection. 
Whether-or-not that reflection is an accurate one leads to a different 
discussion.

As an old friend once told me: "If you call yourself professional, don't 
turn out to be a Shmegegge"

-My two (well ok three) cents

Subject: [nycphp-talk] On Developer Certification
Message-ID: <c7c53eda0804160646l46ec26e3u528d9c33e499ae66@mail.gmail.com>

I'm sure this has all been discussed before (with much more flair and
depth than I'm capable of) but one of the hurdles in developer
certification that appears most obvious to me is that our industry
contains so much variety.

Variety is probably not the best word for it, but what I mean is that
the developer who is creating an application for monitoring nuclear
reactors is probably going to need to be much more thorough than
another developer who's just setting up a custom blog for a popular
band. There are wide areas inside the industry that require different
levels of talent and detailedness.

Although I'm Zend certified, I think that such certifications are
really quite useless (I felt I had to get the certification just so I
could say that without sounding like a hypocrite). It proves very
little except that the developer is good at taking tests and
memorizing material. There *might* be a way to develop a test that
creates a valid stamp of approval, but I have yet to see it. Again,
the problem comes back to the variety inherent to the industry. One
test can't encompass it all. You've got medical app devs that need to
be familiar with HIPAA regulations, financial app devs that need to be
familiar with Sox, and front-end guys that need to have familiarity
with UI principles...

I could go on, but I shan't.

I don't think Eclipse is great for PHP. I tried several plugins for PHP and 
they all gave me just more reason not to consider Eclipse as a PHP IDE. I 
don't mean that you can't use it for PHP, but getting decent IntelliSense, 
help, and the debugger to work wasn't easy. Or is there a plugin that does all 
that?
I found NuSpehere's PHPEd to be the best, followed closely by EnginSite's and 
Waterproof's editors. The major difference is that PHPEd has a way better 
debugger implementation and as far as I can tell Luckasoft stopped working on 
the EnginSite PHP Editor. Waterproof is releasing a beta for their new version 
and that might just be worth looking at it again.
Just to note, those are all Windows based IDEs, except for PHPEd, which also 
comes in a Linux version, but since that requires buying the same license 
again I did not bother. Which brings me to the disadvantges of NuSphere. They 
ruin the fun with theit great product by not allowing a license to be valid 
for dot releases. I bought one for 5.0 and three weeks later they released 
5.1. I was quite miffed to find that the 5.0 license won't work for 5.1 and 
the changes weren't that spectacular that paying the upgrade price was worth 
it. I can see that a 5.x license won't work for a 6.x release given that 6.x 
adds substantially more features (and no, fixing bugs and design flaws aren't 
considered new features). I complained about it, but also in this case 
corporate greed won over customer satisfaction. Still, 5.0 does what I need 
and I did get it at a bargain price, so I am not that interested in discussing 
that any further with NuSphere. It's just that I probably switch once I 
outgrow what I got or it no longer works right.

Coming back to the previous topic, everyone has their preference for 
editors/IDEs and often it is just that, a preference, not a quality judgement. 
That is why I even prefer a nicely designed GUI on a server over the command 
line. Not that there is anything bad with using a command line, but for 
example installing a dozen packages via CLI vs. Synaptics makes me appreciate 
the GUI quite a bit. Just a preference, but one shared with many others.

I would posit that there has been a tipping point in all programming and
related fields including webmastering. 

That the days of stringing together some solid text pages that all ran
off a little recycled personal server that laid unsecured on the floor
under your desk are over and the content you served has basically
anecdotal info about stuff.

Today the internet has become a commerce channel, a medical tool, a
financial conduit, a personal diary/finance/calendar life organizer, an
entertainment machine, the defacto news bringer, the banking network, an
education tool.

So whether working on nuclear tools, ecommerce tools or personal
calendar tools -- there is nothing left on the internet any more that
isn't a database driven, entertainment/financial/medical/planning
conduit of tremendous personal import to millions of people. 

The pervasive need for accuracy, precision, truth, ethics and privacy is
through the roof. 

I would still agree with Dr. LeJeune, other industries (even chefing)
have schools and egregiously difficult accreditations that through trial
by fire the vast majority of participants have agreed to and come to the
vital conclusion that we need standards.

If I could wave a wand there would be association accreditations for
programming that were industry and academically recognized.

If I were running a financial institution with interactive financial
tools that reach in to millions of peoples bank accounts, I would be
damn straight strict about the quality, aptitude and proven ethics and
skills of my workers. I think that needs to be a fact today or get out
of this business because I and a lot of consumers depend quite blindly
every day that there really is some type of morality and honest purpose,
proper coordination and genuine financial skill behind all the tools we
use on the internet every day.

We need standards. One day there will yet be some massive financial
blowup where someone is going to learn that some interest calculating
script in an international money market fund was off by 1/100ths of a
penny on 33% of transactions and accidentally over 16 years time over
$400,000,000 in interest earnings were never applied to account holders.
And one of them will be a senator who lost $1,400,000 and then what? 

What incident are you waiting for?

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] Re: OT: webmaster test

I'm not certain of 'Houghton Mifflin' (and whatever traces of etymology 
they use in that particular edition), but the word itself actually comes

from the monastics/priests, in which one would 'profess' their belief. 
It was later adapted to professional, or 'one who professed an 
understanding of a skill'. It has never been attached to formal 
education or academic achievement; that would be 'academic', 
'baccalaureate </index.php?term=baccalaureate>', 'esquire' or 'master'. 
(And I hope you're not seeking your etymological proofs from wikipedia)

Clearly the word has been equivocated in this discussion, and I strongly

suggest that a Webmaster is a 'professional', in his capacity (not 
requiring a third party approval), for he is not 'professing' to have 
skills of basket-weaving or ministry, but to have skills of a specific 
nature and practice pertaining solely to 'webmastering'. These skills 
could be verified by a third party, but that verification is not the 
foundation upon which a profession is established. Professions are 
established by a particular set of skills being required to perform a 
particular task, or set of tasks. Hence a professional 'handy-man', 
'professional student', 'professional football player', 'professional 
actor'. The entire concept to be carried in the word is to cognitively 
separate those who have mastered particular skills from those who are 
acquiring particular skills (aka Professional VS Amateur).

Then again, the word itself began in a society and time of greater moral

concentration, so perhaps you assume that anyone who refers to 
themselves as a professional today, is either lying (if they haven't a 
third party 'approval' or tertiary educational document) or is 
equivocating upon the word, and actually means 'academic', 
'baccalaureate </index.php?term=baccalaureate>', 'esquire' or 'master' 
of 'webmastering'.

Never-the-less, referencing oneself as a 'professional' is not based 
upon academic merit, but upon personal, occupational self-reflection. 
Whether-or-not that reflection is an accurate one leads to a different 
discussion.

As an old friend once told me: "If you call yourself professional, don't

turn out to be a Shmegegge"

Eclipse + PDT + (Turn code folding off, there's a bug in the latest
release) + Integrated SVN + xdebug = Win

Let's go over the pros:
 - Cross platform: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, all exactly the same
 - All of the plugins available for Eclipse will work with PDT
installed, there are hundreds of actively supported plugins for
Eclipse
 - Free
 - Lot's of shops (as far as I can tell) use it

Besides Eclipse, I occasionally use TextMate and vim, both of which
(TextMate is light weight, vim, well, sometimes you've got to go in
and make some quick changes) have their specific benefits.

For all intents and purposes, a software engineer/application developer 
must have a bachelor's degree of some sort, and certainly after 10 
years of doing this, I consider that it takes considerable training and 
specialized study to be reasonably good.

My question to you Urb:  Would you consider me, a person with a non-CS 
university degree (B.A.), and 10 years of actual paid experience, to 
be "self taught" or merely "non traditionally formally educated"...?
It's true that the skills to be a good programmer were learned "in the 
field" and not in a classroom but isn't that true of everyone?  And to 
say "self taught" is to really underestimate the contributions of very 
brilliant people I have learned from over the years including one Dr. 
Jerry A. who posts to this list, and many others.

I would sure welcome a NYS professional license for software developers 
and want to know would anyone else want to get active on that?  It 
could require a certain number of years of actual paid experience and a 
test and whatever else...I'm 100% in favor of this if it helps us get 
more respect.  As Urb pointed out, other types of engineers do have 
licensing.  

(My previous polemic having been somewhat out of place because we were 
talking about a "webmaster test" -- but it's one thing if you are 
looking for someone who can hand code a little HTML...that's not 
necessarily a "profession" -- but if you are looking for someone who 
can administer your LAMP environment AND design & develop your LAMP 
applications then you are looking for someone with a sh*tload of 
experience and broad based experience at that...you are looking for a 
LAMP engineer not a "webmaster".  Calling this person a "webmaster" 
with all those skills is another way of keeping respect, and pay 
scales, down.)

My point having been that (no offense to the lawyers out there) it 
takes WAY MORE BRAINS to design & develop working code than it does to 
write a divorce complaint or a commercial lease -- which is what most 
lawyers do -- most of them are not litigation experts who deal with 
arcane Supreme Court decisions and get on Court TV -- and by the same 
token most software developers are not dealing with the highest, most 
arcane levels of software (whatever that might be deemed to be).

But it is a profession requiring a 4 year degree (de facto) and 
CONSIDERABLE training and specialized education...!!

Industry certifications are all well and good but state-certified 
professional licenses would be a huge step forward.  

Just think how cool it would be to have a "NYS Licensed Code Jockey" 
certificate in a huge frame on your office wall :)

Not to mention the economic & lobbying power that state professional 
organizations have.

Guess 24 years experience programming in all kinds of environments with 
15 or so languages does not constitute a profession then based on your 
position that it requires a degree.  I have no degree.  I have very 
little formal training.

The problem in today's world is that too much emphasis is put on a 
degree, and not enough emphasis is put on experience.  I'm not trying to 
denigrate degrees, I wish I had one ( especially considering the heavy 
emphasis ).  But, when I entered the programming fray, degrees were not 
emphasized.  I suspect that the dearth in competent coders at the time 
was a heavy influence.

I very much like the lawyer example considering  Frank Abagnale Jr.  
Frank was made famous by Leonardo Dicaprio's portrayal in "Catch Me if 
You Can".  While the movie is an exaggeration of the reality of the 
story, according to Frank, he did pass the bar exam without any formal 
education.  Now Frank may be an exceptional intellect, but I think it 
does draw out that it is fully possible for individuals to rise to the 
industry standard without a formal education.

I consider myself a professional in a profession even without the 
degree.  In fact, I consider myself a craftsman rather than an engineer 
because I take pride in everything I do and apply ingenuity and 
creativity rather than rely on a canned set of solutions.

Once again, I do not disregard formalized education, it forms a very 
good foundation on which to build a profession.  But to assume that no 
formalized education denotes a non-professional elevates formalized 
education to the be-all and end-all for the profession.  If that were 
the case, then, students coming out of college should be fully prepared 
to BE what they trained to be.  I can't tell you how many interviews I 
have conducted with graduates who obviously lacked the skills to do the 
job.  Ability should be the bellwether, not how that ability came to be.

The real discussion is not on what qualifies one for the profession, but 
rather, how do we accurately measure ability.  I don't have the answer 
to that question.  And, I think that were an answer to that question 
readily available, there would be no need for this discussion.  Maybe 
part of the licensing process should borrow from the medical community 
and require a period of "residency".

Jim -- after 24 years in the field, I'd suggest that probably you are 
eligible to be granted a degree based on life experience!! :)

I was certainly not saying that a degree makes any sort of difference 
in competency (it doesn't!), but only that to be considered 
a "profession" for licensing purposes, a degree (or life experience 
constituting equivalence of a 4-yr degree!) would be most likely 
required.  

Probably I would run into issues with licensing myself as my degree was 
in Literature & Linguistics (1985) ...and I used an old manual 
typewriter to do my research papers! LOL.

Kristina, Jim & PSaw,

This is the gap that The Open Group aims to address. 

Their IT Architect and new (looks like just released) IT Specialist 
programs require you to submit a package detailing your education, but 
more importantly, experience and project history.  There's a baseline that 
needs to be met for certain skills, along with a board review. 

It requires a significant amount of time (and cost, though cheaper than a 
degree) to prepare.   The program is not technology specific and measures 
people and business skills as well.

This differs from a traditional approach to certification which requires 
the user to sit for a two hour test and answer some multiple choice 
questions.   It might be worth looking into.

Just for a shameless plug... this year at the DCPHP Conference in June
- http://dcphpconference.com/ - I'm moderating a PHP IDE shootout.  We
have a pretty good selection of tools represented:

Cal Evans from Zend (Zend IDE);
Wez Furlong from OmniTI (VI/Vim);
Jeff Griffiths from ActiveState (Komodo);
David Sklar from Ning (Emacs);
Eli White from Digg (Textmate);

I've already heard from a few of them talking trash and sharpening
their skills, so it should be a good one.  ;)

Like it is with electricians? No way! An electrician licensed in Mass is not 
allowed to install a wall outlet in NYS. I wonder why? Are the outlets 
different? Does NYS use a totally different form of electrical power? So with 
a state license for coders you can code PHP in NYS, but nobody is allowed to 
run that on an out-of-state server?

Certs are something to get hired into a position, but they have the advantage 
to be more specialized. Unlike a bachelor's degree. 2/3rd of the study time 
are wasted for English, history, art, and whatever else non-major garbage the 
universities make students take. Some universities may be better than others 
and thus offer better bachelor programs, but the most are nothing more than 
mainly catching up what high school didn't bother to teach. I really don't get 
why a bachelor student has to read "The Great Gatsby" for the nth time when 
majoring in CS.
I got by BS from a german university and 30 courses and labs were on-topic, 
with 3 electives venturing into less subject related areas. I took mass 
communication, work safety and technical English. I went on to getting an MS 
at a US university and there was really only one course that didn't consist of 
brainless busy work, but challenged one's mind and had one think. Without 
doubt, that was the course I learned most.
 From that view point I think certifications are a good thing, but it depends. 
There are certs for QA folks and tech writers and I think the vast majority of 
people working in those trades (it's not a profession, isn't it?) don't have 
any and don't plan on getting them. Especially for tech writing, getting a 
cert is something recommended for those who were car mechanics before or horse 
racing judges that didn't make it into FEMA.
Certs are a proof that you are capable of systematic learning and performing 
when needed, just like a bachelor, master, or doctoral degree. It doesn't say 
anything how qualified one is for the job and thus shouldn't be generally a 
requirement unless loss of life and property are directly dependent on that 
accuracy of the work. So having a national cert for an electrician is OK, 
which would include training on special regional requirements (such as piping 
all lines up to the 10th floor in NYC) and how to go about obtaining 
information about regional regulations. Interestingly enough, there is no 
certification required for someone to work on your car breaks.

Nobody from NuSphere? They hired the guy who created dbg, which is _the_ PHP 
debugger. The other's that I mentioned before are probably not interested. 
Luckasoft makes the PHP Editor as a side product, they generally make software 
for product packaging. And Waterproof is from France and they seem to be a 
small shop.
And why ZEND? I tried ZEND and I think it rapidly inhales. I guess that is 
good for the other guys. Komodo is nice, but again, they also somehow can't 
get the debugger to work like NuSphere does.
Want me to come and diss all of them?

You have a valid point about the state certs...which could be 
problematic...however, I do take exception with your characterization 
of liberal arts courses and degrees as "garbage"...as a non-CS major 
who is now in the field and also as someone who believes STRONGLY in 
the "non-vocational, liberal arts model of post-secondary education" 
(i.e. the university is NOT a vocational school).

Seriously though, if you - or anyone else - has questions, comments,
etc that you'd like thrown in the hat for consideration, drop me a
note - keith [at] caseysoftware dot com is better - and I'll add them

Well, I've looked at programs from state universities for mainly science and 
engineering programs and depending on the university between 1/3rd and 2/3rd 
of the courses required have nothing to do with the major. My point is that 
after 12 years of public schooling a student shouldn't need yet another 
English or history course when studying biology or civil engineering.
I did not state that liberal art degrees are garbage, but the same would apply 
to those when an English major is forced to take an introductory physics 
course unless it is for the sake of studying the language used in science.I 
just don't think it is applicable to give someone a BSEE degree when the 
majority of courses attended had nothing to do with electrical engineering. 
That absolutely devalues the BS degree, but I squarely blame the universities 
for that.
See, I consider a university not to be a continuation of high school. A 
university is supposed to train interested candidates in a field of choice 
with the goal to make them subject matter experts in that field. This is how 
many other university systems in the world understand "higher education". One 
reason why foreign specialists are so attractive to US businesses...and the 
fact that under H1B via the employees are tied to the company and can be made 
to do the same job for less money.
I think the liberal arts model is purely used for the reason that most high 
school graduates are not ready for university studies. As a student I want to 
become an expert in the field and not have to learn about the geography of the 
former soviet union or learn polish to cover the foreign language requirement 
(this is what my wife took while getting her BS degree).

Just to make this clear, I did not evaluate and test study at all US 
universities, but I did look at the bachelor programs offered by several state 
univerties in the northeast. I eventually got my MS degree at CCSU and 
compared to the courses I had to attend at the University of Applied Sciences 
in D?sseldorf, Germany that MS level courses were a joke (except for 
Production Management). See, as a young person who goes into deep debt to 
finance a university education I'd want to get some kick ass training and not 
a bunch of fluff courses that make me redo what was covered in high school 
already. Why spend 1,000$ a course to take Art History 101 and Power Walking 
058 when going for a CS degree? I admit that there are courses that are not 
on-subject, but still very important, such as ethics (ask yourself if it is 
really OK to build the next nuclear bomb or the next 800hp, 8 ton version of a 
Hummer), human relations in organizations (be creative and do something else 
other than fire people), and maybe even basic business accounting. And if it 
is has to be a hisry course, provide one that applies to the major. I rather 
have a CS graduate who knows who invented the first applied programming 
language rather than one who knows all about President Hoover (no, he did not 
invent the vacuum cleaner). Maybe with better trained university graduates the 
need for certifications would be a moot point.

Also, I am in no way intent to ridicule BS/BA degree holders or suggest that 
they didn't work hard for their degree. I just think that especially CS 
graduates should rather read Complaint Management by Stauss & Seidel rather 
than Huckleberry Finn for the third time.

Message-ID: <52113.192.168.1.71.1208381532.webmail@192.168.1.71>

<rant>
    This is a continuity reboot of the "Webmaster test" thread.

    I'm a member of the ACM,  although I don't know why.  There's a lot of handwringing in "Communications of the ACM" about the state of the IT job markets...  Is it expanding or contracting?  Why aren't more women in IT?  It sounds like "blah blah blah" to me.

    You hear a lot of talk about the threat of outsourcing to US IT jobs...  The way I see it,  outsourcing doesn't cause unemployment for IT workers but it does lower our pay and it does lower our social status -- which is the point people don't talk about.

    I see two things that suck about careers in IT:  (1) the pay,  and (2) working for people who don't know what they hell they're doing.

    I'm not going to complain about my current situation,  which is pretty much what I need at this point in my life,  but,  like a lot of people in IT,  I've worked at a string of crazy places.

    IT jobs pay better than working for Wal*Mart,  but my brother-in-law,  who works as a foreman on a construction site,  gets paid better than me -- despite the fact that I've got twice the education and skills that seem to be rare and in demand...  (It's always seemed that way no matter which side of the table I've sit at in job interviews)  Construction workers have a union,  but IT people don't work.

    Last summer I was a contractor at a company that had a great culture,  great clients and was working with interesting and fun technology.  I got offered a job that had a big 401K (makes wall street rich) and the potential for a large bonus,  but no health insurance.  I mean,  I've got a PhD and I can't even manage a middle class existence?

    The work I do takes as much training,  skill and independent thought as being a doctor,  a lawyer or accountant -- but I don't get paid accordingly and I don't get the respect...  For a while I worked at a place that hosted a talk by the author of a book called "Leading Geeks" -- could anybody get away with writing a book about "Leading Niggers?"

    Connected with the low social status of IT,  there's the whole problem of taking orders from people who don't know what's going on...  There are certainly some counterexamples...  Certainly some places that know what time it is,  but there's a reason why so many people feel like Dilbert.

Guys, I have to be honest, this  "Webmaster test" and its associated
threads are a train wreck for me.  I can't stop reading them, although
admittedly I find them ridiculous.

I do believe in the saying, "if you don't have something nice to
say..." which is why I haven't commented thus far, but if this email
below is flamebait, then, well, you got me (and no, I'm not the type
to fall for Rick Rolls).

"Connected with the low social status of IT"
"I've got a PhD and I can't even manage a middle class existence?"
"I see two things that suck about careers in IT:  (1) the pay"

Are you kidding me?  Listen, I don't know you or your status, but this
is not the life I've lived through my career in technology or the
perception I have of the industry, nor is it that of my friends and
colleagues.  I mean no disrespect, but have you actually tried
looking?

To be fair, IT is a very general term, and I suspect you might be in
the more traditional definition of it, meaning corporate LAN support
and the like.  But for web engineers, this should not be the case,
despite the recession.  To be blunt, I have friends and colleagues
with multiple offers, from the "big guys".  The recruiters are calling
and messaging on the social networking sites daily.  So, to paint the
picture that this field is disintegrating, or not really a profession,
or whatever, to lurkers, newbies and veterans alike is just plain
wrong.

As for that 3 comment I flagged, well, I do agree with the 2nd point
you listed there.  That does suck.  But, then again, you see that in
every industry.

Tom -- 

The average corporate attorney makes $200K.  The average attorney in 
business for themselves makes about the same.  The average CPA, about 
150K.  The average doctor, electrician, etc. etc. etc...way more than 
we do.

The AVERAGE programmer makes, what, 80K if on salary?  (I'm self 
employed and the hourly rate I can get from the clients is pretty 
constricted by the market, and I'm trying to bust open that 100K 
barrier but it won't be busted...I'm still on the losing end.)

And you don't feel this is an ISSUE?  You don't honestly feel that the 
social status of the IT profession needs some improvement, that most of 
us are underpaid?

Come on, work with us.

I have what I consider to be more than average experience with
electricians and they are nice folks, but hardly what I'd call on the
top of the "social status" scale and I would question what the average
salary was, but I doubt your numbers.

Really, I doubt your "average".  But it doesn't matter.  You make what
you do because that is what you are willing to work for.  Suppose the
floor fell out of IT tomorrow (literally), and the going rate for PHP
was $10 per hour.  Would you still do it?  Maybe for fun, but not as a
job.  Why?  Because you won't work for that little.  You couldn't
survive.  But you can survive on $80K (or whatever), so you do it.
When you decide that $80K isn't enough, you'll stop working for that
much.

Look at your market.  The "big" consulting firms charge much more and
pay their people much more.  How come they are getting it and you are
not?  That's the question you need to ask.  You shouldn't be looking
for protection from the marketplace, you should be looking for ways to
excel in it.

I am, really!  I'm telling you to not look to others to solve your
problem - it won't help.  Look at things Social Security and pension
plans.  These systems put the burden on others - and they both have
severe flaws which are hurting us now.

Look at what you can do to excel.  How are your sales efforts
(speaking for myself in my experience as a consultant - I always
dreaded sales, but recently realized that it needs to be embraced, not
feared)?  Professional networking?  Who is your customer?  Are their
pockets deep enough?  Are you really taking advantage of your
expertise (are you doing graphics when you are really a DBA at heart)?
 How can you get the work done faster?  Can you invest in tools (store
bought or that you create) to help?  Invest in services?  People?  Can
you reuse code?  Are you tracking problems so that you don't make the
same mistake again?

There are answers, but no one just pays more for your services "just because".

Tom

Tom, like a lot of the folks on this list, I'm a PHP programmer 
developing internet applications (coding forms, building MySQL 
databases, meeting with clients to determine requirements, etc. etc.).  
I've been doing this (in different languages and platforms) for 10 
years and in PHP for the past 2 years (and love PHP!).  I do this for a 
living because I like doing it, I'd probably be better off in 
retirement if I went to law school in the near future but I don't want 
to do this.  I want to be a programmer.  I just want to get paid what 
my skills are WORTH as a programmer.

I'd love to charge my clients more.  And I've recently gotten wise to 
opportunities where clients are able to offer me part ownership of 
startups in addition to hourly consulting rates.  But...I do think that 
clients price things out and give bids to people who charge reasonable 
rates.  There is a reason I get 90% of the projects I bid on.  If I 
asked for $100 an hour, that would be great, but $100 an hour for 0 
hours is, well....zero dollars.

As a self employed person I'd love to hear any real, usable suggestions 
on how to increase income.  My network is great and I have tons of 
projects going, business is growing every day as I meet new 
people...but the market does price at a certain level and if I start 
asking for more than people can afford, or more than others with my 
same skills are getting paid...I am not going to get hired.

Your libertarian jawflap about how Social Security is  "hurting us" (I 
disagree) and how the market is totally open for me to charge whatever 
I want are well...interesting theory and pretty typical politics for a 
certain segment of the IT industry...but.  And saying I "look to 
others" to "solve my problems" is beyond a low blow, it's just too 
stupid a remark to even rebut.

Thanks,

Kristina

The salary numbers on that site (46K for an accountant?? Secretaries 
make more than this) seem way low, and I was moreso referring to NYC 
salaries...if my numbers are way off, I do apologize...but I do feel 
that these professions are overall more lucrative to practitioners than 
IT is...

I love these discussions with you guys, I'm not intimidated in the 
least, as you can see, to be a minority in a "male" IT profession (or 
discussion board!)  :)!

I used to get 85%+ of the projects I was pitching... and working 60+
hour weeks for those projects.  Then I talked with a few others and
found out that I was charging less then half than I should have been.
I steadily increased my rates over time and still get about 50-60% of
the projects that I pitch.  But the dollars work out even better than
before.

If you go too high, yes, you will win 0% of the projects... but this
is an optimization problem from Econ 101:

Qty Sold * Price = Revenue

Keith -- I see where you are going with this, I don't know much we want 
to go into rates on this public board ... but if I am underbilling I 
would like to know about it.

PS I think I dropped Econ 101 in Summer 1982 ...?  OOOPS!

Maybe the problem is you haven't met anyone on the other side.  I just
did a gig with a large consulting company and you would fall off your
chair if you know what they were paid for a one page (but very
interactive) site.  You have to ask yourself why they are getting it
and you are not.

And saying I "look to

I didn't mean it as an insult, so if it came across that way, I
apologize.  But, you can't stand there and say that you are not making
what you are worth.  If you agreed to the price, then that's what it
is worth.  Prices rise for a reason: expenses, inflation.  Why aren't
your fees rising?  Because of others in the market?  Then how come
they can work for less?  I don't think it is jawflap - you really need
to ask these questions.  If your fees can't rise, what can you do to
earn more?

But, I do agree that this conversation has gone on a bit too long.
I'll stop now.

Not suggesting or describing rates, just stating the basic economics of it.  ;)

Gee, as a QA specialist / lead I get not even the 80k. So why should a 
developer get that much money? Developers make software so that QA can test 
it. For that QA should get paid more than developers. And even more, support 
covers the butts of QA which covered the butts of the developers and yet 
support gets paid crap compared to even a QA guy. I think developers are 
already overvalued, but the same applies to doctors (although depends, the PCP 
that gets called in the middle of the night deserves good pay) and lawyers. I 
also think that the front desk person deserves the highest pay, same applies 
to administrative assistance. While the big wigs play golf these fine people 
keep a business running. I know that from first hand experience. I worked at a 
place where among others the receptionist got laid off. After a week all hell 
broke loose. No office supplies, the water company did not get paid (neither 
did the electric and gas companies, or anyone else), customers left hundreds 
of messages and ran over to the competition because nobody bothered to reroute 
the phone lines or shut off the email accounts. And I am sure that everything 
will work fine if all the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies get laid off. And 
some companies do that. When I started working at Henkel in Germany for the 
first time they had 27 layers of management. When I worked there the last time 
they were down to less than a dozen. Stuff got done the same as before, but 
without spending millions on chair farters.

But no matter who you ask, that person always makes not enough money. Ask 
A-Rod and I am sure that he would love to get paid even more. They are all 
whiners, just look at that multi-billionaire who lost big in that Bear Stearns 
deal. OK, he lost about a billion bucks, but he still has 4 billion left! Even 
he is whining and feels cheated.

Honestly, I would be the happiest person on earth if I could make anything 
close to 80k. I think that is plenty awesome money for a 9ish to 5ish job. I'd 
be happy with even 70k. Not to say that I am grossly underpaid at the moment. 
Pay is OK, feeds the family and secures a home and then a bit is even left. 
But with even more money, I guess we'd just spend it all and then what, 
complain again it is not enough. We are quite spoiled, there are many who have 
to get by on 30k and no benefits. How can one work full time and not even have 
decent health insurance? Now those are the folks that have a right to complain!

That's actually not true, and your apparent belief in this untruth is
probably what has led to your seemingly very strongly felt distaste for
university education.

The purpose of a college or university is to provide the student with an
education, so that the student may go on to contribute back to society.  An
education involves more than just learning a trade, or a skill.  Moreover,
most experts in any field are usually well-versed in some other field as
well; this is what allows educated people to do things like draw analogies,
or relate to non-technical people.  Physicists must read the classics in
English literature so that non-physicists will talk to them at dinner
parties; this helps with things like professional networking.  (Everyone who
got your job because you know the right non-IT person, raise your hands.
David, look at all those hands!)  No one expects a physicist to be able to
prattle on about Huck Finn like a lit professor; but the physicist shouldn't
just stare open-mouthed, either.  "Yes, Mark Twain was an important figure
in American Literature" will go a long, long way in making friends and
influencing people.  And an English major should take a lab science course
for the exact same reason; in case he finds himself at a dinner party
populated mostly by physicists, knowing at least that there's an inverse
relationship between distance and gravitational pull, even if the English
major doesn't remember or understand that it's an exponential relationship,
can keep him in the conversation long enough to not be embarrassed.

When my programming students complain (and they always do) about how much of
their grade is based on writing, I tell them two things.  First, when I
worked in industry as a programmer, the pointy-haired bosses kept coming to
me for explanations, and eventually asked me to join large inter-department
teams to work on big special projects with all the suits, and eventually
would have asked me to lead those kinds of special projects had I stayed
with that company any longer; and the reason they kept tapping me, over my
colleagues, was that I was an effective communicator, and I was able to
translate plans to code, and feature requests to timetables, but also code
to English, and bug hunts to revised timetables; and I didn't scare the
suits away when I talked to them.  And I owe that to my liberal-arts
undergrad experience, taking a BA in CS, with a creative writing course and
a public speaking course and all the trimmings.  I even made use of
something I learned in a phys ed course, when I was tutoring a
seventh-grader in math last school year.  He really wanted to shoot baskets
more than do math problems, and so I gave him five minutes if he got a few
questions right.  Of course he got those questions right, and off we went to
shoot baskets.  But he had a great deal of trouble passing me the
basketball, and I taught him the bounce pass, the way I learned it as a
college junior.  His mom kept hiring me back to tutor him, because he really
liked me after that (and the grades slowly went up).

The other thing I tell my students is that out there in the real world,
where all you guys are, people judge other people's intelligence, fairly or
not, according to how effectively they communicate, and that the only two
things that make you a better writer are 1) writing a lot, and 2) reading a
lot.

So, anyway, I felt compelled to write, because I'm afraid that people trying
to choose whether to get a college education or not might be misled into
thinking it's something it's not.  The service we provide is not something
you can get anywhere else, and for lots of people, it's the difference
between promotions or not.

Hi All,

I am trying to connect to /dev/tty.USA28Xb2P1.1 which is a Keyspan USB to
Serial adapter. I have had success using the screen utility, #screen
/dev/tty.USA28Xb2P1.1 but I would like to use PHP to create a web interface
to a microcontroller.

I have attempted fopen with no luck:

I have tried SerProxy but cannot get a connection through telnet. I have
also tried LibSerial but could only find version 0.5.2 which does not yet
support PHP apparently... I have read about IOKit but I am not sure it will
get me where I want to be.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

Hello Corey,

This doesn't really answer your question, but I've recently been doing 
java serial work on osx for some robotics stuff.
Take a look at http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

Sorry I dont have more specific php info.

Huh? I got two university degrees and did so voluntarily. So what you say is 
clearly not the case. My point is that someone who for example takes a BSEE 
program at Alfred State College is required to have 132 credits for 
graduation. From those 132 credits 60 credit hours are for liberal arts 
classes and other sciences that are non-major. Not all of those may be totally 
off topic, but I don't get why a BSEE student has to take american history 
again or take an arts course (or even more than just one). The 13 years K-12 
ought to have covered that. I also think that a high school graduate should be 
capable of properly expressing thoughts in speech and writing and not needing 
yet another round of English courses. I got my BSEE degree at a non-US 
university in a seven semester program with a total of 154 credits and as 
mentioned before only 3 courses were not that much related to engineering.

> The purpose of a college or university is to provide the student with an

Ah, c'mon! Reading books to children or planting trees or donating blood or 
driving people to their doctor's appointments - that is giving back to 
society. Getting a university degree is for the sake of getting a better job 
with better pay and ideally get some more exposure to a subject that one 
likes. How does getting a degree in finance and becoming a greedy investment 
banker give back to society? I can see getting a degree in social work being 
something that gives back to society. Or do you mean that graduates get better 
paying jobs and thus pay more taxes and that helps funding government programs?


I agree with the rest that you wrote and I don't think it collides with what I 
wrote earlier. My point is that compared to other countries US universities 
focus way too much on a broad education rather than on transferring 
specialized skills and knowledge of a specific subject. And I think that is 
why foreign workers especially in IT have an advantage. I'm not saying that an 
extra writing course is useless or that art history is utterly unimportant, 
but I think that is something that shouldn't be part of a university program.

The reason is that Alfred State, like most colleges and universities, has a
mission to create not just workers, but educated men and women.

Oh, if only.  Buy me a beer some day, and I will regale you with horror
stories from my closing-in-on-eight years in the trenches.  (Bear in mind
that I work at a community college with open enrollment.)  By far our most
popular courses are remedial math, remedial English (composition), and
remedial reading.  Just last night I taught college-age students how to

(Of course, if there is a silver lining to all this, it's that with CS and
IT enrollment in the toilet, thank Ged for so many remedial sections -- it's
why I still have a job.)

That may have been your reason for going to college, but it wasn't mine.
The university system is set up to be self-sufficient; that is, for every i
job-seeking career-advancing students, there are j students who intend,
formally or otherwise, to share their knowledge with the community -- as
professional (there's that word again!) educators, or as employers who hire
interns, or as other professionals who also blog (like Chris S.), etc.  Of
course there is overlap -- no one is expected to take John Lennon's lyrics
literally -- but there are lots of people who go to college for the
education they will receive, and the education they will pass on.

There is that, if you want to look at it cynically.  But that investment
banker will probably pass on some knowledge to his or her underlings,
helping them to become better greedy investment bankers, etc.  People who
work necessarily promote the society in which they work -- that's why
someone gives them money for it.


> [...] US universities focus way too much on a broad education


It's "way too much" in your estimation only.  Most people who are part of
the system -- as students, faculty, or administration -- either consider it
just the right amount, or they quit.  But it's a system that's been working
for 200+ years.

And I think it goes back to the preparation angle.  Other countries place a
far higher emphasis on early education, and so therefore children are more
comfortable with math and science, and less likely to be called nerds and
geeks for it.  And, by the way, based on my totally unscientific,
insufficient, and now-cloudy observations from my days in industry, foreign
IT workers often have a far tougher time moving up the corporate ladder, and
potentially for the same reason that some Americans might -- an inability to
communicate effectively gets them labeled as "dumb" or "lazy", etc., by the
people whose opinions matter, when in fact, they might just be incredibly
smart and talented products of a technical school rather than a liberal arts
school.

(This is going to sound like I made it up just to argue the point, but I
swear it's true.)  I am refreshing my New York State EMT certification this
spring, and one of the instructors is a guy who was in my Art History class
in undergrad.  If I had the time and inclination, I could probably get a few
bucks out of him by offering to cut him a deal redesigning his employers'
web site.  If there are no other reasons, there's one for keeping Art
History in the Engineering program.  :)

"I want to be a programmer.  I just want to get paid what my skills
are WORTH as a programmer."

As a hobby economist I have to respond to this one. :D

It sounds to me like you'd like to legislate what you're worth. That
approach causes even more problems than it solves because it means a
lot of people who could be employed at lower rates will now be
unemployable, period. We are all worth what the market says we're
worth. If demand for talented developers is high, and supply is low
(as I've seen here in NYC) then you'll be paid handsomely. If demand
is low, and supply is high, then you'll be paid very little.

If you believe you are worth more than you're currently getting - than
quit! Find another job that pays you what you're looking for. I know
from experience that there are 100k+ jobs out there for *good* PHP
developers (granted, it's my personal belief that it takes a little
more than just developer skills to hit that mark, but they *are* out
there).

Dictating by government fiat what a "programmer" should make only
exacerbates the problem by leaving all those sub-par developers out in
the cold - completely unemployable in their industry. With that
prospect, average developers will never even have the chance to become
above-average.

Ok, so with all this talk, and everyone wanting to make some money, why can't I get a decent resume across my desk?!

I am offering - imo - perhaps the best and most challenging work environment I've seen since I got to NY, and the only people who are handing me decent resumes are recruiters who are looking to earn 20 pct of YOUR salaries...

If any of you are the real deal - from QA to dev or anywhere in between - please, please give me a call or shoot me an email offline? 

And if you're not interested, then please stop asking the world why you can't seem to make a decent living - right here, right now, I can state matter of fact that I can offer that tomorrow to one or two of you, no problem, as long - as Tom says - you, youself, are truly worth it.

And believe it or not, assuming I'm not alone in this, hiring managers are possibly more frustrated than you all are! There are a lot more true employment opporunities out there than there are truly talented programmers to fill them!

Digest that :-)

Good debate, though, overall...I'm enjoying the read

Gee, as a QA specialist / lead I get not even the 80k. So why should a 
developer get that much money? Developers make software so that QA can test 
it. For that QA should get paid more than developers. And even more, support 
covers the butts of QA which covered the butts of the developers and yet 
support gets paid crap compared to even a QA guy. I think developers are 
already overvalued, but the same applies to doctors (although depends, the PCP 
that gets called in the middle of the night deserves good pay) and lawyers. I 
also think that the front desk person deserves the highest pay, same applies 
to administrative assistance. While the big wigs play golf these fine people 
keep a business running. I know that from first hand experience. I worked at a 
place where among others the receptionist got laid off. After a week all hell 
broke loose. No office supplies, the water company did not get paid (neither 
did the electric and gas companies, or anyone else), customers left hundreds 
of messages and ran over to the competition because nobody bothered to reroute 
the phone lines or shut off the email accounts. And I am sure that everything 
will work fine if all the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies get laid off. And 
some companies do that. When I started working at Henkel in Germany for the 
first time they had 27 layers of management. When I worked there the last time 
they were down to less than a dozen. Stuff got done the same as before, but 
without spending millions on chair farters.

But no matter who you ask, that person always makes not enough money. Ask 
A-Rod and I am sure that he would love to get paid even more. They are all 
whiners, just look at that multi-billionaire who lost big in that Bear Stearns 
deal. OK, he lost about a billion bucks, but he still has 4 billion left! Even 
he is whining and feels cheated.

Honestly, I would be the happiest person on earth if I could make anything 
close to 80k. I think that is plenty awesome money for a 9ish to 5ish job. I'd 
be happy with even 70k. Not to say that I am grossly underpaid at the moment. 
Pay is OK, feeds the family and secures a home and then a bit is even left. 
But with even more money, I guess we'd just spend it all and then what, 
complain again it is not enough. We are quite spoiled, there are many who have 
to get by on 30k and no benefits. How can one work full time and not even have 
decent health insurance? Now those are the folks that have a right to complain!

Better yet, why don't you come on by and see for youself? :-) I'd love to finally meet you in person, and ask you a few questions about why the heck certain things are the way they are :-)

Think of the quickly growing popularity of tags on the internet which
show graphically the (expected and often unexpected) relationships
between ideas and concepts in the results of a topic search. 

Or think of the movie Cube (also Cube 2, Cube 3) which is essentially
about some mathematical construct that shows that when you are
positioned inside a cube that theoretically all six of the inside walls
of your cube are simultaneously acting as the outside wall of a whole
set of cubes that are all pressed against each of the walls of your
cube. And all those cubes have more cubes pressing against their walls.
Creating this infinite expanse of cubes that are all interlocked by the
touching cube walls.

I forget even the theoretical purpose of this infinite cube construct or
why scientists have devised it, but it does seem to vividly show how
everything is connected rather infinitely and complexly. And that nature
is infinitely complex and interrelated at all levels from micro to the
massively macro scale of super complex galaxy groups that are bonded by
gravitational pull. 

Bear in mind there is a known psychological profile that shows that some
people really don't want maximum success, that they purposefully
self-sabotage their maximum career success because they have deep
personal feelings that are at odds with their ambitions. Commonly, as it
turns out, on a deeply personal level many people really just don't like
the constant responsibility associated with maximum career success.  Or,
of course, many people have serious issues with money: they feel it is
dirty, not a noble objective, very material and that the desire to gain
heaps of money is a bad reflection on their otherwise more pure personal
ethic. And if money was a bitter family contention when one was a child,
those bittersweet memories may make many like kryptonite in your hands. 

The net net of this note is that this webmaster test discussion quickly
uncovered how everything that is going on in one's life is all
intertwined: business choices and paths, education history, friendship
model, the feng shui of your home and neighborhood, even your health
issues and how you eat, how you decide to express and present yourself,
even how you deal with your sleeping dreams: all these matters are
interrelated and affecting the moment by moment outcome of everything in
your life. (Did you know it has been shown that people who sleep next to

One may need to look into many aspects of their life to find where is
the crux of the current obstacle/problem/issue(s) at hand: is the
stumbling block here in the task that is before me or over there where I
never eat right at breakfast and then I cannot concentrate. Or eating
too little for extended periods makes me somewhat grouchy and sharp
tongued causing me to appear flinty with coworkers when not intended. Or
is a toothache I don't correct distracting me at all times... 

The webmaster test thread shows clearly how everything (seems like
everything) is interrelated and you cannot discuss or look for the
answer to an issue within a single sphere of life/business. Look a layer
up or down, look a strata to the left. It is all a sliding scale of
grays, even what appears black and white is just real dark and very
light gray.

Huh? I got two university degrees and did so voluntarily. So what you
say is 
clearly not the case. My point is that someone who for example takes a
BSEE 
program at Alfred State College is required to have 132 credits for 
graduation. From those 132 credits 60 credit hours are for liberal arts 
classes and other sciences that are non-major. Not all of those may be
totally 
off topic, but I don't get why a BSEE student has to take american
history 
again or take an arts course (or even more than just one). The 13 years
K-12 
ought to have covered that. I also think that a high school graduate
should be 
capable of properly expressing thoughts in speech and writing and not
needing 
yet another round of English courses. I got my BSEE degree at a non-US 
university in a seven semester program with a total of 154 credits and
as 
mentioned before only 3 courses were not that much related to
engineering.

Ah, c'mon! Reading books to children or planting trees or donating blood
or 
driving people to their doctor's appointments - that is giving back to 
society. Getting a university degree is for the sake of getting a better
job 
with better pay and ideally get some more exposure to a subject that one

likes. How does getting a degree in finance and becoming a greedy
investment 
banker give back to society? I can see getting a degree in social work
being 
something that gives back to society. Or do you mean that graduates get
better 
paying jobs and thus pay more taxes and that helps funding government
programs?


I agree with the rest that you wrote and I don't think it collides with
what I 
wrote earlier. My point is that compared to other countries US
universities 
focus way too much on a broad education rather than on transferring 
specialized skills and knowledge of a specific subject. And I think that
is 
why foreign workers especially in IT have an advantage. I'm not saying
that an 
extra writing course is useless or that art history is utterly
unimportant, 
but I think that is something that shouldn't be part of a university
program.

         Basic economics. The output of a "big company" is more desirable,
for a variety of reasons, that the output of an independent contractor. In
addition that have a substantially more effective marketing effort than you

This is a tough industry.

You are writing software for an openly hostile environment (the
internet), using a grab-bag of hashed-up "standards", that has to look
good and work right on at least 3 different platforms (MSIE, Gecko,
and WebKit).

On top of all that, unless you work as a cog in the wheels of a big
firm, you also have to have the interpersonal and business skills to
pitch jobs and collect money from clients.

No sane engineer would actually choose to be a web developer.

Just sayin.

David, I'm shocked that a CS MS would require anything outside of the field, 
that seems very odd to me.  Maybe things have changed since the *cough, cough* 
years since I got my Bachelor's, but even when I was getting my Bachelor's 
(Mechanics and Materials Science, essentially Mechanical Engineering, from 
Hopkins), the non-major requirements (credits for liberal arts, natural science, 
etc) were down around 20 credits or less, and if you were clever, you could find 
courses that were useful.  The liberal arts requirement as I remember 
consisted of one year-long course -- I took Russian for that.
 
On the other hand, in-major course requirements weren't that onerous either, 
so I could take Electrical Engineering, Economics and Math Sciences 
(Optimization, Stats) to, in a sense, design my own major.  It's funny, even though I've 
been doing analysis/design/programming for all these years, I took very 
little CS.

Well, I've looked at programs from state universities for mainly science and 
engineering programs and depending on the university between 1/3rd and 2/3rd 
of the courses required have nothing to do with the major. My point is that 
after 12 years of public schooling a student shouldn't need yet another 
English or history course when studying biology or civil engineering.
I did not state that liberal art degrees are garbage, but the same would 
apply 
to those when an English major is forced to take an introductory physics 
course unless it is for the sake of studying the language used in science.I 
just don't think it is applicable to give someone a BSEE degree when the 
majority of courses attended had nothing to do with electrical engineering. 
That absolutely devalues the BS degree, but I squarely blame the universities 
for that.
See, I consider a university not to be a continuation of high school. A 
university is supposed to train interested candidates in a field of choice 
with the goal to make them subject matter experts in that field. This is how 
many other university systems in the world understand "higher education". One 
reason why foreign specialists are so attractive to US businesses...and the 
fact that under H1B via the employees are tied to the company and can be made 
to do the same job for less money.
I think the liberal arts model is purely used for the reason that most high 
school graduates are not ready for university studies. As a student I want to 
become an expert in the field and not have to learn about the geography of 
the 
former soviet union or learn polish to cover the foreign language requirement 
(this is what my wife took while getting her BS degree).

Just to make this clear, I did not evaluate and test study at all US 
universities, but I did look at the bachelor programs offered by several 
state 
univerties in the northeast. I eventually got my MS degree at CCSU and 
compared to the courses I had to attend at the University of Applied Sciences 
in D?sseldorf, Germany that MS level courses were a joke (except for 
Production Management). See, as a young person who goes into deep debt to 
finance a university education I'd want to get some kick ass training and not 
a bunch of fluff courses that make me redo what was covered in high school 
already. Why spend 1,000$ a course to take Art History 101 and Power Walking 
058 when going for a CS degree? I admit that there are courses that are not 
on-subject, but still very important, such as ethics (ask yourself if it is 
really OK to build the next nuclear bomb or the next 800hp, 8 ton version of 
a 
Hummer), human relations in organizations (be creative and do something else 
other than fire people), and maybe even basic business accounting. And if it 
is has to be a hisry course, provide one that applies to the major. I rather 
have a CS graduate who knows who invented the first applied programming 
language rather than one who knows all about President Hoover (no, he did not 
invent the vacuum cleaner). Maybe with better trained university graduates 
the 
need for certifications would be a moot point.

Also, I am in no way intent to ridicule BS/BA degree holders or suggest that 
they didn't work hard for their degree. I just think that especially CS 
graduates should rather read Complaint Management by Stauss & Seidel rather 
than Huckleberry Finn for the third time.

Let's be intellectually honest Kristina,

It's hard to take your emails with a dose of sincerity, when your 
scholarship seems random and a result of passion. Phrases like 
"Secretaries make more than this" and posting what you "feel" is the 
average income for a particular profession (without citation or 
reference), leads the reader to thinking you're angry or whiny.

If however you are sincere, I do think that there is a particular 
paragraph in Tom's reply that should be of interest:

-TOM MELENDEZ -
 >Look at what you can do to excel. How are your sales efforts

>  bought or that you create) to help? Invest in services? People? Can
>  you reuse code? Are you tracking problems so that you don't make the
>  same mistake again?

This paragraph reminds me of a book my friend recommended some time ago, entitled, "What color is your parachute?". The whole concept is not looking to an outside change, when sculpting your small business growth, but looking at your inner development and maturation. And in so doing, specific areas of personal growth will be obviously and easily leveraged to grow your small business substantially. Then, hopefully, it becomes a beautiful cycle of inner growth -> application -> business growth -> inner growth

Good point Keith (BTW, hi - I met you at DCPHP BS last month) -- if you're 
over 40 hours/week, then it's time to increase the rate incrementally on the 
next few bids.
 
But if you're under 40hrs/week (or whatever hours you seek), then you may 
have to reduce the rate.  Supply and demand.

I used to get 85%+ of the projects I was pitching... and working 60+
hour weeks for those projects.  Then I talked with a few others and
found out that I was charging less then half than I should have been.
I steadily increased my rates over time and still get about 50-60% of
the projects that I pitch.  But the dollars work out even better than
before.

If you go too high, yes, you will win 0% of the projects... but this
is an optimization problem from Econ 101:

Gee, as a QA specialist / lead I get not even the 80k. So why should a 
developer get that much money? Developers make software so that QA can test 
it. For that QA should get paid more than developers. And even more, support 
covers the butts of QA which covered the butts of the developers and yet 
support gets paid crap compared to even a QA guy. I think developers are 
already overvalued, but the same applies to doctors (although depends, the 
PCP 
that gets called in the middle of the night deserves good pay) and lawyers. I 
also think that the front desk person deserves the highest pay, same applies 
to administrative assistance. While the big wigs play golf these fine people 
keep a business running. I know that from first hand experience. I worked at 
a 
place where among others the receptionist got laid off. After a week all hell 
broke loose. No office supplies, the water company did not get paid (neither 
did the electric and gas companies, or anyone else), customers left hundreds 
of messages and ran over to the competition because nobody bothered to 
reroute 
the phone lines or shut off the email accounts. And I am sure that everything 
will work fine if all the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies get laid off. And 
some companies do that. When I started working at Henkel in Germany for the 
first time they had 27 layers of management. When I worked there the last 
time 
they were down to less than a dozen. Stuff got done the same as before, but 
without spending millions on chair farters.

But no matter who you ask, that person always makes not enough money. Ask 
A-Rod and I am sure that he would love to get paid even more. They are all 
whiners, just look at that multi-billionaire who lost big in that Bear 
Stearns 
deal. OK, he lost about a billion bucks, but he still has 4 billion left! 
Even 
he is whining and feels cheated.

Honestly, I would be the happiest person on earth if I could make anything 
close to 80k. I think that is plenty awesome money for a 9ish to 5ish job. 
I'd 
be happy with even 70k. Not to say that I am grossly underpaid at the moment. 
Pay is OK, feeds the family and secures a home and then a bit is even left. 
But with even more money, I guess we'd just spend it all and then what, 
complain again it is not enough. We are quite spoiled, there are many who 
have 
to get by on 30k and no benefits. How can one work full time and not even 
have 
decent health insurance? Now those are the folks that have a right to 
complain!

Save for the fact that this is where a majority of the growth in
software engineering has been happening for the past 8 years. Despite
all the whining and moaning, this is where IT is at! During my last
job search, LAMP developers were regarded as the golden children,
eternally blessed and desired. According to the hiring agency (I know,
evil hiring agencies)  I worked through, they couldn't try hard enough
to find LAMP developers, it's all people were asking for.  Web is here
to stay, almost all new projects / companies are centered around web
technologies. We have all hit the jackpot, if you don't like your
current situation, I suggest you take a harder look at all of the
opportunity to be had.

PS, The one field that the hiring agency wasn't looking for? Finance.

Yes, but maybe the best opportunities are not available to independents? Just a thought

This may have been mentioned already, but maybe the best people out there are independent?

Ok, so with all this talk, and everyone wanting to make some money, why can't I get a decent resume across my desk?!

I am offering - imo - perhaps the best and most challenging work environment I've seen since I got to NY, and the only people who are handing me decent resumes are recruiters who are looking to earn 20 pct of YOUR salaries...

If any of you are the real deal - from QA to dev or anywhere in between - please, please give me a call or shoot me an email offline? 

And if you're not interested, then please stop asking the world why you can't seem to make a decent living - right here, right now, I can state matter of fact that I can offer that tomorrow to one or two of you, no problem, as long - as Tom says - you, youself, are truly worth it.

And believe it or not, assuming I'm not alone in this, hiring managers are possibly more frustrated than you all are! There are a lot more true employment opporunities out there than there are truly talented programmers to fill them!

Digest that :-)

Good debate, though, overall...I'm enjoying the read

Gee, as a QA specialist / lead I get not even the 80k. So why should a 
developer get that much money? Developers make software so that QA can test 
it. For that QA should get paid more than developers. And even more, support 
covers the butts of QA which covered the butts of the developers and yet 
support gets paid crap compared to even a QA guy. I think developers are 
already overvalued, but the same applies to doctors (although depends, the PCP 
that gets called in the middle of the night deserves good pay) and lawyers. I 
also think that the front desk person deserves the highest pay, same applies 
to administrative assistance. While the big wigs play golf these fine people 
keep a business running. I know that from first hand experience. I worked at a 
place where among others the receptionist got laid off. After a week all hell 
broke loose. No office supplies, the water company did not get paid (neither 
did the electric and gas companies, or anyone else), customers left hundreds 
of messages and ran over to the competition because nobody bothered to reroute 
the phone lines or shut off the email accounts. And I am sure that everything 
will work fine if all the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies get laid off. And 
some companies do that. When I started working at Henkel in Germany for the 
first time they had 27 layers of management. When I worked there the last time 
they were down to less than a dozen. Stuff got done the same as before, but 
without spending millions on chair farters.

But no matter who you ask, that person always makes not enough money. Ask 
A-Rod and I am sure that he would love to get paid even more. They are all 
whiners, just look at that multi-billionaire who lost big in that Bear Stearns 
deal. OK, he lost about a billion bucks, but he still has 4 billion left! Even 
he is whining and feels cheated.

Honestly, I would be the happiest person on earth if I could make anything 
close to 80k. I think that is plenty awesome money for a 9ish to 5ish job. I'd 
be happy with even 70k. Not to say that I am grossly underpaid at the moment. 
Pay is OK, feeds the family and secures a home and then a bit is even left. 
But with even more money, I guess we'd just spend it all and then what, 
complain again it is not enough. We are quite spoiled, there are many who have 
to get by on 30k and no benefits. How can one work full time and not even have 
decent health insurance? Now those are the folks that have a right to complain!

Speaking from the side of the "Evil Ones", and having been one here in
Manhattan for a few years now, I would have to agree with Jake and
Jason.  In the last 1.5 years even surprisingly average developers are
getting multiple offers with in a week of being on the market and most
of them are using multiple recruiters.  At the agency I work for we have
not had no less then 3 PHP development positions that we were trying to
fill at any one time for the last year.  If you asked me 4 years ago I
wouldn't have known what PHP was.  If are are looking for higher paying
work, my advise would be to do some research on which skills are in most
demand.  Us "Evil Ones" tend to have that info readily available.

In case anyone doubts what Gary is saying, I would like to add that he
got me my first job out of college two years ago, when I had only
cursory PHP experience, as, you guessed it, a software developer
working primarily in PHP.

And that is my point. As mentioned in other emails, the BSEE program I 
randomly picked as it was one of the top results from Google asked for a total 
of 132 credits and from those 60 credits that were basically labeled as 
non-major courses, so that is about half of all course work required. I know 
that this differs from school to school, but as mentioned I attended a 
university that asked for 150 credits on-major course work, yet I got the same 
BSEE degree. But am I that wrong in thinking that I got a better engineering 
education?
In the MS program things were mainly on-topic, but for a good part on such a 
basic level that I wondered if I registered for the right course. I epxected 
it to be intelectually challanging, not just a lot of work. One course was 
about e-business, the book was of horrible quality and the course wasn't much 
better. The recurring task was to read 50 pages and then write a ten page 
paper about it. And that week after week. We did have to do a project as well 
and I did a PHP script that took entries from an HTML form and writes them to 
a file. The script and pages were for submitting support tickets for software. 
I never created an HTML page before nor did I have any good relation with 
programming. I came to the conclusion that programming hates me and that I 
hate programming, which is why I chose to do a programming project. That was 
the only tough task in that course and only because I chose to make it difficult.
My impression was that the department wanted to make the courses easy and 
fluffy on purpose so that many students pass and graduate, which boosts the 
numbers on paper and makes the university look good.

One other thing I find silly is the constant hand holding at US universities 
with advisors and mandatory meetings. I found that to be disturbing that the 
school considers me to be that limited in my capabilities to sign up for the 
mandatory courses and pick from those that are in the "Other" bucket. Once 
done I register for the thesis and at that point someone checks if I passed 
all the required course work. I found that having an advisor assigned to me 
was make work for both me and her.
So did you end up designing your major or did you have to sit down with 
someone for hours debating why this course is better than that course?

Well, the only written warning in high school due to bad grades that I ever 
got was for English. Fast forward a few years and I got hired as technical 
writer at a US research foundation. I guess we each picked up what we needed 
at some other place.

Tom,

As someone who grew up under a communist regime, I absolutely love your anti-protectionist attitude. However, I have a factual issue with what you said about IT salaries:

    Look at your market.  The "big" consulting firms 
    charge much more and pay their people much more.  
    How come they are getting it and you are not?  
    That's the question you need to ask.  You 
    shouldn't be looking for protection from the 
    marketplace, you should be looking for ways to 
    excel in it.

I have worked for two of the Big consulting firms for several year. I am very familiar with their particular way of doing business and I'd like to make two points. 

1. Hourly Rates 

In my case, I was billed out at ~$350/hour while making $80K/year. The easy conclusion is: cut out the middle man and take $350/hour for yourself. A slightly more thoughtful conclusion is: cut my rate down to say, $250, since I no longer have a shiny midtown office with a support staff, enterprise hardware/licenses ready to go, etc, etc. But the real deal is something else altogether. The real reason managers hire the big guns is risk assurance, or what is known in consultant speak as "you can't get fired for choosing IBM". The second you are no longer with a big firm, your bid will never even make to due diligence stage of the proposal process, let alone pass it. 

If you don't believe me, look at recruiters. I am a freelancer now, working through agencies. They make a percentage of what I make and therefore would LOVE to get me a higher rate. They simply can't though. I work with several good agencies and the rates are similar across the board even while they can't find enough people. That tells you something right there about the market. 


2. Salaries

There are indeed people making excellent money at big consulting firms. They are called partners. They may be former engineers, but believe me the only way that they make top bonuses etc is if they SELL. If you see a consultant making really good money, it's because they've been selling projects and just haven't made the full transition from a techie to a partner yet. You will invariably see them in project manager roles, which is the bridge.  


I quit big consulting in 2003 and I've been fairly successful as a freelancer. I also happen to support your viewpoint a 100%, both what you said about the evils of regulation (be it unions, licenses, or whatever) and taking personal responsibility for what we choose to do and for how much. However, facts are facts - IT people make less than others when compared in terms of education and skills, and you did go a little bit Ayn Rand on us when you said that we should be looking to excel instead of complaining. I'd love to live in a world where working hard gets me a pass to a mountain paradise of prosperity but it's just not the case. Let's face it, we do what we do because we like it... not because we couldn't get more mileage elsewhere on same brainpower.

Jake,

Things are going very well, thanks. Growing like crazy, made some very exciting acquisitions, and building out some really nice new tools and features, have a whole new team made up of a bunch of great guys, and who are producing some very solid code and designs. It is nice to watch a true team environment coming together at IA.

Say the word and I will attend the next meeting. I want to meet all these people who's posts I have been reading for the last 6 months.

And I mean what I said, too, I'd love to sit down and talk for a bit if you're interested, I'll buy lunch! :-)

As for the rest of you, several hours have passed now, and not one resume, phone call, or email. Who were the folks saying they couldn't find the good positions again? ;-)

What a strange hiring market this is proving to be.

And while we're on the subject let me point one more frustration that I've been experiencing when it comes to LAMP developers - at the risk of being overly general, MOST ARE SIMPLY NOT DEVELOPERS! If I had a dime for everyone I've come across who claims to have built ecommerce sites, but using OS Commerce. Who claimed to have built corporate websites, but using Drupal. Who claimed to have built social networking and/or blog sites, but using Wordpress or some similar package. Hate to break the news, but - IMO - that is not what makes a developer. 

Now, I'm not saying that you have to recreate the wheel every time, but you do have to understand how to build the wheel if needed. Even now when I show many LAMP developers a new application or program I wrote, the first question I get asked is, "That's really neat! Where did you find it?"

Where did I find it? :-)

Maybe part of the problem is that there are so many available - albeit crappy - pre-built packages out there that the community at large is using the word "developer" too freely? IMO, there is a big difference between developers and - I don't know - "implementers"? 

Implementers can hack together downloaded code (80% of the market); developers can create what doesn't already exist (20% of the market); true developers are only happy when creating what doesn't already exist (5% of the market); and true, talented developers can create what doesn't already exist, and make it secure, scalable, simple, and practical (1% of the market, if that).

True, talented developers should have no trouble finding satisfying and lucrative employment, with benefits, bonuses, the whole nine. And I reiterate - again - my previous offer, if you are a true, talented developer, and you are having trouble, CALL ME :-)

Thanks

In case anyone doubts what Gary is saying, I would like to add that he
got me my first job out of college two years ago, when I had only
cursory PHP experience, as, you guessed it, a software developer
working primarily in PHP.

     I think this is the root cause of the "skilled IT worker" shortage.  I see lots of Generation X'ers leaving the field because they don't see viable paths of advancement.

    Two IT workers I know have gotten into business school because they've had the experience that people just don't take them seriously.  One of them is quite a comic figure these days:  he seems to have deliberately gained 30 pounds and he dyes streaks in his hair so he looks older and more 'experienced'.  The three of all us worked in an organization that practiced a profession that's endangered by the IT revolution:  we didn't have the right degree,  so our opinions just didn't matter -- despite that,  I think we all had better perspectives on where the industry was going than the people who 'mattered' in the organization.

To clarify two things re: the below response:

1.  I most definitely DO NOT WANT TO LEGISLATE pay scales for 
programmers (not even sure where anyone got the idea that I did!).  I 
feel we need to improve the SOCIAL STATUS of the field, so that market 
rates increase in and of themselves.

2.  I cannot "quit my job and find another one", because I'm self 
employed.  Me is counting on me to show up for work!! :)

Oh I assure you that I'm not "angry or whiny" and am completely 
sincere, and also assure you that in NYC, secretaries DO make more than 
46K...not sure why you found that "angry or whiny", it's simply a fact.

doing, specific areas of personal growth will be obviously and easily

To Jason @ InnovationAds.com
 
Jason, from the tone of your email, you think we developers are full of sh*t. If I understand correctly, you can?t get a decent resume across your desk and you are frustrated and desperate to find people to work in ?perhaps the best environment you?ve seen in NY?. 
 
The real picture seems a little different however.
 
According to your website, you don?t have any technology jobs:
http://jobs.innovationads.com/technology
 
And here is just a sample of a long, long list of empty cliches from your employment page. You?d think this was a draft for an article in The Onion: dynamic company, exponential growth, success based on high quality products and services at a low cost , constantly looking for ways to improve in the ways we deliver services, market leader connecting thousands of consumers with businesses every day, multi-faceted organization , believes in maintaining high standards in everything we do, the better we are the better we serve our clients, dedicated to hiring the best in the industry, workforce geared toward achieving even higher levels of success, strong commitment to diversity, diversity helps us meet and exceed our customers' needs, diversity is vital and necessary to our success in providing quality products and services for our clients, committed to helping the environment by carrying out a set of principals which are aligned with the Company?s
 mission, etc. etc. etc.
 
Sorry to be so harsh, but do you honestly think the above paints a good picture for prospective candidates? Your website is the first place we are going to look and it just screams corporate boredom and politics. If it were one percent as passionate and human as your post, perhaps you?d have a better success rate.

Well... I have three degrees and 40+ years of programming and am in 
the same boat as you are.

With the strict definition of a professional being one that requires 
a license and considering that we don't have one, then we aren't.

The problem as I see it is that who is going to license me? Who is 
going to set in judgement of what I know and how competent I am?

Perhaps some NYC government committee? However, their web site 
(nyc.gov) certainly wouldn't pass my evaluation with 183 validation 
errors. Some might say "So what?" to which I say adhering to 
standards is one of the things that licensing is about.

I've been certified in other professions (Geologist CPG-2297, for 
example), and the problem is what is the certification process and 
what do they consider as important?

The web is changing everyday and I can't see any group keeping up 
with it. Furthermore, what academic institution is going to change 
their course work quick enough to keep what with the changes as well. 
After reviewing my grandson's high school course work, I can see 
clearly that teachers are not on the bleeding edge. So, in my mind, 
even having a degree is of little value other than providing the 
basics of computer science, which you can get along the way.

We have to live with the fact that there will always be people who 
will hold to the belief that a professional is one who has been 
licensed, but that's a very narrow view. My advice is to ignore them 
and go about your work. After all, your clients will be the ultimate 
judge of your work anyway.

Cheers,

tedd

--Kristina:

I received my last degree in 1984 from Michigan State University.

I used an Apple ][ to type out my thesis. When I submitted it, it was 
a big deal in the submission office because they had never seen an 
original manuscript before. Everything up to that point had been 
type-written pages with white-out mixed with photo copies and such. 
Mine was a simple and clean original type-written manuscript.

When I told them that I had used an Apple ][ word processor to print 
my thesis, they had no clue of what word processing was and had ever 
heard of such a thing.

How things have changed in less than three decades.

Cheers,

tedd

Nope, I think MOST of you are full of sh*t. Unfortunately, such is the bell curve of life ? 7 out of every ten people fall below the curve. Two of the three in the upper half are respectable. And then there?s the one. The one out of every ten who can outperform them all with his or her eyes closed. That one person is the difference maker. That is the person hiring managers will pay for. That is who I struggle day in, day out to find.

 

Critiquing the website accomplishes nothing, both you and I can sit and complain about corporate marketing departments all day long. Although I will certainly forward your comments along to the responsible parties as valuable input. But that?s neither here nor there.

 

Regardless of what is on the website, or how it comes across, the ?real picture? is that I am pushing hard ? with everything I?ve got - to change the face of an industry here, an exciting industry that is full of opportunities to learn and exploit emerging technologies, where the development staff is the crown jewel of the company (http://www.cio.com/article/194600), and where the opportunities to double or triple in size are everywhere. Believe me, it doesn?t get much further away from ?corporate boredom and politics? than this J

 

That said, --rada--, are you the one in ten? Who can come in and change a company, change an industry, with nothing but a computer, creativity, intellectual curiosity, and sheer determination? If so, come in and call me out J

 

Come see for yourself what I am talking about. 

 

I am - graciously - holding out a brass ring here for a true programming talent. All they have to do is take it.

To Jason @ InnovationAds.com

 

Jason, from the tone of your email, you think we developers are full of sh*t. If I understand correctly, you can?t get a decent resume across your desk and you are frustrated and desperate to find people to work in ?perhaps the best environment you?ve seen in NY?. 

 

The real picture seems a little different however.

 

According to your website, you don?t have any technology jobs:

HYPERLINK "http://jobs.innovationads.com/technology"http://jobs.innovationads.com/technology

 

And here is just a sample of a long, long list of empty cliches from your employment page. You?d think this was a draft for an article in The Onion: dynamic company, exponential growth, success based on high quality products and services at a low cost , constantly looking for ways to improve in the ways we deliver services, market leader connecting thousands of consumers with businesses every day, multi-faceted organization , believes in maintaining high standards in everything we do, the better we are the better we serve our clients, dedicated to hiring the best in the industry, workforce geared toward achieving even higher levels of success, strong commitment to diversity, diversity helps us meet and exceed our customers' needs, diversity is vital and necessary to our success in providing quality products and services for our clients, committed to helping the environment by carrying out a set of principals which are aligned with the Company?s mission, etc. etc. etc.

 

Sorry to be so harsh, but do you honestly think the above paints a good picture for prospective candidates? Your website is the first place we are going to look and it just screams corporate boredom and politics. If it were one percent as passionate and human as your post, perhaps you?d have a better success rate.

Tedd --

That's the kind of gizmo that really could have freed up some time for 
me...I remember going through reams of carbon paper and tubs of 
whiteout and making just a huge mess and having to retype things at 3 
AM...things that were already written out in two drafts on legal pads...

Then again I guess the college kids today instead of going to $3 
pitcher nights are all staying in posting profiles on MySpace...??

How computers have changed the world (and the course of our lives!).

    It's a big problem for Generation X and younger people.

    I know a lot of people who are stuck with $100,000+ in college debt but aren't able to get jobs much better than answering the phone at a mutual fund or managing a video store.

    Student loans have created an ecological crisis much like the housing bubble that's currently unwinding.  People were willing to spend more for college from 1980-2008 because financing was available and aggressively marketed.  So the price of college went up.

    Although I think there are some higher values involved in education,  the "market" value of a college education hasn't really increased -- it's certainly a ticket to a certain strata of "top of the low end" jobs in the service sector,  line management in particular,  but it rarely leads up.

    Why?  There's a limited amount of opportunity in the world. People who "blame the victim" and say that people who are stuck should get themselves unstuck and get a better career might be right on an individual basis -- some people certainly can do this -- but if everybody did it,  there wouldn't be anybody to answer the phone at the mutual fund.

    In fact,  I've seen that college and other debt have a destructive effect on people's ambition just as much as welfare.  I'm debt free,  so if I hustle and make an extra $50 or $1000 or $20000,  I can put it in my pocket,  put in the bank,  buy something I like,  roll the money into a new project.  That gives me some motivation.

    I know people who spend half their time at the bankruptcy court and family court...  For them,  any extra $ they make is just going to go to their creditors,  so why bother?

    I know a lot of 20-somethings who need to make a huge payment every month on their student loans...  They're under a lot of pressure to get the first job that's "good enough"...  Taking the risk to find "something better" could land them in default.

A note on this thread in general:
Please keep it clean and the one-line responses to a minimum, or take them
off-list - there's too much traffic for posts that don't have real content.


Hi Kristina, et al,

Wow, what a thread... I remember a similar one years ago, and obviously
these types of issues are still preeminent - regardless of the economy.

I agree Kristina - there is a mismatch between the underlying importance of
IT workers (notably developers, architectures, etc) and their recognition,
reward, and appreciation (yes, cry for us, Argentina).

As many of us probably do, I have an ear on the start-up, entrepreneurial
and "Silicon Alley" crowd as it's often coined.  What's always surprising,
and frankly somewhat amusing, is that through the technology start-up
process - concept development, prototyping, funding, implementation - the
technology people are often secondary, and even trivialized.  Typically the
importance of the technology - and the technical aspects of the project -
are given only grunt recognition, not much beyond that of a ditch digger (no
offense the ditch diggers on the list).  Then, once a company enters a more
mature phase - like revenue - these same companies now struggle to find good
technical talent in order to scale and sustain themselves.

That said, there are consistently good looking jobs out there - just look at
the NYPHP-Jobs list.  Anyone who really wanted a good job, could get one -
the PHP job market is extremely tight - and even in this rocky economy, a
good developer can call their price.  And if you're dealing with one of
those start-ups that was annoying last year, like in any job market,
sometimes you have to swallow your pride.

As a very recent graduate (2006) I'd like to offer some cheese with that whine.

College costs are made very clear prior enrolling. Nobody is twisting
any prospective student's arm, a huge array of choices are available
to every student. Personally. I went to SUNY Binghamton, lived off
campus for two of my four years (to save money and party hard) and had
a part time job while attending. All told, I ended up with 12K in
loans and payments of $97 dollars a month.

Based on my experience, during my senior year of high school, college
enrollment was just like every other shallow choice teenagers make: I
need a name brand school, I need a school with a big football team, I
need a school in the middle of a major urban center. So, I'm sorry if
I offer no remorse for the Special Ed major with 120K in student
loans, who can't make more than 29K a year. He/she should have spent
more time considering the consequences of their school choice rather
than whether or not they liked the school colors.

Nope, I think MOST of you are full of sh*t. Unfortunately, such
is the bell curve of life ? 7 out of every ten people fall below the
curve. Two of the three in the upper half are respectable. And then there?s
the one. The one out of every ten who can outperform them all with his or her
eyes closed. That one person is the difference maker. That is the person hiring
managers will pay for. That is who I struggle day in, day out to find.


     And that's the big problem with the IT industry.  An inability to deliver consistent results.

    It's easier to find a good heart surgeon than a good data modeler in my town.  That's because

(i) there's a system for producing heart surgeons,
(ii) heart surgeons get paid well,
(iii) there's a system for certifying heart surgeons,
(iv) heart surgeons have a social status that people take seriously -- they don't have to waste their time justifying themselves with customers, managers,  and co-workers who don't know jack.

    Akerlof won the 2001 Nobel prize in economics for his analysis of the used car market:  a lot like the IT job market.

    Let's say you're hiring a data modeler...  Odds are 7 out of 10 you'll get the kind of guy who doesn't like the relational paradigm,  is afraid of joins,  and leaves behind filemaker databases with one table and 700 columns.  The market value of all data modelers is discounted by the the fact that you'll probably hire a dud -- on the off chance that get a good one,  he's going to get burned out because the people he works with (particularly the 7 out of 10 duds) are going to assume he's a dud and waste half his time justifying himself.

----

    The other angle here is that I'm not enthusiastic about moving to NYC.  NYC and San Francisco are the only two places on earth that I'd consider moving to,  but that would really wreck my personal life,  ties to my extended family and a lot of things that matter to me.  If I knew I was going to get the perfect situation,  it might be one thing,  but odds are 7 out of 10 it will be another bad scene and who wants to deal with that.

    Overconcentration of economic activities in certain areas is one of the problems of the global economy.  I talk to corporate types in the city,  and they think Bangalore is closer than Binghamton.  We've got cities upstate that have excellent an quality of life and a much lower cost of living than the city -- business trips to the city are an hour on the plane or a few hours on the bus.

    How long are you going to keep repeating the things that don't work before you realize you're going at it the wrong way?

 From just coming off of (and still trying to) hire PHP programmers, I 
have to say that a great many resumes and interviews I've had are with 
people who aren't willing to work on-site; they want to telecommute 
80-90% and work from their apartments in their jammies and slippers.
Best, worst, in-between-est, I can't find someone who wants to work 
full-time.

I'm certainly one of those people, though not in New York.

At the end of the day, I just can't justify spending time on-site very 
often.  I do a lot of work for a boutique development shop, and have a 
desk at the office.  Recently, I've tried to go in at least twice a week 
-- but it gets difficult.  I can do more, better quality, work if I'm in 
a comfortable place with all my toys.  It's only about a 20 minute drive 
to the office, and a pleasant one at that -- but between getting in/out 
of the car and drive time, that's an hour of billable time.  I've often 
fantasized about charging for travel time when someone has demanded 
on-site work when I thought it was not necessary.

Why people insist on on-site work is a bit beyond me.  If you're willing 
to pay well, you should be able to attract capable developers who can be 
trusted to work remotely.  If you want to hire a bunch of juniors to 
churn out hacks all day, and have someone supervise them, then it's 
probably worth it to have them on-site.  But anyone with 5+ years solid 
development experience should be allowed to work how they work best.  
That way, you get the best bang for you buck, IMO.

Because, well, sometimes hard and fast specs aren't available, and 
working face to face with someone allows better communication.
It's as simple and as profound as that.

That may work well, if there are well-defined tasks and little change.

Tim,

I completely agree with you.   Although it does take a lot of self  
discipline to work from home.  A lot of employers want to make sure  
you are getting the work done and not wasting time sitting at home  
doing nothing.

I personally work from home while they fly me into the office every  
month.  I work near Boston and the company is in MD so it's not all  
that far.

I have always worked from home until this point and any of my  
employers would give me a good reference.

What kills it are the people who think working from home means making  
your own hours, doing what you want when you want and not actually  
looking at it as a real job because the boss cannot see their every  
move.

As a single developer there isn't much of a reason.

For a development team - needing to coordinate activities and debate designs on whiteboards - on site presence is required. Unless I were to spend lots of money on collaboration and video environments to facilitate a home-based workplace. 

Personally, I'd rather allocate the money I would need to spend on such a setup back into developer salaries, call me crazy. Not to mention that some of the more socially capable developers actually enjoy getting out of the house :-)

And just to keep the "how behind the times are you" comments at bay, every time I've visited Google in Mountainview, Cisco in San Jose, Citrix in Ft Lauderdale, or Microsoft in Redmond, the offices were packed with staff. Cavemen, huh?

I'm certainly one of those people, though not in New York.

At the end of the day, I just can't justify spending time on-site very 
often.  I do a lot of work for a boutique development shop, and have a 
desk at the office.  Recently, I've tried to go in at least twice a week 
-- but it gets difficult.  I can do more, better quality, work if I'm in 
a comfortable place with all my toys.  It's only about a 20 minute drive 
to the office, and a pleasant one at that -- but between getting in/out 
of the car and drive time, that's an hour of billable time.  I've often 
fantasized about charging for travel time when someone has demanded 
on-site work when I thought it was not necessary.

Why people insist on on-site work is a bit beyond me.  If you're willing 
to pay well, you should be able to attract capable developers who can be 
trusted to work remotely.  If you want to hire a bunch of juniors to 
churn out hacks all day, and have someone supervise them, then it's 
probably worth it to have them on-site.  But anyone with 5+ years solid 
development experience should be allowed to work how they work best.  
That way, you get the best bang for you buck, IMO.

-Tim

Jerry,

with the days of video conferencing i really do not see the point of  
going in-house for anything.  My employer likes to bring me down here  
so i go with the flow.

Well, that's very nice. But not every company *has* video conferencing. 
And sometimes you need more than 15 minutes of conferencing time.

I'm not going to try to convince those of you who are "lone coders" the 
value of a co-located team. I will say that others do NOT feel as you 
do. Strangely enough, sometimes you need more than one person to do the job!

_Peopleware_, my oft-quoted reference, goes to lengths to talk about the 
benefits of "teams" of people working in physical proximity, and the 
positive results coming from that.

I am not saying that telecommuting has its place, only that 
telecommuting is NOT the answer to all problems, and that 
sometimes...you just gotta be there! This is why those folks who 
*demand* 100% telecommuting do not work for me (even if I have one 
special case).

I certainly agree that there are times to get together around a 
table/whiteboard.  But unless you've got some kind of intensive "agile" 
thing going on (and working), 20% of the time in the office should be 
more than enough, most of the time, anyway.

I collaborate regularly with several other developers and it's really 
quite amazing what you can do with email, skype , and/or a conference 
bridge on the PBX.

I do enjoy my office days, like I said, I'm trying to get down there at 
least twice a week for a full day of work. 

As for the money, I don't get it.  The overhead on an internet 
connection is less than having to give your dev an office.  I've got a 
little cube when I'm on-site, and it's not too bad, but there are only 
three others in the room.  But once the talking or fixing little things 
is over and it's time to get back to building something non-trivial, I 
wouldn't be able to do my job without an office with a door that 
closes.  Or I can just stay home, where I have just that.

Most programmers are working for business in industries other than 
software.  If you're doing large-scale application development over a 
range of products involving massive numbers of people, I can see why 
you'd want most everyone on-site.  If you're dealing with less than a 
dozen developers, like 90% of everyone (Yes, I'm pulling that number out 
of the air), telecommuting should be a perfectly manageable and often 
advantageous option.

Jerry,

I agree there are times it would probably be better to be in the  
office, however I am not a lone coder.  I work with a team of 10 other  
developers.  Generally there are 2-3 developers working together on a  
project.  Working from home I still manage to collaborate with them  
just fine.  We use a ticketing system so I know what needs to be done  
when.  If i have questions there is the phone, IM, video etc.

It has been working fine for us so far with me working from home.

I do have to say that not all people can work from home.  It does take  
a lot of discipline to work from home.  There are times I just do not  
want to work and have to force myself to do so.  It is easier to say  
hey i am not working today when you don't have to worry about the boss  
face to face etc.

Hi again,

I spoke with Keyspan and they assured me the USB to Serial device was
working if I could use the Screen tool.

I asked why I was unable to redirect stdin/stdout to and from the /dev/tty.
device and was told there was no reason I shouldn?t be able to do so.

I have tried:

    #echo ?A? > /dev/ tty.USA28Xb2P1.1

The terminal window just hangs.

I have also tried #chat and #efax with no luck...

Has anyone had any luck with serial port communication from any other shell
scripting language on a unix/linux box?

Thanks!

Corey

Well, I can safely say that not a day goes by without an ad hoc design debate springing up, and believe me when I tell you that the folks who are not here for it - well, they miss it. And when we do get home based employees on the phone, we deal with barking dogs, doorbells, screaming children, and lots of chewing. :-) Personally, I like dogs and children, so it makes me smile - but when we have multimillion dollar clients on the phone dealing with a broken app? Not so good.

I am not against working from home, but I believe it works better as the exception, and not the rule, which is the complete opposite of what I'm hearing so far.

Development servers are in house, VPN functionality and speed are no match for the connectivity you get inside the office, most people don't have as well equipped computing infrastructure at home as we do here, they don't have multiline phones and two way speakers, their home pc's crash and it takes them hours if not days to come back to life (whereas in the office we would simply swap in a new pc with a fresh image), and on and on and on...

On the upside, getting used to home based developers is one small step towards getting used to offshoring, which is what we all want at the end of the day anyways, right? ;-) 

Anyone out there who is wondering why offshoring is booming, please read this thread from the beginning.

<audible sigh>

Hello Corey,

Did you try running sudo <command>

Maybe you need root to write to serial...

Hi Cory,

With what device are you trying to communicate?  I log the status and 
usage of my gas furnace with a small photocell wired to a A-D converter 
board which outputs RS232 to a Serial->USB converter then to my "server 
in the closet", which stores all the data to MySQL through a php script. 
The serial to usb converter, I believe, uses the "Prolific" chipset.  I 
also had some trouble speaking directly to the serial port. In the end, 
I gave up and just wrote a C program to grab the data and output to 
stdout. The PHP script captured data continuously with a:

<?php
while (1) {
$data=trim(`./checkfurnace 20 1 1`);
// write to sqldb
sleep(9);
}
?>

I also have a Lacrosse weather station on the roof that sends data 
through a serial cable -> USB converter -> the same server in the 
closet, and it logs data the same way.

Good luck. How are those robots coming along?

Hi Ben,

I would be very interested in talking with you. I am trying to move from a
VB front end to my home built robotics application to something web driven
and running on a Mac. I am just much more familiar with PHP then VB or Java.

What type of robotics app are you working on?

Hi Ben,

Yup, tried sudo. I still get a hang...

How complex would it be for me to implement the Java you are working on... I
cant believe there isn?t a Unix command line serial communication system
that just accepts arguments and spews them across the serial port... Course
I guess it isn?t all that easy. There would have to be a buffer for incoming
as well...

Thank you for your help!

Hey Corey,

The robotics application I'm working on is a SRV1 from trossenrobotics. 
It's a really neat little device.
I actually DONT use the serial stuff now that I have wifi working, I 
know use that to communicate w/the device.

The RXTX link I provided has decent information on using the Java Serial 
Classes.

I didn't write this application, I'm just making alterations to the open 
source console java application for the SRV1.
We could chat off list and I'd be more than happy to offer any help.

Rolan's comments about making a C program is probably your best bet. C 
will be able to do that no problem.

- Ben

I also did some programming for a hardware RFID reader from 
TrossenRobotics as well. Did that in C, which
then calls system("whatever.php") and does the db processing, etc; 
Sometimes you just can't get it done in php... = ]

And that is my point. As mentioned in other emails, the BSEE program I 
randomly picked as it was one of the top results from Google asked for a 
total 
of 132 credits and from those 60 credits that were basically labeled as 
non-major courses, so that is about half of all course work required. I know 
that this differs from school to school, but as mentioned I attended a 
university that asked for 150 credits on-major course work, yet I got the 
same 
BSEE degree. But am I that wrong in thinking that I got a better engineering 
education?
Engineering degrees in the US have a very broad range -- although, again, 
this may have changed, my knowledge is pretty old.  At Hopkins when I went there, 
it was pretty theoretical, if you wanted lab work you'd look around and get 
in on projects with professors, maybe get independent studies credits.  But at 
places like Drexel or Georgia Tech, it might be much more hands-on engineering 
work in the classes -- I think Drexel had mandated apprenticeship programs, 
you had to do a year with a company.
 
Maybe in Germany degree accreditation is more regulated or standardized.  
Here in the States, it's not just the degree but where you got it that matters.  
Actually a knowledgable recruiter should check out the transcript thoroughly 
as well.
 


In the MS program things were mainly on-topic, but for a good part on such a 
basic level that I wondered if I registered for the right course. I epxected 
it to be intelectually challanging, not just a lot of work. One course was 
about e-business, the book was of horrible quality and the course wasn't much 
better. The recurring task was to read 50 pages and then write a ten page 
paper about it. And that week after week. We did have to do a project as well 
and I did a PHP script that took entries from an HTML form and writes them to 
a file. The script and pages were for submitting support tickets for 
software. 
I never created an HTML page before nor did I have any good relation with 
programming. I came to the conclusion that programming hates me and that I 
hate programming, which is why I chose to do a programming project. That was 
the only tough task in that course and only because I chose to make it 
difficult.
My impression was that the department wanted to make the courses easy and 
fluffy on purpose so that many students pass and graduate, which boosts the 
numbers on paper and makes the university look good.

One other thing I find silly is the constant hand holding at US universities 
with advisors and mandatory meetings. I found that to be disturbing that the 
school considers me to be that limited in my capabilities to sign up for the 
mandatory courses and pick from those that are in the "Other" bucket. Once 
done I register for the thesis and at that point someone checks if I passed 
all the required course work. I found that having an advisor assigned to me 
was make work for both me and her.
So did you end up designing your major or did you have to sit down with 
someone for hours debating why this course is better than that course?
I think I had to talk to my advisor twice, once when I wanted to take 23 
credits one semester (the standard was 15) and then when I wanted to take a course 
that I didn't have the prerequisites for.  Both happened freshman year -- I 
never even saw him again after that.

Oh yeah -- I'm sure a lot of independents comtemplate that, that being 
independent may deprive one of a large infrastructure, more money, big complex 
projects, that independents may not get access to.
 
My comment was that perhaps it's sort of genetic -- that maybe the 
personality that drives one to be independent may be correlated with the skill set you 
seek.
 
It's an unproved generalization of course.

Gee, as a QA specialist / lead I get not even the 80k. So why should a 
developer get that much money? Developers make software so that QA can test 
it. For that QA should get paid more than developers. And even more, support 
covers the butts of QA which covered the butts of the developers and yet 
support gets paid crap compared to even a QA guy. I think developers are 
already overvalued, but the same applies to doctors (although depends, the 
PCP 
that gets called in the middle of the night deserves good pay) and lawyers. I 
also think that the front desk person deserves the highest pay, same applies 
to administrative assistance. While the big wigs play golf these fine people 
keep a business running. I know that from first hand experience. I worked at 
a 
place where among others the receptionist got laid off. After a week all hell 
broke loose. No office supplies, the water company did not get paid (neither 
did the electric and gas companies, or anyone else), customers left hundreds 
of messages and ran over to the competition because nobody bothered to 
reroute 
the phone lines or shut off the email accounts. And I am sure that everything 
will work fine if all the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies get laid off. And 
some companies do that. When I started working at Henkel in Germany for the 
first time they had 27 layers of management. When I worked there the last 
time 
they were down to less than a dozen. Stuff got done the same as before, but 
without spending millions on chair farters.

But no matter who you ask, that person always makes not enough money. Ask 
A-Rod and I am sure that he would love to get paid even more. They are all 
whiners, just look at that multi-billionaire who lost big in that Bear 
Stearns 
deal. OK, he lost about a billion bucks, but he still has 4 billion left! 
Even 
he is whining and feels cheated.

Honestly, I would be the happiest person on earth if I could make anything 
close to 80k. I think that is plenty awesome money for a 9ish to 5ish job. 
I'd 
be happy with even 70k. Not to say that I am grossly underpaid at the moment. 
Pay is OK, feeds the family and secures a home and then a bit is even left. 
But with even more money, I guess we'd just spend it all and then what, 
complain again it is not enough. We are quite spoiled, there are many who 
have 
to get by on 30k and no benefits. How can one work full time and not even 
have 
decent health insurance? Now those are the folks that have a right to 
complain!

Ain't that the truth!

The product here is net-ware -- it's 100% digital and 100% accessible 
by the world. Why anyone would want their product to be created at 
some physical place is beyond me.

Perhaps it's the suit types who think that if they don't have an 
employee under their thumb, the employee would goof-off like they 
would if they had the chance -- I don't know. But typically, us geek 
types like doing what we do and if left alone, we do it pretty well. 
This stuff is both my livelihood and my passion. If I'm not being 
paid for it -- I do it anyway (except for myself).

I've worked for myself for decades. Sure, I've been offered numerous 
positions and have even considered a few, but two things happen 
during the interview: 1) They want me to work on their windoze 
machines, which I refuse to do -- I have my own system, a Mac, thank 
you; 2) Once they find out I'm disabled, things change. Sure, one can 
carry on about the ADA, but that's a bunch of nonsense that just 
keeps government types employed. All business has to say is "I'm 
sorry, but you wouldn't pass our health screening. And please don't 
let the door hit your ass on the way out." But, that's topic for 
another day.

The point being, our product is digital and as such should be allowed 
to be created anywhere.

Cheers,

tedd

         You may be comparing apples and oranges. Some schools use 
quarter semesters
which are 12 week semesters. The most common are 16 week semesters. So 150
quarter hours would be equivalent to 112 semester hours.

         You mentioned Drexal, I believe they use quarter hours.

It may allow quicker communication, but that can be handled by telephone.

What I don't like about quicker communication is there is no record 
of what was said -- but that's not a problem in email.

You want me to work for you, simply tell me what you want. That 
communication not only defines the project, but get the client to 
think it terms of what's important to them.

My mileage does vary. I have worked on numerous projects that have 
moving parts -- in fact, they all do. But written communication 
better defines what the needs are -- and -- they come with a time 
stamp.

The net is a different critter for product development and distribution.

Yeah, the IT culture is a lot different, and I guess business culture is 
still trying to fit IT into their standard model.
 
It's too bad in a way -- the beauty of not working in a 9-5 workplace is that 
independents are often available for a lot more hours.  I'm basically 
available from 9am to about 11pm most days.  I don't waste time commuting.  I do 
conference calls, Glance sessions etc.  If I have to do something that could 
affect operations, I can do it after hours, and it doesn't seem like a burden to me.
 
In a way, I don't get the on-site thing even for big companies.  I was doing 
some work for a very large company a few months back, and we were doing 
conference calls with the manager in NYC, IT in Oklahoma, and a vendor in Boston.
 
Part of it is logic too, for a developer.  It seems much more efficient to 
create your own work environment rather than sitting in a noisy bunch of 
cubicles.  It's all the same work -- let's talk on the phone or even go on-site for 
specs and requirements, and then let me go off and do the work.
 
Well, it's almost 11am -- time to get a shower.  ;)

Ain't that the truth!

The product here is net-ware -- it's 100% digital and 100% accessible 
by the world. Why anyone would want their product to be created at 
some physical place is beyond me.

Perhaps it's the suit types who think that if they don't have an 
employee under their thumb, the employee would goof-off like they 
would if they had the chance -- I don't know. But typically, us geek 
types like doing what we do and if left alone, we do it pretty well. 
This stuff is both my livelihood and my passion. If I'm not being 
paid for it -- I do it anyway (except for myself).

I've worked for myself for decades. Sure, I've been offered numerous 
positions and have even considered a few, but two things happen 
during the interview: 1) They want me to work on their windoze 
machines, which I refuse to do -- I have my own system, a Mac, thank 
you; 2) Once they find out I'm disabled, things change. Sure, one can 
carry on about the ADA, but that's a bunch of nonsense that just 
keeps government types employed. All business has to say is "I'm 
sorry, but you wouldn't pass our health screening. And please don't 
let the door hit your ass on the way out." But, that's topic for 
another day.

The point being, our product is digital and as such should be allowed 
to be created anywhere.

Cheers,

tedd

The digital nature of the work is changing the work ethic.

For the exception of discussions like this, I work. I spend 10-14 
hours a day writing code. My clients never have to wait for anything. 
My work is done on time and per the cost agreed beforehand. My repeat 
business keeps me busy enough that I don't have to look for any 
additional work. In fact, I often turn work away.

For me, it's not a question of "Why won't employers hire me to work 
at home?" but rather I have enough work that I don't understand why 
more businesses don't hire digital employees? From my perspective, 
it's a win-win for all.

Cheers,

tedd

-------------------

    Personally I like going to a some place to work.  When I'm working at home I never know when my work life end and personal life starts.  I like having co-workers.  It's REALLY rough working at home if you're the parent of a young child,  like me.

    For the last few years I've teleworked maybe one day a month,  except for a very little bit of moonlighting.

    The quality of telework can vary a lot.  I know people who've been great teleworkers,  and some who've been a disaster.  I knew one guy who was working on two projects who teleworked for a month,  was very evasive,  and didn't check in a thing into version control in a month of working on my project...  told me he was busy with the other project...  for all I know he told the other guys he was busy on my project.

    I've had very productive days teleworking,  but I often end up doing it when there's a child care glitch,  which means I end up playing a lot of Mario 64, building domino tracks and exploring the creeks on our land.

    I think you see a lot of teleworkers begging for work since they have a harder time getting it and so they have to send out more resumes -- the # of resumes isn't necessarily representative of what fraction of the workforce wants to do.

==========

    I think people in the city have a particular problem of provincialism.  There are a lot of people who'd like to benefit from the economic dynamism of the city who don't want to live there,  or in it's immediate suburbs.  There are things about living in NYC that are unique and wonderful,  but it's not the lifestyle that most Americans want.

    I think of the "New Yorker" cartoon that shows the distorted picture of the world that people in New York have -- upstate New York just isn't in the NYC mental map.  I think New York companies could benefit by establishing satellite offices in upstate cities where the cost of doing business is a fraction of what it is in the city.  They could benefit by forming relationships with contractors within a 300-mile radius,  but it's not an easy sell.

I agree with you about the WWD article, Jason, and I'm actually not a
CIO or upper management.

I telecommuted for a company out of state for a year, and then quit
because I could see that it simply wasn't going to work out. I agree
that you need some face-to-face time to iron out specs.

However, on the other hand, I find it highly unnecessary to be on-site
100% of the time. Do you think that there is some sort of a compromise
in this area, or do you see it black & white: you're on or you're off?

I'm just curious about what you think on this.

As a side note, I've been flying solo since Jan. '07, and I find that
most of my clients chose me because I *can* work on-site here in NYC.
I don't do this 100% of the time, but I find that some face-time is
absolutely necessary for most business people. As a business person
myself, I completely understand that. You want to see where your money
is going.

Good question :-)

I actually have one full time - and very valuable - employee working completely from home, in FL nonetheless. I have a graphic designer working full time from Croatia. Both are important to the company, neither is part of a team.

For the dev group - which is where my heart lies - they are all here with me every day.

Now, if one gets sick, or as mentioned ealier has a child care issue, or a broken car, or simply can't bear the thought of commuting on a given day, I am totally fine with them working from home.

Like I said in a previous post, the exception, not the rule

I agree with you about the WWD article, Jason, and I'm actually not a
CIO or upper management.

I telecommuted for a company out of state for a year, and then quit
because I could see that it simply wasn't going to work out. I agree
that you need some face-to-face time to iron out specs.

However, on the other hand, I find it highly unnecessary to be on-site
100% of the time. Do you think that there is some sort of a compromise
in this area, or do you see it black & white: you're on or you're off?

I'm just curious about what you think on this.

As a side note, I've been flying solo since Jan. '07, and I find that
most of my clients chose me because I *can* work on-site here in NYC.
I don't do this 100% of the time, but I find that some face-time is
absolutely necessary for most business people. As a business person
myself, I completely understand that. You want to see where your money
is going.

I think there shouldn't be a general rule -- or maybe it's correlated with 
the size of the system and the level of specialization desired.  I assume a lot 
of independents are catering to small and medium-sized businesses.
 
Maybe it's apples and oranges.  It's actually kind of nice that the various 
options are available, to accommodate the broad range of personalities that 
exist.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [OT?] inconsistent html email display
Message-ID: <721f1cc50804180856j4f61483fp56a17af7197ba170@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everybody

My script builds and sends and HTML email using Zend_Mail. The resulting
email shows up fine in some email clients but not others. On gmail and
Thunderbird it's fine. On Yahoo! email it doesn't (for some browsers,
apparently). The body contains a bi-columnar HTML table, as in label =>
value. In some clients (some), the labels are there, but the values appear
empty. When you examine the source, however, the values are right there!
They are just not displaying. I have run the output through validator.w3.org,
and it is valid xhtml transitional.

I had a user complain that the data column was empty on Yahoo! with IE 7.
She forwards the offending message to my own Yahoo, and it displays (in
Firefox 2).

It is the weirdest damn thing I have encountered in a while. I can't figure
out what I am doing wrong -- if anything. Any ideas?

PS Curse not just IT, but all things technological.  Let's all go off the
grid and subsistence-farm and hunt and gather for a living.

Some can; some cannot. When you have a captive audience in front of you, 
you often get a higher percentage of attention than you do when the 
other party could be IMing a second person and/or composing an email to 
a third.

That's right...if you are lucky enough to have projects that work in 
that fashion. Not everyone works in email. Not all clients WANT to.

I wonder if Yahoo! is sending different stylesheets to IE and Firefox.
I know I do.

Are you using class attributes for styling? Could Y!s styles be
cascading into your html content? Weird.

But the credits should end up to be the same. So instead of getting 3 creadits 
for a 16 week course you get only 2 credits for a 12 week course.

And I didn't mention Drexel, that was someone else, but in that regards, it 
also matters in Germany where you go. Places like Aachen or Karlsruhe have a 
much higher regard and much tougher programs although universities generally 
cover the same topics, but each offer some specialisations (I specialised in 
optical communications). The place I went to was close to where I lived and 
offered a program that was not impossible for me to complete. Yet it was 
probably not even among the top 100 engineering schools in Germany. Still, 
everyone I graduated with got an engineering job within a few months.
That said, going to CCSU and getting straight As in everything with not much 
effort doesn't really make me believe that getting an MS degree here is as 
difficult as it is to get the equivalent degree in Germany. In fact, German 
universities give BS degrees to those who drop out of MS programs. But they 
figured that this does quite a disservice for those who hold a BS and now 
offer a BS degree after 3 years and when adding on another year you get the MS.
CCSU is the place where Pratt&Whitney sends their people to get degrees. P&W 
has a nice tuition program, not only do they pay for school, but they also pay 
their employees for several hours a week for studying as well as give a 10k 
bonus when one graduates.
I got "paid" to go to school in Germany. I got federal financial aid, half was 
a gift from the taxpayers and the other half was an interest free loan. The 
loan is due two years after graduation. I paid the sum off in one go and got a 
28% reduction for that. Now THAT is financial aid, not this crap that they 
offer here so that the universities can have bloated amounts of staff, huge 
football stadiums, and a campus that rivals the fine parks of the kings of the 
world. Oh, and for the longest time there was no tuition in Germany, just a 
semester fee that paid for the day care center and for the half year rail&bus 
pass. They now charge about 300 Euro a semester, but compared to a US school 
that is still a bargain. Luckily I didn't pay for the tuition, IR did. I just 
think that a 1,000$ plus fee per class should result into some more 
challenging education.

Again the disclaimer, this is all based on my epxerience and what I read and 
what I heard others state to me. I don't know what Drexel or GA Tech or MIT or 
CIT do in class and in the labs and how their programs really are. It's just a 
bit time and cost prohibitive for me to find out for myself, although I wish I 
could.

Which is why stuff gets sent to India, China, or now Russia. Or in my case

Whoa dude -- you must not be married. You never mention any woman's 
name with a "fat" inference.

You'll never win any argument that even remotely starts there. :-)

I don't get the credits argument -- I think Urb was saying that Drexel counts 
their hours in a totally different way (btw, I'm the one who mentioned 
Drexel).  As far as I know, there is no federal mandate to count hours in a certain 
way -- in other words, standardization is not mandated.
 
You're not going to get a lot of argument about the insane upward spiral of 
college costs from most Americans, along with the declining system of financial 
aid.
 
And the cost of the college may not be correlated with the quality of the 
school.

But the credits should end up to be the same. So instead of getting 3 
creadits 
for a 16 week course you get only 2 credits for a 12 week course.

And I didn't mention Drexel, that was someone else, but in that regards, it 
also matters in Germany where you go. Places like Aachen or Karlsruhe have a 
much higher regard and much tougher programs although universities generally 
cover the same topics, but each offer some specialisations (I specialised in 
optical communications). The place I went to was close to where I lived and 
offered a program that was not impossible for me to complete. Yet it was 
probably not even among the top 100 engineering schools in Germany. Still, 
everyone I graduated with got an engineering job within a few months.
That said, going to CCSU and getting straight As in everything with not much 
effort doesn't really make me believe that getting an MS degree here is as 
difficult as it is to get the equivalent degree in Germany. In fact, German 
universities give BS degrees to those who drop out of MS programs. But they 
figured that this does quite a disservice for those who hold a BS and now 
offer a BS degree after 3 years and when adding on another year you get the 
MS.
CCSU is the place where Pratt&Whitney sends their people to get degrees. P&W 
has a nice tuition program, not only do they pay for school, but they also 
pay 
their employees for several hours a week for studying as well as give a 10k 
bonus when one graduates.
I got "paid" to go to school in Germany. I got federal financial aid, half 
was 
a gift from the taxpayers and the other half was an interest free loan. The 
loan is due two years after graduation. I paid the sum off in one go and got 
a 
28% reduction for that. Now THAT is financial aid, not this crap that they 
offer here so that the universities can have bloated amounts of staff, huge 
football stadiums, and a campus that rivals the fine parks of the kings of 
the 
world. Oh, and for the longest time there was no tuition in Germany, just a 
semester fee that paid for the day care center and for the half year rail&bus 
pass. They now charge about 300 Euro a semester, but compared to a US school 
that is still a bargain. Luckily I didn't pay for the tuition, IR did. I just 
think that a 1,000$ plus fee per class should result into some more 
challenging education.

Again the disclaimer, this is all based on my epxerience and what I read and 
what I heard others state to me. I don't know what Drexel or GA Tech or MIT 
or 
CIT do in class and in the labs and how their programs really are. It's just 
a 
bit time and cost prohibitive for me to find out for myself, although I wish 
I 
could.

Maybe IT people are devalued because when the bosses aren't looking,
we're jacking around online on mailing lists?

Food for thought... I'm one of the mods in the DCPHP community and I
often get pinged by people looking to hire, make an entrance in the
community, or just make their presence known for future recruiting.
Who do you think I send them to?    The people who provide value,
insight, and thoughtful questions or the people who make a nuisance of
themselves?

Your reputation has a direct impact on your billing rate and the
opportunities that appear to you.

No, not giving any names... I highlight the good people, not tear down
the bad ones.  They do that on their own. ;)

Yes, it is.  All kinds of evilness could happen with an unvalidated
external stylesheet.  Hell, IE allows javascript in a stylesheet.  You
need to include the stylesheet in the html.

I would also say, that many "professions" require practical experience in 
the field. Doctors have internships. Architects have to work for a firm 
for a certain length of time, etc etc. That looks like on-the-job training 
to me. Certainly a programmer that has a degree and has several years of 
paid experience ought to be considered a professional of some kind.

Sorry to enter the conversation so late (had a minor outgoing email 
issue with the list)...

After 8 years of working from this desk in the windowed corner of my 
Brooklyn apartment, I couldn't disagree more with a lot of the sentiment 
in this thread.  Like tedd, I never have to look for or ask for steady 
and high paying work (rating a minimum of 100 hourly at rare occasion).  
I usually have 2 - 3 medium to large projects going at any given time, 
during which I have to turn down a couple others due to time constraints 
or disinterest.  Some of my clients have been with me for months and 
others for years and they keep coming back.  Best part being that I've 
never met the majority of them in person - some of them I've never even 
spoken to over the phone.

Don't get me wrong, I love to talk to my clients and whenever any happen 
to be in town (or I'm where they are), I make sure to buy them dinner or 
a drink or whatever their pleasure.  But when it comes to work, it's 
hard to find anything more reliable than email (or Maybe basecamp).  The 
secret is to over-communicate.  Make sure that you get your point across 
in a friendly and professional matter with more information than the 
client could possibly hope for (about the work, not the wardrobe), 
taking no chances that they'll "just get it".  It allows the client to 
feel free about opening up as well and provides a means of un-awkward 
communication with a "paper" trail.  If you find that the communication 
between you and your client is lacking, blame yourself.  As the 
professional, it's your fault.  Specs are always short-sighted on the 
first round, and only get better by hand-holding and lullabies and 
meeting face-to-face doesn't necessarily make that better - many times 
it makes it worse as you'll "feel" like they get what you're saying 
because they're nodding their heads trying not to look dumb.

As for the odd idea that the availability of work is diminishing - you 
couldn't be further from earth.  There is Plenty of work to go around 
for web programmers.     Especially if you care about your craft.  Our 
industry is Incredibly young.  There are TENS of THOUSANDS of businesses 
who have a sub-par web presence built a decade ago and most of them 
could benefit from an application that would help them run more 
efficiently right into the current century.  If you're pretty good at 
what you do with the ability to communicate with other human beings, you 
should be able to get paid whatever you need to get paid to live in 
comfort.  And if you can't communicate, find someone who can and give 
them a cut.

If you're not finding it here, there's plenty elsewhere. There are TONS 
of the smaller well-known design firms based in California.  They all 
need developers to implement their grandiose designs.  They have fortune 
500 clients.  They pay on time, happily.  They have little issue with 
working with someone from afar.  New York... well, I love the city and 
hence I live in Brooklyn, but I've very few New York clients - and 
that's not to say I don't have plenty offers for freelance work and 
employment here.  I'll just say that my clients elsewhere have generally 
been easier to work with - especially around pay day.

As for large projects.  While I agree that you won't easily find a big 
gig when solo - it is very possible.  Every large gig I get usually 
involves being invited to a team put together by one of my clients.  So, 
sure big gigs can be difficult, but they are absolutely possible if the 
right people know you're good at what you do.

And for the IT industry...  I left a high paying job as an IT manager on 
Wall Street long ago to program full time and I've slept much better since.

Except for four years, I've been telecommuting since 1989.  Most of my 
jobs have been on the large side: 1+ years.  Usually, I work solo but 
I've been on teams as large as 15 developers scattered around the country.

A few of those gigs, like Operative and answerThink, started as 
fulltime/on-site but when the boss saw how much I was getting done on 
weekends and evenings at home, he or she told me not to come in except 
for meetings.  If nothing else, for them it meant an two extra 12 hours 
of work out of me every week that I was otherwise wasting on an MTA commute.

Successful telecommuting involves two things that an IT department 
should already have but too often doesn't: motivated tech workers with 
good initiative and communications skills and tech management that knows 
how to manage a software project, not just butts in chairs.

Hi David,

I'll second what John said--yes, external stylesheets are evil and will 
give you nothing but grief in HTML emails.

CSS support in HTML email is highly unpredictable & buggy--much more so 
than in browsers, and it's only gotten worse with the advent of Outlook 
2007.

The best resource I know of is at:
http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/04/a_guide_to_css_support_in_emai_2.html

It contains an accurate, up-to-date, exhaustive list of CSS support in 
all major email clients (PC & Mac), as well as the webmail-based stuff 
like GMail, Windows Live Mail, etc.

         Good question. I think you are an exceptional person :-) Let me make
something perfectly clear. I'm a big proponent of non-traditional learning,
I didn't enter a college classroom until I was 44 years old. My under-
graduate degree is from Thomas Edison State College which is totally
a non-traditional educational institution.

         Unfortunately, that's true of most people through no fault of their
own. When I was teaching at the college level I was one of 13 full-time
computer faculty member. I was the only one who had ever earned a
nickle in the field. "Real World" experience makes a difference.

         I have hired programmers with no formal training and I know
people with a Ph.D. in computer science that I would not hire under
any conditions.

         Aren't you suggesting that a professional require formal training
as well as on-the-job training?

         Let my turn it around a bit. Would you go to a doctor who was
completely self taught? I once ask a fellow faculty member, "what is
the difference between a Public Accountant and a Certified Public
Accountant?" His answer, "about 50K per year."

>  Certainly a programmer that has a degree and has several years of

         It's really semantics. You are free to define "professional" any
way you like. Ask some non-computer friends how they would define
professional.

         Let me make a practical point. 10 years after the Financial Analysts
Federation announced there Certified Financial Analysts (CFA) designation
those so certified was making 56% more than their cohorts not 
certified.

         Someone ask a question, do we want the government determining
what qualifications we should have to get a programming job? Of course
not. However, shouldn't we have a national organization who, among
other things, establishes credential standards? The real problem would be
to get a group of practitioners to agree on the criterion for accreditation.

Urb:

You started this thread by saying that programming and web design was 
not a profession. Then you gave licensing as your main reason why.

The term "professional" in our language extends beyond the limitation 
imposed by licensing. For example, while it is true there is no 
licensing for athletes if an athlete earns money from his/her 
ability, then they can't compete in the Olympics because they are 
considered to be a "professional" athlete.

Then of course there's the "oldest profession", which there has never 
been any licensing for except for an occasional health screening in 
some areas -- and I am certain that profession started long before 
licensing.

Now you say that truck drivers are not professional. But they are 
required to licensed and it does require training. If you don't think 
driving an 18 wheeler required specialized knowledge, then try 
driving one. Oh I forgot, you wouldn't be allowed because you don't 
have the license nor the experience to do so.

Your view on profession is limited and shortsighted. Now with the 
global scope of Internet programming and communication technology 
changing as fast as it is, there could never be any licensing 
authority to set in judgement of this profession -- let alone to be 
sanctioned by the global community. The point being that the term 
"profession" has outgrown its definition.

As far as being an elitist or pragmatist, I really don't think your 
words reflect a pragmatistic view.

Cheers,

tedd

Does he have a degree? Or does he have a tonof experience? Either will do.

Ditto.

Some exerience you only learn on the job but that's doesn't make it less 
valuable.

Which doesn't really mean anything in technology - even if you had some 
kind of certification it will quickly become less and less relevant. Would 
you hire someone that was certified over 10 years ago or someone with a 
lot of experience who isn't certfied?

The problem is technology changes faster than pretty much any other 
business. This is why when some of these certifications started appearing 
(like the Microsoft ones), they had to put a system in place where after a 
certain amount of time (or releases) you had to be "re-certified". My 
conclusion at the time is that certification *may* show some basic 
competency for a very narrow range of technology but ultimately is of 
little value. Probably why Ive never been certified in anything.

I should also mention that in the UK (I live here but I grew up the UK) 
the British Computer Society has a membership criteria that includes a 
degree but also requires a certain amount of job experience to qualify.

You mean ask people to apply criteria in their field to another field 
which they don't understand and which they assume doesn't change very 
much? Yeah, that'll work :-)

Again, that just means they've drank the Cool Aid WRT certifications. You 
can't look at technology the same way.

That's very much a US thng. In the UK you're studying your chosen major 
from day one. In certain other European countries the degrees also include 
some job experience (its optional in the UK).

Totally agree. Maybe the fact that you and I were NOT educated in the US 
gives us a different view on higher education.

This sort of implies that someone that is highly specialised cannot relate 
to people in other dsciplines. I dont think that is true (Im sure you 
could find some prime examples but they are probably exceptions). I 
clearly dont need a class in English to write these emails with correct 
capitalization and punctuation (or spelling!).

The attitude outside the US is that that is something you do in your own 
time. (In the UK, you might get a day or half day off per week to pursue 
your own intrests outside of your academic study). In any case, you would 
learn some of those skills in your work experience too.

My hand is not raised. Connections might count in certain businesses but

I think that says more about the lack of technical knowledge of suits more 
than anything else. I think technical people should be managed by 
technical people. I think people wanting to manage technical companies 
should learn about the technology rather than generic management. This, to 
me, is the real problem.

I'm sure most of you already know this but essentially, in times past 
in the United States (and I have to assume hundreds of years ago in 
Europe, as well, although that apparently has changed), the 
undergraduate university degree was seen as a "gentleman's education", 
teaching a liberal arts curriculum that essentially prepared you for no 
useful trade and was sharply contrasted by any "utilitarian" 
or "vocational" education, which taught a trade or skill specifically 
for the purpose of earning money by working (which young gentlemen 
attending university back then usually did not do, but moreso sat 
around on their rear ends reading arcane texts in the original Latin, 
drinking heavily and perhaps going into politics...some things have not 
changed!).

Certain occupations such as the law, the clergy and banking were 
thought to be suitable for gentlemen and any "career related education" 
was to take place on the graduate level.

And vestiges of this system clearly survive to this day even though we 
now have a much higher percentage of students continuing to the college 
level, and many of them with expectations that "going to college" will 
teach them "what they need to know to get a good job".  That isn't the 
function of the university, the function of the university is to 
provide a broad based liberal arts education.  That's why even a B.Sc. 
student in an engineering discipline is expected to take 80 or 85 
credits of miscellaneous "useless" liberal arts or general courses at 
US universities.

Therefore you can see that the reasoning behind this curriculum is NOT 
that US university students are "not ready for higher education" after 
high school or that "university is a continuation of HS" in the US [to 
paraphrase from below]...it's that we here in the US have always had a 
particular notion that liberal arts WAS a university education, and 
that "vocational" or "skills" training was not something that any 
respectable person had to worry about until AFTER 4 years at university.

Vocational training is all well and good and yes, does make 
attractive "workers", but will not replace a solid well rounded 
university education.

Not quite right - I think there's a gap in your knowledge here about 
foreign workers. Since I came to the US on an H1B visa I probably have a 
better understanding.

Technical workers will most likely be on an H1B visa and so the following 
apply:

1) You cannot transfer the visa to another company. You need to get a new 
visa. Since 9/11 this has been made much much harder (I'd say practically 
impossible). So if you're offered a management positiion in another 
company you couldn't take it anyway.

2) An H1B visa is limited to 6 years tops (initially its 3 years but if 
you're lucky you can extend it to 6 years). So a tech workers won't be 
around long enough to move up.

These two facts most likely limit how far foreign tech workers can 
advance.

Do I assume right you refer to the Studium Generale (no, not General Studies, 
which I think is a joke that one can get a degree for that)? Yes, that was the 
typical type of study in european universities for centuries. It wasn't meant

That has changed drastically and is one reason more why programs specialized 
into various branches and need to specialize even more. Even the vocational 
training changed a lot over the past 100 years in Germany, my grandfather went 
to a business to learn by doing, I too went to a business, but also spent 
considerable amount of time in specialized schools to learn the theory.

Yes, but this is how things were done in the past and it may have worked then. 
I think US universities with a few exceptions don't generate the talent that 
the industry needs today, neither in quality nor numbers. I clearly see the 13 
years K-12 as the place for a broad education that satisfies the needs for a 
liberal arts education.

OK, but that is exactly why especially in the IT field a lot of work goes 
overseas or talent from overseas gets brought here. Just read the complaints 
from the C level managers in the various technical magazines, unless they 
happen to have a university that is willing to cooperate with companies in 
order to produce graduates with the skills and knowledge needed.
I think that after 4 years of university an engineering graduate is supposed 
to be capable of performing engineering tasks and not need yet another 4 years 
hands on training before he or she is starting to be useful. Who would you 
hire? A 4 year grad that spent 4 years or one that spent only 2 years on the 
subject?
As mentioned before, the liberal arts education is better placed in elementary 
and high schools and I think 13 years ought to be enough to learn and master 
what is needed. If someone decides that more training in writing or reading or 
math is needed, fine, take an extra course or two. I'm not saying that those 
courses are useless or a waste of time, I just think that they ought to be 
considered extra and not be part of a degree program. Ajai described it nicely 
in his replies and he may just be right that the perspective that we have of 
knowing both systems allows us to see the difference.

That is because also the vocational training here in the US generally sucks. I 
spent three and a half years as radio- and TV technician apprentice. I worked 
in a business and also spent considerable amounts of times in specialiced 
schools. We not only learned the theory, math and science needed, but also 
business economics, occupational safety and additional hands-on work. We 
learned how to make circuit boards, how to drill them, how to bend, cut, and 
drill metals and other materials. While working in the business I did not just 
sit in the shop fixing TVs and VCRs, but also sold devices, went out to 
customers, and installed cable TV and satellite dishes. That means I also had 
to learn how to open and close roofs and install electric outlets following 
code. I even got the same basic training as an electrician. I don't know how 
it is in NY, but in CT you don't need any of that in order to even open a TV 
repair business. I germany you need a craftsmen's masters degree for that, 
which means more schooling and tests. And that is the norm at least for the 
past 60 years. I prefer that, especially when it is for example for a car 
mechanic. I want someone with proper training to fix my breaks and not just 
some schmuck off the street who knows what a wrench is good for. I know that 
the shops here in NYS need a special license, but I do not know what that 
includes. I know from other states that the "licensing" includes paying a fee 
and nothing else.

See, the US has excellent universities like MIT, CIT, Harvard, Yale, but can 
these universities produce enough graduates to satisfy the needs of the US 
industry? Definitely not, so all the other universities need to fill the void 
and when you look at the rankings of the other US universities in 
international comparison others tend to be better or as good. I did look at 
the various international rankings. Universities in non-english speaking 
countries tend to show up around the 30th place and below. Excellent 
universities like IIT were even absent on the lists I've seen. I did see 
Leiden and Barcelona in some, but so far at the bottom that I wonder if 
language and location played a role. There seems to be no fully independent 
organisation that compares universities.

There is also other points, some technical workers don't want to advance into 
managerial positions or regret that they did. My boss at IR wanted to be a 
technical manager, what happened is that he spend his entire time on emails, 
meetings, and PowerPoint presentations. What a waste of a brilliant firmware 
engineer.
I wouldn't want to be a manager running a department, but would like to be a 
project lead for a limited time. I also think it depends a lot on the company. 
Some companies have a much flatter management structure and focus on one 
industry. The problem at IR was that we were a software development team in a 
company that usually relates only to hunks of steel or 'real' product that can 
be stuffed in a box. We made software that was mainly downloaded off a web 
site. Upper management couldn't take it apart or stuff into a box, for them it 
was either uninteresting or they didn't even know it existed. I now work at 
Tyler Technologies and as the name says, it is a tech company. What a 
difference that makes. I think it is misleading to measure technical skill and 
knowledge by counting the number of promotions. And that applies to both 
foreign and domestic workers.
Also, foreign workers regardless of visa status cannot work in quite a few 
companies. As soon as government contracts are involved chances go way down. 
Even so much, that one gets excluded from study projects. When I was at CCSU I 
attended a course about production management. Part of the course was to 
manage a project at a local company. They make parts of jet engines that are 
used in commercial and military planes. From the 24 students 8 were 
non-US-citizens. Not only were we not allowed to take part in the project, we 
were even thrown out of class when a production manager talked about what the 
company does. I complained about that to the instructor, my wife who is an 
alumni of the same university wrote a nasty letter to the university 
president. The responses were prompt with written letter of regrets and the 
plea to keep the press out of this. It was not easy to go back to class the 
week after. The project work was canceled, which was unfortunate, but the 
instructor adjusted his plan very well and it was in the end the best and most 
challenging class I had, in fact it was the only class I considered worthy of 
a masters program.

Yes, that is what I was referring to and you are right, the educational 
system has to change over time to meet society's needs...but right now 
in the US we have this particular system still in place.

Other comments:

Admittedly I'm not a "typical person" in the IT field -- I have a 
liberal arts education, and almost 10 years in another field before 
deciding to make the change to IT (programming) in my early/mid 30s.  
I'm now in my mid 40s (45 in August) and have been getting paid to 
write code for 10 years.  It was a steep learning curve and I had to 
spend at least 2 or 3 years in the "learning stage" (which I did on my 
own time while continuing to work in my previous field).  But I was 
bright, worked hard, and I learned enough to be at least competent.

Some managers probably would not want to hire me because they are 
looking for a "traditional" IT person...i.e. a 23, 24 yr old guy with a 
CS degree.  But those types of people are not always suitable to move 
up into management or lead teams, and they don't have the "soft 
skills"...communication, maturity, knowledge of different businesses 
and industries, and etc. etc. etc. that a lot of managers know are 
extremely valuable in an IT person.

Probably most managers are going to make hiring decisions based on 
what's worked for them in the past.  But a lot of them also know that a 
team is best if people do have a range of skills...and aren't all a 
homogeneous group of people the same age with the exact same 
educational background and skillset.  

And also I feel there is a lot of transferability between liberal arts 
and any field one chooses to go into...for instance, I studied the 
structure and usage of human languages...now I use different 
programming languages and they have similarities and differences just 
as human languages do...and then I spent 7 (of the most boring) years 
of my life proofreading and editing legal contracts...which taught me 
patience to wade through tons of code (which isn't exactly stimulating 
reading either in most cases!!), and a careful eye for detail.  So I 
feel that even if it's not "vocational," there is a place for liberal 
arts in education and it's not a waste of time to study it on the 
university level.

And also it bears mentioning that back in the early 80s, as a young 
white female my chances of getting into an "engineering program" were 
slim to zero.  I remember wanting to take Physics my senior year of HS 
and being told that "girls do not need that class since they will not 
be studying science or math in college anyway" (and mind you I was a 
National Merit Scholar and had been in "advanced" courses most of my 
school life)...and still they would not let me enroll.  Hopefully 
things have changed a bit since then.

So, what you're saying is that the US hasn't adapted as much as other

I could also argue that any programmer who has used several 
programming languages would have those skills regardless of whether they 
took liberal arts courses or not. It comes with experience.

They would not "let" you enroll? You mean, registering and paying your 
fees would be blocked? By who? The Police?

I started college at the end of the 80s and my CS class did include women. 
Again, this is in the UK so maybe your comment about the system still 
being in place in the US (and thus any institutionalized prejudices too) 
may have something to do with that.

It should be noted that in general, if you look at the numbers, 
undergraduates in science, math and related technical fields have been on 
a download path in the US since the bust 2001. Those occupations are 
perceived as not "safe" so generally numbers are down (and hence numbers 
of females too).

(I hope you would not waste your time "arguing" over something so 
glaringly obvious.  My point was that these skills are learnable in 
different ways, not just through a CS major).

Also, in case you are not familiar, public high schools in the US do 
not charge "fees" -- but are supported by government funds and tax 
dollars from property taxes -- and the school administration can make 
policies about which classes are open to which students, and they were 
within their rights at the time to refuse enrollment in certain classes 
to female students.  They also required at that time "home economics" 
for girls and "shop classes" for boys.  We were not allowed to choose 
which one we wanted, but were assigned based on gender.

I was referring to college not high schoola. But what you're saying is 
amazing to me. UK schools are also government funded but noone has as much 
control over who can do what. If a female student wanted to do science 
there's noone stopping her. Sounds very backwardc if you ask me...

Ajai -- in order to choose a math or science type of major at the 
university, students were required to have taken Physics in HS.  So 
refusing me permission to do the senior year Physics course in HS 
effectively left me out of that option.

Bearing in mind this was 30 years ago and I do HOPE things have changed.

Yes, they did. But this was common in Germany, too,  when my parents went to 
school. My aunt was lucky, she went to school right after the war and there 
was a teacher shortage. They just didn't have the staff to teach different 
classes. This is why she had geometry and algebra with the boys, something she 
really appreciated when she later worked as a taylor. She once had to make 
triangular and octogonal pillow covers. Among her staff she was the only one 
who could figure out how to place the pieces on the cloth to lessen waste.
When I went to high school we had all classes together, including PE. That was 
normal for us. We also had two years of "textile sculpturing" (couldn't find a 
better translation). It was like art class, but with textiles only. This is 
where I learned how to sow on buttons and make neat seams. Came in handy a few 
days ago when my son squeezed his teddy a bit too much and the back popped 
open. He was happy that I could do emergency surgery on his teddy. :)
Broad education is great....in high school!

David, I have to say, I do plan on returning to school at one point for 
my Ph.D...but it won't be in CS or any "vocational" field.   I have 
several things in mind but they're all extremely impractical. :)

The only "vocational" type of education I can see myself getting is a 
law degree if I ever, in the years I have left, do decide to pursue 
that...but we'll see how this programming thing pans out!

Also -- re our classes:  We had geometry and algebra and chemistry and 
bio --  but the calculus and physics were "for the boys". LOL!
I guess they were very afraid we'd start burning our bras and building 
nuclear weapons in our kitchens??

         Would you, and the general public, not consider Medical 
Doctors, Dentists, CPA, Certified Architect,
and Lawyers professionals? As you correctly point out the definition 
of a professions is a moving target
varying by profession.

         The real problem, as I see it, is that programming is not 
about syntax. Someone pointed out that they
would do poorly on a programming test because they don't memorize 
what is available in a manual. Creative
problem solving, system conceptualization and programmatic insight 
are the characteristics separating the
great programmers for the good programmers.

         When I was in college I took a non-computer course called 
Creative Problem Solving. It had more
influence on my programming, by far, than any computer course I took.

Most lawyers don't do much but practice the same thing over and over. 
At least programming allows you to do things never done before.

Well, of course, that's always been a concern. What you do with your 
bra is up to you, but we have to draw the line at building nuclear 
weapons in your kitchen. After all, it might spread to other rooms 
and who knows what might happen there. :-)

Tedd -- I've spent a LOT of time this week enumerating variables and 
dumping them out of $_POST arrays, and building sql strings...it's 
starting to seem a LITTLE monotonous...but nowhere near as monotonous 
as being a lawyer...!!

Which does go back to one of our (original) topics on this 
thread...that lawyers get more respect and money when what they do just 
doesn't require more brainpower than programming.   (At least I think 
that was one of the original topics...can't remember that far back!)

The bottom line is, whatever we have to do to increase the status and 
prestige of our profession, we have to do.  The only problem is that 
getting a roomful of programmers to AGREE on anything has never been 
done before!!! :)

OK, so if I don't have to *explicitly* tell the process to close, then
why do I keep getting a lot of threads that are Sleeping? And for a
long period of time? This is what is causing the slowdown on the
server. If I manually go into the DB and kill threads that have been
sleeping for a long time, then the system speeds back up.

There are three different levels of the CFA exam.
(an interesting side point, for people doing consulting, is the
definition of 'conflict of interest' and scenarios which do and do not
constitute a conflict in the level one CHA preparation material))
And you need four years of qualified experience.

I would guess the main reason why there are so few CHA's is because
it is harder to get qualified than people think -- not that it isn't 
valuable.

I am by no means an expert, by I always close the connections explicitly. My 
understanding is that the connection gets closed eventually, but by MySQL 
itself after a time out period. I'd just send the close commands and see that 
the connections are closed in a controlled fashion that I can influence. I am 
sure the one command more will be way less overhead than MySQL holding on to 
idle connections that never will be used again.

OK, that makes sense. I didn't want to do that just yet, because
things have been running fairly well since I ditched persistent
connections.

The curious thing is that MySQL doesn't seem to be cleaning them up. I
checked last night, and there were some threads that had been in sleep
for more than 7,000 (seconds?).

There are a couple of factors here.

-- when the Apache process actually terminates, because of Apache's process
settings

-- when the PHP script "shutsdown" which should typically mysql_close() the
connections to MySQL

-- when MySQL will kill a connection thread because of thread-reuse/caching
settings

That does seem like a long time.  On the mysql server, do show variables
like '%thread%'; and show status like '%thread%';

See if anything looks out of wack as far as configuration and server stats
go.  Are these threads being reused (check the thread ID).

Is this a high-load server?  You may want to try to restart Apache - if this
then kills those threads from sleeping, you've isolated it to something in
Apache/PHP.  These aren't persistent connections right?  There was a bug
sometime ago in glibc (if I remember correctly) that prevented connections
from closing correctly, but this likely isn't the problem so double check
the PHP code/config.

The only things you have to do is: a) to be good at what you do; b) 
help others; c) and be humble (my hardest) -- the rest will follow.

As for status and prestige -- who cares? Been there, done that, and 
it doesn't matter nor help. Either people are going to hold you in 
esteem, or not. But, there's nothing you can do change their view 
except be as good as you can be. It helps if you don't place too much 
value in what other people think. The only people you have to answer 
to are your clients -- as it should be.

>The only problem is that
>getting a roomful of programmers to AGREE on anything has never been
>done before!!! :)

That's where you're looking at this the wrong way -- it's not what's 
new in programming, but rather a new way to apply programming to the 
real world.

For example, I was the first nationally recognized micro-computer 
programmer to find oil with my software. I could go on with my 
accomplishments, but there's no need to bore anyone. If you're 
interested, please review my resume on my site.

It's not the method, but the application that's new.

Cheers,

tedd

Ah, useful to know. I thought (unthinkingly) that it was ok since I as
author and owner of the external sheet know that it's not evil. But the user
agent doesn't know that (duh). Perhaps I was also thinking it's like images
-- in many clients, blocked unless the user explicitly allows them.

Thanks!

My best tip is to go get an older version of FrontPage and use that.
Microsoft's lack of respect for web standards and general crappyness
makes for a perfect html email generator.  You want to use tables for
the layout, and all of the css should be inline.  Even a <style> tag
in the head is not well supported.

I also recommend choosing a layout that works with both images and css
turned off.  It requires extra time to make something that degrades
nicely, but it is worth the effort when it comes to email.

Regards,
John C.

Hi, I just joined the list and thought I would introduce myself.

I have been programming since 1995, well before that if you include  
the years I spend toying with BASIC. I just recently started using  
PHP, I find it well thought out, although there are somethings that  
take some time to get use to, I guess the biggest is setting cookies.  
The challenge is due to the way I am using include and processing  
forms on a single page it takes me a while to find the place in the  
process to set the cookie. Other than that I am very pleased.

I come from a Mac background devoting many years to learning  
everything I can on the Mac, but I have programmed on the PC in VB 5  
and 6. and moved on before .NET. On the Mac side of things I mainly  
use SuperCard, I have tried other development environments including  
REALbasic, which I would say is a good alternative for X-platform  
development, but for pure Mac applications I lean on SuperCard. I also  
dabble in C and Objective-C from time to time, to extend the  
abilities, or make custom functions for SuperCard.

For web development I started using PERL, which I still like and use,  
but PHP may replace PERL for my web development efforts. I have also  
used JHTML and JSP. for a short time. I am also quite pleased with the  
way JavaScript has evolved.

I work for a web site called Beliefnet, which was recently acquired by  
FOX Digital Media.

Well, I guess that is enough for now, I look forward to getting in on  
the discussions.

The cookie problem you're having, have you considered using a
framework to take the guess work out of when it is appropriate to set
a cookie (ie send a header)? Using a consistent method for processing
requests and delivering pages will often make the whole issue trivial.

I would suggest the Zend Framework (framework.zend.com).

Thanks, I'll look into it. Often when I start out with a different  
language I try to stick to writing my own code, so I can get to know  
the language itself. Then after at least one project I find my way to  
using the libs or frameworks. I will look into the Zend Framework  
though, it sounds interesting.

I can attest to symfony.  As someone who forced themselves to shirk  
frameworks while I learned PHP, I do enjoy a good framework.  Symfony  
has impressed me recently.

I would go for Zend Frame work, in our company we used (Code Igniter, 
Symfony, and Zend Frame). Zend is the best and very powerful.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] About Formalizing an Enterprise PHP and the PHP+
	Developer 
Message-ID: <000a01c8a488$55428730$ffc79590$@com>

It seems we (I mean PHP programmers) have all the tools and instruments
already at our fingertips for more formalizing the study and application
of PHP, we'd just have to agree to ring our wagons around what we've got
on hand.

For example:

a) we have the very large and well-recognized repository of PHP work for
reference and re-use at Sourceforge.net and PEAR, 
b) we have the very well used and respected Php.net as large-scale
reference hub,  
c) we have Zend offering a commercialized IDE/framework and other
enterprise updates to PHP 
d) we have a handful of large free PHP user groups and these groups, say
the top 10, should be formally recognized, and one should be expected to
belong to one of these groups.

So what would be wrong if we just agreed as a professional group to use
these above entities as our bedrock standards. We use the Zend cert, the
Zend IDE/framework and officially sanction Php.net and
Sourceforge.net/PEAR as the defacto outlets of help/reference and code. 

We would not deny the use of, learning of, or the amicable co-existence
of any and all other outlets/entities, but the above noted entities
would be the generalized initial standards.

So as a new programmer in books/classes/tutorials you are always pointed
to Php.net for reference, you are behooved to use from and contribute to
Sourceforge.net/PEAR, you are prompted/guided/expected to join a listed
user group, and you are advised to get Zend cert and learn that
IDE/framework. 

And that a programmer who has Zend cert. and is a recognized user group
member can use the status of PHP+ user/programmer on their
credentials/resume.

Just a thought. Now that could be a start.

Warmest regards, 
?

Hello Peter/et all,

I agree with a lot of this. I've been thinking about the same thing 
since the "OT Webmaster Test" thread started.

Some kind of move like this would surely help increase the quality of 
software and allow those
new to a project to become productive more quickly.

This is basically what we are doing at my current place of employment.

We've agreed on the Zend Framework, the zend modules and coding style 
(albeit somewhat improved), along with the
the PEAR/PECL repositories.

We also hold brief meetings before making extensions to the Zend 
framework, and general problem solving sessions
are encouraged.

Where else can we go with this, both my company and PHP community in 
general to make it more
of a "respected and enforced" *standard*?

Hello Peter/et all,

I agree with a lot of this. I've been thinking about the same thing 
since the "OT Webmaster Test" thread started.

Some kind of move like this would surely help increase the quality of 
software and allow those
new to a project to become productive more quickly.

This is basically what we are doing at my current place of employment.

We've agreed on the Zend Framework, the zend modules and coding style 
(albeit somewhat improved), along with the
the PEAR/PECL repositories.

We also hold brief meetings before making extensions to the Zend 
framework, and general problem solving sessions
are encouraged.

Where else can we go with this, both my company and PHP community in 
general to make it more
of a "respected and enforced" *standard*?

I believe that a starting point for a governing entity would be the
author of PHP (and/or his appointed representatives/associates), the
core developers of PHP itself (including Zend), and possibly the current
top-level leadership of the major User Groups. Review is annual as most
other such self-regulating bodies. Peter

Instead of trying to force a few applications, repositories and people 
into positions they are not ready for, would it not be better to 
organize efforts to contribute to those which are best suited to take 
those positions in the near future? A defacto standard is much more 
powerful than an appointed standard.

Instead of trying to convince everyone that PEAR is the best place to 
get reusable code, why not contribute to PEAR and remove all doubt? 
Instead of forcing everyone to sign up for a proprietary certification 
that does not have community support, why not create an open 
certification group that has the support of the community and gains 
community respect because of it? Don't just name user groups as 
something a programmer should be a member of, make them so valuable 
(through contributions of experience) that one will be foolish not to 
sign up.

If you can get a large group of people to take those steps, your dream 
of a well respected and formally recognized best practices and 
applications will follow.

I believe that all of the informal industry-standard acknowledgements
and accolades that you call for in your note have already been
informally applied to all the entities that you mention and that this
informal approved/sanctioned condition has existed for years for PEAR,
sourceforege.net, et al. This has not successfully gelled into a
reliable, knowable, useable set of standards that makes it possible for
programmers and managers to have a quantifiable standard to work up to
and within. I am still in the camp that PHP programmers like realtors,
financial planners should have an association approved path and tool set
that ultimately will have more knowable and strongly negotiable pay
scale. Peter

I would have nothing against an independently created and sanctioned PHP
cert devised/approved by the author/core developers, but it seems that
would be a big waste of how far Zend has already taken things and it
does not seem like there is sufficient momentum/cohesion to firmly
establish such an independent entity or it would probably have appeared
by now. Peter

YES!!  Yes yes yes.

Realistically speaking, though, nobody is going to like being "strongly 
urged" to use a particular framework or a particular code base.  And 
that's cool -- because we will always find ways to make the programming 
process "our own" and do it the way we feel is best, on a case by case 
basis.  

But as Peter pointed out, the cert is not really meant to lock us in 
to "standards", it's important so that we are able to say "I'm a 
certified PHP programmer and certified programmers get $XYZ per hour" 
and have the power to back that up when the suit types decide we might 
be a cost sink, or that we don't need a lot of money because "don't 
programmers all wear stained T shirts and exist on Pizza and computer 
games..."!   [N.B. It's quite true that I do eat a lot of pizza and 
enjoy playing computer games, especially the antique arcade variety, 
but that's not ALL I need!.]

With regard to Zend, I haven't used it yet but did some cursory reading 
on it today after seeing this thread...and it looks very interesting.  
Of particular value, I think, is the session & application state 
handling (which is always a huge chore and can lead to mental agony 
over "the very best way to handle it in this case") -- standardizing 
this into best practice could be huge.  I'd like to get a chance to 
work with some of this, and also the JSON/AJAX stuff ...I had an 
opportunity to work with JSON a couple years ago but not since then.

I did use PEAR::SOAP recently while working with some Amazon AWS stuff 
and found the code to be very understandable and well documented.  
Ultimately we discovered we did not need the PEAR::SOAP & could use 
PHP's built in SOAP, but I would definitely recommend this SOAP API for 
its ease of use.

The fact that we are discussing this is evidence that none of the items 
you highlight are ready to be industry standards and have not received 
enough acknowledgments. When these questions have one and only one 
correct answer, your vision will be a reality:

1) What is the best framework for developing a website in PHP? 
(<rant>Zend Framework is not a framework</rant>. Get some CakePHP and 
Symphony developers in the same room and see if you can get an answer to 
this one)
2) What is the best place for reusable code? (You keep saying 
"sourceforce.net/PEAR". There shouldn't be a slash.)
3) What user group should I belong to in order to get answers to my 
questions? (The answer here is "all of them")
4) Is there a certification that is guaranteed to be respected by anyone 
  I talk to when I go on an interview? (It could be argued that this 
question is not even needed)

The best way to answer these questions is to contribute to the 
projects/lists/whatever to make them better. One will show its merits, 
rise above the others, and become a real defacto standard. Then you can 
ask someone "Do you belong to group X? Do you have certification Y? Do 
you use application/repository Z?" Based on their answers you can make 
the PHP+ determination yourself.

I understand the motivation, but I don't think mandating a membership in a 
club is helpful. And why just limit it to the top 10? And who says/knows who 
the top 10 are?

Hmmm, I am not likely what one would consider "enterprise PHP", but I have no 
idea on how to outlet code on Sourceforge and I think the Zend IDE rapidly 
inhales big time. And while I do like a good IDE, I don't know if tying 
anything to a specific vendor is beneficial.

I think it is not good to have tool X define your standard and outright say 
that tool X is the standard. A standard should name specific requirements and 
rules as to what needs to be adhered to. If tool X can do that, fine, but if 
tool Y can do that as well and I happen to like it better, what's wrong with 
that. I know you are getting at that, but "amicable co-existance" is a no go 
when you clearly prefer one over all others.

Nah, have them look at the IDEs and frameworks that are available. For 
example, I think NuSphere rivals Zend (and I think it wipes the floor with it, 
but that is purely subjective), but both are not free. I find that a suitable 
classification of a free environment such as is the case with PHP ought not 
mandate and benefit for profit organizations as is the case with Zend.

I don't know enough about the Zend cert, but is that a cash cow like the cert 
programs are for Cisco or Microsoft? Are there any other PHP certifications in 
place? Doesn't CompTIA have something like that?
Also, who would be the entity issuing the PHP+ credential? If there is no 
place one could verify the credentials anyone can just write it on their 
resume, which devalues the credential quite quickly. Also, is it to be 
internationally or only nationally recognized (such as A+)?

So,

"recognized user group member"

And what does this actually mean?

Active on a mailing list?  Shows up at meetings?  Knows the organizer
of the group?  Pays dues?

As the founder and past president of LIPHP I can say that this is hard
to validate.  Sure, there are people in the group and on the list who
ask great questions and give great advice but as a user group, with
intentions of being free and open to all, I would be concerned that
this is beginnings of local politics" (not what you know but who) and
the lack of that is what I enjoyed most about our group.

I'm not poo-pooing the idea, just saying that really, it is going to
come down to this:

1. Candidate says that they are a member of User Group
2. Hiring manager goes to Google and/or mailing list of that User
Group and searches for that user
3. Hiring manager reads those posts and gets a sense of their
involvement (or lack thereof) and technical ability.

Which is probably what is going to happen anyway.

I believe in cert in general. I believe it provides a real tool for any
journeyman in any industry to launch themselves on a known career path. 

So I would have to answer yes. If a programmer has the knowledge and
poise to successfully rise to the series of questions and situations
that are posed in cert testing then I would feel comfortable we have a
more known entity of a programmer before us. From this benchmark
stepping stone we can as managers more reliably look for talent of a
known level and the talent has a known knowledge level to strive for. I
don't think it would take long for a PHP certified user to be matched
with a commensurate known decent salary that acknowledges their
practical study achievement and future potential. 

Now keep in mind, I am not a developer who is knowledgeable to the
maximum degree. I am not a PHP innovator myself. I want that clear. I am
not on a high-horse pontificating here. I am trying to help programmers
who are just now facing the knowledge/standards obstacles that I faced.
And I believe that, as I have stated in another thread, that the
seriousness of the quality programming that is needed (so much if it
related to financials) to we can no longer afford to just have an entire
industry of non-standardized developers. 

We need some self-regulation, a self-regulation that dares to boldly
recognize that our programming work is of tremendous importance. With a
recognized need for trust, accuracy, and standardized reliability
because our work touches more institutions and people in more mission
critical ways than was ever anticipated 10 years ago.

Peter

You know, not being able to go forward with a plan/concept/task because
"well, you know, all of the things that need to be in place for
perfection are not in a perfect state" and so therefore we do nothing,
is not how inspiring, new, bold work gets done.

Most businesses/new processes brought about through fresh initiative are
just brought together as best as can be done right now while the iron is
hot and perfection is a state that is usually never achieved or at best
we just keep striving for it in process and product.

I'm not saying I've got the answer. I'm not saying Zend is the only
answer. But I think the lack of knowable skill measurement hampers the
growth and respect of this PHP business, hampers and hinders fluid
hiring and keeps a large segment of programmers stagnated with no known
career route/objective to strive for. 

I'd rather go to any business interview being able to say "yes, I took
the cert and passed" than not.

Message-ID: <8f0676b40804221031u610d2d13v79e3d56826b0ee1c@mail.gmail.com>

I am a bit stumped on this one.

I have a products table with a standard auto number primary key, and a
descriptions table that is keyed off the product id and a language id
('en','es','zh_cn', etc)

I want to join the description table to the product table on a 1:0,1
basis, and if the users language is something other than english, I
want to use that language as the default but fall back on english.

I could do something like:

SELECT product.id, product.price, (SELECT d.description FROM
descriptions d WHERE d.product_id=product.id AND d.lang_id IN
(:1,'en') ORDER BY d.lang_id!='en' DESC LIMIT 0,1) as description
FROM product
WHERE product.category=:2

It works, but it sucks because I then don't know the language of the
result.  Of course I could add another sub select, but I feel like I
am missing some really simple way to just join the tables according to
the required condition.

Any help here would be appreciated.

Regards,
John Campbell

Ah, assuming you don't know the language prior to creating the query,
I think you'd use something like:

SELECT
	product.id
	, product.price
	, IF (lang_id IS NULL, 'en', lang_id) AS lang_id
FROM
	product
LEFT JOIN
	descriptions ON product.id = descriptions.product_id
WHERE
	product.category = :2

Notice that I removed ":1".

Many business profess that they want to have people who can think 
'outside of the box'
and yet they cling to a 'command and control' style of organization 
(versus say a 'teamwork'
style)

When the idea goes up for review by some board or committee, a member 
invariably asks
who else is doing something like this. And you have to explain no one 
else is doing this --
this is a *new* idea (its outside the 'box'). If the innovator doesn't 
have the luxury of being
 able to address the review members directly, the idea suffers dilution 
from being translated
by some manager or vice-president. It seems to take a long time because 
you have to add the 
extra step of explaining it to some intermediary.

Initiatives don't die because they are not implemented quickly enough. 
They die because
others in the organization either see that the idea is unsound and veto 
it, or they they
don't understand its value in the first place and don't move on it.

probably there's a cleverer way, but i would probably go with something
like this over a subselect: 

SELECT 
        p.id , 
        p.price , 
        IF(d.description, d.description, en.description) AS description , 
        IF(d.lang_id, d.lang_id, en.lang_id) AS lang_id 
FROM product AS p 
INNER JOIN user AS u ON u.id = :1 
LEFT JOIN description AS d ON (
        d.product_id = p.id 
        AND d.lang_id = u.lang_id 
) 
LEFT JOIN description AS en ON ( 
        en.product_id = p.id 
        AND d.lang_id = 'en' 
)
WHERE p.category = :2

Heh, well, Yahoo! also uses CakePHP for quite a few internal apps as  
well.  Mozilla uses Cake for many apps both internal and public-facing  
(http://addons.mozilla.org), Mambo is doing a from-scratch rewrite of  
the new version of their CMS in Cake 1.2.  Cake is also used  
extensively inside the UN, MIT, Yale, Panasonic, and CERN.  Oh, and  
BBN Technologies, the company that invented ARPANET and the use of the  
@ symbol for addressing email had their site done in Cake as well.

I could probably continue, but I think you get the idea. ;-)

Anyhoo, just my two pennies.

That is perfect... I feel dumb now.

Is there any reason IF is preferable to COALESCE?

I don't think there's any graceful way, but there's certainly a way known as
cron that is meant for just that very thing.

Don't use sub selects unless really necessary.  They kill performance.

Also, it's very helpful to use the same column names for the same thing 
throughout the database.  For example, use "product_id" in both the 
product and descriptions tables.  Makes things clearer and allows use of 
"USING".

Also also, use a consistent naming convention.  You've got plural 
descriptions and singular product.

Personally, I dislike aliasing tables (unless you're using the same table 
twice, of course) because it obfuscates the query.

Anyway, all that aside, except the first point, here's how I'd do it:


SELECT product.id, product.price,
COALESCE(user_lang.description, default_lang.description) AS description,
COALESCE(user_lang.lang_id, default_lang.lang_id) AS lang_id

FROM product
LEFT JOIN descriptions AS user_lang
  ON (
    user_lang.product_id = product.id
    AND lang_id = :1
  )
LEFT JOIN descriptions AS default_lang
  ON (
    default_lang.product_id = product.id
    AND lang_id = 'en'
  )

WHERE product.category = :2

Here is a nifty example of the COALESCE function that I found.  So 
basically this function is used to handle possible NULL values in a

That is a good example - an elegant if/else if/else :)

More or less.  Databases will have wonderfully standardized ways of
interpreting NULL, and even the functionality of this function, but the
concept is always the same.

This of course effectively rendering database abstraction layers in PHP
meaningless :)

Hi all,

I'd like to let everyone know about our PHP Meetup organization efforts.

On the 1st Tuesday of every month, at 6:30pm, we'll be getting together at
Pound and Pence for an informal gathering of PHP, web, and open source
folks.

Details are at http://php.meetup.com/430/

The meetups will be the informal networking events to compliment our
continued monthly general meetings at IBM.

The first meetup is May 6th.  The venue might start to get packed beyond 50
attendees, so please RSVP at the site above so we have a rough count.

We're also looking forward to continuing these events through the summer and
in conjunction with other area groups.  Looking forward to meeting up with
everyone at this first event, through the summer, and beyond.

Yeah, that's why I knew what I was doing was wrong.

While that was just an example, I am a bit stuck with legacy naming
that is all over the place.  I am not aware of any good method for
fixing a schema naming problem without a huge amount of
changes/testing.  I suppose I could create a bunch of views and fix it
piecemeal, but that will likely cause a ton of headaches.

Is there a defacto standard for schema naming?  For new stuff, I have
gone with table names as plural, and first letter is upper case, and
words separated by underscores.  Field names are lower case, separated
by underscores. Field keys should have the same name across all tables
to allow for USING.   I never know what to name timestamp/date fields.

How would you name the following tables?
Users
Permissions
User_Permissions  - a many to many connector table

Thanks,
John Campbell

Hi gang:

It would be nice to be a certified programmer -- I'm certified in 
other professions and it helps somewhat.

However, the problem as I see is two-fold:

1. What's required to become certified (obvious);

2. What are the qualifications of the governing body and its 
industry's support (not so obvious).

First, we need to establish a charter and solicit member 
participation. Then with numbers comes the authority to establish 
acceptable and proper criteria for certification.

Cheers,

tedd

         To you is obvious, to me not so obvious :-) I know I sound 
like a broken record but to me
programming is not about syntax it's about logic and problem solving.

         Many years ago Edsger Dijkstr, one of the giants of computer 
science, wrote an article
suggesting that a first course in computer programming be taught 
without using a computer.
At the time I thought he was nuts, but after teaching introductory 
programming for many years
I agree with the concept. Especially in the beginning, syntax get is 
the way of solving problems.
Any non-trivial problem will have multiple solutions. How does one 
determine if their approach
is the "best" solution to the problem and not simple a solution that 
works. In my experience
elegant (read simple) solutions do not happen while you sit at a 
keyboard but rather sitting in
a quite place with a pad and pencil.

         If you've never read "Programming Pearls" by Jon Bentley, 
beg, borrow, or steal a copy
and read it. It will change the way you look at programming.

Not so obvious; the various flavors of BSD unix have a large volunteer 
community going for BSD Unix certification, and they've only now 
starting to come together to actually HAVE a certification exam.

The latter is less important than the former; obviously if you've got 
Nobel winners on your committee it's easier to get backing, but you can 
do without them.

Should take you about 2 years, judging by BSDCert's progress.

I would agree. I have seen a few people whom became certified in  
various languages, but could not follow the simple logic of a program.  
When it came time to debug the code they where completely lost. If the  
function of sub routien did not produce the expected outcome, they had  
no idea how to find the root of the problem.
I am self taught in all but PERL, which was my first encounter with  
regular expressions. Had it not been for the regular expressions I  
would have learned that on my own as well. I have found that one thing  
in all programming languages is true and that is the logic, which  
makes it easy, IMHO, to learn multiple languages. The syntax is simply  
the structure or language, if you will, of the logic.

No, you took the word obvious to mean something not intended. I mean 
that it's obvious that certification will require some sort of 
testing for qualifications.

What isn't obvious are the qualifications of the organization that 
will determine those. Understand?

I think I read the first edition published in the 80's -- it sounds 
familiar. And I've probably read at least hundred other programming 
books in more languages than I care to remember over the last of 40+ 
years. In addition I've read literally scores of algorithm, fuzzy 
logic, genetic learning, problem analysis, matrix theory, spacial 
relationships, digital filters, signal analysis, data processing, 
chaos theory, AI, and a host of other computer related material. 
Currently, I read about a book a week -- I am currently reading 
jQuery and last week it was DOM scripting. Next week? Who knows?

So, I thank you for your suggestion, but I've been there.

Cheers,

tedd

I must have said it wrong. That's not what I meant. I used (obvious) 
and (not so obvious) to compare the two points I failed to make.

The point being, unless you have an acceptable governing body, you'll 
have no certification process.

Naming conventions were once a hotly debated issue back in the day when 
mainframes ruled the universe. An old applications programming technique was 
to prefix identifier. For example the Users Table would be called 
users_table and each element in that table would be prefixed with ut (for 
users_table) ending up with a file definition that looks something like

users_table(ut_time, ut_date, ut_etc.)
permissions_table(pt_time, pt_date, pt_etc.)
user_permissions(up_time, up_date, up_etc.)

Hope this is of some use

No matter how many certificates you stack on top of each other from
Manhattan to the Moon, it STILL does not equate to a BScs degree. I
see lots of people here bitterly complaining about legitimacy and yet
the avoid the very thing that gives them instant credibility, the
Degree.

My very first experience with sitting in front of a keyboard was in
fact while I was working on my degree at a time when BScs didn't exist
and colleges were issuing BSEE degrees for graduates who majored in
Computer Science.

From my experience with certificates, the only people who really
benefit from them are the companies that hype them and the test taker
courses that teach you how to take the test and not whether the
qualifications are solid or not.

From my perspective, have been a hiring manager for more than twenty
years, I know from bitter experience that certificate programs are a
LOT more marketing hype than they are a practical barometer for
gauging what someone is suppose to know about anything. Lots of people
can pass tests and don't know basis stuff when you set them in front of
a keyboard.

Some sound advice, GET THE DEGREE! When push comes to shove that is
what give you credibility not some pie in the sky marketing hype that
promises the moon and delivers chopped liver.

In a hiring situation when two candidates are pretty well equally
qualified, one with a degree and one without, almost ALWAYS the degree
is the determining factor for who gets the job!

This whole "self governing body" sounds a lot like a scam to me to
create a yet another bureaucratic monstrosity that has no power and
generates a lot of useless noise. Corporate Entities are obligated to
 do what is best for their stock holders and that is the driving force
 for how products generated by Zend Technologies evolve. The fact that
 they haven't become a Micro$$$ is perhaps only a matter of waiting for
 the right time and has nothing at all to do with "community". Whenever
 they figure out how to do a licensing gig like Micro$$$, to exploit
 all the PHP developers on the planet, then you will discover who exactly the
 "governing body" for PHP is to be sure.

 My experience with User groups is that they tend to think they are the
 "driving force" for products when in reality they are, well, User Groups and
 really don't have the power they think they do. They have the yearly
 meetings and put on their conferences etc. but its the Corporation
 roadmap that decides the directions for where the products go, not the user groups.

Mike -- 99.9% of the people posting on this list do have a university 
degree, from what I have seen!  A lot of them have MS or PhDs, even.

But, a 10- or 20-year old degree doesn't prove anything when it comes 
to current technology.  A certification in current technology proves 
that you are knowledgeable in a certain area, at least to a certain 
extent, and also quantifies the knowledge base for our profession as 
PHP programmers, which is why we are (mostly) in favor of a cert.

You make that sound sooooo easy.  But then again, I'm not one of the 
ones pushing for certification but instead pushing for reasonable hiring 
practice.  Makes no sense to me at all how a hiring manager would refuse 
to even look at a resume of an individual because there is no degree 
when that individual has many years of experience in the field.

I was stupid, when I went to college, I stopped after my first year 
because I didn't want to waste all my time in school when I could be out 
being productive, working, earning, and learning the best way possible, 
at the feet of real people who have been doing just what you want to 
learn.  Back then when there was such a shortage of anybody with the 
ability to program, this worked well.  I learned, I experienced, I 
earned, I taught, I even developed my own in-house curriculum for some 
special purpose language the company was using.  So, from all 
indications I made the right choices.  Until the dot com bubble went 
bang.  Was downsized.

I would love to pursue a degree, but, with a wife and 3 kids to support, 
and a mortgage to pay and spending 60 hrs. a week developing software 
free lance, it's economically challenging to seek a degree as well as 
time challenged.  I realize that many institutions will allow life 
experience to count toward some credits as well as you can pay to test 
out for other credits, but it's a daunting thought going back to school 
after being out for 23 years.

And that is acceptable to me IF AND ONLY IF the candidates are otherwise 
equally qualified.  The real problem is many companies won't even look 
at the resume to find out if you are either equally qualified or more 
qualified than the degreed person.

Hello Kristina,

You are right.

> --Kristina (B.A., 1985) :)

My B.A. was in 1986.

I am still a little suspicious about certification programs in general
from what I have encountered as a Software Engineering manager even when
I was at Microsoft. I frequently interviewed people with certifications
on their resume that you would have expected that they were
fairly knowledgeable about the area of the certification but in
practice I often found they were not.

Some of this stuff gets ugly. When I went from the East Coast to the
West Coast, I was shocked to discover, for example that certificate
courses were being offered in Quality Engineering that taught only how
to get through an interview with little or no course work in quality
assurance or testing, much like the degree spam you see today.

Proposing a certification process for PHP developers is not a trivial
undertaking and getting a "standard" by which to measure success is a
huge problem, I think. Like the Webmaster thread here in the past few
weeks, its an octopus that will require a significant effort to get a
clear set of boundaries and requirements. Hope it works out but I am
a bit skeptical about it for sure based on other historical factors.

I'd have to agree 100% that "in the trenches" experience and a track 
record of being paid to write solid code for many years is worth way 
more than any piece of paper, whether it be degree or cert or whatnot.

Unfortunately, there are few geniuses in HR :)

Mike --

I passed on the opportunity to take the Microsoft certs (back in my 
ASP/VB days).  I thought the questions were assinine because the tests 
had nothing to do with real world programming tasks and were more rote 
memorization of factoids.  Also I was convinced that those testing 
centers had quite a racket going charging 100 bucks a pop for each 
test, and 4 tests required for the cert!!!  

I think I'm pretty safe in saying that that is NOT where we want to go 
with any cert we may be discussing here.  We want it to have relevance 
and value to the marketplace.

It would of course be very valuable to have a Computer Science degree
that included actual hands on programming and multimedia.
But then it would still be best to have an professional
industry/association cert just like other serious technical/professional
careers that involve consumer/business finances, accuracy, trust and
ethics. 

I believe the most beneficial PHP+ cert that we can strive for would be
more on par with a Cisco cert. An acknowledged, industry heavy weight,
difficult but well worth while cert. I believe that the cert should be
advanced, sophisticated and relatively difficult -- the PHP+ cert should
not be about qualifying entry-level initiates, it would be used for
qualifying middle to expert level.

There could/should be a separate entry-level cert if needed.

No matter how many certificates you stack on top of each other from
Manhattan to the Moon, it STILL does not equate to a BScs degree. I
see lots of people here bitterly complaining about legitimacy and yet
the avoid the very thing that gives them instant credibility, the
Degree.

My very first experience with sitting in front of a keyboard was in
fact while I was working on my degree at a time when BScs didn't exist
and colleges were issuing BSEE degrees for graduates who majored in
Computer Science.

>From my experience with certificates, the only people who really
benefit from them are the companies that hype them and the test taker
courses that teach you how to take the test and not whether the
qualifications are solid or not.

>From my perspective, have been a hiring manager for more than twenty
years, I know from bitter experience that certificate programs are a
LOT more marketing hype than they are a practical barometer for
gauging what someone is suppose to know about anything. Lots of people
can pass tests and don't know basis stuff when you set them in front of
a keyboard.

Some sound advice, GET THE DEGREE! When push comes to shove that is
what give you credibility not some pie in the sky marketing hype that
promises the moon and delivers chopped liver.

In a hiring situation when two candidates are pretty well equally
qualified, one with a degree and one without, almost ALWAYS the degree
is the determining factor for who gets the job!

This whole "self governing body" sounds a lot like a scam to me to
create a yet another bureaucratic monstrosity that has no power and
generates a lot of useless noise. Corporate Entities are obligated to
 do what is best for their stock holders and that is the driving force
 for how products generated by Zend Technologies evolve. The fact that
 they haven't become a Micro$$$ is perhaps only a matter of waiting for
 the right time and has nothing at all to do with "community". Whenever
 they figure out how to do a licensing gig like Micro$$$, to exploit
 all the PHP developers on the planet, then you will discover who
exactly the
 "governing body" for PHP is to be sure.

 My experience with User groups is that they tend to think they are the
 "driving force" for products when in reality they are, well, User
Groups and
 really don't have the power they think they do. They have the yearly
 meetings and put on their conferences etc. but its the Corporation
 roadmap that decides the directions for where the products go, not the
user groups.

It would most likely benefit all if the questions/situations/reviews
were based on very contemporary (if not forward looking) programming,
i.e. the cert would be heavily weighted towards security,
state/cookies/sessions, database related, file handling and uploads, and
internet/SOAP/CURL. 

Maybe a rough categories breakout might look like this:

 5 % -- Package(s) and install
 5 % -- PHP .ini 
15 % -- Security 
20 % -- Functions 
25 % -- Classes
 5 % -- Error Handling 
 5 % -- RegExp
10 % -- PEAR/PECL
 5 % -- Version Control

Hi gang:

It would be nice to be a certified programmer -- I'm certified in 
other professions and it helps somewhat.

However, the problem as I see is two-fold:

1. What's required to become certified (obvious);

2. What are the qualifications of the governing body and its 
industry's support (not so obvious).

First, we need to establish a charter and solicit member 
participation. Then with numbers comes the authority to establish 
acceptable and proper criteria for certification.

Cheers,

tedd

Message-ID: <1208993331.32111@coral.he.net>

Hi everyone --

My current client's app is a PHP 4 site running on a Windows box (don't 
ask...I have no idea why).  I'm trying to use the mail() function and 
the mail isn't cooperating.  

(Two things that I noticed in phpinfo() are that Internal Sendmail 
Support for Windows is enabled and the Zend engine is installed.

So maybe I could/should be using another method to send the mails, or 
there is a trick that I'm not aware of that I need to use to get this 
to work?)

It's not necessarily super high volume but we will be sending a 
significant amount of automated emails to registered people on the site.

Thanks for any help...

--Kristina  (completely Uncertified in PHP and Unsure why the mail is 
not sending!)

There is nothing silly in engendering some conversation around promoting
an updatable cert that allows PHP to be constantly guiding programmers
up to and in to the known needed skills most highly anticipated in the
market today. 

I would like to clarify:

1) I originally suggested to simply use the Zend cert 

2) That I said that I felt that it behooves us as a professional group
of PHP programmers to have some standardized way to measure skill set to
clarify the career path for programmers and to give hiring managers some
kind of benchmark to start from 

3) I am not proposing that the cert be mandatory. It would be an
optional -- but highly recommended and PHP endorsed -- step that gives a
programmer a method to demonstrate his knowledge according to a known
standard 

Use the Zend cert. But PHP has to get behind it. And persuade it into
the hands of programmers/managers right from the get go.

I did my time. Read the books, made a library, read PDFs on my PDA while
I commuted, worked all night, fetched arcane answers from obscure blogs.


My experience says it would have helped to have a clearer professional
knowledge path set out.

But if we want to leave the industry as a bad lands of high plains
drifters and men with names who guard and protect their craft to the
exception of new comers then hey that is the way it stays and all enjoy.

But, I feel that if this PHP craft wants manage its identity. Plan ahead
for a future tightly integrated to more and more demanding
digital/internet alert businesses, then we should polish the methodology
of the tool set somewhat.

Pero, hombres, esto es solo mis dos centavos y usted debe construir sus
propios sue?os. 

Pedro

Because it is a stable setup and typically outperforms a LAMPP stack. I use 
this since day one and even before my PHP time for both development and 
production use.

I never got the mail() function to work right on Windows. There are tools 
around. I did try once the Unix Utilities from Luckasoft (get them here: 
http://luckasoft.com/download/UUtils_setup.exe). It is a freeware package for 
Windows that mimics sendmail. It has a GUI configuration program and accepts 
the same shell command format as known from Unix. But since this is a client's 
box installing extra stuff is probably the least desireable approach.

Well, there are other means. You may even google for the CLI of Outlook 
assuming it is setup and configured right.

Well, I guess once it works volume becomes a concern only when you send a lot 
of messages.

Sorry, I'm not excessively useful here.

Thanks David,

I found the following...is it worth trying to modify the ini file or 
should I start trying to use the Zend mail function and/or Outlook?

//==

Runtime Configuration

The behavior of the mail functions is affected by settings in the 
php.ini file.


Mail configuration options:

Name Default Description Changeable 
SMTP "localhost" Windows only: The DNS name or IP address of the SMTP 
server PHP_INI_ALL 
smtp_port "25" Windows only: The SMTP port number. Available since PHP 
4.3 PHP_INI_ALL 
sendmail_from NULL Windows only: Specifies the "from" address to be 
used in email sent from PHP PHP_INI_ALL 

//==

BTW the client's environment is a hosted server and I will investigate 
the options available if we determine that this turkey won't fly as 
configured. I wasn't anticipating having to install anything and not 
sure whether that is an option.

--Kristina

Hi John:

> I am a bit stuck with legacy naming that is all over the place.

Fun fun fun!


> Is there a defacto standard for schema naming?

There are loads of naming standards.  I think very highly of Peter 
Gulutzan.  The live version of the web page has been yanked, but 
Archive.org to the rescue...

http://web.archive.org/web/20070409075643rn_1/www.dbazine.com/db2/db2-disarticles/gulutzan5

I used to be in the plural camp.  But I've become fond of the singular 
camp.  That way the table can more easily match the names of the columns.  
This makes things easier when it comes to making automatic tools for 
sanitizing input and reverse engineering databases.  Particularly when it 
comes to things like this:

people
  person_id

loans
  loan_id

...VS...

person
  person_id

loan
  loan_id


> I never know what to name timestamp/date fields.

What's your issue?  Not calling things "date"?  I tend to call things 
"birth_date", "creation_date" etc.


> How would you name the following tables?
> Users
> Permissions
> User_Permissions  - a many to many connector table

system_user
system_permission
system_permission_user


But all this kind of stuff is up to personal taste.  When it comes down 
to taste, I often say, "Some people have it.  Some people don't." :)

All that aside, you didn't answer the burning question:  did my query 
suggestion work?! :)

Makes sense. I will join your camp.

Yeah, that's the crux of the problem.  I feel like it is something I
shouldn't have to think about, but every time I create a table I have
to stop and think:
"date_created or creation_date or created or date_added or add_date" and
"transaction_time or transaction_timestamp or transaction_datetime or
transaction_date"

Then I think, I'll just follow the last guys convention and discover
"the_date" is being used.  "the_date" is wrong on so many levels that
I can't stand the thought of repeating it.

Yes of course!... but Kenneth beat you to it.  I had it in my head
that I wanted a flexible fallback path for languages like:
zh_CN' -> zh_TW -> zh_US -> en_US
fr_CA -> fr_FR -> en_us

When I actually asked the question, I simplified it.  After I saw how
elegant and simple the two language solution is, I decided it wasn't
worth the additional complexity to have the fallback path.

Certifications about particular technologies are dumb, unless there's a 
certain amount of built-in complexity that justifies them (or not, but I 
don't know what Cisco certifications are like, etc).  PHP is a small 
enough system that it doesn't warrant it.

Any competent programmer can become satisfactorily proficient in a 
language in less than two weeks (assuming the language is of a common 
langauge class -- C to lisp is hard.  Perl or C to php is simple.  Also 
see C++ to Java, PHP to ColdFusion, Java to C#, etc).  Given two or 
three months, that programmer who gained some proficiency can become 
fairly expert.

If you want a certification, it should be wider.

As someone who's in a position to hire, I'd love to see a really strong 
certification that I could count on.  This would require conceptual 
knowledge, not particulars about a language.

I want someone who can (among other things):

    - Administer UNIX-like servers.  Including some basic understaning 
of package management, and also (especially?) compiling from source.
    - Can at least make their way around a windows/IIS type system.
    - Understands version control systems (for me, CVS + SVN, but you'd 
probably need to understand VSS in the cert exam).
    - Knows how to program.  Understands how to optimize (and when).  
Understands recursion.
    - Has a good knowledge of object-oriented things. 
    - Knows their way around major design patterns (MVC, Singletons, 
Factories, and so on)
    - Understands SQL -- you might be a PHP-expert, but if you're 
writing bad SQL your app will suck (unless it eschews SQL entirely -- 
how often does that happen).
    - Understands XML parsers.
    - Understands some common XML-based standards (SOAP, RSS)
    - Knows how to write a cron job that will actually work.
    - Can manually interact with an SMTP server (via telnet)

Knowledge of PHP's syntax just simply pales in comparison to the 
importance of this stuff.  PHP is *easy* to learn if ... wait for it ... 
you know how to program your way out of a paper bag.  ($bag.exit();?  
exit($me,$bag);? $this.parent = null;? ... maybe it's harder than I 
thought ... getting claustrophobic!)

All this stuff (together) is hard to test for, and it's hardly an 
exhaustive list.  It's also just the start of the list that *I* want -- 
some people might not care about version control, for instance.

But a much better place to start, IMO, is not a PHP certification, but 
some kind of overall web-development certification. 

I care a LOT more about a candidate having a good understanding of 
relational databases than I do about them understanding PHP.  I also 
want my subordinates to be clear on good semantic markup, and have a 
good, solid understanding of Javascript (these days).

Note that the lower-level Cisco certs (i.e. everything but the CCIE or 
its equivalent) now have a multitude of boot-camps available for them to 
push you through in a weekend, and therefore their value, both real and 
perceived, is slipping. It's been a while since I've studied the finer 
trivia of Cisco kit, but I'm confident I could muster a passing score 
all the way up to CCNP without studying for more than a weekend--a week, 
tops. Would you let me loose on your routers *only* knowing *that*? (The 
fact that I deal with Cisco kit in other ways on a daily basis 
notwithstanding...)

What makes the CCIE so valuable is that it contains both a written and a 
lab component, and the latter is damn *hard* -- it has a real failure 
rate in the double digits -- so that it's unlikely that you'll be able 
to pass it through book learning alone. That is to say: in order to pass 
it, you're most likely an experienced practitioner already.

I see a lot of talk about certifications, and I have to reiterate the 
question: why bother? In other words, what are you trying to accomplish? 
In order for it to really fulfill its mission, a certification basically 
needs to substantiate someone's years of experience and actual ability 
to perform: it's a *certification* that you can *do something* that 
isn't just your word for it, and it comes from an impartial third party 
(whoever they may be).

Of course, it matters a bit who the certifying authority is (which is 
why people value degrees from real colleges over mail-order degrees), 
but unless there is a statutory requirement for licensure and 
registration, the only value of the certification "in the marketplace" 
is what the holders are actually doing: if you've got a certificate that 
is, in a word, achievable in a week's intensive course, it's worthless 
except to paper collectors, and the market will value the certification 
accordingly.

Peter has successfully compiled the correct here. I would take it 
further: the exam should be QUITE difficult, and dilettantes should NOT 
be able to pass it.

Make a certification more like the PE, where you must show verifiable 
years of experience (signed off by another in the field), and have a 
tough exam on top of that (and I'm not even counting the EIT), or more 
like the CCIE, with a very difficult pair of exams, *written and 
practical*, and then you'd have a certification that is worth bandying 
about--something that conveys the elusive "I should get paid more 
because I'm *demonstrably* worth it" message.

Oh yes, it should also need to be renewed every 7 years or so, not just 
to generate income for the certifying authority, but to demonstrate that 
you're still at the level you claim to be.

> There could/should be a separate entry-level cert if needed.

Given the field of programming, I would suggest the "fog a mirror" 
certification. For $29.95, I'll provide you with a certificate suitable 
for framing. For $39.95, I'll even make it 3 color. (Latin available 
upon request, and only to Kristina.)

Really hope the questions about Left Outer Joins using COALESCE and how 
to get mail() to work on a Windows box aren't on the cert test??

Or I'm doo doo. :)

PS I'm not sure how to say "fogged a mirror" in Latin but we can look

Following up on my own post, just to be clear -- I think a certification 
exam for web developers is impossible. And/or the fact that you know PHP 
inside and out doesn't make you worth anything on a real project. You 
can't reduce the breadth and complexity to a multiple-choice test.  Such 
a setup is too easily gamed.

What might be interesting would be some kind of jury system.  If there 
were a 4-ish person jury consisting of, I dunno, Steve Manes, Tom 
Riemer, Jack Slocum, and Chris Corbyn , who would review a bunch of 
"thesis-like" stuff you put together, and then hop on a chat and 
interrogate you for an hour before saying "yeah, this guy/gal is pro or 
slow" -- then I might pay attention to that, when hiring you.

So who wants to help recruit some recognizable names, and start selling 
"shots" at such a cert.  Maybe 3 or 5 $k to sit in front of the jury ... 
I mean, you've got to pay these juries well.  These are busy people.

mail() used to work fine on windows (under IIS, anyway) last time I had 
to deal with it (years ago).

My suggestion:
    - Get an SMTP server hostname at your hosting provider
    - Use a better mail-sending system, like swiftmailer: 
http://www.swiftmailer.org/ (I think you can still get a reasonably 
up-to-date version that will work w. php4)
    - Send mail by having PHP talk directly to a dedicated SMTP box. 

This is almost always the right answer.

Tim -- thanks -- 

I am 99% sure that it's not my code that's the issue...I will look into 
the below first thing in the morning.  If it comes down to it, we can 
port the site to a new server if we can't make it work in this 
environment.

On the windows box you have to use the SMTP settings in PHP.ini AND
they need to point to your external mail server AND that external mail
server needs to not have port 25 blocked. My current ISP recently
blocked port 25 so my php mail quit working. I was using the same
access setting that I use for my POP account and it was working prior
to that, fyi. The alternative phpmailer works pretty well at least the
new one does so you might want to take a look at that to "fix" the php
mail problem on the windows box. Unfortunately, no elegant solutions
there for windows.

Forgot, I was using the mail.mysite.com and the IP address for same
with similar results and it worked beautifully until they blocked the
SMTP port on me.

I have had mixed results with windows sendmail clones. Fake Sendmail
worked sometimes but crashed a lot so I stopped using it. Pear Mail
works beautifully and allows you to specify authentication settings so
you can log into your external mailserver.

As I said earlier, moving away from just "mail()" is usually a good idea.

phpmailer used to be what I'd use, until I found swiftmailer, which is 
capable, nicely designed, and nicely implemented, and nicely documented.

the only downside to swiftmailer might be that newer releases are 
php5-only.  But I think that at the moment, there are separate php4 and 
php5 libraries available.

Now this roll up (redisplayed below) from Time Lieberman is excellent
and elegantly captures what a real PHP+ programmer would be. And in
reality and based on my own experience too, this skill set is exactly
what is most often needed and even silently tacitly expected when you
step into an advanced PHP programmer job OR you will likely need all
this knowledge if you are independently consulting and taking on entire
web site design, development and maintenance.

--------------- START: T. Lieberman advanced PHP+ rollup ------------

I want someone who can (among other things):

- Administer UNIX-like servers. Including some basic understanding of
package management, and also (especially?) compiling from source.
- Can at least make their way around a windows/IIS type system.
- Understands version control systems (for me, CVS + SVN, but you'd
probably need to understand VSS in the cert exam).
- Knows how to program.  Understands how to optimize (and when).
Understands recursion.
- Has a good knowledge of object-oriented things. 
- Knows their way around major design patterns (MVC, Singletons,
Factories, and so on)
- Understands SQL -- you might be a PHP-expert, but if you're writing
bad SQL your app will suck (unless it eschews SQL entirely -- how often
does that happen).
- Understands XML parsers.
- Understands some common XML-based standards (SOAP, RSS)
- Knows how to write a cron job that will actually work.
- Can manually interact with an SMTP server (via telnet) 

--------------- END: T. Lieberman advanced PHP+ rollup ------------

I would suggest to any average PHP programmer who is looking for a hot
list of "what do I need to know" to really get ahead. Then you can use
the above list almost like bible, the above knowledge set (with or
without a cert to test you) is a very good full tool kit of skills that
will make you a very valuable and versatile member/manager on most any
PHP job -- full time/part time/freelance.

My list below, I would suggest then, is very good knowledge set for a
beginner/intermediate level.


--------------- START: P. Sawczynec beginner/intermediate PHP+ rollup
------------

-- State/cookies/sessions 
-- Database related 
-- Email 
-- Forms 
-- File handling and uploads 
-- Internet/SOAP/CURL 

Educate yourself roughly committing time to concepts in these
percentages shown below:

 5 % -- Package(s) and install
 5 % -- PHP .ini 
15 % -- Security 
20 % -- Functions 
25 % -- Classes
 5 % -- Error Handling 
 5 % -- RegExp
10 % -- PEAR/PECL
 5 % -- Version Control 

--------------- END: P. Sawczynec beginner/intermediate PHP+ rollup
------------

Well, well something quite good has already come of this thread.

Peter

Certifications about particular technologies are dumb, unless there's a 
certain amount of built-in complexity that justifies them (or not, but I

don't know what Cisco certifications are like, etc).  PHP is a small 
enough system that it doesn't warrant it.

Any competent programmer can become satisfactorily proficient in a 
language in less than two weeks (assuming the language is of a common 
langauge class -- C to lisp is hard.  Perl or C to php is simple.  Also 
see C++ to Java, PHP to ColdFusion, Java to C#, etc).  Given two or 
three months, that programmer who gained some proficiency can become 
fairly expert.

If you want a certification, it should be wider.

As someone who's in a position to hire, I'd love to see a really strong 
certification that I could count on.  This would require conceptual 
knowledge, not particulars about a language.

I want someone who can (among other things):

    - Administer UNIX-like servers.  Including some basic understaning 
of package management, and also (especially?) compiling from source.
    - Can at least make their way around a windows/IIS type system.
    - Understands version control systems (for me, CVS + SVN, but you'd 
probably need to understand VSS in the cert exam).
    - Knows how to program.  Understands how to optimize (and when).  
Understands recursion.
    - Has a good knowledge of object-oriented things. 
    - Knows their way around major design patterns (MVC, Singletons, 
Factories, and so on)
    - Understands SQL -- you might be a PHP-expert, but if you're 
writing bad SQL your app will suck (unless it eschews SQL entirely --

    - Understands XML parsers.
    - Understands some common XML-based standards (SOAP, RSS)
    - Knows how to write a cron job that will actually work.
    - Can manually interact with an SMTP server (via telnet)

Knowledge of PHP's syntax just simply pales in comparison to the 
importance of this stuff.  PHP is *easy* to learn if ... wait for it ...

you know how to program your way out of a paper bag.  ($bag.exit();?  
exit($me,$bag);? $this.parent = null;? ... maybe it's harder than I 
thought ... getting claustrophobic!)

All this stuff (together) is hard to test for, and it's hardly an 
exhaustive list.  It's also just the start of the list that *I* want -- 
some people might not care about version control, for instance.

But a much better place to start, IMO, is not a PHP certification, but 
some kind of overall web-development certification. 

I care a LOT more about a candidate having a good understanding of 
relational databases than I do about them understanding PHP.  I also 
want my subordinates to be clear on good semantic markup, and have a 
good, solid understanding of Javascript (these days).

Message-ID: <c5a.2d7a4b51.3541dd0b@aol.com>

 
Just to give you another convention, I do:
 
1) tbl<object> for tables, with the singular, like tblEmployee -- not really 
necessary in SQL statements directly, but I use a class to generate SQL 
statements, so in PHP function calls I can tell what's a table more easily
2) I capitalize field names with no delimiter, except that I do all caps for 
acronyms, like EmployeeName, EmployeeID
3) For dates, for some reason I put Date at the beginning, like DateOrdered, 
DateShipped.

Makes sense. I will join your camp.

Yeah, that's the crux of the problem.  I feel like it is something I
shouldn't have to think about, but every time I create a table I have
to stop and think:
"date_created or creation_date or created or date_added or add_date" and
"transaction_time or transaction_timestamp or transaction_datetime or
transaction_date"

Then I think, I'll just follow the last guys convention and discover
"the_date" is being used.  "the_date" is wrong on so many levels that
I can't stand the thought of repeating it.

Yes of course!... but Kenneth beat you to it.  I had it in my head
that I wanted a flexible fallback path for languages like:
zh_CN' -> zh_TW -> zh_US -> en_US
fr_CA -> fr_FR -> en_us

When I actually asked the question, I simplified it.  After I saw how
elegant and simple the two language solution is, I decided it wasn't
worth the additional complexity to have the fallback path.

Cheers,
John Campbell

So, everyone knows what I think of this thread and the one preceding
it regarding testing and such.  I won't go there.

However, now that some specs have been laid as to what some employers
want and some ideas for the implementation, I challenge everyone (or
anyone interested) to put some numbers and policy ideas behind it.

1.  Potential employers have spec'ed out what they want (list below,
for example) and how to prove it (test, jury system).  Well, how much
are you willing to pay?  Candidates, how much do you need to do this?
Is it worth it?  IMO, the "jury aspect" easily makes this $150K+perks,
benefits as you are greatly narrowing the available talent pool

2. How does a developer who goes through this process have their
investment of time and money protected?  So, I just spent 5k on the
jury process and passed.  Are companies allowed to hire non-certified
developers?  If so, then what is the value of my investment?  If they
are not, sounds like a union to me.  And if it is a union, don't you
think that it would just force more work overseas as unlike
contractors and electricians, our work is not bound geographically?
Do we then need state and national regulation to prevent this?

People seem really passionate about this idea - so lets flesh it out
and see if it really works, then.

Finally, to the employers, if you wouldn't mind, I would be interested
in hearing about some of the horror stories that have driven you to
this.  I want to hear the scenarios that you feel this testing and
policy (my word, not yours) fixes.  For example, did you have someone
on staff that during a "crunch time" didn't know how to use cURL while
a big client was on the phone?  That kind of thing.

Kristina:

I think the technology is moving faster than academia. Formal 
education is nice for proving you know how to take test and muddle 
through all the nonsense that colleges dish out, but the real issue 
here is if you can do the work (whatever that may be).

And, if you look at the "qualifications" posted on this list as being 
required, you'll see that it is very large net. Probably larger than 
any one person can master. One even required knowing windozes, so 
that fails the process for me.

I think it's probably pointless to try to get this group to agree on 
anything, let alone certification.

Cheers,

tedd (MSc., 1984) :-)

Surprise, surprise.

But to their defense, they have nothing else to go on but what can be 
put to paper or provided by a test and therein lies the problem. They 
are hired to judge, but don't have the qualifications to do so.

I got this to work once using IIS6 on WindowsXP Prof. which is a lot 
like Windows
Server 2003 (you didn't mention which version Windows you were trying 
this with)

I had the IIS server turned off and used the IIS Manager plugin to point 
the windows
mail server to a Linux mail server relay style. The Linux machine was on 
a private
network but with another public facing interface.

To test it you can
Open a window cmd box and start telnet (set localecho)
and 'open localhost 25'.

You enter 'helo' and get something like '250 10.10.x.x Hello [127.0.0.1]'
mail from:email at any.com   .                '250 2.1.0 
email at any.com....Sender OK'
rcpt to:valid at domain.com                   '250 2.1.5 valid at domain.com
DATA                                                '354 Start mail 
input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>'
test test test

.
250 2.6.0 <DESKqjTfLiCiW8St44v00000003 at 10.10.x.x> Queued mail for Delivery

I can mail you the settings for the properties (in the IIS Manager) if 
you want.

Hi Kristina

I was wrestling with this problem a few months ago, I remember having to do 
some fiddling with the PHP.INI. Anyway the coding below works for WINDOWS 
and PHP 5


<?php session_start; ob_start;
    ini_set("SMTP", "smtp.isp.com");
    ini_set("smtp_port", "25");
    ini_set("sendmail_from", admin at isp.com);

   $to  = "johndoe at hotmail.com";
   $subject  = "Enter your subject here";

   $message = "YES IT WORKED @ LONG LAST
                        I can put anything I like here";


   $from  = "FROM: admin at isp.com ";
   mail("$to", "$subject", "$message", "$from");

   echo "The email has been sent";
?>

Hi Paul,

Thanks.  We are on PHP 4.x and Windows 2003 server and looking through 
the directories through FTP, there doesn't appear to be an existing 
PHP.INI file...the tech support is directing my client in what settings 
to configure in PHP.INI (Port 25 and STMP=localhost and so on)...I'm 
assuming for PHP 4.x I have to create this PHP.INI file?

Is it worth trying the below on a 4.x platform?

When I was having problems this is what was suggested to me.
============================================
If you are trying to send through localhost, then PHP expects to be able to 
connect to port 25 on localhost and talk SMTP to it to send the email.
If you are using your ISPs mail server to send the email, then I would test 
from the command-line by telnetting to port 25 if your ISPs mail server and 
trying to send an email via SMTP.
If you can't connect to port 25 then check for things like firewall settings 
or whatever "security" is running.

As for PHP 4, I am very sorry but I could not advise or help. This is how I 
use it, all the ini_set are correct  and required by windows, everything 
inside is correct too - except for port "25" - maybe.

The "smtp.kacomputerconsulting.com" tell Windows this is outgoing email and 
from where
The "smtp_port" tell windows from which port
The "sendmail_from" tells windows from whom

<?php session_start; ob_start;
ini_set("SMTP", "smtp.kacomputerconsulting.com");
ini_set("smtp_port", "25");
ini_set("sendmail_from", "ka at kacomputerconsulting.com");

$to  = "johndoe at hotmail.com";
$subject  = "Enter your subject here";

$message = "YES IT WORKED @ LONG LAST
                     I can put anything I like here";

$from  = "FROM: ka at kacomputerconsulting.com";
mail("$to", "$subject", "$message", "$from");

echo "The email has been sent";
?>

try it, it should work.

    I've been coding in static languages for my day job for much of the last year,  but I'm still using PHP for my own projects.  I'm increasingly coming to appreciate dynamic object construction,  dynamic method calls and 'magic' methods in PHP.

    As much as I like symfony,  it feels like an invader from the Java universe.  When are we going to have a mature framework that ~feels~ like PHP?

You know, I feel much the same way about the Zend components... reference
implementations of important patterns, for sure, which I've enjoyed using on
Big Important Projects but they hurt my head to use, what with the
Zend_Package_Class_Subclass naming, the zillion page manual...

Generally, though, as a RoR/Symfony/Django/Zope/Drupal veteran, I'm tired of
these monolithic frameworks. If it needs a book, it's too much for me these
days. I love (usually) Drupal for what it is, but websites built in Drupal
are built _in_ Drupal, and the language happens to be PHP. Same with
Symfony. I think CodeIgniter feels fairly PHP-ish, but for something with
supposedly no learning curve, it's still a bit steep.

Further, I've long wanted to write a very simple set of flexible helper
functions for PHP newbies so they don't blow their brains out with things
like mysql_query("insert into blog_entries values(0, "{$_POST['title']}",
"{$_POST['body']}");

You know, provide simple active record, super simple controllers, no
configuration, lightweight templates, pack it into one file to include in a
single front controller, and forget about it. Plus a strong mission to avoid
bloat... and that's it. Everything else could be a plugin, including the
automatic admin architecture that was cool two years ago, but which I find
pretty useless these unless you really _are_ setting up a CD library
management system, the user management subsystem, blah blah blah.

Web.py, but for PHP, you know? And we could just use PHP for templating
anyways, so it'd be lighter and simpler still.

I may just build this.

I've only played very little with the big CMS++ type systems like Drupal 
and Joomla.  Always seems to me that the learning curve is just too 
steep and it's too easy to get backed into a corner which means spending 
days doing it "right" or else you end up with some ugly hack.

I haven't played with symfony, but did take the time to play with 
CakePHP on a couple of biggish projects.  It's not so bad, though there 
is a learning curve.  The nice thing is that once you're done with the 
learning of various conventions, lots of things are very quick -- but 
you can still resort to isolated "hacks" (or really, just lower-level 
coding) to get things done.  The downside is that anything beyond simple 
one-table operations seems to be horribly inefficient, and I fear for 
the day that I have to try to optimize things.

For a while, I was using my own little system, which was an unholy 
marriage of PEAR's DB_DataObject (for activerecord stuff) and Smarty.  
It basically just extended DBDO with a render() method (for single 
records) and a renderList() function for recordsets. I've since decided 
that a non-PHP syntax for templates is just dumb -- so I don't use that 
anymore.  I might re-implement with PHP for templates and start using it 
again.  It can speed some things up.

Cake's main advantage is that it simplifies the simple cases for lots of 
UI stuff, which is usually a huge timesink.

Of course, once I got comfy with Cake, I started getting interested in 
what I can do on the front-end with extJS (http://www.extjs.com) -- 
maybe in a few months time I'll be fluent enough in both to have a good 
clean integration, which might be cool -- or might be completely 
unworkable... we'll see.  One of the big problems there is that by using 
something like Ext, you're throwing out all of the saved effort of using 
Cake's view helpers, etc.

Anyway, just my $.02 on the state of PHP frameworks (or at least those 
I've played with seriously).

Enter CakePHP, stage left.  It is at this point far and away the most  
popular PHP framework:

You must know this is where all frameworks and monolithic systems are 
born.  The seed is the desire to solve some problem, like db 
connectivity and front end controller.  And before you know it, you have 
had to extend it to cover the edge cases and other need.  And one day 
you open your eyes and see the beast staring at you.

php.ini is probably in the WINDOWS folders or the equivalent on your
server as is my.ini as I remember.

My PHP.INI is sitting in the root directory. Search using "mail" and 
hopefully it will be of some help. It might be prudent before you alter your 
PHP.INI to make a backup.

Fortunately, you haven't done so yet and thereby introduce the world to 
another SQL Injection attack and path disclosure vulnerability. :)  You 
have to escape input into the query and ensure $_POST variables actually 
exist before using them to avoid PHP notices.

Of course, you can say you were just posting short hand.  But you were 
being pretty specific in your example.

The best way to get the framework you want is to build your own. The
downside is that maturity takes time and application across many
related projects to achieve, but the upside is that you have a
platform that works the way you do.

I love how this thread follows hard on the heels of the "must
standardize on Zend!" mini-conference, so obviously this advice isn't
for everyone. But if you feel constrained by what you have used in the
past, take a few weeks to whip up something new.

Not necessarily true, secure string interpolation is coming soon:

         I've written a DB abstraction layer in which everything is 
hash array based. The insert it method
header is:

   InsertNewRow($HTML,$_POST,$NewKey,$Table);

where $HTML is an error or progress message. There are several assumptions:

The first field in a table is named ID and is an auto-increment fields.

$_POST elements have a key that is the same as a table field name. 
$_POST[FirstName]
would map to a field named FirstName in the specified table.

There CAN be $_POST elements that do not map to any table field.

The update function header is:

   UpdateRow($HTML,$_POST,$Table,$KeyName);

$KeyName is the field name, almost always ID in my case, and must by 
undefined in
the $_POST array.

Another workhorse is:

   ExecuteQuery($HTML,$Select,$Result,$Count);

Where the $Select variables contains the desired action such as

$Select = "SELECT * FROM Messages WHERE ID = \"12345\"';

         This is then processed with:

   while($Row=mysql_fetch_assoc($Result)) {
     extract($Row);
     action code
   } # End of while($Row=mysql_fetch_assoc($Result))

         The class also has a bunch of handy methods.

         I didn't write it to make it easy for a newbe but to make it 
easy for me :-)

Yuck.  Such tactics are a cop out for doing the job right in the first 
place.  It adds significant overhead.  It's just another set of functions 
ot achieve security, which if not used, will leave people in the same 
place anyway.  Let alone, that paritcular project is just for JavaScirpt.

The only reason I could see for using coldfusion is that you have a  
site already written in it and you don't want to rewrite the whole  
thing in PHP. Maybe if the only other developers on staff only knew  
coldfusion? That might also be a good case. Other than that I don't  
see any advantages.

Ah, well, I respectfully disagree.

Though this project is specifically for JavaScript, the fundamentals
can be applied to PHP.

There are simply too many vectors  for attack when developing a PHP
application, start thinking about a typical mash up application, where
you take in user input, store some information on your DB, contact
another web application, maybe run a UNIX command and then deliver the
whole thing. Input from the user, another web application, your own
database and any static files on your server has to be checked for all
of the following injections: SQL, HTML, JS, CSS, XML/JSON (third party
web application), CL. All of these vectors have to be checked for at
different processing times in your application, and each has a
different method for escaping nasty input.

Caja aims to take the guess work out this situation by automatically
detecting what kind (SQL query, CSS definition, etc) of string your
creating and correctly escaping or removing any suspect strings. As
far as "getting the job done right", what if the job changes? What if
a new vector of attack is introduced when some junior developer starts
using data from a third party resource in a way your system doesn't
account for?

> It adds significant overhead.

Well, we won't know that until a version for PHP is published, but, I
found the results the Caja team got for JS to be pretty encouraging.

> It's just another set of functions

The whole point of this endeavor is that we already have too many
security functions to account for, each with an unmaintainable
structure CleanX(StringWithMarkers, ValuesToReplaceMarkers):

CleanQuery(), CleanCommandLine(), CleanHTML(), CleanHTMLAttr(),
CleanJavascript(), CleanCSSDef(), CleanCSSAttr(), etc etc etc

Instead imagine:

Clean(String);

I don't know about you, but I prefer the latter.

Hello all ;)

I am building some custom software and one of its modules will need to 
calculate shipping price given the shipping method, weight, possibley 
size and zip codes. Now, I've found a handy Perl modules in CPAN 
(Bussiness::Shipping) that pretty much cover that thing for UPS, USPS 
and FedEx. However, there is nothing for DHL, and I will need that as well.

So, the question is, does anyone know how similar things could be 
implemented in PHP? Are there modules around that do that already?
If, not would building that thing in Perl and exposing it via SOAP would 
be a good idea? Application is pretty big and potentially will require 
to perform well given a solid load... and I am not quite sure SOAP-thing 
would be able to accommodate it?

Best regards, Alex

No, that's simply one way to measure.  You could also go by our number  
of downloads (624,000 since May '06), or the size of our community  
(8,300 on the mailing list and avg. 175 on IRC) which is almost double  
that of Symfony's, and several times that of CodeIgniter's, or the  
fact that we consistently chart significantly higher than both on  
Technorati.  That's about all the metrics I could come up with in a  
few minutes, but I'm sure there are others I'm overlooking.

I worked in CF for a couple years before moving to PHP.  This was around 
version 5 (it's been about 7 years).

CF was quick to learn and allowed me to get the job done.  The language 
provided plenty of built-in goodies including database connections, ftp 
and scheduling.  Anything that wasn't built in could be added using cfx 
tags and cfscript.  My biggest issue back then was the inevitable "tag 
soup".  Tag Monsoon might be more appropriate.  Also, most libraries - 
and even tutorial sites - cost $$ (akin to ASP) - at least back then, 
which was a no-no for the just-starting-out full time web developer that 
I'd been at the time. 

To its credit, as a local network manager for an international financial 
software company downtown, I bought a CF book for $20 from a street 
vendor and changed the entire company's support / service branch for the 
better by providing an intranet based on their orginal access database 
which they (ahem *I*) used to ftp from/to 5 offices internationally 
every Friday. That was after about 3-5 weeks with that book and a copy 
of homesite (now dreamweaver).  I spent about a year with that app 
thereafter and it became incredibly difficult to maintain because of the 
tag soup I mentioned above, but to start - and to learn, quick and easy.

I'm sure it's become a different beast since the move to the Java code 
base.  But if they're still all about the tags, I'd recommend against.

After I left that job, I moved to PHP and rarely, if ever, looked back.  
Happily.

Good luck!

Dave,

I work with Coldfusion day-in and day-out. It is a fantastic language 
that can get a lot of things done quickly. It's powerful, versatile and 
has an easy-enough learning curve. Don't listen to anyone who just says 
'PHP is better', or, 'If you're starting from scratch, start with PHP', 
any evaluation to that degree is coming from someone who has little to

How about the non-free closed-sourcedness, or is it? I prefer something I
can download and run on my own pc if I please --  IOW I'd like to be able to
run a replica of the live CF site without paying anyone any money. The
article on wikipedia said you could "theoretically" run your CF app with an
app server like Tomcat. With something like MySQL/PHP you can way more than
"theoretically" run a copy of your production site on your own box, both
technically and legally.

I too worked with CF and ASP years ago - also moved on to PHP and other 
open source technologies. (Yes, and Im never going back either).

Suprised noone has mentioned that hosting CF apps requires a Java 
application server (and all of the deployment complexities that that can 
entail).

David,

Technically no. I've found it well summarized like this, Coldfusion is a 
developers tool, when used as Coldfusion, but when used as Java, it's an 
engineer's tool. Although I also say, Coldfusion is for Developers and 
PHP is for programmers. =D

In some sense I would see benefits, one being that you can customize the 
actual core by deploying your own Java.
Blue dragon is what I usually recommend for those who are shy to the 
high price tag of CF.

(And it would be JRun, Because Tomcat won't do the trick  =P)

That sums it up for me. The first web application I ever built was an
online poll using Cold Fusion circa 1998. The production company I was
working for was too cheap to shell out for the server, and in
researching alternatives I found php.

The price was right of course, but it you could also do so much more
with it because of access to all these free C libraries. The code
reuse benefit of open source was pretty clear.

I thought I was pretty clear, that query was an example of what many newbies
do, not what I would do (... so they don't blow their brains out with things
like ...) exposing a vulnerability and almost certainly exposing themselves
to copy-paste repetition. It certainly wasn't shorthand, and I've seen it a
thousand times.

I think we're all a little sensitive about jumping on posts that
illustrate worst-practices because there's the perception that newbie
developers will pick them up as they trawl the archives. They must be
getting these crazy ideas from somewhere, right?

Hopefully anyone reading this list has seen "filter input, escape
output" enough times to know that "{$_POST['title']}" is just _wrong_
no matter where it appears.

Maybe next time just annotate it with an <--anti-pattern note...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] using PHP mail function on Windows server?
Message-ID: <1209222682.13660@coral.he.net>

Mike -- apparently there isn't one automatically created for the 
account and I've been instructed to create one myself.  I also 
uncovered some other settings that are required for the file upload 
which need to be set, such as upload_tmp_dir ... this should be a fun 
weekend.

The thing that confuses me is that the documentation says that PHP will 
first look for the ini file in the directory where the PHP script is 
being called, and THEN look for it in the root directory.  Does this 
mean that I can have more than one ini file in my application...or?

I think the best place to have it would be in the root directory where 
it can be accessed by any scripts...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] using PHP mail function on Windows server - update
Message-ID: <1209259762.11052@coral.he.net>

Hi everyone,

Well, more weirdness.  I tested the code this afternoon and it actually 
worked on the Windows box -- twice -- sent the email upon initial page 
load and again when I reloaded the page.  But then completely stopped 
working.  This was before I had created the php.ini file, and the only 
two times it ever worked on the Windows box.

I then tested the same code on my domain server (a Linux/Apache setup) 
and it worked like clockwork, so it is most definitely NOT my code that 
is the issue (or stuff needs to be added to the code to work with 
Windows).

Pretty basic mail() code:
//===
$to = 'ka at kacomputerconsulting.com';
$subject = 'Completing your Registration';
$message = 'Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!
Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!
Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!Hello there!
Hello there!Hello there!';
$headers = 'From: registration at clientdomain.com' . "\r\n";
$wmessage = wordwrap($message,70);
mail($to, "Subject: $subject", $wmessage, $headers);

//===


I then created a php.ini file and put the following in it:

SMTP = localhost
smtp_port = 25
sendmail_from = registration at clientdomain.com

and put this first in my local directory and then in the root 
directory; tested each time and still no dice, mail is not sending...

Hello Kristina,


What about using the IP address instead of localhost?

I am assuming you are one a Windows box with WAMP.  You must set your 
php.ini sendmail_path directive.

Example: | sendmail_path = "C:\wamp\sendmail\sendmail.exe -t"

That is assuming that you haven't done it already.  If you are not on a 
WAMP setup then point the directive to the right path.

Hello,

Do you have sendmail running on the linux box?  Is port 25 listening?

Can you send mail from the command line like:
 > mail user at example.org

Make sure the SMTP service is running on the Windows box,
If its not -- check the System Event log for errors.

Maybe the way the mail server is being called (from PHP)
is causing it to die.

What I mean is stuff like this can happen:

*[2 Sep 2003 10:54am UTC] ap at d-dt dot de*

Yes, sometimes it also crashed with my code when I'd used
it via the command-line (php.exe, the cli-Version does not
always produces the crash), but it worked with php_mod.

I think it depends whether I have a null-messagebody or
null-Subject. (There were some situations where it crashes
and the "null-situation" was at least one of them)

Hi Tim, in addition to the erratic email sending, the debug messages on 
Windows for PHP really are, well, non existent.  We don't have access 
to the process log on the box, either.  I'm not sure what caused the 
sending to be erratic, we have subjects and large message body on each 
email.

Yesterday, on advice of tech support, we moved the modified php.ini 
file with actual URL instead of "localhost" as SMTP parameter, and 
placed it in the cgi-bin folder instead of the root.  We had some 
success sending test mails but when we tested the actual code in the 
app, it was failing again.  I tested the same code, only passing in 
hardcoded strings in place of the querystring values, on my domain 
server, a Linux box, and it was perfectly fine.  

The only thing I could think of was that there might be white space 
around strings passed from the querystring parameters into the email 
code...so I used trim() around them...still no luck.  

I give up.  We have put in a request to be switched to a Linux box!!

Tim -- I am going to bring this issue up with the tech support people 
over there...and see what they say.  It does seem erratic and a lot of 
potential for failure due to various reasons...which is not what we 
need...we have a ton of emails which will be automatically going out 
for various reasons and need 100% reliability.

What I meant to imply is that you should check the bug logs

I'm sure I've got more than one known problem :)

I'm just leery of the whole Windows/PHP thing now.

Hi Anthony -- well, we've definitely made the decision to switch from 
WAMP to LAMP.  There are definitely plusses and minuses on each side, 
for sure.  Thank heavens, since this is an externally hosted site, I 
don't need to be a Linux genius (now THAT would be an issue)!  All of 
my previous experience developing PHP apps was with LAMP.  So this has 
been a learning experience for me.

The issues I found with WAMP are:

-- poor understanding on the part of sys admins of where the modified 
php.ini file should live, and why, and how it affects various functions 
of PHP.  Consequently a huge testing cycle and anxiety about future 
issues that might arise with new code.

-- Non existent debug messages (i.e. blank white screens rather than 
semi helpful line number messages)...although that could have been a 
setting that we neglected to unearth & configure.

-- Completely erratic performance with the mail() function and since 
this is a critical part of our app (13 different emails going out 
either after site visits or at various timed intervals to hopefully a 
ton of people who register), this was a huge concern for me; and

-- weird issues with the $_FILES array behavior and more fun trying to 
get php.ini to work right for that.

So maybe I'm just a wimp but back to LAMP I go.  I figure I've got 
enough headaches just trying to roll out the app and make sure it's 
working right without all of the above.

In regards to the error reporting on a debug machine I like to have the 
php.ini warning set to all.  At runtime you can do it bye this function:

error_reporting(E_ALL);

Hope that helps.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] rounding time values to the nearest hour
Message-ID: <481761B5.20504@polymerdb.org>

Hi Gang,

Anyone have a handy way to round time values to the nearest hour? 

I've got time values stored in the database (MySQL) and often need to 
group them by the hour (e.g., times between 09:30 and 10:29 get grouped 
under 10:00).  Up to now I've been splitting on the colon and figuring 
it out based on the separate hour and minute values, but I thought there 
might be a better way...

Thanks,
Allen

round(seconds / 3600)
e.g.

ROUND(TIME_TO_SEC('00:39:38')/3600) ;

First, you need to convert it to a number, like minutes or seconds.
Then to round any number to any arbitrary interval, you can use this
formula:

round(num/interval)*interval

In your case the interval would be 60, but you would need to multiply
the end result by 60 (minutes) or 3600 (seconds) again to convert it
back to hours.

Are you / were you using WAMP5? some other WAMP package?

I have been running WAMP5 on my XP Windows box for a long time and the
differences are not that great between it and my LAMP Hosting site (at
least for my development work, I do development stuff on XP, transfer
it to my Linux server and it just works, maybe other stuff that I don't care
about is different?), though the php.ini in WAMP5 is located in the
Apache/bin folder as are many of the PHP dlls ( I has a huge RTFM
issue with that one when I first installed it) folder which is significantly
different from other WAMP packages I have run.

Hi Mike,

To be honest I'm not even sure what version it was.  There was a 
php.ini file for the entire PHP installation, and then we needed a 
second php.ini file for our particular domain app, which they had first 
told us to place in the root and then changed their mind and said place 
in the cgi-bin folder.  I have a feeling that some or all of the below 
issues could have been due to a poor understanding on the part of sys 
admins as to the proper configuration of the environment.

The sys admin stuff is definitely not my strength...I was pretty 
proficient in IIS back in the day but this stuff is totally outside my 
experience.  So I just felt, let's switch back to something that I know 
works.

Hey Everyone
I'm a junior web dev and I'm starting to slow down my groove in being
self-taught. I'd be really grateful if anyone could lead me towards valuable
courses or training programs here in NYC... Mainly about PHP, MySQL, maybe
even mobile web dev, new platforms. I always have tons of questions while
teaching myself and then spend a great portion of the day looking for
answers when there could be a teacher there to answer them. I could get so
much more done and packed in the cranium if I could just find a course!

Thanks everyone!

If you sign up for the MySQL newsletter/email they usually have training 
sessions going on but they have a cost associated with them.  If you 
write on this list individuals can guide you in the right direction but 
for a personal session check out NYU and their listings.  They might 
have a course for PHP (which means enrolling and then paying).

Haven't checked in a while.

I've been a php person for close to 10 years. These days I find myself
slowly playing more and more with Ruby. PHP is great of course, pays
my rent, but Ruby seems to be luring me in.  Just fun learning
something new.

It's aways good to have a few programming languages under your belt.
Also the jQuery/CSS combo is really exploding these days, you can do
some amazing things in that space.

Some Ruby (and other cool books here):

And if you want to have lots of fun, start diving into the Google API.
Mashing up maps with myql is a great place to turn out some cool
applications.

Rather than paying someone to teach you, I've found that taking on new 
projects where THEY pay YOU, is the best way of learning new things.  
No option to procrastinate or make excuses or take time to dilly dally 
playing with things that aren't relevant...you need to stay sharp and 
think on your feet, and do what you need to do to solve the problems 
and surmount the learning curve.  You've got to deliver to the client 
what you are being paid to deliver, and deliver you will or go down 
trying.

I can remember 10+ years ago when I first started out, for sure I 
talked myself into a few situations that were way over my head...but 
learned from the failures.  Now I always look to expose myself to new 
stuff whenever possible, and just accepted a gig where I will be 
exposed to OO PHP 5 (rather than 4.x) and Drupal for the first time, 
and in a high pressure environment.

So my advice is don't waste time enrolling in courses and courses and 
becoming a professional programming student...jump into the fray and 
find someone to hire you to solve their business problems by writing 
code...the best way to learn.  If you are starting to get bored mucking 
around with textbooks and sample code, there's a good reason why and 
that is that you are probably ready to take a paying job.  If you're 
already taking paying jobs but are unsure if you will be considered for 
the next level and don't apply, APPLY!  You'll be surprised perhaps 
what you will be hired to do.  Look for projects that will teach you 
the things you want to learn!

Please know that you can rely on these good people here on this list to 
help you with any questions you may run into during your work, and good 
luck!
