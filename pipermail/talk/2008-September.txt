I already use print statements.

I've been programming php for about 1 1/2-2 years without a debugger.

I can do it.  I'm just hoping to speed up my development.

I can't think of any other ways to cut corners.

Start out with the xdebug extension to PHP.  This adds debugging 
abilities to PHP itself.

Then from there you have to get an editor that can talk to xdebug.  I 
have never gone ahead and done this, so I can't give specifics, but the 
idea is to have something that can talk back and forth to the server on 
a back-channel while the page is processing.

Start out here:

Xdebug is my personal favorite. xdebug.org.
-- installs as a php module, works about the same on Linux and Windows.
The venerable dbg started it all. http://dd.cron.ru/dbg/
-- can be a pain to use. Have to purchase to get latest fixes, but works for
most   cases.

In order to see the debugging info you need an IDE.
I've used both PDT and Eclipse with phpEclipse. All the Java Dev stuff
makes it pretty bloated, but most of that can be removed or disabled.
Recommend at least 2GB RAM.
Komodo is also a good one. Not Free (or free)
http://activestate.com/Products/komodo_ide/index.mhtml

I tried the trial of Zend Studio once. Didn't like it because the server
component requires lots more than just debugging modules.

There's more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP_IDE

I've been using fpdf also for years.  The problem I have with it is when I
want to fill in a form.  I know I can do that by XY coordinates but I need
to set up a site where people around the country can fill in a state tax
resale certificate.  So there are many different forms with the same
information.  I did this a few years ago with JAVA and iText but I need a
PHP solution, and I'd rather not figure out the XY coordinates for every
states tax form.  Fpdf is made for this and if the bloody thing would
compile I'd be in fat city since I already have made all the state tax fpdf
blank forms.

Yes, there are debuggers for Windows. One of the popular ones is dbg, but 
there is also xdebug. They are usually included in an IDE, but as far as I 
know they can also be run on the command line, but I have no idea how that works.

I use NuSphere PHPEd which comes with the commercial version of dbg. Other 
IDEs that use the free versions of dbg are Luckasoft's EngInSite Editor for 
PHP (www.enginsite.com) and PHPEdit from Waterproof (www.waterproof.fr). 
Waterproof gives out free licenses when you ask them for one and explain to 
them that you only want to use it for private projects. You can get 
Luckasoft's IDE for free as well if you translate the GUI strings and help 
file for them to a language currently not listed, otherwise you need to buy a 
license for a fair price. Luckasoft often bundles other apps in such as their 
MySQL client, which is the best MySQL client I have seen. And then there is 
Zend, Eclipse (you need to puzzle it together yourself, your mileage may vary, 
I had no mileage at all), Maguma, plugins for Microsoft VisualStudio, and 
others. Some even have both dbg and xdebug available, but most implement it in 
a way that is obstrusive to efficient development as they force a stop at 
start of each script file. So if you develop as I do and segment the entire 
project into individual script files that each include a logical module then 
stopping at every corner gets old really fast.
NuSphere costs money, but not as much as Zend and unless you are hooked on all 
the Zend stuff I am convinced that NuSphere's IDE does the trick. I did some 
development in VB some years ago and got acustomed to the excellent IDEs from 
Microsoft (probably the only area where Microsoft is actually good at). 
NuSphere is not a VisualStudio clone, but provides the same level of luxury 
and all the features. And it has the debugger implemented in such a way that 
it does not need to stop at the start of each file, but can run through a 
dozen files and then stop at a break point in the 13th file. NuSphere's IDE 
also comes with its own web server so you don't need to fork around in the 
Apache config file to get the debugger dll loaded and working (although, that 
is quite easy with Apache). NuSphere has also internal browsers and you can 
switch between IE and Mozilla engines, but you can also use an external 
browser and still have the full debugging capabilities. And that will allow 
for example to add additional debuggers to Firefox so that you can debug 
client side scripts (which is why I doubt that there is an all inclusive 
debugger as PHP is server side and ECMAScript is client side).
If you are interested in NuSphere's IDE, I have version 5.0 that I would pass 
on for a small compensation. It allows getting the upgrade to the current 5.5 
for 39$. I think that is dirt cheap, even the other pricing isn't as 
ridiculous as that from Zend, but Zend gives you everything and two kitchen 
sinks. It depends on what you need. I used a trial of Zend Studio for a few 
days and then gave up. I just couldn't figure anything out. IMHO Zend Studio 
is the opposite of "intuitive".
What is interesting is that several tests have shown that the performance of 
the XAMPP stack on Windows is better than on Linux, so developing PHP on 
Windows isn't that off the mark as some may claim. I use the XAMPP from 
apachefriends.org as 'production' server, there are other providers of XAMPP 
stacks, but I found the one from apachefriends to be the best.

HTH,

David

The ./configure script keeps a config.log in current directory of all
of the tests it's tried. Usually the tests involve dynamically
creating a small test program and then trying to compile it. If that
compilation failed, you should see the compiler error. It could be
just a missing dependency that the vendor didn't anticipate or it
could be that PHP uses a specific API that isn't present in the
library you want to use.

Excellent advice, thank you, that told me quite a bit.  The relevant log
entrys are:

configure:32582: checking for FDF support

So a bit of googling and I find this usually means there are 32 bit
libraries that are for some reason incompatible with 64 bit libraries.  The
things I've read say link the incompatible libraries to their 64 bit
versions.  Since the Adobe toolkit is distributed in binary form, I'm
guessing it's 32 bit, I'm not sure how to get around it.  I don't
particularly want to reformat the server with a 32 bit OS.  I'm thinking the
difference between a 64 and 32 bit version is minimal.  Is there a way of
forcing php to compile in 32 bit mode?

I know that with PHP (and, of course, without PHP) it is a snap to
create something like an online Contribute button on a web site that
hooks to PayPal for credit card contribution/payment processing.

But, client doesn't want to use PayPal. 

So is anyone aware of any other similar or alternate service provider(s)
that can very similarly allow users to contribute online to something
like a medical center construction fund. So that the client can likely
set up an account with the provider and then users can uncomplicatedly
contribute online to the fund via a major credit card(s).

Warmest regards,

Peter -- for people who do a lot of international sales and need fraud 
protection, WorldPay is a decent option that some are using.

It's not as easy to set up as Paypal but not too onerous.  
Documentation was good a few years back at least.

I'm just curious but does anyone know what the origin of the class
underscore per-directory naming convention used by some frameworks is?

Meaning, a class with a name like:

  Zend_Auth_Adapter_Ldap

would have a script file path that ends with:

  /Zend/Auth/Adapter/Ldap.php

Also, do people sense a trend in the PHP community to follow this convention?

If you were to encounter a library that used this convention, would it
be considered a positive quality?

How do people feel about the use of Java-ist "Constants" interfaces like:

  interface Sql_Constants
  {

      const SELECT = 1;
      const FROM = 2;
      const WHERE = 3;
      const NOT = 4;
      ....

  }

where the objective is to permit any class that needs these constants
to access them using "self" like:

  require_once 'Sql/Constants.php';

  class Sql_Parser implements Sql_Constants
  {

      public function parse($sql)
      {
          ...
          if ($tokenCode === self::WHERE) {
              ...

Authorize.Net is popular. You can find PHP classes that interface with
their payment gateways (although I never used them myself).

But regardless of what payment gateway provider you use, you'll first
need a merchant account that supports that provider. The merchant
account is acting as a bank in this case. The payment gateway just
handles the transaction details, auditing numbers, refunds, etc.

Note that by default MasterCard and VISA is all you get by default.
For AMEX, Discover and others you'll need to take additional steps and
pay additional fees.

Also, note that CC processing is actually a little expensive. It's
about $40 a month if you have no sales whatsoever and then an
additional 2-4% of each purchase depending on the customer's bank
location.

Finally, just a thought, but if you're taking donations you might have
additional tax responsibilities. Not sure, but if I donated $1000 to
building a medical center I would probably want something to prove my
deduction to The Man if necessary.

Hello,

Yes, I follow this name space / naming convention. Learned from Zend and 
kept using.

Since PHP doesn't support namespaces (like java) I guess the next best 
thing is the "Zend_Auth_.." style.

To the best of my knowledge, it originated in the PEAR project ...

   http://pear.php.net

... and it was adopted by lots of other projects thereafter, not just  
frameworks.

I do; but then, I am biased in favor of it..  ;-)

I can help you get that setup - i use it for a few clients...

a couple of options exist as well

paypal pro is nice

2checkout.com ... but make sure they can use it - i think as long as
they are a 501/3c thing

e-onlinedata options
authorize.net - https://www.e-onlinedata.com/amerids
Plug'n'pay - https://www.e-onlinedata.com/amerids

chargeeasy - https://www.e-onlinedata.com/ameridsce (in person)
Retail - https://www.e-onlinedata.com/ameridsre (also in person)

i can help with the software for these if you need it

php i assume

If memory serves me, WorldPay has horrendous setup fees for a small

Hi Mike:

I'm a bit late, but hey...

> I am thinking that maybe I need to break up the second function into a
> more specific set of functions

The structure your code takes doesn't matter at all.  You have a set of 
steps you have to take.  It doesn't matter if you write them all in line 
or in five hundred separate functions.

What you need is good debugging/logging code.  At each critical step 
(like a call to PHP's mail() function, for example), log the parameters 
you passed and the response that came back.

Hello Mike

Defining interface constants, according to me, is not good design pattern even 
if it is enabled later in PHP.

Reason behind this is that Interfaces are primarily designed to define types 
and not to hold data. As well as when any class implements any Interface it 
means it will be implementing all the Methods defined in Interface. This is 
not required in case of Constants that means primary purpose of Interface 
(what is defined in the Interface must be implemented) is not met.

There are certain disadvantages also as mentioned in below thread.

That would not be true if the constants represented an enum or more
generally values that never change.

An enum defines a type that can be a specific subset of values. I
think that qualifies as part of an interface definition.

A constant could be thought of as a method that accepts no parameters
and always returns the same value.

Consider the following:

  interface Math_Constants {

      const PI = 3.14159265;

I think PI would qualify as part of an interface definition. The value
of PI will never change.

However, if for example the interface were used to "define" database
connection parameters then that would be a gross violation of an
interface definition (and a poor use of const in general).

Very nice read thank you. Ahhh, so then where and/or what's next. 

Now that AJAX and AJAX-like technique in the new browser/desktop
environment is rapidly becoming a defacto standard and google has rolled
out their new Chrome browser (the thin edge of the wedge in the google
adhoc, distributed, net browser/OS initiative up against hemmed-in MSFT)
which behaves very AJAX like. (I downloaded Chrome. It does have a nice
business-like, stay out of your way feel. Positions your bookmarks
collection on the right. Which for a rightie, does seem to feel like a
natural place to have them. For me the right hand bookmarks feel so
natural, it almost doesn't feel natural.) 

So going mobile. Mobile platform -- that is what it next (actually now).
And like AJAX, mobile didn't announce itself. It just happened
everywhere, at the same time. 

Mobile phone = Calendar/planner, contacts, GPS w/ text to speech
turn-by-turn instructions, wi-fi connection, browser interface to web,
911 emergency tool, weather, news, camera, webcam, game console, music

platform, email send/receive, texting, call log and lastly phone calls.
All timed, merchandised in flexible contract and non-contract configs,

No, that's not at all what an interface is for.  An interface is nothing
more than a contract which specifies what methods its implementors must
define, it is not a sneaky way to implement multiple inheritance

If it will never change, there is no value in including it as part of an
interface definition 

Some libs with a lot of constants define a dedicated class for them,
others implement them in a parent class, both are valid strategies which
make sense in different situations

Well I don't want to get into a big argument about it but I don't agree.

In the abstract sense of the word, an interface defines how to
interact with a separable component of a library. In C this would be a
simple header file containing DEFINEs and prototypes. I the case of an
object oriented library, this would be a class or more generally an
interface definition.

Also, I think interfaces can be used to implement multiple inheritance
(provided that multiple inheritance is warranted or course). There's
nothing wrong with multiple inheritance provided that the concepts
being implemented are orthogonal. In fact, for practical programming
reasons, you have to use multiple interfaces to implement multiple
inheritance (as opposed to extending one class an using interfaces for
the other concepts).

I disagree.

For example, a library that provides an interface for a concept like a
circle might very well need a constant like Shape_Circle::PI for the
library to be able to compute things with adequate precision.

And again, an enum defines a type that is restricted to a specific
subset of values. IMO that is unquestionably something that could be
part of an interface definition and in PHP that amounts to a sequence
of const declarations as PHP does not support enums.

Hi Michael, 

Well, if it works for you, go for it.  I think it's a bit weird and
extremely unintuitive to inherit from an interface, and I wouldn't have
expected it was even permitted, but it turns out it's even documented
(apparantly it only works for constants):

http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

I don't have a problem with multiple inheritence, it just seems very
kludgey to me to implement it with interfaces; I guesss PHP gives you
little choice though..

Quite the opposite. The only non-kludgey way to implement multiple
inheritance is to use interfaces because if you use a class you cannot
implement *it* without extending it and you cannot (or should not)
extend multiple classes as overriding inherited methods can easily
lead to non-deterministic behavior.

For example, let's say you have financial instrument interfaces
"Stock", "Bond", "MutualFund" and "MoneyMarket" where a mutual fund
can be traded like a stock or a bond but a money market instrument has
characteristics of a mutual fund (I'm not a financial wiz - this is
just an example). So which one do you make the base class? The answer
is very simple: none. You make an interface for all of them and then
create concrete classes that implement each of the interfaces
required.

As far as I can tell, it is the only kludgey or non-kludgey way to
implement multiple inheritance in PHP, and all you can inherit from an
Interface is consts.

It's quite idiomatic in other languages to extend multiple base classes.

That's what an Abstract class is for.  An interface is for exposing a
contractual set of methods, like Observer, Observeable, etc..

It depends entirely on your need.

If you just want a "quick show of hands" style poll, check out
http://checkyesorno.info or http://friendfeedback.com

For Twitter based polling, it's hard to beat StrawPoll -
http://strawpollnow.com/

If you already have a Drupal, Plone, Joomla, WordPress or phpBB site,
there are poll modules that integrate with each of those, and are
pretty slick.

If you're looking for a complete survey, rather than just a quick
poll, LimeSurvey (http://limesurvey.org) and Drupal or Plone's webform
modules are powerful, flexible and open source.

If you want a hosted solution, Dmoz has a huge list of hosted poll
providers: http://tinyurl.com/hosted-polls

Of that list, I've used PollDaddy and SurveyMonkey, and I think I like
SurveyMonkey better. Be aware that most hosted poll providers use a
tiered service approach, with limited free accounts.

Nice, I had no idea that StrawPoll had gone "platform".

We use SurveyMonkey at work. I hate the way the polls look--why aren't
standard html form controls good enough?--but it gets the job done and
you get a nice export of the results. Respondents are likely to have
seen it before, which can help your response rate.

As mentioned before, it's not really free if you use it for anything
interesting, but it's not exactly expensive, either. "Free" and
"survey engine" sounds like a privacy nightmare in the making to me.

If you are looking to hire someone you might be better off sending it

i'm well aware of NYPHP jobs list

is there anywhere on my post the word HIRE?

i just want some feedback 

does anyone on this list ever dealt with coding escrow script?

or even manage website that offer escrow service.

I?m sure there are some issues that can be avoided while

integrating this service on a site on a design level as well as maintenance.

 

and dude, you should do some reading on Open source.

My understanding is escrow is a legal term and you have to follow some 
pretty strict regulations when offering to escrow money.

The function is simple, you take the payment, you stick it in an 
account, when the payment is authorized you release the funds to either 
the original payer or the intended recipient.

If there is a dispute, you have to provide a method of resolving the 
dispute.

If you release the money back to the initial party, you can't charge 
them CC fees, so you have to eat them.

But please, I have no idea how much of this is correct, so consult 
someone in a financial or legal industry to give you the ins and outs.

yes,  i know that 99% of online escrow services are not real escrow service 
they just use the term escrow
the only real online escrow service is escrow.com
"All escrow services offered on this Website are provided independently and 
exclusively by Internet Escrow Services(SM) (IES),
one of the operating subsidiaries of Escrow.com. IES is fully licensed and 
accredited as an escrow company and is subject to compliance
with all applicable escrow regulations, including the California Financial 
and Business Code. "

I play with some of this polls and they are not use full to me.  I wanted to
be able to add
the poll into a web page.  I did find other polls software and looked at the
code for
hyperpoll and they use cookies and a flat file to keep track of the votes.
I will write something
similar.

Thanks for your replies,

Nestor :-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Table Indexes
Message-ID: <78c6bd860809070917s2cffc729h86c80850e081cdd4@mail.gmail.com>

I need a table that will be used basically as a map between records in
another table and I'm not sure how to create the indexes.

At first I thought I would just do something like:

  CREATE TABLE map (
      id int(5) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      a int(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
      b int(5) unsigned NOT NULL,

      PRIMARY KEY (id),
      UNIQUE (a,b)
  );

But I think I could work around dumping the id if that would help
which would give me:

  CREATE TABLE map (
      a int(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
      b int(5) unsigned NOT NULL,

      PRIMARY KEY (a,b)
  );

However ultimately I want to do queries with WHERE clauses like:

  FROM map m3, map m2, map m1
  WHERE  (m3.a = m2.a AND m2.b = m1.a AND m1.b = 72)
      OR (m3.a = m2.a AND m2.b = m1.b AND m1.a = 72)
      OR (m3.a = m2.b AND m2.a = m1.a AND m1.b = 72)
      OR (m3.a = m2.b AND m2.a = m1.b AND m1.a = 72)
      OR (m3.b = m2.a AND m2.b = m1.a AND m1.b = 72)
      OR (m3.b = m2.a AND m2.b = m1.b AND m1.a = 72)
      OR (m3.b = m2.b AND m2.a = m1.a AND m1.b = 72)
      OR (m3.b = m2.b AND m2.a = m1.b AND m1.a = 72)

so I'm wondering if I want to optimize lookups by a OR b so perhaps I
should do something like the following (not sure if this is even
valid):

  CREATE TABLE map (
      a int(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
      b int(5) unsigned NOT NULL,

      INDEX (a),
      INDEX (b)
  );

Or maybe I should have no indexes at all?

  CREATE TABLE map (
      a int(5) unsigned NOT NULL,
      b int(5) unsigned NOT NULL
  );

Can anyone recommend which method I should try first?

Don't create the auto increment pk, as it is unnecessary.

With MySQL the fastest is often:

Primary(a,b)
index(b)

And in sometimes you even want:

Primary(a,b)
index(a)
index(b)

I think mysql treats primary key pairs as a simple concatenation.  If
you don't index b, then the searches are really slow.

Good read, and I appreciate the post. However, I had one semantic
issue that bugs me here:

"Much of the Web has traditionally been created using dynamic
languages, from Ajax on the client to server code written in PHP,
Perl, Python and Ruby."

AJAX is not a "language"! Grrr. Of course this is Lam, who works at
Microsoft, so you have to forgive him I suppose.

I've definitely seen Javascript rise in prominence of what I do on a
daily basis. It's starting to take up more and more of my time as
clients go from wanting back-end functionality to matching front-end
wizardry.

Nevermind - $key is an int so 'foo' is being cast to an int which
evaluates to 0.

I think I would prefer that switch be a little more explicit.

Hi Michael,
  Switch isn't the problem. Arrays are going to behave like  Arrays no
matter how you choose to loop through them.

$tmp = array('foo','bar','zap');  is the same as typing

$tmp = array(0=>'foo', 1='bar', 2='zap');

If you don't specify the index, PHP will start using numbers starting
at zero as array keys. So in your example, you basically ended up
doing this
$tmp = array(
      ' foo ' =>1,
      ' bar ' =>2,
       ' 0 '=>'zap');

I hope this helps clarify things.

Should switch be more explicit, or should the programmer? :)  Don't depend
on auto type casting...

That's not it. Your $tmp array has three elements; the first two 
elements are 1 and 2, and those elements have associative (that is, 
string) keys, foo and bar respectively. Your third element is zap, and 
it has no key specified. When PHP is given an array element with no key 
specified, it uses the next available integer. In this case, that is 0. 
So PHP is understanding this: 0 => 'zap' which is exactly what your 
output shows:

>> [foo][1]
>> [bar][2]
>> [0][zap]

That's what I'm saying.

In this case PHP looks at $key and sees (int)0. So now it auto type
casts 'foo' to an int which for any string yields (int)0 and thus the
case matches the 0 => 'zap' element unexpectedly. If switch used a
typed comparison it would not auto type cast and it would compare
(int)0 to (string)'foo' and because the types do not match I would get
the expected results.

But of course if switch used a typed comparison you would have to code
something like:

  $str = '5';
  switch ($str) {
      case 5:
          // no match ?!
          break;
      case 'foo':
          ...

as:

  $str = '5';
  switch ($str) {
      case 5:
      case '5':
          // ahhh, now it matches
          break;
      case 'foo':
          ...

with double cases which people would no doubt be hee'n and haw'n over to no end.

Here's one way to make switch behave the way you want:

<?php


$tmp = array(
         'foo' => 1,
         'bar' => 2,
         'zap',
);


foreach ($tmp as $key => $val) {
         switch (true) {
                 case $key === 'foo':
                 case $key === 'bar':
                         echo "[$key][$val]\n";
                         break;
         }
}
?>

Hi Mike,
   It kind of sounds like you are talking about two different things
or at least the confusion involves two different topics. Basically, if
you are going to use a Switch statement it's a good practice to keep
the case expression within quotation, if you want to get desired
results.

 Also, be very careful when doing ,
SWITCH($foo)
{
case  ' 5 ' :
case ' 6 ' :
    do execute some code...
break;
default:
break;
}

also 5 is an interger, but ' 5 ' is a string. So that will make a
difference when comparing it to $foo. Take a look at
http://us.php.net/intval for more details.


The above statement says if $foo equals 5 or 6 then execute some code.

Hi Mike,

Maybe a simple way around this is just to use:

switch("$key")

It makes it pretty clear that you are only dealing with strings, and
you won't have to deal with casting issues.

I second the EC2 recommendation, especially now that they have added
persistent storage.

Be prepared for a short learning curve as you get to know the
ins-and-outs of building your own images. You will definitely want to
experiment a bit to get a feel for the service and then plan out a
local administration and monitoring infrastructure before going full
steam ahead.

As far as I know, there is still a waiting list to RSVP.

So if you wanted to attend, you would have to RSVP to get on the waiting
list, and then see if you can get in.

This is the 5th DrupalCamp and they have tended to fill up well in advance,
even with Brooklyn Polytechnic having a decent capacity.

Just for the record, DrupalCamp is not married to PolyTech, and in the
planning stages is always looking for a place to hold it, so if anyone has
any ideas for future places with greater capacity, let us know!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Windows, Apache, SSL & Zend (Https Error)
Message-ID: <48CAB8B5.50902@projectskyline.com>

Hello,

Someone else at my work is digging into this problem in more detail, but 
I know this list is a great resource and I had to post:

We are running PHP5/Zend on Windows/Apache and getting this error when a 
HTTPS URI is passed into Zend_Http_Client().

/Unable to Connect to ssl://[redacted]. Error #192541028: Unable to find 
the socket transport "ssl" - did you forget to enable it when you 
configured PHP?/

Does anyone have experiance solving this problem, or can point me to a 
site that has a comprehensive solution.
I'm guessing fsock* and family is dying . We could get around this by 
using curl_* family, but I'd rather use the Zend_Http_Client() {socket} 
class.

Thanks,

- Ben

Hello,

I'm pretty sure this is a .dll defined in php.ini and loaded by apache. 
Do you mean a windows service?

Care to elaborate?

Of the many books on Google's advertising tools, such as AdSense and
AdWords, has anyone had a chance to read or 

review one or two of them? Have you found one book/manual/online
tutorials to be pithy, to the point and noteworthy? 

Would you recommend one to me/us?

Interesting and subtle code.
IMHO, the best solution is to make sure every hash
item has a key/value pair when the hash is created.
Someone may have to work with the code in the future
and if the hash creation is done in some required/included
file like a class, it might be more time consuming to determine
what was happening.

Hello,
you could use json_encode() to encode your array in php to the json format
and then print it out from php inside the html, then decode the array using
js's json functions.
But as long as you do that you could print it straightforward, just write
from php the "html" code that defines the array in js.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Overwriting Cache Headers
Message-ID: <78c6bd860809132041r4726ce1co63ca5fbc291b4003@mail.gmail.com>

I want to send css and js files from a PHP script so I want to allow caching.

But PHP always sends the following headers:

Array
(
    [0] => X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.6
    [1] => Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
    [2] => Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate,
post-check=0, pre-check=0
    [3] => Pragma: no-cache
)

AFAIK it's not possible to remove or suppress headers but I can of
course overwrite them.

The question is: with what?

For the Expires header I suppose it could just be the RFC822 time for
now + 1 hour.

For the Cache-Control header it's less clear. Here's the spec but I'm
still trying to decipher the meaning of each directive:

 http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9

For the Pragma header I'm largely clueless.

Does anyone know what values for these headers would be equivalent to
not specifying them at all?

Mike

Is there any particular reason you need PHP to send the files? You do
have a couple more options. I usually use PHP to write a static file,
then let Apache serve it up as an actual css/js file. You can even use
sweet mod_rewrite rules to hit the php file if the requested css/js
file isn't present. If you're just reading a file from disk and
spitting it out with PHP, you might want to have PHP send your
favorite flavor of redirect header instead.

As far as which headers to send, I poked around a bit. You'd be
surprised how many of the big guys just dump the css on every single
page... But a few that served actual files had headers like the
following. Note that all these css files are coming from a CDN. For
what that's worth.


Headers for an Amazon.com css file:

        Cache-Control: max-age=630720000
        Date: Sun, 14 Sep 2008 04:03:45 GMT
        Content-Type: text/css
        Last-Modified: Thu, 28 Aug 2008 00:32:03 GMT

Twitter seems to use a more reasonable cache length, you might try
something like this:

        Date: Sun, 14 Sep 2008 04:07:46 GMT
        Server: Apache
        Last-Modified: Fri, 12 Sep 2008 00:23:22 GMT

        Vary: Accept-Encoding
        Content-Encoding: gzip
        Content-Length: 6509
        Content-Type: text/css


I wasn't able to find a css file that returned a Pragma header.
Perhaps you could try "Pragma: " ?

Have you tried overwriting the header with the header() function,
either by making it blank ("Pragma:") or with the desired value?

Hi Tom,

That sort of works. What it does is actually send blank headers to the
client like:

   Cache-Control: \r\n
   Pragma: \r\n

But Firefox at least seems to handle this correctly.

[Note: Firebug does not show you what was received on the network. It
shows you what FF knows from the communication. This is actually good
IMO but if you want to know what was really sent out on the network
you'll want to double check with WireShark.]

Also, in the process of Googling this issue I read some forum posts
that claimed a blank header generated an error. But with at least PHP
5.2.6, calling header('Pragma:') doesn't seem to generate any errors
that I can see so far. Or perhaps the posts were just wrong (e.g.
actually a headers-already-sent problem).

Anyway, from playing around with this, I have finally settled on the
following to enable caching of PHP output on the client:

  header('Expires: ' . gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s ', time() + (60 * 60)) . 'GMT');
  header('Cache-Control:');
  header('Pragma:');

At least with Firefox it seems caching is largely controlled by the
Expires header. Note that I set the expiration for one hour. And I've
only tried this will application/x-javascript and text/css output with
Content-Disposition: filename=<filename>.

Mike

Michael,
    Firebug doesn't show you header information but the Web Developer
Toolkit for FireFox does. Once installed, just go to Information >
View Response Headers. Also, if you want to see what files are being
used during your ajax scripts or any header redirects,etc then
download FF's Live HTTP Headers plugin. Chrome's Inspect Element does
a pretty good job at this too, IMHO.

+1 for json... below is what you need to do:

<script type="text/javascript">
var menu1= eval( '(' + <?php echo json_encode($menulist); ?> ')' );
</script>

Whoops.... it's a bit late.  You don't even need to bother with the
eval stuff.  using eval becomes important when you are using the
xmlHTTPRequest.

just:
<script>
var menu1 = <?php echo json_encode($menulist); ?>;
</script>

While I'm not familiar with this much at all, I dug through minify and 
they have a number of headers set there, so you might want to see how 
they do it.  After all, their up to version 2, so they must have gone 
through the pain of headers already.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Building PECL Sources
Message-ID: <48D15515.9030107@projectskyline.com>

Hello,

I want to fix a bug (from '06) in the PECL PDO database adapter 
(http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/pecl/pdo_dblib/).

There is zero documentation for this project however - I've just 
contacted the lead dev and I'm awaiting a response.

I'm interested if anyone on the list has experience working w/the PECL C 
Sources - most importantly, what are you using to compile them
and what do you have to link them with at build time? Windows, OSX or 
Linux? GCC or VS?

Any feedback would be helpful.

Thanks,

- Ben

I'm on Linux, so gcc. Generally pecl install <extension name> just
works. I've run into errors at the configure stage a few times, but it
was relatively easy to figure out what was missing (or misplaced) and
fix it.

Windows is obviously a whole different ball of wax. Do people use
Cygwin for that or what?

You could always use the class:

YMMV, of course,

Yep, there is a way -- I've seen it done. But, I didn't do I myself 
and I don't have a reference for you. But, it IS possible.

If nothing else, you could go the Rube Goldberg route: script to open
movie in browser window, take screenshot of browser window, then
resize the resulting image and return the thumbnail.

For your sake, I hope there's a library (or maybe a 3rd party service
with an api) that just does it directly.

You can use http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/
great tool I used it but you need a ssh access to your box to compile 
the binary (I am using 1and1 and I compiled it without root privileges)

I used to use this script:

<?
$script_path = "/kunden/homepages/16/xxx/htdocs/ffmpeg";
$flv_path = "/kunden/homepages/16/xxx/htdocs/";
$jpg_path = "/kunden/homepages/16/xxx/htdocs/jpg/";
$filename = "test.flv";
$seconds = 10;
$image_name = "frame";

for ($i = 0; $i <= $seconds $i++) {
     $command = $script_path."/ffmpeg -i ".$flv_path."/".$filename.
		" -ss ".$i." -vframes 1 -f gif -pix_fmt rgb24".
		$jpg_path."/".$image_name."_".$i.".gif";
     echo $command."<BR>\n";
     exec($command);
}

echo "done\n\n";
?>

it will give you 10 frames (every 1 second) starting form the beginning 
of the movie
it worked great but I don't remember why I used .gif instead of .jpg :) 
maybe on 1and1 some jpeg library was missing

I just noticed that you want SWF -> JPG not FLV -> JPG
I read "flash movie" and assumed .flv

I am not sure if ffmpeg can do swf - check their docs

There is nothing for PHP.  Your best bet is to setup service running
on a desktop computer that can take screenshots.  You can set it up
with AppleScript+Safari or IE+VBScript.

Message-ID: <5458db3c0809190614j4bfd51f7w6d7ed399de84a22a@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

Can anyone recommend something to make code diagrams from PHP code. My
requirements are as follows:

1) Pretty looking but somewhat functional. I'm presenting code to
other programmers, but I'd like something to put in a powerpoint
slide.
2) I'd prefer if it generated bitmap (png, jpeg, gif tiff) images.
Again, I want this to go in a powerpoint presentation. Since I can
take screenshots this is not that big a requirement.
3) It has to handle non object code and smarty templates. Most of my
code is contained in classes, but I have a file of functions that are
not in a static class and I'd like to to diagram the scripts in the
webroot. I also don't want it to compile the smarty templates into PHP
and diagram them.
4) (Unrelated) Does anyone know of a tool for diagramming MS SQL
databases? Visio's "Reverse engineer database" is ok, Sql management
studio database diagrams are slightly better, but lack view support.
Neither will diagram stored procs or functions, even though Visio
claims it will. if anyone has a closed source tool that does this, I
have a small open source database (will be released with the app after
I give my presentation) and I can email you a small MDF or the sql
schema. if you can get me a schema diagram appropriately sized for a
powerpoint slide.

code is contained in classes, but I have a file of functions that are
not in a static class and I'd like to to diagram the scripts in the
webroot. I also don't want it to compile the smarty templates into PHP
and diagram them.
4) (Unrelated) Does anyone know of a tool for diagramming MS SQL
databases? Visio's "Reverse engineer database" is ok, Sql management
studio database diagrams are slightly better, but lack view support.
Neither will diagram stored procs or functions, even though Visio
claims it will. if anyone has a closed source tool that does this, I
have a small open source database (will be released with the app after
I give my presentation) and I can email you a small MDF or the sql
schema. if you can get me a schema diagram appropriately sized for a
powerpoint slide.

Using ffmpeg,
http://ffmpeg-php.sourceforge.net/
(you can also use the command line, but this is the utility all the 
youtube clone sites use)

ffmpeg supports swf, but how easily it can pull the video is a subject 
of discussion.

There are also various services, such as:
http://heywatch.com/page/home

Which have API's to convert video formats.  Most, IIRC also produce a 
thumbnail of the conversion, so you could use them if you don't want to 
muck with ffmpeg yourself[and ffmpeg can be a nightmare to muck with.  
It can also go very easily, so I would tend to say try it on your site 
and see what happens.]

At first I thought you were confusing swf and flv.

But then:

/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg -formats | grep swf
 DE swf             Flash format
 DEA    adpcm_swf

So it appears to be able to decode and encode in swf format. I have no
idea what this means in practice... can ffmpeg actually create a Flash
animation? But it would seem to mean that you could get a framegrab
from a swf in much the same way that you can from a flv.

Crazy. Wish I had time to try it.

I don't know, I've only used ffmpeg for 2 purposes:

1) To translate avi and windows media files for a website
 to flash.  Windows Media Files are a /pain/ to translate because you 
can have a perfectly playable windows media file but it has a bit of 
corruption which results in ffmpeg truncating the file.  What was worse 
was that everything worked fine and then stopped one day and the client 
insisted they didn't do anything differently.  After a week or so of 
investigating, they mentioned that they upgraded their software used to 
create the windows media file which resulted in it generating funky 
stuff at the end. [Hint: if your trying to troubleshoot a problem, the 
first thing to do is upload it to youtube and/or google video.  This at 
least tells you if it is possible to convert the file to flash, as if 
they can't do it, I refuse to spend my time on a fixed price contract 
tracking down every little variable and testing it.]

2) I fiddled with some shell scripts on my mythtv box at home to convert 
tv to flash video format suitable for playing on the wii[so I could 
record to my PC and than watch it over the wireless network on the TV 
using the WII]

In both cases, I was just converting, not creating from scratch.

Huh? Aren't you supposed to make those diagrams before you write code? This is 
how they teach it in school and so far I met only one developer who does that 
(isn't me). His code is flawless most of the time.

The only application I ever saw for this task is this one:
http://www.vista-files.org/programs/cad-kas-gbr/c-delphi-basic-code-2-flowchart.html
It will cost you, which is something you may not have planned on.

In case you are interested in something that requires less fiddling you can 
try the RivaVX encoder. Free to use and idiotproof (that's why I use it). It 
has two disadvantages, it runs only on Windoze and doesn't handle german 
Umlaute, unless they recently fixed that. One would guess they tested that 
since it is a german company....


Coming back to the original question. Does it need to be an automated process? 
How many videos would be need to be thumbnailed? If that is for adding a few 
dozen files once in a while making a quick screenshot is probably the easiest 
and quickest way, less kewl though.

Well there are tools for doing it either way at least in other
languages. There's a special visio/visual studio 2003 combination
where you can diagram your database/object model and your data center.
it generates your classes, method stubs, and database for you. Most of
that functionality still exists. For the reverse, in the land if .NET,
you can make code diagrams in Visual Studio out of your classes.

I do think the idea of drawing out your basic code and filling in the
functionality is beneficial, especially if there is some sort of ORM
tool involved so you draw your database schema and data access classes
simultaneously. I think a better approach is to write out your schema
in some sort of meta language. One place where this occurs is a
application called Andromeda.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/andro I
happen to have made a few commits with regards to windows
functionality to this app, but I've to write a real application with
it. The schema file will even generate your security model and basic
CRUD screens.

Now regardless of what should happen in real life when you want to get
real work done, I'm giving a presentation where I am demonstrating
specific language features and specific API's. This means I'm writing
code by hand, verbosely commenting it and looking to diagram it after
the fact. I even tell people not to use this code in my presentation.

I shall check it out, but the screenshot seems to be the opposite
level of verbosity as Donald's suggestion. Donalds suggestion tracked
files, this one tracks almost at the level of lines of code. Ideally,
I want a list of classes, function, and their parameter types, both
explicitly stated where php allows, and the rest infered from the
@param and @return tags in the php documentation blocks. Since that
probably doesn't exist I'll use Donald'd suggestion . That will also
force me to talk about the slide instead of repeating the slide.

I was thinking I could write a php function to open all of the files and
search for a specific string.

 

But, I'm guessing it's already been done with a better implementation.

You could probably use that however it would be a lot slower than the  
exec with grep.  Also it will depend on how many files you have in the  
site.  I guess you could try it and if you run into the issue of the  
script taking longer than allowed to execute just up the time with  
ini_set();

It's a fairly slow site.  I try the php get_file_contents, etc and if too
slow exec grep.

 

Thanks,

 

Michele

You could probably use that however it would be a lot slower than the exec
with grep.  Also it will depend on how many files you have in the site.  I
guess you could try it and if you run into the issue of the script taking
longer than allowed to execute just up the time with ini_set();

If you have SSH access you could use grep, if not write a php script that
will exec() the grep command.  This is providing the hosts security allows
for exec()

I was thinking I could write a php function to open all of the files and
search for a specific string.

 

But, I'm guessing it's already been done with a better implementation.

This is a really bad idea in general... Is there a reason Google's
site search won't work?

If you do something like exec(grep), make sure you know how to escape
everything properly.  It is possible someone could wreck the site with
a specially crafted query.

John,

 From my understanding this was not something she wanted for site  
users, I thought she was searching for a string.

If you are going to deploy this to users then you don't want to use  
either method we spoke about and use John's suggestion and use Google  
Site Search

Googles annual pricing for using their function is:

Number of web pages  Search Query Limit (annual)  Pricing (annual)  
Up to 5,000 250,000  $100  
5,001 - 50,000  250,000  $500  
50,001 - 100,000  500,000  $850  
100,001 - 300,000  500,000  $2,250  
> 300,000 > 500,000  Contact sales.

Is everyone in agreement?

I'm guessing I'm not going to cheaply or quickly write something as
sophisticated.

Michelle,

check the source for this site,
http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/04/crawling-through-html-forms.html

They have the google search and doubt they pay for it, it's a free  
method I believe

Yes and no.  Google does offer a free version... I think it is called
something like custom search.  The drawback to the free version is
that your content must already be in Google's index for it to work and
they will show ads along with the results.  The paid version has the
advantage that they will crawl your site even if the content doesn't
make the main search index.

Regards,
John

It's seeming custom search is doing an actual google search, whereas site
search searches the specified site?

I made good experience using swish-e. It is fairly easy to figure out and you 
can make some simple calls against the index and display the results the way 
you like. One nice thing about swish-e is that it indexes more than just flat 
files, but also PDFs.

Thank you for your input.

I went to google.  Basically you need an xml file and some html.  They
didn't break it down simply enough, but it was simply enough to figure out
with slightly little effort.

Swish-e is not breaking through clearly enough quick enough for me.  Can you
break down the general idea?

It's looking like perl calls.  Is this the case?

As far as I recall there are two ways. You can either execute an ad-hoc search 
and swish-e goes and digs through the files, or you can have it update a site 
index on a schedule and then execute searches against that index. I found it 
to be quite fast when I used it last and that was even by having swish-e 
create a temporary file (I think) that I then read in via PHP. The index works 
OK unless you have so many changes going on on your site that the reindexing 
would need to take place every minute and tie up resources.

The site where I used it on is still up and you can give it a try. Go to 
http://irsupport.net/search/search.htm and search for the word "lock". You get 
an excessive amount of hits and yet the page still loads quickly. I may have 
the code floating around somewhere, but would need to search for it. I did 
this years ago when I started with PHP and found it quite easy after figuring 
out the command line parameters for swish-e. That site runs on WAMPP.

Well, I did have a good idea where I might have a backup of that code and I 
did find it. See the attached archive. It contains the search entry page as 
well as the script that executes the search against the index and then 
generates the results. I only looked at the first few lines, but it should be 
well commented.

The documentation for how to create the index files is here: 
http://www.swish-e.org/docs/swish-run.html

Then, I would probably have to create a cron job to re-index the website
periodically?

I'm thinking the google custom search is much easier.

Thanks for the info though.

If I decide to be other-website-independent, I might do this.

If you want something permanent for your web site, this is the GNU 
successor to ht://Dig.

Otherwise, for shell searches I use this handy little perl script I've 
had for about 12 years.  It could be converted to a CGI script pretty 
easily (with appropriate security considerations).

#!/usr/bin/perl
# tgrep
# grep only text files (ignore binary files)
#
# Usage: tgrep [-l] pattern [files]

$nameonly = 0;

if ($ARGV[0] eq '-l') {
     $nameonly = 1;
     shift;
}

# Get pattern and protect the delimiter.
$pat = shift;
$pat =~ s/!/\\!/g;

&dodir("");

sub     dodir
{
     local($dir) = @_;
     local(@names);

Thank you.  That was what I was thinking, but google I'm sure parses out the
html tags, etc, etc.

I'm pushing google to the client.

I'm betting you, that their custom search is quite more complicated.

Yeah if Visio would display the column types and the signatures  the
stored procs and user defined types that would be perfect. Might be a
way to display all that. Visio stores all the schema details
internally and I think theres even a way to go from visio diagram to
database.

I think I should ask this questions on another list though.

Hello everyone,

For those of you in the Happuage area, I'd like to invite you to my
talk at the Long Island PHP user group on September 29th at 8pm. I
will be discussing the new MS Sql server driver for PHP. The talk will
center around a small example app I built. I will cover some of the
capabilities of SQL server, and dealing with SQL releated errors in
PHP.

There will be free food. RSVPing is not required, but I'd appreciate
it so we know how much food to get. You can RSVP to my email address
(zippy1981 at gmail.com).

Regards,

Justin Dearing

The difference between google custom search and site search is custom search
is free but also has ads and site search costs but it ad free.

It's seeming custom search is doing an actual google search, whereas site
search searches the specified site?

Yes and no.  Google does offer a free version... I think it is called
something like custom search.  The drawback to the free version is
that your content must already be in Google's index for it to work and
they will show ads along with the results.  The paid version has the
advantage that they will crawl your site even if the content doesn't
make the main search index.

Regards,
John

Ive decided to not mess with ffmpeg/screenshots/desktop computers. In the 
end I just told Flash to render the movie at a smaller size instead of 
making a thumbnail image (the resulting image is a little crappy but this 
is for a backend interface so it's OK).

Umbrello is a great modelling tool
http://uml.sourceforge.net/

But, I don't think it yet draws diagrams from PHP code.  (It will
create stub PHP classes based on UML)

I haven't used ArgoUML (or variants like Poseidon), but supposedly the
PHP plugin is intended to do round-trip PHP5 code to UML

The 3 images were created by hand in photoshop.

btn_shadow is the bottom and is only used for the final buttons
*uncolored* drop shadow. The solid black pill portion of that image
could be blank or white or anything in between, as it is covered up by
the btn_body image it sits beneath.

btn_body is the main image and a translucent image. The black areas
show as 100% of the color determined by the code, and the lightest
show through 100% of the background color. The interplay between these
two levels gives the button its shape and are determined by the
artist.

btn_highlight is an overlay that provides and *uncolored* highlight,
as any white in btn_body will reveal the background color.

Since I am (still) in college I decided to finally take a class on scripting in PHP. I have been using XAMPP for years. unfortunately for this class the professor I have likes PostgreSQL instead of MySQL. So now I need to install PostgreSQL on my PC (XP) and my laptop (Vista) for the class. unfortunately I have never been good at installing servers and DB (thus why I have XAMPP). I was hoping someone can guide me through installing it and getting it working with the XAMPP setup

XAMPP version 1.6.7 (on Laptop, Vista), Not 100% sure which version on PC, but I'm not home to check
PostgreSQL version Downloaded:8.3.4

Joey,

Postgresql is a very good database. Its got a featureset closer to
Oracle or MS SQL. But enough on database religion, and on to your
question.

If you downloaded the postgres MSI for windows.It basically just
works, and gives you  an OK gui as well as a command line utility.
Postgres should run as a service with no problems after installing the
MSI.

Then you should just be able to enable php_pgsql.dll in php.ini (its
already included in the ext folder in xampp)

I went with google search.

The search results are black font on a white background.  I don't know what
color the links are yet, because the site hasn't been indexed.

I don't think it's customizable, which fully means it was a lousy choice.

If it's not I'm going to advise my customer to cancel her account and I'll
use swish-e.

Sorry I am late to this thread, but Yahoo! has! a! webservice! for! search!

http://developer.yahoo.com/search/web/

no ads, no cost.

It's limited to something like 5000 queries a day, which shouldn't be a 
problem for small sites. You can limit the results to your site of course. It 
will even return the results as a serialized php array, which you can 
unserialize and then iterate over to display it however you want. Couldn't be 
much easier.

example:
http://www.copleysociety.org/

The disadvantage v/s your own local spider like SWISH-E is that you can't 
control it - a change to your site might take a week or more to show up in 
search results. Also you can't index things that are password protected.

[The disadvantage with SWISH-E is that it is completely useless as a search 
engine. The matching algorithm is primitive to say the least. It does however 
a good job of thrashing your server when it runs.]

There is of course no direct financial benefit to Yahoo! to doing this, I am 
not sure why they do. (If MSFT had bought them you can be sure this would be 
the kind of thing kicked to the curb immediately :)

I never said it wasn't a good DB. I just said it wasn't MySQL whichI had 
up and running for several years and was used to using

I got it installed and running. Thanks

I agree.

The second index of "a" would duplicate the index of "a" in the primary 
key.

So is the first column of a primary key always also an index? I
thought I read somewhere that the columns are concatenated together to
form one index?

Something else of interest that I have learned is that MySQL can only
use one index per SELECT. So unfortunately OR-ing all the joins is
actually quite slow. If I use UNIONs instead, the query is a LOT
faster.

Currently I am using the second case above. I'll make a point of
dropping the INDEX(a) in the next iteration of the code and see how
that affects performance.

I don't think they're actually concatenated.  The manual says:

   A multiple-column index can be _considered_ a sorted array
   containing values that are created by concatenating the values
   of the indexed columns.

Emphasis on "considered" is mine.  However MySQL stores it, the engine 
has the ability to utilize it.  More information (and the quote above) 
are from 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/multiple-column-indexes.html

It's all about what's available left-to-right.  MySQL can't - still AFAIK -
use parts of an index that are not sequential when using it left-to-right.
See:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-indexes.html

And use EXPLAIN a lot.

I'm looking for one of those websites that will show you screen shots of
your css in different browsers.

 

My work looks perfect from my end, but my client is saying there's an
alignment problem.

I have that at work, but use the bative browsers. The problem is really only 
with the different versions of IE as Microsoft always only allows to have one 
version installed. But there is a trick for that: DLL redirection. Get the 
tool from TredoSoft (http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE) and install that. It 
works quite well, just that the different IE versions crash even more often 
than they already do.
Firefox versions live happily next to each other when you install them into 
different directories. The same applies to Opera. I also have the latest 
Netscape version on the system (although that is no longer offered or 
supported, AOL has its own browser based on IE, but ironically recommends that 
Netscape users switch over to FF). Safari and Chrome round it off, which each 
display web pages differently although they use the same rendering engine 
(WebKit).

And that all will not do a thing as the user can use a local style sheet to 
override whatever your style sheet defined.

Cool. Thanks to the tip.  I'll try Multiple_IE cause I don't like virtual
pc, but I found one of the websites browsercam.  They was $50/month roughly
following the 24-hour free trial.

More website will be appreciated.

I think I'm starting to understand this.

So if I do:

  PRIMARY KEY (a, b),
  INDEX (b)

the PRIMARY KEY (a, b) index makes WHERE with a or a and b fast. The
INDEX(b) is used for a WHERE with only b.

I am not sure if they do mobile devices (i'm sure it would not be  
difficult) but www.browsershots.org is a free service that I have used  
in the past.

Looking at them now they are quick as they also support Google's new  
Chrome browser.

why spend $40/mo when other places have it free?

Yes - but be careful with the use of the term "fast" - it'll make MySQL "use
the index".  If you only have a handful of rows, though, a table scan will
be "faster" :)

And that said, the optimizer in MySQL isn't known for its, duh,
intelligence.  Sometimes you'll need to force an index to be used - thus,
always check things with EXPLAIN.

Waldman:

I use BrowserCam:

http://www.browsercam.com

It's too expensive for one, but many can join together to purchase 
access -- which is perfectly legal for this. I think my year's cost 
was around $40 US.

However, you have to find a group who is renewing their subscription 
to join. While one might think that css list would allow discussion 
of that, it's considered off-topic and not permitted. However, 
everyone once in a while someone slips.

My current group leader is: <jf at netdiver.net> -- you might inquire 
there to see if a position is open -- our group's period started 
5/12/08.

Good luck in finding a group.

Cheers,

tedd

Hi,

Can anybody help?? I have run into a major problem, I do not understand how 
shopping carts work. I have tried asking technical support of the likes of 
PayPal, while they are all very knowledgeable businesswise, they are not PHP 
developers. I was told that I should check my email periodically.

As a shopping cart newbie using PHP, I am lost. I understand it is develop 
myself or much the easiest and best way is to use a shopping cart, which I 
agree with.

>From a merchant's point of view, here is what I want. Once payment has been 
made and confirmed, I want a token confirming payment (payment info) to be 
sent to my site and then, without manual intervention, I want to dispatch a 
confirmation email to the customer an invoice and then the goods/services to 
the customer.

Is there a way of  automatically polling for this info?? Is there a better 
of doing things??

Cheers

Paul

Paul,

It seems like what you would want is a payment gateway, which would process
the payment immediately.  From there I would recommend using an Observer OOP
pattern to attach events to the payment transaction.

Paul,

Are you writing a shopping cart from scatch.

I don't think this is the easiest way to implement a shopping cart.

There are two open source shopping carts that I know about, oscommerce and
zencart.  Plus, there are many inexpensive shopping carts.

Zencart handles the payment notifications.  If you use a non supported or
merchant that doesn't have a plugin available, you have to write some of the
gateway yourself, but all of the email notifications come canned.

As far as the payment gateway.  If I'm correct, via curl or whatever you
sent connect to the merchant and request a payment, they return a success or
non success value, after which you can send an email.

You get the response right away, so I don't know why you want to poll.

Here's so snippets of code:

	  $QBMS_XML_Credit_Card_Charge = '<?xml version="1.0"?>
	                                <?qbmsxml version="2.0"?>
	
<QBMSXML>
	
<SignonMsgsRq>'.$QBMS_Auth.'
	
</SignonMsgsRq>
	
<QBMSXMLMsgsRq>
	
<CustomerCreditCardChargeRq>
	
<TransRequestID>'.$QBMS_TransRequestID.'</TransRequestID>
	
<CreditCardNumber>'.$_POST['CreditCardNumber'].'</CreditCardNumber>
	
<ExpirationMonth>'.$_POST['ExpirationMonth'].'</ExpirationMonth>
	
<ExpirationYear>'.$_POST['ExpirationYear'].'</ExpirationYear>
	
<IsECommerce>true</IsECommerce>
	
<Amount>'.$_POST['Amount'].'</Amount>
	
<NameOnCard>'.$_POST['CreditCardOwner'].'</NameOnCard>
	
<CreditCardAddress>'.$_POST['CreditCardAddress'].'</CreditCardAddress>
	
<CreditCardPostalCode>'.$_POST['CreditCardPostalCode'].'</CreditCardPostalCo
de>
	
<CardSecurityCode>'.$_POST['CardSecurityCode'].'</CardSecurityCode>
	
</CustomerCreditCardChargeRq>
	
</QBMSXMLMsgsRq>
	
</QBMSXML>';
   $QBMS_chargeRq = $this->qbms_call($QBMS_ApplicationPath,
$QBMS_XML_Credit_Card_Charge, MODULE_PAYMENT_QBMS_SSL_CERT);

	// Get the statusCode
   $QBMS_ChargeRq_Status = 1;
   $posLeft  = strpos($QBMS_chargeRq, "<CustomerCreditCardChargeRs
statusCode=\"")+strlen("<CustomerCreditCardChargeRs statusCode=\"");
   $posRight = strpos($QBMS_chargeRq, "\"", $posLeft+1);
   $QBMS_ChargeRq_Status = intval(substr($QBMS_chargeRq, $posLeft,
$posRight-$posLeft));

	// QBMS will return statusCode="0" or "10100" if charge was
successful
	switch ($QBMS_ChargeRq_Status)
    {
	  case 0:
	  case 10100:
		$this->qbms_charge_success($QBMS_chargeRq);

Hi,

Can anybody help?? I have run into a major problem, I do not understand how 
shopping carts work. I have tried asking technical support of the likes of 
PayPal, while they are all very knowledgeable businesswise, they are not PHP

developers. I was told that I should check my email periodically.

As a shopping cart newbie using PHP, I am lost. I understand it is develop 
myself or much the easiest and best way is to use a shopping cart, which I 
agree with.

>From a merchant's point of view, here is what I want. Once payment has been

made and confirmed, I want a token confirming payment (payment info) to be 
sent to my site and then, without manual intervention, I want to dispatch a 
confirmation email to the customer an invoice and then the goods/services to

the customer.

Is there a way of  automatically polling for this info?? Is there a better 
of doing things??

Cheers

Paul

Hi all,

I'm starting a browsercam group.

I add people to the account and we split the cost of browsercam.

Browsercam shows you your website, in up to over 200 browsers.

An absolute must for a web developer.

I will limit the group to 10 people.

I have the basic capture plan.  Membership would be $48/year.

Join me in the agony and triumph of seeing your creations in ways you never
expected.

Dude!  :-)  I live in CA too long.

 

Browsershots only processes every 30 minutes.

 

You can't make changes and check the changes right away.  I can't work under
those constraints.

 

I will still use browsershots, but after I'm finished.

 

I paid browsershots the $15 to upgrade my priority processing, but I didn't
know that meant they'd only process me still every 30 minutes.

 

That $15 bought my results being processed 1 minute faster.  Woohoo!

 

Michele

HAHA I didn't even know they offered faster processing ;)

I also did not realize it took 30 minutes they must have changed that  
because I remember it being almost instant no more than 5 minutes for  
about 20 different browsers.

I think they have just grown beyond the number of machines they have  
which is why the queue is so large.

Sorry it has been a while since I used the service :)
