<PRE>I found this article also a waste of bandwidth. What is even more sad than the 
contents (or the lack thereof) is that the writer couldn't answer the question 
he put out. I started learning Java and got reminded at my dreadful 
experiences with C. Java inherited all the crappy, annoying stuff from C and 
managed to make it even more complicated. PHP is much easier to use and 
understand. There is often a function for pretty much anything and adding a 
library is as easy as removing a semicolon or dropping a file where all the 
others are and adding a line to the ini file.
I started programming on the C64 with BASIC, then learned Logo, then did a bit 
assembler on the 64. Later I did Pascal on the Apple IIe (in high school), 
then did MS-BASIC, then looked at the early stages of Delphi, and did ANSI C 
as well as Assembler on the 8088 at the university. Later I was forced to find 
my way through ObjectPAL after the only developer who knew it quit, then tried 
my luck with VB6 and VB.NET, and took a stab at Java. During all these times I 
loathed programming with every fiber of my being. It was always dumb, 
cumbersome, complicated, difficult to understand, or did not have enough 
features or didn't give access to other resources. I absolutely hate programming.
Then came a course on E-business during my MS degree and I decided to program 
a web app as project. I found PHP and since then I am in constant awe as how 
easy and powerful application development can be. PHP is easy, it offers a 
lot, it just works, and it doesn't drive one nuts with this compiling and 
linking crap like C, doesn't require to write 50 lines of code first to get 
&quot;Hello World&quot; on screen as it is with Java, and doesn't cost hundreds of bucks 
like VS. Back then I was impressed by Delphi, but today I think the GUIs of 
Delphi apps suck and Delphi is becoming irrelevant quickly. Oh, and none can 
really be used easily for web development - unlike PHP.

The kids that pick PHP aren't just cool, they are above all damn smart. Java 
is the language of choice for masochists.
