Well, you could take some self-defense classes in addition to all your PHP
studies and carry some weapon such as one of those pepper spray things....
oops, getting OT.

Seriously, though:  welcome to the party. You will like it here, and I am in
solidarity with your situation, as I'm a sort of self-taught,
humanities-trained part-time hobbyist lightweight who aspires to do it
better than a part-time hobbyist lightweight... Things I've found helpful:

* Take a course from a good instructor, the programming language hardly
matters. I studied Java to no good practical professional purpose, but the
discipline and problem-solving practice was great for my programming
generally.

* Read those books and tutorials, but keep a skeptical mind. Times have
since changed for the better, but I learned some sloppy habits back in the
days of PHP3 because I trusted what I read.

* Learn to use Subversion, even if only so you will have a backup and so you
can roll back whenever you make a really terrible mess.

* Smarty is not a panacea nor a substitute for discipline. I used to be a
Smarty believer, now I'm more of a Zend Framework believer. (Yes they aren't
mutually exclusive, but we digress...)

* Don't get too obsessed with planning planning planning at the expense of
doing. I have been in that trap and have only recently recovered. (My
problem has been working 100% alone and lacking of a tech-savvy boss or
demanding customer to bust my chops, so I have had the luxury of saying &quot;i
don't like it, this isn't good&quot; and wiping out a project and starting over
four or five times.)

* Validate input, filter output (-:  !
