Well, is it the same website and it gets reported wrong or is it from a 
different site and the error message is correct? As far as I know you can view 
the certificate information. Firefox has a function where you can see all the 
certificates and their parameters. It also allows for deleting a certificate. 
Maybe IE7 has an old one on file and comparing it to the newly issued one it 
doesn't match. Then again, crapware like IE should be simply ignored.
