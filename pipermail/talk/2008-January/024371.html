<PRE>Jeez, whats up with all the Java hating today?  First, LUG, now PHP list.
This article is a useless rant and indeed a waste of bandwidth, but the
constant Java sux in this and PHP rules in that conversation is a lot more
annoying simply because it is an irrelevant flame war.

This is a PHP list, lets stick to it.

Felix.

&gt;<i> I found this article also a waste of bandwidth. What is even more sad than
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> contents (or the lack thereof) is that the writer couldn't answer the
</I>&gt;<i> question
</I>&gt;<i> he put out. I started learning Java and got reminded at my dreadful
</I>&gt;<i> experiences with C. Java inherited all the crappy, annoying stuff from C
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> managed to make it even more complicated. PHP is much easier to use and
</I>&gt;<i> understand. There is often a function for pretty much anything and adding
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> library is as easy as removing a semicolon or dropping a file where all
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> others are and adding a line to the ini file.
</I>&gt;<i> I started programming on the C64 with BASIC, then learned Logo, then did a
</I>&gt;<i> bit
</I>&gt;<i> assembler on the 64. Later I did Pascal on the Apple IIe (in high school),
</I>&gt;<i> then did MS-BASIC, then looked at the early stages of Delphi, and did ANSI
</I>&gt;<i> C
</I>&gt;<i> as well as Assembler on the 8088 at the university. Later I was forced to
</I>&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;<i> my way through ObjectPAL after the only developer who knew it quit, then
</I>&gt;<i> tried
</I>&gt;<i> my luck with VB6 and VB.NET, and took a stab at Java. During all these
</I>&gt;<i> times I
</I>&gt;<i> loathed programming with every fiber of my being. It was always dumb,
</I>&gt;<i> cumbersome, complicated, difficult to understand, or did not have enough
</I>&gt;<i> features or didn't give access to other resources. I absolutely hate
</I>&gt;<i> programming.
</I>&gt;<i> Then came a course on E-business during my MS degree and I decided to
</I>&gt;<i> program
</I>&gt;<i> a web app as project. I found PHP and since then I am in constant awe as
</I>&gt;<i> how
</I>&gt;<i> easy and powerful application development can be. PHP is easy, it offers a
</I>&gt;<i> lot, it just works, and it doesn't drive one nuts with this compiling and
</I>&gt;<i> linking crap like C, doesn't require to write 50 lines of code first to
</I>&gt;<i> get
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hello World&quot; on screen as it is with Java, and doesn't cost hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> bucks
</I>&gt;<i> like VS. Back then I was impressed by Delphi, but today I think the GUIs
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> Delphi apps suck and Delphi is becoming irrelevant quickly. Oh, and none
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> really be used easily for web development - unlike PHP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The kids that pick PHP aren't just cool, they are above all damn smart.
</I>&gt;<i> Java
</I>&gt;<i> is the language of choice for masochists.
