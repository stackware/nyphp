<PRE>Hi!

I wrote two small PHP functions that allow for easily adding context sensitive 
help (CSH) calls to MadCap Flare's WebHelp (and potentially others). I am a 
MadCap MVP and plan on cross-publishing the code on NYPHP-Talk (this list) as 
well as in the MadCap Flare Forum. Now that I am about to put the finishing 
touches on it by completing a wrapper function that makes CSH calls easier 
(only need to specify an ID to make the call later on) I wondered under which 
license (if any) I should release the code. None if it is anything special, 
there are maybe 50 lines of code if that, but it is the first code that I 
think is good enough to get published and really has some benefit for the 
general (Flare using) public. Here are some things that I want to get out of 
the licensing:
- get credited (have my name mentioned in code) when the functions are used, 
the same way as I credited NYPHP for helping me out with the JavaScript stuff 
a few weeks ago
- mandate that any changes or improvements are sent to me, but not for the 
sake of approval, but for making my own code better (If I like the change or 
enhancement) and potentially communicate with users when I make changes
- prohibit commercial use without my written consent, meaning that I am not 
against a company using it in their web app, but I want to know about it and 
most likely get into agreement on special terms such as not getting sued for 
the case that my few lines of code don't work under some circumstances that I 
never encountered. The special terms aren't meant to get compensation (I won't 
complain about getting something, but I doubt anyone would pay for it).

And that is pretty much it. Now, I could just create my own license and call 
it a day, but I think there are already wayyyyyyyyyyy toooooo maaaannnyyyy 
open source licenses that I really don't think that I have to add yet another 
one. I first thought about GPL 2.0 or 3.0, but honestly, I haven't read that 
license and I have no idea if it does what I want. So, again, I turn to NYPHP 
and ask for advice. I know that you will start your replies with &quot;IANAL...&quot;, 
but some of you published code before or contribute to projects or may have a 
way better understanding of licensing than I have.
I plan to use that license then later on for my gettext alternative (which may 
come in handy for those who can't just restart a web server to update string 
files) and then again later on for my PiViViewer that I am working on now for 
three years (I use the tortoise development method, hehe).

Any proposal is greatly appreciated.

David
