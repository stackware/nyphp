Namespaces are supposed to be analogous to folders in the file system.
 Folders are how we prevent file name collisions, and namespaces are how
we prevent function/classname collisions.  If you have a bunch of files
that might have the same names as an existing file, then you just create
a new folder.  If you are importing code that may have function/class
collision, then you import it into a different namespace.  Unfortunately
I think the php devs don't think of namespaces in the same way, and it
looks like the 5.3 namespace implementation will lack the ability to
rename the namespace and relies on everyone using a unique namespace.
The domain convention is okay, but I would much rather be able to do
something like:

include 'dkSuperClass.php' into namespace 'foo'

It looks like the php devs are going the Java route, which ain't great
because it relies on every library being changed which will never happen
for compatibility reasons.

I would much rather have a tool that lets me solve collisions today than
a tool that requires libraries to be rewritten and agreement on a naming
convention in order for it to work.

&lt;/rant&gt;

The validity of one of my coding practices that I've used for awhile has
recently come under question. I've tried to listen to arguments on both
sides, and there seems to be good points on both ends, but my question
still hasn't been answered to my satisfaction.

When I'm writing a function that returns a Boolean that indicates that
the given process failed or succeeded, I declare the Boolean as a
variable at the top of the function. I feel that this makes the code
easier to read whenever/if-ever I need to come back and add further
logic conditions to that function. When I come back to the function, I
have a short list of accept by exception where I more-or-less just need
to find the point that I return true to understand the function. Verse
inline returns, such as &quot;if ($condition !== true) return false;&quot; that
builds a list of failure by exception. It may just be in my head that
the first method is easier to read, but that's why I'm asking for
input/options. Here are two examples.
They should both return the same value, but by different means. Please
don't be side-track by the over-all quality of code/lack-thereof.
Thanks!


public function checkForSomething($record_id) {
    $result = false;

    $yourObj = new SomeObject;

    $result = $yourObj-&gt;loadObjectByRecordId($record_id);
    if ($result === true) {as
        $restrictedItems = $yourObj-&gt;getUnrestictedItems();

        if (is_array($restrictedItems)) {
            $result =
$yourObj-&gt;updateUnrestrictedItems(self::ObjectItemStatus);

            if ($result === true) {
                $this-&gt;setRecordStatusId($yourObj-&gt;getRecordStatusId());
                $this-&gt;setRestrictedItemList($restrictedItems);
                $result = true;
            }
        } else {
            $result = false;
        }
    }
}


public function checkForSomething($record_id) {
    $yourObj = new SomeObject;

    if ($yourObj-&gt;loadObjectByRecordId($record_id) !== true) {
        return false;
    }

    if (!is_array($restrictedItems = $yourObj-&gt;getUnrestrictedItems()))
{
        return false;
    }

    if ($yourObj-&gt;updateUnrestrictedItems(self::ObjectItemStatus) !==
true) {
        return false;
    }

    $this-&gt;setRecordStatusId($yourObj-&gt;getRecordStatusId());
    $this-&gt;setRestrictedItemList($restrictedItems);
    return true;
}

Once again, this is pseudo-code...

I use version 1 (can it be that you forgot to return $result at the
end?) where I declare anything that is used in the function at the top,
including booleans. I then do whatever I want/need to do in that
function and set the flag accordingly and then return the result at the
very end of the function
  I see the benefits of the second version as there is a direct return
of the state and it saves a variable. Without having it tried out any
other way, I find version 1 to be easier to debug. In v1 you can
evaluate $result before retruning it, can't do that with v2. V2 is
potentially faster as it doesn't have to go through who knows how many
lines of code first before it reaches the return at the end. As soon as
a return is hit in the function the function exits and sends back the
return values.

I'd develop using v1 and then see later if optimizing using v2 makes
sense. It would be interesting to know the pros and cons for either
version that you have heard so far.

That's part of the reason I'm asking here, as the replies I've received
weren't that informative. I've heard that method #1 is a left-over
practice from C/Java programmers, and isn't necessary with PHP (??).
I've also heard the argument that returning inline values is faster, and
easier to see exactly what is being returned. That pretty much sums up
what I've heard so-far.

Hello,

Word, I immediately feel version 2 is easier to understand. Yeah you
can't check the result, but you could step through with a debugger and
then check the *result*

$result just adds extra complexity; no need to copy the value and then
return it. Just return it at the first point you can return it.
In something more complex, maybe having 50 places you could exit that
function, in that case, save the result and do a  return $result; at the
bottom. That's fine, and makes sense.

I can't comment on speed but I'd guess both these methods run pretty
close to the same speed.
I would never waste time optimizing something like this (unless I knew
it was causing a bottleneck).

Hi Tod,

I don't think it matters that much. I would rather spend time thinking
about the overall design. Just pick one technique that makes you happy
and stick to it.

This is how I would write it:

public function checkForSomething($record_id) {
    $yourObj = new SomeObject;

    if ($yourObj-&gt;loadObjectByRecordId($record_id)) {
        if (is_array($restrictedItems =
$yourObj-&gt;getUnrestrictedItems())) {
            if
($yourObj-&gt;updateUnrestrictedItems(self::ObjectItemStatus)) {
                $this-&gt;setRecordStatusId($yourObj-&gt;getRecordStatusId());
                $this-&gt;setRestrictedItemList($restrictedItems);
