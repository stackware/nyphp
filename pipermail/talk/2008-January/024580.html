You know, last year I got the opportunity to take over a custom built 
CMS that had been abandoned halfway through by the original programmer 
and that was a great (but harrowing) learning experience. I've also done 
a few login systems and have gotten pretty good with processing forms, 
but, you're right, I really should do more. I mean I should try 
something that I've never done before.

I already have a web site for my graphic &amp; web design work, but I've 
always wanted to create a secure area where clients can review their 
project assets and such, so maybe I'll do that. A blog and/or photo 
gallery could be interesting too. Calendars scare me. :)

Thanks for the feedback,
Bev
