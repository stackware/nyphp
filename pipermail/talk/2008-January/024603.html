Now that you mention it, my PHP Function Reference could be used as a 
pretty hefty club should I ever feel the need for self-defense...

Thanks for the welcome. I already like it here, and it's good to know 
that I'm not alone on several counts.

&gt;<i> * Take a course from a good instructor, the programming language hardly 
</I>&gt;<i> matters. I studied Java to no good practical professional purpose, but 
</I>&gt;<i> the discipline and problem-solving practice was great for my programming 
</I>&gt;<i> generally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Read those books and tutorials, but keep a skeptical mind. Times have 
</I>&gt;<i> since changed for the better, but I learned some sloppy habits back in 
</I>&gt;<i> the days of PHP3 because I trusted what I read.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Learn to use Subversion, even if only so you will have a backup and so 
</I>&gt;<i> you can roll back whenever you make a really terrible mess.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Smarty is not a panacea nor a substitute for discipline. I used to be 
</I>&gt;<i> a Smarty believer, now I'm more of a Zend Framework believer. (Yes they 
</I>&gt;<i> aren't mutually exclusive, but we digress...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Don't get too obsessed with planning planning planning at the expense 
</I>&gt;<i> of doing. I have been in that trap and have only recently recovered. (My 
</I>&gt;<i> problem has been working 100% alone and lacking of a tech-savvy boss or 
</I>&gt;<i> demanding customer to bust my chops, so I have had the luxury of saying 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;i don't like it, this isn't good&quot; and wiping out a project and starting 
</I>&gt;<i> over four or five times.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Validate input, filter output (-:  !
</I>
Solid advice, all of it. Thanks again!
