Thanks. I've visited the site before but not the forum--I'll definitely 
take a look.

I've got PHP installed on my primary computer and Apache/PHP/MySQL 
installed on a secondary one on my home network for testing purposes. 
The only problem I've run into is a situation where the server was 
running an old version of MySQL that caused a problem with importing 
tables. It was relatively easy to fix though.

&gt;&gt;<i> Please forgive the numerous questions, but I'm 40+ years old and want 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to approach this professionally, not just be some hack who writes 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sloppy code for for beer &amp; pizza money and doesn't care about the client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Questions are one of the best ways to learn. 
</I>
Indeed they are. It's good to know you guys are tolerant of them. I was 
a little intimidated by the level of experience &amp; knowledge I noticed 
here, but I figured as long as I asked reasonable questions no one would 
bite my head off. IOW not like some of the questions I often see in 
web-related forums like, &quot;hI gUyZ! I just got a copy of Dreamweaver and 
I wanna build my first web site. I want it to be like YouTube. Can u 
tell me how to do it? BTW, can u also tell me how to set up a site in 
Dreamweaver?&quot; Ummmm... to answer question #1, NO. To answer question #2, 
press F1.

&gt;<i> And don't worry about being older, I didn't start to learn PHP until 
</I>&gt;<i> I was almost 50 (47 or 48 to be almost exact).
</I>
Well I'm 45, so I guess there's hope for me yet. ;-)

Bev
