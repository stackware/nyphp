One time I was reviewing some C code which looked like it was
pretty awkwardly constructed.

I asked the guy who wrote it why he did it that way.

He told me that it was because the way the emitter (of the particular c 
compiler we were using) worked -- and he was right his way saved
some cycles.

It seems like there is always some trade off when you optimize
something.

It was like we had introduced a 'mental speed bump' in the
code. It had a pretty high WTF-factor, which whenever anyone
saw it for the first time they wanted an explanation.
That is, they didn't 'appreciate' it -- at least not at first.

(And, the people involved were not generally considered to be 'slow')
