<PRE>I guess that's the difference between full-time employees at good
companies vs. bad ones: I've told the CEO his idea was stupid before and
after he got over the shock we had a discussion about why and moved on
with it.  At a lot of companies it would've gotten me fired (and I
wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone else, but I was having a bad
day and he was being insistent), but that's why I'm not working at those
companies.

There are always politics and always gotchas, but I wouldn't work at any
company where I wouldn't feel comfortable being honest (censoring myself
to avoid insulting people is fine - i.e. &quot;I don't agree with that idea&quot;
vs. &quot;That idea is stupid&quot;, but censoring myself to support bad ideas is
not).  I expect the people that report into me to tell me when I'm
screwing something up, and I expect my bosses to be able to take it when
I tell them the same.

</I>&gt;<i> I have found that FT employees ALWAYS have to get involved in office
</I>&gt;<i> politics, worry about doing what the boss wants them to do, and toe
</I>&gt;<i> the line.  Contractors can say the direction this is going is all
</I>&gt;<i> wrong - you can be much more independent, that's why they are worth a
</I>&gt;<i> BIG premium, they they don't lose their edge, don't have to please
</I>&gt;<i> everyone, and don't have to worry about not getting invited to the
</I>&gt;<i> office picnic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or as I've said to the CEO (as a contractor): what you are doing here
</I>&gt;<i> is totally stupid, you have to change course.
</I>&gt;<i> CEO:  damn, you're right, NO one here ever told me that before. They
</I>&gt;<i> just yes me to death.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2 cents!  :-)  ed

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess a lot depends on whether you look at it as an 
</I>&gt;<i> employer or as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; employee.  From my perspective in terms of what I'd be 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to pay a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contractor, it's nowhere near 2.5x what I'd pay a full-time 
</I>&gt;<i> employee.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd pay them what I'd pay a full-time employee plus the savings in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; benefits, which is more like 120% instead of 250%.  If they're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially critical, maybe 150%.  I also prefer to hire 
</I>&gt;<i> full-time people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most of the time.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Money for vacation, sick and personal time - Consulting 
</I>&gt;<i> for yourself,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you don't work, you don't get paid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yup.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Retirement funds - Somebody has to pay me to golf 
</I>&gt;<i> everyday and travel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; after I'm 65 1/2 ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yup.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Medical and life insurance - This is the expensive part,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; without a bulk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; discount, insurance is like $2000 a month
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yup.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Business equipment/space/expenses - Somebody's got to pay 
</I>&gt;<i> the rent for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; your office space and equipment and related expenses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A lot of contractors work on-site, which eliminates these expenses.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Taxes - Uncle Sam wants his cut too, the figure varies but it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; somewhere between 25 - 30% of your pay...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Us full-timers pay taxes too.  :)  If not, I'd be on a 
</I>&gt;<i> yacht right now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of in the office.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Misc. Benefits - Enjoy that free coffee, gym membership, or other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; activities at the office? Now you get to spring for them...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True, with the caveat above.  (If a contractor's in our 
</I>&gt;<i> office, they can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of course partake of any of the free coffee or other 
</I>&gt;<i> similar benefits as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a full-timer.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In addition, you are essentially running a business now so to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; gather new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; business you have to pay for advertising, treating new 
</I>&gt;<i> and existing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; clients to lunch or dinner to promote new business, pay 
</I>&gt;<i> for your own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; training and certifications, and those trips to MacWorld, 
</I>&gt;<i> GeekCruise,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; etc...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yup.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All of those are reasons why I never understood why so many 
</I>&gt;<i> companies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hire so many contractors - if I had a choice between hiring 
</I>&gt;<i> someone for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a 6 month contract, or to be a full-time employee for 15 
</I>&gt;<i> months for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same rate, I'd hire them full-time in a second.  It makes 
</I>&gt;<i> no sense to me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to pay such a huge premium for the same thing.  (And someone's value
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goes up to me over time as they learn how the company works, how our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technology works, etc.  It can take weeks to get someone up 
</I>&gt;<i> to speed on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a new environment and practices, and it's a lot easier to eat that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;cost&quot; over the course of full-time employment than if you 
</I>&gt;<i> bring in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; short-term contractor.)
