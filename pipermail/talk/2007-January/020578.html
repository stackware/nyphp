</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In a similar case the contract caused my client to ask a lot of

Yes, I agree totally and that's the reason why I said that you should 
address those concerns in your agreement, in whatever form that may 
be.

Without exception, I always spell out what's important to me and try 
to explain in clear detail to the client as to what their rights and 
obligations are. I do this only for clarification and not for &quot;under 
threat of law suit&quot;.

You see, I spent over 20 years in continuous overlapping lawsuits -- 
while I made more money than I should have, it took it's toll and I 
never want to be in anther law suit in my life. You don't like doing 
business with me, or want your money back -- here it is. In fact, 
almost all my work is paid on approval. But, don't tell anyone that.
