I don't know, Rolan. If they desire to block people who haven't been 
referred by news.google.com and who don't know how to spoof the 
referrer,  then they have a pretty good solution in place. Everything's 
relative?

(I overheard a conversation in a restaurant about the Theory of 
Relativity. Grandma was with the grown up kids and overhears a mention 
of Einstein. So she says &quot;I never knew what the big deal was with 
Einstein and relativity. It seems pretty basic to me. If you look at 
something, it might seem small. But if you compare it to a pea it's big. 
So it's relative. I could have told you that. What makes Einstein so 
special?&quot;
