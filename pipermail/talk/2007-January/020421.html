<PRE>I'll reply to the HTTP auth question in a separate thread...

I'm aware of the Bakery, but thus far I've been unable to use it to find 
effectual answers to questions I've had about the project.

I realize you don't &quot;owe&quot; anyone anything, and I apologize that I 
perhaps implied that. I realize you're busy fellows and your life 
doesn't revolve around Cake.

(Additionally, I'm not complaining about IRC... I'm just saying that 
some sort of documentation should be the *first* place I should find 
help - IRC should be *last*. You'd probably agree with that yourself.)

That said, I've been using Cake for about a year now, I think, and it's 
by far the best php framework I've employed. Period. So kudos to you and 
the other two-and-a-half guys. :P My complaint was perhaps mistaken as a 
whine, but it's really just me venting frustration. I'm not blaming you, 
or any other participant in the Cake team.

&quot;Finally, it's true, we are keenly aware that our documentation could 
use a little more work...&quot;

Great, then we agree. :)

In the future, I will attempt to be more aware of areas that I may be 
able to contribute to the project.

</I>&gt;<i> You know, I get so sick of people ranting about Open Source projects as 
</I>&gt;<i> if the authors somehow owe them something.  We are three people, three 
</I>&gt;<i> and a half on a good day.  Some of us have social lives, and all of us 
</I>&gt;<i> have bills to pay.  Documentation is often a sore spot for OS projects, 
</I>&gt;<i> and ours certainly isn't perfect, but it is far better than it was, and 
</I>&gt;<i> far, far better than many other projects out there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, at this point it's pretty unfair to characterize our documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> as so scattershot.  If you bothered to look, you'd notice that the wiki 
</I>&gt;<i> has been shut down, and we've created a new community documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> system as <A HREF="http://bakery.cakephp.org/">http://bakery.cakephp.org/</A> which is filling out quite nicely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, and this one goes out to anyone else not paying attention, 
</I>&gt;<i> SecurityComponent::requireLogin() is part of CakePHP 1.2, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> currently in development status, and thus neither feature-complete nor 
</I>&gt;<i> fully debugged.  That particular method is undocumented due largely to 
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that *it's not done yet*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, it's true, we are keenly aware that our documentation could use 
</I>&gt;<i> a little more work, but that's part of why we're an Open Source 
</I>&gt;<i> project.  If you dig into a specific Cake feature, find there's no 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, and learn to use it anyway, here's a novel idea: HELP 
</I>&gt;<i> US.  John Anderson heads up the documentation team (of one), and can be 
</I>&gt;<i> reached at psychic at cakephp d0t org.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and this has to be a first.  I don't think I've ever actually heard 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone complain about the fact that we have an IRC channel offering live 
</I>&gt;<i> support, which one of the core developers of the framework is almost 
</I>&gt;<i> always on.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have any of you cake-users on the list tried to password protect a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single cake subdir (in my case, a plugin)? I got this working at one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point, but I can't figure out how I did it. I'm currently attempting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pull in the Security-&gt;requireLogin() param, but it's just redirecting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere else and not asking for authentication at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All I'm looking for is a simple password protect - the kind you'd use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a .htaccess file normally.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;rant&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By the way, this is my biggest complaint with Cake. Documentation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Relying on the &quot;shotgun documentation&quot;, leaving little bits and pieces
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here and there (wiki, google groups, irc) is killing me. The more time I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spend trying to figure out how do to something that should be relatively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple, the less beneficial it is for me to use Cake. It's a great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, but man, the documentation is horrendous.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/rant&gt;
