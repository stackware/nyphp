<PRE>There is an even harder part to this topic ... things that I have  
written have always stayed w/ the client and even when I was not  
freelance it was still really 'work for hire' ... *but* you can work  
yourself into a bind because some larger media companies (like a  
Viacom) will have really strict guidelines and when you spend say 2-3  
years working on backend CMS/Flash applications its hard to show your  
work when trying for another gig.  The real gem other companies seem  
to want to see is nice/clean &quot;reusable&quot; OO code, which is just that,  
&quot;reused&quot; from your previous experience.  Every developer has their  
own toolkit filled w/ libraries that do the job they are asked or  
they end up on PEAR, Zend, etc and reuse something else.  In open  
source I find it extremely hard to find things which another company  
can rightfully claim as the &quot;owner&quot;.

It's probably more of an advantage to ask a company what their  
license really is and if they don't have one, go to <A HREF="http://">http://</A> 
www.opensource.org/licenses/ and pick one or come up with one  
*before* starting so you know where you stand.

Good topic/discussion though.

</I>&gt;<i> some pretty big questions for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I am under contract to develop some custom code for a client,

</I>&gt;<i> only a brief, home-made copyright statement embedded in the source  
</I>&gt;<i> code after it was completed. Can something like that really  
</I>&gt;<i> determine ownership in a legal context?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own position on this as a freelance developer (never really  
</I>&gt;<i> discussed or documented in contracts), has been that any code I  
</I>&gt;<i> write, or open source code that I install for a client belongs to  
</I>&gt;<i> the client -- as long as I can reuse the same code that I write for  
</I>&gt;<i> other projects and clients. Thats a pretty loose position, but my  
</I>&gt;<i> relationship with clients has always been good and I haven't run  
</I>&gt;<i> into any trouble so far. Am I, or my clients as risk here somehow?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do the rest of you do? I'd be particularly interested in  
</I>&gt;<i> hearing from other freelance developers. Any good resources out  
</I>&gt;<i> there for learning about code ownership and licensing issues?
