<PRE>Quoting Dell Sala &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">dell at sala.ca</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> re: OSCommerce -- Customizing that software is probably the most  
</I>&gt;<i> unpleasant coding experience I've ever had. I still haven't found a  
</I>&gt;<i> package that supports nearly as many useful features out of the box.  
</I>&gt;<i> But the coding style is so crazy that I just don't trust it. Has  
</I>&gt;<i> anyone used ZenCart? My understanding is that it is a &quot;well  
</I>&gt;<i> maintained&quot; fork of OSC.
</I>
I just finished developing the same module for both osCommerce and  
ZenCart, and ZenCart is definitely a step up, but it's still pretty  
scary.

It does have a separate templates/ directory at least, as well as a  
couple of useful ways to drop in your own code without having to muck  
with the core code. So installation of a changeset ends up being quite  
a bit easier. If you do end up having to look at the core code,  
though, it's mostly just renamed from osCommerce.
