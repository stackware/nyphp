<PRE>Not so,

For the most part, recruiters make the market price higher across the
boards, and they provide services for the lazy interviewer (who could get
the positions theme selves, but always have an excuse for not wanting or
just not looking hard enough) It is not like its Euclidean Geometry or
something.
Recruiters provide a service. And the main goal is to make money, not by
return business, but by reputation. If that means you want or need more
money they will try and get you that. If they think you are priced out, they
will help broker your deal differently to GET YOU THE JOB!!! or at least an
offer, right?

but for the most part, what I have seen is; the true developer never has had
to worry about what the salary was. Especially in NYC. If you re good, you
will get what you want. And if you look, not even that hard, you can find a
job right now...

and the true definition of a headhunter - is to find a good head
(applicant/candidate) and market them because you think they are good and
place able. A recruiter, does just that, provides a service.

</I>&gt;<i> will work for the company to get them the most talent for the least
</I>&gt;<i> price.  This will ensure return business; even if they are paid a slice
</I>&gt;<i> of the salary as commission.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am of the belief that the head hunter works for themselves, not the
</I>&gt;<i> recruit.  They want to score a match so they get paid.  They may not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily be in our corner.  They are, after all, hunting heads.
