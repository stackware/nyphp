here? There are things you have control  &amp;gt; over and there are things that
you don't -- and, you don't have much  &amp;gt; control over the net. So, if
you're going to work on the net, then  &amp;gt; stop worrying about your code,
let clients do what they want (in most  &amp;gt; cases they don't know anyway),
and get on with your life. &amp;gt;  &amp;gt; Sure, you can (and should) address the
ownership aspect of your work  &amp;gt; product in your contracts, but realize
that it's nearly a moot point  &amp;gt; when it comes to enforceability. &amp;gt;
Tedd, overall well put, but I would add one more detail.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes its
not about enforceability but about expectations.&amp;nbsp; A contract, like a
lock, only keeps honest people honest.&amp;nbsp; But just as a lock says,
&amp;quot;you need permission to enter here&amp;quot;, a contract stating ownership
of code indicates to the customer what kind of relationship you expect.&amp;nbsp;
I can think of two cases where this came in very handy for me.&amp;nbsp; In one
case the client objected strongly to a clause in my contract, which hit to
the very base of how I worked.&amp;nbsp; Ultimately I had to let that one go, as
i figured he'd be an unprofitable customer.&amp;nbsp; But what if the contract
had not raised this point, we went forward, and then discovered how far apart
we were in expectations?In a similar case the contract caused my client to ask
a lot of detailed questions that gave us a better understanding of each
other's position, and we have worked well together.
