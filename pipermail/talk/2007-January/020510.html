To Mike, and all the other people who feel the need to complain,

GROW UP.  This is FREE, open source software.

Nate and all open source contributors give freely of their time and
expertise to help others.  If you're not happy with what they're giving
you FOR FREE, then you have 2 choices:

1. DON'T USE IT.  No-one is forcing you to use the software, so if you
don't like it then don't use it.

2. HELP OUT.  If you think that the project could be improved, then
knuckle down and get in there.  If you don't have the skills to help
out, there is no better time than now to learn.  If you're
non-technical, donations are welcomed by many projects, just because
open source software is provided to you for free it doesn't mean that it
doesn't cost anything.

You'll note that WHINE ABOUT IT is not one of the options.  It doesn't
do anyone any good, and this kind of feedback just makes those people
who are big hearted enough to actually CONTRIBUTE less likely to
continue doing it.

I am appalled that people would have such a lack of regard for the
efforts of good people like Nate that they feel the need to whine about
the 'level of support' for free software, or complain that it doesn't
work the way they expect, or that it's too hard to understand.

In short, put up or shut up.

Dan
