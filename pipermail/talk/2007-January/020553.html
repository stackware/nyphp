Rob, this is actually one of the more persuasive arguments I've heard 
for the DIV/CSS model.  You hear a lot of dogma about CSS, which has led 
me to this conclusion:

CSS is to HTML Tables as   Java is to PHP

In other words, one of them was designed by a committee of thought 
police, while the other lets me get my job done. 

Another argument I would have put against your reasoning is that I don't 
drastically change my layout, once its delivered to the customer, that's 
it.  However, your post led me to an Aha! moment, I do in fact change 
layout drastically a lot, during *development*.  Until it is finalized 
we are forever tweaking it.  This makes it worthwhile to experiment a 
little with CSS during layout of specialized data screens, I'll let you 
know how it turns out.


So what is the proper use of HTML Tables?  A form of INPUTs, with 
caption on the left and inputs on the right, are table anointed for this 
task, or Divs looking to do this one also?
