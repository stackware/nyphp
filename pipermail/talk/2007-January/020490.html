<PRE>In the LDAP system that I am working on, we have a deliverable in the
statement of work that says, &quot;Convert existing iPlanet access controls
to OpenLDAP access controls.&quot; I am sort of assuming that this refers
to Access Control Lists, but I am not 100% sure (I am flying solo on
this because the LDAP developer left the company and they have not
replaced him).

Not knowing anything about ACLs, I can only refer to my experience
with other PHP/MySQL applications that I have built, where we create
user groups and grant permissions based on the group the user is
assigned to.

&gt;<i>From what I have been able to gather during reading, it's not going to
</I>be as simple as taking the ACL from iPlanet and moving it over to
OpenLDAP (which is what I'm sure my bosses and the client probably
think).

I can see in the slapd.conf file that I have how the ACL is set up for
the root user that we have. But here is what I am looking for:

1. How do I setup permissions for a user when I first add them to the
system? When a person is added, they are assigned to an organization,
which is part of their DN. A user should be able to modify the data
for the organization they are assigned to, along with any child
organizations/records.

2. There is a object in the directory called &quot;ldapaccess.&quot; It has an
attribute called &quot;uniqueMember&quot; that contains a list of all of the
authorized users. When someone logs in, I can check their
username/password against the record where that is stored, but I don't
quite see how this ldapaccess thing comes into play.
