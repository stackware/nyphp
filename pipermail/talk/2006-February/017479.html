&gt;<i>hi all,

</I>&gt;<i>If you're running a search engine friendly URL mod for your bulletin

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you're using FURL with IPB, you MUST read this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Basically, I just found out that the URL mod I've been running on our

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is a more serious matter than Ohpir initially suggested, and I dug 
a bit deeper into it and wrote about it on ThreadWatch.org.

The code was distributed as a free mod for the forum software, and was 
advertised/promoted as a means of making a site more &quot;search engine 
friendly&quot;. In actuality, not only did it spam google by embedding 
backlinks onto your website, but it did so by cloaking the site by 
user-agent, so that search engine spiders were fed a different version 
of your website than regular visitors. Since cloaking is a blatant 
violation of the Google terms of service,  this mod that was advertised 
as a way to make your site more search engine friendly could actually 
get your site banned.

*** I repeat: it inserted cloaking by user-agent, which would get your 
site banned by Google if discovered.

Of course code that ads/modifies mod-rewrite rules is never trivial 
code, so it is likely that many PHP coders would accept the rewrite 
rules and associated code without line-by-line review. Had they looked 
very closey at the code, they would have found not only the backlinks 
and the cloaking by user-agent, but a disclosure statement from the 
author in the comments. He appended this code to the top of your pages 
(note the randomization of the anchor text.. nice touch!):

foreach( explode( &quot;\n&quot;, $this-&gt;ipsclass-&gt;vars['search_engine_bots'] ) as 
$bot )
{
list($ua, $n) = explode( &quot;=&quot;, $bot );
    if ( $ua and $n ){
        $this-&gt;bot_map[ strtolower($ua) ] = $n;
        $this-&gt;bot_safe[] = preg_quote( $ua, &quot;/&quot; );
    }
}
if ( preg_match( '/('.implode( '|', $this-&gt;bot_safe ) .')/i', 
$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], $match ) )
{
    print &quot;SEO Powered By FURL 3.1 By KiM (&lt;a 
href='<A HREF="http://www.alt-man.co.uk">http://www.alt-man.co.uk</A>'&gt;Alternative Manchester&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;;
    $url1 = 
array(&quot;<A HREF="http://www.authors-website.tld">http://www.authors-website.tld</A>&quot;,&quot;<A HREF="http://www.authors-website.tld">http://www.authors-website.tld</A>&quot;);
    $keywords1 = array(&quot;&quot;,&quot;Alternative 
Manchester&quot;,&quot;Manchester&quot;,&quot;Events&quot;,&quot;Local&quot;,&quot;Punk Rock&quot;,&quot;Music&quot;,&quot;Punk&quot;...);

    for($x;$x&lt;=2;$x++){
        $randurl = rand(0,1);
        $rand1 = rand(0, 30);
        $rand2 = rand(0, 30);
        $rand3 = rand(0, 30);
        $rand4 = rand(0, 30);
        $url = 
&quot;{$keywords1[$rand1]}-{$keywords1[$rand2]}-{$keywords1[$rand3]}-se.html&quot;;
        $this-&gt;ipsclass-&gt;skin['_wrapper'].= &quot; - {$keywords1[$rand4]} - 
&lt;a href='{$url1[$randurl]
}
/
{$url}'&gt;{$keywords1[$rand1]} {$keywords1[$rand2]} {$keywords1[$rand3]}&lt;/a&gt;&quot;;
}
}

This is a very good reminder of the dangers of adopting scripts. My 
original article on this is at <A HREF="http://www.threadwatch.org/node/5589">http://www.threadwatch.org/node/5589</A>
