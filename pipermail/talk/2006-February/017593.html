The best antidote for spam is, first and foremost, a good spam filter
on the email server. Maybe that's not the answer you're looking for,
but it is actually pretty hard to prevent scripts or dedicated humans
from POSTing to a public form on a website.

Aside from filtering messages on the email end, there are some things
you could try to make it harder to spam the form, or not worth the
effort:

1) remove the incentive. Why are people spamming your contact form?
What's in it for them? Do you post the submissions somewhere? Are the
owners a high-value spam target? Can a spammer craft a form submission
so that it gets sent to multiple recipients? Perhaps the form can be
changed to be less of a spam magnet.

2) require a valid HTTP_REFERER on form submission. This is easy for a
spammer to spoof, but they might decide not to bother. Only prevents
scripted abuse.

3) require the poster to decipher a captcha (words encoded as an
image, like Yahoo! uses on registration) Again, there are workarounds
for spammers, but would they bother?

4) Capture the IP address of the poster as part of the submission, and
use php or firewall to block the abusers. This only works if they're
not distributed.

I think a lot of people put up HTML contact forms a few years back
thinking that it would somehow protect them from spam, but it doesn't.
