Well, there is certainly some good that can come from publishing your 
work on other sites. In many ways, writing for other sites is part of a 
strategy to build your own reputation etc.

However, if you like to write content and the only problem you are 
having with your own site is a lack of audience (perhaps a lack of 
audience motivating you to write) that can be solved. In my opinion, you 
have alot more to gain by writing on your own site than by writing for 
the majority of the sites that would publish your content today.

As a developer you are well positioned to self-publish and garner an 
audience. In fact, after you do that you may find yourself being invited 
to write for some of the big sites.
