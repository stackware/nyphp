<PRE>Jumping at a low rate has a tendency to put you in a low pay bracket for any 
future work that may come out of it.  People start passing out your name as 
'the cheap guy' and that type of pigeon-holing is a trend that is difficult 
to change. 

That may be easy for me to say, since I am not at a loss for projects at the 
moment either.  I will say that it was necessary for me to cut some of the 
cheap ties lately and make contacts in bigger companies with bigger budgets 
and with a better understanding of quality work.
