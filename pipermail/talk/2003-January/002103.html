<PRE>A fine example. :-D

Recipe for success.
1. Read your books.
2. Get some experience.
3. Get more experience.
4. Charge a lot.
5. Blow everyone away.

Heh.

&gt;<i> A great story about the cost/value question.  I started my business almost
</I>2
&gt;<i> years ago.  I have 19 years in the business so knew that my experience
</I>&gt;<i> should allow for high rates, but my lack of name recognition as an
</I>&gt;<i> independent would work against me.  Rather than start my rates at the $90
</I>I
&gt;<i> felt I should be able to get, I started at $70.  I also factored my cost
</I>of
&gt;<i> living, extra cost for running the business, and an expectation of 20
</I>&gt;<i> billable hours per week and came up with $60 would be the minimum I would
</I>&gt;<i> need to live on if I obtained the 20 billable per week.  I had no bites.
</I>I
&gt;<i> finally had a great lead which would lead to the potential for much future
</I>&gt;<i> work, but they didn't want to pay over $50, this was with me stating the
</I>$70
&gt;<i> hr. rate.  Since the potential was great, we settled on $55 hr for the
</I>first
&gt;<i> project, each project thereafter would be a new negotiation with the
</I>&gt;<i> understanding that I would over time attempt to get the rate up to my $70.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well experience pays off, my next couple projects were at $60, then $65,
</I>now
&gt;<i> at $70.  On top of all that, they have lots of other projects ongoing with
</I>&gt;<i> other consultants.  They even have one project billing out at $10 an hour.
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't you know that many of their lowball projects have encountered
</I>many
&gt;<i> problems at delivery time with no end in sight as to when the problems
</I>would
&gt;<i> be corrected.  They have pulled me in to correct the problems fully
</I>&gt;<i> understanding that my corrections would take more time because I would
</I>need
&gt;<i> to familurize myself with what was done by the other programmer.  They now
</I>&gt;<i> rarely contract any real projects for the person willing to lowball
</I>because
&gt;<i> they finally understand the concept of getting what you pay for and don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to have to pay me to correct the problems caused by the low ballers.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Jumping at a low rate has a tendency to put you in a low pay bracket

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; future work that may come out of it.  People start passing out your
</I>name
&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 'the cheap guy' and that type of pigeon-holing is a trend that is
</I>&gt;<i> difficult
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to change.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That may be easy for me to say, since I am not at a loss for projects
</I>at
&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; moment either.  I will say that it was necessary for me to cut some of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; cheap ties lately and make contacts in bigger companies with bigger
</I>&gt;<i> budgets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and with a better understanding of quality work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, and when that time comes you can say, &quot;I'm sorry, but my rate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is no longer XXX an hour.  Because of the quality of my work, I'm very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; busy and my rate is UUU.  Since you're an old client, I'll only charge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you ZZZ.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XXX == cheap rate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ZZZ == exorbinant rate minus a little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UUU == exorbinant rate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If they don't want to pay you, then you can move onto your other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clients, and they will probably still have a good taste in their mouth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because you tried to accomodate them, and hopefully give you more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expensive work when they find it.  If they are willing to pay you, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great, you're only giving them a small discount for one project, and it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may lead to a continuing relationship at the rate you're currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; charging.
