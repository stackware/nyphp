<PRE>Sterling,

    I think that &quot;unprofessional&quot; was a bad word to have chosen, I believe
that the phrase I was looking for was &quot;the amount you charge is a direct
reflection of your working skill / ability.&quot;
    If you're hiring a big-shot that knows his/her stuff, doesn't screw
around, and write innovative, well commented and well thought-out code --
They're going to charge you for it. You will -not- find one of those people
charging $10/hr. You're going to find them charging you $90+/hr. It's common
sense in the business-world (and any other world you're living in) to charge
more for better services.
    If someone charges you $10/hr -- it's a job you want to turn down
(unless you're a beginner). If you know the people, and want to help them
out or be friendly, that's a -completely- different story. If it's a
professional relationship, and they are offering you an obscenely low
amount, I would deny it. It's almost insulting. If I were to take the job, I
would not give them everything that a client giving me $90+/hr would be
getting.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I charge around the same, I don't think &quot;unprofessional&quot; is the

</I>&gt;<i> experience, and someone offered me a job for $10, I'd jump.  Jobs lead
</I>&gt;<i> to experience and contacts, and you can always renegotiate for further
</I>&gt;<i> work. Professional or unprofessional, your rate is what you can get,
</I>&gt;<i> when the offers start pouring in, then you can charge at your liking.
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that said, I think the original poster should hold out for more.
</I>&gt;<i> $20 a hour is low.  State your advantages over a programmer that charges
</I>&gt;<i> $20.  But if you can't get them up, then you need to decide: do you have
</I>&gt;<i> a better offer?  Evaluate the opportunity cost and don't let pride get
</I>&gt;<i> in the way.
