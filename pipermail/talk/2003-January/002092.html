While I charge around the same, I don't think &quot;unprofessional&quot; is the
right word for charging less.  I'm as busy as I'd like to be at this
point (although I'll always consider new projects :-), so my rate works
for my experience and contacts.  But, if I needed work, given my current
experience, and someone offered me a job for $10, I'd jump.  Jobs lead
to experience and contacts, and you can always renegotiate for further
work. Professional or unprofessional, your rate is what you can get,
when the offers start pouring in, then you can charge at your liking.
:<i>-)

With that said, I think the original poster should hold out for more. 
$20 a hour is low.  State your advantages over a programmer that charges
$20.  But if you can't get them up, then you need to decide: do you have
a better offer?  Evaluate the opportunity cost and don't let pride get
in the way.
