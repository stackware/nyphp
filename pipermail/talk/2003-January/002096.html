Of course, and when that time comes you can say, &quot;I'm sorry, but my rate
is no longer XXX an hour.  Because of the quality of my work, I'm very
busy and my rate is UUU.  Since you're an old client, I'll only charge
you ZZZ.&quot;

XXX == cheap rate
ZZZ == exorbinant rate minus a little
UUU == exorbinant rate

If they don't want to pay you, then you can move onto your other
clients, and they will probably still have a good taste in their mouth
because you tried to accomodate them, and hopefully give you more
expensive work when they find it.  If they are willing to pay you, then
great, you're only giving them a small discount for one project, and it
may lead to a continuing relationship at the rate you're currently
charging.
