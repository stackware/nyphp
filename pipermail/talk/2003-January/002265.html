<PRE>Hans,

I'd love to help out with some volunteer work, but since the schedule is
during the week, I have classes (last semester before I graduate) to
attend to. If there is anything I can help with from here (Baltimore)
then I'd be glad to lend a hand. Otherwise, if the semester ends up with
me having free time on that week, then I will be up to volunteer to help
with any background work that needs to be done.

This email list has been great to me, and I hope to be able to help out
in the future.

- Erik Hummel
