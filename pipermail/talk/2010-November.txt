If you are using mysql on the backend, you can make your table UTF8, then your indexes would use utf8_general_ci collation by default. That collation basically strips out all accent marks on the data, then indexes it. So if you search for Dusseldorf or D?sseldorf, they will both come up with the same set of records. The you don't have to do anything on the PHP side.

I can't remember the federal agency that tracks names, but they have a phonetic system that is useful when you're doing genealogy research. Their system breaks the words down a bit and eliminates doubles, accented characters, and some other things as well, IIRC.

Wish I could remember the name of the place. Maybe the National Archives?

I'm having a hard time imagining a practical application of this, or
even how it could ever be a good idea. If there's a particular problem
you're trying to solve, maybe you need to reevaluate it, and find the
path to a simpler, more helpful solution, and I've seen members of
this list help with that hundreds of times.

export the entire database into a file
use PHP (or a good editor) to make the replacement line by line
drop the database
re-create it by importing the modified file

Feasible only if the db is not gigantic and you can afford to have it 
down momentarily

This is potentially very dangerous, because you can inadvertently
change column names, table names, etc.

The simplest way will be to loop through the tables in php (use SHOW 
TABLES), constructing & executing an UPDATE statement for each one like:

UPDATE table SET
   field1=REPLACE(field1,'from','to'),
   ...
   fieldN=REPLACE(fieldN,'from','to');

You can use DESCRIBE TABLE table; to get the list of fields, and to cut 
them down to only the fields containing text based on the field type.

I've had to do something similar.  Yes, use mysqldump.  Then use sed (if you're on a *nix machine).  Sed does search and replace by streaming the file rather than buffering the whole thing so it won't run out of memory no matter how big your dump is.  You can send the output to a new file.  Definitely test out importing it back in on a non-production machine.

This is a sane method. But you probably want to either:
1. Run on a schema-only dump and make sure it doesn't touch any columns or table DDL before you run it on a data dump
2. Make sure your search pattern matches things within a SQL quoted string.

Dan's solution of looping over tables and columns works well too. Mysql has  regex funcs you can use if necessary.

HTH.

I think the "-t" flag to mysqldump dumps just the data, and not the schema. this might be useful in ensuring that you don't accidentally change the schema with your sed.

Right, but the point of testing against the schema file is so that you 
ensure you're not matching table or column names - which will still be 
in a data-only dump.

Hi!

Blog (subject) or web forum (body)? For a forum use phpBB, can't think of 
anything else that is so comfortable, current, and easy to use. For a blog, 
never bothered with it. There are already way too many people blogging about 
things the world doesn't care about. No need for me to do the same.

Hello Michele,



There are three main CMS contenders out there each has its own pros and cons, massive fan base, tons of support and are all open source. A bit like PHP really.

In alphabetical order they are:

 

Drupal

Joomla

Wordpress

 

It is just a question of choosing the one you like best and feel most confortable with.



Cheers - Paul

Despite my post being autoplagiarism, use phpBB. And since it is written in 
PHP you can tweak it the way you want.

PunBB is another option -- possibly more lightweight and simple than phpBB which I think of as the big old flagship of php forums.

As Ajai mentioned, Vanilla looks really nice too -- probably the newest of the major options out there.

Hi all,

Just a question for those of you out there dealing with the F/OSS 
RDBMS's out there:

How many of you are using stored procedures (SPROCs) with any great 
regularity?

I know that in the commercial database world use of stored procedures is 
The Way Things Are Pretty Much Done, but I've not seen it in my brief 
forays through the bulk of PHP code I've examined (and needless to say, 
written). Am I just out of it? Is it just not considered usual practice, 
or am I blind?

In this I'm also including triggers and other stored functions, but not 
parametrized queries (they're something different yet).

I'll be happy to summarize (and anonymize) to the list.

Thanks!

I started in PHP/MySQL development before stored procedures were even
an option, and learned to make due without them. Obviously a heretical
approach, but when you know that the database is unlikely to be
accessed by anything other than your php code, it makes sense to keep
the logic in the application where it is easier to work with (and
subject to version control).

Personally, I think stored procedures are useful when you have DBAs in control of the database and critical business logic and they don't trust the developers interacting with the data.  Also useful if you have several different codebases acting on the data.  A lot of php code is done with the least common denominator in mind (i.e. somebody on a free shared hosting account), so it won't take advantage of the advanced tools available (non-default extensions, db features that require more recent versions of mysql [although most are probably on 5.0+ now], etc).

However, if you do essentially have one codebase doing all of your data manipulation and you don't have dedicated DBAs, I think using stored procedures doesn't really make sense because it's dividing up where your business logic is located and potentially making things more confusing or harder to debug.

I'll second this.  The problem i've always had in the past with sprocs is that it adds another layer of abstraction to the business logic and difficult to manage changes for.  I've always told my developers to move it out of the sprocs and into the code so we see what's going on and can manage changes in a code repository. 

The only time i've bit the bullet and moved logic into sprocs was when there was a mixed language environment.  Instead of duplicating logic, we put the logic in the database using sprocs so that both languages had access and logic didn't have to be duplicated.

     Most of the system I've worked on do not use sprocs,  or only use 
them in a minor way.  I have worked on two projects that were heavily 
sproc-based,  and it really wasn't that bad.

     We addressed the version control problem by using migration scripts 
that worked,  more or less,  like migrations in Ruby On Rails.  This 
gave us acceptable version control,  although of course we didn't get a 
complete change log from our VCS.  (It wouldn't be much effort to build 
some script that would help with this,  however)

     I've used sprocs quite a bit in MS SQL server to "add commands" to 
do things that are a pain to do in the SQL monitor,  for instance

http://gen5.info/q/2008/06/06/how-to-drop-a-primary-key-in-microsoft-sql-server/

---

     Note that a possible architecture for a db app is to have a 
class/source code file/folder that has all of your SQL statements in 
it,  wrapped up in functions.  An app built like this looks a lot like 
one that's based on stored procedures,  but has the advantage that it's 
all written in one language.  It's also easy to make a system like this 
compatible with different database systems by swapping out different 
versions of this class.  (Wrappers like this are also logical to put 
around real sprocs too...)

     Of course,  this architecture and the sproc-based architecture is 
incompatible with the popular ORM-based architecture,  which takes it's 
own approach to the database abstraction problem.

It also depends on how many systems access your database and perform more or 
less the same tasks. If you have a dozen systems accessing the same database 
then shifting business logic and tasks to the database server will make it 
work the same across all systems. That way you don't have to reinvent the 
wheel and keep it pumped up on every system.
Also, sprocs can help distributing processing load from the web server to the 
database server. Depending on how the systems are used that may be a benefit. 
Besides that, sprocs can be used by other apps that are not written in PHP 
whereas your PHP code cannot. Then again, why would anyone use something other 
than PHP....

For some reason I can't connect to the remote server with php but I can connect with mysql command line.
I think it must be some way I compiled php, tried just using rpms also.
Here is my configure statement

'./configure' '--with-mysql=/usr/' '--with-mysqli=/usr/bin/mysql_config' '--with-apxs2=/usr/sbin/apxs' '--with-zlib' '--enable-ftp'

Seems like it should work, works on a local mysql server.

Thanks
wil

I'm not sure it's your php compilation.  What about mysql permissions?  Can you connect via mysql command line running on your apache server to the mysql server?  Also want to make sure the port is open on the mysql server (usually 3306) and that the mysql server doesn't have "skip-networking" in it's my.cnf.  The permissions for mysql users includes the hostname that user is allowed to connect from.  If you want to open up the permissions for the user so they can connect from any server, you want to do something like this:

CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `dbname` . * TO 'username'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

The % wildcard allows the user to connect from any host.

Yeah I understand that.  I can connect from the apache server with

mysql -u root -h 192.168.199.31 -p

 

but the php connect fails with 

 

Warning: mysql_connect() [function.mysql-connect
<http://192.168.199.30/function.mysql-connect> ]: Can't connect to MySQL
server on '192.168.199.31' (13) in /var/www/html/order/test.php on line 2
Could not connect number2003 error Can't connect to MySQL server on
'192.168.199.31' (13)

 

Error 2003 is permission denied and so is 13 but I'm using the same user:

Test code:

<?phnk = mysql_connect('192.168.199.31:3306','root','xxxx');

if(!$link){

        die("Could not connect number". mysql_errno()." error "
.mysql_error());

}

?>

 

Strange, which is why I was looking at the php complile.

The phpinfo() command does mention the mysql sock in /var/lib/mysql but no
mention of a tcp connection I thought perhaps there was a compile parameter
I'm missing.

Sounds like your mysql server is not listening on your private IP address...you probably need to edit my.cnf and tell it to listen on your private(internal) ip address.

I figured it out it was SELINUX 

Now I need to figure out how to get SELINUX not to interfere with the
apache-mysql connection.

If anyone knows I wouldn't mind but it's really time to start my research on
that, most likely on a different list.

When I get to the bottom of what's happening I will post my ultimate
resolution.
But the MySQL server is listening on the port.  Here's why I thought it was
my PHP setup
The apache server will connect to mysql running on the local host with
selinux enforcing
I can connect to the remote mysql server with command line mysql commands 
Mysql -u root -h 192.168.199.31 -p
The apache server will not connect to the remote server with selinux
enforcing.
The apache server will connect to the remote server with selinux in
permissive mode.

Therefore I have come to the conclusion that my issue is with selinux.
Since I want the security enhanced features of selinux I will figure out
what the issue is and post the ultimate resolution.

I appreciate all the input and I will post back what I find.

Hi everyone.  I'm having a problem trying to use the Zend-provided PHP hooks
into Google Calendar.  After Googling, I found one person who seems to have
had the same problem, but it's not clear what resolution, if any, that
person achieved.

Briefly, I'm using the ClientLogin method to connect to Google, which works
fine.  I instantiate the Zend_Gdata_Calendar object, and that works fine
(because I can see all its guts in a print_r).  But any call to the object's
getCalendarListFeed( ) or getCalendarEventFeed( ) methods not only doesn't
work, the PHP script immediately dies.  No exception to catch, no more
output, nothing.  But the syntax is ok (and php -l script_name.php confirms
this).  Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks.

I suppose it could be.  But my calendar comes up, and the authentication is
happening successfully, as far as I can tell.  I'll check Google's status
and my code again when I'm done with class, and report back.  Thanks for the

Are you checking your calendar on the same machine that is running the PHP
code?  If you are on long island and the server is in NYC, then google could
have an issue with just NYC.  I have had that happen before when they
switched from XO to level three.

Thank You
Chuck Reeves

No, but they (my laptop and the department's web server) have the same
connection to outside, and the same external IP.

Chris,

Two suggestions:

1) Be sure logging is on by calling trigger_error() at all the severities.
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.trigger-error.php
2) Install wireshark (via ports or dmg on your mac) and sniff the traffic

I've seen PHP die like that when a required library or dependency is 
missing.
Dump your phpinfo output here or email it to me.

Sent privately.  I did have to download the client library, but I'm able to
connect to it.

Dan asked about what's in the log.  I don't have access to it, so I have to
wait till I can get downstairs and get with the admin and look through it
with him.

(On a side note, why are logs like that always read-protected?)

The web server error log is the FIRST place I would log for scripts that 
just die...

Because your admin doesn't know what they're doing? :)

But that seems to be the default on Linux boxes and/or on Apache.  Is there
some hideous security flaw that can be exploited by something in the logs?

Yes and no? But exposing them to you is probably safe. :-)

The defaults are conservative, which is good. But developers should
have access if that's where their errors are going.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Amazon's new Free Tier
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=2vTqaXmbdrMPCLw-H1k4pJeZVv_52i3hTz0XO@mail.gmail.com>

FYI, as a birthday gift to me[my birthday was October 20th and they
announced it on the 21st, clearly geared towards me!], Amazon has introduced
a new "free" pricing tier.

http://aws.amazon.com/free/

If you sign up for a new AWS developer account, you get a bunch of free
storage space and server time each month for a year.  Highlights are:

   - 750 hours of Amazon EC2 <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2> Linux Micro
   Instance usage (613 MB of memory and 32-bit and 64-bit platform support) ?
   enough hours to run continuously each month*
   - 10 GB of Amazon Elastic Block Storage <http://aws.amazon.com/ebs>, plus
   1 million I/Os, 1 GB of snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and
   1,000 snapshot Put Requests*
   - 5 GB of Amazon S3 storage <http://aws.amazon.com/s3>, 20,000 Get
   Requests, and 2,000 Put Requests*
   - 30 GB per of internet data transfer (15 GB of data transfer ?in? and 15
   GB of data transfer ?out? across all services except Amazon CloudFront)*



   -

So, basically you can run a VPS on their micro instance for free, equivalent
to a virtual linux server that you rent from others for upwards of 20$ a
month.

The only downside is that at the moment, most public EBS images are sized to
15GB, so you can't run that image all month long for free[though if you run
it for half the month, since that is 7.5GB on average for the month it will

run them through the api or command line so you can attach your ephermeral

Thanks for the notes.  I've been excited about this, but haven't created a new account yet.  Good to know about the EBS sizing and launching an instance with more memory.

     I'm mad because I've got an existing AWS account (I use S3 and 
Mturk heavily) and I don't get the free offer.  Still,  I'm thinking of 
moving my infrastructure to AWS.  For a long time I've had one big 
server that I put everything on but lately I've had a mysql database get 
huge,  I'm having problems w/ memory pressure and on top of that from 
time to time I run massive batch jobs that hose my websites.  The 
ability to easily provision a cluster of machines on AWS looks awesome 
and I'm going to do development for next mini-project on them.

Here is the solution.  Selinux will not allow httpd to connect to other
network servers by default.
The command to change this behavior is

setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1

Everything works immediately and survives a reboot

When I get to the bottom of what's happening I will post my ultimate

But the MySQL server is listening on the port.  Here's why I thought it was
my PHP setup
The apache server will connect to mysql running on the local host with
selinux enforcing
I can connect to the remote mysql server with command line mysql commands 
Mysql -u root -h 192.168.199.31 -p
The apache server will not connect to the remote server with selinux
enforcing.
The apache server will connect to the remote server with selinux in
permissive mode.

Therefore I have come to the conclusion that my issue is with selinux.
Since I want the security enhanced features of selinux I will figure out
what the issue is and post the ultimate resolution.

I appreciate all the input and I will post back what I find.

Like everything else, beware that if you go over on ANYTHING, they bill 
you. And it's only free the first year, after that, they bill you. 
Nothing in life is free. :-)

Well, I figured I am posting on the NYPHP list, so anyone here concerned 
about going over would simply write their own monitoring script using 
the Amazon PHP class libraries... :-)

Seriously though, I've gotten very tired of doing things from the 
command line and while the various dashboards are nice...either their in 
Java(yuck!) or they don't do what I want, so I figure I'm going to be 
writing a simple dashboard/monitor anyway - I hadn't considered of 
monitoring usage against the free tiers, but now that you mention it, 
that's a good idea.

For me, the "free" micro hours are useful as it lets me model things 
like setting up apps to monitor load on a set of instances and then spin 
up extra servers as load goes up.  Something I wouldn't want to go out 
of control on a pay per hour system[as even one mistake can be pricey], 
but with 750 free hours a month, I could muck up and launch 100 
duplicate instances and still only be down 100 "Free" hours.

I'd highly recommend Linode. They've got a datacenter in NJ, which is
super fast for us NYC residents, great uptime when compared to shared
hosting providers, fast turnaround time for tickets and their smallest
instance (512MB RAM, 16GB space, 100GB transfer) is only $20 a month.

At the moment, since building apps for the Amazon API lets you also 
learn how to build apps for the Eucalyptus API[since they are the same 
API, http://open.eucalyptus.com/ ] I'm tending towards Amazon as a 
starting place.  But once it comes to deployment...well, that's open to 
whatever fits your needs best.

My initial plans fit best into the Amazon environment.

The basic question is: is the application written from a coder or a dba's
point of view?

In the open source world, code tends to be written from a coders point of
view.  As such, things which would be done via stored procedures, views,
triggers, etc are instead done inside code.  It's quicker and easier to
change it there.  It also means that the application doesn't have to specify
a version of MySQL, making it more broadly used.

When maintenance of such business logic gets out of hand, coders re-invent
the code and move all the database access to specific table "classes" and
objects, where you can now code the rules directly into the program[or use
something like Doctrine which can do the same thing].

Triggers, foreign keys, views, etc work well from a DBA's point of view
where the data is carefully laid out and you don't want some undisciplined
coder coming along and mucking things up by arbitrarily setting their own
auto increment numbers, or deleting half of the data for a record but
missing the related data from other tables.

Of course, business culture will tend to favor one direction or another.  If
when the data is mucked up by bad code that incorrectly implements business
logic, if the DBA is held responsible, or worse yet has to come in over the
weekend to restore the last backup and somehow merge the data to keep all
the good changes..... well, he's certainly going to want to /control/ this
situation in the future.

Whereas if the programmer is under a time crunch and the DBA is insisting on
a week to review business logic changes[because he has just as many, if not
more, things on his plate and needs to find the time to review it] then you
can get business logic creeping into code so as to get the job done.

But maybe I'm just being cynical here. :-)

I realize I'm getting way off topic here but someone might want to do this
someday(it's LAMP related)

If you want apache to be able to read and write to a nfs share you need to
mount it with a context
mount -t nfs -o context=user_u:object_r:public_content_rw_t
192.168.199.32:/home/nfsShare /ordertmp/

since this getting off topic I leave it there.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Regexp Classic Challenge
Message-ID: <004001cb87df$35610a80$a0231f80$@com>

I need to be able to grab the first 10 words or so from a HTML laden text
string that is held in a db table field where the typical field content
might be as follows below. After the processing, being left with only the
straight text with punctuation would be fine

 

<p><img src="/files/Screen%20img.png" alt="Fresh food makes for a great
snack." width="180" height="272" style="float: right;" /> </p> 

<p>Target bodu content begins here <em>and</em> may have any html tags
interspersed. Plus, users can users can use parens (anywhere) too.</p>

<br />------<br />

<p>Another paragraph</p>

 

I'm checking to see if over the years a best practice technique with regexp
or php funcs has been established to readily sove this classic display
challenge. 

 

Thanks for any <input />.

I would recommend using DOMDocument instead of regex.

Which is why regex wont help that much.  Using tidy with domdoc could help
out very well:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] CakePHP Making a Model return data from a different
	database.
Message-ID: <95a6248d-d681-e468-99e3-f88f0e387635@me.com>

Hi all,
I am assuming there are people on the list who are knowledgeable about cakePHP on this list. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it and so far I'm finding it a bit tricky. I'm currently reading a book about cakePHP, but nee to skip through to resolve the world hunger crisis before I know how to grow corn.

The situation:
I have a model/controller/views(item.php/items_controller.php/view->admin_index.ctp and admin_add.ctp) that display items from a Mysql database. This works just as cakePHP wants, the table is designed with cakePHP in mind and the records are displayed in a table or a single record can be passed to a form for editing. I did not write this code, so maybe my issues are in understanding the code rather than cakePHP.

I need, or want, to create a view that will list records from a non-cakePHP compliant database/table, Informix, in an HTML table that when the user clicks a link, will pre-populate the admin_add.ctp views form.?

I thought I could simply add my code to access this second database in the item.php model, and then call it via the controller, items_controller.php and send it to another view admin_select.ctp. However, I cannot get my function I wrote in the model to substitute the original table results with new results from the second database.?

Am I going about this incorrectly? if so, how would you suggest doing this? The intent is to simply import data from the Informix database into the mysql database when the admin wants to add an item.

Thanks,
Bruce Martin

In the end, I canned all the frameworks. And built my own.

They are just so, so, so overkill. IMHO.

But I digress, and I am not helping you at all. But there is a big Cake user
group off the main site, probably a quick answer there.

MVC sounds SO great in academic circles, but in the end, sometimes you have
to break the rules. The M is cool, the C is cool. But the V is where you can
break it out. I call that the P, for Presentation Layer.

Is php really a good candidate for MVC?  Sometime I'm not 100% sold on that
idea. But that does not diminish at all what you can do with it. Actually it
may make it much more versatile ---- because you can break the rules.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Talk Proposal: Unit Testing
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=EDiY9UD2ui1bC5JR7oZ41U4iCHcCY2H79T0zD@mail.gmail.com>

Hi fellow PHP'ers!

Yesterday I attended my very first NYC PHP UG meetup
dedicated to the past ZendCon. I found it very interesting
and could contribute to discussion a lot, since I've been
there this year.

It's a pity I didn't have a chance to meet Hans Zaunere as
I wanted to propose a talk for one of the upcoming meetups.
As a huge fan of testing, I'd like to share my experiences
with it by giving a talk called "Unit Testing - a guide to writing
clean, testable code, that will be easy to maintain and
extend". I gave it to our local NYC Symfony meetup group
and also won the ZendUncon with it this year.

You can find the slides on slideshare:
http://www.slideshare.net/avalanche123/clean-code-5609451
They are fairly easy to read and follow.

I'd love any feedback you can give and would be honored
to talk about unit testing at on of the NYC PHP UG meetups

Best,

Bulat,

I'd like to hear a unit test talk.

I just demonstrated with code:

https://github.com/manchuck/LIPHP

I added each test one by one and showed them fail then showed the code to
make it work.  Its a pretty good demo showing a more practical approach.

Thank You

Thanks Chuck,

I concentrate on Unit Testing and specifically - isolation
and dependency injection. Your tests are mixed - integration
and unit, since they execute db queries and not just test the
query generation and are tightly couple with a db backend,
since I can't use a mock connection, as its hardcoded -
https://github.com/manchuck/LIPHP/commit/70639929ac6c33d77a806e87cc107bad5b45e458#L0R165
I understand that it was just a sample app to demonstrate TDD.
I specifically cover isolation, dependency injection, mock objects
and interface discovery in my talk.

Best,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] can't change charset on Apache vhost
Message-ID: <AANLkTimUWKJMSHS1HJ5eScQEJD04RgHZ-isgSS3ahuFj@mail.gmail.com>

Running Apache/2.2.12 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.10 on my development machine, I have
a few vhosts and I need one of them to serve iso-8859-1 rather than UTF-8.
Try as I might, it remains UTF-8. I have added AddDefaultCharset ISO-8859-1
to the vhost definition. In desperation I have also tried adding the same
directive to httpd.conf and apache2.conf. Nothing works. Wondering if it had
to do with PHP rather than static html, I have tried accessing a file that
is indeed static:  same story.

Wondering if there was something peculiar about this particular vhost, I
have tried setting and resetting the same value in other vhosts and looking
at the response headers after reloading the modified config, and it works as
it's supposed to. So, the question is, what's different? Answer:  I don't
know. Is the charset getting overridden by a local .htaccess file? No. Am I
remembering to tell Apache to reload its config after changing its config?
Yes.

The offending host definition looks like this:

<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerAdmin david_mintz at nysd.uscourts.gov
Servername interps3
AddDefaultCharset ISO-8859-1
DocumentRoot /var/www/interps3
<Directory />
Options FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
</Directory>
<Directory /var/www/interps3>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
AllowOverride All
Order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>

 ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/interps3.error.log

# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
# alert, emerg.
LogLevel warn
CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

and yet...


root at interps3:/etc/apache2/sites-available# curl -I interps3/index.php

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 30 Nov 2010 20:13:27 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.12 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.10-2ubuntu6.5 with Suhosin-Patch
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.10-2ubuntu6.5
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

By the way, the reason I care is that there are MySQL tables defined as
latin1 with accented characters that aren't getting displayed correctly, and
I have been through this before and am reasonably certain that it's a
charset mismatch issue.


I am mystified. Any suggestions?

Gratefully,

Forget it! I think it's a php-related issue after all. If I am wrong and
can't figure it out, I'll be back! (-:
