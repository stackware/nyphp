<PRE>Marvin:

I can't see the code, but I can tell a couple of things from the errors:

1. The error &quot;headers already sent &quot; is created when you have already sent stuff to the browser and try to do it again. Functions that send/modify HTTP headers must be invoked before any output is made. Otherwise the call fails.

2. The session_start() statement *must* be the first condition addressed in your scripts. I commonly use:

&lt;?php	if (session_id() === '')
				{
				session_start();
				}

Try implementing number 2 and try it again.

Also, I find it typical that blind users have no concept of paragraphs (i.e., linefeeds between topics/ideas). If you can do that, then your post will be more readable for sighted users and probably more fruitful.

Cheers,

tedd

&gt;<i> hi. a blind website development student. my lecturer not able to answer. so looking for help. the site is a contact call centre application. you add, edit, delete and update contact, and events, then you create an account and also login. so the site is at: <A HREF="http://marvinhunkin.bmtafeweb.com.">http://marvinhunkin.bmtafeweb.com.</A> I use a screen reader Jaws For windows from <A HREF="http://www.freedomscientific.com.">http://www.freedomscientific.com.</A> have uploaded all the files to filezilla. now. I am getting the following problems. if any people who knows php, my sql, html, css, and is in Australia, might be able to help. I will outline the problems below.  1. the add contact form, does not redirect, and not sure. 2. the edit contact, edit event, update contact, and update event has errors. maybe not liking the php self form tag. also with the create account and login, get errors. and apart from the add contact page, it does redirect the other pages. and also, do I need extra security, for the create account, login, and feedback form. and when I get these issues fixed, better to have a list of users, then they can then click, and then goes to a page, and then have buttons, like edit, delete, update. with the delete contact and delete event, no errors, but have php code, appear on the form. a much more friendly way of doing this. also do I need a change password form, and so any possible code. trying my best, not to do it for me, but to suggest ways and how I can fix the errors, with sample code, and other examples. have googled, looked at previous projects. so want to get this project done in the next couple of weeks. got a deadline. also, any sighted people, have a look at the layout, html, css, and if it looks professional, as totally blind. and also, if I need to change images, if they are appropriate for this site. so, if any one is in Australia, as I live in South Australia, Australia. would be more preferable if possible, as same time zone, but if not, then any help would be appreciated. a local friend was helping out, but he cannot help, has a full time job, family, and I understand that. have asked on the student forum, but no one, helping me out. so if any one could help, I would appreciate it. thanks. Marvin..
