<PRE>Put your mother or father in front of it. Let them use it for an hour. Have them tell you what they think.

Automated testing for load balancing and prediction is one thing.... But real world when people are clicking back button, forward button, jumping from page to page. Only mom can test that...

IMHO

</I>&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is a loaded question for the following reason: in order to secure optimal user experience you need to run manual or semi-automatic tests. I cannot think of a single automated testing tool that can check for properly alignment of controls, etc. Humans are much more efficient and faster for such tests, even for regression.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Test automation is useful to test the backend for features that are unlikely to change. Do not use automation for anything that is still under development because you will spend more time fixing your test scripts than what you gain in test automation. A while back I gave Selenium a try and found it to be OK, but since I work in a Microsoft shop we use Microsoft Test Manager (which works fine with IE and sucks for any other browser). Microsoft Test Manager also needs a Team Foundation Server and if you do not have that set up or are not willing to spend a lot of cash it is out of the competition here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For a while I also used iMacros for Firefox to automate a few processes, but mainly because I was lazy (<A HREF="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imacros-for-firefox/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imacros-for-firefox/</A>). The biggest problem with iMacros is that it tremendously slows down the response of the system. As long as you do not take iMacro's script run times as performance indicator you can quite easily click together scripts and run them as needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One other popular tool is Fitnesse (<A HREF="http://fitnesse.org/">http://fitnesse.org/</A>). I have read plenty about it, but have yet to find the time to dive into it...maybe I get to it ten years from now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How large is your application? If it is under about two dozen features I wonder if automation will really benefit you. Keep in mind test automation means writing more code to test code, and yes, test scripts can have bugs as well! Also, test scripts will work fine as long as the test engine can find the control on the page. That means the automated test will not fail when the controls are splattered across the page or all on top of each other. Just because an automated test passes does not mean everything is peachy, all it tells you is that whatever worked before appears to be working fine right now (which is important). You still need to do some manual testing which will also reveal a bunch of issues the script wasn't programmed to look at.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope I could give some pointers.
