Subject: [nycphp-talk] session validation between http requests
Message-ID: <865a7acf0908010035p285316c5of00e438a459f13ba@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

Anyone doing session validation between HTTP requests?  I know that
the HTTP headers can all be changed and spoofed, but for legitimate
users, I expect the HTTP headers I'm using below to NOT change between
requests, during the same session.

I've been looking into this lately, but ran across sites (like
http://shiflett.org/articles/the-truth-about-sessions) that say that
HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET can legitimately change between requests during a
session.  I've never run into this in testing, so I was wondering if
somebody could confirm that statement?

What about the other HTTP headers I'm using below.  Can those
legitimately and realistically change as well during a session?

Any ideas, comments, or suggestions would be greatly welcomed!

Thanks,
Konstantin


$client_id = '';

if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET']) === true)
{
	$client_id .= $_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET'];
}
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING']) === true)
{
	$client_id .= $_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING'];
}
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE']) === true)
{
	$client_id .= $_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'];
}
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']) === true)
{
	$client_id .= $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
}

if ($_SESSION['client_id_hash'] !== md5($client_id))
{
	header('Location: /logout');
	exit();
}

That's ridiculous, it's a system config file meant to be configured.
"Be careful", yes, but "Don't touch it" is a bit extreme.

Noone said anything about root.  sudo does not imply root.  Using sudo
and understanding how to configure it is a security plus, not a minus.

I think history has shown that most programmers are not system 
administrators and often dont think through all the implications of what 
they're doing. So, in that context, I dont think its extreme to say not to 
mess with it. If you can peform the task without it, which is true in this 
case, then do so.

Ok, point taken.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] preg_replace to extract a domain name?
Message-ID: <574631668.20090802001758@vbplusme.com>

Hello NYPHP,

I am using preg_replace to try to extract the domain name of one of my
sites so that I can use it as a variable. It has a standard http
format, i.e. http://www.mydomain.com and I am trying to get only
"mydomain" from it.

I have something that works but it does multiple tests before it
generates the variable I need. I thinking that the multiple lines
ought to be combined into a single statement that does the job on one
fell swoop. Am I right in assuming this can be done in one line of
code?

TIA for any pointers.

Use parse_url()

http://us3.php.net/parse_url


Something like this:

$domain = parse_url($my_url, PHP_URL_HOST);


Or, if you want some of the other pieces later:

$chunks = parse_url($my_url);
$domain = $chunks['host'];

// then you can use 'path', 'query', etc. as well.

For improved security, you should not do:

> ? ? ? ?header('Location: /logout');

but rather invalidate the session right there.  Your code relies on
the attacker actually following redirects to unset the session.
People who hijack sessions don't follow redirects.

I did a test to see if this would actually be valuable, and from my
access log file the most common user agent only had 3% of the traffic,
so I think there is some value to this approach.  I think 'httponly'
cookies is probably a better XSS attack mitigation strategy in the
long run (though there is no reason you can't do both).

In php 5.2+ the option is:
ini_set("session.cookie_httponly", 1);

It is supported by FF 3+, IE7+, and Safari 4+

John Campbell

No argument there. What you can do, and what you should do, are often 
not the same.  :)

Zebra Crossing is a java based project that probably does what you
want.  Haven't used it personally, but I know it is behind the Shop
Savvy andriod application.  I am quite sure you wont find anything
with php bindings.

Many barcode reading devices act as a keyboard emulator via USB or PS2 
connector.

I have written keyboardless touchscreen and barcode scanner kiosk apps 
based on apache/php.
One simple trick is to create a form on the page and have a body onload 
javascript running that does a constant "focus" to the form field. That 
way input from the scanner is always entered into the form.  If you 
don't want the field to be visible, use some css to make it the same 
color as the background or very tiny in size. The scanner device should 
read the barcode, dump it to the form field and send an "enter" key when 
done.

I think the question is to read it from an image, not the actual barcode using 
a scanner.

So it would be something like OCR for barcodes? I would be interested in that as well. I hate to say this but... Isn't there "an app for that"?

Hi ajai,

  Just go through http://www.barcodephp.com/download.php
 dowload suitable version & test it on yr side
 You will get the basic idea of barcode.& use that image wherever u want

Before I get started, does anyone know of a library or good approach to
checking broken links.

 

I'm thinking I have to parse the document searching for href or src and see
make sure the links return 401?

 

I don't want to do this in php.  What function would be good for validating
the link?

check that?

The curl seemed to be taking a while.

I noticed file_get_contents issues warnings to standard output when the file
is not found:

Warning: file_get_contents(http://www.AkronGayRealEstate.com/theImages[i];):
failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.
1 404 Not Found

A try catch block didn't seem to intercept this.

How can I catch a warning in the code?

Instead of crawling the site yourself, have Google crawl it and report

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Conference - VOTE NOW
Message-ID: <0bd801ca1a15$785b86a0$691293e0$@com>

Hello,

As some may have heard, CodeWorks is coming to NYC in October - we'll post
more details as their available but suffice it to say, that each local stop
on the CodeWorks road show allows one local speaker.

Over on the Org list, I've asked folks to submit abstracts, and now we have
a chance to vote on the topics.  The abstract that receives the most votes
will be the primary speaker, and the second, well, secondary/backup.

Please email me directly off list with your votes as to not clutter this
list, then I'll announce the selected speakers.  Please vote only for two
talks.

Here they are:

An Introduction to Zend AMF
Zend AMF gives developers the ability to quickly and efficiently communicate
between Flex and PHP. In this talk we'll cover the basics of setting up an
application that uses Zend AMF, look at some common errors that you may
encounter and explore the ways we can display and manipulate our data once
it's in Flex.

Coding Secure with PHP and Enterprise LAMP Security
Anyone involved in web application development over the last five years
should be aware of the security ecosystem surrounding PHP. Often overhyped,
sometimes dramatic, and always interesting, the topics of PHP and security
are usually linked at the hip, and a favorite comedy topic for those
involved with other languages.  While PHP has made some security mistakes in
the past, the focus of criticism is often misguided. The applicable codebase
for the security notices - whether it be the PHP core, an extension, or an
application - is forgotten and PHP as a whole gets one more strike.  PHP
also provides great power and flexibility. But with it, comes great
responsibility. As with any application living on the internet, it's the
entire support staff's responsibility architect, developer, and
administrator - to ensure an application meets organization security
requirements.  In this talk, we'll provide tips, tricks, and fundamental
best practices from the trenches for ensuring your code and LAMP deployment
isn't caught off guard. He'll then review the PHP security ecosystem and
available resources, debunk myths, and reveal some surprising facts that
could leave you thinking PHP is one of the most secure languages available
today.

Extreme Scale with Thin Server Architecture
As website interactivity demands put a bigger strain on your beautiful code,
faster internet connections and more website visitors don't make it any
easier. There is a way to dramatically drop the overhead of rendering a
page, by asking the browser to do all the work. Learn how to scale your
applications to absurd extremes with this simple, ingenious concept.

I Smoked Too Much PHP
Let's face it, we all love our PHP. And after all these countless hours
spent mastering our craft, and then more countless hours bickering with our
cohorts about who is better, we learned the shocking truth: There is more
out there. We occasionally hear about other languages and their offerings,
and some people even like them.  Gasp! What is all the fuss about? A
sometimes funny and occasionally accurate telling of what is going on out
there in the non-PHP world of mundanes.

MySQL and PHP - State of the Union
Latest look on that famous couple, MySQL and PHP. He'll cover the latest in
connectors, best practices and techniques, how to optimize performance
between the two, scaling, and how all of this fits into the latest buzzword,
the cloud.

The State of the PHP CMS
Many believe the rich variety of PHP-based Content Management Systems (CMS)
greatly accelerated the adoption of PHP both in the consumer and corporate
sectors. This session identifies the key players and outlines a brief
history of each, as well as demonstrate their strengths and weaknesses. Best
of all is an open discussion of not only what is coming in the future, but
what everyone really wants.

Thanks all,

H

OR

I believe there are more free services like this too.

Sorry for quick answer, but you need to use utilities (commands) like 
"mysqldump" or "mysqlhotcopy" to do. Just SQL queries wont help for lot of 
databases.

However you may invoke above commands from web by taking proper precautions. 
Otherwise just run them from console. For more information study MySQL manual. 
There is enough documentation about this task.

Message-ID: <371125141.20090811215917@vbplusme.com>

Hello NYPHP,

  I have an errorpage script that checks for
  $_SERVER['REDIRECT_STATUS'] and delivers a user friendly message
  depending on which error condition it finds, works great most of the
  time. The problem is when is encountered a password protected
  folder, it delivers the 401 or 403 error message and completely
  ignores/bypasses the popup username/password window that usually
  occurs in .htaccess password protected folders.

  What test / condition do I need to use to check for if a folder is
  password protected in combination with the REDIRECT_STATUS to allow
  the popup window instead of automatically generating the 401 / 403
  error messages?

  TIA for any help. This was a total surprise to me after I deployed
  the script so I have a bit of a bind to fix it ASAP.

Gang, I'll confess that I'm happy to support Java as it provides lots of

What does Java provide that PHP can't do faster and with lighter

Don't know in detail, but my guess is that PHP is thought of about to be a 
pure web only scripting language where as Java is more for desktop 
applications or the like. In typical use you need a web server for PHP, for 
Java you don't. That said, I am well aware that you can use PHP to write 
non-web and even desktop applications.
One other reason could be that Java is used to torture CS students, while PHP 
is poopooed as something script kiddies use. Same question can be asked about 
ASP.NET, that in no way does anything better than PHP, especially not performance.

I attended a Java course at university and eventually dropped out and changed 
majors. I did ANSI C before and that was already more painful than necessary. 
Java topped that by a mile. I have no idea why developers pick Java. I find it 
kludgey and the development tools stink, but apparently it is good enough to 
bring us awesome software like OpenOffice. For years I always found that I 
hate programming and programming hates me...until I came across PHP. It just 
makes sense (OK, except for some of the date functions that were written half 
by Americans and half by Europeans using their date format respectively).

Any other reasons? Java is Sun and PHP is, hmmmm, Zend? Na, there are plenty 
others. Java is Eclipse and PHP is, hmmmmm, can think of three or four great 
IDEs from freebie (Waterproof) to we charge you for every dot release 
(NuSphere). Nobody gets fired for using Java or .NET....unless you are hired 
to do PHP I could see that it is a tough sell to the mindless preventors of IT 
services.

Java is an interpreted and complied language in the same time while php is
only interpreted as it's a scripting language so java provides extra layer
of security over php plus java can be used to program anything you can watch
the javaone conference James Gosling toy show and see what java does it's
used for desktop, web, mobile devices while php can't do any except the web
and with the notice I said before.

Start with

http://www.bluehatseo.com/seo-empire-part-1/

and read everything on that site.  Then do some experiments and read 
that site all over again.  I know it's a site for sore eyes,  and it's 
very hard to really understand,  and about 20% of it is crazy and 
wrong,  but 80% of it is brilliant truth -- once you start to apply it 
you'll realize that.  Few people have mastered it,  but those who do get 
great results.  Just don't tell Eli I sent you.

    I've got a system that's gotten complicated enough that it's 
"outgrowing" PHP.  One big advantage in PHP is that you can get more 
productivity out of rookie programmers.  It takes a good programmer 1 
1/2 years to be able to produce usable Java,  and some programmers never 
get good at it.  The ideas in this system are complicated enough that I 
think I'd have a hard time hiring another programmer who could handle 
it,  so the simplicity advantage of PHP is gone.  I'm starting to want 
static types so that the compiler is watching my back and so that my IDE 
can do automated refactoring.

    I'm thinking of gradually moving to the JVM but using Scala instead 
of Java.  After 2 years of working in C#,  Java really seems like C#--.  
I mean,  even PHP has closures today.  Type inference,  generics and 
other features in C# make Java seem like it's going backwards.  On the 
other hand,  if I'm doing my own sysadmin or paying somebody to sysadmin 
my systems,  I don't want to be stuck in Windows.  I know a lot of 
people think the type system of Scala is over-complicated,  but after 2 
years of lover's quarrels with the C# type system,  Scala provided the 
general theory that informs my practice in C#.

   I'm interested in logic programming and other inference systems,  as 
well as specialized databases:  there's a lot of that written in Java.  
Java's never quite going to have the efficiency of C,  but it's better 
for systems work than PHP.  If I feel the need for scripting there's 
always Groovy,  Jython,  etc.

    My big beef with the JVM (and the CLR) is the UTF-16 scandal;  
perhaps I'm a cultural imperialist,  but I process lots of text 
(billions and billions of characters) that is mainly:

(i) us-ascii,
(ii) iso-latin-1,  and
(iii) Unicode that is mainly us-ascii with occasional spattering of 
iso-latin-1 and other unicode characters

For me,  UTF-8 encodes text at about (1+epsilon) bytes per character;  
the JVM and CLR encode text at (2+epsilon) bytes per characters.  A few 
years ago,  when I was stuck on 32-bit machines,  that was often the 
difference between a program that could run in RAM and a program that 
couldn't.  Since text processing is limited by memory bandwidth,  it 
often means large text-processing programs run about twice as slow on 
the JVM as they do in UTF-8 based environments.

What makes it a scandal is that UTF-16 pretends to be a fixed-width 
encoding when it really isn't.  Code that works correctly with,  say,  
English or Japanese will break when you're processing Chinese or 
mathematical characters.  Code written with the fast random access that 
Java provides doesn't generalize to all languages,  so you need to fall 
back to the same sequential access methods that you use handling UTF-8 
in PHP.

A big advantage of PHP for unicode handling is that it "does no harm;"  
I've often seen Java and CLR systems fail seriously because of 
limitations in how they handle Unicode characters,  particularly when 
dealing with junky input data.

Recently I've taken to the approach of using PHP as the front end
application scripting language, and building out RESTful services
using java. This lets you take advantage of the best of both - PHP for
fast prototyping, and java for the 'heavy lifting' behind a REST
layer.

I was recently asked what my 3 biggest complaints were about PHP, and
one of them was not having an app container for a stateful service,
like some sort of PHP equivalent to jetty etc.

    Watch out,  statefulness can be a road to hell.   The lack of state 
in one of the reasons why PHP apps are trouble free.  Cold Fusion,  
ASP.NET,  JSP and a lot of related environments tempt people to be 
sloppy about state and these often create horrible problems.

The reasons are mostly non-technical. Java and PHP are both fine
languages. But Java had a strong position in the late 90's with
backing from what was once a highly respected company. At that same
time PHP was still held together with duct tape and string.

Today the Java and PHP are much more competitive which is why it has
provoked such contentious debate. Java and virtually all third party
libraries are almost completely platform independent. If you write
something on Windows, it has a very good chance of running on Linux.
But PHP applications are faster. This is in large part due to the fact
that PHP is mostly a glue language for C and it's various libraries
which are optimized for the platform on which they were compiled.

But again, the reasons for choosing PHP vs. Java are usually not
technical at all.

My personal opinion is that if you're a Windows shop and you treat
software development like a logistical problem and you need to hire
and fire programmers like a commodity, then use Java. It's much more
forgiving than PHP. To be effective with PHP you must really
understand PHP well. If you're really good at PHP it can be much more
powerful than Java. Of course most people fall into the Windows
commodity programmer category and so I predict Java will be around for
a while. But PHP will continue to dominate with power programmers.

    I'd say it's the opposite.  Java's improved more in the last ten 
years than PHP has (although PHP certainly has)

http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/09/20/java-is-the-suv-of-programming-tools/

    Back in 2003,  Java Frameworks such as Struts were part of the 
problem,  not part of the solution.  Much better frameworks exist 
today,  and there's much more of a "framework culture" that people 
understand how to build apps well.

    It's impossible to explain the power of the Eclipse/Java IDE to 
anyone who works primarily in dynamic languages.  I mean,  it does 
things that PHP IDEs can't even dream of doing:  first of all,  Eclipse 
overcomes most of the verbosity of Java that makes Java painful to work 
on.  You can click on a 'create class' button and it creates a file in 
the right place for the namespace it's in,  fills in the headers and all 
that.  Renaming a class in Java is a big pain manually,  but can be done 
in two clicks in Eclipse:  Eclipse renames all the instances of the 
class,  renames the file.  Refactoring operations that could take a few 
hours in PHP or in Java w/o an IDE can be done in under a minute...  and 
never a mistake.

    What I'd really like is a less verbose language,  like Scala,  with 
the good IDE.  There's no reason Eclipse/Scala couldn't be as good as 
Eclipse/Java,  except that a lot of people just don't appreciate what an 
advance Eclipse/Java is over vi.

    It's much easier to be productive,  at a low level, in PHP than it 
is in Java.

    I've given business people 1-day bootcamp training in PHP and that's 
been enough for them to make small changes to their sites.  Systems like 
Smarty are a big waste of time in my opinion,  since graphic designers 
can quickly learn enough PHP to write templates -- and they find it's a 
useful skill.

    Personally,  I'm working on a product that has a complex meta-object 
system:  it's kind of a CMS for robots,  or an object-relational mapper 
turned inside out.  It layers object-relational and semweb capabilities 
over mysql and enables extreme re-use of code and database schemas.  It 
heavily uses the dynamic dispatch capabilities in PHP,  but the core of 
it is complicated enough that I wish I had the help of a compiler and 
IDE in maintaining it.

    If I were a Windows shop,  I'd go for ASP.NET.  C# is a wonderful 
language,  a living language.  Microsoft is continually improving it,  
while it seems Java is stuck in reverse.  Linq is just great,  and the 
C# generics system makes Java generics look like a joke.  There's a lot 
of junk in ASP.NET,  but if you avoid the junk,  it's a system that's 
better in J2EE in all ways (Java Web Faces is as much of a stinker as 
ASP.NET Web Forms)  The big trouble is that people from straight-windows 
backgrounds can't tell what's junk and what's not -- w/ a decade of PHP 
experience (and a healthy phobia of accidentally being stateful) I've 
found it easy to find the good stuff in ASP.NET;  recent versions of IIS 
do a good job of surviving exceptional events inside ASP.NET,  better 
than most Tomcat installations I've seen.

    Of course,  ASP.NET means you're stuck with Windows...  If you can't 
accept that,  you've got to use something else.

Of course, you're ignoring the fact that these have little to do with Java 
- IDEs exist for PHP too.

Personally, I dislike IDEs but to each their own.

I agree with you about this. Microsoft has always had good language
support. C# as a language is clearly superior to Java. However, Java
still has a huge advantage in that it is platform independent. C# may
be an ISO standard but that is meaningless if the class libraries are
tied to the Windows platform. If a good platform independent
implementation of C# with good platform independent libraries turned
up, it could do very well.

I also agree with you about all the "junk". C# and Java both suffer
the "fluffy programming" problem. The number of classes and half-baked
attempts at OO abstractions is unnecessarily complex and nonuniform.
The number of C# assemblies is staggering. Why does logging in Java
need 17 classes with all sorts of complex OO relations? That's just
ridiculous.

    See,  that's what PHPers,  Pythoners,  Ruby people always say...  I 
did a lot of Java from 1996 to 1999 and then gave up on it for PHP.  
Recently I had to finish a GWT/J2EE app  that somebody else started,  
and Eclipse/Java opened my eyes.

    Eclipse/PHP doesn't do anything vi doesn't do,  except it has two 
buttons you can click on to start and stop your web server.  Woooo...  
I'm so impressed.  All you get from Eclipse/PHP is increased startup 
time.  No wonder why PHPers think Eclipse is worthless,  because 
Eclipse/PHP ~is~ worthless.  Eclipse has seriously damaged it's brand by 
coming out with shovelware products for PHP,  Ruby,  Python,  etc.  They 
really ought to be like the Apple App Store and ban that stuff so people 
realize that Eclipse/Java is cool.

    Eclipse/Java does something different from every other Eclipse/X 
I've seen.  It parses your code,  understands something about it,  and 
helps you.  For instance,  if you write

    objectInstance.AMethodThatDoesNotExist()

    a little symbol appears on the side of the screen:  click on it and 
it will offer you choices:  for instance,  it will correct typos if you 
type something that is almost like an existing method.  You can create 
the method with one click,  or you can change the access level of the 
method if you're not currently allowed to access it.  The UI is good 
enough that it feels like a help,  not a hindrance.  The IDE highlights 
methods and variables that don't get used;  there are at least 20 
different automated refactorings that make changes (like pushing methods 
up & down a class hierarchy or renaming methods) automatically.  Yes,  
you can just click on the definition of a method,  class,  or variable,  
type in a new name,  and it gets changed everywhere...  In seconds,  
without ever making mistakes.  All of that helps compensate for the 
additional artifacts that you need to write Java.

    Eclipse/Java also has a debugger that ~works~.  There are a lot of 
reasons for it,  but I've never been able to build a PHP debugging 
system with a PHP IDE that really works.   No more having debugging 
"echo" statements winding up in production code...

    Visual Studio/C# is maybe 50% as good as Eclipse/Java,  and the 
ReSharper product from JetBrains gets it up to 90%.

    It's enterprise-itis,  and it's not the fault of the language.  
Unfortunately,  companies like Sun and Microsoft will hire people who 
have systems programming experience but no real experience with the 
problem domain to develop tools.  Requirement #1 is putting as many 
acronyms in the marketing material as possible.  Requirement #2 is 
making it possible to interface with a large number of legacy system 
that ought to be taken behind the shed and shot.  Security,  
Reliablity,  Performance and developer convenience rank somewhere around 
Requirement #19482.  You'd get very different results if the system was 
written by a battle hardened IT sysadmin rather than a couple of college 
kids and Bangalore Bangers headed up a product manager hired away from a 
breakfast cereal company.

    ColdFusion,  ASP.NET and other commercial web systems appear to be 
built by smart people who'd never built web applications.  If they'd 
hired people who'd spent a decade writing webapps,  they'd understand 
the unwritten standards behind web sites that work.  However,  people 
who know how to build webaps and do systems work are busy.

I'm pretty sure you are talking about using eclipse as a text editor? There
are a couple plugins that make eclipse intelligent about your php project.

PHPEclipse does do code hinting, I believe PDT does as well.  Not to mention
netbeans with its PHP Plugin, or how about Zend Studio / Komodo / VS.PHP.
They all have code hinting/"intellisense"

there are two debugging "systems" you can use with php.  XDebug and DBG,
PHPEclipse and Netbeans/PHP both have support for this.

    Code hinting doesn't count for that much.  I type fast,  I know the 
built-in PHP methods like the back of my hand,  and these things can't 
understand the classes and functions that I write well enough to be 
useful for artifacts that aren't part of the language.

    To be fair I make matters worse by depending on heavily on 
autoloading as well as computed file, method,  function and class 
names.  A useful PHP IDE for me would need to not only understand plain 
PHP,  but also be programmable w/ rules to describe the naming 
conventions used in my framework.

    There's a world of difference between the gimmicks in the PHP 
editors I've seen and what Eclipse/Java does,

    I know.  I've never gotten either of those to work effectively.  
There's always been some problem,  like the plug-in wouldn't build on 
the target machine or it would built but cause Apache to crash,  or 
there was a firewall in the way.  If I was getting paid to screw around 
with debuggers and write patches and all that I might be able to make it 
work,  but I've found that Java debugging and C# debugging just work...

Syntax coloring usually tells me Ive mistyped and I see the typo right 
away. I dont want to waste a few seconds looking at messages and/or

My dislike of IDEs has little to do with the features, but more to do with 
the fact that *for me*, having to move my hands away from the keyboard to 
click the mouse buttons is an annoyance and a waste of time. This is why I 
learn all the keyboard shortcuts and add utilities that give me stuff I 
cannot normally control from the keyboard (like switching to console 
Quake-style). I use a Mac all day and use the mouse plenty, but when Im

And you've probably never used XDebug or FirePHP.

Personally, I love a good IDE. For PHP I cannot think of a better one than 
NuSphere, even though I dispise their pricing model, which is still bargain 
bin compared to Zend Studio (which I could never figure out).
Sure, you can use some cryptic editor and it really gets your hands dirty, but 
you are also less efficient. Just things like code completion reduce the 
amount of silly typing errors. Can't get that from a text editor. Also, IDEs 
like NuSphere come with an integrated server, so you can right away see what 
you are doing.

Maybe the assembler developers who write firmware are fine with a simple 
editor that has some really basic functions, but anything higher than that, 
why wouldn't one want to use an IDE?

As far as code completion and hinting, if you write PHPDoc tags, the
assistance available in Zend Studio rivals that of Eclipse/Java.
Without the tags, it's not as useful (no parameter type-hints or
return type hinting) as it is with them, but it can still "learn" your
project layout and use classes / methods that you've already defined.
 As far as dynamic class names and function names, I don't recall
Eclipse/Java supporting that, so it's not really fair to take that
away from PHP IDE's.

With regards to debugging, I don't know how you've attempted to setup
remote debugging - which has to be what you're talking about with
regards to crApache, but something along the lines of "pecl install
xdebug", add the lines to php.ini and forward some ports in my router
has always worked for me.  And even if you have reasons to not have
remote debugging support all the time, the built in debugging of both
Zend Studio and PDT works fine.

When I started writing PHP, I initially tried out PDT, which was
relatively weak at that point and went with working in a
syntax-highlighting only editor for a while.  When I found that Zend
Studio had switched to being based on Eclipse and I tried it, to find
that it's the closest to Eclipse/Java of any IDE I've tried.  It's not
as useful as E/J is, but that's also not entirely the fault of the
IDE, but also the language.  Things like return types, what exceptions
are thrown, parameter types, etc. are easily available and parsed from
Java, not so much from PHP, because those declarations have to be made
in PHPDoc blocks.

I think, overall, Java is a language that's a lot more conducive to
having a full featured and helpful IDE than PHP is, well, even more so
than most languages.  PHP hasn't been a serious language for very long
(I don't consider PHP <5 to be a serious language), so I'd give it
some time before I started comparing apples and oranges.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Migrate to Cloud
Message-ID: <003a01ca1bb4$ac9eec40$05dcc4c0$@com>

I'd like to start migrating to a cloud computing type of work style for 

myself. Essentially use my laptop w/ 500GB Passport HD (USB powered, no
cord) to 

have the work software, but use google Apps for basic document and
email. 

 

Google seems to have limits on their file sizes and types to store, so
I've looked around 

for more free form cloud storage

 

MSFT has a free Sky Drive - 25GB of cloud storage with a Live ID. 

There is also Live Mesh.

 

Any other suggestions on a cloud storage resource? Strategy?

Speak for yourself. With the right options and plugins, a good text editor 
is great  - muscle memory means I dont to think about the act of editing 
but just focus on the code. And again, for *me* constantly 
switching between mouse and keyboard is totally inefficient.

Actually I coded assembler languages when I was a kid too, and most good 
assembly language systems are more than just simple text editors...

I know vi is the holy grail of editors, but I find it cryptic and unintuitive. 
Sure, after learning all the keyboard shortcuts that amount more to a 
scripting language you get a lot done, but I find it silly to spend more time 
on learning the tool than learning the trade..... unless I am a vi salesman.

I use NuSpehere and find that I do not constantly switch between keyboard and 
mouse. I use the mouse for tasks such as creating a new file in the desired 
location (browsing is faster using a mouse) or when scrolling through the code 
to set breakpoints.
I don't think that an IDE forces one to use a mouse constantly. There are 
plenty of keyboard shortcuts and tab sequences that allow for working mouseless.
And if you take a text editor and install add-ons and plugins to help along 
with coding it smells like IDE to me, at least the lines get blurred between 
IDE and text editor.
What I like about NuSphere (and other PHP IDEs as well) is the integrated 
server, the properly working debugger, and with that the option to set 
breakpoints. I know I can accomplish that in other ways, but I tried to do so 
with Eclipse and it was a total nightmare. Things may have changed by now.
By jolly, I'm not trying to make you a convert. I know of people who can 
compile code in the brains and if they had a network plug in their ears they 
wouldn't even need a PC.

I learned assembler on the Z80 and the editor that we had was really not much 
more than a somewhat better text editor. It may depend on the development kit 
that is available for the platform.

Hi Parthasarathy,

If all you are looking for is a dedicated commerce site, you will best
be served with Magento. Something integrated with a CMS (like
Joomla/VirtueMart) only adds value if you have a need for an
integrated storefront and website.

Would be helpful to know more about what you need, otherwise our
replies are just guesses ;-)

Which brings up an interesting point. I was recently in a shop where
all of the senior developers were MIT alumni. They all had these crazy
whack-daddy split rounded ergonomic keyboards, and they all worked
almost exclusively in emacs.

This didn't indicate to me that this was the best environment, but one
that required enough effort to get comfortable in to be restricting.
Take the jimi hendrix keyboards away, or take emacs away, and these
dudes were in a heap o' hurt 'n' pain!

I wonder if our strong opinions on environments are more driven by
comfort than actual features and whatnot? I got so used to kate and
quanta - I lived in KDE for 6 years and never really got over it - and
still miss them although I have plenty of really incredible tools in
OSX as well...

Are you looking specifically for just storage or cloud apps?

Just like any other tool, there is a learning curve (a few hours really). 
An IDE would have a learning curve too.

Unlike some people, Im not assuming to speak for everybody.

As I said earlier, everyone uses what they're comfortable with. There is 
no 'right' way as long as you're productive and get the job done.

Really just looking for storage at this time. But if anyone can speak to
a cloud app setting that is innovative and worth looking at, I'd like to
hear.

The Drupal site is very informative. 

 

But turning to the Drupal user/developer/administrators out there, is
there some alternative website(s), book(s) or blog(s) where you have
turned and have found invaluable Drupal info over time?

Peter:

Take a look at Amazon S3, which is their online storage product (Simple
Storage Solution = S3).  I am sure it will do what you need and can be
easily expanded and integrated with their other services as your needs
change.  If you are using the Firefox browser, download and install the
S3Fox plugin -- does all the heavy lifting for working with S3 as a online
drive and allows you to enjoy your new found storage.

I've been using Amazon S3 for content storage, and it seems to work ok.

For basic file admin work with S3, there is an S3 plugin for Firefox,  
and Cyberduck.

I use it to serve js, images, css etc. for web apps and also for user  
created content.

I'm not sure that I actually "like" depending on S3 to deliver  
components of the
actual web app, but it works.

For user created content in a load balanced situation it solves the  
problem
of where to store the user created stuff.

Best Regards,

Glenn

I have so many Drupal sites bookmarked, it's hard to say which are the
most valuable.

I recently came across SugarSync (sugarsync.com) who offer 2Gb accounts 
for free. Allows you to share and sync folders across many computers. They 
have clients for Mac, Windows but also phones (iPhone, Blackberry, Android 
- hence my interest).

After spending 10 years with Java, I jumped into ObjC on the iPhone/Mac
platform.  I think it just blows Java away. Really makes programming Fun
again.  Give it a try.  You may be AMAZED at how good ObjC is.

I don't understand, are you referring to the language itself (cos i find it
a bit weird) or to the nice things you can do it, using the whole platform
actually?I mean its very rewarding to create something that responds to
touch and other stuff on a device like the iphone, but i'm not sure how much
of that comes from objC as a language.

Thanks folks!

So there are some things like concurrency and XSLT 2.0 that Java 
provides that makes it a contender in the system space. I'm not really 
programmer enough to get that part but I'll accept your thoughts.  :)

Of course, now part of me wonders if Python could cover where PHP 
doesn't and we could keep Java contained in the Uni classroom. That 
might help computer load levels a good bit...

Again, thanks!

I like to call it Obfuscated-C :-)

Actually as mobile platforms go, iPhone has the steepest learning curve, 
but the mobile space is very interesting and has brought some fun back 
into programming (well, at least for me).

Hey Edward,

Right on man - I love coding w/obj-c/iphone/xcode. The workflow within 
XCode is awesome - I find it really productive
and I love the integration w/gdb/IB. Obj-c itself has some cool 
features, like all the NSString convenience methods, @synthesized
getters/setters, along with all the neat features of the iphone 
(gestures, accelerometer, etc).

I just got into it about 5 months ago, but I've been compelled to create 
some apps, a few of which are in the appstore.
Search "ben sgro" to check them out!

Said it best:

Really makes programming Fun
again.  Give it a try.  You may be AMAZED at how good ObjC is.

and has brought some fun back 
into programming (well, at least for me).

For me, Pro Drupal Development was everything I needed to start building 
modules.

Nothing I've read in Ruby made sense. Python makes sense, PHP makes 
sense. Ruby has come to me like an artist's side of the brain and I'm 
just not artistic. Of course, programming can be art so others probably 
"get it" better.

Those little 4-packs of Murphy's are just about the right size to last
through a clean install and fresh macports setup.

    Looking at post-PHP alternatives,  I gave up on both Python and Ruby 
pretty quickly.  Although Python and Ruby are more advanced languages in 
some ways,  they're not "better enough" than PHP to be worth the cost of 
switching.  There's also the issue that neither one has developed a 
completely satisfactory server runtime,  although Ruby has come close.

    Python,  Ruby,  PHP and all other dynamic languages are going to be 
handicapped when it comes to concurrent programming.  Although languages 
of that type ~can~ support threads with primitives much like Java,  they 
invariably have data structures that require locking (symbol tables) 
that reduce the amount of concurrency they can exploit.  Open source 
languages also tend to depend on legacy libraries that aren't thread 
safe:  the "100% Pure Java" xenophobia has helped Java create one of the 
very few runtimes that supports concurrency on different platforms.

Until you can amortize away that period of negative productivity while 
you're switching languages, it's almost always better to stick with what 
you know, unless there's a really really compelling other reason (like: 
what you want to do can be done in 10% of the time in <new language>)

I've found twisted to be really nice for Python.

I'm trying to dynamically create an array in javascript to pass to php.

 

This works in FF, but not IE 7.  Does anyone know how to make this work in
IE?

 

            var inp = document.createElement("input");

            inp.type = "text";

            inp.name = "city[]";

            inp.id = "city0";

            inp.value = "Houston";

            document.getElementById('theDiv').appendChild(inp);

 

document.getElementById("city0").length -> 1

document.getElementsByName("lcity[]").length -> 0

 

Michele

You probably should look at using Prototype or JQuery to do this kind of 
stuff since those frameworks isolate you from having to deal with 
differences across browers.

Shouldn't document.getElementById("city0?).length be
document.getElementById("city0?).value.length
?
Also, you should look into creating a json string, send it to php and use
json_decode on the php side. If what you're looking for is sending arrays to
php. But I'm not sure you're thinking of the same thing looking at your
example.

Yeah, there's no document.getElementById("city0").length.  I'm not even
using that particular statement.

 

I was just trying to iterate that document.getElementById("city0") was
definited.

 

Specifically that the id is being used to identify the element but name is
not.

I didn't want to have to do it but this works:

document.getElementById('theDiv').innerHTML = "<input type='text'
name='city[]' id = 'city"+ndx+"' class='auto-complete-city'>";

This is my typical work around for IE.

I would say submit the entire form and have the text box take precedence
over the drop down.

You should keep it as a single submission for simplicity for the user.
I would have an "Other" as the last item in the drop down list, which
would reveal a field to enter a bank name in. Select a bank name would
hide the field. Then on the server side you check if the "Other" bank
option was selected, then enter the "Other" bank name in your
database.
It keeps it to a single form submission with a single button.

Hello all,

I discovered a great resource a few months back: 
http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/

One post in particular, http://bit.ly/designers-developers , got me 
thinking about workign with designers.  Since we have no design staff in 
our shop per se (the technical office of an academic library), my PHP 
sidekick and I put together whatever designy elements we need for our sites.

After reading this article, I'm left wondering: what are the basics of 
working with designers?  I wasn't even familiar with the term "comp" 
that's being used in the post and comments.  Where can one learn the 
fundamental assumed communication patterns, role & workflow 
expectations, etc. that go along with this relationship?  What is a 
developer meant to do after being handed a PSD?

Many TIA!

Hi,

It seems to me that in the post you refer to below, the "designers" are 
confused about what a "developer" is.  A "developer" does not translate 
a PDF or comp or whatever they are calling it these days into an HTML 
page...that is a job for the production people in the Production 
department.

By the time this thing gets anywhere near a developer, it should 
already be laid out in HTML adequate to the designer's perspective, 
i.e. be a dead UI that needs to be brought to life by the magic of 
code.  OK most of the time the form code is rather sparse and needs to 
be enhanced, but that's fine.

I'd avoid like the plague any "designers" who think developers have 
time to waste doing Production layouts....what's next, I don't suppose 
they'd also like us to pick up their drycleaning? :)

That really depends on how your environment is set up.  If there is no
"Production department" then that very well may be the job of the
developer.  I work with one other 'developer' and one 'designer' on all of
our projects.  The designer hands us a PSD, and one of us is left to
translate it in to html/css/javascript.

Having separate departments / employees who handle things like PSD -> HTML
translations is great if you have it, but not everyone does.

I agree and understand, but also think that it benefits companies to 
separate out these duties.  A programmer is usually a very substandard 
graphic designer, and vice versa.  It's very fortunate that your 
company had the luck to find two programmers who not only are competent 
doing Production work but don't mind doing it...they may find their 
luck changing if the job market picks up methinks :)

    A "designer" can mean very different things.

    Some "designers" are very good at drawing and painting.  My wife,  
for instance,  occasionally does corporate identity work for smaller 
businesses that want a really original logo.  She prototypes with pencil 
and paper and only converts to a digital vector format late in the process.

    Other "designers" are good with tools like photoshop and 
illustrator.  Some of them can draw and some can't.  An eye for 
composition,  colors,  and choosing fonts can get you a long way.

    Most "designers" aren't that creative.  That's not a bad thing,  
because copying elements of other people's work helps create a 'design 
vocabulary' that people understand.  That's why so many cars you see in 
showrooms today steal the blockiness of the new Dodge Charger or the 
roofline of the Toyota Prius.  These elements communicate a message that 
people understand.  Movies are made up out of bits and pieces of older 
movies because it's quite difficult to tell a story visually in a way 
that viewers will understand if you don't build on shared experience.

    Some "designers" are great at making print material.  There's 
something to say for having a corporate identity that's consistent 
across print materials such as advertising and business cards and on the 
web.

    I know a "designer" who's an absolute CSS and HTML wizard;  He even 
knows a little PHP and Ruby on Rails.  I wouldn't trust him with data 
modeling,  but he's got a good sense of what's possible and what's 
maintainable on the web,  and he'll produce you a "look" that works on 
the web,  loads fast,  is compatible across browsers,  etc -- he's the 
best kind.

    A critique I have of a lot of designers I work with is that they 
tend to think in terms of static images,  not things that are 
parameterizable.  For instance,  not a single designer that I've worked 
with who's designed a login form has considered the question of "what 
does the login form look like if somebody enters the wrong password?"  
Often they're pretty puzzled when I push the design back to them with 
that question,  and,  except in one case,  I've always had to improvise 
an answer to that myself.

    I worked for 5 years at a very political sort of organization where 
my first task was converting the new homepage design (a PSD) to HTML,  
images and CSS.  It took some aggressive tricks to pull the design off 
and we were all proud of it when it was done.  Well,  the page aged 
poorly over 5 years,  and by the time I left that job I wasn't so sure 
if I wanted to point to it on my resume.  Every part of the organization 
wanted to have it's own link (or a bunch of links) on the home page and 
that pressure caused the site to degenerate rapidly -- it became a site 
for sore eyes.

    An excellent design anticipates that kind of change.

I find it bizarre that many web designers these days don't know or don't 
"do" HTML. Most annoying.

I beieve if you dont have production people then the designer should 
step up the plate instead punting this to your developers.

I think I misled you.  The "company" is only 3 people.  Me, the other
developer, and the designer.

The designer has absolutely no programming experience.  He's an art major
from college.  It would be much quicker and more efficient for us to take
the day to translate his work in to html than it would be for him to gain
the 6+ years that me and the other developer have in HTML/CSS/Javascript.

My point was - it depends on your situation.  Our situation doesn't allow
our designer to do it for us, so we do it.  It's not a huge deal, it's about
finding what works best between the people you have.

We have a team of developers here and we just launched a beta of a site 
re-design. We are just too busy dealing with site fixes and updates. 
Production is something which we feel belongs firmly in the designer's 
domain (HTML is not programming no matter what designer's say - they 
should know how to make their design work in HTML. In fact, a knowledge of 
HTML should inform their design process - the example of the login form 
is a good example of what happens when they don't understand that).

Yes, designers should have HTML experience. But the best designers
think visually, and need to have the freedom to do that.

By all means hire a front-end code wrangler to save your elite
programmers from tearing their hair out over IE6 compatibility, but I
would never expect a top-notch graphic designer to know the first
thing about good markup. There is no skillset overlap, you know?
Writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--that's coding, not design.

The only problem is when a designer comes up with a design that can't be 
expressed in HTML or doesn't work easily with your coding framework of 
choice. That's what I mean when I say the HTML knowledge should inform the 
design process too.

Exactly. When a designer takes on web work they have to learn the
limitations of the medium: web fonts for body text, no custom form
controls, no flowed text. I'm happy to educate anyone I'm working with
about what is a bad idea, what is really expensive, and what is
impossible.

It's not that bad, but you DO have to ask to review designs before
they are sent to the client.

And to the extent that we can expect people to have
standards-compliant browsers with javascript, very few designs are
actually impossible in HTML. Expensive to develop, perhaps, but not
impossible.

    Just as there's a difference in the skill sets of designers,  there 
are also differences in the skill sets of developers.  There's room for 
people on the continuum between design and software development:  for 
instance,  somebody can be a whiz in object-oriented design or a great 
data modeler and not know a damn thing about HTML.  There's a difference 
between the kind of developer who knows enough html to format a table 
and another developer who can understand why IE8 in "Standards Mode" 
doesn't work with the Google Maps API...

    Perhaps people are expecting more than they used to,  but there's an 
increasing amount of stuff to know about browser quirks these days,  and 
the person who can get everything to work down to the pixel consistently 
in all environments is good to have on the team.  That kind of person 
can be somebody who's basically a designer,  or somebody who's basically 
a developer.

That would be nice, but you rather should choose the tools that suit what you 
want to do, not the other way around. Way too much software is dumbed down or 
misdesigned just because some framework doesn't do this or that or the 
developer is too lazy to make it so. I encounter this plenty of times and like 
to call it "developer arrogance".
So if HTML doesn't work, use something else. Use Flash or Silverlight, or 
rethink the idea of making this app a browser based app. I am sure there are 
several other options. I heard the "VB cannot do that" whine way too often, no 
interest in hearing the "HTML cannot do that" whine. I know that HTML is 
limiting and that the stateless process is a pain in the rear at times. AJAX 
helps here a bit, but I think that heavy use of client side scripting makes 
for a bad end user experience.
Good that I mention that, it all comes down to what the user wants. Not what a 
designer or developer think what the user needs - or what the sales guy 
thought he remembered from the last phone call.

At the company where I work we have one developer who left the team of 
developers to focus solely on UI design, mainly for our browser based 
applications. He crafts the UI and using his developer knowledge crafts it so 
that the "behind the scenes" code is easily attached. But he no longer worries 
about how things are calculated, how they are stored in the database, or how 
the stored procedures work. He also often provides input for our desktop apps 
and it is amazing how much you can get from a really simple solution.

I also worked with designers at my previous job who took the more or less raw 
material and the embedded that into a UI. That was the exact opposite approach 
and there the designers prettyfied the rough, but working product.

Either way, the designer (meaning UI designer, not product designer) shouldn't 
just be a graphics artist or be treated as a sidekick. From product idea over 
coding, testing, UI design to sales and support get everyone involved from the 
beginning and have everyone fully understand what is supposed to get 
accomplished. If the project lead has no clear vision and there is no proper 
statement of scope, functional requirements, and tech specs you run into 
trouble, usually later than sooner. So when working with a designer clearly 
express expectations and document those. Rather spend a few hours more upfront 
to really get things nailed down. And there is also nothing wrong with drawing 
a picture or prototyping. Many people can't really grasp how something will 
look like, they need to see it, even if it is just a cheesy mockup.

I think you should rather educate everyone including yourself about what the 
end-user wants. It is well possible that the end-user doesn't need fancy stuff 
and eye candy, but unless you _are_ the end-user I'd be a bit careful about 
ironing over all this with the "we don't need this stuff" approach.

Clearly define what is asked for and required. That is why a business analyst 
should have no clue about coding, but know everything about the end-user / 
customer. And that for the same reason why developers make really bad software 
testers. First figure out what needs to be done and what needs to be 
accomplished, which is the point where everyone involved has a chance for 
input, but without loosing sight about, yes, you guessed it right, the 
end-user (which is often enough the paying customer). If after that there is 
still a need for custom form controls or flowed text (or whatever else) then 
so be it and it becomes irrelevant what the programmer thinks about it.

The vast majority of software created is not used by those who make the 
software, so who are they to say it has to be this or that way?

As someone who has worked (and continues to work) on both sides of the
fence I think I might be able to give you a few insights. Most of what
I'm about to say relates to professionally (though not necessarily
formally) trained graphic designers who offer web design services,
either as independent freelancers or as members of small design firms.

Before I get started: If your designer can't or won't provide a signed
written agreement that clearly spells out project scope, deliverables &
dates, then run away. Fast.

Workflow & Terminology

1. Discovery & Planning - This usually involves giving the client a
questionnaire (it may also referred to as a creative brief, creative
needs analysis, design brief, etc.) It covers things like existing
branding (if any), target audience, goals, expectations, look & feel,
and so on. Where web sites are concerned, there may also be a "technical
needs analysis" or "technical brief" (in the form of a separate section
or questionnaire) that covers questions about functionality, types of
media that may need to be displayed, etc.

2. Design - Brainstorming to come up with concepts (sometimes also
referred to as "concepting"). The client will usually be presented with
 2-3 comps (also known as roughs or mock-ups) representing what the
designer considers their best concepts. The client will then be asked
which design s/he prefers, and the designer will go through a couple
more revisions--sometimes incorporating elements from different
comps--before the design is finalized. Note: To avoid scope creep,
experienced designers will specify in their contract how many rounds of
revisions will be allowed, and will require sign-off on each round.

3. Production - Here's where it gets tricky. Make NO assumptions about
who is going to be doing the coding. If the designer is going to be
providing the HTML, then find out whether that means that the designer
will actually be doing the coding, or if it's going to be outsourced (to
understand why this is critically important, see Type I, below).

Type I - These are the web designers who know little or nothing about
coding and have no desire to learn. This is not a problem if you know
for a fact that the designer outsources to a skilled, trusted coder. If
you don't know and/or don't ask, then don't be surprised when you're
handed HTML pages created by a Photoshop plug-in like SiteGrinder, or
when you find that your coding has been outsourced to some less than
reputable 3rd party online rent-a-coder outfit that has produced
hopelessly buggy pages and then vanished into the night. *shudder*

Type II - These are the web designers who have basic coding skills. Use
caution with these designers as they often know just enough to be
dangerous. They haven't mastered things like modern best practices,
browser bugs, accessibility issues, semantic markup as it relates to the
separation content & presentation, etc. They tend to panic when they run
into things like cross-browser compatibility issues or the need for
advanced CSS techniques. I know this because I have pulled the backside
of more than one of them out of the fire when a deadline was looming.

Type III - These are the web designers who are knowledgeable about most
things code-related. Anything they don't know they will seek an answer
for quickly and efficiently, and they won't over-promise. They are well
versed in the areas where Type II is lacking and, if asked, can produce
a portfolio & references to prove it. They have the experience to know
when certain design elements might prove problematic, and they know how
to keep a project on track and within scope. These designers are in the
minority, but they're out there.

Type IV - These are the web designers who have have all the skills of
Type III, and also some degree of developer & back-end knowledge. These
designers are few and far between. They know that they're worth their
weight in gold and will charge accordingly.

Communication

This is the single biggest hurdle in any field, IMO. Graphic design,
whether for the web or print, is by its very nature a highly
collaborative process. A good designer should be able to communicate
effectively both visually AND verbally. If the client proposes something
that the designer feels will negatively impact a design, then the
designer should be able to explain why in terms the client can
understand. That being said, it's also incumbent upon the client to
provide timely, useful feedback. I'm sure you have all experienced how
difficult that can be to obtain at times. Lack of feedback not only
slows down the design process, but it can also quickly dampen the
designer's enthusiasm for a project, resulting in reduced creativity.

Last but not least, designers & developers need to respect each other's
professional expertise. I've met designers who are contemptuous of
coders & developers, seeing them as little more ill-tempered, geeky
"code monkeys" whose sole sense of taste lies in their mouths. Likewise,
I've met coders & developers who view designers as spoiled,
temperamental artistic types who deal in "make it pretty" fluff that
lacks any real importance. Sometimes both are true, but most of the time
not. Good design, like good web development, comes from years of
hard-won experience and dedication to craft.

Sorry for rambling on so long, but I don't often find a thread here that
I can contribute much to, so I got a bit carried away. I hope nothing
I've said comes across as preachy, and that some of you find it useful.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Advice on OOP & Frameworks
Message-ID: <4A90F358.3010405@nopersonal.info>

Hello ladies & gentlemen,

I've just purchased my first book on PHP Object-Oriented Programming and
 have also been looking at all the frameworks that abound. I'm unsure of
where to go from here.

To date (and by necessity) most of my projects have been pretty simple
and done in a shared hosting environment--e.g. last year I did my first
Drupal site, I recently rebuilt a custom content management system that
I inherited from someone else & debugged/completed a couple of years
ago, and I've written a maintenance contract expiration tracker for one
of our clients (which works but still needs to be polished)... Actually,
that's pretty much it aside from playing with stuff in my personal sandbox.

Due to my lack of programming experience, I've been doing things in a
less than elegant way and I suspect this is causing me a lot of extra
work, not to mention frustration. I'm loathe to move beyond my current
comfort zone, but I know I MUST if I'm going to make any progress.

Please bear in mind that my primary role is that of graphic/web
designer, therefore I'm unable to devote as much time to my PHP/MySQL
skills as I'd like.

Soooo anyway, I'm looking at the possibility of using a framework that
will work in a shared hosting environment and might help me develop
things faster by not having to re-invent the wheel every time.

Would CodeIgniter fit the bill? I have no idea how to judge which
framework might be best for me, and don't want to waste time learning
one that I'm going to outgrow 12 months from now. Should I even be
thinking about frameworks at this point, or would I be better off
reading through & understanding the OOP book first?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Bev

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Advice on setting for testing server
Message-ID: <4A910DB0.5040204@nopersonal.info>

Okay, one last batch of questions then I'll leave you guys alone for
another six months. ;-)

I recently set up my first LAMP stack using Ubuntu--it seemed like the
easiest option, and so far I love it. From now on this will be my local
testing server.

I've installed OpenSSH so I can practice "talking" to Linux & MySQL via
the command line from my primary computer. I intend to perhaps also
install up some sort of FTP & mail server, if for no other reason than
to understand how they work on the other end.

Aside from occasional shell access to remote servers and setting up cron
jobs I'm a total Linux noob, so this is a whole new world for me. I've
dealt with Apache .conf files a bit, and also with php.ini files. Not so
much with MySQL .cnf files.

At present, aside form having set passwords I'm still using the default
config files that were installed with Apache 2.2.11, PHP 5.26, MySQL
5.0.75, and phpMyAdmin 3.1.2. I'd like to turn off things that are
commonly disabled in shared hosting environments so that I don't
inadvertently use something that's not going to work on a production
server over which I have little or no control.

Do any of you have recommendations on configuration settings to use?

Which packages/extensions/modules should be installed/enabled?

Should I go ahead and turn off error reporting and enable it via my
scripts, or should I leave it on all the time? If I should leave it on,
at what level should I set it? E_ALL?

Are there any other settings or extensions that might be helpful someone
like me who's still prone to making rookie mistakes?

Would it be a good idea to use one php.ini file while I'm writing &
debugging my code, and then a second one for testing immediately prior
to moving to a production server? If so, how should they differ?

Would this be a good time to learn how to use CVS or Subversion?

As always, any advice is greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Bev

Let me add to the question while the smart folks are waking up. I'm a 
systems (Red Hat and Solaris) guy who sees the value in PHP/{My}SQL{ite} 
for keeping my friends web stuff going and making information available 
to the decision makers at work.

Currently I'm reading an old edition of "Web Database Applications with 
PHP and MySQL" and it's really helping me understand how things can be 
done. However, it doesn't use OOP, MVC, or frameworks like CakePHP, so 
there's obviously a grow step after this.

My mind translates Bev's comments to be asking for advice on a growth 
pattern. My path won't be as fast as Bev's since I don't PHP every day, 
but having a clear path would be good. O'Reilly has a 4 part PHP course 
but I'm not sure I have the $$ handy for that at the moment. I do have 
access to lots of O'Reilly books, but knowing which ones to skim and 
which to focus on would help.

Anyone up for drafting a "Recommended Learning Program" for PHP?

Thanks!

You may want to take a look at the popular XAMPP packages out there, most 
notably that from apachefriends (http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html). 
I think they have a sound and typical configuration. Although they don't 
recommend it, I used XAMPP for production use and know that this site still 
makes use of it. I never had any issues in the five years I ran with it.

> Which packages/extensions/modules should be installed/enabled?
That depends on what you need. I think anything that comes with a stock PHP 
install should be assumed to be available.

For a test server I'd say set it to E_ALL. You may get annoyed at times with 
messages, but better you get annoyed than someone else later.

> Are there any other settings or extensions that might be helpful someone

I don't think there is a removerookiemistakes extension. What you want to do 
is follow the best practices as much as possible and as much as known. That 
means make sure to protect against SQL injection, separate presentation from 
processing, and - in my opinion - always initialize every variable with a 
value at the top of the script (I include counters for loops as well) and add 
plenty of commentary. I ran into problems way too many times when I though i 
has a value  of 1 when in fact it was 0 or something entirely different. I 
write the commentary first, typically adding a lot of detail to those areas 
that I know are more difficult for me. It helps me figure out what I need to 
do and later what I did do. Same way it hopefully helps someone else. You may 
want to take a look at the format used by phpdoc. It really is a nice tool and 
works magic even with code not commented the expected format. Lastly, whatever 
you do, stick with it throughout the project. You may find later that there 
are better ways to do things, but I'd first get it working, then optimize 
keeping consistency across the board.

I'm not the typicaly PHP developer, but I'd think you want your test (and 
development?) sytem and production system to be configured the same. What 
purpose is there when you test on configuration A when in the end your 
production system uses configuration B? You may find things that would have 
failed on either configuration, but you really want to test what you are using 
in the end, not something else. There may be additions for debuggers or other 
tools that the core production use will not need, but unless it is a known 
security risk I'd leave it in. In the worst case of all you can still attach 
your development environment to the production server and debug from there.
I recommend to listen to those who do more development for the outside world. 
I'm a hobbyist and sadly, I seem also to be the only one who consumes my scripts.


> Would this be a good time to learn how to use CVS or Subversion?
YES! I'd recommend to go with Subversion, but you want to use some source 
control. At least make clearly labeled backups of your scripts. In the end you 
deal with flat files that can also be compressed very well, but a source 
control system allows you rolling back changes and branching code. Not that 
you couldn't do that manually as well, but attaching a project to a source 
control system will make you use it. Copy and paste doesn't.

I thought this was a perfect synopsis, and this point especially
stands out for me.  The production should be under the watchful eye of
the designer - whether they personally provide the production code or
it is outsourced.

Every design house worth their salt has a production specialist who
knows how to hand over clean presentation code that will work
perfectly on every browser.

The designer's job is to care that every pixel falls perfectly into
place, and the person handling production should answer to them.
Regardless of where your designer falls (in those 4 well spelled out
categories), you should receive quality final production html / css /
(sometimes js) that they've approved and are happy with before you
even begin integrating.

As for my experience, I started as a graphic designer (about 12 years
ago) and as a freelance PHP developer for 8 years, I've been fortunate
enough to work closely with some of the best and most talented
designers in the industry.

As a test server, errors can show site wide.  Personally, I stick with
E_ALL | E_STRICT, which can sometimes help with the "rookiemistakes"

Besides error reporting, I could not agree more.

You want version control as much of a habit as "Ctrl + S".  It can be
a pain at first and sometimes even seems silly when you start out and
develop on your own.  But it is Very nice to have an undo button that
reaches back all the way to the first line of code you've written.

Personally I'm a fan of the distributed apps (bazaar, git, mercurial).
 They have all the best parts of SVN and a few more goodies to boot.
I tend towards bazaar specifically for portability and simplicity, but
git seems to be the popular favorite.

Regardless of which, I can't stress enough how useful it is to have
code history.

Congratulations! I've always thought that system administration skills
are a necessary part of any web programmer's toolkit.

Read the online administration manuals for Ubuntu. Definitely read man
pages. No matter how dry they seem, the investment will pay off over
time.

You will definitely want a guide to Linux or Unix system
administration. Pro Linux System Administration was published in June,
and seems to successfully walk the line between the command-line and
point-and-click administration schools:
http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430219122

The classic guide to unix system administration is Essential System
Administration: http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596003432/

You could skip the FTP server and use SFTP, which you got for free by
installing OpenSSH. If you decide to set up FTP for the experience,
please make sure you use an SSL-enabled version. Ditto for your mail
services. Cleartext passwords are a strong indicator of an
irresponsible sysadmin.

Amen, and from your lips to the Department of Answering Programmers' 
Prayers' ears...because it's so true, any conversation containing the 
dreaded word "PIXEL" is not one we want to have.  Funny how they always 
act as though you're the first one to have the effrontery to tell them 
just exactly what they can DO... with their PIXEL... as IF. :>

I don't mind if the form code is a bit raw and I certainly don't insist 
on any scripting being provided, or on a full understanding of XHTML 
syntax as it may relate to what exactly I'm trying to do here, but for 
goodness' sake just hack something together, so that the forsaken 
PIXELs are all where they should be and we can all move on to the next 
step.

That way, if you don't hear from me with some utterly incomprehensible 
and probably completely insane concern about how your PIXEL just simply 
cannot reside in the precise place in the universe where you wish it to 
reside without causing undue havoc, you can assume that yes, your PIXEL 
is just exactly where you left it yesterday, safe and sound.

just not working"

I think many of us have come to that same fork in the road when making the 
move into frameworks. When I got into frameworks, I did read books on PHP 
OOP (the No Starch book is good). Since most frameworks use OOP and since 
they show no sign in going away, it is well worth reading up on OOP. Also, 
a book on design patterns probably would be useful too.

As to what framework is good, that is a very subjective question. But with 
your newly acquired OOP knowledge you will be in a much better place to 
judge how they work and which ones you're comfortable with. Basically, the 
best thing to do would be to look at a tutorial/demo for each one, follow 
each one, work through and see which one makes the most sense for *you*. 

Other things to consider: how much documentation is there? are they easy 
to read? are there any books? what are the mailing lists like? how active 
is development of the framework? in short, how good is the community 
around the framework?

Im not going to recommend any single one but Zend, CakePHP and symfony are 
pretty popular. When I made my choice, it was the excellent documentation 
and community that helped me decide.

It really depends on what you plan to do.
I'd suggest you Symfony and Zend Framework, but each have different
approaches and different purposes.

Symfony is de-facto a framework. This means all CRUD stuff is
automagically generated to you. I'd suggest you to use Doctrine as ORM
tool to use as part of model layer. It's a great framework, extremely
easy to get basic stuff running, but quite difficult if you require a
higher level of granularity.

Zend Framework is a class library that can easily act as a MVC
framework. This means you're able to create any type of application
using a standard and WELL organized way to build it. I'd suggest you
to use it for not CRUD applications (which means admin with list, add,
remove, edit for each entity). It is quite easy to change source to do
what you want,but it may also require little more efforts to get
things done first.

I have karma on both projects and I already used both frameworks. On
current project, I work with Zend Framework.

Cheers,

Most of these packages come with pretty sensible config settings so I 
probably would *not* mess with them without knowing the consequences.

That kind of depends on what software you're writing dont you think? Some 
frameworks will need additional extensions and tweaks to Apache so there 
is no simple fits-all rule. The other thing to consider is that any 
changes you make should be easy to maintain and put back after a software 
update. (In the case of Apache I tend to leave the main config alone since 
any changes will likely be overwritten when the software is updated). IIRC 
Ubuntu has something like a sites-enabled/sites-available folder where you 
can put vhost files (one per vhost is good practice). I usually create a 
file called ALL that contains any global config tweaks.

If you're using a framework it might already do all that for you and maybe 
provide its own config file for you to tweak that in.

Firebug is good on the browser side (also look at the Web Developer 
Toolbar and the YSlow extension for Firebug). On the server side look at 
FirePHP and Xdebug extensions for PHP.

Again, I personally would not mess with it too much unless there is a very 
good reason. All the caveats about maintenanced and updates apply there 
too. Some frameworks might need a few tweaks though but cross that bridge 
when you get to it.

> Would this be a good time to learn how to use CVS or Subversion?

All developers should be using version control. Subversion is very popular 
but Git is also becoming so these days.

Wise words - and based on Bev's design background I'm going to also
mention Silverstripe, which is a CMS built upon the Sapphire
framework. What makes Silverstripe unique from the usual suspects is
that it goes into a page-centric design approach, meaning you write
page templates for different types of content. Probably would feel
completely natural to someone coming over from design and production.

Ultimately you have different types of frameworks to choose from, with
specific characteristics:

* glue frameworks - like Zend and Joomla 1.5, glue frameworks allow
you to glue together just the stuff you need to get things done. They
are known to scale and perform very well, as you only incur
performance hits for code you actually use. They also promote a Do It
Yourself (DIY) attitude, as you ultimately decide what legos you
choose to stack, and how to stack them.
* stack frameworks - like CakePHP and Symfony, stack frameworks are
the whole enchilada, providing developers with a rich suite of
features to rapidly prototype. Stacks are usually fastest for
prototyping and throwing code together, but are known to be more
difficult than glue frameworks to customize to specific needs. Some
say scale and performance are also issues, however your mileage may
vary ;-)

I like both styles of frameworks for different reasons, and there are
emerging projects like Kohana (really cool!) and Silverstripe/Sapphire
that have modern approaches. Both merit a serious gander, IMHO.

As long as you pick one (or three) of these frameworks to play with,
you will be forced in one way or another to make the leap into OO
programming. The old Sitepoint books (PHP Anthology) and PHP5 Power
Programming were good books for getting an understanding of solid OO
practices.

I believe this is well-intentioned but misguided advice.  I assert  
that it more about "how you like to work" than it is about "what you  
plan to do".

You can do pretty much the same things in one framework as you can in  
another.  Some particular tasks may require more workaround effort  
than others in each different framework, but none of them will prevent  
you from doing any particular task.

What you *cannot* do is change the fundamentals of how the framework  
wants *you* to work.  Each framework makes assumptions about how you  
should structure your approach to the work you need to do.  Each one  
imposes a different kind of structure to your work.  Once you know how  
you like to do things, the best framework for your style of working  
will become obvious after you examine them.

For an expanded take on this theme, you may wish to read my article  
from last year's PHP Advent, "The Framework As Franchise."

Hello everyone,

This mangesh Sathe ,India.

I have one problem in db connectivity
how to connect to an Access database *.mdb with a DSN and without a DSN.

I trying to do it on php 5.1 but on other sites it's maintioned that it
work's only on 4.x .

sample code is,

$db = 'C:\\Program Files\\Northwind.mdb';

$conn = new COM('ADODB.Connection') or exit('Cannot start ADO.');
// Two ways to connect. Choose one.
$conn->Open("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0; Data Source=$db") or
exit('Cannot open with Jet.');
//$conn->Open("DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)}; DBQ=$db") or
exit('Cannot open with driver.');

Waiting yours Reply

Thanku very much

Just a shot in the dark here, but you'd probably want to move the 
Access database onto a web server from your local C drive.

Also, from my recollection, DSNs are only useful if you are connecting 
through the Windows OS, so you'd have to use the full Connection 
String, i.e. a DSN-less connection, to connect on the fly through PHP.

There shouldn't be any reason that I can see why they discontinued 
support for this in PHP 5.x...

I just wanted to point out that symfony can be used both ways (i.e. as a 
glue and as a full stack), because its main components are pretty loosely 
coupled and can be used separately outside the framework:

http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2008/06/23/the-symfony-1-1-architecture

You can also use Zend components with symfony if you like:

http://devzone.zend.com/article/1957-Using-Zend_Lucene-Inside-of-symfony

There is also a long-term plan to release symfony components with docs:

http://components.symfony-project.org/

As far as scalability goes, look at Yahoo Bookmarks, delicious and 
DailyMotion for examples of big symfony sites.

I've developed one major project (in progress) and one smaller one in 
symfony, both "standard" MySQL-based apps, the major one having (I 
think) a complex data model & business logic.  It's been great for us, 
and good documentation, too.

I recently worked on a project to build a new frontend on an ancient 
open-source digital collection management system.  Because this project 
has its own peculiar data-storage mechanisms (not your normal 
database-backed system), I looked for something more open-ended, and 
ended up going with CodeIgniter.

I found the PHP4 mix of quasi-OOP and magical function calls out of thin 
air [e.g. get_instance() ] to be a bit bizarre.  It was only in the 
course of working on this project, and identifying certain issues in 
developing it, that I was prepared to read Zandstra's PHP Objects and 
really start to "get" the OOP patterns philosophy.

I then heard about Kohana, which is a (more?) strictly OOP, PHP5 port of 
CodeIgniter.  This answered my problems with CI's quirks; now, armed 
with my enhanced OOP understanding and Kohana, I have in the plans to 
rewrite my app in Kohana, when my shop's schedule allows.

Hi Mangesh:

PHP connects to Access databases via the odbc_connect() function.  The 
$dsn parameter is the (simple, human readable) "Data Source Name" you've 
assigned to the resource in Windows' ODBC Data Source Administrator.

Try making a simple test script that uses odbc_connect().  Once you get 
that working, then try to bring ADODB into the mix.

i personally like codeigniter, though i guess there is an offshoot framework now that's catching steam, which is built off of codeigniter, kohana. ?i've worked with zend last year when researching frameworks, as well as cakephp, but i still liked codeigniter for it's ease of doing things, as well as having a great community to ask questions - meaning the forums on the codeigniter site is very active and you're guaranteed to get a response to your questions. again, this is my personal preference and i do see similarities between all the mentioned frameworks and there are modules modeled after zend libraries that are ported to work in codeigniter and kohana, so they have to be doing something right with their framework to be a basis of these modules.




i think if i were doing a large enterprise project that had sufficient budget and development time, i'd go with zend or a custom cakephp framework with the use of zend libraries for security reasons, but for the average development of websites or quick projects, i think codeigniter is the way to go; or perhaps kohana since it's built off of codeigniter.






i hope this was helpful and not taken as gospel :)




thanks,

~rob

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Advice on OOP & Frameworks








Hello ladies & gentlemen,

I've just purchased my first book on PHP Object-Oriented Programming and
 have also been looking at all the frameworks that abound. I'm unsure of
where to go from here.

To date (and by necessity) most of my projects have been pretty simple
and done in a shared hosting environment--e.g. last year I did my first
Drupal site, I recently rebuilt a custom content management system that
I inherited from someone else & debugged/completed a couple of years
ago, and I've written a maintenance contract expiration tracker for one
of our clients (which works but still needs to be polished)... Actually,
that's pretty much it aside from playing with stuff in my personal sandbox.

Due to my lack of programming experience, I've been doing things in a
less than elegant way and I suspect this is causing me a lot of extra
work, not to mention frustration. I'm loathe to move beyond my current
comfort zone, but I know I MUST if I'm going to make any progress.

Please bear in mind that my primary role is that of graphic/web
designer, therefore I'm unable to devote as much time to my PHP/MySQL
skills as I'd like.

Soooo anyway, I'm looking at the possibility of using a framework that
will work in a shared hosting environment and might help me develop
things faster by not having to re-invent the wheel every time.

Would CodeIgniter fit the bill? I have no idea how to judge which
framework might be best for me, and don't want to waste time learning
one that I'm going to outgrow 12 months from now. Should I even be
thinking about frameworks at this point, or would I be better off
reading through & understanding the OOP book first?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Bev

I'm guessing your error handler is in the same directory that you're 
blocking, so Apache isn't letting you anywhere near executing the PHP 
code inside your PHP error handler script.

Put your error handler in the top most directory of the document root, 
say "/auth_error.php".  In directories you want protected, have the 
following in your .htaccess files:

    ErrorDocument 401 /auth_error.php
    ErrorDocument 403 /auth_error.php

That's good to know. I love doing both, but don't run across many people
who feel the same.

I registered for the NYC CodeWorks conference this weekend, so I hope
I'll get to meet some of you in October.

That sounds like a great idea, Leam. I'd be willing to work on it to the

Maybe we can start a new thread about that, or talk with the more

 Yikes! I showed my boss the results of a script that took a 400-800 page report and put it into a 10 page synopsis. Now he wants it sortable by host name, adding a couple click boxes, and linking to a personell list that's still being formed. And by end of week! Did I mention I'm a server guy and not a real programmer?  :)

I have some ideas but man it's going to be a fun challenge...

Some years ago I took the SAGE list for systems administrators as a set of goals. It broke down what sorts of things you should be able to do as a beginner, intermediate, and advanced sysadmin. Not everyone does their best with a structure but I certainly do.

Main things are what sorts of things folks should be able to do at what levels. The "Apprentice", "Journeyman", and "Master" levels work for lots of things, but what would each person need to be able to do?

Ok, now I gotta pimp a book. Pragmatic Thinking and Learning, by
Pragmatic Publishers:

http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning

They mention the Dreyfus model of competence levels, which is an
awesome read in itself. I encourage everyone to read this book, it
will certainly change the way you think, the way you assess your own
skills, and evaluate others.

I'd consider that an awesome start.

I hope responding to everyone in one email won't be considered rude, but
 it seemed to be easier than making everyone open half a dozen emails.

Ajai - Thanks for the great info on frameworks (esp. the OOP part) and
for the advice on what to look for.

Guilherme - CRUD, ORM, MVC... so many terms & concepts I need to learn!
Thanks for the specific info on Symfony & Zend and which situations
they're best for.

Paul - Excellent advice and article. I've bookmarked you site and some
of the other articles you linked to. Thanks!

Mitch - Thanks for the heads-up on Silverstripe, but even more so for
the definitions of glue & stack frameworks--that was a HUGE help.

Yitzchak - Thanks for adding your experiences. I think Ajai was
right--getting a basic understanding of OOP will probably help me figure
out what will work best for both me & my future projects.

Rob - I ran across mention of Kohana when googling for info on
CodeIgniter, and both sound like things that might work well for me.
Thanks for sharing what you found in your search for a framework--it's
really helpful to hear other people's experiences.

Well, it looks like I've got some new homework to do. Thanks again to
all of you for your patient advice. You're the best!

Regards,

Bev

Wow, that must have taken some work. I like structure myself, as long as
it's not too rigid. I only wish there'd been more of it when I was first
learning to do front-end coding years ago.

I keep a simple web design reading list online for print designers & and
aspiring coders/web designers that come to some of the forums I
participate in. It's an easy way to point them toward the kinds of
things they'll need to know, but I really like your "levels" approach.

I've also developed a couple of checklists for things like launching
(static) web sites and migrating dynamic sites. The latter is revised
each time I (screw up and) learn something new about PHP/MySQL & other
back-end issues.

installation, and keep error reporting set to E_ALL.

Yeah, making manual backups is tedious and I've messed things up doing
it that way on more than one occasion. *sigh*

I guess I've been avoiding the whole version control thing because it
sounded a little scary, but it sounds like something that could be a
real lifesaver, so I guess I need to get over myself and just do it.

I couldn't agree more--the need for it has become clearer & clearer as I
 inch my way forward. The company I work for is an outfit of network
security consultants, so my boss is totally on board with me learning
more about Linux sys admin skills.

Now that I've had a couple of weeks to poke around in Ubuntu's innards,
I find it fascinating. Now Windows kinda is starting to seem like
Linux's idiot cousin.

Still, it's a big paradigm shift for me, you know? Last week it took me
like 2 hours to figure out how to gain write access to a mounted logical
drive because I wasn't grasping the whole ownership/users/groups thing.
Now it makes more sense and I can see why it's more secure.

LOL, yeah, I usually tend to just jump in with both feet, but that's
clearly NOT going to work in this case. Linux is just too different form
what I'm accustomed to for that approach to work.

Duh--I didn't even realize SFTP came with OpenSSH. *headdesk* I've
managed to connect now using PuTTY, so thanks for pointing that out. I
guess I'll forgo the FTP & mail services for now since the Ubuntu box is
on my home LAN and I don't really need them.

I also managed to set up my computer's wake-on-lan feature. It's so cool
to be able to control the web server from any computer in my apartment
(I work from home and don't foresee any need to access it from outside
my LAN). I have a mostly wired network with my single wireless access
point & laptop set up by one of our engineers to ensure that it was
secure, so I guess that should be good enough.

Firebug, YSlow, and the Web Developer Toolbar have been my best friends
for front-end work for quite some time. I've seen the FirePHP & Xdebug
extensions but didn't really understand how to use them, so I just
ignored them. Now that you've mentioned them I'll go back and give them
a closer look.

I have a single table, with about 20 fields, 2 enum's, etc.  I'm looking 
for a simple tool that can wrap a form around this table and allow people 
to update/edit it.  I feel phpmyadmin would work but it's way too complex 
for this project.

Any suggestions?

I switched over from Windows a couple of years ago. I'm not a pro, but I 
found a few things that were frustrating for me as I switched distros or 
got a new machine.

Here's my advice that others have not already covered.
1) Take the time to figure out how to move your /home to another partition.

2) I use E_ALL | E_STRICT. Then you know you're good regardless of the 
production server settings.

3) Find a way to reproduce the environment on your machine. This caused 
me no end of headaches at first because it took me days to finally 
remember all of the applications I needed installed and figuring out how 
they were configured different.

I created two files. The first is a shell script that installs all of 
the applications I use, changes settings/permissions and makes copies of 
config files. Then you've always got your back covered. The second is 
instructions and information about how to manually change things that 
need to be manually changed. (config files, etc) . The only trick is 
being religious about updating the files every time you 
install/configure applications. However, this made my last hardware 
upgrade go wickedly fast.

So for LAMP I've got this:
(script)

    sudo tasksel install lamp-server
    #extensions
    sudo apt-get install -y sendmail php-pear php5-mysql php5-ldap
    php5-xsl php5-xdebug php5-curl php5-mcrypt
    sudo mkdir /var/lib/php5/session
    sudo chgrp www-data /var/lib/php5/session
    sudo chmod g+w /var/lib/php5/session


    sudo pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    sudo pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
    sudo pear install phpunit/phpcpd
     
    cd /etc/php/apache2
    sudo cp php.ini php.ini.original

    cd /etc/mysql
    sudo cp my.cnf my.cnf.original


(config)

    cd /etc/php5/apache2/
    gksudo gedit php.ini &
    # see php.ini.diff
    diff php.ini php.ini.original > ~/howtos/php.ini.diff

    cd /etc/mysql/
    gksudo gedit my.cnf &
    # see my.cnf.diff
    diff my.cnf my.cnf.original > ~/howtos/my.cnf.diff

Where php.ini.diff looks like this:
390c390
< error_log = /localhost/web_logs/php_errors.txt
---
 > ;error_log = filename
1007c1007
< session.gc_maxlifetime = 14400
---
 > session.gc_maxlifetime = 1440

Yes! This is a great piece of advice, and not immediately obvious to
folks who are new to command line administration. Even if you mix your
instructions and commands, being able to copy and paste the commands
in order saves a LOT of time and allows you the full benefit of your
collected wisdom and experience.

It's a good idea to set up a wiki for your personal use as a sysadmin,
to store recipes like this, and make them easy to update with each new
install. The only thing worse than spending hours getting a
configuration exactly right is realizing two years later that you
didn't paste-and-save it anywhere.

I saw a reference to that the other day while searching for something
else and made a mental not that I needed to come back to it. The fact
that you've pointed out it's importance is a big help. I think I'll make
that my next thing to learn.

Joelle, thank you soooo much for sharing this--you've undoubtedly saved

I've been meaning to do that for the longest time for browser bugs &
such. As a matter of fact, I even set up a a couple of wikis at one
point and then abandoned them because I didn't care for the way they
worked.

I guess now would be the optimal time to start over as I'll likely be
tripping myself up quite a bit during the learning process.

Do you have any recommendations on a good one to use?

Bev

Here's a very crude SQL package I made when I started working with PHP oh 
so many years ago.

Bev:

Me too -- I'm a one man band combining graphic design, html, css, 
javascript ajax, php and mysql all rolled into one while observing 
best practices, unobtrusive and semantic code, and addressing W3C 
compliance and accessibility issues.

In other words, there's a lot to know to get it right. I can see how 
the division of responsibility can become blurred in a team 
environment while working on large projects. Fortunately for me, my 
projects don't normally exceed $20k and that appears to be a nice 
cut-off for me.

In my experience, projects that are larger can go to a team, those 
smaller can be handled by one person.

Cheers,

I maintain a wiki that other people have to use, so I use MediaWiki,
because it's pretty unlikely that there's anyone I'm likely to work
with that is unfamiliar with the layout and features it offers,
because of wikipedia's prevalance.  It's relatively easy to install
and hack at, so I'd recommend it.

Yep.  Great advice.  Shell scripts are an amazing way to save time and 
improve accuracy.

And I bet you can script even more of the process.  For example, you were 
saying you manually edit your config files.  There are two ways to 
automate config file modifications.

1) Have a copy of the config file in your version control system 
(subversion, cvs, git, etc) that your installation script exports and 
copies into place.

2) Have a unified diff (diff -u php.ini-production php.ini > ini.diff) of 
your configuration file in your version control system that your shell 
script exports then calls:

patch -i ./ini.diff $php_path/php.ini-development -o $php_path/php.ini

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Input as array names
Message-ID: <80BACF7E-9FD0-4E3D-8130-C6A6C0530D02@mimectl>

 Okay, here's one of the places I don't really get and can use some help on. On my text processing script I'm going to slurp up host names. They come in as the first, counting from 0, element. I can explode and create the array, which gives me a string:

$hostname[1] = somehost.example.com

I can safely get rid of the ".example.com" bit, leaving $hostname[1] as "somehost". What I need to understand is how to take $hostname[1] and make it an array in it's own right so I can assign it a list of numbers. 

For example, my text file looks something like this:

Bug ID:  1234
Affected Machines:
  somehost1
  somehost2.example.com
  somehostwehavenotseeninyears.example.com

Bug ID:  3456
Affected Machines:
  somehost1
  somehostwehanvenotseeninyears.example.com

At the end I need to print out something like this:

somehost1:  1234, 3456
somehost2:  1234
somehostwehavenotseeninyears:  1234 3456

Recommendations for a neophyte PHP'r?

Thanks!

With variable variable names,

if $hostname[1] = somehost

$$hostname[1] = array();

now you have an array named $somehost

Or
$hosts[$hostname[1]] = array($bugID1, $bugID2 ...)

foreach( $hosts as $key=>$value){
     echo "$key : ". implode(',' , $value);
}

I have a photography client who uploads images with iptc metadata. I

browser resize with the original image but I'd rather store resized

Any reason you couldn't use http://php.net/iptcembed to embed the data
into the new resized image?

You have got two problems here:

Most TZ databases are going to be LatLon specific, so, you'll have to
convert an address (City, State, Country) to geolocation
(latitude/longitude), Google and Yahoo have services for that.

Then you'll have to convert the Lat Long to a timezone, using this:

www.geonames.org/export

http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html#timezone

Hope that helps!

Also, you could just ask your users to supply their timezone... didn't

uhh, nothing beyond ignorance ;-( though it does seem a bit clumsy to 
take it out, resize, and then put it back in. Thanks!

Arrays are a powerful tool.

Once you get the hang of it, you can do almost anything.

Notice that some of them have named keys.

Anyway, I remember when I first started using arrays, especially with  
named keys, and the world of possibilities
that they opened up. So I thought I would share this...

Hope it helps.

(then find a good tutorial/book and use your imagination...)

glenn

  $myarray[1][0] = 'somekey';
  $myarray[1][]   = '1234';
  $myarray[1][]   = '5678';
  $myarray[1][]   = '9101112';

  print "example a\n";
  print_r($myarray);

print "example b\n";
print_r($myarray[1][1]);
print "\n";

// or
$myarray = array(
      'somekey' => array()
  );

  $myarray['somekey'][] = '1234';
  $myarray['somekey'][] = '5678';
  $myarray['somekey'][] = '910112';

print "example c\n";
print_r($myarray['somekey']);
print "example d\n";
print_r($myarray['somekey'][1]);
print "\n";

  //or

$myarray = array(
      'somekey' => array(
              'someotherkey' => array(),
              'anotherkey' => array()
      )
  );

  $myarray['somekey']['someotherkey'][] = '1234';
  $myarray['somekey']['someotherkey'][] = '5678';
  $myarray['somekey']['someotherkey'][] = '910112';

  $myarray['somekey']['anotherkey'][] = 'aaaa';
  $myarray['somekey']['anotherkey'][] = 'bbbb';
  $myarray['somekey']['anotherkey'][] = 'cccc';

  print "example e\n";
  print_r($myarray['somekey']);
  print "example f\n";
  print_r($myarray['somekey']['someotherkey']);
  print "example g\n";
  print_r($myarray['somekey']['anotherkey']);

Output from the above code is;

example a
Array
(
     [1] => Array
         (
             [0] => somekey
             [1] => 1234

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Advice on setting for testing server
Message-ID: <1251244504.28166@coral.he.net>

Hi, sorry if this was covered anywhere previously in this thread, but 
I've found it useful, in addition to enabling the full error reporting 
that's built into PHP, to also add customized error_log calls anywhere 
where you have such things as database inserts/updates, web service 
request/response or other behind-the-scenes text generation or 
processing, or any other areas of the application which you feel are 
extremely performance intensive, bug-prone or hard to monitor using 
more generic error messages.

Set it up so that you can toggle this function on/off in one place 
before turnover to production, so that you can leave in all your calls 
to error_log for future use.

Your error_log file on the server will quickly grow to enormous 
proportions, but since it's only a test server, it won't be a worry!  
By doing this you can build a history of the application's behavior and 
performance and verify that everything is exactly as it should be.

Right now I'm working with the Paypal IPN code and I'm finding that 
it's quite a creative experience to figure out what, in any particular 
instance, is the highest level of valuable information you can wreak 
out of some code by dint of the old error_log function...I'd love to 
see some error handling examples from people on this list which are 
undoubtedly leaps and bounds above what I've got going on here...!!

All in pseudo code, because I'm not doing your work for you.

// Populate the array..
$hosts = array();
foreach (line in file) {
   // Put code to grab bug numbers up here...

   // Once you get to the host name lines...
   $hosts[$name][] = $bug_id;
}

Now you'll have an array like this:

$hosts = array(
    1234 => array(
       'somehost1',
       'somehost2.example.com',
       'somehostwehanvenotseeninyears.example.com',
    ),
    3456 => array(
       'somehost1',
       'somehostwehanvenotseeninyears.example.com',
    ),
);

Finally, you can loop over $hosts and implode, as per someone else's 
posting upstream in this thread.

Of course server scripts and configs should also be in a version control 
system. I use svnrepository.com (I think its $8/month for unlimited 
projects up to a couple Gb). You can set up a repo for each project but 
more importantly you can also click and create a Trac instance for each 
project. Trac of course has a wiki, source browsr and ticket system. Even 
though for some projects Im the only user, its great to click and document 
stuff as you go using the wiki, or even open tickets to yourself to remind 
you to fix something.

Ive thought about switching to Git but I haven't found something similar 
that is better value for money ($8/month buys me peace of mind :-).

If you're using a framework, they often already have excellent error 
logging and stack tracing. Also I think FirePHP integrates with pretty 
much all of the major frameworks now so that's a good option.

XDebug is worth checking out too.

If your VCS of choice doesn't have a wiki, you might want to look at 
pbworks.com.

(Sure, I could grab some open source and install it on my own hardware but 
not having to waste time or worry about maintaining a server allows me to 
focus more of my energy on the current project).

My experience has been that often designers dont think of developer's as 
creative peers. Its a different kind of creativity and its not just laying 
code in a pre-determined order - there are often many ways to accomplish 
the same functionality. Coming up with an elegant and maintainable 
architecture is also very important.

More timing...or synchronicity...

As we discuss the learning path and stages, I've heard that ONLAMP will 
not really continue. I mentioned ONLAMP's aged articles to you a few 
months ago and was all hyped about upgrade and reform. ONLAMP has helped 
me in several ways and it's nice to have links to go back to as I try to 
understand sub-topics.

NYPHP has PHundamentals. Not as extensive as ONLAMP, but with more 
growth potential. Also, I will note that not only do I not live in or 
near the City but yesterday I pointed a PHP newbie to this list as a 
great resource. If you want somewhere culturally and economically, if 
not geographically, distant from NYC, come on down to SW Ga for a visit!

So the question on personal growth seems to have an option of expanding 
the NYPHP sphere of influence. With ONLAMP receding is this a good time 
to grow the PHundamentals and NYPHP? Or are there other places and 
portals to fill ONLAMP's shoes?

Are you too big for the Micro or Small plans at http://github.com/plans ?

And that piece of mind comes because they allow you to download a full 
"svnadmin hotcopy" backup of the repository so when svnrepository.com 
goes out of business you're not SOL, right?

I agree 100%. For many designers--at least the ones I have met--any kind
of coding or programming is anathema. They see it as something dry &
tedious, restrictive, confusing, and totally alien in its intangibility.
I suppose that's partly because designers' creativity is by nature
visually oriented, whereas programming requires more of a... I'm not
sure what to call it... maybe creativity of logic?

Both disciplines have sets of rules, and the most creative in both camps
know how to break them in a way that leads to something new & better.
It's too bad that there's often so much misunderstanding and friction
between the two--it's sort of like beauty of form vs. beauty of
function. IMO, the best applications embody both by being so elegantly
designed (both visually & functionally) that they are nearly
invisible--i.e. they allow the end user to perform tasks without having
to spend a bunch of time trying to figure out how things work.

Actually I see now that svnrepository.com have a new control panel at 
sourcerepo.com that offers svn, git and Mercurial so I guess I can 
just switch to Git when Im ready.

All of the normal svn and Trac commands are available.

So true.

Good for you for being able to do it all! There is indeed a lot to know
to get it right. I don't usually think about it until someone walks into
a forum and says, "I want to do web design. What steps do I need to
take?" the first thing I tell them is that they need to be insatiably
curious, love learning new things, make Google their best friend, and
learn how to ask questions the right way.

That is IF they even have enough sense to ask. Most times it's more like
a demand: "I need to do X, Y and Z by the end of the month, but I have
neither the time nor the desire to learn anything technical. Tell me how
to accomplish this ASAP!" Umm...sorry, my magic wand is in the repair
shop, so I'm afraid I can't help you.

Thanks for the compliment, Daniel. I introduced myself and gave some of
my background back when I first joined the list.

*blinks* Huh? The nopersonal.info domain is registered to me (albeit
privately), and the email address I use for this forum it a real one.
Anyone who wants to contact me directly is more than welcome to do so
any time.

Bev is my given name, although I do have a Muslim name that I usually go
by (I converted 18 years ago). I haven't provided my last name, phone
number, or the name of the company I work for, but that's because this
list is indexed by search engines and I don't want that info floating
around out there.

What else? I don't go to the monthly meetings because the NJT train
station by my apartment is a local stop and the trains tend to run few &
far between, making it impractical for me to attend in terms of the
travel time required. I'll be attending the CodeWorks conference in
October and am hoping that I'll get a chance to meet some of you there.
Does that help a little?

Bev

Yeah, that's one of the ones I installed before, but since it's just me
working on the web design & webdev projects, it seemed like overkill.
Thanks for taking the time to respond though.

Yesterday I found a knowledge base script <http://68kb.com/> that I
think might work for me, so I'm going to install it and try it out for a
week or two.

I actually like the part of maintaining a server, especially now because
I still have so much to learn in that area. I'll definitely bookmark
pbworks.com though.

Hi, Kristina. Thanks for chiming in with additional great advice!

I need to organize the info everyone has provided this week so that I
can form a game plan going forward. I have no doubt all these tips will
prove invaluable in improving my productivity.

Hi Bev,

Another good tip someone gave me is to train yourself to automatically 
back up any file by adding the date in format _20090826 to the filename 
before you edit or overwrite it, and that way you can always roll back 
your files and have a day by day history of the code.

Again like with your log file, it will grow and soon you will have 16 
different copies of each active file on your test server.  But it's 
simple, free and most importantly EASY TO INSTALL :)

And in terms of tracking "to do" items, I just keep a text file in each 
active project in which I keep detailed notes and to do punchlists and 
etc.  

I lack patience for stuff that is needlessly complex as I've always 
been a "brute force by text editor" type of programmer.  I just try to 
follow the "KISS" method, and avoid as many hazards as possible.  And I 
would certainly hesitate to hold myself out as a "productivity guru" -- 
I tend to work in fits and starts and be insanely productive some days, 
and then other days it just isn't really working for me so much...

Love Ajai's suggestion for XDebug but fear the installation 
documentation may be my undoing! :)

Well, I'll be darned.  I just assumed it was made up because it sounds 
obfuscatory.  Thanks for the correction.

Or you can use git. It's easier, and much, much cleaner.

Wow, we could write a unix tips book from this thread.

I started using git to track changes to DNS zone files a few months
ago, and it works great.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Dynamically Add Links to Text
Message-ID: <a9caffe50908270704p724ff6b9m76c6aea802409ac8@mail.gmail.com>

In one of our applications, we have a need to apply inline links to
the text, and would like to figure out a way to do this dynamically. I
have looked for this high and low, but haven't been able to find what
I am looking for. Perhaps I am searching the wrong keywords.

What we have is a repository of 1,000 articles. Each article has a
unique title. If the title of that article appears in another article,
we want to apply a link to the text, but only the first instance of
the text.

My thought is that we have to:

1. create an array of all titles
2. create a variable that holds the article text
3. loop through the title array and search the article text for a match
4. the first instance that a match is found, append the link and
update the string variable

The trick is that when a new article is added, they system needs to
automatically go back to all of the existing articles and run through
this process, which I don't like, because this won't be 100% accurate
in the editor's eyes. each updated article needs to be reviewed. I
also think it would cause a performance hit and dramatically slow down
the system, especially in one installation where we have nearly 4,000
record that would need to be updated.

Personally, it seems to me that JavaScript is a better solution here,
and to simply append those links when the page loads. Unfortunately,
these sites all have to comply with Section 508 and other
accessibility guidelines, so that might not be an acceptable solution.

Any suggestions?

I think the best way to tackle this would be look for titles of articles
when you posting a new article and just update the text when the editor is
going to save the article.  Since you can store the title of articles as a
field in your database, you can then go and quickly find if the article
contains the title and just do a simple replace.

Using JS is not going to work to your advantage since the dosent need to be
dynamic all the time (that can also lead to bugs).  Just update the article
at the time of saving saves processes in the long run and prevents cross
browser issues that can come up in JS.

    That shouldn't be a problem.  I just a ran a script that updated 
40,000 records (doing something of similar complexity) that completed in 
about 10 seconds.  If it was 4 million records,  then I might worry a 
little about performance.

    If reviewing by editors is important,  you can do this as a workflow 
system.  There's a couple ways to do it,  but basically you scan through 
the database looking for records that your system would like to update:  
rather than updating the actual records,  you insert a row into a table 
that indicates that this item should be reviewed:  the table could have 
a column that holds the new text.

    Then you write a script that shows the editor the first article that 
could be changed:  the editor then has the option to (i) accept the 
change,  (ii) edit the text,  or (iii) not accept the change.

    Currently I'm working on a system where documents get changed by 
automatic processes,  contractors,  employees,  and web users.  There's 
quite a lot of thinking of the above sort in there.

Bev:

I know what you mean. For me, clients basically fall into two groups: 
a) Those who tell me what they want; b) And those who tell me how to 
do what they want. I work well with (a), but have problems with (b).

When it comes to teaching (I do teach at college level), there are 
very few students/clients who fully realize all that's involved in 
developing a web site. Many think, as I've been told "It's easy -- my 
son learned HTML in high school" while they are totally clueless. The 
most problematic students/clients are the ones who have some 
experience with HTML and think that's all there is.

Here's a couple of links that I often tell clients to review:

http://sperling.com/web-developer.php

http://sperling.com/four-things-clients-should-know.php

Furthermore, the number of actual web developers out there who do 
know how to program in all the web languages (i.e., namely html, css, 
javascript, php, mysql, et al) to create a truly functional web site, 
are very few.

And lastly, none of this is static. I spend time every day learning 
something new -- the web is constantly changing and keeping up with 
it is a daily challenge. I was quoted a long time ago as saying:

"I've learned something new every day of my life -- and I'm getting 
damned tried of it."

And that hasn't changed much.

Cheers,

tedd

Maybe altering the existing articles is a one time process?

Just once to add the links, based on a hash of known article titles to  
date.

For future articles;

I don't see how a pre-existing article could have made reference to an  
article title that hasn't been published yet.

That would mean that only new articles would need to be run through  
the process at the time of publication?

and update the known article titles with the new one.

Of course, I probably don't fully understand the challenge...

Unfortunately, no. These sites are encyclopedias, so when you add
articles to it. For example, let's say I have an article about George
Washington, which I added on day one, and mentions Valley Forge.
However, I don't add the Valley Forge article until several months
later. When I do add it, I need to make sure the first instance of
Valley Forge in the Washington article correctly links to the new
article.

Very easily:)

Personally, I feel that this is a dangerous path to go down, but
customers want this feature, despite the difficulty. On the other
hand, they don't want to take the time to do it manually, which would
make it 100% accurate.

At this time, I just want to give it a shot and see if we can make it work.

Maybe a nightly or weekly rebuild? Depends on frequency of updates.

Conceptually, that makes sense. It is certainly something to consider.
However, these clients are typically librarians, historians and other
public sector-type minds. I will have to figure out how to explain
that to them in their language:)

Ah. New article titles are based on phrases from pre-existing content.

Would it work to have key phrases tied to data stores? That way you could link to it and get all the articles on Valley Forge just by updating the datastore?

Yes. What usually happens in these projects is that a team of writers
cranks out roughly 300-600 articles on various subjects. After the
site launches, the core editorial staff continues adding and expanding
on each subject at a clip of about 300 articles per year. These are
not wikipedia-type encyclopedias. They are produced by historical
societies, humanities councils and universities as reference works.
Most of the people that actually do the data-entry are not very
tech-savvy, so we try to make the system do as much of the heavy
lifting as possible. But there are times when you just have to level
with them and say, "Sorry, if you want 100% accuracy, you have to do
it the old-fashioned way."

When you need to explain something to Lay people I find that its easier to
try and equate it to something universal.

If they are librarians, you can tell them that its like having a book shelf
that is full and when a new book that comes in that needs to go on that
shelf, you need time to shuffle all the books around.  Tell them that it
would  be counter productive to do that while customers are in library,

The way Wikipedia does this is by allowing robot editors.  The bots go
through the wikitext and fix things, and everyone can see the changes
the bot made.  A human can rollback the changes if the bot does
something stupid.

 If you already have versioning of the articles, and the ability to
approve edits, then creating a "robot-link-adder" editor that runs on
a cron job should be a concept that librarians and historians can
understand.

In the current version of the system, that is what we do. Users can
create a list of 'related entries' in one of two ways:

1. Enter a string, like 'washington' and search all of the entries.
This returns a list of all entries that contain the string and the
user can check a box and save the selected records to the list of
related entries.

2. The user can have the system auto-generate the list of related
entries, based on the title. So if the title of the entry is 'George
Washington' the system returns a list of all entries that contain that
string. Then they can pick the ones they want to add to the list.

I suppose that we could make it a lot easier on the system by simply
using the titles of the entries that end up in the related entries
list.

That could work. We do not currently do version control, but that is
on the roadmap. It's one of those things that gets overly complicated
for some people.

You would think. I actually did a workshop yesterday and the one
librarian in the group got all confused over the term 'module' for the
CMS. He kept going back and saying, "Aren't these all just objects?"
Librarians are very smart people, but the ones I have had to deal with
tend to have issues when you don't use the concepts they are used to.

I'll bet you could pre-create most of the links every time you write an 
article. I mention Valley Forge, I think "there should be an article on 
that some day", and so I create the link right then. When the article is 
displayed, you check to see whether the target exists; if it does, you 
display the link; if it doesn't, you display the text without the link. 
That could at least make things easier in the future (maybe).

But you have to consider that chances are, the person entering the article
won't select all the possible keywords that could become links ahead of
time, so you'd end up with articles that don't have enough links.. but I
like the idea.

Personally, i think a spider/bot is the best bet, maintain a list of
phrases/words that should point to links and add those in.

Alternately, when a new article gets created search for all the articles
that might need a reference to it and ask the user to select which ones to
process (automagically add links to the new article) (avoids the time gap of
a bot)

I am leaning towards thinking that is the best option. The other way
would be to simply provide the editor with a button they can click
that automatically does the updates and then provides a list of
articles that they need to review. If all is good, then they can
approve and publish.

Randal:

The way I would handle this would be like so:

Create a database that would contain a table that would hold your 
articles. The table would have an index (ID), title of the article, 
and the meat of the article. It could have other fields, but for sake 
of demonstration let's use just those three.

Normally if one wanted to see an article all they would have to know 
is the ID of the article and send that ID to a script that would 
display the article -- something like display-article.php&id=215. 
Note I am sending the id of the article and not the title of the 
article to the display script.

With that said, all that would be needed would be a one-time search 
through all the articles looking for all the titles you have in your 
article table . This could be accomplished with a FULL TEXT search.

When a title is found, then simply add text to each title that would 
make it a link. For example, if your script found "History of 
America" with an ID of 215 and then the script would alter that 
string like so:

<a href="display-article.php&id=215">History of America</a>

As such, your article linking problem would be solved.

Now if you add another article, then the process needs to be reset 
and redone. In other words, find all links and remove them leaving 
the titles.

The only fly in the ointment is if your articles already have links 
-- if so, then you could get around that problem by simply adding a 
class attribute to your new links, like so:

<a href="display-article.php&id=215" class="dyn-link">History of America</a>

A such, when the script finds a link with a "dyn-link" class, then it 
simply removes that link and returns the article from above to 
"History of America". Note that class attributes don't alter anything 
unless you specify them in your css/

Then rinse, repeat and the problem is solved. This would work and 
only needs to be "rinsed and repeated" when new articles are added OR 
when old articles are removed. Additionally, this could be done in a 
instant by locking the table, doing the update, and unlocking the 
table without any noticeable interruption.

Cheers,

tedd

If the article copy is stored in the db, and you've got sql to work  
with, then at the
point of publication of a new article, it might be possible to narrow  
the targets
with;

select id from articles where article_text like %valley forge%";
(or something like that).

Then you can do whatever you need to on only those ids.

That might avoid the overhead of selecting the content of all the  
articles for
processing in php.

continuation from last post... and another idea...

When you get the list of record ids, select enough of the text around  
the (target phrase to be "linkafied") to give it some context,
and, at the point of publication of a new article,  display those  
blurbs in a list with a pre checked checkbox for each one.

When the editor publishes a new article, they get a list of only what  
will be linked, with enough context to uncheck it if they
don't want it linked.

When they hit publish, either queue up the job, or just update and  
create the links then.

wouldn't work so well if there were 10,000 past articles to have links  
added to...

Hi Kristina,

LOL, yep, that type of revision control is definitely the easiest to
install! I've actually been using that method for years with HTML files,
but I'm finding it to be a PITA when working with PHP.

One reason is that when I have a lot of files with similar names it's
far too easy to select & edit the wrong one (even though I keep a
/_trash dir in an attempt to manage the older stuff).

Another reason is that if I haven't been working on a project for a few
days, it's hard to remember what I was doing with a particular version
of a file unless I also add some sort of description to its name. So I
end up with things like customer_edit_dd_filter_2009-08-26.php and
customer_edit_table_sort_2009-08-26.php. Ugh.

Last but not least, because of my inexperience, it's rare for me to only
have one version of a file on a given day. So even without the
descriptions added to the file names, I'd still end up with things like
customer_edit_2009-08-26.php, customer_edit_2009-08-26_2.php,
customer_edit_2009-08-26_3.php, and so on. It gets REALLY confusing.

Luckily, I make weekly backups to an external drive, so I've never made
a mess that I couldn't recover from, but still...I've wasted a LOT of
time trying to figure out where I was and get a file back to a usable
state, you know? I think it's definitely time for me to buckle down move
on to some sort of VCS--I figure however steep the learning curve might
be, it can't be worse than the amount of time I've already lost on
manual recoveries.

Thanks, that's a good idea. I tend to make my lists on paper, sticky
notes, or a whiteboard. (I especially enjoy ripping sticky notes off my
monitor and tossing them in the trash when something's finally done
*grin*) But now that you mention it, it would probably be better to have
an electronic file so I can go back & review steps I took on any given
project to see what I did and how/if I might improve things.

I prefer simplicity too, but I freak out when my files start getting
messy because I have a hard enough time keeping my thoughts organized
when working with PHP & MySQL. I wish I could keep my apartment as
orderly as my files... ;o)

Same here! Thanks again for your help.

Somehow my earlier reply to this went only to tedd instead of the list.
I guess I need to hit "reply to all" from now on. Anyhoo...

Gah! I hate hearing, "I need you to make a change. It's something
simple, so it should be really easy." Uh-huh, and you're making that
assumption based on...???

I think FrontPage, and to a certain extent Dreamweaver & other WYSIWYG
editors, have created this deceptive "it's easy" notion. MS Office
doesn't help with it's one-click "publish to web" options.

Don't get me wrong--Dreamweaver is a great tool that I use it every day
for both HTML & PHP, but I know how to hand code and I never, ever work
in design mode. I like it for its organization, synchronization, and
code completion abilities (I'm an awful typist). I also like the new
code navigation & associated files abilities in CS4 that let me work in
split view and easily jump around my code. I've never worked with the
server behaviors though--that has always struck me a a very, very bad
idea for someone who's still learning PHP.

Good stuff, thanks!

Exactly. As I speak, there's a designer on one of the forums I frequent
who's insisting on letting PHOTOSHOP write his code for him, and then
trying to edit it in Dreamweaver. Naturally, his designer's eye wants
things to look a certain way and that's not happening because he has
almost no knowledge of HTML, CSS or javascript. The positively hideous
code soup that Photoshop created isn't helping. I like to "pay it
forward" and help people, but only if they're will to make an effort to
learn & practice. I'm not touching this one.

I use GoLive for exactly the same thing. However, Adobe dropped 
GoLive so I bought DW. Unfortunately, DW doesn't cut it for me -- 
it's like GoLive, but less.

So, I am moving to Eclipse. It has a steep learning curve and does 
things a bit different, but is well worth the effort. Plus, I can use 
if for other development (i.e., JAVA). In addition, it's free and 
doesn't depend upon a cost/benefit analysis of some corporate 
management types to remain in existence. No longer will I find myself 
painted into a dead-end as I have been in at least a dozen different 
languages and IDE's because the brain-dead majority of users didn't 
buy it.

Besides, the web has become sophisticated enough to support some very 
professional tools and we need to keep up if we are to remain 
competitive. As Will Rogers once said "You may be on the right track, 
but if you don't move along you'll get run over."

Cheers,

I would just like to mention a point of failure in that automated proccess.
I had to deal with this in a previous project so it's quite fresh.
What will happen if:

e.g.
There are 3 articles. Article A is titled "History of America". Article B is
titled "Glorious History of America". In article C there is this text "The
book is talking about the glorious history of America". If you run an
automated proccess and the test for article A comes first then the text will
be  "The book is talking about the glorious <a href="/id1111/">history of
America</a>" and the next test will fail.

If you run a test for article B first the text will become "The book is
talking about the <a href="/id2222/">glorious history of America</a>". Then
if you test for article A it might end up being "The book is talking about
the <a href="/id2222/">glorious <a href="/id1111/">history of
America</a></a>"

The possibilities of such procedured practically ruining your content are
endless. If you want to dive into tag nesting and html validation you will
be opening another whole.

Also what will happen if an editor want to insert this "I loved the book <a
href="LINKTOAMAZON">George Washington and the Glorious history of
America</a>." and there are articles with titles using "George Washington",
"Glorious history", "History of America", "America"?

I think you get my point...

What I have ended up with is human editors. Not manually editing the links
of course. A bot proposes edits all the time and an editor decides what
changes to accept and what to reject. Of course the robot should be clever
and propose changes that make sense and not repeat the same propositions all
over.

It's a challenging task but that's why we are here, right?

LOL. Oh yes. I have spent a lot of time thinking about this over the
past few years, so a lot of the issues discussed in this thread I have
thought of, but there have been some new ones. It has been a very
helpful discussion.

When the editor builds the list of related articles, that is
essentially what the automated process does.

I think what we can do is add some new functionality called 'Link to
Related Articles.' When the editor clicks the [Find Matches] button,
the system can return a list of the articles that match the title of
the article they are working on. This can also populate a dropdown
list of the articles, so the editor can highlight the text they want
to create the link to, then select the appropriate article from the
dropdown and click [Apply Link].

This does create more data entry for the editor and the rest of the
staff, but it should be much more accurate.

Regarding PHundamentals, it's certainly been a great resource over the years
thanks to the time and effort put into it, and the quality/participation of
the list members.

It has, obviously, stalled and become a bit outdated itself.  Picking them
back up would be a great thing, although time obviously is always the most
scarce commodity.  If someone would want to help picking them back up, it'd
be a great thing.

And in fact with today's Web 2.0 facey-spaces and twitter-books, perhaps
even more value would come.  As part of PHundamentals, we could also
construct an open source project to facilitate the PHundamentals process.

We'd just need some people (far or near to NYC) to help out... takers?

Petros:

Yes,  I see your point and the two problems you raise (good concerns).

Problem 1

My initial solution would solve the first problem *provided* that the 
titles were unique and not contained within another title, right? So 
why not start with the longest title and search/replace downwards?

For example, "Glorious History of America" is searched, found, and 
made a link. Then "History of America" is searched -- however -- the 
search excludes links! The phrase "History of America" in "Glorious 
History of America" would never be considered because it's within a 
link.

The process would continue until you run out of titles -- simple, right?

Problem 2

The second problem can be solved two ways:

Way one -- by removing all organic links from the initial search. In 
other words, when the FULL TEXT search is started the search is done 
on articles absent of all organic links. You can easily add the 
organic links back-in after the search/replace is finished.

Please note when the automated links are added, they also have an 
unique class attribute, such as class="autotag", which will allow 
them to be easily identified and removed for a rebuild.

Way two -- you could solve the problem by excluding organic links 
from the search because they DO NOT have the unique class attribute 
identifier -- thus no real reason to remove them at all for the 
search/replace routine (i.e., Way 1). I only presented "Way 1" to get 
you to think in terms of removing the organic links from the problem.

Possible problem

The only fly in the ointment here would be if an editor wants to 
manually link an article by trying to mimic the automated process. 
For example, he/she inserts a "<a href="/id1111/">History of 
America</a>" using the *index* of the article. Everything would still 
work unless that article is deleted. In such case the link would 
become dead.

However, if the editor simply added the class identifier tag (i.e., 
class="autotag") to the link, then the automated process would treat 
his entry like it's own and adjust accordingly.

If the editors simply followed the rules, which aren't complicated, 
then editors could participate as they want in the process.

The solution presented here doesn't require tag nesting or html 
validation. As such, I don't see any additional problems -- do you?

Cheers,

tedd

Another little add on to these solutions would be to include some kind of
counter that will prevent the bot form linking more then X times.  This way
when the article loads, it will not be just one big stream of links.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Short Tags deprecated?
Message-ID: <c9a993590908281034g32b6b2c4qacb798708d2f7bc7@mail.gmail.com>

I think there is some discrepancy with this ini directive.  In the study
book "Zend PHP5 Certification Guide" form PHP|Architect, It states that the
short tags are deprecated.  I am not seeing any other references to short
tags being deprecated.  In fact in the documentation for the Zend Framework,
it's stating that short tags can be used as long as the directive is turned
on:

http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.html#zend.view.introduction.shortTags


Has any one out there heard of short tags being deprecated?

Thank You

Hi Chuck:

I recall some talk on PHP's internals list about this subject, maybe six 
months to a year ago.  It was decided they will not be removed.

There was some discussion that they would be deprecated, but I think it ended up that they're just disabled by default now if you use the recommended ini.  I always turn them on.  There was some other discussion about a replacement for them (that wouldn't interfere with XML documents) but that's stalled AFAIK.

The curly syntax for accessing chars in a string is apparently officially deprecated now:

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.substr

:(

    I like the short tags,  they're a comfortable syntax for templating 
that's both simpler and more powerful than templating "problems" like 
smarty.
   
    However,  most PHP style guides advise against the short tags.  I 
think they're not quite SGML compliant,  so some HTML editors might not 
handle them correctly.  Also,  like magic_quotes_gpc,  short tags may or 
may not be turned on for a given server,  so it's one more thing that 
can break your app.  Now,  I'm sure ~your~ organization is better,  but 
there are ~some~ organizations that have 10 web servers with PHP and 
it's pretty random if magic_quotes_gpc or short tags are turned on or off.

/agree which was why I thought this was deprecated.  I guess since the
webserver knows what parser to pull based off the file extension, it looks
as if Zend has decided that there would be no benefit to deprecating this
directive.

Which makes it seem like the obvious fix is to parse <? and <?php but
not parse <?xml. But what do I know?

Back when I still thought it was fun to write XHTML, I used to do this
in my templates:
<?='<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>'?>

Nice, huh?

Hi Tedd,
That were some good ideas about the problems that I thought will arise.

What you forgeting is that you can't just decide what is more important and
what is not. I mean it might be that logically the short article (e.g.
America) should be linked and not the long one. If the articles are many and
have organic (sorry I can't think of a better word) titles then it will
produce weird results.

I still think that automatically cross linking articles that might have
small titles is a bad idea. Imagine imdb doing that and trying to crosslink
the movie "Z" and the movie "IT" inside it's editors articles and reviews.

I think that the best living example of this is the ad networks that link
words to advertisements inside web site content. They can make a text almost
unreadable when they insert the ad links.

If you're using file extensions to parse, which I think most people
are, then that still does not solve this problem:

<?xml version "1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<something>
<?php echo build_something(); ?>
</something>

Works fine, and as expected, on servers without short_open_tags turned
on.  With them turned on, you have to <?php echo "<?xml..." in order
to get your expected behavior.

There's problems with the way scripts are parsed for that, afaik.
There's some reason why <?xml is parsed and not ignored, but I'm not
entirely sure what it is.

It's snippets like these, imho, that justify the deprecation/removal
of short open tags.

Actually, everyone has had very good thoughts on the entire process.
Enough for me to attempt to develop a solution, but also enough to
know that it will not be a _perfect_ solution.

Well, everyone is entitled to their opinion. I'd much rather type
<?=$somevar?> than <?php echo $somevar;?>.

It all comes down to what you're used to. If you use php as a template
language, short tags are an incredibly useful and valuable feature. If
you don't, you probably think "ugh, that doesn't look like php."

On the other hand, if I ever have to hack the php source to enable
short tags, I'll change them to [; and ;] so I can stop wearing down
my pinkie on the shift key.

Absolutely, some type of shorthand is needed, which is exactly why they
exist in the first place.  I think the issue with removing <?= was that no
one could decide what to actually replace it with.  It'll come, wait for
it...

    Well you're at it,  how about a version of <?= that has 
htmlspecialchars() built in...

    It might be an irresponsible namespace grab,  but I've got a 
function that is (almost)

function Q($s) { echo htmlspecialchars($s) };

    and I get into the habit of writing <?php Q($string) ?> in my 
templates so I'm not writing hundreds of HTML injection bugs all day..

On more solution would be to have a roll over the word/phrase that will
present the user with a list of articles matching that title.  This way for
the Americas problem, the user can then choose which article s/he would like
to goto instead of letting the system decide for them.  This will make they
feel more empowered and smarter.

For bonus points, I'm a fan of something this:

function _($string) { echo htmlspecialchars(l10n($string)); }

Then <?php _($string) ?> does double duty: it escapes what you need to 
escape, and runs the string through a localization lookup function or table.

No, I don't think so.

I write code so that the next programmer who reviews my work can do 
so easily. Making code cryptic does absolutely nothing but cause 
problems for others. It doesn't mean you're a clever programmer, it 
just means that you don't know any better.

Also, short tags don't work well with xml and another reason for 
depreciating them.

Cheers,

Many years ago there was a company who made a devise that played 
chess -- it was table-top piece of hardware. The company found they 
had a large number of returns where the units had been obviously 
damaged by the users.

They studied the problem and rewrote the algorithm to take more time 
to make the computer's move. As a result, they found that the 
incidence of repair dropped. It seems that the computer's move was 
too fast, which frustrated the players to the point of becoming 
violent. Slowing the computer down, gave the users a feeling that 
their move was worthy of timely consideration by the computer and 
thus lessened unfavorable user behavior.

We need to remember that user interfacing is part of what we do. If 
the user doesn't understand the process, then they won't trust 
outcome-- and if they don't trust, then we need to get them in the 
decision process until they do. It's called human engineering.

What complicated problems we find today, will have commonplace 
solutions tomorrow.

Cheers,

tedd

Since I have an opinion as well I think it isn't unreasonable to require to 
use the 'long' tags. They are not that much longer (three characters more) and 
for those who use them often assigning a hot key for it in the editor used is 
probably a smart move as well. I use only the 'long' tags.

Which short tag it is supposed to be is really like facing the task of 
designing a new car and debating where the air freshener goes. But people are 
creatures of habit, so I think nothing will change in the end.

Be careful... _() is already defined as an alias for gettext()

I have a feeling that would cause a ton of compatibility issues.  Some
time ago, I looked at the magento source code, and they were using
__(), which seems like a reasonable alternative.

When internationalizing an app, you often need to write code like:

printf(l10n('<b>%s</b> wants to be your friend'),
htmlspecialchars($friend_name) );

It is handy to make your shortcut behave like printf when there is
more than 1 argument.

Hi Hans,

I can't offer much in the way of expertise, but I can certainly offer my
time. It's the least I can do considering what a great resource this
list has been. The way I see it, helping out in some capacity would not
only allow me to give back a little, but would also almost surely result
in learning something new & useful.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you feel I can make a useful
contribution of some kind.

Bev

I don't usually use NULL values for anything because no matter how much
I read I can't figure out the purpose of it. So far this hasn't been a
problem for me, but I figure it's going to trip me up sooner or later.

I've read the NULL sections of the PHP & MySQL manuals and even tried
googling for articles, but the concept of a ?a missing unknown value?
makes my brain hurt. Can someone please, please, please attempt to
explain--in the simplest terms possible--what the practical
advantages/disadvantages of using it might be?

Bev,

This might potentially be wrong, but what I think of NULL is this. If 
something is NULL, then you don't know what it is.  It could be empty, or 
it could be set.  You just don't know.

If something is empty, then you know it's empty.  So if birthdate is set 
to '', then you know they have no birthdate.  But if it's set to NULL, you 
don't know if they have one or not.

Sort of how I use it sometimes, and MAY BE WRONG.  So I would listen to 
what others have to say =)

Hey Bev:

> but the concept of a ???a missing unknown value???
> makes my brain hurt.

Let's say you wrote a piece of software that asks users a set of 
questions.  Before a user responds to a given question, its answer field 
is null.  When they answer the question, its field gets assigned the 
actual value chosen by the user.  When the user finishes, sometimes they 
have skipped some questions, so they will remain null.

This is useful, in part, for statistical purposes, since the null record 
won't be added into averages, etc.  For example, you had three surveys 
filled out.  Two people actually filled in their ages (10 and 20), if you 
do an average when using nulls, you'll get an average age of 15.  But if 
you use 0's instead of nulls, the average age will incorrectly be 10.

Thanks for trying, Matt, but I still don't get the purpose of "knowing
that you don't know" something, so to speak.

Here's an example of one instance in which I use null.

Before querying the database, I check to see if the result of the
query has been cached.  I call a function that will either return the
value in the cache or null, either because the cache has expired or
because it was never set.  When I receive a return value other than
null, I skip the database query.  When null comes back, I query the
database and update the cache.

I struggled with it for some time as well, because for non-programmers 
nothing, empty, null, nada, and nichts are the same thing. I think the easiest 
way to get an idea is to look at how strings and integers are stored in a 
database table. Unless a default value is specified, the contents of a field 
in a database table are set to NULL. That NULL isn't the same as zero for an 
integer. Zero is a defined value of an integer variable the same way 1 or 
123456 would be. In case of strings, NULL is not the same as an empty string. 
So when you read records from a table and then use the field values to make 
comparisons you will find that NULL is unequal to zero or an empty string. 
While NULL is really nothing, 0 and "" are something - at least for a database 
and PHP, because then the database and PHP know exactly what is meant, whereas 
with NULL there is no defined value.
Same way the other way around. Let's say, you create a simple ledger 
application to balance your checkbook.  You have 100$ and spend it all on PHP 
books. So after entering the expense you end up with 0$, which is an explicit 
amount and the result of your calculation. NULL is not specific and if you do 
the math you get zero and not 'nothing'.
In regards to strings, let's say you have a string and you need to strip all 
vowels and all occurrences of "s". The original string is "sea", not you strip 
the characters out and you get "". Similar to the math task above, it is a 
definitive results, whereas NULL isn't.

That said, I think it is very important to initialize every variable you use 
in your script right at the beginning of the script, even if you never will 
use the variable with that value. The reason for that is that all your 
variables will have a definitive value. Same applies for variables that get 
values assigned that come from database tables or HTML forms (or better to 
say, any source no matter what). First order of business is to check it for 
being a NULL value and assigning it a definitive (explicit) value, which can 
include 0 or "". Otherwise PHP will complain or in case of integers just 
assume something. Typically, that is 0, but I rather tell PHP what it is than 
have PHP pull something out of its lower torso.

Sure, one could say that NULL is the same as 0 or "", but that is a purely 
arbitrary interpretation, although maybe a convenient one.

I hope I explained it in an understandable way.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Need help understanding NULL
Message-ID: <1251578829.5291@coral.he.net>

Bev,

The test for and behavior of NULL varies somewhat from language to 
language and database to database.

Let's take a basic example, you design a database table and you 
describe your LastName field as NOT NULL.

That means that every time you do an insert into the table, the field 
LastName MUST contain a value of some sort.  The purpose of that is 
basically to ensure that any query, unless it contains all of the 
required values, will error out if you attempt to do the insert without 
having a value in that field.

In most cases, not all cases, on INSERT, an empty string i.e. '' is not 
considered a NULL value, but an empty string which will result in ... 
well...an empty string being stored in your database, but the field 
will not show as NULL.  When you pull that out of the database, some 
languages will treat that as a NULL value and some will treat it as an 
empty string.

Or, in your database, you can specify NULL as the default value for the 
field, and therefore if you skip it in an insert, it will default to 
NULL.  The design of the database depends on the needs of the 
application.

As a test of how PHP treats NULL vs. empty strings with your database, 

Create values of NULL, ' ' (a string containing a space), '' (an empty 
string) and pull them out into variables and then you can begin to 
determine how, in your application, they are being treated.

In most cases, you should see NULLs and empty strings look very 
similar...but not always.  And the devil is definitely in the details, 
especially if your application is talking to other platforms that may 
handle these values differently.

It can help you to understand NULL, if you contemplate the difference 
between an empty string '' and NULL.  NULL is not a string because it's 
undetermined. But an empty string is a string that contains, well, 
nothing, but it is not NULL.

David,

Thanks for this, and I can't cut & paste and quote you because your 
email got encoded by my webmail.

You're right that in PHP most of the comparison operators won't treat 
an empty string and NULL pulled out of a database as the same.  I'm 
thinking back on a long history of using many languages and have to say 
that without sitting down and testing it out, I couldn't offhand make a 
list of what the behavior would be with, say, = vs == vs the new === in 
PHP5.

Look forward to hearing more stuff!

Yeah something like this could be handy, certainly.  I typically push/adapt
an object into the template which is property overloaded.  Then something
like:

<?=$Object->FirstName?>

Outputs correctly escaped (or processed in any other way depending on what
the overload wants to do) content.  Quite handy and has proved effective.

It does seem that it'd be handy to have some type of "stdout" processing
hook that can be overridden, while providing a shorthand for working in
templates.

Hmm... streams... wonder if that could do anything here as they are now...

Actually expertise isn't required... just time and organization :)

For everyone's benefit, let me recap quickly how PHunnys have worked in the
past.

The original concept was to form articles based on mailing list/community
feedback and sharing of experience.  Perhaps it could be considered an early
"crowdsourcing" before it became a buzzword.

So the PHunnys editor would pose a question to the list, encourage
discussion, ask for other opinions, and try to garner as much feedback/etc
as possible.  Then, build the responses into an article and post it online.

Originally, the purpose was to form best practices articles, but I could see
this expanding - for instance, to include a general tally/poll/listing of
people's techniques, and pros/cons of each (rather than just a single best
practice).

Take for instance the recent/ongoing discussion about short tags and server
settings.  A lot of good information has travelled the list because of these
threads, and the PHunny editor would combine these into an article.

The topics of discussion would also be "crowd sourced" and I have a listing
somewhere of some topics we had considered covering in the past.

Thanks again Bev, I'll also follow-up with you directly as well.

I also encourage anyone else who might be interested in participating, to
join the Org list - we can continue general organizational discussion over
there.

Best,

Null is an odd critter. It's not an empty string, it's not '', it's 
not 0, it's NULL.

Okay, wait--but what about what Dan said re NULL values not being added
to averages, making them useful statistically? In that case wouldn't you
want NULL to stay NULL? IOW, in his case the query would would only
retrieve values WHERE foo != NULL? But then the manual says that the
arithmetic comparison operators won't work with NULL, so that can't be
right...

Hang on, let me think a minute... Okay, so then I guess you'd just
assign a value of 0 or '' to anything that was NULL, and then have PHP
only calculate numbers where $foo >= 1? But if that's the case, then why
use NULL in the first place? That can't be right, so I must still be
missing some important point.

One last try: Maybe the query would be along the lines of SELECT * WHERE
foo NOT IN NULL, that way there wouldn't be any need to deal with it
because since it was never retrieved in the first place...?

Sorry for making you witness my somewhat scattershot thinking process,
but even the smallest sequences of programming logic can still be a big
challenge for me.

You did an awesome job of explaining. Thanks again for taking the time

But in the case of a form, wouldn't you be validating the input before
trying to insert the record? Sorry if I seem dense--I must be
misunderstanding something.

This is really good to know. I guess that answers my previous question

Now that you guys have given me a better understanding of things, I'm
going to do exactly as you suggested--create a table with some NULL
values and try playing around to see what happens.

Yes, the devil is definitely in the details. I can't tell you how many
times I've lost a night's sleep over something small. For me, it usually
has to do with logic/sequence, but sometimes it's something really
stupid like:

Creating a field/variable named desc and spending hours trying to figure
out why MySQL was balking at my query with its typically enigmatic error
messages. When it finally dawned on me what my mistake was I think I
invented some entirely new curse words just for that occasion! LOL

Or like the time (very recently) when I was converting timestamps to
calculate the number of days between two given dates. I used the
number_format() function so the number of days display nicely to the
user, but then couldn't figure out why records with more than 999
weren't behaving properly (they were supposed to show up in different
colors as expiration dates approached, and notices of pending
expirations were also to be emailed). I checked, doubled checked, and
triple checked my math because numbers are not my friends, but I
couldn't find anything wrong. The problem? The comma that
number_format() was inserting. Duh. Once I switched to using the round()
and restricted using number_format() only to display things at the end
after all calculations had been done, everything was just fine.

Indeed.

Actually, that's precisely what I was reading before I posted here. I
had once again been trying to comprehend NULL and had hoped that
rereading the manual pages would make more sense this time around as
that sometimes works when I get a little more experience with things.
Unfortunately, my efforts were to no avail. There's something about the
way most manual pages are written that tends to make my eyes glaze over
in about 60 seconds flat.

Bev

Precisely this issue is discussed in the PHundamental article

You should be aware that PHP and SQL have completely different concepts of null.

In php, null is a unique magic value that means "undefined", and if
two things are null, then they are equal.

<?php
var_dump($a===$b) // bool(true)
var_dump(NULL === NULL) // bool(true)

Contrast this with SQL, where null is akin to "not yet known value"

Consider:
"SELECT NULL = NULL;"
gives
--------
| NULL |
--------
In a SQL view of the world, that can be interpreted as:
Are two not yet known values equal?
and the answer is:
"Not yet known"

In sql, every comparison to NULL, yields another NULL.
That is why 'SELECT * WHERE foo = NULL' doesn't do what you might
expect.  In fact that query is guaranteed to always return zero rows.

It is a fact of life that pretty much every language handles NULL
differently, and whenever I learn a new language, it is one of the
first things I research.

John Campbell

No, you are exactly right, and you'll want to use a combination of 
client-side (form) validation and good database design, and make 
decisions based on the individual application.   But, you also need to 
be aware of other people's database design choices, and code around 
them.  It's good to know that a blank string is not null when you need 
to populate a field that is supposed to be NOT NULL but actually has no 
value to be inserted...and that sounds insane, but I've seen stuff like 
this over the years, and sometimes it cannot be changed but only dealt 
with. :)

Also sometimes you're not dealing with forms, let's say you have a web 
service that's sending you XML which gets processed and goes right into 
the database without your ever seeing it in the production environment 
(and this is getting more and more common these days, and there is just 
nobody sitting around reading a generated log of every response that 
comes in to check them, like I suggested you do in a test 
environment...that defeats the purpose of automatically inserting the 
data!), so the best way you're able to generate an error if fields are 
missing is if the query doesn't execute...this can happen, say, if the 
people sending you the data change something and don't bother to notify 
you...if your fields in the database will accept NULL inputs, you could 
look a week later and see missing data...there are a lot of different 
cases and all the solutions are different.

which is why the correct syntax for such a select would have to be 
'SELECT * [FROM table] WHERE foo IS NULL' rather than '= NULL'

The fun part is when you inherit a database that's such a mess that 
your "empty" fields are either NULLs, or ''s, OR even '   's.

And of course all the boolean fields use 0 for true and 1 for 
false...just to really make your day.  Real-world programming 
scenarios!!

Your big mistake was delimiting the identifiers when creating the table.

"Identifiers" are table names, field names, index names, etc.  The 
"delimiter" for these is "`" in MySQL.  When you use the delimiter around 
the identifiers, the database allows you to create nearly any name you 
can possibly think of, including "reserved words."  Reserved words are, 
well words that the system has reserved for its own internal use, so 
should not be utilized by users.  As you've now discovered, delimiting 
identifiers when creating tables is the genesis of a world of pain.

If you tried to create a table with a name called "desc" in it without 
delimiting it, MySQL would have complained to you up front, saving you 
the agony.

Uh, just making sure...  Did you convert the timestamps via 
number_format() then do the math?  Ouch.  This is the kind of stuff the 
date functions, like date_diff(), etc, in MySQL and PHP are for.  
Faster, more accurate, easier.  Then format the result.

When you want to get rows where foo really is null, you need to need to 
use "is null":
    SELECT * WHERE foo IS NULL;

NULL is just a type - a type that can only ever be one thing - NULL

NULL comes from pointers, largely where there can be null references or pointers.  It's an address that doesn't point anywhere, but is some way pointed to and acknowledged, thus it's not purely non-existent (yes, we could argue for years on the subtle meanings of NULL, void, undefined, etc. :)

As always, there's only one real resource these days:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null

To me, pragmatically, NULL really only comes down to one thing - it's a special type that always has a single value.  Different languages and environments then utilize this type differently, and add their own meanings.  Thus you need to read the different environment's docs to learn how NULL is treated specifically in that environment, and how it affects getting things down in that environment.  There is no "global" real meaning of NULL - it's language specific.

Other than that NULL is meaningless - it's NULL :)

Client side validation is only good for helping the user not make 
mistakes.  Server side validation/escaping/prepared statements is 
required for security reasons.

For some value of "best."  It's generally nicer to validate the XML 
against a schema file using DOMDocument::schemaValidate().

Dan mentioned a case where having NULL is of good use, because in his example 
it makes a difference if the person responding to a survey doesn't answer the 
question or answers it with 0. If there is no answer you cannot treat it the 
same way as 0. It is an example that I didn't think about.
What I was talking about was in regards to variables in PHP being NULL. The 
"retrieve values WHERE foo != NULL" is SQL. That is a different language.

Just because I couldn't come up with a case for using NULL (and I tried to 
find one) doesn't mean there is one. Dan is right and his example is spot on. 
My explanation wasn't wrong, but incomplete.


> One last try: Maybe the query would be along the lines of SELECT * WHERE
> foo NOT IN NULL, that way there wouldn't be any need to deal with it
> because since it was never retrieved in the first place...?

I fired up my rusty PHP IDE and tried a few things. Turns out that SQL is way 
more picky about what NULL is, whereas PHP considers NULL often as 0 or an 
ampty string. For example, when you have this in PHP
<?php
$a = "";
$b = NULL;
if ($a == $b) echo "they are the same";
?>

you will see "they are the same" as output. In SQL when your run
SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Field = NULL
and then
SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Field = ''

you may very well end up with two different results. I think it has to do with 
the fact that PHP doesn't take it too serious with the type of variable. For 
example
<?php
$a = 12;
$b = "threefour";
echo $a.$b;
?>

gives you this output: 12threefour

PHP just makes the integer into a string and sticks both together. In other 
languages this throws an error, because the variables are not of the same 
type. That said, for SQL searching for something that is NULL isn't the same 
as searching for something that is 0.
PHP allows for the more picky way in comparison by using three equal signs. 
That means that
<?php
$a = "";
$b = NULL;
if ($a === $b) echo "they are the same";
?>

won't output anything. Only if you set $a to NULL as well you will see text as 
output. It took me a while and a few tries to remember how PHP treats NULL. It 
basically is the same as not assigning any value or unsetting a variable or 
array (which seems to be a quick way to figure out if an array is empty). For 
example
<?php
echo $x + 23;
?>
outputs 23.

So, what I propose you keep in mind is that PHP knows about NULL, but treats 
it as if it is 0 for numerical variables or as an empty string. In SQL it is 
not the case. If PHP's behaviour is right or wrong can be hotly debated. I 
like that it doesn't take it too serious with the variable type, but just to 
assume that some undefined variable is out of a sudden 0 is quite bold. But 
that's the way it is and when one knows about it one can deal with it.

> Sorry for making you witness my somewhat scattershot thinking process,
> but even the smallest sequences of programming logic can still be a big

See, I hate programming and programming hates me. I do like programming in 
PHP, because PHP isn't so anal about stuff like this as Java or C. That makes 
me think less. The problem is that you might end up with really bad results. 
For example when no submission is an error condition, but submitting an empty 
string or 0 is fine. In that case having NULL be the same as zero is not what 
you want. So while for most cases PHP's assumptions work out fine I wouldn't 
count on PHP being always right.

See above, it is very convenient, because sqrt(NULL) gives 0 and not an error.

You are welcome, just keep in mind that PHP and SQL aren't the same, even when 
we often mush them together in code.

I played around with a class for a while that was something like this:

abstract class AbstractViewDataBucket {
	/*
	 * This will be called for manually set private members.
	 */
	public function __get($var) {
		return htmlspecialchars($this->$var);
	}
	
	/*
	 * This is here because manually overridden variables
	 * that aren't already set are set publicly, although
	 * __set() is called when they're defined.  This allows us
	 * to make classes with no pre-defined members.
	 */
	public function __set($var, $val) {
		$this->$var = htmlspecialchars($val);
	}
}

And all my classes that held data for templates worked "magically."
So, something like:
$foo = new RandomViewDataThatExtendsTheAformentionedClass();
$foo->bar = 'baz';
$foo->hi = '<a href="google.com">hello</a>';

... (in another file):
<html>
<?php echo $foo->bar; ?>
<table>
<?php echo $foo->hi; ?>
...

This sort of crap would work as expected.  Similarly (and sort of
derailing), before I switched to prepared statements and actually
manually escaped database strings (thank god that period of my life is
over), I had used another class that worked similarily, only calling
mysqli_real_escape_string() instead of htmlspecialchars().  I'm a huge
fan of small, single-use classes, so this schema worked well for me.
It also allows overriding if necessary, like one class that needed to
verify that data was UTF8, while other classes didn't care so much.
Another idea with the overriding of "stdout" processing, you could
abuse output buffering and the callback support that comes with it,
although a major initial hurdle would be deciding what to escape.  Any
solution I can think ofresults in spending more time supporting the
output handling than would be saved by using them.  Doesn't mean it's
impossible, of course ;)

And on another note, historically speaking, things that offer a sense
of security that are built into PHP (magic quotes and safe mode,
anyone?) aren't very useful and are often seen as a false sense of
security.  Having something like <?htmlspecialchars= ?> (and I'm 99%
sure <?hsc= would be a pretty easy patch) built into the language
would probably wind up with a lot of sites with double escaped
characters, which is awful, or there'd be some way to circumvent its
protection that would instantly make a lot of sites insecure to XSS
attacks, so I'm definitely not in favor of this sort of feature.  Once
again, my opinion only.

This is really important stuff and I don't remember it being covered in
any of my "beginner" books. Grrr.

The thing is, I have no idea how I managed to delimit the identifiers. I
created my everything using phpMyAdmin--could that have been the
culprit? The reason I ask is because I just tried it again and MySQL
didn't complain. Since you said it should be complaining, I decided to
attempt the same using a trial version of Navicat that I downloaded a
few days ago. Sure enough, MySQL threw a syntax error right away. WTF?

If you tell me that I should be talking to MySQL from the command line
I'm going to jump out the window forthwith. ;)

Actually, my description wasn't very accurate. I guess I sort of did it
in the middle--after the math to calculate the number of days between
"today" and the expiration date, but before telling PHP to check for a
specific number days See below). Where you now see round() is where I
was previously using number_format():

$todays_date = date("Y-m-d");
$today = strtotime($todays_date);
$exp_date = strtotime($exp_date);
$diff = ($exp_date - $today);
$num_days = ($diff / 86400);
$num_days = round($num_days, 0);
$exp_date = date('m-d-y', $exp_date);
if ($num_days <= 60 && $num_days >= 46) {
	$exp_date = '<span class="exp60Days">'.$exp_date.'</span>
} //...and so on

In MySQL the exp_date field data type is DATE. I strongly suspect that
I'm handling my dates in the most verbose & confusing way possible, and
I know for a fact that I didn't properly normalize my tables. IOW, I
managed to make things work, but it's a big mess.

I'm currently trying to redo everything, but with limited success as
trying to grope my way through the fog of my inexperience results in
frequent rounds of tripping & falling face-first into the mud. I
eventually figure stuff out and inch my way up a little, but it's a
slow, painful climb.

Sometimes I sort of feel like Sisyphus. *sigh*

I'm going to go check out the date_diff() function...

Bev,

phpMyAdmin often puts those funny sideways leaning apostrophes/quotes --
 ` -- around table names and field names when it writes its queries.  
You want to remove those before you create or change any table or field 
names, I think is what he means in practical terms.  That way you will 
get errors on reserved words.

Also you can try to avoid your own confusion by giving longer, more 
detailed names to fields.  Some people hate this idea but to me a 
little extra typing is worth the clarity.

Not only for yourself, but everyone else dealing with your database and code. 
Also, I recommend naming fields with the same content by the same name across 
the database. So rather than calling a field "RecordID" call it "FooRecordID" 
even when that is obvious when that field is in table Foo. It doesn't get that 
obvious anymore when you use that record ID in the table Bar. Calling it just 
there "FooRecordID" may be OK, but I come across way too many tables where 
such a field is called "GizmoID" because table Foo stores the records for 
gizmos, but it isn't called "Gizmo". That really rapidly inhales. And in any 
case create and maintain a data dictionary so that one doesn't have to sift 
through all the field descriptions in the table views.

I've seen those odd little quotes on the few occasions that I've used
phpMySQL to create queries, but the thing is I didn't use that when I
created the tables--I just used the little text field on the main db
page to give it a name, then entered how many fields I wanted and
clicked "Go". So it must have inserted them behind the scenes.

Amen to that! That's exactly what I'm doing these days. If a field name
doesn't warrant an underscore, then I have to be 100% sure that it's not
a reserved word--if I'm not sure, then I check. There is no way I want
to repeat that suffering again.

True, you're not handling the date thing correctly, but you're close.

You need to understand how the date was entered into the database.

Check out:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_date

and review the DATE and NOW functions.

Once you find out the format of how the date was recorded, then you 
can figure out how to extract and use the date for calculating your 
expiration date.

As for verbosity, I'm all for it if it's in the name of clarity. You 
don't need to be cryptic for your code to work. Just the opposite, 
take whatever steps you think you need to detail what you are doing.

I often start with a simple statement telling what I expect the 
following code to do, such as:

// This extracts the full name of the tutor from the database

and then I write code to do that. Each step is clearly laid out with 
documentation. If I have to use extra variables to understand what's 
going on, that's not a big deal in my book, but clarity is.

Take your time, think things out, and organize your code into small 
solution for small problems. Understand each step. Eventually, the 
bigger problems will reduce into small problems and you'll find 
you've finished. And you've finished you will understand what it does.

Normalizing tables is not intuitive, or at least it was not for me. 
The simple rule is to not duplicate data in your database. For 
example, if you have a Customer table that holds the name and address 
of someone and a Purchase table shows what the person purchased, then 
you do not have to repeat the name and address field in the Purchase 
table. Instead, you use the index of the person from the Customer 
table to identify them, such as:

Customer table
id first_name last_name address
345 Bev Woohoo 123 Tulip

Item table
id item_name cost
1576  Hair Setter  39.95

Purchase table
id customer_id item_purchased
2003  345  1576

If you will review the above tables, you will see that by looking at 
the Purchase table, you can deduce the customer 345 (you), purchased 
item 1576 (Hair Setter) for $38.95. Neat huh?

Of course, you can add things like inventory to the Item table and 
date of purchase to the Purchase table, and zip code to the Customer 
table, but this example was simply to show you how these three tables 
can be used to provide the data you want without repeating the data 
anywhere. Everything is done via indexes.

If you know some other way, please let me know because that's the way I learn.

Bev,

Good morning to you as well!  I'd imagine that yes, the table-creation 
widget inside phpMyAdmin probably does execute the queries that way, as 
that seems to be its default mode.  I'm not sure if you can change 
settings to remove that behavior...

There are a lot of reasons to like phpMyAdmin (well, a few reasons at 
least) but also a lot of reasons to hate it.  For instance, once the 
database reaches a certain size, you won't be able to back it up using 
phpMyAdmin, but will have to use the command line.  That's sort of lame.

At the bare minimum, if you're going to use phpMyAdmin to create 
tables, do it in raw SQL instead of using the widget.  

PS I'm wondering what my mother would say if she knew I spent basically 
my entire weekend talking about databases..."that's no way to find a 
husband, Kristina" is what she'd probably say...and she's probably 
right.  Lucky thing I'm not looking for one....!

Not any easier, but more enjoyable.

Once you figure out how to hold a hammer, you can beat the crap out 
of a lot of stuff while learning what a screwdriver is used for. Then 
with hammer and screw driver in hand, you can do some serious damage 
while learning what other tools do.

Eventually you can get to building your first bird house, then shed, 
and then home. Like everything else, it takes time. Enjoy the trip.

I think I get that part now: The moment it has a known value, even if
that value is '' or zero, then it's no longer NULL (at least in the

Oddly, while I go to Wikipedia probably a dozen times a day for answers,
it never occurred to me to look up NULL there. Go figure.

Excellent and very accurate description. That one's going in my notes.

Actually, I'd never heard of it till you mentioned it, so I looked it

Should yes, but many don't. Many wing it knowing just enough to get 
by and be dangerous. I review code almost everyday where someone 
though they were doing it right, but their product was not up to 
standards.

For example, try validating web sites -- you'll see that the majority 
fail having html errors -- and html is easy to fix!

Also look at the amount of embedded css you find in html and php 
stuff -- some done by very good php programmers who simply don't know 
any better.

Also, look at javascript routines and see the amount of unobtrusive 
code as compared to the embedded stuff. Again, good javascript 
programmers who don't know how to program unobtrusively.

Now, combine all of that into being truly multilingual and you'll 
find very few who actually master it.

Cheers,

tedd

I have to disagree with both of these statements.  I don't know of any
size that phpMyAdmin can't handle.  Most web servers aren't configured
to handle the amount of memory needed to export extra large databases.
 It's Apache (nginx, IIS, lighttpd, et al) that can't handle the size.

And I use phpMyAdmin to create my tables all the time.  If you are
afraid that you might use a reserved keyword for a field name, use the
` delimiters around the name of the field in your queries.  I know
that I've used desc as a field name before (yes, I could be less lazy
and just type out description).  I just make sure to escape it with `.
 Most frameworks will automatically do this for you (for all field
names, not just reserved words).  If you aren't using a framework,
there is no reason you can't do it yourself.

SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE `field` = 'value'

It may take a little getting used to, but it's a good habit to get into.

I believe he's referring to server-side validation ("validate input").
 Earlier Kristina said "you'll want to use a combination of
client-side (form) validation and good database design."  While
client-side validation is nice for the user (they don't have to wait
for the page to reload), using client-side validation doesn't replace
the need to validation the data once it gets back to the server.

Exactly.

Though Bev, you do have a good point, one needs to escape (filter) output 
as well.

Hi Andy,

I hate javascript so I never validate anything client side, but thanks
for clarifying.

Just to clarify, what I meant was that I always validate server side
with PHP, never client side. I don't want to get hollered at for not
validating. ;)

Bev:

Javascript is just another language AND a way to interact with the 
user that php can't. It's just another tool to learn and use.

I need to be pay more attention to the differences between the way PHP &
MySQL handle things. Becuase they always seem to go hand in hand, it's
easy for me to forget that they're two separate languages.

Wow, thanks for taking the time to do that. At some point between now &
next weekend I'm going to gather everyone's examples and play around
with them so I can see what happens for myself.

I'll keep that in mind.

That's an important point, knowing that PHP can sometimes be a little

I use backticks all time to avoid ambiguity in Database and Table
names. I have never had any problem with them but I HAVE had problems
with not using them in the past where the mysql on the server that I
was using didn't like queries that didn't have them, go figure?

Bev:

While you don't validate client-side, you certainly can confirm and 
therein lies it's usefulness.

Take this for example:

http://webbytedd.com/c/form-calc/

That would be a nightmare to handle just with php. Every tool has it's job.

I use the XAMPP from Apachefriends and the first thing I ditch is phpMyAdmin. 
I probably should give it a shot again, but it used to be very limited and 
buggy. I find the MySQL GUI tools do a good job. They lack a bit of quality as 
well (although that depends on the build a lot), but they got all you need and 
are darn easy to use.

A really nice MySQL frontend for Windoze is Luckasoft's client (see 
http://www.enginsite.com/MySQL-client-manager-and-GUI-for-MySQL.htm). The only 
problem I have with that one is that it costs 30$. I was lucky and at some 
point got a free license. Luckasoft also makes an IDE for PHP, which is really 
not bad. I just hope Sergey Lucka found some time to reimplement the debugger 
correctly so that it doesn't stop at the beginning of each script file. That 
is really annoying and made this otherwise fine and inexpensive IDE not very 
useful for the hobby development that I do.

Sorry, I'm digressing....

Yeah, I know, and I do use it when I feel it's the best option (or
sometimes the only option), but I just intensely dislike it. I know this
is going to sound irrational, but I hate the way it looks. It's fugly.

I guess I also resent it for the way people have abused it. I loathe
having control of my browser taken away from me, y'know? It irks me to
no end to have ads or windows or widgets popping up, not to mention
having my browser window resized. For the past few years I've been using
the NoScript add-on with FF so that I only have to deal with it if I
want to.

I agree. I didn't mean to imply that I refuse to use it or that I would
disregard it even when it's the best option, I just try to avoid it as
much as possible.

For example, I use it to generate an "are you sure...?" alert when
someone wants to delete a database record, for certain menus &
slideshows, rollovers, to get the size of a user's browser window,
display local time, etc.

PHP has helped me understand it a little better, and I've recently
gotten some books on DOM scripting & Ajax because I'm well aware that
simply disliking something doesn't mean I'm not going to have to deal
with it if I intend to continue doing what I'm doing. But it doesn't
mean I have to like it.  ;)

You are not alone in those opinions.  There are a lot of people who
agree with you.

Have you tried using a JavaScript framework?  They definitely help
eliminate a lot of the clunkiness.  ExtJS, jQuery, Prototype, and YUI
are a few of the bigs ones.  My personal favorite is jQuery.

I don't know if it can be changed either, but I'm certainly going to be

I'll have to try that. I think I'm also going to see if I can talk my
employer into getting paying for Navicat. It caught the table naming
issue right away, so that's a plus. Besides, having a tool that allows
me to see a graphic representation of my table relationships helps
tremendously as I need to  see things in order to learn & retain them.

LOL! Hey, I'm 47, contentedly divorced, spend all my time on the
computer smoking & drinking coffee, and my only house mates are my two
cats. I think I'm well on my way to being that weird old lady that all
the kids in the neighborhood are afraid of. :)

jQuery is my favorite too. I started using it about a year ago and now I

Pretty much every line of my code is commented--if it wasn't I'd never
remember how to do anything from one day to the next--I only took out
the comments because I didn't want to bore you guys with it. I feel
better knowing that it's okay to be verbose, so thanks for that.

I think that may be where I've often been going wrong--i.e. I try to
think about all of it at once, then I get confused and panic. Great
advice; thanks.

Good stuff. Lack of normalization has cause me a lot of grief so far.

Which is exactly what started this subthread.  Delimiting identifiers is 
a bad practice that creates way more headaches than it solves.  Of 
course, feel free to stick to it.  I'll just pray I never get called in

Hi Leam,

Do you want to help too? If so, I think we're supposed to discuss things

The more the merrier - certainly more than one person involved would be a

Yeah, let's head over to the Org list since this one is getting enough
traffic as it is and I'll follow-up later today (anyone else is welcomed to

I was trained from the get-go back when I was using Access and SQL 
Server in the 90s to never, ever use reserved words for table or field 
names...and also to never use just "id" for the primary key field name.

I'm wondering why both phpMyAdmin and a number of the boilerplate PHP5 
frameworks' database code bases that I've seen all seem to be pushing 
the use of these delimiters around really, every single table and field 
name at all times, whether required or not.  I hadn't given it much 
thought until this thread but the amount of them that I've seen over 
the past year or so has skyrocketed.

In all honesty I didn't give much thought, either, to exactly why they 
were there and just removed them due to my longstanding habits in 
writing queries.

To my mind, for phpMyAdmin and code frameworks out there to be 
promoting what is, no matter how you frame it, nearly universally 
considered bad practice, by promiscuously using these delimiters 
everywhere is just scary.

Is there some push on the part of MySQL to require these delimiters as 
a matter of course in some future version, or...?

Hi Kristina,

I'm probably going OT when I shouldn't, but I'm so glad you mentioned
that because I was just wondering about it yesterday. I started out
using "id" because it was easy when I needed to use PHP to delete
records form different tables and such, but then sometimes it got
confusing so I started using names like "prod_id".

Besides what I discovered on my own, are there other reasons it's
considered bad practice? I'm very interested in knowing.

    I'm afraid that this is getting us back to magic_quotes_gpc:  
because now I might want to write

$first_name=$Object->FirstName;

    and then do something with $first_name that isn't writing it into 
HTML.  magic_quotes_gpc was effective protection against a certain 
category of HTML injection faults,  but it made it difficult to write 
entirely correct code that processes the content of strings.  I prefer 
the model of "escape at the time of output" rather than preemptive 
escaping:  particularly these days,  where you might be escaping a 
variable to be a Javascript string literal instead of an HTML code.

    Today people are realizing that HTML/Javascript injection attacks 
are difficult to stop (there are lots of clever ways to inject 
Javascript that you'd never think of),  and some systems are taking 
different approaches.  ASP.NET,  for instance,  has an "application 
firewall" built in that looks for dangerous inputs in form variables and 
that will abort your application if you get fed junk.  Although my first 
impression is that this is "magic_quotes_gpc all over again",  and I've 
definitely seen the system block legitimate input,  Microsoft has done a 
good job of justifying this behavior.

    It makes some people feel dirty,  but you can do this with global 
variables,  assuming your template system remembers to set them when you 
get in or out of a template.  My own "php on nails" system has quite a 
few functions that behave differently if serving a web page or run from 
the command line.

But you'd always be writing into HTML.  The escaping as it's done above is
only after a regular data object has been adapted/pushed into an HTML
template.  The original data is never changed, and the escaping is use case
specific.  Back in my model/controller, my data object gives raw data, just
as it's stored.

I could write an adapter and push data in, that let's say, is for SQL - JSON
- CSV - XML - etc.  Each adapter would wrap the data as appropriate.  If I
had an adapter for MySQL SQL generation and one for Oracle SQL generation,
they would even escape things differently, based on the type of SQL (and
connection resource/charset/etc in fact).  Very different from magic_*

No argument with HTML injection being a mess, but the above example is
exactly "escape at the time of output" - and escape based on the exact
destination, so it's very granular.

Mine does - they aren't "global" but scoped only for that template.  When an
object is pushed in, it's adapted/wrapped with an object that is designed
specifically for output in whatever type of template I'm dealing with.

Ditto - PHP on nails, I like that...

Late to this party, but something I find useful wrt to NULL is that php's isset() will return FALSE if a variable is NULL. It would return TRUE if the same variable was set to 0 or empty string.

I think I get that part now: The moment it has a known value, even if
that value is '' or zero, then it's no longer NULL (at least in the
world according to MySQL).

Hans, you're going to make my head explode. LOL

Oddly, while I go to Wikipedia probably a dozen times a day for answers,
it never occurred to me to look up NULL there. Go figure.

Noted.

    That could work well,  but I do have some fear that a person who's 
familliar with the framework wouldn't get into the html escaping habit 
when they write some script that depends on it.  I also have times that 
I do string manipulation in a template (or use a function that does 
string manipulation),  and in those cases,  getting stuff escaped out of 
the data layer would be a distraction.

    I often find myself developing tiny things that don't fit entirely 
into a framework and it's nice to have conventions that make it easier 
to do the right thing with or without a framework.

    "Nails" is a library,  not a framework.  Every language makes 
programmers prone to certain mistakes;  goal #1 of nails is to provide 
simple answers to the simple problems that bug PHP programmers day in 
and day out.  For instance,  there are G() and P() functions to get GET 
and POST variables that undo magic_quotes_gpc if it's turned on.

    On top of that I've got a few "framework" stacks that I can put on 
for particular sorts of work...  However,  nails improves the 
readability and reliability of even the simplest scripts,  so long as it 
doesn't run into a namespace conflict.

It has a steep learning curve and can be very slow at times. That
considered, it is designed in an incredibly modular manner, so you can
pretty much provide an alternate module for any built-in code, so,
it's highly customizable. It has one of the organized code bases I've
ever seen.

Yes I've already developed a module that provides alternate code for built-in code...but the problem I am having is that I am trying to update the totals, grand totals, tax totals, for orders and quotes but it seems like i set the value inside of one object..then inside another object I try to get the value that was previously set and its the original magento value and not my newly specified value.

be sure to call the save method after you call the set.

ex
$myOrder    = Mage::getModel('sales/order');
$myOrder->load($orderId);
$myOrder->setState(Mage_Sales_Model_Order::STATE_PROCESSING, true, 'Order
Processing Started '); //any other set method will work here
$myOrder->save();

be sure to call the save method after you call the set. 

ex 
$myOrder = Mage::getModel('sales/order'); 
$myOrder->load($orderId); 
$myOrder->setState(Mage_Sales_Model_Order::STATE_PROCESSING, true, 'Order Processing Started '); //any other set method will work here 
$myOrder->save();

It has a steep learning curve and can be very slow at times. That 
considered, it is designed in an incredibly modular manner, so you can 
pretty much provide an alternate module for any built-in code, so, 
it's highly customizable. It has one of the organized code bases I've 
ever seen.

Bev,

Essentially the thinking is that whenever you're processing code that 
involves a lot of tables or a lot of queries (and returned results), 
you end up with a bucketload of things named 'id' to handle.  

For instance imagine pulling out the contents of ten tables through ten 
queries in one script, and all the ID fields are named, id.  Or if you 
are doing a SELECT query where you are pulling stuff from 3 tables at 
once and all three of them have a field that you need to reference 
named, you guessed it, id in all three cases.  

The thinking being that if you don't name everything 'id' then you 
won't make mistakes caused by everything being named 'id'.

The flipside of the argument is that it gets darn annoying always 
forgetting whether or not in this table the ID is prodid or prod_id or 
productid or whatever it may be...and you're looking it up for the 6th 
time that day at 2 AM....

Or you inherit a database that's got fun ID field names like 
cat_subCat_xtab_id and you start cursing the day that someone came up 
with the silly idea that naming ID fields 'id' was a bad idea...When 
you start muttering things like "this is a database, not the Iowa 
Writer's Workshop" under your breath, you know it's time to leave and 
get that cold beer.

And you've got to be consistent with your own database design.  If you 
decide now to go with prod_id, stick with that, don't all of a sudden 
start to think that the underscore is "so last year", and start to use 
prodid...so you don't get confused between databases.  I've been guilty 
of getting bored with using the same old, same old field names over and 
over and making my life more difficult than it has to be...

I've tended to think over the years that this "rule" has significant 
points both for and against.

So true.  Using "id" as the primary keys means you need to make aliases 
in queries over and over and over.  Then there's the possibility of 
having inconsistently named aliases for the same field in different 
queries, so it's hard to remember what you're dealing with inside your 
PHP code.  Most importantly, if you name everything "id," then you have 
to explicitly spell out your JOIN statements in an ON clause

SELECT product_name, vendor_name
FROM product
JOIN vendor ON (vendor.id = product.vendor_id)

When it's so much easier to take advantage of USING clause:

SELECT product_name, vendor_name
FROM product
JOIN vendor USING (vendor_id)

And that's where a thorough naming standards come in.  Name tables 
singluar (person, pet, product, etc).  Name the primary key field 
<table_name>_id.  No guessing involved.

It's always seemed easier and clearer to me to use WHERE instead of JOIN 
(where the table IDs are indeed named id, and the foreign keys are 
labeled with the table name):

SELECT product_name, vendor_name
FROM product, vendor
WHERE vendor.id = product.vendor_id

but maybe that's just my ignorance
