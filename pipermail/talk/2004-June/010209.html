Well if an economic system were to limit you to 5% of the total market we'd all eventually be undermined (<A HREF="http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html">http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html</A>).  

Innovation is the single ingredient that allows countries like the US to keep such a large slice of the world's economic pie, even with open/liberal/free trade.  We just need to make sure we don't start outsourcing it as well.
