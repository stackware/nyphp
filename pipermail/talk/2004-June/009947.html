<PRE>I'd like to weigh in here because I'm in a position to have my job pay 
for training and have been wondering for a while when the TBA's on the 
training ramp cert. page were going to become actual dates.  I think the 
best thing I can contribute to the conversation is a summary of what I'd 
like to get out of some PHP +related training.

First of all I came to PHP (and web stuff in general) via photography, 
design, cooking, biology etc.  So, I started using PHP because it's easy 
to to a lot of things.  But, basically I don't know what I'm doing and 
have been floundering around for a while wondering how to get my 
bearings when there are so many other (better IMHO) ways to spend time 
than in front of a computer.

That said.  I would like to gain a more solid understanding of the 
fundamentals of the language itself.  As well as enough familiarity with 
the other parts of the 'framework' to be confident that I am proceeding 
with a project in a way that makes sense instead of going off on a 
tangent (which is easy when there are so many alternative ways to go 
about a task).

As an employee at a medium-sized university I will never be 
administering the servers or compiling the PHP, but I would like to know 
enough about Apache etc. to be able to confidently interact with the IT 
dept that does (eg lobby for a new mod in PHP, or not be so in the dark 
(where they like to keep people) about the environment I'm trying to 
work in).

I should shut up now.  But as far as certification goes I don't care 
about certification (and I totally agree that casual conversation can 
speak volumes about a potential employee) but if I can learn more about 
the things I'd like to know and get a certification to show to the 
people out there who do care about certifications, then so much the better.

Hope that's somewhat helpful from one potential student's perspective.
And, I hope you figure all this out soon so I can come down and take 
some classes soon...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>How do people feel about &quot;official&quot; certification as a qualified PHP

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thies Arntzen once said:
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;I could teach PHP to a monkey, if I had enough bananas.&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One of the main advantages of PHP is that it 
</I>&gt;<i>is a small and 'intellectually manageable' language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You can get a pretty good grasp of PHP, the language, 
</I>&gt;<i>in an afternoon -- if you come from another programming 
</I>&gt;<i>discipline (C++, Java, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But PHP doesn't operate in a vacuum -- 
</I>&gt;<i>it works together with an operating system, 
</I>&gt;<i>a web server, and more often than not with 
</I>&gt;<i>a database (and that's not including permutations 
</I>&gt;<i>with PHP as a CLI)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>When it operates like this PHP is much more 
</I>&gt;<i>than a language. When PHP works with the other 
</I>&gt;<i>components, it becomes a framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's why at NYPHP we have this concept of 
</I>&gt;<i>'AMP' (Apache MySQL PHP) training -- i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i>PHP doesn't operate in a vacuum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>To digress for a moment, this would probably be 
</I>&gt;<i>a lot clearer if someone (me) had done a 
</I>&gt;<i>better job explaining the training on the 
</I>&gt;<i>pages of NYPHP's website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(I could use some help here. I invite all 
</I>&gt;<i>interested parties to drop a line to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Michael Southwell
</I>&gt;<i>VP, Education Department
</I>&gt;<i>NYPHP
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">michael.southwell at nyphp.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>and request membership to the Education 
</I>&gt;<i>Department mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is a golden opportunity to help shape 
</I>&gt;<i>not just the web pages at NYPHP -- but 
</I>&gt;<i>to work together on forging the future curriculum 
</I>&gt;<i>at NYPHP. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Since I am digressing, let me also say 
</I>&gt;<i>you don't have to have an advanced degree in 
</I>&gt;<i>education or be a PHP guru to help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Everybody on this list has an area of 
</I>&gt;<i>expertise, which can greatly help our 
</I>&gt;<i>effort -- so please consider this: 
</I>&gt;<i>You can make a *BIG* difference in the PHP 
</I>&gt;<i>community and help it to grow, if you decide 
</I>&gt;<i>that is something you want)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Back to the original topic (PHP certification), 
</I>&gt;<i>what is meant by PHP certification?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If it means you know the language, then 
</I>&gt;<i>it strikes me that it wouldn't be to 
</I>&gt;<i>valuable (that is, of course, if you take it 
</I>&gt;<i>as a given that you could learn the language 
</I>&gt;<i>in an afternoon).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Now if PHP certification means that you know 
</I>&gt;<i>all that stuff (the twelve chapters) which 
</I>&gt;<i>was included in the post about Zend 
</I>&gt;<i>certification, then I have some thoughts on that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One, it seems to ambitious.
</I>&gt;<i>I don't see how you could cover all that 
</I>&gt;<i>ground in even a hundred questions on an 
</I>&gt;<i>exam -- of course I haven't seen the book 
</I>&gt;<i>or the test, so perhaps I am just badly 
</I>&gt;<i>informed here -- much less seventy questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Two, it seems uneven.
</I>&gt;<i>It might be better to have a volume on 
</I>&gt;<i>PHP with databases, and a volume about 
</I>&gt;<i>PHP with XML -- instead of all in one 
</I>&gt;<i>book.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Basically, the NYPHP focus is going to 
</I>&gt;<i>be on AMP certifications (and even there, that 
</I>&gt;<i>might be too broad -- i.e. perhaps it should 
</I>&gt;<i>be broken into WAMP, XAMP, and LAMP)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you don't agree, join the Education 
</I>&gt;<i>Department. We work by consensus -- 
</I>&gt;<i>your voice will be heard.
