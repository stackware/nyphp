&gt;<i> I would agree with you that is not solely Zend's idea

</I>
I think Daniel is referring to the fact that Zend hired these people as
consultants to help create the certification.

&gt;<i> But what I am saying is that I find it hard to put 
</I>&gt;<i> much stock in the value of a certification for a

</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't make any sense.
</I>
I would put a considerable amount of money against this. I know a lot of
talented programmers, and those who don't know PHP could not pass this
certification if given only a 24 hour notice. PHP interoperates with many
technologies, so the certification is broader than you might be thinking.

&gt;<i> The language is great. I love it. But it is just a tool.
</I>
And this is just a certification.

&gt;<i> I have never seen an accountant's business card 
</I>&gt;<i> that says: 'Microsoft Excel Certified'
</I>
This analogy doesn't work very well. When hiring an accountant, I can't
imagine anyone caring what tools are used. However, with most technology
projects, people do care. Have you seen a job announcement that simply
asks for a skilled and experienced Web application developer? I haven't.

&gt;<i> Now would you have the web development community 
</I>&gt;<i> believe that it would be of value to have 
</I>&gt;<i> something like: 'ZEND Certified in PHP' 
</I>&gt;<i> (or something to that effect) on *their* 
</I>&gt;<i> business cards?
</I>
I wouldn't measure the value of a certification according to whether
people would want it on a business card. I think a resume is a more common
and appropriate place for this.

&gt;<i> Further, you make it sound like anybody who is 
</I>&gt;<i> anybody in the PHP world is behind this initiative.
</I>
I think that's a misinterpretation. He is just trying to make it clear
that Zend did not create this by themselves.

&gt;<i> Some proponents for Perl certification described 
</I>&gt;<i> the vote at an OSCON meeting as being 100 to 7 
</I>&gt;<i> in favor of certification.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reality is that half of the people to whom 
</I>&gt;<i> the vote was put were 'noticeably silent' in that 
</I>&gt;<i> they abstained from voting.
</I>
Rather than wasting time trying to predict opinions, Zend is doing
something, and people will have a chance to voice their opinions with
their wallets. I'm sure their voices will be heard.
