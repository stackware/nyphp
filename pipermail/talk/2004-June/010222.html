Yes I  know - though starting now without any savings to live on during 
the transition would be a tad foolish don't you think? Im working on 
some online business ideas to make enough money to fund the departure...

&gt;<i> Because once you become a &quot;farmer&quot; you will see how the farming 
</I>&gt;<i> business operates. You will learn how it manages risk, how it manages 
</I>&gt;<i> information flow, and how it squeezes profits from the channel, the 
</I>&gt;<i> market, the government. Then you will see opportunity -- in deploying 
</I>&gt;<i> IT within farming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You will start to deploy IT in new inovative ways, as a &quot;farmer&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> Pretty soon you will be carvig out a new niche, and the other farmers 
</I>&gt;<i> will be following your lead, and the IT revolution will extend deeper 
</I>&gt;<i> into farming because of you. And then one day, you will look at the 
</I>&gt;<i> racks of servers you have built up in your barn, and say &quot;I'm thinking 
</I>&gt;<i> of getting out of IT.... perhaps moving far away and becoming  
</I>&gt;<i> arafting travel guide....&quot;
</I>
Believe me, I have thought about this many times (Visions of hydroponic 
farms with computer-controlled climate and irrigation systems feature 
prominently in my thinking).

I have a friend who left New York and went to live in New Mexico. He 
bought 6 acres outside of Taos and is planning to build an &quot;earthship&quot; 
(for those of you that don't know, an earthship is an 
environment-friendly self-sustaining dwelling - we're talking solar 
panels, geothermal systems, harvesting rain water, natural sewage 
systems, etc etc. See <A HREF="http://earthships.org/">http://earthships.org/</A> for info).

&gt;<i> I am hopeful everyone working for someone else in IT will see the 
</I>&gt;<i> light before they are 45 years old, and go their own way. If you are 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to take the risk of chucking it all to become a farmer, why 
</I>&gt;<i> not take the lesser risk of chucking the job to go it on your own?
</I>
I was thinking of before I get to 40 years old myself...
