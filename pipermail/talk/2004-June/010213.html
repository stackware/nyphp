I guess the first thing you would need to do is define &quot;society&quot;.
Is it just the US or the world or some subset thereof?

&gt;<i> capitalism has historically served as a mechanism for increased

by allowing the individual entity to work towards their own selfish
ends.

See? :-)

&gt;<i> my nation and the world at large.  so long

</I>
Keep in mind that the aggregate view and the local view are fractal;
we're discussing world v nation, but it also applies to nation v state
and regions v municiplaities, etc.

&gt;<i> (btw, this is what is so cool about the free software movement -- it is

</I>&gt;<i> individualist hording.)
</I>
True, but the selfishisness (in FOSS term the &quot;itch to scratch&quot;) is
still paramount, IMO.
