<PRE>I agree, but this awakening may not happen all at once or even fully 
within our lifetime. And I don't think it is cost effectiveness that 
will drive the awakening but a crippling breakdown from an attack on 
Microsoft machines across the world, leaving a large part of the  
business world helpless for a few hours or days. Then, world leaders 
will unite, and mandate Open Source as not an option but as a  world 
security mandate. Back to sleep. zzzzzz
