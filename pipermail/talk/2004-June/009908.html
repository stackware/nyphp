<PRE>NYPHP List:
This email was sent out to selected Zend clients. Due to requests from
individuals from this group I would like to extend the offer to NYPHP.
Please don't hesitate to contact me at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">daniel at zend.com</A> with any
questions you many have.

Best,
Daniel


Dear PHPer,

As the PHP company, Zend has been approached by many asking it to
establish an industry standard that recognizes PHP expertise. In order
to do that Zend has partnered with PHP experts worldwide to create the
Zend PHP certification exam. The Zend PHP Education Advisory Board has
specified a curriculum essential to demonstrate expert proficiency in
PHP.


Benefits of Becoming a Zend Certified PHP Programmer 
====================================================
In today's competitive market, it's more difficult than ever to stand
out from the competition. The Zend PHP Certification credential offers
a variety of benefits:
- Differentiate yourself from competitors when looking for a new job
or at your annual salary review
- Get your resume noticed
- Gain recognition from your employer
- Have your profile displayed in Zend's &quot;Yellow Pages for PHP Professionals&quot;


Who's on the Zend PHP Education Advisory Board?
==============================================
Andi Gutmans
Chris Shiflett
Damien Seguy
Daniel Kushner
David Sklar
Derick Rethans
George Schlossnagle
John Coggeshall
Marco Tabini
Marcus Boerger
Martin Jansen
Zeev Suraski

As with any certification of this magnitude, the test questions need to be
checked for clarity and performance by means of a beta exam. The beta exam
consists of up to 110 questions instead of just 70 that will make it to the
final exam. Those who take the beta will qualify for the Zend PHP
Certification once we know which questions will be in the final exam and if
enough questions were answered correctly - the passing score will be
determined after the beta analysis.

I would like to invite you to take the beta exam available on June 21st
through June 30th. The cost of the exam is only $80 as opposed to the final
examination fee of $200.

Beta exams are limited so I urge you to sign up as soon as possible to
reserve a place at a test center near you. 

Visit <A HREF="http://www.vue.com/zend/">http://www.vue.com/zend/</A> to register for the beta.
