What bothers me though, is often the workers are sacrificed for 
short-term gain (especially in public companies that have to appease 
that whore called &quot;Wall Street&quot;). But what makes it especially evil, is 
that most of management get to line their own pockets with the money 
they have saved rather than invest better in a smaller workforce. There 
are other ways of saving money that do not involve removing loyalty from 
the workplace and building bigger chasms between ployers and employees.
