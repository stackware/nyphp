&gt;<i> outsourcing was being used to drop salary requirements for techs; move
</I>&gt;<i> work offshore, lay off people, salaries drop, then bring the work back on
</I>&gt;<i> shore hire the techies at much lower prices.
</I>
this is begging the question:  when does an economic system undermine the
needs of the the society it is designed to serve?  (it's a loaded question,
too.)

capitalism has historically served as a mechanism for increased
opportunities.  i'm starting to wonder how the current state of neo-liberal
economic policies are serving me, my nation and the world at large.  so long
as labor practices are fair in these off-shore locations, the gain remains
static (or even greater) in the aggregate world view, but that doesn't help
the local needs.

on-shore this activity benefits the rich and the anonymous stockholder but
undermines the very society in which they participate?

(btw, this is what is so cool about the free software movement -- it is
based on the bounty of communal cooperation and not the scarcity of
individualist hording.)

noodling.
