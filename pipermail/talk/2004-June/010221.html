Hrm, when I first started PHP I was coming from a Microsoft shop. They
had me build a code repository in PHP as a way for me just to get my
feet wet.

&gt;<i> In VB/M$ land, &quot;Hello World&quot; is an example of professional programming. 
</I>&gt;<i> In OS/PHP land (to read these recent posts) even writing phpBB is unworthy.
</I>
There are good examples and bad examples, the majority on &quot;app&quot; sites is
not good, we are not saying they all are. Pick careful.

&gt;<i> People need to feel they are &quot;OK programmers with an opportunity to be 
</I>&gt;<i> great&quot; not crappy-programmers-in-need-of-improvement. Granted, we are 
</I>&gt;<i> all crappy programmers seeking perfection, but might that confidence be 
</I>&gt;<i> the separator between the M$ camp followers and the OS people?
</I>
True, have him make a simple app with no real expectations for it. Give
him a two week (or one) timeline. The main points to focus on are
Database queries (selects/inserts/deletes) and display (for web based
stuff)

&gt;<i> Asking this guy to build a box is way over his head. Agreed that is a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem, but giving him a box to build doesn't get him there. Asking him 
</I>&gt;<i> to hack on an ad-server app will require careful 1:1 scrutiny with a 
</I>&gt;<i> considerable level of PHP expertise - not an option. I agree completely 
</I>&gt;<i> about the need to rate hotscripts and the like for &quot;appropriateness&quot; but 
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't exist either. These are great ideas for talking an average 
</I>&gt;<i> PHPprogrammer to new levels of understanding (I'd like to do them 
</I>&gt;<i> myself, thanks for the suggestions :-) but not the newbie/VB person.
</I>
I agree, asking a noob to 'build' a box is going to send them into panic
mode. I suppose that baby-steps would be a better option here.

&gt;<i> I am very close to setting him loose with the CLI as a parsing tool and 
</I>&gt;<i> having him build an access log analyzer.... tons of good PHP to do, 
</I>&gt;<i> modular approach, constant parallels to VI and *nix CL tools, etc and I 
</I>&gt;<i> can even set him loose on WebTrends so compare results... but he's not 
</I>&gt;<i> my hire so unless I can garner value from that idea I can't afford the time.
</I>
Perfect, that will also teach him a lot about linux in the process
without throwing him in the deep end.

&gt;<i> I might add that these people spend alot more money on tools and stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> than the OS people I know... perhaps if there isn't a community resource 
</I>&gt;<i> to encourage/support crossover to OS/PHP land,  there is opportunity for 
</I>&gt;<i> a short course on building a box/setting up LAMP, to be sold to such 
</I>&gt;<i> people used to buying things like VB add-ons and widgets?
</I>
VB programming has a lot of comparatives in PHP (you would be surprised)
a lot of the core ideas and techniques are the same..

Speaking of which, mono 1.0 came out today so I am off to play with
that, I may move my little sprites app over to GTK#
