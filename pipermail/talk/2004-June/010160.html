Yeah, I hope I wasn't putting words in your mouth.  I guess I was probably
responding more to my perception of a common mindset than to your particular
comment.  It may be that many in this group and many in our industry in
general are more broad-minded than that.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't mean to rant, but I hear and am bothered by the &quot;protect our
</I>jobs&quot;
&gt;<i> &gt; idea in many industries, and I think we are probably doing more to hold
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ourselves back with that philosophy than actually improve our real
</I>quality
&gt;<i> &gt; of life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I never meant to make the &quot;protect our jobs&quot; argument. In fact I have been
</I>&gt;<i> known to outsource a thing or two myself. As for me, it is disheartening
</I>to
&gt;<i> know that this field in which I have invested so much time and effort into
</I>&gt;<i> is going away. It's not surpising, just disheartening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is one of the few fields I know of that the longer you are in it, and
</I>the
&gt;<i> more experience you have, the less money you make, and the less secure
</I>your
&gt;<i> future is. This of course is not necessarily due to outsourcing, but
</I>younger
&gt;<i> cheaper workers fresh out of college who are willing to do anything to get
</I>&gt;<i> their foot in the door, outsourcing is just the icing on the cake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course the common response is always... &quot;yeah but when the gaping
</I>&gt;<i> security hole is found who are they going to call&quot;. Not you of course,
</I>they
&gt;<i> will call the fresh graduate with a focus in Internet Security who is
</I>&gt;<i> willing to work for nothing to get their foot in the door, or the overseas
</I>&gt;<i> firm with a specialty to solve such problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You fortunately are not in a position where your advanced PHP knowledge
</I>lies
&gt;<i> at the heart of your job, so from your perspective outsourcing is a great
</I>&gt;<i> thing. However, the world only needs so many managers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for me, I am working very hard to get away from being a developer for
</I>&gt;<i> obvious reasons. The way I see it, you can never compete with someone who
</I>is
&gt;<i> happy to work for less than you feel you are worth. So I plan to shift
</I>focus
&gt;<i> myself, and get out while the getting is good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I am lucky, I too will be able to take advantage of and exploit foreign
</I>&gt;<i> workers at will. It's just like Marx pointed out many years ago, if you do
</I>&gt;<i> not own the means of production and are in a position to wield that
</I>&gt;<i> ownership to your own advantage and exploit others, you are at the butt
</I>end
&gt;<i> of a system for which you will always get screwed.
</I>&gt;<i>
