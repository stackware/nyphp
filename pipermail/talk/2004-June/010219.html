</I>I completely appreciate the posts, but right from the start these things 
are exactly what stops a VB person from going PHP.

In VB/M$ land, &quot;Hello World&quot; is an example of professional programming. 
In OS/PHP land (to read these recent posts) even writing phpBB is unworthy.

People need to feel they are &quot;OK programmers with an opportunity to be 
great&quot; not crappy-programmers-in-need-of-improvement. Granted, we are 
all crappy programmers seeking perfection, but might that confidence be 
the separator between the M$ camp followers and the OS people?

Asking this guy to build a box is way over his head. Agreed that is a 
problem, but giving him a box to build doesn't get him there. Asking him 
to hack on an ad-server app will require careful 1:1 scrutiny with a 
considerable level of PHP expertise - not an option. I agree completely 
about the need to rate hotscripts and the like for &quot;appropriateness&quot; but 
that doesn't exist either. These are great ideas for talking an average 
PHPprogrammer to new levels of understanding (I'd like to do them 
myself, thanks for the suggestions :-) but not the newbie/VB person.

I thought InvisionBoard would be good to show how OO *was* used with 
PHP4 scripts (it's totally coded around a constructor-based layout) but 
with PHP5's OO revamping of OO that may not be a good idea. I thought my 
own html header management stuff would be good for teaching how PHP is 
used as a server-side HTML management system, shy of templating, but 
there is way too much platform stuff involved, and the objectives are 
all SEO and semantic marketing - way over his head and not something I 
want to be training.

I am very close to setting him loose with the CLI as a parsing tool and 
having him build an access log analyzer.... tons of good PHP to do, 
modular approach, constant parallels to VI and *nix CL tools, etc and I 
can even set him loose on WebTrends so compare results... but he's not 
my hire so unless I can garner value from that idea I can't afford the time.

I might add that these people spend alot more money on tools and stuff 
than the OS people I know... perhaps if there isn't a community resource 
to encourage/support crossover to OS/PHP land,  there is opportunity for 
a short course on building a box/setting up LAMP, to be sold to such 
people used to buying things like VB add-ons and widgets?
