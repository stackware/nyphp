<PRE>I go back to the VB3 days and have used VB4 and VB6. When .NET came out 
I said, &quot;Dot to heck with that!&quot;

As for making the shift to LAMP, this was the approach I took (not all 
that different from what had been proposed by others).

a) Got an old PC.
b) Got RH Linux 9 bible and learned to set up and configure Linux and 
set up a web server (the PHundamentals article at 
<A HREF="http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/PH_virtualhosting.php">http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/PH_virtualhosting.php</A> is based, in part, 
on my experience with setting up a server). I had to reinstall it four 
or five times till I got it right.
c) Installed Putty and got used to using SSH.
(Note: the above (a,b,c) required learning how to set up services; using 
basic commands such as ll; mkdir; less; grep; how to set up permissions; 
how to use Pico, etc. All this stuff learned from setting up a box is 
useful.)
d) Picked up a bunch of books some of which are listed here 
(<A HREF="http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/PH_bookrecommendations.php">http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/PH_bookrecommendations.php</A>) though I 
would now add to the list Rasmus/Lerdorf &quot;Programming PHP&quot; and 
Williams/Lane &quot;Web Database Applications&quot; which has a great application 
to learn from.

I would not recommend throwing a VB coder into the land of &quot;classes and 
objects&quot; in PHP until the programmer has more familiarity with the 
workings of PHP. The syntactical differences between VB (pre VB.NET, 
that is) and PHP take a bit of getting used to.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for hacking on shit, I learned a *LOT* from hacking on the ad server

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as that displays a level of skill that the &quot;my first app&quot; guys will not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just some thoughts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I completely appreciate the posts, but right from the start these things 
</I>&gt;<i> are exactly what stops a VB person from going PHP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In VB/M$ land, &quot;Hello World&quot; is an example of professional programming. 
</I>&gt;<i> In OS/PHP land (to read these recent posts) even writing phpBB is unworthy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People need to feel they are &quot;OK programmers with an opportunity to be 
</I>&gt;<i> great&quot; not crappy-programmers-in-need-of-improvement. Granted, we are 
</I>&gt;<i> all crappy programmers seeking perfection, but might that confidence be 
</I>&gt;<i> the separator between the M$ camp followers and the OS people?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Asking this guy to build a box is way over his head. Agreed that is a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem, but giving him a box to build doesn't get him there. Asking him 
</I>&gt;<i> to hack on an ad-server app will require careful 1:1 scrutiny with a 
</I>&gt;<i> considerable level of PHP expertise - not an option. I agree completely 
</I>&gt;<i> about the need to rate hotscripts and the like for &quot;appropriateness&quot; but 
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't exist either. These are great ideas for talking an average 
</I>&gt;<i> PHPprogrammer to new levels of understanding (I'd like to do them 
</I>&gt;<i> myself, thanks for the suggestions :-) but not the newbie/VB person.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought InvisionBoard would be good to show how OO *was* used with 
</I>&gt;<i> PHP4 scripts (it's totally coded around a constructor-based layout) but 
</I>&gt;<i> with PHP5's OO revamping of OO that may not be a good idea. I thought my 
</I>&gt;<i> own html header management stuff would be good for teaching how PHP is 
</I>&gt;<i> used as a server-side HTML management system, shy of templating, but 
</I>&gt;<i> there is way too much platform stuff involved, and the objectives are 
</I>&gt;<i> all SEO and semantic marketing - way over his head and not something I 
</I>&gt;<i> want to be training.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am very close to setting him loose with the CLI as a parsing tool and 
</I>&gt;<i> having him build an access log analyzer.... tons of good PHP to do, 
</I>&gt;<i> modular approach, constant parallels to VI and *nix CL tools, etc and I 
</I>&gt;<i> can even set him loose on WebTrends so compare results... but he's not 
</I>&gt;<i> my hire so unless I can garner value from that idea I can't afford the 
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I might add that these people spend alot more money on tools and stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> than the OS people I know... perhaps if there isn't a community resource 
</I>&gt;<i> to encourage/support crossover to OS/PHP land,  there is opportunity for 
</I>&gt;<i> a short course on building a box/setting up LAMP, to be sold to such 
</I>&gt;<i> people used to buying things like VB add-ons and widgets?
