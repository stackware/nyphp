<PRE>I host a lot of people who use gallery, and it seems like every other
month there is a new security patch. I am not sure if there has ever
been a stable version without some sort of gaping exploit. They may
just do this so people will check the website every couple of weeks.

It wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have to manually upgrade 8
gallery installations by hand, but it is definitely a pain. I would
only suggest using gallery if you are going to be actively using and
adding new pictures to it.

I wrote something similar to what you are describing a few years ago
for an album of WTC pictures that gets hit heavily, and it's
definitely stood the tests of time. One of the problems (&quot;nice
features&quot;) with gallery is that it doesn't use a database. It uses a
plethora of flat files filled with huge serialized arrays. When you
get an extreme amount of traffic on a gallery installation, it can
very easily bring a server to it's knees. So depending on how you plan
on using it, it may be worth it to write a quick script to do what you
want.

Otherwise there are plenty of free applications for both windows and
unix that will take a set of pictures and plop out a static html
&quot;album&quot;.

Also just looked at the gallery website, another security issue posted
yesterday.
hoorah!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to post some pictures (from the recent Mermaid Parade in

</I>&gt;<i>
