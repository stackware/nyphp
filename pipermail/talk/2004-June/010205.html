I know of a money center bank, who (more than) hinted that they 
were looking into outsourcing. They suffered a brain-drain of 
about twenty developers (out of about 110) within two months.

The two executives responsible for the 'brainchild' also left 
the company -- ostensibly for greener pastures.
