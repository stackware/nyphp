You may be closer than you think.  A potential client I Was talking to
is married to a VP of a large comapny.  We were discussing outsourcing
and he mentioned (implying that the VPs were thinking this way) that
outsourcing was being used to drop salary requirements for techs; move
work offshore, lay off people, salaries drop, then bring the work back on
shore hire the techies at much lower prices.

Now, I'm not the type to wear tin-foil hats but I'm seriously thinking
about it. :-)

BTW, does anyone know of a successful off-shored project that wasn't
brought back on-shore because it was a disaster?  I've never heard of
one.
