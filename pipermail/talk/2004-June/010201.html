The threat is used all the time, but in my exerience good people who are 
threatened leave -- as opposed to settling for less pay. Maybe they 
don't lave right away, but they commit to leaving at first opportunity.

When a company burns its internal social assets it is doing so with a 
purpose; it has already made a decision to abandon the workers for a 
value proposition. Workers should not ignore those signs. It is my 
belief that most &quot;sick&quot; organizations are sick because management has 
made the decision, but failed to execute (yet) and the workers are in 
limbo (and in their guts they feel it). If workers took the clues and 
left, or if management made swift decisions, everyone would be better 
off. Unfirtunately senior management often second guesses itself, middle 
management holds on with disbelief or optimism, and the regular guys get 
screwed.

People say the rats are the first off a sinking ship because they can 
smell the future. The truth is the holds at the bottom of the ship fill 
with water first, causing the rats to run for dry land while everyone 
else waits around unaware that the holds are full of water and the ship 
is sinking.
