Gentlemen;

I've been playing with this for a full day now trying various formats 
without luck.  I'm convinced that I must be missing something.

So, before the weekend come around and I literally forget everything I 
know about this, I thought I would post my error sections for some peer 
assistance.

Can someone please take a look and see if there is anything obvious and 
advise (I'm beyond embarrassment).  The lines beginning with >>>> are 
debugging lines to show what is contained in certain fields.

/************************************************************************************/
/* Determine if Specified 'system_id' is new or existing and set action 
accordingly */

 >>>>	qb_default->db_host=[raid]

 >>>>	qb_default->db_user=[qb_user]

 >>>>	qb_default->db_password=[********]

 >>>>	qb_default->dbname=[quote_build_test]

	$dbh = 
mysql_connect($qb_default->db_host,$qb_default->db_user,$qb_default->db_password);

 >>>>	dbh=[Resource id #5]

	$rtn = mysql_select_db($qb_default->dbname,$dbh);

 >>>>	rtn=[1]

	$sql="select id from $qb_default->system_list where  id = 		 
'$system_id' limit 1";

 >>>>	sql=[select id from systems where id = '181' limit 1]

	$req=mysql_query($sql,$rtn);

 >>>>	Warning: mysql_query(): supplied argument is not a valid 		 
MySQL-Link resource


As you can see by the Warning message... mysql is stating that the $rtn 
field I am sending is NOT a valid resource.  However, it is the result 
of the previous mysql_select_db and seems OK.

What am I missing???

Thanks all!

I believe you would want to use $dbh and not $rtn\

You should be passing the connection resource ($dbh) to mysql_query 
(), not the result of mysql_select_db(). mysql_select_db() just  
returns a boolean.

Max, do you have any links for this? I have looked and looked and have
only been able to find the basic documentation that shows me how to
connect. And even with that I have had some issues.

Message-ID: <4571B24F.4010103@email.smith.edu>

Howdy,

I have a logout page where I destroy the session.  However, if I click 
one of the application links it lets me back in.  I believe the browser 
is loading the application page from history.  If I refresh the page it 
kicks me out to the login page, which is the desired behavior but I 
would like that to happen right away.

How do I ensure that my application pages are loading a fresh copy?  If 
I can make that happen then presumably it will prevent this issue.

The strange thing is that this doesn't seem to happen for another 
application I built but I haven't been able to find a difference in the 
code I wrote.  (Am testing both in the same browser.)

Thanks,

-Aaron

Hi,

    you need to set the page to not getting cached by a browser. I once 
looked this up and found several sources that claim that these two lines 
at the beginning of a page will turn caching off:
header("Cache-control: private");
header('P3P: CP="NOI ADM DEV PSAi COM NAV OUR OTRo STP IND DEM"');

 From what I can tell, this works. But to be honest, I have no idea what 
this really does or if it does anything, especially the second line. 
Writing this kinda makes me want to know more about it, so I did a quick 
google and found http://www.w3.org/P3P/ that has some more info. The 
first line is most likely needed to pass on the cache preferences 
through the header rather than take the browser default.

    Hope this helps,

             David

You can also look at some of the better AJAX tutorials. An AJAX request has
the same problem, and I have seen various ways to deal with it. The most basic
attaches a random # to every request, which is not the best way to go -- fills
up the local cache. Better methods do set the header as indicated below. A
quick google search found this:

header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT");
header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT");
header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
header("Pragma: no-cache");

Aaron:

I use this:

<?php # nocache.php
// this script prevents all caching

// expires on any past date
header ("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00: GMT");

// last modified at current date and time
header ("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . "GMT");

// for HTTP 1.1:
header ("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
header ("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);

// for HTTP 1.0
header ("Pragma: no-cache");
?>

Anyone see any problems with it?

Finally I have been able to add records to my LDAP directory (adding
organizations). The next step is to add addresses. I need to be able
add multiple addresses of various types (postal, business, mailing).

If an organization has mutliple addresses, how can I accurately
display and update those addresses? What throws me is that the 'st'
attribute is used for all addresses, and usually it only has one
value.

Let's say I have three addresses...

1 W. Test St. Columbus, OH 43015
100 High St. Columbus, OH 43015
7145 Wilson Bridge Rd. Columbus, OH 43017


...first, I need to display these three addresses in a table, then the
user needs to be able to select one of the addresses for updating. If
they update the third address, and change the State to 'NV,' then how
do I keep it from updating the 'st' attribute, which is used for the
other two addresses, to NV?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Alternating records to select in MySQL
Message-ID: <4575BEB6.30209@email.smith.edu>

Howdy,

Running into a wall trying to figure out the best way to accomplish the 
following:

I have a web form that allows the user to ask a question about a certain 
topic.

On the backend I have, say, five people available to answer questions 
for each topic. They are stored in a MySQL table.

What I want to do is select one of the five people and send the question 
to them.  That part is easy.  The next part is where I am running into a 
stumbling block.

The next time someone submits a question on this topic I want to select 
from the remaining four people/records who have not been contacted.

Then the next time select from the three people not contacted, then two, 
then one.

After all five have been contacted I want to reset their records so that 
I am choosing from all five again.

Thoughts on how to accomplish this?

Thanks,

-Aaron

Hi Aaron,

You need a column called something like `selected` in that table.  Set 
it to 1 if the person's been selected.  Once they're all selected, start 
over by setting them all to 0.  You'll have to write the logic in PHP 
for those steps, but that's the gist of it.

Does that work for you?

Your states should be relational.

Thanks Allen.  That sounds very much like what I was thinking.

I was getting hung up on some of the logic but I think it's more because 
I have been given a way-too-short deadline to get this done.  =|

Deep breaths...

Cheers, thanks!

Randal:

Close, but more like this:

st[0] = Alabama
st[1] = Alaska
st[2] = Arizona
st[3] = Arkansas
st[4] = California
st[..] = ...

where:

street[2]=7145 Wilson Bridge Rd.
city[2]=Columbus
sta[2]=15 (or whatever number Ohio is)
postalCode[2]=43017
adressType[2]=postal

You have a table in your dB that holds all the states, the user 
simply picks which state from an option list and the entry in your dB 
for that user now points to that state's table as an index instead of 
the previous state's index. It's a "one to many" relational dB.

You see, putting the state's name over and over again in the dB is 
redundant -- it's better to have a table of states than it is to 
repeat data.  The same holds true for zip codes and addressType as 
shown above.

I have a very complex app I've been working on currently at about three thousand lines of code. All of a sudden it started spitting out the following warning:

Warning: Unknown: 2 result set(s) not freed. Use mysql_free_result to free result sets which were requested using mysql_query() in Unknown on line 0

So I went through it line-by-line and added a mysql_free_result() after EVERY query, to no avail.

The worst thing about this error is that it doesn't give me a valid line number, so it's impossible to tell exactly where the bad queries are.

This is occurring on a php5/mysql5/apache setup.

Anyone have any suggestions? I'm out of ideas.

Add a debug_print_backtrace() before the free result or query.  I  
find it to be very handy in PHP5, although I wish there was a way to  
dump the results to a UDP port for catching it as well.

Hi Susan,

I've just started looking into using xAJAX and absolutely love it. Granted, I've not done anything useful with it yet but it seems to hav a LOT of promise. Looks like it might have really nailed the "easy to use" thing on the head.

Yeah, its one of things you can't go back once you get started.  I find 
it contributes very much to rigorous definitions of UI elements, as 
otherwise you get bogged down pretty quickly.

Greetings,

I'm not sure how to do the following, any tips?

I have a column in a MySQL table that contains varchars.  I would like 
to select all records where there are instances of more than one record 
for any given varchar.

So in plain language, the SQL statement would look something like:

select * from table where the occurence of each unique varchar in column 
A is greater than one.

Thoughts?  Thanks!

I'm pretty sure the subquery is redundant... I think this will work...

You know, I thought that too.  I had an Oracle window open at the time and
not a MySQL one.  Oracle won't let you do it, but I just checked and MySQL
will.

I don't have a code solution for you, but Google the CHECK and UNIQUE
predicates for the SQL language, I believe your answer lies within...

Also a good SQL reference book that has been a trusty partner for me is
the SQL Instant Reference by Sybex.

That did it, thanks Rob and Andy.

Rob's query did the trick.  I was getting a MySQL error with Andy's that 
I hadn't been able to figure out.

If you're using a MySQL version earlier than 4.1, subqueries aren't 
available.  Maybe that's why you got an error with Andy's query.

That's interesting about the query not working in Oracle.  I wonder if 
it's because field_name isn't specifically listed in the SELECT - like 
it doesn't like the "GROUP BY field_name" when * is used for the field 
list?  I've read that MySQL allows you to GROUP BY fields not listed in 
the field list, but other DBs give errors.

That's exactly why it doesn't work in Oracle.  I'm working against 9i right
now.  Maybe they added that ability in 10g.

Considering the history of calendars, I wonder how they did that?

It's one thing to estimate that 2000 years ago was 0006 -- but, it's 
a completely different thing to claim that 2000 years ago today was 
December 7, 0006.

One of Joe Celko's books gives  a pretty thorough run-down of the 
variations that have to be accommodated, including such things as the 
days that happened more than once and the days that never happened, and 
so forth.

Compared to what's happened in AD-land, the BC stuff is easy :)

I did a mysql_get_server_info and it returns as 3.23.58, so I guess 
that's why Andy's query was returning errors.

I guess 3.23.58 is a bit older?  Seems like most people are on version 4 
and some are on version 5?

Ted here is a site that has a brief mention of the two calendars.
http://www.kencollins.com/calendar.htm 

As you may/may not know the system was changes somewhere in the ?1600's?
or so. One October lost several days when the change over occured from
Julian to Georgian so you need to take that into condideration so
research well!

It's great working with the Intelligent Design people, you don't have
to worry about dates before 6000 BC.  What a relief.   Save all those
zeros.

Yeah... support for 4.0 was just dropped, so 4.1 is now the oldest 
current version.  5.1 is now available.  Version 5 adds many features 
(triggers, views, stored procedures, etc) that makes it more similar to 
Oracle.  I've heard there's a little performance loss between 4.1 and 5, 
however.

Yes, that's a good link and the "system" did change in the 1600's, 
namely October 4, 1582 (a Thursday btw).

Prior to that, the day of the week cannot be calculated easily. In 
order to understand why, we need to look at the calendar history.

Prior to Julius ruling Rome (BC 46) the Roman year was 354 days. When 
Julius came to power, one of his first challenge was to appease the 
farmers who complained because according to their calendar, spring 
time and the time to sow/plant, was actually mid winter. Julius hired 
a mathematician (Sosigenes) to figure out what went wrong.

Sosigenes suggested that the length of the year was wrong. It should 
have been 365.25 days. The extra .25 day after four years became the 
extra day added in February. However, Julius made a mess of 46 BC by 
adding a couple of months making the year 445 days long!

Of course, Sosigenes, not having a calculator, didn't realize that a 
solar year is really 365.2428935. His fix was off by 10 minutes and 
some seconds in a year --not bad for manual computation! This error 
over 1600 years, adds up to about 11 days.

This error was detected by astronomers who noticed that the vernal 
equinox (when light and dark periods are equal length) occurring on 
March 21 was becoming earlier and earlier and in 1582 it was on March 
10. So, Christopher Clarius, an astronomer, went to Pope Gregory XIII 
and addressed the issue.

After seeing all the calculations for 7 months, pope Gregory knocked 
off 11 days on October 4 1582. The next day, he decreed to be October 
15 (so October 5-14 in the year 1582 didn't exist), but to not upset 
the Jews with their Sabbath, the day of the week was NOT changed. Had 
Pope Gregory deleted the days properly (along with the dates), then 
the next day (October 15) would have been a Monday and this would 
have resulted in Jewish citizens working more than ten days before 
being able to observe their Sabbath. This of course would have been 
unacceptable, not even animals nor slaves can be put to work on the 
Lord's Sabbath (Exo 20:9,31:13,Lev 23:3 etc.)

To avoid the leap-year error again, Pope Gregory, decreed that every 
4 years a day will be added. However, on a turn of the century, it 
will only be added if it's divisible by 400. Hence, although year 
2000 was a leap year, while 1900 was not.

So, considering the history of calendars, I again state that I wonder 
how PostgreSQL has the ability to store B.C. dates?

Thanks Timothy, I'll check out that book.  The next thing(s) to add to 
my library is one or two good books on SQL/MySQL.

Sounds like a good holiday present to myself!

Cheers,

I'm trying to figure out how to map servers in such a way so I can use a php
script on one server to manipulate files on another without using ftp
functions.  For example: I have a file upload form on one server that will
use move_uploaded_file and put it on another server.   I'm not the
networking guy so I'm not sure what to tell them to do. I was told about SMB
web client (http://smbwebclient.sourceforge.net/), but I haven't tried to
set it up yet.  Any recommendations?

Our servers are windows 2000, and running php 4.3

thanks,

Windows comes with filesharing, you don't need a separate client.

Create a shared folder on the storage host. Map it as a network drive
on the web host. The web host can now write files to it as if it was a
local drive. You don't need anything beyond plain old Windows
networking.

I came across a "framework" for integrating ajax that works very well. 
It's worth taking a look at.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] freeing sql results
Message-ID: <3d672dbb43a242d9f3e63bcf1a50209b@localhost>

After a lot of trial and error I've narrowed down the offending query in my problem with sql results not freeing themselves up:

$query = mysql_query("SELECT activeID FROM activeAI WHERE locationID='$locationID' AND activeID <> '$activeID' AND isUndead=0");
$numOtherAI = mysql_num_rows($query);
mysql_free_result($query);

When I comment out this query, the error(s) go away. Variables $locationID and $activeID are both properly set.

Is there something horribly wrong with this query? Is m_f_r() just not working? Too many ANDs?

You really should check for errors when doing a mysql_query. Putting 
the query in a separate string helps.

$q = "SELECT activeID FROM activeAI WHERE locationID='$locationID' 
AND activeID <> '$activeID' AND isUndead=0";
$rs = mysql_query($q) or die("Problem with the query: $q<br>" . mysql_error());
$numOtherAl = mysql_num_rows($rs);
mysql_free_result($rs);

I did include "or die()"s, just neglected to put them into the email. No SQL syntax errors come back. 
The only kinds of errors I'm getting are that sql results are not being freed.
Tried passing the SQL into mysql_query as a separate string, too. No luck.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Does anyone have Ioncube experience?
Message-ID: <20061208132024.M70796@pinestream.com>

I am integrating a commercial php shopping cart that uses Ioncube to protect
some of the source. I've already encountered one problem where Ioncube is not
compatible with the Zend Studio Server debugger and wonder how it will work
with Zend Optimizer and opcode caching software like APC.

I'm wondering whether anyone has had experience with Ioncube -- good, bad or
ugly. Any other unexpected gotchas that I should know about before deploying
this in a production enviroment?

It will work ok with Zend Optimizer, just make sure that you're using
the latest versions of both Optimizer and the IONCube loader.

If you're installing the IONCube loader via php.ini, I believe it should
be initialized before Zend, the majority of my experience has been with
loading it dynamically.

The only other oddity I've seen was one machine which experienced random
segfaults when using Zend Optimizer together with IONCube.

The solution turned out to be changing from using AddType in the
httpd.conf to AddHandler, since the change there have been no more
segfaults.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT: revisiting window close methods?
Message-ID: <45797D28.3020103@fdcx.net>

Gentlemen;

As most of the php we create and maintain deals with browser 
interaction, one of those actions is to close the current window if/when 
the user click on the appropriate supplied button.

I have such a button on my page(s) that contains a tag that reads:

onclick="window.close();"

and I've tried numerous variations of the same such as:

document.close()
close()
javascript:window.close()
windowClose()

and others that I have seen referenced.

However, nothing happens when this is clicked in my particular app.  The 
button animates as expected but nothing happens.

The browsers tested with are all mozilla/firefox are varying versions 
older to current and I'm sure it is important to note that the window I 
am trying to close it the ONLY open window in the browser.  My research 
shows that this should close but possibly display a 
warning/acknowledgment message first.   I've also check through the 
preferences to see if there were any suppression settings and I've found 
none.

Can someone please advise as to how one should accomplish this task?

Thanks,

bobmct

A javascript list might be better. But try:

<a href="#" onclick="window.parent.close()">Close Window</a>

Also review:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT anyone interested in collaborating to use php to
 program Dymo printer?
Message-ID: <457986F3.6020505@fdcx.net>

Slightly OT - but...

I have several web projects where some of the results is to print 
formatted labels (not necessarily address) on a local or remote attached 
small label printer.  Of those that are available, I've selected the 
Dymo because its "supported" by cups and it can connect via USB.

I CAN get output to this printer by opening a pipe to "lp" and passing 
various parameters and then outputing my text.   However, I cannot send 
ANY formatting instructions or the printer stops printing.  It advances 
but nothing prints.

Seeing how Dymo doesn't support Linux and none of the other hardware 
related forums are interested...  I was wondering if anyone in this 
group has any interest in collaborating towards developing a method to 
get the control programming through to this type of printer.
Perhaps the ultimate goal would be to develop a module that would be 
available to all as has been done with many other tasks.

If anyone is interested, has access to or wishes to purchase and work 
with one of these inexpensive printers for this purpose, I would be most 
interested to hear from you.

Thanks to anyone who responds.

I think script mostly cannot close any browser window that was not opened by

Thanks. Sounds like it's not a showstopper. Certainly not worth
abandoning this shopping cart because of it...yet...

It will work ok with Zend Optimizer, just make sure that you're using
the latest versions of both Optimizer and the IONCube loader.

If you're installing the IONCube loader via php.ini, I believe it should
be initialized before Zend, the majority of my experience has been with
loading it dynamically.

The only other oddity I've seen was one machine which experienced random
segfaults when using Zend Optimizer together with IONCube.

The solution turned out to be changing from using AddType in the
httpd.conf to AddHandler, since the change there have been no more
segfaults.

Do you have the technical reference manual for the printer? url?
If the printer is form feeding or spitting out garbage, there might be 
an error in the control code's you're feeding to it.

you know i should look into this one day, i have never had the need or want
to push anything to a printer via php but it's a cool concept and i am sure
it can be accomplished.

I would review the license to see how it tries to restrict you from 
decoding and viewing/modifying the encoded portions. This becomes an 
issue when time has passed, they no longer support the product or 
perhaps are no longer responsive, or you have other problems you cannot 
resolve (such as phone home or security flaws).

It's a fact of life that encryption engines get cracked eventually, and 
when your competitors (including hackers) know better than you what your 
code is doing, you have an issue.

Currently the hottest area of search engine spamming is the CMS exploit 
- using security flaws in popular CMSs to insert back links onto 
people's web sites without their knowledge nor consent.

Try

$query = mysql_query("SELECT count(*) FROM activeAI WHERE locationID='$locationID' AND activeID <> '$activeID' AND isUndead=0");
list($numOtherAI)=mysql_fetch_row($query);
mysql_free_result($query);


It should conserve memory since MySql will be returning a single integer instead of the entire list of activeID's.

I don't push anything through a printer, but when I have to create 
something that will work on most/all printers, I generate a PDF file 
and let the user print it.

Hello,
 
I am totally new to PHP and NYPHP.  I've been trying for several days now to
install PHP, Apache and MySQL on my Win/XP system.
 
The Apache web server is functioning but I'm lost in the PHP configuration
files and have not a clue how to activate PHP.  The Apache web server
totally ignores the PHP script inside my little HelloWorld.php -
 
<html>
 <head>
  <title>PHP Test</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <p>Hello World from HTML</p>
 <?php echo '<p>Hello World from PHP</p>'; ?>
</body>
</html> 
 
I'm about to start searching through the NYPHP message archives, but if you
happen to know a link that will help me, I'd greatly appreciate hearing
about it.
 
All the best,
Bob

in httpd.conf file be sure to include
  LoadModule php5_module "C:/your/installation/php5apache2.dll"

and
  AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

Then (after restarting) apache, try
http://your.server.com/info.php

(contents of info.php: )
<?php
     phpinfo();
?>

and see what happens...

I think I'm making progress, but I'm not there yet.
 
I'm running PHP 4.4.4 and Apache 2.2.3.  This to get the best compatibility
with my two live sites at my web hosting service, where they run PHP 4.4.1
(one site) and 4.4.2 (the other site).  Apache is listed as 2.0.
 
I changed the httpd.conf as follows, but now Apache fails to start -

*	LoadModule php4_module "C:/PHP/php4apache2.dll"  - added among other
load module statements (C:\PHP is where the .dll is located).
*	PHPIniDir "C:/PHP" - added after DocumentRoot and before <Directory
/>
*	AddType application/x-httpd-php .php - added after "TypesConfig
conf/mime.types" in <IfModule mime_module>

Apache will start OK with the AddType statement, but not with LoadModule or
PHPIniDir.

If you go the prepackaged LAMP route, there is also EasyPHP, XAMPP, and 
WAMP for windows. All good installers,  none good for a public machine 
(security reasons).

Since your test file is HTML with embedded PHP, I assume it is named 
something.html or something.htm? In that case Apache will not pass it to 
the PHP engine by default. Check by looking at the source of the output 
page.. if you see the embedded PHP code that's what happened.

Rename it something.php and try again.

If you want to pass your .html files through PHP (some people do), you 
need to modify Apache's httpd.conf  or use an htaccess file to add the 
.html extension as a PHP application file type. For .php and .html  the 
line looks like this:

 AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .html

For edumacational purposes, the best test file might be one like this:

<html>
<head>
<title>PHP test Fle</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is HTML, and what follows is my php configuration:</h1>
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
</body>
</html>

Hi,

when I started with Apache and later with PHP I went through the same 
problems....but didn't know of NYHP. I use XAMPP from apachefriends.org 
for development, testing, and also as production server. I never had a 
problem with installation or security. Apachefriend's XAMPP is really a 
nice package and darn easy to install on either Windope or Linux.

Since then I never had a problem and now even EngInSite PHP Editor works 
with Apachefriend's XAMPP. It can't get any better!!!

    I really recommend to just download the XAMPP and start with 
PHP....unless you really do want to get through all the manual 
configuration. I recommend to reserve that for a later point.

          David

There are really good ideas here, both to patch the config files, and to
start from scratch with a preconfig such as XAMPP.  Thank you.
 
I'm very much inclined to go the preconfig route at this point, but would
appreciate your thoughts about the PHP version.  The web sites I support are
PHP 4.4.1 & 4.4.2 on Linux.  I was hoping to use my Win/XP to test my
scripts locally before moving them to the live sites.
 
Any thoughts on compatibility issues if I develop in v5 for deployment on
v4.4?

I just want to thank you all.  I dropped back and loaded XAMPP and things
are working much better.  I still have a lot of tinkering and learning
ahead, but that's something I can handle.
 
I was concerned about compatibility with my live web sites (PHP 4.4), but it
turns out that XAMPP offers both PHP 4.4 and 5.0, so I should be OK.
 
Thanks again for all your help.

Hello friends.  My apologies for the cross-posting, but I'm sending the same
request to all groups.

We are developing two new web programming courses at NCC, and we need some
statements from people in management and leadership positions in IT to
support the need for these courses, which will teach HTML, JavaScript, CSS,
PHP, JSP, and RDBMS interaction with MySQL.  If you feel you can help,
please e-mail me, and I'll send you the proposed course outlines.

Thanks in advance,

Something that I notice is often missing in whole or in part is an 
appreciation of architecture-level concerns.  In other words, people are 
often taught how to code, but not *what* to code or *where*.  The 
critical issues of where to place code between the tiers, and how to 
make such judgements, are often lacking. 

Another factor that often seems to be missing, strange as it seems, is 
the simple idea that all programs serve human goals.  In other words, 
some person somewhere is committing time and money to a system, and 
almost always it is for the purpose of gain.  While a good programmer 
will take pride in the quality of his craftsmanship, it often seems to 
be missing to take pride in serving the needs of the non-programmer who 
is depending on you.  While this may seem a "soft" issue compared to the 
nuts-and-bolts of PHP or SQL, it separates a useful employee from a 
useless one.

With those two ideas in mind, a personal beef of mine is the lack of 
understanding of what a database is and what it can do, so I'm always in 
favor of more emphasis in that area.

Finally, and this may seem strangest of all, the three most productive 
employees I've ever had knew nothing of our particular technology when I 
hired them.  In each case I hired and attitude and an aptitude and then 
showed them the language we were using and put them to work.  None of 
them was uneducated, I'm not suggesting no education was needed, but all 
of them were well grounded in general principles.  It seems the course 
outline suggested above would be a wonderful cornerstone for teaching a 
lot of very basic CS concepts, which might then produce some 
general-thinking employment candidates.

I concur completely.  One thing that would have made it obvious that the things you speak of had been considered is if UML had 
been listed prominently (alongside the programming languages & html).

Personally, I'd like to see new developers have a sense of version
control, what it's used for, what it's not good for, etc.  I've seen a
stunning number of developers - new and old - who don't have clue or
have the slightest motivation to use any of them...  and this is a
problem I've seen in the PHP, Java, and asp worlds.

Some good points, I think it would be cool to glue all these
applications into what could be a real project. A web site based on
the technologies that drives a Wiki that provides online disaster
relief updates from volunteers in the field.  They need databases,
communications needs, online revenue generating models, communications
links, etc.  You need to scan RSS feeds, how to write scripts that can
chat with a satellite, real time api-google mapping, custom blogs,
etc.

All the programming languages you are teaching here can be
Incorporated into something like that.

I greatly appreciate all the points you have all raised regarding these
classes.  Just as a point of information, I think you should all know that
the first of these two classes will not be the students' first programming
course.  It's the third, actually, if I have the prerequisites right in my
head.

Yes, I use the CakePHP framework ;-)

Exactly what kind of trouble are you having?  Getting errors?  Things  
just aren't saving?  Can you paste some code samples?  By default,  
the Session class acts as a wrapper for the $_SESSION variable, so  
you may want to check and see if that works, because it could just be  
a PHP problem.  Also, FYI, Cake has it's own mailing list (http:// 
groups.google.com/group/cake-php/) and IRC channel (#cakephp on  
freenode.net) where you may get more mileage faster (not that this  
mailing list isn't excellent ;-)).

Any other Windows Zend Studio users experience a marked slowdown in
the last couple weeks?

Closing open files, for instance, takes seconds per file.

Something has definitely changed on my system, but other apps don't
seem to be affected. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced
this.

Sometimes when the IDE won't start, you need to remove the file named
"port" in your Documents and Settings\ZDE folder.

If the IDE crashes and doesn't remove this file, it can hang on next startup.

I have had this problem on a randomly recurring basis for ages.
Sometimes it does take a while for Studio to close and once in a while
it does seem to take a few seconds to "think" between key clicks.

When I looked into it a while back, I thought it might have something to
do the number of classes and methods that have "awareness" in a project.
Try working on a single file, without opening a project, to see if the
problem persists.

Another thing I've tried when I want to get some serious coding (e.g.
coding, not debugging) done, is to shut down every background (and
foreground) process I can -- little ones like itunes stuff and Quickbook
updaters, but more importantly Apache and MySQL. Does make using the
debugger a bit tough though! Running Apache, MySQL, Outlook, FileMaker,
Fireworks, Word, etc. while running Zend Studio is a surefire disaster.

My two cents...

Cliff

P.S. I'm using Studio 5.1

Hello All,

I experianced this problem often when working with projects. It seemed to 
consume  A TON (dont' remember the #'s) of memory till it choked itself.

If i opened files and not projects it seemed to last longer. I tried a bunch 
of different things back then and now I just dont use Zend IDE. I dont like 
it.

Give me Emacs and a few putty windows.

Heh, well good luck!

I agree that it is probably a memory hog (combined with Java, don't
forget), but I do use it successfully on a lowly Pentium III with just
256M of memory.

Since yesterday my windows install of Zend Studio wont

You guys are talking about Windows and I am using Fedora Core IV, but...
ZDE has always been a PITA: slowing down, hanging, suspected of hanging
the whole system. I am using 5.1.0. I keep wondering if throwing more
memory and CPU at it would help. (Are you listening, Santa Claus?)

Good thing (or is it bad?) that its many virtues still persuade me to stay
with the program.

I would not even be on a Workstation w/ Zend studio < 1 gig of ram.  

Ive noticed a few hangups w/ networked mounts and SVN repositories.  But all in all nothing Im not used to on Windows.

I wonder if the latest round of MS problems would not grind networking to a halt on a few networked apps.

Thanks for everyone's responses, this is just something that happened
in the last couple weeks. I've seen the stability probs on Linux, it
feels like a Java app, etc. I can live with all that because it does
what I need it to do, and I have plenty of memory for it to play in.

It sounds as if it's local to my workstation. I don't know if that
changes my approach to the problem, but at least I can rule out
waiting on bugfix release.

Hm, I use Zend Studio with Fedora Core 6 and it works great(hate
to work w/o it...)...I have a P4/1GB ram, so nothing special.

IMHO, it's a 'good thing' this ZDE.  Eclipse has a long way to go
to catch up (but it will surpass, in time, I think)...now if Zend Studio
could just generate getters and setters!

Hi,

for those who look for a good alternative IDE, try Luckasoft's EngInSite 
PHP Editor. A professional IDE and not even expensive. I tried many PHP 
IDEs and find EngInSite to be the best. Agreed, there are some things 
that could be better, but Mr. Lucka is very responsive when it comes to 
improving the Editor.

       Just my 2 cents....

I'm running it on a Mac Pro desktop and was just mocking Snyder
because 5.5 runs fast and smoothly for me.

Hi Cliff,

I have been using Zend IDE for a few years now on OS X on a  
powerbook, and more recently, a Mac Pro and a Macbook Pro. On the Mac  
Pro, the IDE is lightning fast (as one would expect). On the 2ghz  
Intel Core Duo Macbook Pro, the IDE is a delight to work with, and no  
noticeable problems. I have 1gb Ram, and usually have Mail, Firefox,  
iTunes, Transmit (FTP), Adium (MSN Chat) and a few other small  
programs running alongside it. Zend is also saving/opening files over  
an NFS mount on a local network.

Java support on the Apple Mac is a lot better / faster in my  
experience over windows.

Rgds,
Khalid

The 'coherence mode' in the new Parallels desktop alone is worth a  
Macbook Pro.  Zend Studio on the Mac is pretty much all the same (w/  
the exception of Aqua-ized scrollbars).  You may need to update to  
latest JVM when you get it though, I believe Studio requires the latest.

Thanks for everyone's responses, this is just something that
happened
in the last couple weeks. I've seen the stability probs on
Linux, it
feels like a Java app, etc. I can live with all that because it
does
what I need it to do, and I have plenty of memory for it to play
in.

It sounds as if it's local to my workstation. I don't know if
that
changes my approach to the problem, but at least I can rule out
waiting on bugfix release.

Cliff, I'm about 3 weeks ahead of you.  The MacBook Pro is great!  Run it
with Parallels and you can develop in both Windoz and OSX  (nice for browser
output comparison).  OSX comes with PHP 4.x so you'll have to upgrade if you
want 5.x - mysql needs to be installed.  OSX also comes with Apache 1.x.
I'm in the process of installing Zend (appears to work w/out a problem).

Note:  OSX is a gui friendly version of FreeBSD.  The upside is it's Unix,
the downside is there a learning curve if you're not a Unix guy.

In general - jump in, the water is great!

Its your money, but I'd say spring. While I don't have any personal
experience with either of the current models, historically their
consumer models have never been quite worth it.

Go Pro.  It's about the same amount once you get it configured with ram,
hard disk, etc.

I don't feel mocked. I noticed the slowdown at work because I use ZDE
on a MacBook Pro at home. A much better experience, imho, except that
I use a custom key mapping because the default shortcuts are different
between platforms.

I'm told you can boot-up in Windows, parallels let's you run them both (osx
and win) at the same time - which is nice when you're doing gui stuff and
want to see what it looks like on ie, safari, etc.

With the latest Parallels you can actually  use the same partition/ 
windows install for Bootcamp and Parallels. That way you can stay in  
osx most of the time and only reboot into Bootcamp if you need better  
hardware support (games?)


Personally,  I have parallels open all the time (testing soap  
compatibility between .Net and PHP)  and rarely reboot into  
bootcamp.   Visual studio runs great and everything feels snappy in  
windows.

If you are going to use several os x apps (specially ZDE, mail and  
firefox)  at the same times at parallels you really need 2 gigs of ram.

Message-ID: <C12F0900C695FF47AEE0A7C2C75760A0464D51@greenmonster.supercoups.local>

The main differences between the Macbook and Macbook Pro is:
 
Screen size: 13" vs. 15"
 
Video Card: Intel integrated vs. ATI Radeon Mobility
 
Price: $1499 vs. $1999
 
If you don't need the extra 40 GB of HD space or the Black color, you
can save another $200 with the mid-range Macbook.
 
I definitely recommend maxing out the RAM to 2 GB with the Macbook if
you're going to use Parallels. Get the extra RAM via aftermarket - it's
less expensive.
 
I run a Black Macbook though not with Zend, and it's noticeably faster
then even some of the newer Dell Dimension desktops with Core 2 Duo
processors. Sure it maybe a little slower for games or high-end work in
Photoshop with the integrated graphics card, but for programming, you
won't even notice it. Plus when Apple switches platforms in another 3
years again you won't be pissed you spent the extra money on the thing!

Hi Cliff,
 
I have been using Zend IDE for a few years now on OS X on a powerbook,
and more recently, a Mac Pro and a Macbook Pro. On the Mac Pro, the IDE
is lightning fast (as one would expect). On the 2ghz Intel Core Duo
Macbook Pro, the IDE is a delight to work with, and no noticeable
problems. I have 1gb Ram, and usually have Mail, Firefox, iTunes,
Transmit (FTP), Adium (MSN Chat) and a few other small programs running
alongside it. Zend is also saving/opening files over an NFS mount on a
local network.
 
Java support on the Apple Mac is a lot better / faster in my experience
over windows.
 
Rgds,
Khalid

Is anyone using Zend on an Intel-based Macbook? Any problems? Good

I don't mean to rain on everyone's parade.. but I've had my MacBook
Pro since April and it's already been in the shop twice in the last 4
weeks for broken fans. I love the thing and all, but is literally the
first laptop I've owned that I've ever had to send in for service.

Surf YouTube for MacBook pro noises to hear the wails and screams that
some of them make.

Otherwise, I'd say go for it. Zend works great when the fans aren't
eroding the inner casing.

Java 6 (or 1.6 if you're keeping track) was released two days ago...
anyone try it with that yet?  All of my Java apps (servlets on Tomcat)
are already running 20-40% faster.  It'd be nice if the Zend IDE was
the same...

Fewer problems with more recent units, but Apple's quality control is
obviously not what it once was.

I highly recommend smcFanControl to set a minimum threshold fan speed
on your MacBook Pro. Apple _should_ provide a control panel for it,
but they don't. Real shame, too, because the motherboard is apparently
capable of much fine tuning when it comes to power consumption, chip
speed, temperature and the like.

    I avoid session variables -- most applications that use session 
variables are "broken by design".  If you do manage to get sessions to 
work,  the next thing you'll be asking us is how to disable the back button.

    The "stateless" paradigm of web programming is responsible for many 
of it's advantages:  the reasons why we're writing web-based business 
apps instead of other applications.

    It turns out that the behavior of cookies in mainstream web browsers 
are largely undocumented;  it's bad enough if you've got control of the 
cookies that you're sticking on people,  but things get really 
mysterious when some library you don't control is doing it.

    PHP locks the $_SESSION variable when it's in use -- this causes 
lots of problems for apps that have multiple frames,  use AJAX,  etc.

    If you want to write reliable web apps,  keep your "session" state 
in well-engineered database tables,  and use signed cookies to attach a 
session id to users.  You'll spend a less time dealing with mysterious 
behavior on the part of the $_SESSION object.

+1 good tip.

Didn't speed up the ops that got slower recently, but sped everything
else up so I don't really notice any more.

I just downloaded Java SE 6.0 Release 1 Developer Preview 6 from the  
ADC, symlinked it to Current version and have to say that Zend Studio  
is running much faster even on just a PowerBookG4, can only imagine  
what it feels like on Intel.

It has that fast no-lag non-aliased Windows feel.  Im impressed.

Going to try out Eclipse and RadRails as well.  Thanks for the tip!

Really?  That's a surprising assertion, though I'll agree my surprise 
probably comes more from my own lack of insight than a flaw in your 
argument. Of course a quick google shows a few people hold that session 
vars are "evil," but I can't find much to back up the idea.

Can you elaborate, or give us a few links on the topic?

(BTW, Paul, I'm sure you're not speaking without experience, just want 
to clarify my own understanding a little more.)

I've been writing PHP for years now, and this is the first time I've 
been aware of anyone complaining about oddities with $_SESSION (granted, 
I use it for little else than tracking user information). What sort of 
"oddities" have you seen?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Deep Linking with AJAX?
Message-ID: <BBAFB682-4689-4E16-A0AA-D503C0154D14@capellic.com>

I have a designer who would like to have links on the subnav to NOT  
refresh the page.  This could be done with iFrames, but best if done  
with a DIV using AJAX.

However, from a usability perspective, I am concerned that the URL  
displayed on the Location string is not the page they are looking at  
after they have loaded an AJAX page.  If the user does a copy/paste  
into an email to send to somebody, they will not arrive at the  
intended page.

I have looked at Christian Cantrell's article <http:// 
weblogs.macromedia.com/cantrell/archives/2005/06/deep_linking_in.cfm>  
on the topic (though that's over a year old now) and the work-arounds  
were less than convincing.

Does anybody know of a better technique to do this or is the  
consensus that if I want the URL to reflect the actual page I am  
viewing, it should be the old fashion way with page refreshes?

Thanks!

Well then, most of my applications are broke. What other methods do 
you suggest for communication between stateless applications?

I'm not quite sure I get your intent fully, but I think what you're 
going to want to do is include the actual URL in the link, and then do a 
javascript "return false" onclick. Add javascript to observe clicks on 
that link (by element id) and perform the ajax function using that.

I prefer to do this with scriptaculous - it ends up looking something 
like this

<a href="/link/here/" id="clickableLink" onClick="return false;">link</a>

<script type="text/javascript">
Event.observe('clickableLink', 'click', function doStuff { /* do this */ 
}, false);
</script>

Ugh. Why not? Navigation links go to different pages (with presumably
different content), therefore the URL should change. I'm sure you can
manage to use Ajax and other client-side technologies to mimic going to
a different page (changing the URL and such), but this is a perfect
example of misusing Ajax.

Just so it doesn't sound like I'm anti-Ajax, there are situations where
it can be useful. One example is a comment form with a preview. To
display the preview, you could use Ajax to exchange the minimum amount
of information with the server as necessary (to process the comment
using whatever filtering/formatting is already in place on the server)
and display the preview on the current page. The URL would not change,
but from a user's perspective, the page hasn't changed either, so it's OK.

That's my opinion. :-)

Hey Paul, don't get me wrong, because I completely agree about the  
statelessness of the web being critical for RESTfulness and whatnot,  
but seriously, any app that uses $_SESSION is broken?  I'm sure I'm  
not the only one who would beg to differ on that one, especially  
since there are many good JavaScript-based methods for overcoming  
session issues where users are browsing using multiple tabs or Ajax  
apps.

But regardless of all that, please refer to the following: app/config/ 
core.php:
define("CAKE_SESSION_SAVE", "database");

I understand your concerns here, but I don't think Stephen has given  
us enough information here to make a judgement one way or another. It  
really depends on the usability requirements for each specific case.  
I've been amazed how avoiding page reloads can improve user  
experience, and even make the developers life easier, especially when  
designing web apps with complex user interaction and state requirements.

That being said, if it is just a case of a sub-nav for displaying  
nested, non-interactive content, AJAX is probably overkill.

There's a proposal out there for DOM additions that would make this kind 
of thing easier:
http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#pushstate
I would guess it's a long way from being a reality and you'd probably 
still have to have the anchor method (with hacks for Safari) to support 
old browsers...

This is exactly what it is.  And I agree with you, it is overkill.   
However, the designer comes from a Flash background and would like to  
do it - so I said I'd explore it.

Thanks for the replies!

I'm always on the lookout to improve my techniques, perhaps you can help 
here.  When you say "manage to get sessions to work", what exactly do 
you mean?  We wrote two routines for ourselves, SessionSet() and 
SessionGet(), which worked fine when coded and have done so ever since.  
Do I misunderstand you here?

Name two. 

It does force us into a transactional mode of thinking, which is a good 
thing anyway.  So that's one.  I never noticed any more than that.

Hi Chris:

Not that I disagree with you, but I think the direction the web is 
taking is similar to desktop applications, which is refresh when you 
need a new window -- otherwise keep the one you have.

As an experiment, I set up this reader to illustrate my point:

http://xn--ovg.com/ajax_page

This is simply a text reader and there is no real reason to refresh 
each page. While the page is providing unique content each time it is 
"turned" (i.e., navigation), is still just the same window without a 
refresh.

It is worth noting that Flash (and similarly PDFs, video files, 
typically any streaming media) have all suffered from this 
lack of deep linking right from the get go -- 
and all of these 'alternative to XHTML' products have prospered 
and their web penetration is so significant that it is 
these 'hampered' alternative web presentation vehicles that 
are muscling the Internet up to the next level of 
profound usage.

Personally, I have already completely adapted to any web sites 
with powerful "on-demand" page(s)/section(s) that don't bookmark. 

The connection is so fast and the web application interfaces so 
finely tooled and responsive that I barely notice that I need to 
"run the interface again". Indeed all the sites I use that need 
me to "run the interface again" provide me only the most current, 
Critically accurate results and I desire that more than I want 
handy dandy bookmarks.

I feel that this URL issue that AJAX raises is important and 
timely. The inability to deep link an AJAXed page is 
telling the developer something. It is saying that this 
data/content/page is too time-sensitive to bookmark and the 
AJAX usage may need to be rejiggered.

I believe as Chris notes further down in the thread that if 
you are experiencing an AJAX deep linking issue then you 
may not be putting AJAX (or Flash) to the best use.

Use AJAX to update portions of pages with critical dynamic changeable 
content segments that likely should not be bookmarked.

Tell your client that AJAX interfaces when properly used on their 
site project an impression of powerful "on-demand" data return 
and presentation output. And this is more valuable to the power user 
than linking convenience.

I have a designer who would like to have links on the subnav to NOT

with a DIV using AJAX.

However, from a usability perspective, I am concerned that the URL  
displayed on the Location string is not the page they are looking at  
after they have loaded an AJAX page.  If the user does a copy/paste  
into an email to send to somebody, they will not arrive at the  
intended page.

I have looked at Christian Cantrell's article <http://

on the topic (though that's over a year old now) and the work-arounds  
were less than convincing.

Does anybody know of a better technique to do this or is the  
consensus that if I want the URL to reflect the actual page I am  
viewing, it should be the old fashion way with page refreshes?

Just as I was reading this thread on sesion variables I was having a problem with my session variables getting changed on the fly seemingly for no reason. I've isolated this problem and condensed it to the bare minimum for you to see and comment upon:

1. Create a file x.php:

<?php
session_start();
$_SESSION['x'] = "session variables are GOOD";
?>

<html>
<body>
 <a href="y.php">Go to y.php</a>
</body>
</html>

2. Create a file y.php

<?php
session_start();

echo $_SESSION['x']."<br/>";      // outputs session variables are GOOD

$x = "session variables are EVIL"; 

echo $_SESSION['x'];      // outputs session variables are EVIL
?>

Point your browser to x.php and click on the link "Go to y.php" to invoke the y.php file.

File x.php simply sets a session variable $_SESSION['x'].

File y.php assigns an internal variable $x, and that all by itself blows away $_SESSION['x'].

The _GET and _POST variables do not have this problem. 

It's an easy fix simply to use a different name instead of $x, but still... this is not a nice behaviour, if not an outright bug.

I've been writing PHP for years now, and this is the first time I've 
been aware of anyone complaining about oddities with $_SESSION (granted, 
I use it for little else than tracking user information). What sort of 
"oddities" have you seen?

Hi Leo,

That looks like pretty odd behavior.  What version of PHP is it?

This may be relevant, from the PHP manual
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php :

session.bug_compat_42  boolean
     PHP versions 4.2.3 and lower have an undocumented feature/bug that 
allows you to initialize a session variable in the global scope, albeit 
register_globals is disabled. PHP 4.3.0 and later will warn you, if this 
feature is used, and if session.bug_compat_warn is also enabled. This 
feature/bug can be disabled by disabling this directive.

session.bug_compat_warn boolean
     PHP versions 4.2.3 and lower have an undocumented feature/bug that 
allows you to initialize a session variable in the global scope, albeit 
register_globals is disabled. PHP 4.3.0 and later will warn you, if this 
feature is used by enabling both session.bug_compat_42 and 
session.bug_compat_warn.


Looks like the PHP developers agree with you, at least half-admitting 
that it's a bug.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Help with a basic mod_rewrite issue?
Message-ID: <45832326.7040800@secdat.com>

I'm guessing that this must be a common trick, but googling it did not 
come up with an example that I could figure out.

Basically I'd like to put a link to what looks like an MP3 file, but 
which is redirected to a script.  The script determines if the person is 
subscribed to that particular issue. If they are, it does a readfile(), 
otherwise it does not.

I cannot do a simple force of mp3 files to be handled by PHP, or at 
least I don't want to, because then I would need a file for every mp3, 
and as the list comes out of a database, this would be troublesome.

The basic problem I have is, not being familiar with mod_rewrite, I find 
myself in the endless maze that everybody warns you about, fiddling 
around and smashing fists on the table wondering why the simplest 
!)(#(*#@ expression won't work.

What I'm looking for is for a URL like this:

http://www.example.com/path/path/somefile.mp3

to become:

http://www.example.com/path/path/index.php?gp_page=media&file=somefile.mp3

Can anybody give me a clue here?  Thanks.

mod_rewrite seems like a messy business. How about naming your php  
script without a .php extension and just have that be parsed with  
php? Then, whatever path is appending to the script name that is  
requested just acts as a query string/argument.

your php script would be

http://domain.com/mp3handler

and full requests would look like this

http://domain.com/mp3handler/music.mp3

mp3handler would just parse the full request string to find out what  
mp3 was requested

your .htaccess file would be something like this:

<FilesMatch "^mp3hanlder$">
    ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

I've found this to be an effective technique for creating clean urls.

No clues on Friday. The following is completely off the top of my head
and probably won't work, but maybe it will lead you to something that
does?

RewriteRule ^/path/path/(.*mp3)$ /path/path/index.php?blah&file=$1

When debugging rewrite issues, use of RewriteLog and RewriteLogLevel 3
are invaluable.

Oh, now that's the smarter solution!

Careful, next thing you know you'll have an MVC interface... :-)

This looks interesting, can you give me some details here:

1)  The intent is to redirect to music.mp3, which is actually a php 
script, right?
2)  But then the rule is on "mp3handler", which is constant so it can't 
be a parameter?
3)  So what is the parameter?  How do I tell a single script to handle 
multiple files?

What I'm aiming at is to have a single script that takes a parm.  If I 
understand your example above, it requires a separate script for each 
possible mp3 file, which may as well just be this:

<FilesMatch "\.mp3$">
   ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

...which requires me again to have one script per mp3.

Am I missing something?

I think this is exactly what you're looking for.

mp3handler is a php script, just named without a ".php" extension.

if you force apache to treat mp3handler as a php script, you can  
create urls that access mp3handler, but appear to to be accessing a  
more deeply nested file or resource.

a request like http://domain.com/mp3handler/somefile.mp3 will cause  
apache to execute the mp3handler script, and the rest of the request  
is just ignored by apache. Then, inside mp3hanlder you can manually  
parse $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] to retrieve your "argument" which is / 
somefile.mp3.

I started using this technique after seeing it in a great article in  
PHP|Architect. Volume 5, Issue 3 "Frameworks: what's the big deal" by  
Darryl Patterson.

Ken, I think you're missing a fine point in Dell's explanation.  To be
explicit, the reason Dell's solution works is because Apache works it
way down the request path (moving from left to right) until it finds
something it can return.  Apache does not look at the URI and work
it's way "backward".  So, if you have a script||directory||symbolic
link named 'jukebox' accessible at http://mysite.org/jukebox/ then
Apache will serve it up even if the request is for
http://mysite.org/jukebox/clapton/heaven.mp3.  Of course not only will
Apache serve up the 'jukebox' script, but since it's a mod-PHP script,
it is well aware of the full $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] which the script
can use to determine what exactly to do with the request.... like go
get a song from the database.

If all you want is to display multiple pieces of content inside a
single page, you could also do good old-fashioned DHTML.  Single page
loads all content, and various nav/tab/link elements cause the content
to display dynamically without the 'complexity' of AJAX.

Guys,

I saw a script called Andromeda a while back that would allow you to read
the ID3 tag data from an MP3 file.  My question is can the same be done with
JPG files?
I am thinking i would want to read some information that is stored in the
photo such as which camera took the photo, date, etc.

Thanks,

Greg and Dell,

Problem Solved!

Thanks very much for the idea, and also for the detailed explanation.  
Problem is now solved and I know a little more about Apache than I did 
yesterday.

Ok, this is a little off base, but how do you make an image symbol
appear in the url address window in FireFox?
 
I'm guessing it has something to do with this:
 
<LINK rel="shortcut icon" href="blahblahblaimage.ico">

Aha, so then this also provides a way to use the universal dispatch 
method and "friendly" URLs without resorting to mod_rewrite.  I can 
create a script called "pages" and invoke it like so:

<FilesMatch "^pages$">
  ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

...and then generate URLs like so:

http://www.example.com/pages/pagename/parm/value/parm/value

and then just parse out the URI into parm-value pairs.

Nice!

If you like browsing MSDN, you'll find relevant info here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wmpsdk11/mmp_sdk/usingtheplayercontrolinawebpage.asp

Frankly, it might be easier to find an example of an embedded player
somewhere that matches what you want to do, and then use the same
technique.

MS lost a patent dispute last winter, and rather than pay some
ridiculous amount in licensing fees they decided to break the <object>
tag in MSIE. Developers who wish to embed QuickTime or Flash (and
presumably Windows Media) in their pages are forced to use an
externally-loaded Javascript function to do it. Ick.

As for image thumbnails from video, I know how to script this for
QuickTime on a Mac, but that doesn't sound like that will help you.
Ideally, you want some kind of command line tool that provides access
to Media Player's API.

Hi,

    I found this http://www.microimages.com/sml/GetEXIF.htm to be very 
helpful. The structure of the code is almost like PHP and it has the 
biggest collection of exif tag information that I could find...and I 
searched for days. Getting the exif tags out is one thing, but 
interpreting what the sometimes bizzare values mean is a different 
thing. I found the storage of the thumbnail as  a text string quite clever.
    I created an online picture viewer with a database backend so that 
friends and family can search for pictures and create their own list of 
favorites. I also plan to expand this to include Flash Video so that I 
can share my home videos as well. Geroen Wijering made a really nice 
Flash Video player.
    I also used some of the other image functions so that I can specify 
the rotation angle when adding new pictures and have them rotated on the 
fly when viewing pages. That saves tons of time as I can now pipe 
pictures from the camera straight into my viewer system.
    Sure, there are gazillion of those out there already, but it is fun 
and I can learn from it.

          David

It might be an obvious question to some, but according the docs, the 
exif_read_data() function is supposed to be available for php 4 and 
greater. However, I'm using php 4.3.11 and when I use it, I get a 
Fatal Error that exif_read_data() is an undefined function.

Is there a library or something I'm supposed to add to be able to use 
this function?

Suggestions?

>From http://us2.php.net/exif

Requirements
Your PHP must be compiled in with --enable-exif. PHP does not require any
additional library for the exif module. Windows users must also have the
mbstring extension enabled. 

Installation
To enable exif-support configure PHP with --enable-exif 

Windows users must enable both the php_mbstring.dll and php_exif.dll DLL's
in php.ini. The php_mbstring.dll DLL must be loaded before the php_exif.dll
DLL so adjust your php.ini accordingly.

Hi,

    yes, exif is not a standard module in many PHP configurations. I use 
Apachefriend's XAMPP on Windows and it was simply a matter of taking the 
; out in front of the line in the php.ini. Haven't done this on Linux 
yet, but if the module is there it will probably as easy.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Editable Select Box
Message-ID: <45880EBA.2070309@secdat.com>

Hi folks, I'm wondering if anybody has seen a particular kind of control 
I need.

It's called many things, but "editable Select box" seems to be a common 
term.  One example that is close to what I want is here:

http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/form_widget_editable_select/form_widget_editable_select.html

The trouble I'm running into is that none of the example out there seem 
to do quite what I want.  If somebody has seen or used one that does the 
following, any links would be hugely appreciated:

1)  Allows entry of a value not in the box (optionally turn this on or off)
2)  While user is typing, the drop-down list scrolls to the best current 
match
3)  Hitting "enter" or "tab" or whatever with a partial entry picks the 
best current match

Anybody seen this?

ouch, the purist would probably cringe - allows the user to change a
drop down.  on the other hand it is kinda of cool. it sounds like you
are looking for an ajax solution.

Things to google:
ajax drop down type ahead

You can take a look at the Autocomplete section of the Yahoo 
Developer libraries <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/>

One of the examples does mention PHP.

You will want your web app to be able to handle unexpected values 
anyway, right? The web-developer extension on Firefox allows you to 
"Make select fields editable" so you can test your application with 
unruly values.

This looks like the behavior of the Address field in the Web browser itself. I believe I've seen a number of interesting ajax controls in the www.sourceforge.net , one of them might be it.

Hi folks, I'm wondering if anybody has seen a particular kind of control 
I need.

It's called many things, but "editable Select box" seems to be a common 
term.  One example that is close to what I want is here:

http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/form_widget_editable_select/form_widget_editable_select.html

The trouble I'm running into is that none of the example out there seem 
to do quite what I want.  If somebody has seen or used one that does the 
following, any links would be hugely appreciated:

1)  Allows entry of a value not in the box (optionally turn this on or off)
2)  While user is typing, the drop-down list scrolls to the best current 
match
3)  Hitting "enter" or "tab" or whatever with a partial entry picks the 
best current match

Anybody seen this?

not sure how to do it, but is the effect like this?  [left side of screen]
http://www.viralvideochart.com/now

and from digg?  their upcoming stories used to flash by in real time
but that effect seems to be on hold right now.

Was also wondering about it ... i suspect you can take apart the JS,
just diving into it now.  Be curious to know who was the first to come
up with it.  Nice effect.

That is a case-by-case thing.  In our applications a foreign key is 
always presented as a drop-down when it is editable, and a drop-down 
always means a foreign key. 

In 99% of cases foreign keys are normal, meaning only values in the 
parent table are allowed, and we would want the box to only accept 
those.  Sometimes we are more interested in what people type, in which 
case we allow non-existent values and then auto-insert them into the 
parent table when they are inserted into the child table.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Postscript Output Directly From PHP???
Message-ID: <45896E69.5060106@fdcx.net>

Fellow PHP'ers;

Can someone please direct me to a method or technique that would allow 
me to output directly in postscript format?

I am trying to output to a label printer that will accept ps format 
(I've tested it - it does) and I output to a pipe connected to "lp" from 
within my program.

I've been playing with various types of output, including using 
templates, but it seems no matter what I try there is NO output.

Someone somewhere MUST be done this before?????

Suggestions anyone???

Thanks and happy holidays!!!

hmmmmm, that's kinda of clever.

I wonder how much they bring in daily. If it's a lot, seems to me most
folks on this list could cook something up like that.  Get yourself a
dedicated Linux box somewhere,  download a "control panel" thing from
sourceforge, and you are in business.  But are they bringing in like
$5 bucks a day or $500?  who knows?  :-)

Your total over head is pretty low, and can use the marketing
materials from your host provider (rackspace, etc).  I suspect that
clicks on the google ad's in the control panel may be valued much
higher then ones on a home page -- you are targeting system admin
types.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Automatically Print Pages
Message-ID: <8d9a42800612201211o6d767ea2jf9353fff8285c4d1@mail.gmail.com>

Ok Guys & Gals,

I know i have seen talk on this subject before (or similar) but i never had
a use for it until now.

My fulltime employer has their warehouse application written in PHP
controlled with scan guns, etc.
When they pack an order they scan the barcodes and it processes the order.
The script then generates a PDF and currently redirects to the PDF so that
it will
open in the browser.  They can then hit print to print the page.

We would like to streamline this a bit more.  Rather than redirect to the
PDF we would like the PHP script actually send the PDF directly to the
printer.  I know you can
do this as i recall someone doing it with a DYNAMO labeler.

The question is where can i read up on this topic.  We would need to send
this off to the default printer port.

Any insight would be a great help.

Thanks,

Ok so i misunderstood the actual requirement.

THe page would have to print on the client machine as there are many
machines running the scan guns.  I am assuming i would need Javascript for
this task but i am not sure if there are any libraries out there for this
already.

We would want to print the page to the default printer completely bypassing
the print dialog that pops up.

Any assistance will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

This isn't possible with plain vanilla JS.  You'd need to look into ActiveX
controls, even then it might not be possible...

What operating system and web client are you using? I did something like 
this a few months ago. Opened the content in a separate hidden window 
then used javacript "window.Print" then closed the window after it was 
done. It's not completely reliable. If I remember correctly, it worked 
with some versions of IE (circumventing the printer dialog box), but not 
Firefox or Opera browser.

I think what we ended up doing was (and this is on a windows system), 
creating a unique mime type and configuring windows and the browser to 
run a batch file. When that mime type was detected, a  batch file was 
run which copied the downloaded file to lpt1. Essentially dumping the 
contents to the printer. You could probably use the DOS commant line 
"print /d:LPT1: c:\temp\temporary file" to do the same.
This will work if you are dumping something like raw data to a label 
printer.

Other odd situations arose also. On some machines, the default mime type 
stuck after the initial selection and we were not able to change it 
back. It's been a while so I don't remember all the problems, but at 
least you have a general idea in which direction to travel now.

Good luck,
Rolan

THe current situation is this.

We use PHP for the warehouse tools section of the site.  THe tools are
hosted on a server at Rackspace that is also connected via VPN to our local
network.  We are trying to figure out how to do one of 2 things.

1.) have the files print locally on the workstations (Windows XP, IE).  We
actually thought of the batch file but that would cause ALL PDF to be sent
to the batch file and we wouldnt want that.
2.) Have the server at rackspace send the lpr command to push the file to
the shared printer using lpr.

#2 is the way i am thinking of going.  On the form there would be a textbox
that says Printer Name, they would scan a barcode that would inject the
printers shared name.  lpr would send the command to that shared printer.

The question is how do i know if the linux server at rackspace is actually
seeing the shared printers in-house here.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

There is so much pharmacy spam on that domain I can't tell if it is 
owned by people who are "clients" of 1500mb.com or 1500mb.com puts it up 
there. Either way, any web site hosted on 1500mb.com will be 
"associated" with some of the most prolific search engine spam on the 
planet. If that's ok with you, then I suppose it's "free".

I'd look at a mail-based solution (procmail?) for this. That might just 
be me.

yipes, not for me!  I'm not a fan of free.My $20 bucks a month at
dreamhost does it all for me.

Just suggesting a business model, keep a rock solid, clean as a
whistle web host, and have google ads at the "Control Panel" side of
things.  I guess in the long run it could turn into a hassle trying to
make sure all the sites keep themselves on the "up & up".  HOWEVER if
you restrict it to say not-for-profits, etc, maybe the biz-model is a
valid one?

I think I have figured out my problem and it is really really dumb of me.  On my test machine I don't think I have cookies enabled.  On another machine the array I write to the session appears while on my machine it isn't.  I'm using Mcafree and it blocks many cookies.  Does session use cookies?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Retrieving LDAP data on DN of specific record
Message-ID: <a9caffe50612210740r4af9a2a8p588b5a1242fff8bd@mail.gmail.com>

In my LDAP system, I can display all organizations. From that list, I
need to link to a summary page. I have been trying to do this by
passing the DN in the query string, and then using this function to
retrieve the data:

	function viewOrganization($db, $value){
		global $display;
		$rs=ldap_read($db->ds, $db->dn, '(dn='.$value.')');
		if(!$rs){
			$display->errors=true;
			$display->errorM.='<p><strong>ERROR: '.ldap_error($ds).'</strong></p>';
			}
		if(!$display->errors){
			$info = ldap_get_entries($db->ds, $rs);
			print_r($info);
			}
		}

The problem is that if I pass the DN, $info is always empty.

If I modify things so that I pass the value of the custom RECORDID
attribute, then it works fine. So why can't I retrieve on the DN?

LDAP was a plot by grad school English majors, started as a hoax  - to
drive programmers crazy!  For some strange reason, it just took off.
The syntax is insane.

sorry, I don't know the answer to this one! :-)

Yes, it's ridiculous. I can see why someone might want to use it for
an address book, but not for relational data. This is nuts.

Last time I checked, there were two ways to propagate a session id across
page requests: (1) cookies; (2) as a URL variable (URL rewriting). The
latter is less secure.

...less secure because when the session ID is part of the URL, it's
easy for an unsuspecting user to send it to somebody in an email or
bookmark it on a public machine, and have their session hijacked by
someone else. It can also show up in the referrer logs of other hosts
if, for example, external images or scripts are included in your
pages.

There is also the risk that PHP can be tricked into using a non-random
session ID, see Chris Shiflett's writeup on Session Fixation if you
are considering using URL rewriting for session-keeping:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT: Text to Postscript conversion help (ONE-TIME)???
Message-ID: <458BEA82.9080204@fdcx.net>

Gentlemen;

I know none of you have anything else to do today (!!!) but I was hoping 
one kind soul would be willing to create a postscript file for the 
following label:

Name: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    Help-Line: (xxx) xxx-xxxx
Acct#  On/Off Code     Area(s)
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
For Service Call (xxx)xxx-xxxx

I have been trying to create a ps output from my PHP program WITHOUT 
success and I've even tried some of the recommended suggestions of 
installing pear and pecl for the PSadmin modules... without luck!

With the postscript output of the above, I should be able to use it as a 
template and substitute my own data in the appropriate areas.

And no, I do not really understand all the postscript commands and 
idiosyncrasies.

Thanks to anyone who can quickly accomplish this?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] windows 2003 server, php.ini, exchange server & mail ?
Message-ID: <236297.23407.qm@web32808.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I have a dedicated server(win 2003.  I have full admin
control.  This server hosts multiple domains. The
email is served by an exchange server. The sites are
served by iis 6. I am currently using php 4. My
question has to do with mail functions. In the php.ini
file there is a section to specify the mail
information:

{from php.ini}

Mail Functions
SMTP mail.someserver.com
smtp_port "25"
sendmail_from somebody at somewhere.com
sendmail_path ; not used on windows

{end php.ini}

The problem is, how can I get the php mail functions
to use the smtp from each domain where a message board
or other software wishes to send mail? Right now no
matter which domain sends mail it comes from the
domain named in the php.ini file. Windows (IIS) only
lets me use one php.ini file for the server (as far as
I know) If I was using apache I could use multiple
php.ini files for each domain and set the mail
function information to each respective server.
Unfortunately, due to the business arrangement I have,
I have to use IIS. I have searched all over the
internet and have come up dry. Is this even possible
with my current configuration?  Any advice or help is appreciated.

Thanks
Chris

Maybe you need to change business arrangements....sorry, but IIS is in 
my opinion not a web server, but a plain piece of garbage for reasons 
like the one you mentioned. Anyhow, as far as I know, you can override 
settings in the php.ini on the fly through script. The problem would be 
to make the script adapt to each domain.  The command for overriding the 
php.ini setting should be ini_set, see 
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php.

    Hope this helps,

          David

I'm guessing each site has it's own include_dir?
phpmailer class lets you specify a host name. I use this because I was unable
to get a Free mail server on my testbed.

Some printers can take input via SMTP and FTP -- I know the network laser
printers we have can -- and since FTP functions are so easy to use from PHP
applications, that may be an easy and reliable method to look into.

I'd look at a mail-based solution (procmail?) for this. That might just be
me.

Message-ID: <482368.82567.qm@web30813.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear nyphp:
I am very new to php programming and need some assistance relating to displaying to dates using php.
I wrote a script that involves menu pull-downs for dates that should appear into a form as the end result.
I have the form into a table and all of the other td's appear, except the dates.  I get a 0000/00/000 for the date fields.
I did a goggle for displaying dates in php, but the results are showing me what i have already done.
Could some one please direct me or give a sample code on how I can get the dates to appear in the proper context (not 0000/00/00).  Thank you in advance

Hi ,
                  This information  will surely help you out !!
   
   
          date( )  
  
---------------------------------
              

    string date ( string date_format [, int timestamp] )
  
 
  Users like to have their dates in a variety of formats, so PHP lets you convert timestamps into different types of strings using the date( ) function.
  You can send two parameters to date( ), with the second one being optional, as with strtotime( ). Parameter one is a special string containing formatting codes for how you want the timestamp converted, and parameter two is the timestamp you want to convert. If you do not supply the second parameter, PHP assumes you want to convert the current time.
  Parameter one is tricky: it is a string of letters from a predefined list of 31 possibles. You can use other characters in the string, and these are copied directly into the formatted date. If you are trying to put words into the date format that you do not want to be converted into their date equivalent, you need to escape them with a backslash, \. To make things even more confusing, if your escaped letter is an existing escape sequence, then you need to escape it again!
  The complete list of date format characters is shown in table. Be careful, as they are case-sensitive!

  This first example of date( ) is very basic and prints out the current time in 24-hour clock format:

    print date("H:i");
  
 
  It's possible to mix the output of date( ) with a text string to get a natural-looking statement, like this:

    print "The day yesterday was " . date("l", time( ) - 86400);
  
 
  Note that on very specific occasions (particularly when daylight savings time kicks in), the above script will be incorrect. If you need absolute precision, either check for DST or subtract a whole day using mktime( ).
  This next example outputs the date in the format of 31st of August 2005. Notice that we have the word of in the date format, and it has been passed through to the output instead of being converted. The reason for this is that lowercase O and lowercase F do not have any formatting purpose in the date function (although this may be changed in the future), so they are just copied straight into output:

    print date("jS of F Y");
  
 
  In the next example, our date( ) function is embedded between two other strings, which makes for particularly neat output:

    print "My birthday is on a " . date("l", strtotime("22 Dec 2004")) . " this      year.";

          date( )  

  
---------------------------------
            
  


    string date ( string date_format [, int timestamp] )
  
 
  Users like to have their dates in a variety of formats, so PHP lets you convert timestamps into different types of strings using the date( ) function.
  You can send two parameters to date( ), with the second one being optional, as with strtotime( ). Parameter one is a special string containing formatting codes for how you want the timestamp converted, and parameter two is the timestamp you want to convert. If you do not supply the second parameter, PHP assumes you want to convert the current time.
  Parameter one is tricky: it is a string of letters from a predefined list of 31 possibles. You can use other characters in the string, and these are copied directly into the formatted date. If you are trying to put words into the date format that you do not want to be converted into their date equivalent, you need to escape them with a backslash, \. To make things even more confusing, if your escaped letter is an existing escape sequence, then you need to escape it again!
  The complete list of date format characters is shown in table. Be careful, as they are case-sensitive!

  This first example of date( ) is very basic and prints out the current time in 24-hour clock format:

    print date("H:i");
  
 
  It's possible to mix the output of date( ) with a text string to get a natural-looking statement, like this:

    print "The day yesterday was " . date("l", time( ) - 86400);
  
 
  Note that on very specific occasions (particularly when daylight savings time kicks in), the above script will be incorrect. If you need absolute precision, either check for DST or subtract a whole day using mktime( ).
  This next example outputs the date in the format of 31st of August 2005. Notice that we have the word of in the date format, and it has been passed through to the output instead of being converted. The reason for this is that lowercase O and lowercase F do not have any formatting purpose in the date function (although this may be changed in the future), so they are just copied straight into output:

    print date("jS of F Y");
  
 
  In the next example, our date( ) function is embedded between two other strings, which makes for particularly neat output:

    print "My birthday is on a " . date("l", strtotime("22 Dec 2004")) . " this      year.";

I wrote a script that involves menu pull-downs for dates that should appear into a form as the end result.
I have the form into a table and all of the other td's appear, except the dates.  I get a 0000/00/000 for the date fields.
I did a goggle for displaying dates in php, but the results are showing me what i have already done.
Could some one please direct me or give a sample code on how I can get the dates to appear in the proper context (not 0000/00/00).  Thank you in advance

Your code displays fine for me. You can grab the data after the form has been submitted as POST data.

After the form is submitted, the selected values will be stored like:

$month = $_POST['month'];
$year = $_POST['year'];
echo $month . "<br>" . $year;

etc, etc

Don't forget to add in your opening <form> tag, as it looks like it's missing.

Hi, 
   
         The reply you got from jface at mercenarylabs.com is absolutely perfect.
  The only thing  you should remember is that in your PHP code, you should include the following lines ---
   
  $month = $_POST['month'];
$year = $_POST['year'];
   
  etc .......   at the beginning of the code.
   
   
  Here 'month' and 'year' are the values of name attributes  you gave to your HTML form fields.----

  Your code displays fine for me. You can grab the data after the form has been submitted as POST data.

After the form is submitted, the selected values will be stored like:

$month = $_POST['month'];
$year = $_POST['year'];
echo $month . "
" . $year;

etc, etc

Don't forget to add in your opening   tag, as it looks like it's missing.

Hello, I am trying to research an issue about PHP_SELF and was wondering 
if anyone knew the currently status of this exploit. I read a 
description of the exploit that was a couple of years old but can not 
find any "current" status of the bug, even on the php.net bug tracking. 
The report I read concluded with a note at the bottom of the text that 
said something like the good news is that the fix is in CVS but he never 
said what the resolution was. I have checked many security sources and 
have not been able to find any more information about it.

The author of the document that explained the exploit had a "working" 
example of how the exploit worked but when I tried to reproduce it, 
nothing! I had to assume that bug has been fixed and write that in my 
own article about the exploit but I stuck to find any current status on 
it. Any one know about this bug?

thanks in advance, mikesz

The post I found was a blog entry from May 2005 ...

It's not a bug. It's a vulnerability that you can create in your own
applications if you blindly trust $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'].

Don't do that.

Chris,

do you suggest hardcoding the filenames even when referencing the same file
that is executing?

There was a long thread about this in July 2005.

Executive summary: PHP_SELF intentionally includes extra URL garbage (or 
valuable URL variables, take your pick) tacked on by the user.  Don't use 
it without knowing what it does.

Here's what you get when you hit the URL:

http://example.com/info.php/testing1?testing2 :

_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]	 /info.php/testing1?testing2
_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]	 /info.php/testing1
_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]	 /info.php

Get it?  If you don't want that extra stuff tacked on by the user, use the 
correct _SERVER variable.  If you use REQUEST_URI or PHP_SELF, be aware the 
user can affect the contents of that variable.  99% of the time, you want 
SCRIPT_NAME, not PHP_SELF.

By the way, here's another test:

http://example.com/info.php/testing<script>?testing :

_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]	 /info.php/testing%3Cscript%3E?testing
_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]	 /info.php/testing<script>
_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]	 /info.php

Note that the REQUEST_URI variable, which comes from Apache, is encoded, 
while the PHP_SELF variable, which comes from PHP, is not.  So PHP 5.2.0 
still makes it possible to shoot yourself in the foot, and as I've pointed 
out below, well-known PHP authorities actually recommend that you do so.

Here's the email that I sent at in July 2005:

Yes.  I'm afraid I don't understand this entire thread.  Apparently
because of the numerous PHP developer articles recommending it, and
because of the php.net page which for whatever reason lists it first on
the list of predefined variables, people are using PHP_SELF when they
really want SCRIPT_NAME.  SCRIPT_NAME solves all the problems mentioned
in this thread - it's just the script name, without any extra garbage
that might be tacked on by the user.  PHP_SELF explicitly includes that
extra garbage, so solutions in this thread that involve stripping the
garbage off of PHP_SELF to make it safe are really, really missing the
point - just use SCRIPT_NAME instead.  Please don't use FORM ACTION="";
according to the spec, what the browser does with that is undefined, so
even if it works in current browsers, it might not work in future ones.

People can be forgiven for making this mistake -- I'm here holding my
copy of _Learning PHP 5_, and it recommends on page 8 and again on page
86 the use of PHP_SELF for self-referencing forms, ahem -- but it's time
to put it to bed: PHP_SELF is unsafe for any usage where it is echoed
back to the page.

    I'll try to reply to this and some other people who replied to my 
previous message.

    I'll start with my background.  I've often been the person who the 
buck stops with -- somebody else develops an application that almost 
works (perhaps even puts it in production) and then I have to clean up 
the mess.  The app might be written in PHP,  Java,  Cold Fusion,  Perl,  
you name it.  I've learned to see session variables as a "bad smell".

    When I develop my own applications,  I use cookies for 
personalization and caching.  I use the authentication system described in

http://cookies.lcs.mit.edu/pubs/webauth:sec10-slides.ps.gz

    this mechanism can carry a "session id",  which in turn can be used 
a key against application state stored in a relational database.  I 
think through the boundary cases,  and find that my greenfield apps 
behave predictably -- my only woe is that you'll discover that browsers 
have a lot of undocumented behavior connected with cookies,  form 
handling,  and caching.  All problems that you still need to fight with 
if you use sessions,  see the comments for

http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-cache-limiter.php

    The context of this is that the average web application is poor in 
the areas of usability and security:  recent studies show that 80% of 
web applications have serious security problems

http://www.whitehatsec.com/home/resources/presentations/files/wh_security_stats_webinar.pdf

    Jacob Nielsen's website has been chronicling the sorry state of web 
application usability:

http://www.useit.com/

    Perhaps the top 20% of programmers can write applications with 
$_SESSION that don't have serious security and usability problems,  but 
what about the other 80%?

----

(1)  Session variables are treacherous.  Odd things can happen in 
boundary cases,  such as when sessions expire,  or when you are targeted 
by session fixation attacks.

http://shiflett.org/articles/security-corner-feb2004

    I've looked at many apps that use sessions that seem to be 
working...  Until you walk away for two hours,  come back,  and discover 
that you're logged in as somebody else.  I suppose I could have spent 
hours or days tracking down an intermittent problem,  which involved 
some confluence of browser oddness (IE was fine,  Firefox was screwy),  
the behavior of the session system,  and crooked logic in the 
application.  Or I could use cryptographically signed cookies to 
implement an authentication system which won't give me surprises in the 
future.

Anybody can write applications that work 95% of the time with 
$_SESSION.  Getting the other 5% right requires a deep understanding of 
state and statelessness on the web...  Which is what (many) people are 
trying to avoid when they use $_SESSION variables.

    There are more than twenty configuration variables that affect the 
way sessions work under PHP.  Incorrect configuration of any of these 
can cause applications to fail,  often in intermittent ways.  The use of 
a custom session handler can have unpredictable effects on security,  
reliability and performance.

    Other languages are a lot worse than PHP -- the use of the "scope" 
concept in languages such as Cold Fusion and Tango makes it easy to use 
a session variable without realizing it...  Resulting in an application 
that "works" sometimes,  but fails in mysterious ways.

(2) Session variables are bound to a particular language.  In the real 
world,  I work with legacy systems that might be written in other 
languages.  I might have some old pages in Cold Fusion that work just 
fine,  and I won't rework them in PHP until I've got a good reason.  If 
users can set a customization parameter,  such as the background of a 
page,  it's easy to write a cookie that all languages can read.  
Applications stuck in the session variable roach motel aren't as 
maintainable and portable.

(3) PHPSESSID.  Do I need to say more?  I consider the client that wants 
user tracking and can't accept cookies,  so all the pages on their
site look like

http://www.example.com/about_us.php?PHPSESSID=**pseudo-random blob**

    Three months later they come back and wonder why their site isn't 
being indexed in Google.  Yes,  there's a saner way to use this 
feature,  but this "cure" to privacy violation is worse than the cookie 
"disease",  since session ids will leak out through referrers,  
bookmarks,  links that people cut-and-pate...

(4) The back button.  When somebody asks a question about sessions on a 
forum,  they'll usually ask another question a few days or weeks later:  
"How do I disable the back button?"

    The underlying problem is a deep aspect of the structure of the 
web.  There is certain state information that's particular to a request 
(GET and POST variables) and certain state information that has a more 
persistent scope (cookies,  session information,  a relational 
database.)  The back button makes it possible for these two things to 
get out of sync.

    Ultimately,  we need a systematic strategy to deal with this.  One 
pattern is to put the complete state of the application in form 
variables.  Applications that use this pattern always work perfectly 
with the back button.  This pattern doesn't work always (hitting the 
back button shouldn't cancel your order on an e-commerce site),  but it 
works often...  For instance,  you can use hidden variables to hold onto 
form variables for complicated forms that spread over several pages,

(5) Multiple windows.  I think it's a human right to be able to have 
more than one window open on a web site.  If I'm shopping,  for 
instance, I'd like to be able to look at two products simultaneously.  
An application that keeps state in form variables doesn't care how many 
you have open.  If you're looking for jobs at an organization that uses 
taleo.net's software,  you'll find that it uses trickery to prevent you 
from having more than one window open...  So you can't look at two jobs 
at once,  or look at the job description while you're filling out the 
application.  I suspect that they did this because they don't want to 
spend forever debugging "race conditions" that could be caused by a user 
acting in two windows simultaneously.

    Session variables introduce problems of locking.  PHP gets an 
exclusive lock on the session for each page displayed.  This hurts the 
performance of pages that use dynamically generated images and 
Javascript,  and can mysteriously deadlock AJAX applications.

(6) Scalability,  Reliability,  and all that.  This is a tricky one,  
because it depends on particulars.  Sessions can be lightning-fast in 
systems that keep them in RAM,  such as Java and Cold Fusion.  The 
default session handler in PHP uses files,  and is probably faster than 
a relational database in a direct comparison:  however,  the session 
handler will load all of the data into RAM,  whereas a relational 
implementation may only need to load information when it's needed.  
Keeping information in POST variables or cookies also involves a 
tradeoff -- this is as scalable as it gets so far as server resources,  
but requires that the state be passed back and forth between the browser 
and server.  This is no big deal if the state is 500 bytes.  It's 
unacceptable if the state is 500 megabytes.  In most cases,  it starts 
looking expensive when we're passing an extra 10k-100k around.

I've recently been working on a legacy app that contains a query (select 
a subset of items) and reporting (display user-selected fields of those 
items) function.  The interface between those modules is simple:  the 
query system passes a comma-separated list of item identifiers to the 
reporting system.  I like this,  because it meant that one system could 
be changed without affecting the other.  I had to update the app so it 
would work with a changed database schema,  so both sides needed some work.

I discovered that the app was passing the item list as a session 
variable.  This worked:  unless I was using the application in two 
windows at a time.  In that case,  a query in one window would change 
the report delivered in another window.  I thought about it,  and 
realized that in this case,  result sets would always be under about 
10k,  and usually be around 1k.  Therefore,  it made sense to pass this 
as a hidden variable in the form and ditch the session variable.

This shows the kind of problems that regularly turn up in the 
applications that developers "throw over the wall" to testers and 
clients.  Choose a session variable,  and your application behaves 
mysteriously for a user who didn't respect the "one window at a time" 
assumption you made.  Passing hidden variables in forms,  on the other 
hand,  might work OK when you're testing with a small data set over a 
LAN,  but could rapidly become a performance nightmare for dialup users 
using a production database.

Performance can be improved in a number of ways:  for instance,  by 
delta-sigma compressing the item list,  or creating a "form scope" 
variable that's keyed against a unique identifier in the form.  Either 
way,  quality web applications take quality thought.

(7) Lack of engineered application state:  Engineered Application State 
is the gem of database-backed web applications.

If you keep the state of your application in a relational database,  you 
need to ~design~ the state of your application.  You need to ~think~ 
every time you add or change a table in your relational database.  You 
can add a new variable to your application as easily as typing '$'.

Desktop apps keep the application state in a tangle of pointers.  C and 
C++ applications tend to contain 5 or more defects per thousand lines of 
code.  Errors show up in data structures over time,  just as mutations 
occur in your cells.  Memory leaks,  application hangs,  and crashes are 
cancers caused by these mutations.

PHP apps die at the end of each request,  and are reborn for the next 
request.  They don't accumulate errors over time.  Web application 
environments such as Java and Cold Fusion that involve a long-running 
process regularly hang or crash and require restarts.  When is the last 
time you've had to restart PHP?

A database protects you from errors in multiple ways.  Transactions,  
for instance,  protect against data corruption caused by crashing 
scripts.  It's easy to write

$_SESSION["logged_in"]=true;

in one place and

$_SESSION["logged-in"]=false;

in another,  introducing unpredictable behavior and security holes.  A 
relational database will give you an error if you try something like that.

-------------

Can users of $_SESSION avoid the seven deadly sins?

Yes.

In practice they don't.

Paul:

Ditto here as well.

It's one thing to point out the sins, but it's another to provide the 
way to redemption.

Your link to Chris' work (always excellent, btw) was helpful

http://shiflett.org/articles/security-corner-feb2004

but, I feel like the other shoe hasn't dropped.

Thanks for your post.

Hi Joseph,

That's what I do, yes, but regardless, blind trust isn't a good idea
regarding any data that can be influenced by or provided by a third party.

If you anticipate needing to change names/URLs/whatever in the future,
you can restrict $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] to a particular naming convention
or a finite set of valid values.

(I suffer from URL vanity, so I rarely encounter this problem. Others
might have better suggestions.)

Hi guys,

I'm a unix guy and I use a lot of fancy unix tools which have only a command
line interface. I would like to write a PHP-front-end to many of them so as
to allow users to access them.  I know some perl and shell scripting, but no
other programming language. I was hoping someone on this list could suggest
me a book on website that would help me get started with PHP. I want to
learn the basics. Hope to pick up more as time goes.

Thanks,
Sukrit.D.

    I'm not aware of one,  but I wish there was.  I think the question 
isn't so much "session management" but about how to manage state in a 
stateless protocol -- sessions are one abstraction for doing that,  but 
other abstractions exist too.

    I think the best approach here is the "Pattern Vocabulary" 
approach.  There are certain practices,  that when applied to an 
application,  have certain results.

    For instance,  there's the pattern of "Stateless Server" -- the 
complete state of the application (or subsystem thereof) is kept in 
hidden POST and GET variables.  You accept some limits,  but get some 
real benefits:  infinite scalability,  no headaches with the back 
button,  no need for cookies...

    You might try the above and then notice that you're passing 100K 
around in your hidden form variables...  People are complaining that 
your app is slow.  Now you can generate a unique id each time you draw a 
form ("Generated Form Scope",  for lack of a better term.)  You can 
stuff your "hidden" variables into the database under this key,  and 
restore them when the key comes back...  If your code is organized right 
(does something like $vars=$_POST,  and only looks at $vars 
afterwards),  you can do this transparently to the rest of your app.

    The same kind of thinking can protect you against certain kinds of 
back button woes -- you can at least stop people from submitting the 
same form more than once,  by checking to see if a form with that unique 
id has been submitted before.

    "Shopping Cart" is another pattern.  People often use session 
variables to handle shopping carts,  but that's really not ideal from a 
user interface perspective...  Ideally,  each instance of a shopping 
cart has it's own unique id...  Imagine we want to make an e-commerce 
site that behaves like amazon.com:

(1) User visits e-commerce site from a home computer -- a long-term 
tracking cookie gets stuck on their browser
(2) User adds item A to their shopping cart...  A new shopping cart is 
created with id #101,  associated with the tracking cookie. 
(3) User adds items B,C,D, and E to their shopping cart in the course of 
30 minutes of browsing.  Each time an item is added,  we add a row to a 
table in the database that links the item id to the shopping cart id.
(4) 4-year old hits reset button
(5) User comes back to e-commerce site... He's happy to find his cart is 
still there.  User creates account #202 to check out.  Shopping cart 
#101 is associated with account #202
(6) User checks out shopping cart.
(7) User comes back a week later,  wants to buy a few more items.  The 
site recognizes who he is.  He adds two of item A and an item F to a 
newly created shopping cart with id #102,  associated with user account 
#202.
(8) User goes to work, logs in...  The system sees that he has shopping 
cart #102 open.  He adds item G,  and then checks out.
(9) User learns that he can trust this site to work correctly and 
becomes a loyal customer.

    It's nice that we've got a historical record of the shopping cart 
after the fact,  but there's a more important point -- we could have 
lost the customer's dollar at many points in the above transaction if we 
were using a $_SESSION based cart.   The session wouldn't have survived 
step 4,  for instance.  A good user interface isn't academic here...  It 
puts money in our pocket.

    The above scenario is complex,  and it might not be fair to expect 
that a first-generation shopping cart has those features.  A 
$_SESSION-based shopping cart would need to be completely reworked to 
add the features  above.  A cart that uses a unique "cart id" and 
relational back end,  will be a lot more maintainable...  You could even 
start out using $_SESSION to keep track of the "cart id",  then keep it 
in a cookie,  then associate it with a user name,  add the facility to 
promote an anonymous cart to an authenticated cart and so on.  Starting 
with a good design,  we can provide the interface that we ~want~ to 
provide,  not that one that our abstract layer ~forces~ us to provide.

In regards to slides 29 and 30, can you elaborate and give a more detailed
example what they are trying to say?  Are they saying that the session key
should contain a hash of the data? Or does the hash become the "salt" in
crypting the data? Finally, how does doing that make it easier to prevent
circumvention and forgeability.

Thank you.

Paul, the problems with _SESSION variables, and creative ways of dealing with them, 
sound worthy of investigion, and if there are no books on the subject - perhaps you'd consider writing one?

Actually, I have recently come across a 'fly in the ointment' for this
approach.  If you're running php as a cgi, $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] will
contain the full _filesystem_ path, which is not what we're after.

I'm not 100% sure what the solution to this problem is.  Right now the
only thing I can think of is to try and figure out the common part of
PHP_SELF and SCRIPT_NAME, so as to drop both the extra filesystem info
and any url garbage, but that seems pretty fragile to me.

If anyone has a good solution or even any suggestions I'd love to hear them.

I always use the __FILE__ constant.  Can't be touched by user input.  The 
basename() and dirname() are handy to use along with it.

Yes, If you want the full filename (including filesystem path) __FILE__
is indispensable, and basename(__FILE__) is the best way to get the name
of the currently running script.

The problem comes when you're attempting to construct the correct
absolute URL for a given file.  When running php as a cgi there doesn't
seem to be a method of achieving this securely, as in this setup
$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] will contain the php interpreter, like '/php-cgi'.

Bottom line is that if your script will be run under php-cgi you must

There's a solution for that (two solutions in fact, either a php.ini setting 
or a different variable):

http://www.symfony-project.com/trac/ticket/842

So I suppose the canonical solution would be something like:

$thispage = (isset($_SERVER['ORIG_SCRIPT_NAME'])) ? 
$_SERVER['ORIG_SCRIPT_NAME'] : $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'];

How's that?  That should work anywhere, right?

(Disclaimer: I never use PHP as a cgi script and can't test this.)

What about using $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] like this?

$absoluteUrl = str_replace($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], '', __FILE__);

You should probably use preg_replace() to make sure it only strips  
off the beginning of the string, but you get the idea. I don't know  
how reliable DOCUMENT_ROOT is, but you could get around that by  
explicitly providing the document root for your site as a  
configurable constant.

define('MYSITE_DOC_ROOT', '/path/to/site/root');

$absoluteUrl = preg_replace('#^'.MYSITE_DOC_ROOT.'#', '', __FILE__);

Hmm, I wasn't aware of the .ini fix, that's good to know.  After
changing it to cgi.fix_pathinfo=1 (default is 0), SCRIPT_NAME functions
as expected.  I'm not that thrilled with requiring a non-standard
php.ini setting but it will work for the moment.

To add insult to injury, ORIG_SCRIPT_NAME is only being populated when
this is set to 1, at which point you don't need it for what we're trying
to do!

I have not really followed this discussion, but when i see something like this:
"$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] will contain the full _filesystem_ path,
which is not what we're after."

Can you just do a 1 line regex and pull out what you need? And you are all set.

Sure thing ed, care to take a stab at it?  Don't forget that the
filesystem path may actually bear no relation at all to the web path

i think there's some automatic online regex expression things that
figure it out for you or, u may want to post to one of the perl
groups, they LOVE this kinda of stuff. My brain is pretty much the
size of a pea this days, functioning at 1%!  :-)

This looks like a cool application to figure the regex stuff out.

>   
    Let's take it a step at a time...  Imagine we've got a token of the 
following format...

$token="$user_id:$session_id"

    The session_id doesn't have to be unpredictable -- it could could 
from an auto_increment column in a database table...  With the caveat 
that people could estimate the usage of your site by looking at the 
session id's.

    You could put this in a cookie,  and it would work quite well,  as 
long as you didn't have users who knew how to look at or change the 
cookies.  An attacker who understands cookies can easily change the user 
id,  or session_id.

    To protect the cookies from tampering,  we could do something like

$hash=sha1($token);
$signed_token="$hash:$token";

    We could check the integrity of the token by recomputing the hash 
and see if it matches the one in the signed token.  This protects 
against accidental damage,  or very simple attacks.  Still,  it's quite 
possible that an attacker could guess what you're doing:  it wouldn't be 
safe at all in an open source system.

    That's where the salt comes in...  For a particular web site,  we 
create a random "salt" that,  effectively,  gives us a unique hash 
function for our web site.

$salt="... a random salt defined in a per-site configuration file ...";
function private_hash($token) {
    global $salt;
    return sha1("$salt:$token");
}
$private_hash=sha1("$salt:$token");
$signed_token="$private_hash:$token";

    Now,  nobody can alter your tokens unless they know your salt.

    Because the tokens are cryptographically signed,  the token itself 
is a proof that somebody has logged in -- you don't need to look at the 
database or keep ~any~ server side state.  This makes it a highly 
scalable system...  This basic approach is used on some of the biggest 
sites in the world,  such as yahoo.com.

    Except for one little detail:  replay attacks.

    Nothing stops a person from saving his token and presenting later -- 
after his account may have been deactivated,  or after associated 
session information has been purged (an error condition.)  An attacker 
that gets the person's cookie jar,  or who intercepts network traffic,  
can also steal the token.

    It's not possible to completely protect against sophisticated 
attacks where a hostile party controls your network without installing 
complex software on both ends,  and solving some intrinsically difficult 
problems having to do with mutual authentication.  Let's just say that 
the developers of SSL have solved these problems,  and that you should 
use SSL for applications with the strongest security needs.

    We can,  however,  make replay attacks a lot harder by adding a 
timestamp...  Now the token looks like

$timestamp:$user_id:$session_id

    Now we're keeping a table on the server that looks like

create table session (
    session id      ... session id ... primary key
    user_id          ... user id ...,
    last_updated  ... timestamp ...,
    begin_time    ... timestamp ...,
    end_time       ... timestamp ...
);

    Now we've got two constants:

REFRESH_TIME: how old a timestamp is before we issue a token with a new 
timestamp and write the timestamp to the last_updated column.
EXPIRE_TIME: how old a timestamp is before we eliminate the session.

    You might think you could put the client ip address in the token,  
and lock the session to an ip address to make it harder to steal 
tokens.  I tried this,  but found out that some of the largest ISPs 
(such as aol) have a proxy server that makes users seem to "jump 
around".  You can do it if you know people are logging from a sane ISP,  
but you can't do it in general.

    ---

    This system can be improved in numerous ways,  such as adding 
anonymous sessions,  operating in a split http/https mode,  and caching 
authorization system in the token.

    If you're worried about information leakage (you don't want someone 
to know that he got session 88427 yesterday and 99105 today),  you can 
encrypt the token.  But be careful...  It's easy to use cryptography the 
wrong way:  don't rely on encryption to protect token integrity against 
tampering -- most of the obvious schemes don't really work.

Hey Dan,

thanks for the tip. I have an app I work on that has about a hundred of 
these:

<form action="<? echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>" method=post>

so using your technique it would change to :

<form action="<? echo basename(__FILE__); ?>" method=post>

is this what you mean?

I wholeheartedly agree that in this and most other form applications, 
you don't need to expose this variable to user input and would (and 
will) happily replace all of them in my application for better security.

Thanks in advanced, mikesz
