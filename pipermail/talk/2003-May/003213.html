<PRE>Jeff,

I'm not totally uncaring about your client, just pointing out that we live
in a changing world, and as a business owner myself I understand if I am not
able to change with the times, I don't deserve to be in business.  What your
client is doing may have been acceptable when spam was at the level of junk
mail where every now and then I receive an e-mail about legitimate business
that is sensitive enough to recognize that there are moral limits as to the
content of the e-mail because there may be minors viewing the e-mail.  But
if we make exceptions as to what e-mails are acceptable spam then the
spammers will figure out how to justify that their crap meets the
exceptions.

Your client needs to spend time investigating the other options available to
him rather than bewail the fact that the spammers have ruined for him a good
means of rapping out some business.  He needs to look at the job services
like dice where he can register as a head hunter and receive information
about people looking for jobs that are soliciting his type of e-mails.  He
needs to look at getting his own site advertised well enough that job
applicants would come to his site and enroll for his e-mails.  To act as if
the world is over because a means of marketing is going away is like crying
the sky is falling!

Jim

&gt;<i> Jim,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's my kids that I worry most about...at least where spam is
</I>&gt;<i> concerned...so we are definitely in agreement there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One part of me agrees that spam is spam no matter what level of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;honesty&quot; may be behind it (in the case of my client). The other part of
</I>&gt;<i> me is concerned about my client.

</I>&gt;<i> As cold and uncaring as it sounds, if stopping someone from sending
</I>&gt;<i> unsolicited e-mail is going to kill their business than they need to
</I>&gt;<i> find another way to do their business, or lose their business.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Spam is unsolicited e-mail.  It doesn't matter weather you think you
</I>&gt;<i> have a legitimate reason to send Spam, it's still spam.  I'm against
</I>&gt;<i> Spam, unsolicited sales calls on the phone, unsolicited faxes, junk mail
</I>&gt;<i> and all such things.  We get commercials on TV which I have never
</I>&gt;<i> minded, because it's how TV gets it's money while I get TV for free.
</I>&gt;<i> There are adverts in newspapers and magazines because this either pays
</I>&gt;<i> for the rag, or helps to keep the subscription price down to a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable price.  Mail is not free, the price of mail continues to go
</I>&gt;<i> up as the post office is struggling under the increased load of mail
</I>&gt;<i> where mail routes need to be made shorter and more delivery people
</I>&gt;<i> added.  Fax is not free, I have to pay for the paper and ink and if its
</I>&gt;<i> a business line I have to pay for the message units used to receive the
</I>&gt;<i> fax.  E-mail is not free, I have to pay a provider for it, or buy the
</I>&gt;<i> equipment and pay a provider to hook up to the net.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's even worse about spam is how it's in your face.  I have kids who
</I>&gt;<i> are receiving spam for all kinds of perverse crap.  I don't get perverse
</I>&gt;<i> crap in the mail ( and even if i did, it would be in an envelop where I
</I>&gt;<i> can choose to throw it out before I even see the perversity ), I don't
</I>&gt;<i> get calls from phone sex people trying to get my business, but yet I get
</I>&gt;<i> totally offensive garbage in my e-mail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no sympathy for anyone who uses unsolicited means to sell their
</I>&gt;<i> product or service.  There are enough places to advertise right now in
</I>&gt;<i> TV, Radio, Newspapers, Magazines, and Internet web sites.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is slightly off-topic but...in light of the discussion...I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thought I'd raise the issue. I'm interested in hearing other peoples
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; views.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This morning I received a phone call from one of my clients who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;might&quot; be considered a spammer. He's a headhunter who sends out job
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; offers to a very select group of people (about 10,000 people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worldwide). All his job offers are legitimate (he's been doing this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since the early days of email and has placed people in some very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; high-paying positions around the globe). He does *not* hide who he is;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; he does *not* use a non-existent email account; he does *not* use a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-existent web address. Since his is *not* an opt-in list...as soon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as someone says &quot;Remove Me&quot; he removes them from his list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However...now he's getting worried. When he sends emails to potential
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; candidates that have an MSN address...the emails get bounced back.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, let me emphasize that all his job offers are legitimate. They
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be viewed at his website (he hides the name of the employer and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; salary range since...as a headhunter...he doesn't want anyone doing an
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; end run around him. However...he also has &quot;entry-level&quot; jobs for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; students and does not make any money on those...he offers them as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;service&quot; to the industry).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The point is that my client is panicking. He's worried he'll be put
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out of business now that AOL, MSN, et al., are talking about ways to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deal with spam.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm interested to hear what others may think about this particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
