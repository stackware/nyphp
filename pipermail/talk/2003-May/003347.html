<PRE>If you are still looking, I could help out here.

Briefly, I have been a webmaster, senior developer and 
a desktop graphics specialist. I have tutored new users 
on software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Quark, 
and PowerPoint.

I have been told I am an excellent teacher. I prepare a 
learning plan, provide tip sheets and teach shortcuts 
and optimized techniques right up front.

I have 7 years of web programming and design experience.

Today, I actively program PHP, SQL, XML, JavaScript, CSS 
and XHTML.

I maintain a website that has tutorials, research and 
links on web topics. Contact me, if you would like to 
discuss this further.

Warmest regards,

Peter Sawczynec, Technology Director
PSWebcode -- opensource programming 
for the interactive web

This is definitely an unusual request.

A friend's friend has a 10 year old who would like to learn web
programming for this summer.

If someone who would like to take up this challenge. Tutoring would
probably take 2-3 hours per session, 2-3 times a week during weekdays.
Teaching time is flexible and tutoring fee is open for discussion.  If
interested, please contact Randy at <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">projectconsultants at yahoo.com</A> or I
can forward it to him.

About the potential student:
He has been in the States for 3 months in Long Island City, NY, and is
just beginning to adjust to the language.  He had extensive English and
computer tutoring at the Pagan school in Harbin, China but his English
is not advanced enough to be taught in standard classroom level.  He
currently attends UNIS United Nations school but has problems because
his computer skills are at a higher level than his peers but the
language is a barrier.
