<PRE>Jim,

It's my kids that I worry most about...at least where spam is
concerned...so we are definitely in agreement there.

One part of me agrees that spam is spam no matter what level of
&quot;honesty&quot; may be behind it (in the case of my client). The other part of
me is concerned about my client. 

Jeff

As cold and uncaring as it sounds, if stopping someone from sending
unsolicited e-mail is going to kill their business than they need to
find another way to do their business, or lose their business.

Spam is unsolicited e-mail.  It doesn't matter weather you think you
have a legitimate reason to send Spam, it's still spam.  I'm against
Spam, unsolicited sales calls on the phone, unsolicited faxes, junk mail
and all such things.  We get commercials on TV which I have never
minded, because it's how TV gets it's money while I get TV for free.
There are adverts in newspapers and magazines because this either pays
for the rag, or helps to keep the subscription price down to a
reasonable price.  Mail is not free, the price of mail continues to go
up as the post office is struggling under the increased load of mail
where mail routes need to be made shorter and more delivery people
added.  Fax is not free, I have to pay for the paper and ink and if its
a business line I have to pay for the message units used to receive the
fax.  E-mail is not free, I have to pay a provider for it, or buy the
equipment and pay a provider to hook up to the net.

What's even worse about spam is how it's in your face.  I have kids who
are receiving spam for all kinds of perverse crap.  I don't get perverse
crap in the mail ( and even if i did, it would be in an envelop where I
can choose to throw it out before I even see the perversity ), I don't
get calls from phone sex people trying to get my business, but yet I get
totally offensive garbage in my e-mail.

I have no sympathy for anyone who uses unsolicited means to sell their
product or service.  There are enough places to advertise right now in
TV, Radio, Newspapers, Magazines, and Internet web sites.

Jim

&gt;<i> This is slightly off-topic but...in light of the discussion...I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought I'd raise the issue. I'm interested in hearing other peoples 
</I>&gt;<i> views.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This morning I received a phone call from one of my clients who 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;might&quot; be considered a spammer. He's a headhunter who sends out job 
</I>&gt;<i> offers to a very select group of people (about 10,000 people 
</I>&gt;<i> worldwide). All his job offers are legitimate (he's been doing this 
</I>&gt;<i> since the early days of email and has placed people in some very 
</I>&gt;<i> high-paying positions around the globe). He does *not* hide who he is;
</I>
&gt;<i> he does *not* use a non-existent email account; he does *not* use a 
</I>&gt;<i> non-existent web address. Since his is *not* an opt-in list...as soon 
</I>&gt;<i> as someone says &quot;Remove Me&quot; he removes them from his list. 
</I>&gt;<i> However...now he's getting worried. When he sends emails to potential 
</I>&gt;<i> candidates that have an MSN address...the emails get bounced back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, let me emphasize that all his job offers are legitimate. They 
</I>&gt;<i> can be viewed at his website (he hides the name of the employer and 
</I>&gt;<i> salary range since...as a headhunter...he doesn't want anyone doing an
</I>
&gt;<i> end run around him. However...he also has &quot;entry-level&quot; jobs for 
</I>&gt;<i> students and does not make any money on those...he offers them as a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;service&quot; to the industry).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point is that my client is panicking. He's worried he'll be put 
</I>&gt;<i> out of business now that AOL, MSN, et al., are talking about ways to 
</I>&gt;<i> deal with spam.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm interested to hear what others may think about this particular 
</I>&gt;<i> situation.
