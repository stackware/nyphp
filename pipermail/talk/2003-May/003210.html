<PRE>As cold and uncaring as it sounds, if stopping someone from sending
unsolicited e-mail is going to kill their business than they need to find
another way to do their business, or lose their business.

Spam is unsolicited e-mail.  It doesn't matter weather you think you have a
legitimate reason to send Spam, it's still spam.  I'm against Spam,
unsolicited sales calls on the phone, unsolicited faxes, junk mail and all
such things.  We get commercials on TV which I have never minded, because
it's how TV gets it's money while I get TV for free.  There are adverts in
newspapers and magazines because this either pays for the rag, or helps to
keep the subscription price down to a reasonable price.  Mail is not free,
the price of mail continues to go up as the post office is struggling under
the increased load of mail where mail routes need to be made shorter and
more delivery people added.  Fax is not free, I have to pay for the paper
and ink and if its a business line I have to pay for the message units used
to receive the fax.  E-mail is not free, I have to pay a provider for it, or
buy the equipment and pay a provider to hook up to the net.

What's even worse about spam is how it's in your face.  I have kids who are
receiving spam for all kinds of perverse crap.  I don't get perverse crap in
the mail ( and even if i did, it would be in an envelop where I can choose
to throw it out before I even see the perversity ), I don't get calls from
phone sex people trying to get my business, but yet I get totally offensive
garbage in my e-mail.

I have no sympathy for anyone who uses unsolicited means to sell their
product or service.  There are enough places to advertise right now in TV,
Radio, Newspapers, Magazines, and Internet web sites.

Jim

Subject: RE: [nycphp-talk] Masking Emails and Avoiding Spam - OOPS


&gt;<i> This is slightly off-topic but...in light of the discussion...I thought
</I>&gt;<i> I'd raise the issue. I'm interested in hearing other peoples views.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This morning I received a phone call from one of my clients who &quot;might&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> be considered a spammer. He's a headhunter who sends out job offers to a
</I>&gt;<i> very select group of people (about 10,000 people worldwide). All his job
</I>&gt;<i> offers are legitimate (he's been doing this since the early days of
</I>&gt;<i> email and has placed people in some very high-paying positions around
</I>&gt;<i> the globe). He does *not* hide who he is; he does *not* use a
</I>&gt;<i> non-existent email account; he does *not* use a non-existent web
</I>&gt;<i> address. Since his is *not* an opt-in list...as soon as someone says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Remove Me&quot; he removes them from his list. However...now he's getting
</I>&gt;<i> worried. When he sends emails to potential candidates that have an MSN
</I>&gt;<i> address...the emails get bounced back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, let me emphasize that all his job offers are legitimate. They can
</I>&gt;<i> be viewed at his website (he hides the name of the employer and salary
</I>&gt;<i> range since...as a headhunter...he doesn't want anyone doing an end run
</I>&gt;<i> around him. However...he also has &quot;entry-level&quot; jobs for students and
</I>&gt;<i> does not make any money on those...he offers them as a &quot;service&quot; to the
</I>&gt;<i> industry).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point is that my client is panicking. He's worried he'll be put out
</I>&gt;<i> of business now that AOL, MSN, et al., are talking about ways to deal
</I>&gt;<i> with spam.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm interested to hear what others may think about this particular
</I>&gt;<i> situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
