I use php-Accerator as well, but I also use phpCache v1.4 - PHP caching
engine
http://www.0x00.org/php/phpCache/

Basically, it's good for storing variables in your cache for X amount of
time. For example, your front page might have 10 queries on it. Does the
content need to be that fresh? If not, try phpcache and store that array or
string.

in a nutshell,

if you want free, go with phpa (http://www.php-accelerator.co.uk/)
if you're willing to part with $$$ go with Zend.

also, be sure to look into other places you can improve performance.

Just a note that most people use PEAR's Cache module for this, its more
robust and supports a variety of different methods for application level
caching.

As mentioned by others, you may be getting your PHP versions crossed between
what you've compiled and what you're running as a CLI and Apache module.

I would say most likely.  For an environment like this, I'd recommend
scraping any installers and packages and compile straight from source, both
Apache and PHP.  Not considering compatibility and versioning issues, as
you're seeing now, often times Oracle needs a couple tweaks in PHP to run
correctly (enable PHP's own SIGCHLD handler maybe needed, for example).  So,
compile all from source so at least you can set your baseline of what
features are enabled, etc.

Also, be aware of the ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_BASE environment variables. 
These must be set correctly, both as a shell, and within Apache (I generally
set them in apachectl or envvars for Apache2).

> Is there some trick to installing the Oracle client software?

Patience.

This can put you in a difficult situation.  If you're developing an
application that requires special extensions compiled it, for example LDAP,
running a local PHP version in Windows won't get you very far.

I generally write for Oracle enabled PHP and I have no desire to set things
up in Windows.  So, I install the debugger remotely, or use a lot of echo
statements  :)  That said, if this is a development server you're working on
(it is, right?) they should accomodate you and install the debugger.

I wish they had this for every language :-)

So apparently you can just append the function in the request and it will use your Language-Accept header to return the manual page for the requested function ... pretty handy ...

My favorite "cool" thing similar to this is mentioned in one of Rasmus's talks:

http://talks.php.net/show/oscon2002/52

Basically, you generate images on-demand using a 404 handler. But, the cool
part is that once generated, future requests for that image will not generate
the 404, so the image will not be regenerated. It's dynamic only as much as
necessary. :-)

Yeah, I use that for my remote admin. But I was thinking of something 
along the lines of Timbuktu or PC Anywhere, where I can get an actual 
desktop.

Yeah.  Just a note (people often mistakenly give Rasmus attribution for
this trick), this idea is from Stig Bakken at FAST Search & Transfer.

Hey! This strikes me as a really great way to mix dynamic content with 
static. The way php.net enables this feature is to use an Apache 
directive to invoke a script if the requested page isn't found:

># Handle errors with local error handler script
>     ErrorDocument 401 /error/index.php
>
But another way to look at this is just the opposite: for most requests, 
I want the script to generate a page dynamically based on the request. 
But every now and then (a cache for popular pages, say, or an override) 
a page will actually exist at the requested URI, which will then be served.

Off to experiment I go!

    chris.

Yep, you can do the same thing with a mod_rewrite handler btw (it will
give you more control at the sake of portability.)

I think an even cooler feature is if you mix it with the soundex,
levenshtein, or similartext, something i did w/ alicebot development a while
ago ... im still migrating from J2EE to PHP so i didn't realize it was
available ... but brings me to another question which is if there are any
packages that can automatically setup a SOAP based URI API for you?

/foo/bar?param1=one

Id like to wrap an API off one machine like this ...

app.website.com/api/function?params=x

Anything that can do XML-RPC/SOAP automatically?

Check out Dave's article on ONLamp.com on Custom Error pages with PHP

Mathew,

The product I use is vnc.  Here are all of the vnc projects out of
freshmeat:

http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=vnc&section=projects

I think you will probably be interested in the OSX version and perhaps
tightvnc for intel platforms, and plain ole vnc for Macs running os 9x.

The OS X version had two issues for me: lack of a proper mouse cursor and
lack of support for classic apps (though it now occurs to me perhaps you
need two vnc servers for a mixed mac environment).

Vnc is not a secure solution, but there are ways to make it so.  I am sure
you will be able to dig up details on how to do this fromthe various
projects.

You have to love headlines like that:

"Major Internet vulnerability discovered in e-mail protocol"

So, are we to assume that a vulnerability was found in the Internet (whatever
that means)? Or, are we supposed to assume the vulnerability is in IMAP, SMTP,
or POP?

This article is just talking about the sendmail vulnerability, if you can
manage to read through the sensationalist BS. :-) It is definitely worth
attention, however, and my systems are already patched.

Message-ID: <20030303212958.80160.qmail@web12803.mail.yahoo.com>


My apologies for leaving all the fine answers to my previous post hanging
over the weeks, however just as I was about to sit down and begin coding, the
ColdFusion/Oracle/Win2K (COW Technology suite?) server fell to it's knees. 
FYI, don't put a virus scanner on Oracle log and database files - I didn't do
it, some other admin did.

So the AMP side of things is done and now it's a matter of tieing the two
together.  One problem that remains, however, is the limited reach, and
unlimited liability, I have with the COW server.

Chris, your idea of fingerprinting the browser's request header is great, and
something I'll use in the future, as are the other techniques of generating a
key of sorts and passing it around (I don't have any access to a DB on the CF
side so I have no persistence aside from a GET or POST).

The problem I see, as you eluded to Adam, is the lack of a MD5 function
builtin to CF.  Is this really the case?  I may seem like I'm being pedantic,
but I need to leave the slightest footprint [impression] on the CF side... no
additional files, DB access, etc.  I'm limited to this because the CF piece
is not mine, and as I found out during the server fiasco, the ISV is *very*
quick to point the finger.

So I'm left with only being able to put a tiny link, minimally generated by
builtin CF functionality.  Hence, my thinking a MAC address would at least be
enough to force most medical students into logging into the CF page first,
while keeping even this ISV from placing blame.

I know this seems like a brain teaser folks; but because it is  :)


Thanks,

Hans

That's an unfortunate situation that is going to make things difficult for you.
As I recall, CF's cryptographic functions are extremely weak. In fact, I
remember there being an encrypt() and decrypt() only. I had to write CFX tags
for triple DES and MD5.

Since you (they) are running on Windows, you probably won't have to write your
own like I did (mine were for Solaris). You can search for cfx_md5 on Google or
something and find a few. This violates your idea of "slightest footprint", but
I'm not sure if you'll find any better way. CF's encrypt() function is a
tow-way, so it will be way too big for what you need to do.

Is there session management on the CF side? Are they using the registry as the
data store? If so, you can at least leverage that for persistent storage. Also,
you can pass the cfid and cftoken yourself using PHP, so that you keep up with
sessions on the PHP side, and the cfid:cftoken combination is just another
unique identifier in the same way that PHPSESSID is.

This will make it "work", and you can then investigate either cfx_md5 in
combination with my earlier suggestion(s) or the MAC address idea you have.

My experience with CF is very limited, and I found that code with a
google search. Sorry...

No kidding. I think it's higher-profile because it's the first[1] 
vulnerability released under the Department of Homeland Security's newly 
watchful eyes. The announcement I got from SANS reads like a press kit[2].

Are all new vulnerabilities going to be released this way? I have a pdf 
of the final cyber defense plan around here someplace, but I've never 
been able to get through that either..


[1] I'm not sure it's the first. I scanned the text but didn't see an 
advisory number, the snort buffer overflow that this one shared an email 
with is 03-003, so maybe it's actually the second

[2] I would think it's OK to post this...
***********************************************************************
Here's the DHS/NIPC Advisory

Remote Sendmail Header Processing Vulnerability

SUMMARY:

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Infrastructure
Protection Center (NIPC) is issuing this advisory to heighten
awareness of the recently discovered Remote Sendmail Header Processing
Vulnerability (CAN-2002-1337). NIPC has been working closely with
the industry on vulnerability awareness and information dissemination.

The Remote Sendmail Header Processing Vulnerability allows local and
remote users to gain almost complete control of a vulnerable Sendmail
server. Attackers gain the ability to execute privileged commands using
super-user (root) access/control. This vulnerability can be exploited
through a simple e-mail message containing malicious code. Sendmail is
the most commonly used Mail Transfer Agent and processes an estimated
50 to 75 percent of all Internet e-mail traffic. System administrators
should be aware that many Sendmail servers are not typically shielded
by perimeter defense applications. A successful attacker could install
malicious code, run destructive programs and modify or delete files.

Additionally, attackers may gain access to other systems
thru a compromised Sendmail server, depending on local
configurations. Sendmail versions 5.2 up to 8.12.8 are known to be
vulnerable at this time.

DESCRIPTION:

The Remote Sendmail Header Processing Vulnerability is exploited
during the processing and evaluation of e-mail header fields collected
during an SMTP transaction. Examples of these header fields are the
"To", "From" and "CC" lines. The crackaddr() function in the Sendmail
headers.c file allows Sendmail to evaluate whether a supplied address
or list of addresses contained in the header fields is valid. Sendmail
uses a static buffer to store processed data. It detects when the
static buffer becomes full and stops adding characters. However,
Sendmail continues processing data and several security checks are
used to ensure that characters are parsed correctly. The vulnerability
allows a remote attacker to gain access to the Sendmail server by
sending an e-mail containing a specially crafted address field which
triggers a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATION:
Due to the seriousness of this vulnerability, the NIPC is strongly
recommending that system administrators who employ Sendmail take this
opportunity to review the security of their Sendmail software and to
either upgrade to Sendmail 8.12.8 or apply the appropriate patch for
older versions as soon as possible.
Patches for the vulnerability are available from Sendmail, from ISS who
discovered the vulnerability and from vendors whose applications
incorporate Sendmail code, including IBM, HP, SUN, Apple and SGI. Other
vendors will release patches in the near future.
The primary distribution site for Sendmail is: http://www.sendmail.org
Patches and information are also available from the following sites:
The ISS Download center http://www.iss.net/download
IBM Corporation http://www.ibm.com/support/us/
Hewlett-Packard , Co. http://www.hp.com
Silicon Graphics Inc. http://www.sgigate.sgi.com
Apple Computer, Inc. http://www.apple.com/
Sun Microsystems, Inc. http://www.sun.com/service/support/
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Project http://CVE.mitre.org

As always, computer users are advised to keep their anti-virus and
systems software current by checking their vendor's web sites frequently
for new updates and to check for alerts put out by the DHS/NIPC,
CERT/CC, ISS and other cognizant organizations. The DHS/NIPC encourages
recipients of this advisory to report computer intrusions to their local
FBI office (http://www.fbi.gov/contact/fo/fo.htm) and other appropriate
authorities. Recipients may report incidents online to
http://www.nipc.gov/incident/cirr.htm. The DHS/NIPC Watch and Warning
Unit can be reached at (202) 323-3204/3205/3206 or nipc.watch at fbi.gov.

Background on government/industry cooperation to mitigate damage

The Sendmail Vulnerability Announced Today, March 3, 2003
How Well Did The Cyber Defense Community Do?

Today, hundreds of thousands of people learned of a vulnerability in
the sendmail program which is widely used for Internet mail handling.
A vulnerability in such a widely used open source software program
presents difficult challenges for the cyber defense community -
including the need to get more than twenty different software
organizations to act quickly and silently to develop patches.

Three primary actions are required to respond effectively to such
a vulnerability:

1. Verify that the vulnerability exists and is important.
2. Contact the key technical personnel at each of the software
companies and other groups that distribute sendmail (either alone or
with other software) and ensure that they develop and test patches
and make them ready for widespread distribution.
3. Plan and execute an early warning and distribution strategy
that enables critical infrastructure organizations in the US and in
partner countries to be prepared for rapid deployment of the patches
once they are ready.  This must be accomplished without leaking data
about the vulnerability to the black hat community that exploits such
vulnerabilities by creating worms like Code Red, Slapper, and Slammer.

When possible, several other actions may be appropriate:

4. Provide military and other very sensitive organizations with early
access to the patches so their systems can be protected even before
public disclosure of the vulnerability.
5. Use sensor networks with smart filters to test for exploitation.
6. Develop and distribute filters that can block the offending packets
to protect systems that cannot or will not install patches immediately.

On Saturday, March 1, 2003, the US Department of Homeland Security
became fully operational, although the elements of the new department
had been working together for several weeks.  In cybersecurity, the new
Department brings together four highly visible cybersecurity agencies:
(1) The National Infrastructure Protection Center from the FBI, (2)
FedCIRC from the General Services Administration, (3) the National
Communications System program from the US Department of Defense, and
(4) the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office from the Department
of Commerce.

Today's disclosure of a vulnerability in sendmail offers the
opportunity to see how quickly and effectively the cyber defense
community, led by this new Department, can respond to important
threats.

Sendmail's vulnerability offers a legitimate test because sendmail
handles a large amount of Internet mail traffic and is installed on
at least 1.5 million Internet-connected systems. More than half of
the large ISPs and Fortune 500 companies use sendmail, as do tens of
thousands of other organizations. A security hole in sendmail affects
a lot of people and demands their immediate attention.

You can draw your own conclusion on how well the problem is being
handled. Here are the facts:

1. On Friday, February 14, telephone calls to the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) and the White House Office of Cyberspace
Security alerted the US government to a suspected sendmail
vulnerability. The source of the data was Internet Security
Systems (ISS), a well-respected security firm with solid security
research credentials, giving the data an initial base level of
credibility. However, to be more certain, DHS technical experts
reviewed the details of the vulnerability and especially the
tests that ISS had run to prove the existence and severity of the
vulnerability. They were convinced.

2. Almost immediately the DHS/White House team, working with ISS,
contacted vendors that distribute sendmail, including Sun, IBM,
HP, and SGI, as well as the Sendmail Consortium, the organization
that develops the open source version of sendmail that is the core
of sendmail distributed with both free and commercial operating
systems. Partially because of government involvement, but primarily
because the vulnerability involved the widely used sendmail package,
the vendors immediately started working together on patches.

3. The DHS/White House staff contacted and shared what they knew with
the US Department of Defense and the Federal CIO Council. Through the
Federal CIO Council, the US FedCIRC and US Office of Management and
Budget were added to the coordinating team. Together the government
planners, ISS, and the vendors developing patches worked out a plan
for public dissemination of the vulnerability information and patch
distribution.

4. To help ensure that the open source LINUX and BSD distributions
(Red Hat, SUSE, OpenBSD, etc.) developed patches, the Computer
Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University (CERT/CC) was
brought into the project. CERT/CC deployed its formalized process to
inform the LINUX and BSD distribution developers and to assist them
in getting the corrected source code and any additional knowledge
needed to create the patch. CERT/CC (which is funded, in part, by two
organizations being merged into DHS and by the DoD) also created an
advisory to educate system administrators and the security community
in general on the vulnerability, on which systems are affected,
and on where to get the patches for each affected system.

5. Some of the large commercial vendors developed the patches very
quickly, but the delayed notice to smaller sources of sendmail
distributions and limited resources at those organizations meant
that not all the patches would be ready by early in the week of
February 23. The coordinating group faced a decision of whether to
release data about the exploit before most patches were ready or to
wait. The answer depended on whether they had reason to believe an
exploit was already being used by attackers. They had two sources
of information that led them to conclude waiting an extra week was
acceptable. First, people who monitored the hacker discussion groups
reported that this vulnerability did not seem to be one that was being
discussed. Second, the organization that discovered the vulnerability,
ISS, had deployed sensors for the exploit in a number of places
around the world. Those sensors were showing no exploits. Based on
both sets of data, the coordination group decided to schedule the
announcement for Monday, March 3. A second-order reason to schedule
a Monday announcement was that some members of the team believed
that Monday-Tuesday announcements generate more rapid and complete
patching than announcements made late in the week.

6. Since some of the patches were ready, the coordination group
decided to provide what was available to the US DoD so that military
sites could have the protection as early as possible. The military
distributions took place on or around February 25 and 26.

7. On February 27 and 28, government groups in the US and in several
other countries were given early warnings, without details about how
the vulnerability could be exploited, to help them plan for rapid
deployment of the patches when they were released on March 3. In
addition to the Chief Information Officers of US Cabinet level
departments, and the directors or deputy directors of national
cyber security offices in several other countries, the officers of
the critical infrastructure Information Sharing And Analysis Centers
(ISACs) were also briefed so they could be ready for rapid information
distribution to commercial organizations such as banks and utilities,
that comprise the critical infrastructure.

8. On March 3, beginning about 10 am EST, alerts began flowing to
federal agencies from FedCIRC and to the critical infrastructure
companies from the ISACs. At noon, ISS released their advisory,
followed by CERT/CC's general release. Once the data was public,
the SANS Institute also issued a release and scheduled free web-based
education programs.

I have a feeling, yes... at least for fairly important alerts.  The DOHS
certainly patted itself on the back on this one, and possibly slightly
deservingly.

But the media blows all security releases out of proportion.  The Slammer
worm came across as a threat to humanity, when in fact, if MSSQL admins would
have applied a critical patch available last June, there wouldn't be any
problem.

On the bright side, the media makes a big deal that a worm is loose in MS
land, while making a big deal when a risk is found in UNIX land; gives the
UNIX admins a nice heads up  :)

Well, somewhat cool IMHO.

Yeah, certainly not new.

The reason I said somewhat cool is because when you implement this
ErrorDocument bit on your own server, you get swamped with error logs (which
I have been unable to turn off - please correct me otherwise).  It is nice
functionality for the user, however.

The "right" way to implement this type of thing is with mod_rewrite or, even
better, apache_hooks, which I'm anxious to get my "hooks" into.  Albeit, not
as portable.

You can supress those error messages btw.

How?  Aside from anything like:

ErrorLog /dev/null

or

ErrorLog |/mylogfilter.psh

in httpd.conf.

Well, there you go.  You can also build in error log handling into your
404 script, and supress the external logging :)

Another, final option (which is what I do) is to strip them out before
processing them with a log analysis tool.

I believe you can even leave ErrorLog out of the httpd.conf file
to leave errors unlogged.

Would help if you can tell us what you're trying to do in dynamic2.
If you're trying to just loop through the children:

<html>
<body>
<? $counter=1;
   foreach ( $Child as $c ) {
	echo "Child #". $counter++ ." is $c <br>";
   }
?>

Hey, are you Eddy Nunez from NJIT?

Solving the guys' problem:

$Child is type Array.
To see the data, here is an example to use (as dynamic2.php):

<?
foreach ($_GET['Child'] as $name) {
        print "$name<br>";
}
?>

You should really use a POST instead of a GET for dynamic.php.
With lots of children, the url could get really messy.

Subject: system commands and backups
Message-ID: <000501c2e29e$ada05030$76941d18@enobrev>

I am going through the concepts of a php based file backup system for
server administrators.  I have an idea of what i want to do.  Allow
admins to create a list of customer directories, set up frequency of
backups (which will create cron jobs) and let the cron take care of the
scheduling.
 
So here's my question.  Is there a way to allow a php script to run
shell commands as an admin or specific user?  In order to tarball these
directories, the script will need access to them, which is going to
require something better than "nobody" as a user.  I figured maybe if
it's run via command line php (not using lynx method) that it would be
run as the current user (no idea if that's correct).  But what if the
client doesn't have php installed to be used via command line?  Is is
still possible to run commands as a different user?
 
Thanks!!!
 
Mark

Hi Mark.  I have done this, but before anyone would want
to do so, they should recognize the security risks involved.
It may be a convenience versus security issue, wherein you
may accidentally allow all of your web users (possibly
everyone in the world?) to access anything that your user
(or worse yet, your 'root' user) can.

	So I hope you already know all about that.  Now,
to answer your question, you may be able to set the "setuid"
bit on your PHP CGI executable, together with changing the
ownership of the executable itself.  Then you can associate
certain files or directories to use *this* PHP CGI handler
instead of the default (apache module PHP, correct?).

	For example, if you want all files ending in '.uphp'
to be executed by your special set-user PHP, you might do the
following, which will allow *.php files to be executed normally,
but *.uphp files will be executed by user 'marka' (or whatever):

	1/ Add the following Apache .htaccess lines:

Options +ExecCGI
AddType cgi-script .cgi
Action user-php /php.cgi
AddHandler user-php .uphp

	2/ Copy your PHP 4.3.1 or later CGI binary to
your webserver root, and rename it as described above
(php.cgi).

	3/ Change the ownership as appropriate, and
set the setuid bit:

chown marka php.cgi
chmod u+s php.cgi

	4/ Sit back and wait to be hacked!


	One other nice thing is that this PHP parser can
have its own php.ini file, which may be different from the
one the rest of the webserver uses!

	Maybe some other better sysadmins can comment on
how to make this setup more secure.  Like these ideas:

	1/ Run a separate httpd server on a special port
using this special configuration.

	2/ Restrict the special port using a firewall or
ipchains or whathaveyou.

	3/ chroot the filesystem for this special config,
so that your whole machine won't get hacked.


	Another approach (which maybe I should have mentioned
first) is to use 'sudo' to allow your 'nobody' user to do only
certain special tasks.

	If your webserver is on a totally private network and
you're not worried about system security, you can do a lot more.
But if it's on the Internet, be aware!!!

Best, George.

Have a copy of PHP installed as a standalone binary.  Write a PHP CGI, or
better yet, PHP CLI script that does what you want.  Put the script into
a directory of the user you want the script to run as.  Just to be clear,
I mean their shell user directory, not their web directory.  Now, call
the script via the crontab of that same user.

Enjoy,

Actaully, the security concerns you're mentioning is the primary reason
for my shout to the group.  I really want to offer a good solution, but
it seems like it leaves a pretty wide hole open.  

Anyone else know of ways to run special user privileged commands with
half the fat?

Thanks George.

Well, as of PHP 4.3 you have a command-line interface to PHP. As such  
it becomes much easier to run a php script as a specific user. The  
question then becomes do you need a web interface for it?

They are asking for a web interface, but I suppose I could just allow
for settings changes within the interface, while the script uses those
settings to make things happen.  OF course I'll also have to see what
their upgrade schedule is.

Thanks..

Yep, you can do the same thing with a mod_rewrite handler btw (it will
give you more control at the sake of portability.)

1) create some shell scripts that do specifically what you want. 
(tar/gzip up directories?)
2) configure sudo so that those scripts can be run as another user 
(authorized to be executable by "nobody")
3) call the scripts from within php.

As always, your script should perform strict sanity checks before 
passing data to the "system call".

I have root access to the box I need to backup, and so I don't even
use sudo.  As root, I made a cron job like:
tar cfz stuff.tgz /all/my/stuff && scp stuff.tgz cmerlo at otherbox:~/backups

Nice and neat, no PHP involved.  Certainly not web configurable, but I
tend to see that as a good thing.

yea, I have root on the boxes I work on too, but
the sudo thing is sort of an "extra layer" of protection.

Actually, I was using it because I needed to create/manage files
and directories under the ownership of a specific user (Postfix).

On my own servers, I already have a couple scripts in place to take care
of a ll backups, incremetally with storage on separate drives and all
that fun stuff.  But the client want his web configurable, and who am I
to say no when the client already knows the risks at hand and my
landlord is waiting for payment, :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Announcing the Long Island PHP Users Group
In-Reply-To: <200303042117.h24LGNrO093942@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <LBEDJMJGLEPEKJAJMHBDCEGHECAA.tom@supertom.com>

(Also posted on LILUG, sorry to those who received two copies!)

Hello All,

I would like to start a Long Island PHP users group for the folks out here
that cannot travel to Manhattan for NYPHP meetings, and am looking for
others who may be interested in the same. I've checked with my boss, and he
is supportive of the idea, so I can provide the following for now:

- Meeting space - our office (Hauppauge) will hold about 15 or so people,
and we can secure other space if we need it.

- Hosting space - for a website/mailing list, etc.  I have a dedicated
machine running Linux, the mailman software and Apache/PHP at www.liphp.org

- Computers/Network - we have several computers available in the office for
demos, surfing, etc.

- Coffee, bottled water, etc - we have that stuff here for the employees, so
ordering a little more isn't such a big deal.

I figured that we could meet the last week of every month (Mon/Wed/Friday is
good for me, but whatever the group decides is fine), as to not conflict
with LILUG.  We have registered the domain liphp.org, and the website and
mailing list could operate from there (the mailing list is already
operational).

Newbies and experienced PHP developers are both strongly encouraged to
attend.  We would like the group to cater to both.  Personally, I feel that
promoting professional use of PHP will only give it more credibility in the
corporate world, which is a good thing for all of us.  But, as I said
before, the group is meant for both parties, and in fact, if we can't get
any volunteers, I figured I would give an overview of PHP in terms of
features, use, and installation.

I invite everyone interested in PHP to join the mailing list.  (Of course,
the member list not available to anyone except the administrators.)
http://www.liphp.org/mailman/listinfo/liphp

If you would to volunteer in any way, we need the following:

* Speakers for our meetings
* A website
* System Administrator for our LIPHP server
* Promotion
* Someone to work on a mission/charter, and officers
* Maybe a projector?

and anything else that I haven't thought of (which I'm sure is plenty).

I welcome your comments and questions.  Since this is a new creation, I am
not married to any of the ideas above (except the concept of a Long Island
PHP users group - I like that idea, of course!) and encourage suggestions.
Any problems with the mailing list, please let me know as well.

Thanks,

Tom Melendez

Hi,

I am registering for the PHPCON East conference and I notice there is a 
registration option for NYPHP members, but it requires a password.

If it has already been posted to the list, I apologize, but could 
someone post it again?

Absolutely.  I'm writing this away from my office, so please forgive my 
being vague...

Setup the PHP executables and supporting files in separate directories.  
Then, in your httpd.conf file, duplicate your PHP handlers (you know,
AddHandler, Action, etc).  Have one group process, for example, .php
pointing to the php5 dir and the other process .htm files pointing to the
php4 directory.

Make sense?  If not, I can follow up with real world examples when i get 
back.

Cool, that did the trick. In the process I also figured out that Nuspehere's
PHPed had added some lines into my php.ini (4.3.1) that was breaking up
extensions.

Thanks Dan.

This is great - I wish LIPHP the best and the support of New York PHP moving
forward.

I look forward to working together and please don't hesitate to contact me in
the future.  Also, I could probably do some system administration for you if
you'd like.

Best,

The NYPHP-Jobs list is more appropiate for this type of thing.  You can
subscribe at http://nyphp.org/list/ and post to jobs at nyphp.org.  There's also
a jobs board, http://jobs.nyphp.org and you can submit job descriptions to
jobs-submit at nyphp.org

OK.. through a web interface I'm assuming.

Well, yes... but the question could mean a couple of things.

If you need the apache process that PHP runs in, if you're using mod_php then
you'll need suEXEC (I think) to run as a different user than the default. 
This is not recommended, especially to have it run as root.

If you're using the CGI version of PHP (not CLI mind you) then it'll run as
the process who runs it.  In Linux anyway, you can not setuid a script (it
has to be a binary).  Although there are ways around this, I wouldn't pursue
it.

I have a system similar to this and I would take a different approach.  For
one, I have two distinct installs of PHP on my systems - /usr/local/php/ and
/usr/local/psh/ - with each having their own php.ini.  They are compiled as a
Apache DSO and --disable-cgi (which defaults to CLI in 4.3.1), respectivly. 
I also highly recommend 4.3.1 for CLI use.

Now on one tier, you would have a web interface that would let users setup
jobs that they want for backup - let's say you store this in MySQL.

Then, you'd have a PHP script (using /usr/local/psh/bin/php, which I link as
/bin/psh for convience) that would be run by root's cron every hour.  This
script would pull the jobs from MySQL, do sanity checks, do the backup, set
proper permissions, etc.

This way you eliminate security issues, and since the script is being run as
root, you'll have full access to all the user's files and can make proper
backups.  A fairly clean system I feel, that keeps the web away from your
underlying system, eases maintenance, and it fairly straightforward.

Sure enough the code wont work, it didnt for me too until i made some changes to it.

DEAR SIR,

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON. GRACE AND PEACE AND LOVE
FROM THIS PART OF THE ATLANTIC TO YOU. I HOPE MY
LETTER DOES NOT CAUSE YOU TOO MUCH EMBARRASSMENT AS I
WRITE TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON THE CONTACT
ADDRESS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND WHO WORKS AT THE

LOT OF MONEY DUE TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH THE FAMILY. BASED ON THIS

FOREIGN PARTNER WHO CAN WORK WITH US AS TO MOVE OUT
THE TOTAL SUM OF US$45,000,000.00 ( FOURTY FIVE
MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ), PRESENTLY IN THEIR
POSSESSION. THIS MONEY WAS OF COURSE, ACQUIRED BY THE
LATE PRESIDENT AND IS NOW KEPT SECRETLY BY THE FAMILY.
THE SWISS GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY FROZEN ALL THE
ACCOUNTS OF THE FAMILY IN SWITZERLAND, AND SOME OTHER
COUNTRIES WOULD SOON FOLLOW TO DO THE SAME. THIS BID
BY SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DEAL WITH THIS FAMILY
HAS MADE IT NECESSARY THAT WE SEEK YOUR ASSISITANCE IN
RECEIVING THIS MONEY AND IN INVESTING IT ON BEHALF OF
THE FAMILY.

THIS MUST BE A JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION AND WE MUST

EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PROTECT IT

PERCENTAGE OF THIS MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTIONIS
CONCLUDED. I WILL, HOWEVER, BASED ON THE GROUNDS THAT
YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH US AND ALSO ALL
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES DISCUSSED BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT
OF THIS TRANSACTION. YOU MAY ALSO DISCUSS YOUR
PERCENTAGE BEFORE WE START TO WORK. AS SOON AS I HEAR
FROM YOU, I WILL GIVE YOU ALL NECESSARY DETAILS AS TO
HOW WE INTEND TO CARRY OUT THE WHOLE TRANSACTION.
PLEASE, DO NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEARS,AS ALL NECESSARY
MODALITIES ARE IN PLACE, AND I ASSURE YOU OF ALL
SUCCESS AND SAFETY IN THIS TRANSACTION.

PLEASE, THIS TRANSACTION REQUIRES ABSOLUTE
CONFIDENTIALITY AND YOU WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TREAT IT
AS SUCH UNTIL THE FUNDS ARE MOVED OUT OF THIS COUNTRY.

PLEASE, YOU WILL ALSO IGNORE THIS LETTER AND RESPECT
OUR TRUST IN YOU BY NOT EXPOSING THIS TRANSACTION,
EVEN
IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED.

I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.

George,

It seemed your message about this article was empty.

Here's the info from IBM's developerWorks:



http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-php4sax/

SAX-like apps in PHP
Use streaming XML data in PHP

While there is no official implementation of the Simple API for XML (SAX) in 
PHP, PHP does provide a SAX-like method for working with both local and 
remote XML files. In this article, author Nicholas Chase shows you how to 
work with XML files in PHP by building and setting handler functions and 
creating a parser. He demonstrates SAX in PHP with a page-building exercise 
in which he crafts a page based on the result of an Amazon Web Services 
query.

Are there any convienient packages that allow you to work w/ XPath based
expression (multiple in one page):

$foo = "/foo/foo";
$bar = "/foo/bar";

(parsing the doc only once for results)

? (not sure if I worded that right)

Hi,
i have a script (page1.php) where i select an id. this in turn calls the following script. (page2.php)
<html>
<head><title>Enter files</title></head>
<body>
<?
include 'getdet.php'; (page3.php)
require 'uploadfiles.php'; (page4.php)
?>
</body>
</html>
now in my getdet.php i have $rn = $_POST['RN']; and using this record number i query the mysql database for the person's credentials. my display is such that the getdet.php displays the credentials in a table followed by boxes to enter the files's location (something like the yahoo briefcase, i have scripted to upload 5 files at on time). now the problem is i need the RN value in a script called 'verifyfiles.php' (page5.php) which is called by the uploadfiles.php. i am able to get it using something like 
    ...
    <br><?$mrn = $_POST['MRN'];?>
 <input type="hidden" name="mrn" value="<?=$mrn;?>">
 <input type="submit" name="action" value="Upload Files" tabindex="11">
    </form>
in uploadfiles.php

wot i want to know is if theres a better method to do this? the RN is set in the page1.php, passed to page3.php called in page2.php, and is also needed by page5.php (finally). now since page5.php is called by page4.php, at present i am including the RN in the page4.php as a hidden field. is there some way for the page5.php to get the value as page3.php does?

the second, that i am unable to do is, say the user wishes to upload more that 5 files, so he clicks on the upload more? link... i have <a href="view.php"> upload more? </a> in page5.php. when i tried, i got error "query failed". thats cos, view.php (page2.php) calls page3.php n thus needs a RN. do i change the scripts to use $_REQUEST instead of $_POST i am using now? in that case it would mean ?$RN appended. but any other beter options plz? 

Thz
Tracy

The easiest way to do this is to uses SESSIONS. Put a "sesssion_start()" at 
the start of your PHP code in each file. In the file where it is defined 
put "$_SESSION['xx'] = rn;". In the files that need the value, put " rn = 
$_SESSION['xx']".

HI, 
thz
i got aroung temporarily by including a $_REQUEST in the page2.php. now in page5 i have a <a href > to page2 with the RN appended to the url
<a href page2.php?RN=<? =$rn ?>> someting like this...
the entire loop works fine but i dont want the RN to be seen now if its possible. i havent started on sessions yet. want to code the entire project and then session them as i have to give access rights to each page. any suggestions on how to pass the rn this way? do i have to include a form just with one hidden field to achieve the purpose?

Hi,
i was trying out the examples for using php from the command line. i have register_globals off and register_argc_argv on. i tried
c:\\php4win\\cli>php -r '$wel = hello; print($wel);'
to get a blank line...
next i tried
c:\\php4win\\cli> php -r "$wel = hello; print($wel);" and the next line was
hello

but the manual says to use single quotes???  have i failed to understand something or is my way of trying out the example is wrong. i tried the examples given in the manual too but they didnt work either... 

i remember some posts that mentioned CLI. i didnt understand wot they were and got interested to find out. can someone plz tell me how to start?

thz
Tracy

Tracy,
I think that in windows you use double quotes and in a unix environment you use single quotes.

Message-ID: <20030311014137.GB6899@unicron.ilovett.com>



I have an idea for an application that I'd like to get some feedback on.
Let's say you need to keep track of user login information for several
client servers. Security is obviously a concern. In my case, I need a
way to safely provide this information to both technical and faintly
technical staff.

I started thinking about how some mailing list managers work, where you
state what you want to do, and then get a confirmation email with a link
or special reply address that must be received by the server in order
for your request to be processed. 

With that in mind, I'm wondering how I could set up a random link
generator that would issue urls that are only valid for n minutes, but
with querystrings that aren't obvious. If I had that piece of the
puzzle, I could add additional security by restricting the addresses who
could receive such links and by storing the passwords in mysql with heavy
user restrictions. So the full process would be:

-send an email to a special account
-email is received by a script which generates a time-sensitive link
-user clicks on link and gets the info they need (over ssl) or gets a "sorry, too
late" message

Has anyone ever done anything like this? Better still, can anyone see a
way to squeeze pgp into the picture?

Hi all,

I need to create a small logger, for our work place, that will log staff's
IP addresses and host names. What I'm trying to do is to log last X accesses
to an online helpdesk, 24 for example. 

I'm having trouble coming up with a query to select/delete the oldest entry
when a X+1st entry,  (25th for the above number), is inserted.

Can anyone hint me on how to go about doing it?

Reliable method:  Have a datetime field in the table, and update that
with the current time every time somebody logs in.  Then you can just
do a "select * from my_table order by name_of_datetime_field" and pull
off the first (last?) entry.

Unreliable method:  If you just do a "select *", things tend to show
up in the order they were inserted.  So, just take the last one.

HTH.

You could use a seq# for each person.  When inserting the record do a select
on max seq# to obtain the highest # used for that individual, increment that
#, insert the new record, then delete where seq# <= newnumber - x and person
= logged in person.

Message-ID: <p0521020bba939ba0acd2@[192.168.0.2]>

Hello,

How one would implement semaphores on Windows NT 5.0?

Could I use COM for that? I'm not familiar with Windows.

Or could it be a good idea to use files and flock?

Any ideas? I'm a little bit afraid to implement semaphore by myself 
because it can lead to tricky situations.

TIA

I forgot to add  that I need semaphores for INSERT and DELETE sql 
statement for MySQL. Maybe this is not needed after all. The rows 
that are concerned are using a column with an AUTO_INCREMENT 
attribute.

I don't need rollback (i.e. transaction). In its book on MySQL, Paul 
Dubois write: "MySQL automatically performs locking for single SQL 
statements to keep clients from interfering with each other." (Paul 
Dubois, MySQL, New Riders, 2000).

Cheers

Can you describe the situation in a bit more detail ?
As you said - you probably don't need semaphores, but what is it exactly
that you're trying to do ...

That's easy (I do it all the time).
Take the original URL (or filename, entry ID, etc) and concat a timestamp to
it.
Enrcypt the whole thing (no need for PGP, just a simple one way encryption
will do).

Then on the landing page decrypt the whole thing and simply see how old the
timestamp is.
If it's withing your timeframe, do a forward / passthrough of the content.

 <body onload="setTimeout('foo()', '<?= $timer ?>')">

Hello Ophir, thanks for the reply.

Its really basic stuff. A Flash file will send via POST to a PHP 
script some text. I need to insert the text in MySQL in a row which 
have an auto_increment column. I want to keep only the last 10 text, 
so I will query MySQL to get all the text, and if I have more than 10 
texts, I will delete the older ones.

Cheers
-Emmanuel

Subject: What is $QUERY_STRING ?
In-Reply-To: <200303111505.h2BF5OLb061952@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <C5EF7C58-53DB-11D7-9448-00039344DCA8@nyu.edu>

Ok, this may sound like a really naive question, but I will ask anyway.

What is the predefined variable $QUERY_STRING ? The PHP manual says:

'QUERY_STRING'
The query string, if any, via which the page was accessed.

That definition is a bit tautological:) I ask because I have some code 
I grabed from a website and it contains the line:

<form action="<?=$PHP_SELF?><?if($QUERY_STRING){ echo"?". 
$QUERY_STRING;}?>"method="POST">

I am guessing this means if the form has been submitted, the key/value 
pairs will be contained in a variable called $QUERY_STRING, but maybe I 
am way off there?

Just to test I made a simple form:

<form action="test2.php" method="post">

Name<input type="text" name="name">
Address<input type="text" name="address" >
Title<input type="text" name="title" >
<input type="submit" name="Submit"">
</form>

I sent that to

<?php

$x= $_POST[name];
$y= $_POST[address];
$z= $_POST[title];

print ("$x ");
print ("$y ");
print ("$z ");
print ($QUERY_STRING);
?>

But nothing prints out for $QUERY_STRING. I tired both POST and GET.

Thanks! I am asking this question mostly out of curiosity. The code I 
downloaded works fine. I just want to know why it works.

$QUERY_STRING is the stuff after the "?" in a GET URL:

http://www.example.com/cart.php?item=cereal&quantity=56

$QUERY_STRING (or $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']) is "item=cereal&quantity=56".

It doesn't have to be key/value pairs:

http://www.example.com/cart.php?buy

$QUERY_STRING is "buy".

You didn't see it in the form you used below because the method was POST.
Change it to GET and watch the query string bloom.

1. on selects, get the latest 10 from the database on selects (just in case)

2. and after an insert, find the 10th latest entry
3. delete all entries older then what u found in step 2

that's of course just one way of doing it.

Yes, this exactly what I want to do. But I was wondering what could 
happens if 2 clients send a text at the same time. I don't think that 
its a problem, but I wanted to check here first.

Thanks David,

I had tried GET, but i was only using print($QUERY_STRING) instead of 
print ($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']); When I added that it did, as you say, 
bloom.

So what purpose is it serving in this code

> <form action="<?=$PHP_SELF?><?if($QUERY_STRING){ echo"?".
> $QUERY_STRING;}?>"method="POST">

if the method is POST?

This is a snipet from some code I downloaded for a login page to my 
site.

Matt

Subject: Memory Issue
Message-ID: <009a01c2e7f1$ec897080$6501a8c0@tom>

Hello Everyone,

I have a question regarding objects and memory. I am designing an
application where I will be working with alot of information related to one
user. I am trying to use the tools I paid the big bucks for in college and
use object orientated programming.

Basically I have five objects Login, Customer, Team, Basket, and Order.
Each of these objects share a relationship on the login Id.  The team is a
group of another object "Player".

I want to store all of these objects in the session for the entire time the
user is logged into the site.  Do you think that this is to much overhead?
Do you think that I would have memory issues?  The site should see alot of
traffic and we are on one redhat server 1.3 ghz and 512mb.

What do you think?

It may seem confusing due to the way PHP names its variables, but a request can
have both GET and POST variables. Your example above is the beginning of a form
that posts the form information to the current page. In case the current page
is http://nyphp.org/blah.php?foo=bar, this code makes sure that the form posts
to blah.php?foo=bar instead of just blah.php.

If you need to use anything in the query string, the $_GET array is populated
with each of the URL variables. You probably already know that, but I thought
I'd mention it.

Dan - using the algorithm below, why is there a need to lock the table ?
It'll work fine without table locking.

1. on selects, get the latest 10 from the database on selects (just in case)

2. and after an insert, find the 10th latest entry
3. delete all entries older then what u found in step 2

greetings,

first i like to say that this subject dont realy
have a lot of info so many people i know including myself having problem
understanding it the first time,

now i want to ask for the best way to deal with calling function
in a url

function one(){

echo "bla bla";

}

function two(){
echo "<a href=\\"$_SERVER[PHP_SELF]?action=one\\">one</a>";
}

switch($_GET['$action']){
case "one":
    one();
    break;
    default:
    two();
     break ;
}

this would work fine if the register globals on , and even than
$action you will have undefined var ($action),
but when register globals off this wont work,
what is the best way to fix this problem, if you have many pages
like that and you want to change your php.ini setting of register globals to
off
without messing around with the code too much?

Check this page:

http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Miscellaneous_functions.html

Look up the GET_LOCK, RELEASE_LOCK and IS_FREE_LOCK functions.  I've had
mixed luck using them w/ php because the locking is per-thread, and I have a
suspicion that my trouble came out of some sort of connection-sharing issue.
But this might be whate you're looking for.

I forgot to add  that I need semaphores for INSERT and DELETE sql
statement for MySQL. Maybe this is not needed after all. The rows
that are concerned are using a column with an AUTO_INCREMENT
attribute.

I don't need rollback (i.e. transaction). In its book on MySQL, Paul
Dubois write: "MySQL automatically performs locking for single SQL
statements to keep clients from interfering with each other." (Paul
Dubois, MySQL, New Riders, 2000).

Louie,

Your code should work with two simple changes when register globals is off:

Change:

$_SERVER[PHP_SELF]  to   $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']  // not strictly necessary
$_GET['$action']    to   $_GET['action']

There currently are no material incentives for contributing,
but if your submission wins, your work will be displayed on
the website and perhaps even on other group materials such
as the officially licensed thong
(http://nyphp.krook.org/img/nyphp-thong.jpg).

That said, what we're looking for in a slogan is something
that embodies our existence as the largest PHP user's
group in the New York metropolitan area, as well as our
aspiration to become a resource to the national PHP community.

We also want to express our commitment to being a resource
for the OS independent AMP technology suite (Apache, MySQL, PHP).

Please direct all submissions to slogan at nyphp.org.

Thanks in advance for your help and good luck,

Ok, this may sound like a really naive question, but I will ask anyway.

What is the predefined variable $QUERY_STRING ? The PHP manual says:

'QUERY_STRING'
The query string, if any, via which the page was accessed.

That definition is a bit tautological:) I ask because I have some code
I grabed from a website and it contains the line:

<form action="<?=$PHP_SELF?><?if($QUERY_STRING){ echo"?".
$QUERY_STRING;}?>"method="POST">

I am guessing this means if the form has been submitted, the key/value
pairs will be contained in a variable called $QUERY_STRING, but maybe I
am way off there?

Just to test I made a simple form:

<form action="test2.php" method="post">

Name<input type="text" name="name">
Address<input type="text" name="address" >
Title<input type="text" name="title" >
<input type="submit" name="Submit"">
</form>

I sent that to

<?php

$x= $_POST[name];
$y= $_POST[address];
$z= $_POST[title];

print ("$x ");
print ("$y ");
print ("$z ");
print ($QUERY_STRING);
?>

But nothing prints out for $QUERY_STRING. I tired both POST and GET.

Thanks! I am asking this question mostly out of curiosity. The code I
downloaded works fine. I just want to know why it works.

Matt

Thanks David,

I had tried GET, but i was only using print($QUERY_STRING) instead of
print ($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']); When I added that it did, as you say,
bloom.

So what purpose is it serving in this code

 > <form action="<?=$PHP_SELF?><?if($QUERY_STRING){ echo"?".
 > $QUERY_STRING;}?>"method="POST">

if the method is POST?

This is a snipet from some code I downloaded for a login page to my
site.

Not to be cute, but it is handy when you need the query string.

The original poster included an example of how this might be useful. He had
found some sample code that included an HTML form that posted data to itself.
The query string was appended to make sure no URL variables were lost.

You could use a seq# for each person. When inserting the record do a select
on max seq# to obtain the highest # used for that individual, increment that
#, insert the new record, then delete where seq# <= newnumber - x and person
= logged in person.

Hi all,

Can anyone point out what is wrong with this query:

DELETE FROM `nsr_staffips` WHERE `tech` LIKE 'Nasir' ORDER BY `timestamp`
LIMIT 1 

According to mySQL manual it should delete the oldest entry ordered by the
timestamp filed.

Why don't you re-write the cookie with the new ID at this point ?

Hi All,

I'm looking for the best way to store non-critical frequently updated data
that needs to be shared across all php processes (on a single server).
Please notice I say frequently updated. If I'm just storing something that
only changes once every N requests (where N is a large number) then I'd just
use the file system since the OS caches that anyways.

For example, lets say I wanted to have a page counter on every page.
Ideally, I'd just have a variable which is read/write by any php process on
the server. Something like this:

$my_super_global ++;
print "this is page view $my_super_global";

One way is to use the file system.
This or course is pretty simple, but since the file needs to be updated
every single request, I'm thinking it would be faster to use memory.

Has anyone done anything like this ?

Does anyone know of any existing or built in packages can I use ?

thanx
ophir

PEAR Cache has support for an msession container. That might do the trick.

Subject: installing PHP extensions
Message-ID: <5A2A135C-5642-11D7-90FE-00039344DCA8@nyu.edu>

Here I am again with the naive newbie questions:)

When I come across a PHP extension that I would like to use do I always 
have to reconfigure PHP?

I want to use some PHP XSLT functions on either my Red Hat Linux or 
MacOSX box:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.xslt.php

and the install instructions say to run configure with such and such 
options.

If I do this, do I have to include all the other options for other 
extensions and settings? Will all the configure options be reset if I 
only run configure with the options of installing the XSLT extension?

I guess I just want to know what is the easiest way to install an 
extension without messing up the PHP installation I have already.

Thanks a lot!

MZ

AFAIK, you need to recompile. One way to find out what options your 
current php was compiled with is to check the output of a phpinfo() call 
-- it includes the Configure Command that was used for the last compile.

If you have been using RPMs, this might seem like a big step as you'll 
need to recompile Apache from source as well. The learning curve is well 
worth it, however.

Thanks Chris,

I figured that was the case. And iIshould learn this anyway. I can just 
mess around with it on a development box and not worry about breaking 
anything.

So if the install instructions for the XSLT extensions say:

On UNIX, run configure with the --enable-xslt --with-xslt-sablot options

I don't want to choose ONLY those options, right? I should read up in 
the manual and make sure I choose all the appropriate options for other 
extensions like MySQL etc., yes? I am guessing when I reconfigure I am 
starting from scratch and not just "adding" an extension.

Try this: create a script called test.php and call it from your web browser:

<?php
    phpinfo();
?>

 From that you can get all the options that php is currently compiled 
with, to which you may add --enable-xslt, etc.

Not that you shouldn't read up on the other options-- you might find 
that you are currently using some unnecessary ones.

What is the cleanest way to install php,

I know I do have to add a
LoadModule php_module libexec/libphp4.so
AddType application /x-httpd-php .php

Syntax error on line 253 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Can't locate API module structure `php_module' in file 
/usr/lib/apache/libphp4.so: /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd: undefined symbol: 
php_module
./apachectl start: httpd could not be started

This is the message I get..
Without these lines I get the code on the webpage. I also tried module as 
DSO and another time I compiled with Module Static but with DSO support.

These are the compiled-in modules. Please let me know what could I do next?

Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_status.c
  mod_include.c
  mod_autoindex.c
  mod_dir.c
  mod_cgi.c
  mod_asis.c
  mod_imap.c
  mod_actions.c
  mod_userdir.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_so.c
  mod_setenvif.c
  mod_auth_cookie_file.c
  mod_monitor.c
  mod_php4.c


In either case it doesn't seem to work

Admittedly, I was moving too fast and gave a flip answer.  Seemed like 
Emmanuel was unfamilliar with locking, so threw that lead to him.

Also, from the way your suggestion was written, I initially thought you 
were going to do the deletes based on the initail select in step 1.  I now
believe that's not what you really meant.

Finally, after step 2, there are more than ten records in the table.  
Emmanuel hasn't completely elaborated exactly what's going on here, so I
don't know how sentsitive the whole thing is.  Of course, this likely
wouldn't be a problem if using your excellent suggestion of getting only
the last ten records when doing selects, presumably via the LIMIT clause,

Enjoy,

Yeah, N would have to be very large IMO to beat out kernel caching.

Basically it looks like you need application variables.  The best way to do
this is probably with shared memory and semaphores if available.  Although
PHP's extension falls short abit in some area for this, I've written a couple
classes that have worked well for me:

http://parsec.nyphp.org/pVar.inc
http://parsec.nyphp.org/pApp.psh

pVar is the main class, with pApp being a shell script to create and manage a
particular application.  It's a bit rough, and you could probably just get
away with pVar.inc.  You're welcome to rip/hack any of that code as needed
and let me know if you run into any questions.

Best,

H

Yeah, you'll need to specify all other configure options.  For some
extensions, I think you could do something like:

./configure --enable-xslt --with-xslt-sablot=shared,/path/to/sablot

then dl() the shared object file.  However, I'm not sure how well this is
supported, and I think it's generally recommended to compile PHP with the
extensions you want from the start.

Hi All,

I'm looking for the best way to store non-critical frequently updated data
that needs to be shared across all php processes (on a single server).
Please notice I say frequently updated. If I'm just storing something that
only changes once every N requests (where N is a large number) then I'd just
use the file system since the OS caches that anyways.

For example, lets say I wanted to have a page counter on every page.
Ideally, I'd just have a variable which is read/write by any php process on
the server. Something like this:

$my_super_global ++;
print "this is page view $my_super_global";

One way is to use the file system.
This or course is pretty simple, but since the file needs to be updated
every single request, I'm thinking it would be faster to use memory.

Has anyone done anything like this ?

Does anyone know of any existing or built in packages can I use ?

thanx
ophir

This will bind your web application to a single physical web server 
though.  For fluffy stuff that doesn't really matter all that much, like a 
page counter, I'd serve the count from a static cache, refreshing it every 
X hours from an asynchronous script.  In fact, I might have the script do 
that via an access log scan rather than having the web server update the 
database at every page load.

mod_perl has Apache::Storable for maintaining serialized, persistent data 
across connections.  There's a freshmeat knock-off of Storable for PHP but 
it sounds like it uses disk storage while I believe that Apache::Storable 
freezes structures in memory and writes them to disk on request:

Yes, the older versions support OpenBSD.  Unfortunately, those Optimizers
do not support the newer versions of the Zend Encoder.

Does anyone know anything about a new Optimizer for OpenBSD?  or maybe how
to hack the FreeBSD version into submission?

Subject: PHP/MySQL based solution for sending bulk email?
In-Reply-To: <200303121831.h2CIU8N9001866@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <E394EB79-58DB-11D7-8E1B-003065481BD8@soler.com>

I have an opt-in email list of about 200,000 people.  I'm wondering if 
anyone knows of a shareware or commercial PHP/MySQL based solution for 
sending out bulk email.  It would have to have the following features:
- Allow the creation of multiple mailing lists by duplicating existing 
mailing lists and also copying one mailing list to an existing.
- Must be able to remove duplicates in each individual mailing list.
- Force mailings to be associated with only one mailing list at a time.
- Allow for optional demographics fields on the Opt-In form.
- Handle Opt-Out / Opt-In requests for each individual email list.
- Handle HTML email with optional plain text for non-html email clients.
- Monitor statistics for every delivered email that is viewed and the 
link clicked through to.
- Provide a way for clients to view the live statistics of their 
particular mailing online.

This solution can run on either a Windows 2000 box or a Mac OS X box, 
which ever is more convenient.  I know Mac OS X come with PHP and 
SendMail pre-installed being that it's really UNIX under the hood.

I'll be using a broad band connection so I need this solution to use 
the sendmail program (or equivalent) to send the mailings right from 
the box it's installed on.  This is to avoid having to rely on an ISP 
or Web-hosts mail server which will think I'm sending out spam and try 
and shut me down.

I hope this is clear and I hope some one knows of a solution out there 
that will do the job.  If there turns out to be none with these 
capabilities, I'm also interested in possibly hiring some one to build 
such a solution for me if the price is right.  All feed back is 
appreciated.

Thank you,
Steve Soler

If you want to do this in a professional manner, you may be better off
outsourcing to a company that does just this.  It's inexpensive and would
probably work the best.  Google for php bulking emailing or some variation
and look at the ads google comes up with on the right.

There are also some commercial products, but for 200,000 mails you'll need a
pretty fat bit pipe.

Thanks for the advice, but we are already outsourcing.  We want to 
handle this in house.  Can you let me know of any commercial products 
you may know of that are currently available.

Hi Steve,

I'm also currently outsourcing my humble 8,000 member list (and am looking
at other solutions).
Before going any further, may I ask why it has to be a PHP/MySQL solution ?

There are plenty of excellent free / commercial mailing list managers, but
not necessarily in PHP / MySQL.

it is not PHP/mySQL but I've used:

I guess it does not have to be PHP/MySQL, but it's just that I'm most confident
with this technologies stability.  Also, if it's PHP I think it may be easier to
add features in the future if need be.

Steve,

to send out 5000 emails using a solution you describe below on a shared 
hosting server would take 1/2 hour, to an hour with noticable server 
lag.. If you have developers on staff.. Go for it do it in house... get 
a server from rackspace.com, or dialtone.com ($150 bucks a month or so) 
or something similar.. developers getting at least $150 dollars a day.. 
it would not take long to get up and running, three months at a maximum 
..  but if you do not have developers already on staff I'd say give the 
responsibilty to some one else, and if they are failing find another 
company to do it for you..

In doing mass mailing (SPAM) there are a lot of concerns to keep in 
mind, RBL database, MAPS.. network up time.. HACKERS who don't like you 
sending out so much email.. the more 'popular' your ip, the more you 
have to be concerned about security.. though the managed hosting 
solutions mentioned above can help you with such duties..

So maybe you can do it semi in house.. Meaning you go with a managed 
hosting service provider, pay the extra fees for security and backup, 
and extra band width, and setup but develop the php/POSTGRES or MYSQL 4 
solution your selves.. thing is.. its kinda difficult to test for 
200,000 emails, this is why going with some one how specializes in mass 
mailing would be a good idea.. maybe you could host the front end.. 
then send a mass mailing company the list.. and say send these people 
email.. but you could maintain the list of people, and sell their 
addresses to as many people as you want.

I would not do it if you do not have developers weather contract or 
full time. When something breaks, it is best to not learn how to 
program at that time.

Anyways, those are my thoughts..

I guess it does not have to be PHP/MySQL, but it's just that I'm most confident
with this technologies stability.  Also, if it's PHP I think it may be easier to
add features in the future if need be.

Hey Steve,

With your list of required features and the need for something that is truly
automated (200k addresses) I'd go with something commercial. Obviously there
must be a budget for this since you're currently outsourcing it. There are
still a lot of variables like how many emails per month sent, avg size of
email, how people subscribe / unsubscribe, more detail about the features
you need, etc.

You can find a pretty good list of software at:
http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Internet/Servers/Mail/Lis
t_Management/

I've used Lyris myself and only have good things to say about it. Not cheap,
but you get what you pay for.

As mentioned before, you might want to consider getting a managed server
(like a rackshack $100 a month machine).

I'd be more than happy to continue discussing this off list.

Opt-out functionality aside, any decent mail server and a reasonably fast 
connection should be able to handle 200,000 outbound mails a day 
easily.  Stick all the addresses in a protected alias and post a message to 
it.  The mail server will do the rest.  This is essentially what I do with 
my topical mailing lists which, all totaled, is 8,000 20k+ boilerplate 
digests/day over a lowly residential DSL line.

Bulk emailers are mainly useful when you have multiple outbound mail 
servers and/or templated email and/or huge lists to support.  It's really 
more about your available bandwidth and tuning your mail server than need a 
front-end to an MTA, at least as far as message delivery is 
concerned.  Qmail brags that a single instance can handle 1 million 
outbound messages/day.  Postfix can probably do likewise.

Hello,

I'm looking for a good PHP wiki, but a Perl wiki is ok too (if 
mod_perl is not required). What I'm looking for is a wiki that is 
easily hackable, so the code have to be modular and clean. Ideally, 
I'd like this wiki to generate a RSS feed. And if this wiki can 
interface to MySQL, it will even be a better choice for me.

TIA

I've been using twiki for over a year (www.twiki.org).
Perl based - no need for mod_perl.
I'm VERY happy with it.
It's loaded with features and is very extendable.
I've looked at php based wiki's in the past, but nothing comes close to
twiki in feature set.

You should give it a spin.

I've been messing around with phpwiki which is available on sourceforge.  I
don't know that it is the best, and I haven't had the time to work with it
enough to know if it meets your other reqs, but you may want to check it
out.

Tiki is very popular (look for it on SourceForge.net).  I played with it 
a bit but decided that all its various features, templating engine, etc. 
were overkill for my purposes, and simply opted to write my own.

Hi,
i have a script which works with integers. i am taking the inputs from a form and now it defaults to string. a var_dump gives :

INPUTS : 
array(2) {
  [0]=>
  array(2) {
    [0]=>
    string(1) "0"
    [1]=>
    string(1) "1"
  }
  [1]=>
  array(2) {
    [0]=>
    string(1) "1"
    [1]=>
    string(1) "1"
  }
}

but i need the values to be ints....

i tried :

foreach ($pieces as $k => $v) {
 $$k = $v;
 echo $k ."=". $v ."<br>";
//var_dump ($v);
 $cast = is_array ($v);
 if ($cast) {
  foreach ($v as $key => $val) {
   $$key = $val;
   echo $key ."=". $val ."<br>";

   $chk = is_int($val);
   echo "variable type : $chk <br>";
   if (!$chk) settype ($val,"integer");
  }
 }
}

but still i am not able to type juggle. i have missed something but i am unable to find out what. can someone plz identify what it is?
is there a better way, i am not sure i am coding in the right way...

also, i have two arrays, i want to merge them as :
new[0] = array1[0], array2[0], array2[1]
new[1] = array1[1], array2[1], array2[1]

how to do this, i am again not getting the results like expected.

Tracy,
Use intval() to get the integer value of a variable:

    $str = '22';
    // is_int($str) == false;

    $int = intval($str);
    // is_int($int) == true;

Hello,

I use Wiki Tiki Tavi at my www.moztips.com/wiki site. Tavi is available at:
http://tavi.sourceforge.net/WikkiTikkiTavi . It is PHP based, and was pretty easy to install.

I did not try to customize it that much, because I needed a Wiki that "just worked". It seems to have worked okay so far ...

Best Regards,

Subject: PHP sessions on IE Mac
Message-ID: <5365136.1048177702071.JavaMail.nobody@beaker.psp.pas.earthlink.net>

I can make a web session expire by using some php's session_destroy() function.  The purpose of this is so that if you log out and then you hit the BACK button, you will not be able to see previous data.  This works great on the PC with IE, MOZILLA, NETSCAPE.

When in the Mac World,  MOZILLA and NETSCAPE handled this the correct way, but IE and Safari still show you the previous data.

I try unset to remove session variables but still I am able to see the data on IE and Safari on the Mac.

The actual php site is located on an W2K platform.

The IE on Mac is IE 5.2 for the Mac

Any ideas on how to stop the data from displaying on IE Mac?

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

I can speculate as to where this discrepancy comes from, and it has little to
do with what you are doing and much to do with how the HTTP specification is
interpreted. If you will look at section 13.13 of RFC 2616
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt), you will see the following statement:

"In particular history mechanisms SHOULD NOT try to show a semantically
transparent view of the current state of a resource. Rather, a history
mechanism is meant to show exactly what the user saw at the time when the
resource was retrieved."

Based on this, it is my opinion that IE and Safari on Mac are handling this
correctly. For any who are familiar with lynx, this has always been the case -
the back button shows you what you saw on the previous page rather than the
current state of that resource.

Most Web sites I have used where the information is considered extremely
sensitive state something like this upon logout:

"You have now been successfully logged out of the system. It is recommended
that you now close your browser to prevent access to any cached content."

Now, there is another bit of the specification that I believe causes the
discrepancy, because it seemingly conflicts with the above statement. In
section 14.9.2, the no-store directive of the Cache-Control header is
explained:

"If sent in a request, a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this request
or any response to it. If sent in a response, a cache MUST NOT store any part
of either this response or the request that elicited it."

You would have to check, but I would guess that this directive is used in your
application. My opinion is that the history mechanism in a browser is an
example of a non-shared cache and is exempt based on section 13.13. I think
other people's opinions vary in this regard, and I think this is the reason for
the discrepancies.

Did you try using PHP's cache control directive: session.cache_limiter =
noncache ?

This would set a global cache control policy, but you could be page specific
and use session_cache_limiter(nocache) if you don't want to set it at the
directive level.

Not sure it will work, but it's worth a shot.

I can make a web session expire by using some php's session_destroy()
function.  The purpose of this is so that if you log out and then you hit
the BACK button, you will not be able to see previous data.  This works
great on the PC with IE, MOZILLA, NETSCAPE.

When in the Mac World,  MOZILLA and NETSCAPE handled this the correct way,
but IE and Safari still show you the previous data.

I try unset to remove session variables but still I am able to see the data
on IE and Safari on the Mac.

The actual php site is located on an W2K platform.

The IE on Mac is IE 5.2 for the Mac

Any ideas on how to stop the data from displaying on IE Mac?

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

Did you try using PHP's cache control directive: session.cache_limiter =
noncache ?

This would set a global cache control policy, but you could be page
specific
and use session_cache_limiter(nocache) if you don't want to set it at the
directive level.

Not sure it will work, but it's worth a shot.

Pardon me for yet another quick answer, but why do you need them as 
integers?  PHP automatically converts variables' data types as needed for 
the purpose at hand.  For example:

    $one = '1';
    $two = '2';
    echo "$one + $two = " . ($one + $two);

Hi.

        Does anyone know what the _( construct (or is it an operator?)

It doesn't appear to do anything except look suspicious.  Thanks

First, anything from a form is always a string, because there isn't anything 
that is past to your php script that says it is any other type.  Second, you 
can use "array_merge.

Hi,
i have a script which works with integers. i am taking the inputs from a 
form and now it defaults to string. a var_dump gives :

INPUTS :
array(2) {
   [0]=>
   array(2) {
     [0]=>
     string(1) "0"
     [1]=>
     string(1) "1"
   }
   [1]=>
   array(2) {
     [0]=>
     string(1) "1"
     [1]=>
     string(1) "1"
   }
}

but i need the values to be ints....

i tried :

foreach ($pieces as $k => $v) {
  $$k = $v;
  echo $k ."=". $v ."<br>";
//var_dump ($v);
  $cast = is_array ($v);
  if ($cast) {
   foreach ($v as $key => $val) {
    $$key = $val;
    echo $key ."=". $val ."<br>";

    $chk = is_int($val);
    echo "variable type : $chk <br>";
    if (!$chk) settype ($val,"integer");
   }
  }
}

but still i am not able to type juggle. i have missed something but i am 
unable to find out what. can someone plz identify what it is?
is there a better way, i am not sure i am coding in the right way...

also, i have two arrays, i want to merge them as :
new[0] = array1[0], array2[0], array2[1]
new[1] = array1[1], array2[1], array2[1]

how to do this, i am again not getting the results like expected.

Thz
Tracy

"anything from a form is always a string"

That's not totally true...

Try this out:

<?php

function displayArray($array) {

	echo '<table width="500" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">';

	foreach ($array as $key => $value) {

		echo '<tr><td width="25%"><b>' . $key . '</b></td><td width="75%">' .
$value . '</td></tr>';

	}

	echo '</table>';

	return;

}

	if ($_POST['action'] == 'process') {

		displayArray($_POST);

	} else {

?>

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">

<html>
<head>
	<title>Untitled</title>
</head>

<body>

<form method="post">

<input type="hidden" name="action" value="process">

<input type="text" name="name[first_name]" size="20">

<input type="submit">

</form>

</body>
</html>

<?php

	}

?>

The variable 'name' in the form is now an array.

you'll want to use a pre-existing solution, like Benchmark_Timer, or use

Subject: RegEx vs. SAX
Message-ID: <005a01c2eff9$3ecccea0$e1951d18@enobrev>

Hello all,
 
I have a php based socket / xml chat server that I'm using to serve a
flash based frontend using flash's xml_sockets.  All the major goods are
done, and working well.  My dilemma is the xml parsing on the server
side.  Basically, all messages and commands are sent to the server in
xml form.  So a new message looks like:
 
<message member_id="1" room_id="44">The message Text</message>
 
or keypress:
 
<key member_id="1" room_id="44" on ="1" />
 
<key member_id="1" room_id="44" on ="0" />
 
You get the idea.
 
Anyways, currently, I have each command that comes into the server
running through a switch, which does a preg_match like this:
 
switch( true ) {
                        case preg_match('/<message member _id="(.*)"
room_id="(.*)">(.*)<\\/message>/', $message, $attributes) :
                                                
                                    $this->message( $client_id,
$attributes[1], $attributes[2], $attributes[3] );
                                    break;
                                                            
                        case preg_match('/<key member _id="(.*)"
room_id="(.*)" on="(.*)" \\/>/', $message, $attributes) :
                                                            
                                    $this->key_pressed( $client_id,
$attributes[1], $attributes[2], $attributes[3] );
                                    break;
            }
 
These run the correct functions which do any database stuff required and
then broadcasts the message, etc to the correct clients.
 
Now, my question is, would it be less resource intensive to use php's
inherent xml functions to parse the incoming commands or should regex be
the faster of the two.  I don't mind doing speed tests and such to find
out, but before I jump into the testing, I had hoped someone here might
have an idea.
 
Thanks!!!

Message-ID: <MDEEKNJKNHIOEMCBFJABOECPCCAA.rudy@taytek.com>

I built a web application several years ago that is still very much alive
and well now.  My server environment has always been Linux, Apache,MySQL,
and PHP.  I just recently install PHP and MySQL on a Windows 2000 server
running IIS.  After moving some code over I discovered the PHP.ini file and
its use of the register_globals flag.  I now realize that I have created
considerable code that relies on this flag being on.  My concern is about
the security exposure with globals on.

I have relied on the globals in two areas, Session variables and Post data
from forms.  With session variables I used session_register, and with Post
data I simply expected to have PHP make the variables available to me
without having to step through the $HTTP_POST_VARS array.

For me to migrate the Session variables to $_SESSION['element'] would be
work, but doable.  To handle all the Post vars is another story.

Has anyone else been faced with this issue and if so how did you address it.

Thanks,
Rudy

The easiest way to do what you want is to include the following code at the 
top of programs:

<?php if (!empty($_POST)) extract($_POST); ?>

Sorry for the miss info.  What I meant to say is that, there is only one 
elementary type.  This is always text (String if you will).  Since I used to 
do C/C++ with CGI.  String is what I call it.  Also the C/C++ does not have 
String or Array Type.  We just used char type. :-)  Maybe it is just a 
little too much detail (Maybe even useless in term of programming in PHP)

"anything from a form is always a string"

That's not totally true...

Try this out:

<?php

function displayArray($array) {

	echo '<table width="500" border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">';

	foreach ($array as $key => $value) {

		echo '<tr><td width="25%"><b>' . $key . '</b></td><td width="75%">' .
$value . '</td></tr>';

	}

	echo '</table>';

	return;

}

	if ($_POST['action'] == 'process') {

		displayArray($_POST);

	} else {

?>

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">

<html>
<head>
	<title>Untitled</title>
</head>

<body>

<form method="post">

<input type="hidden" name="action" value="process">

<input type="text" name="name[first_name]" size="20">

<input type="submit">

</form>

</body>
</html>

<?php

	}

?>

The variable 'name' in the form is now an array.

First, anything from a form is always a string, because there isn't anything
that is past to your php script that says it is any other type.  Second, you
can use "array_merge.

Hi,
i have a script which works with integers. i am taking the inputs from a
form and now it defaults to string. a var_dump gives :

INPUTS :
array(2) {
    [0]=>
    array(2) {
      [0]=>
      string(1) "0"
      [1]=>
      string(1) "1"
    }
    [1]=>
    array(2) {
      [0]=>
      string(1) "1"
      [1]=>
      string(1) "1"
    }
}

but i need the values to be ints....

i tried :

foreach ($pieces as $k => $v) {
   $$k = $v;
   echo $k ."=". $v ."<br>";
//var_dump ($v);
   $cast = is_array ($v);
   if ($cast) {
    foreach ($v as $key => $val) {
     $$key = $val;
     echo $key ."=". $val ."<br>";

     $chk = is_int($val);
     echo "variable type : $chk <br>";
     if (!$chk) settype ($val,"integer");
    }
   }
}

but still i am not able to type juggle. i have missed something but i am
unable to find out what. can someone plz identify what it is?
is there a better way, i am not sure i am coding in the right way...

also, i have two arrays, i want to merge them as :
new[0] = array1[0], array2[0], array2[1]
new[1] = array1[1], array2[1], array2[1]

how to do this, i am again not getting the results like expected.

Thz
Tracy

Deidra,
I've used a few different solutions, but I'd recommend LinkPoint.  They have
a secure API and a nice PHP wrapper class.  Tony Shap is a pretty technical
sales rep there. Call him at 800-456-5989 ext.5042.  If you decide to go
with them, please mention NEW AGE WEB MEDIA (store # 580549).  I should get
a couple of bucks for referring you.

Don't mean to be nitpicky, but C++ does have a string class.  Just
#include <string>.  Maybe knowing this will help you write better C++.

Subject: Insert 1.8 million rows of data
Message-ID: <14920f14755c.14755c14920f@optonline.net>

Here's an interesting problem. Hopefully someone has a solution.

I have a text file of 1.8 million rows of data. I parse each row, dynamically generate an "INSERT" statement, then execute the query. Well, it doesn't work because PHP/MySQL chokes on it. I've set the timeout limit to zero and that solved the PHP issue but then MySQL gave me error 28 (essentially insufficient temp space on the drive) yet cleaning out files didn't solve the problem.

So...anyone encounter a similar problem like this?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Jeff

While string class is good.  For high performance, this should still be 
avoided ;-)

Don't mean to be nitpicky, but C++ does have a string class.  Just
#include <string>.  Maybe knowing this will help you write better C++.

Sorry about this, it is really a not PHP question. But you know
NYPHP is a great source to find out some answers, a lot of great
people here!

I try to build a dvr system on my computer, but my boss said to
buy 10 first alert DVR-800 DVR cards, so I try to find out who
makes first alert dvr card, is there a first alert distributor
in New York?

Sorry about this again, if you don't know, just delete this
Email!

Thanks Again!

Hi Jon,

The first thing that comes to mind is that your sessions are being saved to
files, and there is no writing permission to the defined session folder!
Check that out...

I've used http://www.itransact.com/ for several clients with no 
problems. They used to have excellent customer services (& I only say 
"used" to because I haven't needed to contact them in years). One of 
the things I like best about them (aside from the fact they are cheap) 
is that you can either gather all the secure info yourself or push the 
customer over to their site & let them deal with it.

Subject: Voting Program
Message-ID: <se7efaa8.041@mail.sussex.edu>

Hi All,

I'm looking for a program (PHP or Perl) that could handle a student Election at the College I work at. 

I have a Win server running PHP, Perl, MySQL & Apache.

I would like to validate a voter against the DB using a 7 number Student ID before the voting is allowed or this could also be done upon submission of the vote. Due to the fact that most students will vote while on campus I can not use IP logging to see if they have voted before. 

There would be 5 positions and approx. 2-5 candidates per position.

Does any one know of or previously used a program out there that might fit the bill or be modified?

Thank's,

Jessica Kelly

This might be overkill, but the SINAPSE project (http://www.sinapse.org) has
an elections module and is specifically tailored towards campus elections.

Hi,
below are few lines from a PASCAL code

PROCEDURE init;
 VAR i, n:integer;
 BEGIN
  FOR i:=1 TO numhidden DO
   BEGIN
    hiddenA[i]:=frandom(0.005, 0.2);
    FOR n:=1 TO numInput DO
     hiddenW[i, n]:=frandom(-0.1, 0.15);
   END;
  FOR i:=1 TO numOutput DO
   BEGIN
    FOR n:=1 TO numhidden DO
     outputW[i, n]:=frandom(-0.1, 0.15);
   END;
 END;  { init }

the problem is i know nothing about PASCAL and there isint an elaborate example on how to create a two-dimensional array. i am stuck at the line 
hiddenW[i, n]:=frandom(-0.1, 0.15);

here's my version :
function init() {
 for ($i=1; $i<=numhidden; $i++) {
  $hiddenA[$i]=frandom(0.005, 0.2);
  for ($n=1; $n<=numInput; $n++) {
   $hiddenW = array ($i => array ($n => frandom(-0.1, 0.15)));
   print("<pre>");
   print_r($hiddenW);
   print("</pre>");
  } 
 }
 print("<pre>");
 print_r($hiddenA);
 print("</pre>");
 print_r($hiddenW);
 for ($i=1; $i<=$numOutput; $i++) {
  for ($n=1; $n<=numhidden; $n++) {
   //$outputW[$i, $n]=frandom(-0.1, 0.15);
  }
 }
} // { init }
it seems to dump values... i am unsure if its right. 
i need the values elsewhere...
for ($i=1; $i<=numhidden; $i++) {
 $sum2=0;
 for ($j=1; $j<=numInput; $j++) {
  $sum2=$sum2 + $hiddenW[$i, $j] * $inputA[$j]; //at this point i am totally blank
  echo $sum2;
  $hiddenN[$i]=$sum2;
  $hiddenA[$i]=sigmoid($sum2);
 }
}
has someone done this sort of programming before. there sure must be a better way to code this procedure out. plz help

Multi dimensional arrays work ok in php:

instead of
> $hiddenW = array ($i => array ($n => frandom(-0.1, 0.15)));

you can use,
$hiddenW[$i][$n] = frandom(-0.1, 0.15);

The first part of code generates 2 matrices with random values. The second
one
calculates in $hiddenN the matrix product of hiddenW and inputA, and
applies the
calculates the sigmoid transform on that product (stored in hiddenA).
(for anybody remembering lineal algebra, this is just a matrix
multiplication)


You should get a numImput-fold performance improve by rewriting this:

for ($i=1; $i<=numhidden; $i++) {
 $sum2=0;
 for ($j=1; $j<=numInput; $j++) {
   // store in temp variable $sum2 the vector product (dot product)
   // of vectors  $hiddenW[$i] and $inputA
  $sum2 += $hiddenW[$i][$j] * $inputA[$j];
 }
  $hiddenN[$i]=$sum2;
  $hiddenA[$i]=sigmoid($sum2);
}

How is the parking situation around Digital Pulp, Inc.
220 East 23rd Street?

It's such a nice day. I'm thinking of driving into the city
rather than taking the train, but if there is no parking on the street
until 7pm, then I would rather take the train.

Anyone tried the card deck contest? I was going through it and didn't
exactly understand how the SHUFFLE function works, i.e. what is it supposed
to do. Is it supposed to be random (somehow), or a pattern needs to be
achieved?

Multi dimensional arrays work ok in php:

you can use,
$hiddenW[$i][$n] = frandom(-0.1, 0.15);

The first part of code generates 2 matrices with random values. The second
one
calculates in $hiddenN the matrix product of hiddenW and inputA, and
applies the
calculates the sigmoid transform on that product (stored in hiddenA).
(for anybody remembering lineal algebra, this is just a matrix
multiplication)


You should get a numImput-fold performance improve by rewriting this:

for ($i=1; $i<=numhidden; $i++) {
$sum2=0;
for ($j=1; $j<=numInput; $j++) {
// store in temp variable $sum2 the vector product (dot product)
// of vectors $hiddenW[$i] and $inputA
$sum2 += $hiddenW[$i][$j] * $inputA[$j];
}
$hiddenN[$i]=$sum2;
$hiddenA[$i]=sigmoid($sum2);
}

Hi,
below are few lines from a PASCAL code

PROCEDURE init;
VAR i, n:integer;
BEGIN
FOR i:=1 TO numhidden DO
BEGIN
hiddenA[i]:=frandom(0.005, 0.2);
FOR n:=1 TO numInput DO
hiddenW[i, n]:=frandom(-0.1, 0.15);
END;
FOR i:=1 TO numOutput DO
BEGIN
FOR n:=1 TO numhidden DO
outputW[i, n]:=frandom(-0.1, 0.15);
END;
END; { init }

the problem is i know nothing about PASCAL and there isint an elaborate
example on how to create a two-dimensional array. i am stuck at the line
hiddenW[i, n]:=frandom(-0.1, 0.15);

here's my version :
function init() {
for ($i=1; $i<=numhidden; $i++) {
$hiddenA[$i]=frandom(0.005, 0.2);
for ($n=1; $n<=numInput; $n++) {
$hiddenW = array ($i => array ($n => frandom(-0.1, 0.15)));
print("
");
   print_r($hiddenW);
   print("
");
}
}
print("
");
 print_r($hiddenA);
 print("
");
print_r($hiddenW);
for ($i=1; $i<=$numOutput; $i++) {
for ($n=1; $n<=numhidden; $n++) {
//$outputW[$i, $n]=frandom(-0.1, 0.15);
}
}
} // { init }
it seems to dump values... i am unsure if its right.
i need the values elsewhere...
for ($i=1; $i<=numhidden; $i++) {
$sum2=0;
for ($j=1; $j<=numInput; $j++) {
$sum2=$sum2 + $hiddenW[$i, $j] * $inputA[$j]; //at this point i am
totally blank
echo $sum2;
$hiddenN[$i]=$sum2;
$hiddenA[$i]=sigmoid($sum2);
}
}
has someone done this sort of programming before. there sure must be a
better way to code this procedure out. plz help

Hi,
how to u ask php not to cache inherently the scripts. while using benchmark, i am getting results that i am not content with. the first run is gud, but from the 2nd run onwards, the time falls drastically. is this because, php caches the state? 
how to go aroung this problem? 
in one of the scripts, i set:
ini_set("max_execution_time", 0.00300); but i get 
Array
(
    [1] => 0.003064
    
    [5] => 0.003456
   
    [8] => 0.003570
    
    [mean] => 0.003041
    [iterations] => 10
)

i also tried with : set_time_limit (".0001"); but again the script doesnt time out..
Where am i wrong?
Tracy

Good morning,

First, thanks to Sterling Hughes and everyone who came out last night.  We're
sorry it's always so crowded, but we're looking for ways to remedy this in
the future.  Nevertheless, apologies to those who came and found
standing-room only.

New York PHP is working on putting another box online to support our
community's development and rapid growth.  Most aspects of putting the box
online are complete, however we are accepting some hardware.  If anyone has
spare hardware they'd like to donate, or is aware of discounted hardware,
we'd welcome any of the following:


-- CD-ROM (any IDE based drive will do)
-- SCSI Controller Card ( >=Ultra160 )
-- Hard drives
   -- Modern IDE  ( >=60gb and >=Ultra DMA 100 )
   -- Modern SCSI ( >=18gb )
-- Modern 10/100 Ethernet card (Intel preferred)
-- 184-pin DDR DIMM

If you can help out in any way, please contact me, hans at nyphp.org.  And if
you have any other stuff laying around that you think may be useful, feel
free to contact me as well (like a RAID controller laying around :)

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you everyone,

The day is upon us!  The first meeting of the Long Island PHP Users Group
will be tonight, in Hauppauge at 7pm!

Tonight's topics (not necessarily in this order):
Club business
	site development
	promotion
	creating a charter
	open source projects?
	other issues

An overview of PHP, and an install on Linux, if anyone is interested.  If
people would rather hear something more technical (depending on the
turnout), I can also give an overview of the ezPDF PHP library, which I've
been using lately (it is pretty cool, and doesn't require any options to be
compiled in.)

This is the first meeting, so if you are new to PHP or would just like to
hear what it is about, please come!  Also, experienced PHP developers are
also encouraged to attend!

** Refreshments will be served! **

The address:

Desktop Solutions Software, Inc.
700 Veterans Highway
Hauppauge, NY 11788

Directions:

>From the Northern State (recommended from points west)

Take the Northern State to the endpoint (becomes 347/454)
Pass the state office buildings on your right
The road forks - bear right to continue on route 454 (Veterans Highway)
The next intersection after that fork is Route 111 (Sears Hardware). You can
see our glass building from this intersection.
Enter our office complex on the right - 'Woodlands Park'
Locate Building 700, the largest building, on your right
Take elevator to lower level.


>From the Long Island Expressway:

Take LIE to exit 57, and go north on Veterans Memorial Highway.
Travel north approx. 2 miles, past schoolyard on right.
Make U-Turn at the red light at the route 111 intersection
Enter our office complex which will now be on your right - 'Woodlands Park'
Locate Building 700, the largest building, on your right as you enter the
parking lot.
Take elevator to lower level.

does anyone know if/how I could cache a frameset, so that when the frameset
displays all of the pages inside it display at once as opposed to one page
within the frameset loading up at a different pace than the other pages.

I have a couple of embedded framesets (unavoidable, I'm afraid) with php
inside.  And the pages load in a very ugly fashion (sometimes there can even
be a lag so one page doesn't load till much later than the others).  I only
need it to display all at once at the index page.

It's in a hosted environment, so I don't have much control over the server.
:(

Is it possible???

Thanks, Chris

Don't know for certain, but I think it is mostly a matter of how a particular browser handles frames, and of course the speed of the users Internet connection.  Not sure if you can cache the pages for the frameset.

Hey Folks:

Pardon the slightly tangential post...

Before I get into it, thanks to Sterling for the good overview of what's 
coming in PHP 5.  It was nice hanging with folks after the meeting as 
well.

For all the bicyclists on the list, uh, I assume there are a few others 
beside myself, I'm writing to let you know about BikeSummer.  It's a month 
long festival of bike culture, such as rides, exhibits, shows, readings, 
conferences, etc.  Each year it takes place in a different city.

Okay, here are the tie ins:
   It's in NYC this year.
   The site uses PHP.
   I'm the webmaster.

So, check it out: http://www.bikesummer.org/2003/

Enjoy,

Framesets are a function of the browser, not the server. The server 
just serves up pages so it doesn't know that one page is related to 
another. When the browser notices a frameset page, it requests other 
pages from the server. So aside from the standard caching mechanisms, 
there is not much you can do.

However, you may try using iframes instead. I like the way iframes work 
far better than framesets. But until recently browsers handled iframes 
differently, so you have to know your audience. Your pages still won't 
load instantly, but your main page with display first.

The only way I can think of displaying everything immediately is to use 
Javascript on the client side to build the pages. All your page code 
would be present in one page and you would use document.write() to 
build the content of your frames.

Hi Tracy,

I believe the problem lies in that the max_execution_time value is expected to
be an integer, and the argument to set_time_limit is an integer.  Your values
are most likely becoming 0, effectively unsetting the time limit.

Regards,
Andrew

It hurts my brain to think about implementing this, but would it be 
possible to put style="visibility: hidden;" attributes in the body tags 
of all the pages, and then call a javascript function to set them all to 
visible when the frames have loaded?

Does anyone know if the frameset element has an onload event?

Of course, then you run the risk of broken/missing javascript 
implementations and your content remaining invisible....

Hi,
i have a small problem in charting in Excel 2000. sorry for posting it here but i hope some one has used it to consolidate their work....

i have 4 columns of data, ( all are numbers). i need to set col2 n 3 as y axes and col 4 as the secondary axis as its on a diff scale. but i am not able to set the secondary axis option. i followed the instructions i found in "Excel 2002: The complete reerence"(pg:313) which are as under:
<pre>
To get sec axis, take these steps:
1. Ensure that the values in col A are text not nums.
2. Select thedata on the worksheet. (select A1:C10)
3. Use chart wizard to create a column chart.
4. If u can see the sec dta series on the chart, select it by clicking.
5. choose Chart | Chart type. Set the selected data series to a line chart type. click ok
6. Select the sec data series again. Choose Format | Selected data series
7. on  the axis tab, select sec Axis
8. Click OK.
</pre>
Step 1 ok. i change the format of the cells to text... but from step4 onwards, i am left out cos i can *see* any such thing as described. i have Excel 2000, does any one use 2002? if so can u plz check if the foll data from the book works so that i can conclude that 2000 doesnt support the feature? or if 2000 does, then how do i make use of it? this test data (shown in the book) doesnt work either, leave alone "my" data...
<pre>
Year | Housing Starts | Median price
1994 |                 440 | $ 70,210   (this is the format, col1 is text, 2 is right aligned so must be either general or integer not mentioned explicitly, n 3 is curreny formatted)
1995 | 336 | 70932
1996 | 229 | 71251
1997 | 215 | 86232
1998 | 335 | 88303
1999 | 265 | 95120
2000 | 296 | 102331
2001 | 357 | 115687
2002 | 345 | 133224
</pre>

Apologies again,
Tracy

The libwww-perl library should help you out.  In Debian at least, it 
includes /usr/bin/lwp-request , a command-line interface for all your 
GET, HEAD, POST and PUT needs.

I haven't done it, but I have read in the past that you can do something
like:

cat file_with_vars.txt | lynx http://mysite/myscript.php -post_data

with the vars in the file in key value pairs like:

name=foobar
address=123 street
city=mycity

etc.

Can anyone confirm this?

Good Luck!

Apparently not true of GNU wget. :-(

There is no provision for post requests that I can find in the man page 
or --help listing.

Yeah I just realized it was an applied patch that didn't make it into the
release it seems ...

http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/409/2001/5/0/5663784/

Just wondering why you wouldn't just use a PHP stream to do it:

(See example # 2 and change ssl to http) ...

This is true, it works. Unfortunately it cuts off the request when it 
sees ----, which makes it unsuitable for my purpose (which is to pass a 
multi-part email to php for parsing).

I'll look into p5-libwww as Michael Sims suggested.

Maybe a more specific question to ask is how do *you* email-enable your 
PHP web apps?

I was planning on using procmail to pass the entire message to PHP via 
post. Am I barking mad? I suppose I could use imap functions and a 
crontab to check a mailbox every few minutes and process new messages, 
but that sounds more complicated and storage intensive.

Thanks for all your suggestions!

Don't know for certain, but I think it is mostly a matter of how a 
particular browser handles frames, and of course the speed of the users 
Internet connection.  Not sure if you can cache the pages for the frameset.

Subject: php include file question
Message-ID: <1656.172.165.45.160.1049133173.squirrel@www.myhostingadmin.com>

List,

I'm breaking up my html site into includes (header, copyright, etc.).
Within the HTML documents that call the include files, I have the
appropriate php tags (i.e. <? include("copyright.html"); ?> . All of the
includes (i.e. copyright.html) are sitting in the same directory as my
html pages (i.e. index.html). PHP is installed.

So, why, no matter what I do, don't the include files parse into my
document? I have tried to changed the include extensions from .html to
.php to .inc. None parse. Most of my includes contain basic HTML (no php)
like <p>Copyright &copy; 2003. All Rights Reserved.</p>.

Am I doing something wrong? Or does my technician need to change something
in the server configuration (if so what)?

Thanks,
Deidra

Don't know about anyone else, I'm still new to this, but I name the html files ".php" and then for the include statement I use "include 'copyright.php';"  That is the only thing that worked for me.  You won't have to change anything in the current .html file other than the extension.

Hi Deidra,

You have to add the directory that contains the files you wish to include to
the php.ini file.
There is a section for paths and directories in there:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Paths and Directories ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; UNIX: "/path1:/path2"  
;include_path = ".:/php/includes"
;
; Windows: "\\path1;\\path2"
;include_path = ".;c:\\php\\includes;c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\"

Once you add the path, it should work.

Do your include files also have <? and ?> inside them? Maybe it's a dumb
statement. But <? in the file that is doing the including doesn't carry into
the included file.

I know that you can include any kind of file in PHP and it will be parsed so
long as there are <? ?> inside with executable PHP code. This is not the
same thing as apache dealing with the file. Because apache wont send .html
files to PHP (unless you've configured your apache to work that way).

You don't _HAVE_ to.

You DO have to if you have your include files in another location AND you
want to be able to say


include("mylib.php");

Otherwise, you have to do something along the lines of

include($GLOBALS['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/../include/mylib.php");

You should turn on error reporting to see what it says (if you get a blank
page) ...

You might also want to put "." before the file, i.e.

<script language="php">
    include("./file.php");
</script>

Or adjust your include_path in php.ini, i.e.

include_path = ".;c:\\php\\includes;c:\\php\\pear"

I don't think the extentions matter.  Make a info.php document with just 
<?php  phpinfo() ?> in it and check your include path.

I just noticed something strange. If I comment out my include directive in
php.ini, files in the same directory as the calling file are still included,
BUT stylesheets fail to be included. Basically, if I pull up a file that has
an include statement for another file, that other file's content is included
but the LINK tag is ignored for some reason. I don't understand why that
would happen. I am parsing through CSS and Javascript files, but it should
still work, shouldn't it?

That is weird, so your LINK is IN an included file? That is wierd. You would
think that the LINK doesn't happen until all the PHP is done executing...so
the LINK should happen the same regardless...however, if it's not happening,
and your INCLUDE file is in some location that, if it was executed directly
the LINK path would be wrong, then that would suggest that PHP behaves
differently depending on the way in which files are included (via include()
vs. php.ini).

Tis strange though.

You don't _HAVE_ to.

You DO have to if you have your include files in another location AND you
want to be able to say


include("mylib.php");

Otherwise, you have to do something along the lines of

include($GLOBALS['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/../include/mylib.php");

Hi Deidra,

You have to add the directory that contains the files you wish to include to
the php.ini file.
There is a section for paths and directories in there:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Paths and Directories ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; UNIX: "/path1:/path2"  
;include_path = ".:/php/includes"
;
; Windows: "\\path1;\\path2"
;include_path = ".;c:\\php\\includes;c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\"

Once you add the path, it should work.

List,

I'm breaking up my html site into includes (header, copyright, etc.).
Within the HTML documents that call the include files, I have the
appropriate php tags (i.e. <? include("copyright.html"); ?> . All of the
includes (i.e. copyright.html) are sitting in the same directory as my
html pages (i.e. index.html). PHP is installed.

So, why, no matter what I do, don't the include files parse into my
document? I have tried to changed the include extensions from .html to
php to .inc. None parse. Most of my includes contain basic HTML (no php)
like <p>Copyright &copy; 2003. All Rights Reserved.</p>.

Am I doing something wrong? Or does my technician need to change something
in the server configuration (if so what)?

Thanks,
Deidra

What's your OS and web server?  I found that under PHP 4.3.*, Apache,
NetBSD (and perhaps other combinations) there was a recent change in
behavior where the directories above the included files need to be world
readable and executable (meaning "chmod 705").

What error messages are you getting?  You do have error messages turned
on, right?  This kind of stuff comes in handy, helping you figure it out
for yourself, and if you cant, helps us help you.

The suggestions that you need to edit your include path statement in the 
php.ini file are likely incorrect, since "." is in the default include 
path value already.

Similarly, the file extension doesn't matter, nor does the included file 
need to have <?php ?> in them.

Nevermind. I just realized there is another require statement in the CSS
file that I was linking to, and it is not in the same directory as the
calling script. So basically, the CSS file was throwing a fatal error when
the directive was commented out. Interesting error though:

[31-Mar-2003 14:00:39] PHP Fatal error:  Failed opening required
'environment.inc' (include_path='c:\\php4\\pear') in
C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot\\styles\\main.css on line 3

That path must be hardcoded deep in the require module somewhere because it
doesn't even exist on this box.

That is weird, so your LINK is IN an included file? That is wierd. You would
think that the LINK doesn't happen until all the PHP is done executing...so
the LINK should happen the same regardless...however, if it's not happening,
and your INCLUDE file is in some location that, if it was executed directly
the LINK path would be wrong, then that would suggest that PHP behaves
differently depending on the way in which files are included (via include()
vs. php.ini).

Tis strange though.

I just noticed something strange. If I comment out my include directive in
php.ini, files in the same directory as the calling file are still included,
BUT stylesheets fail to be included. Basically, if I pull up a file that has
an include statement for another file, that other file's content is included
but the LINK tag is ignored for some reason. I don't understand why that
would happen. I am parsing through CSS and Javascript files, but it should
still work, shouldn't it?

I just performed this test.

1) Created a file called inctest.php
2) Contents of inctest.php

<?
	include("./myinc.php");
?>

3) Created file called myinc.php
4) Contents of myinc.php (note there are no <? and ?>)
	
	print("Hello");

5) Loaded up file inctest.php in browser
6) Output is:

	print("Hello");

So it seems to me that you MUST put the PHP code in the INCLUDED file IN <?
and ?> in order for it to be parsed. It doesn't matter that you are
including it from withing PHP and it doesn't matter that it ends with .php.
It will not be parsed if it is not in <? ?>.

This test was run on RH 7.3 with PHP 4.3.0-dev with Apache 1.3.22

They are required if you plan on parsing PHP code in the included file. The
Zend engine switches out of PHP mode whenever include is called and it will
not parse by default. It then returns to PHP mode when it reachs EOF.

Well...Deidra said "parsed" so my brain read it as PHP parsed...not HTML...

so, assuming that the included file is not yielding any output...

...I have no idea :)

Permissions maybe?

Does the file that contains the php include end with .php or .html. 
what happens if you make a page with the same suffix as the files that 
contain the includes containing <?php echo "hello world";?>  <? echo " 
hello world "; ?> do both of them show up?

Most hosting providers require that a file end with .php in order for 
the php functions to work. Also some configurations do not allow for 
the 'short tag' format.. Meaning to use php you have to start your code 
with <?php not just <? .

If you have a large amount of files that you are updating with includes 
and the files all end with .html or .htm..  check to see if you hosting 
company allows for .htaccess files. If so you can tell php to parse 
.html files so your file list.html can contain includes and php will do 
what it is supposed to. this is what would be in the .htaccess file of 
your websites top directory

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .html .htm

Otherwise you might have to rename all your .html files to .php

i just think she put the <? include("copyright.html"); ?>
 within  .html\\.htm extension.
she mention a technician so did the conf the php.ini
most off them leave the error all ,
and she didnt say nothin' about error
and she say :

> Within the HTML documents that call the include files,

within the html doc??????
she call the include() from html doc. ??
all she need than is to cahnge is the file  to "whatever.php"  and face the
scond problem :P

deidra : write the file name  ?
            and just C/P the code here,

I passed along most of the emails to the syst. admin (technician) who
installed the PHP on the servers. He's not in till tomorrow.

I will try Dan's suggestion later tonight. Because, that may resolve the
entire issue.

I don't understand the question below. Too much short-hand. To reclarify,
I have basic html pages for the site. Let's take one of them, index.html.
Within index.html, I used several include files to call standard aspects
of the site (i.e. header, certain repetitive images, and copyright). None
of these include files contain php. They are just html (i.e. <p><img
src="sameimageeverywhere.gif"></p>).

Simply changing the html or include files to .php does not resolve the issue.

Does that clarify it for you?

Thanks,
Deidra

Just to clarify, and I think this is what Louie was talking about...

Are you using the php include call on an html page?  Or do you have a page
(whatever.php) from which you are calling .html files as includes?  If this
is the case, and your main page is a .html page, then you cannot use <?php
include () ?> on it unless your server is specifically set up to parse .html
files as if they were php.  Dig?  So when he's talking about changing .html
to .php, he's talking about the main page, not the pages you are calling
from that page.  If this is your situation, you need to tell your web admin
to set up the webserver to parse .html files as if they were .php.

Hope I'm getting the problem right.  It's all a bit confusing.

Luck,
Tim

As others have mentioned, are your files with .html extensions being
parsed by PHP?  View the page in your web browser.  Now view the source
HTML code of that page using your web browser.  What does it show in the 
areas you have the include statements?

Without this information, you're sending yourself, and us, on a wild goose 
chase.

Subject: Special Characters between Platforms
Message-ID: <BAAE3D92.F1BB%jim@nettmedia.com>


Hi,

I've got an intranet I've inherited in which the users are entering data
into a web form from both Mac and Windows.

This data is sent to php scripts and mysql DB running on a Windows Server.

The data is then exported as a text file back to both Macs and PCs for
importing into Quark.

My question is how do I possibly deal with all the special characters that
people are entering? I'm talking about letters with umlauts, accents, "smart
quotes", emdashes, endashes, etc. The codes for these characters are
different on each OS and they keep getting mangled.

Any experience with this problem?

When it is necessary for me to use PHP on an existing site, I add an 
.htaccess file to specify that .htm and .html will be parsed as .php 
files.  Without involving the sysadmin, and assuming that it is an 
Apache server, this is a pretty simple solution, with the negative 
loss of performance when -ever-single-html-page- page is parsed 
whether it contains php or not.

One simple line in .htaccess:

AddType application/x-httpd-php .htm .html

Though I might chime in.

So then it was picked up off of the online archives?  The only place I use
this address is for this mailing list.  It's not even a mail account or an
alias.  I just have all of my email go to one mailbox, but I switch out
the name to track who's selling my email address.  I don't believe NYPHP
is selling email addresses, but I wonder if the archives are being
harvested for spam purposes.

i know we can trust Hans and the team to protect and uphold our privacy.
"nyphp at jimbishop.org" you might consider that your email address is not
complex nor is it encrypted. Individuals who write programs to spam and harm
decent web surfers like yourself love to act menacing and might write
programs to manipulate & compromise usernames for every combination of
XXXX at jimbishop.org.  I also have an email address at my domainname.org but i
never use any combination of that org account for public adventures.  its
always kept private.  my inbox i use for this group rarely displays anything
but nyphp notices. I create 'rules' to manage & delete the unwanted emails.

another option is try
http://fantomaster.com/fantomasSuite/mailShield/famshieldsv-e.cgi or other
mail shields (spamex, spamgourmet or spammotel) to minimize your concerns.

here's another really good bit of advice i found at
http://www.email911.com/resources/whatcanido.html
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER reply or respond to a spam or any bulk unsolicited
commercial email message - especially if it is to ask to be removed from
their mailing list.
Most spam includes a link to a "Removal Form" or a "Removal Address" within
the message. When you reply to any spam message that you receive - even if
it is to request to be removed - you are telling the spammer that your email
address is active. Literally within minutes or hours of your reply they will
put your email address on a CD Rom and sell it to other spammers for profit,
increasing the amount of spam that you receive by ten-fold or more.

Again, negative.  The archives are only accesible after registering and
logging in - something others have mentioned as being a pain, but at the same
time, this is the first ever spam issue that's been reported.

Unless a spammer has registered and logged into the archives, this is not an
issue.  As others pointed out, there are many clever ways people can sniff
addresses or use "brute force" methods.  Having a catchall account for
nyphp.org, I am a victim of these types of attacks continuously.
