Guys, I hate to do this but I am so desperate right now, I really need an
extra set of eyes with a project that needs to be finished today.  Please
contact me ASAP if you can help.  I am definitely willing to pay you. 
This is PHP/AJAX and involves times that auctions start and displaying the
auctions and I just broke something again...

Thanks in advance.

	21)
Message-ID: <CAPiCn7quF+nn908BbS1m-12uOpZh0X7kGnQf8TpQ2HbeUxtxJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all -

I wanted to give you a heads up about two events that I thought the group
might be interested in:

On March 30 I am co-organized a conference called Open Tech NYC, which is
all about how open source is powering the NYC technology community. We have
an amazing lineup of speakers - see http://www.opentech2013.org/#agenda for
more info and registration details.

On June 21, 10gen is hosting MongoDB
NYC<http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodb-new-york-city-2013>,
the annual MongoDB conference in NYC. The conference has sold out the past
three years so I would book early if you are interested in attending. We're
also looking for speakers so if you are interested in sharing your
experiences with MongoDB feel free to submit a talk
proposal<http://www.10gen.com/talk-proposal>or contact me off-list
about getting involved as a speaker.

Hope to see some of you at these events!

Thanks,
Meghan

Message-ID: <3615.72.229.162.69.1363211972.squirrel@kacomputerconsulting.com>

Just when you thought life couldn't get any more fun, you start your new
job, don't have any time to spare, and there's still ONE more bug left to
fix on the project (just one, I swear).  You've already pissed off a few
of your friends, been flaked on by one dude you didn't really know that
well who couldn't read the code and cost you another day, and really need
someone who can read crappy Indian code and knows AJAX backwards and
forwards before you just go crazy once and for all.

Payment available within 2 weeks of invoice, when I get my first paycheck!

Contact ASAP.

Message-ID: <CAAF+Sg5QqNH3JFd1dQJO02bWuWJW7jh8Go=TooZVb62inY9OqQ@mail.gmail.com>

function whatever(Array $array) {

Is there any reason  -- style, legibility, whatever -- not to do the above?
Or should you do something like

function whatever(Array $array)  {

   $return = false;
    foreach ($array as $key => $value) {
        if  ($something)  {
             $return = true;
             break;
        }
    }
    return $return;

There are a few things to learn from here.

First it is not only a styling thing.  In the first one you have several return
statements and in the second you only have 1 return statement.

It will depend on the code logic but I tend to return when I have the value I need rather 
than assign it to a variable and have it continue to process through the rest of the function.

If you only return after the entire function is complete but your known case was the first check in
the function you are "over" processing and will only add time to your sites load time.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

The only reason would be poorly designed code where the return value could
change based on multiple separate conditionals.  I have seen it in some
legacy code.

I would say the first version is ok but only because your function is small
enough.

If your function gets bigger and bigger, then it is better to have only one
exit point  in terms of readability.

I personally would disagree with you on that one.  I think the single
return point is more confusing.  Though that is more of a preference.

The single return path leads to extra processing that would not be required.

I agree, it is a personal preference and I also agree that is a little bit
slower (but just a few microseconds)

If your function gets bigger and bigger, then it is better to have only one
exit point  in terms of readability.

The only reason would be poorly designed code where the return value could
change based on multiple separate conditionals.  I have seen it in some
legacy code.

+1 for the first, because -3 lines of code -1 variable, but really either
are good.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Creating Barcodes..
Message-ID: <CAA3pqsK1CrOZC8bU6=wL7NotoVDGw-1+z1ziwo4+-zRnWXeUcg@mail.gmail.com>

I need to generate a barcode in php and link it to an html document for
printing and then scanning.  Has anyone done this?  I have been attempting
this using the Free30f9.TTF font but I was unable to get this to scan at
all.  I have also tried barcode command in linux which does scan but only
outputs to ps or pcl.  In short, not having much luck.  If anyone has any
suggestions, please send along.  I don't want to have to pay for a barcode
package as this shouldn't be all that difficult, right?

Thanks,
Nick

take a look at the command line utility called  ps2raster you can specify
the output format.

Just wanna say thanks for the comments.

I've since realized from looking at the Zend Framework, which aspires to
high standards, that they certainly do use the
return-as-soon-as-you-figure-it-out approach in method definitions that are
pretty short, and it's extremely clear reading.

If we look closer we'll probably find that they have the most likely ifs
before the less likely. So I'd say this approach is optimal from every
point of view.

Sorry, lost in the endless inbox of gmail...

I think this is good - the March meeting is probably too close - how
about April?

And as an aside... we're putting into works a PHP conference and first
steps is finding a venue - 100+ if possible - suggestions appreciated!

This comes up every few years. The dies off. Its not worth it. Stick with
nginx and php-fpm and be done with it.

So we'll stick on ngnix + phpfpm, but now I'm questioning the hosting we're
moving to (vps.net), because is their tech support that suggested litespeed
for a WP website. I start to be skeptical every time I read "X time faster
then A" or "all the cool kids are using it".
Thanks

I've used Litespeed a bunch in production.  It works well, but there is a
learning curve to use it properly.  For example, in the lsphp External App
in the Server config section, I had to add these environment vars to it to
get it to use one instance for APC:

LSAPI_CHILDREN=100
LSAPI_AVOID_FORK=1
LSAPI_SLOW_REQ_MSECS=30000
LSAPI_ACCEPT_NOTIFY=1

But I've moved on to nginx/php-fpm for new servers.  I used Litespeed
before that combo was available.

If the vps.net tech support is going to setup and manage it for you, then
maybe go with Litespeed if they are most comfortable with that.  Otherwise,
go with what you know best.

Errata corrige: it wans't vps.net support that suggested litespeed, but an
unrelated blog post. We'll go for nginx php-fpm. Thanks guys.
