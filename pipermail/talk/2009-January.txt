Subject: [nycphp-talk] escapeshellcmd stupidity?
Message-ID: <495E4963.7050204@polymerdb.org>

Hi All,

I have a shell script that manages my todo list, and I'd like to access 
it through the Web as well, for convenience when I'm traveling.  ssh is 
not ideal here, since Web gives me access from any machine without 
downloading PuTTY, for example.  Basic auth seems enough to protect my 
todo list from abuse, but the stakes get higher when we consider that 
I'm accepting shell script arguments over the web -- poor security could 
easily lead to arbitrary code being passed to the shell.

Can anyone here comment on the wisdom of relying on escapeshellcmd() in 
a situation like this?  For example:
<?
    $script_path = '/path/to/shell/script';
    shell_exec(escapeshellcmd("$script_path {$_POST['user_input']}"));
?>

It looks right to me, and I've confirmed that it "works," but I can't 
test to confirm it's "safe."  I'd appreciate it if someone more 
experienced could tell me if this is just a Bad Idea.

Thanks,
Allen

First, escapeshellarg() is more specific, and therefore *possibly*
safer. Rather than escaping the whole thing, just escape the user
input.

Second, it would be MUCH safer to determine an acceptable range of
possibilities for the user input, or a pattern (regex or otherwise)
that it should match before being passed to the shell. In other words,
validate the input first, and then filter it when you pass it to the
shell.

In your case you want to pass arbitrary strings, so validation becomes
more difficult. You could still validate the input so that it only
contains printable ascii and simple punctuation, no unprintable
characters or newlines or any of that.

Hi Chris,

Thanks for your helpful input. Some follow-up from me:

In my case, I'm passing multiple arguments, but I'm now regexing them 
apart into separate arguments, so escapeshellarg() does work. For 
forward compat with the wrapped shell script, I'm hoping to avoid 
checking for valid arguments and instead just escaping each argument and 
letting the shell script do its own checking.

Okay, good thought. For this I'll remove the first 32 non-printing ASCII 
chars, and DEL:
<?
$user_input = preg_replace('/[\000-\037\127]/', '', $user_input);
?>

If I'm thinking straight, the above will strip most obviously useless 
chars but still allow lots of chars (e.g. i18n stuff) that I'll never be 
able to whitelist.

Thanks again for your input.

I would submit each argument as a separate POST or GET parameter.  Each 
argument would have a key (the name of the shell script flag) and a value 
(uh, the value).

I'd put an array of allowed flags at the top of the script.  Upon 
submission, I'd loop over the allowed flags and look in GET/POST to see 
if the value is set and if it is pass it along into the argument list to 
the shell command.

Oh, quit whining.  Suck it up and do the right thing.  :)

If you want to be really slick, have your shell script provide output of 
usage or a list of allowed arguments in a format that will be easy for 
your PHP script to parse into an array.  Then have the PHP script call 
the shell script using "/script --help" (or similar) and parse the output 
into an array, then use that array to validate GET/POST.

Unless you're using HTTPS, that security is not sufficient since your 
password will be sent as clear text across an open network...

Agreed. I should have worded it more clearly: Basic auth over http seems 
"secure enough" to protect my todo list from abuse, considering its 
relative value to me. However, given the inherent limitations of basic 
auth over a non-encrypted connection, the stakes get considerably higher 
when we consider that I'm accepting shell script arguments over the web 
-- poor security could easily lead to arbitrary code being passed to the 
shell by anyone who cares enough to sniff out the basic auth credentials.

Basic auth will prevent the casual drifter from writing graffiti on my 
todo list. To prevent real damage to the server itself, I'm relying on 
the script to police the input. Bad idea?

We will be having our second hack-a-thon on Jan 17th here on Long Island.

The focus will be taking our "free" admin screens that work in Firefox 
and tweaking them up to work in IE 6 and 7.  We will also start work on 
a windows installer.

Location is in East Setauket, Long Island, though we welcome remote 
participation as well (except you don't get any free food).

Anybody interested in participating should contact me off-list for more

The $_FILES variable no longer exist.  But, $_FILES is no longer defined.
Does anyone have any creative ideas?

You may want to make sure, but I'm quite positive that you cannot upload
files using 'AJAX', look to flash or an iframe if this is really important.

Funky. I'm thinking not visible iframe with a copy of the data that gets
submitted to a php script that slams the $_FILES into the $_SESSION.

Yuck!

$_FILES should be available through out a request as it is a super global

Just using AJAX no -- but AJAX simply sends data (via a post/get) to 
the server which in turn can run a script to upload files. I've done 
it.

Is it possible to take a reference to a function and then stick it in an
array?

I'd like to have an array with function names as the keys and the values
would be references to the actual function. This way I could do


do[$that_function];

Basically being lazy and don't want to have a big ugly switch block when I
could just declare the array, the functions, and then call it all in one
line.

Not even sure what the calling syntax would be, so I'm not sticking to this
example but it shows the idea I hope.


Is this more commonly done with some sort of eval() function?

I believe this is what you're looking for.

I've done similar things in the past, but I don't have the code handy.

Oh sorry, forgot to add this too, which I think better fits your question:

<?php

function my_func($a) {
    print $a;
}

$a = 'my_func';

$a('hello');

?>

prints:

hello

umm... with objects this gets sexy.


class Add {
    public function execute($a, $b) { return $a + $b; }
}

class Subtract {
    public function execute($a, $b) { return $a - $b; }
}

$executors = array(array('object'=>new Add(), 'params' => array(1,1)));

foreach ($executors as $execute)

I using http and https in an iframe.  I have session variables for both.
Http does not need to know about https and vice versa.

In IE, if I load http the session variable are fine.  If I load https, the
session variables are fine.

However, when I have a page with http and https, it's not fine.

The http loads, then the https loads.  After the https loads, http does not
know about it's session variables.  If I reload http section then the
variables are there.

It's like either http or https session variables can be accessed, but the
separate pages aren't able to access their separate sessions at the same
time.

I saw something when I was researching this problem about using
session.cookie_domain, but I couldn't get that to work for me.

Does anyone how you can have 2 different domains loaded and maintain session
variables for both domains in IE?

In firefox, I'm not having this problem.

Sweet so, I think

$a = 'my_func';

does it for me. I'd love to understand the following code, but I'll have to
read it a couple more times. Haven't quite gotten into classy stuff like
this yet. Looks like actionscript to me with this execute function.

Thanks so much. I didn't expect to get this good an answer.

Also works with properties and methods of objects:

$foo = new Bar();
$a = 'my_method';
$result = $foo->{$a}();

Very useful sometimes.

Yes, but indirection can easily be overused.  Please don't overuse as it
makes reading other's code that much harder.

Hah, just imagining a project from hell that would define() all of the
method names in an include and then make calls like the following:

$result = $foo->{ MY_METHOD_1 }();

... because then if the foo interface ever changes, all you have to do
is update the include file. :-D

That's crazy talk.  

-- defining/reading constants is expensive - performance

-- when an interface to an object changes, it's likely going to be more than
just syntactic sugar and the names of the methods

-- looks weird

-- it's just strange

-- indirection is never implemented in an organized way

There, I said it :)

     I've recently written a "framework" that's part of a planned 
software product line.  One of the consequences is that I've written 
command-line PHP scripts that need to deal with objects that didn't 
exist when the script was written,  so I needed an autoloader.

    I did some research and I was really impressed with A.J. Brown's 
dynamic autoloader:

http://ajbrown.org/blog/2008/12/02/an-auto-loader-using-php-tokenizer.html

    Rather than assuming a certain convention for how file names relate 
to class names,  it scans directory trees,  parses files and creates a 
mapping.  This adds some overhead,  but that can be reduced by using 
serialize() to cache the result.  I've written some thought about this up:

http://gen5.info/q/2009/01/09/an-awesome-autoloader-for-php/

    Any thoughts?

put $_FILES into the session before you do the ajax request

$_SESSION['uploaded_files'] = $_FILES;
and use $_SESSION['uploaded_files'] in your ascript.php

You may want to read up on session_write_close().  From what you're 
describing in various places, this may not be your issue, but it's a good 
thing to know about.

I know nothing about this particular service, or this individual, but what
I've noticed is that many new 'social' apps gratuitously send (SPAM) email
to your entire email address book, or networks from other sites WITHOUT
warning.

Makes me unhappy.

How has the economic apocalypse left the PHP world?

So far I've heard some rumors of job layoffs, but most of them have been 
relegated to the financial sector. Every freelancer/consultant I know of 
that has been in business for more than a year is doing great, but 
recent starters are having a harder time of it.

Venture capital money is starting to tighten up (but not as much as I 
thought it would), which more or less affects the PHP world since PHP 
tends to see more use in startups.

What are you guys hearing out there? What's the job market like in NYC?

What's even worse: people are giving fly-by-night social networks
their email passwords. So not only do they spam your address book,
they now have access to your mailbox and any password resets that get
sent to it.

Any site that asks users for their login credentials at some other
site should be shut down on principle. (I'm looking at you, Facebook.

For what if anything it's worth, there is considerable interest in the 
current round of PHP training that NYPHP is offering, more than has been 
typical over the past couple of years. This suggests (to me at least) 
that there is plenty of demand out there.

oDesk is, as far as I know, more often used for one-off gigs that are 
typically filled by freelancers. More often than not, they're outsourced 
outside the United States.

Small projects of that sort are going to gravitate towards PHP and away 
from the things normally used for larger projects (Java, etc). It 
probably gives PHP a boost that can't be applied to the job industry.

Speaking of which, the first page of "Web Programming" providers doesn't 
include one American. I don't know a single US consultant who uses a 
service like this, especially in the NYC area.

(Otherwise, I agree with what you said, I just don't think that oDesk's 
stats can be useful for anyone other than oDesk users.)

What is Facebook? I guess it pays to be not hip at all costs. But I confess, I 
did break down a year ago and bought a cell phone, just to find out that I 
used a whopping 80 minutes in the past twelve months. At that rate it will 
take a while to use up the 1000 minutes that I bought. I did overhear some 
rumors about some gizmo called MySpace as well.....

If you're not in a well-funded startup and not fired yet then you should 
be careful. Now is a good time to be in a full-time gig with an 
established firm.

My friend teaches Microsoft office training for a career skills type
company. He said initially they got a large amount of business when people
got laid off. Now the same people are still laid off so no one is coming in
for training.

I think the curve will be more subtle for PHP programmers and there are
external factors. For example, recent college graduates will probably engage
in a lot of self directed learning. I think overall PHP, and other
technology fields  will see a less pronounced bump in training, followed by
a sharp decline. Just smoother than the workforce in general.

Regardless of the NYPHP training, there is certainly a lot of demand.  Take
a look at the NYPHP-Jobs list - there's tons of potential work out there.
Of course, in times like this, there's good and bad work to be had so be
careful.  That said, times like this can produce rare opportunities.

I find that diversification is a good thing. If you're a consultant
with a half-dozen clients and one of them tanks, you've still got
others to rely on until you track down some more work. It's a lot
easier to survive that than it is to suddenly find yourself jobless.

Of course, if the market is suddenly flooded with new "freelancers"
who are willing to work for chicken scratch then suddenly you might
find yourself high and dry, but I still think that's easier to deal
with than being laid off.

The good news, as Hans pointed out, is that there still seem to be a
lot of PHP-related jobs out there for qualified candidates. So far I
haven't seen anything to convince me that a good programmer would be
without work for very long.

Actually when times are good people become complacent. It's when
people are moping around with nothing to do that interesting things
start to happen. This is particularly true in the arts. Look at TV and
music - it's been the same contrived drivel for years. If a lot of
people are without work for a year or two, eventually you'll start to
see interesting things happen. That will capture imaginations and
reignite compulsive spending habits.

You don't need to buy test-tubes, lease office space or go
door-to-door to write software. If you're a programmer and find
yourself out of work, get a comfortable chair and code up something
useful. But pick something specific and practical. If you're
recognised as being really good at one thing, then you can just sit
back and people will come to you.

we lose 700 minutes a month because I try not to use my cell phone

Funny you should ask, I've been struggling through something personal 
and related for a while now. Would appreciate any wisdom you folks can 
offer.

I see a great need for PHP skilled people as small businesses realize 
COTS costs them, locks them in, and they still need skilled people to 
implement. What I've seen down here is that someone who knows enough PHP 
to savvy things like Joomla and make web pages more useful are needed. 
That may be a case of situational perceptions as I'm not a real PHP 
programmer but more of a systems guy that understands PHP at the 
Apprentice level.

For the next 3-5 market years my bet is that contract/freelance work 
will provide the stability, if you have a good reputation and diverse 
client set. This is not just PHP but in the server market as well. As a 
systems engineer the clients seem to not have funds for a full timer 
unless there's a big multi-year project well funded. More that there's a 
short term business case that has 2 months of budget for a finite task. 
For that it's "get in, get the job done, and leave your business card 
and a good reputation".

Of course, this is my theory as I sit here still looking for work. 
Charlotte is a financial town and we're hit heavy by the BoA and 
Wachovia problems. My personal struggle is in re-defining work skills to 
meet the needs. Dreams of being "a top coder" or "Linux guru" are nice 
but my character is the "helps other people do well" and "knows enough 
to make things work". I could live in the juncture between the business 
case, the technical specs, and the executive summary; shuttling and 
translating details to meet each need. Just need to find folks who need 
that done enough to pay for it.

PHP is a great tool for enabling communications because the web has 
become so integral to our concept of communication. There are probably 
better languages for other software projects but PHP rules for 
presenting global data in a few useful pages.

I would strongly recommend a few reads. Here they are in some semblance 
of order:
  	The 7 habits of Highly Effective People -- Covey
	What color is your parachute? -- Bolles
	Tribes -- Godin
	Web 2.0 -- Shuen
	
Entrepreneurship is heavily on my mind and there are some reads for 
that. Some are providing a mix of advice and encouragement; handy to have!

For my personal suggestions to the group;
	look to your self for an employer. You will only work for yourself 
anyway, no matter who pays the bills. Chart your career for the next 3-5 
years, list the things you'd love to do and the skills you need to have. 
Pursue both.
	look to your character as marketing tool. There are lots of people able 
to do any job! To get hired by more than dumb luck you need to deal with 
the fact that humans make hiring decisions and your humanity is your 
resume in motion.
	look to serve. Even if you can't monetize everything directly, 
contribute in ways that communicate your skills, personality, and goals. 
Help others and know you made the world a better place.

I'm not sure about PHP in particular, but in general we can expect IT 
departments to be trying to do more with less.  Same story as usual but 
with a serious edge to it now.

This has created opportunities for me and my company.  Since our core 
product reduces staff requirements, we are getting interest that was 
harder to get before.  In good times it is harder to break in as a 
newcomer and start-up, or so we found.  In bad times people are much 
more willing to spend some time examining alternatives.  Oddly enough, 
we are seeing people become less risk-adverse in the hopes of finding 
new ways to do things.

I'm seeing the entire thing as a huge opportunity.

Strangely, and thankfully, business "on the outskirts" is still pretty 
brisk.

Not as strange as you'd think: now is the time that venture money is 
chasing after "something new", since everything "old" is tanking mightily.

I don't want to cast any evil eyes, so I'll just say that NYC has not

At the risk of sounding flippant, you could "[assume] a certain  
convention for how file names relate to class names" and use six lines  
of code for autoloading.  The PEAR naming convention is perfect for  
this.  Underscores in class names map to subdirectories, so the  
transformation of class name to file path is trivial.

     spl_autoload_register('houle_autoload');
     function houle_autoload($class)
     {
         $file = str_replace('_', '/', $class) . '.php';
         return $file;
     }

As a bonus, you then have a standard organizational structure for  
classes that works for everything everywhere the same way every time.

    I think the PEAR naming convention is wack,  I may be fighting a 
losing battle against the CamelCaseSelfishMeme,  but I'm on this side:

http://dontcuddleyourbraces.blogspot.com/2007/10/against-camelcase.html

    It's particularly disasterous that PHP has embraced the convention 
from Java (maybe we think it makes us look sophisticated and cool) 
because dynamic generation of filenames,  class names and method names 
is much more common in PHP than it is in Java.  PHPers who want to write 
reliable programs need 100% reliable and crisp ways to transform to and 
from phrases and language identifiers.  I mean,  is it

UseCamelCaseInPHP,  or UseCamelCaseInPhp?

    As cute as Ruby on Rails pluralizer is,  it's also a source of 
defects.  The CamelCaseSelfishMeme has blinded people to the 
TrueSemanticsOfCapitalization and the_simplicity_of

$token=str_replace(" ","_",$phrase);

-----------------

    At the moment,  for instance,  I'm designing an object model where 
several PHP objects define various behaviors of a metaobject that lives 
in a relational database.  If "X" is the name of the metaobject,  these 
could be

type_of_X,
instance_of_X,
X_controller

    Now,  I suppose I could call them all

X_controller
X_instance
X_type

    maybe that's good,  but I don't want that decision coupled to the 
way I want the class files organized in the project tree.  Personally I 
find CPAN projects hard to read and navigate because the naming 
convention enforces a sub-optimal code organization.  (Not to mention 
the ususally useless javadoc documentation in CPAN projects that means 
the number of non-comment lines per average editor screen is about 1 or 2.)

    Mind you,  I could change my mind entirely if there was toolset 
support that (i) wiped away the difficulties,  and (ii) reaped benefits 
from a fixed code organization,  the way that Eclipse/Java does.

Chad,
     It doesn't look like you need PHP at all here. Try the following,
Replace:
     <?php echo "<a href=\"javascript:chng('img')\"><img
src=\"images/bullet_green.png\" name=\"img\"></a>" ;?>
With:
     <img src=\"images/bullet_green.png\" name=\"img\" onClick="chng(img)">

I don't see the 'img' variable declared anywhere. Is it a JavaScript or PHP ($img) variable?
In the former case, PHP is not needed. 
Assuming the latter case, try this:
(plain HTML here)

<img src="images/bullet_green.png" name="<?php echo $img; ?>" 
???? onclick="chng('<?php echo $img; ?>')" />

The source is all javascript.  It's got nothing to do with php.  Should be
on a javascript forum

if (document[c_img].src.indexOf(img1)!= -1) document[c_img].src = img2; 
     else document[c_img].src = img1; 
should be

if (document.getElementById(c_img).src.indexOf(img1)!= -1)
document.getElementById(c_img).src = img2; 
     else document.getElementById(c_img).src = img1; 

looks like you were trying
if (document.all[c_img].src.indexOf(img1)!= -1) document.all[c_img].src =
img2; 
     else document.all[c_img].src = img1; 
document[c_img] dne.

One final thing.  Is it calling the function and just not working or not
calling the function?

Quick test. Put and alert statement at the top of the function to see if
it's actually called.

Cause that function doesn't look like it works to me.

What the heck is Masque?  It's mentioned in the key for the graph on page 
5.  Is it some word made up by the French Academy to replace "Java"?

Hi Folks - 
 
This should be simple, but I haven't been able to debug it on my own, so I'm
asking for help.
 
I'm walking through a user's webform submission that I've put into an object
and comparing each of that object's properties with the current properties
($cur) stored on mySQL database.
The example below is input for a phone number (phone1).
 
This example stores the 10-digit phone number into variable $c:
$c=$cur->phone1['descr'];
 
If I use $key to capture the property to be checked ('phone1'), the
following stores null:
$b=$cur->$key['descr'];
 
Any help on understanding why $cur->$key['descr'] is not synonymous with
$cur->phone1['descr'] when $key='phone1' would be a help!
 
Best Regards - 
 
Rick

I would guess that $key['descr'] is happening before $cur->$key.

Kenneth - THANKS!  I need to go back over my code, but the curly-brackets
solved the problem:

$b=$cur->{$key}['descr']; resolves to the 10-digit phone number I was
looking for.

Message-ID: <1232728268.25764.1296389567@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I have an interesting idea for a to-do list/reminder site. I want to
release it completely free to help people (and to get our names out
there for other work). I've got the domain, I've got the web space, and
I've got the gen'l ideas worked out.

I am a front-end developer with a lot of background experience. I want
to concentrate on just designing and implementing this. I'm looking for
a Zend/PHP person to help think this thru and then do the back-end. It
will be a fun, not-too-intense evening and weekend project (shouldn't
take more than a couple weeks) that I think will get us some good
attention.

Let me know if yre interested. Thanks!

Message-ID: <20090125194331.MBGV26080.hrndva-omta04.mail.rr.com@DeJaVu>

I got an undefined function error on mcrypt_encrypt.

It looks to be an extension.  I downloaded the source code.

I'm guessing my hosting provider didn't include it.  So what's new?

I see a lot on line about using use_entension=php_mcrypt.dll, but that's in
a windows environment.

Does anyone know?  If I have to do anything in the php.ini file to use
mcrypt on linux/apache/redhat?  Or if it's installed it just works?

I hate to think I'm going to have to recompile php on my machine, just to
get that function.

I'm looking in the php.conf file, I see loadmodule for libphp5.so.

Do I just compile the php with the extension?

I'm guessing it doesn't matter what version I have now if I'm recompiling.

Does anyone know the name of the .so file that contains mcrypt is just in
case it's there and if I have to modify the php.conf file or do the
extensions have to be compiled in libphp5.so??

Maybe you will have to. But more importantly, your hosting provider will 
have to be told/convinced.

What am I looking for?  I've never seen phpinfo() where mcrypt was
installed.
--disable-posix-threads in the configuration command or something in
additional .ini files parsed?  Would it list mcrypt explicitly?

Maybe you will have to. But more importantly, your hosting provider will 
have to be told/convinced.

You'll see --with-mcrypt in the configure command at the top, and an  
mcrypt section farther down in the phpinfo() output.

According to php.net, you probably need to compile libmcrypt itself,  
passing --disable-posix-threads to libmcrypt's configure script

If you're using Red Hat just do:

I was about to install php on a G4 I have and thought I should maybe
go lightweight with it. Really I'm sure it can handle Apache 2 just
fine, since it's just for development... but why not make it fun?

So I took a look at going with lighttpd from the php manual and the
setup that that would entail. What really struck me was that fastcgi
can take a network socket as well as the traditional file socket.
Here's an excerpt from the php.net manual:

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.lighttpd-14.php

Connecting to remote FCGI instances

Fastcgi instances can be spawned on multiple remote machines in order
to scale applications.

Example #3 Connecting to remote php-fastcgi instances

fastcgi.server = ( ".php" =>
   (( "host" => "10.0.0.2", "port" => 1030 ),
    ( "host" => "10.0.0.3", "port" => 1030 ))
)


Whoa! Has anyone done this? I understand php isn't probably what's
killing your CPU, rather, it's the database... but I was psyched to
stumble upon this anyway in case it ever comes up in the future.

More people are probably familiar with traditional load balancing
using Apache 1 stripped down. I'm interested to see if anyone's
stripping it *all the way* down like in this example.

Guys,

 

I posted a while back about php dumping to the screen for God knows what
reason, the sys admin or something.

Anyway, I picked up Chris Shiftlett's book "Essential Handbook on Php
Security".  Nestled in the 100 page book was don't keep php in webroot.

I can't remember the reason for that statement, but that cleared up my
concern for code dumping to the screen for God knows what reason.

It also, cleared up my concerns about keeping passwords in php.

Now, a lot of people attacked me for my ignorance, but I'm new to web
development.  I've had my company for just one year now and I haven't been
taking clients of even one year.  My total experience has been about 2 years
part-time.  I was a c programmer for 7 years and have a Computer Science
degree from UC-Berkeley.  I'm no hack.  I'm just a newbie in the web arena.
But, don't go to sleep on me.  I'm a quick study.  Plus, I work at home.
I'd be in a vacuum if it wasn't for the web and these mailing list.

So, anyway for anyone that I caused concern for the solution for me is keep
code off webroot and in webroot just include those file.  Worries over.  Bad
sys admin or no.

Someone have told me that or directed me to a good book, rather than getting
flustered with me.

Frustrated, I went to Barnes and Noble.  When the gal typed in php and
security she found Chris's book and another book that's supposed to be
realeased this month.

For a new programmer, Chris's book is chalked full of good info.  Straight
to the code.  No fluff.

    Personally I avoid off-brand web servers.  Many of them have 
correctness problems that cause,  say,  1 in 100 large file downloads to 
be corrupted.

    I've tried a number of "lightweight web servers" including 
"lighthttpd" and,  so far,  I've always had problems when they're used 
in production systems.

I don't think you need to strip anything down. Apache/PHP/MySQL would
run just fine on a G4 in their standard setup, just some standard
configuration tweaking.
The hardware would actually be a good setup to optimize your code,
which is where the biggest slow downs usually occur. If it runs fine
on a G4, it will run great on better hardware.
Also, if you are running OSX, especially and older version, the
bottleneck could be the operating system. Older versions of OSX didn't
have fine grained locking of system resources (i.e. networking), so
the slowdowns occur because of locking and waiting, not because of CPU
load. OSX is getting better, but still has a little ways to go.

Hey all,

This is more of a fastcgi/php  question. If anyone has experience
working like this it would be interesting to hear. I don't really
care. I should probably go bug the fastcgi people about this.... It's
nice to hear what people have to say about webservers, but it's this
concept of having just fastcgi running in some sort of a farm that's
interesting me. Lighty, apache, iis.... not really the issue for me.
Things like - "This kills APC due to weird cache misses" are what I'm
looking to hear if anyone has experience on it.

Yeah, generally code that doesn't need to be opened in a browser, doesn't 
need to be in the webroot (and that means include files too!). Im working 
a lot with symfony these days, and the only file in the webroot is the 
single entrypoint via index.php.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Scope in foreach construct.
Message-ID: <C5A35CBF.3244%anthony@thrillist.com>

When working with foreach constructs do the functions and variables defined get returned to the garbage collector on each iteration or does the foreach have to finish execution before things can be returned to the garbage collector?

The reason that I ask is because we are generating data for Google Maps and they require one very large XML file which keeps blowing our memory size definition inside the php.ini file.  What we might end up doing is creating the XML file in batches of lets say 500 items or less and then append the files manually.

I figured this was an interesting question and I can't find any answers anywhere else (even on php.net docs).

Yeah, Ive been using a similar setup for about a year now...

Now, for extra points, you'll show us how to recode Apache rewrite rules 
so they work in light :-))

Generally, lighty is great for image servers and other static resources.

Since it can hand off the dynamic requests to another server, it can be 
used as a proxy in front of a farm of Apache servers that will do the 
heavy lifting.

Im running that on a G3 (not a production server!), but to be fair, the G3

foreach makes a copy of the array element you are processing. If the
current "value" is large, like another array, then you have 2 large
arrays. Use a for loop instead or use a reference for the value
variable:
foreach ( $array as &$value ) ...

If you are running into memory problems, you probably should rethink
how you are processing the data. You should process it in chunks and
stream it out to the XML file. Then it does matter how large the data
set gets.

You can also just adjust the php memory limit if you haven't done that
already. It defaults to 8MB or 16MB (5.2).

Use memory_get_usage to see where your memory is jumping.

Hope that helps.

Brent,

Thanks for the feedback, we are going to do the XML file in batches but it is interesting to see that the memory from within the foreach never gets returned (tested with memory_get_usage).  Now there are a couple of other variables to assume with this application.  It is Drupal based so yeah there is bloat but we take that into consideration (our memory size is set to 128mb per operation) and we also assume that the postgresql db driver in Drupal is doing its job on not creating un necessary connections for each call to node_load() but we haven't dug that deep into the Drupal core for times sake.  But I didn't know you could use the variable in a foreach as a reference, I will have to take that into consideration when being a memory conservationist in the future.

I hope you enjoy the book. :-)

The recommendation you're referring to is probably to reduce risk  
wherever possible. For resources that don't need to be directly  
accessible via URL, there's no reason to keep them in document root.  
But, to be clear, the risk in this case is human error.

> It also, cleared up my concerns about keeping passwords in php.

I hope this isn't bad news, but if you're on a shared host, there's  
another concern here. Others can potentially access your files, even  
if they're not in document root. I think the book discusses this in  
Chapter 8. I have a free article that might also be helpful:

I remember the discussion, and I don't believe you were attacked. Just  
be a little more honest with your uncertainty when presenting  
information. In your case, you were presenting misinformation as if it  
were fact, and people understandably corrected that. I can understand  
how this can make you feel attacked, but hopefully you can step back  
and see the bigger picture now. :-)

Exactly. If you can architect a system in a way that makes human error  
less likely or less damaging, then doing so is a good idea. Everyone  
will agree with that.

In "tbody",I can add or remove more "name[]","position[]","city[]","state[]" and "zip[]" through "add" or "remove" buttons.
On "create.php" page, I expect to show all like:
1.
name      
position
city
state
zip
2.
name      
position
city
state
zip
3.
name
position
city
state
zip
----------

How to program php script to pass all these above information?"name","position","city","state" and "zip" are all array.
 
Thanks!

chad, when posted the arrays should be available using $_POST['name'],
$_POST['position'], etc

try doing print_r($_POST['name']) to check this

i am not seeing an input type="submit" on your form...which should be there
if the user is submitting everything after filling the fields

If city, state etc are all scalars, why do you want an array at all? And if
you do want some or all of the form data wrapped into an array, you might
want to use notation like

<input name="person[name]" type="text" />
<input name="person[zip]" type="text" />

or you can just use:
<input name="name[1]" type="text" />
<input name="zip[1]" type="text" />
....
<input name="name[2]" type="text" />
<input name="zip[2]" type="text" />
....
<input name="name[3]" type="text" />
<input name="zip[3]" type="text" />

then you will get an array after the post

suppose your input is names[]

foreach ($_POST['names'] as $name) {
<your code>
}

where $name has the value for each entry of the array

php.net/foreach

<form method="post" action="some.php">
<input name="data[test][]" value="index 0" />
<input name="data[test][]" value="index 1" />
<input name="data[test][]" value="index 2" />
</form>


when this form is submitted $_POST will contain

$_POST['data']['test'][0] = "index 0"
$_POST['data']['test'][1] = "index 1"
$_POST['data']['test'][2] = "index 2"


I'd suggest messing around with [] in the name attribute and looking at what
you can get out of post with different
combinations.

OnClick=AddRow()"... are you trying to send a JavaScript array to the server?
This is not really a PHP issue. But check out the following link, 
http://www.coderanch.com/t/120794/HTML-JavaScript/sending-javascript-array-server
it might help.

Also, note that your City and State <input tags> are enclosed inside <label>, I don't think that was intentional on your part.

The name of a form element affects the data type? Doesn't some sort of
eval or ${} magic have to happen here? This is a little funky playing
around with bareword interpretation.
Is there some switch in the global configuration which turns this kind
of insanity off? I want my hash keys to be plain old strings, whether
they have square brackets in them or not.

Referring to Elijah's post, er email... I would expect that


<input name="data[test][]" value="index 0" />

  would yield a normal 1-dimensional array with an unfortunately named key

$_POST['data[test][]'] == "index 0"

Browser vendors consider opening a file dialog with javascript to be a
security threat, and is not possible on modern browsers.  Opening a
file dialog must be user initiated.

Also, please don't crosspost.  Post to one list, and wait awhile
before posting your question to another list.

John Campbell

Hi Brent:

On Mon, Jan 26, 2009 at 12:50:38PM -0500, Brent Baisley wrote:

That doesn't sound right.  PHP is pretty smart about memory usage.  When 
a variable is utilized in a way that is only reading the value, a 
reference is used.  The variable is only copied when write operations are 
happening.  This is also the case, for example, for function parameters.

But if you need to modify the value and need to be frugal about memory 
and are okay with modifying the initial variable, references do come in 
handy.

But be warned, using references for values in foreach loops leads to very 
strange behaviors once the loop exits.

Here's a test script verifying the memory usage issues:

SCRIPT
------
<?php
echo 'start: ' . memory_get_usage(true) . "\n";

$array = array(
    str_repeat('1', 1000000),
    str_repeat('1', 1000000),
    str_repeat('1', 1000000),
);
echo 'set $array: ' . memory_get_usage(true) . "\n";

foreach ($array as $value) {
    echo 'foreach $value: ' . memory_get_usage(true) . "\n";

    $value = str_repeat('0', 1000000);
    echo 'altered $value: ' . memory_get_usage(true) . "\n";
}

foreach ($array as &$value) {
    echo 'foreach by ref $value: ' . memory_get_usage(true) . "\n";

    $value = str_repeat('0', 1000000);
    echo 'altered by ref $value: ' . memory_get_usage(true) . "\n";
}
echo 'end: ' . memory_get_usage(true) . "\n";
?>


OUTPUT
------
start: 262144
set $array: 3407872
foreach $value: 3407872
altered $value: 4456448
foreach $value: 3407872
altered $value: 4456448
foreach $value: 3407872
altered $value: 4456448
foreach by ref $value: 3407872
altered by ref $value: 3407872
foreach by ref $value: 3407872
altered by ref $value: 3407872
foreach by ref $value: 3407872
altered by ref $value: 3407872

The test I provided in another email in this thread makes it seem like 
garbage collection is happening on each iteration.

Are you storing the XML output in memory while you're looping then 
writing it to file?  Or are you writing it directly to the file while 
you're looping?  I'd do the latter when memory optimization is an issue.

That shouldn't be necessary.  Even if you go with that approach, you can 
append all output to one file rather than creating multiple files and 
merging those.

I was just kind of caught off guard, not trying to derail the
discussion. I had no idea that this could be done. Is it really true?

Jesse, don't worry about having questions, they are welcome on this list.

As far as your question, yes, it can be done. If you create a form input 
labeled data[Person][name] it will be referenced in the next page like this:

$_POST['data']['Person']['name]

Some frameworks use this extensively, as it makes it easy to recursively 
go over data.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [ANNOUNCE] Andromeda Feature Freeze
Message-ID: <498272BF.6060008@secdat.com>

Andromeda is a database application framework written in PHP that builds 
and uses PostgreSQL databases.

I am very happy to announce that as of tonight, we have drafted all 
features that compose the original vision of Andromeda.  We are now 
entering into debugging and documentation mode and are proceeding to 
Release 1.

the docs are here: www.andromeda-project.org

and the demo is at www.andromeda-project.org/demo

the source of the demo is available here: 
https://andro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/andro/apps/finance/application

I sometimes like to call Andromeda the "un-framework" because it has 
little in common with other frameworks out there.  Its primary goal is 
to eliminate as many tasks as possible through radical use of the D-R-Y 
principle at the database level.  In other words, we allow you to 
specify huge amounts of security and application logic within the 
description of the database.  This has ramifications for the entire 
cycle.  Things like ORM and MVC seem way too complicated after you have 
built an app with Andromeda -- a seasoned Andromeda  programmer wants to 
spec out the database and get straight to the presentation of custom 
pages, confidently knowing that the biz logic is all taken care of.

If you want to find out more, look at the source directory listed above, 
you will see that there are only two files.  The magic is in the 
'finance.dd.yaml' file, the entire demo as you see it is generated out 
of that file.

However, no automated system is ever going to handle every case, so 
Andromeda lets you freely and easily "escape the cage" at many levels.  
If you have to 'drink the coolaid' to use Andromeda, we would prefer it 
be only a teaspoon, not a jug.

I am making a pitch on Mon Feb 2, 2009 to a non-profit to convert their
entire web site to LAMP.

Can anyone tell me a couple of company names, non-profit or major corp.,
who are PHP users right now.

When I look up PHP usage on the Internet, the results and stats often
appear stale.

Can anyone spare a few current co. names?

Folks:

When friends/family/etc ask what PHP is, I say something like "It's a 
programming language frequently used to make interactive websites.  For 
example, Facebook uses PHP."

Huh?  That is like asking if anyone knows anyone that drives a car
made by General Motors.
(btw, GM uses php, on their blog)

High traffic sites: Yahoo, nytimes, Facebook

Are you looking for anything in particular?

Big PHP sites are all over the place. Flikr, Yahoo!, Amazon, ... Just
look around. There usually not to hard to spot. Just look for '.php'
when you mouse-over URLs.

For example, look at the The International Herald Tribune site
(www.iht.com) and look at any article. Then mouse-over links in the
side block with 'E-mail article', '3-Column format', etc.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Firefox and authentication
Message-ID: <20090131023020.FJZO6616.hrndva-omta05.mail.rr.com@DeJaVu>

I'm trying to switch from basic authentication to digest.  I'm working in
Firefox, which is why.

 

 I'm using mod_auth_mysql for most of the account.

     <Files login.php>        Logged in as Basic

  AuthType Basic

  AuthName "The space"

  require group agroup

     </Files>

<Files logout.php>      Want to call a script protected by digest

AuthType Digest

AuthName "The Space"

AuthUserFile /home/path/.htpasswd

Require user nonexistent

</Files>

 

To log off, I'm using:

olxmlHttp.open("GET","logout.php",false, "logoff", "logoff");

olxmlHttp.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Digest');

olxmlHttp.send(null);

            olxmlHttp.abort(); //* commented out right now

In the .htaccess file I have:

 

In the domain error log I get:

Digest: client used wrong authentication scheme `Basic':
/path/force_logout.php, referer: https://domain/path/

Then a popup window opens.  

When I type the wrong user/password, in the error log I get:

Digest: user `b' in realm `The Space' not found: /path/logout.php, referer:
https://domain/path

 

Does anyone know how to switch between authentication type from a script?
I'm was thinking setRequestHeader would work.

In phpinfo() on a script in the same directory, I have:

 

HTTP Request GET /path/file HTTP/1.1

User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5)
Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 

Accept 

Keep-Alive 300 

Connection keep-alive 

Cookie PHPSESSID=whatever

Authorization Digest username="user", realm="My Site", nonce="value",
uri="script", algorithm=MD5, response="value", qop=auth, nc=00000001,
cnonce="value

 

What I'm not sure is what the server is looking at.  The authorization value
in the client header?  Is that dictating what should happen. Httpd is
complaining wrong Authentication Scheme, which makes me think server side
Authenticate header, which is what I was trying for a while until I realized
I was on the client.

Can I change the headers and it will work?  Is this the right thing to do?

I dabbled a little with setting different Authorization header values.

But, I need a break and could use some advice.

Well, one way to get to find out who uses PHP (meaning they use a PHP 
application on their web server, not necessarily develop in PHP) is to follow 
the links off the web sites of the popular frameworks. For example Joomla! is 
used by IHOP, United Nations, MTV's Quizilla. And of course MediaWiki, the 
engine running WikiPedia is written in PHP.
I don't know if it helps, but my German hometown newspaper WZ-Newsline.de runs 
their online presence using a CMS written entirely in PHP. Of course, I've 
forgotten the name of the CMS. And the WZ paper (WZ = Westdeutsche Zeitung) is 
not just some small penny saver paper. Same applies for the Aachener Zeitung 
at az-web.de.
Uh, and not to forget the other big CMS Drupal. Take a look here: 
http://drupal.org/cases

Hope this helps,

David

The whitepaper does name names, and makes a good "executive" case for PHP as
__the__ enterprise language that runs the Internet.  It was and still is the
P in LAMP (and friendly with Perl and Python).  LAMP is the predominant
platform.  Java and .Net are other platforms but don't have the same
advantages in the web space.

I am looking really for a few good name not for profits in the style of

YMCA or Red Cross, etc. Or a big museum or art association. 

Yahoo, facebook are very good but I wanted more sensitively focused 
co. names related to not for profits. 

E.g. Joomla for United Nations is very good.
International Herald Tribune.
NY Botanical Garden.

IBM and Oracle corporate-level support is good

If there are any more co. names I would still take more.

Warmest regards,

Huh?  That is like asking if anyone knows anyone that drives a car
made by General Motors.
(btw, GM uses php, on their blog)

High traffic sites: Yahoo, nytimes, Facebook

Are you looking for anything in particular?

The white paper is an excellent resource with many great talking points,  thank you. 

But it does not name enough names related to  my specific pitch.

Can't really speak on who is using it but can point you to the whitepaper which might have some company names in it:

http://short.ie/php-whitepaper


The whitepaper does name names, and makes a good "executive" case for PHP as __the__ enterprise language that runs the Internet.  It was and still is the P in LAMP (and friendly with Perl and Python).  LAMP is the predominant platform.  Java and .Net are other platforms but don't have the same advantages in the web space.

I am making a pitch on Mon Feb 2, 2009 to a non-profit to convert their
entire web site to LAMP.

Can anyone tell me a couple of company names, non-profit or major corp.,
who are PHP users right now.

When I look up PHP usage on the Internet, the results and stats often
appear stale.

Can anyone spare a few current co. names?

I don't know where else to post this.  This question is directed to anyone
that knows the httpd c source code pretty well.

I'm thinking, if when you try to login in the browser using htaccess if it
fails you get logged out.

That must mean there is a clear_authentication_cache sort of function in the
httpd source code.

I'm thinking I could call this function in ap_note_basic_auth_failure().

That would force a logout I'm thinking.

Does anyone know the name of the httpd source code function that clears the
authentication cache?  The source code is huge and I'm exhausted.

I am making a pitch on Mon Feb 2, 2009 to a non-profit to convert their
entire web site to LAMP.

Can anyone tell me a couple of company names, non-profit or major corp.,
who are PHP users right now.

When I look up PHP usage on the Internet, the results and stats often
appear stale.

Can anyone spare a few current co. names?

I?m trying to switch from basic authentication to
digest.? I?m working in Firefox, which is why. 

 ? 

?I?m using mod_auth_mysql for most of the account. 

???? <Files
login.php>??????? Logged in as Basic 

?
AuthType Basic 

?
AuthName "The space" 

?
require group agroup 

???? </Files> 

<Files
logout.php>????? Want to call a script protected by
digest 

AuthType Digest 

AuthName "The Space" 

AuthUserFile /home/path/.htpasswd 

Require user nonexistent 

</Files> 

 ? 

To log off, I?m using: 

olxmlHttp.open("GET","logout.php",false,
"logoff", "logoff"); 

olxmlHttp.setRequestHeader('Authorization',
'Digest'); 

olxmlHttp.send(null); 

??????????? olxmlHttp.abort();
//* commented out right now 

In the .htaccess file I have: 

 ? 

In the domain error log I
get: 

Digest:
client used wrong authentication scheme `Basic': /path/force_logout.php,
referer: https://domain/path/ 

Then a popup window opens.?
 

When I type the wrong
user/password, in the error log I get: 

Digest:
user `b' in realm `The Space' not found: /path/logout.php, referer: https://domain/path 

 ? 

Does anyone know how to
switch between authentication type from a script?? I?m was thinking setRequestHeader
would work. 

In phpinfo() on a script in
the same directory, I have: 

 ? 

HTTP Request GET /path/file
HTTP/1.1 

User-Agent Mozilla/5.0
(Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5  

Accept  

Keep-Alive 300  

Connection keep-alive  

Cookie PHPSESSID=whatever 

Authorization Digest
username="user", realm="My Site", nonce="value",
uri="script", algorithm=MD5, response="value", qop=auth,
nc=00000001, cnonce="value 

 ? 

What I?m not sure is
what the server is looking at.? The authorization value in the client
header? ?Is that dictating what should happen. Httpd is complaining wrong
Authentication Scheme, which makes me think server side Authenticate header,
which is what I was trying for a while until I realized I was on the client. 

Can I change the headers and
it will work?? Is this the right thing to do? 

I dabbled a little with
setting different Authorization header values. 

But, I need a break and
could use some advice. 

Michele 

 ?

What could you tell the OS/hardware/infrastructure support folks that 
would help make you more productive?

As great as PHP and Joomla are, there tends to be a divide in the folks 
who build the applications and those who support the servers the 
applications run on. My paid work is at the server level (Red 
Hat/Solaris) and I'm betting there are things my side could do better.

What would help you be more productive? What could keep things clear and 
clean so we all get to spend the weekends with family? How can the 
server teams contribute to environment sustainability?

    You've got to be systematic about how applications are installed and 
configured.

    Wordpress is a great example of what NOT to do.  It's easy to 
install and has a great user interface,  but it's a bitch to maintain.

    The Wordpress developers are always complaining that Wordpress users 
are slow to update Wordpress,  but Wordpress lacks the ability to easily 
test changes of configuration.  I'm not talking about that unit testing 
cult,  I'm talking about having the ability to ~move~ a wordpress blog 
by changing just a few lines of code.  For instance,  I should be able 
to copy

http://gen5.info/

to

http://test.gen5.info/

    install Wordpress 2.7 and check that it works with my templates and 
plug-ins.  Wordpress stores a large number of absolute urls that makes 
it difficult to do this:  yes,  you can migrate a Wordpress instance by 
doing a search-and-replace of all urls in the database,  but it's not a 
simple,  standard and supported procedure,  which is should be.

    In most cases there are three things you need to reconfigure to 
create a new instance of an application:

(1) database connection information
(2) the url where the application is on the web,  and
(3) the place in the filesystem where the application is stored

    If you can copy the db and the files,  then edit those three things 
in a single configuration file,  you can copy most applications in 
minutes.  Each developer can have his own copy of the system,  and you 
can have a place to stage changes.  You can move the system to a new 
server easily when the time comes.

    Lots of people are turning to server virtualization to get (some of) 
these benefits,  but they can be had much more easily by being just a 
little systematic -- while saving computer resources that would be 
wasted on multiple disk and ram copies of an operating system,  not to 
mention the cpu overhead of having to schedule everything twice.

implementing a solid, multi-phase 'development to production' system.

In my previous job there was a single system to go from development server
to production server - upload from the developement server to the production
server.  As with all companies, those in charge of giving the green light
for uploads had to view and approve pages/changes before it could go up.
When working on multiple tasks for the same website this became a very
visible PITA problem that stuck out its nose many many times.  It was made
even worse by the upper and middle management refusing to implement a 3
stage system that would allow for development, staging and production
servers - even though we had racks and racks of computers that ran VMWare
Virtual servers.

I supplied them with the easy to understand diagrams and how things would be
implemented and how the use of subversion, restricted access, etc could be
used to maintain integrity, and allow us to have a development environment,
a review/preview environment and the production environment and give us a
quick method to restore older versions of the site; and it all fell on deaf
ears.

I, and others, spent hundreds of hours verifying, double checking and
re-checking things on development and production and then ultimately have to
fix something on production because the production servers were a higher
version than the development version of php/mysql/etc.

so to make things easier, i suggest the following, which i feel are common
sense:

a) development, staging and production servers -- staging servers can all be
VMWare based servers.
b) use the same versions of software across all servers.

just my 2 cents

    Yeah,  yeah,  yeah  -- that's just what I mean.

    I've got no problem with the technology of server virtualization,  
but many organizations are looking for server virtualization as an 
alternative to doing things systematically rather than as a tool that 
furthers that goal.
   
    That said,  I've seen that most organizations are happy to do things 
the right way once people start to see the benefits.  It can take years 
to turn things around,  however,  and not everybody has the time.
