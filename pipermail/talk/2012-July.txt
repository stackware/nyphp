Hi,

Battle of Braces is a cross platform hackaton that take place in Meetup HQ
with great developers. Yesterday Round 1: Javascript was incredibly fun and
there were few very interesting application that might become a startup,
such as the winner Hackadoo, a split screen game where win who code faster
and OutToLunch <https://github.com/ShaunSpringer/OutToLunch>, the app all
the offices needs to organize where to go for lunch.

The Round 2: PHP - July 20, will be a great occasion to socialize with
other PHP fellows, challenge yourself as developer and as a team, learn and
discover, beers. To be more persuasive, there are prices, the winner of the
BOB will be presenting at the NY Tech Meetup.

I am searching for some good fellows to make a team and participate
together at the battle, I have already an project doable in one day but any
other idea is welcome.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Performance testing on Windows Server 2008 & MySQLi
	performance hit
Message-ID: <CACPvCE6fLLbg_525rY+RRHut0D3GfGLQCwtoJb+AvFQvYx36rg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I have two questions-

1) A client has requested that their virtual server be upgraded from 1gb to
2gb ram so that the application runs faster and can handle more users.
Before upgrading the server, I want to run performance tests to measure the
before / after effects.  Which tool would you recommend for this php
application which is on Windows Server 2008?

2) Part of the reason for upgrading is that the application has taken a
HUGE hit in performance after we updated mysql connections to mysqli and
moved most of the php files above the web root folder.  I researched online
for performance hits after moving to mysqli but no where found anyone
discussing such a drastic setback.  With xdebug, I see the mysqli
connections are the culprit and perform 2-4 times slower than before.  When
testing with the PHP MySQL Benchmark Tool v. 0.1 (
http://unbeknownst.net/?p=321) scripts, I don't see a big diff between
mysql and mysqli queries.  Anyone else seen this issue??

Thanks in advance for your feedback!!

1) http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html   This handy tool will
let you run some loads tests
2)  We're the standard mysql connections using persistent connections, also
have you though about using mysqlnd?

I haven't. What version of PHP are you using? And which driver are you
compiled against (libmysql, mysqlnd, etc)? Are the mysql and mysqli
differences on the same compile of php on the same machine? Or are they on
different boxes?

Hi Anthony,
I forgot to mention, with the upgrade, we also moved from php 5.3 to 5.4.
We are using mysqlnd 5.0.10 - 20111026 - $Revision: 323634 $.

Donald,
The tool you mentioned is for Apache servers, we are on IIS 7.



Thanks for your help.

That's a difference ;-)

Were you using mysqlnd before hand (under 5.3)? Or were you using libmysql?
Can you try switching back to libmysql...?

The way files are included can be a significant performance issue.

It's best to use full, true, paths when including files.  One strategy
I've used is having all scripts include one central config file via a
relative path.  Then in that script do this:

define('PATH_BASE', realpath(dirname(__FILE__));

Then all other includes/requires in the application should do:

require PATH_BASE . '/subdir/whatever/some_other_file.php'

This removes the need to use the include_path and simplifies the
operations PHP needs to do for caching file names and paths.

Also, carefully consider the order of entries in the include_path
setting.  Put the directories in there in order of most used first,
least used last.

The ab tools make request to the website using HTTP.  You can use it to
test any web server, not just Apache HTTPD servers.

Message-ID: <CAE1ELnLh6zaiecRZXP9k3nkjp10bdPHEq+kDHZZJiqh=Gp-oiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,
I'm developing an app store for a CMS to download modules, plugins and
themes and keep them updated automatically.

Each module, plugin or theme are compressed into a zip file.

The CMS can connect to the app store and download one module with an API
call. I was thinking to use file_get_contents, but may be Curl is more
appropriate, because I'd like to have the download progress and may be one
single login for multiple downloads.

Do you have any suggestion or better solutions?

Thanks,
Federico

Hi Federico:

You mean like PEAR?  Their old (pear.php.net) and new (pyrus at
pear2.php.net) systems have client and server side tools can be reused
in many ways.  There are other systems out there too.  Unless you feel
like making your own anyway, of course.

If you ever need to serve files up, check out mod_xsendfile for Apache
or similar functionality for Lighttpd or other web server of your
liking.

See you,

Hey Daniel,

is more similar to the modules repository of Wordpress.

Let me add more details, I'm developing a CMS and an "app store". The app
store is a repository where users can download plugins, modules and themes,
and even upload and share them, after a moderator approval.

Because I'll release the CMS open source my goal is a solution that works
in most PHP installation possible.

I've already implemented the download with Curl and it works well, so
should I still consider mod_xsendfile? And another question, is zlib the
best and most compatible solution to compress files?

Thanks

Hi Federico:

That's fine.  To be clear, I was not comparing your project to PEAR.  It
seems you may have interpreted it this way.  I was saying you might want
to use PEAR's client and server interfaces/software for your system.  I
hear the Pyrus stuff is pretty good.

You're serving up raw binary files from the file system.  Yes.

Yeah.

Got it. I want to have a solution on my server because some component
will be on sale.

Is modx_sendfile a default PHP module? What's the advantage respect
using just the headers function of PHP for file download?
Thanks

Ups, I just realized that the modx_sendfile is a solution for the
repository, not for the CMS installations, so yeah it does make sense
using it! Thanks again for the suggestion Daniel,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Knuth vols 1-4a; Right Read at this time?
Message-ID: <4FF83703.5020806@gmail.com>

Morning all! I'm happy to say that my programming growth hasn't yet been 
side tracked by the job search, relocation plans, or really hot weather. 
It's slow going, but going nonetheless.

I could use some experienced programmer wisdom on next steps. At the 
moment I'm working on a small PHP project. Design goals are 5.3 
compatible, use OOP as appropriate, and not nauseate real programmers 
who look at the code. I've also put it on SF.net and started using 
tickets for work tracking, a pseudo Kanban style queue, and David K. 
gave me some great UX feedback.

Being learning driven, I'm a bit lost wondering about my next step. One 
thought is to get Knuth's vols 1-4a and start on those. Another is to 
push towards the Zend ZCE in PHP; sort of "master one skill" before 
moving on to others. Or to learn more about support tools like TDD, and 
IDE bedsides vim, or other stuff.

In programming, I've done several "very small" projects in Tcl, PHP, 
Perl, Python, Shell, C. My skill level is highest in Shell and PHP but 
even those are "pick up the book every hour or so". I'd like to get to a 
point of being able to contribute to medium sized projects in either 
PHP, Python, Go, or C.

At this point I am aware of what little I do know but don't know what I 
don't know. Any recommendations on how to move up the professional 
programmer ladder?

Thanks!

Leam

For maximum compatibility, you should build it around http://getcomposer.org/

That project is poised to be the rubygems of PHP, so that would give
you access to all the components the Zend / Symfony / Every Other
Framework people are cooking up, plus you could host your own composer
repo for your CMS's packages.

Let someone else worry about the downloader :)

Using composer is a great idea to keep updated all the vendors package!
For the other components I'm thinking to a model like iTunes Store or
Wordpress Plugins, where developers upload their components, and only the
one approved become available to download.

Thanks

Message-ID: <4FFDE17E.8070601@gmail.com>

When building lots of forms, irrespective of form size or complexity if 
you need to store options where do you do it?  I have seen many examples 
but I guess this boils down to what is a best practice? The way things 
are currently done is that all form options are stored in a static array 
in the ecosystem and then called upon when the form needs to be built.

For example, we ask users to select their Ethnicity when filling out one 
of our forms.  This includes the values: Prefer not to say, African 
American, Asian, White, East Indian, Hispanic / Latino, Middle Eastern, 
Native American, Other.  Where would you store these options?

Is this a matter of personal preference or is there a best practice I 
missed over the years?

I would personally store any form options in a database table, I would have
a form table and then a form_options table and get all options by form id.

Where you store them is a matter of style. I like using blocks of JSON
for this, personally, but others would cringe at the parsing overhead.

But however you keep them, I think the ideal solution needs to
accommodate two things:

1) Localization/internationalization - if you're just storing American
English values, you're limiting yourself. The labels for an Ethnicity
selector can even vary region by region within the US. You may need to
keep the choices the same in order to normalize the database, but the
labels need to be translatable.

2) Meta-data about the selector itself. Multiple choice? An Other...
field? Is it ideally a <select> or a series of radio buttons /
checkboxes? Is there an instruction that goes along with the field? A
default value?

This is the first Alpha version, so expect great improvements in the next

I prefer to create a "settings" table where I store all the bits and pieces
that need to be configurable but are not that frequently changed.

If you want to make everything translatable, I would not tie it to a
settings table but rather set up a global translate procedure that would
apply to these settings but also to other elements of your application.

I have found that deciding on some general rules around these issues can
make your life much easier. Jumping from project to project and realizing
that the countries are always in the settings table and always called in a
curtain way can make you day and save you some hours in debugging and
developing.

It depends.

For dynamic form I prefer to use 3 tables
form(form_id,name,action)
field(field_id,form_id,name,type : [text,textarea,checkbox,select ... ],
default,validation : [required,max=,min=,email,numeric,alphanumeric ... ],
option ), option say if the value are coming from field_value, another
table, or array.
field_value(field_value_id,field_id,name,value)

Another pain in the neck is to save the input from a form, in that case you
may need a table with the static information and one with the dynamic
information, for example:
result(form_id, firstname,lastname...)
result_field(form_id,name,value)

Or if you want to save with dynamic fields I suggest to use RedBean, an ORM
that will save your time.
Also to create the form you need to create a form generator, if you are
lazy you can use mine:

because I'm moving the server... check in 1 hour or 2)

This is an area where a flexible document database like MongoDB makes things a lot simpler. One document stores all of the configuration for the form and one collection can hold submissions with any variation of dynamic fields in them.

This post from NYTimes was inspiration to me a couple years ago: http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/building-a-better-submission-form/

Hi Everyone,
Just to give an update on this old topic, I 'regained' performance on my
php application by eliminating all calls to the old mysql connector (I was
using it for the array_map(mysql_real_escape_string($x) functionality).

Also to measure performance I created test scripts that run through the
entire application with xdebug on.


Thanks all for your suggestions!

Hello Everyone,

I have around 14 years experience with PHP/MySQL and currently found that I
will have quite a bit of free time that I will need to fill.  Probably
around 20 hours per week.
I could use the extra cash for savings so I thought I would first reach-out
to the people on the list that helped me out a lot through the years.

You can see my resume (a bit outdated) at http://www.josephcrawford.com/

We can discuss rates and project details via phone after 6pm EST.

This same question comes up regularly, so much so that the guys on the 
Ruby list built a Google Map:

Good Morning Everyone,

     Does anyone know of any front-end developer specific list I can
post too? I tried the NYPHP Front-End list, but I guess it has been
inactive for some time now. Thanks in advance.

Wow, I just discover about that list. Anyway frontend is generic, so you
may want to join a a specific argument such as HTML/CSS, javascript,
jQuery, responsive design, on LinkedIn you find many groups, although you
have to deal with trollers. If you find a good list or group please let me
(us) know!

If you have a specific question, stackoverflow is great - http://stackoverflow.com/.

I have a jsonpath filtering question and I couldn't find the answer I
was looking for on stackoverflow, but I guess scenarios like this is
why people initially post on stackoverflow in the first place. I might
as well just give that a shot.

Federico, you are right and maybe that's why the list is no longer.
People are going to more specific lists for help.  Like having a
"back-end list" probably wouldn't work either. You would get all types
of people posting questions for any type of framework in any language.
