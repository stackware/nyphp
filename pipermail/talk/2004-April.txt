Subject: [nycphp-talk] memory_get_usage() on win32
Message-ID: <20040401174537.GA19047@panix.com>

Hi Folks:

Someon reported a bug in DB about a memory leak 
(http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=1112)

Their example uses memory_get_usage(), which isn't enabled on Win32
systems (unless, I guess, I compile my own with the --enable-memory-limit
configuration option).  Any ideas how I can track memory usage some other
way via PHP?

Know what, it probably doesn't matter.  I've watched the process via the
Task Manger's process list (Windows 2000 Pro) and the memory usage doesn't
increase even after several itterations of the loop.  So he may be having
a problem due to his OS/PHP/MySQL combination.

Anyone feel like testing it on other platforms?

Other thoughts?

Thanks,

--Dan

Problem with most online translators is that they do "machine-level" 
translation, that is, word-for-word translation, which is impossible to 
do grammatically correctly from English to Spanish and then from English 
to Swedish and from English to Japanese, as each language has its own 
grammatical, syntactical and conjugational construct.  Best approach is 
a "human-level" translation, where via locale-database marrying allows 
for human translators to enter a phrase into a db that would be pulled 
according to locale, so that you would have:

English: Hello, how are you?

Into Swedish: Hej hej, hur m&#229;r du?

Into Japanese: Ohayo/Konnichiwa/Konbamwa, ikaga desu ka?

Do any of the aforementioned PHP tools do human-level translation, 
that's been something I can't find online, just information on 
"machine-level" style, which is IMHO a waste of translation.

That would indeed be a problem, if this were true.

Yes,
for one large project (domain name registrar) we had a team of
translators who entered the translations for the site so that we could
have the entire site in 15 different languages.
Be careful with Japanese however as they have seven levels of business
formality so if you are running an online business with this it is
something to be careful of.

Your logic is flawed:

1. "online translators" == "PHP-based translators"

There's more to the Web than PHP.

2. "human-level translation" == everything that's not "word-for-word
translation"

I think it's safe to assume that there are many different approaches, and
"word-for-word translation" is probably the most flawed. This is why you
are wrong to suggest that most online translators use this approach.

Based on your assumption, I bet you were curious to know why sites like
Google only offered translation to/from only a few languages. :-)

At last! A topic I know a little bit about, being a full-time court
interpreter (Spanish<>English) for the US District Court, Southern
District of New York.

If you care about quality, use humans. The state of the machine
translation art still isn't up to the task of translating anything but the
most simple-minded of texts, and even then it needs to be checked
thoroughly by a qualified human.

Modern translators have increased their productivity with Computer
Assisted Translation (CAT) tools, things that do stuff like sentence
memory and terminology database management, watch you work and pop up to
offer to continue some sentence you're writing -- think code completion.
But that's not Machine Translation (MT).

Yeah, boyeeeeeeee. Bring the flame war! Insult each other in all different
languages so that the insulted party has to use some low-end MT tool to
try to figure out what the insult was.

Nope.  Just build a homegrown PHP-based human translation tool to handle 
insult phrases in multiple languages!!  Kiitos, Jumalan siunausta!

I did some test on Linux/mysql4.0.18/php4.3.4

I rewrote the program a bit though , see below.
The memory climbed from initial of Virtual 26680 Resident 9460 to Virtual
26796 Resident 9488. So that is 116KB virual mem increas and 28KB resident
memory increase. What interesting it climbs gradually for about first 200
iterations and then stops climbing. Also after DB stuff is done and only
fake work is done then it does not affect the memory size.

I didnt not use memory_get_usage because my php is not compiled for it. I
dont think this is a memroy leak because it seems like normal operation of
php garbage collection. I would expect the internal tables to grow to some
initial size and not be released at all. Just because a reference is unset
does not mean php has to release the actual memory. Maybe someone with
better internal knowledge of php can understand this better.

My modified test program:
 #!/usr/bin/php -q
<?php
include 'DB.php';
$db_object = &DB::connect('mysql://root:secret at localhost/test',TRUE);
$db_object->setFetchMode(DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC);
   $count = 0;
   $ref= null;
   $row = null;
function fake_work(){
    $t = array();
    for($x=0;$x < 150; $x++){
        $t[] = $x + 4 + time() + count($t) -
strlen(md5(uniqid(rand()).time())) + rand()%20;
    }
    for($x=149; $x >= 0; $x--){
        unset($t[$x]);
    }
    unset($t);
}
while($count <= 500)
{
    usleep(5000);//dont go crazy
    $res=&$db_object->query( "select linkid from test2 where linkid=2" );
    $row=&$res->fetchRow();
    //this is a dumbed down version, but does the memleak
    $res->free();
    unset($row);
    unset($res);
    $count++;
    //lets do some other fake work
    fake_work();

    echo "tick $count \n";
     //echo memory_get_usage()."\n";
}
fake_work();
unset($db_object);
for($x = 0; $x < 100; $x++)
{   usleep(5000); fake_work(); }
//its kind of useless because it does not let php run
echo "end of run sleeping for 5 seconds\n";
sleep(5);
?>

They have the Simpsons in Montreal and it's in French. It's really
eerie hearing the characters with different voices.

How do you say D'oh! with a French accent?

Hi Folks:

I already thanked Felix directly.  Wanted to let y'all know that it turns
out the person was using an outdated version of DB.  They upgraded and 
everything is fine.

Thanks,

Heh, I would toss in my favourite Swiss-German insult, but there's no 
written form.  Suffice it to say that the literal translation is "Lick 
my jacket."

Gotta love those Swiss.

Seems like an idea for a really useful web service.  A repository for human
translations.  Get a group of people checking every day for new phrases
which could use translation, and eventually have a database of well
translated phrases in well.. as many languages as you can get translators.
New phrase requests that haven't been translated get added to a list of 'new
phrases' to be translated at the moderators next login.  Could be very
useful for the entire web community.

Oh, if I only had time, funding and more beer.

If I were to setup a ringtone service and maybe SMS on my

how Would I put the ringtones onto the site? Would I be charged for 
each ringtone/SMS sent? if so, how much? Would I have to pay royalties 
to music companies? If so, how would I do this? I would like customers 
of my site to be able to just select a tune for their phone on my site and 
type in their phone number.

As always i try this php list for information.....Does anybody have 
information on such a subject?

Thank you,

It's probably simpler and faster to go through another company that's
already doing it. I sell ringtones through 9Square.

Message-ID: <005601c41876$415b8160$6400a8c0@thinkpad>

i think my design in something might have been flawed ...

i spent a few days creating a simple DTD/Schema for a site only to go back
to a full database and the resources seems to be bogging down the results
page w/ alot of queries for single pages ... which is fine since it just
started ... but then i realized alot of certain content even though it was
relational was pretty boring and static and when it dropped into an archive
it was such a "waste" to even have in the db.

so the question is if alot of people just leave it for the sake of it being
in the database because it should be there or would it be better to dump it
all out to XML and parse from there (simple_xml is so fast)?  is this a
common scenerio?  i dont think this is a db vs. xml discussion but rather a
"long term thinking" resource strategy question ...

thanks for any input ...

Keep stuff in the DB.  Who knows what you'll want to do with the data in 
the long run.  Perhaps aggregate your own statistics from them.

For server load efficiency, dynamically generate static HTML pages via a
cron job.

If you have stuff in the database that should not be in the database then
why just not put it in there in the first place. For example if someone
uploads files to a site you may not want to put it in the database but
just store the files on the drive as well regular files. No xml needed :)

If you really must have all this stuff in the database and your site is
slow you can do many things to improve performance. Here is a few things
that come to my mind.
1.rewrite queries to make them faster
2.use application caching for example pear::Cache_Lite
3.pregenerate pages, this can be done like a caching too (i think this is
the way very busy sites do it)

You were pretty clear while explaining what you need.
Once you are done with auto/manual translation (e.g. you got translated
text), you may consider to use my GPL software, PanamaSuite
(http://panamasuite.sourceforge.net/), which is REALLY useful in order to
manage languages. This software assumes you already got translated text;
it is ready for 40 preconfigured languages you can manage via the
control-panel. All text is stored in database (MySQL for now); each text
region is callable via a needle you define for it, e.g.:
echo $panamasuite->getText('WELCOME_TEXT');
where `WELCOME_TEXT' is the text displayed in the active language stored
in session. Languages can be deactivated (when you still not have a ready
translation), modified (modifying, for istance, the text direction, the
code page, etc.) and created. Each needle you plan to insert in your PHP
application must be mapped in database via the proper control panel. A
`security filter' allows you to switch on/off some actions like
delete/modify needle.
Last version of PanamaSuite is 0.8.0 (Thu Feb 12 16:34:28 CET 2004).
Let me know if you find it useful.

NYPHP is in the process of creating some new 
seminars in PHP related subjects
(in addition to RAMP and the two-day training, 
<plug> which is next scheduled for April 19 - 20 </plug> )

One such seminar which is under consideration is 
a 3-hour seminar ( in the evening ) with Chris 
Shiflett. Some of the topics covered would be 
material in Chris's upcoming book -- and a preview 
(not the whole talk) of some material he will be 
delivering at OSCON in Portland.

If anyone would be interested in attending a 
seminar like this, email  training at nyphp.org with 
'Security Seminar' in the subject line.

Further, if there is some training that you would like 
to see given by NYPHP, mail your suggestions to the 
dev list (NYPHP-Development -- dev at lists.nyphp.org)

Sorry about that. It was late. I should have been more thorough...

http://www.9squared.com

Essentially, I find that going through them cuts a lot of cost.

1. Customer Service. Sometimes people don't receive their ringtones and
then you have to help them. Depending on the customer, this can take
anywhere from 1 hour to a week before it's determined how to solve the
problem.

2. Licensing. If you do the tones, you have to contact each label and
publishing company to get a license for the songs. You will be paying
royalties per song. I can imagine it would get very techinical if you
were dealing with songs that contain samples because now you have to
contact a third party for music clearance.

One thing I like about 9Squared is that it's seamless. My site is
http://www.sohh.com and my ringtone site is http://ringtones.sohh.com.
9Square took my template and wrap their content into it. (I have to
update it.) On my end, I just send my users e-mails letting them know
that I have new ringtones on my site. 9Squared also sells games and
other things for the cellphones. For the work I put into it (30 minutes
a week), I make a descent buck.

If you're interested in training, please investigate RAMP. RAMP has
been on semi-freeze until we can get enough people to sign up for the
courses.

Alternatively, many of the RAMP instructors are probably willing to do
in house training. If you can gather up enough people, this may be
worth your while and provide you with greater control over the
material and schedule.

Even worse, they're using the current value of seconds since epoch as
the sales rank. :)

I know the book exists, since I have a copy, but I can't swear it's
actually made its way to bookstores from the warehouse.

I'm working on developing a client extranet, and I'm having trouble with one

In the past, our company (we do web design) has uploaded client beta sites
to .htaccess - protected directories. We sent the client a link to the beta
site with a user name and password to login. Now, we want to send all
clients to one site where they can login and be directed to a "project
status" page that gives them all the latest info on their project and links
to beta pages/sites. For this part, I would like to use some sort of session
control/authentication.

The problem is that the "beta" sites are not necessarily written in php, and
we don't want to have to add an authentication script to every page we
upload for a client to view and approve. Furthermore, we don't want to make
clients login twice - first to the main extranet page, and second to a
password-protected directory.

Does anyone know a solution to this problem, or know of a way to pass a
userid and password from php to the .htaccess protection?


Many thanks,
Dave

Hi David,

If you don't want to add any extra script(s) to your demo sites codes to
control access to them, unfortunately there's no solution for IE users.
Since they couldn't fix a bug  in IE (which allows people to change the
browsed web site's name appearing in the address bar), Microsoft recently
(Feb 04) disabled usage of the addresses of the format
http://username:password at www.sitename.com in IE.
They have been used to pass username and password to webserver for htaccess
based authentication the way you wanted to implement.

Kerem

Lately I've been using an Apache SetHandler directive to run all 
requests through a PHP script that sets up the session, handles 
authentication, and wraps the requested resource in a dynamic header and 
footer before sending it to the client (with appropriate Content-type 
and other headers).

This works even if the resource is a Perl or Python or whatever script-- 
as long as the PHP handler knows (1) that it's a script and (2) how to 
execute the script, it can deliver the output back to the client. You 
can use a $_GET var to request the source instead.

There is support in PHP for working with Basic Auth, but I find 
.htaccess/.htpasswd files tedious to maintain.

Its been hard to do, Ive tried on my laptop a few times to setup case
scenerios with the SecurityFocus/BugTraq lists ... what Im was thinking was
a presentation with the "Top 5 PHP Security Blunders from Popular Packages"
and actually show (not just tell) why a patch is in order to better
understand how not to create the scenerio in the first place.

A little like a before and after ... the only problem being that some of the
more dangerous areas in XSS and SQLI have to have specific parameters which
goes from hacker scanning to exploit itself.  I was only able to setup one
in which every users hash of phpbb was exposed and brute cracked but Im not
sure if that is interesting enough ...

Okay, so everything in a given directory gets sent through a script that you
specify in the SetHandler, right?

Sorry, I don't follow - what is the "resource" you are referring to? Would
this work even if the beta site or page is a web application with
authentication scripts of its own?

Yep. The downside is that your script has to be smart enough to 
reimplement the parts of Apache that it's taking over -- directory 
listings, file metadata (content-type, size, last-modified, etc).

Don't know? Don't see why not, though.
Perhaps what you really want in that case is to have the site act as a 
proxy to your development server.

Ha. Yeah, a PHP book with that publication date couldn't even cover 
exciting new PHP features like the "<?php" start tag.

It sounds he wants what I want, a little walk-through, e.g., in high-level
pseudo-code, &/or a URL pointing to a tutorial on Apache handlers. Sounds
like an interesting (dare I say cool) technique.

There is an interesting maybe alternative I have not tried it yet.
Using mod_fastcgi write a php stand alone script that does
authentication/autherization using these directives:
FastCgiAccessChecke
FastCgiAuthenticator
FastCgiAuthorizer
This is basicaly a way to plug into the apache basic authentication
without implementing a handler.

It is not really advisable to use Database for basic things like Static text
and Images where you can effectively use File system. Why do we need to
store all translations into DB? Suppose a 100 page website containing 50
lines in each page which is to be displayed in 40 languages, count how many
database queries you will need to generate to display for 1 connection only.
Even if you have proper load balancing applied to your website, it won't be
effective solution.

For multilingual websites, core problem is displaying Static text and Images
which should load dynamically according to selected language. While user
defined Data appear as it is. We had similar problem 4-5 years ago when we
started developing websites in PHP especially for European countries. And
everybody knows how many type of varieties in Languages available in those
countries there are. (We have been using Temple-pHp method which keeps GUI
and Logic separate.) We solved our problem in following way.

We stored all Static text, which we usually keep embedded with coding, into
separate Language files like "1.inc, 2.inc, 3.inc" which can be available in
any pHp script. While in coding we used variables of corresponding
text/words derived from those language files.

For example 1 file called welcome.php displays some word like "Hello" but
different words in different languages.

<?php echo "Hello"  ?>    //English
<?php echo "Hola"  ?>    //Spanish
<?php echo "Foo..."  ?>    //Some Foo language

But you know you need to configure your script in such a way that output
will be in different language. Hence extract language specific words from
your code and place them into 1.inc, 2.inc, 3.inc to N.inc in form of Array
values. Here 1,2, 3 to N you can set in form of variable (mostly as Session
Variable) for different languages and can include respective language file
in your code just like normal pHp code. See example of 1.inc, 2.inc ...
3.inc below.

<?php $cap[welcome]="Hello";  .....other words/texts/characters.......... ?>
//1.inc
<?php $cap[welcome]="Hola";  .....other words/texts/characters.......... ?>
//2.inc
<?php $cap[welcome]="Foo...";  .....other words/texts/characters..........
?>    //3.inc

Do not use separate variables for separate values, instead use Arrays,
otherwise your stock of variables in mind will exhaust quickly and it may be
possible that at the time of developing code you may not find any variables
to use :). Advantage of using Array is, you can properly control your all
language specific text/words/sentences if required, and some nasty user
can't manipulate your original variables by using browser's GET method.
(However, mostly it is not possible, but need to take care well) plus you
need not worry about unsetting them 1 by 1.

Hence, welcome.php becomes like below.

<?php

//Prints "Hello", "Hola" or "Foo" according to value of variable $LANG which
can be from 1 to N.
include_once $LANG.".inc";    //$LANG would be your Session/Cookie variable

echo $cap[welcome];

?>

You can apply same solution for displaying images dynamically as well. But
for that you need to store language specific images into separate folder
like by giving name like 1 2 and 3 and, same we used $LANG above, can
display images dynamically like below.

.... some code...

echo "<IMG SRC=\"PATH/..../$LANG/foo.gif\">";

.... some code...

There are many advantages of using above system like:

# As you keep language specific part separate from Code, you can
add/edit/modify your text very easily and you need not to worry abuts mix-up
of hard coded text and your code.

# Just give print out of your primary language to translator for different
languages and he/she can write *Effective* translation in his/her language
without any problem.

# You are avoiding valuable DB connections and consumption of lot of
processing power for displaying static text.

# This type of translation, as done by Human, gives you power to display
type of text/sentences/phrases of your choice without worrying of Computer
Assisted Translation (CAT) tools. Remember Machine level Translations can
never take place of Human Translations.

# You can add/remove as many languages as possible very quickly and in
effective manner.

I think that a file inclusion based solution for translation is a good
choice (like phpMyAdmin does, for istance), but a more flexible way is a
DB-based solution. In particular (PanamaSuite):

1) The customer who administers his website/application can operate easily
with a secure, DB based control-panel which allows him to easily add new
languages, TRANSPARENTLY modifying page contens WITHOUT dealing with the
code in include files; PanamaSuite was built with usability in mind, so a
PanamaSuite based application can be administered by a non-programmer
person;

2) the customer has got an internal, DB based search engine which allows
him to find quickly what he is searching for thru a transparent DB query;

3) using a database is really better when you need to add a language,
WITHOUT UPLOADING ANYTHING, so you don't need to make a folder writeable
by the user/group of e.g. Apache;

4) I have built several web applications with PanamaSuite: none of them
were slow.

5) when you add a language (a column in the database) and you make it
active, the rest of work is made automatically: the selectboxes are
auto-populated, you need only to fill with static text the object-contents
in database via the USER FRIENDLY control panel.

6) with PanamaSuite you can customize a language as well. Text direction
(`ltr' vs `rtl'), codepages etc. It is more flexible IMHO than a
filesystem based translation.
PLEASE NOTE: PanamaSuite DOES NOT CREATE AUTO-TRANSLATED TEXT. The static
text must be inserted MANUALLY.

Thanks a lot for your time, Matteo Rinaudo

There is nothing that techincaly stops php being used that way.
There is sockets api's extensions. I dont know which is most stable though.

Memory leaks may be a problem.  You can certainly do it but be prepared to
restart the thing daily.

Not so, at least not now:
http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-4.php#4.3.5
I have had php server/client apps that have run for over a hundred days, and one of those 
was a forked mailserver I wrote I called honeymail (see http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/index.php?view=honeymail for
incomplete source, I never have released the source in full as it was never finished to where
I wanted it to be).
Another I have written is a bot that scours the soulseek network and populates soulreactor.com..
(but I have not been keeping up on that recently as that one hogs resources as translating peoples 30,000
MP3 collection has a tendency to take up a lot of memory. It ran for two months solid with no problems.)
The main issue with people having to restart is that they are not utilizing posix functions.
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.posix.php and are trying to run an app in linear mode vs forked mode
(such as how apache and mysql run).
Anyway, PHP works just fine for a server apps, it not the "preferred" choice for most, but for me, I like it.

Hi all,
I have released another app you may be interested in if you run a
server. It is called tLimit and can be found at tlimit.com

Basically, using mod_rewite and .htaccess to build a very nice bandwidth
limiter 100% in PHP/MySQL with online demo that you can start downloads
and view them from the admin section. You can dynamically throttle the
downloads and even kill them in real time.  

Anyway, as always, any thoughts would be appreciated.

Better yet, locales:

en_US.inc, en_CA.inc, en_UK.inc.

If you're going the array route, I actually prefer storing message
catalogs as object properties because you get inheritance for
free.

Then your en_UK catalog can inherit from en_US and just redefine the
works the British misspell, like colour and lift, instead of
containing an almost complete duplicate of the American catalog.

Jim Winstead (of MySQL, AB and also formerly a big PHP guy) is talking
about this topic at OSCon this year:

Ok what you saying is to use a forking server.
Can you say why specificaly why non-forking server is bad ?
Is it because the thread support is not as good ?

Hi all,

There are loads of Authorize.Net AIM scripts out there - some free, and
some commercial.  Not being able to find really want I wanted, and not
willing to shell out money for a script I've never seen the code of,
I'll be writing my own.

My implementation will be that of a freely available PCOM
(http://pcoms.net) and I wanted to ping this list to get some feedback.
For those that have used existing Authorize.Net scripts, what has been
lacking?  What are good points; bad points?  After I'm finished with the
PCOM and it's operational, I'll post the code to http://pcomd.net so
that anyone is welcome to use it.

Hey,
A forked server is preferred because of the nature of them and ways to
have built-in limits. Sure you have to figure out who is the session
leader and child/parent relationships, etc but that setup work is worth
it. Using shared memory each instantiation of the program can have
mutual access to data and if it fails/dies it has no effect on the
others. So I guess the answer is encapsulation and that is why they are
used in high-end/high user apps like Apache and MySQL. Threading
requires more work to set up than forking, and in my opinion forking is
more intuitive for the programmer, so therefore is the better option.

***rant below, feel free to ignore***

PHP handles a most if not all of it's own memory clean-up, and for
logging I suggest using register_shutdown_function() and have your main
logging and cleanup code there. 
A long time ago, I used to program in ASP and they had a function called
option_explicit which if used, makes you declare variables or would spit
out errors. I always felt it made you a better programmer as you kind of
need to think ahead a bit and once you do that, cleanup is easier as you
can look at your declaratives and you know what to empty.

In PHP functions like empty
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.unset.php
Serve this.

I also suggest setting error_reporting to E_ALL if you are concerned
with looking at your code for memory leaks and finding out just how
loose your programming style is. 
At my work, a lot of the newer PHP guys had never worked with any lower
level languages and it amazes me that they are missing a lot of the
foundation knowledge for how/why things are a certain way. They have no
knowledge of certain base functions and only sketchy data structures
understanding. But then this is always the way these things go.. (back
in my day: snow both ways uphill etc. or the programmer equiv of PDP,
punch cards and assembly on green-line paper). 
Anyway, I digress.

I like to correct you if I may on this point. I think and correct me if i
am wrong that Mysql uses threading as the basis for handling user
connections.
Apache defaults to prefork mpm but in Apache2 the worker mpm is thread

white issue although I dont think its even the issue. Usually the debate

I belive php uses Garbage Collection which is reference count based. If
all references to some variable are lost it will be eventually cleaned up.
I dont belive unset() is neccessary in PHP code although at times could be
useful maybe.

I'm not completely clear on what you're trying to do.  But perhaps it's 
something like this?

if (isset($today) && preg_match('\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}', $today)) {
   $where = " WHERE date='" . $today . "'";
} elseif (isset($month) && preg_match(...similar to above...)) {
   $where = " WHERE date='" . $month . "'";
} else {
   $where = '';
}

$sql = 'SELECT * FROM calendar' . $where;

See you,

C use to be the predominant language of choice for server application. The
main reason is performance.  C++ and Java also are popular because they
can provide performance similar to C  but better at managing complexity.

As natural progression of things people now want to implement server
application in scripting languages because performance is not a probelem
anymore since machines are so much faster. Peoples time costs more then
hardware.  I think this is the right direction. We may not see apache
being replaced by an implementation in a scripting language maybe for
years it will happen eventually.

The question is which scripting language to use? In the begining php was
not intended to be used that way. It start out as a simple way to add
dynamic content to html. But people like php so much they want to use it
for everything.  This is why we have extensions that wrap basic system
function to give us a way to do anything with the language. Threading is
really central to some languages ex Java. In php it is not much important
except in situations where php runs as a deamon process. Php has not been
used that way in general but now it will be used because people like to.
Threading has been around for years except its new to php its not new in
general.

I am still not convinced PHP is the best scripting language for server
tasks. There is other options like Perl,Python,Tcl,Ruby etc. Those
languages were general purpose langs from the very begining.  I wonder
what other people think on this.

This is one of the reasons we started the Roadsend PHP Compiler project
(www.roadsend.com). There is more and more demand for using PHP as a
general purpose programming language.

As you mention there are plenty of other languages (scripting or 
otherwise) one could use to accomplish these things, but nonetheless the 
demand to do it in PHP is there.

Hi Folks,

My boss got an idea.  Somebody suggested to him that our underfunded
non-profit should start our own web portal full of news headlines and
stories related to the issues we deal with, plus lots of news stories we
create about our own work.  Then, on top of that, we could also do like free
email hosting like Yahoo does, and let people check their email online and
whatever.  Then, also, we could have free web hosting for people who are
affiliated with our organization's work, or people who just like the issues
we stand for;  we give away the hosting service and then we get people to
upgrade to a paid service and -- get this! -- we can actually start making
money at this, which is good since we certainly need money, and people will
probably be okay to pay us since they already agree with our ideals.

The department director who brought this up honestly thinks there's
potential here.  I, on the other hand, honestly believe that probably 50
people in Westchester county independently "discovered" this same "great
plan" on the same day as this person, probably also while in the shower or
on the toilet.

Would anybody out there like to tell me how wonderful this plan is?  I'm
already looking for ways to talk my boss down off this ledge before he
jumps.

Hmmm, remain calm. Running an ISP is not for the feint of heart.

It's a great idea if your mission is to provide support for other 
non-profits and birds-of-a-feather, because then you can devote the time 
and energy it will take to actually pull that off in a way that doesn't 
leave a sour taste in everyone's mouth.  In other words, your boss will 
have no trouble providing for all the staff required to form a 
profitable service provider with 24 hour support.

If that's not in your mission statement, then it could still be a 
middling idea if you know and trust your own ISP and want to form a 
partnership with them, and they have the ability to cobrand their services.

It's sounds like a lousy idea in any other case. Find good hosting and 
email, then spread the word to friends. But stay out of selling it 
without a sober assesment of what's involved. (Read up on griefers and 
trolls and spammers if you need more cynicism.)

Also, without knowing the scope of your organization, it may be possible
that the information you place in a members-only area could be construed as
data that affects business across the entire market you are trying to
support as an association/organization - down that road lies lawsuits for
anti-trust, monopolistic practices, etc.

Fun, huh?

So yes, based on the fact that you have no budget to properly address this
(and hey, if it was a good idea you'd be asking us how to accomplish it,
instead of what was asked), I'd steer clear of the nightmare looming
overhead...

I would say your boss, "ask yourself these questions.":

1) Is it reinventing the wheel?
2) Will it really make money? 
3) How many other sites are doing 'exactly' this same thing?
4) Is it worth the investment of time and resources, will your return recoup this investment quickly?
5) Are you prepared to invest a lot in advertising to bring the people.
6) Overall, what can you give people that they cannot get elsewhere.

Just some ideas that I would bring up in a meeting for a "portal" site.

Yeah, I believe he actually knows he doesn't have these answers, he's
probably hoping I have some ideas.  I think that some of us in the
non-profit world hold on to the concept that like-minded people will be
willing to part with money for some particular product or service just
because we're a "good cause."  I personally believe that's a weak position.

I think for this I just need to get some clear black-and-white sample
numbers together, do the math for him, write down the hard questions, and
then give it back to him and let him take it where he wants.  Unfortunately
I claim zero business accumen, and I have never even looked into a project
like this.  If anybody wants to suggest some keywords for googling or maybe
a link to somebody's experiences with this kind of thing, that would be a
good starting place, and anyway he may be satisfied with whatever I come up
with out of my own common sense and a little imagination.

Thanks,
Allen

The other angle on this.  If it would make money, and it's highly 
unlikely, and it's got a sufficiently low barrier to entry that your 
"average" NPO could implement it, then there would be hundreds / 
thousands of organizations doing this.

Free email hosting is a bad idea.  You will loose money doing free 
email hosting.

If I was you, I'd ask the boss to state how much s/he is currently 
spending for a similar service.  If the answer is 0 then there's your 
hard data.  If the answer is  more than 0, then you can do the work to 
realize that this would be a big hole in the ground that sucks in money 
and returns headaches.

I have started and run and ISP (not currently doing this)
I have started and run a web hosting (not currently doing this)

You're not going to make money offering either of the two services.

If the content you create is valuable, then you *might* be able to sell 
it.  *might*.

You can't do what yahoo or hotmail does. If you are google you can.

You can setup a single email server it will be able to service a couple
hundred or more accounts and possibly also web hosting.
You will have to pay for server and bandwidth.
Server+RAID ~ 2K (dont get cheap on RAID)
Bandwidth ~ $100/month

Make sure to give the account to people your org knows in person or else
you will get spammers.  You will need someone tending to the server
because some user may catch one of those nasty Windows worms and someone
needs to be there to disable their account. Additionaly patching need and
other admin taks need done.

At small scale there is nothing wrong with doing this service. At Yahoo
level that is just dreams.

Hey there.

I am having a frustrating time just moving a site between two servers 
to which I have no SSH access.  So, I have to do all the MySQL stuff 
through phpMyAdmin.

Thing is, phpMyAdmin is dumping things in a format that it itself cannot read!

It is not quoting timestamp field values, so the attempt at 
reimporting through the SQL command feature in phpMyAdmin fails.

Am I missing some really obvious option or something?

Im not sure which version you are using, I had same issues w/ comments
before, might be worth it to upgrade to latest ... but there are 2 options
(and some debug options):

[ x ] Enclose table and field names with backquotes
[ x ] Complete inserts

Big deal.

NYPHP originally implemented this, and it turned out not to be viable...
even for the traffic we were getting at the time.  It's quite possible
it's improved since then...

What's better?  Nothing that we could find, and thus there's been a long
standing project to build a better one.

This is fixed in PHP 5/MySQL 4.1/mysqli, so eventually this problem
will go away. In the meantime, I would try feeding in chunks
bit-by-bit, seeing where the SQL causes a barf, and looking if there's
something obvious you can fix.

This was exactly like my question in which it pertains to data which becomes
extremely static over time in which case does it make sense that your DB is
filling up on your storage vs. having your static files fill up on you.

Hey guys:

I don't think I was clear enough in my original email: I know what 
the problem is.  phpMyAdmin isn't spitting out INSERT statements that 
MySQL accepts.  It is spitting out this:

INSERT INTO `cat_49` (`cat_49_id`, `cat_49_content_area`, 
`cat_49_parent`, `cat_49_name`, `cat_49_description`, 
`cat_49_sort_num`, `cat_49_active`, `cat_49_added`, `cat_49_updated`) 
VALUES (1, 49, 0, 0x414652494341, '', 0, 'y', '2004-01-05 09:34:22', 
2004-01-06 13:03:44);

Notice that the last field, a timestamp field, is not quoted.

Even if I just paste ONE of these INSERTs into phpMyAdmin on the 
other side, it fails.  If I quote the timestamp value, it works.

I have all the options I can find set to quote things.  I even looked 
through the config file.

Isn't this a bug?

I guess my only option is to just grep search and replace, or wade 
through the phpMyAdmin source and change how it dumps timestamp 
fields.  I am dealing with the latest "stable" version of phpMyAdmin, 
which I downloaded and installed today.  It is 2.5.6.

Absolutely... but there are different ways to slice it.

1) cache hits in memory, then batch load them into a DB so that you're
not having to hit the DB on every banner load

2) use MySQL's heap tables, then do a batch load

3) cache hits into a file, then batch load

Or some variation/combo thereof.

All that said, this wasn't our problem, and probably not a problem
except for those very highly trafficked sites there seem to be so many
of.

Our issue was the loading of the actual banner.  At the time we deployed
phpadsnew, the graphic itself was being streamed out of the database,
through php, and finally to the browser.  Again, this didn't end up
being a performance problem; however, the problem was that the banners
had a visible "fill" effect when the page loaded, and it caused a
noticeable delay for page loads.  This might have been something fixed
up in later versions of phpadsnew.

I would try and fix the source code. It can't be too hard to find the
part where it gets the dump.

Are you sure the structure is ok? What are the results when you analyze the
table?

Sounds like your table is exporting a different type than expected.

You know skip this whole conversation lol, I just realized that the last
build was end of Sept 2003 (doh!) ... one of those "dont know what happened"
projects that got abandoned I guess ... a shame considering alot of projects
are getting into taking PayPal donations now ...

hmmm...well, php is dumping this create table statement for the same 
table referenced in my last email:

CREATE TABLE `cat_49` (
   `cat_49_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `cat_49_content_area` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL default '49',
   `cat_49_parent` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
   `cat_49_name` tinyblob,
   `cat_49_description` blob,
   `cat_49_sort_num` tinyint(4) NOT NULL default '0',
   `cat_49_active` enum('y','n') NOT NULL default 'n',
   `cat_49_added` datetime default NULL,
   `cat_49_updated` timestamp(14) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY  (`cat_49_id`)
) TYPE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=7 ;


i don't see anything particularly strange there.

Except your last field as you showed it earlier doesn't look like a
timestamp(14):

INSERT INTO `cat_49` (`cat_49_id`, `cat_49_content_area`,
`cat_49_parent`, `cat_49_name`, `cat_49_description`,
`cat_49_sort_num`, `cat_49_active`, `cat_49_added`, `cat_49_updated`)
VALUES (1, 49, 0, 0x414652494341, '', 0, 'y', '2004-01-05 09:34:22',
2004-01-06 13:03:44);

-- i would expect 20040106130344 there...

Here's the problem...

The datetime is being exported as a standard datetime string (with the
spaces, hypens, etc).

The timestamp column should be exported as a number, such as:

20040106130344

This is why it isn't getting quoted.  Yet, the format that's being
captured by phpMyAdmin is of the string, per above.  Spaces, but not
quoted, thus your error.

Why this is happening I'm not sure.  I'd bet it's a bug in phpMyAdmin.
To see if it's a problem with mysql or phpmyadmin, run these queries
just as testers:

SELECT cat_49_added FROM cat_49 LIMIT 1

SELECT cat_49_updated FROM cat_49 LIMIT 1


The results of each should be differently formatted.  Are they?

Does this mean it might be resolved by altering (if possible) the original
or destination table structures to use datetime data instead of mixing
datetime and timestamp?

That would "fix" it but for the wrong reasons, and potentially break
other dependencies that the column is expected to be a TIMESTAMP (like
timestamping).

Hmmm....

So, maybe the bug is not in phpMyAdmin.  I also thought the timestamp 
should be coming out as a timestamp integer, but I figured phpMyAdmin 
knew more about this stuff than me.

Anyway, the two results are NOT differently formatted.

I need to investigate this more and find out why the timestamp isn't 
coming out as a timestamp...maybe I can appeal to the sysadmin to 
grant me temporary access to this account.

Although, you ran the SQL still through phpMyAdmin....

Next step:

-- write a tiny PHP script to run those two queries directly against
MySQL.
-- get on the mysql shell from somewhere and run those queries directly
against MySQL

Point is, bypass phpmyadmin completely.

Well, OK...I have my answer, and this could be useful for everyone 
else so I am posting here.  Thanks to everyone who chimed in.

MySQL changed the way timestamp columns behave as of 4.1.  The manual 
says, about timestamps:

TIMESTAMP[(M)]
A timestamp. The range is '1970-01-01 00:00:00' to sometime in the 
year 2037. ....[snip]......In MySQL 4.0 and earlier, TIMESTAMP values 
are displayed in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS, YYMMDDHHMMSS, YYYYMMDD, or YYMMDD 
format, depending on whether M is 14 (or missing).....[snip]


They also offer this section in the manual, to explain for people new 
to MySQL how timestamps *used to* work.

http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/TIMESTAMP_pre-4.1.html

This might be useful to any of you dealing with timestamps.

This host is using 4.1+, so that's obviously where my problem stems from.

IMO this *is* a bug in phpMyAdmin, or, rather, something that ought 
to be in there.  However, it is entirely possible they have already 
updated some build of phpMyAdmin that they do not consider "stable".

I'll look into that now, and notify them if necessary.

Cheers,

I tried using phpadsnew a long time ago and it was to much of a load.

I installed it again and have been using it for about 3 months now.
I did everything the manual said to do for best performance and it's 
actually been pretty good so far.
I have a server at rackshack (ev1 servers now): celeron 1.3 with 1gig ram.
The server is running apache, mysql and phpadsnew.
Apache is serving about 100k page views a day and phpadsnew is serving 
about 30k ads a day.

I do not notice any slowdown of my pages and the ads appear very fast. 
(you can see it at http://www.stationplay.com in the left sidebar).
The server load usually is between 0.4 to 0.8

If you read the phpadsnew forums (which are still pretty active) you'll 
see people who server over 1 million ads a day using phpadsnew.

How many ads a day do you need to support?

I'm running phpAdsNew on a dedicated server w/ a single AMD 1.8GHz  w/
512MB RAM. On March 31st, I served 1,130,514 banners. (728s, 468x, 120s,
160s, text and pops.) I'm hosted at Rackspace. My server load is never
above 2.0 on a busy day.

I tried using phpadsnew a long time ago and it was to much of a load.

I installed it again and have been using it for about 3 months now. I
did everything the manual said to do for best performance and it's 
actually been pretty good so far.
I have a server at rackshack (ev1 servers now): celeron 1.3 with 1gig
ram. The server is running apache, mysql and phpadsnew. Apache is
serving about 100k page views a day and phpadsnew is serving 
about 30k ads a day.

I do not notice any slowdown of my pages and the ads appear very fast. 
(you can see it at http://www.stationplay.com in the left sidebar). The

Well definetly not a million a day @ the moment :-)  Your setup is perfect
for an example of what I was looking for ... 100k is ~ where the client is @
but the main setup was for backup for Google AdSense but also for front page
links which Im guessing can be track exactly like this ...

The deal is that alot of affiliate programs delay alot of their reporting
and Im trying to assess if they are @ least 99% accurate since it really
conflicts on occassions ... however I don't think a complex adserver would
be appropriate for normal hyperlinks :-\ Or maybe Im wrong and can use it.

hey jon:

thanks for spotting that.  yeah, my version of mysql is 4.0.18, yet 
it is still spitting back timestamps in the NEW way, which mysql says 
requires 4.1

ditto this web host i am dealing with, who has 4.0.11.  (i.e., not 
"4.1", but behaving like 4.1).

i guess the mysql guys have reported this wrong, or there is a 
discrepancy in the way mysql reports version numbers and the way 
phpmyadmin handles it.  anyway, i'm just glad i know why all this is 
happening now.  it was frustrating the hell out of me.

Although the last build (2.0) was Sept 2003 doesn't mean that the software
itself is bad. Just development has stalled.

I was looking into ad software and phpadsnew seems to be the best free
opensource solution you'll find out there (by far). That said, I haven't
deployed it on what is a highly traffic'd site so I don't know what the
performance would be.

But there are plenty of optimizations you can make. You can store the
banners either in the DB or on the HD, you can enable caches to speed up
the delivery along with a ton of other tweaks.

Statistic reporting is also variable and you can turn off certain logging
features if you're worried about large lurking DB's running around.

There was a post yesterday in the forums by the lead developer, seems he's
simply gotten more involved in writting backends for Groklaw.

"I hope to have some more time soon and I am thinking about releasing
phpAdsNew 2.01 in the nearby future."

Anyway, I'm thinking of still going forward with this software the
documention is top-notch for any software (free or not) and makes it hard
to believe it couldn't handle a decent amount of traffic. Other than that
are there any reccomendations for commercial solutions for ad software?

I never said it was bad, I actually just discovered it after googling around
and thought it was a new package, searched the archive list here and didnt
see too much about it ... Im about to give it a try ...

The only last question remaining is if this should go on its own box but
people have said overhead was pretty low so far ... thanks for the
optimization tips ...

Putting phpAdsNew on it's own box depends.

In my case, my server was already running vBulletin 2.4.3 and a few
minor php script on it, and I'd stall during the day. vBulletin can eat
up your resources fast if you don't have MySQL optimized right. I
running phpAdsNew on another server to be so much smoother. Plus, I'm
hosting banners for some other sites that are not owned by me, so I
wanted to sure that if my site went down atleast my ads would server.

2.0.1 is going to be coming out mid-year. The developer said he was
working on another project. Sometimes you gotta take time off to get
your mind together and come back fresh.

I am actually finding the same problem in re: affiliate software ... it
seems that when you need to track large amounts of traffic in such detail
that something is bound to stall somewhere and its alot of responsibility
for such errors when the programs are complex, I have found that you need to
spend a good day just learning the layout of the code and knowing where
something has a 90% chance of going wrong, so thank you god once again for
open source and mailing lists :-)

This thread has gone on for a while..
Wasn't paying much attention until this.

We do a lot of freehosting for domains.. (seven virtual hosting
servers).
We are using OASIS http://oasis.sourceforge.net/ and pushed it to the
500,000 banner impressions per/hour mark with no problems.

Open source and it has a lot more functionality than phpadsnew..

Message-ID: <40742728.7080400@netzero.com>

Hello,
I am having lots of trouble getting PHP-Gtk 1.0 to compile.  I tried to 
ask this question to the php-gtk-general list but I think gtk hates me 
cause I can't even subscribe to the list right. Any help would be 
greatly appreciated.  I am pretty sure that it is just my setup but I 
can't figure it out.  I have searched the mail list archives and there 
doesn't seem to be much help for me there.  I am using RedHat Enterprise 
with PHP 5 RC1.

The problems start with configure.  If I run configure with no options I 
get an error saying that it can't find libGlade-config.  So I tried to 
run configure --with-libglad-config="path/libGlade2.0.1/configure" and I 
get an error saying "libglade is not configured for see 
path/libGlade2.0.1/configure --help"  That isn't a typo on my part.  It 
says "...configured for" but doesn't say configured for what!  When I 
look at the libglade config help I don't see anything remotely helpful. 
  Configure works if I use the --disable-libglade option but then I get 
issues with make.

After configuring without libglade I run make and get a PHP error in 
generator/scheme.php.  The error is on line 117 where it tries to do 
$this = unserialize ($this->parseTree);  Not really knowing what is 
going on there, I tried changing that line to $this->parseTree = 
unserialize ($this->parseTree);  That gets me further but then I get a 
large formatted error saying that my php.ini file should have 
register_argc_argv = On.  But it does have it set to on!

If anyone has hany suggestions I would love to hear them.  I have been 
fighting with this for three days now and it is really frustrating.  I 
was able to run everything flawlessly in one attempt on a server at work 
which runs RHEL and PHP 4.3.2.

Thanks
Scott Mattocks

Yea, it does appear to have more functionality than phpAdsNew...except:

Impression capping: set limits on the number of impressions to be
delivered to a user within a specific timeframe 
Companion sections: prevent the same creative from appearing twice on a
page

This comes with Oasis Professional which is $695.00. But this comes
standard w/ phpAdsNew and it's actually something I use everyday.

Here is a screencap (of the free version) for the traffic-shaping..
http://oasis.sourceforge.net/screenshots/version1.0/ad-6.gif
so, yes on a per-ad basis you can set limits. 

As for companion sections, we have not had an issue with that. Though we
generally don't have multiple ads on freehosted pages. For high-end,
this is by far the best system we have seen. 

The funny thing is, that I found this by reading an article about
spammers and how they needed the monster systems to handle the images
back before email clients stopped displaying remote images in emails.
They tracked everything even if a user moused-over an image.

This professional stuff is new, they didn't have that before, guess they
decided to make a buck or two off of it for the newer features.

I don't believe PHP-Gtk 1 works with PHP 5.

You can't reassign the value of $this in PHP 5. This is a change from
PHP 4.

Also, there were some changes with how argc/argv are handles in PHP
5. They may need to be accessed differently, depending on your set up.

Stick with PHP 4.3?

Late response, we're moving house.

Personally I find classes or new projects *outside* of my field the most 
mentally invigorating. Last year I learned sailing, for example. I find 
myself fixing things just to the point I need at the moment and 
sometimes it takes that whole new need to see new ways to use what I'm 
already aware of.

ciao!

Hmmm, me too, I guess. That must be why I study computer programming. (-:

Hi All,

I'm looking into setting up a site with a CMS for a change, and not hand 
written php :)
I remember hearing some people say that Mambo was great so I just 
downloaded and installed it.

Seems to be very cool.

I was wondering if there are any Mambo users here that I could chat with 
(AIM, MSN) to ask a couple of questions if needed.

Thanks,
Ophir

Just wondering what techniques you guys use for enforcing password
strength on users when they create their own. I'm considering requiring as
a mimimum eight characters including at least one digit but I might decide
to do more.

Anybody have any good snippets or tips?

hey pallies!

I just tried to implement recipe # 12.11 from Adam's Cookbook re: RSS 
feeds. I downloaded the following php files from pear:
parser.php, tree.php, tree/node.php and rss.php but I get the following 
errors:

Warning: main(PEAR.php): failed to open stream: No such file or 
directory in /var/www/html/XML/Parser.php on line 21

Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required 'PEAR.php' 
(include_path='.:/php/includes:/usr/share/php') in 
/var/www/html/XML/Parser.php on line 21

now, I checked and the pear.php is in usr/share not usr/share/php , but 
I don't know if that's necessarily the cause of the error. If you have 
any idea (which, honestly, I bet you do) please help me. This is my 
first incursion into pear territory...


thanks for your time!

So, either move the files to /usr/share/php or fix your include_path:

   ini_set('include_path', '/usr/share:.:blahblahblah');

Excellent. (BTW, it's actually Adam and David's Cookbook, but I wrote
the RSS Recipe.)

Did you use the PEAR package manager? (i.e. did you do "pear get

I presume you used the package manager, but I want to be sure.

Well, it looks like pear installed them in /usr/share instead of
/usr/share/php. That seems odd. What is the output of:

$ pear config-get php_dir

If it's /usr/share, you may want to change it to be /usr/share/php by
doing:

$ pear config-set php_dir /usr/share/php

Of course, this requires you to make the extra
directory. Alternatively, you can modify your include_path to add
/usr/share, but that seems sloppy because you don't want to dump all
your PHP files in /usr/share.

Try to edit you php.ini file to read:
include_path='.:/php/includes:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/php/PEAR/pear'

(or whatever the path to PEAR.php actually is)

And make sure permission are set correctly.

I'll quote you this from a design doc we're about to implement.  We have
about 5 users now, basically our own internal team, so I did not originally
place much restriction at all on password format.  But we're about to open
big doors, and this is one of the guidelins we're planning to use.  Since we
haven't implemented it, though, I can't tell you how much or little
complaint I get from users about it.

?        A password must meet these criteria:

?        Must contain at least 6 characters

?        Must contain both letters and numbers

?        Must not begin or end with a number

?        May also contain US-English keyboard numbers and letters, spaces,
and any of these characters: ~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ - + = | : ; ' " . ,





Jon's point is intriguing, though, and I want to make time to investigate
CrackLib also.

They are generated using patterns that make them easier for humans to 
remember than random strings, but almost as hard to crack.

Staying a little with the topic ...

Does anyone here implement any security beyond brute-force detection for
their PHP apps?  I used to think using Snort for anomaly detection in web
applications was a great idea but kinda overkill for people to understand
how to use ... (writing a signature *with* your apps error handling)

You mainly use this libraries (CrackLib) for really checking "bad passwords"
but what is a bad password normally translate to how fast a script kiddy can
load up jtr or cain & abel  and bypass what you thought was impossible.

Not alot of developers go off and monitor their traffic as it pertains to
their application (or do they?)  Its usually pretty easy to detect someone
bruteforcing an app from the outside but does anyone do honeypot stuff to
actually check?  Just curious.  I know they are making firewalls a bit
"snort-like" these days but Im *sure* not everyone can afford those
solutions :-)

Yeah - use PEAR::HTML_QuickForm for the password management screens, and 
use the provided rules to ensure alphanumeric-ness and so on.  Makes it 
easy.

If password changes occur outside of PHP, then we are into a whole 
different realm...  Some databases have the means of enforcing these 
types of rules, not sure about MySQL- this could at least throw an error 
if the proposed password was not compliant.

Nice thread here, as usual. I was thinking about HTML_QuickForm and I'm
not sure how the built in 'alphanumeric' would ensure that they ~did~ use
both letters and numbers, it only returns true if they didn't put anything
that ~wasn't~. Or have I been hitting the old crack pipe again?

I'm considering something like

function isStrongPassword($pwd) {

	return 2 <= preg_match_all('/\d/',$pwd,$matches)
	&& strlen($pwd) >= 8
	&& preg_match('/[a-z].*[A-Z]|[A-Z].*[a-z]/',$pwd);

}

which you could readily plug in as a HMTL_QuickForm validation rule.
This, obviously, makes them use both upper and lower case letters, two
numbers, and no fewer than 8 characters, but it doesn't care about the
"cannot begin or end with a number" which Allen Shaw proposed. Which by
the way sounds like a good way to discourage passwords like Debbie16,
which this function would permit. Hmmm...

I imagine one of you d00ds will want to improve my regex. I want to say
"it should have an upper case letter and a lower case letter and it
doesn't matter which comes first."

Thank you C Snyder for the URL, That looks like a site where I could
happily kill a couple hours.

Thanks Jon B for the tip about crack (the other kind). Looks like my ISP's
PHP is compiled without out it.... guess I'd have to compile my own PHP
and run it a la CGI if it's worth the effort.

That's not the best way to manage PEAR packages. You should either
read the final chapter of PHP Cookbook or consult the online PEAR
documentation at http://pear.php.net.

This show you how to install "pear" and PEAR packages the correct way
and will save you a lot of time in the long run. (You may have some
initial troubles getting it to work, but once it's going everything
should be smooth sailing.)

I've said this very same thing, and in practice, it is correct.  However...

I had a server die with a dead disk yesterday, and got the server 
'restored' to a shiny new RedHat 8.  (grumble grumble)

I'm moving to a new host next week (dual Xeons, yippee!) but still need 
to serve for the next few days. Updating PHP beyond 4.2.2 is going to be 
a significant pain, as anyone with RH8 experience will attest ;)

Is it possible to upgrade PEAR or just install from downloads?  My 
existing setup only needs to run for 3-5 days, so I really don't want to 
go into gcc oblivion...

My answer to the last message applies here, too. :)

PEAR is a PHP-based solution, so as long as you have a the CGI or CLI
version of PHP on your machine, it should be easy to install, first
pear, and then use pear to install PEAR packages.

FWIRIW, I wish more people knew this ... I notice alot of questions /
what-ifs / code based on reinventing the wheel for some stuff that are
already solid PEAR classes ... or I wish they would just call it "PHP
Extensions" instead of making it sound like a completely different product,
same thing with Smarty ... "PHP Template System" would be nice, damn
acronyms :-)

For a language that has excellent online documentation, the online
PEAR documentation is surprisingly subpar. It is incomplete,
out-dated, and often missing completely. This is a shame.

I wish more people used PEAR the same way Perl programmers used
CPAN. I know there's some philosophical differences between the two,
but I really wish there was a centralized way to find all PHP
packages, whether they're part of PEAR or just a useful library.

The easiest CMS I have ever worked with (from the front-end perspective) 
was Plone, which unfortunately was a huge beast and required running 
Zope as well.

The best I could find in the PHP world was Mambo, which I am helping 
migrate to database independence because I want to use PostgreSQL, and 
am annoyed at folks telling me I have to use MySQL or risk not being one 
of the kewl kids.  I tried maybe twenty others in a week's time, and all 
either had poor administration, difficult-to-impossible installation, or 
significant bugs er, features.

<salespitch>

The things that I find unique with Mambo is a super light distribution, 
simple install, awesome administration interface, and an established 
community providing add-on modules and templates (both free and 
commercial).  The latest few releases added some excellent performance 
increases, so Mambo portals are very snappy.  Also interesting to note 
is different content types (or views of content, if you will) - you can 
group your content as articles, blog-style, or whatever you want.  The 
code is very easy to work with, and is all OO-based.  So you can jump in 
and make any changes that you want.

(As a new initiate into serious OO usage in PHP4, this has been an 
excellent learning experience for me as well.)

The next major release is going to really do amazing things, and will 
raise everyone's expectations about what an open source CMS should be 
capable of.

</salespitch>

http://www.opensourcecms.com/ will give you the chance to test drive 
many CMS before a single download.  Highly recommended.

Mitch, thanks for your comments below! Have you tryed out tikiwiki
(tikiwiki.org), and if so, what's your 2 cents on it?

I am also looking for some feedback on xaraya and the *nukes type CMSs
Any info will be appreciated!

Evan

Yeah, I remember that one.  Not a wiki fan, and needed something that 
was multi-purpose (personal sites, community portals, business sites).  
I tried to get the layouts that I wanted, but they just didn't work like 
I wanted them to.  But I never did get the whole wiki craze either (shrug)

Xaraya is pretty good, I especially like the 'view article map' feature 
(I'm currently working on a portal with a lot of content!)...  The 
*nukes have a rep of always looking like *nukes, no matter what you do - 
but I'm not sure if that is due to lazy layout efforts or technical 
limitations.

Seems like all of the CMS are implementing TTW (Through The Web) editors 
like HTMLArea, so non-HTML folks can manage their own sites with a 
simple install and provided template.  For me that was the biggest 
shortcoming.  Perhaps we are seeing the maturation of this environment, 
where consolidation will take place - similar to the linux desktop being 
dominated by GNOME/KDE, editors being vi/emacs, etc.?

In twelve months, I'll wager that there will be five major players in 
the FOSS/CMS space, and they will be almost identical in features.

If you are planning on settling down with a particular CMS that will 
need to serve many purposes, then put a lot of research into what it 
takes to create a layout/template.  For example, Mambo even has a 
Dreamweaver extension where a graphical layout person can 'program' a 
template, complete with dynamic content.  This may  be an important 
factor to you, as it was to me!

I use drupal for my personal site.
It has a way to go but I seen lots of improvement in last release. The cvs
version maybe the best state of the project. It certainly is not unlike
other cmses. The only thing i dont like about it for development is
constantly changing api's ( or improvements ) depends how you look at it.

I got a client who thinks the word should be spelled 'log-in'. I think
'login' predominates and should be preferred. I tried to google the issue
and whenever I used log-in as a search term is says, "did you mean
'login'?"

I should rest my case on that but... somebody back me up here.

I think login is the more commonly accepted term.  I also think it's 
more aesthetically pleasing to look at.  =)

Sometimes in text I'll say something like  "In order to log in to the 
system...", but if you're referring to the actual box, it's a login 
box.

Sort of like website and web site.  I still use both but more commonly 
use website.

However, I have never used log-in.  Don't know where it comes from...

HTH,

See about halfway down the page:

This blog has lots of useful information about writing, particularly

I don't know what your relationship is with 
your client, but my immediate reaction is:
if the client wants it spelled 'log-in' spell 
it the way the client wants.

I mean its not like people won't know how to 
use the website, if you don't spell 'login' in 
the generally accepted way.

In the future, if your client is in favor of 
making a major design blunder which would 
make the site very hard to use, and you want 
to persuade him/her not to, you don't want the   
client to view your suggestion as yet another 
'nit-picking' suggestion to alter the design.

Again, since I don't know what your relation- 
ship is with the client, I don't know how 
applicable this line of reasoning is.

This is just 'food for thought'.

Thanks all.

I did a little more research, including checking the page Adam pointed me
to. It seems that the proper verb, or verb phrase, as the case may be, is
"log in", and the noun is "login". Tim's points about not haggling
unecessarily with the client over minutiae are well taken. She says she
prefers "log-in"  because "login" looks "weird" to her.

I was looking over this on Thursday.  Incredibly well done.  Try the demo if

I have to say wow myself - nice work

I bought that thing within like 5 minutes of hiting the site.

source included too!!!!!

that's awesome b/c most of these flash based systems don't want you to have

Wouldn't put much stock in that, no pun intended.  I'm a client of 
theirs and I'm constantly frustrated by their web user interface.  It's 
a bit archaic, IMO.

Yeah that's the key, did you dump it into Flash and recompile? ... nothing

Idea was just to prevent passwords like "mouse98" which -- I've read -- are
easily cracked: dictionary words with a number added at the beginning or
end.  Honestly, I'm curious to hear how effective or lame you think such a
requirement might be, since I'm pretty new to the topic.

Just FYI, this is what is meant by "brute force" and you are right alot of
*crackers* allow you to adjust the amount of digits which *must* appear in
the password, BUT to prevent this type of cracking you do *not* want to
publicize what your password policy is ... alot of signup forms make this
terrible presumption that guys signing up to a form are legit people when in
fact if you have an error message like:

password:
* must use 3 digits
* must be 6 - 8 characters long (or max)

You kinda give away alot of info :-)

I don't know. Do you really think it's better to make the user guess
through trial and error? If I was signing up for your site, I'd get
frustrated pretty quickly.

Besides, it's not that hard for a cracker to try a few sample
passwords and generalize what does and doesn't make it through your
filters.

The real purpose of enforcing these types of rules is to push your
passwords into a statespace large enough to make brute force attacks
computationally expensive. There are more potential passwords of
exactly six letters than there are of any number between one and five
letters combined!

So, letting a cracker know he can skip short passwords doesn't really
help him out all that much. (Likewise, for skipping dictionary
attacks.) Plus, if you can't detect someone trying to sign in to an
account over a billion times, you've got a much larger problem. :)

Hi there:

This really only marginally has anything to do with PHP, although I 
will want to read this stuff in PHP.

I know Photoshop (and other image editors) are capable of adding 
metadata to images, kind of like ID3 tags, but I'm not sure if that 
is proprietary.  I've done a bit of research, and I can't seem to 
tell if there is an industry standard for this sort of thing.

I need to build multiple galleries as part of an archival project, 
and normally I have been storing credit/caption/copyright as separate 
data in a database or a serialized text file, but I am wondering if 
there is a way I can just tag that data onto the file itself?  It 
seems to me that would be much slicker, in some ways...

Any thoughts?

The pseudo-standard is called EXIF. Googling for it should give you
some useful links.

PHP has built-in support for reading EXIF files, but it's not enabled
by default. Start with http://www.php.net/exif-read-data and go from
there.

 From http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.exif-read-data.php

"Exif headers tend to be present in JPEG/TIFF images generated by 
digital cameras, but unfortunately each digital camera maker has a 
different idea of how to actually tag their images, so you can't always 
rely on a specific Exif header being present."

But further down it also mentions the "Exif 2.10 standard".


I know you can read the metadata via php, not sure about writing it.

Photoshop (and presumably Acrobat?) use an Adobe technology called XMP, 
documented here:

http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/main.html

As I recall, you could build XMP with PHP and put it into any binary 
file, as long as you were willing to do some bit-level manipulation. 
It's been a while since I looked at it.

Having a PHP class that handled this for JPEGs would be pretty 
excellent... anybody know of one?

I've seen a couple different methods mentioned in this thread: EXIF, 
IPTC tags, XMP...

Additionally Creative Commons recommends using the Copyright tag for a 
URL pointing to metadata (license info in their case, of course).

Has anyone seen any images with xml or rdf metadata embedded? How was it 
stored?

Very interesting idea.  So interesting I did some looking as well... Here's
what I came up with:

Php function to grab the meta data:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.exif-read-data.php

"EXIF.org is a site dedicated to EXIF and related resources. EXIF stands for
Exchangeable Image File Format, and is a standard for storing interchange
information in image files, especially those using JPEG compression."
http://www.exif.org/

Mmm.. I smell a few image management objects in the oven.  Oh, and look.. A
beer!!

Good luck!

Well it was mainly referring to the point of spilling *all* your beans @ the
point of error ... and if you are not tough on your app's password policy
then why even have rules to begin with?

While Im not a cryptology expert, nor do I play one on TV (or probably
shouldnt even comment ), I think brute force attacks on todays PCs will
defeat alot of well thought out apps ... and you are going to be relying on
multiple passwords for one app (but thats another discussion :-)

Good point :-)  So has anyone here ever been the *victim* of BF attacks?

More sensible way of preventing brute force password attack is to prevent
someone from automating trying all the password possibilities.  Unix like
login program has always had backoffs. It would be tricky to implement in
web environment. The shortcut that I seen web apps take is just lock out
the ip for a day after couple of tries. I think that solution is not ideal
because sometimes someone may not exactly remember the password but has
mental picture of it and may get it after maybe even 10 tries.

Crypto is the art of scrabling bits so that one cant figure out the
original message without the key. Application security is an engineering
discipline of writing secure application under which the password issue
falls. Remember brute force is only possilbe if the advesary can actually
performe many tests in an automated way. In the web environment this
attack will generate millions of hits to the login page which any good sys
admin should be able to spot eventually.

The only server I have ever had compromised was via brute force - that 
is, he used 'brute force' in an office environment to crawl through the 
ceiling tiles...

Not a bad record for 15 years, though.  If you wanna hack me, ya gotta

Agreed:  form elements username and password should have labels "Username"
and "Password." But it's awkward if not impossible to avoid the L-word
forever.  For example this site has navigation thingies that say something
like "Members Only (Login Required)", or help file with a section headed
"Login Assistance."  True, you could substitute "Username/Password" in
each of the above cases but you see my point.  Especially where page
layout is a consideration and terse label texts are desirable.

I hear TIAA-CREF does a great job of managing people's money, though, no
matter how they spell /^log-?in$/    $$$ (-: $$$

Just because it's so fun to hear myself talk (and I'm on cold meds):
I would wager "login" came about because "log-in" has that evil dash in it.
While that's not a problem these days, perhaps there was something evil (or
lazy, or (evil && lazy)) about the systems or sysadmins (this goes to you,
"back in the day" crew) that required the authentication to have no
non-alpha chars in it.

Discuss!

Or don't. Chalk it up to Tylenol Cold.

While technically not on topic, I recall an amusing graphic used to commit a
form on the M$ website, it was titled simply:

"SUBMIT"

Now that's pretty effin' funny.

But go with the client's spec, of course. After all, it doesn't matter until
they get enough hate-mail about it, right?

I agree with one of the early replies saying that "log in" is a verb,
and "login" is a noun.

"Log in to the server."

"Click the login button."

Now why do some people use "email", and others use "e-mail"???

I recently fought this one with myself (not sure who won...) and then
decided to look at some popular non-technical sites, since mine is a site
aimed at folks with little to no technical background, more a community
site.  MSN/Hotmail, yahoo.com, and netscape.com all use the phrase "Sign In"
to describe the act of providing account credentials.  I've done away with
the word "log" and all its variants altogether, so that the site now has
"Username" and "Password" fields, and any helpful text refers to "signing
in."  This seems to me to match culturally with non-computer activities; the
only time I can think of that people do anything similar in the "real world"
is when they sign themselves in and out of a guest book or security log-book
at an office building, etc.  So, I figure the phrase is less techie and more
familiar to more people.

Either way, it seems right that "Sign in" and "Log in" are verbs, and
"Sign-in" and "Log-in" are nouns and/or adjectives.

I think it was "LOGON:" in Wargames and TRS80 :-)  Performing both a verb
and a noun @ the same time. :-)

I agree with one of the early replies saying that "log in" is a verb,
and "login" is a noun.

Message-ID: <20040412152715.86108.qmail@web41409.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi Group,
 
I am writting an article about PHP User Groups and would like to include "New York PHP" and "AMP" technology. I noticed that both of these terms are trademarked (http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=search&state=65lj0u.1.1) to a person named Zaunere. Is this a part of NYPHP and where can I get written permission to use these terms?
 
Thank you in advance,
Robert

You know it seems like all this must have surely been discussed hundreds of
times by other people, maybe even by us, before.  Wouldn't this all be
somewhat generally understood by now, and maybe even written down in some
reliable source?  I've found lots of "advice" on good password policy, but
nothing that claimed or seemed to be vaguely authoritative.  Are there just
too many variables to generalize about, or maybe people aren't interested in
really understanding the issue?

That is a good point, the question is *who* would be deemed the
authoritative figure when it comes to web application security?  Micro$oft?
$un?  Id like to see a Security section on http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/
covering it and other topics (XSS, Passwords, Authentication, CrackLib, etc)
...

There are some called Authentication Policies that are good reads:

http://www.sans.org/resources/policies/Password_Policy.pdf

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2196.txt?Number=2196
http://www.sans.org/resources/policies/?printer=Y#primer

Im sure some information can also be abstracted from Security+/CISSP exam
guides.

Jon,

These are great.  I'll be giving these some attention before moving on with
password guidelines I mentioned before.  Thanks for the tip.

I keep seeing the php security vulnerabilities posted here; is that a

a secure job of it?

ciao!

The second. There are occasional bugs in PHP itself, but those are
rare compared to PHP application vulnerabilities.

Hello all,

Just received a copy David Sklar's new "Essential PHP Tools" 
book and one of the first things I noticed about it was it 
contains things you can *use*...  ok, I haven't done any web 
services related work yet, but I may get that call tomorrow :)

it's worth checking out...

Hey Hans,

Just to confirm, 'AMP' stands for:

    Apache
    Mod_php
    Postgres

Which program is that?  Sounds like a piece of vaporware put forth as

In fact not quite about a CMS unless you know some CMS capable to do what i want.
I want to have a site that supports mini-sites.
For example some user subscribe and afterwards he can edit his text, add some contact infos and upload a few pictures.
And all new users be listed by categories or by name, no matter.
I installed 4-5 CMS but no luck untill now.
 If any of you know something witch can help me on that please tell

Hi all,

Thanks for your input into the use of " and ' - I had figured out places 
where I should use one or the other but never understood WHY. Now I do. :-)

I have a new question which is a little more complex....

I have been working with a running club to bring them into the 20th 
century (we'll worry about the 21st century in a year or two, just 
getting them out of the 19th century is difficult enough!). They have a 
basic website with a large amount of content which is just crying out 
for a CMS. They also have a brand-spanking-new membership management 
system with a PHP front-end and MySQL backend (shameless plug: It's an 
open source project I've begun at http://ericzander.com/ZebraZ ). This 
system replaced a flat-file MS Access "database" (I tell you that for 
your laughter and enjoyment).

So, with that background, I'd like to do some longer term planning and 
figure out a roadmap on where to take the club's IT structure. I would 
like to continue to develop their "specialized" functions - like the 
membership system, develop a race results system, on-line training logs, 
etc. all from a single login (note I did not say log-in ;-) ) And I 
would like to help them simplify their website management by 
implementing a CMS. But, I am worried about the two systems being 
incompatible or having difficulties in tying the two together.

I am looking at the next 1-3 years as a time frame for implementing all 
of this for the club so if there is a solution that is "not there yet 
but will be in a year", I would be happy to look at and watch it. Since 
this is all in very early stages, I could also aim development of 
systems towards a certain common standard.

Can anyone shed light on these future issues? Would I be better served 
developing two systems? How about authentication and such between 
systems? Am I in for a LOT of customization of existing projects over time?

Many thanks in advance for your advice!

EZ

You might consider looking at and watching CLEW 
(Conversationally Linked Email and other Writings)
which is being developed by NYPHP.

I would wager that it will be 'ready for primetime' 
in less than a year.

If you are not already subscribed to the 'dev' list -- 
sign up.
 
(you don't have to subscribe to the 'dev' list. You 
can view the code at:
http://cvs.nyphp.org/cvsweb.cgi/clew/)

Another reason you might want to watch the 
development of CLEW is that you can see practical 
examples of how to make use of some of the PCOM 
(phpComponent Architecture) modules. 

the source for PCOMs can be found at:
http://cvs.nyphp.org/cvsweb.cgi/pcoms/

Subject: [nycphp-talk] DB-independent fulltext indexing--help!
Message-ID: <20040413175204.25894.qmail@web41414.mail.yahoo.com>

Everyone,

My problem in a nutshell: How do I use, or at least
roughly emulate, fulltext indexing in a db-portable
way? My project requires near perfect portability, so
I?m already using PEAR::DB and standard ansi sql
extensively, but I need to provide the ability to
search large text fields.

It seems to me there are two possible routes, but each
has its drawbacks. I could:

1) ignore the variety of proprietary implementations
and roll my own solution. This I suspect would involve
a keyword table and a mapping table that would track
occurrences of keywords in text records. This has the
benefit of being entirely db-independent, as well as
allowing me to add soundex or synonym lookups or
whatever else I might want to do. Reading/selecting is
nice and fast, but the downside, and it seems to me to
be a big one, is on inserts/updates. I can?t conceive
of a way to do this that does not involve inserting
the large text field (one query), splitting the text
field and, for _each word_ in the text field:
-check the keyword table for that word and get its id
(1 query), and if it?s not already in the keyword
table, insert it and get its id (possibly another
query)
-insert the keyword id and the text record id into a
mapping table (another query)
So, to insert, say, a 500-word string of text, that's
1001 (best case) or 1501 (worst case) queries!
(Duplicate and junk words would make this number a bit
smaller, but you get the point.)
(Oh, and I'm hoping the only answer isn't to run a
cron job to do inserts/keyword table updates
overnight, because I need the "index" to be current in
real time.)

2) Or, since I'm already using PEAR DB, maybe I should
extend it, or maybe extend each of the drivers, to
somehow modify where clauses to have a particular
rdms's fulltext syntax (e.g. "WHERE MATCH(cols)
AGAINST('searchString')" for mysql, "WHERE
CONTAINS(cols, 'searchString')" for mssql, "WHERE
CONTAINS(cols, 'searchString') > 0" for oracle, etc.)
This seems really kludgy, though, and it also means
that, for oracle and mssql at least, there's an
additional wrinkle of having to schedule regular index
refreshes/updates.

Any ideas? I prefer option one, if only I could
somehow reduce the processing work on inserts/updates.

Thanks,
Andy

You could implement search as a web service (pretend it's a google 
appliance), thus easing the requirement for db portability. You don't 
even need a crawler since it's your own system: documents can request 
re-indexing whenever they change.

I like the idea of extending the PEAR classes, too.

But wrapping it in a web service would still leave the original problem,
wouldn't it (the db will be specific to each installation, a part of the
application)?

One of my favorite resources for this sort of thing is the book 
"Practical Unix Security" by Simson Garfinkel and Gene Spafford.

I think both are true (most of the time).

It's a waste of your time to spend many hours coming up with lots of 
rules that filter out bad passwords (can't begin or end with a number, 
must have at least 3 uppercase and 3 lowercase chars, etc.) if what 
results is that acceptable passwords are so complicated so that people 
can't remember them and end up writing them down on the dreaded "sticky 
note attached to the monitor." Same with overly stringent policies on 
how frequently passwords must be changed, how many passwords the change 
cycle must go through before you can re-use a password, etc.

Security is a process, not an end state. You must constantly make 
decisions that balance robustness with convenience and risk of attack 
with severity of attack.

So, sure, there are some guidelines that just about always make sense 
("your password can't be your username or a dictionary word") but much 
beyond that is all situational.

Stopping brute force attacks on a web application's login page (say, 
more than 50 requests per second for the login page from the same IP or 
same cookie or whatever) is a much easier, legitimate-user friendly, and 
effective mechanism than making users who wish you no harm cycle through 
the account signup page six times because they can't think of a 
sufficiently obfuscated password.

Some applications don't need passwords at all. Witness the zillion wikis 
around the web that mostly let anyone do anything and (perhaps) have a 
squad of janitors who clean up the mess if someone does something bad. 
(Another nice thing about this model is that it promotes the use of 
version control.)

This essay has some interesting points about designing software for 
specific, small, linked-offline communities:
--> http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html

Many of the points in there apply to how you make security decisions, too.

    for (i = 0; i < document.imageForm.move.length; i++) {
     document.imageForm.move[i].checked = true;
    }
  }
 }

 function deSelectAll() {
  if (!document.imageForm.select_all[0].checked || 
document.imageForm.deselect_all[0].checked) {
   for (i = 0; i < document.imageForm.move.length; i++) {
    document.imageForm.move[i].checked = false;
   }
  }
 }
//-->
</script>
[/Code]

This will work with a checkbox group that has to have this naming 
convention for PHP:

[Code]
<input type=checkbox name=move[] value="myImage.gif"> - Move?
[/Code]

I will also have a checkbox that will "select all" and "de-select all":

[Code]
<input type=checkbox name=select_all value=1 onChange="selectAll()"> - 
Select All&nbsp;&nbsp;
<input type=checkbox name=deselect_all value=1 onChange="deSelectAll()"> 
- De-select All
[/Code]

I am not familiar at how Javascript can work with non-standard naming 
conventions for event actions, can someone tell me what I'm doing 
wrong?  This fails at least in Mozilla 1.6

Thanx
Phil

What about the other checkboxes, "select_all" and "deselect_all", along 
with other dynamically-generated checkbox groups that may also exist 
within this HTML resultset?

Thanks to David for a clear and patient explanation of the practical side of
password strength enforcement.  Reading that sure seemed to be a lot more
useful than all the white papers and RFCs I could read on the topic (and
which I'll probably still read).

And, what a great essay from Clay Shirky.  Worth reading 2 or 3 times.  In
my non-profit world, where the bottom line is not measured in dollars
generated from a generalized customer base, but in serving the needs of an
existing group, this kind of philosophy is exactly what we're already
applying to our software tools, as with most of the other tools and
solutions we use.  It's the reason we have very frequently chosen to roll
our own sometimes clunky solutions, rather than hiring a service or buying
some "super-program" that's bigger, more expensive, and more complex than we
need.

To be honest, I believe the data management app that we're constantly
developing would fail most "Web School" tests of design quality or success,
but it functions well for its intended group, is easy to maintain and
develop, and will probably wind up lasting us for quite a while, as long as
it can change as quickly as our needs do.

Thanks for a great read.

Message-ID: <000c01c42197$5b743fe0$6400a8c0@lorimervmware>

Try this:


<script>
<!--
	function selectAll(f,n,v) {
		var chk   = ( v == null ? true : v );
		for (i = 0; i < f.elements.length; i++) {
			if( f.elements[i].type == 'checkbox' &&
f.elements[i].name == n ) {
				f.elements[i].checked = chk;
			}
		}
	}
//-->
</script>

<form>
<input type="text" name="move[]"><br>
<input type="checkbox" name="move[]"><br>
<input type="checkbox" name="move[]"><br>
<input type="checkbox" name="move[]"><br>
<input type="checkbox" name="move[]"><br>
<input type="radio" name="move[]"><br>
<input type="checkbox" name="select[]"><br>
<input type="checkbox" name="select[]"><br>
<input type="checkbox" name="select[]"><br>
<input type="checkbox" name="select[]"><br>
<input type="button" onClick="selectAll(this.form,'move[]')" name="butt"
value="check em">
<input type="button" onClick="selectAll(this.form,'move[]',false)"
name="butt" value="clear em">
</form>


So  selectAll(this.form,'move[]',false)   can take 2 or 3 args:

1. - reference to the form
2. - the 'name' of the checkboxes to be set/cleared
3. - <optional, default is true> false to clear the checkboxes

Your code implementations work!  In Mozilla only.. :(  Fails in IE, 
Opera and Konqueror.. :(

Apparently IE, Opera and Konqueror look for a form element name to be 
alphanumeric construct only (e.g. "move", "move0", "move_move", 
"move-move"), but not "move[]", whereas Mozilla (and I believe Netscape 
but can't test that to know) are more forgiving of "move[]"..

I've tried numerous script examples and they all work in Mozilla and 
fail in IE the moment I use "move[]" instead of "move".

If that didn't work, then I think the next step on the road to salvation
lies in the precipitous use of the eval() function within a for loop:
for(var i; i < something; i++)
{
	var obj = eval('document.forms[0].move'+i);
	// etc etc...
}

This is an evil slimy hack but so long as you're in control of the form
variables, it will take the tedium out of catching each form element.

Following are all of the variations I tried using Javascript:
[Quote]
<script>
<!--
  function selectAll() {
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked) {
    var moveElement = eval("document.imageForm.move" + i);
    for (i = 0; i < moveElement.length; i++) {
     moveElement[i].checked = true;
    }
   document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked = false;
  }
 }
</script>

<script>
<!--
  function selectAll() {
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked) {
    var moveElement = eval("document.imageForm.move\[" + i + "\]");
    for (i = 0; i < moveElement.length; i++) {
     moveElement[i].checked = true;
    }
   document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked = false;
  }
 }
</script>

<script>
<!--
  function selectAll() {
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked) {
    var moveElement = eval("document.imageForm.move\[\]");
    for (i = 0; i < moveElement.length; i++) {
     moveElement[i].checked = true;
    }
   document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked = false;
  }
 }
</script>

<script>
<!--
  function selectAll() {
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked) {
    var moveElement = eval("document.imageForm.move\[\]");
    alert(moveElement);
    for (i = 0; i < moveElement.length; i++) {
     moveElement[i].checked = true;
    }
   document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked = false;
  }
 }
</script>
[/Quote]

Every single one of these failed.  The alert() didn't even show up.  
Failed in all browsers including Mozilla.

The following *works*.. but only in Mozilla and not in IE, Opera nor 
Konqueror:

[Quote]
<script>
<!--
  function selectAll() {
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked) {
    var moveElement = eval("document.imageForm.elements['move[]']");
    alert(moveElement);
    for (i = 0; i < moveElement.length; i++) {
     moveElement[i].checked = true;
    }
   document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked = false;
  }
 }
</script>
[/Quote]

I'm beginning to believe that the PHP array form element construct works 
only in Mozilla because it's non-M$.

I tested on IE 6  and it worked fine, with 'move[]' as the name passed
in... Phil, what version of IE did you use?

Oops, once again I provide an unclear example... what I meant is that move[]
becomes move1, move2, move3,..moveN when you output to the browser, and the
same upon receipt from the client. let me rearrange:

 <script>
 <!--
   function selectAll() {
    if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked) {
    for (i = 0; i < moveElement.length; i++) {
	var moveElement = eval("document.imageForm.move" + i);
      moveElement.checked = true;
     }
    document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked = false;
   }
  }
 </script>

See how that treats you...

Errrgh I'm just going to stop posting code snippets until I test them (and
have time for all that) Obviously in my last example, moveElement.length in
the for() statement has to be replaced with some other value.

This is maddening! STILL fails!!!! I can't still get it to work in any 
browser!!!

<script>
<!--
  function selectAll(checkState, obj) {
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked || document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked) {
    for (i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {
     obj[i].checked = checkState;
    }
   document.imageForm.select_all.checked = (document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked || !document.imageForm.select_all.checked) ? false : true;
  }
 }
//-->
</script>

Calm down, Phil, it'll be alright...

I would try the code alone, nothing else on the page. Use
drydell at att.net's code (I haven't tested it but it looks great).

Often a syntax error -- a missing brace, etc. -- in javascript will
cause all kinds of silent havoc on yer code. Then paste back in,
function by function, testing after each one to make sure nothing
breaks.

Fails in IE, Opera and Konqueror, acts very buggy in Mozilla but 
slightly works:

<script>
<!--
  function selectAll(checkState, obj) {
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked || document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked) {
    for (i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {
     obj[i].checked = checkState;
    }
   document.imageForm.select_all.checked = (document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked) ? false : true;
   document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked = (document.imageForm.select_all.checked) ? false : true;
  }
 }
//-->
</script>

Well the good news is that it [sort of] works in all browsers.. bad news 
is that it [sort of] works in all browsers.. sometimes it selects all, 
sometimes it does not...

The only major change was that I changed "onChange" to "onClick"

<script>
<!--
  function selectAll(checkState, obj) {
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked || document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked) {
    for (i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {
     obj[i].checked = checkState;
    }
   if (document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked) document.imageForm.select_all.checked = false;
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked || !document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked) document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked = false;
  }
 }
//-->
</script>

 <tr>
  <td bgcolor=ffffff><a href="./images/mu-spin/kyrka.jpg">kyrka.jpg</a></td>

Works on my machine's browsers now, all of them, the right way, I hacked it:

<script>
<!--
  function selectAll(checkState, selectStatus, obj) {
   if (document.imageForm.select_all.checked || document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked) {
    for (i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {
     obj[i].checked = checkState;
    }
   if (selectStatus.toLowerCase() == 'select') document.imageForm.deselect_all.checked = false;
   if (selectStatus.toLowerCase() == 'deselect') document.imageForm.select_all.checked = false;
  }
 }
//-->
</script>

 <tr>

This select all thing has been going on for a little
while now.
Here is a more simple and elegant function.
<script>
   function CheckAll(x) {
  for (var i = 0; i <
document.forms[x].elements.length; i++) {
    if(document.forms[x].elements[i].type ==
'checkbox'   ){
      document.forms[x].elements[i].checked =
!(document.forms[x].elements[i].checked);
    }
  }
}
// the argument X is the name or the index number of
the form in the document.
</script>

This should work in all browsers.
By the way if you are using phpbtree my php btree
code.
I suggest you get the newer version. I keeps getting
better.

Hi Folks:

I'm trying to get in touch with Tim Gales, but the emails keep bouncing 
back to me saying the host can't be found.  What's his phone number or 
perhaps he'll see this and give me a call.

Message-ID: <200404141110580515.1ED705CB@mail.nonreal.ro>

Hello.
I have a voice software witch enter in mySQL 5 new rows each minute: 

+----------------+-------------+---------------------+
| BoardID        | ActiveCalls | CurrentTime         |
+----------------+-------------+---------------------+
| dti(RTC SS7 2) |           0 | 2004-03-16 19:47:44 |
| dti(RTC SS7 1) |           0 | 2004-03-16 19:47:44 |
| dti(ALCATEL)   |           0 | 2004-03-16 19:47:44 |
| dti(ORANGE)    |           1 | 2004-03-16 19:47:44 |
| dti(RT-ISDN)   |           2 | 2004-03-16 19:47:44 |
+----------------+-------------+---------------------+
5 rows in set (0.54 sec)

Those rows are repeated each minute with new values for ActiveCalls. Anyone know a class or something capable to generate something just like mrtg. One chart for hour, another for day or week, month and so on for each dti ?
I was searching google and looking on thobias ( rrd tool ) for this but no luck.
Any suggestion will be more than welcome.
Thank you

Guys --

Can the people involved in this thread please take it off-list? This
has dragged on for a while and we've moved on from whatever PHP
connection there once was to a JavaScript tutorial.

JavaScript is a topic more suited for a general Web development list
(or private e-mail among yourselves) than NYPHP. When you finally come
up with the right answer, I'm sure everyone will be happy to read
about it, but I don't think we need all the intermediate steps.

Thanks.

Or for the NYPHP Front End list.
http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/front-end

That list is meant for client-side technologies in general, and their use
within the context of PHP applications in particular.

Everyone seems to talk about Zope/Plone/Python and im trying to figure out

Do they still have user group meetings @ Superfine?  The cms-list seems to
be down ...

I would say that is not a good "reason" to learn.

I got interested in python by seeing the gentoo portage system and it is a very powerful language. 
In my experience though, I would recommend learning "lower" level languages instead of additional
higher level languages. I.e. learn c, it is not a far shot once you have php down.

I sometimes assume that a lot of the advanced programmers on this list
already speak C. I wonder if that's so -- maybe I should put a survey on
the forum.

Anyway I've been looking for a good excuse to study C, having come at this
wonderful world from the top -- one of those non-programmer people who
started marking up HTML in the mid 90s, then got curious about how forms
get processed, and one thing led to another (and another, and another...)

Python looks like great fun, though.

Back in school I done C,C++ a bit of Java and even some assembly.

For open source hackers C is a must because it increases once potential at
solving really tricky problems that cannot be done with a scripting
language alone.

I am playing around with a bit Ruby right now (similar to Python). I also
like to learn some Prolog in the future maybe even Lisp.

Yea Python is another language with the Object Oriented in it. PHP will
have the Object thing too very soon. I dont seen nothing revolutionary in
it.

Low level C socket programming without a sandbox is complex + extremely
interesting to learn I must admit ...

The annoyances about a language are usually the things surrounding them, for
example the Python interpreter ... you can type "help", "copyright",
"credits", or "license" but to exit the thing you have to hit Ctl+Z+Enter @
exactly the same time a few times to break out ... :-) and typing "from X
import Y" can get tiresome ...

MySQL, which sells an open-source database of the same name, was nearly
unheard of in corporate technology circles a few years ago. Now the
company's competitively priced, easy-to-use database is becoming
increasingly popular with business customers looking for smaller,
less-expensive options.

Meandering on....I have a book that refers to C as a "high level"
language. What's lower than C? (The book is "The Art of Hacking" and it
describes stuff like, what a bytecode injection attack actually *is*.)

High-level essentially means that you're writing your program in a human
readable format, and that what you're writing is abstracted from how the
machine will understand it, which is why it goes through the process of
compilation.   Assembly code and raw machine code are low-level languages.

(Warning: I teach CS.)

Yes, it's worth it to learn Python.  As much as it is to learn C,
Java, Ruby, Smalltalk, Prolog, etc...  The more languages you know,
the closer you come to understanding how programs (and therefore
computers) really work.

Also, from a practical standpoint, the more skills you have, the more
hireable you are.  When an employer is looking for two people with PHP
and Python skills, and he's already found the PHP coder, you still
have a shot at getting the gig.

Then again, I'm a Computer Scientist, and I think programming and
learning new languages is as fun as, say, going to a ball game.  You
may choose to spend your free time other ways.

if I may be so bold to post a short caution so long as Jon 
brought up the subject of certs, I think this list wants to stay 
away from discussing "cert test questions and contents".  Bad 
juju man... we don't want to get that sort of reputation.  After 
all, a "don't discuss contents" statement was agreed to before 
taking the exam.

btw, I took the Core cert exam.

sorry if I'm being a lil paranoid here, but I think this needs 
to be communicated to the list members.

There is a difference also in the abstraction level of the 
different languages -- even amongst the 'high-level' languages. 

I often hear people say things like: "C is a lot more powerful, 
but then that's because it a low level language".

C is not really a 'low-level' language (as explained in the

...

Another important practical distinction is that a high-level language
is presumably portable between different computers.  A C program can
be written so that it will compile for any computer architecture.
(It's not necessarily the case that it will compile cleanly, or work
correctly, but it should be possible to write it so that it can, as
long as a C compiler and standard C libraries exist for the computer
or operating system in question.)

A low-level language from this perspective is fundamentally different.
If you write an assembly language program that will assemble correctly
for one computer, no matter how carefully you do it it generally will
not work correctly for a different kind of computer and probably could
not be made to work correctly for both different kinds of computer.
The only exception might occur if it were an extremely trivial program
and the two computers were quite similar, or coincidentally shared
very similar assembly languages.

The definition of a compiler or interpreter or virtual machine
includes the ability to read source code in a high-level language and
generate correct executable programs for different kinds of computers.

Whoah, I gotta debate that one.

(pulls up a stool)

I started as a 'jack of all trades, master of none.  And not just 
languages, but jobs too - hardware engineer, warehouse inventory 
management, truck driver for manufacturing, graphics artist/animator, 
accounting systems migration, information security, business 
development...  Fifteen years later I'm a 'jack of all trades, master of 
many'.  And when many are looking for work, I'm cutting projects loose

I totally agree with this perspective.  I have a similar experience:
almost all of my applicable technical skills I learned by doing.  The
important thing is to be completely realistic and honest with your
clients and yourself about what you can and can't do.

What I find best about broadening my experience across different
fields is when experience with one thing unexpectedly pays off for
something else.  "Wait a minute, I've seen something just like this
before!" you realize, only it involved a different
language/OS/computer architecture/disk type than the one you're
dealing with *but the same general type of solution* applies in both
cases.  You could search Google all day and you'd never find the
answer because the answer comes from a parallel but different line of
work.  I love it when that happens, because the customer is really
getting what they paid for -- experience.

I also like the sense of comfort it gives you when plunging into
oddball tasks where no one's the expert, e.g. "Can you make this
25-year-old unsupported APL program running on an old mainframe using
EBCDIC character encoding work correctly with data coming from a
custom VB COM component running on NT4 that interoperates with and
relies on stored procedures in a Sybase database hosted on SunOS
4.1.4?  We upgraded the environment and something broke."  I enjoy
those kinds of questions.  There are no experts for that sort of
thing, and only breadth of experience really counts and really helps.

The cost is that it takes time to build up experience.

Who is doing the presuming in your view? 

A language author creates a language to be useful.
If he/she is successful, i.e. the language proves to be 
useful, other people port it to their systems so they 
can also take advantage of it.

Maybe some authors of languages have a design goal of not 
burning any bridges when it comes to portability -- since 
they are confident their new language will be needed on many 
different types of systems, but by and large computer languages 
are created to get something done in one environment.

Even Java, which now even runs on my cell phone, was designed to 
run in a closed environment -- namely set top boxes.

No, I don't think portability has anything to do 
with being a high-level language.

I am, but I think this is not an uncommon view of a key advantage of
high-level languages.

> A language author creates a language to be useful.

At least in the case of C, a component of that usefulness was
portability across platforms, and I think today it is commonly
expected that portability across platforms is a key aspect of the
utility of high-level languages.  

Kernighan and Ritchie, the authors of C say about C in their classic
book "The C Programming Languages", 2nd ed., in the introduction:
"Although C matches the capabilities of many computers, it is
independent of any particular machine architecture.  With a little
care, it is easy to write portable programs, that is, programs that
can be run without change on a variety of hardware.  The standard
makes portability issues explicit, and prescribes a set of constants
that characterize the machine on which the program is run."

I think the last sentence pertinent to the ANSI standard is
particularly telling -- portability, which was implicit in the
language from very early on was made explicit in the standardization
process of the 70s - 80s. 

I am humbled to report, in the spirit of full disclosure, that the
text in the preface describes C as 'not a "very high level" language',
and the text in the introduction describes it thus: "C is a relatively
'low level' language."

So we seem to be in a semantic muddle.  Perhaps the correct
description would be: C is a standardized, portable relatively low
level language for a high level language which is not a very high
level language.

Maybe C would best be thought of as a middle level language; we could
call it a "mezzanine" language.

Or in the caes of K&R, I believe they did the first couple of ports
themselves.

In the case of K&R they were going for portability from early on so
that they could easily move this large program they had written called
"Unix" from one computer to another without having to rewrite huge
chunks of it ever time.

...

You may be right, but I don't believe that's the case with C/C++ and
Perl, to name just a few.

Well, this is a simplification.  The first prototype of Java (called
"Oak") was meant to run on a variety of set-top boxes (to get ready
for the coming "digital convergence").  It was meant to be processor
independent but to present a consistent programming environment and
language.  Evidently a contingent at Sun expected that something that
would be sort of a hybrid between cable modems, web tv,
movies-on-demand, and TiVO, probably working over the internet, was
going to be the next big thing in 1991.  Not completely wrong, but not
exactly right.

Well, I think it's a commonly associated feature, and a non-portable
high-level language would be a gross exception.  I suppose a vehicle
doesn't have to have seats to be a car, and I don't know if the
definition of "car" should include the idea that there are seats in
it, but it seems to me to be the convention.  Similarly, I think
portability is a commonly expected advantage to high level languages.

Of course none of this applies to C, since we have established, from
the words of its creators, that it is a mezzanine language.

Correction!  Sorry.  Only Dennis Ritche (not Brian Kernighan) was
involved in co-writing Unix at this point.  Of course his co-author
was one Ken Thompson.  However, all three worked at Bell Labs and
surely shared many common concerns and goals.

Some evidence exists that Ritchie thought about portability of both C
and Unix early.  Here's a web page linking to a paper on the issue:

http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/portpapers.html
"Papers about Unix Portability


 In 1976-1977 the Unix system was rendered portable, thus starting a
 continuing industry. The account by Steve Johnson and me,
 `Portability of C Programs and the UNIX System,' was published in the
 Bell System Technical Journal; it is now on-line as PDF, Postscript,
 or HTML formats."

Note the title talks about both C and Unix, pretty early on in the
life of the language.

The rest of this thread has focused on Python, and is ignoring the CMS part of
your question so I'll try to address that a bit...  Zope/Plone/CMF has a lot of
ideas and techniques to offer you in terms of frameworks and CMSs.

Zope provides a application framework to build applications, which is an area
that PHP distinctly lacks a strong leader in.  You may get hooked on Zope
features like granular permissioning, acquisition, automatically persistent
objects, and built-in templating (ZPT) and try to replicate them in PHP.

CMF/Plone is a nice CMS app built on that framework, taking advantage of Zope's
facilities while at the same time putting a user-friendly face on the
not-so-user-friendly ZMI.  The functionality it provides or can provide with
some additional work is far beyond anything that I've seen accomplished with
open sources PHP CMSs as easily, such as powerful workflows, versioning, roles,
etc.

Custom Zope/CMF/Plone development can be hard to break into.  In addition to
learning Python, you're learning a whole new method of building applications in
Zope's framework and integrating with Zope products.  Some of Zope and Zope
products are poorly documented, if at all, which can be very aggravating and
time-consuming.  How much of this affects you depends on what you wish to do
with Zope/CMF/Plone.  If you use it out of the box, you may not have much
difficulty at all, otherwise be prepared for the possibility of some long
archaeological digs through source.

Overall, I'd answer your question with a "Yes", with the above warning.

HTH,
Andrew

I was actually creating a composite picture of some of the most, uh,
interesting projects that I and my colleagues (including you) have
worked on.  I don't think that exact combination ever showed up, but
every single one of the pieces, and several in combination, down to
EBCDIC - ASCII translation/communication with NT 4, has been a piece
of a project that I or my teammates working with me have dealt with.

APL seems to attract a "special" kind of programmer.  I'll never
forget some wildly beaming A-plus enthusiasts at Usenix handing me a
sticker for it.  (A-plus is an APL related/derivative/mutant offshoot
from Morgan Stanley.)  The sticker was in psychedelic colors and
letters and said "A-plus: Awk on Crack".  You just don't see that kind
of marketing much.

You can find out all about A-plus here:
http://www.aplusdev.org/

Here's a cool-looking example program:
http://www.aplusdev.org/About/unique.html

I always thought programming languages needed more Greek letters,
arrows, and math symbols.  PHP would really take off it it would only
start using them.  :-)

Kernigan has said, "C is entirely the work of Dennis Ritchie,

Early C certainly did match the capabilities of the 'Digital 
Equipment Corp.'-like  machines of its day on which 
the Unix operating system was born. C operators bear 
such an uncanny resemblance to the underlying DEC assembly 
language instruction set, that an experienced Macro-11 
programmer (again of that time) might have tried looking up 
information on the SWAPB operator in the C language reference 
manual.

C was popularly thought of in its early days as a special-purpose 
language for Ken Thompson's experimental operating system.
I think most people agree that this proved eventually to be a 
misconception. Perhaps what clouded things was the way C seemed 
to evolve from Thompson's B language (which really was a special 
purpose language).

I am guessing at this, but I think that by the time the 
the book came out, the authors realized the C language could have 
more applications than just facilitating the porting of Unix.

Either way, C was ported to other Non-DEC like hardware and OSs, 
but only by creating what approaches being a Unix emulation 
layer in the runtime library for the different architectures.

Early C developers on non-unix platforms often used to say that they 
got NUXI 'd when their runtime implementation didn't implement the 
proper Unix (DEC) byte ordering.

My point here is that Ritchie may well have discovered the more 
general nature that C could become when he tried to implement 
the runtime library on different architectures.
(this is just conjecture on my part of course)

Now who's guilty of over-simplification (just joking) -- 
but there exits more than one layer to an operating 
system (hardly one program now matter how large). 
You know, like Linux is a kernel not an operating 
system.

Here again though, the runtime environment would provide a layer 
of abstraction -- this time as byte codes in a virtual machine.

Okay. The waters *are* rather murky here.
But maybe there is some relationship like:

B is to C as Oak is to Java.

If so, both roots of the languages seem to have started 
to help solve a specific problem as their main purpose for 
being, regardless of any later metamorphosis.

I would agree that people have come to expect a portable 
library with modern languages -- which in effect makes them 
portable.

It just strikes me that it is the level of abstraction or the 
distance from the hardware that is the main determining factor 
in where to place a language in terms of it being high level or 
low level.

And it was probably too harsh of me to say:
  "I don't think portability has anything to do
   with being a high-level language."

Sorry 'bout that.

Hey, nothing to be sorry about -- I enjoyed the conversation and I it
made me go and read something interesting about the history of C from
which I learned the story wasn't as simple as I thought.  I just hope
we didn't bore everybody with all this non-PHP stuff.

I actually couldnt get it compiled + ended up tunneling 3306 instead w/ ssh
...

I cant remember what the exact problem was but someone said the flag was
inoperable (< 4.0) and that the mysqli extension in PHP5 w/ > 4.1 was the
way (only way I think) to go ... which I still find kinda odd because Im
*sure* someone setups up MySQL w/ SSL (or everyone installs it localhost)
...

I had the same problem, an admin tool installed locally on a laptop ->
remote server and just opened the tunnel before running the tool.  I think
there are just presumptions that the db and scripting language will end up
on the same box :-\

What do you mean?  You can't find *that* type of info and conversation in
any book, its enjoyable, entertaining and educational.  (EEE+) :-)  The only
problem is if me or my future grandkids years from now are still programming

Message-ID: <407E865F.7060101@netzero.com>

Hello,
I know that there is a list dedicated to this kind of stuff but 
apparently the folks at php-gtk don't like me very much because I can't 
post to their list and haven't heard back from the list administrator. 
Anyway, I figure there has to be some one on this list who can help me.

I have been trying to get an object oriented php-gtk app working but I
am running into some problems.  It appears that if you connect a widget
to a method, the method is called statically.  My problem is that I want
the methods to set member vars.  Is there any way to get something like
this to work:

<borrowed from php-gtk archives with modifictaions>
class clicky {
    var $wasClicked = FALSE;

    function clicky() {
        $button = &new GtkButton('Clicky!');
        $button->connect('clicked', array(&$this, 'clickied'));
    }
    function clickied() {
      if ($this->wasClicked) {
        echo 'The button was already clickied!';
      } else {
        echo 'This is the first time the button was clicked!';
        $this->wasClicked = TRUE;
      }
    }
}

$clicky = new clicky;
</borrowed from php-gtk archives with modifications>

I've just started playing with HTML_QuickForm_Controller and was wondering
how to get it to play nicely with Smarty.

[raises garbage can lid to deflect flying tomatoes from Smarty- and
PEAR-bashers]

I googled around and found nothing but people asking the same question.
So I waded in and (more or less) figured it out by examining the source
and the examples and experimenting. Now I'm wondering if there'd be
interest in a little tutorial and/or presentation on this topic. (Although
I'd really need a more experienced (than me) volunteer editor to review my
spiel before I inflict it on live people.)

Php-gtk is not my area (tho I was able to successfully install it once).

Your code works in a non-gtk context, given the following pseudo-object 
(php 4.3.2 on osx):

class GtkButton {
  function GtkButton($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }
  function connect ($event, $callback) {
    $callback[0]->{$callback[1]}();
  }
}

Not sure if that helps or not, but if you can get a fake GtkButton to 
behave like the real GtkButton, maybe you can figure out why it doesn't 
work and route around the problem?

Is this how php-gtk handles callbacks?  I was under the impression that 
it was done statically.  So that with your example it would look more like:

function connect ($event, $callback) {
   $callback[0]::{$callback[1]}();
}

I think it has to be calling the methods statically because if I have 
two methods, one that sets the member var and the other that checks the 
value and reacts, I get very confusing results.

...
var $memberVar = FALSE;
...
$button->connect('event', array($this, 'method1'));
$button->connect_after('event', array($this, 'method2'));
...
function method1() {
   echo $this->memberVar;
   $this->memberVar = TRUE;
   echo $this->memberVar;
}
funciton method2() {
   if ($this->memberVar) {
     echo 'It worked';
   } else {
     echo 'It didn't work';
}
...

Method one will print exactly what you would expect, but when I get to 
method2, memberVar is FALSE again and I get 'It didn't work.'

Thanks,

My guess would be that you need to set the callback functions like:

$button->connect('event', array(&$this, 'method1'));
$button->connect_after('event', array(&$this, 'method2'));

With the ampersand they *should* be called correctly, whereas without 
the ampersand each will work on it's own *copy* of $this.

Hope this helps,

Dan

I hope that I am doing that otherwise I am going to feel like a big 
dummy.  I don't have the code with me now but I will try that when I get 
back in front of it.

Could be, don't know. I can see how that would be less than useful. In 
that case you may need to use yet another object to track state (blech):

function clickied() {
    global $state;
     if ($state->wasClicked) {
       echo 'The button was already clickied!';
     } else {
       echo 'This is the first time the button was clicked!';
       $state->wasClicked = TRUE;
     }
}

Were you looking for just how to do it?

ssh -fNg -L 3307:127.0.0.1:3307 user at host.com
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u user -pPASS db

* use IP not name, use different port so not to conflict w/ possible local
instal or kill mysqld before hand

If you do this on an ISP it may or may not work depending on how their fw is
setup in which case you may get an error stating the channel could not be
openned.

Hey everyone:

Just beginning to think about this stuff as I will probably take the 
opportunity to make my classes more rigid inside the new PHP5 class 
structure, and think a little better about how they're set up, and so 
forth.  Unlike many of you, I don't have the luxuries of large 
development teams inside a large organization, because I am dealing 
with very small clients (usually non-profit), and so I have to 
structure things as simply as possible for myself, to just save 
myself time.

I am not using PHP5, nor will I until the actual final version has 
been out for quite a while.  But, I stay on top of what's happening 
and had some questions for people who have played with a little.

Specifically, what does everyone think of the bundling of SQL Lite 
into PHP5?  My own publishing framework has been based on MySQL/PHP, 
but I was beginning to investigate the advantages of SQL Lite for 
small projects, and specifically how it integrates with PHP5.


Cheers,

I am in the same boat for a non-profit, my feelings are that MySQL is a
great product, however even with long term data it can be extremely
overkill.  And the worst part is when it goes down unexpected and you are
left with an app and no db.  SQL Lite does solve that problem.

Can it not be said that in some ways SQLLite is more advanced than 
MySQL?
Does MySQL support transactions, for instance? (Don't flame me, I'm 
here for PHP but use Postgres, and I haven't kept up with MySQL over 
the last two years).

SQLite is great when you're doing mostly database reads. If you're
writing lots of data, then it's not so hot.

The big advantage of SQLite is that there's no database to administer,
so it's always available. If you want to try it out, there's a version
in PECL that works with PHP 4.3.

Sorry I can't write more right now, but I'm using a weird keyboard, so
typing is slow. :)

Yea, MySQL does support transactions. Don't be put off my the "Lite"
in SQLite. It's full featured, but you're essentially accessing a
flatfile, so you can't do things like replication and GRANTs.

Other than that, SQLite supports transactions, triggers, UDFs (written in
PHP! This is wicked awesome!), subselects, and many other advanced
features.

Are there any type of easy admin tools for working with the file (either web
or gui based) that you know of?  I read once that you could not get metadata
info from it, has that changed?

I've only used the command line interface. I've gotten meta data from
the command line monitor tool, but I've never tried to get it using PHP.

Yup, that was the problem.  I was passing $this by reference to the two 
methods I thought were misbehaving but not to the methods that was being 
used to call those two methods.  So they were working on references of 
copies of my class.  Thanks for the help Dan and Chris.

There's a new ZEND IDE (3.5 Beta) at zend.com.
(which you can tryout for free)

There are some new features -- but the 
reason I am going to try it is that it 
has support for PHP 5.

Zend calls it "cutting edge PHP 5 development support".

I always say if you're going to use 'cutting edge' 
technology, be sure to pack plenty of band-aids.

So, so true. I very much like that and will be printing it and putting it on

also: outlook sucks for replies to lists. :P Too much editing to make it

Jon, I think the questioner wants an inverse of that function  - given a
numeric week of the year (and the year), return the numeric weekdays
contained within. I looked around and MCAL doesn't do it (can't get MCAL for
wind0ze anyway). I believe Java has a function for this, but I don't know
its source offhand.
 
However, restructuring the code such that the dates are returned via DB
query and programatically organized by their weeks using date() seems to be
the way to go, IMHO.

Well, you could add a week_of_year column and a day_of_week column to your
sql:
 
SELECT
    *, 
    DATE_FORMAT(date_column, '%y') as year,        // for the 2 digit year
    DATE_FORMAT(date_column, '%b') as month,    // for the 3 letter month
    DATE_FORMAT(date_column, '%e') as day
    DAYOFWEEK(date_column) as day_of_week,
    WEEK(date_column) as week_of_year,
    DATE_FORMAT(DATE_ADD(date_column, INTERVAL 6 DAY), '%e') as last_day
FROM my_table
ORDER BY date_column DESC
 
And then in your code, if the day of week is 0, you show the week number and
add 7 for the date of the last day of the week:
 
 
<?php // BEGIN LOOP ?>
    <?php if ($data['day_of_week'] == 0) { ?>
        Week <?= $data['week_of_year'] ?>
        (<?= $data['month'] ?> <?= $data['day'] ?> - <?= $data['last_day']
?>, <?= $data['year'] ?><br />
        ------------------------<br />
    <?php } ?>
    <?= $data['month'] ?> <?= $data['day'] ?>, <?= $data['year'] ?>
<?php // END LOOP ?>
 
Haven't tested it, but that's how I would probably go about it (maybe
combine a couple date formats for a long and short format or something, but
i figured split them in case the end of the week date happens to be in the
next month, then you would want to add another column for that month and
show it when necessary.
 
 
Good Luck
 
Mark

I am just starting to dig into the PEAR packages.

I was looking at David Sklar's "essential tools" book at Border's the other
day (after reading about it here) and noticed the section about QuickForm.

I didn't buy the book yet (it's in my cart at Amazon.com, should get it next
week), but have a quick question.

I have a bunch of sites that use very similar forms. It would be really
advantageous to me to write a class or functions to automate the generation
of these forms, hence I'm looking at QuickForm.

All of these forms submit to a form processor script called Phorm.

I can't find anywhere in the QuickForm docs how to generate a form that
submits to a script, or how to set the action attribute...it looks like
QuickForm wants to be the form generator and processor all at once.

Does anyone know of essential reading for QuickForm before my new book gets
here?

Thanks,
John Corry

You're right -- normally QuickForm wants to be the generator and 
processor all at once. You can change the action of the form by passing 
a new action as the third argument to the HTML_QuickForm constructor, 
though. For example:

$form = new HTML_QuickForm('myform','POST','/cgi-bin/phorm');

This makes "/cgi-bin/phorm" the action of the form printed by 
$form->display().

That's a huge hint, especially considering how sparse the
documentation is on the PEAR site.  Thanks, David.

No problem. Note that in the absence of documentation, the source code 
is the place to go. Sometimes that can be pretty hairy, but QuickForm is 
pretty good with its source comments. For example, the HTML_QuickForm 
class constructor (in QuickForm.php) starts out like this:

     // {{{ constructor

     /**
      * Class constructor
      * @param    string      $formName          Form's name.
      * @param    string      $method            (optional)Form's method 
defaults to 'POST'
      * @param    string      $action            (optional)Form's action
      * @param    string      $target            (optional)Form's target 
defaults to '_self'
      * @param    mixed       $attributes        (optional)Extra 
attributes for <form> tag
      * @param    bool        $trackSubmit       (optional)Whether to 
track if the form was submitted by adding a special hidden field
      * @access   public
      */
     function HTML_QuickForm($formName='', $method='post', $action='', 
$target='_self', $attributes=null, $trackSubmit = false)
     {

So you can sort of easily see what each argument does. Of course, you 
have to know that the constructor is where to look in the first place. 
It'd be much nicer to be able to look at pretty docs like PEAR DB has, 
but as hunting-through-source-code-to-see-how-something-works goes, 
QuickForm's not bad.

Chris,

just for curiousity, I looked your question up in David's new 
Essential PHP Tools book -- chapter 3 is dedicated to 
html_quickform...

as it turns out, the answer to that question is on the top of 
page 60 :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SPAM Killing,
	Invisible to Spiders - Dynamic Image Creation?
Message-ID: <20040416203150.29305.qmail@hosting33.com>

Trying to catch up on 800+ NYPHP listserve messages not including the individual ones since I switched to digest a couple of weeks ago. This list is VERY prolific but still manages VERY high ratio of gold to junk.

Hope this wasn't discussed already but people were discussing ways of dealing with SPAM once you've been targetted and sighted. As a web developer I would very much like to know what you are doing so you don't get SPAM in the _first place_.

Method 1
- - -
JavaScript assembles the email address so it displays to screen normally but a spider going through source code has more difficult time finding an email pattern. Are any of you data miners? Are spiders smart enough to get around this these days?

<script language=JavaScript>
<!--
username = "Joe_Smith";
domain = "nyphp.org";
document.write('<a href=\"mailto:' + username + '@' + domain + '\">');
document.write("Send your love to Joe Smith" + '</a>');
// -->
</script>


Method 2
- - -
Use PHP to split an email address into parts and display as:
Joe_Smith AT nyphp DOT com

Though I see this often on techy sites I am almost certain that spiders can easily figure this one out. Guess one could play around with the permutation to stay ahead of the spiders but that's kind of annoying to do.


Method 3
- - - 
Construct email as images. 
http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/rasmus19990124.php3

This seems to be the most secure method but is most annoying for legitamate users who would have to manually read and enter in an address to email someone with the highest possibility for user input error. 

Thanks.

I did this but I also added a contact form so someone can email without
typing the address if they didnt want to. I had not had people use the
online form so I guess they dont mind typing the email address.

If you attempt this with Referrer/URL checking (per your own domain) and list of known browsers it has been kind of effective although I don't do it 100% of the time.  At one time I was rewritting code as such to just post e-mail:

E-mail: <?= getEmail(MY_ID) ?>

If the request didnt come from my own domain it would be blank (although bookmarking + other quirks didn't work).  On the flipside, I find stripping emails from craigslist XML to be rather trivial ... its the only list I really data mine from.

As for spam killing once you have been targeting Im trying to write or figure out if bouncing the email manualy w/ a script can get you off some of these.

This is a link I use often as reference for design patterns. The examples
are in C# but are commented well and translate to PHP quite easily. A good
learning method is to just rewrite the patterns in php.

Good advice, no doubt. Thanks. But I have kind of a book addiction, so
I'll probably go out there anyway and score a book as well.

Message-ID: <BCA96989.1C51B%stephen@musgrave.org>


All -

I have a calendar application that requires me to set a minute offset in the
config file.  Since my server is in Phoenix and *always* on MST, and the
client is in NYC and either in EST or EDT, the offset is -120 and -180
respectively.

I was wondering if there was a way to find out if the current date/time is
within the range of daylight savings, even if the server doesn't adjust its
time for daylight savings time.  I need to be able to switch the offset
between -120 and -180 automatically.

Thanks,

Stephen

should take to approach, logically.  Client has enormous cash flow and 
is willing spend wantonly, however, it is made clear to me the client 
will NOT accept any 3rd party source of any kind within the application, 
every single thing must be built by me, by hand.  Call it the DIY 
application approach if you must, but that's it.

Everything else is custom-built by me and I am about 40% completed on 
the search engine, however, I am running into serious methodology 
problems because of the complexity of the means by which a search can be 
done, consider the enormity of combinations of boolean conjoinings that 
can take place.

If any of you ever approached anything similar to this, hopefully under 
the same conditions as I, how have you approached it?

Thanx
Phil

Does this work?

function isdst($tz) {
    putenv("TZ=$tz");
    $ar = localtime(time(),true);
    putenv('TZ=MST'); // Since you're in Phoenix
    return $ar['tm_isdst'];
}

if (isdst('EST5EDT')) {
  // is dst
} else {
  // isn't dst
}

BTW, there's lots of information about dates, times, time zones, dst,
in Chapter 3 of PHP Cookbook. David is a date and time fiend. :)

Message-ID: <9569EA9A-9238-11D8-A987-000502F1DDFC@click3x.com>

Hello people,

I've been developing this little extranet thing on my mac and now that 
it seems ready to fly I uploaded it onto my web server but now I get 
these 2 errors:

Warning: Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already sent 
(output started at /var/www/xtranet-staging/upload.php:1) in 
/var/www/xtranet-staging/upload.php on line 3

Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already sent by 
(output started at /var/www/xtranet-staging/upload.php:1) in 
/var/www/xtranet-staging/upload.php on line 91

Basically I know why I get these warnings, ie: I'm sending headers 
twice (the second warning is caused by the 
header("location:upload.php") function call). What I don't get is why 
are headers being sent without my knowledge? This works fine just 
running off my home computer so what's the deal? Is there something in 
the php.ini file that I need to enable or disable?

Thanks, as always, for your help.

You may not really be sending headers twice.  You will get that warning 
anytime any information is sent before you try to send headers.  If 
there is a print or an echo or even just characters outside of <?php ... 
?> then you have already sent information.  Check that you are not 
printing any strings made up of just white space or that all of your 
files start with <?php (no spaces or new lines or html) and end 
immediately after ?>

One way to help work around this is to enable the output_buffering
php.ini configuration directive:

; - output_buffering = 4096
; [Performance] Set a 4KB output buffer.  Enabling output buffering
; typically results in less writes, and sometimes less packets sent on
; the wire, which can often lead to better performance.  The gain this
; directive actually yields greatly depends on which Web server you're
; working with, and what kind of scripts you're using.

Ob plug: This is discussed in Recipe 8.18 of PHP Cookbook. :)

Your best bet is to use the version bundled with PHP itself by using 
the configure option --with-gd

You may need other libraries (and custom configure switches to enable 
php support) depending on what kinds of images you'll be generating.  
Read up: http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.image.php

Also, if you just want PNG, JPEG, XPM and ttf fonts, you should check 
this out:

I think these errors are pretty clear, but just to paraphrase, this tells
you that you have output on line 1 of upload.php. Later, on line 3, you
try to start a session, the the session cache limiter cannot be sent
(because it consists of HTTP headers, and you have previous output).

> Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already sent by 
> (output started at /var/www/xtranet-staging/upload.php:1) in

This is an almost identical warning. The same output on line 1 that caused
the headers to be sent is a problem when you get to line 91 where you are
apparently using the header() function to try to add your own. Once your
script outputs anything, the headers are sent, and you can no longer add
headers like this. PHP is just letting you know that this header cannot be
added, and it continues on.

> twice

The best way to make a problem difficult to solve is to make an erroneous
assumption. :-)

> header("location:upload.php")

While you're at it, you may want to fix your Location header to be of a
compliant format:

header('Location: http://example.org/path/to/script.php');

> What I don't get is why are headers being sent without my knowledge?

Headers are sent for every page. How would you like to be notified? :-)

Just kidding. You can check to see if headers have been sent with the
headers_sent() function, but there's no way to try to send them yourself.
It's an implicit operation.

There are basically two steps involved with the content generation phase,
which is where PHP operates. PHP first has the ability to manipulate
headers (whether through the header() function or as a side-effect of
something else). It then gets to send the content. As soon as you begin to
generate content, PHP says, "Oh, I guess you're done manipulating headers.
Hey Apache, here is my list of header modifications. I'll be sending
content now."

> This works fine just running off my home computer so what's the deal?

You may have output buffering enabled for every script on your home
computer. This causes all output to be buffered and only really output at
the very end of the script (or when it is flushed with a function,
whichever comes first).

I guess the confusing thing is really that header() doesn't affect when
headers are sent, which is what many people seem to think.

Hope that helps.

Message-ID: <200404191955.27746.henry@beewh.com>

Hello all:

I'm working on site that uses mod_rewrite to handle urls. I hope someone can 
help me with a problem I'm having. I read A LOT trying to find the answer, I 
guess my brain too tired.

What I need to do is the following....
whenever someone goes to
www.mydomain.com/yachts/argument1/argument2.html

make this .php script handle it:
www.mydomain.com/yachts/section.php?lang=arg1&section=arg2

This works now with this in my htaccess file:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule   ^yachts/([^/]+)/([^/]+)\.html$ 
/yachts/section.php?lang=$1&section=$2

The problem is that I want this to happen ONLY when arg1 is one of the 
following:
en
es
fr
de
sw
it

And when arg2 is one of the following:
yachts
charter
boatyards
service
specials

I read that I have to use RewriteCond in my .htaccess file. This is what I 
have and it doesn't work.

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} 
!^yachts/(en|es|fr|sw|de|it)/(yachts|charter|boatyards|service|specials)\.html
RewriteRule   ^yachts/([^/]+)/([^/]+)\.html$ 
/yachts/section.php?lang=$1&section=$2


Thank you and any help anybody can give is appreciated.
Henry

Keep it simple. Use the basic mod-rewrite and then have the php  
destination file redirect on any invalid parameters.

Hello,

I've been trying to install PHP 4.3 with the bundled version of GD. 
Configuration, apparently goes well, but when building the install I get this 
error:

ext/zlib/zlib.lo: file not recognized: File truncated

I even downloaded GD and all dependent libraries  and tried using them, with 
the same result.

Then, when trying to build the installation withouth GD I get this error:

ext/ctype/ctype.lo: file not recognized: File truncated

I've been reading around, and I haven't found any valuable reference. Any ideas?

Uh...
This is pretty weird...

I just moved a site from the old server (HE.net) to a new server
(rackspace.com).

The new server has php 4.3.4, old one was 4.0 something I think.

I just got a CC'd an email (conference registration website) confirmation
that someone registered (generated by the site when a registration is
successful) and it isn't showing up. Outlook displays the HTML code rather
than a rendered email.

Wtf? It worked last week.

I'm not sending 2 separate versions, just HTML (I know, I know..)

Why did it break?

I could be wrong but did you update w/ the Microsoft patches this week?
(there were like 5 or so), from what I gathered on sec-lists and my own
experience seems to be causing alot of IE/OE/Outlook problems ...

I did update windows/IE...

I just set up a test page...simple, simple. Load the script and it sends me
an <h1> tag...same thing. I get the headers at the top of the page followed
by the code.

Then I got the idea to call the problem script off of the old server. I did
and it sent me the HTML email...perfectly. But the same script running on
the new server sends text: Headers at the top of the page followed by the
HTML code.

Another thing I notice is the From: and Reply To: fields aren't getting set
on the new server...when I get the email, the 'from' field just contains
'root at name.ofserver.com'

Is it something weird with PHP 4.3.4?

You need to edit your sendmail_from configuration directive.

What does your php.ini file look like @ around the SMTP/Sendmail part? ...

I think I found the problem...

It was with the message headers.

On the old server (and according to the php docs) headers looked like:
$header .= "From: me at mydomain.com\n\r";

On the new server, most of those weren't working, so I started messing with
the line endings....
$header .= "From: me at mydomain.com\n";
That seems to work.

Thanks for the help.

The line feed ending bit of the code keeps changing as people try to
get it to work with the maximal number of servers. Some like
"\n"; others like "\n\r"; etc.

\n\r?  Surely, you mean \r\n.  RFC 2822 specifies CRLF line endings,

Does anyone know a fix to the bug with Apache 2 and uploading?  I have a script that uploads photos, but the files show up mangled...  It happens somewhere in the POST operation.  Any thoughts?  Install is an out of the box RH Enterprise 3.0.

Hi List.  

My status: Brain dead
NEEDED: How do I assign the retrieved data to unique arrays?

Henry and Dan form this list helped me to get at this stage where I am
retrieving the data from a mysql table.  

Now, It is very embarrassing but after I get the data read in (code below),
I for the love of PHP, can not make unique rows or dynamically assign the
data.  I tried the following:
$plot=array();
$i=0;

 while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($resultID)) {

	foreach($row as $field) {
	$plot[$i]=$field;
	$i++;
	}


It seems to either go to the last row of data, or if I do:
$data1=$array[0]);

 or so, I get one line which is fine but than, as soon I do:
$data1=$array[0];
$data2=$array[1];
 ... more like this...

than at 4th or 5th $data5, etc. it tells me that it is undefined (going back
to where all the data was read in the first iteration-I think)

WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO:
All I need is that the data I get read in (thx H & D), to get it assigned to
an array dynamically or manually per row, which becomes my one set of data
that I could use.  So If I had 10 rows, I will get 10 unique arrays that I
could use with jpgraph for a multi-line graph.

I am afraid my novice status in PHP is not letting me write or understand a
better "for or do..while" code that could do the job.  Can you help?

Not using SSL + IE by any chance?

That's just a wild shot in the dark, I haven't personally noticed any 
problems POSTing files with Apache2.

The problem is that $field is a reference. You are assigning the value 
of $plot[$i] to the refernce $field.  The place that $field points 
changes with every iteration of the foreach loop.  That is why all of 
your entries in plot end up being the same.  Try this:

  while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($resultID)) {

  	foreach($row as $key => $field) {
  	$plot[$i]=$row[$key];
  	$i++;
  	}

It isn't the cleanest or most elegant but I think it should work for 
what you need.

I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do, but if I get the general
idea, may I suggest:

$i = 0;
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($resultID,MYSQL_NUM)) {
	$plot[$i]=$row;
 	$i++;
	}
}

which should provide count($plot) arrays such that print_r($plot) returns:

Array {
	[0] => Array ( [0] => pt01, [1] => pt02, [N] => pt0N),
	[1] => Array ( [0] => pt11, [1] => pt12, [N] => pt1N),
	[2] => Array ( [0] => pt21, [1] => pt22, [N] => pt2N)
	...
	[N] => Array ( [0] => ptN1, [1] => ptN2, [N] => ptNN),
}

and so forth

Is this the data structure you're after, or is something missing?

Nope.  it seems to double the size of the image file and then completely
corrupts it.  I can't even view the result in a browser.  People have fixes
but none have seemed to work just yet.

Actually, that is not what is happening.  The problem is that there are 
2 loops at work here, when only one is necessary.

The outer (while) loop is iterating over the rows in the result as 
expected, but the inner (foreach) loop is then iterating over each field 
in every row, and assigning the value to the $plot array.

Given a table like:

1, test1, hello
2, test2, tiger

You would end up with $plot looking like:

array (
   0 => 1,
   1 => test1,
   2 => hello,
   3 => 2,
   4 => test2,
   5 => tiger
);

When what you really want is:

array (
   0 => array (1, test1, hello),
   1 => array (2, test2, tiger)
);

The simplest way to achieve this is:

$plot = array();
while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($resultID)) {
     $plot[] = $row;
}

what's the software you're using to upload the pics?

is this php based (I'm assuming) if so install gallery.menalto.com and use
the test for bugs features in the installer - this generally shows you where
the problem lies - esp since the gallery project is so diverse

Here is a link which  may help:
http://fossil.wpi.edu/docs/howto_build_kernel.html

It is a kind of a step-by-step outline of 
building a Suse kernel and limited in scope.

I have the feeling that you are running into problems 
which are beyond the scope of this outline.

Still it might be of some use.

Jon -- I wrote a kernel build procedure lesson for a Linux 
class... it's 'bare bones'.  It just includes the build 
instructions but doesn't go into all the actual kernel parms in 
make menuconfig (or its GUI counterpart make xconfig). 
Otherwise it would have been screenshot city  :)

If you need more help than the link Tim provided, I could 
probably go into my courseware and cut those instructions out.

You obviously don't run gentoo ;)

rebuilding the kernel is pretty easy as it is often done.
here is how I do it in my gentoo boxes everytime there is a new kernel
out.. so often enough :)

`mount /boot`
`cd /usr/src/linux`
`make menuconfig`

select your options, menuconfig is so easy it is ridiculous.. 
then just do a:
`make dep && make clean bzImage modules modules-install`
`cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot`

depending on your arch for the i386 dir obviously, but menuconfig is
very cool if you have not used it. be careful with putting in things
that you are not sure of and make backups of your current working kernel
and make it available through whatever boot manager you are running
(lilo/grub) which is explained in the config files for both lilo and for
grub.

Otherwise, I would recommend looking over some of the gentoo docs (which
are not all gentoo-centric)
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/index.xml

hope that helps a little..

The problem I have is in regards to modules ... seems that everytime I
recompile pcmcia-cs and try to attach the new kernel to grub I get a nice
kernel panic every time and its using pretty much the same config file.
Thanks for all the recomendations.

This is actually RedHat 9 ... not Gentoo which Ive heard is great, but Im
too chicken to run @ the moment w/ so much work :-\

I understand that when rebuilding you have this massive .config file that
can be edited a bunch of ways but when something is stated as "modular" is
it the fact that maybe the config file is saying something else?

(this whole thing has to do with upgrading a HostAP driver for a new Seneo
wifi card which is requiring a new kernel, my RPM had this built in which is
fine but it wont work for him w/ this card).

Id actually like to learn how to accomplish this kernel building once and
for all lol.

Hey folks, 
 
(Sorry if this is a repost, my webmail client says it was sent, but it
didn't show up in my mail - apologies in advance!!!)
 
I need some clarification and a little help: 
 
I'm looking at SQLite, and would like to use it in PHP 4. From what I've
gathered, this means that I have to use Pear. Is this correct? 
 
If this is the case, I can't seem to get the connection string for SQLite
right, or I'm doing something else wrong. I get an getCode is returning a
-4, and I get "DB Error: not found". Anyone have any examples or experience
with these? I admit I am new to both. 
 
Thanks,

You don't really need PEAR per se ... you just need the extension ...

http://pecl.php.net/package/SQLite

However I beleive PEAR::DB support it which would be better to use because in case you want to switch to MySQL later on for example you will be rewritting your db code.  

To use the extension you need to enable it in your php.ini and you are good to go.

sqlite_open("db.sqlite", 0666, $err);
resource sqlite_open ( string filename [, int mode [, string &error_message]])

Modules do take the longest to compile.

How do you recompile the pcmcia-cs modules (actual keystrokes and
messages would be helpful, thanks)? 

It's been awhile since I compiled a kernel (at least six months), but
did you modify the make file to use the "kernel compiler" as opposed to
gcc?  (I don't think I've compiled a kernel under RH9, so it may not be
necessary, but...)

Not that I'm aware of.  The different config-makers do a pretty good job
of writing a sane .config file.  Have you used anything other than "make
config", "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig"?

And why won't it "work for him w/ this card"?  Did you need to
apply patches?  Any errors during the compile?   What does the kernel
panic say?

Inquiring minds want to know. ;-)

Like most things in Linux, it's fairly straightforward, but it's
a narrow straightforwardly. ;-)

the funny thing - 
most of those software packages noted are not the problem

it appears that everything is a module that "has been reported that...."

IMHO - you shouldn't place blame on a a piece of software which isn't
causing the problem
if the modules followed the devguide then there's almost no chance of not
having sanitized input

(specifically postnuke - which I've watched for a real SecFocus article for
quite some time)

and the response...

btw, the writeup I mentioned won't help with this specific

If you are working from an existing RH9 machine, I can assure you that 
you'll never replicate the kernel tweaks from RedHat to get a 
similarly-configured kernel.

The easiest way to deal with this is to install the kernel-source RPM, 
and build from there.  I had to do this on a machine that was using ext3 
filesystems, as RedHat's kernel tweaks appear to be somewhat proprietary 
(or I never figured out how to duplicate that functionality with source 
from kernel.org).

When you install the kernel-source RPM, you will see in those 
directories that they provide example config files for different 
architectures - this will give you the system that you are looking for...

HTH,

This is the exact problem in a nutshell ... I can get the RPM source with
the *old* driver while the new driver requires a newer kernel and it is a
"RedHat" thing because they are more proprietary ... I dont want to post my
entire barrage of error messages until I try a few things first (reinstall
the RPMs completely) ... I think I made the mistake of compiling the source
code directly for the modules (like pcmcia-cs) vs. getting the RPMs ... I
also had the cross compiler setup for building Zaurus apps which I think was
a no-no.  I should have went w/ Debian or Gentoo when I had the chance.

Just need some time to tinker ... thank you all for your wonderful
suggestions ...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP - GTK as alternative to an Applet?
Message-ID: <40868FA9.5060704@adnet-sys.com>

I read up on some info regarding GTK which has the ability to run as a 
client-side programming GUI interface, much like an applet.  I am 
looking at means of creating alternatives to applets that can be 
embedded into webpage HTML as <object> instances, due to the recent 
global instability (and sketchiness) of applets, and saw somewhere about 
GTK having such a capability as well, provided the user downloads the 
"runtime environment".

I looked up info on gtk.php.net and http://gtk.php.net/resources.php and 
www.gtk.net and found only a smattering of information.  If anyone knows 
of any exhaustive resource of usage of GTK using PHP (and not C, ugh!), 
please let me know, or if you've ever used GTK in building GUI 
applet-like interfaces.

Thanx
Phil

Bingo -- recompiling the kernel is a pretty straightforward operation if 
you start with a working config and only change one or two things. 
Apparently that's even true on RH if you install the right rpms and 
don't need something beyond what you're given.

<rant>
Given the obliqueness of the rpm system, unnecessary daemons running by 
default, and proprietary tweaking of the kernel and filesystem layout, 
I'm not surprised that Red Hat is as popular as it is. I'm considering 
updating my standard response to people who ask for tech support: "I 
don't do windows, and I won't wear the dumb hat."

Now, I know that gentoo users are *known* as being kind of preachy but
there really is a good reason for that.

<gentoo pimping>
It is worth it to learn, in addition you learn a lot about how linux
works and how linux systems are set up and where things are.

If you have ever used BSD, in particular OpenBSD, and need to build
specific installations it is perfect. Also, things like upgrades that
don't clobber your configs is built in, and these things are easily
automated. Everything is basically in portage and updated continuously,
every morning there is something new/updated in there. Some people
complain about the time to install, from a stage 3 (pre built) you can
be in X and working in no time flat.

I have been trying to get work to let me migrate current servers and
also set up a portage "updates" server for our datacenter (so we control
which upgrades go in and don't generate too much outside traffic). As we
could have an easy, and most importantly, automated solution for
handling upgrades on hundreds or thousands of servers vs what they are
doing now. I suspect that netops is against it for obvious reasons (job
sec.) as the current base of redhat servers requires constant
maintenance by a team of people.

Anyway, check it out if you get some time. Most of our core developers
are now using gentoo exclusive these days and I use it on servers to
awesome effect (some people will state for some reason to not use it on
servers?).
i.e. this server runs several domains on apache and handles a 20k+
requests/day + qmail/vpop + mysql + data collection/gathering + a
neuralnet system that is working with news and stock data and runs the
openmosix kernel (latest) and is 'node 1' on a four node cluster:
11:59:18 up 165 days, 22:16,  1 user,  load average: 0.10, 0.10, 0.09

Last time it was rebooted was when I needed to move the box, otherwise
that uptime would be another 200 days more and that box is completely up
to date as of 4am today.

Anyway.. enough gentoo evangelism...

Knowing this is a handicap when it comes to maintaining Red Hat systems, 
and RH is the flavor of the moment with the people who spend the money.

Then again, anyone who learns Linux via Gentoo and then uses that 
knowledge to reverse engineer what RH is doing (and isn't driven insane 
in the process) will have serious job security. Also, I'm relying on 
that person to produce a RH port of the Gentoo portage system so that I 
can finally do automated from-source installs.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated kernel packages resolve security vulnerabilities
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2004:166-01
Issue date:        2004-04-21
Updated on:        2004-04-21
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:
Cross references:
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2004:065
CVE Names:         CAN-2004-0003 CAN-2004-0109 CAN-2004-0177
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated kernel packages that fix several minor security vulnerabilities are
now available

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 9 - athlon, i386, i586, i686

3. Problem description:

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

iDefense reported a buffer overflow flaw in the ISO9660 filesystem code.
An attacker could create a malicious filesystem in such a way that they
could gain root privileges if that filesystem is mounted.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0109 to this issue.

Solar Designer from OpenWall discovered a minor information leak in the
ext3 filesystem code due to the lack of initialization of journal
descriptor blocks.  This flaw has only minor security implications and
exploitation requires privileged access to the raw device.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0177 to this issue.

These packages also contain an updated fix with additional checks for
issues in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
CAN-2004-0003 to this issue.

Additionally, hardening of the mremap function was applied to
prevent a potential local denial of service attack.

All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain
backported security patches that correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

If up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL
Certificate Errors, you need to install a version of the
up2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of
up2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be
downloaded directly from the RHN website:

https://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt

5. RPMs required:

Red Hat Linux 9:

SRPMS:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/9/en/os/SRPMS/kernel-2.4.20-31.9.src.rpm

athlon:

Message-ID: <BA3771B3-93D7-11D8-A916-000502F1DDFC@click3x.com>

hello-

is it at all possible for imagecreatefromgif() to work if I'm running 
php 4.1.2?
I read on php.net that GIF support was removed after GD 1.6 and then 
that it was reinstated in read-only mode in the GD bundled with php 4.3 
so does that mean that php versions prior to 4.3 running GD 2.0 or 
higher don't have GIF support?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Search for NYPHP List Archives available (alpha ver)
Message-ID: <40875543.7020104@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I have been wanting to search through the treasure of information 
contained in the NYPHP archives from 2002 to date.
Thankfully, the guys at nyphp.org made the whole archive available as a 
(Unix mail) mbox file.

I used a utility from Fookes software (fookes.com) called Mailbag to 
extract these files as a big csv file. (Originally I thought I would use 
Mailbag's built-in search feature, but that proved too cumbersome to 
use. Plus, I wanted to customize the output of the search.)

 I then imported that file into a MySQL database table, and enabled 
MySQL fulltext search for that table. (I had to do a manual search and 
replace with another Fookes program, Notetab, to get certain character 
escaped. E.g. quotes and dollar signs.)

I then added on a PHP search interface to it.

With a lot of luck I seem to have got a basic version working. Having 
this large set of information publicly searchable will no doubt be 
useful to others.

 For example:
http://www.ceruleansky.com/nyphp_mail/index.php?q=xml-rpc

I am not sure if it works perfectly yet (since it is just a day or two's 
work). (I  built on some functions which I had written before, so it 
went relatively fast ...)  It currently returns a set of up to 25 
matches. There is no built-in support for displaying messages by thread, 
or for fine grained searching (by field or with boolean expressions).

Please try out this alpha version and let me know if it works and if it 
is of use.

Best Regards,
- Jay Sheth

Threaded views might be good. That way you can see the context of
messages. Otherwise looks pretty cool.

Hey cool, I've already found some apache testing errata about which I was
dreading the idea of googling.

so far, so good - but if this is an RFI for features, I strongly suggest
these three:
a date-sort (maybe also date-constraint?) option, highlighting matched
keywords (a la google) and possibly a scoring (match-strength/confidence)
function.

But definitely a good start!

PS: I realized that the date-contraint suggestion is part of the
boolean-search logic you haven't implemented. If you go through with it,
don't forget date range constraints :)

PPS: Notetab is *great*. Any word on if Fookes is going to add
context-highlighting to it?

Next NYPHP meeting (Tues April 27) is going to have 
an introduction to Clew. Anyone who dreads 'googling' 
(and I'm with you there) will probably find Clew to 
be very interesting.

Hey kids, I want to collect everyone's (cogent) thoughts on what scripts
they find most effective for testing out new Apache installations. I'm
looking at load-balancing, max throughput, max concurrent sessions, and
things of that nature. I'd like to be able to stress-test and shakedown any
new LAMP or WAMP servers we build. I've only just begun this research and
I'm not an Apache geek by any stretch, so any input is graciously welcomed.

A Java-lover recently demoed Apache's Jmeter for me and it looks like 
what you want. There's a bit of a learning curve there, but you can 
create complex test scripts that follow paths through your site and act 
a lot like human users.

I still like ab, too.

As Joel explained, ab is a command-line tool for benchmarking server 
performance.
You'll find it at apache/bin/ab

man ab for the gory details.

If you just need to pound a page, ab is the easiest way. If you need an 
army of threads to step through a site, providing form input and some 
degree of timing, it might be worth it to learn Jmeter.

Right on, getting better hits on the list than I got on Google - sooooo much
chaff. Seems I have this problem where I use search terms that make sense to
me, but not to "normal" (non-geek) users, so I always get tons of useless
but matched noise at the top of my results.

My compatriot here actually said he was looking for "Something like what IIS
provides for [those metrics]" so I think I will have him look at JMeter to
start. I am usually the one that codes tools and widgets (my absolute
favorite job) so the learning curve will be more mine than his ;)

I'm gonna miss you guys when I'm gone these next two weeks! (No, I will not
set an out-of-office, don't worry).

The Microsoft Web Application Stress Tools may come close and it is a 
free download:

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/intranet/downloads/webstres.mspx

You need to run it on a Windows machine, but you can use it against any 
web server you like.

I personally like this idea ... something I ended up doing a while back in
JSP was w/ Alice for mailing lists (procmail) and forums ... it ended up
being a PHP version for PHPBB (without forum subscriptions) ...

http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=24191

You had 2 sides, one where "admin" type people would post to the list and
"machine learning" would take over where AIML/XML was written and made
available to other users for their questions.  Pretty much like an always
updating FAQ via a mailing list and answers would show up @ bottom of the
email or to the user directly.  The email address and a Key: header would be
used for authentication which Clew seems to use (although I havent followed
it lately).

This is a good start.

Didn't they used to call this "Wilbur" or some cutesy name like that? if
they DID call it Wilbur then they probably dropped that nomer in favor of
W3C's "HTML 3.2 'Wilbur'"

not sure if anyone has been noticing the flood of "noise" as Chris calls
it. I am calling it crap/spam/junk... It seems google is overrun by spam
and spammy sites. I know they did a big thing back in november to run
them out, but it only seems to have made the problem worse. 

Each month I keep seeing a steady decline in what is in google and find
that it takes longer to get to something that is not trying to sell me
viagra, penis enlargement, gambling etc.

DMOZ (Which is used by google as a marker for pagerank) is flooded by
editors putting their own sites in and a huge amount of bad links and
half the sites the domains have expired and now point to some overture
listings. I ran a survey of DMOZ data and posted the results here:
http://tagword.com/dmoz_survey.php 
After running further tests scanning for overture listings/duplicate
content or redirects.. about (maybe) 60-62% of DMOZ is 'not' pointing to
spam so all those 'editors' are doing a seriously bad job. The data they
provide is utter crap.

anyway, I miss the old google that was not concerned with raking in
profits and just worked. The spam in engines like webcrawler and lycos
is why everyone went to google in the first place. Where is nutch?

I think what you have to do is look @ the exact root of the problem ... the
"Internet" is not divided among educational purposes (like it once was) and
commercial purposes, its a mixed bag of crap.  Have you ever seen any of the
affiliate marketing sites?  Its almost like they *encourage* spam and bad
links ... and every site is making it easier for others to make money
through affiliation which means only more crap.  I spent the last month or
so figuring this out because my wife decided to ecom her stuff and I setup a
site and looked into affiliating / adsense / adwords / overture / etc and
came to the same conclusion as you that Google is deteriating away for
research use and that there is no reason for that "Im Feeling Lucky" button
anymore.

hahahahahaha.. yea..
I don't think I have hit the I'm feeling lucky in a long .. long time..
and yea, that button is worthless now.

It is just frustrating loosing the ability to find what you need to find
especially in light of the fact that we have had a few good years of
being able to find anything in a flash... So, being spoiled, it is now

im running on something i would consider adequate, Thinkpad T20 w/ 512 + XP
and have really been wanting a super PHP-based IDE which is what the Zend
IDE is.  i love it, it has alot of bells and whisles and you press a button
and get the kitchen sink *but* it is not a native app and i really knock
Java apps that should have been done natively.

it took about 15 minutes to start the app and 15 minutes to close the app.
i turned off OS L&F which really does some damage but cant find anything
else that would load up windows faster, tabbing takes a few seconds to draw
in ... has anyone else tried running the app on an "adequate" machine.

Yeah, I have to agree. I use windows to do 'everyday chores'

Hi All,

I'm looking for a solution to send a web page (preferably using a php 
form)  via email.
The problem is that:
1 - The page itself is only viewable after a user has logged into the 
system.
2 - The page includes images. 

For example:
1. Joe logs into system
2. Joe views a protected page
3. Joe send protected page to Sam via email
4. Sam gets email and can view "page" without logging into system.

Originally, we were using PDFs for this, but it reached a point where 
the PDFs no longer look the same as they do in a browser or email client.
Currently I'm looking into using MHT files, but haven't found any PHP 
(or unix for that matter) code to create MHT files. FYI - MHT files are 
basically entire web pages, images and all, saved as a single file. You 
can create MHT files in IE by doing save as - web archive, single file 
(*.mht)

Thanx,
Ophir

Probably no way around that ...

When in doubt look @ the RFC ...

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2557.txt

I thought the PEAR class provided this ...

"message/rfc822" ...

I've never seen a Java GUI app than ran fast on any platform. Well, you
can get them to run fast if you have a fast computer, awesome video card,
and lots of memory ("migs and megs of memories"), but they're still going
to be an order of magnitude slower than a good C or C++ GUI application.

I'm not sure why so many companies use Java for cross-platform GUI
development, since it's possible to use C or C++ instead. You may as well
use PHP-GTK. :-)

Message-ID: <40883F5B.90008@ceruleansky.com>

Hi Chris,

thanks for your feedback. I will definitely try to add a "restrict to 
month and/or year" option. Also - highlighted keywords would be a good 
idea too. I am not sure how I would do that exactly ... maybe someone 
use of regular expressions, or just str_replace ... (I'm not sure yet).

I am relatively new to regular expressions (having not had to use them 
much before). Going off on this regex tangent:
The last two issues of PHP Architect ( www.phparch.com ) has great 
articles on regular expressions ( Perl-style regexes). For anyone who is 
interested, I made a list of all the good regular expression articles I 
found:
http://www.moztips.com/wiki/index.pcgi?page=RegularExpressions

PHPBuilder also has some great articles on POSIX-style regular 
expressions (linked in the list above). I find POSIX style expressions 
much easier than the Perl-style ones somehow. (I like the idea of 
[:alpha:] instead of a-zA-z).

On another note, the upcoming April 27th meeting sounds very 
interesting. Clew sounds really cool.

Best Regards,

- Jay
PS: I had an idea today: maybe the scripts powering the searchable NYPHP 
archives should be made into separate project / product. I could use the 
same scripts to search through the old copies of my archived email.

Have you ever seen the imap functions in action? They do threading now, 
too, by references headers or subject.

Not the most efficient thing for public archives, but for searching your 
old mail they rock.

If you have the early gif libraries (or libungif) it will.

Or the hosts in question have their routers off line in order to upgrade 
them.  I know Panix was doing that last night.

My Verizon DSL service was so slow last night that I couldn't get 
ANYTHING done, not even basic surfing.  That's the first time it has 
been like that since I started with them a year ago.  Don't know if 
that has anything to do with the situation you are noticing...

No, it's for vanity-googling, you enter your own first and last name and
see if you are supreme queen/king of googleland. I ruled the "David Mintz"
universe for a few months but somehow got overthrown by some arriviste.
Still trying to get over it.

Here's hoping!  I'm actually calling them today because they made a few 
mistakes on my most recent bill.  I plan on asking about the "service 
outage" last night.  I'll post if I find out any additional info.

Of note, we both experienced that, I'm in Massachusetts, and you are 
in... NYC?

Some dork botched my order, and last Friday they canceled my existing, 
working DSL and started a new order.  I am STILL using dialup 1 week 
later (ironically Earthlink, as Verizon provides no standby services)...

I wished I could tell you about Verizon DSL here in NYC, but I'm living 
large on analog until those prozac-popping freaks get my 
previously-working circuit back up :(

Nah, I'm not bitter!  Just feel like a farmer that got his tractor 
repossessed.

Oh my, that is quite a sad story.  I personally hope to never hear the 
sound of a dial-up modem again.

My service has been good to date.  My main complaint is they seem to be 
forming a habit of incorrect over-charging.  They have been good about 
crediting when I bring it to their attention.  Definitely pays to 
carefully read the itemized section of the DSL bill!

Hope you get your tractor back real soon.

Send them an invoice for the time you spent resolving their problem. It

I'm on Piolosoft here in NYC (by Hans Z's recommendation)
http://pilosoft.com/
they'll get the ball rolling fairly quickly (probably quicker than 
starting again w/ Verizon (they botched our order as well, seems like 
company policy)) and all they need is the verizon land line to get 
going. Everything is running super-peachy. And their personal customer 
service is light years ahead of a corporate behemoth like Verizon.

I've never had more than a solid week of good DSL service in Staten Island
or Brooklyn.  Regardless of using Covad, Verizon ro Earthlink (all of whom
use Verizon, anyways I think).  Every time I switch to Cable, My days get
brighter and happier with almost NO problems.

 Wait 'til you get a defective modem with them.
 My experience was it took what seemed like an eternity 
 of pleading with the support personnel to 'take my word for it' 
 that the modem's dead. They wanted to exhaustively try falling back 
 to different device drivers. 

 He (the initial support guy) said, "Let's just try one thing first".
 So I patiently followed his step-by-step instructions. 
 Then I realized where we were headed, and that he wanted me to 
 rip out the device driver and put in an older one.

 I told him, "Whoa there partner, all the installing of 
 software in the world's not going to help me -- the 
 modem doesn't make it past the self-test after power-up.
 After wrangling with him for another amount of time, he 
 finally let me talk to his supervisor.

 He (the supervisor) said, "Let's just try one thing first..."

No need.  They had issued their own disconnect order, which the tech 
failed to notice in the account info.  So she asked meaningful, topical 
questions like "is the modem's power supply plugged directly into a wall 
socket, or plugged into a power strip?"

No debugging in the world could get us past a disconnected line, 
however, and she ended up closing the ticket as RESOLVED.  Must have 
been the power strip.

(shakes head)

I have had great success with BritSys (http://britsys.net/), the only
outage occuring when those [a-z]{4}ing Verizon [a-z]{4}heads gratuitously
knocked out my service when I requested a change of carrier on my ~other~
line, where the DSL wasn't. I dialed up for two weeks while my service was
re-ordered and re-installed at my expense. Malice or incompetence? Who
knows. Man I hate those people.

Why even bother with DSL?  Cable is about the same price and is way
faster.  I'm getting well over 2 Mbps on a regular basis.  Plus, it was
installed two days after I called.

In general, I couldn't agree with you more, I'm quite happy with cable 
at home, but needed DSL at the office for a variety of reasons (one 
being that cable isn't available in our building). The point being, if 
you have to use DSL, why torture yourself with Verizon's shenanigans?

I love it when you are actually on the phone with them and they go through
the *SAME EXACT* faq/directories/help files that they have online which you
have gone through 10 times to find the problem and they tell you "hold on i

Agreed.  I'm having flashbacks to my 4 month Bell Atlantic / Verizon DSL
fiasco in the summer of 2000.    And on the last month those incompetent
assclowns went on strike.

The day my DSL was finally turned on, RoadRunner became available in my
apartment complex and representatives were greeting people at the door and
saying they could have a cable connection within 24 hours.

Not really if you consider the price of cable itself today and from what I
understand you can't get:

A) DSL service *without* a phone landline package
B) Cable modem service *without* a cable package

Am I wrong?  If so the cost of a cable modem outweighs DSL by @ least 1/3.
Plus it is *shared* not *dedicated* so alot of people on the same loop can
saturate your bandwidth ...

'Cause I don't have cable.  The only way I can watch my 
beloved-but-woebegone Pittsburgh Steelers is by subscribing to the NFL 
Sunday Ticket(TM), availabled only on DirecTV(TM).

Besides, not using cable keeps me from supporting another company that 
everybody loves to hate.  So I suppose it's a wash.

Oh, and update.  The wifey says that they forgot to actually place the 
new order, so the five-business-days starts again, right now (Friday, 
one week later).  She thinks they might expedite, so we could be back 
online as soon as next Tuesday.  Woo-hoo!  Hang on, gotta disconnect, I 
think someone wants to call me.

Beides, cable doesn't usually want to give you a static ip and they like
to block incoming traffic to ports like 80. DSL services are often -- but
not always! -- the same. BritSys gives me my static IP etc for
$47.70/month and doesn't care if I want to run a server or two. With
dynamic IP you have to do a bunch of hoop-jumping to circumvent their
small-minded policies. It's my machine, it's my connection, don't f**cking
tell me I can't SSH into my box from the outside world if I want to.

This is true.

Nope. At least in OptimumOnline land, you can buy just the cablemodem service.
It's still not cheep.

Common misconception. DSL is dedicated from your CPE to the CO's DSLAM. There,
it's all shared bandwidth out the OC3 (or whatever they are using). Only a
dedicated line, point to point, like a T-1 (non-frame-relay) will give you dedicated
bandwidth. Even then, that's to your provider, who hopefully hasn't oversold *their* 
bandwidth by too much...

I'm paying $42/mo.

Oh, come on.  I'm getting downloads over 300 kilobytes/second on a regular
basis (well over 2 megabits per second).  So, it might slow down every now
and then, but most of the time it's more likely what look like slowdowns
to me are actually web/ftp servers being slow about transmission.  
Therefore, the aggregate speed per day compared to speed per day for DSL
is way faster.  And if you factor in the "speed losses" due to consistent
DSL outages... well, you get the picture.

Of course, knock on wood.  I don't want to jinx my connection. :)

Hmm.. is there anything to the "DSL is dedicated, Cable is shared" 
thing then?  I took a networking class a couple years ago and they made 
a point of covering this in the DSL/Cable comparison.  I've been 
disseminating this little tidbit of info ever since.

 From my experience I haven't noticed big slowdowns in service on DSL.  
Stays pretty consistent all the time.  A friend of mine has cablemodem 
and he notices big slowdowns around 6-8 p.m. when big populations are 
arriving home, checking email, hopping on the web, etc.  On the flip 
side, when it's fast, it's definitely a lot faster than my DSL.

No. It's marketing. Think of the DSLAM as a big mongo network switch
(which it is). If you have a 10Mbps uplink to your office switch,
and 24 ports of 10mbps to each of 24 computers, yes, each of them
has a *dedicated 10 mbps line". Guess what? They all share the
same uplink. Now, most DSL providers ( like Verizon 'can you heaer me 
now? WHAT?') do OC3 or better for the COs, it's still shared.

Cable, on the other hand, will suffer more from local abuse, since the
*local medium* (coax) is shared, so the potential of local abusers
affecting the throughput for others in greater. However, providers
throttle the abusers after a time, so wait it out for 20-30 minutes
until the local clown gets bandwidth-capped at 128k. :)

Right. It all gets down to where the sharing is done, and how it's
provisioned. I have a 384/1500 link from cloud9, and I bet that when I
pull large files for long times, that 1.5mbps affects the home surfers.

Earthlink DSL when I was in a Philly 'burb was bad. They used Genuity
Redbacks (term given me by someone who knows more); Genuity had link
problems somewhat often. My Comcast cable (sans TV, btw) has been solid.

I've also, since moving to Joisey, not found any DSL providers that went
into anyplace I lived. Cable is better than dial-up.  :)

When I had cable (Comcast, Portland OR) there was no contract which was
nice.  The company I work for actually pays for my DSL, so I can VPN to
work (which I rarely do) but in the mean time I run three web sites and
a qmail server on the line.  (thank you Vtech)

Yes, since you can get a cable modem without subscribing to cable TV. I
get almost 3 Mbps down with cable; I doubt standard DSL speeds can come
close to that. It's pretty sweet. :-)

Anyone have a login (log in, log-in) snippet that will protect this one

The idea is that the owner could hit this page, authenticate, and then 
write a file on the site. At the moment he's not able to chose a file

Any help appreciate!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] (ir) regular expressions (stupid me)
Message-ID: <408A70B8.90107@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I am sorry if you get this twice. Like an idiot, I sent this message 
from my other email to the NYPHP list first. The thing is that I am 
subscribed from this email address. That message will probably be 
rejected, so I am sending this again. If it went to Hans for approval, I 
  apologize.

Here is the message I sent:

I have recently had the need to do some specific data validation of 
information entered through a form. I have two questions.

A)
In the first case, I have to make sure that the information entered in a 
text input box looks as follows:
123 Elm St., Brooklyn, NY

I will also accept is as follows:
123 Elm St,Brooklyn,NY

or like this:

123 Elm St , Brooklyn, NY

So what I am saying, is that I need to check for two commas, an alpha 
numeric string before the first comma, a capitalized city name after the 
first comma, and two capital letters after the second comma (for the 
state). I will ignore whitespace before or after the commas. (That 
whitespace can be trimmed programmatically).

I find POSIX style expressions using the ereg() function to be a bit 
easier to learn than their Perl equivalents. Here is what I came up with 
using an ereg() expression:

^([[:alnum:]]+[\.]{0,}[[:space:]]{0,}){1,},([[:space:]]{0,}[[:upper:]][[:alpha:]]+),([[:space:]]{0,}[[:upper:]]{2})$

I am not sure if it will work in all the situations I descirbed above. 
The syntax might also be a bit weird (character classes and things such 
as {0,} ).

B) In the second case, what I want to check for seems to be much 
simpler, but I having no luck.

I want to check the part returned by the first bracket in the previous 
expression (i.e. "123 Elm St.) for the existence of the string "St" but 
not for "St." . In other words, I am looking for an abbreviation of 
Street that does not use a period. I know that you can use a carrot 
inside square brackets ('character classes') as a negation. But this 
does not seem to work with string literals.

For example:
St[^\.]

or

St[^St\.]

produce unreliable results.

Can anyone help me in asking the ereg() function politely that I do not 
want a match if the string contains "St.", but I do want a match if it 
contains "St" ?

Thanks a lot in advance.

Best Regards,

- Jay

Please see PEAR::Auth:

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.authentication.php

This will quickly protect your one page, and can easily scale to cover 
the entire website.  Will support logins stored in a database table, 
flatfile, you name it.

Code comes with examples, and is adequately documented.

Hello all,

for those of you who were kind enough to take a look at my last regular 
expressions related question, I thought might share this link:

http://www.ceruleansky.com/scripts/regexp/

It is simple (quickly / badly written) script that enabled you to 
quickly test whether a (POSIX /ereg() ) regular expression matches a 
snippet of text.

I will add support for Perl-style ones soon, add a whole sampling of 
built-in expressions for testing (including email address validation, 
phone number validation, etc).

I will also clean up the code for the future versions since this was 
quickly thrown together out of the need to learn regexes.

This might be useful to others, so I thought I would share it here.

Best Regards,

- Jay

You could make your life easier by trimming the whitespace before you 
start to validate the address.

Learning preg_* syntax is well worth the trouble because it is an order 
of magnitude more efficient than ereg.

$address = '123 Elm St., Brooklyn, NY';
// remove any whitespace around commas
$address = preg_replace ('/\s*,\s*/',',',$address);
// check address
if (preg_match ('/^([0-9]+ [\w\s]+)[.]?,([A-Z][a-z]+),([A-Z]{2})$/', 
$address, $matches)) {
   $street = $matches[1];
   $city   = $matches[2];
   $state  = $matches[3];
   $address = $street . ', ' . $city . ', ' . $state;
}

That preg expression is similar to the one you were already using in 
intent, and should be extended to deal with city names like 'Salt Lake 
City' etc.

One way would be:

'/^([0-9]+ [\w\s]+)[.]?,([A-Za-z\s]+),([A-Z]{2})$/'

You may in fact want to go with a 3-input solution and grab the street, 
city and state separately, unless you can be guaranteed the user will 
put in the commas.

> B) In the second case, what I want to check for seems to be much 
> simpler, but I having no luck.

You can change the above preg expression by removing the [.]? which will 
disallow the use of the . character in the address, however as you can 
see in the above expression, the . character is outside the brackets for 
the address, so it is discarded if it exists anyway.

Otherwise, you would have to do a negative check for 'St.', ie look for 
St., and if not found then look for St without the full stop.

Hope this helps in some way,

Dan

Hello Leam,

I have used the PEAR authentication class before:

http://pear.php.net/package/Auth

It is useful if you want to build a permissions system on top of it.

If you are looking for basic authentication, you can use .htaccess file 
authentication which most shared hosts have a control panel tool for. 
You can use a .htaccess file to password protect the contents of a whole 
directory.

For storing the data the person has entered, I would use a database such 
as MySQL instead of flat files. This will make any data migration or 
(HTML) display change easy.

Best Regards,

Hi Jayesh:

Pardon me for not answering your direct question, but here's a better
solution.  Completely standardize the data via my Address Standardization
Solution: http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/software/addr/  Use it when
someone inputs data to be saved and when someone types in an address to
look up (also run it once on any data created before you started using 
the solution).

Enjoy,

I agree with Dan. Addresses are weird and non-standard. For instance,
in Washington, DC, this is a typical address:

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC

The city is divided into four quadrants, NW, NE, SW, and SE, so people
append the region to the end of the street address.

And what happens for people who live in:

1000 Broadway, New York, NY

There's no St or St. or (Ave, Ave., etc.) or anything else.

Using three boxes is easier if you can swing it.

Hello Dan (@phpwerx),

thanks a lot for your excellent help! Your suggestions were excellent: I 
had not thought of cities such as "Salt Lake City". Now that you have 
written out the Perl-style regexes, I can understand them.

Thanks for the suggestion about having three different fields:
that is what I am actually moving to in the next version of the admin 
panel. What I currently want to do is validate all the existing rows 
which have data in this "street, city, state" combo. If it validates, 
then I will use the extracted information (from the match array) and 
store it in the new fields.

When I began this project I started with a product I had written before, 
and just piggybacked on existing fields I had. Now with a large data-set 
and sometimes fickle people entering data, I need a better solution.

Your expressions will help me a lot in this upgrade process. Thanks again!

- Jay

You may want to check out this nice little program for learning 
Perl-compatible regex

"The Regex Coach is a graphical application for Linux and 
Windows which can be used to experiment with (Perl-compatible) 
regular expressions interactively. It has the following features..."

Hello Jon,

Thanks for the link. I actually stumbled across it earlier today (before 
I saw your email on the NYPHP site) while I was searching through the 
NYPHP Talk archives.

I downloaded and tried out the RegEx tutor and it is really nice. The 
funny thing is that PHPEdit's regular expression helper looks a lot 
similar, except it has less functionality. But the error messages 
produced by both programs are nearly the same or identical.

  Another funny thing is that I could not PHPEdit's regex helper to 
work. It does not like "/" as a delimiter and even misbehaves if I use 
"#" as the delimiter.

So all in all, I am happy with RegEx tutor.

I will, however, continue to develop my own "RegEx Helper" to have some 
built in regexes that people can select and try out. Eventually, (if 
people other than I use it), I would like to store people's trial 
history and ask them if they want to submit their successful experiment 
back to the site.

Mine won't have the fancy highlighting that RegEx tutor has, but it will 
offer some other built-in selection of expressions and community based 
review and feedback.

Now, I just hope I have time to do all this ;-)

Best Regards,

- Jay

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP, IMAP, c-client
Message-ID: <1082951896.5551.24.camel@devel2.x32.com.au>

Hi all,

I posted this message to the fedora-list at redhat.com. Someone there
pointed me here and said you guys know a thing or 2 :)


I believe im having problems similar to this:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60984

I have a Cyrus IMAP server, with GSSAPI authentication enabled. I have a
PHP app which connects to Cyrus and performs administrative tasks.

My PHP code is calling imap_open, but this is failing as the c-client
seems to be trying GSSAPI authentication, then giving up, due to
credential cache errors.

In the above url, the resolution was to remove the cyrus-sasl-gssapi
package. However, this of course breaks any applications which utilise
GSSAPI! I can live with this, but i hate having to re-enter passwords :)

My question is this: How can i force c-client to NOT use gssapi for this
application? I considered rebuilding the imap-devel or libc-client-devel
packages, but this would affect other applications like pine which *do*
utilise gssapi for imap. 1 thought i had was to build a custom c-client
(Without kerberos or gssapi) and statically link that into php.

So if anyone has any idea,, or other suggestions, i would love to hear
them.

Cheers,

Dan

See: http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/php/2001-11/0011.html

(Search for GSSAPI)

You would have to ask a c-client expert about this. Try:

http://www.washington.edu/imap/c-client-list.html

However, I would probably just what you suggest: build a custom
c-client and be done with it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Can't get no $action
Message-ID: <408D05B7.1010407@reuel.net>

Sorry for the lousy joke, this one's been beating me up for days.

I'm using the editor.php script from "Beginning PHP4" (Wrox press) and 
it uses a call to $PHP_SELF to refresh the page on submit. ($PHP_SELF is 
set from $_SERVER[PHP_SELF]) At the end there is a switch statement that 
is supposed to save the file if the action "save_file" is set, otherwise 
just do the regular edit page.

I could not get their script to work so I'm breaking it down to smaller, 
more digestible parts. What I'm currently stuck on is getting the call 
to save the form if the submit button is clicked.

 From the editor_form function:

	echo "<form name=edit_form method=post action=$PHP_SELF >";
	echo "<input type=hidden name=action value=save_file >";
	echo "<input type=submit value='Save and Exit' name=submit>";

 From the switch statement:

	switch($action) {
		case "save_file":
			save_file();	
			break;
		default:
			html_header();	
			editor_form();
			html_footer();
	}

The save_file function works if it's called by itself, and the $action 
just seems to call the default.

Any suggestions? Is this even the right area of code to look at? FWIW 
I'm certainly able to make basic html errors, so it may not even be PHP 
related.

ciao!

It won't be causing the problem, but your html should be properly quoted.

I would suggest that your server might have register_globals turned off, 
meaning you will need to use $_POST['action'] instead of $action.  You 
should do this anyway, rather than relying on register_globals.

Do you mean like:
	echo "<input type=\"hidden\">";

or can I use single quotes? Yeah, I'm still on the square part of the 
learnin' curve...

Virtual Drink to you, that was it! Went to switch($_POST[action]) and it 
worked.

The book recommends register_globals be on but I've understood that is 
not the best solution. However, I still get mixed up in their code 
becasue they're using it that way.

Thanks!

Read here about register_globals and other neat stuff

http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/PH_ini.php?expiredate=2/16/2004

I think the consensus around here is that the book is _wrong_.

there are a few authors on here, and they seem to know their stuff (I
don't have their books, sorry guys), perhaps they can speak up and
recommend theirs for you.

I'm fairly new to php and any html greater than the bold, paragraph, and

my head. The consensus does seem to be the way to go and I'm making my 
code fit.

Derek;

I'm newbie enough to not really understand the context. Are you saying 
that I shouldn't use any single quotes for quoting purposes? How will 
that affect existing code written with them? What is the implemenatation 
scheme for the new standard?

ciao!

Could you link to that, please? XHTML 1.0 was specific about allowing

Some of these books have great ideas but make life quite confusing for 
the newcomer. Some books use $HTTP_POST_VARS and others use $_POST in 
their code. (See note 1 at 
http://phundamentals.nyphp.org/PH_bookrecommendations.php). It depends 
when they were written. And, as you found out, some assume 
register_globals has been turned on.

No, you can use single quotes.  You can't use single quotes, however, if 
you want your resulting HTML to result to the rather narcissistic W3C 
standards, which, IMHO, mean 0.00% of anything.

You are right about the single quotes, they can be used as well.

I just did a test and it does in fact validate against the W3C
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.derekdevries.com%2Fdoctype.html&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=%28detect+automatically%29&ss=1&outline=1&sp=1&noatt=1&No200=1&verbose=1

I based my last statement by something I saw on this page...
http://academ.hvcc.edu/~kantopet/xhtml/index.php?page=xhtml+attributes
but W3C wins.

I would love to put a group of W3C designers in the same room with PHP 
web application developers and call it "E-Survivor".  Dangit, where's 
Mark Burnett when I need him? I could make a FORTUNE!

FWIW, "PHP Cookbook" assumes register_globals is Off and always
superglobals like $_POST over the $HTTP_POST_VARS equivalent.

However, it is not a book I necessarily recommend to someone just
learning PHP. It's a book you should when you've been programming in
PHP for six months or more. (Unless you've been a programmer in a
previous life; then you should buy "PHP Cookbook" right away.) :)

The other thing that causes unnecessary hiccups to newcomers is 
the mixed use of "echo" and "print".  It may be a small matter 
to experienced folks, but my rule of thumb on this would be "use 
echo in all cases -- use print only if the code calls for it".

Without getting into the "echo-is-slightly-faster-than-print" 
discussion, the word "echo" makes more sense to me in terms of 
"echoing to a screen/display/browser".

I am indifferent to the "echo" vs "print" dilemma. I used to use echo,
now I use print. The important part (to me) is that you pick one and
don't swap back and forth mid-function.

I think I decided I liked print better because there's no echof() or
sechof() functions. :) It seemed more consistent to use all C-style
function names instead of mixing between shell and C.

But like I said, I don't really care too much. There are actually a
few cases where echo gives you functionality that print doesn't, but
they're real edge cases, so I wouldn't code with them in mind.

One convenience of echo (over print) in PHP is that you can use commas and
echo as many things as you like -- like the Perl's print. Feel free to
feel confused if you like.

echo "Huh?", $object->method(), "... whatever.";

Can someone help me figure out what I'm missing?

I have followed the docs here:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.curl.php
And here:
http://curl.haxx.se/mail/curlphp-2002-10/0017.html

To no avail...

When I restart Apache I get the error:
Unknown(): unable to load dynamic library
'C:\php-4.3.6-Win32\extensions\php_curl.dll' - The specified module could
not be found.

I don't have any problems with the exif extension...

Seems pretty straightforward, but it isn't behaving as advertised...

What happens if you do dir of C:\php-4.3.6-Win32\extensions

what's the advantage of that over

print "Huh?".$object->method()."... whatever.";

I think consistency of use throughout a given program or set of 
scripts is what's important here -- as Adam intimated in an 
earlier post.

The case study I use to teach [mostly] newbies uses echo 
statements.  So, I use echo statements consistently.

Well, Mambo Open Source (www.mamboserver.com) just won the reader 
nominated award of 'Best Linux or Open Source Software' at LinuxUser in 
the UK this year.  Super lightweight, simple install, easy to use.  I 
think it is a swell CMS.  Then again, I'm a core developer ;^)

You can also take others for a spin at:

	http://www.opensourcecms.com/

Other interesting PHP-based CMS are Drupal, Xaraya and the 'Nukes 
(PHP-Nuke, Postnuke, etc.).

An intriguing non-php CMS is Plone (www.plone.org), based on python and 
the Zope application server.

HTH,

I don't think CRM == CMS. CRM is customer relationship mgmt. CMS is
content mgmt system. You may be able to manage customers like content,
but I'm not 100% positive that's the best idea. :)

I put those in /WINDOWS/System32...

DOH!!

I found it! Libeay32.dll wasn't in the system32 folder (I swear I copied it
there!). I copied it to system32, restarted Apache and it works.

Thanks for (patiently) helping me troubleshoot!

All the more reason to add the PHP and PHP\dll directories to %path%
rather than moving files to system32.  It's simple and easy to maintain.  
Why the installation instructions suggest moving the files is beyond me.

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Also note that you have to call Accepter "statically"

            you will be instantiating $this->validate(), causing a n^2 
loop construct of an unnecessary validation call, which is
            way bad!  However, the property cannot be called directly in 
PHP versions 4 due to language constraints (if someone knows how
            let *ME* know!) so you have to use a static getter method to 
retrieve it
          
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
          print_r(is_array(${$elementName})); print_r(" "); 
print_r(@sizeof(array_values(${$elementName}))); print_r(' '); 
print_r(${$elementName}); print_r(" "); echo 
Accepter::getNullExemptionArray($section, $elementName); print_r("<P>");
          if (is_array(${$elementName}) && 
@sizeof(array_values(${$elementName})) > 0) {
           return true;
          } elseif (${$elementName} && ${$elementName} !== 
Accepter::getNullExemptionArray($section, $elementName)) {
           return true;
          } else {
           return false;
          }
          break;
       
          default: // DO NOTHING FOR NOW
          break;
        }
    }

}
[/PHP]

The following method in the class function:

[PHP]
print_r(is_array(${$elementName})); print_r(" "); 
print_r(@sizeof(array_values(${$elementName}))); print_r(' '); 
print_r(${$elementName}); print_r(" "); echo 
Accepter::getNullExemptionArray($section, $elementName); print_r("<P>");
[/PHP]

Produces this error:

[Quote]
Fatal error: Call to undefined function: getnullexemptionarray() in 
/www/html/mu-spin/image_catalog/include/search_action.inc.php on line 267
[/Quote]

However, if I comment out line 267 and you follow *THIS* line:

[PHP]
      } elseif (${$elementName} && ${$elementName} !== 
Accepter::getNullExemptionArray($section, $elementName)) {
           return true;
[/PHP]

Then the class method works w/o a single fatal error whatsoever, and I 
even verified with the following:

[PHP]print_r("elementName = $elementName = ${$elementName}<P>");[/PHP]

To verify if ${$elementName} exists thus possibly meeting (or not 
meeting) the conditon. 

So now, why is it that on one line, Accepter::getNullExemptionArray() 
produces an "undefined function" fatal error, but in another line, same 
class, same method, it produces no errors at all???

What am I missing this time?

And so it is:




For Hottest IPO in Years, Google
Taps CSFB and Morgan Stanley=20

By ROBIN SIDEL and KEVIN J. DELANEY=20
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL=20


Internet-search pioneer Google Inc. has tapped Credit Suisse First
Boston and Morgan Stanley to lead an eagerly anticipated initial public
offering that likely will be announced this week, according to people
familiar with the situation.

Google's selection of the two big securities firms ends months of
intense speculation over who on Wall Street would snag an assignment
that is expected to generate investment-banking fees of nearly $100
million and huge bragging rights. An IPO of Google likely will be one of
the biggest U.S. public offerings ever and, if successful, could trigger
a new wave of IPO filings among other technology companies.

The deal has all of the hoopla of the biggest IPOs of the 1990s, when
Netscape Communications sold shares publicly and helped set off a frenzy
that sent the stock market soaring. As in some 1990s deals, this public
offering stands to make some computer-science whiz kids wealthy beyond
their wildest dreams, while also benefiting a cast of well-known venture
capitalists. With nearly insatiable investor interest, it could put a
price tag of $25 billion on a company that didn't exist a decade ago,
making it more valuable than retailer Sears, Roebuck & Co. and hotel
operator Marriott International Inc.

Some things, however, are different now. Google is turning a profit,
according to executives at the company, unlike so many of the profitless
wonders of the bubble era. And its IPO will test many of the reforms put
in place by regulators in the wake of the bubble's burst. Those reforms
are intended to wipe out abuses that allowed favored Wall Street
investment-banking and trading clients, and Wall Street itself, to
benefit at the expense of many other investors.

The enthusiasm for a Google IPO also demonstrates the importance the
search function has assumed in how people use the Internet, helping
shape the sites they view, the news they read and the products they buy.
There is a revenue stream to match: Advertisers increasingly use search
sites as a way to buy more targeted advertising, since the sites can
match up ads with what people are looking for. Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo
Inc. are among the players that have concluded that search is of such
strategic importance that they have poured money into their own search
offerings recently.

For CSFB, the contract is a major coup. Just a few years ago, the firm
was at the center of an IPO scandal, and its former star technology
banker, Frank Quattrone, is now being retried on obstruction-of-justice
charges related to an investigation into alleged IPO abuses. CSFB, which
is the securities unit of Zurich's Credit Suisse Group, paid $100
million two years ago to settle civil regulatory charges, without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, that it provided shares of hot IPOs to
investment firms in exchange for excessive commissions.

Still, CSFB has retained a prominent role in technology-investment
banking, nabbing the top spot for underwriting technology IPOs in the
first quarter of 2004. It also has hustled to plug holes in its
technology-sector investment-banking business after a nine-member group
defected to Deutsche Bank AG earlier this year. Earlier this month, CSFB
added eight new bankers, including some who previously hailed from major
rivals. One big factor in CSFB's favor: Last year, Google hired the
firm's Internet stock analyst, Lise Buyer, as "director of business
optimization."

Morgan Stanley was expected to win a top spot in a Google IPO. The Wall
Street firm long has been prominent in technology-investment banking,
and it employs one of the nation's best-known and most-influential
Internet analysts: Mary Meeker, a prolific booster of Silicon Valley
during the Internet boom who now co-heads the firm's tech-sector
research. Terms of a historic regulatory settlement, reached a year ago
this week to resolve allegations that 10 of Wall Street's biggest
securities firms hyped stocks to ingratiate themselves with
investment-banking clients, barred research analysts from attending any
meetings in which investment bankers were pitching the IPO to Google.

People familiar with the situation say Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. -- both of which had been in the running for the top spot --
are expected to still play a large role. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., among others also will be involved, these
people say.

A spokeswoman for Google, Mountain View, Calif., declined to comment.
Representatives of CSFB, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Goldman, J.P. Morgan
and Lehman declined to comment. Other banks couldn't be reached for
comment.

Investment bankers believe an IPO would value Google at as much as $25
billion. Last fall, some of Google's prospective advisers estimated the
company's valuation could be in line with Internet powerhouses Yahoo
Inc., valued at $38 billion, Amazon.com Inc. at $20 billion and eBay
Inc. at $54 billion.

Founded by two Stanford University graduate students in 1998, Google
became popular for delivering fast, relevant Web-search results. It
turns a profit by selling advertising on its pages and those of other
Web sites and by licensing its search technology to other companies.
While potential investors and fans of the company have been eager to
learn about a Google IPO, so have the company's prospective
underwriters. Google contacted more than a dozen investment banks last
fall and then trimmed the list to about a half dozen. The banks received
little word from Google for the next several months until the company
began contacting them about a month ago, people familiar with the matter
say.

Many aspects of the IPO, including its size and price, are closely
guarded secrets, and elements are believed to still be under discussion,
the people familiar with the matter say. It isn't clear how much detail
Google would release this week. Even the list of second-tier banks may
still be tentative, some people caution.

Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are believed to own about
a third of the company, if not more. Other investors include venture
firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital, which
together led an investment totaling $25 million in 1999. Yahoo and Time
Warner Inc.'s America Online unit also have stakes in Google, or
warrants to acquire shares, obtained through partnerships with the firm.

While many investors were burned by high-flying technology IPOs that
crashed, Google is expected to have a successful offering in part
because the company is far more established than so many other Internet
companies that went public. Google's brand name is expected to go a long
way in attracting professional investors and small individuals alike.
But any effort by Google to include an unusual component, such as an
online sale of shares to individual investors, which management has
pushed for, could create some bumps.

Google, for its part, is intent on crafting an IPO so that individual
investors, not just big institutional investors, could buy shares, the
people say. Under the online option being discussed, individuals would
place orders directly, instead of through a broker. Many investment
bankers have been leery of that unconventional approach. People familiar
with the situation say one of the factors that may have relegated
Goldman to a secondary role was the bank's reservations about this
online component.

Google is widely expected to be quite thrifty in doling out banking
fees. People familiar with the matter say that Google executives don't
hold the investment-banking community in high regard and will be loath
to hand over big fees for the IPO work. And the bankers, eager to get a
piece of such a highly prized deal, aren't expected to drive a hard
bargain.

Google couldn't be filing for an IPO at a more opportune time: The
company is the No. 1 Web-site destination for Internet searches. It has
expanded its offerings in recent months, with sites devoted to news and
shopping. Most recently, it began testing a free e-mail service.

The extremely secretive Google is being nudged into a public offering by
federal regulations that require certain closely held companies to
publicly disclose more information about their businesses once they hit
a certain size. Those rules often trigger companies to file IPOs.

The Securities and Exchange Commission rule applies to companies with
more than 500 shareholders and $10 million in assets. Google meets the
requirement, because most of its more than 1,000 employees hold stock
options. The rule requires companies to file disclosures about their
finances within 120 days after the end of their fiscal year. For Google,
the requirement will be triggered this week.

I'm currently starting one to work as a CMS also - basically managing the
project / the client / and the website all in one package (of course it will
be fully AMP / APP compliant - ergo ADODB will be used). my goals are simple
encompass everything from "concept to execution" (my biz tagline) including
some sales tools and useful submods along with it. I'm also planning on
supporting it as a module of postnuke.

if you'd like to contribute to the planning of this module/software
please visit http://noc.postnuke.com/projects/pnbcp/

Hey all,
Figured I would ask on this list as there are some bright chaps that
post in here.
I did some research with bloom filters and worked up a sort-of-similar,
but non-binary, system in PHP.
See http://peoplesdns.com/filter/ for explaination and code.
I am looking for feedback before this ends up all over.
A co-opensource-worker posted to his blog (
http://dannyayers.com/archives/002541.html ) but in general it is still
at the request for comments/suggestions/rants stage.

Basically, anyone know of any reasons this might break? That it might be
an issue under certain circumstances, ways to make it better, problems
with the incremental approach etc.. I would especially be interested in
mathematical references that link to similar items that I may have
overlooked.

Anyway, built for handling "LARGE" datasets, not small (i.e. < 500k)

Thanks

This looks really interesting.

At first glance, your approach seems to use a lot more memory than the
original. The first version stores everything in a single integer (or
double), but you're using a giant array of strings.

Also, bitwise checks should be much faster than all the string/array
exploding and imploding your method requires.

Have you benchmarked your code against the original algorithm to see
which is faster?

However, like I said, I only skimmed over the code, so I could be
completely off base, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

Bloom filters use a long binary string, an integer could not be used
with a bloom filter method.

I agree with you fully and will look at optimization for this code. I
have not used bitwise a lot and mostly only for network code. You
wouldn't happen to have a url with any examples of using bitwise shifts
with letter/combinations?

> Have you benchmarked your code against the original algorithm to see

Bloom filters will be faster on generation, should be about the same on
lookup.

No, thanks a lot, exactly what I was looking for. I need to know where
this can be better.

Thanks :)

Why don't you use GMP?

http://www.php/net/gmp

It requires an external library, but it'll be much faster than an
all-PHP solution for very large numbers.

There's also the BC math library, which is bundled with PHP, but you
need to emulate bitwise operations in userland code, which doesn't
seem too efficient.

One of my original ideas for this used BC and multiplied primes (four
digit up to six digit primes, a few thousand of them total) once for
each insertion. Obviously the number got large, but the solution worked
when using modulus because the end result would always mod to zero if
the prime was used in a bcmul() at any point on that number (primes used
to not have false positives). I chose to throw away that implementation
due to the filter size required to handle numbers that are over a
thousand digits for each portion of the filter. I also found the limits
for function base_convert() for base36
(http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.base-convert.php)

I may use that type of filter at a later date for something else, but I
chose the alpha system for simplicity and smaller filters.

How "good" the way is will depend a lot on what kind of operations you 
need to do with the data. The MySQL DATETIME and DATE types go from 
1/1/1000 CE to 12/31/9999 CE, so depending on how far back you want to 
go, you could store things as a DATETIME with a year offset, so if 
you've got "5/12/500 (BCE)", you store that as 5/12/2500, adding or 
subtracting 3000 years as you put it into or take it out of the database.

However, any comparative date math will be error-prone, since calendars 
changed so much over time in different places. "May 12" doesn't really 
have much meaning in 500 BCE anywhere in the world.

You could also use a BIGINT UNSIGNED column and store timestamps as 
TAI64 labels (see http://cr.yp.to/proto/utctai.html and 
http://cr.yp.to/libtai.html and http://cr.yp.to/libtai/tai64.html). This 
gets you a culturally-unbiased measurement scale (or, to be more 
accurate, a measurement scale that is more-or-less equally biased 
towards each of humanity's many time measurement plans) but you will 
still have to do a lot of conversion between TAI64 labels and whatever 
human-readable format is appropriate for your app.

thanks, that helps a lot David... I began thinking about things 
like dates before Gregorian 1582, etc and thought I'd ask.

I have a client who would like to store product development information
within a MySQL table.  The table will consist of multiple fields, each
representing a product attribute (height, weight, color, etc.).  The client
would like to store each iteration (or version) of the product development
information along with the ability to role back to prior versions if
necessary.  

I'd like to ensure that I'm not reinventing the wheel on this.  Anyone have
any experience with such an effort?  Is this kind of information stored in
the MySQL logs?  Any light shedding would be appreciated.

My first idea would be to create a unique identifier for each product
and store all the product specifications alongside the identifier and
a version number. When you select the specifications for a product,
select the one with the highest version number. Rolling back only
requires you to delete the highest version number from the database.

The easiest version number is either an auto_increment field or maybe
a timestamp of the insert time.

Also, if you were super concerned about select speed, you could make
an additional column that's an enum('current', 'old') and make the
latest version as "current" and the others as "old". Of course, this
requires more convoluted insert / update logic. But this may or may
not be necessary.

Thanks for your quick response Adam.  Only concern might be the size of the
database as go forward.  Each record might contain 100+ fields, not all of
which would change during each iteration.  I therefore, might be saving
redundant information (e.g. only two or three fields might change over the
different versions).

I was thinking of creating a "before" and "after" array, and then storing
the serialized difference in another field.  This will obviously require a
bit more logic to reconstruct prior versions, but in exchange would minimize
storage requirements.

Anyone see any flaws in my logic?

Disk drives are cheaper than development time and less prone to
bugs. :)

Seriously, hard drives are super cheap and text is small. There's no
reason to waste time or money on this problem unless the size becomes
so large you're running out of space. By then, the cheapest solution
will probably be to buy a larger drive.

Sometimes the best solution to a problem is better hardware, not
better software.

why not make a table then with 4 fields 1 being an id of course, one being

Actually that's not quite a valid reason.  I had a contract job once 
where I built PHP pages on a secured IIS platform for an intranet web 
portal.  IIS doesn't always associate with ASP.

I have definitely found the mp3's of the meetings to be quite useful...

Hi all, anyone knows an up-to-date site where I can gather some
reasoning for a client that wants to use ASP. I am trying to make the
case that PHP is better. But all I find is from 2002 and older.

Something in the line of http://php.weblogs.com/php_vs_asp would be
great.

Thanks,

I kind of agree with Yury. As I keep hearing this from different places.

But I don't understand the IIS ASP association.

my naivety shows... true, but how rare is it to have php on IIS? and do you
have to jump thru a million loopholes to get it to work correctly..

peoples.. this is coming from a PHP hack.. not a hacker :)

We have an existing form in PDF that is typically printed and used.
However, now they want some of the information to - of course - be
automatically be filled out from our database, and then downloadable and
printable.

Although only a single page, the form is quite nasty.  Although, I must
say, graphics/colors/etc aren't a concern.  I'm looking for ways to fill
in the information via PHP with the least amount of vector graphics
calculations, Postscript, or whatever else (this is mostly uncharted
territory for me).


Some thoughts

-- since the form is already in PDF, can I convert it to HTML.  Then,
using HTML as the template, fill in the information and convert back to
PDF?  I can't just stick to HTML because I'm concerned about printing
issues.

-- are there good (commercial is fine) libraries that let me do this?
While something native in PHP would be nice (I've seen PDFLib.com) I'd
have no problem using an external command and piping information around.

-- does Adobe, or anyone else, offer programmatic ways to use existing
PDFs as templates?

-- are there other/better ways to do this that I'm missing?

Money is less of a concern than time.

Thanks,

H

P.S:  Next step; sending print jobs to HP printers from Apache/PHP

Awesome Mike, thanks!

A few weeks ago I drove to visit some relatives a couple hours away.  
It totally rocked to be *productive* listening to some NYPHP meetings 
on the way over and back.

Hope to come down to a meeting sometime soon,

using HTML as the template, fill in the information and convert back to
PDF?  I can't just stick to HTML because I'm concerned about printing
issues.

-- are there good (commercial is fine) libraries that let me do this?
While something native in PHP would be nice (I've seen PDFLib.com) I'd
have no problem using an external command and piping information around.

-- does Adobe, or anyone else, offer programmatic ways to use existing
PDFs as templates?

-- are there other/better ways to do this that I'm missing?

Money is less of a concern than time.

Thanks,

H

P.S:  Next step; sending print jobs to HP printers from Apache/PHP

It's not that difficult to switch the settings in IIS to allow for the 
evaluation of PHP alongside ASP.. but consider the platform and ask 
yourself, WHY???

I haven't looked into it too much, but this sourceforge project looks
promising. It doesn't use any external libraries, which is nice, especially
since pdflib charges for commercial licenses.

I use lpr.CUPS for this with a Kyocera Mita printer via system()

took me a while to work out a lot of kinks, and to realize that CUPS was
the way to go... ask again when you get to that step if you still need
help. :)

This article talks about creating a form that submits to an asp page,
but the asp part doesn't seem to do anything fancy beyond returning a 
special ContentType header.

The approach here is to program the acrobat document and have it
communicate with  a server-- all the interaction happens with the pdf.
You might have to add some additional buttons onto your original
document (so the user can fetch whatever data they need) but I think you
can flag them as being unprintable.

The only way I have found to do this is with java.  Look at
http://www.lowagie.com/iText/

There is some talk of porting iText to php but as far as I can tell not
done yet.

For generating PDFs I recomend fpdf.org 

But If you need to use an existing pdf as a template iText is the way to
go,

Hope that helps,

Willie

Don't know if this is what you're looking for.  I use htmldoc-1.8.23 to
convert HTML pages to PDF.  Works great.  Find it at

We have an existing form in PDF that is typically printed and used.
However, now they want some of the information to - of course - be
automatically be filled out from our database, and then downloadable and
printable.

Although only a single page, the form is quite nasty.  Although, I must
say, graphics/colors/etc aren't a concern.  I'm looking for ways to fill
in the information via PHP with the least amount of vector graphics
calculations, Postscript, or whatever else (this is mostly uncharted

I think ezpdf can do things like that. It's over a year since I
looked at it, but, if my failing memory is actually right, you can
use a base image or pdf to start.

This is what I use most of the time ... what I would do is position all the
graphics in the form of a template (borders, logos, etc) and use it as an
overlay to your dynamic content.

This package uses simple functions like AddPage(), Cell(), Line(), Image()
which helps precalculate X,Y's for the lazy :-)

I have been using HTMLDoc for over a year generating dynamic PDF's on 
the fly. All it requires is a proper HTML 3.2 document and out comes a 
PDF. It integrates well with PHP and I find a huge time saver from 
designing with one of the PDF libraries, but that is me.

I use http://www.ros.co.nz/pdf for the creation of all my invoices, I do 
create everything from scratch though, with borders and graphics. The 
optimal soloution would be to open an existing pdf and just add 
text/images to various places.

I know Adobe have some server software which is awesome at creating pdfs 
  for printing and other stuff, but it costs a lot of dough 
unfortunately and requires extra servers to.

Again I love fpdf.  easy-pdf looks good too but it will not add data to
an existing form here is a forum thread.
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=1908901

I went through this a few months ago.

iText will do it. You create a FDF file with Acrobat and iText will fill
in the fields

I think ezpdf can do things like that. It's over a year since I
looked at it, but, if my failing memory is actually right, you can
use a base image or pdf to start.

Not as rare as it should be.

In fact, it's apparently common enough that Zend now offers WinEnabler:

http://www.zend.com/store/products/zend-win-enabler.php

In the past, PHP on Windows hasn't been terribly great, due largely in
part to the fact that the focus has always been on Unix platforms, since
that is what most server environments run. I think Zend is seeking to make
PHP a more viable option for Windows shops, although I agree with the
voiced concern over IIS. Even the Gartner Group advises against running
IIS in mission-critical environments.

Guessing a statistic, I bet more than 95% of applications written in ASP
run on IIS. That is the association.

On the other hand, I bet less than 5% of applications running on Apache
are written in ASP.

Apache/ASP and IIS/PHP are possible, but these are rare combinations.

I personally know of a number of production relatively high volume 
sites using IIS and PHP.  For the most part PHP doesn't care what the 
httpd is.

As for the original question, I don't know of any sites that do a ASP 
(which version?) vs. PHP (which version?)

As for the implied question, Is PHP better than ASP?  Depends on how 
you define 'better'.
1.  With ASP you'll usually end up using MS SQL.  With PHP you'll 
usually end up using MySQL or PostgreSQL.  MS SQL is expensive to 
purchase and does require active administration
2.  With ASP you'll usually be using the native objects/classes 
provided by Microsoft.  With PHP well, I don't know if there is a 
usual.  You could use PEAR or any other thing you wanted.  Using the 
Microsoft classes is a significantly steeper learning curve.
3.  With ASP there are well publicized exploits that a hacker can and 
will attempt to use.  With PHP there are still exploits but they're not 
as well publicized and there's almost no way a hacker can guess which 
set of exploits to use before looking at the site.
4.  Internationally I am willing to bet there are more PHP developers 
than ASP developers.  Domestically I am willing to bet there are more 
ASP developers than PHP developers.
5.  In ASP, if an ASP class doesn't behave the way you want, it's 
difficult to dig into it to find out what it's doing, and is a task for 
only strong developers.  In PHP, if a class doesn't behave the way you 
want, then you change it.
6.  Well written ASP vs well written PHP is almost a wash.  The PHP 
code will typically run a bit faster on comparable hardware.  This 
might be a function of the httpd instead of the language.
7.  Well written ASP is as easy to maintain as well written PHP.
8.  It's somewhat easier to create poorly written ASP than poorly 
written PHP.  But not by much.
9.  If you're building a web app, and you're not using FrontPage, PHP 
is a great choice.  If you're building a web app, and you're using 
Frontpage, then ASP is the best choice.
10.  If you're writing code to integrate with MS Office, then ASP is 
the language to use.
11.  If you want to leverage the efforts of 10,000's of developers 
worldwide, and you don't want to be tied to the seemingly random and 
capricious actions of a large corporation, then PHP is the language to 
use.
12.  If you are willing to build your application the way Microsoft 
thinks you should want to build your application, then use ASP.  If you 
want to build the application your way (or the clients way), then use 
PHP.

I started in the VB/ASP world.  I used to work at Microsoft (as a 
contractor) where I wrote ASP code, among other duties.

I personally think PHP is a much better solution to most problems.  The 
thing that sold me on PHP is #12 above.  I've built over 250 web 
sites/applications.  I'd be willing to bet that less than 20 are built 
the way Microsoft thinks I should want to build the application.  This 
is a really big deal.  To me this is by far the most important part of 
the conversation.  I need to have a language/framework that lets me 
build the application the way I want to build it.

There are limitations in both languages.  There are workarounds in both 
languages.  If the boss thinks that ASP is a better language based on 
some marketing-esque stuff that s/he has read somewhere then the boss 
is probably 'wrong'.  But the 'rightness' or 'wrongness' of either 
language depends on your undefined 'better'.

This is quite interesting, although I haven't been able to get it to
work with a PHP script.  The PHP script outputs exactly what the ASP
script does, however I always get this error from Acrobat when trying to
use the form in IE:

"The file you are attempting to open contains comments or form data that
are supposed to be placed on .  This document cannot be found."

The interesting thing is the empty "." period in the error message;
somehow when I'm sending the data back from PHP it's not knowing to use
the currently open PDF form.  Maybe something wrong with the form
itself?

Any help on this would be appreciated.

Great seeing everyone last night,

with their support team, I found out that in order for php to be 
executed the file extension needs to be .php, .xml, or .shtml.  I am 
used to a server environment where I can have pages ending with .html 
and the php code is still executed just fine.

So, my question is, is this fairly normal to be constrained to those 
file types in order to have php be executed?  It seems inconvenient and 
unnecessary, IMO, but I don't have enough experience with different 
server environments to feel qualified to make this judgment.

Overall, I feel like my client could be getting the same services they 
are paying for now for a much cheaper price from alternative hosts.

Any feedback is quite welcome.

TIA,

-Aaron

Hi,

can you force HTML to parse php with htaccess?

Also, On the 2 -3 servers i'm working on, php extensions are the only ones
that parse php code.
regards
yury

Test an .htaccess file with the following:

AddType application/x-httpd-php .htm .html

Depending upon the server configuration, it may allow you to parse .htm and 
.html files as .php

Technically you can tell apache to parse html as PHP code, but it is 
discouraged as a default.  One reason is performance, as even static 
html will now be parsed by the php handler.

You can change this in either httpd.conf or with .htaccess files, 
although I also consider .htaccess files a bad idea for performance reasons.

I certainly don't want to make a change that will hurt performance as 
this is more of an personal aesthetic issue more than anything else.  
If performance is better given the scenario mentioned, I shall shift my 
current aesthetic preferences.  =)

Isn't it considered wasteful to have the server parse .html pages?
Using the .php extension tells the server to only bother parsing those
pages that need it.
Use the .html extension for those pages that truly are static.
Although, I have to admit, I rarely create any page these days that is not
parsed. If that is the case for you, then I suppose that parsing .html
would be net-net the same thing.

If you have one of Verio's VPS setups, you can find your httpd.conf file
and edit it yourself, too.
Use iManager to submit an Apache restart request.
php_info() will tell you where the httpd.conf file is...
/usr/etc/local/httpd.conf
but remember that that location starts from your account's root dir.. so
it's really
~/usr/etc/local/httpd.conf

While it is technically slower to have .htaccess parse all HTML pages
as PHP, I don't believe it should factor into your considerations:

1) If you're on a shared server .htaccess is either already enabled or
   disabled. If it's enabled, you're already taking the performance
   hit regardless whether you map .html to PHP. So, it's essentially a
   "sunk cost."

2) When PHP doesn't find any <?php tags, it just spits out the page
   unmodified. This is a very small performance hit because there's no
   complex logic.

3) People are used to seeing pages in .html and your site should
   prevent leaking internal middleware choices to the user in the form
   of file extensions.

There is a mentality in the software developer community that anything
that impacts performance (or takes up lots of disk space, etc.) is
automatically something to be avoided. We've come a long way from the
1960s: processors are more powerful, hard drives are much larger, RAM
is plentiful. And it's all cheaper than ever.

We've long since passed the inflection point where hardware resources
are more expensive than business objectives and developer costs, yet
we still persist in undervaluing those two assets. Just because
hardware has a tangible price doesn't mean that it's the only part of
the process with a cost.

Finally, I can't believe that anyone whose site is running on a shared
server could ever generate enough traffic that they'd need to worry
whether binding PHP to all .html pages in an .htaccess file would
cause a noticeable slowdown. Check and see.

Okay. Rant over. Thanks for your patience. :)

This will probably be the case for me with this site, as it is most 
likely that the nav buttons will be php driven.  At the very minimum, 
there will be that little piece of php code to execute on every page.

Yay, a little economics lingo makes it's way into a php discussion.  I

Re. # 3, this was part of my thinking behind it.  People are 
comfortable with seeing .html and there's definitely something to be 
said for that.  Also, I'd rather not broadcast my coding 
environment/scripting language by using .php extensions.  Doesn't seem 
logical to give any user, much less a potentially malicious one, 
information about your setup when you don't have to.

You might have some luck with Adobe's FDF documentation:
   
http://partners.adobe.com/asn/acrobat/forms.jsp
    
Specifically, there's a link on that page to a document called "Forms
System Implementation Notes" which, on page 6, talks about returning
data in the same form versus returning data in a new form.

Make a text file and name it .htaccess.  Open it in your favorite editor and 
put in one line:

AddType application/x-httpd-php .htm .html

Upload it to the directory you wish to parse .html as .php.  This will also 
affect directories recursively -- those under the directory you put it in, in 
other words.

Side stepping the debate, all internal and extension *classes* now
follow studlyCaps, with the exception of MySQLi (and some obscure

functions continue to use underscores.

I give no odds if or when MySQLi will convert to studlyCaps.

I would personally like to see it standardized throughout the entire

We're not renaming all the function to remove underscores. Period.

However, PEAR uses studlyCaps for its objects. For that (and a
gazillion other reasons), it was decided to keep functions as-in, but
implement studlyCaps for OO methods only.

If an extension has a dual interface: procedural and OO, then the
functions use underscores and the methods use studlyCaps.

Hopefully, MySQLI will also adopt the studlyCaps API for it's OO
interface and then everything will be consistent. However, the
developer really doesn't want to do that, so we'll see what happens.

This is almost exactly what I'm doing where I work.
We need to record all changes to data (what changed, when, and by who).

If using MySQL is not a must, then you should look into PostgreSQL.
You can use triggers (and rules) in PostgreSQL to automatically record 
all the changes on table A into table B.

I don't think it would help much anyway. There is enough inconsistency 
in PHP's function namespace even without any kind of Grand 
studlyCaps/underscore Reorganization.

E.g. str_replace() and strlen(). In a perfect world they would be 
str_replace() and str_length() or strrepl() and strlen() or 
stringReplace() and stringLength() or whatever parallel pair floats 
one's linguistic boat.

But strlen() is from C (and PHP's C and Perl similarities are one of 
things that makes it easy to learn for programmers) so changing that fu 
nction's name would be a Bad Idea. (Adding an "alias" so that you could 
write either strlen() or stringLength() or whatever is an Even Worse 
Idea. You may only use one in all your programs, but you need to know 
how to read all the synonyms in case someone else uses one.)

Consistency surely is important in any language (human, computer, or 
otherwise) but is an impossible goal in any language (human*, computer, 
or otherwise.)

Human languages are wrought with irregularities (this sentence is 
Exhibit A) because they have diverse heritages, and are constantly 
changing because of the conscious and unconscious activities of their 
speakers.

Computer languages seem a little more rigid because we have something 
like the PHP interpreter acting as an uber-Acad?mie fran?aise and 
enforcing rigid grammar and vocabulary rules. But they're subject to the 
same forces that change them over time.

So, um, I suppose the point of this off-topic quasi-rant is just to say 
that hoping for "consistency" is an ultimately fruitless quest. Sure, 
there are larger and smaller levels of confusion that can reign 
depending on what kinds of choices are made as to PHP's direction but 
perfect standardization is a pipe dream.

for those who *REALLY* need it you could probably stuff it all into a config

function stringLength($a) {
    return (int)strlen($a); // problem solved

I happened to mention that one of my secret, and never before
expressed, goals of PHP 5 was to go back and "fix" all the old broken
function names.

At which point Rasmus piped up and said he would strangle anyone who
tried to rename basic C functions, like strlen(), to str_len(). After
that, I decide not to mention it again. :)

But, seriously, I don't mind strlen(). It's things like that the
opposite of htmlentities() is html_entity_decode() that really irk
me. I also hate the sort() works in-place instead of returning the
sorted array, but that's another issue.

As long as you set the headers properly, you can just use an html table as
an excel file.
I've had good success with this and have so far produced up to a 3mb file.
The only problem I've encountered is that I've only been able to Excel to
open the spreadsheet when it's that large. OpenOffice.Org essentially
hangs on it, as does Gnumeric. Too much parsing, I guess.

oh, when I say "set the headers" I mean if you're having php stream the
file out, else you can write it to a location and then the browser should
handle it right with the .xls extension.

when routing an existing/created file through php using fpassthru():
header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Content-type: application/vnd.ms-excel");
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"$filename\"");


when streaming php output:
header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$xlsFilename");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Expires: 0");


I know you're asking for an Excel library, but this does work. Heck, I'd
even call it v1.0 :)

I have a back office tool on a production box that uses 
Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer to create reports in Excel format and it hasn't 
given me any trouble.  I am not doing anything too crazy with it like 
creating buttons and macros, but I do have it creating some functions 
and formating cells.  If you just need to create simple spreadsheets I 
think it will work just fine for you.

If you're not doing any formatting or function-calling and just want to
get the data into a file that opens easily in Excel, you could also go
the tab delimited route and give the downloaded file a name that ends
with xls. This way you trick Excel into taking ownership of a text file,
and it handles the tab-delimited conversion transparently.

I wrote a custom utility tool a while back that converted content into a 
Excel-viewable file.  Basically to use a file with Excel you can either 
use HTML or tabs to separate your content, save as an .xls file, and to 
make viewable change your header MIME type to application/vnd.ms-excel.  
You could get a customized library, but I felt it easier to write your 
own class that would do the conversion process.

Later Versions of excel properly parses csv  (Comma Seperated Values) files,
and even own's the file type upon installation (by default, anyways) on MS.
So you COULD potentially just output a csv file, and Excel should open it
right up and parse it accordingly.  That's a basic, no research necessary,
out of time, low budget option anyways :)

You can also add Excel headers and send a HTML table and Excel will 
usually open it.

Be sure this goes to the browser first.

                $filename = 
strftime("add_your_filename_%y%m%d_%H%M.xls");
                 header("Content-type: application/x-msexcel");
                 header("Content-Disposition: attachment; 
filename=\"$filename\"");

Then a plain old HTML table should open in Excel.

Can't agree. We have installed PHP on IIS machines pretty often. Almost
never had a problems. Unless a module needs to be compiled. 

I actually find installing PHP on Windows and using IIS much simpler
than any other platform.

Shouldn't that be "Content-type: application.vnd-msexcel"?

that the 'PageRank' for the manual page about sessions

What kind of nonsense is that?

This should be very doable.  Some things to watch out for are the minor 
differences in file paths (e.g. Windoze back slashes versus Linux 
forward slashes), etc.   Generally the functionality is the same and if 
you are not doing tricks that force operating system commands you should 
be OK. 

Is there a reason not to run this offline on a Linux box?

Keeping the databases synchronized sounds a little more challenging.  
MySQL nicely allows you to offload an entire database into commands that 
restore the contents and structure elsewhere very easily.  If you only 
want to synchronize daily this could be the way to go.  If you want 
up-to-the-minute synchronization you may have to pipe messages between 
the boxes, and someone else would have to give you hints on that.

Newer MySQL has replication, I read it in Linux Journal.  :)

I *think* you can go cross-OS but admit my lack of knowledge.

It probably has something to do with the fact that no one links to it. Do
a search for link:http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php.

Try this URL instead:

If you want to run on Windows and don't want to install Apache, it sounds
like you want to change your LAMP app into a WIMP app. :-)

(WIMP = Windows, IIS, MySQL, PHP)

Ran into this article which covers some of the topics that have been
bouncing around on this list for a while.

"High Performance Practices - When Raw Speed is a Requirement"
http://www.php-mag.net/itr/online_artikel/psecom,id,502,nodeid,114.html

Some pretty good stuff here and also an explaination of why to avoid the
$array[bar] and to use $array['bar'] as well as a few other things like
the speed drop in joins and such.

Anyway, thought it might be a good read for some people who are
optimization nuts .. *cough*

I want people to look at the percentage improvement in performance
from installing APC.

It takes less than 30 minutes, can be done even by novice programmers,
and accomplishes far more than hours of other tweaks, like turning
double quotes into single quotes.

I _really_ don't want to WIMP out.  Guess I was really just looking for a
convenient way of installing AMP.   XAMPP or EasyPHP look like the real
deal.  Thanks to everyone for their input.

This is great.  Thanks Jeff.  So I'll use EasyPHP to quickly set up an AMP
environment on my client's Windoz machine.  Then I'll port the PHP scripts
and MySQL tables to their machine.  Two questions:

1. Anyone know of a good encryption tool to prevent the whole world from
seeing my source on the client's machine?  I publish under GPL, and
therefore, am happy to provide source - still, I would like to know who's
getting it, etc.

2. On occasion I might change my PHP scripts ;-) and therefore would like
the client's machine to receive these changes.  Any  good way to do this?

Thanks again everyone.

Mark

Your will may write php script on client machine which check for update
once a day, for example.

Try to use SOAP.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Wiki anti-spam CAPTCHA patch: $_SESSION conflict
Message-ID: <40926961.90608@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

After seeing thousands of Wikis (including mine) being defaced by the 
new Chinese SPAM-bots, I wrote an experimental patch in an attempt to 
thwart them.

Info on the patch is at:
http://www.moztips.com/index.php?id=222
The patch can be downloaded from:
http://www.moztips.com/code/wikipatch/

I am using PHP's sessions to store the text version of an Ascii Art Code 
that is displayed to users when they try to edit a Wiki page.

The problem is that PHP's sessions are also being used by the PEAR Auth 
class for my CMS. So, if I go to the Wiki, try to edit a page, and then 
come back and try to log into my CMS, I get weird session errors (blah 
blah already sent, etc).

I can work around this by emptying my cookies while I switch between 
Wiki edits and CMS edits, but there's got to be a better way.

Is there any way of preventing such $_SESSION conflicts?

Thanks in advance,

- Jay

Hi all,

I just found an answer to my own question. I used session_name() to 
rename the session.

The funny thing is that on Windows (my local test machine) having two 
scripts accessing a session with the same name did not cause a problem, 
whereas on the Linux production server it did.

On both session autostart is turned off ...

I am not sure why Win and Lin reacted differently here.

I need multiple sheets, formulas and formatting. HTML won't work.
But thanks for feedback. Will save the info away for future projects.

Try the pear class. I was able to do all three of those pretty easily 
using Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer.  The documentation is pretty good too.

I am glad to read that. The samples look very easy to follow.
Any problems you have encountered I should look out for?

Thanks for the feedback.
I will need to create an actual excel file though. I will be doing
formulas and formatting. Possibly a couple of sheets too.

How about using a super daemon like Inetd to call the program on demand
instead of having it up all the time. Should have some performance

Not really.  It can be a little tricky trying to keep track of the rows 
and columns if your data set changes shape and size all the time.  But 
thats the same no matter what you use.

Hope by now your issue is resolved. We encountered similar problems and
it had to do with the relative path where the fonts where. Put them in a
directory in the top most area of the site being used. I think that was
how we solved it. But it was a year or so ago so don't clearly remember.

ISSUE:
Hi list, hope every one is doing great.

My issue is with fonts.  I have to comment out all the fonts references
(I
am using it jpgraph) to get the script to work.  None of the fonts work,
even though my unix admin has compiled and installed, etc, checked
permissions...we are stumped.

Any one has any idea, maybe something we did not do with Apache, or PHP?
Any ideas?

Best wishes,

Chris, thanks a lot for your answer. So far, the most coherent
information. Even thou I have enjoyed a lot some other answers that were
to the point.

My team is clueless about ASP .NET so I hope we can convince the client
to go with PHP, we gave them enough info to think about.

But answering this, our biggest issue was finding developers that could
do our work in ASP, and that felt confident about.

Thanks and be well,
Carlos

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] PHP vs ASP

I personally know of a number of production relatively high volume 
sites using IIS and PHP.  For the most part PHP doesn't care what the 
httpd is.

As for the original question, I don't know of any sites that do a ASP 
(which version?) vs. PHP (which version?)

As for the implied question, Is PHP better than ASP?  Depends on how 
you define 'better'.
1.  With ASP you'll usually end up using MS SQL.  With PHP you'll 
usually end up using MySQL or PostgreSQL.  MS SQL is expensive to 
purchase and does require active administration
2.  With ASP you'll usually be using the native objects/classes 
provided by Microsoft.  With PHP well, I don't know if there is a 
usual.  You could use PEAR or any other thing you wanted.  Using the 
Microsoft classes is a significantly steeper learning curve.
3.  With ASP there are well publicized exploits that a hacker can and 
will attempt to use.  With PHP there are still exploits but they're not 
as well publicized and there's almost no way a hacker can guess which 
set of exploits to use before looking at the site.
4.  Internationally I am willing to bet there are more PHP developers 
than ASP developers.  Domestically I am willing to bet there are more 
ASP developers than PHP developers.
5.  In ASP, if an ASP class doesn't behave the way you want, it's 
difficult to dig into it to find out what it's doing, and is a task for 
only strong developers.  In PHP, if a class doesn't behave the way you 
want, then you change it.
6.  Well written ASP vs well written PHP is almost a wash.  The PHP 
code will typically run a bit faster on comparable hardware.  This 
might be a function of the httpd instead of the language.
7.  Well written ASP is as easy to maintain as well written PHP.
8.  It's somewhat easier to create poorly written ASP than poorly 
written PHP.  But not by much.
9.  If you're building a web app, and you're not using FrontPage, PHP 
is a great choice.  If you're building a web app, and you're using 
Frontpage, then ASP is the best choice.
10.  If you're writing code to integrate with MS Office, then ASP is 
the language to use.
11.  If you want to leverage the efforts of 10,000's of developers 
worldwide, and you don't want to be tied to the seemingly random and 
capricious actions of a large corporation, then PHP is the language to 
use.
12.  If you are willing to build your application the way Microsoft 
thinks you should want to build your application, then use ASP.  If you 
want to build the application your way (or the clients way), then use 
PHP.

I started in the VB/ASP world.  I used to work at Microsoft (as a 
contractor) where I wrote ASP code, among other duties.

I personally think PHP is a much better solution to most problems.  The 
thing that sold me on PHP is #12 above.  I've built over 250 web 
sites/applications.  I'd be willing to bet that less than 20 are built 
the way Microsoft thinks I should want to build the application.  This 
is a really big deal.  To me this is by far the most important part of 
the conversation.  I need to have a language/framework that lets me 
build the application the way I want to build it.

There are limitations in both languages.  There are workarounds in both 
languages.  If the boss thinks that ASP is a better language based on 
some marketing-esque stuff that s/he has read somewhere then the boss 
is probably 'wrong'.  But the 'rightness' or 'wrongness' of either 
language depends on your undefined 'better'.

Message-ID: <20040430173714.N64596@zoraida.natserv.net>

Anyone has gotten PEAR installed in FreeBSD through the port system?
I am getting an error saying that PHP is already installed. I have looked
at some documents on installing it from scratch and doesn't seem terribly
bad, but it would be so much better to do it from ports...
