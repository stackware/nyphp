&gt;<i>Like many on here, the whole shopping cart thing is a mess to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So...I just installed litecommerce, which was fairly painless. And changing
</I>&gt;<i>the templates, which use Flexy, was fairly easy. But deciphering the PHP code
</I>&gt;<i>is a nightmare. Who ever said OOP is easy? It just seems to obfuscate the
</I>&gt;<i>meaning of things. Something as simple as tracking down the origin of
</I>&gt;<i>order.details.error, which is in a template, becomes maddening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I&#8217;m on the verge of trying another cart, mainly because the ioncube-encoded
</I>&gt;<i>files conflict with Zend Remote debugging. And without this, trying to trace
</I>&gt;<i>the code using live interactions seems impossible. I&#8217;m sure this happens to
</I>&gt;<i>everyone, but what seems like a simple feature list grows and grows... But the
</I>&gt;<i>primary special requirements I have are the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Single sign-on &#8212; means all authentication goes through the primary site. So
</I>&gt;<i>far, I have hacked this by duplicating user info in the main site and the
</I>&gt;<i>shopping cart user profiles. Not optimal, but functional. 
</I>&gt;<i>Custom payment processor &#8212; just a call to a function on the main site. Again,
</I>&gt;<i>nothing mind-shattering 
</I>&gt;<i>Modified checkout to simply include shipping address fields &#8212; again, no biggie 
</I>&gt;<i>egoods pin #s support (the reason I choose litecommerce &#8212; they offer a module
</I>&gt;<i>that does this well) 
</I>&gt;<i>Meaningful error messages &#8212; meaning modern validation used on my main site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>None of these are overly complex. The challenging part is understanding
</I>&gt;<i>someone else&#8217;s code and mindset. The devil is in the details... I have also
</I>&gt;<i>discovered that integrating a shopping cart with anything other than simple
</I>&gt;<i>static functions from a primary site can lead to all sorts of config
</I>&gt;<i>conflicts, from phpini on upwards. Dated PHP4 code...can you say e-warning...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So...a general call for help and recommendations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am thinking of getting X-Cart because at least it is fully open source. But
</I>&gt;<i>it&#8217;s developed by the same people, so the code may be equally confusing.
</I>&gt;<i>OSCommerce and its derivatives are out &#8212; too many bad stories. Any other
</I>&gt;<i>ideas? Is it too much to ask for a great, easy to modify cart? The cost of the
</I>&gt;<i>cart is trivial compared to the cost of the custom code, time, maintenance,
</I>&gt;<i>aggravation, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Happy holiday,
</I>&gt;<i>Cliff
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think as far as shopping carts are concerned, we are in the era of 
charge by the hour programming. That is where the money is.

I also think it's time to redo the ecommerce platform. We have moved far 
beyong where we were when OSCommerce was built, and far beyond skinning 
(Zen cart). We don't need a new model for a shopping cart based *web 
site*, but a new model for ecommerce functions we can integrate into our 
modern web sites. To me that is *not* Shopify et al., because they 
charge too much without assuming much if any of the risk in a 
transaction. A few percentage points might seem like little at first, 
but if it is cream off the top and doesn't reduce liability, it's waste 
and waste needs to be eliminated. I think it is foolish to take on a 
recurring cost for design (eventhough that is a sweet deal for them).

Right now every successful store I see is hand coded from scratch, and 
severely platform dependent. I don't see a lot, but I've seen a dozen or 
so in 6 months.
