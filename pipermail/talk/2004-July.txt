I'm with Joel on this one -- I had no idea that XUL could be used to 
provide client-side apps embedded in a web page. Nice work, and I hope 
you'll consider giving a presentation at an upcoming meeting.

Any other XULers out there, care to comment?

Hi all,

Sorry if you get this twice- I submitted it the first time from my other 
(unsubscribed account) by mistake. I need to wake up properly and go for 
  a brisk walk instead of hopping on here like a sleepy bunny.

thanks for the positive feedback on the tutorial.  I guess Mozilla's 
client-end capabilities are not usually well publicized, and that 
combining PHP and MySQL with XUL can create awesome web applications. 
(Microsoft has also copied XUL somewhat with its XAML effort, which is 
still under development ...)

I would love to do a little presentation on this topic.

Hi Scott,

thanks for pointing out the article in PHP Architect. Actually, I read 
that article, and sent feedback to PHP Architect using its forums on it.

The article by Jonathan Protzenko mentions XUL and PHP, but it gives 
examples where HTML is embedded into a XUL document (using namespaces). 
So, in his example, in order that a XUL document submit information, it 
has have two sets of form elements: XUL input elements and HTML form 
elements. Since XUL input elements cannot be grouped into HTML-like 
forms in order to be submitted together, he uses JavaScript to copy 
information entered into XUL input elements into hidden HTML form 
elements. This is a round-about way of doing things, since you have to 
write two input elements (one XUL one, one HTML one) for each piece of 
data that you want submitted.

It also does not take advantage of XUL's ability to create desktop-like 
programs without the refresh that occurs when an HTML document is 
submitted.

In my article I use web sevices so that the XUL interface never has to 
change - it is not replaced by a new page when the submit button is 
pressed.

For more information on that article, please see:

http://www.moztips.com/index.php?id=254

and

Best Regards,

- Jay

Then I'd like to volunteer the sourcecode for Mambo Open Source, a 
project that I have been added to (I'm the resident database 
curmudgeon).  I can say that I have no vested interest in the code - as 
I have not contributed anything yet - but would enjoy an independent 
assessment by the community.

    http://www.mamboserver.com/

This is not an advertisement, but an offer to see what everyone else on 
this list thinks about their general coding style and architectural 
strategies.  This was a commercial project that was allowed an open 
source fork, which is what we have today.  Uses OO methodologies, and 
fairly clean coding style.

Subjecting Mambo to an acid test by NYPHPers would be awesome, as I 
often wonder what the norms are for coding styles, naming conventions, etc.

Just a thought,

-- Mitch

I'm a huge fan of Harry Fuecks' PHP Anthology series, where he openly 
states that his alterior motive is to bring us procedural cro-magnons 
kicking and screaming into the NOW of objects.  The second volume goes 
into design patterns and explains at length the methods behind the madness.

The books are published by SitePoint (www.sitepoint.com), and he also is 
their resident blogger, providing a wealth of OO knowledge; and he also 
runs his own site (www.phppatterns.com) where he discusses design 
patterns in OO PHP.

HTH,

-- Mitch

P.S. The reason I recommend these books so much is that they were the 
'whack upside the head' that I needed to fully grok OO with PHP.

Adam Trachtenberg's new book
'Upgrading to PHP 5 '

http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/upgradephp5/desc.html

is for veteran php programmers 
moving to PHP 5 

It's a book (obviously not an article) 
but still (very much ) worth considering.

I don't know if you saw that there was a 
new  PHP_Compat recently

(1.1.0 (stable) was released on 2004-06-25 )

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.php-compat.components.php

I was watching this in the Python world  (see Luxor and others) last 
year. Sourceforge has had alot of activity in XUL-based UI stuff, some 
of it tied to server side (Luxilla, etc).

I agree it would be good to have a talk, but can it be more in-depth in 
the PHP tie in?
Off the cuff ideas:

- enhanced site functionality for Mozilla browsers (example of coding 
interactive pages for IE and Mozilla, where Mozilla is the preferred 
browser for powerful reasons)
(instad of all the reasons NOT to use IE< how about some reasons TO use 
Mozilla?)

-XUL as authenticated JS - a long JS program becomes a very short, 
easily inspected one, that pulls the bulk of it's instructions from my 
PHP server (which is trusted). Doesn't this eliminate much of the 
security concerns about js client side?

Like most new ideas, this "code rating" one is grand. However, the 
suggestion that NYPHP look over Mambo in detail is (IMHO) outstanding. 
What better evaluation of the concept than a look at Mambo, which is 
"looked at" by tons of people, has been winning praise, is under active 
development.

The only problem I see is the way Mambo has been updating. Sure we need 
the security fixes, but so many small changes that don't seem to have 
been important enough to change, but apparently support the "bigger 
picture" that is 4.6 - it makes it had to commit if you can't be sure 
about the next release.

I'd love to see NYPHP improve Mambo's speed...

Thanks for the plug. "Upgrading to PHP 5" will be out later this
month. (Definitely before OSCON).

AFAIK, the only remaining item left to write is my biography. :)

I think the whole Mambo community would love this, as it helps everyone, 
both the developers and the community.  Having NYPHP do something like 
this could really start something, and definitely demonstrate the real 
strengths of the NYPHP organization as a whole.  We got a lot of serious 
cranium horsepower here (despite my involvement!), and this could be a 
very visible demonstration of the value of that resource.

Those problems were initially security patches that went to distribution 
before testing, resulting in patches of patches.  The development team 
is still smarting from that event (or, 'series of events'), so much so 
that they are seriously debating the validity of every single release.  
Live and learn :)

> I'd love to see NYPHP improve Mambo's speed...


5.0 has a completely different schema and content structure.  I can only 
promise that it will fly, and that the XML-RPC integration will enable 
rich client-side site management applications, maybe even in XUL   ;)

I am absolutely certain that the collective of NYPHP is capable of 
refining many aspects of the design of Mambo, and probably unearth some 
'unsolved mysteries' that have been indoctrinated as just historical 
anomalies...

I've learned a tremendous amount from working with Mambo, and would 
support any efforts that could benefit Mambo as well.

Nagios does this best ...

I mainly use it to watch the load on MySQL to make sure its running but im 
sure it can be tweaked to monitor PHP apps ...

Whoa, Cacti is fantastic - Ive never used it before but out of the box 
it is much easier to use than Nagios. (It also looks very slick). Thanks 
for pointing this out.

Can anyone recommend good docs on SNMP?

Can you recommend any docs for setting up SNMP for Cacti?

I've used Nagios for a number of years, and have been quite pleased with it:

You can also look around for a tutorial, there are a number of them out
there, I just don't have the sites handy.

Good Luck!

Is SNMP really that "simple"?  

Maybe its just me or does it sometimes seem like MIBS are so entirely complex that 
the name of the protocol does not do it justice?  I dont see that many PHP based 
admin tools, does anyone know of any?  It also seems like many of the hardware 
items Ive toyed around with are Ver 1 based vs. 3 ... its a protocol that screams 
for XML yet they stick with this SMI stuff.  Maybe someone w/ more SNMP experience 
can explain.

Well, SNMP is great for bandwidth economies.   When SNMP was first 
spec'd, we didn't have the benefit of cheap high-speed links. 
As such, it's based on a Tree structure, with numbers associated with 
tree elements and sub-elements.  The numbers in the Tree become object 
identifiers.
Note the tree includes other categories/standards.

                       Root
          ccitt-0   iso-1   iso/ccitt-2
                      / 
             org-3
                   \
                dod-6
                   /
             internet-1
    /             |              \                       \
private   directory     management-2    experimental
                                  |
                               MIB-1

So, when transmitting information from the managed object (e.g. a 
monitoring agent in a router) to the manager (e.g. HP OpenView),
the numbers:
    1.3.6.1.2.1
... indicate MIB information (follow the number string down the tree).

Now, there are MIB Groups, that indicate WHAT type of information is 
being sent.  IP is Group 4, with 33 objects.  .ICMP is Group 5 with 26; 
TCP is Group 6 with 17 objects; UDP is Group 7 with 4, etc.

Let's say we wanted to retrieve the number of IP datagrams/packets that 
were discarded (if any) by a router because of a lack of buffer space.
Since IP is Group 4 the numbers:
    1.3.6.1.2.1.4
... indicate the IP Group

Now let's say for the sake of discussion that out of the 33 objects that 
can be tracked in the IP layer, IpInDiscards is represented by the 
number 9.  So, the number string:
    1.3.6.1.2.1.4.9
... indicates the IpInDiscards data follows (we hope that number is 0 of 
course :)

If XML were used instead, names would be used instead of numbers.  for 
example:
   < iso>
        <org>
          <dod>
etc..

That's SNMP in a nutshell.  The MIB object numbering scheme makes for 
efficient transmisson and is easier on CPUs -- remember, we weren't 
trucking along with Pentium 4's @ 3GHz when SNMP was designed.

The above is a snippet from a series (Protocol Analysis) that I 
co-authored a while ago.  Not to date myself as too ancient, but I 
worked on some SNA MIB specifications and some other network-related RFCs.

HTH,
John

John,

Thank you very much for that clear explanation ... I had been working on a 
MIB and there was no value passed back @ all and it took so long to figure 
out the reason and it turned out it was something "not implemented yet" 
from the hardware manuf. lol. However looking @ the MIB info was eye 
popping at first ... 

Sticking w/ the subject do you (or anyone) know how snmp_read_mib in PHP5 
works?  It returns an int vs. a resource, does this just load a working 
MIB that youd like to view info about?  get,walk,realwalk,and all the 
other functions use host/community string for args.  Maybe im just missing 
something.  Im looking to parse info from the MIB description vs. the 
actual host.

Thanks again.

- Jon

I'll assume you have something that you can look at -- if so, what does 
a print_r() against the returned int show?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Keeping the PHP license separate from GPL'd code
Message-ID: <007a01c4603c$9b498f10$e98d3818@oberon1>


At php.net I read

question:
"Why is PHP 4 not dual-licensed under
 the GNU General Public License (GPL) like PHP 3 was?

answer:
"GPL enforces many restrictions on what can and cannot 
be done with the licensed code. The PHP developers decided 
to release PHP under a much more loose license (Apache-style), 
to help PHP become as popular as possible."

My questions are:

Let's say there's an extension for PHP 
that I have in mind to write and it will be 
based rather closely on some C code 
that is GPL'd (let's say close enough 
that it could be considered assimilated, 
as in 'resistance is futile').

Now let's further say that I will re-write 
this extension for a client. That is, I will 
download the GPL source for the client 
and then tailor that code the for client's 
needs (as an extension). The client wants to 
retain the source and modify it himself.

The first question I have is: 

Does the client have to keep track of all 
the changes he makes, because he is forced 
by the GPL license to give them back to 
the open source community from which the 
original code came from.

I am currently under the impression that 
the client can change, hack, and improve to 
his heart's content -- he just can't 
publish the extension -- and that would 
include giving it to a friend (for zero 
financial consideration) without making 
his code public.

But the main point that I am worried 
about (as would be potential clients 
in the case where some of the business 
logic might reveal a little more of 
their business strategy than they would like) 
is that such a client wouldn't have to 
give back his changes. He would only have to 
give his source to people who asked for 
it because they want to use a 'published'
extension. 

And just as importantly, to what degree can 
the GPL license spread to modules that take 
advantage of the extension. And here I 
mean should I be careful what PHP modules 
use the extension, because they will 
become GPL'd (assuming I don't want that).

Does anybody know for sure?

Can someone point me in the right 
direction on the web for some 
easy-to-understand info on this?

I haven't tried too much Goggling for 
this because I am presupposing that 
I would have to sift through a lot of 
mis-information -- even if I am 
'Feeling Lucky'.

Just in case anyone is looking to start to play with SNMP, beware that 
last I looked there were numerous problems with Microsoft's SNMP on 
WindowsNT/2000, and that SNMP is clear text (so community passwords and 
network device info are out in the open for all to see). There are IPSEC 
solutions to the clear text issue, for those doing that.

Rabid SNMP devices flooding the network with SNMP transmissions; either 
improperly configured devices, flawed implementations, or endless loops 
that catch that tie up the service -- all headaches that are not often 
worth the trouble. On most administered networks, SNMP devices are 
flagged for attention by the sysadmin (unless part of her own deployment).

Of course if you are deploying a solution based on SNMP reporting, then 
you need to deal with these issues anyway. I am just saying BEWARE as it 
may not be a benign plug-in-play exercise for your network and its users.

OK i decided to go with nagios, and in doing so i have found a PHP front end for nagios called oddly enough nagios php  i believe so far i have everything configured correctly but i am still getting the following error:

Warning: Smarty error: unable to read resource: "error.tpl" in /usr/local/Smarty/Smarty.class.php on line 1083


Now i have PEAR installed and working but i am not really sure what else to do i checked the line in Smarty.class.php and all it is a an error trigger function.  Does anyone have any ideas

As I understand it, typically extensions and libraries are released
under the LGPL.  This allows people use the extension in some larger
application without binding it (i.e. the application could be released
under any license).  However, if changes are made to the specific
library, the modifications would also fall under the LGPL.

If the module is under the full, more restrictive GPL, the application
using it would also have to be released under the GPL.  This would be
drastically limit the adoption of open source libraries and is one of
the reasons the LGPL was created.

It can't find the template file that it needs to display.  Make sure 
that you have error.tpl in the right place.

A presentation would be a great idea.  Last year sometime, we also had a
couple of core developers from Mozdev come in and talk (and XUL was
young in those days).  We can easily have them come back and do
something again, in coop with others.

You tell it where to look when you call display.
$smarty->display('path/to/templates/error.tpl');

If you are including the template in another template it works the same way.
{include file="path/to/templates/error.tpl"}

If you are using a relative path, it is relative to the script that is 
calling the display method or the template that has the include statement.

Also double check that your web server user has permission to view the file.

Thanks for you response.

In the case that I am considering, I would 
take something which is already GPL and 
sort of turn it into a library.

It seems (I think) I would not be allowed to 
turn GPL code into LGPL just by making 
it into a library.

I am starting to think I should just 
write the whole thing from scratch 
and license it however the client wants -- 
seems a shame though.

Message-ID: <1088781524.14688.23.camel@brian.vermonster.com>

Just came across this problem.  Consider the following code:

<?php

echo "Equivalent: ";
if (0 == 'Some String') { echo 'evaluates true'; } else { echo
'evaluates false'; }

echo "\n";

echo "Equivalent and same type: ";
if (0 === 'Some String') { echo 'evaluates true'; } else { echo
'evaluates false'; }

?>

I get 

Equivalent: evaluates true
Equivalent and same type: evaluates false



Does anyone know why (0 == 'string') evaluates to true?   

According to the manual, the integer 0 converts to FALSE.  A non-empty
(or non-zero) string is considered TRUE. I would think if (FALSE ==
TRUE) should be evaluated as false?

I believe it's because the 0 is being cast internally to a string value 
since it's being compared against a string.  So, a 0 int is a '30' ASCII 
string value and therefore TRUE since it's now a non-zero

When you compare two scalars of different types, the scalar on the right 
hand side is converted into the type of the scalar on the left hand side.

So in the first comparison, the PHP interpreter turns 'Some String' into 
an integer, following the rules it always does for things like that 
(e.g. if you wrote "print 6 + 'pants';") which is that anything 
numbery-looking at the start of the string is turned into a number and 
the rest is discarded. There are no numbers in 'Some String', so the 
"integer value" of the string is 0.

You can see the same thing at work with something like this:

if (5 == "5 alive") { print "true"; } else { print "false"; }

This prints "true".

Actually to be precise, I should say that when you compare a string and 
a number, the string is turned into a number, independent of who is on 
the right and who is on the left.

Good point, I actually witnessed this first hand with a trap flood which 
took a long time to nail down ... I thought there was encryption support 
of some kind in v3.

BTW, does the net-smtp lib allow you to create traps?  Ive noticed with 
php5 stream_socket_server() you can receive them but there is no interface 
for snmptrap ... does anyone write apps that send them?  Im guessing its 
trivial ...

I spent 2 hours studyig SNMP as a management tool for internetworks 
under Mark Miller many moons ago. He was *passionate* about hands-on 
control of the SNMP process, from hand-crafting MIBS from the ground up 
(for any device you like), to capturing data streams and breaking apart 
each piece for knowledge of what was happening on the network. As I 
recall he was way ahead of his time, in that network management tools at 
the time were all but ridiculously over hyped and under powered.

Standards held back reliable deployment then, which he aptly 
demonstrated every other minute or so.

His book "*Managing Internetworks With SNMP" *was good after taking that 
course, but without the training it is considered a very difficult book, 
not for beginners. The "official" books are listed here 
http://www.snmp.com/protocol/snmpbooks.html.

Hi Hans and others,

I would be happy to work with others (especially those from MozDev who 
know more than I do on the subject of XUL) to do a presentation on using 
XUL with PHP.

I think Pete Collins is the main MozDev person ...

Best Regards,

I just gave a talk @ NYCwireless on the WRT54G router and this came up, you should google for the discussions between Linksys and their position on 
the GPL because it puts a better perspective on it (for me anyways) and it was an interesting case where they have absolutley no choice but to release 
the code or face the Stallman wrath.  On the flip side from what I read, Linus made comments pertaining to "modules" which do not need to be open and 
can be provided as binary form only.  So in the case of the router, the source is completely available except Broadcom not releasing source code for 
the radio drivers.  I think the saying would be "anything that happens at the GPL stays at the GPL", but if you based code on something you wrote from 
scratch, released it as a binary "module", it would be ok (guessing).

I would venture and take a guess that the same applies in the area of PHP, the extensions can be released closed, although I have not personally seen 
any closed extensions for PHP anywhere.  I dont know what the rules are governing including "php.h" (and its functions).  You are really not making 
modifications to PHP itself.  

However Im sure if it was later found out that you did use GPL material (as in the Linksys case), it would be a no no.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] setcookie, sub-domains, IE
Message-ID: <d0cb926204070209583f5db9c3@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

I have run into a strange problem.  I am setting a cookie that I want
to access across multiple sub domains on my companies site.  I set the
cookie:


setcookie('test','testvalue',strtotime("+1 year"),'/','.ourdomain.com');

This works fine in Mozilla, Netscape, and Firefox.  But IE doesn't
recognize the cookie when trying to access it from $_COOKIE['test'] on
the other subdomain.

I read on the very bottom of http://www.php.net/setcookie that
"Internet Exploer 6 now requires sites that set cookies to have P3P
policies. "  does this have anything do to with my problem?  IE seems
to set and hold cookies with in the same sub domain just fine on our
site.

Any ideas!?!

Thank you!

I know this is not exactly what you want.
But it might give you some ideas...

"PHP Traverser is a script that makes a directory 
browsable recursively, i.e. with this script it is 
possible to browse a whole directory structure, 
where the root of this tree is the directory where 
the script was placed..."

I was actually looking for something that was more remotely mapable ... 
something such as powermapper (powermapper.com i think) but not GUI, just 
a CLI tree overview of a website, probably not that hard using regex and 
wget.  I should make it a little PHP5 app instead of lazily shleping 
around the web looking for one :-)

Isn't IE fun!

I guess a quick workaround is to check for IE and set the cookies for the 
various subdomains up front.

I don't see how you could get this info without spidering, and once you 
start writing a spider you need to consider all the aspects of cloaking, 
robots.txt, and  dynamic nature (do you want a virtual tree or the real 
deal??). You don't want to gte caught in one of my spidertraps :-)  and 
mine aren't nearly as vicious as many out there.

Quite another story if it is your own site or one you have admin access to.

Jon,

I'll take a look at loading a test MIB into the active tree from a MIB 
desc file.. . Just for the record, you're interested in parsing thru 
(displaying) the actual MIB description, right?  I need to pysch some 
stuff for a security tools course I'm writing, so it won't be wasted energy.


btw, Talk List -- sorry for the 180degree dyslexic 'explaination' of 
casting int to string instead of vice-versa ...
woooops, coming back from vacation is nasty.  I haven't actively coded 
PHP for over a year now -- can you tell?

"Better to let people think you're a fool than to open your mouth and 
remove all doubt"  -- gawd, I hate it when that happens

John

And write permissions on the necessary directories.  When Smarty compiles 
pages for the first time, it writes files and you'll need the appropriate 
permissions on that destination.

Yep ... I have a few sensors laying around which speak SNMP (v1) and I 
have the MIB so I was thinking of a web interface for it, but it seems like a 
generic idea would be nice to have.

Does having traps sent directly to email/sms make sense?  Im sure this 
occurs all the time ...

Java "duuudes" on slashdot pounce all over anything PHP..
Any PHP article on there will have 300 of them mention how Java is
better because of "x" etc..
This one I imagine will have the extra dose of it because he is talking
of moving away from java..
Heh..
Anyway, maybe we should descend en-masse and defend php?

The 'x' that they almost invariably mention is 
threading -- something which if not done with 
the utmost of care will actually act as a
deterrent to scalability.

As a footnote, as nearly as I can make out, 
Java does not automagically do threading 
with the 'utmost of care' I am talking about.

Java programmers I know are fond of saying 
things like: "That's the beauty of Java -- all 
threading is taken care of for you."

While we're at it, anyone up for a pc vs mac discussion?  Maybe one
comparing the color blue with the color green?

Regardless of my opinions of the validity of the now industry wide argument,
it's nice to see some big names in the php world ensuring an appropriate
defense.

yeah, traps (aka alerts) are pretty handy... for example, say a core 
router WAN link goes down.  That sends an alert to the monitoring 
program (eg. HPOpenView) on the UDP trap port 162.   With an important 
router link down, a support person will probably get paged automagically.

Ok, I've got a working php5 environment now and I'm using a small test 
MIB with the snmp_read_mib() call.  I've gotten by that but cannot see 
anything else with the usual print_r's.  Fired up my Zend Studio to have 
a look-see with the debugger, and got a fatal error -- no such function 
-- so... I'm in the process of downloading the new 3.5 Studio which 
should take care of that problem, since the read_mib call is new in 
php5.  29MB on a dialup... sheeesh.

stay tuned,
John

Here's the short version:

The tests were run on a win2k pro box with sp2.   The SNMP service must 
be installed and running.  You don't need the SNMP Trap service running 
for the tests, but I started it anyway, since I might mess with that later.

To set up a quickie test environment, I used XAMPP  
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html
If you scroll down, you'll find the php5xampp-dev package.  Naturally, I 
went into the php.ini file and uncommented the snmp extension.  With the 
windows version, phpinfo() shows UCD-SNMP (ver. 4.2.3)  --  *nix will 
use net-snmp, as you know.

- snmp_read_mib() is still causing a fatal error (no such function...) 
when debugging with Zend Studio ver. 3.5, so I moved on...  After 
testing a few things, I believe the purpose of this function is to read 
in custom MIB descriptions on the fly (else, you must restart apache) so 
you can use names instead of numbers.  If you're using just standard 
MIBs, like RMON for the sensors, you won't need to call 
snmp_read_mib().  You mention SNMPv1 sensors, but the RMON MIB is 
SNMPv2.  Are they custom sensors, and not RMON probes?

This is important if you want to use names instead of numbers in the PHP 
code:  (the numbers cause brain damage)
- on my c: drive, I created a c:\usr\mibs directory.
- copy all the contents of the "extras/mibs" directory  -- there are 
over 50 [.txt] files; some are not MIBs, bit it's easier to copy them all
- after doing this, you must restart Apache which apparently causes the 
MIB descriptions to be loaded into the active MIB tree
- this will allow the syntax:  $sysdesc = snmpget('localhost', 'public', 
'system.sysDescr.0');
- instead of having to use:   $sysdesc = snmpget('localhost', 'public', 
'.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0');
- note: 'system.sysDescr.0' and all the other names are case-sensitive
- if you want to see names/numbers for the "system" stuff, just display 
SNMPv2-MIB.txt


The following is a test script I hacked on to get things running -- 
lotsa trial and error.  The SNMP community name "public" should work 
fine here.  On a real network, if you don't change your community names 
to non-default values, well, shame on you.

<?php
// filename mibtest.php

// I made this call to verify snmp_mib_read() worked, and didn't use it 
again
// snmp_read_mib('c:\php5xampp-dev\htdocs\mib\mycustom-MIB.txt') or 
die('bad mib read');

// the following two calls should yield the same results
// note the period at the beginning of the ObjectID for the numbered 
system description -- very important
$sysdesc = snmpget('localhost', 'public', '.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0');
echo $sysdesc;
echo '<br /><br />';
$sysdesc = snmpget('localhost', 'public', 'system.sysDescr.0');
echo $sysdesc;


echo '<br /><br />';
// snmpwalk didn't work here
// NULL says to return ALL object ids beginning at the root
$arr = snmprealwalk('localhost', 'public', NULL);
echo $arr['system.sysName.0'];

// snmpwalk didn't work here
// uncomment these and you'll see a crapload of stuff
//$arr = snmpwalkoid('localhost', 'public', NULL);
// print_r($arr);

echo '<br /><br />';
$sysname = snmpget('localhost', 'public', 'system.sysName.0');
echo $sysname;

// this would return UDP (group 7) info  -- udpInErrors
//$udperrs = snmpget('localhost', 'public', '.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.3.0');
// or...
// $udperrs = snmpget('localhost', 'public', 'udp.udpInErrors.0');

?>


I think the above will get you in the ballpark to start psyching things 
out.  If you need any additional input, we may have to take it off-list, 
cause it can be a lil ugly.

just noticed they will be renaming java 1.5 to Java 5.0 ...

i dunno, having being a J2EE developer for a while i cant really say that 
there is so much remarkable from jumpin from Java 2.0 to 5.0 (unless the 
pressure of PHP5 can get to them :-)

one of the interesting things ive noticed is how "short" they are trying 
to make things ... and how they try to bite off foreach without actually 
nameing it ...

String[] colors = {"blue","green","red"}
for(String color: colors)

hmm ...

Message-ID: <008401c4623f$cdd66ca0$0a01a8c0@webdev>

I know what I want to do has been done a thousand times before, however I am
looking for suggestions on the best way to go about it. I figured someone
here might be able to suggest something.

I have two tables, one holds products, the other holds photos. There is a
one to many
relationship between products and photographs. For example...

TABLE 1 (products):
products.id
products.title
products.description

TABLE 2 (product photos)
photos.id
photos.id_product
photos.filename
photos.height
photos.width
photos.position

the 'position' field is used to determine which is the main photo (photos
are ordered by their position). IN other words the photo with position 1
would be the main thumbnail.

There are two things I would like to be able to get from a SELECT statement.
The first is a list of products with the thumbnail info for the product. I
immediately see two ways of doing this but am looking for a better solution.

SOLUTION 1: select all products, and then loop through that result set and
do another select to get the photo information on each iteration of the
loop. This would be slow, and create unnecesary overhead on the database. I
do not think this is a good solution.

SOLUTION 2: select all products and then use subselects to get the
photograph information. I do not like this solution either, as there seems
to be no clear way to get multiple fields such as filename and height and
width etc without many subselects, or perhaps a creative concatenation
routine.

SOLUTION 3: I am open to suggestions... please!

The other main task I would like to accomplish is to be able to select all
the product information for a single product and get all the photographs for
the product as well. I cannot think of an efficient way to do this without
issuing two queries (one to get the product, and one to get the photo).

I am very interested to hear how others have tacked simular situations like
this. Any help is greatly appreciated.

You should JOIN tables using their relation that is
"products.id=photos.id_product"
So you would have:
    SELECT products.id, products.title, products.description,
                    photos.id AS id_photos, photos.filename,
                    photos.filename, photos.height, photos.width
    FROM products
    LEFT JOIN photos ON(products.id=photos.id_product)
    WHERE photos.position='1'

    This can only be acomplished with 2 queryes... Because of the result...
    Let's say that "x" are results from products and "y" are from photos...
you would have something like:
xxxx yyyy
        yyyy
        yyyy

    This result set is imposible to be represented by an SQL server... the
closest match you can get is
xxxx     yyyy
NULLs yyyy
NULLs yyyy
    But this would make things worse because you would have to skip many
NULLs...

Have a good time programming !

While I recommend the approach described above, I add that it is 
possible to accompish the end result without two queries, using 
practical techniques that are not pure database methods. It is also 
possible that a non-normalized database schema would serve the 
application well, with a minial impact on scalabaility up to some 
practical limit.

However, given the potential for mis-use, I agree these are best 
reserved for the experienced programmer, or for deployment of an 
"optimized" application after development is completed. Unless one 
understands the impact of a shortcut, taking tha shortcut involves risk 
(and is not generally recommended).

To get all the product information with the ALL the thumbnails for each 
product:

select * from products p inner join photos f on (p.id = f.id_product)

If you want the Main thumbnail then you can add the where clause. You can add 
p.id=some_id to the where clause to get the result for a certain product.

I hope this helps.

came across this little snippet that was on freshmeat ...

http://www.eder.us/projects/php_version/

basically you run it across a php file and it gives you the minimum php 
version requirement and modules needed to run it ...

example:
$php php_version.php *.php
php_version.php ... 4.2.0 (array, dir, errorfunc, filesystem, funchand, 
info, math, regex, strings, tokenizer, var)
test.php .......... 3.0.0 (mysql)

Hey there:

I'm getting this error when doing a file_exists check to see if a file exists:

Warning: file_exists(): open_basedir restriction in effect. 
File(/home/httpd/vhosts/store.purlsoho.com/httpsdocs/controlroom/handlers/main_h.php) 
is not within the allowed path(s): 
(/home/httpd/vhosts/store.purlsoho.com/httpsdocs:/tmp) in 
/home/httpd/vhosts/store.purlsoho.com/httpdocs/controlroom/index.php 
on line 127

I get the error when the file is not present, even though the passed 
path is within open_basedir's limitations.

Is there any way I can route around this brain-dead open_basedir bug, 
other than prefixing my file_exists() call with a '@'?

Thanks, Paul. :-)

I guess I missed all the fun, since I've been in the middle of nowhere in
Tennessee for the past several days. I logged on Friday to read all the
news about Friendster and the surrounding hoopla, so I wrote about it in
my blog. I guess if you write something that can be misinterpreted as "PHP
is better than Java," then you have a decent chance of getting covered by
Slashdot and a bunch of blogs, because it's nice and controversial.

Of course, I do think PHP is better than Java in a number of ways, but I
wasn't really arguing that at all, nor did I even say that Java doesn't
scale. My main point, which most Slashdot people seem to have missed
(surprise), is that scalability is not what's really important to most
people. You want your site to perform fast at your maximum load, whatever
that may be. If your site is slow as crap, do you think your users really
care that it scales well and will be just as slow (but no slower) with
twice as many users? Hell no! :-)

My (perhaps a bit goofy) example of a tractor and a truck was my attempt
at illustrating that. The tractor, which scales far better than the truck,
is a poor choice for speed. Speed is what really counts, and since
scalability is a relative measurement, it's somewhat useless in that
regard, especially by itself. Yes, if something scales really poorly
(http://shiflett.org/images/scalability_1.png), it's inevitably going to
slow down as your userbase grows, and with that slowdown being
exponential, it will matter. But, with multiple approaches to the same
problem, all of which can be made to scale, performance is so much more
important.

I guess I was also tired of hearing the false claims that Java scales and
PHP doesn't, since it's much easier to argue the other way around. Of
course, my argument that PHP naturally scales well doesn't take into
account that most of the applications we write use sessions, a database,
and the like. For a moderately complex application, PHP does not naturally
scale, and it's just as hard to make it scale as it is to make Java scale,
but I wasn't going to argue both sides. :-)

I question this. Can you output the value of open_basedir just before your
file_exists() check? This will give us more information to work with.

You can.
 
This looks like the path/directory structure on a Plesk linux server, is
that the case?
 
If it is, you need to edit either php.ini (not reccomended) or the domain's
vhost.conf file (which is in /conf)
 
You'll just add a:
<Directory /home/httpd/vhosts/store.purlsoho.com/httpsdocs>
Php_admin_value open_basedir
/all/of/the/paths:/you/want/to/be/able:/to/access/files/from
</Directory>
 
That's how it works on my Plesk box...

	Hey there:

	I'm getting this error when doing a file_exists check to see if a
file exists:

	Warning: file_exists(): open_basedir restriction in effect.
File(/home/httpd/vhosts/store.purlsoho.com/httpsdocs/controlroom/handlers/ma
in_h.php) is not within the allowed path(s):
(/home/httpd/vhosts/store.purlsoho.com/httpsdocs:/tmp) in
/home/httpd/vhosts/store.purlsoho.com/httpdocs/controlroom/index.php on line
127

	I get the error when the file is not present, even though the passed
path is within open_basedir's limitations.

	Is there any way I can route around this brain-dead open_basedir
bug, other than prefixing my file_exists() call with a '@'?

Hey:

The error message tells you both the path of the file which it thinks 
is out of range, and the allowed paths.  I re-quote here:

/home/httpd/vhosts/store.purlsoho.com/httpsdocs/controlroom/handlers/main_h.php

is the file i am looking for

/home/httpd/vhosts/store.purlsoho.com/httpsdocs:/tmp

You will notice that the value being passed is certainly within the 
allowed path.  The file in question doesn't exist, but call me crazy, 
I thought the whole point of "file_exists()" was to tell you if the 
file exists or not.

(Sorry, not venting my acrimony at anyone here, just at this 
seemingly idiotic open_basedir implementation.)

So...is this just a side effect of open_basedir?  It renders the 
file_exists() function useless?

(To John:  yes, this server is using the horrible, awful Plesk tool, 
which is also causing me stress.  I want to avoid editing the 
httpd.include file, because each time you make a minor change to your 
domain, Plesk conveniently overwrites your changes for you, so error 
messages appear all over your site until you make the changes again. 
I'm trying to find a solution that won't fall prey to this 
inadequacy.)

what happens when you do a file_exists 
with the open_basedir set to the empty string?

Hmm,

As a PHP solution, you could run with solution 1 or 2, and wrap it
with a class that makes everything nice and pretty for whatever ends
up deailing with the data.

However, more along the lines of a different solution, i have seen two
posts that may be of use

So that first path is the file you're looking for, and the second is the
value of open_basedir? If this is true, then your file is not within the
allowed path, and thus the error.

Really? I assumed that it would be fine, since that's just static content.
I set up a "cool cache" for all of my blog archives using an error
handler, so the static file is only be generated the first time.

Of course, I'm on a cheap shared host, but how hard is it to serve static
content? :-)

Maybe I should have. :-) Jokes aside, static content is as good as you can
do on a shared server. I gave my host the best chance of handling the
traffic that I could; the rest is up to them.

I plan to eventually move to a better host, but I'm cheap. :-)

Chris,

take a look at www.hostproservices.com
i have hosted my site with them for about 3 years now and have had no
downtime what so ever, as for the handling of traffic i cannot say
because i dont have a large site however i know that the admin keeps the
boxes limited on how many sites he places on them.  The admin/owner is a
good friend of mine, just tell him idle sent ya if ya check it out ;)

Marc

OK, so...you don't have to mess with httpd.include.

Just use a <Directory> block to change the value of open_basedir (the
directions in my previous post should work)

It's not that big a deal. You just have to learn what Plesk will let you
change and what it wants to maintain control over.

But remember, you'll have to restart the apache service once you add that
block.

Is this a rackspace box? If so, there's a lot of useful info in their
support forums.

I'm sure it wasn't difficult for the machine to serve up the static pages, 
but the bandwidth used might have been a killer, especially if they charge 
you per MB/GB over your monthly quota.  That may not have been an issue 
though if they throttled your account... but I'd keep an eye on the next 
bill :)

I think it's time to move on from my old Dell Inspiron 2000 and I'm trying
to talk myself into a G4 PowerBook.

You happy Powerbook owners, please tell me about how great they are for
AMP development. Persuade me how easy it is to run Apache/PHP, mysql, and
also things like the Zend and Eclipse IDEs, Tomcat, cvs (or perhaps
Subversion) etc. Assure me it will also be possible to figure out a way to
run the one and only Windoze program I'd like to keep, which is Paint Shop
Pro. Convince me that it will be fast and stable and just plain cool and
I'll wonder how I lived without it.

Further, enlighten me as to what specs and features and stuff you think a
geek would require in order to attain nirvana.

Also -- maybe a naive question -- can you build and install something like
Quanta (the html editor) on one of these things? I'd expect the install
might get weird because the standard locations of things are different on
Mac OS X vs. *nix platforms.

Feel free to answer privately if you think this is too OT.

Many thanks,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Using CURL to retrieve content of $_SESSION-dependent
	URL
Message-ID: <40EB2058.50007@adnet-sys.com>

What is the most standardized method of utilizing the CURL functions in 
PHP (version 4.3.2) to be able to retrieve the contents of a remote URL 
that happens to be dependent upon $_SESSION for its content display?

I've tried the following class methods for display and I have most 
everything working until I get to a URL that requires $_SESSION:

[PHP]
class Timer extends View {

   function Timer() {}

    function &setCookieCurlSetOpt(&$ch) {        // STATIC VOID METHOD
        if ($this->cookieName) {
         $qs = '&' . $this->cookieName . '=';
         if (is_array($_COOKIE[$this->cookieName]) || 
is_object($_COOKIE[$this->cookieName])) {
          $qs .= urlencode(serialize($_COOKIE[$this->cookieName]));
         } else {
          $qs .= urlencode($_COOKIE[$this->cookieName]);
         }
        } elseif (@sizeof(array_values($_COOKIE)) > 0) {
         foreach ($_COOKIE as $key => $val) if (is_array($val) || 
is_object($val)) $qs .= "&$key=" . urlencode(serialize($val)); else $qs 
.= "&$key=" . urlencode($val);
        }
        if ($qs) curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIE, substr($qs, 1, 
strlen($qs)));
    }

      function &displayHTML($url = '') {            // STATIC HTML 
STRING METHOD
        global $projectFolderName, $PHPSESSID;
        if (is_object($this) && !$this->getURL() && $url) 
$this->setURL($url);
        if (is_object($this)) $url = $this->getURL();
        if ($url && ini_get('allow_url_fopen')) {
         $url = $this->configureURL($url);
         // grab URL and pass it to the browser
         $ch = curl_init();
         $this->setCookieCurlSetOpt($ch);
         //$this->setPOSTCurlSetOpt($ch);
         curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
         curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
         $this->setTime($this->startTime);    // SET START TIME
         ob_start();
          curl_exec($ch);
          $html = ob_get_contents();
         ob_end_clean();
         $timer = $this->setTime($timer);

         curl_close($ch);
         $html = preg_replace('/(.*<body[^>]*>)/i', '$1<p><b>' . ($timer 
- $this->startTime) . " seconds to run URL: \"$url\"</b>", $html);
        }
        return $html;
    }

}
[/PHP]

utilizing this class in a script: timer.php:

<?php

  session_cache_limiter();
  session_start();
  echo '<P>My session from timer.php is: '; print_r($_SESSION);
...

?>

I see my $_SESSION variable.

Now, if timer.php instantiates a Timer object that uses the URL 
parameter of "http://www.myphpwebsite.com/index.php" it will scrape that 
site.  The site's script: index.php, also has the following:

<?php

  session_cache_limiter();
  session_start();
  echo '<P>My session from index.php is: '; print_r($_SESSION);
...
?>

Now here's the kicker:  If I call index.php directly, everything's fine, 
$_SESSION exists, all is fine.  If I call index.php as a scrape via 
timer.php, then timer.php displays $_SESSION but index.php's scrape 
shows nothing, just an empty array instead of $_SESSION with its contents:

[timer.php]
My session from timer.php is:  Array([lots of stuff])

My session from index.php is: Array()
[/timer.php]

Is there something about autoglobals and CURL in general, or is there 
something specific about $_SESSION and CURL, or perhaps session_start() 
and CURL?  I am not sure what I can do about this dilemma as it means my 
Timer object will not accurately show how long it took for index.php to 
evaluate and download since the returned content is wrong due to the 
seeming nonexistence of $_SESSION all of a sudden ($_SESSION is not 
changed at any time during the run of timer.php)

I hope this is detailed enough to provide a clear picture of exactly 
what is going on and will allow for someone to give me further insight 
into the workings of CURL with $_SESSION or autoglobals in general.

Thanx
Phil

That I can.  I use the standalone version of Virtual PC for Mac along with 
my orginal CD of Windows 2000 to run HomeSite and TopStyle, which are two 
Windows-only editors that I find myself using on a daily basis.

David-

I have a 12? powerbook G4, and I do everything you mentioned. Not only that,
but I use it play DVDs through my TV (with a $20 adapter), and stream MP3s
into my stereo system. Plus in addition to all the nice Unix stuff (SSH,
PHP, Apache, Tomcat, Java, CVS, MySQL, etc), you can run Xwindows apps like
Ethereal.

Other nice features:
- built in bluetooth syncs up to a phone or pocket pc (or both in my case)
- you can run an external monitor and keyboard (like the wireless bluetooth
mouse and keyboard)
- the battery life is excellent (at least 5 hours for cruising the web)
- The 1 GHz G4 processor is plenty fast
- You can run a ton of app simultaneously without the machine bogging down
(not like any of the windows workstations I use )

You should really consider dumping PaintShop Pro for Photoshop (OS X
native), but if you _have_ to use it, Virtual PC will do nicely (not
quickly, mind you).

I?m not familiar with Quanta, but many unix apps compile under OS X pretty
well. Plus many vendors and open source folks are realizing how many unix
users on running macs and most of the best software is now available (check
out DbVisualizer for example)

If you have control over both "sites" and need to exchange information,
instead of site-scraping you may want to consider an architectural
change and use XML-RPC or SOAP .  There are modules on PEAR as well as
new native functions for PHP5.

Unfortunately we're not running PHP 5 on all processes and the app has 
to be portable so we'll have to take a backwards approach and use PHP 4 
solutions instead.  I will look up info on XML-RPC as I am vaguely 
familiar with this process, SOAP I know absolutely nothing about 
whatsoever except that it gets you squeaky clean.

That's a pretty easy sell, considering it's easily the best laptop money
can buy.

> You happy Powerbook owners, please tell me about how great they are for
> AMP development.

For development, I find Mac OS X comparable to Linux, with the added bonus
of BBEdit, one of the finest text editors on any platform. That was my one
software purchase.

I was in the market for a laptop a little over a year ago, and I was
pretty narrow-minded on an x86 architecture. I've been using Red Hat for
years, and I didn't feel like learning anything new. After all, I just
wanted something I could carry with me and do some minor development while
traveling, and I also wanted to be able to give the occasional
presentation from it.

IBM and Dell were my top choices. IBM has a X series that is nice and
small, and Dell had something like that, too. But, both made you sacrifice
a lot of nice features for the smaller laptops, and none could match the
elegance of the PowerBook. I finally just gave in and bought a 12"
PowerBook, thinking I would just install Yellow Dog or something if Mac OS
X turned out to be a pain.

I've yet to uninstall Mac OS X. It has all of the niceties of a
"mainstream" OS - I can buy games, tax software, and such without having
to do anything weird to get them running. It also has all of the great
development features of a Unix. Throw fink into the picture, and you can
make it look and feel almost exactly like Linux. Only the directory
structure is different, and that becomes less annoying with time.

> Persuade me how easy it is to run Apache/PHP, mysql

As easy as any Unix, which is pretty easy. Plus, it more closely resembles
a proper server environment, so anytime I'm setting up stuff like this, I
don't feel like it's a wasted effort, because I'm learning something
useful (or keeping my "skills" sharp). Contrast this with setting things
up on Windows...

> also things like the Zend and Eclipse IDEs

I don't use IDEs, so I can't say, but you will have access to arguably the
best text editor. The only real competition for the throne would be
UltraEdit for Windows. I still use vim a lot (and I know Dave is an avid
emacs user), but these types of full-fledged GUI editors are pretty nice.

> Tomcat, cvs (or perhaps Subversion) etc.

I use CVS from my PowerBook, but I've never played with Tomcat or
Subversion.

Possible, yes, but unless there is a Mac version of that, it might be a
hassle. I use Gimp myself, and I know all the Adobe products are available
on Mac (most of the artsy folks seem to prefer Macs).

For what it's worth, I can't imagine ever "going back." I'm a laptop snob
now, thanks to Apple. It's sort of like how I'm a barbecue snob, thanks to
living in Memphis for a few years.

Fast - It's no faster than a Pentium 4, and arguably slower. The
architecture is quite a bit different. Coming from my PII, which is my
fastest PC, it seems pretty damn fast. :-)

Stable - It's FreeBSD.

Cool - It's Apple.

> Further, enlighten me as to what specs and features and stuff you think
> a geek would require in order to attain nirvana.

Install fink first thing, and if you're a Unix guy, consider buying
O'Reilly's Mac OS X for Unix Geeks.

> Also -- maybe a naive question -- can you build and install something

Yep, everything is normal in that regard. Configure, make, make install.

Another telling sign is that well more than 50% of laptops at conferences
such as OSCON and ApacheCon are Apples. If you go to the speaker lounges,
that number is probably well over 80%.

Well, I'm a longtime Mozilla user and then switched to Firefox.  IMO 
Firefox is a great browser, and they have a MAC version.

So far behind what? It has comparable features to the Gecko-based
browsers. Maybe you're thinking of IE? It's hopelessly behind.

As for options, I have Mozilla, Safari, Camino, Firefox, Internet
Explorer, Galeon, and lynx. There are probably other options; these are
just what I happen to have installed.

Firefox still has a few tweaks to make before it surpasses Galeon as the
best Web browser, but I think it will happen.

Actually I should have read your email more carefully, sorry.  No I do 
not have control over either "site" as this is a portable application.  
I will ultimately have to not be able to use a messaging service 
client/server platform of any kind because of the necessity of 
portability.  Back to "scraping".. :(

Wow. Thank you very much everybody.

A footnote:  the sole reason I'm still wedded to PaintShop Pro -- well,
ok, not the sole reason:  it's also ~familiar~ to me and we all know how
important (albeit subjectively) that can be -- is its red-eye removal tool
for my digital pix. Click, click, done. I once tried to investigate how to
do that with the Gimp, found a tutorial somewhere, started reading, and by
Step 17 I was like, eh, I don't think so. I ain't that much of a graphics
dude.

As for the coolness factor, we all know that's vitally important,
especially for desperately insecure adolescents like me who wanna be like
the cool kids.

Thanks again,

I owned nothing but PCs until I bought my 15" PowerBook (titanium 
edition, dual hinge) in 2002.  After years of Apple propaganda hoisted 
at me by my brother and the emergence of OS X, the switch was on.  I 
have never been so pleased with a computer.

I should note that I did have some problems with OS X when it first 
came out, but ever since the 10.1 series, it's bee perfect, not one 
kernal panic (core dump) in two years.  (I am running 10.2.8 right now 
and will leapfrog 10.3 for 10.4 which is not out yet:  
http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/ )

I also had a hardware problem.  I have the dual hinge model which isn't 
on the market any longer.  The hinge ceased up as I was opening the lid 
and tore titanium lid pretty bad.  I have Apple Care, so I took it down 
to the SOHO store and they boxed it up and shipped it out for repair 
after a cursory glance a raised eyebrow of accomplishment.  The laptop 
was delivered to my apartment 4 business days later.  Before they took 
it in for repair, I also had them note that some of the paint around 
the edges was pealing (due to the excessive heat the thing produces) 
and that the battery life was diminishing.  They replaced *everything* 
and it looked like I had a new machine if it weren't for the well worn 
keypad!  I noticed that in the new models they've address the hinge 
problem by going to a study single hinge design and the change 
materials to a high grade aluminum which has absolutely not give at 
all.  (The titanium ones bend a bit.)

I installed PHP and mySQL packages from Marc Liyanage's web site (a 
well loved man in the OS X LAMP world.)

iPhoto will handle your photos and red-eye and minor editing.
I think everything else has been said. My god this should be an apple 
commercial.

I would go for the ibook and save a grand unless you are producing your 
own movies on it.

Good Luck

Wendy's Drive-up Order System Information Disclosure

Reporter: mi2g (http://www.mi2g.com/)
Date: July 07, 2004
Severity: Medium to High
Attack Class: Physical, Remote, Race Condition
Vendor: Wendy's (http://www.wendys.com/)


I. BACKGROUND

Wendy's International, Inc. is one of the world's largest restaurant
operating and franchising companies with more than 9,300 total restaurants
and quality brands - Wendy's Old Fashioned HamburgersR, Tim HortonsR and
Baja FreshR Mexican Grill. The Company invested in two additional quality
brands during 2002 - Cafe ExpressT and Pasta PomodoroR.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of the Wendy's Drive-up ordering system allows an
attacker to gain sensitive information about the order of arbitrary
customers.

During customer/vendor "handshake", the customer vehicle must come to
a stop
beside the vendor menu ordering system which contains a large screen to
display the current order.
During this process, adequate protection is not given to the space between
the vehicle and the menu allowing for a number of remote attackers to
obtain
sensitive order information.

Once the victim has finished ordering, the information stays available on
the screen for up to several minutes or until another customer has pulled
forward. This creates a great window for exploitation and increases the
chance of winning the "race condition".

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated remote malicious arbitrary
attackers to retrieve the contents of the previous customer's food order
which is a serious breach of confidentiality.

As proof of concept, this attack was carried out against mi2g CEO DK
Matai.
It was disclosed that he ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, large
fries and
a large Coca-Cola.

IV. DETECTION

mi2g has confirmed that all Wendy's with a Drive-up menu display are
affected. Other vendors may be affected but were not tested.

V. WORKAROUND

Use a hard object such as a rock or baseball bat to disable the order
display screen after the late night drive-thru has closed.

VI. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name
CAN-2004-2934 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE
list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for security
problems.

VII. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE

07/07/02   Exploit discovered by mi2g
07/08/02   mi2g clients (the "Inner Sanctum") notified
01/08/03   The Queen notified

VIII. CREDIT

discovering
this vulnerability.

XSS issues!

Message-ID: <757B959D-D014-11D8-9DD0-0003930D07F2@email.smith.edu>

Greetings, few questions here:

1.  I was wondering what the address is for the photo galleries that 
have been created on the nyphp site.  I don't have the URL around 
anymore and it doesn't appear that one can navigate to those pages via 
the public links.

2.  I'm planning on doing an install of a php photo gallery package 
today and another install in the near future.  Any recommendations or 
feedback on the various packages would be greatly appreciated.  I am 
thinking that something using a database for the back-end and css for 
formatting would be desirable.

Thanks,

-Aaron

Unisys's last patent on compressing gifs expires today, expect to see 
gif support in the GD library soon. According to
http://www.boutell.com/gd/faq.html
Thomas Boutell says he'll get on it soon, but not immediately. It 
should trickle down into the bundled package soon after that (if not 
before).

But wait... according to /. (& how could they be wrong?) IBM has a 
patent as well... (two patents on the same algorithm?)

  You could try to get to the bottom of all this, or you could just give 
up and use the vastly superior png format.

Agreed that png is better, but sadly not as well supported (or else I'm
not doing something right).

I can't seem to get a transparent png to be transparent in IE. Of
course, it's fine in Mozilla.

I've only ever worked with http://gallery.sf.net but I think it's
generally well accepted.

Bad language, nothing wrong with IE is ever your fault. Transparent 
pngs aren't supported by IE, that's IE's fault.

I thought IE supported fully transparent layers on PNGs with some
success, it just failed over poorly on anything with more than one
level of alpha transparency?

yet another reason on the huge heap of reasons that people shouldn't be
using that browser.
png's should be a standard and would be if MS actually supported them on
any level..

Firefox is 'the' browser currently.

and firefox has a sense of humor:

Estemmed list memebers,

I need your help.  Once again I have been toosed into the deep end of an issue that is new to me.  WHile I enjoy learning new things... and explaining things to others is a great way to understand it yourself ... I need to turn to my professional brethren (and sistern?) to fill in the gaps.

A property law firm I support has been approached by one of their professional organizations to buy into PGP's Desktop software to encrypt emails.  Certain lending institutions (e.g.:Wells Fargo)are starting to require encrypted email correspondence.

However, the PGP Desktop solution (formerly PGP Enterprise) seems a wee bit expensive.  Are there any other solutions out there?  Do we HAVE to have the same solution as our clients?

I've gotten a Thawte certificate this week, although Thawte says "Thawte no longer offers nor supports PGP Keys."

I want to do right by my client... AND learn about the email encryption options for my own use.


Can anyone give me some feedback?



The email I received (with many question marks after it) is below.  The organization's names have been changed (e.g: FOOBAR) to protect their privacy:

 

In light of recent notification from Wells Fargo to encrypt email communications, and the anticipated need at some future time for secure transmissions between FOO Members and some of their financial service clients, the FOOBAR Network has established a relationship with a security software company - PGP Corporation. As you may or may not be aware, PGP Corporation has relationships with many of the well-known financial services companies. FOOBAR has reached an agreement with PGP Corporation to allow FOOBAR  to purchase PGP Desktop software at a discount: 25% off the retail price. This discount is available through FOOBAR directly, as they are acting as a reseller.

I have an idea:
1. Find a patch to make IE correctly display .PNG's
2. Add code on your website that takes advantage of one of IE's security 
holes to install that patch on visitors' browsers.
3. Voila! Now your users can see your graphics correctly.

Turn that bug into a feature!

(Note: I originally meant this humorously, but now I am really curious 
as to whether it could be done.)

It is ridiculously easy to make activex controls to install in browsers.
I hopped into windows and fired up delphi6 and made one (for fun) that
replaces any instance (in any webpage, replaced before IE parses) of the
word "Yahoo" with the word "shit".. Then surfed around looking at "shit
mail" and "shit autos" was funny but was really a test for doing ones
that replace graphics such as 468x60 with whatever I want, or finding
amazon.com referral codes and replacing them with mine etc.

I.E is a minefield for easy hacks like these.

(as a side note, I didn't do anything with that code, but did consider
selling it..)

That is, of course, given the typical Joe User's understanding of 
ActiveX.  Do you truly think that Soccer Mom and Factory Worker Dad is 
an ActiveX hack and/or has knowledge of or access to Delphi6?

I hate to say this, sometimes, we coders live in a world very far 
removed from the rest of the known universe, the universe of "typical 
people" that wouldn't know such hacks and would then not feel the need 
to do so when surfing on Ebay for a 6-pack of beer.

Just a thought.

Hi:

There's a free drop in alternative for PGP called GPG (GNU Privacy Guard),
found at http://www.gnupg.org/.

Since you're talking about using this for email, check the "MUA Frontend"
(mail user agent) section of the "Related Software" | "Frontend" page
http://www.gnupg.org/(en)/related_software/frontends.html#mua .  There are
even plugins for Outlook.

This is very true, I should have prefaced that with "for a coder with
any experience..." which effectively knocks out 99.9% of the population.
I would like to that that people would be interested in programming, but
reality is that is like cars, a lot of people talk the talk, but still
take their cars into the shop to get the oil changed.

So yea, that was an ivory tower comment...

Tell me about it.  The "IT" "staff" at my girlfriend's job didn't secure 
her machine properly.  It got exploited and started popping up porn.  I 
told her to go search Google for "spybot."  Well, guess what.  The exploit 
changed the results to put some other piece of software in the number one 
spot, which I suspect was a trojan.  To confirm, I did the same search and 
got the expected results.  While this can be explained by Google altering 
results for different browsers/IP's/etc, I doubt it.

...and speaking of setting up an AMP development environment on a Mac,

Well, actually the user needs to click (which is any activex) and it can
be embedded in a form for "winning a 52 inch plasma TV or whatever"
etc.. I have a search site that gets 50,000 hits/day (mostly i.e.) the
numbers there just on users who hit okay just by accident would make it
worth it.. And yea, it could find any of those codes using regex
replace.

Just wondering how much that would actually be worth..

Actually, eBay only allows sales of 6-packs when they're deemed
"collectibles." Otherwise, there's all sorts of government regulation
about the sale of alcohol over the Internet and across state lines.

AMP is very well supported on MacOS X - there are nice installers here:

The other nice thing is Fink (fink.sourceforge.net) - basically this 
gives you Linux-like apt-get package system for OS X.

Which reminds me of one I heard about the 2000 World Series tickets being
resold on eBay. When sellers were told that was against policy, they
(reportedly) said "OK, then make it a baseball cap. Price: $5000. Comes
with 2 complimentary World Series tickets." Call that a "collectible"
baseball cap and you've got yourself a theory... sort of.

Hello,

I have code that loops through the database and outputs something like the
following:


TEAM 1

Year 1    Year 2     Year 3

8         9          22

TEAM 2

Year 1     Year 2     Year 3

18         94         12

TEAM 3

Year 1     Year 2     Year 3

23         44         45

ALL TEAMS

Year 1     Year 2     Year 3

??         ??         ??


I can't figure out how to easily get the ?? totals. I think I want a major
array of three minor arrays (I probably just invented my own vocabulary):
the major array would increment by one each year; the three minor arrays
would hold the Year 1 values, Year 2 values, and Year 3 values.
Conceptually, it would be something like $all_teams[$year_id][ ]. Is
something like that possible? I know that php allows multidimensional
arrays, but I guess I don't know the proper syntax or usage.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Harvey

PNG-8 with transparency index (a la GIF) is fine.
PNG-24 with alpha channel displays background color instead of transparency.

MS decided to drag their feet on full PNG support until after they wiped out
their browser unit. Oh well, the world doesn't need transparency.

Took a minute and looked over the specs for firefox/mozilla extensions,
it would also be easy for a js/xul programmer to add in similar
functionality for those browsers, though would require installing an

You missed it.  I said "

when surfing on Ebay for a 6-pack of beer.
"

Notice the phrase "when surfing on Ebay for...".  Again, Joe User's world wouldn't necessarily know about the government regulations on anything (except to complain more than likely that there are too many w/o any sort of concrete recollection as to what they are or apply to what/when/where/why/how much)

Ok, this is becoming tangential to the point of absurdity! AUGH! I need a Belgian Pale Ale or a Jever!

well, in either of these instances you are bound to have a *LOT* of
upset webmasters. It is already a huge problem for IE users, kazaa and
some of the other programs install(ed ??) spyware to rewrite amazon and
other affiliate url's ..
There was a big stink over that a while back.

Well Harvey, assuming you defined something like

$all_teams['Team 1'][2002] = 8;
$all_teams['Team 1'][2003] = 9;
$all_teams['Team 1'][2004] = 22;

$all_teams['Team 2'][2002] = 18;
$all_teams['Team 2'][2003] = 94;
$all_teams['Team 2'][2004] = 12;

$all_teams['Team 3'][2002] = 23;
$all_teams['Team 3'][2003] = 44;
$all_teams['Team 3'][2004] = 45;

The code

foreach ($all_teams as $team)
	foreach ($team as $year => $score)
		$all_teams['sum'][$year] += $score ;

would give you a brute force calculation of what you're looking for, 
use a

print_r($all_teams)

to get the hang of it. Note also that

array_sum($all_teams['Team 1']);

would give you the sum of 'Team 1' across all three years. Experiment  
with

$all_teams[2002]['Team 1'] = 8;
$all_teams[2002]['Team 2'] = 18;
$all_teams[2002]['Team 3'] = 23;

$all_teams[2003]['Team 1'] = 9;
$all_teams[2003]['Team 2'] = 94;
$all_teams[2003]['Team 3'] = 44;

$all_teams[2004]['Team 1'] = 22;
$all_teams[2004]['Team 2'] = 12;
$all_teams[2004]['Team 3'] = 45;

run a few more print_r's and you'll be well on your way to getting the 
hang of multidimensional arrays. And don't forget

http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php
and
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php

Without giving this too much thought, _perhaps_

Thanks, but it's not the sum part that I'm having problems with (I don't
think). It's creating the multidimensional array. I get the sums fine for
normal arrays. Thanks again.

Pseudo code...  PLEASE extrapolate the concept here to fit your actual 
needs.

while ($row = fetchrow($result)) {
    echo $row['year'] . ' ' . $row['score'];
    $total[$row['year']] += $row['score'];
}

Then, to get the totals:

foreach ($total as $year => $val) {
   echo "$year = $val";
}

Thanks, Daniel. Your previous post got me where I needed to go. The key was
the note below. I actually had something like that in my code, but it didn't
work. I thought it was because you couldn't do [ ][ ][ ]. (I just guessed
that the syntax would be like that; didn't know that it really was the
syntax). I think the problem was the ' ' marks. I took them out, and all
works fine now. Thanks to everyone with suggestions...

I have used a mac for the past 4 years, but went to pc solely on my
limited budget from my son and I needed better hardware to play the
newer games, like the World of Warcraft beta, which would need a 1ghz
g4, and I only had a 733.

Apache is built-in to os x - and the entropy site that is linked in
this thread is what I used to update php and also mysql. PHP is built
in, but it most likely isnt the most recent build, unless they just
updated it in a software-update combined with other things.

I had a fully-fledged email server running using sendmail, and web
server using amp. The aliases on the mail server are great, because
you can just create them using their built-in administration tools.

I like the built-in iApps, iPhoto, iChat, iTunes (Which I now use on
pc) - one of the reasons that I went to one.

I used bbedit or dreamweaver mx, but bbedit had better FTP
compatibility, which I loved. It was fast, so you could open right off
of the ftp server within a few seconds, and it kept the connection
alive in the background. Saving was instantaneous.

The only problem that I saw with using the mac was their built-in ssh
client, and when I went into VIM, the home/end/etc keys did not work,
since they had different ascii codes bound to them, but that was
something that I probabally could have fixed.

All in all - I prefer the mac, but I have to settle with a pc for my
cost - 500 bucks for a dell p4 3.06ghz on a 2 day special? Couldn't
pass that up... but I will wait to buy an apple again until they come
out with powerbooks running G5's with a true 64bit OS, instead of the
64bit wrapper on OS X like they have now.

 Database reports for a national organization with a number of different
 local offices, each of which runs workshops with a sponsoring organization,
 speaker, and attendees. The orgs, speakers, and attendees all have certain
 characteristics also. So I'm trying to create a database input and
reporting
 system that allows the group to easily input and view all different combos
 of the info above.

I use Thunderbird and Enigmail (the GPG extension). It works well. You 
might want to
verify the compatibility of GPG with PGP Desktop 8.x   I had an issue 
with incomptibility
between GPG and PGP's Universal Server (encryption proxy appliance).

Read up on stuff at http://forums.pgpsupport.com/

If you can get away with SMIME key's, Thawte's free email certs are easy 
to use.

Hash: SHA1

Thunderbird/Enigmail/GPG *was* my approach but I found that
a) thunderbird did crash a few times where i had set plain text display
only + there was a large html based email
b) the junk option was not really working too well

Then (just to learn more) I went to
fetchmail -> procmail -> (clamav -> spamassasin) -> mutt

This option is so high tech that I lost half my vision editing the
config files.

But despite all the stuff that is out there alot of people still dont
sign/encrypt there email, I use it mainly for emailing passwords around.

I do however like the PGPDisk option that does come w/ PGPDesktop
software, this allows you to create + mount a virtual encrypted "drive"
for storage, have not found a decent option like that for Linux without
gpg encrypting entire files but im sure there is an easier way.

However I must say if *I* was a lawyer and my client wanted email
confidentiality Im sure the softwares purpose will pay for itself over
time and will be worth it due to its Windows friendly nature.

You could try to leave this to MySQL (or whatever SQL server you have):

SELECT team, SUM(year1), SUM(year2), SUM(year3)
    FROM `tablename`
    [WHERE where_conditions_if_any ]
    GROU BY team
    [ORDER BY order_clauses_if_any ]

If you can give me a detailed description of the table(s) I can write the
query corectly.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mysqldump and foreign keys on InnoDB tables
Message-ID: <1089387018.40eeba0a8c355@webmail.tuffmail.net>

As a mysql user from way back, I don't generally hold with all this fancy
FOREIGN KEY stuff. But recently I've has occasion to work on tables that are
heavily keyed to each other, and I've run into a nasty problem when trying to
backup and restore the database using mysqldump --opt 

Despite the fact that the sql file wraps all the inserts in *!40000 ALTER TABLE
tablename DISABLE KEYS */; the inserts are failing on foreign key checks.

I'm using Mysql 4.0.15a ...

Is this expected behavior? Seems to me that if the foreign key indexes aren't
being created until after everything is inserted, the inserts should succeed no
matter what, especially as mysqldump --opt is advertised as the best/fastest
way to backup and restore a database.

   chris.

Well:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Backing_up.html

And, when working with InnoDB, see the 8th bullet (AUTOCOMMIT):

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/InnoDB_tuning.html

LOAD DATA INFILE and SELECT INTO OUTFILE are also nice.

At the top of the link it mentions the backup product, but the rest of
the page describes how to do much of it manually.  You can do it all
with the tools included with MySQL, except for the true hot backup,
since it's an engine level thing (and specific to InnoDB).

Message-ID: <20040709195957.24028.qmail@web50203.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all!

What to do in the following situation?

while working with a database result set that I need
to use more than once. But I don't need the same
number of record each time. Should I get the whole
thing in an array or live it in the database result
handle and work with it.
Which one is the best practice?

If you can do some basic checking to determine the max number of
records you will need, only grab that. Beyond that, I think that the
best practice would be to get all the records you could need, then use
them as needed. If you can guarantee that you won't need the same
peice again, unset it.

A caveat: If the result set includes some huge feilds, blobs or text
feilds with tonnes of data, you may want to re-consider :).

It's not a huge resultset and I know how many I need
for the lifetime of the script.
The question is:

I don't want to make a different query each time.
But I was thinking since the resultset is already
stored in memory by the database server, isn't it a
wast of time to loop through it and store it in an
array?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Linux vs. Windows in PC Magazine August 3 Edition -
	"Smear Factor"
Message-ID: <b7.42af98d4.2e21437e@aol.com>

 
Linux vs. Windows in PC Magazine August 3 Edition -  "Smear Factor"
 
In John C. Dvorak's monthly column (8/3/04) he has written an article  
entitled "Smear Factor."  The gist of the article is that Microsoft has  basically 
started a fierce underground smear campaign against Linux.  Now I  know a bunch 
of you went no da -- where have you been?  But before you chop  my head off 
read on.  The article goes far beyond the usual anti-Linux  propaganda.  The 
article identifies past and new "developing" PR campaigns  that allow Microsoft 
to bash Linux with untruths while maintaining distance from  the negative PR.
 
Quoting from the article: "Making one of these campaigns work takes a lot  of 
resources and skill, and has to be secret too.... We may be witnessing a  
whole new way of trashing a product [Linux] -- an eclectic assault on all known  
fronts and even in the creation of new ones." This is a director quote from PC 
 Magazine (8/3/04) page 51.
 
John Dvorak outlines the newest attack against Linux - that Torvalds did  
write the OS - it is an assembly of stolen code from SCO and others.  John  
Dvorak also reports of an institute named Alexis de Tocqueville Institution  (AdTi) 
_http://www.adti.net/_ (http://www.adti.net/)   that supports this  attack -- 
prior to this attack, AdTi never consulted and worked in this  arena.  
 
On their homepage they state: "Welcome to AdTI.net, ground  zero for the 
global controversy over the hybrid-source operating  system, Linux." (ground 
zero...hmmm) The entire anti-Linux portion of the site  seems devoted to 
establishing one fact: That Torvalds did not write Linux from  scratch and all those who 
assisted may have used bits and pieces of copyrighted  software.  In my 
opinion this is one of the essential elements for SCO to  make their copyright 
infringement case.  If Torvalds and  the Linux community used some SCO code to 
speed the production of  Linux, then there may be copyright infringement (triple 
damages,  accounting for profits, etc, etc)  This is the part of the campaign 
that  establishes possible infringement that I believe Dvorak is referring to. 
  Parts of the site even call Torvalds credibility into question.  It is  
really shocking stuff.  The funny part is, this site which claims to be  ground 
zero for global controversy on Linux has articles on: Reagan, Roosevelt  
Rushmore - Gandhi's Unpower-Grab, Federal and State Savings from Internet Phone  
Calls, Federal Policy Review with Greenspan, Democracy in Iraq, etc.   Really 
weird stuff.  This is all very scary, all my websites and servers  are Linux 
based.... does this scary anyone else? 
 
Dvorak's article is really great work. I have been reading his  articles 
since I was a little kid, and is the only reason I keep buying PC  Magazine.  The 
article ends stating that Microsoft's intent is to slow the  Linux growth by 
making Corp and Individuals take a "wait and see approach"  -  while Microsoft 
keeps selling its products.  
If I had to take two things away from the article:
 
1) Linux needs to be MUCH securer than MS.  Now I have talked to so  many 
Linux admins who say Linux is far more secure.  Is it really or are we  just 
kidding ourselves because Linux hardly gets attacked.  Elsewhere in  the same 
edition, a statistic is quoted that computers are attacked by viruses,  worms, etc 
within 15 seconds of being placed on the Internet.  If Linux  wants to 
compete, we need to know we are secure.
 
2) The SCO issue is big.  It needs to be addressed.  I think a  more 
proactive stance to international and US copyright law needs to be put in  place that 
ensures the legal transfer of intellectual property to the Linux  community.
 
Lastly, in John Dvorak's weekly "Inside Track" (page 51) John outlines the  
many issues surrounding the Microsoft $2 Billion investment in Sun and its  
ramifications.  I am not going to review it but it is almost as alarming as  the 
first article.  (One quick note MS went up against Sun in a bid for  Thailand 
- Microsoft dropped there price of $500-600 MSRP US software to $40 a  copy to 
compete with Linux/Sun/Star Office.  Linux Won!  This has to  scare the ^#$& 
out of Bill.)  The gist of the article is that Sun may  be bought by Fujitsu, 
Star Office may be scrapped, and Java spun off (and if I  had to bet MS would 
buy it.)
 
I would strongly suggest people pick up these articles.  I truly  believe 
that John Dvorak is a fair man, and I think he has opened this issue for  a 
reason.  Here is the no da part - Microsoft has launched a secretive all  out 
assault against Linux.  Linux is there biggest threat - and it makes  them so 
nervous.  As a community, we need to start thinking of proactive  positive 
strategies that strengthen the computer infrastructure, continue to  make computers 
easier and far more secure for users to use, and bring back REAL  competition to 
this marketplace.  
 
The first step I will make is joining everyone on the 14th (I think) for a  
drink.  It is a start anyway.  Any other suggestions?
 
Have a great weekend. And let everyone know about these  articles.

One last thing, this month's PC Magazine has an extensive article on

Message-ID: <14741-70322@sneakemail.com>

The list seems quiet these days, and many of you have design 
associates... so I figured I'd throw this on to the community before 
looking elsewhere:

I have a small job for a photoshopper - it requires generating a 300dpi 
color scan of a postage-stamp sized graphic, and then retouching it to 
alter certain aspects of text, graphics. No real creative involved, but  
meticulous attention to detail and a love of the kind of minutia that 
satisfies a perfectionist client (me). Should be a few hours of work for 
the right person.

Recommendations appreciated, or feel free to pass along to appropriate 
individuals. Thanks.

Message-ID: <C0CDB9F5E81C234FBB42D84E7853125D013B0A41@intamail1.inta>

This question may require some help off the list, because I seem to need a
bit of spoon-feeding here.

I need to get this server running such that I can call file_get_contents
over https to a remote server. Server is running Apache2.0.48 and PHP
4.3.4(cli) and does not have mod_openssl or mod_php installed.

So the real question is, if I get mod_openssl installed in Apache, will PHP
magically register https as a stream type?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] making a manual http POST using a PHP client (USPS web
	services)
Message-ID: <40F2ACC9.6070002@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to build a PHP script that requests information from the 
United States Postal Service (USPS) using their web services interface. 
More specifically, I want to look up 9 digit zip codes for a given 
street address.

The USPS does not use a standard web services protocol such as XML-RPC 
or SOAP. If they were using XML-RPC, then I could just use the PEAR 
XML-RPC library to automatically POST the XML request to their server 
(and also to automatically decode the XML response that I receive from 
them).

The USPS has some documents on this matter, but their (less than 
abundant) code samples are restricted to Perl, ASP, and Visual Basic.

Their Perl code sample looks like this:

--------------------------------------
print "content-type: text/html\n\n";

print $htmlBegin;

$ua = new LWP::UserAgent;

$req = new HTTP::Request 'POST', 'http://SERVERNAME/ShippingAPI.dll';

$req->content_type('application/x-www-form-urlencoded');

$req->content('API=Rate&XML=' . $rateReqDoc->toString);

$response = $ua->request($req);

if ($response->is_success) {

     $resp = $response->content;

} else {

     print "<p>There was an error processing your request</p>\n";

     print $htmlEnd;

     exit 0;

}
---------------------------------------------

I have not really used Perl before, but the first time I looked at this 
code, I thought it looked a lot like PHP. Here's what I think is happening:

The Perl script manually opening an HTTP connection and posting a chunk 
of XML encoded text to server using the "LWP::UserAgent" and 
"HTTP::Request" things.

So my question is: which function (or objects) should I use in PHP to do 
something. I know, this is kind of a stupid question - I should probably 
know how to do this, but until now I just let the web services libraries 
do this "dirty work" for me.

On a related note, I was wondering if anyone knows of open source PHP 
code that does what I would like to do.

Thanks in advance.

Best Regards,

- Jay

I have grown to greatly distrust CURL.  It's too simple a solution and I 
don't believe it fully works.  I built a Timer class object based upon 
Curl (using 7.10) for PHP 4.3.2 and it works on all remote URLs except 
for those that are $_COOKIE or $_SESSION-dependent.  In those cases the 
remote url returns incorrect information simply because the remote 
$_COOKIE is not there.

I am thinking the best solution is XML-RPC or SOAP, but for a simple 
page-download-timing scrape, it's way overkill!

If it's not that big of a resultset, it might make more sense to just
fetch it all into an array and walk through the array as needed.

There lies the issue - the resultset isn't stored by the database.  What
you really want is a cursor.  However, I assume we're talking about
MySQL, in which case there are no cursors (they're coming in MySQL 5.0).

You might find some value in these functions:

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-unbuffered-query.php
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-data-seek.php

Depending on the approach you want to take.

We use CURL to talk to UPS and FedEx API's on a regular basis.  Our
FedEx library is open source and available for download:

http://freshmeat.net/redir/fedexdc/42837/url_tgz/fedexdc.tar.gz  


It looks like same technique could be used for USPS:
http://www.usps.com/webtools/welcome.htm


BTW: If you don't like the CURL library, I think you could try compiling
PHP with OpenSSL (so you can go over https) and use the fopen() function
(http://us4.php.net/function.fopen) or PEAR::HTTP module 
(http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.http.php).

Yes, you can definitely also go with streams here in both PHP 4.3 and
PHP 5.

PHP 5, in particular, has http_build_query(), which simplifies the
task of constructing and urlencoding the query string. Then you can
use file_get_contents() to suck the whole file in a single gulp.

Shameless plug: there an example of this in "Upgrading to PHP 5,"
available from Amazon and finer bookstores later this month. (It
should be out in time for OSCON.)

Message-ID: <40F2C0B4.4090701@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

Thanks for all of your replies and help. Before I read your replies, I 
tried to send this message (at first with  code sample attachments).  
Thanks very much to drydell for porting the code snippet I posted from 
Perl to PHP and for the others who recommended Curl and the other open 
source Fedex code. I have now made available all the relevant code that 
I found (and other bits posted to this list)  at my website ( 
http://www.ceruleansky.com/code/usps_php/ ) . I can also make a 
sourceforge project with the new code I come up with, since this seems 
to be of interest to others.

Here is an edited copy of the email I wanted to send:
 
I think I just found some sample PHP code which works with the USPS's 
web services interface. It is part of the OsCommerce ( 
www.oscommerce.com ) shipping module. I thought I would share this code 
with all of you, since it might be useful to others.

It calls a different remote (USPS) function to do determine shipping 
costs for a package of a certain weight; thus, it does something 
different than what I wanted to do (look up the zip code for an address) 
- but still, the methodology of making the XML request and receiving the 
XML response is the same.

The method from OsCommerce (along with other relevant code) is available 
for others' reference (it can be found in 
root/catalog/includes/modules/shipping/usps.php) at:

http://www.ceruleansky.com/code/usps_php/

Here is (part of) the answer to my earlier question, though (it is a 
snippet from the usps module of osCommerce):
------
$http = new httpClient();
     if ($http->Connect($usps_server, 80)) {
       $http->addHeader('Host', $usps_server);
       $http->addHeader('User-Agent', 'osCommerce');
       $http->addHeader('Connection', 'Close');

       if ($http->Get('/' . $api_dll . '?' . $request)) $body = 
$http->getBody();

       $http->Disconnect();
     } else {
       return false;
     }
-----
(Oddly enough, the code above seems to be making a GET request).

The httpClient object is something unique to to osCommerce, and is found 
in root/catalog/includes/classes/httpclient.php. Other options to do the 
same thing are the PEAR library at 
http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Client , or something like Simon 
Willison's httpClient() library found at: 
http://scripts.incutio.com/httpclient/index.php

If the PHP code  that I come up with to look up zip codes from an 
address (using USPS web services) is of interest to others, I could make 
a project for it at sourceforge.net.

Best Regards,

- Jay

Actually, this is false. Check out my last message about streams. You
need to use a stream context to override the default method from GET
to POST and to set the body, but it'll work.

It's just not well documented. Here's a code snippet from "Upgrading

This should make a POST request for you and it's a little nicer than
having to do all that fsockopen stuff because you don't need to handle
all the details of negotiating the connection. It'll also work with
https requests if you're installed OpenSSL.

Nothing, but it isn't a true cursor.

A database cursor (at least in common terms) is where the result set is
stored on the server and client side API calls can operate on it
completely - generally known as scrollable cursors.  mysql_data_seek()
works on the results after they've been stored on the client side as a
result of using mysql_query().

mysql_unbuffered_query() approaches cursors, but isn't really a cursor,
and doesn't provide much of the niceness of cursors (scrolling, multiple
results, lower network usage, etc).  Thus, in the documentation, it says
mysql_data_seek(), among other functions, can't be used after an
unbuffered query (because nothing is stored on the client side
initially).

Depends on what version of PHP... in PHP 4, which is the version I'm

Yeah, but sockets are cool.  And yes, streams are very cool, but unless
I'm writing in PHP 5, I wouldn't make extensive use of them in my code.
Especially since file_get_contents() doesn't support contexts until 5,
per the above example.

Ok, since it is stored on the client and using
mysql_data_seek I can scroll through it back and
forth, isn't it better to just keep it where it is and
work with it?

Hi folks.

Here is the situation, I have 20 folders, each folder has 10 various images
in it. I'd like to build
a web page and directories for each image like so:

/people/john.php  ( containing johns picture and some php/html design
includes )

is there a simple/fast way to do this?

ultimately I'd like to have a compelte page built, with <title><keyword> and
some other helpful tags. One thing to keep in mind, I cannot use a mySQL db
in this case.. has to be some type of php scripting without DB use.

any tutorials? or code snippets avail?

tia

My limited php/mySQl is why i'd prefer not to use it, not due to its

The anal side to my personality requires me to mention that this code
will fail if your directory contains a file named "0" (zero). (Hey!
It's a valid filename.)

A more robust check is:

while (($FileName = readdir($DirHandle) !== false)) {

Alternatively, if you're using PHP 5, check out the DirectoryIterator
class from SPL.

You're right. You can probably do most of it inside 4.3.x, but you may
need to fopen() and fread() the data.

This begs the question "Does file_get_contents in PHP 4.3.x have an upper
limit to the size of the return data?" IE, if you do:

$string =
file_get_contents("https://www.someserver.com/path/page.php?query=str"); 

will "str_len($string)" max out at some multiple of 4096?

..don't forget I'm talking PHP 4.3.x

AFAIK, there's no limit to file_get_contents() beyond the usual limits
for strings in PHP. However, that doesn't mean I'd use it to request a
100 Mb file because it needs to store the whole string in memory.

Hey folks,

I'm looking for examples of "more advanced" page controls that people have 
developed to represent one to many and/or many to many DB relationships on a 
web page, using PHP, JS and CSS.  The purpose of these controls is to 
allow uses to execute "mass" actions on data, such as deleting a group of 
records at once, or reassigning several records to a different category.  
Any thoughts, suggestions and examples would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

Wondering if anyone has used the SOAP extensions found in PHP5 or the

We are seeing if there are suitable PHP libraries or if we should go
with perl (i.e. SOAP::Lite).

IIRC, the PHP 5 version of PEAR SOAP supports
attachments. Unfortunately, my copy of "Essential PHP Tools" by David Sklar
is packed in 1 of 20 book boxes that have just arrived at my SF
apartment. It's by far the best documentation of the PEAR SOAP
extension I've ever seen. (Even if it is a little overwhelming, it
covers more topics than any place else.)

I don't know about ext/soap, but I'd be interested in finding out. I
am trying to get the eBay WSDL to work with ext/soap, but I'm having
problems.

In our March presentation (http://nyphp.org/content/presentations/ and
http://nyphp.org/content/presentations/paxi/) we talked just about this
topic.

At the end of the day, we decided not to go with PEAR for a couple of
key reasons:

-- speed; the overhead of PEAR coupled with the large amounts of data we
needed to frequently deal with, was prohibitive.  We got slammed with
quite a bit of traffic.

-- at the time, nothing supported *receiving* attachments (this could
have change since we did the project in Jan).  PEAR could create a SOAP
request with attachments, but couldn't parse it out.

In the end, we used pMIME which I had written for general MIME parsing,
which is all SOAP is.

maybe, but the name SOAP (rhymes with NOPE) is far more brandable than 
"pee myme"   ;-)

It's tough to do a trademark symbol when you're only using ASCII. :)

Besides, I did preface the paragraph with "shameless plug" and I ended
up posting the code in my next message.

But... sockets *are* streams. ?!?

I use fsockopen because you can set timeouts, both for the initial 
connect and for data on the wire. file_get_contents() is great until the 
other guy's site goes down.

Right... and a "tomato" is the same as a "tomatoe"...

That's a question that can be answered 100 different ways depending on
who you ask:   BSD vs ATT vs Windows vs TCP vs UDP vs PHP vs C vs Kernel
land vs User land.... they are some overused terms to put it frankly.

Anyway, in PHP they are quite similar.  What "streams" are now in late
PHP 4 and PHP 5, was a rewrite/extension of the original socket/stream
niceness of earlier PHP versions.

So what does this really mean?  Today's streams are enhanced sockets...
but with a twist.  Generally a socket is considered related to network
or intra-process connectivity somehow.  Streams, in PHP anyway, can also
be used for disk-based "communication".  So a PHP stream is extremely
powerful, and can be used for essentially any type of communication, and
in fact, the line between network and disk communication becomes blurred
in PHP.  Thus, there is a single API that allows almost transparent
communication, regardless of whether it's going out on a network wire,
or a disk-controller wire.

Yes, but this is where PHP streams come in, and especially in PHP 5.  In
5, the full power of filters/contexts/wrappers/etc is available, which
allows you to control timeouts and so forth in powerful and dynamic new
ways.

And there's http://php.net/stream_set_timeout which is even available in
4, and the only way to AFAIK in 5 to change the timeout of a "socket".

So yeah, sockets and streams are the same  :)

Yes, pMIME needs a new image  :)

By the way, if anyone wants the code, a practically perfect copy is at:

http://cvs.nyphp.org/cvsweb.cgi/pmail/

I say practically because I never finished the parseField() method

On June 30th, New York PHP announced
(http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/announce/2004-June/000106.html) that
the NYPHP Charter had been revised to prevent the use of the NYPHP
mailing lists "to promote any commercial activities unless that posting
has received prior board approval."

Although we're all supportive of PHP's growth, success and adoption, we
want to be sure NYPHP-Talk isn't subjected to unsolicited commercial
mailings, and in keeping with its history of high technical content and
community support.

This message has been reviewed and determined that it violates that
prohibition.  Since, however, this is the first violation of a new
policy which may have been incompletely understood or even overlooked by
users of NYPHP-Talk, I am taking this opportunity to simply publicize
the policy further.

I do urge everyone to review http://nyphp.org/charter and specifically
the section "Appropriate Use of Mailing Lists".

The proper way to handle posting this information would have been to use
the form at http://nyphp.org/contact.php to ask the Board whether the
posting would be permitted.  Please follow this procedure whenever you
are contemplating submitting a post with this kind of commercial slant.


Thank you everyone.

Sorry for bringing this back but I still don't
understand this "SCALABILITY" thing. The more I read
you guyz, the more I get confused about the whole
thing.

Can someone give me a more "IDIOT PROOF" explanation?

What don't you get about it precisely?

Chris' statement had a bunch of fluff to it, but his basic argument (or 
at least my paraphrase of it) is that stateless applications have 
infinite horizontal scalability since they persist no data from request 
to request.

Of course this ignores the point that you often have to persist data 
from request to request, which is why I find that general argument to 
be a bit fluffy.  Many (most?) applications need both some 
intra-session inter-request data  persistence as well as inter-session 
data persistance.  Simply saying 'its someone else's reponsibility' 
(mysql or whatever) is a cop-out, because you still need your whole 
application to run.  It's like saying that my car can do 400 mph, it 
just needs the right engine.

I don't thing it's someone else's responsibility. 
I should be able to change my engine without changing
my car.

The modularity of the system is completely orthogonal to the point.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP-related book comments
Message-ID: <40F4328D.4010600@att.net>

In preparation to writing two security courses -- a security survey and 
a security tools course, the usual suspects of the latest reference 
books were purchased, as well as knoppix STD.   btw, my area of 
expertise has primarily been in LAN/WAN networking, TCP/IP and routing 
protocols, and forensics.  One book that I hadn't seen before is 
"Exploiting Software: How to Break Code" by Greg Hoglund and Gary 
McGraw.  Overall, it's not a bad book for the most part.   It was 
published Feb. 2004.
One small section that I took issue with and am about to write the 
authors about is their characterization of PHP.  I quote:

from page 190:
"In many cases, software may come preset with various parameters set by 
default. In many cases, the default values are set with no regard for 
security..."  The authors go on to mention PHP global variables and 
characterizes PHP as "In seriously broken languages like PHP, a number 
of default configurations are poorly set."

First, the authors apparently don't know anything about PHP 4.2.0 which, 
I believe, was released over 2 years ago.  Ironically, their next 
paragraph begins with "In the interest of convenience (laziness?), some 
programmers..." 

Seems the authors were too lazy to check their facts.  It makes me 
wonder if they've even bothered to research their subject to find a file 
called php.ini-recommended.

Further down the page is this paragraph:
"PHP is a study in bad security."    I believe that if the authors had 
said something like "phpBB is a study in bad security"  they might have 
stated the problem correctly.

So, before I send an email to these guys, is there anything else I 
should point out?

They seem to be aware that the problem is not inherent to the language, 
but with lazy programmers.  How unfortunate that they then single out 
PHP as an insecure language, without looking at recent efforts to 
provide better security.

That is hitting the proverbial nail right on the head.  There are a slew 
of PHP applications out there that commit grievous crimes regarding 
security.  Unfortunately, the PHP language is being singled out by 
non-PHP programmers that don't take the time to learn the language.  
They see the letters 'php' on bugtraq and immediately reach for 
pitchforks without attempting to get an understanding of what is really 
going on.

I don't know a more secure scripting language than python - but other 
than that I can write shoddy code in just about any language you want.  
It is not only a disservice to the people that put so much effort into 
creating a language and give it away for free, but to anyone who is 
considering using that language in the future.  This sadly sounds like a 
perl/c programmer's typical and monotonous language-specific troll.

I thought that's what scalability means. Being able
adapt to change.

Hah hah.. George I think he was asking for simpler... and besides it is 
not possible to be orthogonal to a point... you need a plane ;-)

Anyways by my read Chris was offloading responsibility for his blog not 
"sclaing well" or (not serving his pages well as the demand increased), 
because serving the pages is a job of his web host's servers. They 
obviously weren't configured to "scale well" with respect to Chris' 
blog, but that is not a function of Chris pages (which he tells are not 
even PHP - they are prepared static "images" of his pages).

So now that we understand Chris' site going down has no relation to his 
comments about the scalability of PHP. What about those comments?

PHP is a scripting engine -- it runs code. If the PHP engine is asked to 
run alot of code, does it perform about as well as it did when it was 
asked to run a little code? Herein lies the problem.. is the "quantity" 
of code a matter of server requests or complexity of script? Hard to 
say. Perhaps Chris refers to complexity of code, such that code 
fragments are re-used (functions, modules, objects, libraries, 
whatever). Does PHP lend itself to neat and efficient organization of 
those "fragments" such that as programs get complex, they stay organized 
well enough for the rest of the components (server, Apache, cache, etc) 
to continue to perform well? What about shared memory, as in variables? 
As they are shared, does performance continue at similar levels or does 
the system slow down with increased shared demand?

Hard to say if these aspects are of ultimate importance.... but 
certainly they are all part of the picture, no?

So perhaps the argument of "scalability of PHP" is best addressed 
through empirical examples.... if it is being successfully deployed in 
scaled applications by happy customers. or perhaps even "evangelically 
happy(TM)" customers, then can we say it is scalable.. or perhaps we can 
simply say scalability doesn't seem to be an issue?

It is obvious that the BASIC computer language did not scale well. It is 
obvious that the COBOL computer language did scale well. It is obvious 
that Windows does not scale well, when compared to Linux. It is obvious 
that MS Access does not scale well, especialy when compared to any other 
database on the face of the earth. It seems Chris was driven to comment 
on the fact that someone who needed an application that could scale well 
had abandoned one tchnology (based on empirical judgement) and adopted a 
PHP solution. perhaps highlioghting the adoption and success is the most 
important thing that can be done to make an argument for the 
"scalability" of PHP.

I wouldn't say that PHP is broken in regards to security. Global 
variables (or register_globals) are not in themselves security holes. 
They do allow sloppy programmers to more easily write code that is 
exploitable though. That's not a language problem, it's a programmer 
problem. I don't think it should be the responsibility of the scripting 
language to save us from ourselves. Input validation should be performed 
regardless what system is employed. For me, the speed and simplicity of 
programming in PHP far outweighs the alleged "security issues" people 
claim to exist. If you design the system smart and write clean secure 
code, your apps should run as well if not better than with  any other 
scripting language.

I like how he apparently confuses "software" by then giving a
programming language as an example.  Outlook is software that comes with
various parameters set by default with no regard for security - PHP
isn't.

But I know what he's getting at, and he's right... register_globals (as
we all know :) was a bad idea.  True, it's still possible to write
secure code with it on, but by having it enabled, a world of
inexperienced people could throw sloppy code together and have it
magically "work."

In fact, PHP has had several of these bad ideas (directives with the
word "magic" in them come to mind).

But security is really dependant on the programmer or user - I *always*
turn the default settings off in Outlook.  And, I *always* use
php.ini-recommended (which the PHP group has made available for years,
for this exact reason).

Well, I guess I should have read your message a little further :)  I
agree 100% - I doubt they did.  Or, they looked at it 3 years ago, and
assumed nothing changed before writing the book 3 years later.

I think it's basically that PHP the language has actually had very few
problems over its lifetime.  In fact, it's up to the programmer to
ensure his application is secure - not the programming language.

Is C insecure because you can write over memory?

Is Assembly insecure because I can make your IDE controller do evil
things?

Is C++ insecure because Windows has loads of holes (5 new today)?

Is PHP insecure because it makes it easy for people to write
applications?

Blame Rasmus. AFAIK, all (almost all?) of those directives date back
to PHP/FI days.

But it's unfair to project back 2004 (or even 2001) realities upon
1996.

Different sets of programmers used PHP back then, the Web was a
very different place, and PHP was just a quick and dirty language for
guest books, hit counters, and e-mailing forms.

Yeah, but that change is generally an increase in requests/second and
that problem is generally getting more and more users on your website.

Scalability or the ability to scale can mean many different things.  In
the web world, it generally reflects the ability of an application to
take on more and more load while maintaining a consistent level of
performance, responsiveness, reliability, and stability.  To do this, an
application has to be able to be distributed across multiple physical
servers.

For example, any piece of hardware - running any application - will
eventually become useless if a big enough load is put on it.  The
ability to scale is the ability to add additional hardware to distribute
the load across, without making significant changes to the application's
architecture each time a new server comes online.  The more hardware,
the more load your application can handle.  So you add one piece of new
hardware, and you can handle twice as much load as before - this is a
linear scale.

The ability to do this is really an architectural issue, which is why
Shiflett is exactly right.  It has less to do with your programming
language, database, or OS, than it does with your application's design.

Good design =3D=3D scalable
Bad design !=3D scalable

So why do so many people consider Java to scale?  Because this "good
design" and architecture is built into the language itself.  In other
words, Java (really, J2EE) has mechanisms for adding new servers and
sharing load and data between these new servers transparently (or, at
least that's the intent).  This allows new hardware to easily be added
indefinitely, thus handling increased load indefinitely, and thus scale.

Or so that's the theory.

Agreed 100%.  There was a time when sendmail defaulted as an open relay

Not sure I understand 100% - you mean transactions?  Foreign key
constraints?  It sounds more like SQL level stuff, rather than something
at a JS/CSS or even PHP level.

/me laughs

I'm in for a party.

Beer will scale, because the system it is built upon scales. :)

Bartending is a stateless protocoll, customer makes a request, request
is filled, connection is terminated. If another request needs to be
made a seperate connection is required.

Suggested configuration for an open bar that scales:
StartServers       10
MinSpareServers    5
MaxSpareServers   20
MaxClients       2000
MaxRequestsPerChild  20
StartKegs       20
MinSpareKegs       5       #Order new kegs from store
MaxSpareKegs       30       #Return excess kegs to store

I'm having trouble downloading the source from php.net, this isn't
likely to get any better as it just got /.'d

If anyone manages to grab them, are they willing to provide a download
to others on the list?

I always go direct to a mirror, and generally that's us2.php.net (since
it's Hurricane Electric and they have loads of bandwidth).

Agreed... beer scales.  It has a good architecture and is designed well
:)

Tomorrow night is the Tech Hangout, which many from NYPHP planned on
attending.  I think a PHP 5 toast there tomorrow night could be a good
idea.

It's free and has cheap drinks.

Looking forward to it,

It is not opensource... it is about $400 .. That right there means it
will not be heavily used.

I had signed up for the beta test and was not impressed at all.
Maybe they have fixed some stuff now.. but this was about two months ago
so I am not sure how much they could have fixed..

I think what the poster meant was code/classes that let you display 
sortable pages of records -- I have 100 songs in my database, I want to 
display them 25 per page sortable by artist, title, or genre. And I want 
to be able to select 10 songs and click a button that sends them to me 
as a zip file.

It would be really useful to abstract the code needed to generate xhtml 
+ css + js lists like that.

Depends if you want to have "official" 5.0.0 release.  If so, you can 
obtain that from CVS too by using the "php_5_0_0" release tag.

I generally run the snapshots, though I downloaded 5.0.0 just to make sure 
it's all okay.

See you,

In general, it doesn't matter.

In fact, there's already some bug fixes in the CVS that didn't make it
into 5.0. Of course, there are some bug fixes in 5.0 that weren't in
last night's CVS.

Dadgummit, I almost got a rise outta these guys, and you had to go

Before this gets out of hand, I wasn't trying to say PHP is worse or 
better than any other scripting language, just that poorly written code 
is language-independent.

Looks like my python comment requires a response, and I will have to 
carefully prepare my defense...

I have it installed with apache 2

No one told me there would be problems so I just assumed it would work.

This is a good book. I found myself in agreement with a majority of what
they say, which is rare for most books on Web application security. I came
away feeling like the authors had a good grasp on the subject.

I noticed this, too. I'm not sure that it's poor research on their part as
much as a weak attempt at gaining credibility with an uneducated audience.
PHP is an easy target for "poor security" arguments, even if the
reputation isn't deserved.

You might simply point out that a book like that is meant to help
developers write more secure code, and since the authors seem to have
difficulty distinguishing between a platform and applications developed
with that platform, you are having doubts about their credibility. :-)

That's it, except you and I seem to have different definitions of fluff.

(I think fluff means unnecessary or superfluous information, whereas your
statement below makes it seem like you believe fluff to be misleading
information.)

This is a valid criticism, and it's something I mention in my brief
discussion with Jack Herrington, author of The PHP Scalability Myth that
got a lot of attention last fall. You can read my comments here:

http://www.codegeneration.net/lth_archives/000248.html

You could say I "come clean" with the following:

"Also, regarding my most recent blog entry, it isn't entirely fair to
Java, but my focus is on PHP (and I never state that Java doesn't scale).
With so many people thinking Java scales more naturally than PHP, I find
it somewhat funny that the opposite is closer to the truth. But,
realistically, no PHP application is going to live in isolation, and as
soon as databases, session stores, and the like enter the picture, the two
are back on pretty even ground."

I just don't like seeing arguments about scalability that are pretty much
the opposite of the truth. I've written my share of applications for
platforms with an "application server" (ColdFusion, JSP), and I definitely
enjoy some of the conveniences that this type of environment offers me as
a developer. But, I would never kid myself and argue that this environment
scales better than something like PHP or mod_perl. That's not really a
good argument at all, but it's common.

I don't really get that analogy, but I understand your argument anyway.
:-)

That was just George's fancy way of saying modularity has nothing to do

The analogy was supposed to mean that it's meaningless to say that PHP 
is intrinsically horizontally scalable when necessary components of the 
majority of applications aren't intrinsically horizontally scalable.  
PHP isn't the application (neither is Java).  The discussion should 
really be about 'applications written in 
(Java|PHP|Python|Lisp|OCaml|foo)' which is what I think most people are 
talking about when they talk about the scalability of language X.

Or at least that's what they should be talking about. :)

Oh no, could it be you are adding froth (again) --

Hey:

Admittedly this is off-topic, but I am sending it with PHP, so...:)

I have never sent multipart email before and am reading up on it, and 
I see that different portions of messages are separated by something 
like:

boundary="============_-1122330894==_ma============"


I've read several little tutorials on the subject online, but no one 
has answered what is, for me, a semi-crucial question:  namely, is 
the string that is used for the boundary arbitrary?  Or must it 
follow a certain convention?

Cheers,

I could be wrong, but I believe I read somewhere a while ago that is was 
arbitrary. Perhaps the easiest way to deal with multipart messages I 
know of is to use the excellent mailing class at 
http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/ and then you do not have to worry 
about it. It is by far the best mail class I have come across for PHP.

Hi Hans,

Thanks for the response.

What I am looking for is page widgets - HTML/JS doohickeys (technical term!)
that enhance the user experience.  

Say you have a product that can be assigned to multiple categories - how are
you representing this on the screen, so that users can quickly
add/edit/delete multiple categories to that product?  Also, how to you let
them add a new category?  The emphasis is on minimizing page refreshes, and
trying to make it more like an application.  Just trying to see what people
have come up with. 

Thanks,

Tom

Not sure I understand 100% - you mean transactions?  Foreign key
constraints?  It sounds more like SQL level stuff, rather than something at
a JS/CSS or even PHP level.

It seems that everyone agree on the meaning of
"scalability" but not "WHERE" and "HOW" to apply it.
Can an expert weight in here?

Each boundary in an email must be the same, except the last one, which 
needs to have "--" tacked on the end.

But, each email must have a unique boundary.

To make a semantic nitpick, I would say that you can't apply 
'scalability'.  You can aply 'scalability principles'.

As far as how, that's quite beyond an email conversation.  There are 
plenty of books, papers, talks and discussions about what design 
factors contribute to scalable design.  Probably the best advice is to 
figure out what components of an architecture are unscalable (i.e. 
cannot be grown without changing their architectural design) and 
figuring out how to change them into something which can be scaled.

As far as where (or I'd say 'when') you should try to make you 
applications scalable, I guess that's up to you.  There are some folks 
who would say that you should always build your applications to be 
scalable.  I think that's definitely valid if you're building any sort 
of commercial software or software you plan to set free in the wild.  
It's much easier to build something right from the ground-up than to 
redesign it later, and apps which leave your control often have a way 
of being pulled into uses you never suspected.

As an aside, the stock definition of scalability that Hans threw out 
(which is an excellent one, imho) ignores the resource cost of scaling. 
  In general, you would prefer a solution whose cost scales linearly (or 
better yet sub-linearly, good luck there) with cost.  What this means 
is that if you are at capacity and you double your traffic, your costs 
should double as well.  There are many applications which scale, but 
not linearly (due for example to interdependencies between services).  
These apps 'scale' but become cost prohibitive.

As far as I know, it's arbitrary, however it should be something that is
100% unique as any other matching string will be interpretted as a boundary.
This is why they are usually long and perhaps appear to follow a
convention, such as your example.
But, technically, they don't have to be long or contain N instances of X.
A perfectly legit boundary could be:
boundary="and"
tho the result would not be desirable.

I agree. One of the things that originally got me started with PHP was
that it was so easy to get started using it, without really having to
think. It did feel like "magic".

Now that I'm {a little|a lot} more familiar with it, I don't miss those
"features" and even appreciate their absence. But I wonder to what
degree it has raised the bar to newcomers/rookies.
(I know that things like register_globals can be turned back on, but to
explain that to a noob....)

I had a similar feeling when first introduced to PHP 
(and to a certain extent still get this feeling from time 
to time)

It reminds me of what a client once told me:
"Oh boy, this is great -- I always wanted a computer 
to do my accounting".

I cautioned him, "Whoa there, this computer is not going 
to 'do' your accounting for you. You will still have to 'do' 
your accounting. You will have to decide whether something 
is an office supplies expense or whether you should 
capitalize the money you spend on a new Xerox machine. 
The computer will only record your decisions -- you 
will still have to do the accounting".

I was so happy when first working with PHP, because I 
was under the impression that PHP would 'do' all the 
HTTP stuff for me (without me having to learn anything 
about it).

My bubble burst with the arrival of my first 
'header already sent' message.

If there was any "magic" feature to be added, it should be an auto
trim() to include[_once]|require[_once] files

so frustrating to get that message because of a trailing \n|\r after the
closing ?>

but if you close your (included) php with 
return;?>

those trailing chars won't matter... try it
create your own magic :)

I wrote this for PHP Magazine a few months ago, but it should still be
correct. Happily, the whole article is now online for free:

Christian Stocker also has a good set of slides on XML in PHP 5:

This is exactly why I always leave off the closing tag on included
files.  Extra spaces etc. at the end of the file have no relevance,
since PHP continues to parse until the end of the file.

People say its sloppy style, but I disagree.  It's worked perfectly for
years, and in fact has saved me loads of time.  I suspect, although
haven't done any testing, that it's an added cycle of performance, too -
albeit a small one, I admit - because PHP just folds in whitespace until
the EOF, instead of seeing the closing tag and potentially then having
to send more data to the output buffer

Ahh, sorry for the misunderstanding.

I'm the wrong guy for getting stuff to look good on the screen :)

I'd use checkboxes, one for each category, and an "other" checkbox with
an accompanying text field...
if "other" is checked and a value entered in the text field, during form
processing, I would add that value to my categories table.

That's an excellent point.

It's also interesting, however, how this point is so often left out.
For instance, much of the stock definitions of scalability come from
hardware manufactures... don't forget, Java is Sun.  It seems a clever
example of a marketing memory lapse.

While they tout the ability for their hardware and software to scale,
they never mention that it'd take their $25K server and $100K SANS to do
it.  Not to mention the cost of the software itself.

Probably the primordial example of scaling is Google.  6000+ servers,
none of which (that I'm aware) are much more than nearly throw away i386
boxes.  And what language does most of it run?  Basic, old school, C
(although some Python/PHP is coming in house I hear).  This is a perfect
case where good architecture and design is what scaling is all about.

Or maybe their cost of scaling is measured in PhD's?

Generally, I would use a multi-choice list for the categories and an 
extra field for adding a new category. I dont think you can avoid the 
roundtrip to the server when adding a category.

I once wrote something (in ASP - bleh!) like this that loaded all the 
choices into JavaScript array objects from a database. Then as the user 
switches products, the categories can switch too by changing the array 
objects used in the category pulldowns through JavaScript callbacks. (A 
bit fiddly but it worked pretty well and it avoided a trip back to the 
server to just refresh the categories list).

Or, a complete focus on *function* which boils down to http requests, 
querying a database and inserting functionality into the results set via 
html. If that is all you do, and you do tons of it, then you do it 
fast/cheap/efficient and that means as low level a language as you can 
bear on your platform (so they chose C.. pretty bare bones and 
completely in control).

Let's not forget that when a company gets as big as Google, they own the 
platform so they do not need to accommodate anything that is not 
functional (unlike the rest of us, who must accommodate Windows bloat, 
PHP bloat, PyThon bloat, or the whims of the consumer marketplace). 
Usually companies had to go that route by makng specialized custom 
hardware, and the volume + dominance coming from being the absolute best 
at that "thing" paid for the extra expenses. Google's "custom hardware" 
is made of common components.

I think it must be very interesting to discuss the pros/cons of COTS 
(commercial off the shelf technology) at Google. Yes then went COTS, but 
they did so on a platform that is out of date (x86 architecture?). Where 
is the threshold?.... 6000+ old servers with old power consumption, old 
connector requirements, old cooling requirements, old failure rates, old 
memory/component requirements, need for C experts, etc.... at some point 
I imagine a strong case can be made for replacing it with a modern 
solution. If they did that, however, they would lose some of their 
fly-by-the-seat-of-their-pants flexibility. Let's face it, they used to 
have to worry about what they would be tomorrow, but now it's pretty 
clear they will always need to be Google the search engine that 
communicates via http and serves up query results with inserted XHTML 
codes in the results set.

Ever hear the joke about why Google programs in C? Because it's the only 
language that Ph.D's know how to code.

I don't recall if this was mentioned but the comment about "PhD's" is 
one that is often left out of technical discussions on scaling and 
scalability -- and that is the people cost.  To count the cost of 
scaling an app or set of apps, the people cost can be significant, which 
is why the systems management issue is critical.  Several years ago when 
I was teaching the network 'capstone' course, Network Analysis & Design, 
I would remind people both verbally and in role-playing that some of the 
technical aspects of the job are easy, it's the people problems that are 
gonna bite them in the ass :)

Every attack wether web or otherwise I have heard about starts with
learning as much as you can about the target's systems, then seeking
to exploit some either known or unknown security holes in the software
that system is running.

Knowing that, why reveal anything? Make the potential attacker work
for every peice of information they want. Set the apache server string
to claim it is some recent release of IIS, tell all the services not
to advertise they are running, save your .php files as .exe and tell
apache just to interpret apropriatly. etc. Obviously if you choose to
run some off the shelf application (ie phpBB) you will let the cat out
of the bag, but seperating it to a subdomain may only add to the
confusion.

Does anyone see any real advantage to this approach?

I can tell you PHP folk up in NY do not work for the US Feds nor for a 
federal contractor, but were you ever to do so, you'd find how horribly 
security measures that deal with the Web fly in the face of 
federally-mandated Section 508 Compliance.

Augh! You have to put your EMAIL address on your website, how secure is 
THAT???

I do know of some PHP programmers in DC for the Labor Dept that once 
"spoofed" Apache into interpreting PHP files as ".asp" (and to show 
itself as IIS!) to spoof the higher-ups that everything was in a M$ 
environment to "make them happy".

See, if that was convincing enough prospective attacker would spend a
lot of time going after IIS and ASP vulnerabilities that presumably
(in the same form) exist in Apache and php.

Many call this "security through obscurity."  IMO, it only will stall an
attacker by confusing them for a bit.  Its easy to use forensics to determine
what technologies / platforms are being used.

There is a decent discussion of this here:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity
... and I'm sure many other places if you google around.

I had a much longer response in preparation, but Andrew just nailed it.
Obscurity is not security. And yes, it only stops the timid assailant. A
determined cracker will take it *personally* that you configured your server
to tell *lies* to its "friendly users"!! The NERVE!! He'll fix YOU, buddy!

Like all potentially security-increasing activities, this one is a 
trade-off. You are certainly confusing potential attackers, but you may 
also be confusing yourself (or your staff) -- the nonstandard 
configuration that makes your Apache/PHP setup look like IIS or some 
imaginary server requires more maintenance overhead to keep up to date, 
to explain to new employees, to edit when submitting bug reports, etc. 
It's not a huge overhead, but it's there.

A middle ground that I have used in the past is to tell Apache that 
files that end in ".html" should be handled by PHP. This provides a 
little bit of masking-from-attackers, makes things easy for 
non-technical folks working on the web site (since "everything" can have 
PHP in it, just save all files as .html), and is easy to maintain.

Like locks on doors, doing things like this will keep the casual 
attacker and script kiddies at bay.  For the more serious and persistent 
attacker who wants to gain entry, it's a bit more complicated.  For 
example, you can try to hide your operating system type, but the TCP/IP 
stack will have a certain "signature".  Running carefully crafted 
packets against this stack  can pretty much reveal what the site is 
running, regardless of what they're "advertising".

This is called 'security through obscurity', and can be effective as 
part of a LAYERED approach, but certainly cannot achieve better results 
than hardened operating systems and carefully configured application 
services.

Not anymore, the script kiddies' scripts are smart enough to not rely on 
the HTTP headers for server/OS identification, and many use NMAP for its 
fingerprinting prowess.  Perhaps the only thing you would fool is the 
next NIMDA variant, at best...

Whatever time you spend modifying your banners and HTTP headers is 
wasted, IMHO.

I never intended this to be the end all approach to my security (as
some seem to be under that impression), but instead combine it with
carefull coding, keeping packages up to date, apropriate firewall
rules, etc.

I hadn't really considered the trade offs to be that severe, but it
certainly seems to be something I should look at more closely.

I wasn't aware that tools capable of really determining what
applications was really running were that wide spread, I saw that one
had been updated recently on slashdot, but hadn't considered them that
common in script kiddie world.

I don't think they did it for the added "security through obsecurity" 
inasmuch as the fact that they were PHP programmers that were working on 
a federal government contract that mandated that everything web-wise be 
done in ASP.  So that was their "workaround".  Not "obscurity" as much 
as plain ol' foolin'.

Believe it. A lot of the security people I know got their start playing with
toys from the old l0pht team (now part of @Stake security), and the tools of
even two and three sophisticated and freely available (gotta love P2P
filesharing). 

For example, Back Orifice was such a nightmare because it was *everywhere*
and it did a really good job of sneaking past NT security. Combine that with
the omnipresent l0pht-crack and you had a one-two punch that could keep Ops
busy for a week trying to find and plug the holes because M$ didn't have
patches - or worse *couldn't* fix it at the OS level because things like BO
used ports that Windows generally couldn't live without.

I never let the thought enter my mind that "the apps aren't out there"
because they are, and they're both sophisticated and supported. Many people
sit up late every night thinking and plotting and planning and coding, just
to make life difficult for other people's PCs.

before going down the mis-direction route, you might be 
interested in reading:

http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2002/final/mkis_plop_2002.pdf 


It discusses 2 antipatterns (or patterns that are known to be 
faulty or problematic) in security.

The first pattern is my personal favorite -- 
you can't just 'bolt on security' after the application 
is built (very roughly paraphrased)

The second I would name 'what you don't know could 
definitely hurt you'.
(overlooking data sensitivity classification)

Here is a very good starting point to see just how many tools are available:

    http://www.insecure.org/tools.html

The swiss-army knife of scanners seems to be NMAP, with Nessus good for 
purty reports and ethereal for snooping.  My favorite is ettercap, an 
evil tool that enables you to poison a switch, therefore seeing the rest 
of the traffic on that segment (that you weren't supposed to see).  I 
got a great security story about that if anyone is interested off-line.  ;)

hmmm... if you can "convert" the switch port to be a monitor port, 
assuming it's not running VLANs or in full duplex mode... I'm familiar 
with poisoning a RIP route, but haven't heard that term applies to a 
switched segment.

Yep, and it is pretty rude as the only way to returnthe network to 
normal operations is to reset the switch.  Only use in emergency!

You get some great advice out of the PHP community on some pretty 
sophisticated stuff, because as we have all heard it ain't so much about 
PHP as it is about the PLATFORM and the APPS. When the discussion 
approaches ARP cache poisoning, you know there is some real depth to 
this commuity :-)

Now let's make it also clear that when you step into the realm of 
*security* (or privacy) you need to adddress the DATA in addition to all 
else. Im my view it is essential that you:

-be able to restore your data easily and efficiently *at any time* (how 
many can do that?) to the same or another system
-have nothing of high value to hackers available to hackers (not as hard 
as it sounds, but the devil is in the details) e.g. translucent databases
-have a process in place (tested, secure, reliable) to respond to 
compromise in the course of normal business (as normal as possible)
-determine and document and publicize (raise awareness internally ) of 
the downtime and risks associated with your setup, so there are no 
surprises if *everything* is lost. It should be just a normal business 
event to rebuild/restore everything (planned to be a rare event, but not 
a disastrous event)

There are many businesses that would not survive a fire - they would be 
devastated and go bankrupt. Ditto for compromise or breech of servers 
and networks. It doesn't have to be that way, and those who are prepared 
will survive. Now, to get the costs of preparedness approved by 
management.... that is another story.

I am getting the impression that the reason for my "outside status" from 
an e-psychological approach comes from the fact that, from what I can 
tell of your postings here, you guys are PHP developers with extensive 
networking and engineering backgrounds for large public sectors..

I happen to be a PHP/ASP/TCL/Javascript web application developer with 
no networking and engineering background for small private and 
governmental sectors.. no matter 98% of what you all talk about projects 
so far over my head it orbits Titan!

But if anything, I do know that *nix, though currently more airtight 
against the wave of viral assaults than M$ solutions, is not fully 
accepted (but getting there) in the federal universe.

I suspect it is more about "how" people learn than "what" people already 
know.

I'd rather play squash with an expert who beats my ass every time than a 
newbie at the same skill level as me.

Actually, you have to have two newlines after a closing PHP tag to matter,
and this annoys me (I think it annoys Hans, too, since I seem to recall a
bug report with his name on it).

Here's why it annoys me. Run this code:

<table>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <? echo 'Foo'; ?>
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

You'll get this:

<table>
   <tr>
      <td>
         Foo      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

Yuck. :-)

The reasoning behind this, as I understand it, is simply to help avoid
problems caused by undesired output at the end of included files. It seems
that there is surely a way to avoid the problem without resorting to this
"solution," but I may be missing something important.

Do you want the output to be:

<table>
     <tr>
        <td>Foo</td>
     </tr>
  </table>

? (I.e. PHP scans backwards from the start tag and forwards from the end 
tag and removes whitespace?)

What if your code is:

<pre>
Top Level
     Next Level
          <?php print $relevant_info; ?>
     End Next Level
End Top Level
</pre>

Then, the whitespace is important.

Perhaps I am missing something.

(BTW, I am also a fan of the leave-the-?>-off-the-end-of-the-file 
technique.)

This is a good example of when a str_replace() would be better. :-)

Nope, I want it to leave everything alone that is not within PHP tags,
thus:

<table>
   <tr>
      <td>
         Foo
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

I don't want the newline that I intentionally put after the closing PHP
tag to be stripped.

Yes, so I would prefer it not output this:

<pre>
Top Level
     Next Level
          Foo     End Next Level
End Top Level
</pre>

Oops! That's actually the book I thought I was talking about. I got my
titles confused, and I guess I gave away the fact that I haven't read it
all yet. :-)

I just grabbed the book to verify. It is "Innocent Code" that I think is a
good book, from what I've read.

It's not going to be in PHP until 4.3.8 and likely 5.1.0, though maybe 
5.0.1.

There is a long article on kuro5hin.org that just hit the front page, in 
response to the release of 5.  It has a nice little tutorial, and even 
goes into OO and what is new in this release.  My favorite quote:
"The syntax of PHP looks like the offspring of a drunken alley-fondle

Just thought I'd mention it for those who are interested.

Once you get past the "emotional" part, it's a somewhat interesting 
piece.  I would be more interested in what the Convissors, Shifletts, 
Sklars, Tractenbergs and Zauneres and other people of that technical 
caliber on this list have to say...

oh.. so that's how that happens... it annoys me, too, as I like to have

I guess I would trade losing that "feature" for having to make sure
there were no trailing chars that might mess up headers or using my

Hello Listies,

I am creating files with a PHP script. I want the script to 'scp' the
just-created file to a Windows box running a SSH/SCP server (WinSSHD)

The created files are owned by 'www'

I want to scp the files so that there is no prompt for a password --  as I
understand it, this is 'RSA Authentication'

I created a keypair using 'ssh-keygen -t dsa' and registered the public key
with the WinSSHD server.

Then, in the PHP script:

#####PHP#######
	$command = 'scp -q -B -i <PRIVATE_KEY> ' . $filename . '
<USER>@<IP_ADDY>:' . basename($filename);
	system( $command, $rc ); 
#####PHP#######

where:

<PRIVATE_KEY> is the private key of the keypair
$filename is the just-created file
<USER> is a Windows account
<IP_ADDY> is the IP of the Windows machine



Now, if I shell into the webserver and run the command, it works fine. BUT,
the system() looks like it fails...

Any hints? Can you tell me where else to look?

You may want to look at dsa keys, that is how I do it.
You create a dsa key and then add it to your known hosts file in
~home/.ssh/ 
Another alternative which works well is using php to call an expect
script, that way you don't need to bother with dsa keys (if security is
a concern).
'expect' comes with a script called autoexpect that you can quickly use
to create an expect script just 'autoexpect scp ..whatever..' and it
will create a script that you can call with 'expect script.exp' that
will do what you did during the autoexpect situation.
I have found that it is usually good to modify scripts done with
autoexpect though.

cheers

Here's a best practices question: my script has several objects, say 
one to do authorization and one or more others to display content, or 
whatever. Most, if not all, of these objects access multiple databases, 
one for authorization, one for content, etc.

Is it better to have object create its own private connection object 
(in my case I'm goofing off with the new mysqli_ functions, but I'm 
sure this would apply equally to PEAR::DB, or even an old school 
connection string), or creating a single connection object and passing 
that around to the other objects as needed?

My weasely answer (below), turns on how you'd like to define "better".

The performance optimization is:

Assuming the different databases are on the same server, create one 
connection and then pass that around in your program. Saves DB server 
resources, network overhead, connection start up time, etc.

The encapsulation and object re-use optimization is:

Have each object connect separately with its own credentials, allowing 
you freedom in the future to move the databases to different servers, 
tweak access control from each object, etc.


That said, unless you have immediate and large code re-use needs, my gut 
is to do the performance optimization.

You can put the two ideas together.  Have each class extend it's database 
connection from a common database class.  When instantiating, do a check 
to see if a database connection already exists with the given criteria.  
If so, use the existing connection object.  If not, create a new 
connection object.  A singleton method may be what you're looking for.

Hmm, but isn't that kind of what PHP does automatically?

"If a second call is made to mysql_connect()  with the same arguments, no 
new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the 
already opened link will be returned."
  -- http://us3.php.net/mysql_connect

Not sure of the performance implications of trying multiple connects with 
the same credentials.  If PHP does it without contacting the datbase 
server, it may be about the same speed as doing your own checks.  I'm to 
busy right now to try some tests.

See you,

I didn't believe this when I first read it, but can confirm:

$dbcon1 = mysql_connect( $h, $u, $p );
mysql_select_db( 'clew', $dbcon1 );

$dbcon2 = mysql_connect( $h, $u, $p );
mysql_select_db( 'chxo', $dbcon2 );

$result = mysql_query( "show tables",  $dbcon1 );
while ( $record = mysql_fetch_array( $result ) ) {
  print $record[0]."<br />";
}

... will show the tables in the "second" database, even though the query 
was sent via the "first" connection.

Weird.

One thing is that a user's authorization to do things 
is typically determined by the permissions which are granted to 
him. Once a user is authenticated MySQL knows what that 
user can and can't do.

This authentication process is pretty well 
tuned to be fast.

In general terms, I would suggest that you 
set up usernames for each role or roles that 
you want your objects to be authorized to play.
(in other words going and selecting role information 
from a separate table is a relatively time consuming 
operation when compared to how quickly MySQL can 
do effectively the same thing under the hood)

The actual process of creating a connection is pretty 
slow.

You could create a class that has a 
$db_link variable set up (during construction) with 
a procedural call something like 

$this->db_link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "main_user", "main_password",
"usual_db");

Then if a function (inside the class -- aka method) had to switch
databases 
to do something, you could try something along the lines of

mysqli_change_user($this->db_link, "special_user", "special_password",
"special_db");

and could keep the connection and just take advantage of the (fast) 
authentication operation. 

I would be fairly wary though of a design that required  
classes to go to different databases to get things done -- 
I don't see how the class structure could be too coherent. 
One of the tenets of OO design it to keep all data 
that is functionally related in one place -- not in 
disparate databases.

I must admit to being underwhelmed by this article. I am not sure what 
the author's point(s) was/were. New PHP 5 features make it possible to 
write non-web apps in PHP? Heavily OO PHP 5 code looks a lot like Java?

I suppose if today is the first time you are taking a look at PHP 5, 
then these might seem like notable and mildly amazing aspects of it, but 
  otherwise they don't seem too surprising. PHP-GTK and the cli SAPI 
have been around for a while; the PHP 5 OO syntax has been available for 
perusal for plenty of time as well.

A more interesting area for PHP futurology, IMHO, is whether future 
versions of PHP will run on the Zend Engine (v2 or a future version), 
Parrot, or the CLR.

I have a ton of PHP and MySQL experience and I have decided to put a little  
network in my apartment.  So I got my Linux box, I have two windows boxes,  I 
have a single static IP, a Cisco router, and a manual?  Can anyone give  me 
some pointers?  A path in the right direction?
 
1) What Linux should I use?  I have a free distribution of Red Hat  9?  Is 
Fedora better?  Any advice?
 
2) Currently my router is dynamically assigning TCP/IP #'s to each  machine.  
I know I have to set this up differently.  I want the linux  box to be a http 
server, ftp, email, etc, and I want the windows boxes to have  access to the 
net.  Any suggestions on how I should do this?  I think  I have to setup a 
DNS, but with only one static IP I think this gets  tricky.  Any assistance would 
be greatly appreciated.
 
3) Also, when I unpack RPM distributions and the RPM needs a library, where  
is the best place to find it.  And if you can't find it what do you  do.  For 
example, I was trying to install PICO under Red Hat and it kept  asking for 
libncurses.so.5.  I check the web but could not find it.   Any help?
 
Thanks so much!

If your router does "port forwarding", you can set it to forward port 80 
on its static ip address to your linux box's dynamic ip.

You should never dynamically assign static boxes ... I think DHCP on a
network you actually run is kinda evil .. if its just you, statically
assign everything, I personally think its better in the long run

I find this to be a PITA as well.  Sometime downloading the source and
doing a ./configure --prefix=/usr fixes things, other times you should
really grab the libraries from the original RH9 disks, there are things
like yum and apt-get as well which are suppose to alleviate issues like
this but (from reading) each has its own pros and cons.

Sometimes if you build a library yourself (configure/make/sudo make
install) you can run RPM with --nodeps to get it to override that error
message if you know you have the library.  Whether this method is really
recommended I have yet to find out (how to keep RPMs and libs in sync).

 I'm currently working on IIS 5.0 and PHP 4.3.8. I running my own web server at my place. Here is the task I would like my script to accomplished:

So if I create a folder name "newsite" and I bind the IP 189.176.2.104 to it., I would be able to access the folder content if I put the IP address on the web browser. I know there is ways to do it using VBScript and all the .NET series. What I am interested in using is PHP, or even javascript. Thanks in advance for the help.

Agreed. Consider a ports-based distro -- or heck, do it by hand. 
Portability is fun, and you don't have to depend on any single software 
source for updates or patches to your libraries.

In Issac Asimov's "Foundation," one of the chapters contains a scene
when a diplomat visits a planet. During his stay, the diplomat talks
the entire time. After he leaves one of the political figures
turns to his opponent and says something to the effect of: "See. I
told you he'd support our position."

As it turns out, the opponent had secretly taped everything the
diplomat said over the entire trip, and submitted it to the chair of
the university's linguistic department for lexical evaluation. The
evaluation was to filter out all the superfluous diplomatese and
conflicting statements, so the people on the planet could know exactly
what he said.

After a complete analysis, it turns out the diplomat said nothing at
all. Everything canceled out, and they were left with an empty piece
of paper.

I feel that way about the this piece. I spent 10 minutes reading it,
but afterwards, I don't feel he said anything meaningful.

I think if he had taken the time to edit the piece and shortened it
up, it would have been 25% the length and 25x more useful.

To quote Pascal:

   I am sorry for the length of my letter, but I had not the time to
   write a short one.

The question really pertains to your level of paranoia (or LOP) ... if
your LOP > 2 x the average sysadmin, then static for everything is your
best bet (even if you have to learn how to accomplish it (static arping
for example)) ... if your LOP < 1 x the average sysadmin then you can
take the lazy route :-)

I can understand the practical frustration in firewall/iptables
configuration for such a setup but I think it comes down to what you
would like to protect if (something bad were to happen){} ..

Im really not a sysadmin so Id be a bad judge vs. the topology layout of
your personal network ... but I always think straight route is the best.
~ Security wise Id hope something is monitoring your "router to the net" :-)

Message-ID: <EF704040-D729-11D8-B46A-0003930D07F2@email.smith.edu>

Greetings,

On Wednesday I was in Boston attending Macworld and found myself 
inevitably drooling over the various book offerings at the O'Reilly 
booth.  One of the many titles that jumped out was "Spidering Hacks" by 
Kevin Hemenway and Tara Calishain.  However, I refrained from 
purchasing because the book is based on the use of Perl to perform most 
or all of the spidering functionality.
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/spiderhks/

So far, PHP is the only programming/scripting language that I have 
played with.  I thought I would ponder the following before purchasing 
this book:

A.  Can I be achieving the same results using PHP that I can using this 
book and Perl?
B.  Are there other technologies that would be more desirable to 
achieve spidering functionality?
C.  What is the perceived future of Perl?  Does it still have something 
to offer when compared with other programming languages today?  Is it 
worth me spending the time to learn it?

Granted, some of these questions may bring a certain level of 
subjectivity into play.  I'd be interested to hear any 
thoughts/suggestions that folks would like to provide.  I'm not averse 
to getting my feet wet with Perl if I feel that I am developing a 
skillset that will increase my marketability.

Thanks!

Thanks! This is a good thing to remember.

As it turns out, I *think* the problem is that user that is trying to scp
('www') cannot use the private key that I created without providing a
passphrase.

I'm not *positive* that this was the problem, but I ran around the problem by
re-writing some of the script and calling the script from root's cron job.

Thanks!

Hi Aaron, being a complete noobie using php ( me ), i can tell you i've seem
most of the stuff mentioned at the site possible with PHP. It might even be
easier in some instances. Scraping content, inclusion of content, and
weather are all possible via PHP. :)

This all seems terribly complicated to set up a little routing between 
three machines.  I have 4 machines at home each with a static IP 
address.  I modified the hosts file on each machine to know about the 
other three machines.  I use my router for DNS and routing to the 
outside word.  This bypasses having to set up a dns server.  Each time I 
add a new virtual server on a machine I update the hosts file on each of 
the machines.  I do this for my linux box, Win2k box, OSX box, ect.

The hosts file can be found in, C:\WINNT\system32\drivers\etc\hosts on 
Win2k.  It is in etc/ in Linux and OSX.

Host file might look like this:

# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.0.103   ftp.linuxboxen
192.168.0.103    www.linuxboxen
192.168.0.104     Win98Boxen
192.168.0.104     www.Win98Boxen
127.0.0.1    ftp.localmachine
127.0.0.1    www.localmachine

Just my approach to this problem.

I'm not a CISCO expert but I think you can set up NAT to point those ports to a specific local IP address. You should have a configuration section on your router to setup NAT tables.

Unless I'm missing something.... The gateway/router is the device that has
the static IP from the ISP, right? So you configure the router to forward
the appropriate port to the IP (static, assigned by you) of the
appropriate machine inside your LAN.

caught the tail end of this convo... the "routing" of the various server 
requests, e.g. http, ftp, etc is handled not by the IP address, but by 
the Destination Port in the TCP header.

For example, let's say a packet arrives at your router and matches your 
IP address (disregard "internal" vs. "external" addresses). The router 
then forwards the packet to your box over the Ethernet LAN.  Once in the 
box, the IP layer process (software) forwards the packet up to the TCP 
process.  TCP examines the Destination Port and essentially asks: "what 
service/process is waiting for requests on this port?"
Assuming an httpd server is running (e.g. apache), that server "signed 
up" to receive requests on Port 80.  TCP then "forwards" the request to 
the httpd process.  Of course, it's a bit more complicated than that, 
since TCP doesn't really "forward" the request to Apache, but schedules 
that service to run by placing it's process id (PID) in the O/S 
scheduler's "ready queue".  But that's the essence of it.

If, on the other hand, an FTP request came in, the IP address gets it to 
the box as above.  But this time the TCP Destination Port is Port 21, 
which is the port ftp waits on for requests.  If an SSH request came in, 
and the sshd server was running, a packet directed to Port 22 would "end 
up" being sent to sshd.

There's a couple examples and hope that helps.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] A call for all PHP'ers,
	the gtk.php.net site needs your help.
Message-ID: <1089989765.9108.40.camel@bezel>

Hello there,
Yesterday I sent a msg to the php-gtk-general mailing list (which I am
on) about the state of the PHP-GTK site and the fact that their wiki got
slammed with spam and difficulties in actually using the php-gtk site.

Here is the thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=108991553900001&r=1&w=2

There is a call for people with web skills to help work on gtk.php.net
and help with documentation and get the search functions working.

My original posting is here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=php-gtk-general&m=108991553813451&w=2

If you have written any php-gtk apps we could use your help in tutorials
and they are looking for more people to document, write apps etc..

I invite you *all* to join the 'general' mailing list, more info here:
http://gtk.php.net/resources.php
In addition on freenode.net in #php-gtk

A lot of this push is because of the release of PHP5 and a lot of
renewed interest in PHP-GTK. Part of the problems is that the php-gtk
documentation is not currently well and a lot of people have not put up
tutorials and apps on the gtk.php.net site. They are trying to pull
everything back to have a central site of information for writing
php-gtk apps.

If you are not familiar with php-gtk, you can do some pretty cool stuff
with it, I have a tutorial here:
http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/tut/
and another here:
http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/phpgtk/
There are a lot of apps out, but the documentation has been an issue in
bringing in new programmers.

I was also asked to do a presentation at the new meeting on php-gtk in
september based on my first php-gtk tutorial, though I don't know the
status of that as I may be in Ireland for an RDF conference.

Thanks.

Does php-gtk even work with PHP 5? Isn't there a php-gtk 2.0 coming
out? If so, when?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Tricks with __FILE__?
Message-ID: <C0CDB9F5E81C234FBB42D84E7853125D013B0A77@intamail1.inta>

In the interest of making my error mesages more meaningful, I've written
code where calls to functions often have __FILE__ and __LINE__ in the
argument list. I pass them in explicitly because AFAIK, that's all that can
be done. When I include or require a module, the value of __FILE__ is of
course the same as the name of the include. This is as expected. That's why
I pass those constants when I call the function contained within the
include. Pretty straightforward, but tedious.

Can anyone suggest how I might be able to gather the name of the *original*
script that's calling include()? Is there an element on $_SERVER[] that can
do the trick?

I have confirmed that this is not true for mysqli_, if you have

$dbcon1 = new mysqli($h,$u,$p);
$dbcon2 = new mysqli($h,$u,$p);

$dbcon1->select_db('db1');
$dbcon2->select_db('db2');

if ( $result = $dbcon1->query( 'SHOW TABLES' )) :
	while ($row = $result->fetch_row())  echo $row[0] . "<br/>";
	$result->close();
endif;

Will give you the tables in db1

Yes and no...

If the attacker is going after attacking the *host* then this is true.
However, most web attacks are at a different level, and thus not
specific to any one platform - ie. XSS.

While certainly related, host and web security are in different playing
fields.  If someone is trying to crack the box, then you better be sure
you turned off all the legacy UNIX ports, have the most updated patches
to Apache/sendmail/etc.  If someone is trying to work over your web
application, then it's strictly the application.

Personally, I don't.  Plain and simple, it's so easy to determine your
platform just by looking at the TCP/IP packets (called OS
fingerprinting).  Besides that, there are so many ways a box leaks it's
identity (apache/smtp/ftp/ssh/etc) that unless all of these are obscured
(which is quite tedious) you're only adding more work for yourself, and
possibly preventing legit identification.

Furthermore, most exploits don't lie in the platform or language used.
Again, since we're talking web application security, the problem lies in
the application itself.  If it's an off the shelf app as you point out,
there's nothing that can be done.  And if it's a custom app, the attacks
people use are frankly cross platform anyway.

Once again, since we're talking web security for the most part, attacks
are at a different level - and independent - of what platform is used,
assuming you're not ignoring relevant patches.

An XSS hole?  SQL injection?  Session hijacking?  Does it really matter
what platform is in use?

I proudly run .php extensions, default error messages, and the
X-Powered-By: PHP   HTTP header.

Well amen... I've lobbied for this for years, both on the bug report
system and to PHP's developers' faces, but to no avail.

And if you think it's annoying when dealing with HTML, try writing a CLI
script that runs on the console!

I say we get a petition going around to fix this :)  (fairly simple fix
from what Ilia and Derick said to me once).

So true ...

Practically the only real thing you can do from a security pespective is
to virtually "listen" to the mailing lists which get the word out,
things like Bugtraq, FullDisclosure, OSVDB, and others.

There are tons of projects in the works (aka "Sourceforged") that try
packet mangling for your box to prevent OS fingerprinting (like Morph)
in which even the authors have a very tough time hiding details from
passive OS sniffing because your packets just get out there w/ alot of
detail.

For Linux there are items like IPpersonality kernel patches which can
fool the stack but not sure its worth going through all that trouble.
Ive "studied" the security area for a while now, the honeynets/rootkits
and other cat/mouse trickery is pretty interesting topics.

I find it that you cant really arm yourself with a "one software package
~ does it all" defense approach + your only *real* defense is better
knowledge of security as a whole.  So beyond going undercover and
mingling w/ the folks writing the exploits, joining those lists gives
early insight.

Oh, and BTW another interesting topic you might be interested in, Port
Knocking ... www.portknocking.org

The concept: A port remains closed and waits for a secret knock sequence
on closed ports before opening itself.

I like drunken alley-fondles...  and yes, PHP's syntax is a perfect
blend of sober C and staggering Perl.

I agree... I'm not sure of the point.  Although, for new users looking
at PHP, especially with the release of 5, it does make a nice summation.

I especially like this comment:

"As someone who spent half a year implementing a major web application
in PHP, these are all features it would have been nice to have."

I'm sure there are programmers around that could rewrite that as:

"As someone who spent 5 years implementing a major financial application
in Assembly, these are all features it would have been nice to have."

Perhaps alluded to by the clever title "Zend in the clowns?"

I have a ton of PHP and MySQL experience and I have decided to put a
little network in my apartment.  So I got my Linux box, I have two
windows boxes, I have a single static IP, a Cisco router, and a manual?
Can anyone give me some pointers?  A path in the right direction?

=20

1) What Linux should I use?  I have a free distribution of Red Hat 9?
Is Fedora better?  Any advice?

=20

I've used Fedora Core 2 and have been very happy.... as far as Linuxes
go, anyway.

=20

2) Currently my router is dynamically assigning TCP/IP #'s to each
machine.  I know I have to set this up differently.  I want the linux
box to be a http server, ftp, email, etc, and I want the windows boxes
to have access to the net.  Any suggestions on how I should do this?  I
think I have to setup a DNS, but with only one static IP I think this
gets tricky.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

=20

I have a Linksys router and it's a simple config to make a particular IP
part of the DMZ (ie, all traffic from the internet gets routed into that
IP, and vice versa).  Meanwhile, the other boxes (Windows and Mac) are
tucked away behind NAT.  I'm also able to setup a static IP address
assignment via the DHCP server in the Linksys router.  If this isn't an
option, then you can just turn off DHCP on the Linux box and set the IP
manually.  Nevertheless, you don't need a DNS server by any stretch.

=20

3) Also, when I unpack RPM distributions and the RPM needs a library,
where is the best place to find it.  And if you can't find it what do
you do.  For example, I was trying to install PICO under Red Hat and it
kept asking for libncurses.so.5.  I check the web but could not find it.
Any help?

=20

http://www.rpmfind.net <http://www.rpmfind.net/>  can be helpful.  If
you're using a particular distro, like Fedora, 99% of the RPMs are at
their download site.  Otherwise, the particular library or package is
probably available as an RPM at its homepage.

=20

Or you could just use a ports based distro like Chris says... oh wait,
that's FreeBSD  :-)

Yes, you were asked  :)

I hope it can happen.  If not Sept, then soon... let me know.

It's also exciting to see php-gtk coming back into light... it's a great
area for PHP to be in.

This isn't possible, as far as I know, with PHP.  VBScript and .NET
stuff have a freighting intimate relationship with their web server,
IIS.  PHP is designed - and rightfully so - to be a straightforward
scripting language for connecting to databases, parsing and sending
text, etc.  And this is certainly not possible using JavaScript
(although with the IE and Windows security problems recently, it might
be :-)

seems like people love "popping" stuff up these days ...

unfortunatley its harder to talk them out of it than it is to just
code/do it.  so i was trying to research and find out what detection
methods are available for it and what browsers do what.

do all blockers work w/ the CTRL+click to overwrite protection?  is
there a standard or draft for this type of stuff?

im assuming they are looking/parsing window.open() calls ... would you
move over to dhtml in these cases (like the amazon dropdowns), i dont
think they can work w/ embeddable flash which im sure will come up.

you could probably figure out how to accomplish this first in COM and
then connect it:

http://us4.php.net/com

(take a look @ the example on that page - crazy stuff)

you are probably looking for COM-based file function that can mount like
that.

I agree with everything Hans said (of course), but I'm not sure one should
be so proud about displaying error messages. :-)

Kidding aside, I think it's pretty easy to set display_errors to Off and
log_errors to On. I'm as guilty as anyone else about not adhering to my
own suggestions sometimes, but if you're concerned about giving away too
much information, I think error messages are the first place to be
looking.

I did some research and found that PHP actually have a extension called
php_iisfunc.dll.  Its has several function that would help me like
iis_addserver, iis_getserverbypath and etc.  But there seem to be a lack of
documentation on the functions.  So I'm pretty walking around blind with the
extension.  Maybe someone have experience with the extension can give me
some in-sight

Talk?  Why talk?  Just invite them out for drinks and then put poison in

Good advice too.  The errors display the full path to a file.  This can 
help crackers learn about you system's configuration and use that info 
when leveraging exploits.

Ditto to what Hanz said. I would have suggested ditch the router and use 
box #1 as a linux router ... if only for the the flexibility and 
educational value. If you enjoy configuring it todo the right things as 
a firewall then you'll love Astarro Linux.

With Netgear or Linksys routers at $80 with NAT and even an exptra print 
server (Netgear FR114P), DMZ, port forwarding, etc the last thing I need 
is a cisco router getting in the way... fast and flexible, youcan have 
as many as you like to cordon off whatever you need with peace of mind 
(keepthe firmware upated)

Yeah, I agree too (and always use php.ini-recommended which takes care
of this).

But that's not really what I meant.  I was speaking more to Apache's
default error pages (like a 404) which clearly states that Apache is in
fact serving the pages.  If someone goes the security through obscurity
route, then it's important to remember to modify this behavior, among
other things.

I can't think of anything I would want *less* than probes thinking my 
box is IIS. My log would be full of 256+ length "XXXX" strings, .exec 
hack attempts, worm hole seekers, etc. And if a cracker actually was 
fooled enough to think my box WAS some form of hardened IIS, then the 
script kiddies would surely try everything against it, fully confident 
that something would work.

I think having identify itself as SecureBSD or perhaps 
name_a_planet(@random)  would be less of a liability.

Again, thank you all for your help.  I have two seemingly stupid  questions 
that my ISP is having trouble answering:
 
a) If I use port routing, are the ports routed to the physical connection  on 
the router or the dynamic IP address assigned by the router?  If it is  the 
later, if the router assigns a different IP to the "http/ftp/etc server"  does 
the port routing follow automatically?
 
b) I get my static IP address through my cable company and in order to have  
the "business class" service, you have to use their Cisco Router.  If I  want 
to use my Linux box as a router as suggested, do I just use the Cisco  Router 
to deliver the static IP address to the linux box and then,  conversely, use 
the router for external DNS?
 
c) Does anyone know how to access a Cisco uBR900 router?
 
Thanks,
Lee

Ditto to what Hanz said. I would have suggested  ditch the router and use 
box #1 as a linux router ... if only for the the  flexibility and 
educational value. If you enjoy configuring it todo the  right things as 
a firewall then you'll love Astarro Linux.

With  Netgear or Linksys routers at $80 with NAT and even an exptra print 
server  (Netgear FR114P), DMZ, port forwarding, etc the last thing I need 
is a  cisco router getting in the way... fast and flexible, youcan have 
as many  as you like to cordon off whatever you need with peace of mind 
(keepthe  firmware  upated)

Routers route using IP addresses.   Although I've never personally used 
port routing with a cable modem, etc, the port-to-address mapping should 
be between the port number, e.g. Port 80 (web server) to the Dynamic 
(internal) IP address that the router has assigned to your server box.

I wouldn't use the Linux box as a router at this stage of the game, but 
just concentrate on getting what you have paid for (the Cisco router) 
working.  One question... is your ISP and the company providing your 
cable service two different organizations?   Also, since you mentioned 
"business class"  and the fact that the cable company provided the 
router, it is their responsibility to get things working.  At least 
that's the theory :)

>

Do you have the uBR900 manual?  Generally you can Telnet into these 
things and then you have to have know the username/password.   Again, 
the company that provided the router should be able to answer this 
question.  But *be careful*  -- if you get in there, there are lottsa 
ways to screw a router config up!!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] script to download remote log files (porting from
	Python to PHP)
Message-ID: <40F98553.1040408@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I came across a neat Python script which does something which I always 
have needed:
automatically download Apache log files from a remote server. In my 
case, I manage multiple sites, so such a script is even more useful to me.

The script is available here:
http://www.uselesspython.com/logtransfer.py

I am not that familiar with Python, but I am able to figure out what it 
does. I am thinking of porting it to PHP so that if I have to modify it, 
that process will go faster. I am also thinking of putting an HTML or 
XUL frontend on it, and storing the connection data in MySQL.

Before I port it to PHP, I was wondering if anyone has written such a 
script in PHP in the past, or knows where I can find one.

Also - I am planning on making the connection data (in MySQL) encrypted 
with a master password. I think PHP and MySQL both support the one-way 
MD5 encryption algorithm, but not any two-way ones, right? I think I 
once read that PHP needed a special module to support a two-way 
encryption scheme. I think I came across an encryption algorithm for PHP 
some time ago, which I might use, unless there is an easier way 
(something built into MySQL or PHP).

Any tips / suggestion on the best way to go about this (to port or not 
to port, to encrypt or not to encrypt, to use MySQL or not to use MySQL, 
to put a XUL front-end on or just stick with a command-line interface, 
if I am wasting my time doing this because something better already 
exists, etc.) would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

- Jay
PS: I came across a cool IDE for Python: Dr Python, available from 
drpython.sourceforge.net .

I've been watching the opposite at www.alexa.com - not sure of the 
linkage there, but basically you get google with thumbnails (and other 
metadata) returned with your search results.

Ehh .. I dont know about you (or about the project itself) but Id
seriously consider using scp to grab the info.

http://www.llnl.gov/computing/gettingstarted/ssh.outside.html#transfer

I think you might be confused, the MD5 is not for encrypting the data,
its used for the authentication.

I grab logs inside PHP/CLI using ssh/scp and public key authentication.

`scp user at host:/var/log/* /local/var/log`

The backtick scripts can be used directly inside of PHP scripts, so once
the download is complete you can run preg_match() on the file or
whatever if you are looking for something to store (more efficient).

i think the other thing to notice in the screenshot is the indentation
of the results .. it looks like some host threading going on which would
be *very* nice ..

like having a quick button for (-site:example.com) for exclusion in
future searches.

Seems kinda cool. Maybe they're testing the new feature by putting it on
"only" 10,000 of their servers or something. :-)

Yeah well in that case ... I should have *won* something, that would

What Im mainly interested in is if it will include the Web APIs.

from the XAMPP site:
...For the official PHP 5 version in XAMPP. Sometimes, great changes can 
be complicate. So we have PHP 4.3.8 and PHP 5.0.0 together in the 
current XAMPP version. And a "PHP Switch" for changing the PHP version. 
With the "php-switch.bat" (php-switch.php), you can switch from PHP 4 to 
PHP 5 or back

is the switch only available for windows users?

if so that would be a shame ;(

I assume from the "locate" command that you're on a Linux box :)   the 
following are the directions for Linux:
from the website page: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html

*Note to XAMPP 1.4.7*
Because such very new versions like PHP 5 always should be handled with 
care we decided to include both current versions of PHP into XAMPP: PHP 
5.0.0 and PHP 4.3.8. If you find out your PHP application doesn't work 
with PHP 5 you will be able to switch back easily to PHP 4.

By the following command you can switch "back" to PHP 4.3.8:

/opt/lampp/lampp php4

And with the following command you can switch back to PHP 5.0.0:

/opt/lampp/lampp php5

If you forgot which version of PHP is in use simply use phpinfo() or 
call this command:

/opt/lampp/lampp phpstatus

John,

you are a life saver ;)

although i am not running anything on my dev machine that will not run
on 5 i still needed this info so that if it came to crunch time i could
change back to 4 when needed ;)

XAMPP, but I still prefer doing it manually.

I noticed a zip code project at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/zips/ 

Don't know what's in it -- but it might 
interest you.

You can do it as an imprecise rectangle, where latitude/longitude is 
plus/minus a certain number of minutes.  Then you just do a SELECT for 
all zipcodes where the longitude/latitude falls within that rectangle. 
That's what a lot of job boards do and it usually works well enough for 
estimation, especially insofar as the longitude/latitude in those 
zipcode databases are only rough centers of mass.  Otherwise, if you 
need more precision you'll need to use spherical geometry, which is very 
costly.

Developers typically use either the ragged rectangle or precalculate 
distances at fixed deltas, caching the results in a separate table.  You 
get into some hairy calulus here because at higher latitudes the 
distance between two longitudinal degrees decreases.  At the equator, 
one degree of latitude or longitude is ~70 square miles, with 
longitudinal distance decreasing to zero at the poles.

distance = 3959 * (
	sin(latitude1/57.3) * sin(latitude2/57.3) +
	cos(latitude1/57.3) * cos(latitude2/57.3) *
         cos(longitude2/57.3 - longitude1/57.3))

Or something like that.

I did something like that a long time ago. Digging through my perl code,
I found this:

$ratio=0.0147791915; # miles per degree lattitude

Since the area that a zip code covers is somewhat of a fuzzy value, a
reasonable estimate would be to use something like this:

$dist=$miles*$ratio;
$query='select zipcodes from yourdatabase where 
lat>'.($currentlat-$dist).' and lat<'.($currentlat+$dist).' and 
lon>'.($currentlon-$dist).' and lon<'.($currentlon+$dist)';

you should obviuosly query the db beforehand to get the currentlat and 
currentlon based on your selected zipcode.

Posted this on this list some time ago:

<snip>
here's a function I've been using for a couple years now.  I can honestly
say I have no idea whether or not I wrote it as I'd done a LOT of variations
of it at the time.  From what I know it's worked well for around 2 years now
(for my client).  I've only tested with US values, but I imagine it should
work for other values as well.
 
Good luck!!

function getDistance($fromLatitude, $fromLongitude, $toLatitude,
$toLongitude) {
 
 /* assume your points, in decimal, are in $fromLongitude,$fromLatitude and
$toLongitude,$toLatitude 
 * this can also be useful with the US ZIPcodes at 
 * http://ftp.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/places.html 
 */ 
 
 $Pi   = 3.1415926535897932384626;
 $Radius  = doubleval($Pi/180.0); 
 
 $fromLongitude  = doubleval($fromLongitude) * $Radius; $fromLatitude =
doubleval($fromLatitude) * $Radius; 
 $toLongitude   = doubleval($toLongitude) * $Radius; $toLatitude =
doubleval($toLatitude) * $Radius; 
 
 $theta = $toLongitude - $fromLongitude; 
 $Distance = acos(sin($fromLatitude) * sin($toLatitude) + cos($fromLatitude)
* cos($toLatitude) * cos($theta)); 
 if ($Distance < 0) {
  $Distance += $Pi;
 } 
 
 $Distance  = $Distance * 6371.2; 
 $Miles   = doubleval($Distance * 0.621);
 $Distance  = sprintf("%.2f", $Distance); 
 $Miles   = sprintf("%.4f", $Miles);
 
 return $Miles;
}
</snip>

As far as doing it through sql... Haven't tried it.

I read a document @ Sun the other day explaining that you need to be a
programmer to really use PHP and the claim was w/ JSTL and JSP its
more component based .. so I was thinking how difficult it would be to
make a php tag function the same way ... an example:

<php:include file="mytaglib.php"/>*

<html>
<body>

<php:declare name="test" value="one,two,three" type="array"/>

<php:foreach>
<param name="input" value="test"/>
<oparam value="output">
Value: <valueof param="element.value"></valueof>
</oparam>
</php:foreach>

</body>
</html>

Well, maybe bad example, but basic idea ... (this is actually from an
ongoing peer conversation about java vs. php) ... but I think goes
back to a question I asked a long time ago in regards to <script
language="php" src="myfile.php"></script> not working (in PHP5 either).

The idea of tags kills me, however calling a single function in an
include would be nice - cleaner version of: <?php
include("myfile.php"); myfunction(); ?>

Another example:
<php:valueof name="param:id"></php:valueof> == <?php
echo($_GET['id']); ?> == <?= $_GET['id'] ?>

These example are a bite off ATG Dynamo JHTML/droplet stuff but what
Im really after is the including files w/ params stuff from a tag
based structure.  Im sure this either a) exists in some form somewhere
b) can be done or c) no worth it.  Any thoughts?

* - Disclaimer: Please don't try this and email me that it doesn't
work.  I know it doesn't.  It's a POC.

Why merge scripting commands into the xml dom?

The reason <script language="php"> doesn't work is because the browser 
doesn't know how to execute the code client-side, right?

The browser won't know what to do with <php:valueof 
name="param:id"></php:valueof>, either.

OTOH, if you mean to use this as an intermediate templating language or 
something, maybe passed to a client that might or might not be PHP-aware 
and able to execute the markup, I could see some value in it because you 
could (for example) selectively filter out the <php:include> tags from 
the rest of the document.

Seems like a lot of work unless you have a real defined need for it, though.

Yes you can't, but wouldn't it be cool if PHP were cliet side like the  
example below.  Then I wouldn't have to keep digging through JavaScript  books for 
client side manips.  In fact, I think a case could be made that  with the 
proper IDE, PHP could stand on its own as a very powerful programming  language, 
especially for DB integration.  PHP just seems to make so much  more practical 
sense, and it is fast - both of which I find lacking with  Java.  (I really 
don't like Java all that much, I used it for four years  before PHP, and when I 
started with PHP it was like FREEDOM!, compared with  Java.... oh well just  
my two cents. Perhaps, PHP 6 can have a client side  include and a compiler - 
that way I can do away with Java and its nasty little  brother JavaScript - 
this is not to mention .NET, I'm seemingly not smart enough  for it - or is it 
that I don't have the six months to understand how the 'Hello  World' program 
works, why it takes so much effort to get it to  work, and why .NET supposedly 
does it so much better - whatever  the case  :)

We needed this at Roadsend awhile back. I ended up implementing the 
formula in a MySQL extension (as a function) so we could do direct 
database queries on distance, based on zipcode/lat/long columns.

Not sure about attachments on the list, so I put the source up on the web:

http://www.roadsend.com/range.cc

The first commented line is the actual command I used to compile it. 
Included in the other comments is how you can load the function into the 
server.

Hope it helps.

Okay so before if you were a "PHP'er" you weren't a programmer but a 
script kiddie... Now if you're a PHP'er you're a programmer? And one 
more advanced than, say, Java component kiddies?

I love it. Just keep ignoring all this stuff and keep going... do what 
matters and do it with PHP.

I wrote this class that will get all zipcodes within a certain mile range.

http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/1640.html

It isn't so acurate when you get to extreme north and south locations 
due to the way longitude lines come together.  If you can't use the 
class as is, you should be able to pull out the query that you need. 
The class uses PEAR_DB so it is database independant.

Scott Mattocks

P.S. Sorry if this is the same as what others have posted. I have been 
away for a week and didnt' have time to reall all 300+ posts to this list.

and btw -- it is php5, using 'interface', 'implements', 'private', 
'public', _construct' etc... a good learning piece especially if 
network-aware apps interest you.

and it's running on FreeBSD -- i may have to dust off my FreeBSD stuff

Uggg I think I missed my point completely w/ this post ...

You can run <script language="php"> @ the server level now, I wasn't
talking about the client ... the idea was to build "components" to give
to page dev people ... I guess you'd have to work w/ Java OO to
understand it (yes it is alot of tedious work) and it is almost like a
Smarty approach except inline (you dont have to stuff variables and then
send to a page).

The Zend/zend_language_scanner.l seems to handle this workload ... im
sure it can be played around with to handle tags ... in fact I found an
old Zend post w/ similar idea ...

confirmed with authorize.net that they don't support this.

have the luxury (this time) of an open-source ticketing solution, but I

Expert suggestions?

Trustcommerce (www.trustcommerce.com)
You process the first payment like a normal transaction but tell them to 
store the information.  They give you back a billing id and that is all 
you need to bill that customer again.  It releases you from the 
liability of storing credit card numbers.  The transactions don't have 
to be scheduled either.  You can have it bill the first of every month 
if you want but you don't need to.  We use it in places where there is a 
limited interface for entering cc info.  We just verify the user and use 
the billing id that we have store to bill customers when they place orders.

Jon,

I see where you're going with this, you basically want to emulate a 
templating system which uses a system like Java's taglibs or, prior to 
that, ATG Dynamo's JHTML, so as to shield your presentation layer 
developers from business logic.  In particular you want to be able to 
create a bean (or the result of an included function) for use on the page. 
 For example, getting a user bean from the following type of tag:

<php:importbean type="user" src="inc/classes/User.php"
<php:bean name="currUser" type="user">
        <php:param name="id" value="34"/>
</php:bean> 

...

<php:valueof param="currUser.firstname"/> 


This type of approach is interesting, and I've never seen anyone try it 
[answer "a"], but there are other ways (like you mentioned, Smarty) to 
accomplish a similar goal [answer "b"]:

"A Tale of Three [Four] Templates"
http://nyphp.org/content/presentations/3templates/


But I tend to argue against it for several reasons... [answer "c"]

Nice work.. that topic needs this kind of helpful material.

I think it reads at a higher level than a fundamentals paper probably 
needs to.... I don't see a need for brevity with a fundamentals article, 
and by my read Notes 1,2,3,4, and 7 would serve the reader better placed 
right inline with the article (they are very relevant and also brief). 
That's up to you guys as publishers, but I think they are good comments 
and enhance the paper in-line.

I would suggest not getting into details of the apache error log and how 
to tail it. You can't assume where a given distro put the logs for the 
individual user, whether the ISP or admin set up common logs for all 
virtual sites  and uses delayed log-split jobs, or the admin uses 
combined logs, etc etc etc. Perhaps a mention of checking the Apache 
error log, and a link to all-about-apache-error-logs or a suggestion to 
find out from your ISP where your error log is, would be cleaner?

I have two nits, neither specifically directed at the content but the 
layout:

1) Many programming sites use a colored background for displaying source 
code inline, which is a tremendous visual aid - it visually separates 
text from code.  I would love to see this done here, and this article 
could really use it.  CSS is your friend!
2) There are many references to other parts of this article, "see note 
6" and such - couldn't those have some named anchors so it is easier to 
jump around in the document? This is HTML after all ;)

I like the article, and also agree that there might need to be some 
clarification of where the error logs might reside on different setups, 
but overall it is a good article.

I promise after this one I will shut up  :-)

Sending admin emails upon error catch - I don't consider this a good 
idea in general, although of course it is widely done and perhaps really 
only meant as an example. It is "open loop" in that a server problem or 
mail sending problem results in "no error reporting" - which simply 
hides the errors. IOW, if e-massages are not displayed, and email 
doesn't get sent, who knows there is a problem?

I would recommend the displayed error message tactfully inform the user 
the admins have been made aware of the problem, as you suggest, but I 
would also tell the viewer to contact the sysadmin if the error is not 
resolved promptly. I would provide an email addy for doing so - (a 
different one). Yes it is true you don't want the user to be the one who 
tells you there' a problem, but if that's the only way you'll find out, 
isn't that better than having the system remain dysfunctional? I doubt 
many users will contact the sysadmin unless it is down for a long 
time... or the boss browses the site and sees that message.

A few admin emails per second on the same database connect error is not 
really very helpful, especially if you're away for the day. Since 
exception handlers are expected to be called infrequently, why not make 
them smarter than that... if already sent in last few minutes, if 
semaphore is present/not present, if already 2 hours of the same 
problem, enable redirects to static pages, disable login with friendly 
maintenance message,  etc.... After all, if it's being done with PHP, 
why not make it smart (or suggest that you can do that?).

Not mant to be critical as much as constructive! Except for the 
un-search-engine-friendly-semantics of the name, I love the 
phundamentals program!

I would absolutely agree.   On a project I worked on late last year, we set
up an email for an error.  There was a var typo we missed that was caught by
the error handler.  The client made the site live before our final testing,
and 20 minutes later we got farked (as in fark.com).  15,000 error emails in
about 30 minutes, which the server wasn't too pleased about.

After that, I set log errors to 'on' and wrote a script to check the error
log every few minutes (via cron) and email if any 'new' errors arose (had an
flat file or db error cache which was cleared daily).

I like much of what is written. However, I wouldn't consider enabling
show_errors to be a bad practice in development. This is argued as
follows:

"Even in development, errors dumped to the browser are bad because they
can become hidden in the HTML."

I typically advocate ugly, obvious errors in development and tasteful,
hidden errors in production. I've worked with many developers, and I've
never known someone to overlook an error due to some invalid (or
incomplete, due to the nature of the error) HTML.

My suggestions, as far as php.ini directives, go something like this:

Development:
error_reporting = E_ALL
log_errors = Off
display_errors = On

Production:
error_reporting = E_ALL
log_errors = On
display_errors = Off
error_log = "/tmp/php_errors.log"

All of these can be set anywhere (PHP_INI_ALL). The article states that
the error log goes to one of two places, and neither of these mention that
this can be set with the error_log directive. I prefer my PHP errors to be
in their own file, but this comes down to personal preference.

This is a pretty rudimentary approach, but it's a good "least you can do"
approach that doesn't require much effort. Set a few PHP directives, and
you're off to the races.

There are different methods of dealing with error notification, and I'm
not an expert in this area, but I do think you would want your approach to
be out-of-band with your PHP code, since you don't want a million emails
describing the same problem. :-) I've been known to do something as write
a shell script that checks to see whether anything new is in the log, and
if so, email the difference (so, the backup is replaced each time the
script is run). Put this in your crontab, and run as often as you think is
appropriate.

I completely agree. PHP has the handy highlight_string() and
highlight_file() functions for this. I even set up a little utility for
myself recently, because I found that I can copy/paste from Safari to a
Word document, and it preserves the color (yes, I'm easily impressed).
It's here for any who want to play:

Wow.

Either your ISP has reached a new level of laziness, or I'm missing
something.

> Anyone know of a quick-and-easy way of telling the new ISP's box to

There may be better ways, but I'm sure you could use ForceType in a
.htaccess file:

ForceType application/x-httpd-php

(You may be able to just use AddType, but I'm just not sure if that can be
specified at a directory level.)

You'll probably want to limit this to specific files rather than an entire
directory, so you'll want to create a section in your file using
Directory, Files, or something like that. See here for a better
description of these things:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/sections.html

Hope that helps.

You're not missing anything, It's earthlink...

Thanks.  Still having trouble, but will look into the link you've provided
for clarification.

Wow.

Either your ISP has reached a new level of laziness, or I'm missing
something.

There may be better ways, but I'm sure you could use ForceType in a
.htaccess file:

ForceType application/x-httpd-php

(You may be able to just use AddType, but I'm just not sure if that can be
specified at a directory level.)

You'll probably want to limit this to specific files rather than an entire
directory, so you'll want to create a section in your file using
Directory, Files, or something like that. See here for a better
description of these things:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/sections.html

Hope that helps.

I was really curious as to why the /. article talked about PHP when it
was obviously primarily a mysql thing.

I believe you can add something like the following to an .htaccess file...

Thanks everyone.  I thought .htaccess was the way to go, and even had a
guess at the syntax (which everyone graciously confirmed), but I'm still
coming up empty.  Unfortunately, earthlink has been no help identifying
where the problem is.  They have assured me that AddType is not a restricted
directive in their .htaccess files.  If anyone else has a guess, would love
to hear it.

Thanks again,

I recall having the same problem with Earthlink back in 1996 with both  
php3 and .shtml. Something about there server config.. There was nothing 
we could do except call them .shtml and .php3 at that time.
(funny, I just looked at that old site and it is still online, with the 
same pages.. but not on Earthlink anymore....)

Oops, I think the correct URL is:

http://shiflett.org/code/color_code.php

It's just a call to highlight_string() for the data submitted, so it's
nothing exciting, but I use it fairly often. I wrote it for the the same
reason why I wrote an MD5 script - to have the utility always available to
me as long as I have a connection.

Can you show us these two things?

1. Your .htaccess (or just the relevant part).
2. The output of a grep for Options in the server's httpd.conf file.

If that second thing gives several lines, which it might, we will need to
see the section that identifies each one (e.g., which files it applies
to).

I think this might help us figure out why it's not working.

Apache and PHP come pre-installed on OS X, you just have to take a few 
steps to get things going.  I believe MySQL has to be installed, I 
haven't gotten around to that yet.

For Apache, just go into System Preferences and enable "Personal Web 
Sharing" (under Sharing.)  That will start the Apache server.
Here's a URL with more info:
http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2001/12/07/apache.html

For PHP, you just have to edit the Apache httpd.conf file to load the 
module.  I found this page to be a helpful reference point.
http://www.sanbeiji.com/tech/tutorials/php/index.php

The sanbeiji page also has a link regarding MySQL installation.  I 
haven't done that part yet.  If you do the install, I'd be interested 
to hear how it goes.

Isn't Mailman pretty good at handling email addresses, even in the body?

It seems to be, unless someone already manually edited this:

Quoting from "JSP technology -- friend or foe?"
At:
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/w-friend.html?
dwzone=web
BY Brett McLaughlin 

"JSP advocates are quick to let you know that JSP tag
libraries can help you avoid this problem"
[of mingling logic and presentation]...
"Tag libraries allow custom tags (for example, <AUTHORS />)
to be added to a JSP page, which at runtime are resolved
into code fragments in, well, tag libraries..."

" ...As long as JSP coding allows inline coding, it is very
convenient (especially when deadlines are looming) to make
last-minute changes with inline code, rather than converting
the code to a tag library..."

McLaughlin makes a pretty good argument against using JSP
tags in this article.

When someone doesn't use php.ini, same configuration can be done in

come on .. how many libraries actually start out *as* libraries? none ..
~ nearly everything starts out "inline".  im sure everything in pear was
the same way.  (i never stuck a <java> block in there because i knew id
get reemed the next day).  now if you were to say its pointless because
you can't always look-like a lib:

<?php include("mylib.php"); ?>
.. somewhere down the road ...
<?= doSomethingCool(); ?>

then i would have said ok :-) i think the point is pagedev not being
able to say "smells like code, looks like code, must be code" ..

i still think tag libraries are cool.

Yeah, but spam crawlers are getting quite smart.  For instance, blah at
blah.org can be detected.

I also write stuff like this, thanks to Knight's recommendation:

hans not junk at nyphp.com

The junk at nyphp.com get's gobbled up by the bots, but obviously it's ok
:)

and you didn't really want mail from the people who try to send it to 
junk at nyphp.org, anyway ;-)

In mailman change the hans at whatever.org to hans aht whatever doht org 
and you will be safe for a long time. Security through obscurity looms 
again.

But, of course, the main place bots get addresses is from "From" headers.  
So, what you do in the body isn't nearly as important.

With a little trial an error, you might be able to convert everything to .php4.
You can try something like this as a last resort:

    #!/bin/bash
    rename .php .php4 *.php
    perl -p -i.php -e 's/\.php/.php4/g' *.php4

It keeps backups for you, with the original name.  But you'd better keep
backups anyway just to be safe. ;-)

This is way OT, but can anyone point me to a good place to find a solid yet

development in AMP, but we're now looking to take over a project that was
written in asp/vbscript, and need somebody to help out.

Any ideas or recommendations would be much appreciated.

This is way OT, but can anyone point me to a good place to find a solid
yet affordable .asp/vbscript programmer? Our company has done all of our
development in AMP, but we're now looking to take over a project that
was written in asp/vbscript, and need somebody to help out.

Any ideas or recommendations would be much appreciated.

Thanks!

Crud.  I happen to have several years of [classic] ASP experience but 
telecommuting is not an option (or freelancing), I'm out of this one.

Message-ID: <1090339439.7612.49.camel@bezel>

First: Thanks to all of you who jumped at the chance to help out with
php-gtk. It really is gaining steam and a lot of people are getting
involved and people are taking notice.

For those of you involved, you are already aware of this post. For those
of you not involved or if you are interested in using php-gtk, here is a
letter to the community by the php-gtk primary developer.
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/php-gtk-general/2122551

Here it is below as aspn is slow as nails half the time.
Shows where things are going.

Look forward to an active and blooming community around php-gtk.
Cheers.

[PHP-GTK] Letter to Community 
by Andrei Zmievski 
Jul 20 2004 4:57AM 
Dear PHP-GTK community,

I have just read the extensive "what is going on with gtk.php.net?" thread
that Steph has brought to my attention and I have to say this: I'm sorry. 
It is apparent there is an impression out there that PHP-GTK has been
relegated to the convalescence home of dying open source projects. Mostly it
is my fault, as I have been absent from the scene for entirely too long. All
I can say in my defense is that in the last year I had moved to another
coast, switched jobs, started a new relationship, and have generally been
busy pursuing other interests. Hopefully, you've been in the same situation
and know what I am talking about. Might not be much of an excuse, but that's
all I have at the moment.

Steph, in her infinite patience, has possibly been the only person who has
been investing any significant amount of time into PHP-GTK by fixing
the docs, answering emails on the mailing lists, and poking me from time to
time to find out when I would be back. For that, I think we all owe her
a debt of gratitude. Without Steph, this project would be quite dead indeed.

But, let me also say this: PHP-GTK has not and will not be abandoned. It has
been made clear from the thread that there are a lot of people in the world
using it for things that I, frankly, could not have imagined when I started
tinkering with the code almost 4 years ago. And seeing the renewed interest
in the project with the release of PHP 5 I cannot help but be inspired by
the energy that is suddenly circulating through our little community.

So, what's to be done? Clearly, the documentation is lacking. Obviously, it
is an enormous effort to document all the classes and methods that PHP-GTK
inherits from GTK+ in addition to its own idiosyncrasies. Simply linking
back to GTK+ manual is not a solution as that manual itself is quite
incomplete. So, what seems to me to be a good approach is to invest some
time and effort into either fixing the current documentation system and
continuing the course or rebuilding it to use Livedocs. Whatever we do, we
should probably be compatible with the PHP documentation project to
facilitate reuse of tools and technologies.

Everyone says that PHP documentation is simply great, but how did it get to
be so great? Through efforts of regular users and developers who
self-organized into teams of documentors, administrators, user note
maintainters, etc. Of course, the PHP doc project consists of many people,
but I remember when there were only a few folks who even knew how to build
the docs. We are basically in the same position right now, but we have the
advantage of hindsight and can draw on the best practices of PHP docs team
as well as learn from their mistakes.

Website can also be improved. Ben Ramsey has offered to work on it, and
I couldn't be happier to hear that. It would be even better if we had 2 or
3 people maintaining the web site as there is a lot of good PHP-GTK and GTK+
information out there that the website simply does not link to. It is, after
all, supposed to be the central repository of all PHP-GTK knowledge.
Improving search, moving Wiki to be hosted on gtk.php.net, and implementing
a semi-regular news system would be something to do as soon as possible.
Beyond that, I will leave the ideas for how the website should function best
to those willing to work on it through collaboration and consensus.
Borrowing ideas from php.net, go-mono.com, and other sites should not be
viewed as a bad thing.

This may sound familiar, but I think that my personal strength lies in
developing code, rather than designing web sites or writing documentation.
So far I have been waiting for PHP 5/Zend Engine 2 API to stabilize, and now
that PHP 5 has been released, I believe I can re-start work on PHP-GTK
2. However, it is not going to be a straightforward port of PHP-GTK 1
because Zend Engine 2 offers much better ways to exploit the power of
object orientation and we can build a very slick interface to GTK+ if we
start from scratch. I am going to start thinking about it and posting RFCs
on the mailing list in hopes of soliciting feedback from users as to how
this interface can be best structured. Consider the connect() and
connect_object() functions (a source of much confusion apparently): There is
no reason that the second one needs to be called connect_object() aside from
the fact that that is what GTK+ uses. So, one of the first questions will
be, do we stick to GTK+ API rigidly or do we replace/rename some methods to
suit us better?

As far as project structure goes, perhaps we could have 3 loosely organized
teams: development, website, and docs, each one headed by an informal
leader. I nominate Steph for the docs team which will probably leader to her
kicking my virtual butt. :-)

Well, I'd better wrap up. The recent activity on the lists makes me think
that people are willing to contibute to the project. Of course, how much
time we can contibute is the biggest issue. No one can make you share your
time, effort, and goodwill except yourself. I just hope that the ant analogy
holds and piece by piece, grain by grain, we keep building this project up.
As Ben said, let's not let the interest die out, And to paraphrase JFK, ask
not what PHP-GTK can do for you, ask what you can do for PHP-GTK. The
project cannot die until the last one of us loses interest in it.

Talk to you all soon,

-Andrei

Message-ID: <75359449-DA7D-11D8-B1E2-000393B9FB36@mac.com>

As many of you already know I am almost as lazy as I am thirsty, so I 
tend to rely upon the ports to install & update my AMP environments. 
For those of you who haven't installed or upgraded recently, yesterday 
there was made a major change to the way things are done.  From

I went ahead and did a lang/php5-extensions install this morning on a 
server I was setting up and everything compiled fine, but the 
php_info() didn't list any of the extensions. After searching for way 
too long, I finally found the answer at

http://www.freebsdforums.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=23733
> "You have to add the extensions to php.ini, make sure the extensions 
> directory is listed, for php4 it is /usr/local/lib/php/20020429
> The default value in php.ini is ./ which doesn't work"

I commented out the extension_dir line instead of setting it to 
/usr/local/lib/php/20020429 and that worked as well
; Directory in which the loadable extensions (modules) reside.
; extension_dir = "./"

I've only done this with 5, but I'm pretty sure that's the way 4 works 
now as well....

Hey there:

Because every coding list needs a regex question every now and then, 
I thought I'd contribute and fill the quota.

I'm having a little personal struggle with replacing selected words 
in a long article which is in HTML.  I want to search for words and 
replace them with a link, but not if they are already inside a 
title="" attribute of a tag.

Don't need a complete solution, but some guidance would be 
appreciated, since my efforts are currently resulting in failure.

Cheers,

I would replace title="" with some other character comparator 
temporarily, a temp "swap" to prevent that particular occurrence of 
[a-zA-Z0-9\-_\.]+=["|']?[^"']*["|']? from pulling title="" with it.

That's off the top of my head.

Maybe a combination of preg_split/preg_match would do it.


//// ALL UNTESTED CODE....

$pattern = "/title=\".+\"/U";

$text = 'Howdy! This is a long string with some <tag
title="howdy">pieces</tag> in it...';


// Unzip the big string into alternate pieces...
$texts_array = preg_split( $pattern, $text);
               preg_match( $pattern, $text, $titles_array);

// Now $titles_array is an array of the pieces that match $pattern,
// and $texts_array  is an array of everthing else.

// Do soemthing with the pieces of text...
function user_func(&$value, $key) { 
   $value = <DO SOMETHING>; 
} 
array_walk( $texts_array, 'user_func' ); // do something with the pieces...


// Zip it back up
for( $i = 0; $i < count($texts_array); $i++) {
	$newString .= $texts_array[$i] . $titles_array[$i];
}

///////////////////////////////////////////////

You'd need to check (or force) that the $text doesn't begin with a match to
$pattern.

Essentially, this depends on _match and _split to be converses (?) of each
other -- the string comes apart like teeth in a zipper, then you process all
the teeth on one side, then zip it back up.


Hope that helps...

Hello Listies,

I have an instance method that returns an array. I want to access one piece
of the array and have tried these, only to get *parse errors*:

echo $myObject->littlePieces()[3];
echo ($myObject->littlePieces())[3];


What gives? if I assign to a temp variable first, it works:

$tmp = $myObject->littlePieces();
echo $tmp[3];

TIA!

Is this PHP 4 or PHP 5. I'm not surprised if it doesn't work in PHP
4. I think that should work in PHP 5, but I wouldn't swear to it.

Thanks again folks.  Unfortunately, the earthlink account does not come with
Telnet access, so I can't grep the server.  My htaccess file is as follows:

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .inc .php3 .php4

This does not work.  I'm thinking that they may have used a different mime
type for their php stuff?

Can you show us these two things?

1. Your .htaccess (or just the relevant part).
2. The output of a grep for Options in the server's httpd.conf file.

If that second thing gives several lines, which it might, we will need to
see the section that identifies each one (e.g., which files it applies
to).

I think this might help us figure out why it's not working.

That seems highly unlikely. Are you sure Apache is set up to read
.htaccess files? It can be disabled.

They tell me that it is.  I used the following directive in the htaccess to
specify the index page:

DirectoryIndex intro.php home.php index.html index.shtml index.cgi
index.phtml index.php3 index.htm home.html welcome.html

And they assure me that AddType is available to me.

You really need to talk to your host's support staff.  If they can't get 
things to work the way you want, get a real host.

I'd suggest having one item in there for a given directory.

And what permissions do you have on your .htaccess file?  It needs to be 
readable by the web server.  So, it should be world readable and may need 
to be group readable as well.

i dont see this working in 4 or 5 reason being is you have to have the
method return the array before you can actually access the elemnets so
$obj->method()[3] will not work you must assign it to a variable before
you can access it.  

i may be wrong but i think i am right, someone correct me if i am wrong
;)

Correct - .htaccess.  

I'm afraid that the support level at earthlink isn't sufficient enough to
trouble shoot or go any further.  Thanks everyone for your input.  Time for
plan B.

I thought having parentheses around an expression evaluated the 
expression? If so, maybe the problem is in the syntax of the square 
brackets. Maybe they will only parse correctly if they are preceded by 
a variable?

PHP 4 doesn't know what to do with this syntax but one of the changes in 
PHP 5 is to let you use the return value of a function without assigning 
it first.  If your function/method returns an object you can call 
methods of that object without assigning it to a variable first.
Ex: $obj->getOtherObj()->method();

While you can do that nice chaining with object methods in PHP 5, you 
can't do it with array indices.

This is OK in PHP 5:

<?php

class Stooge {
     private $name = null;
     public function __construct($name) {
         $this->name = $name;
     }
     public function getName() {
         return $this->name;
     }
}

function get_object() {
     return new Stooge('Moe');
}

print get_object()->getName();
?>

It prints "Moe". But this is not:

<?php
function get_array() {
     return array('Moe','Larry','Curly');
}


// these all are parse errors:
print get_array()[1];
print (get_array())[1];
print {get_array()}[1];

?>

David,

ok but why would they not allow array indices if they allow you to get
strings, integers, etc...

That's just the way the parser works. If a function or method returns an 
array, you have to assign the array before you can access an individual 
element of it.

You can also do this (in either PHP 4 or PHP 5):

list($stooge1,$stooge2,$stooge3) = get_array();

or even, this, which saves the variable assignment but makes your code 
harder to read:

list(,$stooge2,) = get_array();

If you're interested in hacking around, I think the place to start if 
you want to change this is about line 744 of 
Zend/zend_language_parser.y, where the syntax for when a "variable" can 
appear in a program is described. "base_variable_with_function_calls" 
can have an object operator ( -> ) after it, but not array dimension 
operators (square brackets).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] RDF parser in PHP?
Message-ID: <1090425594.22463.34.camel@bezel>

Just wanted to let you guys know about a RDF-DEV posting about a push
for RDF in PHP.
Here is the posting..
http://rdfweb.org/pipermail/rdfweb-dev/2004-July/013496.html

Any thoughts etc, I will pass them on.

I personally think they "want" a compile-time option in PHP (i.e.
"--with-rdfparser") but there is a lot of confusing things going on.
i.e.:
http://rdf.burningbird.net/archives/2004/07/creating-a-php-extension-out-of-redland-and-raptor/

Anyway, it should be intersting seeing how they are going to accomplish
this.

Yes, it's a grammar for YACC (actually Bison).

Modifying it is only useful if you want to add/alter operators or other 
language grammar. If your changes don't get merged into PHP, then you 
have quite a maintenance burden (not to mention incompatible code). But 
poking around is essential learning how PHP works under the hood.

If you want a sample of how it *might* be done in a php class, check out
RDFWorld.php:
http://chxo.com/rdfworld/index.htm

It converts RDF to PHP objects.

No,
an actual compiled extension (i.e compile PHP with `--with-rdfparse`
etc).. 
RAP (which your very cool program uses) is not an option because it is
too slow and the current state of FOAF (which this is mostly for) is
that there are 10,000 new FOAF's introduced each day just on Livejournal
alone...
RAP is slow for foaf files, because of all the interlinking, so a
compiled solution has to present itself.  
That is what they are pushing for.

Message-ID: <1090433456.40feb1b010a59@webmail.tuffmail.net>

Was reading a coding magazine today and came across the "HTTP Response
Splitting" attack, where a malicious user might try to pass newline characters
and HTTP headers into a Location: redirect by using a $_GET var with urlencoded
linebreaks.

PHP ( or maybe it's Apache? ) seems safe from this:

$redirect = "foo\nContent-length: 0\n\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n";
header( "Location: $redirect" );

The header() call above passes only "Location: foo" to the client, stripping all
the badness out of $redirect.

Hey gang,

Here is an interesting test done by one person, using the same 
os/hardware/software for everything except the CMS.  She tried several 
and noted the results.

http://forum.mamboserver.com/showthread.php?t=11782

Perhaps the most telling were that the CMSs that implemented page-level 
caching performed the best, and kept the lowest loads.

Something I have learned while doing my own testing is that using 
ADOdb's query cache (which caches on the webserver, not in the database 
like MySQL) provides significant performance benefits, UNLESS your 
webserver is working harder than the database machine, in which case it 
will actually hurt.

Just as a note (or to start a good-natured debate), the real problem 
with client-side caches is maintaining a consistent view in a 
multi-server environment.

http://www.sanctuminc.com/pdf/whitepaper_httpresponse.pdf  

Page 28 of the paper recommends:
"Validate input. Remove CRs and LFs (and all other hazardous 
characters) before embedding data into any HTTP response headers, 
particularly when setting cookies and redirecting."


http://shiflett.org/articles/foiling-cross-site-attacks/  

gives some good background on Cross-Site Scripting 
vulnerabilities and offers some ideas on how one 
might defend against them.

That's a good point.

At TVGrid.Com, we separated our data into two bins:

1) Data that was constantly being updates (such as membership info)

2) Data that was updated once per day (what's on tv tonight?).

That allowed us to implement a simple client-side SQL cache for bin #2
over multiple web server without too many worries.

Of course, I don't think we ended up hitting the cache too often
because our data was so spread out. People just didn't search for the
same thing all that often (and when they did, if they were in
differing locations, we returned different data, so we couldn't use
the cache.)

So that's another point to consider, the effectiveness of your cache
is directly related to your dataset and typical usage.

Message-ID: <40FED72C.9090904@att.net>

Anyone know if xdebug will work with Apache 2.0.x  (running latest XAMPP 
with PHP5 & apache 2.0.50 on a win2k pro box)
I got the latest php_xdebug.dll from  here: 
http://snaps.php.net/win32/PECL_UNSTABLE/ 
and I'm running the prebuilt binary debugclient ver 0.7.0 for windows I 
grabbed from xdebug.org

php.ini file:
[Zend]
xdebug.remote_enable = 1
xdebug_extension_ts="c:/path_to/php_xdebug.dll"

(phpinfo shows php was built with thread safety, hence the _ts)

I tried to get it working, but no joy -- won't connect to the client
thanks,
John

I don't think I enjoyed any advance CIS topic more than I enjoyed cache 
design. If you like the analytical thinking behind caching -- client 
side vs. server side vs. mysql level vs. apache level vs. php 
application level, page level, even RAM level, you should look into the 
field of cache design and management. It is not only interesting and 
extremely practical, but there is alot of room to play with some good 
tools and plenty of room to make contributions from the sysadmin level 
through the Ph.D. level.

Improving cache utilization is probably the most powerful way to improve 
performance....

In addition to adding the XDEBUG_SESSION_START var to the URL that you 
mentioned in your other message, you need to tell xdebug to connect to 
debugclient on a different port.

Xdebug 2 defaults to port 9000, but the binary debugclient 0.7.0 
defaults to port 17869. So add this to your php.ini:

xdebug.remote_port=17869

The xdebug stuff doesn't have to be in the "[Zend]" section of php.ini, BTW.

Do you see xdebug listed in phpinfo() output? (whether or not remote 
debugging is working)

thanks David, that should do it-- I knew about 17869 but xdebug 2 using 
port 9000 is news...

I usually end up putting it just below all of the extension lines that 
load various extensions, but that's just because I'm lazy. :)

If xdebug doesn't show up in phpinfo() output, then you're definitely 
not going to get any remote debugging. Do you have a debug build of PHP? 
  If so, you need to use zend_extension_debug_ts in php.ini instead of 
zend_extension_ts.

What happens when you run php.exe -m from the command line?

while I'm off doing a few other things like eating dinner... have you or 
anyone else run xdebug with php5 and apache 2?   I think all the 
variables were covered, especially when you mentioned xdebug 2 using 
port 9000-- that was the only glitch I saw.  From looking at the 
xdebug.org mailing lists, it looks like xdebug2 has been working fine 
with php5, but I saw no mention of apache 2 anywhere.  And I'm not too

Yes -- My setup is Apache 2.0.49 with PHP 5.0.0 on WinXP. Apache invokes 
PHP via FastCGI.

This is sad but true -- especially with the Java 
programmers I come in contact with.

They say things like "Don't spend time on a generalized solution 
before you need it."

Also mention is made that they are using an 'Extreme Programming' 
methodology.

Maybe I don't 'get it', but this methodology seems to me not to be 
'Extreme Programming' but rather extremely bad programming -- 
just coding without thinking first and without regard to a 
thought out library.

I like that extreme programming pairs programmers.. I have never seen 
anything so purifying as asking two programmers to work together on 
every line of code, on the fly.

As for avoiding generalizing until it is required... that may simply be 
a response to 15 years or so of building bloated C++ libraries that only 
C++ library programmers could really use... not unusual to see a 
rubberbanding after all that wasted "efficiency".  Also, with at least 
two knowledgeable programmers in tune with every line of code, perhaps 
there is less of a risk of forgetting how it works (?) -- so it can be 
packed into a lib later.

Ah yes, the old we'll refactor it later ('packed into a lib later') -- 
very similar to we'll document that later.

XP is a software engineering methodology that removes dependencies in
your code and places them upon your developers.

The only reason you're allowed (required) to write the simplest code
possible is that you're required to refactor it mercilessly. Failing
to do the second invalidates the first.

Also, the only reason you can safely refactor the code is that you've
written a complete suite of unit tests. Failing to write tests causes
you to be unable to safely refactor, which leads to ugly code, etc,
etc.

As you can see, many parts of XP are tightly wound and interdependent
upon themselves. You can't remove one without placing stress on the
entire framework.

IMHO, this is the largest irony of XP.

If I understand refactoring, it means to rearrange your classes and 
methods so that common code is more easily inherited from or delegated 
to with the goal removing duplicated code (or code which expressed 
another way -- but with identical meaning -- would be a duplicate).

I am under the impression that the goal is to achieve some sort of 
'ne plus ultra' state with no (or very little) duplication of code so 
that you can enhance a routine in just one place (since it is not 
duplicated anywhere else -- or hardly anywhere else).

Mixed in with the methodology is also a concept of delivering 
working pieces of code early. And from what I can make of the 
reasoning behind this is that once users use the working 
pieces, they may change their mind about what they want the 
final system to do.

And so it would seem that one of the lines of reasoning which 
argues for this way of doing things is that you can avoid wasting 
time creating a 'wrong' design initially -- and you should (to some 
degree) discover what the design is, and the design may be changing 
along the way, from building working parts of the system.

In theory I guess this could work. But it strikes me that if the 
deadline for delivering the system overtakes you, you might run 
the risk of delivering a system into production without much of a  
coherent design -- though you would have avoided an initially 
wrong design.

The result would be an awkward system where developers 
would have to memorize the places where pockets of code must updated 
together -- of course this is  something which can happen anyway when 
you do things the 'old fashioned' way.

I will be the first to admit that I don't fully comprehend this method. 
But it just strikes me as fraught with danger -- maybe that's why it 
is called 'Extreme'

When you get the http referer tag, it will include the full URL of the
page you came from. Google search result pages include your search
term in the URL.

So to highlight the google search terms on a page, grab that referer
tag, find the search terms, then highlight them on your page
(str_replace($search_term, "<span
class=highlight>$search_term</span>")).


i think that should work

To confirm that the site in question is using referrer strings, turn 
them off and see what happens. Open everyone's favorite browser (and the 
crowd shouts "firefox"), and type this into the address bar:

about : config

Hit <enter> and you should get the Firefox configuration system (and the 
crowd goes oooooooo-aaaaahhhhhhh.!!!!!)

In the filter box, put                refer

to see referer settings.  Set the "send referer header" parameter to 0 
(mine was defaulted to "2" after a basic Firefox install, but YMMV).  
That will block sending of referrers.

Re-visit the site in question and see what happens.

Note that many sites will lose functionality and some won't service you, 
if you turn off referrer strings. If you want to test it, go to any of 
those privacy screening tests (heres one: 
http://www.pcflank.com/browser_test3.htm) and see if it passes the 
"referer check".

(I can't resist opportunities to introduce people to Firefox's config 
system.... it's so cool)

The whole idea of a final "deadline" is an artificial concept. In XP,
you've delivered a working (but incomplete) version much sooner than
you would under the classic waterfall model.

At that point, any future iterations are just further refinements of
the working system. These releases fix whatever deficiencies are
identified by your clients in the existing program and add whatever
the clients say are the most important features to add at the current
time.

The danger is reduced because you always have a deliverable
product. With short release cycles building on top of a working
system, you can never get too bogged down into a morass of unworkable
pieces.

This lessens risk because you don't have the potential to program for
six months and end up with a system that doesn't compile or is so
unusable that you need to throw it away and start from scratch.

Perhaps a more realistic example would be a system that, at deadline, 
still needs XXX hours of work *in order to be launched*. With XP you 
should be able to launch your last release at any time, since it passed 
testing already.

This is actually handled in the lexer, btw.  Look for 
T_OPEN_TAG/T_CLOSE_TAG in zend_language_scanner.l.  The actual changes 
you need to make there should be moderately obvious.  As Dave noted, 
besides hacking around for your own enjoyment and education, adding 
alternative open tags to PHP (which would probably never be accepted 
into the language) just puts a huge maintenance and portability problem 
on you.

Hey everyone... I have a contract pending to do a big job, and at the last  
minute PHP/Oracle was scrapped for .NET/MSSQL.  So I am looking for some  good 
.NET Internet developers with database integration, authentication through  
Active Directory, and some media serving (real player, etc.)  I am the lead  
project manager.  The project will begin in mid-September and go through  Jan 
2005.  If you're interested drop me an email, and if you a resume/links  that 
would also be very helpful to show to my boss.  Please also  include your rate on 
a weekly or monthly basis.
 
I would prefer local NYCers but I think I will need at least 3-4  
programmers, so a couple of telecommuters could probably work.  Most of the  work can be 
done from your office/home, however we will all get together  periodically for 
meetings and to address issues.  The client is a  multibillion dollar 
organization located in the heart of Manhattan.  Also,  if you happen to be a great 
PHP'r and .Net'r, I would really like to hear from  you... that way I can tell 
you how I would do it in PHP and you can translate  for me. :)  (I am actually 
pretty good at .NET but after spending a couple  of months in PHP, going back 
seems, well, ya know... (I am not the biggest fan  of .NET, but their 
advertising must work for the big COs)
 
Thanks
Lee Eyerman

rather than start a new topic:

I got xdebug2 working with a remote_port change to 17869 after rebooting 
and reinstalling XAMPP on my notebook.  Had to turn off the Zend 
Optimizer as I discovered xdebug cannot run with another zend 
extension.  Also, in downloading a fresh php_xdebug.dll from 
win32/PECL_UNSTABLE I ran into an "API mismatch" problem, so the fresh 
reboot and fresh XAMPP install solved that.  So, I'm running with PHP5, 
Apache2.0.50, xdebug2 (ver 2.0.0 dev) on a win2k pro box. 

Once the debugclient connected, I got to a (cmd) prompt only after 
setting a breakpoint to {main}, and then typing "run".  Setting a 
file:line breakpoint didn't work for me, although a show-breakpoints 
said the file:line break had been set ok.   I could not reach another 
breakpoint in my small test script even though I had set one and typed 
"continue" after breaking at {main}.  e.g. break xdebugtest.php:5 -- and 
show_breakpoints indicated that breakpoint was set.  Other cmds, like 
"eval", "step", "next" worked fine.  The "list" cmd seemed a little 
flaky to me, but after psyching it out, e.g. "list 2 5" worked ok.  
Sometimes typing just "list" would not output anything as if the "list 
counter" didn't have anything else to display (xdebugtest script is 12 
lines).  Your xdebug section in the PHP Tools book helped a lot.  It 
would be nice if xdebug(2) allowed a cmd that showed the current php IP, 
like "show-current".   I did not find any way to set a variable, only 
examine it -- can you confirm this?

Moving on, the only way I could get a breakpoint other than {main} to 
work was to add an "xdebug_break()" call in my script.  That worked just 
fine and a "bt" showed the xdebug_break() and the {main} break.  
"show-local" worked as advertised, but when looking at phpinfo(), 
"xdebug.show_local_vars" directive was "Off". hmm.....  BTW, I did find 
a reference to port 9000 in the DBGP docs.

thanks for all your help,
John

By "solves a lot of issues" do you mean those involved with having a 
computer doing character recognition on the image itself?

I trust you're familliar with the technique of a cracker bot taking your 
CAPTCHA and serving it up on some other high-traffic website where some 
unsuspecting person enters the value which the cracker bot then submits to 
your site.  It doesn't look like that's addressed here.

Either way, can you elaborate on the steps you took?

Thanks,

Hey,
Are you talking about how to keep crackbots out? or how to crack one one
of these?
I have done a lot of work in cracking captcha's (and have published code
all over about it).
The main issue here with this one is the random line(s) and the opacity.
The random line (rand start/end, thus angle) often cuts through letters
which is one of the biggies in captcha hacking. If the lines are
vertical/horizontal/angular but always are started and ended at an edge,
we can remove them easily while at the same time preserving the portions
which are letters (it is a greedy system where abberations to the side
limit pixel removal, it can make spots, but those can be smoothed out by
despeckling).
I would venture to say that the only captcha's I have not been able to
bot-crack are the ones using insane angular, and or curved, specialty
fonts. However, if I could find the font itself, I could build a map of
them fairly quickly, so a lot of the issue is training gocr with various
font files and feeding the image through. So if I have gocr trained with
the font(s), basically for the angular or curved captchas you spin the
image both ways 180 degrees (360 total, and no captcha expects people to
flip the image upside down) keeping track of the order you find the
letters and at that point a spellchecker with 'suggest-a-word' such as
pspell can do the rest for the ones that use dictionary words.

That being said:
You "best" defense is random characters, strange intermingled
(multiple)fonts that overlap each other with various opacity while at
the same time being distorted and curved with random wiggly or curved
lines slicing through the whole thing. 

However, at that point if an actual AOL user could figure it out I would
be surprised. :)

If you want code, poke around in the archives for this list I had a
large post full of functions for doing this stuff.

Thanks for the minutia. XDebug ackowledges incompatibility with any  
(other?) Zend extensions, but seems to suggest the problem may be 
surmountable. I wonder about that... Is there a fundamental reason why a 
PHP debugger could not function alongside the Zend Optimizer ?

I haven't seen any profilers claim compatibility with Zend optimizer, 
and two that specifically state they are *not* compatible with Zend 
extensions (I understand there's extra work involved in making an 
extension compatible with other Zend extensions, and to get the order 
right, but wonder if itis perhaps not possible to profile with the Zend 
optimizer running?)

from xdebug.org/install.php page:
"COMPATIBILITY

Xdebug does not work together with the Zend Optimizer or any other Zend 
extension (DBG, APC, APD etc). This is due to compatibility problems 
with those modules. We will be working on figuring our what the problems 
are, and of course try to fix those."

so, it looks like it's on a TODO list...

www.ibill.com will do this, but they are horrible.

I mention them solely so that should you come across them one day, you
will stay away. The entire system is backwards, changing price points
involves creating a new account, you can't change the payment page,
its just horrible.

That's funny, the rep guy didn't mention this when I talked to him. 
I'll call again, but I don't think it's what I'm looking for. I need to 
store a credit card number so that the customer can get charged 
whenever they make an order. It's not really a recurring order. I 
imagine authorize.net has a setup where the customer authorizes a fixed 
monthly payment or something like that. But I'll verify this.

thanks,
Jose

Subject: [nycphp-talk] $_SESSION, session_unset(), unset($_SESSION['var']),
 register_globals and the PHP Manual
Message-ID: <410157AB.4020305@adnet-sys.com>

What do they all have in common?  None of them provide for me a clear, 
concise methodology for unsetting a single $_SESSION variable!

In my original code I have a class method that, at the end, does a 
"cache clear" by removing a $_SESSION variable:

unset($_SESSION['mainDisplay']);

This works fine in on the one server with PHP 4.3.2 with 
register_globals off

However, on the other server with PHP 4.3.6 with register_globals on the 
$_SESSION variable persists anyway.  On the PHP Manual I read about 
session_unset(), but that removes all session variables, which I clearly 
do not want to do with this particular class method (I only want to 
remove $_SESSION['mainDisplay'] and nothing more).

What is the best-coding-practice method to remove a single $_SESSION 
variable, whether register_globals is on or off?

Thanx
Phil

Did this include PHP 4.3.6 as well?

I was told that you cannot change the value of an autoglobal in a 
function or method with register_globals on and expect to retain that 
change upon exit, you'd have to globalize the autoglobal before you exit.

unset($_SESSION);
if ((int)ini_get('register_globals')) === 1) global $_SESSION;

Oops I meant:

unset($_SESSION['myVar']);

That doesn't make any sense.  A global's scope is global.  If your 
changes don't affect the variable in the global scope then it isn't a 
really a global is it?  I have a hard time believing that in 4.3.6 a) 
$_SESSION is not a global and/or b) the value of register_globals has 
any effect on the way unset() works.

I don't think that the PHP version or the state of register_globals is 
your problem, but you could check the change log to see what has changed 
between the two versions.

I read the change logs in PHP 4.3.2 vs PHP 4.3.6 in the PHP manual and 
it was hard to follow.  Therefore, I did a hack and it worked:

[PHP]
if ((int)ini_get('register_globals') === 1) ini_set('register_globals', 
false);
session_cache_limiter();
session_start();
// REST OF CODE
[/PHP]

A little over 10 years ago after leaving McDATA Corp. here in Colorado 
where I worked as a [maintenance] software engineer I made a phone call 
to one of the company's founders.  His name is Bruce Walsh, retired and 
playing golf now probably.  Well, Bruce was one of the sharpest tech 
people I've ever known and I worked with him from time-to-time on some 
pretty hairy IBM Channel and SNA software timing problems.  He wrote the 
channel code, the kernel, and was principal architect as well as mentor 
to many of the engineers.  I maintained the SNA code along with LAN &
WAN (SDLC) subsystems.
So much for the background.  What I called him about was to thank him 
for the times he helped me and for not making fun of the fact that I'm 
slow and have to struggle through information.

I'm 58 years old now and I will never forget Bruce's kindness and 
condescension.

There's a lot of sharp people on this list and I sure appreciate them. 
Then there's the rest of us :)

I especially like the last part of the abstract of the cited paper:

"Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus 
increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the 
limitations of their abilities."

In other words, the more you know, the more you know you don't know. 
Sounds right to me.

I just saw this to, linked from the article Baer posted.

Hot stuff (from a proof-of-concept and reading-good-code perspective).

is pre-packed with XAMPP?

they have version 4.0.20 and i would like to upgrade to 4.1

also anyone here used the SQLite extension?  Is this better to use than
MySQL?

Don't know anything about XAMPP.

This can be a tricky upgrade, as you need to either use mysqli or pass
a special flag to the MySQL server to ensure the mysql extension works correctly.

The are totally different beasts. SQLite is an embedded database
library. MySQL is a database server.

SQLite isn't a separate program, like MySQL is. This has advantages
(installation, set up, speed in some instances), and disadvantages
(access control, replication, speed in some instances).

Hello,

Below is some code that writes input from a form to a MySQL DB.  It was running fine until I added the email function seen at the end.  Now this does not write to the DB, but the email is getting sent.  Any ideas why?

Thanks

$connect = mysql_connect($host, $user, $pass);

 

//insert string for first table

 

$today = date('M d Y');

$table_name = 'logon';

 

//create query string to insert data into table

 

$query = "INSERT INTO $table_name (today, fname, lname, address, city, state, zip, email, password, passCheck, passQuestion, passAnswer) VALUES ('$today', '$fname', '$lname',

'$address', '$city', '$state', '$zip', '$email', '$password', '$passCheck', '$passQuestion', '$passAnswer')";

(I left out all the print statements where it was printing the info back to the form)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ASP .NET Job

=20

Hey everyone... I have a contract pending to do a big job, and at the
last minute PHP/Oracle was scrapped for .NET/MSSQL.  So I am looking for
some good .NET Internet developers with database integration,
authentication through Active Directory, and some media serving (real
player, etc.)  I am the lead project manager.  The project will begin in
mid-September and go through Jan 2005.  If you're interested drop me an
email, and if you a resume/links that would also be very helpful to show
to my boss.  Please also include your rate on a weekly or monthly basis.

=20

I would prefer local NYCers but I think I will need at least 3-4
programmers, so a couple of telecommuters could probably work.  Most of
the work can be done from your office/home, however we will all get
together periodically for meetings and to address issues.  The client is
a multibillion dollar organization located in the heart of Manhattan.
Also, if you happen to be a great PHP'r and .Net'r, I would really like
to hear from you... that way I can tell you how I would do it in PHP and
you can translate for me. :)  (I am actually pretty good at .NET but
after spending a couple of months in PHP, going back seems, well, ya
know... (I am not the biggest fan of .NET, but their advertising must
work for the big COs)

=20

Thanks

The mail function isn't in the if-else construct, so it'll get sent no
matter what.  Are you getting any errors?  Maybe
http://php.net/mysql_error <http://nyphp.org/mysql_error>  would help to
let you know if there's another DB issue at hand.

Hello,

=20

Below is some code that writes input from a form to a MySQL DB.  It was
running fine until I added the email function seen at the end.  Now this
does not write to the DB, but the email is getting sent.  Any ideas why?

Thanks

//insert string for first table

$today =3D date('M d Y');

$table_name =3D 'logon';

//create query string to insert data into table

Okay. In that case my answer is SQLite is better than MySQL in some
instances and worse in others. :)

In many ways this is a somewhat vague question because you haven't
qualified your question with the type of application you're trying to
develop.

SQLite is better:
  * When your application requires a database and you can't depend on
one being installed.
  * When you have mostly read only data.
  * When you want triggers.
  * When you want typeless fields.
  * When you want to write custom UDFs in PHP.
  * When you don't want to worry about the GPL.

MySQL is better:
  * When you have lots of reads mixed in with writes.
  * When you need access control, such as what's done using the GRANT command.
  * When you need replication.
  * When you want to communicate using SSL.
  * When you want typed fields.
  * When want to chose a GPL product.
  * When you want paid support.

SQLite and MySQL both have subselects and transactions.

Adam,

thanks for this clarification.

so if i was going to develop a 3rd party script i should use sqlite
since i cannot gurantee the end user will have access to mysql, although
all hosts i have seen offer mysql, i guess sqlite is only good when you
dont do much writing to the database and only reading, in that case i
will stick with mysql for most of my projects ;)

Not sure... certainly doable, I'd imagine, but you'd probably be getting
into the realm of installing a separate MySQL instance on the box and
disabling that which comes with XAMPP.

Be careful here... there's a major difference between the two.  Chances
are, your code will break.

MySQL 4.1.x uses a new binary protocol, and requires the
http://php.net/mysqli extension to work.  You can set MySQL to be
backwards compatible, but then you'll miss the benefits of the binary
protocol (prepared statements, no escaping, etc).

It really depends what you need.  In a word (and disclaimer: I work for
MySQL :)  SQLite isn't a RDBMS.  It's strictly a local file-system based
SQL system; it's truly a SQL enabled file system.  MySQL allows users to
connect remotely, has much more functionality, and is much faster as
load scales up.  If your application has any significant load,
especially that of write-queries, you should go with MySQL.  MySQL is
also very common on hosting platforms (more so than SQLite).

I've done exactly this on a number of occasions, but switching to 4.1 
wasn't one of them :)

Yeah, what Adam and Hans said...

Here's a few snippets from a program that I added SQLite support to--you 
can compare some of the statements. For example, there is no 
'fetch_object' in SQLite so I had to CAST it to an object before I could 
use it, etc.


// this function only used for escape in uploaded images
function escape_data($data, $size = 0)
{
     switch ($this->db_type) {
         case 'mysql':
             $escaped_data = addslashes($data);
             break;
         case 'sqlite':
             $escaped_data = sqlite_escape_string($data);
             break;
     }
     return $escaped_data;
}


// here's the CAST I mentioned above
function fetch_object($result, $row = '0')
{
     switch ($this->db_type) {
         case 'mysql':
             return mysql_fetch_object($result);
         case 'sqlite':
             if (sqlite_has_more($result)) {
                return (object)sqlite_fetch_array($result, SQLITE_ASSOC);
             } else {
             return FALSE;
             }
     }
}


// and a piece of some error code
function sql_error($query = FALSE)
{
     global $admin_email;

     switch ($this->db_type) {
         case 'mysql':
             $this->sql_error_number = mysql_errno($this->link_id);
             $this->sql_error_name = mysql_error($this->link_id);
             break;
         case 'sqlite':
$this->sql_error_name=sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($this->link_id));
         break;
     }


{Adjusted a few indents to not wrap the code}

Of course this means don't just mysqlhotcopy or mysqldump a working app 
and expect to import back into 4.1 after the upgrade (doh!). Unless you 
like major headaches under pressure.

Message-ID: <1f0.26110344.2e345b28@aol.com>

 
I believe in order to put the from information, you need to build the  
Headers properly before sending using the mail command.
 
I.e.. Usually I will use $FromName and pass it to the $headers along with  
other stuff.  I just keep .= the $headers and send them with the mail  command. 
See below.
 
$headers="From: ".$FromName." <".$FromName.">\n"; 
mail ($email,  $subject, $message, $headers);  

I have always built complex headers for emails out of PHP for a bunch of  
reasons.  I never saw this before: 

mail($email, $subject, $body, "From: $from");  I don't think you  can just 
stick the From at the end - I am pretty sure I went down this  exact path about 
a year ago - but who can remember.
 
Good info on email headers and building them:

Hello,
 

 
Below is some code  that writes input from a form to a MySQL DB.  It was 
running fine until I  added the email function seen at the end.  Now this does not 
write to the  DB, but the email is getting sent.  Any ideas  why?

Alternatively, you could use PEAR DB or a similar abstraction
layer. Daniel took over ownership of PEAR DB so his product could
reliably use whatever database his customers were using, whether it
was MySQL, Oracle, or whatever.

Also note that SQLite should be available on every PHP 5
installation. The library is bundled with PHP 5 and the extension is
enabled by default, so you need to go out of your way to not have
it. :)

In response to Hans's reply, I generally agree with most of what he
said. However, my one minor nit-pick is that as long as your traffic
is read-only (or largely reads, with occasional writes), SQLite may be
a better choice regardless of your traffic volume.

For instance, php.net uses SQLite to power the "Notes" section of the
PHP Manual. I would say php.net probably has more traffic than your
usual Web site. Additionally, SQLite 3.0 (now in beta) should be even
better in this regard as it reduces its locking window during
writes. (According to the SQLite Web site; I haven't actually run
SQLite 3.0 personally.)

Also, as I said earlier, you can bundle SQLite with a product without
paying any fees. While I know MySQL, AB now has a FOSS exemption to
its GPL license, I don't believe you can sell a commercial application
that uses MySQL 4.1 or greater as its backend without buying a
commercial license from MySQL, AB.

Actually, I think the issue is somewhat vague, as the current position
seems to depend on whether MySQL is an integral part of your
application.

I'm sure if I am wrong, Hans (or Zak) will correct me. I'm not trying
to spread any FUD here, but I want to let people know that there have
been some licensing changes in newer versions of MySQL that could
affect them and it's something they need to consider.

In light of some recent discussion about a Python user group in NY, I
talked with some folks about getting something going for Python
programmers.

Since Python is part of the LAMP stack, we've created a Python SIG at
New York PHP.

http://nyphp.org/content/mailinglist/mlist.php

http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/python


It's not a full blown user group, but it's a start.  Anyone is of course
welcome to join and discuss.

Also, anyone is welcome to contact me to get involved in organizing the
SIG and events.  New York PHP will help however it can with resources,
servers, etc.

Selling a commercial app that uses MySQL is no problem.  However, to
distribute MySQL itself, a license or participation in the VAR program
is required.  This is true for both client libs and the server itself.

The exception to this is if the application is GPL.  If the application
is publicly released under the GPL, then the GPL version of MySQL can be
distributed with it.  This, however, isn't generally an issue, since
most applications don't bundle a database.

It comes down to whether you include any MySQL code with your
application or not.  If MySQL client or server parts aren't included,
then there are no licensing fees.  However, the end user of your
application - assuming it's not GPL - will need a commercial MySQL
server license.

At the end of the day, MySQL is released under two licenses; the GPL and
our commercial license.  We basically work in a "quid-pro-quo"
methodology.  That is, if you write an application that isn't GPL, want
to distribute client or server parts of MySQL, or otherwise make money
from MySQL's code in a non-GPL manner, the commercial license must be
used.

http://www.mysql.com/products/licensing/


We protect open source development and bundling MySQL with open source
projects, like PHP.  This is protected by the FOSS exception.

This is what concerns me long term, as apps that appear open source on 
the surface are actually some sort of hybrid shareware/proprietary mix.

Not to sound like Stallman, but if it ain't GPL/LGPL, then it ain't Open 
Source(TM).  And if it ain't really free (as in free speech, not just 
free beer) then it should not try to appear like it is.  This may not be 
MySQL's fault, but is definitely a critical factor that businesses 
wishing to leverage open source technologies should be aware of.

If I feel like writing my own CMS, and at the end (say, a year later) 
decide to sell it - then I am now at the mercy of MySQL's licensing 
scheme instead of my own.  That's not freedom.  And if someone sells a 
commercial product that requires your application, then you should have 
an opportunity for paid support as a result.  Why complicate licensing 
when the revenue would be better on the support side?

And although I am a PostgreSQL bigot, this is not a dig at MySQL - many 
other 'open source-like' projects are also taking this disturbing stance.

In my view everyone should understand the free-beer vs free-software 
argument. It is core to the future of open source technologies and the 
benefits we have all enjoyed.

Free beer is not free - it is given to you so you will enjoy the beer 
and buy more beer and more beer. It is given to you so you will relax, 
and be more easily influenced. It has a catch, a hook, an ulterior 
objective. That is free-as-in-beer, free-as-in-cigarettes, etc. 
Free-as-in-speech is intended to mean truly free of further obligation 
or risk. Of course I can't say it as well as others, but others aren't 
explaining it here ;-)

Were it not for Open Source technologies (like PHP) training would be an 
even larger business than it is, and you all would need very large 
budgets in order to be so productive and innovative as you are. You 
would not enjoy such freedom from supervision and management as you have 
now - I suspect that if you are younger than 30 years old you may not 
have a grasp of this. Open Source has created a whole new world of 
maverick technologists innovating.... the traditional business world 
hates that. It's upsetting. It's "disruptive". It takes profits away 
from the owners.

I would add that from what I have seen, Microsoft can stop fighting and 
wait for the OS world to complicate itself out of its competitive 
advantage. We are past the point where the average business person can 
feel comfortable with OS licensing. The case for proprietary software 
has just about returned from the value, performance, and innovation 
space, and is settling back into the "nobody ever got fired for buying" 
space (substitute "sued" for "fired"). Corporate limited liability is a 
powerful thing - safer means better, in many cases.

Once that shift starts happening, how do OS companies hedge their bets 
to protect their futures? By preparing for the proprietary commercial 
space (however distasteful it might be). Can they do that with 
free-as-in-beer licenses? Nope.

Hi there:

Can anyone tell my why I would get this error:

Warning: fwrite(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource 
in Warning: fclose(): supplied argument is not a valid stream 
resource in

when the script is in fact opening and writing out the file just fine?

here's my file handling calls, just for reference:

// output the file
$output_h = fopen($output_path,"w");
fwrite($output_h,$output);
fclose($output_h);


This is happening on a new server I just moved to, and doesn't happen 
on my old server, nor did it happen on my old server.  Must be some 
kind of configuration thing...

 From the outset it might be due to a permissions issue.  If PHP (under 
your web server) has no permissions to open the file, that would throw 
your error.  Check your file permissions as well as the group setting, 
and make sure Apache (or whatever web server you're using) has the same 
rights to that file as you (or whatever user).

Are you %100 certain about the file 
being written to?

Hou did you assign the variable 
$output_h?

The code was:

// output the file
$output_h = fopen($output_path,"w");
fwrite($output_h,$output);
fclose($output_h);

If you assign the variable $output_path 
like thie:

$output_path = 'test.txt';

the code snippet will work.

You can use is_resource($output_h) to make 
certain the resource got created.

Perhaps you misspelled the variable name 
$output_path --
Try $Output_path = 'test.txt'; 
and compare the results.

(sorry if you are asking a different

Assuming you're referring to xampp, yes, it seems there's no python 
addon for the linux flavor, but they just added java stuff for windows 
-- apache tomcat and cocoon...

Speaking of assuming, I pretty much assume a linux (or FreeBSD) user 
will be able to go out and get what they want and build it.  For 
example, when I teach LAMP, even tho it's an introductory-level series, 
I have them build a custom kernel, build apache, build php, etc.  What I 
don't have them do is build mysql.

Hi there:

The file path is correct.

I know that the PHP script is creating the files, because I have 
deleted all the files, and they get created.  So, yeah, I'm 100% 
certain of that.  This also validates the prior point, about the path.

The PHP parser is giving me the warning even though it is creating 
the files...how and why can it do this?

I mean, I could suppress its output by prepending the '@' sign, but 
I'd like to be notified of REAL issues in the script...

This is often a file-handle-passed problem. Show us the the code where 
you assign $output_path, and why not $output as well to be thorough.

The ability to create a file and then write to it are two different 
animals because of permissions, and specifically, "umask".  The value in 
umask determines the default permissions for new files created on the 
system.  (we're talking *nix here)

To make things interesting, umask works as an octal complement.  All 
this means is that a value of umask such as "022" will be subtracted 
from the default permissions mask for files (666) yielding a "644".  In 
this case, the owner would have read/write permissions, but anyone in 
the associated group and the rest of the world would have read 
permissions.   "OGW" -- Owner, Group, World  owner="6"; group="4"; world="4"

PHP has filesystem functions that allow you to change the permissions 
here:  (chmod)

http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.chmod.php

there's a few examples that are handy.

HTH,
John

Hi:

To John:

It's creating directories inside a directory that is chmod 777.  Into 
each directory is placed an HTML file, which is created in the code 
below.  Therefore, all of the directories and files involved are 
owned by the script that is being run (user: apache, grp: apache), 
since the files didn't even exist in the first place.  And it's 
definitely writing to the file, because the contents of the files are 
there.

To inforequest:

Could you explain what you mean by 'file-handle-passed' problem?

Here's the relevant code, which goes through an array of films, reads 
in a template file, and writes out an HTML file containing the list 
of distributors for the film:

----+

// step through the films array and output the file
for( $x=0; $x<count($all_films); $x++ ){


//....snip snip: a few setup variables

// MAIN_ROOT, in this case = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']

// the directory name is the film_id
$output_dir = MAIN_ROOT . '/_admin/distributors/output/' . 
$all_films[$x]["film_id"];
// the file name
$output_file = 'distributors.html';
// build the path, for convenience
$output_path = $output_dir . "/" . $output_file;

// create the directory, if necessary
if( !file_exists($output_dir) && !is_dir($output_dir) ){
	mkdir($output_dir,0755);
}

//...snip snip: the code that populates the variable $output

// output the file
$output_h = fopen($output_path,"w");
fwrite($output_h,$output);
fclose($output_h);


//...snip snip: code that copies the file to a remote server


}

----+

Anything crazy in there?

When the file handle passed to the fwrite is not correct, you will get 
this streams error. Happens sometimes when someone gets a filehandle 
into a var, somehow mucks up the var (modifiy the type, for example) and 
then uses that var as the handle in an fwrite. theproblem is with the 
file handle passed to fwrite.

I did not go thru your code as it's late.. but I wanted to reply to your 
request for what I meant by that.

Couldn't repeat the error here.

Assuming $all_films[$x]["film_id"]="film_" . $x . "_id";
as long as   $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']  . '/_admin/distributors/output/' 
existed, this worked fine.

Sorry, but I didn't see in the previous posts that file contents are 
there in addition to the files themselves--and from the above, you 
obviously didn't need the basic info I posted.

I don't know what other steps you've taken to troubleshoot, but I often 
isolate a code snippet and try different things to see if anything 
changes.  You may have already gone thru this exercise, but if not--in 
your code:

// output the file
$output_h = fopen($output_path,"w");
fwrite($output_h,$output);
fclose($output_h);

what would this yield?
// output the file
$filedata = 'some stuff';
$fh = fopen("/path/filename", "w");
fwrite($fh, $filedata);
fclose($fh);

If the above worked, then I'd take a closer look at how the outputdir 
and outputdata is being created.  In addition, what happens if an 
existing file is opened for reading and fread(), or fopen() mode is 
changed to append instead of write?  Does a print_r() on the $fh 
($output_h) show a good resource type before the fclose()?

If you have an invalid filename character in
$all_films[$x]["film_id"] it will fail.

e.g:
if($all_films[$x]["film_id"] == ' '){
   you will get this:
   $output_dir.'/ /distributors.html'
  
  so this will pass:
  if( !file_exists($output_dir) &&
 !is_dir($output_dir) ){
 	mkdir($output_dir,0755);
 }

 but this will fail:
   
$output_h = fopen($output_path,"w");
 fwrite($output_h,$output);
 fclose($output_h);

}

i have things like this

class MyClass {
	var $_header;
	var $_body;
	var $_footer;
}

and i am trying to use that code to dynamically choose which variable to
change.

I've had luck with PHP 4.3.2 doing this:

if ($append) $this->{'_' . $part} .= $val;

I like Phil's approach way better than when I considered a solution using
eval();

Phill,

thanks that worked just as expected...

Now anyone know of a way to make sure $part is actually one of the class
variables?

Ok now I see what you're trying to do.
Since you don't have 10000 part types you can do this

define('HEADER_TYPE', 1);
define('BOBY_TYPE', 2);
define('FOOTER_TYPE, 3);

member setter
function setPart($type, $val, $append){
            switch($type){
              case HEADER_TYPE:
               code here;
               break;
              case BODY_TYPE:
                code here;
                break;
              case FOOTER_TYPE:
                code here;
                break;
              default:
              invalid part type!
              }
         
}

i do not want the class to create more, this is why i am checking the
values against the class vars ;)

Actually you would be better off with:

function setPart($part = NULL, $val = NULL, $append = FALSE) {
   if (isset($part) && isset($val) && @isset($this->{'_'.$part})) {
     if ($append) {
       $this->{'_'.$part} .= $val;
     } else {
       $this->{'_'.$part} = $val;
     }
     return TRUE;
   }
   return FALSE;
}

There is no need to go through the added overhead of calling 
get_class_vars and get_class, unless you want to disallow setting any 
vars not defined in the class definition.

Using the @isset(..) method you could define an addPart and delPart 
function if required, which you can not do with Phil's solution.

Following up on a prior conversation:

Started playing around with firefox extensions and saying I do work with
a lot of the semweb guys I built the following:
http://peoplesdns.com/foafer/

Pretty simple extension, but does some new things that I have not seen
other extensions do.

It is in testing until mozdev gets back to me and I get my project page
set up. :)

Built using: Javascript, XUL, RDF...

Saying many seem to not know about FOAF:

This extension finds a foaf file, parses and displays it in layer that
is tranparent, what this is, is kind of like a business card file.
More on foaf here http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
It is currently mostly used for social networks, but because of recent
pushes to a FOAFnet it has moved into others sites, most recently
LiveJournal (three million users and growing by 10,000 per day).

There is 'quite' a bit of work currently being done with this schema.
I do peoplesds.com, help with broadbandmechanics and am an active member
of rdf-dev. I mostly do work with FOAF in PHP and Mono, this is my first
venture into extensions.

We (FOAFnet/rdf-dev) recently have been doing a lot of work getting rdf
built into php.

For those interested, FOAF is "_F_riend _O_f _A_ _F_riend".

First people started "blogging".  Then bloggers started listing their 
friends blogs in a sidebar on their blogs

Since those friends also listed their friends blogs in sidebars of their 
blogs, someone noticed that these friends links on linked blogs were 
actually representative of a "social network". Think like the way Google 
does (links = relationships) and you'll see the potential.

When blog hosting services noticed they were hosting thousands of 
interlinked blogs, they knew they could analyze the internetworking on 
the back end. In order to do it across bloghosts, some standard means 
would be needed. FOAF is the prevailing technology for doing that using XML.

Hope that helps.

Hi Chris,
FOAF is actually used for *much* more than just showing interlinking
these days.
I authored the MeNowDocument FOAF schema extension:
http://schema.peoplesdns.com/menow/
Which is to have frequently updated info and which will be the subject
of my next firefox extension.

People are mapping foafers by airport codes, long/lat, using them for
public/private keypairs, developing trust relationships and even using
temporary ones for time-limited projects or dynamically changing groups
for cvs and project management.

It is fun to watch it evolve in an active manner.

So FOAF == "Friend of a Friend". I figured that was the case but chose not
to assume.

I was part of the customer service crew at AOL when they were trying to roll
out the old Virtual Places browser client. Basically browser + avatar +
tourguides. Just off the top of my head I see this as everything VP did,
with the addition things like embedding a .plan, P2P
instant-messaging/fileshare/playlist/etc.

I wonder how many people are seeing FOAF as an enabler for P2P? That's what
hit me first, actually.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MSIE caching problem
Message-ID: <670FEC60-E0B6-11D8-AE83-000A95DB7EF2@optonline.net>

I'm truly embarrased to ask this question, but other avenues have not 
provided a solution. I don't know if the problem is in my HTML, the 
browser configuration, or Apache.

I have a very basic web form that takes in some values that are used in 
a subsequent database query. After submitting, if the user elects to 
back up in the browser cache in order to make a few changes on original 
form and then re-submit, he/she finds that the entire form has been 
reset. This only happens with MSIE (version 6.0.28) on Windows XP. When 
I use Safari on MacOSX, the form retains the previously entered values 
when I back up to it in the browser cache. (Of course, forms on *other* 
web pages retain their values, even with MSIE on Windows).

I tried setting an "Expires:" header on the page containing the form 
using the header() function, but this had no impact.

I thought it was usually the case that people have trouble 
*eliminating* caching!

Server Specs:
MacOS 10.3.8
built-in Apache 1.3.29
PHP 4.3.4
MySQL 4.1.3-beta

Thanks,

mpm

Okay guys, I know we visit this every couple months. Please bear with me :)

Where is a good resource (php.net and google don't seem to have answers I
can use) for validating the form with Javascript where the form vars are
named with square-brackets so I can handle them as an array in PHP?

Everything I've tried coughs up "undefined" for the value of the form var in
question.

I'll take any and all links, examples and code snippets for the cause, and I
apologize again that I am dumping this all-too-common question on the list
;)

in Javascript you would write the form element like this:

document.myForm.elements['array[]'].  I've found online resources on 
www.phpbuilder.com that verified this for me.

use the form field numeric offset not the name.

Unfortunately when I try to

alert(document.myForm.elements['array[]'].value);

I get 'undefined' (yes I put text in the input control). I shall keep a
vigilant watch :)

I would prefer to avoid this approach if I can because I don't know when the
order of fields in the HTML might be changed by someone. Because of this
preference I want to use names instead of indices. 

Otherwise yeah, I'm sure that would work just peachy :)

You might want to try this question on the front end list.  Does not

Something is still wrong with this code

	function setPart($part, $val, $append=FALSE) {
		if (in_array($part, get_class_vars(get_class($this)))) {
			if(($part) && ($val)) {
				if ($append) $this->{'_' . $part} .= $val;
				else $this->{'_' .$part} = $val;
			}
			return true;
		}
		$this->sendError('undefined property.');
	}



this code is still allowing properties to be set that have not been
defined :(

here is my entire class


<?
include_once('smarty/Smarty.class.php');
class template extends Smarty {

	private $_header;
	private $_body;
	private $_footer;

	function template() {
		$this->_header = null;
		$this->_body = null;
		$this->_footer = null;

		$this->Smarty();

		$this->template_dir = BASE_DIR.'/smarty/dfs/templates/';
		$this->compile_dir = BASE_DIR.'/smarty/dfs/templates_c/';
		$this->config_dir = BASE_DIR.'/smarty/dfs/configs/';
		$this->cache_dir = BASE_DIR.'/smarty/dfs/cache/';

		$this->caching = false;
		$this->assign('app_name','Developer Financial Software');
	}

	function header($val) {
		if($val) {
			$this->_header = $val;
		} else {
			return $this->_header;
		}
	}

	function body($val) {
		if($val) {
			$this->_body = $val;
		} else {
			return $this->_body;
		}
	}

	function footer($val) {
		if($val) {
			$this->_footer .= $val;
		} else {
			return $this->_footer;
		}
	}

	function setPart($part, $val, $append=FALSE) {
		if (in_array($part, get_class_vars(get_class($this)))) {
			if(($part) && ($val)) {
				if ($append) $this->{'_' . $part} .= $val;
				else $this->{'_' .$part} = $val;
			}
			return true;
		}
		$this->sendError('undefined property.');
	}
	
	function sendError($err) {
		if($err) {
			echo $err;	
			exit;
		}	
	}

	function displayError($live, $page) {
		if($page) {
			if($live) {
				$this->display('error/static/'.$page.'.tpl');
			} else {
				$this->display('error/'.$page.'.tpl');
			}
		} else {
			$this->display('error/static/generic.tpl');
		}
	}

	function displayPage($page) {
		$this->assign('header', $this->_header);
		$this->assign('body', $this->_body);
		$this->assign('footer', $this->_footer);
		$this->display($page.'.tpl');
	}
}
?>

here is my index.php page

<?
include_once('include/global.php');

$page->subTitle('Home');
$tpl->setPart('header', $tpl->fetch('header.tpl'));
$tpl->setPart('body', $tpl->fetch('main.tpl'));
$tpl->setPart('footer', $tpl->fetch('footer.tpl'));
$tpl->setPart('test', 'this is a test');
echo $tpl->_test;

$tpl->displayPage('page');

?>


when the page is executed it echo's the value of $tpl->_test when in
fact _test should not be set since i have no var $_test; in my class
definition.

anyone here that can shed some light on this problem?

I discovered that this form resetting happens only when the file 
extension is omitted from the URL (.php or .html). Perhaps the behavior 
can be controlled with an Apache setting...

Use is_defined() to see if the property is defined, perhaps a 
combination of
is_defined() and !isset().  Other than that, I have no idea.

First off, aren't you mixing up your variable variable substitution?  
In some places you're using $part and in others you're using
'_' . $part.  They are not the same thing.

You really should be calling the method with the REAL property name.  
So, if the property is called "_foo", pass "_foo" to the $part 
parameter.  That's far clearer and faster than passing "foo" to $part 
and then tacking on the '_' repeatedly.

Let alone, why are you calling them "parts"?  They are "properties."

Now, all that aside, as someone mentioned the other day, your 
class_vars check is overly complex for no reason.  Just do an isset() 
check.

    if (isset($this->$part)) {
    }

OR, if you insist on continuing the ambiguous automatic underscore 
prefixing:

    if (isset($this->{'_' . $part})) {
    }

You mistakenly replied to them that you don't want to set unset 
properties.  That's what this check prevents.

I forgot to mention (because I started saying it in a prior reply that 
I ended up quitting to start over)...

Make sure to declare your properties with a value.  Strings:
   private $item = '';

Numbers:
   private $item = 0;

Arrays:
   private $item = array();

Ah, yeah I put this one to bed with the help of some crazy Scandinavian...
;)

I was neglecting the trailing array subscript. The solution is now:

alert(document.form.elements["elemName[]"][N].value); 

displays the Nth value (zero-based) named "elemName[]" out of the form.

I recommend using Josh's recommendation (i.e. the getElementBy*
methods), and follow the standards-compliant DOM:
http://www.w3.org/DOM/  

Not to pontificate standards compliance...but from my experience this
will make you code less brittle, especially across different browsers
and browser versions.

It will also tell you WHY the recipient was rejected.  Why was he?

Is the recipient subscribed?

Normally you have to add the aliases yourself - the command-line 
new_list command tells you what aliases it needs.

Donald:

I don't recall you saying where the error is coming from.

If the bounce is generated by you Mail Transfer Agent, that means you 
haven't set up the given list/admin address on the server.

If the bounce is coming from Mailman, then you have to fix your 
Mailman config.

There's quite a difference.

But WHICH program is telling you there's an error?  There's a 
tremendous difference.  So far, you're sending us on a wild goose 
chase.  Some people are telling you to fix mailman and others are 
telling you to fix the server.  How about pasting the bounce message 
here?

Im guessing the email address doesn't exist on the server... (hence "no

Message-ID: <E1BqGIR-0008VD-Ee@neutron.nocdirect.com>

Hello all,

I wanted to solicit your thoughts and opinions on what you think is the
best development environment for PHP and why you think this. I
personally use Dreamweaver to code and test with Firefox (no error and
output looks like it should? Must be error free. ;-)  ). Part of this is
because my sites are remotely hosted and I don't run LAMP at home (yet).
I recognize there are probably better ways and that it is time to start
using a "real" environment.

Thanks in advance for your opinons!

EZ

When you add the list on the command-line you will see something like this:

# ./newlist dummy dummy at lists.bway.net password
To finish creating your mailing list, you must edit your /etc/aliases (or
equivalent) file by adding the following lines, and possibly running the
`newaliases' program:

## dummy mailing list
dummy:              "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman post dummy"
dummy-admin:        "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman admin dummy"
dummy-bounces:      "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman bounces dummy"
dummy-confirm:      "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman confirm dummy"
dummy-join:         "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman join dummy"
dummy-leave:        "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman leave dummy"
dummy-owner:        "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman owner dummy"
dummy-request:      "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman request dummy"
dummy-subscribe:    "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman subscribe dummy"
dummy-unsubscribe:  "|/usr/local/mailman/mail/mailman unsubscribe dummy"

Hit enter to notify dummy owner...


So these aliases need to be added to /etc/aliases (or /etc/mail/aliases 
on some servers) so the list can receieve emails on those addresses. You 
then need to rebuild the aliases database (Debian has a Makefile to do 
this, i.e. "cd /etc/mail && make") - other distros may require you to 
run makemap instead. I can't remember if you need to send sendmail a HUP 
or if you need to do a restart for it to use the new aliases.

Well.
This is a personal preference.

Personally, I run linux (gentoo) and do all my code in gvim and test
with firefox.
I keep two versions of PHP on hand. One the server compile (same flags)
and one for my CLI stuff (things like --with-ncurses and GTK etc)

I would say that the closer you can be to the production environment the
better. I.e. it would not make sense to develop windows apps on a Mac? 

But, then, that is my personal preferences..
Some people will say that emacs is the way to go..

Just to chime in here, I develop on a Windows XP box.  <gasp>

Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Sendmail are installed.  I use Zend, 
Dreamweaver, MySQL Control Center and other graphics programs.  I use 
WinEdit when I need  simple editor.  I find that I have no problems on 
this platform.  I can move all of my code between my Win box and my 
Linux servers without a problem.  Occasionally, I will have to modify my 
applications config files. In that case I create multiple config files, 
one for each of the environments it will be running in.

I always and will always use Zend Studio.

it has great code completion, integrated FTP site for
editing/saving/deleting files, also it has integrated CVS support, if
you are working with CVS you can't go wrong with ZDE.

I'll take that one step further - Like IE, but still under active
development with keen eyes on standards compliance and next-generation
functionality, all within a secure framework instead of the "Look, It's a
Browser!" approach.

I develop on Windows XP Professional myself.  As much as I like to bash
M$, XP is their best OS yet, and is more stable than previous ones (no
more blue screens).  Portability between my Windows box and my LAMP host
is not a problem.  I like Dreamweaver, and am considering adding another
Macromedia product - Fireworks - for image editing.  Anyone have any
experience with that?

a great browser -- I like the tabbed browsing the best as well as the 
popup blocker.

and this email was sent using the Thunderbird client
http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/

give the browser a try first, most folks won't go back after trying 
Firefox...

When I'm not writing courseware (OpenOffice and GIMP), I use XAMPP and 
Ultraedit.  (and putty into my Linux server box where I use vi :)

Hello people:

I use a Linux box. 

To code PHP: Kate (KDE)

And use Firefox and Opera as my browsers, and ocasionally use Windows in 
Vmware to see my pages in IE (6.0).

I use phpmyadmin to handle my mysql databases.

Simple. And no problems for now.

Me too, I run WinXP on my laptop for dev work, with Apache, PHP and 
MySQL running locally.

My editor of choice in EmEditor (http://www.emeditor.com), not very 
popular (or free) but it has all the features I want and none of the 
extra 'stuff' I don't need.  I also use the font ProggyClean 
(http://www.tactile3d.com/tristan/), which makes reading code a whole 
lot easier on the eyes.

TortoiseCVS and WinMerge are invaluable, as are Cygwin grep, PuTTY and 
WinSCP.  MySQL Control Center and phpMyAdmin take care of all my local 
MySQL administration needs (neither is perfect but together they are a 
great team).

As for compatibility issues...I set up EmEditor to automatically save 
files with unix line-endings, etc so I don't have to worry about that.

In any case (and this is true of the majority of php code) most of the 
stuff I work on has to be tested on both platforms, so it doesn't matter 
that much.

I wont go back to anything but Firefox but i didnt like the layout of
Thunderbird ;(

I like being able to have multiple email accounts and not have seperate
account folders for them sure that i snice when you have 5 accounts but
when you have 20 there is an issue with all the account folders, i would
prefer to have one inbox and use filters to put the emails in the proper
sub-folder.

One more for everyone's consideration:  Navicat in lieu of phpMyAdmin.  The
latter is great, but Navicat (~$60) is fantastic and fast for MySQL
maintenance/design, etc.

Or try MyCC, it's  across platform client that's open source.  We use it
on our Linux workstations and Windows Laptops

Or if you are in Windows, MySQL-Front is great (used to be free, but now
costs $35) http://www.mysqlfront.de/

I *love* Fireworks.

It's the perfect blend of raster and vector tools for web graphics. Not
nearly as clunky as Illustrator or Photoshop...but sort of a pared down
subset of tools from each of those apps.

The DW integration is sort of useful too.

I'm on Win XP Apache 2, PHP, MySQL (using phpMyAdmin for admin), Firefox.

Hello all,

I wanted to solicit your thoughts and opinions on what you think is the best
development environment for PHP and why you think this. I personally use
Dreamweaver to code and test with Firefox (no error and output looks like it
should? Must be error free. ;-)  ). Part of this is because my sites are
remotely hosted and I don't run LAMP at home (yet).
I recognize there are probably better ways and that it is time to start
using a "real" environment.

Thanks in advance for your opinons!

EZ

Ajai, that has nothing to do with the address existing on the server.

Donald, this also has nothing to do with Mailman.

This has to do with your Outlook settings and/or the connection from 
your computer to the internet.  To figure out what's going on QUIT

Friendster, Rzye, Monster Networking, etc? Any interest in working on an 
existing project to do this?

1) When asking questions and posting on this or any mailing list, please
provide as much detail as possible.  Short and overly-simplistic
postings generate unneeded list traffic and make it difficult to work
through problems.

2) Let's take this off-list - it has nothing to do with PHP or anything
AMP.

3) Since Mailman is Python, I'll mention the NYPHP Python SIG;

I bought a new laptop a couple months ago and out of sheer boredom (and 
laziness) I just kept XP.  Eventually found Wintel counterparts to all 
of my needs, and rely heavily on Macromedia's environment now 
(Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash).  Thanks to firefox and thunderbird, I 
am comfortable on any platform.  The only thing I miss?  Code folding.  
Sure wish I could collapse those hairy classes and just look at the few 
functions in that script without having to hit page up forty 
times...(grumble grumble)

On to fireworks, I started using Photoshop with the Mac IIcx (Bush's 
daddy was president I think), working my way to the SGI workstation of 
doom; and then switched off to Gimp on Linux when it became usable.  
When I first started playing with Fireworks, I just couldn't figure out 
how anything worked, and had to see some tutorials to grok the 
interface.  Then, I just couldn't trust it, because it had automated 
stuff that took forever to do in Gimp.  But it worked, and well.

Now I can do something in Fireworks and it takes minutes, something that 
would take the whole dingdong day with anything else.  I think you will 
be just fine, as long as you spend the time to learn the Fireworks way 
of doing things(tm).

Hi,

I'm new to the list. I didn't see OS X represented yet so I thought I'd
chime in. I'm blissfully happy in my OS X development environment. Why use
M$ when you can run a 'Nix-based environment on localhost that has an
amazing GUI? (no need to answer that, btw).

OSX comes with PHP and Apache and PERL pre-installed. I've got the XAMP
environment with some add-ins to PHP like PDFLib and stuff ISPs don't always
enable. Code can be ported between servers transparently.

Though haven't used Zend DE yet it is available for OS X. My DE is just a
text editor (BBEdit) and a WYSIWYG HTML editor for making templates (I use
GoLive).

my partner in crime, Lori, who has more graphic talent than she realizes 
now does most of her website design using Fireworks, and she's an 
extremely accomplished Photoshop wiz.  As for me, I'm graphically 
challenged and do the backend stuff.  We happily just landed a client 
where I can do the backend using PHP/MySQL :)  after a few .ASP sites 
because of hosting...

my real reason for this post though, is that I've just installed Mambo 
and it is one very slick CMS.  And my hosting co. makes it too easy as 
well (fantastico intaller)--check this list out:

http://www.edmunds-enterprises.com/linux/hosting_plans.php


and they keep things up-to-date as well as run apache 1.3 (phpinfo)
http://www.cerebralfusion.com/info.php

if you back up one, you'll see my 'work in progress' from a couple days 
ago--I've got the tagline up at least :)

Sorry forgot the URL ... http://www.modelworks.com ... all I need to say 
is that Chet Murphy (the author of the IDE) answers every single email 
you send him and I suggested PHP code folding and he added it the next 
day ... I have to say that when you don't have to wad through 
documentation or email sales at whatever.com for it to go off into space, 
its a big +.

I use to hate the fact that alot of WYSIWYG ide's would put alot of 
bloating junk into their libraries but I ended up coding them into 
macros and popping them into JPadPro and it was easier.

I wonder why it is that even though this old war horse of a topic
re-emerges once every few months, we never tire of talking about it? I
gotta admit I've read the whole thread.

Windows 2000 (at work): Zend, and sometimes an aging HomeSite for HTML,
Mozilla

Linux RH9 (at home): Zend, Quanta, Mozilla

Started fooling around with KDevelop on a Mandrake 10 notebook, because it
was there. Jury still out. Looks promising, though.

Have used Eclipse for some Java, and some PHP. Still haven't got the hang
of Eclipse. My, doesn't it suck when you get distracted from the real work
by the learning of the tools.

And of course I do a little vi, especially when SSHing about, but I'm
still pretty much vi-challenged.

Zend is pretty nice but slow, unless your machine is quite muscular.
Eclipse disappoints in this respect as well. That's Java for you. Both
have good CVS support. It appears KDevelop supports both CVS and
SubVersion, which I have yet to sample.

For MySQL I do some phpMyAdmin, some MySQL Control Center (don't care for
it too much), and a lot of "mysql> "

Are you guys too paranoid for plain old ftp as opposed to SSH/SCP/SFTP? I
*very* rarely use ftp anymore but I hear that having your creds stolen by
a packet sniffing badguy is a rare and unlikely occurence.

The letters ftp make me cringe ..

It actually feels good to install cygwin for someone w/ the tools and
teaching them how to just use 

Scp -r * me at me.com:~/somewhere

Thus why I applauded the Zend integration w/ the IDE.  

The windump sniffing demos between ftp and scp are good ways to get the
points across ;-)

I
*very* rarely use ftp anymore but I hear that having your creds stolen by a
packet sniffing badguy is a rare and unlikely occurence. <<<

basically what i was planning on doing was writing a PHP script that i could
cron to pull the info from a DB on all the Hosts and shares that have to be
backed up and then just copy all of it down to the linux server.

I did this same thing recently for a project. Divide the tasks into two
scripts so you don't have to worry about network latencies.

DB_backup.php
DB_ftp.php


In DB_backup.php you just need to execute this command:

<?
exec("mysqldump --opt -u $USER --password=\"$PASSWORD\"  $DATABASE | gzip -c
> $LOCAL_FILENAME");
?>

(and manage some error trapping and logging if you want).
IN DB_ftp.php use the ftp functions:

<?

$conn_id = ftp_connect($HOST);
$login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $HOST_UNAME, $HOST_PWORD);
if ((!$conn_id) || (!$login_result)) {
    // print or log the next line
    print "FTP connection has failed. Could not connect to host: $HOST.";
    exit;
}

// put file
if ( ! ftp_put($conn_id, $REMOTE_FILENAME, $LOCAL_FILENAME, FTP_ASCII) )
{
    // print or log the next line
    print "Error copying file. Could not copy file to server.";
    exit;
}
else
{
    // print or log the next line
    print "Copy successful .";
}

// close connection
ftp_close($conn_id);

?>

The crontab -e and set something like:

5 0 * * *   php /path/to/script/DB_backup.php
10 0 * * *  php /path/to/script/DB_ftp.php


Hope this helps.
Eddie

In your crontab you could try setting the execution time to 0:

* * * * *  /path/to/php -d max_execution_time=0 /path/to/file.php

Or use set_time_limit(0) in your script. 


I was never a fan of using PHP for system stuff.  Perl and/or simple
bash scripts seem more suitable to me.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Development environment?
Message-ID: <E1BqaJ0-000188-LH@thc3.thehostingcompany.us>

trying to bring this back OT

When possible, I like to set up a subdomain on the same server such that
www.domain.com is my production environment and
dev.domain.com is my dev environment
(sometimes I'll also do a 3rd QA setup)

the great advantage of this is everything on dev is exactly the same as
on production

a disadvantage would be that runaway processes on dev can affect the
live site.
disk space can also be an issue as well as making sure that any files
you write to the disk are separated out by prod or dev (or qa). You'll
also want to create duplicate databases for the dev environment.

this has worked well for me where I have the space and power on the
production server and not the $$$ for a separate box.
I could use my linux workstation for dev purposes, but then I have to
make sure that all the versions line up, etc.

last, promoting your code to production is a lot faster as it's just a
local cp


since everyone else has said so... I still use vi(m) in the ssh shell
for everything :)

As far as large file size, I don't know how that effects either script
sorry. I've tried it with up to about 20 MB DB files which compress to a
manageable 5MB. 

You might just try putting more time (an hour?) between the jobs just to be
safe. If both your servers are connected to a good internet connection
(through a T1 or T3 etc.) then the transfer should only take a few minutes.

In the code below also, you might have to change: FTP_ASCII to FTP_BINARY if
the file is gzipped.

Good luck,
Eddie

This is where CVS really shines, as I track everything except the config 
file in CVS, then can export that project to the production websites 
directory and the configuration is still good.

In a sense, a good practice that I try to follow is dev->test->prod, and 
I can use CVS to manage the whole shebang with simple export steps.  You 
can even cron the export to test, so the test version is always current 
(within a day/hour/minute etc.).

I've lately started keeping all configuration information in a separate 
config class, and that has really helped things out immeasurably.  As 
long as the configuration info includes the URLs and directory paths, 
the only thing different in each of these sites is the values in the 
config class.  Everything else should just work.  And yes, I did learn 
this practice through working with Mambo...

What other ways are there that are easy to do?  Do I smell a 
PHundamentals opportunity?  ;-)

Sheesh,

It hasn't even been 24 hours and there are already about 30 replies to 
this question.
I'm usually more of a lurker but thought I could provide some clarity.

You ask what the "best" dev environment is, but the term best has 
different meanings to different people.
That's why you received so many answers :)

You might want to elaborate on what features are important to you.

Price not being an issue, I don't think you'll find any IDE more feature 
rich then Zend Studio.
Zend Studio is much more than an editor, especially when you run the 
Zend Studio Server component.
This allows you to do things like trace/debug your PHP code ON THE 
SERVER. I don't remember the details but nyphp members can get a discount.

If you're looking for something "lighter", there are numerous text 
editors which I'm sure you'll be happier with such as UltraEdit, TextPad 
or even Emacs or VIM :)

On the side of what browser to use, personally I shoot for IE 5 and up 
since I know that's what about 95% of my users use.

I do something similar, but I have it check either the DOCUMENT_ROOT or
the HTTP_HOST and adjust config vars (urls, paths, etc) accordingly.
That way I don't have to remember to change a var specifying dev/qa/prod

I have to disagree with this. Aside from the many more obvious reasons, 
it is better to develop on anything but IE for a couple of reasons. 
First, since most people use it, any bugs are far more likely to be 
found by the users of IE, and you'll hear about them right away, but 
there a fewer eyes on the other browsers, so you're better served 
giving it a good look from that perspective yourself. Second, it is 
much easier to do something standards-compliant in an alternative 
browser and tweak it to work in IE than it is to start with IE an make 
it work elsewhere.

It's similar to "Lucida Console" on Windows, which is what I use.

I write code in EditPlus, a basic text editor that has some handy 
coding features.  I like it because it's clean and simple.

Mitch mentioned code collapsing, which this doesn't have, but it does 
produce a list of all functions in a file via Search | Function List.  

I use Zend Studio for complex debugging.  I don't like writing in it 
because it's too cluttered, let alone is overkill.

Where I work, bugs aren't allowed to reach the users. Neglecting to test in
IE could cost us a client. Plus I've found that users don't usually jump at
the chance to notify you of your bugs.

I think that you'll run into more of a problem with Javascript/css between
browsers. If you are developing server-side applications, your code should
work in any browser. I usually get my code to work in IE and then pop open
alternate browsers to confirm it works there as well.

This training specifically covers the topics of PHP5 OOP, focusing on writing object oriented wrappers for HTML Quick Form and effectively using XML.  The cost of this class is expensive and we are looking to open up 2 seats to the public (Total of 5 seats) to offset the cost, it is a 2 day class - August 12(PHP5 OOP) & August 13 (Effectively using XML).

Any advice on how to get the fonts to work on Fedora Core 1?  I followed
the instructions on the site to no avail.  I've exited and restarted
both the X Font Server and X Windows several times.  Yes, I did a
mkfontdir on every dir in /usr/lib/X11/fonts.  I Copied over the TTF and
PCF fonts.  I added 'Load "bitmap" to XF86Config...


I can't locate "Proggy*" in Konsole, GVim, or K Control Center.

What am I missing?

You're very welcome, it's amazing the difference the right font can make 
when coding.

I've been using ProFont for at least a year now, which I TRULY enjoy using,
both on my laptop and desktop with about every app I use for coding...
http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/

As far as IDEs, I enjoy using Zend Studio for it's PHP prowess (and
debugging is fantastic when the client's dev server supports it, which my
server does not), but hand coding HTML is a real pain in Zend in comparison
to Dreamweaver MX and HomeSite.  The code completion and color coding in
both tools for html is phenomenal, and customizable, which is great for tag
based template systems (I generally use patTemplate).

Also, DWMX's regex search and replace is damned good.  Zend's is decent but
there's very little assistance for it.  Oh, and of course vi when working
over ssh.

For the environment, I usually use my BSD server at my host (using
projectName.enobrev.com).  MY host is generally very good about adding
whatever extensions I might need and whatnot.  For larger projects with
multiple developers, I'll usually create a new virtual server.  When
traveling, I use a barebones WAMP setup on my laptop, which I've found
little to no modification necessary (besides directory stuff) when uploading
to the usual LAMP server.  I'm hoping to get a new box around here soon so I
can make my current desktop into a local Linux server.  That, or if I can
find the time, I'll take the long dive into setting my laptop up with BSD or
Linux.

I'm REALLY interested in OSX, and would LOVE to hook up a nice lil DE on an
OSX laptop for home and road, but even now in these busy times, Macs are
expensive!

Mark,

You made a very good point.
Creating HTML vs creating PHP code.
There isn't a single tool that truly shines when doing both the "back 
end" coding (PHP code) and the "front end" HTML code.
Back to the original question - "what is the best dev enviroment", this 
is a very big consideration.

When I create a brand new page (or a new design), I first design it in 
something other than Zend Studio.
Only when I'm doing the PHP coding do I use Zend Studio.
I also use smarty templates which allows me to associate .php files with 
Zend studio and .tpl files with my HTML editor :)
