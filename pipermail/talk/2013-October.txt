Subject: [nycphp-talk] CRM + Quickbooks Online
Message-ID: <CANaytcfTyw4XXF62Qwn2SjpOUPyhst+ZHLd8bg9V9o1wwetu6w@mail.gmail.com>

I volunteer for a non-profit (Coastal Trails Coalition) who wants/needs to
marry CRM functionality with
Quickbooks Online data.

As the leading FOSS solutions, I'm thinking CiviCRM or SugarCRM would have
an available integration.  In fact, I know that CiviCRM can now be
integrated with WordPress, which would certainly handle both web presence
and CRM.  As far as specific solutions that couple CiviCRM with Quickbooks,
I find an integrations page at
http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Quickbooks+Integration which
only touches on theory and NOT any specific ability to integrate CiviCRM
and QuickBooks.  SugarCRM has an integration module
http://www.sugarforge.org/content/project-of-the-month/potm-11-2012.php that
I have not had the opportunity to review.

It's been a while since I played with either Sugar or Civi.  In the
interest of time, I'm wondering if anyone in the BostonPHP community has
done this type of integration and can speak from experience on the
availability of options, completeness of the solution, and especially the
best way to actually host if there are better choices than renting your own
VM (ie, is SugarOnDemand a viable option when you start to add custom
integrations?)

I have a number of times worked with this, what specific data are you actually trying to sync? 

some data is easy and other stuff is painful. 

here's a php library that rocks for all intuit stuff
https://github.com/consolibyte/quickbooks-php

I have been using this for deep and simple integrations with all levels of qb. 

hope this helps!

Well, all the current customers are in a spreadsheet, and QuickBooks
handles just financial transactions, so initially the goal is to
consolidate, de-dupe and setup QB as the master.  Then it would be an
export or integration to the CRM in a way that would let all volunteers
access or input information on contacts (including non-financial) without
having the spreadsheet maintainer be the bottleneck.  The catch there is
that the CRM has to be as powerful and simple as a spreadsheet for data
sorting, reporting, entry.  I "think" Civi or Sugar could work - but the
challenge for the organization would be to learn how to use the system.
 Otherwise, with a simple spreadsheet UI like DataTables
https://datatables.net/index and the php library you mention, a custom
solution would allow them to work in any manner they choose.

That rocks.  Updated 3 hours ago too, looking at their github page.

Q: What do the numbers 166 and 98 have in common?

A: Both are bad to have on your blood pressure readout.

After trying to get back into C and Python for a while, I need to relax.
PHP is fun and does things I want to do. While I doubt I'll get a full time
gig with PHP, it's still fun.

I have some projects on Github/Sourceforge that I'll probably ask for help
with. Right now I'm trying to "get" OOP and introduce it into my code.

I've looked at Go as well, and if I could get myself going on it I think it
is one of the big up and coming things. However, I'm more focused on the
neat flashy stuff on the web.

I'm loosely looking at the MEAN stack. With PHP I want to do MongoDB and
then add some javascript.

I think the general consensus is that AngularJS is better...

"Also amazing" or "Better for some people". They're very different, and
there are reasons to like (or dislike) both.

Hey all,

A long time ago I passed my ZCE, and as a reward I got a license to Zend
Studio. Fast forward to today and I decided to try it out, and more
importantly make a chocolatey package for it. Apparently I am only eligible
for version 8 of Zend Studio. Zend.com only lets me download 10.0 and 9.0
of Zend Studio.

How do I get version 8.0?

TIA,

Tbh it's not worth the trouble. Especially not worth being 2 versions behind. Check the zend forums for the best help on that. I tried it after I passed my zce and went back to vim within an hour. I still use zend server as a quick turn-key stack every now and then, though :)

Good luck!

Mike, you mean 2 and a half versions behind :)

Zend announced 10.5 here at ZendCon this week: 
http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/studio-10-5-early-access


Justin,

Have you hit the "Chat with sales" or "Forums" link on the Studio page? 
http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/

Maybe they can get you a link to 8 or a later version.




Thanks,

Ive used Zend Studio for years, recently made the switch to phpstorm and have been loving it.  

I would try out that IDE if you haven't yet boosts productivity a lot.

Thanks,

Fun is the name of the game! It is also a great motivator.  :)

Now that I'm back to PHP, am looking at the Factory design pattern. 
Fortunately I have a copy of William Sanders' "Learning PHP Design 
Patterns". Never let it be said that I was short a book!

MVC is a later topic, though important. I need to be able to create web 
pages and to throw stuff into a database. So the implementations will be 
different but based off the same classes.

I am going back to the absolute basics and trying to make sure I 
understand each part. There is an abstract class "Being" that sets up 
the required properties but does not do anything. There is a helper 
class for dice rolls. There is a test_Dice.php file to test the dice rolls.

Two questions from this morning. First, is there a better way to test a 
(helper) class than what I did with test_Dice.php? I don't know PHP 
testing hardly at all, but want to add that skill.

Also, Dice.php should actually go into another project. If you're 
working on a project on GitHub that needs a file from another project, 
what's the best way to integrate it so that any changes get implemented?

Todays work:

https://github.com/makhidkarun/Traveller_Mercenary_Generator/blob/master/Dice.php

https://github.com/makhidkarun/Traveller_Mercenary_Generator/blob/master/test_Dice.php

Please keep in mind that I'm an OOP n00b, so there are probably lots of 
ways to improve. However, improvement is the goal. I prefer a suggestion 
or critical comment to a solution.

Thanks!

Leam

Well, objects have been getting the better of me for a while. This past
weekend I've gotten back into wrangling with OOP. As of last night I
figured out an __autoload issue and the folks on #phpmentoring and ##php
have been giving me some good guidance. I am also still referencing an
NYPHP e-mail thread from 25 Feb 13; on that got me started on the OOP
progress.

Fun times!

Here is the diagnostic.

http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=php.net

Which appears to imply that comments posted in the manual are linking to
sites which contain malware.  That's bad.

And people talking about it:

http://news.softpedia.com/news/Php-net-Flagged-as-Malicious-Website-393920.shtml

But I haven't checked out the dev channel on IRC so I don't have any update
from site admins

Anyone know the scoop about when the warning might come down; or more
importantly what the problem is with the comment/web system?

 Somehow some obfuscated javascrip was injected into a userprefs.js file
which in turn loads an iframe that loads the malware.

Firefox will let you actually go to the page, if you click around a bit.

However, I'm not fond of the comment on php.net anyway. I'd rather folks
put in tickets to grow the actual documentation vice putting a bunch of
confusing comments in the bottom.

There seems to be some confusion on the part of php.net devs about why the
site is being flagged.  But, they've removed some code in 5 files
https://github.com/php/web-php/commit/8e87088c3f51b594dc7d7ed71115d215a7acf78b

And requested a review by Google
http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/webmasters/puLmvjtK0m8%5B1-25-false%5D

Some obfuscated javascript code may have been included in actual site code
(not user generated content).

Anyone know anyone who deals with the mailing lists on php.net? Even 
before the recent ruckus, I was unable to sign on to the mailing lists.

Thanks!

What happens?

It's always worked fine for me:
1) Go to http://us1.php.net/mailing-lists.php
2) Click the radio button next to the list you want to subscribe to
3) Enter your email address at the bottom
4) Click the subscribe button
5) Reply to the confirmation email.  Maybe this is where you're having
problems.  Maybe these emails are getting snagged as spam.

That's all there is to it.

Hey Dan!

I check my Gmail spam filter pretty often and the confirmation e-mails 
haven't shown up. They aren't even in the trash. I had tried to sign up 
before php.net got black-listed, to no avail.

Happy Friday!

Heya, 

Maybe it helps if you first unsubscribe from the list by sending an email
to:
<internals-unsubscribe at lists.php.net>

And then subscribe again:
<internals-help at lists.php.net>

Cheers,
Robert

Okay, this is sad. I have been doing e-mail lists since before they had 
web interfaces...

Dan,

I never figured that one out. Left the country for a bit and came back; 
*blam* BBS's were out and everything was "internet this" and "web that".

And, with some finagleing, I have list subscriptions. Not sure what's up 
with the web page though. I was not subscribed to any of the lists I 
just got on.
