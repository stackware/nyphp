Sorry Hans (and list).

I prefixed the subject so that normal list subscribers wouldn't be
bothered by messages they aren't interested in.  But, as a long-time
list member myself I often feel like not receiving [JOB] messages is
like getting the newspaper without the classified section -- you never
read it except for when you actually want to buy something.  In other
words, I feel like devs do not subscribe to the jobs list but are
interested in jobs on an infrequent basis.  I'm not saying that any
policy needs to change, nor that I'm right... I'm just saying I
believe the situation is somewhat of a catch-22.

As long as the job lists are archived, and they are, those who are
interested as I am occasionally can view the archives online.   At least
that is my opinion.

Now if only the RSS feeds were working again[speaking of which, is there
anything I can do to get that working?  I really liked keeping the jobs on
RSS only]

I don't know how they were working on that list before, but you can make
your own with this (it works): http://taint.org/mmrss/

Message-ID: <358E05AE-C3F7-433E-BFC2-E50CD0137B67@smith.edu>

Greetings all,

I'm working on a project that will require the use of SOAP.  From what  
I gather there are three main packages I can use:

1)  PHP built-in SOAP extension - http://php.net/manual/en/book.soap.php
2)  PEAR SOAP package - http://pear.php.net/package/SOAP
3)  NuSOAP package - http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/

Before I move forward I'd be interested in hearing from folks as to  
their experiences with one or all of these packages.

Positives?  Negatives?  Recommendations?  Etc.

Thanks,

-Aaron

Hate to further extend your comparison, but I've used Zend_Soap_Client
from the Zend Framework and it works pretty well, very straight
forward:

http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.soap.client.html

PS, You can get the Zend Framework through PEAR:

pear channel-discover pear.zfcampus.org
pear install zfcampus/zf

Hi,
I have only used the built in soap extension.  I never had problems with it.
I have not used any others.

Aaron,

For new PHP5 development use the built-in or zend soap client I've never
used the zend framework one.

I take it PHP will be the soap client? What is the soap service written in?

Regards,

Justin Dearing

Justin,

OK, I'm still learning the verbiage here, this is my first go-around  
with soap.  Maybe I should have mentioned I'm a soap newbie in my  
initial post!!

Yes, my app using PHP will be the client.  The service to be consumed  
is Novell GroupWise.  I'm not sure what it's written in.

NuSOAP has one small gotcha.  A lot of SOAP interfaces are designed for
Java/Ruby.  This means they support things like having multiple soap
function calls and choosing which function to use based on the variables
being passe
For example:
$people = new Directory();

$person = $people->FindPerson("firstname", "lastname");

$employeeId = 12345;
$person = $people->FindPerson($employeeId);


Based on the variables, Java and Ruby know which functions to use.  By the
same token, when mapped to SOAP objects and exposed as functions, you will
have 2 functions defined in the WSDL.

When nuSoap parses the WSDL file, only the LAST function with the same name
is active, all the others are ignored.

I never used groupwise soap objects, so I can't comment on specifics there.

Some debugging tools:

Fiddler2 and charles for getting down and dirty with the messages going over
the wire: http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/ http://www.charlesproxy.com/

<http://www.charlesproxy.com/>SoapUI to experiment with calling the
service: http://www.soapui.org/

<http://www.soapui.org/>SoapUI is eclipse based, and inherits all the
eclipse project/workspace workflow. However, even if you are not a fan of
eclipse in general (I am not) this is the best soap tool I know of. If yu
are on windows, also look at storm http://www.codeplex.com/storm

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Returning DB results as XML or JSON?
Message-ID: <5458518f0912031111k1c354d47n3232fae933228f0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I'm creating a Windows Mobile application that needs to query a remote MySQL
database. For logging purposes, I want to perform the database queries on
the server instead of having the client issue the command. So my plan is to
pass the needed information from the Windows Mobile program into a PHP
script, have the PHP script query the database, then return the results in
either XML or JSON.

While this seems (and indeed is) a rather simple task, it's also fairly
tedious. Is there anything out there that can help me auto-format them in
one of those formats? Something that takes a standard results set then
transforms it into either XML or JSON?

Thanks!
Anthony Papillion

I would really recommend taking a look at http://wso2.org/projects/wsf/php it not only gives classes for SOAP client/service creation but it also adds an extension to PHP so that it can do almost anything it needs to when it comes to soap.... Pretty much any other PHP SOAP library out there has limitations when it comes to interacting with SOAP, whether it be the headers, or authentication or attachements.... this doesnt.

Here is how I would do it (using json_encode or simplexml):

Thank you! I have no idea why I forgot about json_encode.
This was a very 'duh' moment!

Thanks again,

Awesome, thanks for the links.  I do my coding in BBEdit on a Mac but  
would be interested in checking out the Eclipse IDE if it makes things  
easier for this project.

Just wanted to add in there that you could use MongoDB instead of
MySQL, which gives you additional opportunities to do stuff like real
time analytics and live in a SQL-free world.

Documents are stored in a binary JSON format, so there's no conversion
needed. You could almost look at your PHP scripts as a simple REST
interface to MongoDB, which would scale very gracefully and be very
quick to prototype.

I know MongoDB is cool an' all, but you seem to be pushing it really hard.

+1.  Why all the non-relational love?

Can you imagine building an e-commercie site with a NoSQL database?
The products table would quickly become a god table that is
responsible for everything, and counting products by category would
require a heroic effort.  Keeping non-relational databases consistent
requires writing tons of cron jobs to constantly fix the data.

Sure, NoSQL may be better than sharding, but it isn't exactly fun.

John Campbell

Actually there are new innovations in this area where all data is  
stored in flat text files that are indexed. These systems out perform  
many databases, if not all, with little overhead.

Yep - but it's not an everything solution. My apologies if my
enthusiasm makes it sound that way.

Coming from the CMS space, document databases are somewhat of a silver
bullet though - they solve so many problems that have plagued the
space all along. I was on a panel with Drupal, Alfresco and Plone
yesterday in Boston, and mentioned that Plone had ZODB all these years
while the rest of us were stuck with flat, relational databases that
were an awful fit for our object languages.

With noSQL databases like MongoDB, CouchDB, hBase and many more, those
problems are replaced with new ones sure; but at least we aren't
banging our heads against the same old ones :^P

Actually, I remember when all the CMS projects seemed to be pushing
jQuery very very hard, and it creeped me out. In hindsight, it should
be clear to everyone why jQuery was "the topic" back then, as it was
so desperately needed.

I feel the same way today about being freed from relational databases.

Sure, my Android phone has lots of functions but a dedicated digital 
camera will always give you better photos than the phone's camera.

Yeah, it did, kinda :-)

No, I get it, and in fact MongoDB is very interesting to me - I attended 
the NoSQL meet in NYC a few weeks ago. Just think we need to step back 
once in awhile and evangelize a little less.

Yes absolutely agree.

I guess Im more inclined to remind myself that for some situations it 
makes perfect sense but not for every single case :-)

So how's the MongoDB support in Joomla going?

It's gone as far as it is going to go (a helper library) until a query
builder and proper ORM makes it into the core. There's just too much
SQL littering the codebase... The last site I built with Joomla and
MongoDB still had to use "just enough MySQL to shut Joomla up" so we
could use MongoDB for everything else.

I know there are three separate projects with Drupal using MongoDB as
well, which is cool - pretty sure they are D7 though.

Would love to see CCK on top of a noSQL solution, as that would take a
ton of complexity out of the picture. Just started playing with
FlexiContent for Joomla, and am looking at that for a possible
integration candidate.

Anybody coming to the Joomla Developer Conference this weekend? I got
offered a lightning talk, and am wondering what folks would like to
see.

Ok, so since someone has been singing the praises of MongoDB, and others
have been mentioned, I figured I'd provide a contrarian view and see if you
can convince me otherwise.

I'm a big fan of relational databases.  Have been using them since I
graduated from college in 1993, starting with DB2, followed with MySQL[and
boy was THAT interesting.  DB2 was always like 2 years behind all the neat
features in other relational databases.  Then I went to MySQL and not only
did it lack those features, it lacked a lot of what solid, dependable DB2
had!  And it was on purpose!  They deliberately choose to keep MySQL lean
and mean and avoid things like foreign keys, stored procedures, and such.]

My experience is that almost any application can be broken up and thought of
as tables.  Especially in the business world, people naturally think in
terms of spreadsheets since the spreadsheet is king there.  And a
spreadsheet is nothing but a table.

And by putting everything in well documented[ha ha!] tables with consistent
column and table naming schemes, even power users can use query tools such
as Navicat to build their own queries and reports easily.   So by keeping
everything in a well understood industry standard format, we lower the skill
level needed to access and create reports on the underlying data - always a
good thing since I personally hate it when someone asks me to create a
report on sales from last year "just like this other one except we need to
include wholesale prices",  There is no challenge there, no fun.  Just pure
grunt work.

So all this talk of moving away from SQL makes me nervous.  Will cluefull
users still be able to envision the data so they can pull reports.  Heck,
are there even the user friendly point and click tools for them to do
so?[Personally I never use the query builder in Navicat and find it tedious,
but I know plenty of power users who CAN do that].

To me, it looks like migrating to this new method of storing data will end
up "locking" the business data up in a format that raises the cost to access
the data.  It reminds me of the way Magentoo is designed, with those oh so
cool tables for storing field values without creating new table fields.
Sure, it may make it easier to expand/change the system, but having to do
multiple joins to the same dang table to get different pieces of data makes
the data harder to get to for non programmers!

My feeling on business data is that business data belongs TO the business
creating it.  Not to some programmer who is the only one who can access
it[or worse, to some company that stores it in a proprietary format and
won't allow the data to be exported!] - so at the moment, I'm not seeing
that sort of access for data in MongoDB.   Command line pseodo queries is
not enough, I want to know the data is easy to get out for a power user -
not me.

I kind of think they are different tools for different jobs. NoSQL has
risen out of the need for massively scalable databases. For the vast
majority of apps, using one is overkill, and probably leads to the
kind of messy data access and reporting scenarios you envision.

In other words, that "How do I query it?" "You write a map reduce
function in Erlang." cartoon is right on the money.

You may enjoy playing with Core Data using ObjC on an iPhone. Kind of the
next evolution I think.

I stick to SQLite these days. It guides the cruise missile and probably your
watch.  I guess after 20 years playing with DBs (and still learning
something new everyday), going back to my roots now.  ;-)

People,

I have installed lamp & wamp several times in the pst and for the last 24
hours I have
been trying to install wamp and php using FF will ask me  " What should I do
with this file"

Annoying because I follow the steps that I remembered and it did not
worked.  Then I look
at the installations instruction and followed them and still it would not
work., thenI tried
installing wamp using the wampserver.exe and that failed.

I am frustrated, I do not know what in the heck I am doing wrong.  I am not
able to set up
apache running PHP.  PHP runs from command line but not via the web.

I have 4 computers at home and 3 at work that I have set up before and they
worked.

Yesterday I decided to install the latest apache and PHP and It is not
working.  I do not what
to do to make it work.   HELP!!!

I used PHP 5.2.8 and APACHE 2.2.11 on windows XP

Is there something that I am not aware off when doing this type of
installation?

Thanks,

N?stor :-)

Try Xampp ? easy to install and run ? you?re current system doesn?t have php
enabled in apache or it would appear as a ?text/html? to the browser which
would make it render.

 

Depending on what you?re trying to test ? I?d also recommend VS.php

Well, the documentation says to do this:
LoadModule php5_module "C:/php528/php5apache2_2.dll"
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
PHPIniDir "C:/php528"

And that is how my previous installation were done but I can not see it
working on FF but it is working on IE
I am at a loss for words on this problem.

First off, try testing in another browser because I doubt that this is a
Firefox specific issue.

Second, try putting a static HTML page on the server and requesting that. It
should show up fine.

Third, and really, this should be one of the first things you always do,
check the error logs for Apache and PHP. Chances are that there is something
in there that would tell you what it causing the problem. Initial guesses
would be that either Apache is throwing an error while trying to load PHP or
that the content type and/or handler for .php files is not being set
properly.

One other thing to check on is whether the PHP code is actually executing.
Try putting some error_logs or writing to a file or anything that you can
verify outside of a browser. If these things happen, then it is a problem of
Apache not knowing how to serve the file, not whether it should be executed
or not.

Try these things first, then let us know of anything you find. I can almost
guarantee that it is an Apache configuration issue.

DISCLAIMER: I'm a certified Oracle8 DBA, so don't think I'm some young
web developer who doesn't know data modeling or relational theory.

Here's my passionate plea ;-)

For CMS/WCM purposes, there's nothing better. I know of a site that is
in the millions of views daily that has nothing but MongoDB on the
backend, and not only is performance great but so is ease of code
maintenance. The performance benefits have been so significant that
they implemented real-time analytics as well - and they don't cache
anything coming in from MongoDB, as there's no need.

For commerce systems, you still have separate "tables" for users,
products and orders. What you don't have is a third normal form schema
with 45,000 tables and a massive performance and maintenance headache.
I've launched a commerce site myself very recently that sustains 900
requests per second. Absolutely sure this would not have worked as
well with a relational engine under the hood.

I'd go as far as to say that the next-generation document databases
are doing a lot to challenge the norms. Remember when foreign keys
were considered essential for data integrity? Remember when a database
was only considered ready when it was fully ACID and ANSI SQL
compliant?

Think again. Part of me hates this transition, because I've spent the
past 20 years really mastering the horse and buggy; but these jet
planes sure are fast, and they do change the game. Just don't try to
ride one like a horse!

This might be a bit of a side topic, but does anyone have any good resources
to read about this noSQL stuff?  I've looked VERY briefly at MongoDB, but
didn't think it was anything that amazingly fantastical that everyone seems
to be talking about.  But if it is the next generation, I'd like to be on
board.

Thanks,
Brian

Do you have any tools to look at the headers coming back from the server?

My guess is that the content-type or disposition is being set weird. The PHP
script is *only* doing phpinfo() right?

Yes, the PHP script is only doing phpinfo();

I have firebug install on firefox but that does not allow me to see anything
during the PHP operation because it
just aske me to save it.

What tools should I use to see the headers?

Do you have the following in your php loader?

 

AddHandler php5-script .php

AddType text/html .php

Take a look at LiveHTTPHeaders add-on for Firefox (
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829 ) which should show you
what you need to see.

Of course, you could always hit up telnet or curl (or any other number of
command line tools) to connect to the server and check out the responses.

module.

Maybe http://nosql-databases.org/ :-)

You also might want to see if there's a NOSQL meeting taking place 
nearby (or a talk featuring Mongo, Hadoop, Tokyo Cabinet or Couch).

What I like is that a lot of these databases use REST interfaces and some 
of them use JSON (which scales really well).

BTW, I did try the first one and it made no difference but again that is for
CGI.

You can see Dwight Merriman, founder of 10gen (MongoDB), and his most
recent presentation online in HD:

    http://www.mefeedia.com/watch/25943056

In it he discusses the different categories of noSQL databases, as
well as the differences, strengths/weaknesses of each implementation
approach. Actually a good overview of noSQL, not just about MongoDB.

In the end you should play with one or more just to get a feel for how
they would impact your development. I think it is very understated how
going non-relational can benefit the development process.

Ajai's points on JSON is also a killer feature of sorts, as you can
really leverage rich data structures (and nested data) via Ajax and
RIA with zero transformation needed.

My previous post ended with a somewhat silly analogy of horse
carriages and jet planes. However that is why most folks are usually
unimpressed when they evaluate - as they make the mistake of forcing a
relational model on a document database.

I'm assuming that the extra characters that I'm seeing at the end of all of
those lines ( ?,? )  are a result of copying/pasting from various places and
aren't actually being output.

It seems a little odd that your phpinfo would be putting out a
content-length of 44.. if I'm reading that right. Have you checked your php
error log? Try explicitly calling error_log to write to it. Also, what do
you see in the file you actually download? Is it the result of phpinfo()?

Thanks for all the well thought out replies .

My takeaway is that these databases have 2 important benefits.

1) Performance - they perform much much better than relational databases
2) Ease of programming - they make it faster and easier to code your apps

The big downside seems to be reporting, they lock you into needing a
programmer for reporting.  Which, if it makes it easier to program, is not
so bad.  And I can definitely see the attraction for internal applications
for a company that has an IT staff that can include a couple of part time
programmers[a couple for turnover reasons].

I'm not seeing it as a good fit for the company that wants to hire "experts"
to come in and do their work.  Or the small business setting up a site where
they will have a consultant set it up, and they will use it.  The former
mainly because until it is in widespread enough use, it makes it much harder
to find someone else to work on it - and being locked to a single provider
is never a good thing.  The latter for the same reason.

So I can see the use..... I'm just not a "cutting edge" person.  I use tried
and true solutions where at the end of the day Gary is not a requirement for
future changes to the system.

Tom,

the attached file was the headers for the index.php file, the php file that
works,.  I set up to display the
php errors on C:\tmp/php_errors but nothing is displaying on the file.  I
tested a small php file that has a loop and that works.  I even copied an
existing phpinfo.php file from another server that works  just in case I had
an error
on my current phpinfo.php file and that one did not worked also.

I can see this happening if it was my first time but I have done this many
other times and I never had the rpoblem

Ayayayyyyyyy.......

I can try installing again but I did that yesterday like 5 times and I even
used the wampserver.exe to have it doen automatically and that failed.

I guess I can try one more time  :-(

Thanks,

N?stor :-)

OK, I did the install again using apache 2.2.14 and php5.2.11

So far I can tell you is  that
1) phpinfo.php works again
2) a couple of my php scripts work.
3) I download ans install Drupal (intense PHP) and now I am getting
"connection to server was reset"

The interesting thing is when I go to my drupal site I get a window to sent
the error results to tell Microsoft about the pproblem.
"Apache HTTP Server has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are
sorry for the inconvenience."

At least I have my server working again.

Thanks,

N?stor ;-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MongoDB and others, convince me. :-)

Here here!  I think that context is everything and the points you made 
are spot on.....so why this huge interest in non-relational db's now?  
I'd say it in 2 words Web 2.0 (well actually 1 word and 1integer).

Could Facebook, Twitter and any of the others have any idea of what 
their db should look like or evolve to?  I doubt it, and so for these 
cases where the industry is not mature the non-relational makes perfect 
sense.  But for mature industries, then organizing the data with clearly 
defined attributes and organization will give the biggest bang for the 
buck to the business who's inevitably using it (and paying the bills). 

It'll be interesting to see as these new industries mature and the next 
generations have a better idea of what they'll be/need to do whether 
there will be a migration away from the non-relational...

Anyway, just my 2 cents from a neophyte who knows just enough to be 
dangerous.

Do you start your php code with <?php or just <?
If the latter is not rendering, update your php.ini to include

short_open_tag = On

I just installed xampp onto a usb thumbdrive the other day and found 
some of my lazy-programmed scripts were not running and that was the reason.

i'm not a windows guy, but this does not look like an http/site error log.
99% of the time the issue will jump out at you if u check the logs.

the error.log :

Yes, I am starting to think that PHP is having problems accessing Mysql.  I
installed PHP and Apache but I am still using
my original mysql 5.0.    I did not have ths problem before I updated php
and Apache.  I probably need to install a Mysql client or something like
that.
I am also a Linux guy but evey once in a while I need to deal with MS
problems.
What is making this hard is that there is no clue of what is happening or
that the error is a mysql error.  I could see in the
Event Viewer the following message:
"Faulting application httpd.exe, version 2.2.14.0 faulting module
php5ts.dll, version 5.2.11.11, fault address 0x0000ac6a"

Now I need to ggole it and see what can be, but I believe that it is a php
not talkign to mysql.

Thanks,

Nestor ;-)

Just a thought, are your extensions (mysql.dll, etc) working properly? On
windows, they can be a pain to configure.

In my experience, Apache crashes like the one you described happen because
of misconfigured extensions.

Which is why I can only second what someone else mentioned before: download 
the package from ApacheFriends and install it. Then make sure that everything 
works. Then replace their htdocs folder with yours, then copy in the MySQL 
databases without overwriting the system databases followed by the table 
update. This approach works well, but has one flaw. I never can manage to get 
the MySQL user accounts and rights to copy over correctly, so I just create 
the few user accounts I have new. You may want to try backup&restore instead. 
Lastly, I uncomment the modules that I need for PHP in the php.ini. I keep a 
list of what I need for the projects that I run. One Apache restart later I am 
up and running.

I use ApacheFriends XAMPP in production use for almost ten years and I can 
only say two things about it: it always works and it is darn easy to set up. 
Sure, I don't learn about the detailed configurations and such, but I am happy 
with outsourcing that to Germany.

I guess my mysql.dll extension i snot working properly because PHP is not
talking to mysql at this time.
I taking the latest PHP5.2 and the latest apache2.2 .  They should work
together.

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

I am mor econvinced now that it is somthing to do with PHP talking to MYSQL
because I did install one of those packages (wampserver) last Thursday and
it was failing also.  My PHP files that do not have any calls to the
database
work but as soon as I use a php file that access myqsl I get that error
message.

Thanks,

OK Guys,

I found how to fix the problem.

There was actually nothing wrong.
The solution was just to reboot the windows machine.

I was reading some message in the internet and they said that they reboot
their machine and
thinks started to work.  I did the same and that did it.  that I hate about
MS machines..grrr...

I am mad also because I forgot that with MS you need to reboot.

Thanks for all your help!!!

I'm trying to play a sound on the browser using javascript play() method.
This worked fine on my Firefox browser but I keep getting errors on other

Hi Mohammad,

Use the iconv function like:

  $outstr = iconv('UTF-8', 'UCS-2BE', $instr);

The iconv function might be an extension but it's been available on
every PHP installation I have ever used.

You can also test the conversion using the 'iconv' commandline program like:

  linux$ iconv --from-code=UTF-8 --to-code=UCS-2BE /tmp/infile > /tmp/outfile

Of course you'll need to take the necessary precautions to ensure that
the input is UTF-8. So if for example the input is coming from an HTML
form, you will need to ensure that the content-encoding of the page is
UTF-8. Otherwise, if it is something like ISO-8859-1 you will get the
wrong result with non-Latin characters such as Arabic.

Also if you run the above commandline example in a terminal, it may
not have the required font to render the characters. But you can use
the 'hexdump' program to dump the outfile to hexadecimal and verify
that the conversion worked.

Finally, note that Windows uses UTF-16LE and Java uses UCS-2BE for
native encodings. Some of these encodings may look similar in fact
they are not the same. You may want to double check what encoding
you're really targeting.

Mike

He's trying to be funny, at the expense of being less than 20%
accurate. In all fairness the term noSQL is generic enough to no
longer be about specific features, as something like Project Voldemort
has a totally different featureset and target than MongoDB, which in
turn is not trying to solve the exact same problems as CouchDB or
hBase. I'd try to avoid sweeping generalizations about noSQL, but I
think he was just trying to be funny and not misinform.

Sorry about that folks - 8 years and nothing like that - although oddly,
we've had two similar incidents in as many weeks... and going through mbox
files isn't too fun.  Mailman might be showing its age.

Anyway, oddly, the spam messages themselves never ended up in my inbox for
whatever reason.  If anyone catches more messages like this, please contact
me directly, as sometimes I might miss them.

For what it's worth, I've not received any of those emails.
Either my corporate filters are doing their job, or perhaps some people are getting spam with the list name spoofed to appear like our lists.

Keep up the good work Hans.  I've had to do some digging through mbox in the past... it is NOT fun, but it is stable as all get out!

Sorry about that folks - 8 years and nothing like that - although oddly,
we've had two similar incidents in as many weeks... and going through mbox
files isn't too fun.  Mailman might be showing its age.

Anyway, oddly, the spam messages themselves never ended up in my inbox for
whatever reason.  If anyone catches more messages like this, please contact
me directly, as sometimes I might miss them.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XCache on windows - Can I see your xcache.ini?
Message-ID: <4B27C91E.4030609@projectskyline.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to setup xcache on window - it is listed in (phpinfo()):

This program makes use of the Zend Scripting Language Engine:
Zend Engine v2.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2007 Zend Technologies
    with Xdebug v2.0.3, Copyright (c) 2002-2007, by Derick Rethans
    with XCache v1.2.2, Copyright (c) 2005-2007, by mOo <<----

BUT it *doesn't* have a block entry like everything else. When I try to run:
if (extension_loaded('XCache')) - it fails - (Pulled this from the 
admin.php bundled w/xcache).

So, I take a look at anyone's xcache.ini for windows - I think I have it 
incorrectly configured.

Thanks,

- Ben

Just wondering if anyone here knows if/when Google will be releasing a PHP
client library for Google Wave to go with their Java and Python ones?

Google never releases php anything.  They are a C++/Java/Python shop.  They
have occasionally written some sample php code for tutorial purposes, but
they will not write a php library.

Ben,
I got it installed in about 30 mins with no problem using the ini that comes
with the distro.

Don't know what else to try.

Ben, are you certain that it can find your xcache.ini file?
I believe it should be in the phpinfo() up top as "additional ini files
parsed"

Ben,
I downloaded the binary from http://xcache.lighttpd.net/
Extracted the extension to the php/ext folder
Copied the whole xdebug.ini file to my php.ini
Restarted apache

I only had two problems.
1. Initially I downloaded the non-thread safe version when I am running
thread-safe php module. I recevied an error that told me this.
2. I had to copy the entire xdebug.ini over. I wanted to use just the admin
portion to check a successful install but it would never work.

Also, there are notes in the top of xdebug.ini that help in finding the
location. I used the 3rd option and used the extension_directory option.

Are you using IIS or Apache?

Adrian

Hello Adrian,

I'm using Windows w/Apache - I've done everything you've mentioned.
I see no errors in the apache logs or php logs.

I'm running PHP 5.2.5.
Thanks for you help,

In the meantime I've setup APC and have been experimenting with that.

- Ben

They got the Haskell column all wrong - or every row except the bottom
the image should have been:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] cheapest and best way to server 1TB worth of data per
	month
Message-ID: <7173a2fc0912241252h4fa22ee2nb4ec7774f603e18a@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

I need some expert advice.

Let's say I have about 2MB of static data (images, css, js) and I need
to serve about 1TB worth of it per month to users who visit this site.
 I know that means at least 500,000 page views per month (not
considering browsers caching images, etc).

What's the cheapest (but still fast) way to serve 1TB worth of static
data  per month?
A) AWS S3
     I think this comes out to about $180/month.
B) dedicated server
     With nginx or lighttpd

C) shared hosting
     godaddy?
D) ???

Thanks,
Konstantin

looks like godaddy has unlimited plan for $15/month! or 1.5TB/month for
$7/month

any comments on this?

D) Can you post the images to flickr or another free image hosting 
service and link directly to the images?
That would be free and I don't think there's any cheaper unless you get 
paid. :)

Considering you are talking about half a million page views a month
and you want it to be fast, I wouldn't consider the shared hosting
options. I say this from experience of using shared hosting services
where performance can take a hit from other heavy users on the same
box. I think I'd explore the dedicated server options.

Do you expect to have steady traffic on the web site, or spikes? With
spikes it might be better to use AWS S3, if it's cost effective and it
can ramp up quickly enough to handle the increase in traffic.

Hope this helps!

i think the advantage of S3 is now you have to learn S3. That knowledge
could be worth millions to your down the road. Think big! I have seen some
cloud/iphone integrated code, just about zero wait times to deliver some
heavy graphics manipulations over the network.

 I was pretty amazed at the speeds.


(PS Godaddy will probably be fine) :-)

Im seriously considering going with SimpleCDN.  For about $40/month =
1TB/month, which isn't too bad and there's no extra server to maintain!
I'm not sure what the traffic profile will look like, I expect it to be
steady with some spikes if we get some publicity...

I have the same fear as David, cuz I've had godaddy "transition" my site to
a bigger server without notifying me and resulting in a 7 day downtime
because I was using too much resources...

Edward, what are you saying?  You would go with godaddy?

Message-ID: <7173a2fc0912251629k34ae68fcx6643e842991786b6@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

Another kinda off-topic question but could be relevant to some people here
and I know there are a bunch of really smart people on this list, so why
not?

My site will need to be able to email their users upon certain actions, like
most site:
- user registration (for account activation)
- change email address
- forgot password
- alerts

These emails are NOT FOR MARKETING PURPOSES.

IMPORTANT: All emails that need to be sent out will be stored in various
tables in a database from which they will be processed and subsequently
removed.

I think I have only two real options:

1. Run my own my mail servers, using procmail and swiftmailer php package.

2. Use a third-party service to mail my users.

I would prefer #2 since that would mean I wouldn't have to:
- run and manage another box.
- won't have to really worry about configuration/optimization of mail
server.
- won't have to worry about my emails landing in SPAM directory (or will I
still have that problem?)


My question is: what 3rd party services are out there that can do this?


Thanks for any advice and Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

Konstantin

A mail server is to deal with programs that can't do mail on their own. 
Doesn't the PHP mail function or the PEAR::mail deal with sending mail 
without sendmail? Procmail is to sort through mail you as a user receive.

I'm a little confused on whether or not you have a full domain hosted or 
are you setting up your own server? Sorry, it's been a long day.

If you are setting up your server to host your own domain, then you can 
add the mail receipt in the set up. If you're on a hosted domain do they 
provide a control panel like CPanel or similar to receive mail? Or can 
you require that users provide off-domain e-mail addresses?

Again, I'm a bit muddled from the day.

Sorry, I meant to say postfix, not procmail.

I will be hosting the site on multiple dedicated servers.

Again, the emails that need to go out will be stored in various tables
in a database and be processed by scripts that will use the PHP
Swiftmailer package, which uses the postfix MTA.

The emails are all to external domains (like yahoo, gmail, hotmail, etc).

So what exactly are you asking?  Either way you're sending mail. You could relay through another smtp server if you want, but that may only have a few small benefits.

Not really - simply relying on SMTP from a PHP script is not really a 
reliable (or efficient) way to send out email. Much better to have a 
dedicated mail server that can queue the email, handle retries and 
bounces, etc. Your PHP script should just hand off the email to your mail 
server.

That's exactly what I'm doing :). But I'm trying to avoid having to
setup another box with postifx and all the other stuff on it.
Basically I don't want to maintain my own SMTP server. I'd like a 3rd
party service which I can just send the emails to and they would send
it out on my behalf

Okay, coffee's kicking it and I think I get this a little more. Of 
course, I could be wrong...

Check out DynDNS. I've used them for DNS and mail port altering services 
when I hosted my own site in-house (literally). Their support was always 
pretty good. When I get back to doing stuff this will be the first place 
I look for a solution.

What is your expected daily volume and how many distinct sending accounts do
you need[as opposed to email addresses]?  Is this for a non profit or
educational group, a government group, or a business?

Depending on your answer, I highly recommend looking into Google Apps, which
includes GMAIL branded on your own domain.  They handle all the hard stuff.

Standard  edition is free, Premier edition for business costs $50 a year per
account[not email address, but userid/password combo.  An account can have
multiple aliases]

http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html

I can't find the page with the sending limits at the moment, but my
recollection is that for free accounts, AN email acount cannot send more
than 500 messages a day, for a business pay account, 2000 messages a day,
non profits and educational groups can get Google Apps premier edition for
free which gets API access and more than the free account but less than
premier, so maybe 1000 messages?  Government groups can get premier at a
reduced rate.

You can safely and easily run Postfix on your existing application
servers. It's very efficient, especially since you are only sending
mail out, not accepting incoming messages. (Presumably you'll set the
Reply-To: address to a working mailbox at your company.)

There are two tricks to sending mail on your own: reverse DNS and
(increasingly) SPF headers.

You can get your upstream ISP to provide reverse DNS for your IP
addresses -- the name doesn't have to match the hostname of the
server, but it does have to look like a static assignment (so servers
don't think you're sending from a home network).

You set SPF records in the DNS for your domain name, and they should
assert that mail from your domain is allowed to be sent by your
servers.

You may also want to look into using Google App Engine and use that as
a CDN by keeping all of your static files on Google's servers.

Just a thought.

Hi!

Just a short note, is anyone interested in buying an IBM eServer 325 (2x AMD 
Opteron 250, 2GB RAM, 120GB IDE)? I'd pass it on for 150$ or best offer, 
location is Schenectady. Contact me off-list with questions - and sorry for

Crude survey via Google...

phpinfo -bcmath = 4 million hits
phpinfo +bcmath = 200 k hits

Ouch!!   Too bad.  I'd taken "written in pure PHP" to mean something a
little different from "requires an extension your users are unlikely to
have."  I guess it's a good thing I looked at the code sooner rather
than later.

Thanks!

I think you should compare google results vs something that every install has:

phpinfo +pcre - 357k
phpinfo +bcmath - 207k

It looks like more that 50% of installs have it.  Not great, but it
isn't that rare either.

I looked into using Google Apps Engine:

1. It's pretty fast!
2. The "free quotas" are pretty big, EXCEPT for the outgoing bandwith
(only 1GB/day = 30GB/month)
3. It's pretty simple to set it up.
4. It's very hard to automate versioning of static data - with a CDN,
it can pull the latest data from the origin server.

I will try out simplecdn, and let you guys know how it works when I launch.

Thanks for the suggestions.

Konstantin

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP error handling with simplexml_load_file questions.
Message-ID: <C82B7C4F-E4E6-4139-B9A7-E98F7D87B445@gmail.com>

I've been following the example for PHP error handling using  
simplexml_load_file as show in this example:

http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-simplexml.html

To test my PHP code, I put in a bogus URL, which failed and the PHP  
script caught it allowing me to control it in the program.

But when the actual URL's server is down, PHP gives errors about it  
and aborts the script. The error handling isn't caught by this method.  
I had a PHP script running for months without a problem and I guess it  
had just been lucky until recently not to encounter any network  
problems.

The CRON was nice enough to e-mail root errors from the script that it  
complained about:

PHP Warning:  simplexml_load_file(): php_network_getaddresses:  
getaddrinfo failed: Temporary failure in name resolution in  
blahblah.php on line 17
PHP Warning:  simplexml_load_file(http://example.com): failed to open  
stream: Connection timed out in blahblah.php on line 17
PHP Warning:  simplexml_load_file(): I/O warning : failed to load  
external entity "http://example.com" in blahblah.php on line 17

My impression is that the PHP program encountered these errors and  
simply aborted and didn't give my code a chance to execute.

Is the technique in this article wrong? What can be done to make this  
more robust cause networks won't be up and running all the time. Thanks!

Agreed wholeheartedly on that sentiment - oftentimes when I have a
question and need a little nudge, a quick search through NYPHP is all
I need. There are hundreds of threads that I've starred in GMail as a
result.

Thanks Hans and Hans, and everyone for a great place to hang out and share.

David,

I use curl every time I am accessing a remote resource.  I'd fetch the
content with curl, and process it as a string.  Using php's remote
resource is always flaky.  It doesn't work on some installs, may break
with ssl, doesn't support cookies reliably, can't handle http errors,
may or may not follow redirects, etc.  simple_xml_load_file() on a
remote resource is great for article writers because they don't have
to have a bunch of boilerplate curl code in the article, but it is a
mistake for a real application.

Regards,
John Campbell

Yeah, second that. I'm not a curl believer so I use PHP streams, but
same difference.

The reason I use sockets / streams is because you have very fine
control over both connection and transmission timeouts.
file_get_contents() and friends are perfectly happy to wait around for
30 seconds when connecting to a slow server.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT: Standard Data Import Tool?
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.00.0912291225510.58494@pluto.atopia.net>

Hi all,

I need to write a tool that somehow takes multiple data feeds (some xls 
files, some csv files, etc.), defines each format, 
verifies/validates/sanitizes the data, and imports it into standardized 
MySQL tables.

As an example, one feed might look like this:

First Name, Last Name, DOB

And another like this:

Name, DOB

And another:

DOB, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial

I need to somehow be able to say "For this source, this column needs to be 
split into two, and this other column is the date of birth column".  Once 
the data is parsed, it would need to be imported into standard MySQL 
tables:

first_name, last_name, birth_date, etc.

This is a simple example - the files and tables actually have 20-30 
columns each, so using mysqlimport or a simple shell script probably isn't 
the best option.

Are there open source tools out there that do this already?  If not, 
should I just build something?

Thanks,

-Matt

There are several issues all bundled up here.

First you have to define the file format(s) that your feeds come in so
that you can read them and isolate the data elements correctly.  Are
they CSV, TSV, XML, custom?
At the first (read) step you can do gross validation like validate the
source for correct character encoding, record separators, record
length etc.
You also want to define "layouts" for various feeds.  By defining the
layout, you can apply a set of processing instructions to transform
the received layout into the desired layout.
Once you have the data in the desired layout, you can then do finer
validation such as per field rules.  E.g. last name must
/(a-zA-Z'-){2,100}/
Then you can write an import routine that determines the correct
layout transformation to apply, reads the source, tranposes it,
validates it, stores it in the database, logs the event

Hi Greg,

That's pretty much how we had things mapped out.  Basic source validation 
in the beginning, then a more standard validation later on.  I guess my 
question was - is there any open source project that would help with this 
work flow, such as handling exceptions in the case of bad data, etc. etc.?

Looking to get some views (and best practices) on code reviews.  I used to
work at IBM on their early version of Websphere (as UI designer, not coder)
where our group had code reviews on a regular basis.  I'm now managing a
small dev team working on a new web site using Zend PHP/MySql and am curious
to know what current practices are for reviews in this sort of environment.
On the one hand it seems like it'd be somewhat redundant since we are a
small team and the left hand does know what the right hand is doing, but on
the other, I could see it being very useful to ensure that everyone is on
the straight and narrow to everyone's benefit (particularly as the team
grows).  Any good references as a starting point for approaches?  Appreciate
the direction -

If I understand your problem, then this may help:
http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/Introducing-the-Strategy-Pattern/
http://www.fluffycat.com/PHP-Design-Patterns/Strategy/


I would use it something like this:
$this->data = new DataStream($source);
$bool = new BasicValidate($this->data);
$bool = new DataMapper($this->data);
$bool = new LayoutBuilder($this->data);

if($bool) {
    $result = MysqlQuery($data);
}

Hello Peter,

At my current company we do both peer reviews and group code reviews.
The group code reviews seem to have the best impact, as the peer reviews 
have naturally ceased to happen.

Our group code reviews happen bi-monthly and during the time (usually an 
hour) developers working on different
clients within the company will show high level (run the code, interact 
w/the UI, etc) and also walk through the source
code showing all the major components.

The audience is typically programmers, but is open to anyone within the 
company.

In the past I've also worked in companies where a senior developer will 
review junior developers major commits. What defines a "major commit" 
differs within companies, but this was a great way to make sure the new 
hires are obeying coding standards, not introducing new bugs, and are
using appropriate libraries ("hey, we already solved that, see abc lib...").

I think the reason that our current peer reviews died was because they 
are time consuming and they were not manager driven, they were peer 
driven, so people would either be too busy to schedule something with a 
peer, or just forget. Plus, since management isn't' involved, besides 
getting a peer to compliment your work, management wouldn't directly 
hear of your accomplishments via this channel.

 > "On the one hand it seems like it'd be somewhat redundant since we

I don't think this is true - even on a small team I find most developers 
are not that familiar with the work of their teammates.

Consider Yahoo pipes.  They already do all this and then will provide you
with an export.  So push everything through the pipes and export it as JSON
and then you don't need to code them all yourself.

Gmail?  Wouldn't it be easier and more efficient to just store all that
email in a mongodb ?

Hmmm, good idea, we are recently heavily exploring mongoDB for our projects 
needs, and it sounds very good. Whenever no DBMS fir your needs, always look at 
MongoDB and you would get something of it.

I have almost become fan of it :)

Hi folks,

I need to search for and replace a string inside many PHP (source) files

I was thinking of using http://pear.php.net/package/File_SearchReplace
but it's not maintained anymore.

1. Any suggestions how I should approach this problem?
2. What tools do you recommend?
3. Should I be on the look out or concerned about any gotcha's since
this is actual source code, not normal text?

Thanks for any ideas!

This is built into Eclipse, as far as I know.  Search (menu) -> file -> replace.

Hey folks,

I went with the following and it works nicely:

$path_to_file = 'path/to/the/file';
$file_contents = file_get_contents($path_to_file);
$file_contents = str_replace("what_to_replace","replace_with",$file_contents);
file_put_contents($path_to_file,$file_contents);

I would suggest in the future, doing a compare of the old and new file
contents and make a note when they are different.  That way if something
goes wrong, you know which files were changed.

> Looking to get some views (and best practices) on code reviews.

At my current work the devs do code reviews once a mod, project, or milestone 
is completed. The code review takes place before the peer review (show and 
tell to QA and TW) and other devs give input on best coding practices, 
violations of the development style guide, and general quality remarks. A 
first rough check happens during the tech spec review, but at that point only 
the approach is validated because no code exists at that time.
A lot of the review work can be covered by establishing a well-written, 
detailed style guide that everyone has to follow without exception. If you 
don't have a style guide, it may be a good time to create one and phase it in 
(there will be changes to the guide at the beginning). Adherence to the guide 
is supposed to make code be understandable to others in the team (or the rest 
of the world in case of OSS), follow common best practices, and include naming 
conventions as well as explicit rules on how to craft error messages and 
design the UI. Creating a style guide is a painful process, but one that is 
worth the effort especially when the team is likely to grow or has a high 
fluctuation of members (for whatever good or bad reason). It will also help 
when you contract out work. That may not be an issue right now, but when it 
comes up you are at least prepared.
Depending on how technical your QA staff is you may want to include them in 
the code review. While they may not be in a position to point out programming 
flaws by looking at the code they definitely will get a better understanding 
of workflow and learn why things are the way they are. QA should take a 
passive role here, their active role is in the peer review where they can make 
the developer crash his/her own code in front of an audience.

The mod/project/milestone based code review works fine for our developers 
because it focuses on one set of functionality and isn't all over the place as 
would be with reviews that take place on a recurring schedule. Also, all 
developers should properly prepare for code review and not just show up and 
give some cheap comments. The other devs should have looked at the code before 
and made notes. That makes the code reviews better and shorter because 
everyone is on the same page and knows what is going on. That includes 
knowledge of the functional requirements as well as the technical specs as 
well. If a dev sees the code to review for the first time during the meeting 
not much can be expected in regards to feedback. The code review meeting isn't 
really where the review should take place, but where the results of the 
individual reviews are discussed and action items are established. If the 
review went bad, schedule a second one before going into the peer review. At 
the time of the code review the developer should consider his code to be 
release ready, that means unit tests are completed and the whole thing works 
reliably. It is not enough to make sure that it compiles and maybe works for 
the intended use. QA will find the flaws anyway, so the devs may just fix it 
now rather than make more work for everyone. If that takes a day or two more 
I'd consider that time well spent.

Let me just start out by saying that I'm not a huge fan of the general
"process" of code reviews as I know them:

1. Gathering a bunch of folks into a room to talk about a piece of
code is a time-waster IMO
- Unless they are specifically working on that portion of the project
they are out of context from the get-go

2. You find something wrong, then what?  And what if it is not
"really" wrong (Jones uses a selection sort but sould have used an
insertion sort, and no one told him beforehand).  Do we hold up the
project until the engs figure out what is best, even though the code
"works"?  Good luck explaining that to mgmt.  And politically, it can
make Jones look bad unnecessarily, yet, as the new guy on the team, he
might not be familiar with the standards, practices, etc. of your
group.

I see the typical code-review process as reactive rather than
proactive.  Your time is better spent investing in a build process
that provides code coverage, PMD, checkstyle/codesniffer reporting and
of course insisting that developers need to write unit tests.  All of
this will give you and mgmt a better sense of where the code stands in
terms of quality and is all reusable.  In addition, daily, automated
performance testing will tell you if you're about to release something
that won't stand up to your traffic.

With that said, I do believe in code reviews for two scenarios:
1. Senior members should review commits of junior members.  We do this
as a one-on-one mentoring scenario.
2. Something that is broken in production and needs to be fixed right
now.  When things are broken, people tend to get worked-up.  Having
someone look over what you're about to check in at that point is a
good idea IMO.

Thanks,

Tom

I wrote a bunch of php using functions like getimagesize and get_headers.
Worked fine. 

 

Also, sudden the client is calling me saying to code is not working.

 

I look at it it's fine.  He's on the West Coast and off course I'm on the
East Coast.

 

It seems the http requests are randomly failing for him causing the code to
fail.

 

What to do?

Randomnly failing means what exactly? Any precise error messages or log 
entries?

(and "web site go boom boom" is not a precise error message :-)

 From the sysadmin side of my brain.

Check the apache server logs.
Use an anonomizer to get a different path.
Send me the URL, if that's okay, and I can test it out with my local 
routing.
Check server load.
CHeck ping response times. He may be having local network burps or 
routing issues. Happens even with the big boys.
Have him check using a different desktop.

The good part about errors like this is it's an opportunity to start a

Thanks, Leam.  I've pretty much bowed out of this project.

So, dude aka client sends his hosting provider an email.

They say it's the programmer's issue.

So, he reboots the http server and the issue is gone.

He's got major problems with not enough ram, etc, but is doesn't want to
deal with the upgrade.  The hosting providers backups have been crashing the
server.

I'm a programmer, not a miracle worker, technically.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Session timing out
Message-ID: <6A.0F.13308.3E9FB3B4@hrndva-omtalb.mail.rr.com>

I inherited a project where the login code had already been written.

 

The client asked me to stop the login from timing out the client and login
them out.

 

When I looked at the code, I didn't see anything that was calculating time
logged in.

 

It seems the system is automatically clearing the session variables.

 

So, I took a look at the php.ini file.  I thought the right variable to set
would be:

 

session.cache_expire

 

But, that doesn't seem to be it.

 

Does anyone know how to keep the session from clearing?

 

Michele

Good reference material that explains session length and how to override
defaults:

Aj., Ms. Waldman wrote the below, not me.

I posted the link to http://www.captain.at/howto-php-sessions.php in
response.

but your link is definitely worth a review too.  I spend a lot of time
at php.net needless to say.

Hi Adrian,

Thanks for your reply.  I'm more looking for software that will help with 
the flow, not necessarilly information on how to properly design software 
from scratch.  But looks like we may do this from scratch in the end.

Thanks!

-Matt
