<PRE>You know, I'm not even on the frontend list. I missed that.

CSS/PHP MENU

This URL: <A HREF="http://www.giba.us">http://www.giba.us</A>

...is a simple but elegant PHP website I designed and built that has an
example of a very simple CSS one-level menu that also uses PHP to grab
the page name out of the URL request and changes the CSS class on that
matching menu item from &quot;regular&quot; to &quot;hot&quot;. The web pages are named
literally: webcams.php or tolls.php to match the CSS menu titles and CSS
style names too.


JQUERY

This URL: <A HREF="http://www.capehazeinsider.com">http://www.capehazeinsider.com</A>

...is also a bigger busier PHP website that I designed and built and
this site uses jquery on literally every page for: image effects,
show/hide/glide divs, manage external links, create popup overlays, page
scrolling, tabbed content...

I highly recommend the jquery code products which are just awesome and
have super high degree of &quot;cross browser&quot; compatibility. 

I even hauled out the jquery big guns to create one single show/hide div
effect in the Tolls section of the above noted GIBA website. 

I have two websites in development now that will use jquery for quite
nice image effects and content scrolling. 

___________________________

I don&#8217;t believe that I am using any browser specific code just generic
things like: border-left, padding-bottom, margin, width and z-index. But
you know I do use some more rare CSS like: line-height, letter-spacing
and white-space; and well they work quite accurately in so many browsers
that I use them all the time. 

There are so many high quality CSS multi-level menus already online that
are made from nothing but nested ordered lists and styled with some
tasty but very generic CSS. You can start at www.alistapart.com

Now, me I don't guarantee anything (especially not in writing), but I do
use
words such as code is &quot;targeted for assured compatibility with&quot; blah
blah.

As far as I can tell, speaking with one handy broad paint stroke, as
long as
the JavaScript code in question is always addressing everything in the
DOM
via the general and proper &quot;getElementById()&quot; method including XML=like
child elements (and nothing in any older style), then this JavaScript
code
is current, correct and sufficiently &quot;cross browser, platform
independent&quot;
to work in all relevant and widely-distributed browsers. If this type of
modern democratic ECMAScript breaks in any old browser, then it is very
likely that that browser is TOO old and is likely a security hazard to
code
down to in this day and age. And so I wouldn't bother to do that and I
would
tell the client so. And that gets the &quot;old browser compatibility&quot;
albatross
off the table too. Yeah, nice.

And so once again, I find that Opera, IE, Safari and FF can all play
ball
just by coding to clean modern standards.

I don't use layouts that stretch to 100% page width. That is a CSS
control
nightmare. I make one master relatively positioned outer div container
of a
fixed width of 900 - 1100 px and then every other div is an absolutely
positioned child div inside the master div.  


--- New Message --

First, we might want to take this over to the front-end list.  I am
cross
posting this to that list so the discussion can continue on the relevant
list.  I can imagine there are some people rolling their eyes right now.


Second, how are you handling your CSS menus with no browser specific
coding?
I would love to see some examples.  I know I haven't found a way without
some browser specific coding and CSS.
