<PRE>This is just my exceptionally small irreverent dos centavos on this
topic. 

For about two years now, it seems one has been pretty much able to
develop almost anything desired using virtually any CSS and any
JavaScript (and using big heavy image files to boot) in 1000+ pixel wide
designs and its all good. 

And at this time, if one were to find that one needs to spend too much
hard time reviewing browser compatibility issues, then it is almost
axiomatic that the code itself is not sufficiently or democratically
&quot;cross browser and platform independent&quot; enough in the first place.
Essentially: a) don't use any IE specific code; b) don't use any code
that does not run in IE; and c) especially important, don't use any code
that don&#8217;t run in IE Mac. Just not ever. Do something else. Use some
Flash gadget. If you don&#8217;t do a, b or c; all the code vets itself and
will be browser independent and automagically run on old browsers too
boot going way back. 

Lastly, try to use &lt;doctype&gt; XHTML &quot;Transitional&quot; to be easy on yourself
and all your friends. You'd be surprised how many &quot;browser&quot;
compatibility issues are actually and simply &lt;doctype&gt; issues. &quot;Strict&quot;
breaks a lot of CSS and indirectly the JavaScript code.  And that
heartache is simply not necessary. 

Then browser compatibility issues seem to just vanish.  

Warmest regards,

Don't work you aren't raining on my parade.  It's more like a trail of
tears
for me.  (If you don't know what a trail of tears is then you can Yahoo!
It.)

I've had problems with running virtual machines on my computer.  The
last
time I tried it failed on me and I didn't have more time to look into
it.

Using this website saves me from having a ton of more software loaded on
my
one overloaded ancient pc.

I don't need it extensively so it's a good solution for me.  If I was
doing
more heavy css testing I might have to consider something else, but it
fits
my needs of periodic testing.  If you have a group subscription then the
price is nominal.

Plus, I don't test one at a time.  I select many browsers at once and in
renders them all about 15 minutes later, while I'm doing something else.

If there's a specific problem, then I can put my attention to it.
