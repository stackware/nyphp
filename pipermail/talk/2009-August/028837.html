<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding PHundamentals, it's certainly been a great resource over the
</I>years
&gt;<i> &gt; thanks to the time and effort put into it, and the quality/participation
</I>of
&gt;<i> &gt; the list members.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It has, obviously, stalled and become a bit outdated itself.  Picking
</I>them
&gt;<i> &gt; back up would be a great thing, although time obviously is always the
</I>most
&gt;<i> &gt; scarce commodity.  If someone would want to help picking them back up,
</I>it'd
&gt;<i> &gt; be a great thing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And in fact with today's Web 2.0 facey-spaces and twitter-books, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even more value would come.  As part of PHundamentals, we could also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; construct an open source project to facilitate the PHundamentals
</I>process.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We'd just need some people (far or near to NYC) to help out... takers?
</I>
&gt;<i> Hi Hans,
</I>
Hi Bev,

&gt;<i> I can't offer much in the way of expertise, but I can certainly offer my
</I>&gt;<i> time. It's the least I can do considering what a great resource this
</I>&gt;<i> list has been. The way I see it, helping out in some capacity would not
</I>&gt;<i> only allow me to give back a little, but would also almost surely result
</I>&gt;<i> in learning something new &amp; useful.
</I>
Actually expertise isn't required... just time and organization :)

For everyone's benefit, let me recap quickly how PHunnys have worked in the
past.

The original concept was to form articles based on mailing list/community
feedback and sharing of experience.  Perhaps it could be considered an early
&quot;crowdsourcing&quot; before it became a buzzword.

So the PHunnys editor would pose a question to the list, encourage
discussion, ask for other opinions, and try to garner as much feedback/etc
as possible.  Then, build the responses into an article and post it online.

Originally, the purpose was to form best practices articles, but I could see
this expanding - for instance, to include a general tally/poll/listing of
people's techniques, and pros/cons of each (rather than just a single best
practice).

Take for instance the recent/ongoing discussion about short tags and server
settings.  A lot of good information has travelled the list because of these
threads, and the PHunny editor would combine these into an article.

The topics of discussion would also be &quot;crowd sourced&quot; and I have a listing
somewhere of some topics we had considered covering in the past.

&gt;<i> Please feel free to contact me directly if you feel I can make a useful
</I>&gt;<i> contribution of some kind.
</I>
Thanks again Bev, I'll also follow-up with you directly as well.

I also encourage anyone else who might be interested in participating, to
join the Org list - we can continue general organizational discussion over
there.

Best,

H
