<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah something like this could be handy, certainly.  I typically
</I>push/adapt
&gt;<i> &gt; an object into the template which is property overloaded.  Then
</I>something
&gt;<i> &gt; like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;?=$Object-&gt;FirstName?&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm afraid that this is getting us back to magic_quotes_gpc:
</I>
Negative - magic_* is global type behavior that's automatic - evil...

&gt;<i> because now I might want to write
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> $first_name=$Object-&gt;FirstName;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     and then do something with $first_name that isn't writing it into
</I>&gt;<i> HTML.  magic_quotes_gpc was effective protection against a certain
</I>
But you'd always be writing into HTML.  The escaping as it's done above is
only after a regular data object has been adapted/pushed into an HTML
template.  The original data is never changed, and the escaping is use case
specific.  Back in my model/controller, my data object gives raw data, just
as it's stored.

I could write an adapter and push data in, that let's say, is for SQL - JSON
- CSV - XML - etc.  Each adapter would wrap the data as appropriate.  If I
had an adapter for MySQL SQL generation and one for Oracle SQL generation,
they would even escape things differently, based on the type of SQL (and
connection resource/charset/etc in fact).  Very different from magic_*

&gt;<i> category of HTML injection faults,  but it made it difficult to write
</I>&gt;<i> entirely correct code that processes the content of strings.  I prefer
</I>&gt;<i> the model of &quot;escape at the time of output&quot; rather than preemptive
</I>&gt;<i> escaping:  particularly these days,  where you might be escaping a
</I>&gt;<i> variable to be a Javascript string literal instead of an HTML code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Today people are realizing that HTML/Javascript injection attacks
</I>&gt;<i> are difficult to stop (there are lots of clever ways to inject
</I>&gt;<i> Javascript that you'd never think of),  and some systems are taking
</I>&gt;<i> different approaches.  ASP.NET,  for instance,  has an &quot;application
</I>&gt;<i> firewall&quot; built in that looks for dangerous inputs in form variables and
</I>&gt;<i> that will abort your application if you get fed junk.  Although my first
</I>&gt;<i> impression is that this is &quot;magic_quotes_gpc all over again&quot;,  and I've
</I>&gt;<i> definitely seen the system block legitimate input,  Microsoft has done a
</I>&gt;<i> good job of justifying this behavior.
</I>
No argument with HTML injection being a mess, but the above example is
exactly &quot;escape at the time of output&quot; - and escape based on the exact
destination, so it's very granular.

&gt;<i> &gt; Outputs correctly escaped (or processed in any other way depending on
</I>what
&gt;<i> &gt; the overload wants to do) content.  Quite handy and has proved
</I>effective.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It does seem that it'd be handy to have some type of &quot;stdout&quot; processing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hook that can be overridden, while providing a shorthand for working in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; templates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It makes some people feel dirty,  but you can do this with global
</I>&gt;<i> variables,  assuming your template system remembers to set them when you
</I>&gt;<i> get in or out of a template.  My own &quot;php on nails&quot; system has quite a
</I>
Mine does - they aren't &quot;global&quot; but scoped only for that template.  When an
object is pushed in, it's adapted/wrapped with an object that is designed
specifically for output in whatever type of template I'm dealing with.

&gt;<i> few functions that behave differently if serving a web page or run from
</I>&gt;<i> the command line.
</I>
Ditto - PHP on nails, I like that...
