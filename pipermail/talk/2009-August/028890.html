Oooo, good page. Kind of bit scary looking, but good nonetheless.

&gt;<i> As for verbosity, I'm all for it if it's in the name of clarity. You
</I>&gt;<i> don't need to be cryptic for your code to work. Just the opposite, take
</I>&gt;<i> whatever steps you think you need to detail what you are doing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I often start with a simple statement telling what I expect the
</I>&gt;<i> following code to do, such as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> // This extracts the full name of the tutor from the database
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and then I write code to do that. Each step is clearly laid out with
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. If I have to use extra variables to understand what's
</I>&gt;<i> going on, that's not a big deal in my book, but clarity is.
</I>
Pretty much every line of my code is commented--if it wasn't I'd never
remember how to do anything from one day to the next--I only took out
the comments because I didn't want to bore you guys with it. I feel
better knowing that it's okay to be verbose, so thanks for that.

&gt;<i> Take your time, think things out, and organize your code into small
</I>&gt;<i> solution for small problems. Understand each step. Eventually, the
</I>&gt;<i> bigger problems will reduce into small problems and you'll find you've
</I>&gt;<i> finished. And you've finished you will understand what it does.
</I>
I think that may be where I've often been going wrong--i.e. I try to
think about all of it at once, then I get confused and panic. Great
advice; thanks.

&gt;<i> Normalizing tables is not intuitive, or at least it was not for me. The
</I>&gt;<i> simple rule is to not duplicate data in your database. For example, if
</I>&gt;<i> you have a Customer table that holds the name and address of someone and
</I>&gt;<i> a Purchase table shows what the person purchased, then you do not have
</I>&gt;<i> to repeat the name and address field in the Purchase table. Instead, you
</I>&gt;<i> use the index of the person from the Customer table to identify them,
</I>&gt;<i> such as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Customer table
</I>&gt;<i> id first_name last_name address
</I>&gt;<i> 345 Bev Woohoo 123 Tulip
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Item table
</I>&gt;<i> id item_name cost
</I>&gt;<i> 1576  Hair Setter  39.95
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Purchase table
</I>&gt;<i> id customer_id item_purchased
</I>&gt;<i> 2003  345  1576
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you will review the above tables, you will see that by looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> Purchase table, you can deduce the customer 345 (you), purchased item
</I>&gt;<i> 1576 (Hair Setter) for $38.95. Neat huh?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, you can add things like inventory to the Item table and date
</I>&gt;<i> of purchase to the Purchase table, and zip code to the Customer table,
</I>&gt;<i> but this example was simply to show you how these three tables can be
</I>&gt;<i> used to provide the data you want without repeating the data anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> Everything is done via indexes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>
Good stuff. Lack of normalization has cause me a lot of grief so far.
I've been doing some additional reading on it and I'm starting to
understand it a little, but every new example helps.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm currently trying to redo everything, but with limited success as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to grope my way through the fog of my inexperience results in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequent rounds of tripping &amp; falling face-first into the mud. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventually figure stuff out and inch my way up a little, but it's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slow, painful climb.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you know some other way, please let me know because that's the way I
</I>&gt;<i> learn.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>
I wish I knew another way. No, that's a lie--I enjoy learning. The more
difficult the challenge, the greater the feeling of accomplishment when
you finally get it right.

&gt;&gt;<i> Sometimes I sort of feel like Sisyphus. *sigh*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Try Penicillin -- I hear that works.  :-)
</I>
LOL
