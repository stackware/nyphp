<PRE>Somehow my earlier reply to this went only to tedd instead of the list.
I guess I need to hit &quot;reply to all&quot; from now on. Anyhoo...

Gah! I hate hearing, &quot;I need you to make a change. It's something
simple, so it should be really easy.&quot; Uh-huh, and you're making that
assumption based on...???

I think FrontPage, and to a certain extent Dreamweaver &amp; other WYSIWYG
editors, have created this deceptive &quot;it's easy&quot; notion. MS Office
doesn't help with it's one-click &quot;publish to web&quot; options.

Don't get me wrong--Dreamweaver is a great tool that I use it every day
for both HTML &amp; PHP, but I know how to hand code and I never, ever work
in design mode. I like it for its organization, synchronization, and
code completion abilities (I'm an awful typist). I also like the new
code navigation &amp; associated files abilities in CS4 that let me work in
split view and easily jump around my code. I've never worked with the
server behaviors though--that has always struck me a a very, very bad
idea for someone who's still learning PHP.

Good stuff, thanks!

&gt;<i> And lastly, none of this is static. I spend time every day learning

Exactly. As I speak, there's a designer on one of the forums I frequent
who's insisting on letting PHOTOSHOP write his code for him, and then
trying to edit it in Dreamweaver. Naturally, his designer's eye wants
things to look a certain way and that's not happening because he has
almost no knowledge of HTML, CSS or javascript. The positively hideous
code soup that Photoshop created isn't helping. I like to &quot;pay it
forward&quot; and help people, but only if they're will to make an effort to
learn &amp; practice. I'm not touching this one.

&gt;<i> &quot;I've learned something new every day of my life -- and I'm getting
</I>&gt;<i> damned tried of it.&quot;
</I>
LOL, nice quote.
