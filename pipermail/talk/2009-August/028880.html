I need to be pay more attention to the differences between the way PHP &amp;
MySQL handle things. Becuase they always seem to go hand in hand, it's
easy for me to forget that they're two separate languages.

&gt;<i> Just because I couldn't come up with a case for using NULL (and I tried
</I>&gt;<i> to find one) doesn't mean there is one. Dan is right and his example is
</I>&gt;<i> spot on. My explanation wasn't wrong, but incomplete.
</I>
Understood.

&gt;<i> I fired up my rusty PHP IDE and tried a few things. Turns out that SQL
</I>&gt;<i> is way more picky about what NULL is, whereas PHP considers NULL often
</I>&gt;<i> as 0 or an ampty string. For example...
</I>
&lt;snip&gt;

Wow, thanks for taking the time to do that. At some point between now &amp;
next weekend I'm going to gather everyone's examples and play around
with them so I can see what happens for myself.

&gt;<i> So, what I propose you keep in mind is that PHP knows about NULL, but
</I>&gt;<i> treats it as if it is 0 for numerical variables or as an empty string.
</I>&gt;<i> In SQL it is not the case. If PHP's behaviour is right or wrong can be
</I>&gt;<i> hotly debated. I like that it doesn't take it too serious with the
</I>&gt;<i> variable type, but just to assume that some undefined variable is out of
</I>&gt;<i> a sudden 0 is quite bold. But that's the way it is and when one knows
</I>&gt;<i> about it one can deal with it.
</I>
I'll keep that in mind.

&gt;<i> See, I hate programming and programming hates me. I do like programming
</I>&gt;<i> in PHP, because PHP isn't so anal about stuff like this as Java or C.
</I>&gt;<i> That makes me think less. The problem is that you might end up with
</I>&gt;<i> really bad results. For example when no submission is an error
</I>&gt;<i> condition, but submitting an empty string or 0 is fine. In that case
</I>&gt;<i> having NULL be the same as zero is not what you want. So while for most
</I>&gt;<i> cases PHP's assumptions work out fine I wouldn't count on PHP being
</I>&gt;<i> always right.
</I>
That's an important point, knowing that PHP can sometimes be a little
too forgiving.

&gt;<i> You are welcome, just keep in mind that PHP and SQL aren't the same,
</I>&gt;<i> even when we often mush them together in code.
</I>
I have a feeling you guys aren't going to let em forget it. ;)
