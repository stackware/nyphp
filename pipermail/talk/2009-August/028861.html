<PRE>Hi Dan,

This is really important stuff and I don't remember it being covered in
any of my &quot;beginner&quot; books. Grrr.

&gt;<i> If you tried to create a table with a name called &quot;desc&quot; in it without 
</I>&gt;<i> delimiting it, MySQL would have complained to you up front, saving you 
</I>&gt;<i> the agony.
</I>
The thing is, I have no idea how I managed to delimit the identifiers. I
created my everything using phpMyAdmin--could that have been the
culprit? The reason I ask is because I just tried it again and MySQL
didn't complain. Since you said it should be complaining, I decided to
attempt the same using a trial version of Navicat that I downloaded a
few days ago. Sure enough, MySQL threw a syntax error right away. WTF?

If you tell me that I should be talking to MySQL from the command line
I'm going to jump out the window forthwith. ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> Or like the time (very recently) when I was converting timestamps to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> calculate the number of days between two given dates. I used the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number_format() function...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Uh, just making sure...  Did you convert the timestamps via 
</I>&gt;<i> number_format() then do the math?  Ouch.  This is the kind of stuff the 
</I>&gt;<i> date functions, like date_diff(), etc, in MySQL and PHP are for.  
</I>&gt;<i> Faster, more accurate, easier.  Then format the result.
</I>
Actually, my description wasn't very accurate. I guess I sort of did it
in the middle--after the math to calculate the number of days between
&quot;today&quot; and the expiration date, but before telling PHP to check for a
specific number days See below). Where you now see round() is where I
was previously using number_format():

$todays_date = date(&quot;Y-m-d&quot;);
$today = strtotime($todays_date);
$exp_date = strtotime($exp_date);
$diff = ($exp_date - $today);
$num_days = ($diff / 86400);
$num_days = round($num_days, 0);
$exp_date = date('m-d-y', $exp_date);
if ($num_days &lt;= 60 &amp;&amp; $num_days &gt;= 46) {
	$exp_date = '&lt;span class=&quot;exp60Days&quot;&gt;'.$exp_date.'&lt;/span&gt;
} //...and so on

In MySQL the exp_date field data type is DATE. I strongly suspect that
I'm handling my dates in the most verbose &amp; confusing way possible, and
I know for a fact that I didn't properly normalize my tables. IOW, I
managed to make things work, but it's a big mess.

I'm currently trying to redo everything, but with limited success as
trying to grope my way through the fog of my inexperience results in
frequent rounds of tripping &amp; falling face-first into the mud. I
eventually figure stuff out and inch my way up a little, but it's a
slow, painful climb.

Sometimes I sort of feel like Sisyphus. *sigh*

I'm going to go check out the date_diff() function...
