Bev:

I know what you mean. For me, clients basically fall into two groups: 
a) Those who tell me what they want; b) And those who tell me how to 
do what they want. I work well with (a), but have problems with (b).

When it comes to teaching (I do teach at college level), there are 
very few students/clients who fully realize all that's involved in 
developing a web site. Many think, as I've been told &quot;It's easy -- my 
son learned HTML in high school&quot; while they are totally clueless. The 
most problematic students/clients are the ones who have some 
experience with HTML and think that's all there is.

Here's a couple of links that I often tell clients to review:

<A HREF="http://sperling.com/web-developer.php">http://sperling.com/web-developer.php</A>

<A HREF="http://sperling.com/four-things-clients-should-know.php">http://sperling.com/four-things-clients-should-know.php</A>

Furthermore, the number of actual web developers out there who do 
know how to program in all the web languages (i.e., namely html, css, 
javascript, php, mysql, et al) to create a truly functional web site, 
are very few.

And lastly, none of this is static. I spend time every day learning 
something new -- the web is constantly changing and keeping up with 
it is a daily challenge. I was quoted a long time ago as saying:

&quot;I've learned something new every day of my life -- and I'm getting 
damned tried of it.&quot;

And that hasn't changed much.

Cheers,

tedd
