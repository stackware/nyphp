Hi Kristina,

LOL, yep, that type of revision control is definitely the easiest to
install! I've actually been using that method for years with HTML files,
but I'm finding it to be a PITA when working with PHP.

One reason is that when I have a lot of files with similar names it's
far too easy to select &amp; edit the wrong one (even though I keep a
/_trash dir in an attempt to manage the older stuff).

Another reason is that if I haven't been working on a project for a few
days, it's hard to remember what I was doing with a particular version
of a file unless I also add some sort of description to its name. So I
end up with things like customer_edit_dd_filter_2009-08-26.php and
customer_edit_table_sort_2009-08-26.php. Ugh.

Last but not least, because of my inexperience, it's rare for me to only
have one version of a file on a given day. So even without the
descriptions added to the file names, I'd still end up with things like
customer_edit_2009-08-26.php, customer_edit_2009-08-26_2.php,
customer_edit_2009-08-26_3.php, and so on. It gets REALLY confusing.

Luckily, I make weekly backups to an external drive, so I've never made
a mess that I couldn't recover from, but still...I've wasted a LOT of
time trying to figure out where I was and get a file back to a usable
state, you know? I think it's definitely time for me to buckle down move
on to some sort of VCS--I figure however steep the learning curve might
be, it can't be worse than the amount of time I've already lost on
manual recoveries.

&gt;<i> And in terms of tracking &quot;to do&quot; items, I just keep a text file in each 
</I>&gt;<i> active project in which I keep detailed notes and to do punchlists and 
</I>&gt;<i> etc.  
</I>
Thanks, that's a good idea. I tend to make my lists on paper, sticky
notes, or a whiteboard. (I especially enjoy ripping sticky notes off my
monitor and tossing them in the trash when something's finally done
*grin*) But now that you mention it, it would probably be better to have
an electronic file so I can go back &amp; review steps I took on any given
project to see what I did and how/if I might improve things.

&gt;<i> I lack patience for stuff that is needlessly complex as I've always 
</I>&gt;<i> been a &quot;brute force by text editor&quot; type of programmer.  I just try to 
</I>&gt;<i> follow the &quot;KISS&quot; method, and avoid as many hazards as possible.  And I 
</I>&gt;<i> would certainly hesitate to hold myself out as a &quot;productivity guru&quot; -- 
</I>&gt;<i> I tend to work in fits and starts and be insanely productive some days, 
</I>&gt;<i> and then other days it just isn't really working for me so much...
</I>
I prefer simplicity too, but I freak out when my files start getting
messy because I have a hard enough time keeping my thoughts organized
when working with PHP &amp; MySQL. I wish I could keep my apartment as
orderly as my files... ;o)

&gt;<i> Love Ajai's suggestion for XDebug but fear the installation 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation may be my undoing! :)
</I>
Same here! Thanks again for your help.

Bev
