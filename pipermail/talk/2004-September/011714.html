Yes, Mr. Krook suggested the same thing. Thank you, too for the
suggestion.  :)  I'm going to look into these services.

At the risk of being slightly off-topic, is there any reason why I
would choose one (No-IP.com, for instance) over another (say DynDNS?).
Both of these companies are doing the same exact thing, right? I'm
assuming the niceness of their techs and their level of helpful
customer support will be the main differences between these services.
Any good existing reviews of these services on the Web would also be
helpful (though I plan to google that anyway).

Ah, that's another idea. But for that, I would need to have a server
on the Internet to begin with.

</I>&gt;<i> key starts with ssh-dss and the user is the same as you will connect
</I>&gt;<i> with) authorized_keys will also need the contents of your identity.pub.
</I>&gt;<i> This just make shell scripts act like they are working on your local

Thanks for these resources. I don't expect (no pun intended) that I'll
need to do anything like this for my rather simplistic purposes (all I
want to do is get access to the remote machine despite it's IP address
changing all the time) but they are nevertheless getting bookmarked.

Best regards,
