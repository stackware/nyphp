If anyone has some information, which they feel will 
be of general interest or help to the PHP community, 
and they feel it should be published (and here I 
mean in addition to being published in the 
mail list archives), New York PHP has some 
established procedures for accomplishing this.

If the information covers so much ground 
that it would require a whole new section 
on the website, then it would be a project. 

You should then follow the guidelines for 
submitting a project at: 
 <A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/nyphp/index.php?slide=10">http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/nyphp/index.php?slide=10</A> 

If the information is more along the lines of 
a best practice for coding or otherwise using 
PHP (e.g. how to best set PHP ini directives), 
it is more likely to be a candidate for a 
PHundamental article.
(see: <A HREF="http://education.nyphp.org/phundamentals/">http://education.nyphp.org/phundamentals/</A> ) 

Article ideas, which are candidates for a 'PHundamental',  
can be submitted to Jeff Siegel (<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">jeff.siegel at nyphp.org</A>) 
or Michael Southwell (<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">michael.southwell at nyphp.org</A>). 

Other information, which serves as a useful 
'backgrounder', would probably be best published  
as an AMPere.
(see: <A HREF="http://education.nyphp.org/ampeers/">http://education.nyphp.org/ampeers/</A> ) 

You can get in touch with Jasper Lin (<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">jasper.lin at nyphp.org</A>), 
who is the AMPeers Project Manager. 

Actually all these ways to get something published 
are described on the website -- but I thought it 
might be handy to summarize them here. 

One more important thing about contributing to 
New York PHP is that you don't have to be a 
'ninja master' or a '6th degree black belt' in PHP 
to be able to contribute. 

I wish this fact were more widely known among associate 
members -- I sometimes get the feeling that many 
people are reluctant to offer to help, because 
they feel they haven't yet mastered PHP.

This is too bad because the fastest way to 
learn something is to work with other people 
who can give you a few 'pointers' -- not slug 
it out by yourself.
