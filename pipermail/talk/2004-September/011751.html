<PRE>
&gt;<i> Instead, I'm wondering if it's possible for PHP to monitor my
</I>&gt;<i> computer's IP address, or more accurately, my local network's WAN IP
</I>&gt;<i> address, so that it can alert me when the address changes via a DHCP
</I>&gt;<i> offer(). Here's the situation:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a computer at my parent's house constantly running and
</I>&gt;<i> connected to the Internet via a Road Runner account. I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> connect to it remotely sometimes. The problem is, as you know, Road
</I>&gt;<i> Runner uses DHCP to designate their subscriber modem's IP addresses,
</I>&gt;<i> and this means it changes all the time. I'm savvy enough to configure
</I>&gt;<i> an SSH server on the machine locally and configure the router over
</I>&gt;<i> there to let requests from the Internet through, but I obviously can't
</I>&gt;<i> figure out where that computer is unless I call my parents and direct
</I>&gt;<i> her to whatismyip.com.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the question is, does PHP have any capability to discover and
</I>&gt;<i> monitor a network's WAN IP address?
</I>
Yes and no.  I'm not aware of an extension that ties directly into the
kernel system calls, but depending on your system, it'd be trivial to
parse /proc info, ifconfig output, etc.  Possibly helpful of course
would be these functions:

<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/front-end">http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/front-end</A>

There are likely PEAR classes and other open source projects that do
much of this parsing, and there are probably even extensions that take
it to the C level (the right way to do it).  I had worked on a C
extension to sculpt raw packets, but it's since stalled any development.

&gt;<i> I'd imagine that the solution would be a PHP-CLI script invoked with
</I>&gt;<i> cron or a similar utility which would then email me the current
</I>&gt;<i> address. (I suppose Windows has the Task Scheduler for this, and I
</I>&gt;<i> guess this would also require setting up some kind of mail server, or
</I>&gt;<i> else use something like <A HREF="http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/">http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/</A> suggested by
</I>&gt;<i> Dan, earlier. (I'm also sorry for not promptly thanking you for that
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion, Dan. I really appreciated the pointer!)). But most
</I>&gt;<i> importantly for right now, I'm not sure this is the best way to go
</I>&gt;<i> about it in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone offer some good points why I shouldn't attempt this
</I>&gt;<i> project? I'd be grateful if you save me some time.  :)  Thanks in
</I>&gt;<i> advance.
</I>
I think this approache would work, and some other tools - cacti comes to
mind - might be useful here, too.
