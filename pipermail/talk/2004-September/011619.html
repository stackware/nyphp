  Subject: [nycphp-talk] Business development site, join as my guest


  Hello everyone:

  I have been using this list as a resource as I put together a membership
organization web site.  Thanks for the assistance.  The discussions really
came in handy on a number of ocassions as I tried to &quot;get my mind right.&quot;

  I'm a business guy and not much of a programmer, so I'm a bit reluctant to
call it to the attention of the skilled artisans on this list. On the other
hand, the subject matter of the organization may be of interest to you.

  The site is for ATIDO: The Alliance of Technology and International
Development Organizations.  The mission of ATIDO is to facilitate business
development and partnering for tech companies as they expand beyond their
local markets and across borders.  If you are looking for business across
the country or overseas, ATIDO was conceived to help you find it.  And to
help it find you.

  ATIDO will launch slowly between now and the end of the year.  The
membership is made up of companies rather than of individuals, but if any
members of this list wish to register their companies they may do so by
using the PROMOTION CODE: NYP0104 .  Simply go to the site www.atido.org and
click the &quot;join&quot; link.  Or, if you have one, ask your director of business
development to register.

  Of course, I also welcome comments, criticism and suggestions.  I'm
interested in thoughts about the business proposition as well as of the
rather basic use of PHP.

  Cheers,

  Bill
