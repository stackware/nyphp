</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First off, thanks for setting this strait.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What you say makes a whole lot more sense to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me than that news story.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This should be a grim reminder to EVERYONE just how easily the media
</I>&gt;<i> can be manipulated.  C|Net's original story basically presented
</I>&gt;<i> Brian's claims as fact, and never even attempted to contact Miro or
</I>&gt;<i> Mambo to see the other side of the issue - and in fact, presented
</I>&gt;<i> Brian's claims without even asking for any kind of verification
</I>&gt;<i> whatsoever.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If he was distributing a 'derived work' based on code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whose copyright is held by Miro and published under GPL,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then he is obligated to give his changes or mods to Miro --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if indeed the Mambo copyright holder wants them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This fact that he was publishing his changes seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to me to be diametrically opposed to what this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guy was claiming (again as nearly as I could make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out from the news article) -- that the code was stolen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from his unpublished work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, Brian does what is in Brian's interest, and that is it.  He
</I>&gt;<i> took Mambo and some third party products, stripped all of the credits
</I>&gt;<i> and copyright notices, and rebranded it as his own.  So not only did
</I>&gt;<i> he distribute his stuff as GPL, he was in violation by removing the
</I>&gt;<i> credits and copyrights to boot!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is even worse that he is threatening to take action
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; against the end users of Mambo (as you mentioned in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your post).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If this guy gets away with this (wins any sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legal judgement), it could definitely put a scare
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into prospective clients, who you might be trying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to persuade to use open source code -- Mambo or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no legal threat from Brian, as he knows he has no evidence to
</I>&gt;<i> back up his claims.  Just look at his forum posts at mamboserver.com's
</I>&gt;<i> community forums (he was 'literati' at the time) and you will see that
</I>&gt;<i> when we called his bluff, resorted immediately to his smear campaign
</I>&gt;<i> and intimidation tactics with end users - and note, that he knows he
</I>&gt;<i> has no legal grounds to threaten anybody, he is REALLY doing this to
</I>&gt;<i> stop adoption of Mambo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And as we are a volunteer-led effort with no funding, there is little
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity for us to go after him in court - with what resources? 
</I>&gt;<i> Hence the creation of the defense fund (hint, hint).
</I>&gt;<i>
