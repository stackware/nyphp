&quot;
	Those are the words that Rasmus Lerdorf, the creator of PHP,
	said to kick off his keynote at the php|works conference under
	way here.
	...
	&quot;The Web is pretty much broken, we can all go home now,&quot;
	Lerdorf said somewhat sarcastically to the capacity crowd.
	&quot;Luckily most people don't realize that it's broken.&quot;
	
	Part of the reason Lerdorf considers the Web &quot;broken&quot; is that
	it is inherently insecure for a variety of reasons. One of those
	reasons sits at the feet of developers.

	&quot;You don't know that you have to filter user input,&quot; Lerdorf
	exclaimed.
&quot;

Everybody is preaching security (gurus on this list included).  So, why
hasn't it caught fire?  Here's my quick-list..

1. it is easy to ignore it and the app still works in your test
	environment.. and you didn't waste valuable time auditting!
	(tongue in cheek)  &quot;Despite your Herculean timetable,  Mr.
	Client, the app is ready.  Now I'm going to have to bill you
	extra hours to do a security audit and documentation.&quot; 
	&quot;umm.. no thanks, Mr. Developer.  I don't have the budget for
	your bill padding&quot;.

2. php is easy to use and popular; low adoption barriers.
	a. newbies haven't been burned yet or don't know best practices
	b. popularity brings the dark side for low hanging fruit
	c. terms like 'x-site scripting' and 'db injection' are
		confusing buzzwords to the newly introduced and (despite
		efforts) are not defined well enough; besides,
		buzzwords get ignored anyway. 
	d. &quot;eewww.. that can/will not happen to me&quot;

3. it isn't preached enough
