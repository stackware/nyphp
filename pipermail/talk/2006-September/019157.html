I see. I guess that works well, if it's okay to fetch all the data 
from database and display only some of it. I'd be a little afraid 
that in large scale that puts quite some unnecessary extra work for 
the both database server and the PHP engine.

&gt;<i> date. I don't so how you go about that type of flexibility without a

</I>&gt;<i> straight style sheets to get your output going?
</I>
If you have user account info and you just want to display it, you 
should first think what kind of semantic structure does this data 
have? If you have a list of users each of which have multiple 
fields, then it sounds to me that your logical structure is a table.

So logically it's like this:

UID	Name	Foobar
1	John	&quot;apple&quot;
12	Mary	7

Semantic markup for this would look like

&lt;table class=&quot;$class&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;UID&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Foobar&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;John&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;apple&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mary&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The only thing you need to change for different rendering of the 
above data is to set $class variable to another value. I don't 
understand how many different ways there could be to encode that 
same information in XHTML. Therefore, I don't understand the need 
for templating engine to generate/modify that part of the source. To 
me, the only question is what solution has the best performance? A 
template engine is seldom the correct answer.

Then you just write CSS file that specifies the rendering. It could 
be pretty much anything, except that with MSIE6/win32 you cannot 
say, for example, stuff like

table.special { display: block; }

because MSIE6/win32 will always behave as if an element called 
&quot;table&quot; had hardcoded CSS property &quot;display: table&quot;.

That's where the problems start. That's the reason you might want to 
use a template engine. If you're not happy with the hardcoded 
rendering the MSIE6/win32 has for your markup you have to *change 
your semantic markup* to match the intended rendering instead of 
intended meaning! Another reason could be that your layout guys 
don't understand CSS and use HTML for layout instead.

I believe that to change the semantics of your data (the HTML 
markup) you *have* to modify the code/logic also. I don't see the 
advantage of separating those.
