Personally, I'm of the opinion that right now people tend to focus too
much on input filtering, and not enough on safe storage and display
practices.

If you are correctly handling incoming data, it makes little difference
what that data may be.  For example, if you construct a query like:

$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE myid='$someid'&quot;;

You are obviously vulnerable to assorted SQL injection attacks.

However, construct the query like:

$query = 'SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE myid='.
mysql_real_escape_string($someid);

or:

$query = 'SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE myid=?';
$args = array(
    $someid,
);

And you have prevented the attack, regardless of the contents of
$someid.  This is because you are correctly formatting the data in
context, in this case as an SQL string.

The same goes for displaying data on a webpage, pass it through
htmlspecialchars and you'll be guaranteed that it is correctly formatted
as a block of HTML CDATA.

The security breach comes from treating the data incorrectly, not from
its contents.

That said, if you need to display html received from the client as html,
you need input filtering to separate the bad from the good.  However,
these cases are not the norm, and in many situations input filtering is
merely restricting the data you're allowing clients to input, without
any real security gains.

If you need to enforce certain restrictions on user input, according to
the 'rules' of the system then input filtering is a great idea, but
don't get caught up in thinking that filtering input is the answer to
all security problems.
