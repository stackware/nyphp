<PRE>Whether one examines fairly generic concepts like Joomla, phpNuke,
dotProject or TYPO3. Or one looks at the generic frameworks. 
Or one looks at the sourceforge.net collection of tools and projects. It
might be proper to observe that there is 
quite sufficient baseline &quot;generic&quot; PHP product out there. 

And that these worldwide, many years long collective collaborations were
likely originally engendered predominantly to propel 
PHP development from 0 - 60, causing PHP to rapidly appear as a competitive,
diverse, solutions-oriented code framework when 
compared to JAVA and ASP. 

Maybe these PHP projects have achieved what was originally needed to
basically propel PHP to an IT takes note status. 

Now it may be time for new talents to focus on the next evolutionary
competitive step and that would be to tie together, maximize, enhance and
compound all these &quot;generic&quot; projects and spin them into very rich, full
package commercial enterprise-wide solutions with a bit more out of the box
readiness to meet the expectations of known market segments that need and
buy full scale (verily even expensive and satisfyingly profitable) web
application solutions.

Might there not be a business case that shows the there is sufficient
competitive cause now -- that PHP developers need -- more access to free or
low-cost well done projects that really answer contemporary commercial
business needs. 

No collective of developers needs to hold back anymore and think: &quot;Well, if
we want to create a successful project that is going to get used a lot, we
need to make this non-specific grey box set of features and functions for a
hypothetical vast generic market of scientifically precise programmers to
use.&quot; To the contrary, the collective of developers should now be thinking:
&quot;What are some of the present day ripe business categories that have
exploded onto the internet and PHP developers could use targeted, base code
projects that meet the needs of an ever expanding, feature hungry mass of
potential PHP customers who are right now paying way too much to other
programmer/code languages.&quot; 

New PHP projects really need to cohesively, convincingly and accurately do
modern expected things that most customers are now desiring as a matter of
course, such as: streaming media, perform bulk emails, collect and create
RSS, encrypt cookies/session, registration/login/preferences, meeting
calendar, customer inquiries center, FAQ, online chat/IM, help desk/trouble
ticket, mapping, weather, and even interface with bar codes. 

PHP could use to take and grow market share in all the following business
segments:

Chamber of Commerce 
Convention Center 
Visitor's Bureau 
Supermarkets 
Television Station 
Automobile Dealership 
Yacht Dealership 
Cruise Line 
Venture Capital Firm 
Museum 
Resort / Resort Chain 
Hotel / Hotel Chain 
Movie Theatre Chain 
Performing Arts Center 
Dance Troupe 
Theatre Ensemble 
Circus 
National Park 
Day School Site 
Grade School / High School Site 
Real Estate Agency 
Real Estate Residential Developer 
Real Estate Commercial Developer 
Accounting Firm 
Law Firm 
Politician 
Political Group 
Fundraiser 
Trucking Firm 
Tanker Firm 
Police Department 
Fire Department 
Art Gallery Chain 

Even bigger and more ambitious: 
News Site with multimedia 
Weather Service 
Traffic Site 
Media Download Site 
Software Download Site 
Photo Sharing Site 
Train Scheduler 
Web Cam Viewer Site 
Expedition Chronicler 
Digital Movie Download Site

If I am off base and you know a full featured opensource project that fills
the gap in the above business segments, just list them and everyone will be
helped by what might otherwise be interpreted as shameless PHP project
publicity.

Much as I appreciate the plug, Savant is more a template/presentation- 
logic system than a framework.

And IIRC, Cortex is officially defunct; Davey gave it up in favor of  
Zend Framework. Via Google Cache:
