<PRE>I have dealt with this issue before of having infinite levels and branches
within a hierarchy. To extend Peter's note, follow his table structure,
however for the Available_Categories table you need to store a parent_id to
know where in the hierarchy your item fits. So you would have:

&quot;Available_Categories&quot; table fields:
ID
Parent_id
Category_Name

For example you have (1)IT-&gt;(7)Software-&gt;(20)Programming-&gt;(40)PHP programmer
with the corresponding id next to them in parenthesis.

Your table available categories would contain

id   parent_id    category_name
1       NULL         IT
7        1          Software
20       7           Programming
40       20          PHP programmer

This is one alternative to this solution, but if you need to display the
entire branch of all the parents of PHP programmer you would have to do 3
sql queries to get them all. You can see how processing for this quickly
gets out of control if you go many levels deep.

My recommendation is to follow the Modified Preorder Tree Traversal
solution. Read up on it here,
<A HREF="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database/2.">http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database/2.</A> Notice that
the parent_id field has been replaced with the left_id and right_id fields.
This will allow you go get all the parents of a node with just 1 sql query.

Much as I appreciate the plug, Savant is more a template/presentation-

And IIRC, Cortex is officially defunct; Davey gave it up in favor of

In my experience, storing/passing all variables via server-side sessions 
with a mysql based session handler simplifies many things.

I'm admittedly not so well-versed on security issues, but why not hash the
CC# (with crypt() or something similar) and store it in sql temporarily? You
could store the corresponding sql key id in the session.

Whether one examines fairly generic concepts like Joomla, phpNuke,
dotProject or TYPO3. Or one looks at the generic frameworks. 
Or one looks at the sourceforge.net collection of tools and projects. It
might be proper to observe that there is 
quite sufficient baseline &quot;generic&quot; PHP product out there. 

And that these worldwide, many years long collective collaborations were
likely originally engendered predominantly to propel 
PHP development from 0 - 60, causing PHP to rapidly appear as a competitive,
diverse, solutions-oriented code framework when 
compared to JAVA and ASP. 

Maybe these PHP projects have achieved what was originally needed to
basically propel PHP to an IT takes note status. 

Now it may be time for new talents to focus on the next evolutionary
competitive step and that would be to tie together, maximize, enhance and
compound all these &quot;generic&quot; projects and spin them into very rich, full
package commercial enterprise-wide solutions with a bit more out of the box
readiness to meet the expectations of known market segments that need and
buy full scale (verily even expensive and satisfyingly profitable) web
application solutions.

Might there not be a business case that shows the there is sufficient
competitive cause now -- that PHP developers need -- more access to free or
low-cost well done projects that really answer contemporary commercial
business needs. 

No collective of developers needs to hold back anymore and think: &quot;Well, if
we want to create a successful project that is going to get used a lot, we
need to make this non-specific grey box set of features and functions for a
hypothetical vast generic market of scientifically precise programmers to
use.&quot; To the contrary, the collective of developers should now be thinking:
&quot;What are some of the present day ripe business categories that have
exploded onto the internet and PHP developers could use targeted, base code
projects that meet the needs of an ever expanding, feature hungry mass of
potential PHP customers who are right now paying way too much to other
programmer/code languages.&quot; 

New PHP projects really need to cohesively, convincingly and accurately do
modern expected things that most customers are now desiring as a matter of
course, such as: streaming media, perform bulk emails, collect and create
RSS, encrypt cookies/session, registration/login/preferences, meeting
calendar, customer inquiries center, FAQ, online chat/IM, help desk/trouble
ticket, mapping, weather, and even interface with bar codes. 

PHP could use to take and grow market share in all the following business
segments:

Chamber of Commerce 
Convention Center 
Visitor's Bureau 
Supermarkets 
Television Station 
Automobile Dealership 
Yacht Dealership 
Cruise Line 
Venture Capital Firm 
Museum 
Resort / Resort Chain 
Hotel / Hotel Chain 
Movie Theatre Chain 
Performing Arts Center 
Dance Troupe 
Theatre Ensemble 
Circus 
National Park 
Day School Site 
Grade School / High School Site 
Real Estate Agency 
Real Estate Residential Developer 
Real Estate Commercial Developer 
Accounting Firm 
Law Firm 
Politician 
Political Group 
Fundraiser 
Trucking Firm 
Tanker Firm 
Police Department 
Fire Department 
Art Gallery Chain 

Even bigger and more ambitious: 
News Site with multimedia 
Weather Service 
Traffic Site 
Media Download Site 
Software Download Site 
Photo Sharing Site 
Train Scheduler 
Web Cam Viewer Site 
Expedition Chronicler 
Digital Movie Download Site

If I am off base and you know a full featured opensource project that fills
the gap in the above business segments, just list them and everyone will be
helped by what might otherwise be interpreted as shameless PHP project
publicity.

Much as I appreciate the plug, Savant is more a template/presentation- 
logic system than a framework.

And IIRC, Cortex is officially defunct; Davey gave it up in favor of  
Zend Framework. Via Google Cache:

Following an absence from work due a long term illness, I have just 
completed the CIW Master Designer qualification to assist me in my to 
return to work.  
 
To facilitate my return, it is apparent that I need to learn PHP and 
demonstrate its use with and without MySQL.
 
Could you suggest examples that I should write and use as part of my 
portfolio.
 
I am not looking for detailed descriptions, just brief outlines of 
projects that will demonstrate the skills being considered for PHP
employment at this time.  
 
I have some experience of using PHP5 and PHP4 with MySQL, and a lot more 
experience in C++, so I am not coming at it as a complete programming 
novice.

Thanks.

Neil,

I happen to be struggling now with a database issue that might interest you
and
I'd welcome and appreciate suggestions from the group.

My issue is: With a relational database how do you represent and navigate a
tree with unlimited number of levels and branches ? Example: categorization
hierarchy. Let's say you have a table of Employees. Now you want to
categorize
them by Job_Type: clerk, secretary, manager, etc. But each one of these can
be
further sub-categorized, e.g. Manager: production, purchasing, accounting
etc.
Each one of those can also be sub-categorized in an unlimited recursive
fashion. 

One could try constructing a table with columns: level_0 level_1 level_2
etc.
where level_0 holds the 0-th level categories, level_1 - first level
subcategories, etc. But what if the number of category levels is potentially
unlimited - what do you do then?

Seems like this must have been dealt with before somewhere, and any
suggestions
and pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Leo Kokin

You should further study the topic: 'database normalization' to get more
grasp of 
how to handle table relationships as the industry has generally settled on. 

The following type of three table structure should offer solution to your
issue. 
Roughly creating as follows should get you started. 

&quot;Employee&quot; table fields:
ID 
Employee_ID
First_Name 
Last_Name
Address

&quot;Employee_Attrributes&quot; table fields:
ID 
Employee_ID 
Category_ID

&quot;Available_Categories&quot; table fields:
ID
Category_Name


&quot;Employee&quot; table and &quot;Employee_Attributes&quot; tables have an infinitely
expandable, one to many, primary key to foreign key relationship.

Save a new row entry into &quot;Employee_Attributes&quot; table every time an Employee
is added to a new category. 
Then perform multi-table SELECT queries using JOIN, LEFT JOIN, or RIGHT JOIN
when you need to get the Employee category info.

That should tide you over.
