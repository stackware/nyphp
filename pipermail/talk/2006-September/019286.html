I have a question on how others are handling their 3rd party frameworks
... Specifically the ones under some type of version control (and when
your code itself is under version control).  There was a recent security
fix for CakePHP and an ~svn up~ provided the quickest way to get to the
fix*.  

The problem w/ this is that there are potentials for breakage under your
unit tests (or just your code if you don't do test cases).  If you have
a lot of code between the revisions of your last framework update it can
be cumbersome to check everything.  

Would tagging your code based on major framework updates (1.x.x.x) be
the best solution in case something goes awry?

Im also thinking of symlinking across the framework versions as another
alternative ... Just wondering how others might be handling it ...

*On a side note Ive heard of mixed effects of using svn:externals
(albeit an svn upgrade, etc) and still not sure if it is the best
option.

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] Cake v. Symfony [CodeIgniter?]

Sorry for this incredibly short answer, but I'm a tad rushed... (  so no
reasoning either =(  )

We use Symfony at my company.  Large scale, high traffic.  It's a bit
buggy, a lot bloated, and the slowest thing I've seen in some time.  I
don't recommend porting over to it.  Sorry :\  One really big reason for
this is their use of ORMs.  If you just avoided Propel or their soon to
be Doctrine (maybe?) implementation, Symfony would probably go quite a
bit faster.

Also note that they are still not at 1.0, and their API changes and they
aren't even expected to maintain much backward compat. at this point.  
Adopting it in a critical environment is probably not a good idea, at
least not until they hit 1.0 and start making promises about maintaining
as much BC as possible, etc..

On a positive note, their code is incredibly clean, documented, and
elegant.

HTH,

Rick
