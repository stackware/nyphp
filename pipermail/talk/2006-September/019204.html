</I>Yes this may be very true, but there are an awful lot of Joomla! sites 
out there, aren't there? Somebody is using it. Oh, and Wordpress has 
become the tool of choice for many &quot;news&quot; sites. Go figure.

People DO pick frameworks and commit to them. Of course these are not 
traditional 'software projects' but web projects.

Now, tomorrow when the VIEW of DATA  has succeeded , and someone 
recognizes there is additonal value in the community, the archives, and 
the efficiencies that can be captured through customization, I agree 
they will either be told (by good consultants) or will discover 
themselves that a framework is only as good as it's ability to be 
utlized in a customized configuration. At that point they will also 
hopefully have the cash and willingness to spend it on development.


It may just be that a frameworks with Parts A-Z is &quot;good enough&quot; to get 
started without having to (re)define all those specs in the first go.
