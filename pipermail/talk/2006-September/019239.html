<PRE>Hi!

You really forgot one thing on the list: developer laziness. I work with 
quite a few developers who are all smart people and who know how to secure 
input correctly. The problem is that  adding the code takes extra time and 
is annoying as it doesn't really do much. And besides that, in a 
professional setting support is the one to pick up the pieces afterwards 
(that would be me). Since I got burned once by unscreened input that was 
piped straight into an SQL query I make extra effort to test for this (I do 
software QA as well).
The private coder who wants to spice up the self hosted webpages with some 
scripts is unexperienced and maybe negligent. What freaks me outis when I 
can simply dismantle a page for a for profit business by entering &quot;O'Neill&quot; 
into some text box.
Since my first few steps with SQL I am aware of the injection problem. I'm 
still awfully uneducated on this crossite scripting problem. I know that it 
exists, but I have no idea what to do about it....again, developer laziness.
