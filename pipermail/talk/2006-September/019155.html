I have to say that there are other advantages of using a template 
system. I mean do you really want to hand type every &lt;select 
name=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;option&gt;...?

I also make sure any data passed into the template system is escaped on 
output. This helps prevent some nasty little surprises from time to time.

Personally, I like the template system approach. I have builders that 
perform my logic. They use my objects to fetch the list of user accounts 
from the database, for instance. Then I assign that list to the template 
system. The data is now available for output. I can then create numerous 
templates that use that same data for various types of output. One 
builder might power 5 different template views and I only have to update 
that one builder if some logic changes and all 5 templates are up to 
date. I don't so how you go about that type of flexibility without a 
template system of some sort. Care to share some info on how you use 
straight style sheets to get your output going?
