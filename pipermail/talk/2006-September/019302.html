<PRE>David:

Great comments -- including the one about commenting.
Documentation...can that be outsourced?!

Interesting comment regarding emails. So where does Craigslist fit in?
As I see it, HTML emails are a real pain and can be a real bandwidth
hog, but I think the world expects them. Geez, my kids probably expect
the email to have music and video.

At 04:17 PM 9/19/2006, you wrote:
 &gt; Supports multi-part emails (both text and html in the same message).

I know I'm not much help here, but HTML is for websites. Emails ought to
be 
plain text!
I don't see anything conceptually wrong with what you do. Performance is

something that you will need to test out and then decide if it is OK for

what you need to do. The number of includes can be reduced by
consolidating 
similar includes into one and by evaluating how likely an included file 
will need to be changed. If it is pretty much static and appears in only

one or two locations, there isn't much gained with including the code 
through an external file.

If you plan on using a database anyway, it might be a good time to 
implement this now. I used to shy away from databases as I didn't know 
anything about SQL (sounded scary). I found that I can do much more
things 
using database tables and thus change my approach on how to get things 
going. Especially when it comes to sorting stuff by more than one field.
A 
temporary table is so easy to make and gives you all the SQL power.

The only other comment I have is this one: add more comments. In three 
months nobody including yourself has a clue why things are the way they
are 
and why they work only 3 times out of 5. Been there, done that, and it 
isn't really funny...unless you do it professionally, then you can tell 
your boss how complicated this all is and that you need so much extra
time. 
If he puts someone else on the job they will really need a lot of time
to 
figure it out. ;)
