&gt;<i> 	Part of the reason Lerdorf considers the Web &quot;broken&quot; is that
</I>&gt;<i> 	it is inherently insecure for a variety of reasons. One of those
</I>&gt;<i> 	reasons sits at the feet of developers.
</I>
Pardon my bluntness, but if we follow that reasoning then the entire
internet is hopelessly broken and insecure.  If email wasn't broken and
insecure, we wouldn't have spam.

While I agree with Rasmus that it's the responsibility of developers to
ensure they write good code - one facet of which is being security concsious
- this isn't an epiphany by any means.  Everything in the history of
computers have been plaguaed by these issues.  PHP is no different.

&gt;<i> Everybody is preaching security (gurus on this list included).  So,
</I>&gt;<i> why hasn't it caught fire?  Here's my quick-list..
</I>
I think it has.  Public perception is different from what's going on in
large deployments, which too is changing.  Judging the quality of a language
and it's developers on certain popular pieces of PHP software, isn't viewing
the whole picture.

&gt;<i> 1. it is easy to ignore it and the app still works in your test
</I>&gt;<i> 	environment.. and you didn't waste valuable time auditting!
</I>&gt;<i> 	(tongue in cheek)  &quot;Despite your Herculean timetable,  Mr.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Client, the app is ready.  Now I'm going to have to bill you
</I>&gt;<i> 	extra hours to do a security audit and documentation.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 	&quot;umm.. no thanks, Mr. Developer.  I don't have the budget for
</I>&gt;<i> 	your bill padding&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. php is easy to use and popular; low adoption barriers.
</I>&gt;<i> 	a. newbies haven't been burned yet or don't know best practices
</I>&gt;<i> 	b. popularity brings the dark side for low hanging fruit
</I>&gt;<i> 	c. terms like 'x-site scripting' and 'db injection' are
</I>&gt;<i> 		confusing buzzwords to the newly introduced and (despite
</I>&gt;<i> 		efforts) are not defined well enough; besides,
</I>&gt;<i> 		buzzwords get ignored anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 	d. &quot;eewww.. that can/will not happen to me&quot;
</I>
Number 2 is the real issue in my opinion.  The biggest problem is the low
adoption barriers.  When I've seen PHP code from developers that know
another language, it's generally good - just like code in any other language
from a good developer - it's good.

PHP also unfortunately suffers from the Microsoft effect - writing an
exploit that would affect millions of web sites/applications makes you a
much better script kiddie than writing one that only affects a dozen.

&gt;<i> 3. it isn't preached enough
</I>
I don't think that's the problem :)
