</I>Did you do what Jake proposed on the 17th? It would be nice to know if you 
want to understand what PHP &amp; MySQL are doing and how the code works, or if 
you just need some piece of software that works. If it is the latter, use 
Google. If you want to know how things work, you better start reading a bit 
and ask more specific questions. Especially, what you want to do with MySQL. 
Honestly, a database table is IMHO the worst place to store an entire image. I 
recommend storing a file path and before display making sure that the file 
still exists (see file_exists() in PHP manual).
I am currently working on a system that will do what you are asking for, but I 
am not done yet. I could give you my alpha code and a sample database, but 
that is it for now. I do not have any install scripts, I do not have any 
finished documentation, and I do not have the time to fill someone in and give 
support.

I did a two second search on Google and found this
<A HREF="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/php-photoalbum.htm">http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/php-photoalbum.htm</A>
That ought to do it.
Otherwise use this search URL
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=mysql+php+picture+viewer&amp;btnG=Google+Search">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=mysql+php+picture+viewer&amp;btnG=Google+Search</A>
and go through the first twenty hits. If you can't find anything that is easy 
enough, try Jeoren Wijering's Image Rotator at
<A HREF="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=JW_Image_Rotator">http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=JW_Image_Rotator</A>
That guy is awesome and I'd wish I had the money and influence to hire him 
into a company I work for. In regards to visuals I haven't seen anything 
better. He is always busy and while he does like to help people out, he just 
doesn't have the time to hold everyone's hand. So don't bother ask him a 
question like &quot;How do I install this?&quot;. Jeroen created some very basic, but 
sufficient documentation. Read it and spend some time trying things out. 
Install a web server (I recommend to the apachefriends.org 's XAMMP, read 
their documentation, too - again, a group of selfless young people who spend 
their spare time for the greater good) on your PC and try things out locally. 
Once you have a good understanding of what you want, what you don't want, and 
how the basics of PHP and MySQL work make a decision and either go with that, 
or come back here and ask questions other than &quot;give me working source code&quot;.

OK, that is way more information than your inquiry deserved, but today is 
Christmas, so what the heck.
