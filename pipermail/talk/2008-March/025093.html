<PRE>Hi there:

At the moment, I'm only speculating as to the cause of my problem, but  
I operate an online store, and we have a custom-built cart (which is  
complex, and so could therefore have issues in any number of places  
that I can't explain here), but we've got a new and problematic trend.

The trend is that some of our carts are ending up with information  
missing (inventories of items, specifically)...but the thing is, it  
seems to be happening only to Safari users.  This is a store that's  
been live for almost 4 years, and we've had our share of bugs here and  
there, but generally it's been functioning properly.  This is new, and  
I just am at this point thinking it has something to do with the  
proliferation of Safari 3.x, although I haven't definitively concluded  
this yet.

I should point out that I use OS X, and so Safari is often my primary  
test browser, and I can't actually replicate any of the problems users  
are reporting to us, but it seems that every one that is reporting a  
problem is a Safari user, so there's something fishy going on somewhere.

Is anyone aware of any subtle changes in Safari 3 that could cause  
problems with maintaining sessions or cookies?

Thanks for any insight.

Cheers,

Marc
