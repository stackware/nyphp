</I>Specially if there's any kind of time constrain. For example, I am 
building a small payroll application for a client. Unexpected (or 
overlooked) bugs = people don't get paid in time = epic fail.
If one can avoid having to deal with user's sensitive data (credit card, 
etc) by using a third-party service like paypal and avoid the possible 
nightmares, why not do it?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (For example, I decided to drop Zen Cart into a project once circa 
</I>&gt;<i> 2006 or so.  It's basically a steaming pile, as I discovered, but 
</I>&gt;<i> that's beside the point. 
</I>Good to know ;-)

&gt;<i> They had an authorize.net module, which it turned out after a ton of 
</I>&gt;<i> testing had a bug in it with respect to error reporting. This couldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> be ignored; I had to go into the module and fix it.  So, if you're 
</I>&gt;<i> using Drupal, and something in Drupal or some third-party module 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't work like it should, you need to be prepared to go in there 
</I>&gt;<i> and get your hands dirty if necessary.)
</I>Bingo. That's why CMSs can be more problematic than helpful, specially 
when dealing with clueless clients.

1. CMS vendors promise the world: innumerable &quot;cool&quot; features, &quot;ease of 
use&quot;, etc..
2. Client thinks: &quot;wow.. this web stuff is getting so easy. I can have 
my unbelievably complex website done in about a couple of days work!&quot;
3. Developers' work misunderstood and unappreciated.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, budget for testing.  Whatever time you think you'll spend 
</I>&gt;<i> building; add on another 200% for the back and forth, the testing, the 
</I>&gt;<i> unexpected client requests, etc. and so on.  If you can swing it, pay 
</I>&gt;<i> your most anal-retentive friend or perhaps a professional tester some 
</I>&gt;<i> money to test things for you; just like it's very hard to edit your 
</I>&gt;<i> own writing, it's often very difficult to spot bugs in a system you 
</I>&gt;<i> are building, because you naturally tend to fall into certain usage 
</I>&gt;<i> patterns that don't test everything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and remember to budget for testing.  Did I mention that?
</I>There was a recent episode of the Boagworld podcast where they go into 
detail with suggestions on how to run a testing session. Well worth a 
listen.
