Good catch; thanks!

Good points, all. I'd rather overestimate than underestimate.

&gt;<i> It really depends on how much your client has it together as well. Are

</I>&gt;<i> is the staff you are training to run the CMS? Surprisingly, even the 
</I>&gt;<i> simple admin interfaces generated by CMSs are enough to scare most folks.
</I>
So true. They were confused by the term &quot;web hosting&quot; so... ;-)

With that in mind, I think I may need to get a better handle on the 
client's expectations.

&gt;<i> Have a detailed, signed contract before you begin work. Oh, and please 
</I>&gt;<i> don't charge less than, say, $60/hr. It wouldn't be fair.
</I>
I never, ever worked without a contract when I was freelancing. 
Thankfully, now that I'm working for someone else I don't have to worry 
about that part, I just have to worry about getting the estimated time 
right. Thanks for the heads-up on the hourly rate though.

&gt;<i> Hope this helps,
</I>
It does indeed - thanks a million.
