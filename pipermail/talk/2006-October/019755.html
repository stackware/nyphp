Hi Paul,

Agreed; Java is threaded, from the ground up for the most part.

</I>&gt;<i> PHP.  That said,  RAM is getting cheaper,  and PHP is parsimonious in

</I>&gt;<i> instead of threads.
</I>
This I disagree with.  One of the primary reasons Java is built to be
threaded from the ground up is that it has to be.  I couldn't imagine having
a separate process instance of Java for every request - there isn't a server
on the planet with that much RAM - whereas PHP/Apache can happily live in
15-25mb of RAM or less.  Long story short, PHP is fair lighter than Java,
threads or no threads.

But there are certainly other advantages of threads, and I do hope that in
the near future core PHP configurations can begin to take advantage of them.
While creating threads in PHP isn't as important in my opinion for the
typical web application, being able to run in a thread-aware environment,
could be.

Unfortunately, this is a chicken and egg problem, since no one wants to put
the development time in until they see some justification... oh wait, I
covered this once already:
