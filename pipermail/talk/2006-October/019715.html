<PRE>Maybe the next big advance is not going to be in software, but in the pipe. 

A simple elegant cheaply manufactured ubiquitous massive wireless pipe 
(even faster, wider than fiber optic to the desktop) that will be always on 
the grid computing cloud network and handle anything. 

Simultaneously moving multiple DVD-quality streams, thousands of
personal/family bots, 
dozens of local desktop and/or network/internet applications blind to any
language or framework 
regardless of how bloated, intricate or overloaded with dependencies.

It is highly doubtful (and possibly not even desirable) that all the
disparate 
software standards, languages, applications, and techniques will be 100%
standardized 
and 100% interface abele. 

More likely I think in the future, more and more, entities like the
government, defense, 
banks, medical, brokers (likely, even wealthy individuals) will require --
absolutely must have -- 
their software written in a completely custom, highly-non-interfacing, 
enigmatic, highly-obscured language not in use anywhere else in the world.

I believe, in fact, that the US gov and defense already do write custom
software/apps 
with no known commercial equivilancy.

It is more likely that software will continue to branch and customize and
specialize moving 
more towards an infinite complexity handled by quantum and organic
processors allowing 
every person to get their own idiosyncratic signature language set of
instructions 
for their individual personal data storage and retreival all saved on a
single well-worn 
Life-ling multi-terabyte universal smart ID card that can maintain state
indefinately and 
only interfaces with the network when activated and plugged in or wiped.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the page-oriented Web.  Can anybody point me in that direction?

</I>
Very true. People use web just as a part of fulfilling their requirements. 
That is why they don't pay much attention towards how they are being served.

As soon as their purposes are fulfilled, they stop using web and continue 
doing other stuffs. Since they are not much aware of technologies on which 
web applications have been built and running, we can't rely much on their  
opinion to bring changes. Hence it is mostly our efforts to make any changes

that we think it needs to bring.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems you are saying you want to build complex applications, and
</I>&gt;<i> don't think PHP/web is a good way to do that. Seems clear. But if you
</I>&gt;<i> are trying to bring those complex apps to the people, people are (right
</I>&gt;<i> now) using the web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My primary concern with the Web is that it seems to be a force-fit of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page-orientation and statelessness to structured programming/object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; orientation, which I find to be inherently task-oriented.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Applications that depend heavily upon related records require that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users perform all kinds of browses.  Under those circumstances,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; managing communication among objects becomes a nightmare because it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requires the application programmer to predict communication paths to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objects and manually handle session variables that are not task-scoped
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (they are by definition, session-scoped).  It appears to me that there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a role for session variables, but it is not the task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, doing it that way is hard. Much harder than it looks. Harder than
</I>&gt;<i> people think it is. But it is also hard to travel around as a salesman,
</I>&gt;<i> pitching Ginzu knives at mall cooking kiosks, flea markets, and Wal-mart
</I>&gt;<i> stores 300 days per year. But somebody does that, and I met one guy who
</I>&gt;<i> made a million bucks doing that in one year. All we see is some guy at
</I>&gt;<i> the mall giving a great demo of a cheap knife cutting through a coke
</I>&gt;<i> can. We have no idea how much work he does to bring that show around...
</I>&gt;<i> and I doubt we care very much. As soon as he has a better way to cut out
</I>&gt;<i> the middle man and keep 80% of his sales,  I'm sure he'll choose that
</I>&gt;<i> method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The force-fit described above is particularly apparent when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programming in an MVC and validate/process/display workflow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment.  While many programmers have reservations about the need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for these disciplines, it has been my experience that they become
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; increasingly important as the size and complexity of an application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system increases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're seeing programmers (technicians) relying on tools (which
</I>&gt;<i> they have to do, to keep up). &quot;The best tool for the job&quot; , is sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> really &quot;the best avalable tool for the job, as the customer understands
</I>&gt;<i> the job&quot;. As you know, there is a difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any thoughts will be appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You got em.
