<PRE>I think code reviews are great, they give people a change to highlight well 
done code and
point out errors and common pitfalls.

Plus people can't sneak kludges in as easily.

Having a document that states comment style, code style etc can help as 
well.
At my previous job it was required all new highers read the doc.
Having code reviews made sure the guidelines laid out in the doc where 
followed.

As you stated, speaking to the other developers to find out what the 
standards will be is the best idea,
they hopefully you can avoid disagreements with what style will be 
used..since those involved will be
able to voice their opinions.

Less cooks is better, unless it means people are waiting to check stuff in 
on live.
If they have a development server that mimics live then its not really a 
problem,
they can test and feel pretty condfident about their code before they check 
it in.

If you dont have a development server that mimics the live server, I would 
get one ASAP.

good luck!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] IT Policies


Another &quot;Ask the NYC PHP Crowd&quot; question...

I've been given the responsibility of developing a policy for a small
(and growing) team of developers. By &quot;policy&quot; I mean defining how
&quot;development&quot; code becomes &quot;live&quot; code. The point is to minimize
problems in the program itself and the database behind it.

How do you balance flexibility with minimizing risk? I've talked to a
few of my fellow developers, and a few of them have talked about the
usefulness of code review. That seems to be good idea, as does
allowing only or two people to place development code on the live side
(less cooks in the kitchen).

Any suggestions on stuff I should think about?
