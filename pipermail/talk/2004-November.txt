I'd like to see PHP, Perl, (mod_perl), and Python (mod_python)  compared 
and contrasted for web development. I personally like Python best but 
mod_python is something of a pain to compile (more like PHP was a couple 
years ago). I haven't really taken much advantage of PHP5 yet so I'd 
like some insight on how it compares with Python as far as code size, 
speed, available features, CPU usage, etc.

I'm still of the general opinion that anyone that pays for a development 
platform, when you can get better platforms for free, deserves to go out 
of business. My LAMPPP systems are powerful, secure, and very stable. I 
can't think of any reason I'd want to consider ASP.NET. JSP possibly but 
not anything .NET.

Slightly OT:  I'm researching available PHP project management tools.  To
date I've found:

dotproject
eGroupware
more.groupware
PHProjekt
phpcollab

Anyone know of others?  Can anyone comment on any of the above?  I've used
phpcollab, which is pretty good, but apparently is no longer being
developed.

http://oscom.org can also be a resource.  It's generally a matter of
trial and error, but I can say Mambo, Midgard, eZ Publish, Drupal have a
generally good reputation.

Another thing to keep in mind is cost.  If you're willing a little,
you'll probably end up with a solid CMS.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] cross server session id and SHARED HOSTING
Message-ID: <21342-62342@sneakemail.com>

There are four reasons I always caution against using shared hosting.

Most important (to me) is the IP block -- if someone on that block does
something bad like send spam or spam the search engines, you may find your
site banned or your emails blacklisted or your domain otherwise guilty by
association.

The second is because an enterprising user on virtual site A can find his
way through the file system tree to view your source code on virtual site
B. 

The third is because another site can rash or jeopardize the server at your
expense. 

The fourth is because you share all server-based low-level systems, such as
the cookie issue you highlighted. It is also apparent when one influential
site runs an insecure version of Apache/PHP/whatever, thus delaying an
upgrade which would benefit your site.

Of course I use shared hosting, because of the benefits :-) and because of
the downsides associated with dedicated hosting :-) 

If this stuff was easy, all the newbies would be taking all the consulting
business, and the market rates would go way down. Thankfully, that is not
the case!

Did anyone know you can read a PHP session id from a JSP page running

I guess it only makes sense, but I wasn't expecting it.

The Other Cookbook (MySQL Cookbook) doesn't seem to have anything about

Just thought Id say, Ive been playing with Mambo for awhile and think 
its definately one of the better ones.
I tried Drupal and found it hard to "get into" but Mambo out of the box 
has a terrific backend. Ive added some components (such as the phpShop 
ecommerce component) and was pleasantly suprised that it also provided a 
backend for product management that was completely integrated into the 
existing backend. Very cool.

Plone requires Zope no?
Also the Python stuff is a major showstopper for me ;-)

Plone is based on Zope, ZPT (Zope Page Templates) and the CMF (Content
Management Framework).  As such it has huge performance requirements
and usually needs several servers for 'production use' - most folks
put a proxy in front (I prefer pound).  So not only is it very heavy
in python, but will require a significant amount of effort to get
setup and tuned properly.  They really invented their own way of doing
things, so this environment has a very, VERY steep learning curve.

On the flip side it is a really fun environment, as it has a fully-OO
database.  So you get webpages with acquisition which is a very unique
experience.  It is also tremendously easy for the end-user, as the
interface appears like a file browser, and all content can be
organized in folders.  I had a Plone site up in 15 minutes for an
attorney that was incapable of configuring his email client; and I
told him nothing more than his login and he was off to the races.

To me this is the holy grail of CMS, and hope to influence Mambo's
admin interface in that regard - just without the bloat ;-)

We're playing with Trac, and it definitely has some cool features. 
IMHO, dotproject is the only system that does project management in the
"traditional" sense.  PM systems really shouldn't be concerned with
contacts, email, tickets, CVS etc.  That's creeping into groupware, with
a software slant.  If that is what you are looking for, that works, but
when you have higher ups logging in to get info about the project
process, that just isn't going to fly.

(BTW, checked out Eventum for Bug Tracking - Nice!)

I found dotproject to be the best of the bunch to meet this goal, EXCEPT
that we have found that it doesn't seem to crunch all the numbers
correctly - the percentage complete doesn't jive with the hours
completed.  It is a complicated thing, as you need to roll up all of the
subtasks to do this, and it must have gotten lost in the logic
somewhere.  Also, it appears to be active, but there hasn't been a new
release since March.  I've been using a CVS version which I grabbed in
August, but we had to hack in our own reporting (it is weak on
reporting).  We've submitted a few patches to it, but I think we may
switch to something else if the issues aren't resolved.

I concur.  The nukes and their forks are often trouble.

I've always liked TikiWiki a lot.  Though, it was still *very* slow last
time I used it (3+ seconds per page render).  In fact, I just went to
the TikiWiki homepage at http://tikiwiki.org/ and at the bottom the
timing information says:
    [ Execution time: 6.07 secs ]   [ Memory usage: 1.56MB ]   [ 359 database queries used ] ...
6 seconds... :-(

I like Mambo and eZ.  Each has its place.  I haven't used Midgard in a
while, but liked the framework.  The Midgard CMS I believe is what used
to be Nadmin Studio, a nice GUI on top of the framework.

The process of choosing an OS CMS is tough and is often trial and error
as Hans said.  You may very well try a few before you find one that you
like or does what you need.  Another good resource is the CMS Matrix at
http://www.cmsmatrix.org/ for comparing features and finding ones you
may not have heard about.  http://opensourcecms.com/ lets you try out
various ones from their own demo installations.  This can save you time
in your evaluation process.

Since you're just starting out I might suggest Mambo, but that depends
on what you're looking to do.  It does not offer flexible content types
and can often lead to messy and duplicate URLs for pages.  But it does
offer a really nice flexible system for building entire sites w/o coding
anything but a simple template.  The most recent release is leaps and
bounds greater than previous releases in terms of UI, features,
flexibility and stability, which were good to begin with.  Mitch might
have a bit to say about all of these things.

Though, you can spend a lot of money on a product and still spend a lot
of time/money customizing it to get what you want.  There are always
trade-offs.

I have a LOT to say, as anyone that has had to sit next to me already knows LOL

Seriously, Mambo was geared for the non-technical, and sports a very
simple web-based installation interface that is hard to beat.  We put
a tremendous amount of time into that, and I would welcome any
feedback, either positive or negative.

Access to additional goodies at mosforge.net is another big draw.  The
3rd party development community for Mambo is huge and active, and you
can download (and use a web installer) all kinds of stuff from a fancy

I have worked with all of the 'biggies' in the last decade, and can
say that none of them offer anything that is unique or significantly
better than their FOSS bretheren.  The coolest was Net Dynamics, which
was bought out by Sun and disappeared in the mid-90s for some unknown
reason.  Really the 'Jimi Hendrix of CMS', IMHO.  The others: 
Documentum, Day Interactive, Broadvision...  They will certainly take
longer for you to setup than Mambo or any other garden variety
PHP-based CMS.

Ease to administer is a big subject that has not been mentioned yet in
this thread, which should deserve more focus.

OK then, in light of all the above, how's this look?

$input = str_replace(
	array('_','%'),	array('^_','^%'),
	mysql_escape_string($input));
$SQL = "SELECT columns FROM table

WORKSFORME, FWIW. PS:  Is there something sacred about the control

Message-ID: <14544-59972@sneakemail.com>

I am curious - is this really the state of the job market for 
programmers these days?

Here is a post that clearly states the employer wants a full-time, 
on-site programmer to work as directed on the core product of a new 
business, and even requires "significant night and weekend effort". And 
it quite clearly states it is to be "contract work" for an "independent 
contractor".

This appears to be a clear violation of the IRS rules for independent 
contractors, *and* it was posted by the employer (not a job shop).

I am no lawyer, but from what I can see this is the sort of blatant 
abuse of the system that the independent contractor rules were designed 
to control. Anyone who takes this job appears to risk failing the 
independent contractor test when they file their taxes as an independent 
contractor (1099 in-hand, expecting to file accordingly). That could 
make her liable for potential medicare/ss/payroll taxe issues, after the 
fact (i.e.plus penalties and interest). It also can result in a loss of 
certain deductions (such as travel, expense, self insurance, etc), again 
after-the-fact (i.e. plus penalties and interest). It appears to offer 
plenty of opportunity for such an "employee" to sue the company should 
there be such problems. And if the start-up operates this way, could it 
be susceptible to such problems for all of it's "employees" ?

Maybe there's something hidden in the "open source" aspects or 
something... but the tone and intent of the proposal appears to strongly 
suggest they intend this as a way to hire someone full-time for a trial 
period, without legally treating them as an employee (or paying the 
requisite payroll taxes, social security benefits, following the labor 
laws, etc). I've never seen this attempted without a job shopper 
handling the paperwork. Okay so at least it's not overseas outsourcing, 
but is it better?

I am no socialist by any means, but from where I sit, if you are losing 
even the minimal government provided worker protections that exist, 
something is "way wrong" with the picture. Please tell me I am 
completely wrong? From everythign I have seen over the past 10 years (7 
of them included hiring programmers), you people are valuable.

These type of "trial period" contracts directly with employers seem to be 
more and more common these days.  The most often quoted time frame I see 
is 6-month contract to hire, and it applies to developers - regardless of 
the specialty - as well as web producers and project managers in many 
cases.  Sometimes it's an accurate and good faith description of how the 
employer views its committment to you as a labor producer, many times not; 
regardless of performance.

As I understand it, the limits of working 40 hours per week as a 
contractor top out at 18 months, in which case the "project" or core 
function to which you are assigned must change, or you must have a 6 month 
break before working on the same project again.  Ways around this are to 
set up a legal entity for dealing corp-to-corp with the company, or to 
work for a contracting agency middleman who becomes your proxy "employer" 
despite working on site for the first party. 

The former entitles you to deduct many things including rent and car 
payments, among other things, but requires more work to maintain and plan 
paperwork-wise. The latter has the advantage of taking care of most tax 
related paperwork as a W2 but rarely provides any benefits and will leave 
you a bitter and twisted shell of a human being in a relatively short 
amount of time.

But yeah, this job description is legal, AFAIK.

Part of it, at least.  The person taking this position will get paid
by he hundreds, and not the thousands (like they probably would
deserve).  There is no headhunter involved,  as the client is too
cheap to pay them either.

These are the bottom-feeder projects, and there are too many of them.

If they won't commit to the 6 months of pay, then you know they are
just looking for cheap labor.  A 6-month guarantee for a business
shouldn't be an unreasonable risk, as they are getting a skilled
laborer at (presumably) a steep discount.  Tell them that if they want
the trial period, they have to pay you for the whole period.

Just got off the phone with a very smart and talended developer in
Maryland who routinely gets projects for $800 or $1000.  This, ladies
(there were two of you, right?) and gentlemen, chaps my hide.

This maneuver is sometimes referred to as a 'try and buy'. 

Usually these situations arise when the prospective 
employer has some complicated or 'one-off' system and 
must hire someone for a couple of months in order to  
see if the worker can handle the complexity or the 
'strangeness' of the system before making a fulltime 
job offer. 

The risk the employer wants to avoid is the expense of 
letting someone go, which can be considerable if a 
large compensation package is being negotiated. 

In the ad you are quoting from the advertiser says:
"Team is run by an experienced architect and senior developer.  
Fantastic learning experience for a junior programmer..."

Junior programmers can be brought on for probationary 
periods with comparatively little risk, since they don't 
get huge pay packages.

Further if the project leader is truly experienced, he 
should be able to pick someone who has the potential to 
grow into the job -- especially if it will be under his 
tutelage. 

I would say there is something not quite right about 
this job offer -- but it is not the fact that the 
person accepting the job would not be legally an 
independent contractor.

(snip)

I thought it's the normal solution, just like any piece-work job. I'm doing the same thing, and yeah the taxes bite. You also have to file taxes 4 times a year.  :(

But at the same time, I think many employees get shafted even worse for long hours with no OT. At least as a contractor you get paid for those hours.

Setting aside the question of whether this job is legit, the above
paragraph is ludicrous. You can usually tell when someone's wrong for
the job. Saying that someone is right for it is quite another
story. Many people I've thought had the right qualifications or the
skills or the potential to grow into a job have simply failed to be
able to do it, for an endless variety of reasons.

Hiring someone as a consult-to-hire is a good way to try that person
out in a real-world scenario and see if they can actually do the work,
and that there are no glaring personality conflicts. As an employer,
you take the hit for this upfront - consulting rates are ALWAYS higher
than employee pay for the same amount of work - in exchange for less
risk in the long run.

I would do a job like this because at the end of the time period i
have no doubt they would hire me as an employee based on my
performance, that is if they are not just looking for short term cheap
work.

however i am not willing to re-locate, anyone here know of any long
term telecommuting positions available?  i have been working with Lee
Eyerman, and will continue to do so, however i need to get some more
cash flow going here and i could use him as a reference.

I have completed 1 job with him and working on a second and i think my
work is good and done in a timely manner anyway.

I think it all comes down to this:

> ? Full-time dedication during full duration of project
-->  Will require significant night and weekend effort <--

Why would a developer's job require significant night and weekend effort?
This can mean one of two things:

1. We're under a deadline that we can't meet. We don't really want to
hire more people so we're looking for some contract workers but we
don't have the money so we're looking for some bright but clueless
newbies. Once the project is done we won't need you anymore.

2. There are issues that need to be dealt with 24 hours a day. Our
current two developers are tired of being on call 24/7 so we're
looking for someone cheap that can help them out till we get this
fixed.

I've seen both scenarios.
In any case, this this sounds like a very unhealthy scenario.

What's even more interesting is that this is paving the way for AI in

Actually, it is not quite that simple. The point of a captcha was to get
past that observation (if a system built it, a system can beat it). The
Captcha was to be a turing test.. something that only a human could solve. 

The most obvous flaw with the graphic captcha was that it was visual, and
therefore *specific* --which by definition made it "discriminatory" --
against the visually impaired -- and also solveable. It is the use of
machines to implement the test that causes it to be machine crackable.

Think about typed print (typefaces) vs. cursive (script handwriting). Why
wasn't the captcha created using cursive? That would have made it
infinitely harder to crack for machines, but I bet most humans could solve
a cursive captcha as well as some of the graphic ones I have seen. Of
course it is really hard to make a machine write human-style cursive --
perhaps equally as hard as it is to make a machine that can read
human-style cursive?

Where there is a will there is a way... this is simply not a turing test. 

What wouldit take to build a massive Internet database of cursive words,
collected continuously and used for captchas? Universal pen input,
probably. until then, what do we have?

I've seen (or seen theorized) captchas that require a user to enter a 
keyword based on three or more different pictures -- for example, show 
the user a Frosted Flakes box cover, that famous Nike-branded golfer, 
and a Cincinatti Bengals logo, and most users (depending on the target 
audience) could get in by typing "tiger".  One idea was also to say 
"three out of these 4 pictures" and then throw in a bogus picture of 
Bambi or the Eifel Tower. I'm sure somebody could program linguistic and 
cultural knowledge like this, but that seems a lot more "human" than 
what these guys are able to do.  ... Um, right?

Speaking of using different recognizable images to ensure that a human 
is using the system, here's an interesting article about a system called 
PassFace, where the user's "password" is a sequence of human faces 
instead of insecure combinations of letters and numbers. 
<http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/may2001/nf20010515_060.htm>

There's a demo of the PassFace system here <http://www.realuser.com/>. 
It's actually pretty neat. The beauty of it is that I can't give my 
password to anyone since it's practically impossible for me to truly 
describe each face to the degree that you can pick out my password. 
Plus, it's hard for me to forget, too, since humans naturally recognize 
faces.

The problem with this approach is that humans can still guess it, so the
adult site attack (that thing needs a name) will still work. Thus,
strengthening this further doesn't really help - it's already easier to
use the adult site attack than it is to leverage the captcha breaking
research results that have been produced.

This is a key point regarding security in general - it's unwise to focus
all of your attention in any one area, thereby assuming that this is the
one opening that a potential attacker will use. It's similar to how people
have a false sense of security when something is encrypted - often
decryption isn't necessary for a successful attack (presentation of the
original encrypted data may be all that's required).

I'm glad that there are people who focus a lot of effort on specific
issues, but personally speaking, I try to focus on the big picture.

Something here is that it's cultural - therefore, someone in Canada,
might not recognize the Bengals logo, a?

Absolutely true.  With the "genius" attack on captchas, they basically
go out the window.  Someone who is determined will defeat any captcha,
and if they don't do it with computerized recognition, they'll do it
with human recognition, which obviously defeats the entire purpose.

That said, I can't see that captchas are really a security mechanism - a
login is still required, thus being the primary "security" method
(however effective of course depends).  Captchas are to thwart
automation, and in many cases, works.

So how does one defeat automation all of the time?  Maybe someone with
that answer can also tell us how to be secure all of the time :)

yes, but then this is an attempt at a "technology solution" to a 
security problem.

There's a way to defeat the to-be-monikered-adult hack. Remind the world 
that it is illegal to participate in a security hack, and that 
participation via adultsite captcha completion is at the very minimum 
"grounds for investigation". Make it public enough that the FBI may come 
around your workplace or home asking about the time you completed a 
captcha to see those barnyard animal pictures....

Now to preserve privacy and liberty while removing anonymity to ensure 
compliance... that is a real magic trick.

I don't see how this idea will work, because people have no idea that
they're participating in any such thing. I can think of plenty of ways to
word this:

"In order to keep our competitors from harvesting our images, we ask that
you please type in the word you see in the box below. Once you do this,
we'll show you some pictures you don't want to miss!"

In fact, I would hope that it would be impossible to prosecute someone who
was tricked into providing this answer, because they literally have no way
to know that the answer they're provided is going to be misused in any
way.

Also, I suspect that people just won't care about the threat, even if 
you watermark the image 'this is property of foo.com, if you aren't 
seeing this from foo.com, please report this'.  I mean millions in 
advertising and warnings on music/movies doesn't achieve a deterent 
effect.

yes, that's the "balance between privacy/anonymity" and enforcement of 
what is essentially voluntary compliance. The idea is of course that 
people first have to be made aware that participation is a crime. It has 
to be common knowledge first. It is not up to the adult site to tell 
you, it is up to society to say it is wrong, and that you *should* know 
better.

Approach a stranger on the street and offere to sell her a watch. Many, 
many people will turn away because they don't want to get caught up in 
anything illegal.

That's why a technology solution is so attractive. It seems to suggest 
the possibility of a Utopian solution.

"I would hope that it would be impossible to prosecute someone who was tricked into providing this answer, because they literally have no way to know that the answer they're provided is going to be misused in any way."

This happens every day and that's what due process is for. It is not at all impossible but thankfully we still have a system that ensures an opportunity to defend ourselves, make a case etc. Or do we? That's why the recent justice dept detentions sans representation were so important... the new behavior has widespread implications.

Why don't nosy neighbors try your door on occasion to see if it is 
unlocked? What if your door was in a dark place, out of view. How many 
would test it then, just to "take an innocent  peek" ?

Where I live in beautiful ****** many people don't carry keys and leave 
doors unlocked. When I lived in ******* I shopped for a steel door 
because wooden doors were commonly defeated in that area. Was it because 
all the "bad people" lived in ***** or because they had basically 
anonymous access to test my security system?

I am of the camp "port scanning is not a crime" yet clearly our 
society's rule-based approach to security (threat of enforcement) does 
not apply - port scanning with an intent to determine a way to break 
security is probably worthy of being called a crime. You can't prove 
intent. Can we afford to try to prove it?

I think any IT person with an interest in the higher aspects of security 
should volunteer to work in local government for a while. You can do 
alot of good as an advisor and educator.

This is exactly why I force users on my secure Intranets to access my 
servers using Knoppix discs, have strong passwords, use encryption, etc. 
I keep telling them that it does no good to secure the servers and make 
users change passwords every other week when half of their computers are 
infected with spy software hat can capture keystrokes and other 
important information. Likewise there is no point in securing the client 
machines if everything is sent unencrpyted over their home wirelesss 
network. Or just walk in, say your a server tech, and walk out with the 
server. It's really quite easy to hack just about anybody because it's 
seldom that all aspects of security are really considered.

There is a PHP Advanced Web Site Search Script on several web site,

Not entirely sure if we are using the exact same terminology, but I 
think two of my clients are using "virtual dedicated servers".

a.

They are both hosted at MediaTemple (http://www.mediatemple.net/). 
They have the "Application Server" accounts, which are basically a 
complete copy of linux running on a shared machine.  So, when you log 
in, it looks like the whole machine is yours.  (To me, that sounds 
like a 'virtual dedicated server', though I am only familiar with it 
in this context.)

b.

Experience is generally OK.  The account itself is kind of a neat 
concept; I am able to log in and do anything I want, just as if it is 
a dedicated server.

My least favorite thing about the account is the Plesk tool, which is 
I guess basically OK, but it has its bizarre idiosyncrasies that they 
do an incredibly shitty job of explaining to you.  Also, I had a 
nightmare trying to apply a secure certificate to one account (fully 
purchased through the Plesk tool).  Most of my problems were caused 
by it defaulting to open_basedir restriction set to 'on', and not 
treating subdomains as 'real' domains (i.e., it was not possible to 
have a subdomain secure unless it was created as a 'full' domain, yet 
no documentation explained this.)

Anyway, absolutely none of that rant had to do with VDS, I guess, 
except that if you choose the (as) account at (mt), you are stuck 
with Plesk.

c.

I don't know that this question is a lot different from "What are the 
major factors to look for in a good host."  It seems to me that if 
they are running a good virtual account system, or a good dedicated 
system, they are probably running a decent VDS system (assuming they 
offer it).

Though I don't care about phone calls, in my case, my clients wanted 
to be able to reach people on the phone, and (mt) offers phone 
support.  MediaTemple has been decent...there have been some moments 
of strangeness, but for the most part they have resolved any issues 
rapidly.

After years in this business, I have just sort of settled into the 
opinion that there is no perfect Web host and I will always have some 
kind of problem, whomever I choose.

At the moment, I'm hosted on both (mt) and DreamHost.  I'm reasonably 
happy with both, which is about as ringing an endorsement I can ever 
give.

Cheers,

I've used both Rose Hosting (www.rosehosting.com) and John Companies
(www.johncompanies.com) for this. John Companies is a little more
hands-off and will do weird things for you if you ask, but Rose has
better support. If you don't know what you're doing, I'd go with Rose.

Neither of these uses Plesk.

The only real drawback is that, like shared hosting, disk space is
still massively overpriced. Otherwise, I've been very happy.

No - it's like vmware. You get a full "virtual" server on a shared
machine. You get root on the box, and to you, it looks like you have
the whole machine.

Nope, but I have used http://www.linode.com for a little over a year

> b. what kind of experience did you have?

Good, the support is very good, the control panel is excellent.  You not 
only get root on your own UML (User Mode Linux) instance, but also 
access to a virtual serial console, so you can watch your machine start 
up, etc.

> c. what are the major factors to look for in a good VDS host?

The biggest factor IMHO is the quality of the hardware and how many 
users are sharing said hardware.

Personally I have a Linode64 which is 64MB RAM, 4.5GB disk and 
25GB/month transfer for $242.62/yr.  It's running a couple of reasonably 
low volume websites and mail for a few domains, I wouldn't use it for 
more than that.

The major limiting factor seems to be RAM, as the majority of VDS users 
don't overly stress the CPU.

If you move up a rung and pay $30/month you get a Linode128, with double 
the RAM, more disk space and 38GB/month transfer.

The strength of the VDS approach is that for $60/month you could have 2 
'machines' on different hosts (eg a mailserver and webserver).

Plesk annoyed the fsck out of me so I removed it. These ease of use 
tools are not the way to have god like powers over your servers. :)

I'm happy with my hosting company. They are about as perfect as humanly 
possible in that they provide the server and the bandwidth to 
specifications and stay out of my way and let me do the rest. That's all 
I ask really. The one time I had a server go down was a bit slow but it 
turned out that the machine had multiple things go wrong with it such 
that they replaced one part that was blown and thinking the machine was 
repaired put it back in service. Shortly after a part damaged when the 
first part blew managed to blow out taking the replacement part with it. 
Annoying but frankley not the hosting companies fault. These things 
happen and they were very responsive to fixing things as quickly as 
possible.

I just discovered a really great reason to use PHP's built-in support
for HTTP authentication.

At work, we have a PHPWiki set up for some of the developers. It's
completely private, you have to log in to view anything. It also has
an RSS feed that you can use to track recently edited pages.

If PHPWiki used HTTP authentication, then team members could use a
Newsreader to keep an eye on recent edits, because they could embed
the login information in the URL:

http://username:password at intranet/wiki/index.php/RecentChanges?format=rss

But since PHPWiki authenticates via an HTML form, there's nothing they
can do. So I guess I won't call this a silly feature anymore.

Yep, this is a great way to keep track of stuff, and a good reason for 
HTTP Auth, at least for those readers which support it.

Right now Thunderbird supports embedding Login information in feed URIs, 
which is great, however to be secure when using HTTP auth you really 
should use HTTPS, which isn't supported in Thunderbird.

You can view more information about this bug here:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=254231

Another situation where supporting HTTP Auth is advantageous is for web 
services like XMLRPC.  I recently implemented an XMLRPC server which 
could use either the typical session based logins (ie you request 
system.login first with your credentials then use the returned session 
id for future requests), or HTTP Auth for single requests.

I have posted the October NYPHP presentation.

Testing PHP with Perl: Two Great Tastes that Taste Great Together

This October join New York PHP and recognized author Chris Shiflett and 
special guest Geoff Young as they look at the interesting combination of 
PHP and Perl. Stop by our IBM location to see how these two languages 
complement each other for testing.

Lots of people use PHP for Web development. Lots of people use Perl for 
testing. Why can't we be friends? This fun but genuine talk will show 
how developers can use the power of the Apache-Test framework to improve 
the overall quality of PHP applications using Perl's mature testing 
tools and methodologies.

See Chris and Geoff demonstrate valuable new techniques, combining the 
power of PHP and Perl. Platinum sponsor IBM has provided a great room 
with seating for plenty.

http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/index.php

We have posted the MP3, PDF of the presentation slides and a tarball of 
files.  Very cool stuff!

I suppose I should follow up my post, since this capability would be 
unique to virtual dedicated servers over straight virtual accounts: 
I have root access, and I could do anything I wanted to the account 
(including removing Plesk).

In my case, however, I've chosen not to, because (mt) will basically 
stop giving you support if you have root access and remove Plesk 
(which seems perfectly sensible to me).

As a lone contractor, I don't have time to field support calls from 
my clients, so I choose to work in a way where I can just forward 
their complaints to the Web host, or even tell them to contact them 
directly, unless it is something technically nuanced.

Cheers,

It doesn't matter to me. I'm sure Geoff has no plans to ever change the

Yes, it is. :-)

I'm hoping to blog about this project before ApacheCon and give a fairly
detailed overview about what it is and why PHP developers should care. The
usefulness and coolness is already there - only the advocacy and
documentation are missing.

Yeah, in fact NYPHP is all based on VDS...

> b. what kind of experience did you have?

Excellent..

> c. what are the major factors to look for in a good VDS host?

Well, from reading the rest of the thread, there are some important
different technologies that are in play here, and different ways to do
it.

The most typical, popular, and best VDS solution is by way of FreeBSD
jails.  A jail gives a user root on their own virtual server, but at the
same isolates them from the other root users on the physical server.
There's also very little overhead in terms of performance, and people
run hundreds of jails on a single server.  Google for freebsd jail
hosting or some such.

Other options include vmware and Linux virtual stuff.  vmware is nice,
and delivers a virtual machine at the hardware level; that is, the OS
sees it's own hardware, as opposed to a FreeBSD jail, which is OS
dependant.  The problem with vmware is it's resource intensive, and
might be a problem for high load environment.

Linux now also has a virtual kernel support.  This basically means the
kernel can load itself multiple times, providing some level of virtual
services.  The big problem with this is security, and I doubt people use
it very often for mission critical servers.

Go with FreeBSD jails - you won't even know you're on a shared box.  If
you have the money, I think Verio provides this service, but there are
many other smaller shops who do a good job, too.  Check out the NYCBUG
(http://nycbug.org) Talk list; there are people who can recommend
providers, since many of them do it themselves  :)

I used Westhost VDS for several clients and have used 2 others but 
wasn't the systems guy for those and don't even remember the details.

I can say two things about it that might be helpful:

1. For me it's more about the hosting company and CP than the server 
technology, IMHO. That's just where 80% of the effort is spent after the 
architecture is set, and a bad CP or a bad host staff can ruin 
everything. It seems to me VDS vendors like to produce custom CPs 
(WestHost's is in PHP and is at best "ok" in my experience).

2. My systems guy had some issues with the VDS when he went to do fun 
stuff like syslog across the servers, BigBrother monitoring, and setting 
up data streams for the Arkeia backup system. When it got to that true 
systems level, where his expectation was that he'd have full root on a 
virtualized server, he found he did not. I'm sure Hans Z understands 
this stuff and I don't , but I uhnderstand there are some things that 
can't be chrooted, and when it comes to those you are locked out and 
once again reliant on the host staff, flexibility of their server setup 
etc etc. My guy was surprised to find so much was falling into that 
category, and VDS was not a solution (we went back to dedicated machines).

Fair enough - I have heard mixed things.  I do have a couple of clients
on their shared VPSs though, and have had good luck.

Please note, I don't work for them...

And that said, support your local hoster, which is why I say NYCBUG is a
good resource.  There are many skilled VPS hosters around.

These are valid points, but let me try to make one thing clear regarding
the classing virtual server environment.

To me, and it's quite possible I've misunderstood this entire thread, a
VDS (virtual dedicated server) or VPS (virtual private server) are the
same thing.  And, this doesn't include a control panel.  In fact, most
of these providers simply supply a stripped down server, with root
access.  There are some limits, but in a typical web hosting
environment, these aren't a factor.  For instance, you can't (at least
with a FreeBSD jail) use raw sockets.

There's an important distinction between these types of services, and
those that simply supply a chroot environment or other shared hosting.
chroot supplies only one thing; it limits your directory access to below
a specified directory.

A jail, on the other hand, has implications on the entire server picture
that you see.  This means that users are up to you, processes are up to
you, etc.  A VPS/VDS won't typically provide a control panel because
they expect you to either configure your own, or not need one at all.

At the end of the day, a VPS/VDS gives you all the root functionality
you need for an AMP deployment, and you wouldn't even notice that you
are in fact sharing the hardware with someone else.  This also means
that it's unlikely there are any services running; although they might
be nice enough to get some level of email running for you.

The only production level implementation of this is using FreeBSD jails,
which is deployed using this technology:

And just to followup on this topic, we have much of this in place
already.  I've outlined what New York PHP is already on this front.

Getting Your Experiences and Information "Out There"

New York PHP has developed four different ways to get your information
published and public so that others can learn from your experiences and
insight.  NYPHP has worked hard to make these options available to our
community, and we hope that people will take advantage of them.


1) Talk List

Participation in the Talk List is the easiest and least formal way to
share your knowledge with others. All you need to do is respond to the
questions posted by other developers.

See: http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk

This is the obvious one, since you wouldn't see this post unless you
already knew about it.


2) PHundamentals

Sometimes a particular hot topic appears on the Talk List which becomes
the basis of a PHundamentals article. The guiding principle behind a
PHundamentals article is that it should be the distillation of the ideas
and methods for numerous developers for handling a particular
programming issue. The result, after much debate, is a best practice for
dealing with a particular programming issue or concepts.

See: http://education.nyphp.org/phundamentals/


Article ideas, which are candidates for a PHundamental, can be submitted
to Jeff Siegel (jeff.siegel not junk at nyphp.org).


3) AMPeers

Sometimes a topic can be handled by a single author (or two). That is,
it does not require back-and-forth debate and can be presented, as-is,
as a complete article on a topic. This would be a candidate for AMPeers.

AMPeers came out of the need for people to be able to publish their
articles on various topics.  Unlike PHundamentals, which is a large
collaborative effort that establishes best-practices via Talk list
debate, AMPeers are general experiences shared by the authors.

AMPeers is ready to launch, and we hope that the NYPHP members who want
to write will submit articles to share with the community.  You can send
your articles to Jasper Lin (jasper.lin not junk at nyphp.org), who is the
AMPeers Project Manager.

A beta site is already in place, and we'll be making a formal
announcement within the next couple of days.


4) Projects

If you have an idea that would require programming to get it out there
(e.g., a code repository), then that would be a candidate for a project.
You should then follow the guidelines for submitting a project at:

http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/nyphp/index.php?slide=10

Please contact Hans Kaspersetz (hans.kaspersetz not junk at nyphp.org) to
talk about projects.


New York PHP strives to bring information and resources together in one
place, so that our members worldwide have easy access to them, and to
form channels for people to get their own articles published.

I hope that everyone will take advantage of these resources, and please
don't hesitate to contact me directly with any questions.

That's poppycock. I run several production systems (+100K PV/month) on
linux virtual servers.

They're just fine for many sites.

Again - I'd check out rosehosting.com. They come preinstalled with a
bunch of stuff (you can do your own DNS if you want), and their
support is good. Tell 'em I sent you.

That's an excellent point, and probably something no one thinks about
when considering HTTP Auth.

That said, however, I think the perfect solution would be to convert the
HTTP auth into a form auto mechanism.  I haven't looked at the headers a
URL like the above generates, but I'm sure it possible to redirect that
into a non HTTP auth form post?

If you're sharing hardware with strangers, I'd read into the
architecture of LVM.  There's little to prevent me from loading my own
kernel, having nearly full control of the hardware, and doesn't prevent
raw sockets.

LVM was originally developed for development purposes, which made it
easy to load various kernels.  It's great for that, but does very little
in limiting the power of the loaded kernel.

This matches my experience.

When I went to VDS it was at the time that VMWare 3 was out, and IBM was 
touting fully virtualized server hardware running Linux, virtualized on 
an AS/400. They had used a mainframe to host hundreds of virtual server 
environments, each running Linux, in a way similar to VMWare's 
virtualized hardware environment - with code emulating the hardware 
interface. The kernel didn't know whether it was hardware responding or 
virtual hardware. The entire kernel was dedciated to the one virtual 
server. That is apparantly *not* what VDS/VPS is...

I'll leave the real technical stuf to you guys.

The client sends an Authorization header, which is the
username:password string in base64 encoding. So it should be possible
for your authorization scheme to check for and honor the existence of
that header...

So the real question is why would anyone want to use a virtual dedicated 
server when you can get a real dedicated server for about the same 
price? The main benefit I can see is that in theory you can pay for only 
the amount of computing power you need and upgrade easily. In my 
experience it doesn't work out that well and it's just as easy to just 
have add a new didcated server when you need more power and balance your 
load across all your servers. As far as web hosting goes at least.

What other reasons would I have to use a virtual server? I suppose it 
might be possible to move your entire virtual server to a new real 
server, as a single file, in case of a hardware failure which might save 
you time and money?

Since the formal announcement for AMPeers is being readied, 
is there anything to more to be done on getting the 
explanatory page ready (or the announcement) -- 
your post seems to pretty much cover things.

I am attaching an old post (as a reminder), because it mentions 
the fact that you don't have to be a PHP master to be able 
to contribute. Maybe this idea should somehow be worked 
into the summary page.

Along the lines of 'easy access', maybe there could be a 
menu item in the left column called 'site map' or something 
like that.

I'mn sorry, I wasn't clear - I meant "linux-based virtual servers", as
opposed to freebsd jails, not lvm.

Rosehosting says:

"We are using an in-house built solution. We do not use any
commercially/publicly available virtualization software. This gives us
much greater control and flexibility in it's development and
maintenance. Most of the commercial solutions (virtuozzo, etc...) have
big problems and limitations and were created with the hosting company
in mind, not the end user."

Which obviously says nothing about whether they're secure or not. I'd
be interested in the kinds of tests one might perform to see if access
to the rest of the box is available to others on the box.

That is generally not the case. I did see that serverpronto had a 
dedicated server for $30, the lowest I've ever seen and a price that 
low even scares me a little.
But I've had a Virtual Private Server for $10 a month. Root access for 
$10 a month! Please point me to the Dedicated server for that price, 
I'll take ten.

How much bandwidth, CPU, RAM, and hdd space does that include? I pay 
$50/month for a real server. I've seen cheaper offers but the difference 
was so little that I didn't really care.

What I'd really like is a local hosting company with a huge pipe that'd 
let me bring my own box in and plug it in. Disk space is always my one 
problem with hosted solutions as their idea of enough disk space is 
several zerors short of my idea of enough disk space. I'd love to have 
5TB of space on a server - I could make something pretty cool with that 
kind of space. The closest I've came to that solution so far is to put 
up a local server in my home and use my real server as a proxy that 
caches requested objects.

I'm sorry, we live in different worlds if $10 or $50 doesn't make a

Maybe I should rephrase - the cheaper offers didn't interest me because 
they didn't seem to offer as much or have the same level of customer 
support.

I thought that was the default colocation setup -- you rent rackspace
for something like $30 per U per month, which includes some amount of
bandwidth. Then you pay for extra bandwidth a la carte.

If you ask around enough (and buy the right people drinks) you'll
eventually find someone who leases a full rack somewhere, and is
willing to let you buy in. You get a discount on what the datacenter
would charge you for a single space, and they get break on their
overhead.

Amen, brother. Although it would take nerves of steel to hand over my
shiny new 5TB sever to someone else.

That is the problem. All XML functionality in PHP 5 requires libxml.

Message-ID: <adca5f7d041108092549913bae@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone had success with web services in PHP?

I'm have a need for 2 php based web servers to talk to each other (in
order to do some database syncing) and I thought that webservices
would be a good way to do this. I haven't done much with web services
and I'm looking for a starting point for writing a SOAP client and
SOAP server. Has anyone tried PEAR::SOAP? Is there a better way to do
some DB syncing?

Thanks for the tips,

My end goal is to have multiple affiliated websites use data from one
database. Ultimately, I'd like to have the data reside on each server
locally so I don't have to have the ridiculous overhead of making
database requests between 2 points on the globe.

My idea was to set up a sort of meta-table which would keep track of
all the transactions in a database. Then, when a site needs to update
it's data, it requests (via web service) all of the transactions since
the last time it updated it's records, from the master database
server.  Then, the client retrieves the response from the SOAP server,
and updates it;s records accodingly.

I do realize that having such a meta-table keeping track of all the
transactions in a database would be a bunch of overhead too. However,
for this project, there's < 100 records per week, so it's not
completely out of line.

The reason I thought that web services would work well has to do with
the potentially complex set of requests that I would be making
remotely and the relative complex (xml) structure of the results.

These sites are hosted on mainstream hosting servers, so I don't have
a ton of control over using things like MySQL replication
techniques... but I AM looking deeper into that solution.

Thanks,

Eric

I'm a PostgreSQL guy, but I am fairly confident that you could hook
into MySQL's query log, and parse based on timestamps.  In a sense you
wouldn't even need XML, as you could just transport the data from the
logfile.

Assuming both servers are running compatible versions of MySQL,
wouldn't this be the easiest (and therefore less error-prone)
approach?

Message-ID: <418FC0BD.6030705@r2communications.com>

I have a client that has asked for me to take over the development of 
their e-commerce app.

I can easily create the pieces/parts for entering and managing data such 
as products, categories, users, etc. But the client also needs some 
additional functionality that I've never built from scratch, such as 
online payment processing via a gateway.

So I started looking at osCommerce, and quite frankly, can't make heads 
or tails out of the code. I would need to make some modifications in 
order to fulfill some of the requirements, but it would take me forever 
to figure out what is going on in osCommerce. I've been working with PHP 
for about three years now, and do most of my development in OOP these 
days, but osCommerce is just way over my head.

Does anyone have any suggestions for other packages I should look at?

Are updates occurring in one or two directions?

On the whole, I wouldn't bother with all the overhead of a soap. I
would just dump the update log someplace and fetch it using cron.

I've been playing with phpShop now that it has been integrated with
Mambo, and can say that it is certainly full-featured and mature. 
Have not spent the brain cycles to work with the code however, so my
opinion is from the end-user perspective.

But maybe it's considerably more reliable in 4.1 ? Because I played with
it in 4.0.x on 2 Windows boxes for quite a while and the slave kept
falling out of sync and giving up. I myself got annoyed and gave up (for
now).

there is a commercial one out there called x-cart that i recommend. 
It uses smarty for templates so it is very simple to modify.

I have had a lot of luck using X-Cart.  I have rolled out two site this 
year on it.  One with 600+ products and the other with 15 products.  The 
600+ product implementation needed a lot of customization because of 
thiner wacky inventory system and the way the product is grouped when 
sold.   Both implementations were completely reskined.

I am very happy with X-Cart.  I have had not problems adding the custom 
elements I needed.  I have found their staff and the forums very very 
helpful and it is under active development so patches are released 
regularly.  http://www.x-cart.com/  If you have any questions about 
X-Cart do not hesitate to email me off list.

A load balancer that supports sticky originating IP addresses (so that 
visitors will be routed to the same server based on their originating 
IP address) is the most common hardware based solution that I've seen.

Will forcing sessions to use cookies solve the problem completely. Can 
you think of any issues that might arise?
Forgive me for asking before I look, but it seems like a DB backed 
session solution would be a great PEAR project.

I think what Adam was referring to was storing the actual session 
content in a cookie, rather than just the session_id.

This can work provided your session data is small, and you don't ever 
trust it any more than any other data provided by the user.

As for Database backed sessions, they can and do work very well.  I'd 
suggest you take a look at ADOdb's solution here:

http://adodb.sourceforge.net/

It has a well implemented system which support various 'plugins' or 
'filters' such as encryption and/or compression of the session data.

You can encrypt or sign it as well, reducing a users ability to inspect 
or (successfully) tamper with the cookies contents.

MySQL replication has been solid since 3.23.x, and improved greatly in
4.0 (binary log).  Not many changes in 4.1.

Replication in 4.0 is solid, and drives many large sites, data sets,
etc.  I was onsite not too long ago that was replicating 2000 INSERTS/s
across three slaves.

Yes. This is the route to go if you're using cookies. Recipe 9.3 of
PHP Cookbook has code to do with for forms using md5(), but it's easy
to modify this for cookies.

That works fine for tamper-resistance.  If you want to eliminate 
inspection, you should use a cypher like 3des, sha or blowfish.

Hello,

Is it possible under IIS 5 with PHP 4.2.2 running as a CGI to get the
HTTP status code? I'm writing a small function that will create a log of
the requests in the Combined Log Format and to my despair, when I look
at the $_SERVER array, I don't see where is logged the http status code.
I though that I could just look at the raw request string, but I can't
find a way to get it.

I've been all over the web to find a solution. I don't see nothing about
this in these books; PHP Cookbook, Essential PHP Tools, Advanced PHP
Programming, PHP Developer's Cookbook.

TIA

Cheers
-Emmanuel

I save my session data to my db and thus can load balance my webservers 
with no issues when it comes to sessions. It appears MySQL now lets you 
properly cluster database servers too so you can spread that load across 
multiple machines too. Can't wait to try it. :)

Message-ID: <002a01c4c60b$09870500$6800a8c0@SPIKETV1515>

Hi,

Ive moved some code from MySQL to static XML/Xpath and was trying to figure
out if there is an easy way to perform (and sort) sum calculations .. For
example:

<goal name="J. Baer"/>
<goal name="J. Doe"/>
<goal name="J. Baer"/>

Id like to end up with:

J. Baer 2
J. Doe 1

Without having to do a map in PHP.  Is there an Xpath hack/function to do
this?

Thanks.

- Jon

Have a look at the XSLT Cookbook.  I think there may be a function in 
there for this:

Ophir,
I am your man, i have no formal education with programming and have
learned PHP some C without the knowledge of GTK or QT yet.

I first started learning PHP about 5 years ago, i bought a few books
on PHP 4 and mysql, once i read through those and did the examples
(always typed them and didnt use the source on cd or any shortcuts
like that)  I used #php channels on IRC quite a bit for help and find
that they are a good resource for help, they will not spoonfeed you,
you are still going to have to google, but they will give direction,
advice on better coding styles, and sometimes the flat out answer. 
Generally you will find me on irc.freenode.net in #php and #php-gtk as
i started to learn GTK but have now stopped due to time constraints. 
Mostly though i have learned PHP and everything else i know about the
computer through day to day use, and books.  As i look at my bookshelf
at this point i see 8 books related to PHP and MYSQL the best i have
read would have to be Core PHP Programming 3rd Edition ISBN:
0130463469

As i said above i know a little C programming which i have thanks to
Deitel & Deitel for, thier books are very expensive but are well worth
the investment as they are easy to follow, clear and to the point. 
The book i used is C How to Program 3rd Edition ISBN: 0130895725

I want to learn more C programming and will be spending more time on
it in the near future as i have always thought it is good to know more
than one language if one dissapears you have the other to rely on.

I would love to get a degree at some point however i do not see this
happening, i have a family now and attempted the online college route,
this fell through because in my second class the instructor was
unreachable after the 2nd week.  I had financial aid and loans but
failed a course due to an instructor not being reachable nor was the
classroom (newsgroup).
The school stated that i had to pay for the failed course and i refuse
to do so since it was the instructors fault.  However that is my
background, if you have any paths you suggest i travel such as new
languages to learn i would appreciate any advice you have.

If you've had experience (or simple heard about a colleague) using a
freeware PHP/MySQL-based Content Management System (CMS), I'd like to hear
your feedback/recommendations. 
 
My client will need admin tools to create things like: 1) exhibition-type
galleries of images with descriptions, 2) events calendar, 3) press
releases,  and 4) brief articles with title, subtitle and associated
image(s). 
 
Additionally, any thoughts on comparing a CMS tool that mostly has an "admin
pages with input boxes saves to database" flow vs. a tool that provides
graphical HTML editors that allow the client to design/maintain their site.
 
A product name is all I really need. Thanks in advance.

Yes.

If you don't want to use the PEAR class, maybe their source code can 
help you.

I think what Emmanuel was referring to was the response code of the 
server, as he mentions logs.

The problem is that php will only be invoked on a successful request, so 
  the status would always be 200.

The only other codes you could potentially trap and log would be to use 
custom 404 handlers, etc.

Disclaimer:  I am a core developer of Mambo, so my enthusiasm may be
just a tad over the top ;-)

I've been designing, implementing and migrating CMS since 1995, and
now work on the Mambo project (www.mamboserver.com).  I'm constantly
evaluating both commercial and FOSS systems, and can help there if you
have a short list for review.

One way to try before you download is to go to Open Source CMS
(www.opensourcecms.com) where you can demo one of many different ones
- note that the site is powered by Mambo ;-)

I like Mambo because it is simple, lightweight, and has a huge 3rd
party community providing image galleries, shopping carts, events
calendars, thumbnail generators, flash animated analog clocks, and
anything else you would want.  The biggest source for add-ons is
MamboForge (mamboforge.net), where you can search or browse through
what is available.

I read the manual at php.net.  

The PHP manual is a concise and (mostly) elegant introduction to the
language, annotated by programmers around the world. The authors
deserve infinite credit in my opinion.

Yes, exactly. Thanks. 

Oh well, I wish I knew that yesterday :). Gee, I guess this is PHP 101.
Before I look in my books or on the Web, anyone has a pointer to what in
the Apache world is called by mod_perl developers (and probably others I
guess) the "request loop". I'm definitely interested to read more about
this to clear my head on the question, although, maybe it makes no sense
in the context of PHP. I'm especially interested in how PHP handle the
request from Apache/IIS (CGI/Fast CGI).

I'd like though, to know a way in PHP 4x to get what the server is
giving to PHP before PHP massage it in it's PHP Superglobal.

Cheers

Message-ID: <001501c4c672$fb54da30$68e4a144@yourx1adg12jme>

Step One:
Don't' spend money on beginner's books. Start by reading the basic books
right there in the store like at a Barnes & Noble.

A.) Learn about PHP and the Apache web environment first:
"PHP: Your Visual Blueprint for Creating Open Source, Server-Side Content"
by Paul Whitehead.
This book is real good for absolute beginners with lots and lots of screen
captures.

B.) Then get a handle on SQL, the language:
"Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes, Third Edition" by Ben Fort.
Step by step for learning SQL.

C.) Then get a grasp on MySQL by seeing it in basic action:
"PHP and MySQL for Dummies" by Janet Valade.
At first, learn about MySQL tangentially.

Step Two:
Look at and absorb as much of the intermediate books in the store also. Buy
only one. The one that talks to you most.


Step Three:
Sample all the expert books in the too. Expert books are the only one's you
will need at home/office. Buy two. 

Secretly, I've used the "...for Dummies" series. Always a reliable, great
intro to any programming topic(s). Just don't buy. Read 'em in the store. 

Finally, go mano a mano with Wrox books. When you really have to know a
concept, you are going to have to turn to advanced/expert Wrox. Period.  

Generally, I've found that I can pretty thoroughly grasp any difficult new
programming concept by studying it via three different books/manuals. 

Concurrently, read tutorials on the web a lot. There are a lot of sources,
but I found that www.phpdeveloper.org covers a lot.

Peter,

I am sorry i have to disagree with you...

if you are going to sit in the bookstore and read the books, you
should buy them if they contain information that will help you learn,
i have a rather good size php book collection because i support the
authors by buying the books, if you just go to the bookstore and read
and learn that author isnt getting anything if you dont buy the book,
yes if you dont have the cash to buy the book right then by all means
read it there, but try to buy it.

Afterall the knowledge you learn from a good book is well worth the
$50-100 you spend on the book.

sorry i dont mean to be rude or flame i just thought i would state the
obvious and my stance in this situation.

Oh incase people are not aware of it, check out Safari Bookshelf
http://safari.oreilly.com you can create a bookshelf and have access
to the online books for a monthly fee, usually cheaper than buying the
books, only drawback is you have to read them online.

I fully agree. I know a lot of programming languages and read a lot of 
technical manuals and the PHP manual is one of my favorite. It is much 
easier to work with than most.

I installed Mambo locally. Tooling around admin now. Looking quite nice.
Further, I'll be looking at Typo3 and Digital Workroom. 

Thanks.

Hello,

Just to be sure, does error_log ($text, 3, $logpath);
use an internal  exclusive lock mechanism internally when writing to a
log file? I'm wary of corrupting my log files.

TIA

First, I heartily apologize for not mentioning O'Reilly. They are an
excellent top-caliber reference book publisher (especially on the cusp with
all XML and related) and they host a best of breed web site giving tons of
sample chapters as PDFs that can be used to dig into almost any topic. 

For all those who have written the tech books that I have used to learn
programming, I apologize that I did not buy all the books, but over the past
7 years or so since I started with regular HTML and JavaScript. Then CSS.
Then plain SQL. Then did VBScript. Then VB 4, 5, 6. Then ASP 3. IIS 3, 4, 5.
Then T-SQL and MS SQL Server 7, 2000, 2002. Then NT4. Then Windows Server
2000, 2003. WSH. Then moved on to PHP 3, 4, 5. MySQL 3, 4, 5. Apache 1.3.x,
2. Then XML, XSLT, XPATH, XQUERY. Then Unix, PERL. 

VPN, TCP/IP, RTSP, WRDL, RSS, HTTP, SMTP, FTP, SSL, WML, MPEG, JPEG, TIFF,
EPS, PDF, RTF, CSV, PostScript, Real, WMV, Ethernet, IDS, proxies, load
balancing, firewalls, encryption...

Quark 3, 4, QuickTime 4, 5, 6, Flash 4 - MX, Dreamweaver 3 - MX,  Photoshop
2 - 7, Illustrator 3 - 10, MS PowerPoint, Word, Excel, Outlook 95 - XP.
Also, Freehand, Fireworks, Distiller, Visio, WordPerfect, Bryce... 

Geez, I know I'm forgetting some things... And I know that there are many on
this list still deeper than me and they know even more code/apps. I've
hardly batted and eye at C, Python, Tcl, JAVA.

I did an informal summation of the dollars (thru my tax records) and I have
nonetheless spent a bit on books -- easily three thousand dollars.

Well, it only makes sense in an Apache context, of course.

Geoff Young (one of the core mod_perl developers and last month's speaker)
gives a talk every once in a while named something like Programming the
Apache Lifecycle. You can probably find some slides online somewhere.
There's also this 6 page PDF from his book:

http://www.modperlcookbook.org/chapters/part3.pdf

If you're interested in playing around with more than just the content
generation bit, George Schlossnagle wrote a SAPI called apache_hooks. It
exposes much more of the Apache API, although I've never actually played
with it (I keep meaning to). He'll probably speak up and mention that it's
most likely broken, since I don't think he's touched it in a while, but
it's worth a try. :-)

Hey folks,

We certainly are having a Nov. meeting, and it'll be a very interesting
one.  We're having a Systems Engineer from AMD come talk about the AMP
Technology platform on AMD and 64 bit.  I'm sorry it's not on the
calendar yet, but I'll be sure to have it by tomorrow.

As a primer for the presentation, we've been working with AMD to get
this under discussion.  Thanks to NYPHP's Michael DeWitt and reps from
AMD, we have a complimentary dual AMD64 box for testing.

In fact, I've been on the PHP-Internal list discussing getting PHP up to
par on lib64 systems.

See http://www.zend.com/zend/week/week209.php for the work I and others
have done on taking AMP to the 64 bit platform.

I've documented all the gotchas, intricacies, and basic steps of working
on a lib64 platform, including Apache, MySQL, SuSE, and Red Hat.  As
part of NYPHP's AMPeers project, I'll be publishing a detailed article
on how to deploy on this next generation platform.

If anyone wants the raw documentation and tutorial, feel free to contact
me now.

I know it's right before T-Day, but you won't want to miss it.  David
from AMD is a highly skilled tech that you can hit with the tough
questions, so we're looking forward to a great pre T-Day meeting.

Sorry for the delay folks.  We'll get the announcement up tomorrow but
put this meeting on your calendar.

It's most likely broken (though you never know); and I'm too busy to 
fix it.  I'm happy to help anyone trying to get it working again find 
the right path.  Without that you have really no access to the request 
lifecycle from PHP.

>Well, it only makes sense in an Apache context, of course.

Ah sorry, I was not crystal clear about this. I used mod_perl as a
comparison. What I'd like to find is some pointers that explain how PHP
handle the request from the server when running for example, as a module
in Apache, and the same thing when PHP is running as a CGI with IIS for
example. What is exposed in PHP that comes from the server, and how to
get the "raw" request that is passed to PHP before its parsed in PHP
Superglobals.

Thanks, I have this book and the "Writing Apache Modules". But I never
really read these books. Just after getting them, I was "force" to learn
PHP for a job, and then, never look back. One of the best thing that
happened in my programmer life. Although before I really learned PHP, I
read a lot about it, and looked at the language, and found it awful, and
had my head full of stereotypes about PHP (like the famous quote from
Randal L. Swartz: 'PHP - it's "training wheels without the bike"'
<http://perlmonks.thepen.com/18694.html>).

This look interesting. I see it mentioned in its last book (I just
checked the index).  apache_hooks when stable could be a great addition
to the PHP toolbox.

Yes, it is - and yes, I'd very much like to see it working, since it'd
be invaluable, especially in a application context.

But if you do get bored over the holidays, George, feel free to pick it

I learned PASCAL in High School, with a bit of C++ (only the 1st year
class) - my high school offered about 8 programming classes, and I
took 6 of them.

I picked up C by the basics of C++ that I learned in class, and
applied it to changing MUD code, since most distributions of MUDS are
available for download.

I learned php by wanting a scripting language to do databases/etc for
a website I was working on, with just having an entry form and a
list.. so I installed php/mysql/apache in 1999, and it just
skyrocketed from there, and now I have written some php applications
for the places that I have worked for. Also I took a job and am now
co-webmaster of http://www.war3.com/ - where I learned a lot more
about php by wanting the website to run smoother and easier, and
having a lot more automated tasks, and integration between other PHP
applications.

PHP was easy to pick up, especially with my C/C++ knowledge, and also
my dabblings with Java. I did not like visual basic at all, and having
the further availability of php servers around the internet than ASP,
I decided not to even touch asp until years later.

Hello all,

I hope the New York City winter winds have not cooled your interest in all
things PHP and MySQL yet.

I remember reading in an older issue of PHP Architect about a free tool
used to build a visual representation of a MySQL database. I am not sure
what to call such a tool: a schema mapper, a schema diagram tool, or
something else?

In any case, after quite a bit of googling, I don't seem to be getting
anywhere. (I am considering buying the new SmartDraw Suite 7, available
from smartdraw.com, which is an all-purpose diagramming / drawing tool. I
also got a special $100 off discount link for it, which makes it more of a
tempting buy.)

Still, I would prefer to find a more specialized tool that will let me
clearly show the relationships between tables: foreign keys, indices,
keys, columns and column types, etc.

I am also willing to pay a reasonable sum of money ($0 - $300) for a
commercial tool that does just this.

Sorry if this topic has been brought up before: I tried using
"site:lists.nyphp.org mysql" in Google to search the mailing list
archives, but that does not seem to work.

Thanks in advance and enjoy the tropical weather here in New York!

- Jay

I use DB Designer from FabForce regularly and love it.  I use it to 
create the schema diagrams and then for the generation of the SQL code 
to build the DB.  Occasionally, I have to go into the SQL and hand edit 
it to get things exactly right.  Not sure if that is the application or 
if that is my poor use of it.

Hello Rahmin,

fabforce.net was the one was I was looking. Thanks a lot for the link. I
could not find it anywhere on Google (during my previous search).

If it is a good product, I would be happy to tip the software creator.

(I just tried mydbpal and had to suffer through a painful signup form (no
underscorea allowed in the email address or username). Then after 10
minutes I still could not figure out how to use the product. Clicking on
any button is useless! Maybe Mydbpal is intended for people smarter than I
am, but I would gladly try something else that is easier to use. On to
fabforce ...)

Best regards,

- Jay

Subject: [nycphp-talk] lazy initialization woes
Message-ID: <4FC7F25A-337C-11D9-8B36-000D932DF2B4@sneer.org>

I'm working on a project in PHP with the hopes of releasing it if I can 
get it off of the ground and I've ran into a problem that I'm hoping 
someone can lend a hand with. The basic notion is that a given object 
will potentially contain other objects, but these contained objects 
aren't known (or generated) until runtime.

For example, we'll instantiate a sales_order object and then, using its 
has_a() method, add a customer object to it. To prevent cascades of 
objects being instantiated, I'd plan to use lazy initialization - the 
customer object won't be instantiated until the first time that it's 
accessed through the customer class. The problem that I'm having is 
that lazy initialization in PHP 5 is accomplished via the __get() 
method which is called when an attribute (or contained class in this) 
isn't available - it's passed the name of the property that wasn't 
found and that's not enough information for me to return the attribute 
of the contained object that was being accessed. Here's some quickly 
written code with extra code stripped that'll demonstrate what I mean:

<?

class sales_order {
     ...

   public function has_a( $class ) {
     $this->relationships[ $class ] = 'has_a';
   }

   public function __get( $class ) {
     if(array_key_exists( $class, $this->relationships )) {
       if( $this->relationships[ $class ] == 'has_a') {
         $this->$class  = new $class( $this->id );
         return;
       }
     }
   }
}

So if $attribute exists in the relationships array, it's instantiated 
(and, yeah, I plan to move the contained objects into a declared array. 
one thing at a time :) )

$sales_order = new sales_order;
$sales_order->has_a( customer );
print $sales_order->customer->name;

The last line fails, because __get is passed only 'customer' and not 
'customer->name' - I have no way of knowing what attribute of customer 
was being accessed, so I can't return the requested data. Running this 
code:

$sales_order = new sales_order;
$sales_order->has_a( customer );
print $sales_order->customer->name;
print $sales_order->customer->name;

the fourth line works, because the customer object was instantiated 
during line three (line three still fails to return a value). Does 
anyone have any suggestions on how to get this working?

Apologies in advance for the verbosity of this email, I really did try 
to strip out as much as I could.

thanks!

I'm not 100% on overloading in php5, but I think you need either:

class sales_order {
     ...

   public function has_a( $class ) {
     $this->relationships[ $class ] = 'has_a';
   }

   public function __get( $class, &$obj ) {
     if(array_key_exists( $class, $this->relationships )) {
       if( $this->relationships[ $class ] == 'has_a') {
         $this->$class =& $obj =& new $class( $this->id );
         return true;
       }
     }
     return false;
   }
}

or

class sales_order {
     ...

   public function has_a( $class ) {
     $this->relationships[ $class ] = 'has_a';
   }

   public function __get( $class ) {
     if(array_key_exists( $class, $this->relationships )) {
       if( $this->relationships[ $class ] == 'has_a') {
         return $this->$class =& new $class( $this->id );
       }
     }
   }
}

Hey Dan,
no joy on those suggestions, though I did have some hope for the second 
one. The problem is that __get() is truncating the attribute that 
wasn't found from customer->name to just customer, so I don't know what 
attribute access of customer failed - if I did know then it'd just be a 
matter of splitting out the first class name before the -> operator, 
instantiating that class name and then returning its property asked for 
(it'd actually be more than that to account for nested containers, but 
you see what I'm driving at).

Failing this method, does anyone have any other suggestions on 
implementing this type functionality?

FWIW, these types of nasty hacks should no longer be necessary in PHP
5, God willing.

The first thing I would do is try is to sloppy way and just
instantiate every object. I would then benchmark the performance and
see if it's acceptable.

Why stress out over a complicated programming solution when the easy
one may work perfectly fine?

Alternatively, it may be as simple as putting more RAM in your boxes,
which would be far less than the development time necessary to write
and maintain this.

The notion was to use this as the basis for an ORM (ala Class::DBI or 
Ruby on Rails) and in that context, given the right circumstances, it 
could lead to unnecessarily loading <strikethrough>hundreds (or even 
thousands)</strikethrough> a shitload of objects. I'm headed out for a 
walk and a cig or two to mull this over.

Thanks for the suggestion, Adam.

Hi,

Kinda lame but, I tried looking for something on web which made light of
what packages/libraries/functions most people were using on a normal basis
so .. thought Id start a quick little topic, more like a survey, maybe
someone would like to compile it and post?  Here goes, pretty self
explainatory:

What are the top 5 most *useful* PHP functions to you? (in no order)

+ preg_match_all
+ preg_replace
+ array_unique
+ array_combine
+ (tie) file_get_contents and simplexml_load_string

- Jon

1.  echo()    :)

My favorite has always been explode() though.   The name of that function 
alone got me interested in learning more about PHP.   So in a way I guess 
it was the most useful.

Can that really count, though? :-)

(For the record, I'm not trying to be one of those people who claim we
only have 8 fingers and 2 thumbs).

Yeah, a cool and intuitive name, plus it's pretty fast.

I'd have to second the explode(), and it's antithesis, implode().  Just 
the names alone validated how cool PHP is.  =)

Hi all,

I finally have a real-world project that has impelled me to get beyond all the basic tutorials I've gone through.. but I'm stuck.  Here's the description of what I'm trying to achieve and the problem(s).

when a hiring manager at my employer hires a new person, the HR dept. presents the hiring mgr. with these 4.25 x 5.5 inch slips of paper with some questions for rating the applicants.. you interview 5 people, you have to fill out five pieces of paper.

My Database:

1) ethnicity:  eth_id, eth_name  (5 rows.. will never change)

2) position:   pos_id, pos_name (i want to avoid creating multiple names for the same position)

3) interviewer: int_id, int_fname, int_lname (these are the managers... I'd like to prevent people from  putting their name in different ways at different times (like.. Josh Freeman, Joshua Freeman..)

4) applicant:  app_id, app_name (what if the same applicant applies for more than one position?)

5) reason:  reason_id, reason_text (i.e. too inexperienced, not enough experience.. mean the same thing..  so create a separate table...)

and the MAIN TABLE!

6) rating:  rating_id, app_id, pos_id, eth_id, gender(enum or separate table?), interested (ditto), reason_id, comments, datestamp

So.. already, I need some guidance on how much to break this out.. do I need two more tables for gender and 'interested'?

Here's my pseudo code:

1) page loads:  while loading, php reaches into the tables of the database to grab the existing lists of interviewers, positions, applicants, ethnicities, reasons and maybe genders and 'interested' 

2) page displays the form:  using the information grabbed while loading the form consists of:

     pulldowns for interviewer, position, applicant, ethnicity, reason
     radio button for gender
     checkbox for 'interested' and textarea for comments

2a) in addition to pulldowns, the person filling out the form can write in interviewer fname, lname, position name, applicant fname, lname and reason...

3) person submits form ... if information was written in instead of taken from the pulldowns then that information needs to get written to the correct tables and then the id numbers from those rows have to be put into the new record being created in the main table...

Finally, 

4) the submitted data is displayed back to the browser

Does this all make sense?

I can take form input and put it into a single table, but now.. I'm really LOST..

can someone help me?

I'm googling for the tutorial(s) or examples I need but I'm not finding yet...

Thanks in advance for any handholding or advice.

Cheers,

J.

You've already guessed that this is pushing the envelope in php, but
that makes it kinda cool, too.

Does this seem like a bug to anyone else? It *should* work exactly the
way you expect it to, Jason.  I know that probably doesn't help right
now tonight.

Would it help to use a slightly different tack?

function __call( $class, $args ) {
  if(array_key_exists( $class, $this->relationships )) {
    if( $this->relationships[ $class ] == 'has_a') {
      if ( isset( $this->{$class} ) ) {
        return $this->{$class}->{$args[0]};
      }
      else {
        $this->$class  = new $class( $this->id );
        return  $this->{$class}->{$args[0]};
      }
    }
  }
}

print $sales_order->customer('name');

Okay, I'll bite:

1) file_get_contents()  -- could anything be easier?
2) serialize()  -- for storable objects
3) strpos() -- even more important to me than substr()
4) htmlentities() -- speaks unicode
5) print_r() -- one-line debugger

And if I had to pick a control structure it would be foreach. I mean,
does anyone use list() anymore?

Well, it pretty much sounds like you're off to a good start.  Breaking
down the application flow, abstracting where you can, etc.  But I'm
not quite sure where your question is.

I'd recommend putting the same kind of thought to the places where you
are 'lost' - ie, if you're wondering how to put new interviewers into
the DB that don't exist, break it down step by step and write some
functions to handle it.  Otherwise www.php.net/mysql_insert_id will
probably be handy.

function add_new_interviewer( &$interveiwer_info ) {

    $query = "INSERT...";
    $result = mysql_query($query) or error_handler();
    $new_key = mysql_insert_id();  // yes, yes - need better error
handling, what if the insert fails?

  return $new_key;

}

if (!$pulldown) $new_interviewer_ID = add_new_interviewer( $some_form_data );

I would say you're pretty safe with gender being an enum - unless
we're looking to add some new genders some time soon.  Interested? 
Well, if you're certain that you'll never use anything besides yes or
no than an enum could work, as could a tiny int for true/false.  Kinda
depends on your app.  But why add an extra query or join when they
will not change and can be coded into your app (or config file).

Overall remember that applications evolve and do your best to allow
for that in your initial design.  You'll never get it perfect and
pieces will have to be rewritten - but it seems to me that you're
doing just fine.

:)

Let me explain a bit and try to make it so you understand.  In PHP &
is the reference operator, this allows you to pass a variable by
reference rather than by value.  Here is an example

$var = 4;
func( $var );
// echo's 4
echo $var;

function func( $var ) {
    $var++;
    // echo's 5
    echo $var;
}

if you run this code, you will see how the values of $var are
different inside the function and outside the function.  The one
outside the function is 4 and the one inside is 4.  When you pass by
value php defaults to making a copy of the variable.

When you use the & (reference operator) it will pass $var by reference
rather than by value, this passes the memory address rather than
making a copy of the variable.  Let me show anoher example.

$var = 4;
func( &$var );
// echo's 5
echo $var;

function ( $var ) {
    $var++;
}

If i am correct about this (which i believe i am) when you echo $var
after the function call, $var now equals 5 because you passed the
variable by reference rather than letting PHP make a copy.  You need
to be careful passing variables/objects by reference, if you do not
intend to have the function change the value of the variable outside
of the functions scope, do not pass by reference.

I hope you understood everything i have said, if you do not, please
feel free to ask any questions reguarding my reply.

That is known as passing by reference.  When you omit the '&', you are
actually making a copy of it instead of passing it directly to that
function or method.

This can be a problem with larger apps under heavy load, where you
accidentally have the webserver making copies of many arrays and
objects.

This behavior is changed by default in PHP5, and there are others on
this list that are much more knowledgable on PHP5 than I.  I'm still
trying to get Fedora Core 3 to install ;-)

Line 3 fails because you do not return anyting from __get()
You should return " $this->$class " from your __get function call.
Line 3 = $undifined->name;
Line 4 succeeds because __get is not called and you have now a new
property "$this->class" that is public by default so therefore
accessed directly.
Line 4 = $customer->name;

Code examples aside, my favorite analogy regarding the difference between
value and reference passing is:

"A variable is like a piece of smail-mail, it comes with two parts: The
letter (or value) and the envelope (or address). When you open the envelope
and give someone the letter inside, you are passing by value (or assigning).
It's the same as the "=" operation. When you give someone the envelope, you
are passing by reference. That's the operation done by "=&" and its up to
them to dereference the mail - to open the envelop to see what's inside."

Maybe someone will find that useful...

Thanks, that's helpful to know, I didn't realize PHP had the option of 
passing variables by reference.

I've sent a reworded email to internals to see if this is how they'd 
anticipated __get() working or not. I'll submit a bug report based on 
the responses that I receive.

That's a good idea, and I'll probably wind up using something like that 
if the issue with __get() can't be resolved. Thank you and the other 
responders for your help!

returning just the class doesn't work - I'm attempting to access an 
attribute of that class. Thanks for the reply, though.

PHP/MySQL/ADODB and the *real* application is J2EE.

So what I am looking to do is add some of the enterprise-level functions

- imaging and document management
- integration with Adobe Forms

I've found some live chat options, but don't seem to be having much luck

Guys,

I have an sql query that uses one table to join another, the tables
are ci2_bizopps and ci2_companies, each company could have many
entries in the bizopps table and what i need to do is get each company
name only once.  However since we are searching the bizopps table it
returns a result for each bizopp found, this makes for duplicate
company names added to the array.  The following code works if i
remove the ORDER BY statement in the SQL query, however for some
reason with it in there it breaks the code.

$result = $db->query("
	SELECT

		c.id as company_id, c.name as company 
	FROM ci2_bizopps b 
	INNER JOIN ci2_companies c ON b.company_id=c.id  
	WHERE b.contract_type=".$type." 
	ORDER BY c.name ASC"
);
$results = $db->fetchAll($result);

$data = "<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100%

$arr = array();

		$data .= "</tr>\n";
		$arr[] = $result['company_id'];
	}
}
$data .= "</table>";
return $data;

as you can see all i did was for each record found, store the company
id into another array, and also use array_search to search the array
to see if that company_id has already been used.  If it has been used,
do nothing otherwise display the data for that company..  I have
printed out the value of company_id and $arr for each item and with
the order by statement, it says the company id is 2 but 2 is also in
the arr 3 times, so i am not sure why array_search is not finding it
in the array and just skipping it.  I guess one way of accomplishing
this is to not use the ORDER BY statement but create yet another
array, add the companies to that which will be displayed and then
sorting the array and then displaying but i think the order by would
be much easier to use if it can be done.

Here are the results shown with the ORDER BY in place
IPRO
PRO NJ Test Data
Romy's Widgets
The British Medicine Group
IPRO
IPRO

And here are the results without the ORDER BY in place
The British Medicine Group
Romy's Widgets
The British Medicine Group
IPRO
PRO NJ Test Data

This is really starting to get to me after working on this for a while
the other day to finally get it working and today just to break it
with an order by statement ;D

Anyone that can help i would greatly appreciate it.

In PHP 5, objects are passed (into and out of functions, etc) and
copied by reference. Everything else (scalars, strings, booleans,
etc.) behave the same and are passed by value.

To make a by-value copy of an object, use the clone operator:

$copy = clone $original;

To control the cloning behavior of a class, define a __clone() method.

More details available in "Upgrading to PHP 5." :)

OH YEA!

I completely did not know about GROUP BY that is amazing, it worked great.
It also allowed for me to rid myself of that sloppy array index and
search code :)
thanks for your help with that ;D

I think the problem may be in the array_search function. Array search  
returns the key of the item found or FALSE (or NULL in older versiosns)  
if it is not found. So what happens when there is a match found at the  
0 element? Since array_search returns 0, your if() statement probably  
evaluates to true (!0), since 0 can also mean false. It's only first  
item that is getting repeated, correct?

Using something stricter may resolve your problem, something like  
testing for boolean:
if(is_bool(array_search($result['company_id'],$arr))) {
}

Or, drop the whole array search and use an associative array.
if( !is_set( $arr[$result['company_id']] ) {
	...
	$arr[$result['company_id']]  = $result['company'];
}

Using an associative array may be quicker than array_search since you  
are referencing the index of the array instead of searching the entire  
array for values. The difference may not be noticeable with only a few  
elements.

I can't say I've done anything with it, but TikiWiki's GalaxiaWorkflow
might be worth checking out.  I've used Openflow (which is what Galaxia
was based on), and if its anything like it you should have a great
workflow framework with a lot of flexibility.

See:
    http://tikiwiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=GalaxiaWorkflow

My votes go for:
    5. array_walk/map - Mmmmm... code reuse.
    4. get/set_include_path - I like manipulating my include path at runtime.
    3. mktime - for its date arithmetic features.
    2. ob_start/get_contents - for caching, code reuse/re-purposing, etc.
    1. debug_backtrace - where have I been?

Yes.  I frequently use it like this:
    List($A['Value1'], $A['Value2'], /*Junk*/ ) = Explode($Some_Delimeter, $Some_String);

I used it today when I had to use SimpleXML / XPath to extract an
attribute from a specific part of an XML file:

list($version) = simplexml_load_string($xml)->xpath('/foo[@bar = "baz"]/@version');

The xpath() method returns an array of items, but I know I'm only
interested in the first (and only) one.

I just now happened to stumble on this doc on a workflow engine in PHP:
    http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/workflow.html
... by way of Harry Feucks post:
    http://www.sitepoint.com/blog-post-view.php?id=206854

Also, of more general interest to NYPHPers is Tony Marston's doc "A
Development Infrastructure for PHP", an excellent piece on MVC in PHP:
    http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/infrastructure.html

Enjoy,
Andrew

Indeed, is there any other one-liner in PHP to snag just the 1st element
of something that returns an array?

reset()
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.reset.php

$firstElement = reset(funcThatReturnsArray());

or array_shift() if you want to remove it from the array too

strtotime() is a favorite here, too.

I have an ongoing debate with my coworkers about whether it's better
to create select menus for month/day/year/hour/minute/ampm on a form,
or to just provide a text box and strtotime() the result.

Being lazy, I incline to the latter. But the conversation goes: 
"Should I use January 1, 2004? Or 1/1/2004? Or Jan. 1, 2004?"
"Yes."
"That's too confusing!"

Check http://hub.org
They have servers in Panama and now in the US too.
The people that run hub are also the same people that run PostgreSQL Inc. 
So, if you need postgreSQL DB that would be a good host. They also support 
MysQL if you use that instead.

In less than 15 minutes I downloaded it, installed it and using the

Seriously, I tried DBDesigner but the reverse engineering mangled a
PostgreSQL database of mine and I ended up labeling it a
'MySQL-mostly' kind of tool.  Anybody else use it on non-MySQL
databases with success?

For starters, it's usually NOT the same price. Virtual servers are usually 
cheaper.

One reason I can think of to go with a VM (virtual machine) is support. I 
want the control of having root access, yet want someone else deal with 
the problems. In my view a good choice for someone with enough experience 
to know many admin functions, but not want to jump heads on into learning 
all the nuances of managing a box. ie a developer with some admin 
experience.

I also think that VMs work best for smaller sites. Anyone with a busy site 
probably is better off with a dedicated server.

Moreover, if you don't choose your web hosting company properly they may 
put too many VMs in a single box which would degrade performance.

That they don't host too many VMs in the box. That they have good response 
time and that you can move up to better plan easily.

I use http://hub.org and am so far very happy.
They are the same people that run PostgreSQL Inc. so if PostgreSQL is your 
DB, they are a good host. They also host Mysql too.

In general I think VMs work great if you have many low traffic, low space 
clients. For busy sites with big disk demands a collocated box probably 
your best choice.

Hello all,

I have been wondering when the SQLite book by Chris Newman is to be
published.

Amazon lists its publish date as October 11, 2004:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/067232685X/qid=1100316119/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-8825405-9563305?v=glance&s=books&n=507846

Bookpool lists its publish date as November, 2004:
http://www.bookpool.com/.x/7mtopise8m/sm/067232685X

Does anyone with insider information know when in fact it will be out?

I am really looking forward to this book.

Thanks,

- Jay

Pass it my way. I'm not very good at make, but I think it has a
lot of potential in administration and documentation.

I ordered SQLite from bookpool several weeks ago along with George's

because Sams says it was released Nov. 9th.

I'm trying to use the PEAR mail module to allow users to upload a file
and send it as an attachment to other users.

It works fine if I specify just one recipient, but if there are
multiple recipients, the mail only goes to the first.

I've tried passing the recipient list as a comma-separated string and
directly as an array (from the multi-select box input), with the same
effect.

Has anyone successfully used this to send mail to multiple recipients?

I should have specified here - no error is returned, the mail just
doesn't show up at the second address. If I use just the second
address, it does go through.

Hi John,

thanks for your note. I think I will order it soon from Amazon or from 
Bookpool. (I think that Adam Trachtenberg's new book has a section on 
creating an address book using SQLite and PHP5, or something like that.)

I could not find the book using Sams's search feature, but I did 
serendipitously come across the specific SQLite page at Sams, which is 
here, for others who may be interested:

http://www.samspublishing.com/title/067232685X

Best regards,

I also want to buy George's advanced PHP programming book; it looks

Well, I'd have to go with mysql_connect() as being the number one
function I've used in nearly every PHP application I've ever written :)

But seriously, it's a tough call to name specific functions, especially
since the most common are language constructs (and technically not
functions).  So, I'll say the most useful function groups:

-- date/time (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.datetime.php)
-- strings (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.strings.php)
-- arrays (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php)
-- error handling/logging
(http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.errorfunc.php)
-- php options and information
(http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.info.php)
-- MySQL (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysql.php)
-- variables (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.var.php)

Hmmm.... I don't think it should be so easy to avoid answering the 
question ;-)

Perhaps we can get Hans to commit if we clarify a bit. Given that many 
core functions are like language constructs, we can take them for 
granted (they exist in most programming languages). But since PHP is 
such a cool language with so many great utility functions, of those 
remaining utlity functions, whcih are the favorites??

So by this reasoning mysql_connect doesn't count (unless there was some 
special set of params or technique of use that made it do something 
especially cool).

I know, right? I mean, I could see naming the *entire* date/time
function group, since there's now the new-fangled date_sunrise() and
date_sunset() functions, in addition to old favorites like idate() and
gmmktime().

But MySQL function group? I would have thought the real action was in
mysqli ... maybe someone needs to update their databases... :-D

dont need to add all that extra code...

i just want to get this HTML email sending to work, i cant seem to get
it to work with my domain email, but when i send to my gmail account
it sends as all plain text for some reason :D

i have also posted my code on hashphp.org for you guys to chew on, i
am using output buffering and i am not sure if that could be causing
this.  I have included all the code from register.php to the
site.class.php for the method's called.

http://hashphp.org/pastebin.php?pid=1318

the $site->end("flush"); and $site->end("clean") just call a method
that does ob_end_flush and ob_end_clean $site->start() just calls
ob_start()

If anyone can help i would really appreciate it, if you need to see
any other code just let me know and i can post it for you to see.

Joseph,

Are you adding the extra spacing around the Content-Type header? I don't
think you are supposed to have any extra newlines in there.

Very often (every time?) it is wiser to start with known good code and 
debug if you have to, instead of starting with unknown good code and 
debugging.

Mabe you don't need to send binary atachments etc, but why not use known 
good mailer code? Is your hard drive almost full?

lol good question... no my drive is not almost full however i am
trying to keep the code on the site limited to code that will be used
for better managing.  I dont want to have a ton of code on the site
that is not being used by the site because then it may confuse another
programmer if i bring them into the project.

I am not sure why this is not working but i will figure it out sooner
or later, maybe it's just something wrong with my localhost not
sending the email's properly i can see that it keeps sending 2 From
headers one i created and one that seems to be created automatically.

I have an entire chapter on SQLite in "Upgrading to PHP 5". In
general, using SQLite in PHP isn't much different from other
databases. The SQLite extension does have the neat feature of allowing
you to create UDFs in PHP. I walk you though a few examples for both
regular and aggregate UDFs.

The book's final chapter also has a "putting it all together" wrap up,
and that's where I write an address book with a SQLite backend and
both web and commandline frontends. (It's not the world's most
advanced address book.)

Also, the SQLite extension only works with SQLite 2.x. If you want to
use SQLite 3.x, I think you can use PDO, but I'm not positive. I
haven't played with it myself.

By the way, the SQLite Chapter of Mr. Trachtenberg's book is available
for free as a pdf directly from O'Reilly:

Of course, for the other chapters, you'll just have to buy the book....

Does anyone know if there is a way to write a query in a v3 engine to do a
query comparing two columns using like?

I would like to count all rows where the last name appears in the company
name.

In sql server a query like this works:

select count(*) from table where company like rtrim(last_name)+'%'

Thanks in advance.

Hi,
In like comparisions you can use '%%%' for wildcard checking
so, for anywhere
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field LIKE '%%%name%%%' 
for right side:
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field LIKE '%%%name' 
and for left
SELECT * FROM table WHERE field LIKE 'name%%%' 

That is one way to do it.

Joel,

Thanks for your help.  I found that mysql treats column names embedded in
strings as a literal.  I could get right hand like to work using:

select * from table where firm like rtrim(last_name)+'%%%'

but couldn't find a syntax that worked for the left hand side.  The problem
was that it was over matching (and yet not returning all rows).

for example this query:

select * from table where firm like '%%%'+rtrim(last_name)+'%%%'

returned about 90% of all rows and clearly was overmatching.


The solution I found which seems to duplicate the the sql server query is :

select count(*)  from nar where locate(rtrim(lcntct),firm)>0;

Thanks again.

Mike

This should work (if you want full substring search).

select count(*) from table where company like concat('%',last_name,'%')

Ophir,

Yup.  Works like a charm.  Funny that the '+' concatentation character
doesn't work the same way.

I think the plus symbol only works as an arithmetic operator to do addition.

Good afternoon ladies and gents,

I can't seem to find how anywhere (been digging through the manual, google,
yahoo, even msn's beta search).  I think someone mentioned this recently,
but I couldn't find the post either.

Is there any way to create methods for a class at runtime?

Ha! Good call.

Doesn't look like there's a very clean and fun way to add a method to a
class though, unfortunately.

Sorry: I am becoming notorious for asking more questions (trolling)
about hosting providers, international outsourcing, databases, and
programming style than strict PHP. But I value all of your opinions
and I have yet another question.

What is everyone's favorite MySQL database navigator program? Or are
you still just loving the MySQL command line client?

 I have used the command line, SQLyog, and Navicat extensively. I've
also seemed to stay away from MySQL Administrator, MySQL Maestro, and
MySQL Control Center, and phpMyAdmin; In case you cared.

Please contact me *off-list* as I fear I maybe be e-castrated for this post.

Message-ID: <BCF799A6B63DD411985D00805F9F9033E0A66F@mail.alexcommgrp.com>

I just ran across mentions of AMD and Intel's implemention of some
protection from buffer overflow attacks:

>From CNET

The security technology, called NX for "no execute," is built into several
"x86" processors from Intel, AMD and Transmeta. The technology is designed
to block vulnerabilities that viruses and worms use to spread, but operating
system support is required for NX to work.

http://ecoustics-cnet.com.com/Linux+gets+trial+'NX'+security+support/2100-73
44_3-5227102.html


More on it here:

http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2239

seems like it isn't perfect yet...


from Anandtech:

This is not to say that NX protection is not a step in the right direction.
In fact, NX/XD is a good first step to locking down the x86 architecture, as
long as it's adopted correctly. OpenBSD and the Execshield projects have
made the largest progress with implementing non-executable writable pages
and other features, if only in software. However, NX does not completely
eliminate buffer overflow exploits, and thus far it has only caused more
problems than it has solved with Windows SP2.

Anyone using this application?

Anyone here have good LDAP - fu?

We have a middle - low tier HR application called AbraHR.  It is not
LDAP-compliant.  It *can* output a .csv file for all 500+ employees with
this information:

p_nickname = (first name)
p_lname =  (last name)
p_busext = (4 digit extension)
_level1 =   (primary department_name (i.e. Horticulture))
_level2 =   (secondary departmental_name (i.e. Groundskeeping))
p_supervis =  (supervisor's name)
p_jobtitle = title 
p_empemail = email

Now, I did an ldif export of my record in the LDAP database:

# Entry 1: cn=Freeman Joshua,ou=People,dc=digir,dc=nybg,dc=org
dn:cn=Freeman Joshua,ou=People,dc=digir,dc=nybg,dc=org

I'd like some idea of how to add information that exists in AbraHR to the
LDAP schema.. If I can add supervisor name and dept. 1, dept. 2 to the LDAP
schema, then I should also be able to use PHP regex (or something...dare I
say 'PERL' on this list?) to convert the .csv file to usable LDIF records
that I can import into the LDAP database.

Any help with this little exercise greatly appreciated.

TIA,

Joshua

I really don't get it. I've never had any trouble scaling pretty much any programming language across multiple servers for the purpose of web apps. It all pretty much comes down to making sure that all app data is stored in a shared database and then load balancing your application servers. If you want to be more effecient with data caching then do something like use XML-RPC between different layers of your application logic and use normal http caching with something like Squid between the layers. The programming language and OS involved are for the most part irrelevant as far as scaling goes. You can even mix and match them without any problem.

I wonder if this is targetted at people/companies that would rather
not have to hassle setting up the servers and infrastructure to
implement what you describe?

"I want my PHP applications to scale massively but I can't afford a
CTO" kind of companies.

I suppose so but in that case why do any in-house development? If you're 
paying for outsourcing your development then they should be able to 
scale your apps as much as you need anyway assuming your willing to pay 
for it. For the most part all you need to do is setup the servers you 
want in the standard way, setup load balancing however your techs like 
to implement it, and setup your caches, webservers, databases, etc as 
normal. Nothing about it is something a reasonably well trained system 
admin couldn't do with ease. The only step the average admin might have 
to put much work into is learning how load balancing is implemented.

	available?
Message-ID: <37575.69.86.84.233.1100818659.spork@webmail.ceruleansky.com>

Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone has used the alpha version of the PEAR Image
Transform library:

http://pear.php.net/package/Image_Transform/

It has no online documentation, but I think I can figure out how to use it
(/ its methods).

It seems to have a lot of useful methods, such as: resize an image
proportionally given either the new width or the new height. For example,
suppose you have a 240 x 320 image (width by height). If you want to
resize the width to 100, what should the height be to keep the image
proportional?

It has "drivers" for various image transformation libraries, such as GD,
ImageMagick, etc.

I was wondering if any of you have other functions / classes that do
similar stuff, since this is supposedly alpha code (with some placeholder
methods).

Thanks,

- Jay

hi there:

i am trying to use the command line PHP on a server which i didn't 
set up.  it's installed at /usr/bin/php, but whenever invoked, i get 
this:

PHP Warning:  Unknown(): Unable to load dynamic library 
'/usr/lib/php4/pgsql.so' - libpq.so.3: cannot open shared object 
file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0


ok...so something wasn't compiled properly...apparently it can't find 
the postgresql library.  i can deal with this later (maybe; i only 
have limited control here).

anyway, this doesn't affect execution of my script, which i have 
tried invoking thusly:

/usr/bin/php -q -d display_startup_errors=0 -d display_errors=0 
/path/to/script.php

it seems like no matter what i do, i can't suppress that PHP Warning 
message, and this is annoying, because the crontab manager is 
emailing me this warning twice every 15 minutes.

anyone know how i can get rid of this temporarily, short of 
installing these Postgresql libraries?

cheers,

If you have access to php.ini, just coment the lines that load that
extension and restart apache.

As long as you are not needing PostgreSQL, that is the obvious choice ;-)

try making your own copy of php.ini and doing:

/usr/bin/php -c /path/to/my/php.ini /path/to/script.php

Strictly for the CLI you shouldn't need to restart apache.


You can also try the -c argument and point to a different configuration
file.

   /usr/bin/php -c ./my_php.ini

Well, I like the ones you mention... for web, phpMyAdmin of course,
although I find it gives erroneous results sometimes, so be careful.
For strict DB control, I like MySQL Administrator.  For more SQL related
things, Navicat and the MySQL Query Browser are nice...

Why?  Although, these types of questions come up often enough, that we

Exactly - work.

People want to roll things out with as little effort as possible, and
the more prepackaging/preconfiguring/pre-thinking has gone into
something, the more people are ready to use it, and especially in the

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PEAR Image Transform Library - similar libraries
	available?
Message-ID: <49351.69.86.84.233.1100887574.spork@webmail.ceruleansky.com>

Hi all,

I think I might have answered my own question. Here is what I found, since
it may be of use to others.

I found a nice image resizing / scaling class by Gregory Brown at
phpclasses.org.

It is freely distributable, so I decided to put it up here for others to
browse:

http://www.ceruleansky.com/code/images/one/

(The link above also is useful if you don't have an account at
phpclasses.org)

I also found some other libraries that do similar image manipulation
things (thumbnails, etc.). If anyone is interested, I could post those
too.

I think I am modify the way this class behaves, but its core functionality
seems to be neat.

- Jay

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Regex & Delimiter Trouble
Message-ID: <27F4B132-3A70-11D9-B866-000A95BE1F8C@cain.sh>

Given this script:

<?php
$pattern = "/^quantity[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$/";
$haystack = "quantity11";
echo (preg_match($haystack, $pattern)) ? 'We got one!': 'DOH!', "\n";
?>

I hope to match quantity1 ... quantity999, but PHP5 on Mac OS X outputs 
the following from the CLI:

Warning: preg_match(): Delimiter must not be alphanumeric or backslash 
in /Users/djcain/regex on line 4
DOH!

I've been trying to get around the issue for quite some time now and I 
think I'm unable to see the forest through the trees :)

The warning seems pretty straightforward but for the life of me I'm 
unable to grasp what it want's for the delimiter.  Anyone out there 
dealt with this issue before, or see the problem that I apparently do 
not?

Use single quotes, the $ is screwing up the regex.

$pattern = '/^quantity[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$/';

I've noticed some dodgy behavior using the ^ and \A patterns in
preg_replace() and didn't put enough effort into the issue (trivial internal
Wiki) to resolve it. I did manage to determine that [\r|\n] apperas to be a
suitable substitute for $.

Message-ID: <8d9a428004111913386d8e3b59@mail.gmail.com>

guys i am having a load of an error here and i cannot track it down

i am running php 4.3.8 on linux and apache 2

now i am trying to submit a form with 2 file upload fields on the
form, i have named the fields name="files[]" and in my code when the
form is submitted i print_r both $_FILES and $HTTP_POST_FILES

now here is my problem, they both return an empty array ???

my php.ini says file_uploads is On and the file sizes are not breaking
the 2mb limit set in the php.ini

this is on my dev server so i cannot post a url to a phpinfo page
since my ISP blocks my web server, so what i have done is ran it
locally and saved the source to an html file and posted it on
http://www.codebowl.com/info.html

if anyone can come up with any reasons as to why this would be
happening i would apprectiate it.  I have been fighting with this for
hours.

here is the code after the form is submitted.

if( isset( $_POST['submit'] ) ) {
	echo '<pre>';
	print_r($HTTP_POST_FILES);
	echo '</pre>';
	echo '<pre>';
	print_r($_FILES);
	echo '</pre>';
}

You also have pattern and haystack reversed in the preg_match call ...

It should be :   preg_match($pattern, $haystack)

Message-ID: <d0cb92620411191341149974e0@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everyone,

I have a client that would like to be able to take uploaded files in
*any* format and convert them to a tiff file before storing them for
later viewing.

When I say ANY file format I mean most printable documents. I.E.

WordPad, MS Word,MS Excell,Text, Unicode,PowerPoint,MS Project,MS
Visio,HTML,PDF,JPEG,GIF,BMP,PNG,Lotus 1-2-3,Xerox,CorellDRAW, etc.

I have found several windows programs that are print driver emulators
that all users to print to the program in order to convert the
document to a TIFF.

There are also some of these programs that come with and SDK  so that
they can be programmed to.

I am wondering if anyone on the list has done something similar to
this using PHP?  Doesn't need to be  free, open source, GPL, or any
thing like that.  Just wanted to check if there was already something
out there before i reinvent the wheel.

Thanks a million!

i am using xampp and in my /opt/lampp/etc/ i do not see a php.conf, i

Looked at Ghostscript? It has filters for turning just about anything 
into a postscript file. Then postscript is easy enough to convert to 
tiff files. I think ImageMagick can do that if Ghostscript can't. You 
could just tap your code into those.

UPDATE:

problem solved, i also learned a very good lesson.  When using XAMPP
and you do not have your temp upload dir set in your php.ini, do not
assume it uses /tmp i was doing this and having loads of problems,
however once i set the dir in php.ini to /tmp it is now working 100%
correctly :D

Assuming a certain php script was the only thing accessing a postgres 
DB.

if I:

  insert into DB;
select from DB to get the current value of a sequence ;

Can I assume I will get the value I'm looking for?
Or might this happen:

insert into DB;
another script instance does an insert;
select brings back second and wrong value for my needs;

  This is really a question of how the PHP engine works, and I am aware 
of different ways of serializing with MySQL, but to my knowledge, those 
methods are not available for Postgres. Enlighten me here as well.

Oh, I do also know this is a great place to create a stored procedure, 
which would atomize it.

Message-ID: <32965.69.86.84.233.1100972547.spork@webmail.ceruleansky.com>

Hi Matt,

In response to your question about getting the last id inserted into a
table (on a per connection basis), these documents may be relevant:

http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2003-08/msg01699.php
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.3/static/functions-sequence.html

I have not used PostgreSQL myself yet, but as far as I can tell, these
documents may help. More specifically, it is the "currval" part you should
be looking at.

An excerpt (from the first link above):

"
Basicly, currval() gives the last id for that sequence in that session. So
other sessions does not break anything.

> The only safe methode would be to do a "select nextval(whatever)", and
> aply this number by "hand" to the insert, but that remove the
> possibility to make general code even more, but it will be safe.

It's not needed. The following works fine (if the tables exists of course)
and has no problems with concurrency:

INSERT INTO foo(id,x) VALUES (DEFAULT, 'value');
INSERT INTO bar(id,foo_ref) VALUES (DEFAULT, currval('foo_id_seq'));
"

As I found out from the new MySQL book from Apress, you can find out the
last inserted id for a particular connection only using the following
technique:

"
When a new AUTO_INCREMENT value has been generated, you can also obtain it
by executing a SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() statement mysql_query() and
retrieving the value from the result set returned by the statement.

For LAST_INSERT_ID(), the most recently generated ID is maintained in the
server on a per-connection basis. It will not be changed by another
client. It will not even be changed if you update another AUTO_INCREMENT
column with a non-magic value (that is, a value that is not NULL and not
0).

If you want to use the ID that was generated for one table and insert it
into a second table, you can use SQL statements like this:

INSERT INTO foo (auto,text)
    VALUES(NULL,'text');              # generate ID by inserting NULL
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text)
    VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');  # use ID in second table
"
(More info on this at:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Getting_unique_ID.html
 )

Hope all that helps and is what you were looking for.

- Jay

One thing you can do is get the value from that sequence, and use it
in your INSERT statement.  That way you won't have to guess ;-)

This is what I wanted to know. If this is safe, all is good. Thanks

I guess the only doubt lingering is whether using a persistent 
connection method from PHP will make a DB think one session is 
happening even though any number of pages might be borrowing the 
connection.

Does anyone know the lowdown on this?

>From what I've seen, there's really only two ways to do this - the
MySQL way (using auto_increment) and the non-MySQL way (using sequence
values).

I always thought the MySQL way was the simplest and easiest to use
from a programmatic perspective, but the more time I worked on web
applications (weblications?) the more I came to appreciate sequences.

When you get the value from a sequence, it immediately increments
itself.  This is also a singular transaction, which ensures that only
you will get that value from the sequence.

With MySQL and auto_increment, there is the possibility for an insert
to happen before you get your value, correct?

Not a dig at MySQL, just wanting clarification on the atomicity of
doing an insert and then getting the last value from the
auto_increment fields...

Is TIFF really the universal file format? I guess it is if you only
want to view the documents, but if you ever want to recover the
content, it's kind of a horrible idea.

I like Michael's Ghostscript idea -- anything that you can print from
Linux can be "printed" to a postscript file. Postscript preserves the
look of the document (like TIFF would) but also allows the text to be
extracted.

The collection of software and the PHP glue to bind it all together
probably doesn't exist yet. But I bet a lot of people on this list
have pieces of it already.  This would be an excellent open-source
project.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PEAR XML-RPC server does not like carriage returns
 (details enclosed)
Message-ID: <46276.69.86.84.233.1101016582.spork@webmail.ceruleansky.com>

Hello everyone,

Some of you may remember my presentation at NYPHP from June of this year
(2004) [ http://www.moztips.com/index.php?id=335 ]. I released the code to
an earlier version of fortune cookies code at moztips.com [
http://www.moztips.com/index.php?id=266 ].

Some people who were using versions of PHP greater than 4.3.5 experienced
errors on the JavaScript side (e.g. "someThing is not a function"). In
reality, these were caused by errors / XML-RPC faults triggerd by the PEAR
XML-RPC server.

I have done a lot of debugging since, and here is what I have found:

The JavaScript XML-RPC client, jsolait  [
http://xmlrpc.kollhof.net/index.xhtml ] sends the following bit of XML as
the initial HTTP request, asking the XML-RPC server which methods it
supports (If this message gets mangled, full details (including PHP code)
are posted online at: http://www.moztips.com/debug2/ ):

POST /xul_lessons/debug2/debugserver.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: PEAR HTTP_Request class ( http://pear.php.net/ )
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: 95

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall>
<methodName>system.listMethods</methodName>
</methodCall>

Then the server replies:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 21 Nov 2004 04:32:09 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.52 (Win32) mod_ssl/2.0.52 OpenSSL/0.9.7c PHP/4.3.9
X-Powered-By: PHP/4.3.9
Content-Length: 360
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!-- DEBUG INFO:

<methodResponse>
<params>
<param>

<value><string>system.methodHelp</string></value>
<value><string>system.methodSignature</string></value>
</data>
</array></value>
</param>
</params>
</methodResponse>

------ ------- --------

But, if the same initial HTTP request is sent with line breaks / carriage
returns after each XML tag, an error is produced.

Here is the request:

POST /xul_lessons/debug2/debugserver.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: PEAR HTTP_Request class ( http://pear.php.net/ )
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: 89

<?xml
version="1.0"?><methodCall><methodName>system.listMethods</methodName></methodCall>

And here is the response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 21 Nov 2004 04:33:18 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.52 (Win32) mod_ssl/2.0.52 OpenSSL/0.9.7c PHP/4.3.9

        <value><string>Unknown method</string></value>
      </member>
    </struct>
  </value>
</fault>
</methodResponse>

------- ------ ------

Does anyone know why this is happening? Incidentally, I tried this at
moztips.com and I was able to reproduce the error. But the thing is, the
NYPHP presentation hosted at moztips.com currently works. So, after all
this debugging, I don't know if I found the right error after all.

Another interesting thing is that the PEAR XML-RPC library, when acting as
a client sends an extra pair of empty "<params></params>" tags along with
intitial request.

Full code, including a test-case debug client and server that logs the
HTTP requests and response is available at:
http://www.moztips.com/debug2/

If anyone can help me with this, I will buy you a drink of your choice at
the next NYPHP talk-dinner!

Thanks in advance,

- Jay

Message-ID: <0I7J004OSBKL5K@mta2.srv.hcvlny.cv.net>

Hi Joseph,

These are all possible options from php.ini that can effect upload.  I
downloaded xampp myself and took them from their php.ini, so doubt you are
having a problem with these, but just putting them in for a sanity check:

memory_limit = 8M
upload_max_filesize = 2M
post_max_size = 8M
file_uploads = On
;upload_tmp_dir = (make sure this is writeable by the User the web server is
running as) 
max_execution_time = 30


Now, pertaining to the LimitRequestBody Directive:

I have Apache 2x on Redhat 9, and I have a /etc/httpd/conf/conf.d directory,
and inside of there I have a php.conf file.  In that file I have this:

<Files *.php>
    SetOutputFilter PHP
    SetInputFilter PHP
    LimitRequestBody 524288
</Files>

I know for certain that if you don't adjust the limitrequestbody attribute,
you won't be able to upload files larger than this number.

On this page:

http://us2.php.net/features.file-upload

A fellow mentions adding this to his *httpd.conf* file.  Make sure to adjust
the number to be larger than your upload.  You'll need to make a block like
this for every extension you want PHP to handle, so if you are having PHP
process .html files, you'll need one that says Files *.html.

Also see here:

http://forums.invisionpower.com/lofiversion/index.php/t115421.html

If it is not this, I'm out of ideas.


Good Luck!

False. MySQL will return the correct value, even if other threads have
inserted new rows between your initial insert and the call to get the
primary key.

Hi all,

I think I found the bug report that might be relevant to the issue I am
describing:

http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=1604

This might be of use to others who want to patch the PEAR XML-RPC library
themselves (or install a renamed, modified one locally to use along with
theirs scripts).

I have a feel though that other bugs are working in collusion with this
one to prevent the jsolait JavaScript XML-RPC client library from working
correctly with the PEAR XML-RPC server library on PHP versions of 4.3.5
and higher.

If anyone has insight into (the nuances and contributing factors to) this
issue, I would greatly appreciate this. (I should probably offer a better
"reward" to the smart PHP developers out there: how about a whole pie of
Brooklyn-made Grandmama's pizza for the first person who has insight into
this one.)

Thanks,

- Jay

PHP Warning:  Unknown(): Unable to load dynamic library

a few people told me to disable postgresql in the php.ini file, but 
after looking through that file, and doing a web search, i can't seem 
to figure out how to do that.  i can see how to change various 
postgresql settings, but not how to disable it entirely.

so, though this seems like a really stupid question, can someone 
enlighten me as to what i need to set in a custom php.ini file?

Did you try simply commenting out the PostgresSQL section???

If anything, it'd be the 'extension' directive in php.ini, although this
still might not make any difference.

If I remember correctly, this still might not work, depending on how it
was compiled.

Run:

ldd /path/to/php/bin/php

and maybe you'll see libpq listed, in which case you'd need to
recompile.  Although, I could also be forgetting something.

And some more stuff:

Yeah, I'm pretty sure they were talking about Windows .dll directives. 

What about compiling your own php binary without pgsql support?

Ideally, we'd find something that we can easily sync up with our existing on-site retail inventory management system (WinRetail from JDS Solutions.. runs on 'doze with MS-SQL on the backend...)


Found OSCommerce and Ext-cart so far... any other recommendations out there folks?

It has to be something fairly 'serious', commercial class.. etc..

Hi, I'm trying to 'normalize' phone numbers that are submitted via a form, 
so that they all appear as xxx-xxx-xxxx. I'm sure there's a more elegant 
way of doing it, but the following seems to work-- almost. But the trim 
part does not actually trim. I'm sure it has something to do with the 
type/case of the content submitted or the quotation marks or something like 
that. If I replace the GetSQL statement with ' (212) 555-1212    ', it 
works fine. I tried dropping the GetSQL and just using the $_Post, tried 
putting single and double quotes, etc. Any ideas? Thanks!

	$phone = GetSQLValueString($_POST['phone'],"text");
	$phone = trim($phone);
	$replace = array (") ","."," ");
	$newphone = str_replace($replace,"-",$phone);
	$newphone = str_replace("(","",$newphone);


This is the GetSQLValueString function that Dreamweaver creates automatically:

function GetSQLValueString($theValue, $theType, $theDefinedValue = "", 
$theNotDefinedValue = "")
{ $theValue = (!get_magic_quotes_gpc()) ? addslashes($theValue) : $theValue;
    switch ($theType) {
     case "text": $theValue = ($theValue != "") ? "'" . $theValue . "'" : 
"NULL"; break;
     case "long":
     case "int": $theValue = ($theValue != "") ? intval($theValue) : 
"NULL"; break;
     case "double": $theValue = ($theValue != "") ? "'" . 
doubleval($theValue) . "'" : "NULL"; break;
     case "date": $theValue = ($theValue != "") ? "'" . $theValue . "'" : 
"NULL"; break;
     case "defined": $theValue = ($theValue != "") ? $theDefinedValue : 
$theNotDefinedValue; break; }
   return $theValue; }

Intershop is commercial class and serious but a fair pain in the ass to
integrate with outside solutions unless cartridges are already made or
customized for you. Possibly in the 30K investment to develop.

Try this link and see if it helps you easily capture the phone number data:
http://benramsey.com/archive/cat/making_it_valid/making_it_valid_telephone_numbers.php

Then, after using the code at that link, just do:
$newphone = $area_code . '-' . $exchange . '-' . $number;

That should do it for you.

That's because it appears they're using FUDforum to power their message

Before I go and reinvent the wheel...

I need to do things like getPreviousBusinessDay() and
getLastBusinessDayofMonth() in a PHP-based dashboard I'm writing.  I
Googled for such code and checked out PEAR but I didn't find anything
appropriate.  Am I missing something or has a PHP programmer never
needed to do a getPreviousBusinessDay() type function before?

Try PEAR::Date There is getNextWeekday() and getPrevWeekday(). To get 
the last business day of the month you may have to combine a few calls 
but there should be enough there to get what you need without having to 
reinvent everything.

How are you defining what a business day is ?
Different businesses have different holidays :)

I always read that I should store includes and any other files that may 
contain information like the database connection outside of the root 
directory of the web site, which makes perfect sense.

But what should I do if I don't have access outside of httpdocs, or 
can't include a file from another directory such as, say, cgi-bin?

Just assume everyone works everyday. Isn't that the case?

Burt really, the best you could probably do is plug standards like Jan 
1 or have a  human resource person enter all holidays for that year 
into a form and exclude those as well as weekends.

In other words getlastBusinessDay() that is not  01-01 or not 12-25 etc.

No?

Please put my Birthday in there too :)

Even in development, errors dumped to the browser can be bad because 
they can become hidden in the HTML.

What does that mean? Hidden from the developer's view? Certainly not 
hidden in the code?

You could do what Cold Fusion does, which is spit out a huge list of closing

I don't think you want errors appearing at all though I'm often 
surprised how many times I've seen Cold Fusion sites display all their 
errors (and path info, etc.) right there for the world to see.

The warning about sending errors to the browser (at least during 
development) is not that it's the worst thing in the world but that 
there are times when an error message could have some characters that 
won't display properly in a browser but, of course, you can read just 
fine in a log file.

I think -- perhaps -- it means the error output sometimes gets tangled up
with HTML form elements in such a way that you can't see it in the
browser, so you're wondering WTF, and you have to look at the HTML source
to figure it out.

This problem is so strange I'm not even sure how to describe it. I've
been using Firefox (and its previous incarnations) for quite some time.
Then I encountered the following problem. Firefox has become completely
unusable. I'm not sure if this is a Firefox issue or a WinXP issue 
though the problems described below have only affected Firefox and all 
of my other applications are working correctly. Here are some examples 
of the problems I've encountered.

a) On startup the default 'home' page does not appear though I can 
right-click on the page and view the html source.
b) I can not type anything into the address box nor the Google search box.
c) The menus are inaccessible through either the mouse or keyboard. In 
fact, Firefox does not respond to any keyboard commands.

I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. No luck.

Any clues?

What version of Firefox are you running?

Have you tried starting Firefox in safe mode?

Also, there may be issues with your profile, you could try starting 
Firefox in profile manager mode and creating a new profile.

Hey Guys,

Recently I had the pleasure of reading "Advanced PHP Programming" by
George Schlossnagle.  (thanks george.. great book!) It really helped
me learn how to develop in PHP at more of an enterprise level.

I was wondering if anyone could recommend a similar book for J2EE web
development.  I am a newbie to the world of java.  Short of a few
classes in college, I have little experience.  I understand the syntax
and how to use java.sun.com so I have somewhere to start from.

I have a project coming up where I will need to use java.  I want to
be able to correctly design and implement this web application using
Java.  I don't want to hack my way through it as a PHP programmer.

Recommendations Anyone??

Tom,

I would recommend that you take a look at the Struts framework from 
Apache.   It will take a bit of upfront work to understand the value that 
this will provide, but it's better to pick up now than halfway through the 
project when you need to deal with file uploads and form validation.  :)

As it's an implementation of the MVC pattern, you'll be able to bring a 
lot of concepts back to your work with PHP as well.

http://struts.apache.org/

The user guide is a great place to get familiar with the technologies and 
concepts involved:
http://struts.apache.org/userGuide/

As for a book recommendation, I'd go with:
Pro Jakarta Struts, Second Edition
by John Carnell, Rob Harrop

It's not the highest rated book at Amazon, but I found it useful.

>From O'Reilly, there's also:
Programming Jakarta Struts
by Chuck Cavaness


Good luck,
-Dan

Dan's suggestion is a good one.  I have had this problem in the past
with both Mozilla & Firefox.  It happened to me because of incompatible
extensions that buggered things up to the point that the browser was
useless.  Creating a clean profile will do the trick hopefully - unless
you've installed these extensions system-wide, however, an full
uninstall / reinstall should fix that.  If there is stuff in your
profile you don't want to lose or transfer, it is possible to manually
remove these extensions from your profile by editing various XML files
in your profile dir, though that can be a pain.

HTH,
Andrew

Hmmn, you may have the wrong list -- 
however you might find the 'blueprints' 
section at the Sun site to be useful.
(particularly:
http://java.sun.com/blueprints/patterns/index.html )

But I would also suggest reading 
http://peteryared.blogspot.com/2003/09/next-language.html 
to see why a scripting language like PHP may 
be better suited to the development environment of 
the future..

Instead of the basic struts, you should look at appfuse, which is a
solid integration of several basic framework packages, which grew out
of integrating struts with other frameworks (hibernate, spring,
etc...) . It is the best introduction to enterprise java I've seen so
far.

Thanks Dan and Andrew. I went into profile mode ("C:\Program 
Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -P) and that seems to have done the 
trick. Boy...that was REAL STRANGE!! I've had extensions do funky things 
but this was the strangest I had seen.

For many reasons, I would advise him not to host with his his domain 
registrar. It is wise to keep those two business relationships separate 
and independent.
(quick example: if a spam report comes into your registrar, true or not, 
your website can be taken down in accordance with the registar's TOS 
--if they can do that. It has "allegedly" happened more than once 
recently with the registrar whos name begins with the opposite of alto 
and ends with the compliment to madre. Best to keep the keys to the 
kingdom in separate hands IMHO)

I host a few smaller sites at www.nearlyfreespeech.net

I like them because they have always struck me as very honest people, 
and surprisingly un-bottom-line orientated. You pay for the hard drive 
space and bandwidth you use, and thats about it. ($0.02/day for hosting 
a domain, $0.01/month/megabyte for storage, $1.00/gigabyte for bandwidth)

Strong caveat is that you really do have to know what you're doing. 
Their control panel is sometimes confusing. There is no support for "my 
script doesn't work" and so on and so forth.

Message-ID: <20041130114537.GB1253@leitz.earthlink.net>

Trying to drink less coffee in the morning, not sure it's wise to post.  :)

I'm trying to write an entry form that lets people enter future dates for an event. Most events are 1-4 days in length, which means they may start in one month and end in another. This form will submit to a MySQL databse, and another page will pull out the event information with start and end dates.

So if I'm going to have an event on 15 January 2005, and my event will last 4 days, the web page that shows my event will say:

	leam's Event, 15-18 Jan 2005

Of course, if my events begins on 30 Jan and goes for 4 days, it should put 31 Jan-2Feb 2005. I think I can make the Month and Year check itself and not print if they're the same. What I don't yet know is the best way to let a user input the date. The first thought that comes to mind is an html selection for each thing, "day" with 31 options, "month" with 12, etc. Ideally the form will be used outside the US so the whole issue of how to spell months and what order things go in has already cropped up. I don't have any translators so everything will be in english. 

Any suggestions?

ciao!

p.s. For once I'm not in a rush. I've set no promised date for this so I have time to think it through. If there's a function or web page I should read, point me to it!

My advice is KISS, Leam...
Create both a start date and end date input rather than fight with leap
days, long months, time zones, and other holiday weirdnesses (relgious /and/
federal). That's how I approach it here. Admittedly, I have to have a
resolution of minutes, and not days, because I track sessions within events
as well as the event dates.

Besides, given half a chance, the user will put in the wrong number of days
a certain percentage of the time, rendering your calculations null (and of
course since this is PHP, only null, not void ;) ) Meeting planners are not
the brightest apples in the barrel.

Other considerations in this thread aside, I like to provide a single
text field for each of start date and end date, then use strtotime()
on the input.

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php

This only works for applications where you know the input is generally
going to be good (intranets, selfnets), but it's a lot quicker to fill
out a text field than it is to dial up a date from pulldown menus.

I actually find that a "pop up" type calendar for dates is the best solution.
See expedia.com for an example of what I mean. This is especially true
when the user might not remember the exact dates without looking at a
calendar.

I've found pop-up calendars to be the 'best' (by client accolade) in my
experience as well.  Usually with dropdowns or a text field in a noscript
tag.  

Also note that expedia's popup is NOT cross-browser, thought their
workaround works ok.

Message-ID: <28271-19718@sneakemail.com>

Sorry this isn't really about php code, but I am working at a conceptual
level here.. and since you said you have free time on your hands, mabe
you'll enjoy experimenting :-) I worked with some programmers on
events-based databases a few times, and have programmed my own in numerical
C and a small one in PHP. I am not a professional programmer, and I get
very annoyed very easily when dealing with the nuances of date/time as
implemented by MySQL or another not-really-standard system.

The event data really is start TIME and DURATION (plus venueID, title,
etc). After that, you have data redundancy (end date is just start time +
duration, second day is just start time - time of day plus 24 hours, etc).
In actuality, START TIME is realy just OFFSET FROM BASELINE too pick your
baseline.. Julian zero, etc).

The math associated with scheduling is done with matrices (linear algebra,
or matrix math). That is very, very fast, and allows you to do clever
things to get what you want. So I like to store start START TIME and
DURATION, and if I want to store derivitives I can certainly do that for
practical reasons, but I need to handle them as I would any non-normalized
data. Any serious scheduling math will be done on the time matrix which
only includes ON or OFF for time segements in the time space (if you
resolve to theminute, then minutes are ON or OFF). Make the segments any
size you like for flexibility, and re-segment anytme you like for utility,
down to your preset max resolution/smallest increment (usually minutes).

The user input should be as friendly as possible -- that's a UI job. For
functionality, the system can provide the UI with a mask on the absolute
time frame defined by START TIME and END=START+DURATION. 

So an event is Dec 1 - Dec 4 2004. Really it is Dec 1 8am tru Dec 4 4pm,
and that means *really* it is START 12/1/04 09:00 DURATION 103 hours. For
minute segments, that's 6180 minutes.

So the user blocks out 12/2/04 9-10 am via your UI, and the system assigns
minutes 1440 - 1500 (one hour) to that "event".

You may be surprised at how flexible your back end becomes if you work with
the data in this manner, and abstract it to the UI for appearances and
utility for the user. Wanna change the event to another month? Update the
START TIME. Wanna look for the least-booked 2 hour slot to plan an ad-hoc
session? Search for a local minimum for offset from start as ordinate, and
some sort of attendance estimate on the abscissa. Want to reschedule
concurrent sessions to better accommodate the demand for a popular sesson?
Same story... "slide" a bock representing session duration on X vs.
estimated attendance on Y along a similar time/estimatedattendance scale
for the entire event sans that session, adding the Y values together
("slide along" and "add" etc are basic linear algebra operations, simply
expressed via matrix operations and super fast). Then seek a minimum.

Want a plot of hallway activity? You can get clever taking derivitives
(very fast algo) of the time/atendance blocks on that same scale... dy/dt
spikes at the edges/transitions between sessions, proportional to
attendance. Smooth it via a window function and you get an interesting
approxmation of hallway traffic -- perhaps that helps schedule housekeeping
visits, vendor breaks, etc. I hope you get the idea....

Not everybody will do their back end calculations with numerical algos, or
get excited about the possibilities for data analysis like this, but when
things get complex that is what the engine is doing anyway (or trying to
do). 

If you get comfortable separating data from presentation, and abstracting
to the UI for utility, abstracting to the DB for platform independence,
etc..  then you might appreciate the gains from further separating EVENT
ATTRIBUTES from the data/time constraints of MySQL/PHP or whatever as well.

This came up a few months back and I can't seem to locate the thread in
the archives (It seems that when you google "whatever
site:lists.nyphp.org" you strike out no matter what 'whatever' is. But I
digress...)

Suppose you don't mind restarting Apache to switch between 4 and 5. Is
there any reason why one couldn't install php5 in something like
/usr/local/php5 and write a second httpd.conf to work with it, then maybe
write a shell script for restarting using the appropriate config?

I've read Adam Trachtenberg's recipes for setting up PHP 5 as a CGI and
using it alongside PHP4. (Great book that "Upgrading to PHP 5", btw, thank
you Adam). Makes sense. There was also another recipe proposed by G.
Schlossnagle on this list -- one of the posts I can't seem to find -- that
involved mod_proxy and so on, which I'd love to have another look at if
someone could point the way. But I was wondering about the scenario
described above.

Thanks,

I would get "The C Progamming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie if I were
in your shoes. Indeed I might be, when I decide to give it a shot myself

I have both 4 and 5 installed on a few boxes. Switching between them
is a matter of changing which libphp is commented-out in httpd.conf,
and restarting apache.

The only place where you have to be careful is with the CLI php -- it
will get overwritten on make install. Causes trouble if you have
command line scripts that care which version you are using.

You can always compile php4 --disable-cli to eliminate the problem.

ive actually had a terrible time printing from firefox/mozilla off a 
network'd printer recently and it has been sucking up memory like no 
tomorrow.

i recently caught the glimpse of a headline saying 1.0 was deemed pretty 
unstable compared to release candidate builds so i went back and found 
an old download and its been holding up.  im also on xp so i think its 
possibly bill is creeping into automatic updates to make sure he tames 
the beast :-)

Your best bet is to look @ the Tomcat project ...

http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/

If you take a weekend or two tinkering around w/ it you get a pretty 
good headstart for commercial builds like dynamo,websphere,weblogic,etc.

5.5 is suppose to be top notch and a great educational platform. (ie how 
to do things right :-)
