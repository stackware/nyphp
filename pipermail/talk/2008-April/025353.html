Andr&#233;:

I'm not saying that he shouldn't answered the 
question as you intended, but let's stop and 
examine this incident -- your question was:

7) a and b are variables.

    a = 10
    b = 20
    a = b

    The new values of a and b are, respectively:

And his answer was:

    a= 0.5, b=1

Now, if you were looking at these relationships 
as ratios, such as a:10, b:20, then what would be 
the ratio of a:b ? His answer 0.5:1 would have 
been correct.

I suspect that you confused the issue by using 
the word &quot;respectively&quot;. After all, that word 
really didn't add anything to the question except 
to add a bit of doubt as to what the question 
actually meant. Using the word &quot;respectively 
means with respect to each other and thus one 
could interpret that as a ratio question. As 
such, his answer would have been correct.

If you had been testing for grammar, then he 
could have corrected that for you for bonus 
points.

I've seen a lot of trick questions in my day and 
that word would have raised a red flag for me. Of 
course, I would have still answered the question 
the way you wanted -- but I would have never let 
on that your question showed more about you than 
me.

If it had turned out to be a trick question, then 
I could have defended my answer well enough. But, 
I have found myself in positions before where the 
people who wrote the test knew absolutely nothing 
about the subject and in those cases no one wins 
except the dumbest -- try taking a civil service 
exam sometime and you'll understand.

That's the problem with writing test -- not only 
do you have to know what you are asking; but how 
specific and clear the question is; what should 
the answer be (acceptable range); and most 
importantly why you are asking it. What value 
does answering your question your way bring to 
the table? After all, you might be wrong.

I applied for a position with a company and after 
reviewing my resume they required me to take a 
math fraction test. I asked them if they had 
noticed my education (MSc) on my resume which 
required math skills far exceeding fractions 
(i.e., vector calculus, matrix theory, digital 
processing).  They replied &quot;Yes, but we still 
want you to take the test.&quot; I declined and we 
parted company. So, what purpose did that test 
serve?

In short, test generally suck as a measure of 
anything more than common ignorance.

Cheers,

tedd
