<PRE>on 2008-04-14 15:37 Jake McGraw said the following:
&gt;<i> I wasn't out to dissuade anyone from utilizing some kind of pseudo
</I>&gt;<i> code testing, I'm just trying to offer an alternative point of view,
</I>&gt;<i> the receiving end of interviews (interviewee if you will).
</I>
Certainly your viewpoint is valid, and valued.

&gt;<i> In my, admittedly limited experience, I've found company interviews
</I>&gt;<i> that start, contain, or end with, &quot;Hi! Here's a computer / piece of
</I>&gt;<i> paper, you'll have 45 minutes to complete this exercise consisting
</I>&gt;<i> almost entirely of php.net/[insert function name here]&quot;, represents a
</I>&gt;<i> company on the path to fail, one which I ended up in because I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> know any better, two I rejected offers from.
</I>
Yes, well, that's NOT what we're talking about. But those companies do 
exist, and it behooves you to understand what they're thinking. And also 
consider the whole fizzbuzz 
(<A HREF="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html</A>) problem.

&gt;<i> Here's my point of view: if you (as a recruiter) can come up with
</I>&gt;<i> nothing better than a rehash of references and a test of memorization
</I>&gt;<i> as the gateway for a new hire, then what kind of quality can I expect
</I>&gt;<i> in the rest of the company? Just as everyone here is putting the
</I>
Well, gee, it could be that the HR guy is somewhat divorced from the 
actual development team; or that he's the first gateway in; or that he's 
a recruiter from a firm and not the actual principal at all, and uses 
the results for many of his clients!

&gt;<i> emphasis on finding the right candidate, weeding out the weak ones,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to offer the idea that maybe each candidate is trying to find
</I>&gt;<i> the right company, and that puts you (the interviewer) on the spot.
</I>
That's all well and good from both sides: if you wouldn't like it here, 
it's far more likely you'll spend your time looking for your next 
position. I always open the floor to questions from the interviewee; 
what he/she *asks* us is often about as enlightening as how he/she 
answers us.

&gt;<i> I'm not trying to leave you with the impression that Millennials are
</I>&gt;<i> ingrates (compared to what, Gen-Xers?), but that there are many
</I>&gt;<i> options available to us, applying for a job is trivial thanks to the
</I>&gt;<i> internet/head hunters, and supply (of us) is limited. I think that you
</I>
In fact, the triviality of application is a sword that cuts both ways: 
because of it, people have had to develop these semi-automated methods 
of separating wheat from chaff because so many people use scattershot 
methods of applying for positions, rather than apply for something 
appropriate.

&gt;<i> would be doing your company a disservice if you didn't consider this
</I>&gt;<i> before giving a candidate a test that makes them reconsider their
</I>&gt;<i> choice to apply (or even showup) by insulting their intelligence.
</I>
I, personally, have told recruiters and/or hiring managers: &quot;I don't 
take written tests&quot; when I applied for positions. At that time, at my 
stage in life, if I wasn't talking to a principal, or my CV didn't stand 
on its own, I could pass on the job. That was my decision, and I'm sure 
that I missed out on a few good opportunities. Maybe I was just being a 
prima donna. However, I paid my dues a few times, and I've got the 
references to back myself up, so I can take that chance.

**HOWEVER**, were I applying for some entry-level position, I'd expect 
to be tested on the basics, perhaps *even with a rudimentary written 
test*, and that any company that DIDN'T was showing lack of due 
diligence (read: malfeasance). The industry is rife with these stories: 
dailywtf posts them almost daily (&quot;Tales from the Interview&quot;), 
_Peopleware_ devotes a whole chapter to it (&quot;Audition&quot;).

The written test that Andr&#233; originally posted was flawed in 
implementation, but totally sound in theory. It merely needed refining 
(and maybe not even that much). Remember: it is meant as a very very 
gross filter, just to totally weed out the completely incompetent who 
make it past your HR department or cursory scan at a CV.

I said it before and I'll reiterate it: yes, doing this kind of 
pre-testing might make me miss out on hiring the next RMS or Joel 
Spolsky, but I have to weigh that against other very compelling needs 
(like if I spend two days interviewing only 5 candidates, I have lots 
two days of other work that I need to do for clients, etc.).

p.s. top-posting is nasty.
