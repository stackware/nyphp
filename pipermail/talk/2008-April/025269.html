<PRE>Here's another thought I wonder about encryption technology. Could one day
encryption technology replace the need for firewalls - either partially or
all together. Forget about those security policies, is my firewall
configured right, applying security patches &amp; hardening the OS, etc... If
one can just encrypt there entire drive or the data needed to be protected
by encryption - Why need a fw if the data is garbled and useless to those
who can't decrypt it. Of course fw plays other roles but from a pure
&quot;protect my data from the unwanted&quot; to me encryption may solve that. Just a
thought!

&gt;<i> Wow, I really appreciate the feedback and some of the many comments i am

</I>&gt;<i> hosting provider.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My thought is if encryption techniques like TrueCrypt works - Why not use
</I>&gt;<i> it regardless who is your hosting provider. Or, having to consider questions
</I>&gt;<i> like who you trying to protect data from. I mean, when you buy a nice bran
</I>&gt;<i> new expensive car you have a key to lock the doors and some go further to
</I>&gt;<i> put in a car alarm or car tracking device. Who you're trying to prevent from
</I>&gt;<i> stealing your car is no brainer question to consider - IMO. One knows that
</I>&gt;<i> locking the door and/or having a car alarm is a deterrent - Though not 100%
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed. Maybe my example is not the best but just trying to raise a
</I>&gt;<i> point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my question to deploy some encryption on my data would (help) minimize
</I>&gt;<i> people stealing private data - Why not use it, especially if there's not
</I>&gt;<i> much performance penalty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> David, regarding you comments below:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So are you worried about encryption during uploading or about encryption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while executing the scripts on the server and serving up content - or both?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What other security measures did you include?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You've hit the right questions I am looking to understand. The answer is
</I>&gt;<i> both. From what I understand about a tool like TrueCrypt I can encrypt say
</I>&gt;<i> my webfolder (web site) and upload it to my hosting provider. And, what I am
</I>&gt;<i> trying to understand is can the encrypted data remain encrypted and still
</I>&gt;<i> serve content. Or, once I upload the encrypted data must I need to decrypt
</I>&gt;<i> it to serve the content? I am not concern about data being encrypted out to
</I>&gt;<i> the users browser. SSL takes care of that - right? So, if it is that I can
</I>&gt;<i> encrypt and it remains encrypt while serving content then this is not a bad
</I>&gt;<i> solution. And, of course one can take other measures like ssh to the server
</I>&gt;<i> to actually keep access to it secure.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    Well, you could wrap everything into PHP and use one of these PHP

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Well, I am not much of a php/programmer and don't know how and what it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; means to &quot;wrap everything into php&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I mean that you need to use PHP to output static page content if you

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Still, I wonder why you want to do that? Do you distrust your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    hosting company that much? In that case I'd look for a different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    provider.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Well, I am just looking into a solutions to encrypt data. The question
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; as to why I would want to do that is not the question - But, thanks for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; asking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, the reason for me asking is that there may be a better approach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than taking the big hammer. I speak from experience as I often use(d) the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; big hammer and everything was a nail.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     What are you trying to protect and who are you protecting it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; against?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm looking to protect data/information that could be the software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; code and/or customer's client info.. Protection should be from anyone who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; does not need to have access to the website data or the DB... Of course,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; data will be shown to users (web client) who has been given access to view
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this data from the application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So who is your hoster? Every thought about self-hosting or having the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; customer run the server? Any chance that this might work via intranet rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than internet, because then you probably want to add SSL to the pages. I do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not know if that is difficult to do. But keep in mind, anything that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accessible via internet is not what I'd consider entirely secure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see why you need to protect the software code. PHP is server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side only and the client doesn't see anything from your PHP code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And yes, it is assumed that legitimate users are allowed to see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information, otherwise the whole setup would be quite pointless.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  What I am interested in is to find the most effective and most secure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; way to upload my website &amp; db to remote host and the data is fully protected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; by encryption.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As mentioned above, hosting something offsite and have it be available
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through the internet is IMHO not secure. Taking stuff can be made more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult, but most secure....well, I leave that up to the experts, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have my doubts - see Hannaford, TJX, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I will look into the ionCube suggested earlier - Though this seems to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be a PHP only base solution. From what I gather, a product like TrueCrypt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; could be better as I can encrypt an entire volume or folder and it's done -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Regardless of type of code or application that exist or being encrypted.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, comes down to the hosting service that you have. Do you have that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much access and rights to the server that you can just go ahead and run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; services that encrypt and decrypt entire folders?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I know many software type companies package there software where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; either partially or fully the code is encrypted and protected. This is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; similar type of solution I guess I am looking for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nah, most companies distribute binaries that make it difficult enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for people like me to re-engineer the code. But look at the open source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security applications. Their code is freely available. Security through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; obscurity is one of the worst approaches.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't want to rain on your parade, but taking into account that you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are &quot;not much of a php/programmer&quot; you may want to take a step back and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think this over if that application is indeed that critical and demands such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; secrecy that code and database have to be encrypted. I play around with PHP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for about five years now and I don't think that I'd be capable of writing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; secure application. I'm not saying that you are not capable of that, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have the impression that you think slapping some encryption onto something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes it secure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am also wondering a bit about your statement that you want &quot;to find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the most effective and most secure way to upload my website &amp; db to remote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; host&quot;. So are you worried about encryption during uploading or about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encryption while executing the scripts on the server and serving up content
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - or both? What other security measures did you include? Kaptchas? Multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time-limited passwords? Multiple access levels? Effective session management
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to kick people out of the system after a few minutes of inactivity? Or even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other means such as biometrics as identification? Your own certificate?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, does it have to be a web client? I'd guess there are way more and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way better means to encrypt data when working with fat clients. Also, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; database engine do you plan to use? Does that database engine have means to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encrypt entire tables or data sets?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And what do you do for client security? There is not much gained when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your server is like Fort Knox, but the users can access the application from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any client on any network and then do so from theit favourite internet cafe,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leaving the PC unattended while getting another beer. So you want to at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; least restrict the IP address (ranges) that are allowed to get even to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; login page.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry for asking that many questions, but I think those and many more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; questions need to be asked and sufficiently answered.
