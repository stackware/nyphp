<PRE>David, I have to say, I do plan on returning to school at one point for 
my Ph.D...but it won't be in CS or any &quot;vocational&quot; field.   I have 
several things in mind but they're all extremely impractical. :)

The only &quot;vocational&quot; type of education I can see myself getting is a 
law degree if I ever, in the years I have left, do decide to pursue 
that...but we'll see how this programming thing pans out!

Also -- re our classes:  We had geometry and algebra and chemistry and 
bio --  but the calculus and physics were &quot;for the boys&quot;. LOL!
I guess they were very afraid we'd start burning our bras and building 
nuclear weapons in our kitchens??
