<PRE>me = 24 year old with 20 months experience

1 year 1 month - Crap job outta college (very sketchy lead generating company)
7 months - Two man start up (I was the only developer)
Current gig at a small (50 employees), tech company.

&gt;<i>  2 years of experience on a r&#233;sum&#233; doesn't really translate into that much,
</I>&gt;<i> and two years of experience might really have been two times one year of
</I>&gt;<i> experience, and the person might have been pigeonholed into one small area,
</I>&gt;<i> or only have been using do-everything-for-you tools...
</I>
I think I've learned an incredibly large amount in the last 20 months,
especially at the start up. During that time I was responsible for
everything front and back, on a very tight deadline. The experience
was incredible and really pushed me to better myself once it became
clear that I had sole responsibility for every technical detail ala
&quot;Somethings broken on the website? It's Jake's fault!&quot;.

So, though I ::barely:: meet the criteria of a developer with 2 years
experience, it would appear I'm grossly overqualified for the position
based on the exam. Yes, I was able to answer all of the questions, but
had I been given the exam, I would have immediately recognized that
this is not the gig for me.

Maybe I'm not in the norm, but I think it's important that you don't
just hire people because they meet certain preset criteria. Look for
developers that have a passion for technology and take the time to
fully explore not just the how of a given language, api or toolkit,
but also ask why it was done a certain way. Ask them about their
hobbies at home, what interests them (personally I like toying around
with a Debian install on my NSLU2), I think you'll learn a lot more
about a person's talents when you find out what they do in their free
time and what interests them.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd only keep the last two questions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 9) Why use Flash in web development? Why not?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10) Why is &quot;separation of style and content&quot; recommended in web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Having been on the interviewer side of the desk many many times --
</I>&gt;<i> interviewing well over 100 people for operations, development, and other
</I>&gt;<i> positions -- I have to respectfully disagree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2 years of experience on a r&#233;sum&#233; doesn't really translate into that much,

</I>&gt;<i> or only have been using do-everything-for-you tools...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I have found that many people do NOT gain much general exposure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Nonetheless, these last two questions are good, and should be included as
</I>&gt;<i> well to allow candidates to show their stuff since they're open-ended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the other questions would be incredibly ineffective in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; determining the abilities of a possible employee. All of them could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; picked up in a matter of hours, while the knowledge and experience
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  And yet, you'd like to know that someone you're hiring with &quot;several years'
</I>&gt;<i> experience&quot; doesn't have to learn his ABCs and 123s also.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If this were a ten-year veteran, I'd still want some few basic-skill
</I>&gt;<i> questions, to make sure that he's still in touch, but obviously I'd want to
</I>&gt;<i> know more about more advanced things; more strategy than tactics, as it
</I>&gt;<i> were.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required to answer the last two questions is a far better indicator of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of a talented developer. Also, an inability to answer any one of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CSS questions wouldn't necessarily be an indication of lack of talent,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it took me quite a few months to stop checking my CSS cheat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sheet before I memorized Top Right Bottom Left!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I don't believe that any test of this nature should be strictly
</I>&gt;<i> disqualifying; anyone who uses these blindly (like giving them to an HR
</I>&gt;<i> person and saying &quot;ditch below 70%&quot; automatically) doesn't do himself as
</I>&gt;<i> much good. If you're accustomed to reading r&#233;sum&#233;s, and you're doing phone
</I>&gt;<i> interviews (<A HREF="http://www.jbaltz.com/weblog/2006/10/phone_screens_redux_1.html">http://www.jbaltz.com/weblog/2006/10/phone_screens_redux_1.html</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> (in fact, using this type of quiz as part of a phone screen!) you'd be able
</I>&gt;<i> to winnow out the clowns much earlier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any webmaster/developer with two REAL (full time tech company) years
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of experience would be able to have a much more in depth conversation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about web design philosophy, best practices and commonly accepted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I think you put too much faith in time-in-grade. To those of us with more
</I>&gt;<i> than a decade of experience doing the same thing, two years just isn't that
</I>&gt;<i> much :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  That isn't to say that the questions originally posted aren't a bit
</I>&gt;<i> picayune, only that the idea of a basic-skills test for lower-level (1-3
</I>&gt;<i> years experience) is actually a sound one. &quot;I'd just google it&quot; means that
</I>&gt;<i> the candidate just doesn't have THAT much experience in actually *doing* it.
</I>&gt;<i> (Lord knows that I don't run to google for every little lookup, I've got
</I>&gt;<i> sites I already know and have at my fingertips for mundane tasks, like
</I>&gt;<i> oddball CSS recipes.)
