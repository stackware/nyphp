</I>I certainly agree that there are times to get together around a 
table/whiteboard.  But unless you've got some kind of intensive &quot;agile&quot; 
thing going on (and working), 20% of the time in the office should be 
more than enough, most of the time, anyway.

I collaborate regularly with several other developers and it's really 
quite amazing what you can do with email, skype , and/or a conference 
bridge on the PBX.
&gt;<i> Personally, I'd rather allocate the money I would need to spend on such a setup back into developer salaries, call me crazy. Not to mention that some of the more socially capable developers actually enjoy getting out of the house :-)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I do enjoy my office days, like I said, I'm trying to get down there at 
least twice a week for a full day of work. 

As for the money, I don't get it.  The overhead on an internet 
connection is less than having to give your dev an office.  I've got a 
little cube when I'm on-site, and it's not too bad, but there are only 
three others in the room.  But once the talking or fixing little things 
is over and it's time to get back to building something non-trivial, I 
wouldn't be able to do my job without an office with a door that 
closes.  Or I can just stay home, where I have just that.
&gt;<i> And just to keep the &quot;how behind the times are you&quot; comments at bay, every time I've visited Google in Mountainview, Cisco in San Jose, Citrix in Ft Lauderdale, or Microsoft in Redmond, the offices were packed with staff. Cavemen, huh?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Most programmers are working for business in industries other than 
software.  If you're doing large-scale application development over a 
range of products involving massive numbers of people, I can see why 
you'd want most everyone on-site.  If you're dealing with less than a 
dozen developers, like 90% of everyone (Yes, I'm pulling that number out 
of the air), telecommuting should be a perfectly manageable and often 
advantageous option.
