<PRE>Hey David Krings,

Thanks for the awesome, sometimes passionate, responses!

&gt;<i> I'd pass it and I think I'd be the worst webmaster you ever had.
</I>
The test is non eliminatory, and is not the sole factor being 
considered.  It's just a basic test...
Why do you say you'd be the worst webmaster we ever had? We've had 
*terrible* webmasters in the past! You'd have your work cut out for you! lol

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd rather ask the candidate where they'd look that up in case they 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know. I'd expect that they mention one of the leading XHTML 
</I>&gt;<i> references. The answers to these questions can be answered by someone 
</I>&gt;<i> who is often broed and looks at the source of web pages in notepad.
</I>
&quot;often bored and looks at the source of web pages in notepad&quot;
Great! This is exactly who we want to hire! I'm adding this to the job 
description... ;)

&gt;<i> anyone who seriously wants to design pages is likely to use a design 
</I>&gt;<i> tool that comes with a decent CSS editor. 
</I>
Sorry, David Krings, but this is not true. 
Many times you won't have access to a wysiwyg tool.  You may not even 
have access to X (i.e. bash via ssh), and still need to perform work.
What would you do in that situation?


&gt;<i> That is something I'd trust a piece of software to do it correctly.
</I>
lol :-D  +1funny!

&gt;<i> That depends, in PHP you'd get a syntax error right in the first line 
</I>&gt;<i> and both a and b remain undefined. 
</I>
Do you think you could make sense of it and answer it correctly 
nevertheless, though? It's not meant to be PHP specific...

&gt;<i> Some months ago we had a very lively discussion about how to hire a 
</I>&gt;<i> PHP developer. You may want to look through the list archives. I think 
</I>&gt;<i> we agreed in the end that this question is pointless. 
</I>
Sorry I missed that. I will look into it. Thanks.

&gt;<i> I also wonder if you are looking for a web master who runs and 
</I>&gt;<i> configures your servers or if you are looking for a web developer who 
</I>&gt;<i> creates content and writes scripts or if you are looking for both.
</I>
Great question!

This is the heart of the question.

Ideally a webmaster will do both (code and admin).  This is what makes 
the job really interesting, in my opinion. This is what attracted me to 
being a webmaster to begin with.
But lately I've been noticing that the profession &quot;webmaster&quot; is 
becoming... old-fashioned?

I attended the &quot;future of web design&quot; conference in NY last year, and a 
constant theme across many speakers was &quot;the need for specialization&quot;.

It was stated that webmasters are a dying breed, and that now one should 
hire a web designer, a web developer, and a train a monkey for sysadmin. 
(jk)

I think webmasters need to stand up and be proud of their triple threat 
status!

So, yeah, where have all the webmasters gone?

-Andr&#233;

</PRE>
