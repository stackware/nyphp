YES!!  Yes yes yes.

Realistically speaking, though, nobody is going to like being &quot;strongly 
urged&quot; to use a particular framework or a particular code base.  And 
that's cool -- because we will always find ways to make the programming 
process &quot;our own&quot; and do it the way we feel is best, on a case by case 
basis.  

But as Peter pointed out, the cert is not really meant to lock us in 
to &quot;standards&quot;, it's important so that we are able to say &quot;I'm a 
certified PHP programmer and certified programmers get $XYZ per hour&quot; 
and have the power to back that up when the suit types decide we might 
be a cost sink, or that we don't need a lot of money because &quot;don't 
programmers all wear stained T shirts and exist on Pizza and computer 
games...&quot;!   [N.B. It's quite true that I do eat a lot of pizza and 
enjoy playing computer games, especially the antique arcade variety, 
but that's not ALL I need!.]

With regard to Zend, I haven't used it yet but did some cursory reading 
on it today after seeing this thread...and it looks very interesting.  
Of particular value, I think, is the session &amp; application state 
handling (which is always a huge chore and can lead to mental agony 
over &quot;the very best way to handle it in this case&quot;) -- standardizing 
this into best practice could be huge.  I'd like to get a chance to 
work with some of this, and also the JSON/AJAX stuff ...I had an 
opportunity to work with JSON a couple years ago but not since then.

I did use PEAR::SOAP recently while working with some Amazon AWS stuff 
and found the code to be very understandable and well documented.  
Ultimately we discovered we did not need the PEAR::SOAP &amp; could use 
PHP's built in SOAP, but I would definitely recommend this SOAP API for 
its ease of use.

&gt;<i> I believe that all of the informal industry-standard acknowledgements
</I>&gt;<i> and accolades that you call for in your note have already been
</I>&gt;<i> informally applied to all the entities that you mention and that this
</I>&gt;<i> informal approved/sanctioned condition has existed for years for PEAR,
</I>&gt;<i> sourceforege.net, et al. This has not successfully gelled into a
</I>&gt;<i> reliable, knowable, useable set of standards that makes it possible 
</I>for
&gt;<i> programmers and managers to have a quantifiable standard to work up to
</I>&gt;<i> and within. I am still in the camp that PHP programmers like realtors,
</I>&gt;<i> financial planners should have an association approved path and tool 
</I>set
