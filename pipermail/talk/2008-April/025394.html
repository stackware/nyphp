<PRE>Jim -- after 24 years in the field, I'd suggest that probably you are 
eligible to be granted a degree based on life experience!! :)

I was certainly not saying that a degree makes any sort of difference 
in competency (it doesn't!), but only that to be considered 
a &quot;profession&quot; for licensing purposes, a degree (or life experience 
constituting equivalence of a 4-yr degree!) would be most likely 
required.  

Probably I would run into issues with licensing myself as my degree was 
in Literature &amp; Linguistics (1985) ...and I used an old manual 
typewriter to do my research papers! LOL.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Guess 24 years experience programming in all kinds of environments 
</I>with 
&gt;<i> 15 or so languages does not constitute a profession then based on 
</I>your 
&gt;<i> position that it requires a degree.  I have no degree.  I have very 
</I>&gt;<i> little formal training.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem in today's world is that too much emphasis is put on a 
</I>&gt;<i> degree, and not enough emphasis is put on experience.  I'm not trying 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> denigrate degrees, I wish I had one ( especially considering the 
</I>heavy 
&gt;<i> emphasis ).  But, when I entered the programming fray, degrees were 
</I>not 
&gt;<i> emphasized.  I suspect that the dearth in competent coders at the 
</I>time 
&gt;<i> was a heavy influence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I very much like the lawyer example considering  Frank Abagnale Jr.  
</I>&gt;<i> Frank was made famous by Leonardo Dicaprio's portrayal in &quot;Catch Me 
</I>if 
&gt;<i> You Can&quot;.  While the movie is an exaggeration of the reality of the 
</I>&gt;<i> story, according to Frank, he did pass the bar exam without any 
</I>formal 
&gt;<i> education.  Now Frank may be an exceptional intellect, but I think it 
</I>&gt;<i> does draw out that it is fully possible for individuals to rise to 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> industry standard without a formal education.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I consider myself a professional in a profession even without the 
</I>&gt;<i> degree.  In fact, I consider myself a craftsman rather than an 
</I>engineer 
&gt;<i> because I take pride in everything I do and apply ingenuity and 
</I>&gt;<i> creativity rather than rely on a canned set of solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, I do not disregard formalized education, it forms a very 
</I>&gt;<i> good foundation on which to build a profession.  But to assume that 
</I>no 
&gt;<i> formalized education denotes a non-professional elevates formalized 
</I>&gt;<i> education to the be-all and end-all for the profession.  If that were 
</I>&gt;<i> the case, then, students coming out of college should be fully 
</I>prepared 
&gt;<i> to BE what they trained to be.  I can't tell you how many interviews 
</I>I 
&gt;<i> have conducted with graduates who obviously lacked the skills to do 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> job.  Ability should be the bellwether, not how that ability came to 
</I>be.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The real discussion is not on what qualifies one for the profession, 
</I>but 
&gt;<i> rather, how do we accurately measure ability.  I don't have the 
</I>answer 
&gt;<i> to that question.  And, I think that were an answer to that question 
</I>&gt;<i> readily available, there would be no need for this discussion.  Maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the licensing process should borrow from the medical 
</I>community 
&gt;<i> and require a period of &quot;residency&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kristina Anderson wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For all intents and purposes, a software engineer/application 
</I>developer 
&gt;<i> &gt; must have a bachelor's degree of some sort, and certainly after 10 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; years of doing this, I consider that it takes considerable training 
</I>and 
&gt;<i> &gt; specialized study to be reasonably good.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My question to you Urb:  Would you consider me, a person with a non-
</I>CS 
&gt;<i> &gt; university degree (B.A.), and 10 years of actual paid experience, 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> &gt; be &quot;self taught&quot; or merely &quot;non traditionally formally educated&quot;...?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's true that the skills to be a good programmer were learned &quot;in 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> &gt; field&quot; and not in a classroom but isn't that true of everyone?  And 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> &gt; say &quot;self taught&quot; is to really underestimate the contributions of 
</I>very 
&gt;<i> &gt; brilliant people I have learned from over the years including one 
</I>Dr. 
&gt;<i> &gt; Jerry A. who posts to this list, and many others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would sure welcome a NYS professional license for software 
</I>developers 
&gt;<i> &gt; and want to know would anyone else want to get active on that?  It 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could require a certain number of years of actual paid experience 
</I>and a 
&gt;<i> &gt; test and whatever else...I'm 100% in favor of this if it helps us 
</I>get 
&gt;<i> &gt; more respect.  As Urb pointed out, other types of engineers do have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licensing.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (My previous polemic having been somewhat out of place because we 
</I>were 
&gt;<i> &gt; talking about a &quot;webmaster test&quot; -- but it's one thing if you are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking for someone who can hand code a little HTML...that's not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessarily a &quot;profession&quot; -- but if you are looking for someone 
</I>who 
&gt;<i> &gt; can administer your LAMP environment AND design &amp; develop your LAMP 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications then you are looking for someone with a sh*tload of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experience and broad based experience at that...you are looking for 
</I>a 
&gt;<i> &gt; LAMP engineer not a &quot;webmaster&quot;.  Calling this person a &quot;webmaster&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with all those skills is another way of keeping respect, and pay 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scales, down.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My point having been that (no offense to the lawyers out there) it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; takes WAY MORE BRAINS to design &amp; develop working code than it does 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> &gt; write a divorce complaint or a commercial lease -- which is what 
</I>most 
&gt;<i> &gt; lawyers do -- most of them are not litigation experts who deal with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arcane Supreme Court decisions and get on Court TV -- and by the 
</I>same 
&gt;<i> &gt; token most software developers are not dealing with the highest, 
</I>most 
&gt;<i> &gt; arcane levels of software (whatever that might be deemed to be).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But it is a profession requiring a 4 year degree (de facto) and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CONSIDERABLE training and specialized education...!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  By definition, programming and website design is not a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; profession.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;         
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Really? What specifically is that definition?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;       
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; profession: &quot;An occupation, such as law, medicine, or engineering, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that requires considerable training
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and specialized study&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Houghton Mifflin Dictionary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Even an engineer must have a professional engineering (PE) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; designation to perform certain types of design.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't have a problem with a self taught programmers, I've known 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; some great ones, however, a field having
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a large number of practitioners without formal training is a trade 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not a profession. A profession is also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; self-regulated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It's another thread but, should there be certification available 
</I>for 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; programmers and web designers? If we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ever want to be considered a profession, that's the first step. I 
</I>was 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in the stock brokerage business when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the designation Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) first came into 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; being. It was extraordinarily difficult
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and it took almost two years after the announcement before the 
</I>first 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; designation were awarded. It required
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; two 8 hour day testing sessions. It made a huge difference in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; industry and these days you will not get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a senior level job in a research department without a CFA. Same 
</I>thing 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; happened with Chartered Financial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Planner (CFP).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm unsure of the procedure, but how/when does one change the 
</I>subject 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; when we have drifted into a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; area?
