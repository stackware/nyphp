<PRE>I would have nothing against an independently created and sanctioned PHP
cert devised/approved by the author/core developers, but it seems that
would be a big waste of how far Zend has already taken things and it
does not seem like there is sufficient momentum/cohesion to firmly
establish such an independent entity or it would probably have appeared
by now. Peter

Instead of trying to force a few applications, repositories and people 
into positions they are not ready for, would it not be better to 
organize efforts to contribute to those which are best suited to take 
those positions in the near future? A defacto standard is much more 
powerful than an appointed standard.

Instead of trying to convince everyone that PEAR is the best place to 
get reusable code, why not contribute to PEAR and remove all doubt? 
Instead of forcing everyone to sign up for a proprietary certification 
that does not have community support, why not create an open 
certification group that has the support of the community and gains 
community respect because of it? Don't just name user groups as 
something a programmer should be a member of, make them so valuable 
(through contributions of experience) that one will be foolish not to 
sign up.

If you can get a large group of people to take those steps, your dream 
of a well respected and formally recognized best practices and 
applications will follow.
