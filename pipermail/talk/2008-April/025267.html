<PRE>Wow, I really appreciate the feedback and some of the many comments i am
getting to my original question. I ask my original question not so much I
have some secrecy of any kind of application. As I mentioned, I'm not much
of a programmer in practice. I'm just getting interest in the encryption
technology as a whole and since I have not really used any of them I wanted
to get an idea how effective they are.

Now the feedback with the questions and comments I am getting are good, in
that, they make me think why would I use it and to achieve what purpose.
What I've been hoping to gain from asking my question is then why &amp; when to
use such encryption tool - especially, when hosting your data remotely by a
hosting provider.

My thought is if encryption techniques like TrueCrypt works - Why not use it
regardless who is your hosting provider. Or, having to consider questions
like who you trying to protect data from. I mean, when you buy a nice bran
new expensive car you have a key to lock the doors and some go further to
put in a car alarm or car tracking device. Who you're trying to prevent from
stealing your car is no brainer question to consider - IMO. One knows that
locking the door and/or having a car alarm is a deterrent - Though not 100%
guaranteed. Maybe my example is not the best but just trying to raise a
point.

In my question to deploy some encryption on my data would (help) minimize
people stealing private data - Why not use it, especially if there's not
much performance penalty.

David, regarding you comments below:

&gt;<i> So are you worried about encryption during uploading or about encryption
</I>&gt;<i> while executing the scripts on the server and serving up content - or both?
</I>&gt;<i> What other security measures did you include?
</I>

You've hit the right questions I am looking to understand. The answer is
both. From what I understand about a tool like TrueCrypt I can encrypt say
my webfolder (web site) and upload it to my hosting provider. And, what I am
trying to understand is can the encrypted data remain encrypted and still
serve content. Or, once I upload the encrypted data must I need to decrypt
it to serve the content? I am not concern about data being encrypted out to
the users browser. SSL takes care of that - right? So, if it is that I can
encrypt and it remains encrypt while serving content then this is not a bad
solution. And, of course one can take other measures like ssh to the server
to actually keep access to it secure.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I am just looking into a solutions to encrypt data. The question
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as to why I would want to do that is not the question - But, thanks for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; asking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the reason for me asking is that there may be a better approach than
</I>&gt;<i> taking the big hammer. I speak from experience as I often use(d) the big
</I>&gt;<i> hammer and everything was a nail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What are you trying to protect and who are you protecting it against?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm looking to protect data/information that could be the software code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and/or customer's client info.. Protection should be from anyone who does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not need to have access to the website data or the DB... Of course, data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be shown to users (web client) who has been given access to view this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data from the application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So who is your hoster? Every thought about self-hosting or having the
</I>&gt;<i> customer run the server? Any chance that this might work via intranet rather
</I>&gt;<i> than internet, because then you probably want to add SSL to the pages. I do
</I>&gt;<i> not know if that is difficult to do. But keep in mind, anything that is
</I>&gt;<i> accessible via internet is not what I'd consider entirely secure.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why you need to protect the software code. PHP is server side
</I>&gt;<i> only and the client doesn't see anything from your PHP code.
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, it is assumed that legitimate users are allowed to see
</I>&gt;<i> information, otherwise the whole setup would be quite pointless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What I am interested in is to find the most effective and most secure way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to upload my website &amp; db to remote host and the data is fully protected by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encryption.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As mentioned above, hosting something offsite and have it be available
</I>&gt;<i> through the internet is IMHO not secure. Taking stuff can be made more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult, but most secure....well, I leave that up to the experts, but I
</I>&gt;<i> have my doubts - see Hannaford, TJX, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I will look into the ionCube suggested earlier - Though this seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a PHP only base solution. From what I gather, a product like TrueCrypt could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be better as I can encrypt an entire volume or folder and it's done -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regardless of type of code or application that exist or being encrypted.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, comes down to the hosting service that you have. Do you have that
</I>&gt;<i> much access and rights to the server that you can just go ahead and run
</I>&gt;<i> services that encrypt and decrypt entire folders?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know many software type companies package there software where either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; partially or fully the code is encrypted and protected. This is the similar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type of solution I guess I am looking for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nah, most companies distribute binaries that make it difficult enough for
</I>&gt;<i> people like me to re-engineer the code. But look at the open source security
</I>&gt;<i> applications. Their code is freely available. Security through obscurity is
</I>&gt;<i> one of the worst approaches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to rain on your parade, but taking into account that you are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;not much of a php/programmer&quot; you may want to take a step back and think
</I>&gt;<i> this over if that application is indeed that critical and demands such
</I>&gt;<i> secrecy that code and database have to be encrypted. I play around with PHP
</I>&gt;<i> for about five years now and I don't think that I'd be capable of writing a
</I>&gt;<i> secure application. I'm not saying that you are not capable of that, but I
</I>&gt;<i> have the impression that you think slapping some encryption onto something
</I>&gt;<i> makes it secure.
</I>&gt;<i> I am also wondering a bit about your statement that you want &quot;to find the
</I>&gt;<i> most effective and most secure way to upload my website &amp; db to remote
</I>&gt;<i> host&quot;. So are you worried about encryption during uploading or about
</I>&gt;<i> encryption while executing the scripts on the server and serving up content
</I>&gt;<i> - or both? What other security measures did you include? Kaptchas? Multiple
</I>&gt;<i> time-limited passwords? Multiple access levels? Effective session management
</I>&gt;<i> to kick people out of the system after a few minutes of inactivity? Or even
</I>&gt;<i> other means such as biometrics as identification? Your own certificate?
</I>&gt;<i> Also, does it have to be a web client? I'd guess there are way more and
</I>&gt;<i> way better means to encrypt data when working with fat clients. Also, which
</I>&gt;<i> database engine do you plan to use? Does that database engine have means to
</I>&gt;<i> encrypt entire tables or data sets?
</I>&gt;<i> And what do you do for client security? There is not much gained when your
</I>&gt;<i> server is like Fort Knox, but the users can access the application from any
</I>&gt;<i> client on any network and then do so from theit favourite internet cafe,
</I>&gt;<i> leaving the PC unattended while getting another beer. So you want to at
</I>&gt;<i> least restrict the IP address (ranges) that are allowed to get even to the
</I>&gt;<i> login page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for asking that many questions, but I think those and many more
</I>&gt;<i> questions need to be asked and sufficiently answered.
