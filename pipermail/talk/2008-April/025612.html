<PRE>Really hope the questions about Left Outer Joins using COALESCE and how 
to get mail() to work on a Windows box aren't on the cert test??

Or I'm doo doo. :)

PS I'm not sure how to say &quot;fogged a mirror&quot; in Latin but we can look 
it up!

&gt;<i> on 2008-04-23 17:25 Peter Sawczynec said the following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe the most beneficial PHP+ cert that we can strive for 
</I>would be
&gt;<i> &gt; more on par with a Cisco cert. An acknowledged, industry heavy 
</I>weight,
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the lower-level Cisco certs (i.e. everything but the CCIE 
</I>or 
&gt;<i> its equivalent) now have a multitude of boot-camps available for them 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> push you through in a weekend, and therefore their value, both real 
</I>and 
&gt;<i> perceived, is slipping. It's been a while since I've studied the 
</I>finer 
&gt;<i> trivia of Cisco kit, but I'm confident I could muster a passing score 
</I>&gt;<i> all the way up to CCNP without studying for more than a weekend--a 
</I>week, 
&gt;<i> tops. Would you let me loose on your routers *only* knowing *that*? 
</I>(The 
&gt;<i> fact that I deal with Cisco kit in other ways on a daily basis 
</I>&gt;<i> notwithstanding...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What makes the CCIE so valuable is that it contains both a written 
</I>and a 
&gt;<i> lab component, and the latter is damn *hard* -- it has a real failure 
</I>&gt;<i> rate in the double digits -- so that it's unlikely that you'll be 
</I>able 
&gt;<i> to pass it through book learning alone. That is to say: in order to 
</I>pass 
&gt;<i> it, you're most likely an experienced practitioner already.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see a lot of talk about certifications, and I have to reiterate the 
</I>&gt;<i> question: why bother? In other words, what are you trying to 
</I>accomplish? 
&gt;<i> In order for it to really fulfill its mission, a certification 
</I>basically 
&gt;<i> needs to substantiate someone's years of experience and actual 
</I>ability 
&gt;<i> to perform: it's a *certification* that you can *do something* that 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't just your word for it, and it comes from an impartial third 
</I>party 
&gt;<i> (whoever they may be).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, it matters a bit who the certifying authority is (which is 
</I>&gt;<i> why people value degrees from real colleges over mail-order degrees), 
</I>&gt;<i> but unless there is a statutory requirement for licensure and 
</I>&gt;<i> registration, the only value of the certification &quot;in the 
</I>marketplace&quot; 
&gt;<i> is what the holders are actually doing: if you've got a certificate 
</I>that 
&gt;<i> is, in a word, achievable in a week's intensive course, it's 
</I>worthless 
&gt;<i> except to paper collectors, and the market will value the 
</I>certification 
&gt;<i> accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult but well worth while cert. I believe that the cert should 
</I>be
&gt;<i> &gt; advanced, sophisticated and relatively difficult -- the PHP+ cert 
</I>should
&gt;<i> &gt; not be about qualifying entry-level initiates, it would be used for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; qualifying middle to expert level.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Peter has successfully compiled the correct here. I would take it 
</I>&gt;<i> further: the exam should be QUITE difficult, and dilettantes should 
</I>NOT 
&gt;<i> be able to pass it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Make a certification more like the PE, where you must show verifiable 
</I>&gt;<i> years of experience (signed off by another in the field), and have a 
</I>&gt;<i> tough exam on top of that (and I'm not even counting the EIT), or 
</I>more 
&gt;<i> like the CCIE, with a very difficult pair of exams, *written and 
</I>&gt;<i> practical*, and then you'd have a certification that is worth 
</I>bandying 
&gt;<i> about--something that conveys the elusive &quot;I should get paid more 
</I>&gt;<i> because I'm *demonstrably* worth it&quot; message.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh yes, it should also need to be renewed every 7 years or so, not 
</I>just 
&gt;<i> to generate income for the certifying authority, but to demonstrate 
</I>that 
&gt;<i> you're still at the level you claim to be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There could/should be a separate entry-level cert if needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given the field of programming, I would suggest the &quot;fog a mirror&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> certification. For $29.95, I'll provide you with a certificate 
</I>suitable 
&gt;<i> for framing. For $39.95, I'll even make it 3 color. (Latin available 
</I>&gt;<i> upon request, and only to Kristina.)
</I>&gt;<i>
