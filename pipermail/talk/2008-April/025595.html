<PRE>Mike -- 99.9% of the people posting on this list do have a university 
degree, from what I have seen!  A lot of them have MS or PhDs, even.

But, a 10- or 20-year old degree doesn't prove anything when it comes 
to current technology.  A certification in current technology proves 
that you are knowledgeable in a certain area, at least to a certain 
extent, and also quantifies the knowledge base for our profession as 
PHP programmers, which is why we are (mostly) in favor of a cert.

--Kristina (B.A., 1985) :)

&gt;<i> No matter how many certificates you stack on top of each other from
</I>&gt;<i> Manhattan to the Moon, it STILL does not equate to a BScs degree. I
</I>&gt;<i> see lots of people here bitterly complaining about legitimacy and yet
</I>&gt;<i> the avoid the very thing that gives them instant credibility, the
</I>&gt;<i> Degree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My very first experience with sitting in front of a keyboard was in
</I>&gt;<i> fact while I was working on my degree at a time when BScs didn't exist
</I>&gt;<i> and colleges were issuing BSEE degrees for graduates who majored in
</I>&gt;<i> Computer Science.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From my experience with certificates, the only people who really
</I>&gt;<i> benefit from them are the companies that hype them and the test taker
</I>&gt;<i> courses that teach you how to take the test and not whether the
</I>&gt;<i> qualifications are solid or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From my perspective, have been a hiring manager for more than twenty
</I>&gt;<i> years, I know from bitter experience that certificate programs are a
</I>&gt;<i> LOT more marketing hype than they are a practical barometer for
</I>&gt;<i> gauging what someone is suppose to know about anything. Lots of people
</I>&gt;<i> can pass tests and don't know basis stuff when you set them in front 
</I>of
&gt;<i> a keyboard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some sound advice, GET THE DEGREE! When push comes to shove that is
</I>&gt;<i> what give you credibility not some pie in the sky marketing hype that
</I>&gt;<i> promises the moon and delivers chopped liver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a hiring situation when two candidates are pretty well equally
</I>&gt;<i> qualified, one with a degree and one without, almost ALWAYS the degree
</I>&gt;<i> is the determining factor for who gets the job!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This whole &quot;self governing body&quot; sounds a lot like a scam to me to
</I>&gt;<i> create a yet another bureaucratic monstrosity that has no power and
</I>&gt;<i> generates a lot of useless noise. Corporate Entities are obligated to
</I>&gt;<i>  do what is best for their stock holders and that is the driving force
</I>&gt;<i>  for how products generated by Zend Technologies evolve. The fact that
</I>&gt;<i>  they haven't become a Micro$$$ is perhaps only a matter of waiting 
</I>for
&gt;<i>  the right time and has nothing at all to do with &quot;community&quot;. 
</I>Whenever
&gt;<i>  they figure out how to do a licensing gig like Micro$$$, to exploit
</I>&gt;<i>  all the PHP developers on the planet, then you will discover who 
</I>exactly the
&gt;<i>  &quot;governing body&quot; for PHP is to be sure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  My experience with User groups is that they tend to think they are 
</I>the
&gt;<i>  &quot;driving force&quot; for products when in reality they are, well, User 
</I>Groups and
&gt;<i>  really don't have the power they think they do. They have the yearly
</I>&gt;<i>  meetings and put on their conferences etc. but its the Corporation
</I>&gt;<i>  roadmap that decides the directions for where the products go, not 
</I>the user groups.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -- 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>  mikesz                            mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">mikesz at qualityadvantages.com</A>
