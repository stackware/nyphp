<PRE>It seems we (I mean PHP programmers) have all the tools and instruments
already at our fingertips for more formalizing the study and application
of PHP, we'd just have to agree to ring our wagons around what we've got
on hand.

For example:

a) we have the very large and well-recognized repository of PHP work for
reference and re-use at Sourceforge.net and PEAR, 
b) we have the very well used and respected Php.net as large-scale
reference hub,  
c) we have Zend offering a commercialized IDE/framework and other
enterprise updates to PHP 
d) we have a handful of large free PHP user groups and these groups, say
the top 10, should be formally recognized, and one should be expected to
belong to one of these groups.

So what would be wrong if we just agreed as a professional group to use
these above entities as our bedrock standards. We use the Zend cert, the
Zend IDE/framework and officially sanction Php.net and
Sourceforge.net/PEAR as the defacto outlets of help/reference and code. 

We would not deny the use of, learning of, or the amicable co-existence
of any and all other outlets/entities, but the above noted entities
would be the generalized initial standards.

So as a new programmer in books/classes/tutorials you are always pointed
to Php.net for reference, you are behooved to use from and contribute to
Sourceforge.net/PEAR, you are prompted/guided/expected to join a listed
user group, and you are advised to get Zend cert and learn that
IDE/framework. 

And that a programmer who has Zend cert. and is a recognized user group
member can use the status of PHP+ user/programmer on their
credentials/resume.

Just a thought. Now that could be a start.
