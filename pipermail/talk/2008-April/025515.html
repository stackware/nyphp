<PRE>
&gt;<i> &gt; My question to you Urb:  Would you consider me, a person with a non-CS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; university degree (B.A.), and 10 years of actual paid experience, to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be &quot;self taught&quot; or merely &quot;non traditionally formally educated&quot;...?
</I>

         Good question. I think you are an exceptional person :-) Let me make
something perfectly clear. I'm a big proponent of non-traditional learning,
I didn't enter a college classroom until I was 44 years old. My under-
graduate degree is from Thomas Edison State College which is totally
a non-traditional educational institution.

&gt;<i> &gt; It's true that the skills to be a good programmer were learned &quot;in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; field&quot; and not in a classroom but isn't that true of everyone?
</I>
         Unfortunately, that's true of most people through no fault of their
own. When I was teaching at the college level I was one of 13 full-time
computer faculty member. I was the only one who had ever earned a
nickle in the field. &quot;Real World&quot; experience makes a difference.

&gt;<i>And to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say &quot;self taught&quot; is to really underestimate the contributions of very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brilliant people I have learned from over the years including one Dr.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jerry A. who posts to this list, and many others.
</I>
         I have hired programmers with no formal training and I know
people with a Ph.D. in computer science that I would not hire under
any conditions.

&gt;<i>I would also say, that many &quot;professions&quot; require practical experience in
</I>&gt;<i>the field. Doctors have internships. Architects have to work for a firm
</I>&gt;<i>for a certain length of time, etc etc. That looks like on-the-job training
</I>&gt;<i>to me.
</I>
         Aren't you suggesting that a professional require formal training
as well as on-the-job training?

         Let my turn it around a bit. Would you go to a doctor who was
completely self taught? I once ask a fellow faculty member, &quot;what is
the difference between a Public Accountant and a Certified Public
Accountant?&quot; His answer, &quot;about 50K per year.&quot;

&gt;<i>  Certainly a programmer that has a degree and has several years of
</I>&gt;<i>paid experience ought to be considered a professional of some kind.
</I>
         It's really semantics. You are free to define &quot;professional&quot; any
way you like. Ask some non-computer friends how they would define
professional.

         Let me make a practical point. 10 years after the Financial Analysts
Federation announced there Certified Financial Analysts (CFA) designation
those so certified was making 56% more than their cohorts not 
certified.

         Someone ask a question, do we want the government determining
what qualifications we should have to get a programming job? Of course
not. However, shouldn't we have a national organization who, among
other things, establishes credential standards? The real problem would be
to get a group of practitioners to agree on the criterion for accreditation.
