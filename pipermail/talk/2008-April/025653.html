</I>I worked in CF for a couple years before moving to PHP.  This was around 
version 5 (it's been about 7 years).

CF was quick to learn and allowed me to get the job done.  The language 
provided plenty of built-in goodies including database connections, ftp 
and scheduling.  Anything that wasn't built in could be added using cfx 
tags and cfscript.  My biggest issue back then was the inevitable &quot;tag 
soup&quot;.  Tag Monsoon might be more appropriate.  Also, most libraries - 
and even tutorial sites - cost $$ (akin to ASP) - at least back then, 
which was a no-no for the just-starting-out full time web developer that 
I'd been at the time. 

To its credit, as a local network manager for an international financial 
software company downtown, I bought a CF book for $20 from a street 
vendor and changed the entire company's support / service branch for the 
better by providing an intranet based on their orginal access database 
which they (ahem *I*) used to ftp from/to 5 offices internationally 
every Friday. That was after about 3-5 weeks with that book and a copy 
of homesite (now dreamweaver).  I spent about a year with that app 
thereafter and it became incredibly difficult to maintain because of the 
tag soup I mentioned above, but to start - and to learn, quick and easy.

I'm sure it's become a different beast since the move to the Java code 
base.  But if they're still all about the tags, I'd recommend against.

After I left that job, I moved to PHP and rarely, if ever, looked back.  
Happily.

Good luck!

Mark
