<PRE>To Jason @ InnovationAds.com
 
Jason, from the tone of your email, you think we developers are full of sh*t. If I understand correctly, you can&#8217;t get a decent resume across your desk and you are frustrated and desperate to find people to work in &#8220;perhaps the best environment you&#8217;ve seen in NY&#8221;. 
 
The real picture seems a little different however.
 
According to your website, you don&#8217;t have any technology jobs:
<A HREF="http://jobs.innovationads.com/technology">http://jobs.innovationads.com/technology</A>
 
And here is just a sample of a long, long list of empty cliches from your employment page. You&#8217;d think this was a draft for an article in The Onion: dynamic company, exponential growth, success based on high quality products and services at a low cost , constantly looking for ways to improve in the ways we deliver services, market leader connecting thousands of consumers with businesses every day, multi-faceted organization , believes in maintaining high standards in everything we do, the better we are the better we serve our clients, dedicated to hiring the best in the industry, workforce geared toward achieving even higher levels of success, strong commitment to diversity, diversity helps us meet and exceed our customers' needs, diversity is vital and necessary to our success in providing quality products and services for our clients, committed to helping the environment by carrying out a set of principals which are aligned with the Company&#8217;s
 mission, etc. etc. etc.
 
Sorry to be so harsh, but do you honestly think the above paints a good picture for prospective candidates? Your website is the first place we are going to look and it just screams corporate boredom and politics. If it were one percent as passionate and human as your post, perhaps you&#8217;d have a better success rate.
