</I>&gt;<i> those bittersweet memories may make many like kryptonite in your hands. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The net net of this note is that this webmaster test discussion quickly
</I>&gt;<i> uncovered how everything that is going on in one's life is all
</I>&gt;<i> intertwined: business choices and paths, education history, friendship
</I>&gt;<i> model, the feng shui of your home and neighborhood, even your health
</I>&gt;<i> issues and how you eat, how you decide to express and present yourself,
</I>&gt;<i> even how you deal with your sleeping dreams: all these matters are
</I>&gt;<i> interrelated and affecting the moment by moment outcome of everything in
</I>&gt;<i> your life. (Did you know it has been shown that people who sleep next to
</I>&gt;<i> each other affect the content each other's dreams, even causing each
</I>&gt;<i> other's dreaming to start and stop in harmony.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One may need to look into many aspects of their life to find where is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The webmaster test thread shows clearly how everything (seems like
</I>&gt;<i> everything) is interrelated and you cannot discuss or look for the
</I>&gt;<i> answer to an issue within a single sphere of life/business. Look a layer
</I>&gt;<i> up or down, look a strata to the left. It is all a sliding scale of
</I>&gt;<i> grays, even what appears black and white is just real dark and very
</I>&gt;<i> light gray.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     field.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's actually not true, and your apparent belief in this untruth is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> for 
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> university education.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Huh? I got two university degrees and did so voluntarily. So what you
</I>&gt;<i> say is 
</I>&gt;<i> clearly not the case. My point is that someone who for example takes a
</I>&gt;<i> BSEE 
</I>&gt;<i> program at Alfred State College is required to have 132 credits for 
</I>&gt;<i> graduation. From those 132 credits 60 credit hours are for liberal arts 
</I>&gt;<i> classes and other sciences that are non-major. Not all of those may be
</I>&gt;<i> totally 
</I>&gt;<i> off topic, but I don't get why a BSEE student has to take american
</I>&gt;<i> history 
</I>&gt;<i> again or take an arts course (or even more than just one). The 13 years
</I>&gt;<i> K-12 
</I>&gt;<i> ought to have covered that. I also think that a high school graduate
</I>&gt;<i> should be 
</I>&gt;<i> capable of properly expressing thoughts in speech and writing and not
</I>&gt;<i> needing 
</I>&gt;<i> yet another round of English courses. I got my BSEE degree at a non-US 
</I>&gt;<i> university in a seven semester program with a total of 154 credits and
</I>&gt;<i> as 
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned before only 3 courses were not that much related to
</I>&gt;<i> engineering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The purpose of a college or university is to provide the student with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> an 
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> education, so that the student may go on to contribute back to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> society.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, c'mon! Reading books to children or planting trees or donating blood
</I>&gt;<i> or 
</I>&gt;<i> driving people to their doctor's appointments - that is giving back to 
</I>&gt;<i> society. Getting a university degree is for the sake of getting a better
</I>&gt;<i> job 
</I>&gt;<i> with better pay and ideally get some more exposure to a subject that one
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> likes. How does getting a degree in finance and becoming a greedy
</I>&gt;<i> investment 
</I>&gt;<i> banker give back to society? I can see getting a degree in social work
</I>&gt;<i> being 
</I>&gt;<i> something that gives back to society. Or do you mean that graduates get
</I>&gt;<i> better 
</I>&gt;<i> paying jobs and thus pay more taxes and that helps funding government
</I>&gt;<i> programs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the rest that you wrote and I don't think it collides with
</I>&gt;<i> what I 
</I>&gt;<i> wrote earlier. My point is that compared to other countries US
</I>&gt;<i> universities 
</I>&gt;<i> focus way too much on a broad education rather than on transferring 
</I>&gt;<i> specialized skills and knowledge of a specific subject. And I think that
</I>&gt;<i> is 
</I>&gt;<i> why foreign workers especially in IT have an advantage. I'm not saying
</I>&gt;<i> that an 
</I>&gt;<i> extra writing course is useless or that art history is utterly
</I>&gt;<i> unimportant, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I think that is something that shouldn't be part of a university
</I>&gt;<i> program.
