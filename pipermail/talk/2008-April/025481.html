Ain't that the truth!

The product here is net-ware -- it's 100% digital and 100% accessible 
by the world. Why anyone would want their product to be created at 
some physical place is beyond me.

Perhaps it's the suit types who think that if they don't have an 
employee under their thumb, the employee would goof-off like they 
would if they had the chance -- I don't know. But typically, us geek 
types like doing what we do and if left alone, we do it pretty well. 
This stuff is both my livelihood and my passion. If I'm not being 
paid for it -- I do it anyway (except for myself).

I've worked for myself for decades. Sure, I've been offered numerous 
positions and have even considered a few, but two things happen 
during the interview: 1) They want me to work on their windoze 
machines, which I refuse to do -- I have my own system, a Mac, thank 
you; 2) Once they find out I'm disabled, things change. Sure, one can 
carry on about the ADA, but that's a bunch of nonsense that just 
keeps government types employed. All business has to say is &quot;I'm 
sorry, but you wouldn't pass our health screening. And please don't 
let the door hit your ass on the way out.&quot; But, that's topic for 
another day.

The point being, our product is digital and as such should be allowed 
to be created anywhere.

Cheers,

tedd
