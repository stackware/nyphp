My bad, I was addressing your entire response, should have included
more inlines.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wasn't out to dissuade anyone from utilizing some kind of pseudo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code testing, I'm just trying to offer an alternative point of view,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the receiving end of interviews (interviewee if you will).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Certainly your viewpoint is valid, and valued.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my, admittedly limited experience, I've found company interviews
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that start, contain, or end with, &quot;Hi! Here's a computer / piece of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paper, you'll have 45 minutes to complete this exercise consisting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; almost entirely of php.net/[insert function name here]&quot;, represents a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; company on the path to fail, one which I ended up in because I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know any better, two I rejected offers from.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Yes, well, that's NOT what we're talking about. But those companies do
</I>&gt;<i> exist, and it behooves you to understand what they're thinking. And also
</I>&gt;<i> consider the whole fizzbuzz
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html</A>) problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here's my point of view: if you (as a recruiter) can come up with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing better than a rehash of references and a test of memorization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the gateway for a new hire, then what kind of quality can I expect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the rest of the company? Just as everyone here is putting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Well, gee, it could be that the HR guy is somewhat divorced from the actual
</I>&gt;<i> development team; or that he's the first gateway in; or that he's a
</I>&gt;<i> recruiter from a firm and not the actual principal at all, and uses the
</I>&gt;<i> results for many of his clients!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emphasis on finding the right candidate, weeding out the weak ones,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to offer the idea that maybe each candidate is trying to find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the right company, and that puts you (the interviewer) on the spot.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  That's all well and good from both sides: if you wouldn't like it here,
</I>&gt;<i> it's far more likely you'll spend your time looking for your next position.
</I>&gt;<i> I always open the floor to questions from the interviewee; what he/she
</I>&gt;<i> *asks* us is often about as enlightening as how he/she answers us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not trying to leave you with the impression that Millennials are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ingrates (compared to what, Gen-Xers?), but that there are many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; options available to us, applying for a job is trivial thanks to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internet/head hunters, and supply (of us) is limited. I think that you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In fact, the triviality of application is a sword that cuts both ways:
</I>&gt;<i> because of it, people have had to develop these semi-automated methods of
</I>&gt;<i> separating wheat from chaff because so many people use scattershot methods
</I>&gt;<i> of applying for positions, rather than apply for something appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be doing your company a disservice if you didn't consider this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before giving a candidate a test that makes them reconsider their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; choice to apply (or even showup) by insulting their intelligence.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I, personally, have told recruiters and/or hiring managers: &quot;I don't take
</I>&gt;<i> written tests&quot; when I applied for positions. At that time, at my stage in
</I>&gt;<i> life, if I wasn't talking to a principal, or my CV didn't stand on its own,
</I>&gt;<i> I could pass on the job. That was my decision, and I'm sure that I missed
</I>&gt;<i> out on a few good opportunities. Maybe I was just being a prima donna.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I paid my dues a few times, and I've got the references to back
</I>&gt;<i> myself up, so I can take that chance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  **HOWEVER**, were I applying for some entry-level position, I'd expect to
</I>&gt;<i> be tested on the basics, perhaps *even with a rudimentary written test*, and
</I>&gt;<i> that any company that DIDN'T was showing lack of due diligence (read:
</I>&gt;<i> malfeasance). The industry is rife with these stories: dailywtf posts them
</I>&gt;<i> almost daily (&quot;Tales from the Interview&quot;), _Peopleware_ devotes a whole
</I>&gt;<i> chapter to it (&quot;Audition&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The written test that Andr&#233; originally posted was flawed in implementation,
</I>&gt;<i> but totally sound in theory. It merely needed refining (and maybe not even
</I>&gt;<i> that much). Remember: it is meant as a very very gross filter, just to
</I>&gt;<i> totally weed out the completely incompetent who make it past your HR
</I>&gt;<i> department or cursory scan at a CV.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I said it before and I'll reiterate it: yes, doing this kind of pre-testing
</I>&gt;<i> might make me miss out on hiring the next RMS or Joel Spolsky, but I have to
</I>&gt;<i> weigh that against other very compelling needs (like if I spend two days
</I>&gt;<i> interviewing only 5 candidates, I have lots two days of other work that I
</I>&gt;<i> need to do for clients, etc.).
