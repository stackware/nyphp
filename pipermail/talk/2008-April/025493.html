I think there shouldn't be a general rule -- or maybe it's correlated with 
the size of the system and the level of specialization desired.  I assume a lot 
of independents are catering to small and medium-sized businesses.
 
Maybe it's apples and oranges.  It's actually kind of nice that the various 
options are available, to accommodate the broad range of personalities that 
exist.

Good question :-)

I actually have one full time - and very valuable - employee working 
completely from home, in FL nonetheless. I have a graphic designer working full time 
from Croatia. Both are important to the company, neither is part of a team.

For the dev group - which is where my heart lies - they are all here with me 
every day.

Now, if one gets sick, or as mentioned ealier has a child care issue, or a 
broken car, or simply can't bear the thought of commuting on a given day, I am 
totally fine with them working from home.

Like I said in a previous post, the exception, not the rule

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] Why IT Sucks

I agree with you about the WWD article, Jason, and I'm actually not a
CIO or upper management.

I telecommuted for a company out of state for a year, and then quit
because I could see that it simply wasn't going to work out. I agree
that you need some face-to-face time to iron out specs.

However, on the other hand, I find it highly unnecessary to be on-site
100% of the time. Do you think that there is some sort of a compromise
in this area, or do you see it black &amp; white: you're on or you're off?

I'm just curious about what you think on this.

As a side note, I've been flying solo since Jan. '07, and I find that
most of my clients chose me because I *can* work on-site here in NYC.
I don't do this 100% of the time, but I find that some face-time is
absolutely necessary for most business people. As a business person
myself, I completely understand that. You want to see where your money
is going.
