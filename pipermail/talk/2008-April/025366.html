<PRE>This goes back to my point about the status of the profession --  if 
we're being compared to cooks and service technicians, you know times 
are going to be rough for us.  I'd rather be compared to a lawyer...and 
make closer to what they make...what we do is no less complex.





&gt;<i> This is a very interesting discussion. I believe in being able to  
</I>&gt;<i> obtain the best person for the job, but  I'm not sure that creating 
</I>a  
&gt;<i> standardize programming test is the best way. Or to devise some 
</I>trick  
&gt;<i> questions. It reminds me of academic hazing constructed to make the  
</I>&gt;<i> instructor look smart.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you were going to hire a personal cook, you would go by  
</I>&gt;<i> recommendations and actually sample what they can prepare based on  
</I>&gt;<i> the kind of meals you desire. A cook passing a test about the use of  
</I>&gt;<i> appliances and what's the best way to melt butter doesn't mean they  
</I>&gt;<i> are going to be able to make the Weight Watchers&#174; meat-loaf the way  
</I>&gt;<i> you like it. You would have the candidate cook prepare some meals 
</I>for  
&gt;<i> you and ask for their feed back on real questions like, &quot;We eat many  
</I>&gt;<i> chicken dishes, what do you recommend?&quot;. This would also give you a  
</I>&gt;<i> chance to see if this person is not only able to prepare a meal to  
</I>&gt;<i> your liking but if they are a good resource for you as well. Before 
</I>I  
&gt;<i> push this any further, I don't have a cook, don't know how to cook,  
</I>&gt;<i> but I know what I would want if I was going to hire one cause it  
</I>&gt;<i> would be based on what they actually have to do on the job. A  
</I>&gt;<i> certified cook doesn't mean much if they can't make White Chocolate  
</I>&gt;<i> Mousse on-demand. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bringing this back to programming, webmastering, or service  
</I>&gt;<i> tech'ing. :-) You want to hire a webmaster. Make a list of the kinds  
</I>&gt;<i> of things you wish to have a webmaster do on the job most of their  
</I>&gt;<i> time. If the job is to be able to re-partition disks or change  
</I>&gt;<i> content on a corporate web site using a popular open source CMS  
</I>&gt;<i> (Joomla), then I feel those are the things that should be asked of a  
</I>&gt;<i> candidate to demonstrate in front of a work station. If most of 
</I>their  
&gt;<i> job will be installing new software and configuring a system then set-
</I> 
&gt;<i> up some systems with packages for them to do this. This is assuming  
</I>&gt;<i> if you can't entirely trust the recommendations for this person or 
</I>if  
&gt;<i> you simply want to see if they can do what you need them to do  
</I>&gt;<i> specifically. If the candidate doesn't know how to do something and  
</I>&gt;<i> looks on the web to figure it out, and is still able to get the job  
</I>&gt;<i> done in a reasonable amount of time than I consider this a plus,  
</I>&gt;<i> because someone who is resourceful and works this way on the job is  
</I>&gt;<i> better than someone who only knows what they have been shown to do.  
</I>&gt;<i> Syntax examples of most things are only a few clicks away.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the very least, a candidate should walk away from the interview  
</I>&gt;<i> feeling that they were actually being evaluated for what they would  
</I>&gt;<i> have  to do on the job. If they had difficulty it would be obvious 
</I>to  
&gt;<i> them on what areas they need to improve on and realize why they  
</I>&gt;<i> weren't offered a job. As for the hiring manager, you want to feel  
</I>&gt;<i> confident that the person you hire can do the real job and if they  
</I>&gt;<i> have successfully demonstrated performing small work tasks you will  
</I>&gt;<i> know for sure.
