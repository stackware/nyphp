<PRE>A note on this thread in general:
Please keep it clean and the one-line responses to a minimum, or take them
off-list - there's too much traffic for posts that don't have real content.


Hi Kristina, et al,

Wow, what a thread... I remember a similar one years ago, and obviously
these types of issues are still preeminent - regardless of the economy.

I agree Kristina - there is a mismatch between the underlying importance of
IT workers (notably developers, architectures, etc) and their recognition,
reward, and appreciation (yes, cry for us, Argentina).

As many of us probably do, I have an ear on the start-up, entrepreneurial
and &quot;Silicon Alley&quot; crowd as it's often coined.  What's always surprising,
and frankly somewhat amusing, is that through the technology start-up
process - concept development, prototyping, funding, implementation - the
technology people are often secondary, and even trivialized.  Typically the
importance of the technology - and the technical aspects of the project -
are given only grunt recognition, not much beyond that of a ditch digger (no
offense the ditch diggers on the list).  Then, once a company enters a more
mature phase - like revenue - these same companies now struggle to find good
technical talent in order to scale and sustain themselves.

That said, there are consistently good looking jobs out there - just look at
the NYPHP-Jobs list.  Anyone who really wanted a good job, could get one -
the PHP job market is extremely tight - and even in this rocky economy, a
good developer can call their price.  And if you're dealing with one of
those start-ups that was annoying last year, like in any job market,
sometimes you have to swallow your pride.

</I>&gt;<i> Tom --
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The average corporate attorney makes $200K.  The average attorney in
</I>&gt;<i> business for themselves makes about the same.  The average CPA, about
</I>&gt;<i> 150K.  The average doctor, electrician, etc. etc. etc...way more than
</I>&gt;<i> we do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The AVERAGE programmer makes, what, 80K if on salary?  (I'm self
</I>&gt;<i> employed and the hourly rate I can get from the clients is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> constricted by the market, and I'm trying to bust open that 100K
</I>&gt;<i> barrier but it won't be busted...I'm still on the losing end.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And you don't feel this is an ISSUE?  You don't honestly feel that the
</I>&gt;<i> social status of the IT profession needs some improvement, that most of
</I>&gt;<i> us are underpaid?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Come on, work with us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -- Kristina
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Guys, I have to be honest, this  &quot;Webmaster test&quot; and its associated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; threads are a train wreck for me.  I can't stop reading them,
</I>&gt;<i> although
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; admittedly I find them ridiculous.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do believe in the saying, &quot;if you don't have something nice to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say...&quot; which is why I haven't commented thus far, but if this email
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; below is flamebait, then, well, you got me (and no, I'm not the type
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to fall for Rick Rolls).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Connected with the low social status of IT&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I've got a PhD and I can't even manage a middle class existence?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I see two things that suck about careers in IT:  (1) the pay&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you kidding me?  Listen, I don't know you or your status, but
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not the life I've lived through my career in technology or the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perception I have of the industry, nor is it that of my friends and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; colleagues.  I mean no disrespect, but have you actually tried
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To be fair, IT is a very general term, and I suspect you might be in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the more traditional definition of it, meaning corporate LAN support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the like.  But for web engineers, this should not be the case,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; despite the recession.  To be blunt, I have friends and colleagues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with multiple offers, from the &quot;big guys&quot;.  The recruiters are
</I>&gt;<i> calling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and messaging on the social networking sites daily.  So, to paint the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; picture that this field is disintegrating, or not really a
</I>&gt;<i> profession,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or whatever, to lurkers, newbies and veterans alike is just plain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As for that 3 comment I flagged, well, I do agree with the 2nd point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you listed there.  That does suck.  But, then again, you see that in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; every industry.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And for those yearning for a life of state licensing and unions,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; please be careful what you wish for.  The same system that protects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many also keeps many others out of work.  Ask a Long Island K-12
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; teacher why they can't get a job even though they are at the top of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their field.  Ask any contractor that has to compete on the lowest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible price because they are bound by law to do things a certain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way with certain tools with certain procedures.  They've commoditized
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their industries and now can't differentiate themselves from others
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their field.  And, when was the last time you saw any real innovation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in those fields that made its way to us?  I'm still turning on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lights the same way my parents did.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     I'm a member of the ACM,  although I don't know why.  There's a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of handwringing in &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; about the state of
</I>&gt;<i> the IT job markets...  Is it expanding or contracting?  Why aren't more
</I>&gt;<i> women in IT?  It sounds like &quot;blah blah blah&quot; to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     You hear a lot of talk about the threat of outsourcing to US IT
</I>&gt;<i> jobs...  The way I see it,  outsourcing doesn't cause unemployment for
</I>&gt;<i> IT workers but it does lower our pay and it does lower our social
</I>&gt;<i> status -- which is the point people don't talk about.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     I see two things that suck about careers in IT:  (1) the pay,
</I>&gt;<i> and (2) working for people who don't know what they hell they're doing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     I'm not going to complain about my current situation,  which is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much what I need at this point in my life,  but,  like a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> people in IT,  I've worked at a string of crazy places.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     IT jobs pay better than working for Wal*Mart,  but my brother-
</I>&gt;<i> in-law,  who works as a foreman on a construction site,  gets paid
</I>&gt;<i> better than me -- despite the fact that I've got twice the education
</I>&gt;<i> and skills that seem to be rare and in demand...  (It's always seemed
</I>&gt;<i> that way no matter which side of the table I've sit at in job
</I>&gt;<i> interviews)  Construction workers have a union,  but IT people don't
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     Last summer I was a contractor at a company that had a great
</I>&gt;<i> culture,  great clients and was working with interesting and fun
</I>&gt;<i> technology.  I got offered a job that had a big 401K (makes wall street
</I>&gt;<i> rich) and the potential for a large bonus,  but no health insurance.  I
</I>&gt;<i> mean,  I've got a PhD and I can't even manage a middle class existence?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     The work I do takes as much training,  skill and independent
</I>&gt;<i> thought as being a doctor,  a lawyer or accountant -- but I don't get
</I>&gt;<i> paid accordingly and I don't get the respect...  For a while I worked
</I>&gt;<i> at a place that hosted a talk by the author of a book called &quot;Leading
</I>&gt;<i> Geeks&quot; -- could anybody get away with writing a book about &quot;Leading
</I>&gt;<i> Niggers?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     Connected with the low social status of IT,  there's the whole
</I>&gt;<i> problem of taking orders from people who don't know what's going on...
</I>&gt;<i> There are certainly some counterexamples...  Certainly some places that
</I>&gt;<i> know what time it is,  but there's a reason why so many people feel
</I>&gt;<i> like Dilbert.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  &lt;/rant&gt;
