<PRE>This is quite a strong summation.

Yet, fortunately, there is some types of accreditation for some
programming and related categories. There is Microsoft MSCE, Cisco
Certified, general network certifications, Oracle cert, Red Hat cert,
security cert, Zend PHP cert, even a Flash cert. 

So, maybe if firms and sites (PHP.net and all such related sites)
started advocating cert programs as one of, if not the first serious
step, toward an evolving measurable genuine industry competency and
competitiveness that would help programmers more effectively work
towards and achieve known knowledge levels that might have nationally
known pay scales.

Then a programmer could plan a career and salary objectives a little
more logically. And businesses could budget and allocate programmer
workforce more exactly.

Somewhere, something is all good and better than the existing free for
all.

&gt;&gt;<i>  By definition, programming and website design is not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>profession.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Really? What specifically is that definition?
</I>
profession: &quot;An occupation, such as law, medicine, or engineering, 
that requires considerable training
and specialized study&quot;

Houghton Mifflin Dictionary.

Even an engineer must have a professional engineering (PE) 
designation to perform certain types of design.
I don't have a problem with a self taught programmers, I've known 
some great ones, however, a field having
a large number of practitioners without formal training is a trade 
not a profession. A profession is also
self-regulated.

It's another thread but, should there be certification available for 
programmers and web designers? If we
ever want to be considered a profession, that's the first step. I was 
in the stock brokerage business when
the designation Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) first came into 
being. It was extraordinarily difficult
and it took almost two years after the announcement before the first 
designation were awarded. It required
two 8 hour day testing sessions. It made a huge difference in the 
industry and these days you will not get
a senior level job in a research department without a CFA. Same thing 
happened with Chartered Financial
Planner (CFP).

I'm unsure of the procedure, but how/when does one change the subject 
when we have drifted into a new
area?
