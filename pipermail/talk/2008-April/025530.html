<PRE>Ajai, I think you misunderstood grossly several points I was trying to 
make.

i.e.
&gt;<i> I could also argue that any programmer who has used several 
</I>&gt;<i> programming languages would have those skills regardless of whether 
</I>they 
&gt;<i> took liberal arts courses or not. It comes with experience.
</I>
(I hope you would not waste your time &quot;arguing&quot; over something so 
glaringly obvious.  My point was that these skills are learnable in 
different ways, not just through a CS major).

Also, in case you are not familiar, public high schools in the US do 
not charge &quot;fees&quot; -- but are supported by government funds and tax 
dollars from property taxes -- and the school administration can make 
policies about which classes are open to which students, and they were 
within their rights at the time to refuse enrollment in certain classes 
to female students.  They also required at that time &quot;home economics&quot; 
for girls and &quot;shop classes&quot; for boys.  We were not allowed to choose 
which one we wanted, but were assigned based on gender.
