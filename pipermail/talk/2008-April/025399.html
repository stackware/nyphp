<PRE>You have a valid point about the state certs...which could be 
problematic...however, I do take exception with your characterization 
of liberal arts courses and degrees as &quot;garbage&quot;...as a non-CS major 
who is now in the field and also as someone who believes STRONGLY in 
the &quot;non-vocational, liberal arts model of post-secondary education&quot; 
(i.e. the university is NOT a vocational school).

&gt;<i> Kristina Anderson wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Industry certifications are all well and good but state-certified 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; professional licenses would be a huge step forward.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just think how cool it would be to have a &quot;NYS Licensed Code 
</I>Jockey&quot; 
&gt;<i> &gt; certificate in a huge frame on your office wall :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not to mention the economic &amp; lobbying power that state 
</I>professional 
&gt;<i> &gt; organizations have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like it is with electricians? No way! An electrician licensed in Mass 
</I>is not 
&gt;<i> allowed to install a wall outlet in NYS. I wonder why? Are the 
</I>outlets 
&gt;<i> different? Does NYS use a totally different form of electrical power? 
</I>So with 
&gt;<i> a state license for coders you can code PHP in NYS, but nobody is 
</I>allowed to 
&gt;<i> run that on an out-of-state server?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Certs are something to get hired into a position, but they have the 
</I>advantage 
&gt;<i> to be more specialized. Unlike a bachelor's degree. 2/3rd of the 
</I>study time 
&gt;<i> are wasted for English, history, art, and whatever else non-major 
</I>garbage the 
&gt;<i> universities make students take. Some universities may be better than 
</I>others 
&gt;<i> and thus offer better bachelor programs, but the most are nothing 
</I>more than 
&gt;<i> mainly catching up what high school didn't bother to teach. I really 
</I>don't get 
&gt;<i> why a bachelor student has to read &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; for the nth 
</I>time when 
&gt;<i> majoring in CS.
</I>&gt;<i> I got by BS from a german university and 30 courses and labs were on-
</I>topic, 
&gt;<i> with 3 electives venturing into less subject related areas. I took 
</I>mass 
&gt;<i> communication, work safety and technical English. I went on to 
</I>getting an MS 
&gt;<i> at a US university and there was really only one course that didn't 
</I>consist of 
&gt;<i> brainless busy work, but challenged one's mind and had one think. 
</I>Without 
&gt;<i> doubt, that was the course I learned most.
</I>&gt;<i>  From that view point I think certifications are a good thing, but it 
</I>depends. 
&gt;<i> There are certs for QA folks and tech writers and I think the vast 
</I>majority of 
&gt;<i> people working in those trades (it's not a profession, isn't it?) 
</I>don't have 
&gt;<i> any and don't plan on getting them. Especially for tech writing, 
</I>getting a 
&gt;<i> cert is something recommended for those who were car mechanics before 
</I>or horse 
&gt;<i> racing judges that didn't make it into FEMA.
</I>&gt;<i> Certs are a proof that you are capable of systematic learning and 
</I>performing 
&gt;<i> when needed, just like a bachelor, master, or doctoral degree. It 
</I>doesn't say 
&gt;<i> anything how qualified one is for the job and thus shouldn't be 
</I>generally a 
&gt;<i> requirement unless loss of life and property are directly dependent 
</I>on that 
&gt;<i> accuracy of the work. So having a national cert for an electrician is 
</I>OK, 
&gt;<i> which would include training on special regional requirements (such 
</I>as piping 
&gt;<i> all lines up to the 10th floor in NYC) and how to go about obtaining 
</I>&gt;<i> information about regional regulations. Interestingly enough, there 
</I>is no 
&gt;<i> certification required for someone to work on your car breaks.
