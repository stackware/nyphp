<PRE>To clarify two things re: the below response:

1.  I most definitely DO NOT WANT TO LEGISLATE pay scales for 
programmers (not even sure where anyone got the idea that I did!).  I 
feel we need to improve the SOCIAL STATUS of the field, so that market 
rates increase in and of themselves.

2.  I cannot &quot;quit my job and find another one&quot;, because I'm self 
employed.  Me is counting on me to show up for work!! :)

-- Kristina

--------------------

&gt;<i> &quot;I want to be a programmer.  I just want to get paid what my skills
</I>&gt;<i> are WORTH as a programmer.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a hobby economist I have to respond to this one. :D
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds to me like you'd like to legislate what you're worth. That
</I>&gt;<i> approach causes even more problems than it solves because it means a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of people who could be employed at lower rates will now be
</I>&gt;<i> unemployable, period. We are all worth what the market says we're
</I>&gt;<i> worth. If demand for talented developers is high, and supply is low
</I>&gt;<i> (as I've seen here in NYC) then you'll be paid handsomely. If demand
</I>&gt;<i> is low, and supply is high, then you'll be paid very little.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you believe you are worth more than you're currently getting - than
</I>&gt;<i> quit! Find another job that pays you what you're looking for. I know
</I>&gt;<i> from experience that there are 100k+ jobs out there for *good* PHP
</I>&gt;<i> developers (granted, it's my personal belief that it takes a little
</I>&gt;<i> more than just developer skills to hit that mark, but they *are* out
</I>&gt;<i> there).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dictating by government fiat what a &quot;programmer&quot; should make only
</I>&gt;<i> exacerbates the problem by leaving all those sub-par developers out in
</I>&gt;<i> the cold - completely unemployable in their industry. With that
</I>&gt;<i> prospect, average developers will never even have the chance to become
</I>&gt;<i> above-average.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tom, like a lot of the folks on this list, I'm a PHP programmer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  developing internet applications (coding forms, building MySQL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  databases, meeting with clients to determine requirements, etc. 
</I>etc.).
&gt;<i> &gt;  I've been doing this (in different languages and platforms) for 10
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  years and in PHP for the past 2 years (and love PHP!).  I do this 
</I>for a
&gt;<i> &gt;  living because I like doing it, I'd probably be better off in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  retirement if I went to law school in the near future but I don't 
</I>want
&gt;<i> &gt;  to do this.  I want to be a programmer.  I just want to get paid 
</I>what
&gt;<i> &gt;  my skills are WORTH as a programmer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I'd love to charge my clients more.  And I've recently gotten wise 
</I>to
&gt;<i> &gt;  opportunities where clients are able to offer me part ownership of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  startups in addition to hourly consulting rates.  But...I do think 
</I>that
&gt;<i> &gt;  clients price things out and give bids to people who charge 
</I>reasonable
&gt;<i> &gt;  rates.  There is a reason I get 90% of the projects I bid on.  If I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  asked for $100 an hour, that would be great, but $100 an hour for 0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  hours is, well....zero dollars.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  As a self employed person I'd love to hear any real, usable 
</I>suggestions
&gt;<i> &gt;  on how to increase income.  My network is great and I have tons of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  projects going, business is growing every day as I meet new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  people...but the market does price at a certain level and if I 
</I>start
&gt;<i> &gt;  asking for more than people can afford, or more than others with my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  same skills are getting paid...I am not going to get hired.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Your libertarian jawflap about how Social Security is  &quot;hurting 
</I>us&quot; (I
&gt;<i> &gt;  disagree) and how the market is totally open for me to charge 
</I>whatever
&gt;<i> &gt;  I want are well...interesting theory and pretty typical politics 
</I>for a
&gt;<i> &gt;  certain segment of the IT industry...but.  And saying I &quot;look to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  others&quot; to &quot;solve my problems&quot; is beyond a low blow, it's just too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  stupid a remark to even rebut.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;  The average corporate attorney makes $200K.  The average 
</I>attorney
&gt;<i> &gt;  in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;  business for themselves makes about the same.  The average 
</I>CPA,
&gt;<i> &gt;  about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  150K.  The average doctor, electrician, etc. etc. etc...way 
</I>more
&gt;<i> &gt;  than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;  we do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; I have what I consider to be more than average experience with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; electricians and they are nice folks, but hardly what I'd call 
</I>on the
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; top of the &quot;social status&quot; scale and I would question what the 
</I>average
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; salary was, but I doubt your numbers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; Really, I doubt your &quot;average&quot;.  But it doesn't matter.  You 
</I>make what
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; you do because that is what you are willing to work for.  
</I>Suppose the
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; floor fell out of IT tomorrow (literally), and the going rate 
</I>for PHP
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; was $10 per hour.  Would you still do it?  Maybe for fun, but 
</I>not as a
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; job.  Why?  Because you won't work for that little.  You couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; survive.  But you can survive on $80K (or whatever), so you do 
</I>it.
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; When you decide that $80K isn't enough, you'll stop working for 
</I>that
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; much.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;  The AVERAGE programmer makes, what, 80K if on salary?  (I'm 
</I>self
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;  employed and the hourly rate I can get from the clients is 
</I>pretty
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;  constricted by the market, and I'm trying to bust open that 
</I>100K
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;  barrier but it won't be busted...I'm still on the losing end.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; Look at your market.  The &quot;big&quot; consulting firms charge much 
</I>more and
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; pay their people much more.  How come they are getting it and 
</I>you are
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; not?  That's the question you need to ask.  You shouldn't be 
</I>looking
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; for protection from the marketplace, you should be looking for 
</I>ways to
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; excel in it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;  Come on, work with us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; I am, really!  I'm telling you to not look to others to solve 
</I>your
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; problem - it won't help.  Look at things Social Security and 
</I>pension
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; plans.  These systems put the burden on others - and they both 
</I>have
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; severe flaws which are hurting us now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; Look at what you can do to excel.  How are your sales efforts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; (speaking for myself in my experience as a consultant - I always
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; dreaded sales, but recently realized that it needs to be 
</I>embraced, not
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; feared)?  Professional networking?  Who is your customer?  Are 
</I>their
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; pockets deep enough?  Are you really taking advantage of your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; expertise (are you doing graphics when you are really a DBA at 
</I>heart)?
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;  How can you get the work done faster?  Can you invest in tools 
</I>(store
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; bought or that you create) to help?  Invest in services?  
</I>People?  Can
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; you reuse code?  Are you tracking problems so that you don't 
</I>make the
&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; same mistake again?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; There are answers, but no one just pays more for your 
</I>services &quot;just
&gt;<i> &gt;  because&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;
