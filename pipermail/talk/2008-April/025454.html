<PRE>Nope, I think MOST of you are full of sh*t. Unfortunately, such is the bell curve of life &#8211; 7 out of every ten people fall below the curve. Two of the three in the upper half are respectable. And then there&#8217;s the one. The one out of every ten who can outperform them all with his or her eyes closed. That one person is the difference maker. That is the person hiring managers will pay for. That is who I struggle day in, day out to find.

 

Critiquing the website accomplishes nothing, both you and I can sit and complain about corporate marketing departments all day long. Although I will certainly forward your comments along to the responsible parties as valuable input. But that&#8217;s neither here nor there.

 

Regardless of what is on the website, or how it comes across, the &#8220;real picture&#8221; is that I am pushing hard &#8211; with everything I&#8217;ve got - to change the face of an industry here, an exciting industry that is full of opportunities to learn and exploit emerging technologies, where the development staff is the crown jewel of the company (<A HREF="http://www.cio.com/article/194600">http://www.cio.com/article/194600</A>), and where the opportunities to double or triple in size are everywhere. Believe me, it doesn&#8217;t get much further away from &#8220;corporate boredom and politics&#8221; than this J

 

That said, --rada--, are you the one in ten? Who can come in and change a company, change an industry, with nothing but a computer, creativity, intellectual curiosity, and sheer determination? If so, come in and call me out J

 

Come see for yourself what I am talking about. 

 

I am - graciously - holding out a brass ring here for a true programming talent. All they have to do is take it.

To Jason @ InnovationAds.com

 

Jason, from the tone of your email, you think we developers are full of sh*t. If I understand correctly, you can&#8217;t get a decent resume across your desk and you are frustrated and desperate to find people to work in &#8220;perhaps the best environment you&#8217;ve seen in NY&#8221;. 

 

The real picture seems a little different however.

 

According to your website, you don&#8217;t have any technology jobs:

HYPERLINK &quot;<A HREF="http://jobs.innovationads.com/technology">http://jobs.innovationads.com/technology</A>&quot;<A HREF="http://jobs.innovationads.com/technology">http://jobs.innovationads.com/technology</A>

 

And here is just a sample of a long, long list of empty cliches from your employment page. You&#8217;d think this was a draft for an article in The Onion: dynamic company, exponential growth, success based on high quality products and services at a low cost , constantly looking for ways to improve in the ways we deliver services, market leader connecting thousands of consumers with businesses every day, multi-faceted organization , believes in maintaining high standards in everything we do, the better we are the better we serve our clients, dedicated to hiring the best in the industry, workforce geared toward achieving even higher levels of success, strong commitment to diversity, diversity helps us meet and exceed our customers' needs, diversity is vital and necessary to our success in providing quality products and services for our clients, committed to helping the environment by carrying out a set of principals which are aligned with the Company&#8217;s mission, etc. etc. etc.

 

Sorry to be so harsh, but do you honestly think the above paints a good picture for prospective candidates? Your website is the first place we are going to look and it just screams corporate boredom and politics. If it were one percent as passionate and human as your post, perhaps you&#8217;d have a better success rate.
