<PRE>Good call,

I love to read. Read all the time. Just read your email and I'm going to 
read a book.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's actually not true, and your apparent belief in this untruth is 
</I>&gt;<i> probably what has led to your seemingly very strongly felt distaste 
</I>&gt;<i> for university education.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The purpose of a college or university is to provide the student with 
</I>&gt;<i> an education, so that the student may go on to contribute back to 
</I>&gt;<i> society.  An education involves more than just learning a trade, or a 
</I>&gt;<i> skill.  Moreover, most experts in any field are usually well-versed in 
</I>&gt;<i> some other field as well; this is what allows educated people to do 
</I>&gt;<i> things like draw analogies, or relate to non-technical people.  
</I>&gt;<i> Physicists must read the classics in English literature so that 
</I>&gt;<i> non-physicists will talk to them at dinner parties; this helps with 
</I>&gt;<i> things like professional networking.  (Everyone who got your job 
</I>&gt;<i> because you know the right non-IT person, raise your hands.  David, 
</I>&gt;<i> look at all those hands!)  No one expects a physicist to be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> prattle on about Huck Finn like a lit professor; but the physicist 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't just stare open-mouthed, either.  &quot;Yes, Mark Twain was an 
</I>&gt;<i> important figure in American Literature&quot; will go a long, long way in 
</I>&gt;<i> making friends and influencing people.  And an English major should 
</I>&gt;<i> take a lab science course for the exact same reason; in case he finds 
</I>&gt;<i> himself at a dinner party populated mostly by physicists, knowing at 
</I>&gt;<i> least that there's an inverse relationship between distance and 
</I>&gt;<i> gravitational pull, even if the English major doesn't remember or 
</I>&gt;<i> understand that it's an exponential relationship, can keep him in the 
</I>&gt;<i> conversation long enough to not be embarrassed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When my programming students complain (and they always do) about how 
</I>&gt;<i> much of their grade is based on writing, I tell them two things.  
</I>&gt;<i> First, when I worked in industry as a programmer, the pointy-haired 
</I>&gt;<i> bosses kept coming to me for explanations, and eventually asked me to 
</I>&gt;<i> join large inter-department teams to work on big special projects with 
</I>&gt;<i> all the suits, and eventually would have asked me to lead those kinds 
</I>&gt;<i> of special projects had I stayed with that company any longer; and the 
</I>&gt;<i> reason they kept tapping me, over my colleagues, was that I was an 
</I>&gt;<i> effective communicator, and I was able to translate plans to code, and 
</I>&gt;<i> feature requests to timetables, but also code to English, and bug 
</I>&gt;<i> hunts to revised timetables; and I didn't scare the suits away when I 
</I>&gt;<i> talked to them.  And I owe that to my liberal-arts undergrad 
</I>&gt;<i> experience, taking a BA in CS, with a creative writing course and a 
</I>&gt;<i> public speaking course and all the trimmings.  I even made use of 
</I>&gt;<i> something I learned in a phys ed course, when I was tutoring a 
</I>&gt;<i> seventh-grader in math last school year.  He really wanted to shoot 
</I>&gt;<i> baskets more than do math problems, and so I gave him five minutes if 
</I>&gt;<i> he got a few questions right.  Of course he got those questions right, 
</I>&gt;<i> and off we went to shoot baskets.  But he had a great deal of trouble 
</I>&gt;<i> passing me the basketball, and I taught him the bounce pass, the way I 
</I>&gt;<i> learned it as a college junior.  His mom kept hiring me back to tutor 
</I>&gt;<i> him, because he really liked me after that (and the grades slowly went 
</I>&gt;<i> up).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing I tell my students is that out there in the real 
</I>&gt;<i> world, where all you guys are, people judge other people's 
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence, fairly or not, according to how effectively they 
</I>&gt;<i> communicate, and that the only two things that make you a better 
</I>&gt;<i> writer are 1) writing a lot, and 2) reading a lot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, anyway, I felt compelled to write, because I'm afraid that people 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to choose whether to get a college education or not might be 
</I>&gt;<i> misled into thinking it's something it's not.  The service we provide 
</I>&gt;<i> is not something you can get anywhere else, and for lots of people, 
</I>&gt;<i> it's the difference between promotions or not.
</I>&gt;<i> $0.02,
</I>&gt;<i> -c
