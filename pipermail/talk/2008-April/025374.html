My personal take on all this is that &quot;process&quot; testing is more useful than 
&quot;memory&quot; testing. In other words, a good developer, systems administrator 
or tech support person should be able to demonstrate or talk through the 
process they would use to solve a particular problem. Even if it 
meant using Google, or searching a mailing list archive or even 
just looking it up in a book. &quot;Memory&quot; testing OTOH, where you're asked to 
regurgitate facts that you have memorized are not terribly useful tests. 

I was once in an interview where I was asking to list all the different 
kinds of RAID and what they're used for. (At the time I had been working 
for an ISP for about 5 years as a systems administrator). I know what RAID 
is and how its used because Id been using it. But damned if I knew ALL of 
the different kinds of RAID off the top of my head because certain types 
of RAID are commonly used and some are not used very much (if at all!).

The same company conducted two hour-long phone interviews with me (yeah, 
it was a bit excessive looking back on it now :-) which I did very well on 
because they were like conversations where I was given a scenario and 
asked to explain the theory and/or walk through a process.

For me, if I were hiring someone, its more important they know WHERE and 
HOW to look for an answer. A good memory doesn't mean you necessarily 
understand anything.
