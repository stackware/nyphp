<PRE>Thanks to all who have replied and commented to my questions. To Tim and
Dave, thanks for the input - your comments have all helped me to understand
quite a few things about the encryption. I think I've just graduated
encryption 101:) with much more to learn. Again, thanks for everyones
feedback!

Joe

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The missing piece of info I guess I did not realize is that if I encrypt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some drive or part of it like folders or some system volume that I had to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have the decryption keys as part of it. I thought the keys was encrypted as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well. And, the only time it could be decrypted is by me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, If I wanted to modify and update the encrypted data I would then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download it back to my machine and decrypt it and make whatever changes and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upload it back to the server. While uploading and downloading the data it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already in encrypted form.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds correct.  In this scenario, you're just using the server as a
</I>&gt;<i> file server.  Since your data are encrypted before leaving your machine, you
</I>&gt;<i> don't need to worry about encrypting it (again) in transit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And, my understanding was that new data that is saved/updated by users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be encrypted on the fly. Encrypted data that leaves the server would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be decrypted BUT then with SSL only the user would see the requested data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This was my understanding of what tools like TrueCrypt does. So, I think I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; totally missing the point of the product.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> This is where things get tricky.  If your users are submitting data (over
</I>&gt;<i> SSL), and the server is encrypting it for storage, you can use a symmetric
</I>&gt;<i> key pair, with only the encryption key on the server (you keep the
</I>&gt;<i> decryption key secure at your location).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Things break down, however, when you want to give other users access to
</I>&gt;<i> the data.  Now, the server needs to decrypt the data before sending it
</I>&gt;<i> (which involves encrypting it via SSL, but you need unencrypted data to feed
</I>&gt;<i> to the SSL mechanism).  Now, even with symmetric keys, you need both keys on
</I>&gt;<i> the server.  Once you have encrypted data + the decryption key on the
</I>&gt;<i> server, the encryption is meaningless, since if anyone compromises the
</I>&gt;<i> server, they have all the information they need to decrypt the original
</I>&gt;<i> data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, if you're trying to communicate sensitive information via a web
</I>&gt;<i> based application, you want to look at the following areas:
</I>&gt;<i>   - The host security of the server.  Is the box hardened?  Are you
</I>&gt;<i> running old, vulnerable versions of server software?  Do you have a strong
</I>&gt;<i> password policy, or are you using SSH keys for authentication? Do you trust
</I>&gt;<i> the people who have physical possession of the server?
</I>&gt;<i>   - The security of whatever web-based application is managing the data.
</I>&gt;<i>  If I can break your web-app, then I can steal your data (even if it's
</I>&gt;<i> encrypteded on disk!)
</I>&gt;<i>   - The protocol security of the protocols used to communicate with the
</I>&gt;<i> server.  You should be using SSL (for web) and SSH (for shell access and
</I>&gt;<i> file transfer services) -- otherwise you run the risk of a man-in-the-middle
</I>&gt;<i> stealing your passwords, and subsequently your data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If those three areas are properly addressed, you should be fine.
</I>&gt;<i> If the data is encrypted on disk, that's fine -- but as soon as one of the
</I>&gt;<i> above three is broken, your on-disk encryption is essentially worthless.
</I>&gt;<i>  Which of course means that before any of those are broken, it's probably
</I>&gt;<i> meaninglessly redundant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note, there's a forth concern: The security of the people who are allowed
</I>&gt;<i> access.  Are you sure that user X isn't actually a spy.  This gets into the
</I>&gt;<i> Authorization problem, which is probably going to get handled in your web
</I>&gt;<i> app.  If you can limit people to accessing only the data they need, you
</I>&gt;<i> limit your exposure.  This is a non-trivial problem, but there's a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> good reading you can do about it.
