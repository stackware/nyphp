If your referring page is a form of some sort, you can also consider
using hidden input fields to pass the data to the forwarded page via the
POST method. 

<input type=hidden name=hiddenvar value="Hidden Value">

Would result in $hiddenvar being available in the forwarded page with
the string "Hidden Value".
This is straight out of a book so I don't know if there are some
practical things to avoid in doing this, nor if it is possible to use
without a form being submited on the referrer page. 

Felix.

Stephen,

	Sessions are OK, I guess, if you really need to keep sending
the data around, but keep in mind then, that all of that POST data
will get sent back-and-forth between the server and browser for each
successive page-load.  And if you do a "Location:" redirect, that
will of course count as two page loads, so that is conceivably a
waste of time and bandwidth.  Depending how your server is configured,
the additional HTTP transaction from the server might be costly if 
you do it a lot, or if your server is already busy.

	So you said you don't want to "embed" the 2nd script into
the first one... why not just "include" it?  That way, the only
additional cost of the "redirect" is reading and executing that
file... no extra HTTP noise (which in some cases could slow things
down by more than a few seconds per page hit).

	Overall, it sounds like you might be moving toward
building one single "library" file of your functions, and then your
"scripts" would include this library and call whatever functions it
needs.

	Also, I don't know how much data is getting POSTed, but if
it's more than a few hundred characters (or has the potential to be),
you might have problems doing Location: redirects with all that data.
I could explain this further if it doesn't make sense.


Bestest,

If you used session_start() and related functions, you have
options to use server files, server memory, or a custom handler
to store your session variables - rather than cookies. It might 
only be a matter of editing php.ini.

I thought this was covered quite well in "Web Database 
Applications with PHP & MySQL" by Williams & Lane (O'Reilly). 
They even have an appendix on how to write your own handler to 
store your session vars in a database.

The chapter covering Sessions is online:

Thanks so much. I'll take a look at it.

After this I have to study variable scope some more.

Message-ID: <330E74F5-3631-11D7-BAC8-000393A95C72@anapraxis.com>


Reading from inside out, here is what seems to be happening:

1. get_html_translation_table(HTML_ENTITIES)
This returns an associative array of the entities used in the  
HTML_ENTITIES translation table.

2. array_flip
This takes the associative array returned by get_html_translation_table  
above and swaps the values and keys of that array, so what was once a  
key is now a value.

3. strtr
In this case you are using the newer option for strtr that allows you  
to pass in an initial string ($stuffArray[$i][value]), and have the  
character values in that string translated based on the associative  
array returned by the array_flip step above.

So it looks to me like this line is converting translated entities into  
their original character counterpart. To see exactly what it is doing,  
try taking that same line:

> $stuffArray[$i][value] = strtr($stuffArray[$i][value],  
> array_flip(get_html_translation_table(HTML_ENTITIES)));

changing it to:

$oldString = "&lt;<this is a test>&gt;";
$newString = strtr($oldString,  
array_flip(get_html_translation_table(HTML_ENTITIES)));

And see how it comes out. I get:
<<this is a test>>

Wes



Essentially this is just converting characters in the string located at  
$stuffArray[$i][value] and replacing the old string with the newly  
"cleaned" string.

It converts HTML entities back to their original characters. Where
htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() will take characters like <, >,
and & and turn them into &lt;, &gt;, and &amp, the code you have will
take those entities and turn them back into <, >, and &. 

It's all explained on the get_html_translation_table() manual page, if
you care to read the manual.

I posted this message a few days ago, but no response.

Has anyone here upgraded to 4.3? Did it work well for you?

George,
If I "include"/"require" this file, can I still access $HTTP_POST_VARS[] 
values without a session.
(I have to use $HTTP_POST_VARS[], because _POST[] isn't supported on the 
server I'm on).

I just want to access a $HTTP_POST_VARS[] variable on the second page 
for use in a hidden form.

Could you explain this?  I thought you couldn't pass any data using 
header("Location: ").
I'm still inexperienced with PHP, so I need an explanation.

Thanks for your help.

	Sure; all global variables are still available to include()'d 
and/or require()'d scripts.  $HTTP_XXX_VARS, however, does require the
"global" declaration if you use it inside the scope of a function.
In more recent versions, the $_POST, $_GET, etc. arrays are "superglobals"
which means you don't have to use the "global" declaration with them;
they're available everywhere.  Plus, $_POST is much easier to type.

	This is actually the difference between the GET and POST method
for HTTP.  You know how your HTML form can have an METHOD of either "GET"
or "POST".  If it's GET, your browser simply (?) throws all the fields
together and puts them on the end of your ACTION URL.  Example:

<FORM METHOD=GET ACTION="http://yourserver.com/form-handler.php">
Name: <INPUT NAME="myname" SIZE=20> <BR>
Question: <TEXTAREA NAME="myquestion" COLS=30 ROWS=8></TEXTAREA> <BR>
<INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="Submit Question">
</FORM>

	If the user types in their name ("George") and their question
("Help!!!"), then the browser would use the regular old HTTP GET method
to get the following URL:

http://yourserver.com/form-handler.php?myname=George&myquestion=Help%21%21%21

	As you can see the form data is simply (?) appended to the
, after a question-mark, and separated by ampersands.  Each element, also,
is url-encoded, e.g. exclamation points become %21.

	You could also type this same string into a web browser to
see the exact same effect.

	On the other hand, if you change that example to use METHOD=POST,
then the browser issues a POST request instead of a GET request to the
server, and the requested URL would be simply 
http://yourserver.com/form-handler.php.  Nothing appended to the URL.  Then
the form data is assembled in the same simple (?) way in the body of the
HTTP request, which users typically never see.

	So, to answer your question, the reason you should use POST requests
with a large amount of data is because if you used GET, the URL would become
too long for the server.  In this example, if the user typed a really long
question (or pasted a really long string like a RFC document), the server
would probably barf after reading about 1000 characters from the URL.  If
you use POST, there is not such a limitation to the length of the submitted
form data.

	There are other reasons also why you might not want to use GET method
requests for forms.  One is server logs typically store the entire request
URL, so in a shared ownership environment where everyone can view each other's
server logs, everyone can see all the other users' submitted data.  Privacy
issue.

	Another issue is caching pages when browsers navigate backwards --
browsers are more likely to silently re-submit a form request with a GET method
than with a POST request.  So if you had a Form Mail script, for example, if
your users went back to the form page and then forward again, the data *might* be
submitted again (depending on some configuration settings).  With POST method,
browsers tend to confirm that the user really wants to re-POST, before it
just goes and sends all that data again.  In Netscape, the alert is something
like "Repost Form Data? [Cancel] [OK]".

	Another issue with redirects from a form-submit (GET or POST) is that
the posted data is not actually available to the redirected script.  So if you
post to /scriptA.php which does nothing except redirect to /scriptB.php, 
scriptB.php will not actually see the submitted data, unless scriptA.php sticks
it on the end of the redirected URL, like the browsers do.  Either way, the
redirected script will have to use the GET method, even if the browser request
was a POST method.

	Hope that's not too verbose; I just had a Code Red.


Most Bestly,

George,
If I had a function doThis(), do you mean...

function doThis() {
    global $HTTP_POST_VARS;
}

The server I'm on does not support $_POST, etc.  The version of PHP is 
older.

In the past, I typically used POST to avoid long URLs and revealing data 
in the URL.  So, I'm ok there.

This is good to know.  So redirection would only allow a GET method if I 
tell scriptA.php to add information to the URL  of the redirection.

Like this?
header("Location: scriptB.php?myname=George");

Is this what you mean?

Good explanations are perfectly fine by me.  The more I know, the safer 
the coding world will be. *grins*

Well I found a way around that problem, but changing the XML structure to be
valid XML was way too problematic considering:

1) the volume of XML files to change
2) the fact that other programs (Java, TCL, ASP) use those very same XML
files alongside PHP.

Messy, ain't it?

I modified the functions to work on your server. Include them in your
scripts and follow the instructions below.

function post_save() {
        global $HTTP_POST_VARS;
        global $HTTP_SESSION_VARS;
        if(count($HTTP_POST_VARS)) {
              $HTTP_SESSION_VARS['post_around'] = $HTTP_POST_VARS;
       }
}


function post_read() {
        global $HTTP_POST_VARS;
        global $HTTP_SESSION_VARS;
       if(!count($HTTP_POST_VARS) &&
isset($HTTP_SESSION_VARS['post_around']) ) {
              $HTTP_POST_VARS = $HTTP_SESSION_VARS['post_around'];
              unset($HTTP_SESSION_VARS['post_around']);
       }
}


Place this code near the top of each script (after the above function
definitions):

session_start();
post_read();

and this right before each header( 'Location: ...') call:

post_save();

That's all. Don't let anyone confuse you and make it seem more complicated
than it really is :)

I think file() was never meant to write at all.  It is meant for reading a 
file.  If it did, it would more be a bug.

George,
That's not really true.  Building a query string from POSTed data and
appending it to the url in the header('Location: ..') call is not the only
(and in fact ugly) 'solution'.  See my previous message for details.

As a matter of preference, I prefer not exposing any data to the URL.

So I can either...

1) require() or include() the second page, so $HTTP_POST_VARS[] is 
visible on the second page (George's idea)
or
2) create two utility functions and use sessioning to transfer data to 
the next page (Jerry's idea)

Or you can have the first php to generate an XML output. Then have the 
second PHP call the first php.  Read the XML from the second php.  Done.

As I posted earlier on this list, I am having problems with mysql_pconnect().
Hans et. al. pointed out that this is a known bug and has now (in cvs?) been
fixed.  FYI, I am on RH Linux 7.1, but this bug may be more affective than that.

	So you might check out bugs.php.net for version > 4.3.  That was a good
idea.

We in fact moved NYU's research application to 4.3 last week, and there has
been no indication of error.  While we don't use MySQL persistent
connections, spontaneous MySQL and Oracle connections are used heavily with
no problem.  There's also been no indication of error with all other
operations.  However, a check of:

http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-4.php

may be useful.

Subject: flooding + sessions
Message-ID: <000a01c2cacb$18caa220$de01a8c0@duron.lan.newageweb.com>

I've just realized that in case someone decides to flood my web server with
HTTP requests, the session.save_path directory on the server will get filled
with thousands or even millions of session files in no time. Each
session_start() will create a new unique file on the disk or an entry in a
session handling database table.  This can drastically slow down the server
even after the flood stops.  I deliberately flooded my development server
and noticed the number of session files kept increasing for the next several
minutes after I stop the flood.  I imagine it would cause a variety of other
problems as well.

While setting a high value (100) for session.gc_probability and reducing the
value for session.gc_maxlifetime to 300 (5 minutes) will limit the number of
files to as many as a flood attack can generate in 5 minutes, it will cause
the server to perform the 'garbage collection' routine upon every request,
which itself can be damaging to the server's performance. Besides
simultaneous flood attacks from multiple sources can easily amount to
hundreds of thousands of hits thus session files in just 5 minutes.

Can anyone think of a solution?  A code level solution would be nice but I
can't think of anything.
I believe this calls for a small change to the way PHP handles sessions.
While a session id and a cookie are generated upon establishing a new
session (session_start()), a session handling file should not be created
until a session variable is initialized ( $_SESSION =  or
session_register()).  With that in place, writing flood-proof code wouldn't
be hard at all.

Subject: Mono & PHP
Message-ID: <1044227590.7317.62.camel@hasele>

I spent a little time this weekend implementing an extension that allows
PHP to load .NET classes on the Unix environment - 100% open source, by
leveraging the mono library(*).  For more information, view the README
file in the distribution by downloading the file
http://www.edwardbear.org/php_mono_0_1.tar.gz.

Its PHP5 only, as that's what I've switched to for all new development.
Hi Ho.

<?php
$Console = new Mono('System.Console');
$Console->WriteLine('Hello World, PHP is .NET ready!');
?>

(*) Mono is much more than library, of course.  But it links to/uses the
mono library.

PS:  I'll be adding it into PECL in a little bit, I want to finish the
type proxying code.  I'd also like to add all of the object and method
caching.

PPS: If anyone has suggestions for a better way of doing type proxying
than what's described in the README, please let me know.

I read the code, quite nice!

It's been a while I was thinking to integrate Ruby into PHP, which would
probably be a very very similar extension as this one. Are they going to get
into the official PHP distr or PECL?

Subject: .ini config + *nix permissions 
Message-ID: <3E3DCF3C.8050003@ylayali.net>


Hi,

I've been going over my PHP configuration, and have a few questions 
mostly arising from my general newbieness to linux administration.

My setup consists of a bunch of VirtualHosts, all with pretty much the 
same configuration[1] and directory structure[2]. The development 
machine is running PHP 4.2.3 and the server machine 4.1.2 (debian 
backports 4.2.3-9 & 4.1.2-6 actually); the only difference between their 
configurations is the error handling.

I have a pretty conservative php.ini, figuring it's probably easier to 
never rely on register_globals etc from the start than to have to 
convert scripts later to run on some ISP's virtual host server. I 
incorporated most of the changes from php.ini-recommended (which came 
with the debian source package) & now I'm trying to isolate each of the 
vhosts as much as I can while sticking with mod_php. I plan to implement 
disk quotas so if one vhost goes haywire and starts a logging frenzy, it 
probably won't bring the whole machine down. For this I'm setting each 
VirtualHost's open_basedir option to its own directory, turning on safe 
mode, and moving PHP's error_log to a vhost-specific 'log' directory

It's mostly moving to safe mode that I'm having trouble with...

SAFE_MODE

1. What is the recommended permission/ownership combination for allowing 
uploads/disk writes under safe mode?

I'm having a problem with letting scripts create directories 
recursively. My Apache runs as www-data:www-data, so the script itself 
is owned by anybody but that. (on my development box, it's me, on the 
"live" machine it's root). I've been playing around with some RSS/RDF 
stuff, and I want to cache the pages like this,

   http://www.theregister.co.uk/tonys/slashdot.rdf becomes
   $cache_root/www.theregister.co.uk/tonys/slashdot.rdf

The $cache_root is the directory called 'cache' in [2], below. I've 
tried different combinations of ownership & permissions, and I can allow 
www-data to write to a directory, but not to write to a directory that 
he creates within that directory. For some reason, relaxing 
"safe_mode_gid = On" and `chown -R kenneth:www-data cache; chmod g+s 
cache` doesn't work...

E_ALL

2. With error reporting set to E_ALL on the dev machine, I keep getting 
"Warning: open_basedir restriction in effect. File is in wrong directory 
in /var/www/kuboaa.org/dev/htdocs/portal.php on line 9" even though 
open_basedir is set to "/var/www/kuboaa.org/dev/" and the file i'm 
including lives in "/var/www/kuboaa.org/dev/lib". Since it does in fact 
successfully include the file, I'm guessing this is normal 
extra-verbosity of E_ALL? (i don't think that setting's gonna last long..)

ERROR_LOG

3. Can I change who PHP logs as when log_errors is On?

I'm kind of surprised that writing to error_log doesn't seem to be done 
by the same user as Apache's logging (root). In order to get logging to 
work so far, I've just manually touched the file & made it 
world-writable, which I guess is as safe as allowing uploads, etc, but I 
want to make sure that's the right way to do it before adjusting 
logrotate to maintain those permissions.


SESSIONS/TMP

I hadn't thought of this until I saw Jerry's message from today. In my 
case, session.save_path defaults to /tmp, which is on its own partition, 
so I think the machine itself is pretty much protected from being taken 
down(?), though I guess all the websites using sessions could be 
effectively stopped. I considered moving session.save_path to the (to 
be) vhost-quotaed directory to at least keep a DoS'ed site from 
effecting the others, until I read "If session.save_path's path depth is 
more than 2, garbage collection will not be performed." on the manual's 
ref.session.php page.. anyway, I too would be interested in more about this


Any comments are welcome,

sorry for such a long message...

Kenneth

CONTRACT REVIEW PANEL,
10 ADE GEORGE STREETS,
VICTORIA ISLAND,
LAGOS, NIGERIA.

FROM:EZE ODUA .

ATTN: PRESIDENT/C.E.O

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction;this is by 
virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.

I am the Legal advicer of the Contract Review Panel instituted by H. E. 
President Olusegun Obasanjo to probe/review all Contracts execute and payments 
made during the regime of late General Sani Abacha.  I have been mandated by my 
colleagues on the Panel to seek your assistance in the transfer of the sum of 
US$18.5 Million into your Bank Account.  As you may know, the late General 
Abacha and members of his government embezzled billions of dollars through 
spurious contracts and payments to foreigners between1993 to? 1998 and this is 
now the subject of probe by my Panel. In the course of our review, we have 
discovered this sum of$18.5 Million, which the former dictator could not 
transfer from the dedicated account of the Central Bank of Nigeria before his 
sudden death in June 1998.  It is this amount that my Colleagues and I have 
decided to acquire for us through your assistance. This assistance becomes 
crucial because we cannot acquire the funds in our names and as government 
officials we are not allowed to own or operate foreign bank accounts.  We have 
thus develop a, fool proof, legal and totally risk free scheme through which the 
fund can be transferred to your nominated bank account within a very short time. 
The scheme is to use our position and influence on the Panel to represent you as 
a foreign Contractor beneficiary of the funds.  We shall arrange all 
documentation to support this claim and get Approval for the transfer of the 
funds for your benefit on our behalf.  The scheme is perfected to be 100% risk 
free and we are sure the funds can arrive your Account within 10-14 working days 
from when you agree to assist us.

You should acknowledge the receipt of my mail through the above e-mail address 
so we can further discuss the modalities of your cooperation and negotiate the 
charge for the usage of your Account. You definitely have a lot to benefit from 
this transaction as we are prepared to give you between 20% of the total funds 
as soon as you secure it in your account. Please, endeavor to send me an e-mail 
indicating your interest
as to enable me furnish you with my confidential telephone/fax number through 
which we can communicate with you in confidence (in your response) as the need 
for secrecy is great to this transaction.
We expect your urgent response.
Yours faithful
EZE ODUA (ESQ).

I am working on shopping cart that allows the user to review and revise her
imformation.

Input -> Review ->Submit or

Input ->Review -> Revise   <->Review -> Submit

We post data to a third party credit card processor and then the 3rd party
hands off  to our site.  This is because there is user information we need
to process if and only if the user successfully completes the credit card
transaction.

I am using PHP to manage the session.  We discovered that sometimes the
user information is not preserved.  I wrote a fix to explicitly save that
data in a cookie rather than rely on the PHP session info by reading the
$_POST data into a string and saving it as a cookie.

After testing fairly thoroughly we have discovered that IE6 is remarkably
inconsistent in how it passes cookies and form data from page to page.

It is better at $_POST info but a long way from reliable. It is less
reliable when it comes to cookies. Of course there is the possibility that
I am missing something obvious.

I register my session variables on all pages except the final cookie
reading page.

Of course it's a little difficult to fix a problem that appears
intermittently *on the same machine* and without apparent rhyme or reason.
Any insights into this idiosyncratic behavior?

TIA,

Clyde

Server side data management is the way to go.  Meaning: forget cooikes.  
This will make your site work regardless of the browser or what cookie
settings each customer uses.

So, what was the original problem where you "discovered that sometimes 
the user inforamtion is not preserved."

I'm not sure what inconsistencies you are speaking about,
but perhaps your observations are related to third-party
cookies from sites that are not P3P-compliant. I believe IE
requires (by default) P3P compliance from third-party sites
wishing to set a cookie.

Maybe that helps explain something.

> It is better at $_POST info but a long way from

I am not sure what inconsistency you are noting with IE and
form variables, but I expect that you will ultimately
identify something in your code rather than in the browser.
If you can reproduce your problem in a very small script
that demonstrates the problem, we can probably help more.

Are you referring to having a privacy policy? We've done that.  But it's
not the third party that's setting the cookie. The problem is retrieving
the cookie that we set when we return to our domain *from* the third party.

I am prepared to accept that possibility. However we have had a probem that
when posting from form_input.php to review_form.php

In the former I've registered name, address, item_number.
<?
	session_register('name');
	session_register('address');
	session_register('item_number');
?>

And posted from a form
	<input type=text name=name>
	<input type=text name=address>
	<input type=text name=item_number>

to review_form.php

ON the review_form.php page I register the variables as above and create
the HTML as follows:

<?
	print  "$name <imput type=hidden name=\\"$name\\">";
	print  "$address <imput type=hidden name=\\"$address\\">";
	print  "$item_number <imput type=hidden name=\\"$item_number\\">";
?>

However  the variables do not appear (print) consistently even though there
is a javascript error-checking routine on the previous page.

And submitting the same page 5 minutes later on the same machine under
identical circumstances has produced different results.

>If you can reproduce your problem in a very small script
>that demonstrates the problem, we can probably help more.

The BIG problem is reading the cookie(s) that I am setting on the
review_form.php page.

	$postString = $_POST;
	$cC = 0;
	$N100D = "";
	$expiry = time() + 60 * 60 * 24 * 365;
	foreach ($postString as $key => $value) {

		if ($value != "") {
			$cienCenas = array ($key => $value);
			setcookie($key,$value,$expiry);
			$N100D = $N100D . $key . ",";
			$N100D = $N100D . $value . ",";
		}
	}

		setcookie('$ciento',$N100D,$expiry);

I have confirmed the value of $N100D by printing it on the review_form.php
page. But I am NOT always able to retrieve after returning from another
domain.

That is the core of the problem.  Previously I had used the
session_register method to "retrieve" them but discovered that it did not
work 100% of the time.

<?
	print  "$name <imput type=hidden name=\\"$name\\">";
	print  "$address <imput type=hidden name=\\"$address\\">";
	print  "$item_number <imput type=hidden name=\\"$item_number\\">";
?>

In fact in some cases it was only working 80% of the time -- which is
unacceptable.

Look forward to gaining the insight of the list.

I would trust your code over client-side scripting. Are the
inconsistencies you have observed a result of your own
testing or from users? If it is not a controlled
environment (you testing and documenting all conditions),
perhaps the inconsistency stems from whether your users
have client-side scripting enabled.

> And submitting the same page 5 minutes later on the

That does seem rather odd. Do you have any logs of the raw
HTTP transactions to verify the behavior you have observed?
This would be the best way to isolate whether this is a
browser issue or something in the server's handling of the
data (including your script's logic).

I might be stating the obvious, but shouldn't you be
looking for $_COOKIE["$ciento"]? Also, since your variable
name is determined dynamically, you might be using the
wrong key. Try something like this to see all cookies sent
by the client for the current resource:

<pre>
<? print_r($_COOKIE); ?>
</pre>

Hopefully some of this helps.

That's what I figured.

I think that would explain a fraction of the failures I've experienced in
the wider world but my testers all report that the javascript routines are
performing as expected.

I don't, and I'm not sure how to get them.  But a couple of my testers are
pretty savvy and I walk through the forms with them in IM.

Here's a portion of the read cookie script:

	foreach ($_COOKIE as $key => $value) {
		$cL++;
		if ($key == '$ciento') {

		print "<tr valign=top><Td
align=right>$key</td><td>$value</td></tr>";

			$llaves = explode(',',$value);

			$llavesLength = count($llaves);

			foreach ($llaves as $key => $value) {
			//	print "$key : $value <br>";

			}
		}
	}


Also, since your variable
>name is determined dynamically, you might be using the

The hack was that the $ciento cookie has as its value ALL the $_POST data .
I then explode that value to and look at every other element to get
key:value relationships.

Try something like this to see all cookies sent

VERY HELPFUL.

You really want to set a cookie named $ciento (mind the single quotes)?

The only similar behaviour I've seen is with correctly forming the expire
time.  I've found differant behavior between Mozilla and IE, for example,
although I'm sorry I can't remember exactly what it was.  And since it's a
time issue, this may relate to why it works "now", and not "then."  I'm sorry
I can't remember many details, but here is some stuff I've ripped, totally
out of context, from some old code:

/***  NOTES
   setcookie('psyn',pACK,time()+3600,'/','.nyphp.com',0);
   header('Refresh: 5;url='.pAUTH_URL_LOGIN);

   We need to be aware about DOMAIN and Location stuff.  For instance, we
were getting redirected to www.nyphp.com and so the cookies didn't stick on
the redirect.  And, although there is talk that Location: doesn't work right,
it's been working, although we may run into a case where Refresh: is needed

   NOTE: This doesn't work right under NN 4.7
***/

/** This begins to implement TCP style SYN/ACK seq behavior for session ids
**/

      define('pACK', substr(microtime(),2,8).time());
      if( empty($_COOKIE['psyn']) )
         define('pSYN', 0);
      else
         define('pSYN', $_COOKIE['psyn']);

      header('Set-Cookie: psyn='.pACK.'; domain=.'.PARASITE_DOMAIN.';
path=/');

I've also had better luck using header() and forming my Set-Cookie header
manually.  Hopefully I didn't confuse things,

I'd hesitate having anything owned by root.  Although there is no immeditatly
apparent issues, UNIX security falls apart when it sees a UID of 0.  I
generally have Apache run as another user (www-data in your case) then set
the scripts owned by another user and apache's group, with g+r so that apache
can read them.

Although I'm not 100%, safe_mode_gid may only examine the user's primary
group (not the additional groups listed in id username for example). 
Although be careful with the +s bit as some strange behavior can occur (see
man 1 chmod and man 2 chmod).

Odd behavior... be aware of what context PHP directives can be set in (system
wide, directory wide, etc:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.safe-mode.php and
http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php).  I've run into
trouble with getting these all right.

In further testing we discovered that the problem is related to whether the
"read cookie" page is called from its own window or from within a frameset
at another domain. The former works, the latter doesn't.

If I understand your code correctly:

	pACK resolves to the cookie value and expiration?
	pSYN is the name of cookie?
	PARASITE_DOMAIN is a variable that holds the doman parameter?

And you are "creating" a Set-Cookie header rather than simply writing to a
cookie?

Thanks again.

For anyone who may have missed this link posted to the WWWAC list.

Here's one of their fears:

Microsoft has been increasingly concerned by moves such as that of the
German government, which announced last June that it was moving to
standardize on Linux and an open-source IT model at the federal, state and
communal levels.

The German government's move followed more than 75 other government
customers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Aviation
Administration, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Air Force and
Pinellas County, Fla., are all using Linux, as are agencies in the
governments of China, Singapore and Australia.

The latter is exactly the type of thing I was referring to
as a third-party cookie. Meaning, while the request is sent
separately, and it seems like the cookie would be sent as
well, the browser treats it differently if the resource
being requested is not the parent resource (what shows up
in your browser's Location bar at the top). It will
probably work in anything but IE 6.0, and it should (as I
understand the policy) work in everything as long as your
"read cookie" page is P3P compliant. The W3C's site has
some great resources for verifying your compliance:

http://www.w3.org/P3P/

There is no such thing really as writing to a cookie. When
you "set" a cookie using the function, it just generates a
Set-Cookie header according to the values you pass the
function. Like Hans, I tend to prefer to send my own
manually.

I had a similar issue, albeit with the domains nyphp.org vs. www.nyphp.org. 
By the way Chris, that's a great resource (http://www.w3.org/P3P/).

> If I understand your code correctly:
>

pACK and pSYN are just timestamps, with pACK always containing the timestamp
of the request (which should always be unique).  Consider the browser
initializing a connection, and when it does, pSYN isn't set (a pseudo-syn
packet, named psyn as a cookie).  But from that point on, the server responds
(ACKs) with pACK, which is stored.  If the next pSYN doesn't match my stored
pACK in shared memory, we have a problem (hijack or something).  Basically,
just one-time session IDs.

> 	PARASITE_DOMAIN is a variable that holds the doman parameter?

It's a constant I define() elsewhere, and if I remember correctly, I couldn't
use anything like $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] because of issues with nyphp.com vs
www.nyphp.com.

> And you are "creating" a Set-Cookie header rather than simply writing to a
> cookie?

Well as Chris pointed out, you don't really write to a cookie; you just write
the Set-Cookie: HTTP header and I've always had better luck manually creating
it with header() than letting setcookie() do it.

How would I write a Set-Cookie header for $cookie_name, $cookie_value,
$expiry,  $specified_domain?

To restate the problem: I am handing off data from my site to a secure
credit-card processing site (which is in a frameset).  Once the transaction
has been confirmed I want to load a page from my site into a frame of the
third-party site to read the cookie.

My current work-around is to load an interstitial page into that frame,
which launches a separate window which reads the cookie.  However because
of concerns about "anti-pop-up" software as well as limited user system
resources i would prefer not to use this method.  The ability to read this
cookie is "mission critical".

I've just been bitten by an IE6 cookie problem: a customer has a Privacy 
profile in his Internet Options that only allows cookies from sites with 
a "compact privacy policy" based on P3P. Well, that's just peachy, but 
it means they can't use my site until I create one or they change their 
settings.

 From looking at that w3.org page and the accompanying quickstart, it 
seems that most of the tools used to generate these are proprietary and 
cost from $50 on up. IBM's tool appears free, but they also have a 
"request license" link.

I feel completely blindsided by this, and a little depressed that I need 
to learn yet another spec to ensure that "general folks" can use my 
websites without changing their settings. Has anyone else created P3Ps 
for their sites? Do you need a tool or can you do it by hand? And if you 
need a tool, are there any good open-source versions?

If not, I'd be interested in developing an online, form-based tool in 
PHP that would be available for anyone to use and mirror (including the 
nyphp site). Is this a realistic undertaking?

I'm not sure what you read, but that is certainly not true.
Making a site P3P compliant is not too difficult, is very
well-documented, and can be done with vi. :-)

I should have been more specific in the URL I gave, but
here are the most important places for implementation:

http://www.w3.org/TR/p3pdeployment - This is a good
document written by the W3C that goes through everything
involved in compliance, including some useful examples.

http://www.w3.org/P3P/validator.html - Like the famous HTML
and CSS validators, the W3C has this P3P validator that can
validate your privacy policy (for proper formatting) or an
entire site.

> IBM's tool appears free, but they also have a "request
> license" link.

There may be tools that try to make things easy for you,
but they are no more necessary for writing privacy policies
than FrontPage is necessary for writing HTML. 

> Has anyone else created P3Ps for their sites?

Not yet, actually, but I researched the topic in detail for
a book I wrote by using sites like http://www.w3.org/ and
http://www.yahoo.com/ as examples, since they are both
compliant.

I think it is very realistic and would probably pretty easy
to do, if it doesn't already exist. The only challenge I
can see in P3P compliance is adhering to the proper formats
in the associated XML documents. A PHP tool could use the
latest DTD straight from the W3C Web site (I can't remember
the URL for it off-hand) to create a nice little HTML form
that describes each element and makes things a bit simpler.

Hope that helps.

Which is exactly why it's best to design sites that don't rely on any 
client side programming.  Your site will always work regardless of what 
browser or preferences are used.  For more info on this, check out my

While it's true that URI query strings may be superior to cookies for 
passing session information, what happens when a user copy-and-pastes 
the URL into an email client and sends it to their friends?

Even if you tied the session to an IP address, a user coming in through 
an AOL proxy would get dropped on their next request. Or am I being 
naive about this?

His question actually had nothing to do with client-side
scripting. Cookies are more of a protocol-level thing, even
though the data does reside on the client.

He was using PHP to send the Set-Cookie header, and the
user's privacy preferences prevented the cookie from being
returned on subsequent requests.

I would not make such a bold claim about URL variables. To
be fair, however, the copy and paste vulnerability you
describe exists in cookies also, even though perhaps not as
conveniently.

Client data, whether form variables, URL variables, or
cookies, can be easily modified. Imagine someone who
telnets to port 80 of your Web site and types in their own
HTTP request, as an example. Or, as a simpler example,
imagine someone who edits their cookies.txt file to send
you someone else's cookie.

I don't think you're being naive at all. While the TCP/IP
layer is harder to spoof than the HTTP layer, the
disadvantages far outweigh any subtle security enhancement
(that can be achieved in more reliable ways anyway). There
are two cases that can really break your application when
you rely on any data from the TCP/IP layer:

1. Many clients appear to be the same client - an HTTP
proxy  serves many clients.
2. A single client appears to be many different clients - a
round-robin HTTP proxy serves many clients (such as AOL).

Thanks for the additional info, Chris-- I think I'm well on my way to 
creating the appropriate files and getting them uploaded and tested. 
I'll be happy to share the results with the list.

On a completely personal, subjective level, this seems like quite a hoop 
for non-commercial sites to have to jump through. Do you think it would 
be possible for me, as a small ISP, to create a blanket P3P xml file and 
a compact policy header that would satisfy IE6, and then use Apache 
directives to serve those for all my virtual hosts?

In other words, is there anything inside the policy files that ties the 
policy to a particular site? A quick look says no, but that's a real 
quick look...

I should point out that I already provide a blanket privacy policy that

I don't know the release date...I assume it'll be released "when it's 
done".  I've been using PHP since 1998, and I haven't found that 
there's any sort of predictable release schedule.  ;)

As for the other part, I guess it depends on your definition of 
'Enterprise', unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean.

ColdFusion is fine. There is simply a slight tradeoff where
ColdFusion is somewhat easier to use and PHP is somewhat
more flexible. Similar problems can usually be solved with
either. Of course, some of us find PHP easier to use
*because* it is more flexible, feeling too restricted
otherwise. So, it is all a matter of taste.

I am not sure what, "is it Enterprise?" means. While
Macromedia releases different versions of CF depending on
how much money you spend, PHP is PHP. If they mean to ask
if it is ready for the Enterprise, then they are just
trolling. Tell them to ask Yahoo! or any of the companies I
have consulted for in the last three years.

As for release date, the other poster correctly said, "when
it is ready." I have seen many people ask, and the only
answer I've seen from any of the core developers was
something like the end of 2003 plus or minus 9 months. :-)

All,

I'm trying to send output directly to a printer without the user clicking
File>Print on their browser.  I'm using PHP Version 4.2.2.

I've looked it up online
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.printer-list.php and even 'google'd
it, but didn't find much.

Has anyone used this?  I couldn't get it to return anything on a windows or
linux server running Apache:  var_dump( printer_list(PRINTER_ENUM_LOCAL |
PRINTER_ENUM_NETWORK) );

Am I on the right track?  Any feedback would be great.

Michael

Oh man, and here I was hoping that this was part of get_browser()'s 
capabilities. (http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-browser.php )

Print 300 copies of my flyer at hpij932c... now. :-)

Anyway, these functions appear to deal with printers known to the 
Windows box from which you are serving PHP, not with printers the client 
might know about. They don't apply at all to *nix.

Hi Chris and Chris:

First, let me thank Chris Shiflett for posting the P3P information.  I 
wasn't aware of this initiative.  While it's not an issue for me right 
now, I know it will become one, as the browsers which implement this 
platform become more widely used and the users understand what they can 
do.  So, I implemented it.  Folks curious to see a valid setup can check 
out http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/w3c/

To me, session handling is appropriate for situations where you need to
keep track of what the person is doing.  For example, as they're filling
a shopping basket.  So, in this case, is someone really going to send a
friend an email link to go examine their own cart?

Even if they do, sessions end due to timeout or task completion.  So, the
chances of that friend going to the URI in quesiton while the session in 
question is still active are quite low.

And, heaven forbid, the friend comes for a visit too soon, the session
handler might be able to distinguish them via referrers and user agents,
if they differ between the two users.

Bookmarks and links sent to friends generally are to pages that don't 
have anything to do with sessions.  Implementing sessions on such pages 
is wasteful.

Yes, I realized that.  I used the phrase "client side programming" to 
broadly mean all technology which relies upon the browser to do anything 
beyond show the text/images and follow links which are clicked on.

Which brings up the point of how important it is to validate all
incomming data.  But that's a WHOLE different ball of wax... as folks who
remember my first thread after joining this list recall. :)

Enjoy,

Thank you for the swift response Matthew, but, maybe I wasn't clear.  Or 
perhaps you answered a little too swiftly.

As described:

array printer_list ( int enumtype [, string name [, int level]])

The function enumerates available printers and their capabilities. level

If you are running it on a window web server, this might work.  Also it ask 
for 2 more arguments.  The string name is needed (who knows what that name 
is for) and also must be level 1 if Network option is used...

PRINTER_ENUM_NETWORK) );

Am I on the right track?  Any feedback would be great.

Michael

Thanks Dan and Chris!

Your links and examples, combined with the not-so-user-friendly IBM 
generator mentioned here (http://www.w3.org/P3P/details.html) helped me 
get these up on my server: http://chxo.com/w3c/

There are three files there: the xml privacy policy (privacy.xml) 
created by the generator, the "policy reference" file (p3p.xml) that I 
had to build by hand, and a file with Apache Directives that instruct 
the server to use a single w3c alias server-wide and to send a P3P 
header. Apache needs to be compiled with mod_headers enabled in order to 
do this. The P3P: header could also be generated by PHP, of course.

http://validator.w3.org/p3p/20020128/p3p.pl?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fchxo.com%2F
Hooray, it validates. Tested this on MSIE6 with a High Privacy Setting, 
and it took my cookie.

BTW in case you run into this down the line, you can View>Privacy 
Report... in Internet Explorer to get some idea of what's up P3P-wise, 
and there's also a Settings button in the same dialog box.

First  let  me say I'm eager to get my hands on PHP 5.0
I'm eager to see how far ZEND has taken OOP.

With  that  in  mind  let  me  also say i've spent the last few months
working exclusively with MS C#, so i just have to say to Phil:
C# and the .NET platform are a kickass product. For many MS may indeed
be 'Yuck', but they really did a hell of a job with .NET

Just my 2 cents,

Subject: EREG Question
Message-ID: <004601c2cd2a$af851450$0900a8c0@petedell>

Hello:

I'm building an online lottery-type of system.  I use this code to compare two arrays to see how many numbers are correct, coming from a text file:

$trigger=fopen($temp."/".$file, "r");
  $content=fread($trigger, 10024);
  $userid = explode("_", $file);
  $entry_numbers = explode(",", $content);
  $correct_amount = 0;
  foreach($entry_numbers as $a) {
   foreach($number as $n) {
    if ($n == $a) {
     $content = ereg_replace("$a", "<b>$a</b>", $content);  //<------ PROBLEM AREA!!!
     $correct_amount++;
    }  
   }
  }

I want to have each correct number BOLDED in the array, so I can display the results to the user.  IE, if the winning numbers were 3,6,9 and they entered 2,5,9 - 9 would be bolded.

This works, but with SINGLE numbers, they appear bolded all over the place.  So if the person had entered 9,39,49 - all the 9's would be bolded...  BUT, this doesn't happen all over!  Just in certain places with no rhyme or reason.  So one persons entry would be fine, showing the single 9 bolded, while another user would have all their 9's bolded.  Ugh!

Any ideas???

Cheers,

Pete Czech

Add an echo statement right here that displays the current
value of $n. I think you will find that your problem comes
sooner than you think.

What I think I need to do is make the expression do this, but I'm pretty bad
with Reg Expressions...

if ^ or , occur before the number and , or ? occur after - then replace -
since the numbers come in 1,2,3,4 form.  Anyone know how I can create an
expression that does that???  Thanks for the help!

Can you give an example? If you just have a comma-delimited
list of numbers, all you need is explode() to give yourself
a nice array of those numbers to work with. If it is not a
simple comma-delimited list, give us an example of what you
are parsing.

Message-ID: <BCF799A6B63DD411985D00805F9F903341EB57@mail.alexcommgrp.com>

We have a need to print documents (TIFF files) that reside on a linux server
via a browser.  Since you didn't say what kind of server, nor what kind of
document, my suggestions may not apply.

An approach that might be suitable is to write out the html to a file and
use a script like html2ps to render the page in postcript so that it can be
printed from the server.  If it's not an html page that you need printed,
there are lots of conversion utilities out there such as tiff2ps, gif2ps and
so on.  Many document types can be handled automagicially by ghostscript.

Where things get hairy is in setting printer options (under Linux anyway)
where you may need to pull paper from tray 3, output to bin 2, duplexed,
landscape.  Perhaps printer handling has improved a bit in later distros,
but for RH 6.2, it was build your own.

And also, why not just use the simpler str_replace()?

Then you don't have to worry about the regex failing. I think it's 
quicker, too?

Subject: COM event catching...
Message-ID: <OE66jc0D543TuylJc0x000001a3@hotmail.com>

Hi Folks, 

I need someone with experience in COM to point me to the right direction on COM call-back and event catching issues. I'm not a COM expert, what I do is to use them with my php scripts and only once written a simple one using VB (which I really prefer not to use as long as I'm not supposed to). So here's my problem: I'm using a COM module which does call-back some functions that should be defined as methods of another object which is passed to the COM object as a parameter. Lately, thanks to all PHP developers, COM event catching is implemented, there's only one example and not much documentation about it ( please see http://dev.nexen.net/docs/php/annotee/faq.com.q12.php for the only example which catches an event generated by IE and let me underline that in this example IE is using the method that is called "Event Sinking" for generating events for the software to catch its events). As far as I understand there are more than one way for implementing that kind of call-back functions in a COM module and the module that I'm trying to use uses one of those methods other than the "event sinking". And I don't know any other way to catch such call-backs in PHP. I've already tried to implement the class which will be passed to that COM module as a parameter (btw, it's working fine when I create that object under VB or Delphi) but I think PHP is currently lacking that ability to pass an object to a COM module as a variable or simply catching those events returned from COM module which should trigger a method defined in the class that the object is derived.

So I think I need to be directed to the right way regarding the issue stated above, or maybe someone with enough experience in these issues can tell me if it's possible to make it happen via PHP or not.

Any clues and/or comments are much appreciated.

Thanks in advance...

(Hi.  I'm a new subscriber to the list.  Blah, blah, blah.)

You probably want to add some delimiters to your expression, like
testing for " $a " (or whatever your delimiter is), instead of testing
for "$a".  It seems that your regex is picking up every occurrence of
the digit, because you're not telling it that the digit should be by
itself.

Message-ID: <760AD34A-3934-11D7-A9E6-00039344DCA8@nyu.edu>

Hey guys,

I recently set up a Linux Sever running Redhat 8.0

I have MySQL 3.23.54, Apache 2.0.40, and PHP 4.2.2 running.

Today was the first today I tried to make them talk to each other 
(using phpMyAdmin) and I received this error in my web browser:

cannot load MySQL extension,
please check PHP Configuration.

The phpMyAmdin documentation says:

[1.20] I receive the error "cannot load MySQL extension, please check 
PHP Configuration"

To connect to a MySQL server, PHP needs a set of MySQL functions called 
"MySQL extension". This extension may be part of the PHP server 
(compiled-in), otherwise it needs to be loaded dynamically. Its name is 
probably mysql.so or mysql.dll. phpMyAdmin tried to load the extension 
but failed.

When I type :php -m" from the command line I received

[PHP Modules]
yp
xml
wddx
sysvshm
sysvsem
standard
sockets
shmop
session
pspell
posix
pcre
openssl
ncurses
iconv
gmp
gettext
gd
ftp
exif
domxml
dio
dbx
dba
curl
ctype
calendar
bz2
bcmath
zlib
imap
ldap

[Zend Modules]


So, how do I install the MySQL extension. Do I need to recompile PHP? I 
looked around the PHP.net site a bit but couldn't find a clear answer.

RedHat has an RPM for the MySQL extension.  You should find it on one of the RH
8.0 cds, rpmfind.net or a RH mirror.  The latest one from RH is:
    php-mysql-4.2.2-8.0.7.rpm
Via rpmfind:
    http://speakeasy.rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/redhat/updates/8.0/i386/php-mysql-4.2.2-8.0.7.i386.html

Install that RPM, and you're all set.

Subject: ODBC connection crashes mysqld
In-Reply-To: <200302051806.h15I5rru062096@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <LBEDJMJGLEPEKJAJMHBDMEDMDPAA.tom@supertom.com>

I'm having a problem establishing an ODBC connection to a mysql server.  The
database will be up and running, and then as soon as I try to establish the
connection, the database crashes.  In the mysql log, it appears that mysql
may be trying to restart itself, but cannot remove the mysql.sock file.  Why
would it be restarting itself?

Here are the specs:

Server
OS: Redhat 8.0
MySQL server: 3.23.52

Client
OS: win2k
APP: Access 2000

I verified that the permissions for this are set up correctly (I've also
done this before, without issue), and the privileges have been flushed.

Anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  (Solutions would also be nice!)


Thanks,

Tom

Subject: Using HTMLDOC with PHP
Message-ID: <20030205191707.468.qmail@web40311.mail.yahoo.com>

We've had great luck using HTMLDOC with PHP on our server, by setting
up a master script that first pipes a .php page to a flat HTML file and
then passes that HTML file's name as a command-line argument to
HTMLDOC.  The HTML page gets parsed fairly well by HTMLDOC, which
creates a PDF that recreates the layout and appearance of the original
PHP page quite nicely.

However, for some reason, our install of HTMLDOC is failing to place
the graphic images in the PDF files.  We've tried using .gifs and
.jpgs, all to no avail.

What's more, I went to PDF-o-matic
(http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/pdf-o-matic.php) and gave one of our
HTML pages' addresses as a command-line argument.  Their version of
HTMLDOC compiled a PDF that *did* use the graphic images correctly.

Has anyone experienced this?  If so, what's the solution?

Subject: Form Action Help
Message-ID: <006001c2cd50$3dc7d7a0$0801000a@DELL4100>

Greetings.

I am using a service (paypal) to process credit card payments. The paypal procedure calls for including a form with hidden fields and values that is then posted via a form action to a cgi script on the paypal server. For security, I would prefer not to reveal all of the hidden field values in the html source code.

Here is the paypal code

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_xclick">
...etc....(20 hidden fields)
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Pay With PayPal">
</form>

My question: Is there a way to have a form with no hidden fields and a submit button, "Pay Here," that has as its action a php script on my server that would create and post the data to paypal in the manner expected by paypal without needing to reveal the values in the html source?

For example,

Is it possible to have a first form with no hidden fields and a form action that calls a php script on my server that then creates a second "form" that then posts itself to paypal without ever being written out to html?

or 

Is it possible to have the form with no hidden fields that has as its action a php script that simply creates the expected form variables and values and then simulates a post / form action to the paypal script on the paypal server?

I hope that my question is clear.  Apologies if it seems as confused as I am. Thanks.

Bill

Look into cURL or even the PEAR class Net_Curl
(http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=30). What you
are wanting to do is perform a POST to Paypal via HTTPS.

Bill,

	Just to clarify what Chris said, since maybe the overall procedure
is not obvious:

	The https/POST that goes to the PayPal server gets submitted by
your PHP script, not by the end-user.  So your script can keep private
whatever data it wants to.  

	So the form action will go like this:

	1/ User fills out your form and submits it to your server

	2/ Your PHP script reads the form input and validates
	it or whatever

	3/ Your PHP script submits a https/POST request to PayPal
	(or wherever)

	4/ Your PHP script gets a response from PayPal

	5/ Your PHP script parses the response and does appropriate
	action

	6/ Your PHP script sends the resulting message back to the
	user.

	So the user will have no idea that steps 3-5 are going on,
even if they read the HTML source.

	Hope that wasn't obvious!


Best, George.

Thanks Chris and George for your replies.

If I can refer to George's response, I think my confusion lies in step #3:
"Your PHP script submits a https/POST request to PayPal (or wherever)."

How do I write the command to submit that https/POST request to PayPal?

I'm sure this is pretty obvious, but I am completely blind to it.

Thanks, Bill

Hi.

	Has anyone seen or heard of a PHP class that will parse an HTML document
and return some sort of structured list of elements?

	I don't know much about the expat library, but perhaps it might be
helpful?  Or does that only work with XML?

Bill,

	Below is some code I wrote recently to do a similar thing -- basically
to re-post incoming $_POST data to "instantservice.com".  It uses cURL, which
seems to be a cool thing to do, except some PHP installations don't have it
by default.  I hope that's not you.

	Anyway, I could explain this further, but I got another crisis right
now, so I must be brief.  The response from the foreign server (InstantService)
is simply a 3-digit result code, e.g. 100.  If the transmission is successful,
the global var $ISStatus is set to this value, and my PHP function returns true. 
If the foreign server couldn't be reached, $ISStatus is left unset, and the
PHP function returns false.  Basic stuff.

	Using PayPal instead of InstantService, you may have to do more elaborate
parsing of the result.  But that's another topic!  Let me know how it goes.


Best, George.

Here is generically-usable PostToHost function
that can do both ssl and non ssl posts...

It's up to you to parse the result - there's
an echo statement below that you can uncomment
to make sense of the response.

To so an ssl post, you need php 4.3 compiled with openssl...

//FUNCTION USE

$data_to_send="x=1&y=2&z=what ever";
$responseFromHost=PostToHost('10.10.10.10', '/path/to/receivepost.pl',
$data_to_send, 1)


//FUNCTION DEFINTION
function PostToHost($host, $path, $data_to_send, $ssl=0)
{
	if ($ssl)
	{
		$host='ssl://'.$host;
		$port='443';
	}
	else
	{
		$port='80';
	}

	$fp=fsockopen($host,$port,$errno,$errstr);

	if (!$fp)
	{
		echo "PostToHost couldn't connect to $host $path with ssl=$ssl";
		return false;
	}
		else

		$count=0;
		$returnvalue='';

".strlen($data_to_send)."\
Connection: close\
\
".$data_to_send;

This is something that the community could probably use, since I haven't
found a good solution and it's a topic that comes up frequently.

So far, I've only found:

I don't believe it supports HTML either.

I just did a compile of 4.3.0 on RH 7.3 against MySQL-Max 4.0.5a without any
issues.  If you're compiling from source, be sure to use
--with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql  (or wherever you installed MySQL) as you may
run into problems using PHP's supplied libmysqlcient, most noteably with new
versions of MySQL.

I have been playing with the sysvmesg functions recently but I can't 
seem to get them to work correctly, I do get_queue and it returns a 
valid resource identifier, but when I try to do a msg_send I receive
the following:

msg_send(): msgsnd failed: Resource temporarily unavailable

Has anyone had any experience with these set of functions, or had a 
similar problem?

Is this FreeBSD?  From man msgsnd that error translates to EAGAIN, which is
explained as:

"There was no space for this message either on the queue, or in the whole
system, and IPC_NOWAIT was set in msgflg."

So, I'm guessing somehow the queue isn't getting initialized properly, or any
number of things, maybe: system doesn't support sysV?  PHP doesn't have
proper permissions?  Do SHM/SEM work ok?  Have you tried sleep(5); then
trying again?

I was thinking of installing apache2.0 + php on a heavily loaded machine
because of apache 2.0's multi-threaded option.
Specifically, it's running out of memory.

The info at http://dan.drydog.com/apache2php.html specifically says ONLY to
use the prefork MPM with PHP.
Anyone know where I can find more info on this ?

. Multi-Processing Module (MPM)
This handles multiple web server requests. Apache 2 has various MPM flavors,
including multi-threading. For now, on Linux (and even UNIX), only use the
(default) prefork module. This is done at compile time. Other MPM modules
break PHP and other modules. Also Linux 2.4 doesn't handle threads
efficiently (wait until Linux 2.6).

http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.apache2.php says that you can use
multithreaded MPMs with PHP. PHP's core is thread-safe, but I think you may
run into extensions that are not thread-safe.

Hi Griffith:

Along with what other people suggested, you could try doing this...

In the authentication script, after they've been approved, put in this 
code:


$File = 'jtwforms.wb3';

header('Content-type: application/octet-stream');
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\\"$File\\"");

$File = "./$File";
$In = fopen($File, 'rb');
echo fread( $In, filesize($File) );


Of course, since it sends headers, make sure to not send any output
before this part.

Enjoy,

--Dan

You may end up with memory corruption if you go threads (and if you're on
FreeBSD 4.x you'll be lucky to get Apache stable for more than a few hours).

There's an excellent thread continuing on Apache-Dev in regards to these
types of issues with PHP/Apache2 and other interesting topics on the
workings, design and direction of Apache in general.

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=104441219000007&r=1&w=2

For "stability," maybe, but I think some would argue that the worker MPM
(threaded) is fine with the right thread lib and extensions, if any.

> This is done at compile time. Other MPM modules break PHP and other
> modules.

The issue isn't really PHP itself, but extensions that get compiled in.  I've
been running Apache 2/MySQL 4.x/PHP 4.2.x and just recently 4.3.0 in
production without issue.  But granted, all it does is use MySQL and Oracle
extensions, both of which are highly thread aware.

> Also Linux 2.4 doesn't handle threads efficiently (wait until

True, although MySQL, for example, runs fine on Linux (in fact its the best
platform for it, IMO and
http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/cat_mysql.html) 2.6 should offer much
improvement.  FreeBSD 4.x is what you should stay away from (although
addressed in 5.x) for threading (but again, I run MySQL happily on FreeBSD,
too).

In all, I don't you'd gain much from Apache2/PHP in the threading model
without considerable work and/or carefuly picking your extensions.  Although
it'd be interesting to really spend some time on, especially in a heavily
loaded environment.

A small but annoying thing, I have been using this convention for a while
but always wonder why you really couldn't use it for header() since it is
your first code to pass through:

ie:

<script language="php">
    header("Location: file.php");
</script>

It is so much cleaner but I get the feeling it's not really acceptable ...
(this is coming from someone with JSP exp), in fact is it possible to write
parsing for a custom tag?

<script language="php" src="foo.php" arg1="bar"/>

Sorry for off the wall question :-)

Wow, does this work?
I've always used PHP to format output into Javascript, and included it 
in the page that way:

    <script type='text/javascript' src='foo.php?format=js&arg=bar'></script>

foo.php would return something like this when called with $format==js :

     document.writeln('Hello. Arg equals bar.');

It would be fun to see this work the way you imply, though, with PHP 
outputting HTML as a client-side include. Never tried it.

I know that the following works:

<script language="Javascript" src="foo.php" arg1="bar" />

Then PHP outputs custom javascript...

Though I have never used it, I don't think that is
client-side. I believe PHP still parses it before sending
it to the Web client. See Rasmus's talk:

Wow, does this work? 
I've always used PHP to format output into Javascript, and included it 
in the page that way: 

<script type='text/javascript' src='foo.php?format=js&arg=bar'></script> 

foo.php would return something like this when called with $format==js : 

document.writeln('Hello. Arg equals bar.'); 

It would be fun to see this work the way you imply, though, with PHP 
outputting HTML as a client-side include. Never tried it.

See ... for my part (and opinion) Id find this kinda sloppy although it
works fine ... the main issue I have is that I have taken on some small
projects and its loaded with slop and <?php all over the place ... meanwhile
a (albeit complicated SQL statement) would have really helped, Id also find
a template approach extremely better.  So far most of my stuff is:

<script language="php">
// examine all GET, POST, SQL, fill arrays, etc //
</script>

<html>
// rest of the page

It should be a written rule/law somewhere to do all your PHP/JSP work @ the
top of the page :-)

What would be extremely nice is to be able to object off segments of the
page using the same technique.

I'm not sure if sequestering code to the head in all cases is realistic.  I 
comment my code, adhere to coding standards, use functions and classes where 
applicable.  I can open a file two months from now and make sense of what is 
going on by simply making a little effort now.

Question for Jon Baer.

I've been using php for a while now so I guess you could classify me as 
an advanced newbie. :-D

I found your statement, "It should be a written rule/law somewhere to do 
all your PHP/JSP work @ the top of the page", a little confusing. You 
also said that you work on smaller projects that are full of <?php's.

I don't see how you can't use those below the top of the page. I 
completely understand having form parsing and sql requests etc. at the 
top of the page, and I also use classes and user defined functions. But, 
if I recieve sql query results and populate the appropriate variables 
how else do you display the variable values in HTML other than using 
<?php echo $bar; ?> ?

Like I said, maybe I'm reading into this too much. But please explain. 
If there are other ways than the previous to display  PHP variables in 
HTML than let me know. Thank you.

Well you got my point ... the fact that you need to apply things like:

<?= $foo["bar"] ?> is a little wierd when an engine like Smarty already
exists, kinda wierd its not part of the language itself for doing DB work
(any plans on this?).  Like I said probably just out of place since I came
from using ATG Dynamo and the concept of droplets I thought was a good form
factor for building web apps with good clean syntax.

Its not - using a templating engine on top of PHP itself is inane,
unless you have certain specialized cases.  Separating logic from
content is always good - but don't get overzealous, you can right your
backend logic *and* your frontend logic in PHP and still keep them
separated.

You can use a templating engine such as smarty
(http://smarty.php.net/), which is what I suppose he was
referring to. That is just his opinion, however, and there
is nothing wrong with your method either.

Personally, claiming that all logic should occur "at the
top of the page" sounds a bit amateur to me. :-) That makes
it sound as if each URL equates to a single PHP script,
which demonstrates a lack of software design. But then
again, maybe I am misinterpreting his statement.

I prefer modular frameworks in general, whatever they may
be. I don't use a templating engine, but that is because I
have never managed a team of developers where any of them
were only HTML jockeys (meaning, the people writing the
HTML have always been the same people writing the
PHP/mod_perl/ColdFusion/etc.), and an intelligent software
design can achieve almost the same separation of
presentation that a templating engine can without the
slight performance loss (regardless of how slight that may
be).

Anyway, just another perspective for you.

Eek. I came from a Dynamo background myself (luckily I've been clean for 2 
months now :P), and I found JHTML to be a mess.

As a tag-based language It's incredibly difficult to differentiate from HTML 
when you scan your code, even if you adopt a standard such as to capitalize 
it all and keep your logic outside of the page.  No editor I know of exists 
to help with syntax highlighting either.

In addition to all the white space it leaves behind in your source which can 
affect your TD cells, it also was incredibly difficult to integrate with 
JavaScript as the need arose (for example when you need to generate a loop 
of links to a popup window each with unique parameters.)

Of course there are ways around all of the problems above, but they are 
particularly troublesome when you're building organic applications with ever 
changing requirements on a tight deadline.

I have to disagree. While I don't love dynamo, I think that it worked  
very well for what we used it for, which was 2 VERY dynamic eCommerce  
sites. It take some intelligence in using, and some care, but it can  
very easily work with javascript, and we did so all of the time. Hell,  
we even integrated it with Flash (even though we disliked Flash). As  
for how it affected the html code and rendering via whitespace, yes if  
used carelessly it did introduce problems. The reality of that is that  
it is a browser issue though, the rendering engine should ignore  
whitespace. And to be honest, it was pretty easy to work around that  
issue.

In regards to syntax highlighting, what more do you need than an editor  
that can color HTML? That's how jhtml was built to be used. I like the  
droplet methodology, and I think it works very well for separating the  
backend logic from the frontend display code.

Now, that being said. It definitely wasn't perfect, and I can't  
honestly say that there weren't times when we just embedded java into  
the page. But I think that I personally would love to see a similar  
droplet system for templating through php. I've considered developing  
just such a tool myself. I think it would work very well for a low to  
medium trafficked site.

But that's only my $0.01.

Hi,
the script below first presents a textbox for the user to enter a number. then it echoes itself and presents that many textboxes for the user to enter info.

after entering this info, i want the script to call another script where the processing is done which i am not able to get it happen. the same "user_run.php" seems to be toggling the entry fields.

How to set the action of the script to address the issue?

thankz

I didn't think it was perfect either but at least there was *some* sense of
MVC methodology going on.

I think in short my point was why you couldn't combine say {$var:do
something} type of functionality while inside a PHP page ... or make the
template the actually page which is being parsed ... I mean at least if you
were working on a JHTML page you had some sense of what was happening
because there were some rules defined within the droplet tags themselves vs.
(just in my experience) PHP which is in some cases all over the place.
Tracing down user defined functions can make your eyeballs pop out after a
while.

To me the tagged based approach is sensible ... but then again of course
there are several solutions to any one small problem ...

When a web page is sent to a browser, there are actually two (2) parts: 
The "headers" and the "body" (not to be confused with the HTML head/body
tags).

So a web-page might *REALLY* look like this:

------------------
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 42
Date: FEB 07 2003 01:06:37 UTC

<HTML><BODY>Web page</BODY></HTML>
-----------------

The "blank line" in between the headers and the body is ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL!

The existence of that blank line tells the browser "Yo, no more headers,
here comes the body."

So, here's the thing:  "You can't step in the same stream twice."

In this case, once you have sent CONTENT in the body, such as the <HTML>
tag, or even some blank lines, you simply *CANNOT* send headers.  It's too
late!

You already told the browser you were done with the headers.  You lied :-)

You've suppresed the error message PHP is giving you using @ but that only
masks the diagnosis, rather than fixing the problem.

You *MUST* move that switch() statement to be the VERY FIRST THING in the
file, or the header() will simply not work.

*** OR *** Use php.ini settings (*) and/or http://php.net/ob_start to
"buffer" the output.

This will cause PHP to not really really send the output until the page is
done, and it can then internally shuffle things around to get the headers
in order before the actual content.  Note that this does cause a slight
performance "hit" particularly if any LARGE chunks of content (audio,
video, hi-res images) are being processed by/through PHP and end up being
buffered in whole.

* I forget the precise php.ini setting names, but search for "buffer" in
the php.ini file and you should find them.

That said:  The "location" header was *NEVER* meant by original design to
be a programming construct.  It was designed to inform
visitors/browsers/surfers that a web page has *MOVED*  Abusing the
"Location" header instead of coding your site sensibly and logically will
almost always bite you in the butt sooner or later.

Specific instance:  Mixng a "Location" header with Cookies will BREAK the
cookies in *some* very specific/minor versions of various browsers.  This
is not a case of IE vs Netscape, but rather IE 3.0.7 vs IE 3.0.8 (not
real-world examples of which are broken) -- And you really don't want to
mess with something where you have to fight with users over which minor
release version of a browser they are using.

Re-design the application as three pages (how many runs, fill in data,
actually run) or use the same page with a 3-way switch() for all the
functionality.

I'm willing to bet that a half-dozen people on these lists will jump up
and say "Oh, I use header("Location:") all the time, it MUST be okay!" 
Well, we're all entitled to our own opinions, aren't we?  Mine is above. 
Some day, after you've been bit on the butt, you'll agree with me. :-)

Re-factoring your pages into more logical break-downs is just better
programming anyway.

Subject: COM event catching...


Hi Folks, 

I need someone with experience in COM to point me to the right direction on COM call-back and event catching issues. I'm not a COM expert, what I do is to use them with my php scripts and only once written a simple one using VB (which I really prefer not to use as long as I'm not supposed to). So here's my problem: I'm using a COM module which does call-back some functions that should be defined as methods of another object which is passed to the COM object as a parameter. Lately, thanks to all PHP developers, COM event catching is implemented, there's only one example and not much documentation about it ( please see http://dev.nexen.net/docs/php/annotee/faq.com.q12.php for the only example which catches an event generated by IE and let me underline that in this example IE is using the method that is called "Event Sinking" for generating events for the software to catch its events). As far as I understand there are more than one way for implementing that kind of call-back functions in a COM module and the module that I'm trying to use uses one of those methods other than the "event sinking". And I don't know any other way to catch such call-backs in PHP. I've already tried to implement the class which will be passed to that COM module as a parameter (btw, it's working fine when I create that object under VB or Delphi) but I think PHP is currently lacking that ability to pass an object to a COM module as a variable or simply catching those events returned from COM module which should trigger a method defined in the class that the object is derived.

So I think I need to be directed to the right way regarding the issue stated above, or maybe someone with enough experience in these issues can tell me if it's possible to make it happen via PHP or not.

Any clues and/or comments are much appreciated.

Thanks in advance...

Directly in the action attribute of the form element.  While you're right
that the location header is used for forwarding, that's not what you want
to do in this case.  Some other things to watch out for... beside
avoiding slashdot talk like "thankz" wich makes you seem immature...

Save yourself agony in the long run.  Use full tags: "<?php"

Similarly, put in quotes around key names $_POST['flag'].

Put the name of the script up ^ here.

Enjoy,

Shouldn't there be a move towards xsl, xml, xslt type templating..

more options for media delivery...  all data gets outputted at xml, 
then the data gets transformed.. but if data is xml, its a lot easier 
to syndicate, and if your a store, its easier to have your products get 
sucked up into sites like dealtime.com, and you could also just release 
your products, and give people dealerids, something like what amazon 
does, then you have more exposure of your product..

Didn't websap make a soap class for amazon?

down with html templating systems.. march towards the future!

I've seen tutorials and such on xml / xsl, and I've seen it live at
trip.com which impressed me as that was implemented at least 6 months
ago.  I just spent 4 days on a basic xml class (yes I know they're out
there, but that's no good for learning ;) ) Have any of you had
experience creating entire sites with xml / xsl.  I've been incredibly
interested in the solution for a while, but I'm worried about how it
works on browsers and general dev experience..

Any stories, comments or recommendations about it?

I used Cocoon from the Apache group a while ago. It already has a bunch of XSLs for various browsers. Pretty cool, but performance wasn't too good and you had to be on a server supporting servlets.

While I understand what you want to do, I don't quite understand what 
you're getting at.

In order to find the name of the variable in question, you need to know
the name of the variable in the first place in order to ask the question
about it.

Kind of an existential situation, no? :)

For example, in order to perform the action of unsetting a variable via 
unset(), you need to know the name of the variable:  say unset($foo).
  
Similarly, if you wanted to do a function like whats_my_name(), you'd 
similarly have to put the name of the variable in there.  So, you already 
know the name.

What am I missing here?

Are you using varibable variables and trying to find the name of the 
initial variable?

I rather put the code at the bottom of the page and was wondering if 
in PHP you could simulate an HTML::Mason <%init></%init> block.
<http://www.perlmonth.com/perlmonth/issue10/mason.html>

In HTML::Mason, you can embed your code at the bottom of the page 
between <%init>code</%init> and when the page is called, the first 
thing that is going to be executed its this <%init> block.

Cheers
-Emmanuel

I think the idea was to be able to output all current variables at any
time in the script.  Which hcan be very helpful in debugging.  A
print_r($_Post) can be helpful.

At least that's what I had gathered for the question.

Tracy,

I don't think the redirect will work until you comment out the echo
statement - You can't have any output in order to re-direct.

Yes, you are right, I would already know the name, but I thought it was
silly that I had to enter it twice.

For instance, I have a function similar to this ...

    function bug($var,$label) {

        echo " $label<pre>";
        print_r($var);
        echo "</pre>";

    }

... And I use it liberally to trace variables and debug:

As in 
    
    if($DEBUG) bug($foo,"THIS IS FOO AND IT SHOULD EQUAL ONE");

But, I thought it was silly that I had to write the name twice, because
sometimes it's obvious what the variable is...


    bug($number_of_rows);


And I wanted to have my output be

    $number_of_rows: 5


The closest solution is to send the variable name without the $.

    function bug($var) {

        global $$var;

        echo "$".$var;
    
        echo "<pre>";
        print_r($$var);
        echo "</pre>";

    }

    bug("foo");

To me, this is kind of silly, too.

It just seems like there should be a simple function to do this. It should
be part of print_r(), which already will say what type of object it is and
will spell out the names of the object variables and associative array keys.

How hard would it have been for them to print out the name of the variable?

First off, this won't work because $number_of_rows is not declared inside
the function, but that's easily fixed.

Secondly, it seems like a silly way to do it. Why doesn't print_r() just
print the name of the variable? If it's sole purpose as a function is to
print out information about a variable, why not just print the name, too?

Obviously, I can and have worked around it for a long time. It just seems
like it should have been added over the years.

For the same reason echo $foo only outputs the value of
$foo. It would be a dangerous assumption to make that
people only use print_r() for debugging and would not mind
the extra output. Plus, as you say, it is trivial to output
the name also, so there is no real advantage and only
disadvantages to such a change.

This code opens and resizes a popup image window perfectly in IE; in

maybe sniff the browser and write different code (aha, there's the php

Yes, but print_r() already prints out a lot of information. It prints out
the object type and whether it's an array and also all the key names and
object variable names.

What other use for print_r() is there other than to debug?

Michael,

I ran into a similar problem about a year ago involving a popup window and 
resizeTo().  It seems to still be up and functioning cross browser 
(including Opera 7) if you want to try some new code:

http://rd.com/common/nav/index.jhtml?articleId=9525144&channelId=1&subChannelId=9 
  [click the goofy little "Memory Master" icon to the right of the content]

Good luck,

Subject: nested objects
Message-ID: <F140z93MgPPf3L9BGTu000002af@hotmail.com>

Can I create an object that, in turn, creates another object within one of 
its functions?

I have a db_class that accepts an SQL statement.  It creates a connection 
thru ODBC and returns a recordset.  I have a foo_class that (tries to) call 
the db_class to fill itself up.  The main PHP page creates a new foo then 
does something like new_foo->get_data.

Procedurally, it works.  I did that to test the syntax and the ODBC call.  
But, when I nest the objects the db_class fails saying Unknown fucntion: 
odbc_exec.  It *appears* that it does not have a valid conn_id.

I probably didn't explain this well, but, I wanted to make sure I wasn't 
breaking any obvious rules before I posted examples.

Am I on the right track?  Thanks for any help.
Michael

In general, you can use classes within classes.  Can you give some more details how and where you instantiate the class? 
  
Something like: 
  
function get_data() { 
   $db = new db_class(); 
   ... 
} 
  
Or: 
  
$db = new db_class(); 
new_foo->get_data($db);

Yes, although technically these are nested objects.  Nested classes (if I
understand correctly) will only be available starting in PHP 5
(http://www.php.net/ZEND_CHANGES.txt).

A trivial example perhaps:

class db_class {
   var $SQLStmt = NULL;

   function setSQL( $stmt ) {
      if( is_string($sql) )
         $this->SQLStmt= do_escaping($stmt);
   }

   function runData() {
      if( !$this->SQLStmt)
         return NULL;

      $recordset = do_odbc($this->SQLStmt);
      if( is_array($recordset) )
         return $recordset;

      return NULL;
   }
}

class foo_class {
   var $DB = NULL;

   var $Name = NULL;
   var $PhoneNumber = NULL;
   var $Email = NULL;

   function getData( $id ) {
      if( !is_numeric($id) )
         return FALSE;

      $this->DB = &new db_class;
      $this->DB->setSQL("SELECT name,phone,email FROM table WHERE id='$id'");
      $tmp = $this->DB->runData();
      if( !$tmp ) {
         trigger_error('runData() Failed');
         return FALSE;
      }

      list($this->Name,$this->PhoneNumber,$this->Email) = $tmp;
      return TRUE;
   }
}

$afoo = &new foo_class;
if( $afoo->getData(1234) )
   echo 'Looks Good';
else
   echo 'Looks Bad';


Hopefully that doesn't confuse things, is along the lines of what you're
doing, and would actually work in a real implementation.

Although there's no reason I can think that a PHP-space function would work
procedurally and not within objects, be careful about using constructors. 
Because of the way references work, you can end up with some funny objects.

Although you only mentioned nested objects, so I should learn not to read

Don't know how helpful this is, but Flash MX has extensions called UI
Components available on its website (under Support -> Developer &
Designer, I believe).  In UI Component set #2 there's a calendar
widget.  With minimal PHP scripting, you can pass date information into
the Flash movie--but you shouldn't even have to, since the Flash plugin
can determine the time on the local user's machine and display it in
the calendar.

Flash movies can easily talk to PHP scripts via "LoadVariables"
commands or the new MX-only "LoadVars" object.  (Your PHP script will
have to do the MySQL work, alas.)  There are many books that can point
you to the write code, including "Advanced PHP for Flash" by Friends of
ed.

HTH,

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.
EMAIL:jkuku at caramail.com

Dear Friend,

SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent
need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and
pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL KUKU JOHNSON
of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the
close aides to the former President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth
of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a
bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately 
decided to divert the fund into a private security
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security
of the said amount is presently being threatened
here following the arrest and seizure of properties of
Col.Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent
Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from
our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent
Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy
foreign partner who can assist us to move this money
out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund
under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe
in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic
Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not
pass through normal custom/airport screening and
clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed
good friends (western countries) who suddenly became
hostile to those of us who worked with the late
President Kabila, immediately after his son took
office. Though we have neither seen nor met each
other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and
convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this
transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The
said money is a state fund and therefore requires a
total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email
address above with your telephone, fax number and
personal information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore
You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this
Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your
Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and
GodBless.

Best Regards
COL KUKU JOHNSON.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] nested objects
Message-ID: <F23mAkxWnefxGZ2Lig40000289e@hotmail.com>

Thanks for your replies on nested objects.  I was hoping to find out if what 
I was doing was, well, do-able.  I hammered away at it last night until I 
got it to work.  I am still not completely convinced that objects in PHP are 
the way to go.  It takes A LOT of code and adds layers of complexity.  I'll 
give it more time to grow on me.  Besides, I've heard knowing when to choose 
procedures or objects is half the battle.

I know php-talk is everything 'AMP' and I have had great fun and success 
with that combination.  But, many of my applications hit a MSSQL datamart.  
I'd like to dump that mart and use MySQL but I'm really hooked on stored 
procedures and DTS for aggregation of disparate data sources and preparation 
of data.  I know I could use Perl or Python to do that.  The tricky part is 
when a user of my PHP app makes a call to a stored proc with parameter.

So... I've been consumed lately with getting SAPDB http://www.sapdb.org/ 
working on a sample application.  I was thinking of moving some production 
PHP apps to that database.  I have found SAPDB to be a powerful database.  I 
see it as a cross between MySQL and MSSQL/Oracle.  The setup was a little 
difficult for me (the windows version was much easier than the Linux) and 
the tuning is fine grained like Oracle, but it is free and cross platform 
like MySQL.  The feature set more closely resembles MSSQL/Oracle with 
triggers, stored proc, and other gaps in MySQL.  The tools available are 
pretty good too.  Once I got it up and running everything goes smoothly.  
Oh, and subjectively, I have found it to be quick.  I am calling the SAPDB 
ODBC driver and not 'Unified' ODBC.

Has anyone else checked out SAPDB?

The development box running SAPDB is:
NT 4.0 sp6a
Apache 1.3.26
PHP 4.2.3
SAP DB 7.4

That certainly is half the battle; probably more IMO.  From initially doing
95% of my code OO, I've leveled off at about 20%, if even that, and have
discovered better mantainability, performance and overall design.

With some work, there are ways to emulate stored procedures as far as middle
and front-end work is concerned.  But you're right, stored procs can be hard
to beat.

There's quite a buzz about SAPDB.  I'm anxious to get some time and play with
it, and I've heard many good things so far.  SAP themselves are renowed
business DB designers and it's good to see this kind of activity from them.

This has been my only hesitation to aggressively pursue SAPDB.  ODBC has
scared me in the past and I alway prefer to use native APIs where possible. 
I'll be curious to hear if you run into any issues with ODBC->SAPDB.

And oh, there's always PostgreSQL... pooooor ol' PostgreSQL  :)

Subject: PHP class or PHP application for threading messages
Message-ID: <p05210233ba6f1f5f1486@[192.168.0.2]>

Hello,

I'm looking either for a class or a PHP application for threading 
message like what you see on a bulletin board.

What I'm looking for is something basic and lightweight and portable 
(Unix, Windows) and run on MySQL. I don't need an interface for 
access control or a lot of bells and whistles. But if it come with 
access control, that's ok too if it still lightweight. Ideally, it 
should autogenerate an RSS for new messages posted.

When I say something basic, I'm thinking of a really bare interface, 
like the one you see on the site generated by Manila from UserLand. 
Here's a good example:
<http://backend.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$112?mode=day>

TIA

Cheers
-Emmanuel

Until now I have used very little OO PHP.
I'm about to start a new project and was thinking of heavy usage of objects,
but your quote
now makes me think twice.

I'd very much like to know why you've dropped from 95% to about 20%.
When is OO the best solution and when not.

thanx

Try http://phorum.org/ .  This package uses PHP and MySQL and seems
relatively lightweight.

I'm curious about that statement too.

I'm using objects very heavily, I guess about 95%, with good results on 
small sites with low traffic.

Already maintenance seems to have improved over my old VBScript/ASP 
code, which I had honed down to a pretty efficient set of subroutines in 
#include files over the years, because of my personal preference for the 
object design probably

But I have been wondering how it's going to scale performance-wise

Hi:

I have a very strange situation that may be difficult for me to convey...but either PHP is having problems, or I'm just a jackass.

Here is the weirdo code with some of my attempt to debug. $this->data contains an array of "keys" that need to be replaced with values. This is kind of a ghetto template parser. Everything is fine until I get inside the for loop (which used to be a foreach...but I'm trying everything. Inside that loop, I cannot get $this->data[$key] to print out anything!

I'm just basically looking for someone to see if I'm overlooking something.

Thanks a billion!

hise

     function parse() {
        // Get an array of items such as 'first_name', 'last_name', etc
        $kws = $this->get_tags();

        // If we do have an array of keywords
        if(is_array($kws)) {
            // For each keyword
            foreach($kws as $kw) {
                // Get the value from this object's data hasa
                $value = $this->data["$kw"];  // <-- this has no data in it inside this loop
                // Replace the smac tagged keyword with the value
                $this->body = ereg_replace("<smac>".$kw."</smac>", $value, $this->body);
            }
        }
        return($this->body);
    }

I don't get where you declare data[] array to begin with.  Can you post more
code?  Id try it without the "quotes" since you don't need to interpret any
string w/ it.

	...
	function parse() {
	...

get_tags() basically opens the template file, and, using a regex, compiles an array of keywords found between <smac> and </smac>. That array is then returned to parse().

In that function I had:

while(list($key,$value) = each($this->data)) {
	print($key . " = " . $value . "<br>");
}

Above the is_array() check

And I got what I expected:

first_name = Jeremy
last_name = Hise
email = jhise at nextsource.com

etc...

I've tried with quotes, without quotes, if tried a for($i = 0; $i < sizeof($kws); $i++), I've tried every single possible thing that I can think of...

In the meanwhile I've reversed the method and the loop is based on the this->data...but my templates will eventually need to have value-less keys (like "CURRENT_DATE" which will evaluate to the current time).

It's driv'n me nuts

The regex, btw, is "/<smac>([^<>]*)<\\/smac>/i" used with preg_match_all().

Thanks for everyone's input.

I'd focus on the array ($kws) actually returned by $this->get_tags().
It seems like your code would only work if the $kws array had keys named 
after your keywords, and not values named after them. In other words, 
make sure

foreach( $kws as $key=>$value ) {
    print "$key=>$value";
    }

isn't saying something like:

0=>first_name
1=>email

etc.

Subject: Newbie question: extract categories and display once
Message-ID: <BA708CEE.37DD%james.byrne2@ntlworld.com>

Hi,

I am creating a MSQL database of articles, all labelled by categories - i.e.
marketing, copywriting, ecommerce and so on. I want to display the links to
these articles  on a web page, sorted by category. I only want to display
the category name on the web page once - and underneath that, all the
articles that fall into that category, then the next category name and all
the articles under that that fall into that category, and so on.

I can extract and display the links to the articles easy enough, but can't
think how to make sure that the category name prints only once - at the top
of category list. Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Jim

I'm in charge of a fairly large intranet web-tool, and I must say it was a
blessing to have done a 95%  "very relaxed" OO. Again, it's just IMHO and
probably biased coming from a heavy OO C++ / Java school, but now that the
team is growing, maintenance and scalability have been very manageable.

Anyway, traffic on my tool is not the main concern --scalability and
robustness are-- so I'm not really that worried about the overhead that
objects add to execution time.

I guess you could try to write your code to avoid some of this overhead,
but you also achieve good results through an optimizer, profiling, etc...
and still don't sacrifice your code.

I can't really say how folks who handle massive traffic (e.g. Community
Connect) work, but for application development, I'd recommend an OO
approach and including the objects you need on your pages.

I'm curious about that statement too.

I'm using objects very heavily, I guess about 95%, with good results on
small sites with low traffic.

Already maintenance seems to have improved over my old VBScript/ASP
code, which I had honed down to a pretty efficient set of subroutines in
#include files over the years, because of my personal preference for the
object design probably

But I have been wondering how it's going to scale performance-wise

Subject: Experience in templating...
Message-ID: <007701c2d301$e45048d0$96721d18@enobrev>

I'm working on a php class that communicates with an external api.
Basically it takes form data (my forms), posts it to the api, and shows
the data returned, be it within another form or a plain display page.  I
want to distribute my set of files (mostly html forms with php generated
values) which uses this class.  I use my dropdown class as well for
creating dropdowns in the forms.  It's a small set.  I've never worked
with the larger template systems like Smarty, although I've heard good
things.  In my opinion, Smarty is probably too big for this little job.
 
What methods have you guys and gals used in order to keep forms easily
editable by Joe HTML?  Do you build your own template systems?  Do you
know of smaller ones available?  Can you recommend anything?  I prefer
to write my own stuff when possible, but i'm not entirely opposed to
using solid and well formed open source code.
 
It's still too early to supply links, but I hope this may be general
enough to get some help.
 
Thanks!!
 
Mark

Well as I'm sure many realize, these types of talks can turn religious very
quickly.  So, I'll try to keep it short and unbiased (ok, maybe not :)

<philosophy>
IMHO, Object Orientated design is exactly that... orientated towards objects.
 Some things fit nicely into objects and some things don't; for example I
find physical world entities can be represented nicely by objects in the
digital realm, as well as certain, well-defined process flows.
</philosophy>

While there has been a great progression in OOP to accommodate things that,
in my opinion, don't fit very well, PHP4 can still be considered limited when
it comes to these advanced OO techniques.  Overcoming these limitations incur
overhead, both computer related and human related..  Add that most
environments are very dynamic (especially intranets, where I spend most of my
time) and the encapsulation that OOD provides becomes more of a hindrance
than an asset.

Right now my general technique is to code the project out, procedurally, and
get all the requirements met with working and potentially production quality
software.  Then, as I start to see commonality and the potential for
encapsulation, either within the same project or across several, I'll fold
things together into classes.  Again, this often ends up being physical world
entities (i.e. patients, appointments, clinics, medical data, etc) and
well-defined processes (i.e. a patient has an appointment at a clinic,
appointments are cancelled, a patient is diagnosed, etc).  Generally I then
operate on the objects with functions and well-placed methods for enduring
operations of a particular entity.

It's a fine line, certainly.  IMHO, OOD, especially that available in PHP4,
lends itself best to static situations.  Dynamic jobs, such as reporting,
data-mining, etc. I find best accomplished with procedural design.  With PHP5
I'm expecting to increase OOD in certain regards.  Would well-defined
processes such as shopping carts, catalogs, etc. deserve larger OOD
percentages?  Sure.  But with the heterogeneous, "here today, gone tomorrow"
and "it's never finished" environments I'm mostly involved with, I've found
libraries are suited best, with procedural design giving the most
flexibility, and often performance.

Performance.  While I don't believe OOD is inherently slow, there is a
penalty... especially when you begin dealing with arrays of objects, nested
objects, and complex structures.  My primary sites are not high volume, but
they do incur fairly "heavy" volume.  So a single page hit could easily pull
5000 records from a 10 table Oracle join, pull 10000 from MySQL, mix them,
filter them, mash them, and then finally make the presentation.  I have done
these types of jobs with both OOD and procedurally, and notice that PHP loses
the "snappiness" it's renowned for with the former.

Lastly, Carlos makes an excellent point.  A lot is what you're comfortable
with, and what design logic your used too.  For me it's primarily procedure,
while for someone else it may be OO.  Above all, if it works well, it's good.

Best,

I dunno ... I took about an hour the other day to look around @ it and it's
not really big @ all ... it's actually pretty nice, if you look @ the two
indexes (index.php and index.tpl) its pretty trivial to figure out.  Id
recommend it, in fact probably going to rewrite a previous project w/ it.

I'm curious about that statement too.

I'm using objects very heavily, I guess about 95%, with good results on
small sites with low traffic.

Already maintenance seems to have improved over my old VBScript/ASP
code, which I had honed down to a pretty efficient set of subroutines in
#include files over the years, because of my personal preference for the
object design probably

But I have been wondering how it's going to scale performance-wise

can you get $kw? because this foreach does not look right...

foreach($kws as $kw)

Don't know much about this syntax.  But I think this is missing the values 
like this

foreach($kws as $kw => $value)

Hi:

I have a very strange situation that may be difficult for me to convey...but 
either PHP is having problems, or I'm just a jackass.

Here is the weirdo code with some of my attempt to debug. $this->data 
contains an array of "keys" that need to be replaced with values. This is 
kind of a ghetto template parser. Everything is fine until I get inside the 
for loop (which used to be a foreach...but I'm trying everything. Inside 
that loop, I cannot get $this->data[$key] to print out anything!

I'm just basically looking for someone to see if I'm overlooking something.

Thanks a billion!

hise

      function parse() {
         // Get an array of items such as 'first_name', 'last_name', etc
         $kws = $this->get_tags();

         // If we do have an array of keywords
         if(is_array($kws)) {
             // For each keyword
             foreach($kws as $kw) {
                 // Get the value from this object's data hasa
                 $value = $this->data["$kw"];  // <-- this has no data in it 
inside this loop
                 // Replace the smac tagged keyword with the value
                 $this->body = ereg_replace("<smac>".$kw."</smac>", $value, 
$this->body);
             }
         }
         return($this->body);
     }

Subject: Newbie question: extract categories and display once
Message-ID: <BA71026B.37FF%jim@quickneasyimage.com>

Hi,

I am creating a MSQL database of articles, all labeled by categories - i.e.
marketing, copywriting, ecommerce and so on. I want to display the links to
these articles  on a web page, sorted by category. I only want to display
the category name on the web page once - and underneath that, all the
articles that fall into that category, then the next category name and all
the articles under that that fall into that category, and so on.

I can extract and display the links to the articles easy enough, but can't
think how to make sure that the category name prints only once - at the top
of category list. Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Jim

A down and dirty way would be to define a variable which is initially blank
or null.

At the top of your loop which you use to iterate through the articles check
to see if the category associated with the article is the same as that
stored in the variable.  If it is different, pump out the category info and
set the variable to the category you just output.  If it is the same, skip
outputting the category info.

This assumes that your query which obtains the data brings it back in
category order.

Jim

Message-ID: <F42bhyF2fPmsSVhGOD600000398@hotmail.com>

The Zend Studio offer looks inviting.

I usually do my work in a simple text editor -  metapad 
(http://www.liquidninja.com/metapad/) in windows or Kate and Quanta 
(http://quanta.sourceforge.net/) in Linux.

Do I really need this IDE?  I am comfortable in a text editor, but, I'm not 
a zealot for *the purity* of it.  Obviously it is a matter of personal 
choice.  I'm open to opinion/suggestion and would like to hear from others.

Then again, who could resist "support your local community at the same 
time."? Let me reach for my wallet. <grin>

Michael

foreach($kws as $kw): $kw will get the values of the array
foreach($kws as $kw => $value): $kw will get the index values of the array and $value the actual values (as $kw did in
the first example).

Hi, folks, this is Matteo Rinaudo. I want to present my open source
framework, PanamaSuite. Only localization is featured right now, in
version 0.5.0: Portal AdvaNced Administration and Maintenance
Application Suite is a package of PHP OOP components such as classes,
modular and ready-to-use web applications like locales support,
connection to databases, forum, newsletter, poll, faq, administrative
control panel and other portal features). It simply uses PHP4 and MySQL.
Interbase and other datasources will be easily implemented in the
future, thanks to the modular vision of the implementation method: the
secondary classes inherit from the main one the methods of database
connections and query, and therefore it will be enough to change the
main class in order to approach to one various data source.
The next step will be Oracle support and some improvements.
All feedbacks are welcome.

Best regards,
Matteo Rinaudo

Message-ID: <OFB7EACAFB.2CCA4796-ON85256CCC.0063BC80@us.ibm.com>






Hi,
(sorry if this gets posted twice, I had sent it on Monday but never saw it
on the list.)


I have a page that deals with a lengthy process, so I'm using flush to
"push" the content as it's processed and give the user a feeling of page
"in process":
Something like this


#start

initialization();

foreach($urlList as $url){


      // execute a lengthy process...
      doLengthyProcess();
      printResults();

      // flush to get the "partial" results displayed.
      print str_repeat(" ", 3000) . "\
";
      flush();

}

restOfScript();


But it's not working... blank page until the end of execution.  I believe
it's more of a server / client issue (rather than php), and have to do some
homework on this; but I thought it would be nice to see if anybody wants to
share ideas or suggestions on how you've worked with this situations in the
past.

I'm running php4.3.0,  IBMHTTPServer (ibm's apache build), no mod_gzip,
over Linux... testing on IE 5.0, Netscape 4.7 and Opera 6.0... all failed.
The 3000 in the str_repeat is just any number... just trying to fill any
buffers that might be preventing this from working properly.

txs,


Carlos

If anyone here is familiar with Java's "synchronized()" block, where a block of code will run as a separate thread and be forced to wait if another instance of that block is running?  If so, does PHP have its own version of that?

php isn't multithreaded (unless there's a lot of new syntax that i'm 
unaware of in the latest version :).  so you don't need synchronized.

I think ultimately it's up to the client end (browser) even though once I realized that breaking up my one giant table into smaller tables would cause the browser to render each table as it was sent. But that was unpredictable based on browser and browser version and I hated it because it affected the way I coded.

You can use the sem_* functions for this behaviour to synchronize PHP scripts
executing across multiple apache processes.  They are wrappers around the Sys V
IPC functions, and are typically used to control access to shared memory or
resources that can suffer from concurrency issues.

See:
    http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.sem.php

I've tried "flush"ing with other products as well as PHP. It actually 
depends on the browser supporting a certain feature and I haven't found 
it to work right (meaning reliably) in any browser. I've basically given 
up on trying to use it.

There are many different reasons why this might not be working, and most
involve buffering somewhere (you mention mod_gzip, so I assume you are aware of
some of these issues). I wrote this simple script a good while ago to play
around with flush:

------------------------------
<p><b>Here is an example of a time-delayed list:</b></p>
<ul>

<?
flush();
sleep(3);
echo "<li>List item one</li>";
flush();
sleep(1);
echo "<li>List item two</li>";
flush();
sleep(1);
echo "<li>List item three</li>";
flush();
sleep(1);
echo "<li>List item four</li>";
flush();
sleep(1);
echo "<li>List item five</li>";
flush();
sleep(1);
?>

</ul>
------------------------------

You can try that simple test first and see if it helps.

I have also heard that IE won't display content as it is received unless the
first chunk is greater than ? bytes. Of course, testing with multiple browsers
as you are should eliminate these types of anomalies.

To really verify that your server is sending the proper HTTP message to allow
for the effect you seek, you can view the HTTP response by telnetting to your
Web server and issuing a request manually. Something like this:

GET /path/to/script.php HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org

You should see a Transfer-Encoding: chunked header in the response, and there
should be no Content-Length header.

Hope that helps.

It seems that for IE family of browsers, "the first chunk" needs to be
of a certain size. In your example, if I place the following comment
after or before the PHP block, it shows everything as it comes in, if
this is not there, it waits for the whole output and then display it at
once.

I find The Graphic Artists Guild Handbook - Pricing & Ethical Guidelines to
be of great use in this area.  It's really not just for graphic designers,
great for costs too...

This is probably not the immediate answer you wanted, but if you have time,
pick it up and check on page 219.  I got mine from Amazon.

I've been using EditPlus http://www.editplus.com/, a simple text editor with
auto-complete and elementary syntax help.  It does not offer any debugging
capability.  Has anyone used the Zend Studio debugging and if so what does
it offer?

The Zend Studio offer looks inviting.

I usually do my work in a simple text editor -  metapad

(http://quanta.sourceforge.net/) in Linux.

Do I really need this IDE?  I am comfortable in a text editor, but, I'm not

Hi All,

I just installed PHP 4.3.0 on my Win XP system. I'm using CGI flavor
with Apache. Ever since I installed it, instead of getting an apache 404
page for non-existing php files, I get "No input file specified." from
PHP.

Has anyone encoutered it before, if so how to fix it?

Thanks.

I've always looked at creating a web site as primarily
a graphic arts job.  Those sites that were approached
this way have the user requrements in focus.  Of
course, adding the different features as
functionalities of the site is a programmer's job.

I think he meant editor when he said platform, and by Zend he meant the studio.

Message-ID: <8FA07D8665A9D511B80E00B0D068A15105D2107F@ehope16.hew.us.ml.com>

Wondering if anyones come across a similar problem... Probably more of a mysql question - but I'm trying to solve the problem using php.

I need to be able to replace every occurance of a string in many tables, many columns.  The string appears in tables in various places and usually embedded in a string type or var type column... The
string will not be the entire contents of the column so a replace won't work.

Eg: my development database contains url links to the development web site.  When I copy the tables to production, I want to search and replace every occurance of the development urls with production
urls throughout the entire database.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Mike

Many columns, many tables? Ouch.

It seems like the best way to do this, since you're migrating the data 
anyway, is to take the contents of the mysqldump you do to get the data 
out of your development database, and run a search-and-replace operation 
on it before feeding it into the production database.

See mysqldump in the "Backing up your database" section of the MySQL 
documentation-- the sql file you get is plain text, and the data therein 
is processable in a myriad of ways as long as you don't distrub the SQL 
itself.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0302141105070.24318-100000@thighmaster.digitalpulp.com>

Here's one way of accomplishing this...

1. Use mysql_list_tables to grab a list of tables.

2. Use mysql_list_fields + mysql_num_fields to grab a list of fields per table.

3. Use mysql_field_type to find the fields of the type you want to manipulate
(char, varchar, text, etc.)

3. Compile an update statement using the mysql "replace" function to perform
the search an replace. Something like:
    update thetable set data = replace(data,'old_string','new_string');

Another way might be to do a mysqldump of the DB, replace strings in that file,
and load the edited file into the production DB.

Hope that helps.

Andrew

Thanks for the quick response...

I think I found a non-php way to do this:

Mysqldump PROD_DBNAME > PROD_DBNAME.sql; # backup
Mysqadmin drop PROD_DBNAME
Mysqladmin create PROD_DBNAME
Mysqldump DEV_DBNAME | sed 's/OLD_STRING/NEW_STRING/g' | mysql PROD_DBNAME

Or something close to that.

I'm also working on a php way to do it and would appreciate any input from someone who's done something similar... I'll forward my code when it's working.

Thanks again.

Mike

This is actually leading to an interesting question (think it was already
posted a few months ago)

What editor / development platform are you guys using?

I use Eclipse for other languages, but the php plugin is still too
pre-alpha.
Editplus I really like: lightweight, but still very beefy (regular
expression, user definable syntax & auto complete...), but missing cvs, so
good only for smaller one-man projects.

Now the big challenge: I got an enterprise project (here comes the magic
word again -- let's not get religious ;).  Big team, close deadlines,
parallel development, and  I'm very convinced about using PHP for this one.

Suggestions on how to build the ultimate development platform?  What else
besides Zend should I be consider? Anybody used other software development
products with PHP (Rational Rose and ClearQuest are on my mind...)

I use EditPlus for almost all my PHP stuff. I also use Dreamweaver MX
because of its site management features, that is if the script/project
is more than a few pages.

I can't say enough good things about UltraEdit, which sounds like a
competitor for EditPlus (which I've never used).  It's definitely a winner,
though.

Hi Carlos,
I work at a large development organization and while we don't use PHP we are
a major Microsoft house.  For configuration management we use one of two
tools, Visual SourceSafe, or ClearCase.  VSS does not support code merging
therefore only one person can work on the a specific module at a time.
ClearCase,while it does support code merging, I have no experience using it.
A third configuration management tool that I have yet to use but looks very
promising is Perforce (www.perforce.com).  I believe they allow up to two
users for free so you can try the tool out.  I know Perforce does a nice job
integrating into the development environment but that is dependent on your
tool set.

Rational Rose is a modeling tool.  If you are a strong Object Oriented
Analysis and Design shop and are strong with UML (Unified Modeling Language)
Rose could help (you will need very deep pockets to buy this tool).  While
Rose supports forward and reverse engineering (code generation/model
generation) I am not sure it supports PHP.  If you are simply looking for a
nice modeling tool I would recommend Enterprise Architect
(http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/).  It is about 1/20 the cost of Rose and
does a nice job with the visual models.  If your company considers EA to be
too low cost and wants a company with a bigger balance sheet check out
Embarcadero's Describe (http://www.embarcadero.com/products/).

ClearQuest is Rational's workflow tool.  Unless you are well up on software
process and are looking to automate your information flow, ClearQuest is
probably not for you.

This is actually leading to an interesting question (think it was already
posted a few months ago)

What editor / development platform are you guys using?

I use Eclipse for other languages, but the php plugin is still too
pre-alpha.
Editplus I really like: lightweight, but still very beefy (regular
expression, user definable syntax & auto complete...), but missing cvs, so
good only for smaller one-man projects.

Now the big challenge: I got an enterprise project (here comes the magic
word again -- let's not get religious ;).  Big team, close deadlines,
parallel development, and  I'm very convinced about using PHP for this one.

Suggestions on how to build the ultimate development platform?  What else
besides Zend should I be consider? Anybody used other software development
products with PHP (Rational Rose and ClearQuest are on my mind...)

I've been using EditPlus http://www.editplus.com/, a simple text editor
with
auto-complete and elementary syntax help.  It does not offer any debugging
capability.  Has anyone used the Zend Studio debugging and if so what does
it offer?

The Zend Studio offer looks inviting.

I usually do my work in a simple text editor -  metapad
(http://www.liquidninja.com/metapad/) in windows or Kate and Quanta
(http://quanta.sourceforge.net/) in Linux.

Do I really need this IDE?  I am comfortable in a text editor, but, I'm not

choice.  I'm open to opinion/suggestion and would like to hear from others.

Hi all,

I'm using EditPlus and think it's a great tool. Yes it doesn't support CVS
but you can always install http://www.tortoisecvs.org/ and use it with an
extra explorer window open. EditPlus supports almost every know programming
languages. You can also create your own support files (autocomp,
highlighting, etc.) for any file type. It can do cumulative search and
replace (in a dir, in open files, in only the current file, etc.) and when
doing that you can also use regex which I think is simply great. Especially
If you are working with a template system, you really don't need anything
else. Other than EditPlus, there is php edit at
http://ozu.arecom-sa.com/~marms/phpedit.net/
which looks promising in the long run but it still needs a LOT of
development.

Subject: RIP problem on Linux Box...

Message-ID: <OE219WTryeU9PJ08ERc00009b1a@hotmail.com>

Hi all,

I don't know if it's OK to post this message here but I've the feeling that
some of the Linux gurus in this list might help me.
Personally, I'm not a brilliant system admin but I can read and learn. My
problem is that a linux box which stays behind our firewall doesn't seem to
catch RIP announcements from a VPN Server (win2k)  upon client connections
whereas all other win boxes do.
I've googled the RIP protocol and found that I need to run gated or routed
to catch RIP announcements on the network. Is there any other simple way to
make a linux box catch those (which doesn't necessitate gated or routed,
since I'm not going to use it as a router or gateway, I only want it to
update it's routing table) or is it necessary to run a routing deamon?

Any docs, urls, suggestions are highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Kerem Tuzemen

I've used both, and EditPlus doesn't come close to UltraEdit. EditPlus is
probably superior to Macromedia stuff, FrontPage, and other editors with more
fluff than features. If you're wanting a "Windows-friendly" editor, you'll be
hard-pressed to find an equal to UltraEdit.

He's also working on a Linux version, so the large number of programmers who
keep a Windows box around just to run UltraEdit can get rid of it. :-)

Huzzah!

I've been using Quanta Plus on Linux, and I like it but it's a few 
versions short of perfect.
I'm just building the latest version now, though, so maybe it's already 
there? ;-)

Excellent!  I just recently installed Linux on my laptop (yes, up till now
I've been programming PHP on Windows (with SQL Server for the DB)... so now
I'm going LAMP for experimentation purposes and I was trying to figure out
what editor to use.  I've been using Quanta just 'cause it came with the
distro.

Message-ID: <03d801c2d45d$a6eecc70$96721d18@enobrev>

I use HomeSite / CF Studio (basically the same thing) for just about
everything. 

I've tried Zend Studio recently, and although it has a great be it
goodies or php, I'm still getting used to the interface.  There's
something about the display, and I get strange scan lines with it as if
it's too much for my system to handle or something.

Also, since I've been working with more and more designers lately, I've
begun trying DWMX out.  They've added quite a bit, and I was fairly
impressed.  The fact that it requires you to have a site set up blows.
It would have been easier if it brought over all my Macromedia FTP and
(that other one.. Pre-coffee email) and made sites out of those.  But it
does have built in CVS and some pretty decent other goodies...  All in
all it's really a more resource intensive HomeSite.  Which is why I go
back to HS.

I've also tried out NuSphere's PHPEd, which seems very similar, IMO to
Zend Studio.  The default settings made my scripts look like crap
because I use actual tabs.  I know it's a no - no, but I like the
quickness of it.  It's supposed to have some kind of port to their soap
class, which I thought was interesting, but I haven't had a chance to
dive in that far yet.

I need coffee :)

	Kerem,

	Perhaps you could just set the linux box's gateway to be a
machine/router that does keep up to date with network changes?  This begs
the question, why doesn't the linux box's current gateway know about these
changes?

	Isn't this typical?  Ask one question and get three in return ;)

Does it go into a directory and search and replace files in there?
The screenshot does not indicate that.

Nope, only opened files. The only editor that I use which has similar
functionality is DW MX, you can do a site wide search and replace, but
that won't go into a directory either.

I'll have to stick with Homesite then. :)
I just hope Macromedia doesn't discontinue it, given the rise of 
Dreamweaver MX.
Homesite doesn't require a site to be set up.  I can make it go into any 
directory to find the target string.

Ive tried em all, editplus, ultraedit, synedit plus bluefish and quanta
plus for linux and until recently I didn't find an editor I really liked
- they all seemed to lack something.  And then I found Jedit -
http://www.jedit.org/ and I haven't looked back since.  It offers
everything I ever wanted, very fast and available for windows and linux.
A really nice feature it offers is folding of functions and classes -
really slick.

Another editor worth mentioning is phpedit - currently only for
windows.  http://www.phpedit.net/

well thats my too cents

Yeah, I'm hoping they don't discontinue HomeSite as well.. I live by it
(literally).  The regex or even plain search and replace via directory,
project, etc is incredible..  It seems like Macro stopped putting much
attention towards it..

I'll have to stick with Homesite then. :)
I just hope Macromedia doesn't discontinue it, given the rise of 
Dreamweaver MX.
Homesite doesn't require a site to be set up.  I can make it go into any

directory to find the target string.

Hi,
(sorry if this gets posted twice, I had sent it on Monday but never saw it
on the list.)


I have a page that deals with a lengthy process, so I'm using flush to
"push" the content as it's processed and give the user a feeling of page
"in process":
Something like this


#start

initialization();

foreach($urlList as $url){


       // execute a lengthy process...
       doLengthyProcess();
       printResults();

       // flush to get the "partial" results displayed.
       print str_repeat(" ", 3000) . "\
";
       flush();

}

restOfScript();


But it's not working... blank page until the end of execution.  I believe
it's more of a server / client issue (rather than php), and have to do some
homework on this; but I thought it would be nice to see if anybody wants to
share ideas or suggestions on how you've worked with this situations in the
past.

I'm running php4.3.0,  IBMHTTPServer (ibm's apache build), no mod_gzip,
over Linux... testing on IE 5.0, Netscape 4.7 and Opera 6.0... all failed.
The 3000 in the str_repeat is just any number... just trying to fill any
buffers that might be preventing this from working properly.

txs,


Carlos

Here's the finished code - I've edited to remove some of my site specific stuff... But basically you need to assign:

$_DB_host
$_DB_user
$_DB_name
$old_str
$new_str

And away you go... Thanks for the great suggestions.  As always, suggestions for improved efficiency greatly appreciated.

An obvious change is checking for field_type and only searching fields that are char, varchar, string, (and possible blob).

---8<---
$dbLink = mysql_pconnect("$_DB_host","$_DB_user","");
$tables = mysql_list_tables("$_DB_name",$dbLink);  // Get a list of tables
while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($tables)) {
        $table_name = $row[0];  // Get the current table name
        $fields = mysql_list_fields("$_DB_name","$table_name",$dbLink);  // Get a list of all columns in table
        for($i = 0; $i < mysql_num_fields($fields); $i++) {  
                $column=mysql_field_name($fields,$i); // Get current column name
                $sql="select * from $table_name where $column like '%$old_str%'";
                $result=mysql_query($sql);
                while($a=mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
                        $old_text = $a["$column"]; // Get the current text value from the column
                        $new_text=str_replace($old_str,$new_str,$old_text); // Assign new_text using replacement
                        $sql = "update $table_name set $column='$new_text' where $column='$old_text'";  // Update the database with new
                        $r=mysql_query($sql);  // do it.
                }

Here's one way of accomplishing this...

1. Use mysql_list_tables to grab a list of tables.

2. Use mysql_list_fields + mysql_num_fields to grab a list of fields per table.

3. Use mysql_field_type to find the fields of the type you want to manipulate (char, varchar, text, etc.)

3. Compile an update statement using the mysql "replace" function to perform the search an replace. Something like:
    update thetable set data = replace(data,'old_string','new_string');

Another way might be to do a mysqldump of the DB, replace strings in that file, and load the edited file into the production DB.

Hope that helps.

Any reason not use the mysql replace function?  You should get a considerable
speed increase when dealing with a lot of rows, and should give you the same
behaviour.  The idea is to replace the select statement you have and the two
sql statements in the two inner-loops with a single update statement, leaving
the grunt work to the DB server.  I have done it below without a where clause
on the update, but that might also be something to add.

This is basically what I had in mind (haven't tested it, just reworked your
code):

$dbLink = mysql_pconnect("$_DB_host","$_DB_user","");
$tables = mysql_list_tables("$_DB_name",$dbLink);  // Get a list of tables
while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($tables)) {
    $table_name = $row[0];  // Get the current table name
    $fields = mysql_list_fields("$_DB_name","$table_name",$dbLink);  // Get a list of all columns in table
    $set_clause = array();
    for($i = 0; $i < mysql_num_fields($fields); $i++) {
        $column=mysql_field_name($fields,$i); // Get current column name
        $set_clause[] = "$column = replace($column," . mysql_escape_string($old_str) .
                        ", " . mysql_escape_string($new_str). ")";
    }
    $sql = "update $table_name set " . join(', ', $set_clause);
    $result=mysql_query($sql);
    if (! $result) print "Query failed: $sql\
";
}

Same here.  UltraEdit is my editor of choice, and with SFTP support and great
PHP highlighting/completion in the new version it pretty much covers all
angles for an editor.

Zend Studio, IMHO, is a differant animal, as it's an IDE.  I don't like the
editing interface as much as UltraEdit (which I even use for binary files at
times), but for all things debugging and PHP, Studio is unparalleled as a PHP
IDE.  It's saved me a lot of pain debugging some nasty loops and the like.

I haven't done routing in ages, but IIRC you'll need a route daemon to
respond to RIP broadcasts, and if I'm not mistaken routed is favored over
gated.

Anyone know what would have changed in 4.3.0 that would hinder my attempts to 
upload files with scripts that worked in previous versions?

I had already replaced $_FILES with $HTTP_POST_FILES so that is not causing 
the problems.  I have about 6 sites with the same host that utilize the same 
script so it is a bit urgent.

It appears that the sysadmin performed a standard installation.  Safe mode is 
off, register globals is on.  AFAIK these did not change since succesful use 
of the code.

That should be the other way around.  $_FILES is the thing to use.

Anyway, if you're using the Apache Module version, the required
permissions on directories has changed.  They need to be world readable 
and executable (chmod 705).  Perhaps this is is your difficulty?

I left them as $_FILES but meant to say I tried $HTTP_POST_FILES to see if 
that had any effect.

The odd thing is that I am not getting any errors when I upload a file.  In 
the upload script I am checking that a file was uploaded, the type of file 
uploaded, the size, etc and if a file in the destination directory already 
has the same name as the file being uploaded.  The only time I get any type 
of error is when I am trying to upload a file with the same name as one in 
the directory.

According to PHP, the file upload is taking place.  The database info reflects 
that as well, as nothing is written to it until the uploaded file is 
verified.  Odd.

I have contacted the sysadmin and am awaiting a response.  I am hoping to 
resolve the issue myself but this may not be possible.  Also, I have not been 
able to reproduce the situation on my local machine (LAMP with PHP 4.3.0, 
same as the host server).

Hello everyone,

This is basically just an FYI, but I wanted to notify everyone that there's
some changes with the mailing lists at NYPHP.

All announcements (meetings,events,offers,technical and community news,etc)
will be sent ONLY to the NYPHP Announce list for now on.  They will no longer
be sent to NYPHP Talk.  Also, software release announcements, as we've seen
several of, should be sent to me (hans at nyphp.org), and I'll forward them on. 
NYPHP Talk will be kept strictly for informal discussion, technical support,
community/scene discussion, and the like.

I've taken the liberty of subscribing everyone to NYPHP Announce since it's a
very low-traffic and moderated list.  If NYPHP Talk gets too busy for your
Inbox, be sure to stay subscribed to Announce and you'll be able to keep up
with all the major news.

If there are any questions, comments or errors found in your subscription or
account at NYPHP.org please contact me offlist (hans at nyphp.org).

Best regards,

That's a good sign... at least the file is getting there... somehow.

Smells like uploaded... tastes like uploaded... it must be uploaded!  So
basically, everything happens as expected, except the file isn't in the
expected directory?  Maybe the admin has changed upload directories or paths?
 What event exactly causes the upload to be realized as unsuccessful?

It must be a sysadmin problem.  http://us2.php.net/ChangeLog-4.php might be
handy to realize any differances between your previous version and 4.3.0, but
none come to mind off the bat.

Best use fsockopen():

$fp = fsockopen('example.com',80,$errno,$errstr,5);

Which would try to connect to example.com on port 80 with a timeout of 5
seconds, writing any error code or string to $errno or $errstr, respectively.

Just like that it works now.  I guess it was an admin thang.  Thanks for the

Please forgive me if I'm not adding anything to do the discussion, but on your page that handles the uploaded file are you doing something like:

copy($uploadedfile, "~/uploaded_files/$uploadedfile_name");
unlink($uploadedfile);

? If you are, is the copy command complaining at all?

Keep in mind that when you do an upload, it's placed in a temporary location until you copy it somewhere else and delete the original (unlink()).

Can you put up the source code that handles the uploaded file?

Thanks!

hise

Oh drat, I knew it was something simple. Thanks, Hans.

For any PHP developers lurking on this thread, it would be really great 
to have a settable timeout in the wrappers-- I hate watching my pages 
hang because some other site is down. :-(

Cheers!

OK, no comments please  :)

I'm now incharge of CF development, and while things have been moving "well"
there's one issue I can't seem to get past easily.

Basically there is a CF app on IIS under Windows 2000 with a login process
that I have no control over, nor access to.  My only ability is to place a
link on the protected CF page that will bring the user to a PHP app on a
Linux server across campus, which also needs to know who the user is.

The most obvious way to do this is to create the link in the CF app to
contain a GET variable with the username in it.  OK fine, this would work,
albeit weak.  Of course, we're dealing with computer illiterate medical
students, so 9 times out of 10 this would suffice.

Yet, it scares me, so I want to add a couple additional checks.  Basically my
question is, how could I get a MAC address, CPU ID, or some other identifying
tag (not IP) from the IIS server, which I would then pass in the URL to my
application.

Additionally, to keep the pesky students in check, I'd like to encode the
information so it becomes less obvious to them what we're doing.  Ideally,
I'd like PHP's base64_encode() functionality.  Also, does ColdFusion have
anything like PHP's serialize() ?

Security through obscurity, gotta love it.  Other ideas are welcome, but we
are dealing with a considerably limited environment.  And CF code examples
would be greatly appreciated  :)

Thank you,

H

I have been working on an SNMP project in VB (also, no comments please...) and 
a lot of usable data is passed by an SNMP agent.  You can get a Win32 agent 
from a Win2K disk and of course there are free agents for Linux servers as 
well.  I have not looked for SNMP projects in PHP but I bet you could find 
something on Sourceforge that would suite your purposes. (Look into BER 
decoding as a start).

With the right code, you could easily obtain the MAC address of the 
originating server and check that against your MAC address on record.  
Although encryption might be difficult to handle in this case, what med 
student would be sniffing packets on port 161?

Just a thought since SNMP is new to me, but someone may have a better idea 
that would be easier to implement.

Hans,

I didn't get to my second cup of coffee yet, so please excuse me if I'm off track.

If you want to make sure that GET variables are not tampered with on their journey across the network, you can MD5 them
with a magic key and then the keys integrity on the receiving side.

For example, if you want to pass ?name=hans
do something like $key = md5('this_is_a_magic_key'.'hans')
and then pass: ?name=hans&key=$key

Remember, that the name/key pair will always match! Using a time based key would be even more secure, or a pseudo random
key that each key in the set can only be used once, even better!!

Okay, where's my coffee?

Of course, you'll need to md5 the query string on the coldfusion side,
so this will probably come in handy:

Hans,

It looks like you have gotten some info already on encrypting the data.
Here are my two bits:

The remote address in cold fusion seems to be cgi.remote_addr from
(http://www.evolt.org/article/Session_Hijacking_Cold_Fusion_Dynamic_Proxies/
20/3516/?format=print )

and for more encryption dlls (free) for IIS check

Developing in ColdFusion can be fun. I lead a team of ColdFusion developers for
about three years and enjoyed it very much. My only complaint was that it felt
more like writing HTML than it did programming. :-)

> I'm now incharge of CF development, and while things have been moving "well"

I actually wrote a specification for something called Cross-Domain Session
Management (CDSM) once upon a time, and there are some major Web sites that are
using it. It is basically a method of doing exactly what you are trying to do
that is:

1. More secure than passing a single session ID on the URL.
2. Completely reliable - no legitimate user will be impacted negatively.

First, I would like to suggest that you do not try to determine a MAC address
or do anything below the HTTP protocol layer. It can offer more security to dig
into TCP/IP or deeper, but point 2 above will be lost (so ignore this advice if
that is not a concern).

Consider an HTTP request that looks like this:

GET /land.cfm?cdsm_token=XXX
Host: www.otherdomain.com
Accept:
text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,video/x-mng,image/png,image/jpeg,image/gif;q=0.2,text/css,*/*;q=0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Galeon/1.2.6 (X11; Linux i686; U;) Gecko/20020830
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress;q=0.9
Accept-Language: en-us, en;q=0.50
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1, utf-8;q=0.66, *;q=0.66
Connection: keep-alive

There are a bunch of HTTP headers available as $_SERVER['foo']. You can use
these combined with an extremely small window of time (I recommend no more than
60 seconds, preferably more like 30 or less) to make impersonation (session
hijacking) extremely difficult.

Using a random collection of the HTTP headers, create a fingerprint (while the
user is on your site, of course) of the user agent. If you md5 the User-Agent
and Accept headers, this will suffice. However, to add some integrity
protection, you should include the timestamp you create (next step) in your MD5
calculation.

Now create a Unix timestamp of the current time in GMT.

Create a string like this:

ts=1045732163&ua=e87189e54561ae899fb016c42177b96e

The ua is the md5 of the timestamp appended to the User-Agent header appended
to the Accept header.

Encrypt this string using a symmetric algorithm. I built a triple DES CFX tag
for ours, so we also added the initialization vector to the above string. The
receiving site just needs to be able to decrypt the string to get the ua and
ts.

In order to only allow for a tony window of opportunity, you must create a
launch page (I'll just use XXX for the CDSM token):

<cflocation url="http://#url.domain#/land.cfm?cdsm_token=XXX" addtoken="no">

(forgive me if my CF syntax is wrong; it's been a while)

So, all links to the external site will be links to your launch.cfm page, and
you will pass the external domain on the URL:

<a href="./launch.cfm?domain=www.otherdomain.com">www.otherdomain.com</a>

Alternatively, you can of course modify this example to allow the other site to
redirect the user to somewhere else in their site after CDSM authentication, so
that you can add the final destination to your token and allow for links to
anywhere on that other site.

Some FAQ:
1. What if someone is using a browser that doesn't have a User-Agent header,
Accept header, etc?
It won't matter, as long as both you and the receiving site use NULL or the
empty string when a header is absent. If you're programming in the same
language, don't worry about it, because this will be consistent.
2. Can I use the Referer header to make sure the user is coming from the right
place?
Yes, you can even add what the Referer should be in the ua variable. However,
if you deny access to those who fail to pass the correct Referer header, you
can negatively impact legitimate users.
3. Is this 100% secure?
No, but it does not negatively impact the legitimate users and makes it damn
hard for the bad guys. :-)

Hope that helps at least give you some thoughts.

Chris

Hans,
I may be paranoid, but I'd use a different approach (IMO more secure).
When a user logs on to the ColdFusion server generate a unique ID - session
id or something to that effect. Store it in a database with the username,
User-Agent string, and the IP address of the client. Of course that row
should be deleted when the user logs out or expired after X minutes of
inactivity. Next write a small CF script (check.cfm) that will respond only
to requests sent from the IP address matching your Linux/PHP server. This
script would take the said unique ID as a GET var and echo the associated
username, User-Agent string, and the IP address from the database.
Now when you redirect the user from the CF app to your PHP add it would be
done with a link like this one:
http://linux.server/verify.php?id=737b8a3cfa90cda3bc

Your verify.php would issue a request including the ID as a GET var (using
fopen) to check.cfm on your IIS/CF server. check.cfm would query the
database for the username, User-Agent string, and the IP address associated
with the ID and echo the results. The output would be captured and parsed by
verify.php. If the returned User-Agent and IP address match
$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], a PHP session is
established and the returned username is stored as a session var .. and life
is good.
Of course you may apply encoding/encryption on top of that.

I started working on one about a year go. But there wasn't enough 
"community interest" and the backing client folded so it was shelved. 
Other than that, I don't know of any PHP based POS systems, but that 
doesn't mean they don't exist.

Hi All,

I'm trying to setup some forums on multiple sites such that you'll only need
to sign-up once and will have access to the forums on all the sites.
Each site needs to have full control of it's forums, so having them all
share the same forums installation won't really work for me.

Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas on the best way to go about doing
this ?
It can be using any "standard" forums package (like phpBB, inovision, etc).

thanks

I was going to do this for sites that I manage, but decided not to due 
to privacy concerns.
I can see how it would be very convenient, however. I'm sure some folks 
have already done it.

If you wanted to roll your own you could do it by redirecting the user 
to a central authority that would check the user's credentials and then 
redirect them back to the remote site with an encoded login key in the

Probably better ways?

I started working on one about a year go. But there wasn't enough
"community interest" and the backing client folded so it was shelved.
Other than that, I don't know of any PHP based POS systems, but that
doesn't mean they don't exist.

Are the sites on the same server or not?  If not, are they with the same 
ISP?

I think you would have to set up a registration authority.  Each forum 
would have its own nonpersistent cookie.  When you enter a forum, you would 
enter your global username/password, which you've set up on the 
registration server.  A background process would run verification against 
the registration server (protected HTTP/Curl, SOAP/XML or maybe something 
akin to a DNS query like the RBLs use) and return a go/no go.  If go, the 
forum sets a cookie.  If no go, you're thrown to the registration server to 
create an account after X numbers of tries.

Same server - no.
Same ISP - yes.

The sites are actually be hosted on different dedicated servers.

Hi everybody,

I've got a jpeg file and I need to add some drawings

regular html div box ), but I'm still struggling with
drawings. I have GD libraries installed. I would
appreciate your help, guys...

Be sure to read the comments as well.

After you open your jpeg, you can use all the image functions to create your lines and text.

GD is a great tool, but I found it to be pretty resource intensive en masse.
If you're doing a lot of images, like watermarking for uploads on a members
site, I would recommend ImageMagick if you have it available.  I'm not sure
if it comes with regular server setups but it's been at most LAMP hosts I've
worked with.

No problem. Mark is right though. Depending on what you are doing, you'll probably notice it's not the fastest thing in the world. I used it once for resizing images to thumb-nails on the fly...bad move. It takes way too long for any kind of production use...unless you have a blazing machine.

Well, I don't have a blazing machine, but I hope it's 
not going to be that slow if I just draw several lines
and add couple of numbers. But if it will, I'll use
Mark's advice. Thank you, guys.

You can either restrict access or not. A spider is basically an anonymous user,
so anything you do to let a spider view restricted resources removes the
restriction.

Sure, you can check the User-Agent header to see if it matches a known spider,
but your authentication is effectively reduced to someone sending this header,
and if you can find User-Agent strings for known spiders, so can an attacker.

This is an awful suggestion, and I do not recommend doing it, but one way would be to set up a google user/pass, submit the url http://user:pass at www.domain.com/protected to google. That way google would get in, get a cache and an index. Then you'd have to refuse access for that user/pass pair based on user-agent.

Messy, and bad practice, but there for informational purposes only. Please don't do it.

Hi Michael,

On the non-technical side of this, I think it's a bad idea.
Lets say technically you could allow the google spider to visit certain
pages without registration.

1. A user does a search on google and one of the results is a "restricted"
page google indexed.
2. The user clicks on the link
3. The user gets redirected or a note saying that in order to view the page,
they need to register.
(4. I'd then go back and look for the Cached link to view the page, but lets
say you used the noarchive meta header so google won't cache the page.)

At this point, I'd be very frustrated, feel like you tricked me and never
visit your site again.

IMHO you should re-think how to improve your ranking without giving the
google spider special privileges.
Many sites do this by showing just a teaser of the information to non-regged
users.  http://safari.oreilly.com  is a good example of this. You could then
still use all the meta tags you want and hopefully get most of the benefit
without deceiving people who get to the site via google.

Chris,

This was along the lines of what I was thinking and possibly using the
remote_address in conjunction to further limit the access.  I don't know if
this is feasible since from what I have heard of Google, their bots can come
from anywhere.

Ophir,

We have tried a number of ways to raise the ranking of one site, but nothing
seems to make much of a difference.  Our thinking is that the site appears
small since so much is hidden behind free registration and that we are up
against tough competition (the US government) who offers alot of pages under
several domains and incestuous links between related sites. 

I was thinking that if we opened up the free content to spiders, more people
would be aware of us, and even if they were faced with free registration,
that we offer a unique service in the field and that it would be ultimately
worthwhile.

The noarchive meta header is a great suggestion and one that I will
investigate further.

Thanks for your input.

Mike

Here's what I did to improve my site in the rankings.
I made an invisible link on my opening page. (TOP LEFT, right below the WIRE
image) and that image links to:
http://www.sohh.com/meta_crawl.html

This file contains all the links to my site that I want indexed by spiders.
And when I submit to search engines, I submit:
http://www.sohh.com/meta_crawl.html

I'm usually in the top 5 when people search for Hip-Hop.

Hi, 

has/is some one work(ed/ing) with pear? i managed to install pear but since i didnt know i had to change the include_path in php.ini, the pear installation has installed pear in the c:\\php4win\\ where i have the rest of the stuff from the php4.3.1.zip. but it has created a new c:\\php4 and has a 'pear.ini' in it, nothing else. since the installation after completion adviced me to add c:\\php4win\\pear to the include_dir and the c:\\php4win\\ to the PATH, i changed the php.ini settings. now a <? php_info(); ?> displays include_path as .;c:\\php4win\\;c:\\php4win\\pear.

do i need to move the pear.ini to somewhere other than c:\\php4? i am asking this cos a 'pear help' on the commandline spitted out bad command of file name, command not found....

wots to be done, someone tell me plz

and wot does this mean?
<form name="grabber" action="<?= $PHP_SELF ?>" method="post">
<select name="rdf_source" onchange="window.document.grabber.submit()">
 <option value="1"<?php if( 1 == $rdf_source ) echo " selected"; ?>>Slashdot</option>

I think the values given to the options just means that
$rdf_source contains the values 1 thru 4.
if 1 == $rdf_source
same as
if $rdf_source == 1

Do not know anyting about PEAR.
I thought that PEAR was include in the latest PHP
release of 4.3.1

Even with the bagels arriving late (perhaps we were the last delivery on
Hans' route last night?), it was a great meeting.  Many thanks to Adam
Trachtenberg and David Sklar for their fun and interesting presentations and
of course the books which we jealously gave away.
I think that we had about 50 attendees which were all comfortably
accommodated through Digital Pulp's busting out of every chair and couch in
the place.  Thank you very much Andrew for getting this coordinated.
For those who could not make the meeting, I hope to post some pictures and

I thought it was a great meeting. This is my second one and both have 
been great.

I am new to programming and PHP and I have enjoyed how the 
presentations are a good combination of practical information for 
newbies like me (caching, data filtering) and then some more detailed 
stuff (like web services, code optimization) that I hope to be able to 
use when I get to that level.

Great job to Hans and the rest of the team that puts together the 
meetings.

Hi, 

Could some one refer me a free CRM software programmed in PHP
has Chinese, Korea, Japanese and English languages version? Also
your team can do the support.
We are a marketing company, try to do this kind of business like
www.salesforce.com. We can do a revenue share program.

Thanks

Hi Ly,

OSSuite is in the process of building a php application similarly to
Salesforce.  We just completed the specs and will proceed with coding soon.
If you're interested, you can collaborate with us.  Otherwise, you can find
feature lacking CRM apps such as Tutos, Relatas, phpCollab, and openCRM on
Sourceforge.

Last night was my first meeting and I enjoyed it, was a nice job.  The only
few things that I wished were discussed were SOAP services from the server
side via PEAR::SOAP (vs. client discussion), easier defining of public
functions, etc (.php -> .wsdl, etc).  The other question I had about
intelligently handling WSDL in an IDE was something I thought Id find an
answer to :-)

Looking forward to more good discussions @ future meetings ...

I haven't actually used any of this, but Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/)
has a PHP plugin (http://phpeclipse.sourceforge.net/) and a WSDL viewer
(http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/wsdl-viewer/) so you may be able
to do what you want with that.

Close ...

What that gives you is a more graphical view and representation of the WSDL
...

http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/wsdl-viewer/images/amazon1.jpg

I had been hoping for some more associated with inline programming (like a
smart complete function) where you could code or associate an array to
strictly adhere to what was in the WSDL file ... like:

$wsdl_function => [tab] -> list of available functions via the API

A while ago when the spec was just released I had attempted to build one
using JPadPro from Modelworks (www.modelworks.com), I just wanted to see
what other IDEs might have such a function before going back.

Message-ID: <20030226165259.59584.qmail@web20707.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi everybody,
I've got a problem here which bothers me a lot. I have
a jpeg picture which I insert with
createimagefromjpeg. After that I try to draw lines of
different colors on top of it, but the colors are
completely different from those I define with
ImageColorAllocate. It looks like there is some kind
of limitation of colors in my jpeg. Any idea?
Thanks,

Elena

It looks like Sun's Forte IDE and maybe Metrowerks's CodeWarrior both claim
to support features like this.

And, after some additional poking around, I think NuSphere's PHPEd

You can try taking a look at moregrouware, available on sourceforge.net. 
It's not precisely CRM, but has a lot of features (Contacts, Calendar, 
To Do, Email, News, etc). I'm not sure what languages it's available in, 
but I'm pretty sure it's no natively English. Although it is available 
in English.

Hi All,

I'm creating a site that requires people to register and login for access to
certain pages.
I want to stop users from giving out their username/password to other people
by denying access to more than one person using the same username at the
same time.

I have a few ideas in my head, but would really like to hear from others
that may have already tackled this problem and what solution they came up
with.

Also, I'm still debating what to do when I find out that indeed two (or
more) people are trying to use the same username.
Do I deny the latest attempt ?
Do I accept the latest attempt and then reject requests from all other
people using the same username ?
etc.

Your best bet is to use session handling with a database to create an AAA
type of system and have the session handler modify the log in and out flags
of a user ...

For more info ...

When the 2nd user attempts to write a session check to make sure they are
not already logged in w/ other credentials.

Well, the 2 methods I've used to solve the problem involve either cron jobs
or running a mini script in my config file which is called by every script
(depending on availability of cron job control).

For starters, Using session handling hasn't always been reliable in my
experience. It's easy to figure you can catch session closes (close browser
or open different page) that you should just log them off, but unfortunately
you can't always catch a session close and run the proper script.  Browser
crashes and different browser set ups don't always allow for it.

Basically, I create a last_hit column (date/time) and logged_in (char(1)) in
my login database.  The script checks all logged_in = 1 and if their time is
greater than set time (usually 10 minutes) it set's logged_in to 0.  And in
order to access any page on the member the site, logged_in must be one and
their last_hit time is updated.  Also, in the login check script, make sure
the user's "logged_in" is not already set to 1.  If it is, they have to wait
0 minutes or someone else is using their login.

Depending on your hardware setup, this could actually be faster with a text
file.

You could also do this with ip's and such, but with dynamic IP's being
changes without notice from ISP's this isn't always reliable.

Regardless of methods, Good Luck!!

Mark

Ophir,

I have never done anything like this yet, but it is a concern on my list of
things to do some day. 

one policy issue which may or may not affect you is whether to allow
multiple logins from the same IP.  With corprations behind a nating router,
its hard to know if this one user with two sessions or two users.

Another example of how things can look abusive: a corporate joe fires up
your site and logs in via the corporate network and then launches AOL  and
surfs to your site again via the AOL network.  He will appear to be coming
from two IP addresses with logins perhaps minutes apart.  

I currently log userid/ipaddress/pageinfo to a table and eye ball it for
abuse by running counts by user.  So far I haven't seen anything abusive,
but I would love to be able to fully automate this.

Mike

	Mark,

	It's interesting that you focus on the end of session as an issue
just as I do.  

	I thought there might be a way to validate a previous/other session
by checking for the corresponding file stored by the session handler. The
issue here is that the session may have timed out but hasn't been cleaned
yet by the garbage collection process.  

	Perhaps there is a way to glean the time value out of the session
string? I would be surprised if the timestamp was not embedded in it.

Message-ID: <01af01c2ddde$97e17a90$2aaf6244@scandinawa1bo6>

OK, this might be a bizarre challenge, but I am in need of a free hosting site that allows for PHP and mySQL (or Access or whatever).  I have been using www.brinkster.com for my free DB needs for 3 years and I absolutely HATE the site!  It is extremely poorly developed as far as a hosting service for the free people is concerned (unless you want to pay like the obligatory $35/mo), and I honestly do not have the budget (as in, no budget) to afford anything that costs.  What would you suggest I do at this point?

Thanx

Out here on LI, Cablevision blocks incoming requests on port 80.  But
if your [cable|dsl] provider doesn't, you can always roll your own at
home, which is what I did for a long time until Code Red prompted
Cablevision to shut it down.

Since you bring up hosting your own, if you can go with Cloud9 I suggest it. After coming from Verizon DSL, I was blown away by their help. I currently have my own PHP/mySQL box running outta the old appartment. Certainly not for production use. Their techies will work with you. I was one of the first to receive their new dsl modem and had problems cause I think both their modem and my router where both trying to do NAT. They totally hooked me up. They walked me through disabling the NAT on their modem and everything was great. They don't block port 80. They really don't seem to care what you do with yer line.

Anyway. If you don't have the budget for jtlnet.com (php/mysql/10Mb @$7.95) then I'm assuming you don't have the budget for DSL.

Wish I could.. Cox here blocks port 80 and monitors rogue ports as well.
Though I probably could get away with it if need be; problem is my home
system is so freakin' unstable it's not worth trying :(

Yeah, DSL is out of my budget, and out of reality; I can't get DSL where I

Subject: OT:ftp EPSV error.. 
Message-ID: <9138BC3B-49EA-11D7-A5BE-0050E4858059@plusfour.org>

Hello from the wild west.

Wondering if anyone has run into this error..  here is the debug output 
from my ftp client, command line Mac OS X ftp client (aka freebsd 4.4 i 
think)..

215 UNIX Type: L8
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.

500 'EPSV': command not understood.
disabling epsv4 for this connection
---> PASV
227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,0,75,203,86)

connection times out..

I am behind a router that is doing NAT, no real firewall.. the remote 
ftp server is behind NAT/Firewall.. the remote server's internal ip 
address is 192.168.0.75. There is one ip address assigned to the remote 
location, depending on the port request made to the remote router.. the 
appropriate internal ip is requested..

Via mac os x command line ftp I cannot see the results of the ls 
command behind the NAT router on a 192.168.x.x ip, but on an outside on 
a world reachable ip i can view the results of ls.

On a windows machine using ws ftp LE and behind the NAT having a 
192.168.X.X ip a LS command times out as well..  Though when the 
windows machine is on the external network, with a 207.33.X.X ip the ws 
ftp client functions normaly..

I can connect to hundreds of machines behind the NAT router, it is just 
this one server i cannot connect to.... and it happens to be a server 
that needs to be reachable from this office (of course) on a daily 
basis for uploading source, and beta builds..

The router that is doing nat locally is a netopia cayman, firewall is 
set to 'Clear Sailing' on the router, meaning i assume not blocking 
anything..

What can be done? on my side or on the server side? In news groups this 
seems to be a BSD ftp client issue.. and a ws ftp client issue, I have 
tried several clients, none of them can connect. I have no idea on how 
to solve this.. we will be loosing the 207.33.X.X network in a few 
weeks (too expensive for T1 access).. how can I trace this? Is there 
anyway possible that it is the remote ftp server issue?

this is the debug from the 'not behind the nat ip'

Any help would be great. How is everybody doing in nyc? I am san

would be super.. thanks

The downside to #1:

The client logs in, starts filling out a long form, gets called away for a 
phone call, returns to finish the form, hits Submit only to find that he'd 
been kicked off by someone else logging in to that account five minutes 
earlier.

The downside to #2:

The client logs in, works for a while then takes off on a long weekend 
without logging out.

#2 is probably the lesser of two evils if you combine it with an inactivity 
timer in the session handler.

But neither really addresses the problem of multiple people sharing a 
login, just multiple people using that login at the same time.  If you can 
solve this problem, university SAs everywhere will build a statue in your 
honor.

Hi All,

I'm creating a site that requires people to register and login for access to
certain pages.
I want to stop users from giving out their username/password to other people
by denying access to more than one person using the same username at the
same time.

I have a few ideas in my head, but would really like to hear from others
that may have already tackled this problem and what solution they came up
with.

Also, I'm still debating what to do when I find out that indeed two (or
more) people are trying to use the same username.
Do I deny the latest attempt ?
Do I accept the latest attempt and then reject requests from all other
people using the same username ?
etc.

Well, the 2 methods I've used to solve the problem involve either cron jobs
or running a mini script in my config file which is called by every script
(depending on availability of cron job control).

For starters, Using session handling hasn't always been reliable in my
experience. It's easy to figure you can catch session closes (close browser
or open different page) that you should just log them off, but unfortunately
you can't always catch a session close and run the proper script.  Browser
crashes and different browser set ups don't always allow for it.

Basically, I create a last_hit column (date/time) and logged_in (char(1)) in
my login database.  The script checks all logged_in = 1 and if their time is
greater than set time (usually 10 minutes) it set's logged_in to 0.  And in
order to access any page on the member the site, logged_in must be one and
their last_hit time is updated.  Also, in the login check script, make sure
the user's "logged_in" is not already set to 1.  If it is, they have to wait
0 minutes or someone else is using their login.

Depending on your hardware setup, this could actually be faster with a text
file.

You could also do this with ip's and such, but with dynamic IP's being
changes without notice from ISP's this isn't always reliable.

Regardless of methods, Good Luck!!

Mark

i dont know if this would help, but if the users are required to sign up, then u can set the field in which u save the user's name to 'unique', this way, even while signing up, it would simplify the cross checking. 
coming to denying the same user name accessing at the same time, im not sure how that can happen. one thing that comes to me at present is that r u looging the sign in time? if thats the case, rnt u checking in regular intervals if s/he is currently logged in? one thing i experienced some time back was this: cos of some server mistake, mu mail account provided by my ISP was overridden ,and when ever i tried to log in, i kept getting an error message "u r already logged in. the inbox is currently in use". i am not sure if this is session related, but if this triggers some brilliant thinking, i'd be happy to have shared it with u all

Great job to Hans and the rest of the team that puts together the

Hi,

has/is some one work(ed/ing) with pear? i managed to install pear but since
i didnt know i had to change the include_path in php.ini, the pear
installation has installed pear in the c:\\php4win\\ where i have the rest of
the stuff from the php4.3.1.zip. but it has created a new c:\\php4 and has a
'pear.ini' in it, nothing else. since the installation after completion
adviced me to add c:\\php4win\\pear to the include_dir and the c:\\php4win\\ to
the PATH, i changed the php.ini settings. now a displays
include_path as .;c:\\php4win\\;c:\\php4win\\pear.

do i need to move the pear.ini to somewhere other than c:\\php4? i am asking
this cos a 'pear help' on the commandline spitted out bad command of file
name, command not found....

wots to be done, someone tell me plz

and wot does this mean?
" method=post>
 ?>>Slashdot ?>>Freshmeat ?>>Linux.com >SwellMob

i dont understand the values given to the option. the script isint working
anyway :-( ...

Well that's why there's a script that resets the expired sessions after a
given amount of time.  Unfortunately the user has to wait the time or
contact the admin to reset their profile.  When I did this for a client's
intranet (it was cf based, but same concept) I had a "reset user" section
(with a dropdown of users) in the super user account and manager accounts.

Fortunately out of the 75 users who used the system regularly, I only got
the reset a session request about twice a week or less.  On another system,
IP addresses had to be registered, but all those users only logged in from
their desks, and it was directly tied to the network admin's dhcp list (that
was a fun one).

It's very hard to control crashed sessions, unfortunately, which I feel is a
serious downfall of browsers as they should allow for application plugs,
imo.  I'm dying to hear of better solutions though :)

Hi All,

I'm creating a site that requires people to register and login for access to
certain pages. I want to stop users from giving out their username/password
to other people by denying access to more than one person using the same
username at the same time.

I have a few ideas in my head, but would really like to hear from others
that may have already tackled this problem and what solution they came up
with.

Also, I'm still debating what to do when I find out that indeed two (or
more) people are trying to use the same username.
Do I deny the latest attempt ?
Do I accept the latest attempt and then reject requests from all other
people using the same username ? etc.

Ophir

I had to deal with this whole situation a couple years ago with an ASP app,
but the principle should work with PHP.

At login the users loginID, SessionKey, and login time were added to a login
table.  The Session timeout was set to 3 minutes.  Each page in the system
contained a hidden frame with a page in it which was set to refresh at 2
minutes.  The refresh would update the login table for this user and session
to the current time and redeliver the same page, but this activity acts as a
heartbeat keeping the session alive. Since it's in a hidden frame, it does
not affect the active page.  This also has the affect of allowing a user to
stay on a page as long as necessary and not get arbitrarily timed out ( they
had one form in the system which took over a half hour to fill out ).

When a login attempt is made and an entry is found for that loginID the
current time is compared to the last activity time.  If the difference is
more than 4 minutes, the connection is assumed dead, the log entry is
archived, and a new entry created for this login.  If the login entry is
still considered active( user shut down the browser without using our logout
feature & right away attempts to log back in ) the user is provided a
message indicating that there is a current session for that userID also with
a message explaining that if that session was an improperly logged out
session from the same user than the login would be unlocked within 5
minutes.

Hope I recalled enough of the details to be useful, it has been a while
since I've needed this type of functionality.

Jim

NAT and FTP are two dirty acronyms that never go together.  My initial take
on this is that the PASV requests are getting confused because both the
remote and local internal networks are 192.168.x.x.  If possible, try using
different subnets on the local and remote internal networks (like one
192.168.0.0/16 and the another 10.0.0.0/8).  This might help.

Other than that, it could be one of many, many, many subleties when working
with NAT and FTP.  Some possibly useful resources (although not specific to
your firewall, the same concepts apply):

I had actually done the same thing on the fore-mentioned intranet.  The
hidden refresh is Definitely an effective way to maintain a short session,
although it does give a slight hit to bandwidth, and also the users with the
nice speakers hated ie's "clicking" on every refresh.

But in reading this I also remembered another solution that came to mind,
which I had never actually tried, but thought might work well.  On one of my
side projects, I had created a socket based chat.  The backend is php (I
started it with perl, but i'm more comfortable with php).  It basically runs
in the bg on my server waiting for socket connections to a specific port.
The chat client is using flashmx' socket goodies (using xml_sockets for
those keeping score).

Now, I know this sounds a bit in depth for user tracking, but the best part
of it is, no matter how flash closes, be it refresh, browser crash, etc, the
socket connection always closes.  So if the connection doesn't reopen within
say 30 - 60 seconds, it can be expected that the user logged off or is
having connection issues and that their session can be closed off.

If you're interested in trying it, I've seen a few socket server scripts out
there.  I have a class I written, but I still have some debugging to do on
it.
Here's some info on it:
http://www.devshed.com/Client_Side/Flash/XMLSockets/page1.html

I guess I may give it a shot eventually.. Once I find a decent gig to keep
my landlord happy.

Nothing yet.. As I said the script I've created still requires some
debugging.  Covering the code end is simple as it's running regex on all
incoming text and only using what it understands, which are xml formatted
instructions, such as <message /> <login /> and <logout />.  On the hardware
end, I haven't gotten that far yet.

So basically, any code can get in, but only the correct code is used.

This sounds just like a method we were going to use before we developed the
"heartbeat" idea.  That was to use a java applet to establish a socket back
to the server to maintain the connection. The idea with the java applet was
that the applet would open a socket to a small socket server running on the
webserver.  It's purpose was to generate the same "heartbeat" we eventually
created with the hidden frame.  Rather than use ASP sessions, the ASP app
would use a table for storing all it's server state.  For security, you had
to have a login to generate a token which was passed back to the client and
added to the login table and used as a session identifier for the state
table.  The heart beat did nothing more than send this token over the
socket.  The only message the server socket understood was open, heartbeat
token, and close.

This method was not acceptable to the customer because they were afraid
there would be users who would not have the ability to run java applets in
their browser.

For the hidden frame "heartbeat", the additional bandwidth was negligible,
it was a simple request generated every 2 minutes and the response was a
minimum html page with a refresh in the header.  The "tick" was annoying,
but the customer was willing to live with it considering the ability it gave
them to not worry about a timeout but also allowed a short ( max 4 minute )
lockout of an improperly logged out session and the ability to ban
concurrent use of a login.

Subject: Using PHP on Linux with Oracle
Message-ID: <20030227200738.16633.qmail@web40309.mail.yahoo.com>

We've had good experiences with our LAMP server but recently ran into a
snag involving Oracle. We downloaded and installed the 800-meg software
bundle from Oracle, which is supposed to allow direct communication
between a PHP script and an Oracle database. (The client libraries were
not divisible from the entire bundle--hence the massive install.)  

We recompiled Apache and PHP using the recommended flags for Oracle
installation.  When we execute our Oracle-accessing PHP scripts using
the PHP command line interpreter, they work fine.  When we try to
access those same scripts as web pages, they work not at all.  Error
messages say that "OCI functions are not found."

Our PHP/Apache/Linux installers came straight from the Red Hat 7.2
package.  Are we running afoul of version problems?  Is there some
trick to installing the Oracle client software?

Please share your experiences...

Message-ID: <20030227203404.5501.qmail@web14301.mail.yahoo.com>

I just started using zend studio 2.6, and I'm having some difficulty
with the debugger and ldap functions.

For example, when I start typing ldap_connect() I get an autocomplete
dialog, suggesting that the function is built in / recognized.  But,
when I debug the script I get an error saying I've made a call to an
undefined function (ldap_connect()).  

The script seems to run fine, and the ldap stuff is working, but it's
preventing me from using the debugger for anything else.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
thanks

Can anyone point to a good comparison  of PHP code caching software such as 
Zend Accelerator or Ion Cube?   Anyone have personal experience with this

We run Apache/PHP with Oracle here. We never install apache/php using the RH Installer. Instead we install everything from source.

Maybe you have two different PHP's installed? Maybe when you reinstalled PHP, you got yourself another one. THat's what it sounds like. Personally, if I where you, I would uninstall the apache and php rpms and then go and reinstall from source...but that's because that is my experience. the php INSTALL instructions are really good...basically you do:

apache -> configure
php -> configure with-apache with-oci8
php -> make
php -> make install
apache -> configure activate-module libphp4
apache -> make
apache -> make install

See the PHP INSTALL for exact details.

Anyway, after doing that, we had to set up our TNSNAMES file for Oracle because the actual oracle database is on another server. Secondly, the oracle installer sucks becuase it seems you need to be able to run X11 for their Java installer..and it is a million megs...totally uncalled for. If you are running the database locally, you may not need to set up your TNSNAMES files.

Good luck..

(around here, we call it whoracle)

I'm debugging locally w/ php 4.3.1.  Maybe that's part of the problem,
if that version is not supported by the debugger?

The local debugger doesn't use your real Web environment but a local version of PHP. Try to debug on the server and then
you'll get the whole environment including your own PHP compilation and any prepends and such.

4.3.1 is the local version that I'm using.  Unfortunately I work at a
university and the server environment is not under my control, so
installing the zend debug server there is not really an option.

Are you out of suggestions yet?
thanks for you help.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Using PHP on Linux with Oracle
In-Reply-To: <200302272008.h1RK7eHF008050@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <1EB2637E-4AA3-11D7-B372-0050E4858059@plusfour.org>

Hi,

I use php as a dynamic module in apache, in version previous to 4.3 to 
compile the apache module in the configure command.. you needed to 
include --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs if you did not include that, i 
believe just the binary would be compiled.. meaning your newly compiled 
php with the oracle library might only be in /usr/local/bin/php and not 
in /usr/local/apache (or where ever the module ends up.. )

I only have experience with dynamically loading the php module, not 
compiling the php module into apache.. But if you can run the oracle 
extension from the command line, and not with apache.. it might have 
something to do with not compiling a new apache module only the binary..

Regards,
Ian

Can anyone help me decipher this error I'm getting in MYSQL?
I'm certain there are rows in my database that contain the word 
"Service" in the "Business_Type" column.

Below is the Select command and the error I'm getting. It's copied 
right of my Telnet program.

mysql> select * from Members where Business_Type = Service;
ERROR 2000: Unknown column 'Service' in 'where clause'


Thanks in advance,
- Steve

You need to delimite Service since it is a constant and not a data column.

ie. mysql> select * from Members where Business_Type = 'Service';

try:

select * from Members where Business_Type = 'Service';

Probably the quotes around 'Service'.

Yes!  This was exactly it!  I admit I'm still learning (right out of a 
book I might add.) But it's amazing how some books leave out the 
simplest details, which cause the biggest headaches (when you are just 
learning).  Thank goodness for this forum! You guys rock! ;-)

Thanks all!

in a nutshell,

if you want free, go with phpa (http://www.php-accelerator.co.uk/)
if you're willing to part with $$$ go with Zend.

also, be sure to look into other places you can improve performance.

as the other posters have pointed out, Service needs to be in quotes... but
that's only half the problem. To get the results you really want (rows which
contain the word Service in Business_Type), use LIKE with wildcards:

mysql> select * from Members where Business_Type like '%Service%';
