Thanks, still have a couple bugs but will have a release 2 soon. As for
a presentation.. what do you mean? you mean at the meetings? I honestly
have not been to one yet.. I have a lot of online tutorials and many
programs I have written, and have a *lot* of sourcecode out there as
almost everything I do, I opensource.
<A HREF="http://www.zend.com/comm_person.php?id=96">http://www.zend.com/comm_person.php?id=96</A> &lt;- me
let me know, perhaps I could show up and talk about some stuff.. but
honestly would prefer to sit in on at least one meeting first... 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds cool to me, too. I've never used it, but are you sure bcompiler
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't already do this?
</I>
I am positive that bcompiler does not do this. bcompiler keep the source
closed so you can attempt to protect your source. What I am doing is
similar to the old 'shell packages' so that files are compressed into
one file that figures out where everything goes depending on user input.
I make heavy use of eval() on compressed code that is eval'd on the fly
but the original source is unpacked so it is not a mechanism you can use
to 'protect' your code.

I am currently mulling over some ideas for integrating 'patch' and
'diff' into php applications so that you could have a 'live upgrade'
option in php apps and that stores diffs and versions so that users
could be notified immediatly that certain files have been updated and
allowed to upgrade just those files at that time. (sort of like what
windows users have with that msupdate thing) I am thinking of offering
that in PHPackage as an option, but it would require a server component
as well. So this may be a plugin for later. Patch used as it is safe for
files that have been changed slightly.. I.e. config options and such
(same reason it is used in cvs)

Anyway... thank you guys for the great feedback.. I would love to see
this used by other people than myself. (oh, the images are encoded in
PHPackage and I have been told there was an issue in windows on IE..
anyone see a broken image?)
