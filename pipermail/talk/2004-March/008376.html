No, that part of the discussion happens when you negotiate your rate. 
The process is followed thusly:

THE ADVERTISEMENT

&quot;The candidate must possess supernatural skills, be capable of working 
without sleep, have the complete software design processes mastered from 
requirements to maintenance, and be expert at programming, databases, 
and systems integration.  This project is critical for the success of 
the business, and the applicant must respond well to immense pressure to 
perform and very tight deadlines.  Required certifications are:  CISSP, 
MCSE, RHSE, and BYOL.  Applicant must also be a 47th-level blackbelt 
regarding security, and have a master's degree in something mostly 
relevant.  Methodologies required are RUP, MVC, PDQ, XYZ...&quot;

THE COMPENSATION PLAN

&quot;As this is a junior-level position with minimal strategic relevance in 
the day-to-day operations of the business, the job will be starting out 
at the rates applicable for an 18-year-old.  In about 10 years, if the 
company is still solvent and you haven't been relieved of your duties by 
one of the forty-seven mid-level managers that you will be reporting to, 
you may qualify for a possibly measurable raise.&quot;
