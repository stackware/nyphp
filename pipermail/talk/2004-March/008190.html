<PRE>I have done the following:
1. Moved php.ini from C:\WINNT\system32 to C:\php  (this is where php.exe is
and other directories for php)
2. modified extension_dir=C:\php  in php.ini
3. stopped and restarted apache, and pointed to php_info()
4. Verified that there is no php.ini in the C:\WINNT\system32

CURIOUS:
The following still show and I have tried to find where and why it is
pointing to these directories to no avail (sigh)
Following is after the changes as above were made:
Configuration File (php.ini) Path  C:\WINNT &lt;&lt;&lt; I moved it here
c:\php\php.ini
include_path .;c:\php4\pear .;c:\php4\pear &lt;&lt;&lt;I do NOT have this dir nor I
pointed to it
extension_dir c:\php4 c:\php4   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I do not have a c:\php4 and I went thru
my php.ini I don't see it.

Thank you in advance, for your time. I do know that it is something very
basic and stupid that I am doing!

And what happens if you change some other setting in the ini file?  Do the 
changes get reflected in the phpinfo output?  For exmaple, change 
display_errors and see what happens.

Well, that's the &quot;official&quot; way to do it, but I think that it's idiotic.  
Just put the PHP directory and the php\dll directory in the system's PATH 
and you're good to go!

I'm looking into using an Model View Controller framework to use as a base
to launch from in developing future projects in an efficient manner, and I'd
like some feedback from anyone who's used one. So I guess this question
splits into 2 threads.

First, what are the pro's and cons to using an established MVC framework in
general, as opposed to using other strategies to split up logic from
presentation? Smarty templates anyone?

Second, what frameworks have you used that you like / dislike? I'm currently
looking into Seagull, after having played with rolling my own for a bit.
Fusebox makes me itchy after briefly looking at the demos and files (the
potentially huge 'controller', and as irrational as it is, the heavy
reliance on passing 'action' variables in the url). I'm mostly looking for
speed, ease of development and deployment, and security.

Thoughts?

I'm using Smarty templates now for &quot;my first big project,&quot; which is an
database that was basically ported to php/mysql from ms access.  We extend
Smarty with a custom class that runs a few extra things (checks permissions
for different templates and different data processing actions based on
login, etc.) and then uses Smarty to parse the templates.  It's great and
very flexible and allows my brain to keep thinking in terms of &quot;data entry
form, module, etc.&quot; as I did with MS Access.

However I feel I honestly have not been able to do as good a job with
&quot;splitting up logic from presentation&quot; as I'd like to.  It's a judgement
call and a thread that comes up here and there on the Smarty forums: how
much do you have to / want to keep them separated?    Since I'm the only
developer on this team, I have, of course, both a lot of flexibility and a
lot of chances to write lazy code.

All in all, though, Smarty and our little extension of it, are serving me
well, and I think I probably am limited more by my own lack of programming
experience/discipline than by the framework itself.

Check out your error logs, they are mysql.err and &lt;hostname&gt;.err in the 
data directory of your MySQL installation.

You should first check your error log
You get there by going to the control panel
and click administrative tasks
and the event viewer

Application
Security
System

these are the operating system

You might find something more enlightening in the MySQL logs.

It is necessary that the MySQL process 
have the correct privileges for the 
directory(s) will  be 
reading and writing to.

Did you check you phpinfo results to make 
certain you are reading the correct php.ini file?

Naturally you checked c:\php\extensions that the php_gd2.dll file was 
there and the web server has permissions to read it.  But, I don't really 
think this is the problem because you'd be seeing error messages saying 
that the file/functions/etc could not be found.

What does the &quot;Configuration File (php.ini) Path&quot; in the phpinfo output 
say?  Does it match the php.ini file you just edited?

Anyway, I'd advise keeping the php.ini file in the php directory itself 
rather than in the system32 dir.

Following is from php_info():

Virtual Directory Support: enabled 
Configuration File (php.ini) Path at C:\WINNT 

This is where I placed the php.ini.  Someone said to copy all .dll and files
under extensions to c:\winnt\sys32 also, which I did.  Was that an idiotic
move?  (Ok, you really do not have to answer that!)

Once again, your patience (as I am a confirmed rookie) and advice is deeply
appreciated!

(Thank you Dan and T. Gales)

advised you:
&quot;Anyway, I'd advise keeping the php.ini file in the php directory itself

Find the diretory where the php.exe file is
(most likely its C:\php)

and move the php.ini (which you edited) from \winnt\system32
to there.

Give it another shot.

Good luck...

I've used a couple different implementations of MVC. 

You have to define what you mean by MVC as it looks to me as if almost 
everyone implementing MVC pushes the definition(s) in new and 
interesting way. 

I've seen MVC implemented different ways.  For example I've seen:

where you've got a php page which is just a hollow shell that includes 
the worker file;
    index.php and indexWorker.php,
    listing.php and listingWorker.php, etc.

where you've got a single php page which based on the use of the site 
loads/includes different worker files:
    index.php and Worker.php, Listing.php, etc.

where you've got a single php page, a logic page and a template:
    index.php and indexWorder.php and index.tpl

Then I've seen it taken to extremes, where every field in a table has 
four different controllers, add, edit, delete and view.  So to do a 
query you'd do something like $a = getTableField('tablename', 
'fieldname');   ,  and getTableField would connect to the database an 
query the database for that specific piece of data.  Personally I think 
this is silly.  Makes maintain the code brutally difficult.  I'd rather 
write SQL.  Mind you I know how to write SQL.

For me the answer is to not use a formal framework design.  Pick a 
design that works for your level of competency and the particulars of 
the application.  If a version of MVC makes it easier for you to 
abstract the logic of the application then use MVC.  If you are 
abstracting the logic of the application you may find that there is 
another logical framework design/topology that works better.  Make your 
code easy to maintain.   MVC may or may not make your code easier to 
maintain.  As far as I can tell there's nothing inherent in MVC that 
would make code easier to maintain.  It's just as easy to write bad code 
with MVC as it is without MVC.

Hope this is helpful.
