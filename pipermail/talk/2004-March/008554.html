<PRE>Hello folks, thank you for your time and answers.  I will drop this thread
since the sys admin is vehemently adamant that he will only install from the
CD that came with the server (IBM), and it is pre-compiled, and does not
have gd enabled, plus PHP is 4.0.6, plus jpgrpah won't work either...b4 I
shoot him I better give up-  Sigh!

Thanks

Hi list:
BASICS:
apache 1.3.27, PHP 4.0.6, IBM server


How does one enables gd on Unix?

I do know that on WIN2K-pro one needs to uncomment the extensions for gd in
php.ini...but in Unix I dont see any listings (gd_php.so, etc)...how can I
find it (so I could tell the admin)... any suggestions?  

Here is what I have from the php_info()
Configure Command './configure' '--prefix=/opt/freeware' '--with-apxs'
'--with-mysql' '--with-config-file-path=/etc/opt/freeware/apache'
'--with-ftp' '--with-zlib' '--with-system-regex' '--without-xml'
'--with-ftp' '--with-ssl'

Configuration File (php.ini) Path /etc/opt/freeware/apache/php.ini 

***no gd info***

SERVER_SOFTWARE Apache/1.3.27 (Unix) PHP/4.0.6

Ouch. So that means it *should* work... but I already rewrote this method
to do all its own SQL and tested it pretty thoroughly. It passed, so I
declared victory and committed it to my little repository. Now I gotta
decide whether to roll back (so to speak) to the previous revision and
wage more war... I was pretty much echoing the hell out of everything. And
yes the tables are InnoDB.

I think I'll go get on the subway now so I can get a front row seat at the

I believe you need '--with-gd' in your configure command.

(And if I'm wrong I know someone will set the record straight.)

Hi-

sorry to bug y'all with these beginner questions...

I made a little uploading site where I can upload various files, works 
great.
Now I want to archive the folders via the same web ui.
I can't tar anything because the permissions of the uploaded files are:
r-------- (ie: 400)
How can I change the permissions (or set them the way I want) on the 
files as I upload them?

thanks,
greg

ps: have fun in Montreal, it's just LOVELY this time of year ;-)

Chances are you will also need to have installed libjpeg and libpng for PHP
to compile with the '--with-gd' option. And of course you will need to have
GD installed on your box as well. I just went through this all last night
and had to add those libraries (of course this was compiling php5 on Fedora
Linux against apache 1.3.9). PHP4 has a built in GD library does it not...
anyone?

Yep.  And zlib.

Here's what it took for me to get a _minimal_ PHP 5 build with GD...

./configure --prefix=/path/to/install \
    --with-gd --with-jpeg-dir=/usr/local --with-zlib-dir=/usr/local \
    --without-pear --disable-ipv6 --disable-libxml --disable-ctype \
    --disable-dom --disable-mbregex --disable-posix --disable-session \
    --disable-simplexml --disable-spl --disable-tokenizer --disable-xml \
    --disable-libtool-lock

I need some extra brains for a design I'm doing.  Since it's going to
involve XML-RPC and PHP, I figured I'd ask here.

I'm putting together a basic shopping cart.  I can't use existing
solutions because the back end database is called jBASE (a variant of
PICK). jBASE lives on the Production Server behind a LinkSys
firewall/router.  The web site sits on the Web Server and is outside of
the firewall. The plan so far is: user submits a request (places an
order, wants to see Product ID# 1234, etc.) to the Web Server.  The Web
Server does some PHP magic and sends the request to the Production
Server via XML-RPC.  The Production Server does some (PHP?) magic and hands
the request to the database via CGI calls. When the Production Server
responds, the process is reversed.

I don't know how to do the XML-RPC magic above, but tht's part of the
fun of the project.  What I Can't figure out is how to securely transfer
the data between the two servers. I need a secure connection from the
Web Server, through the firewall to the Production Server that can't be
cracked by script kiddies and the like. I tried setting up a VPN tunnel
using FreeS/WAN And Openswan and I can't get them working after a week,
so it's time to try something else.

The client insists that this be done in real-time, so I can't have a
copy of the database on the web server.

Any ideas?

I am a unix guy, so I don't know how to implement this in the Windows 
world - keep that in mind.

One approach I took in the past was to use ssh and port forwarding (e.g. 
forwarding port 9876 on the webserver to 80 on the production machine). 
  Then set tcpwrappers to only allow localhost access to port 9876. 
That way your xml-rpc calls can go to localhost:9876...

You are now talking on a ssh-encrypted tunnel to the production machine.

Does that fit the bill?

I curious to see what others say, because I've never done this, 
exactly.  It sounds like a typical web service, but I'm not sure why it 
is needed to be done this way. With proper precaution, can't the web 
server just interact directly with the database through an SSL?

</I>&gt;<i> I'm putting together a basic shopping cart.  I can't use existing

</I>&gt;<i> the firewall. The plan so far is: user submits a request (places an
</I>&gt;<i> order, wants to see Product ID# 1234, etc.) to the Web Server.  The Web
</I>&gt;<i> Server does some PHP magic and sends the request to the Production
</I>&gt;<i> Server via XML-RPC.  The Production Server does some (PHP?) magic and 
</I>&gt;<i> hands
</I>&gt;<i> the request to the database via CGI calls. When the Production Server
</I>&gt;<i> responds, the process is reversed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know how to do the XML-RPC magic above, but tht's part of the

</I>&gt;<i> Web Server, through the firewall to the Production Server that can't be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The client insists that this be done in real-time, so I can't have a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas?

That's the first thing I do with a fresh PostgreSQL installation, at 
least if the webservers are on separate hardware :)

Another alarming phenomenon I have observed is the everything-or-nothing 
approach, where the whole shebang is either completely in the open, or 
they encrypt everything - even stuff that is then public on the website...

For XML-RPC I've only seen the SSL approach, is there a better practice 
for stuff like this?

SSL is just the poor-man's VPN for these types of things. Honestly, if SSL
had not already proved sufficient in a large number of cases, someone would
have spoken up saying &quot;Use XYZ...&quot;

The only token of opinion I can offer up beyond that is to build an IPSEC
tunnel between a couple of W2K boxes. Seems to me that all that does is use
OS-native functionality to build a VPN instead of a hardware-based secure
tunnel.
