I am trying to get the "maxsize" attribute to work in the input tag, but am having problems. IE 6 appears to ignore it.

For example in,

<input type="text" name="phone" size="15" maxsize="15">

the text box allows input of 16 or more characters.  Has anyone else noticed this behavior?  Is there a way to work around it?

you are confusing the two attributes "size" (which determines the size of 
the input box in pixels) and "maxlength" (which determines the number of 
characters allowed to be typed into the box).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] so-called triple md5
Message-ID: <3F5420BB.6020802@chxo.com>

I picked up the simple encryption scheme below a couple years ago from a 
comment in the PHP manual. I'm a little curious about its origins -- 
I've seen it referred to as "triple md5", but Google doesn't have much 
to say about that, and I suspect it was a euphemism. The original 
comment has since been deleted.

Does anyone recognize this, or care to comment on its ability to 
withstand anything more than casual snooping? It has the advantage of 
being available in setups without mcrypt support, but a false sense of 
security is worse than none at all.

And by the way, what method do -you- recommend for encrypting data that 
needs to be decrypted later?

Message-ID: <NFBBJNKBNKCIKGKJIFPJIEPLGJAA.sklar@sklar.com>

Don't use this algorithm. It "encrypts" things by just XORing plaintext with
the MD5 hash of a key. This has many problems, including the fact that since
the output of md5() is a string that contains only the characters [a-e0-9],
there's only 16 possible values that each piece of ciphertext needs to be
xor'ed with to produce plaintext.

If you need to encrypt data that needs to be decrypted later, use an
algorithm designed by a known, qualified cryptosystem designer and (more
importantly) that has stood up to lots of testing and attempts to break it.
For example, Blowfish (http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish.html), which is
available in the mcrypt extension. There are also versions available in
other languages (http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish-download.html) and you
could probably write a (slow) native PHP implementation.

Are you sure you're actually sending them?  Could someone else be
spoofing your address?

This virus sounds like the SOBIG virus. I believe that when it infects your
computer, it starts sending out bogus emails with "pif" attachments to
people in your address book.

well on a simplier note, i perfer the sha1() encyption type. it's like the
md5 but produces a longer string of [A-z0-9] characters making it harder
to *guess*. really if you that concerned about security then you need to
discuss this with your sysadmin. they may need to set up software that
stops people from using programs that hit your server repeatedly with
*guessing* requests.

Aaron,

I've got some simple scripts for this sort of thing online:

http://dev.krook.org/src.php?i=7&t=asp

Make sure that you have CDONTS enabled on the server to send mail.  If you 
want to do redirects, VBScript provides this functionality in 
Response.Redirect("http://example.com/")

Thanks all, those are great leads.  Unfortunately the ISP is pretty 
dated with Win NT and IIS 4.0.  I tried one solution using CDONTS and 
came up with errors that I believe are indicating that it is not 
enabled.  Ugh, I will never take a project like this again.

Thanks David--

I guess if something is worth hiding, it's worth hiding well.

I'm a little surprised that no one has written the native PHP 
implementation of Blowfish, slow though it may be. I noticed that there 
are PEAR classes that implement RC4 and TEA.

I'm having trouble finding any sort of online resource that compares 
encryption algorithms. Short of reading "Applied Cryptography," are 
there any good overviews out there that might help someone say, "Oh, TEA 
is good enough for what I'm doing," or "Gee, I guess I need to recompile 
with mcrypt support so I can use Blowfish?"

If you're at the point where the difference between TEA and Blowfish is
important to your application, then you should read Applied Cryptography.

What are you encrypting? For the differences between algorithms to really
matter, you should be analyzing how much ciphertext you're generating, who's
likely to snoop it, what kind of resources they have, etc.

For most web-based services, the likelihood of a bruteforce attack (or
slightly-less-than-brute-force based on a weakness of a cryptosystem) is so,
so, so much less than the likelihood of an attack because someone was
careless and left a key in an accesssible place or chose an easily guessable
key. A 56 bit key and a 1024 bit key are equally weak when they're written
on a post-it stuck to a monitor.

I'm encrypting smallish strings, probably not subject to attack but 
protected just in case.

1) I want passwords to be encrypted for storage, but decryptable so that 
they can be looked-up by an admin (over SSL) or (gasp!) sent to a user 
via email if the user has agreed in advance that this is a completely 
insecure thing to do.

2) I want to create an encrypted session cookie that includes the 
session id and a shared secret that changes with every request.

3) I'd also like to encrypt identity data like addresses and telephone 
numbers.

This may at some point be used to protect access to quasi-financial data 
(credits in a game economy), but never credit card or social security 
numbers. I know that all of this is dependent on the encryption key 
remaining secret, but in a shared-database environment this seems like 
the right thing to do.

If you are not providing any automated processes that do decryption, then
you don't need to store the key anywhere (but in the head of the admin).
This is good (and TEA or Blowfish or whatever will probably just fine for
your encryption).

What do you mean by "shared-database"? Are there users out of your control
who have read access to the tables in which this data is stored? Or are you
dependent upon a third party's correct administration of database access
privileges to ensure that other people can't look at the relevant database
tables. If you are storing the key anywhere, then the encrypted data is only
as secure as wherever the key is (as you noted below). So if you are storing
the key in a file whose proper security depends on a third-party
administrator, you may not be better off than just storing the data under a
permissions regime that also depends on such an administrator.

At some point, the data is valuable enough to put it on a dedicated server,
so that unauthorized access requires either a nasty hole in your application
that exposes it or physical access to the machine.

Then you have to start thinking about unauthorized physical access. There
are lots of ways to make yourself comfortable in this regard, but part of me
keeps thinking that being on the overnight janitorial shift at a large
company or hosting provider would be a very lucrative job -- a USB DVD
writer and a few minutes access to a machine would provide access to lots
and lots of data that would be very valuable.

Thank you all who replied to my query.  I found the solution in "Mime Mail"
in PEAR.  It works great!  However, before finally getting AOL to behave, I
found out that it is extra sensitive to the Bcc: field.

Thanks again!

Little does she know that the -real- data is on the system that is hidden inside the Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox in the
bottom of my ex-girlfriend's closet. I just run the server farm here at work as a honeypot.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Help with evaluating a string into an actual PHP line
Message-ID: <0e4901c371ef$78e96530$67a76244@philofsoa>

The following lines are in a TCL script I wrote:

#$xmlTclAssocArray = ('email.xml' => 'emailalert', 'feedback.xml' => 'feedback', 'pollresults.xml' => 'poll', 'profileMember.xml' => 'profile', 'triviaresults.xml' => 'trivia');
# THE PRECEDING LINE IS A COMMENTED-OUT PHP LINE TO BE USED BY alert_view_redirect.php


Only the first line needs to be read by a PHP script, doing an fgets to obtain it, chopping off the "#" from it by doing
a substr($arraySyntax, 1, strlen($arraySyntax) - 1) on it.  

But the trick is that I have to evaluate that line into an actual PHP command as this line is dynamically generated by TCL and not PHP.  How then do I convert this string into an actual existing PHP line that will create an array called $xmlTclAssocArray?

Thanx
Phil

I need to store data into XML that, often enough, is not in English.  How have you guys dealt with characters not found in the English language like ? or ? or ??  I have to store them as "&#229;" in my XML file, however, whenever I am doing evaluation somehow the "&#229;" gets converted literally to "?" and when that displays in HTML it chokes, puts garbage BACK into the XML file and it deteriorates further.

How can I ensure that when going back and forth between HTML, PHP and XML that "&#229;" REMAINS "&#229;" AS IS???

-------------------------
function swap(&$var_1, &$var_2)
{
   $temp = $var_1;
   $var_1 = $var_2;
   $var_2 = $temp;
}

$var_1 = 'I am var 1';
[etc]
-----------------------------

doesn't this need global $var_1,$var_2; in the swap function?

It is just a display problem. Characters are still the same, you
may need a configure your browser or your system to display
multiple languages!

No.  Normally variables passed to functions are just copies used in the function scope.  When something is passed by reference (&$var), you are telling the function where to find the original variable.  When a function uses a variable reference it can make changes to that variable outside of its own scope.

This is always a confusing topic, and I'd just like to point a couple things out; hopefully without confusing it more.

Actually, variables are always passed by reference, although they are "weak".  This means that as long as a argument isn't written to or changed in any way, inside the function, the variable's contents aren't copied.  Only when the argument is written to, are the contents copied, ie copy-on-write.  This doesn't apply, however to objects, IIRC.

I don't really understand, but maybe you can use &amp; for the ampersands?

I had a similar problem parsing ampersands in XML and converting the page to 
XHTML via PHP.  To end up with compliant XHTML entities, I had to double 
encode ampersands in the XML like so:

<subcategory>Content Management, Versioning &#38;#38; 
Delivery:</subcategory>

If the sample above gets processed in your mail client, that's
"ampersand - pound - 3 - 8 - pound - 3 - 8"

You can also surround the encoded element content with <![CDATA[ ]]>
markers, like this:

<subcategory><![CDATA[Content Management, Versioning &#38;

Actually I do my best coding at 4am!

I figured it all out with htmlspecialchars() function.  It stores it as "?"
or "?" or whatever but can also allow for HTML to safely display it.

That's a great option for PHP to parse for XML, but unfortunately PHP is not
the only language accessing the XML file - there is also a backend TCL
script that also reads it; TCL not having any native XML processing syntax
it would choke on <![CDATA]>

After a series of discussions among Hans, Jeff Siegel, and Mike Southwell,
we are beginning a Fundamentals thread on the Talk list.  The purpose of
the thread is to provide a way for the highly experienced among you to help
out those who are less experienced by offering your insights into best
practices.  The format will be as follows:
         a) We will pose a problem or issue (sometimes with a possible 
solution or two).
         b) The subject line of the posting will be "Fundamentals: <Name of 
problem>".
         c) After some discussion on the list, the whole thread will be 
collected and
turned into a brief article that will then be posted on the website.

Your participation will help to make this a success.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Force File Download HTTP Headers and IE Issue
Message-ID: <001e01c37258$f7c72d60$68e4a144@bronco>

My question:
Anyone got a working runaround suggestion to force file downloads on IE?

My issue(s):
I am using PHP to write HTTP headers to force pdf file download to user
roughly as follows:

blah, authenticate user, blah, select $file, blah... then push with...

header ("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: Binary");
header("Content-Length: $iFileSize");
header ("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$iFileName");
readfile("$file");

Netscape conforms and opens the Save As... dialog as expected. IE6 messes up
the content-disposition header and opens the download inline in the browser
without prompting user to Save As...

Seems regardless, of content-type header specified:
application/octet-stream
application/force-download
application/pdf

IE will mess it up. This is a known issue. Best run around I've seen so far
is to .Zip the files, in which case IE offers the Save As... on the
download. Don't want to zip em. 

Thoughts?

Warmest regards,

I may be wrong, but I think the only reason you're seeing the save 
as... dialog in Netscape is because the Adobe Acrobat web browser 
plugin doesn't run in Netscape anymore.  AFAIK (and according to the 
system requirements), Acrobat seems to be implemented in ActiveX now, 
which will only work (on Windows) in IE.

http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrrsystemreqs.html#60win

So what I'm saying is that your script isn't what's controlling this; 
if the plugin was functioning in Netscape, NS would display it 
inline, too.

To illustrate this, forget about PDF for a second, and pretend it's a 
JPEG.  Try forcing a download of a JPEG.  I don't believe you can do 
it, because the client-side browser controls how it will handle JPEGs 
(i.e., whether it will display inline or send to another viewer).

Of course, as I said, I may be wrong.  :)

I think this has been addressed in the archives already..
but maybe not specific to PDF

this works for me. Still prompts to save, but fills in the filename.
Does it work for you?


header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"$filename\"");
$fd=fopen("$filePath","r");
fpassthru($fd);

Get rid of Content-Transfer-Encoding. There is no such header. It shouldn't
affect the outcome, but it's best to simplify the problem with as few errors as
possible. :-)

The filename should be quoted.

See if that makes a difference, and let us know.

It's worth pointing out, I suppose, that to some systems (i.e., 
classic Mac OS), once you tell the browser that a JPEG (or PDF in 
your case) is "application/octet-stream", it is no longer a JPEG (or 
PDF).

If this is a controlled Windows environment which relies on simple 
file extensions to identify files, you're probably fine, but if you 
don't know the types of clients that might connect, you run a risk of 
creating problems where people might double-click on the resulting 
downloaded file and nothing happenes, because the OS no longer 
recognizes it as a JPEG.

oh yeah.. stupid Mac resource forks...

good point 

I don't have enough experience with them, but I would guess that there
is a way to append/pre-pend a resource fork to the file.
does anyone know about this?

or you could read the file's info or do the filename extension mapping
yourself in the script and set the content-type accordingly.

hmm...

IE 6.0.2 on *blush* Win98 uses the specified filename.

  Additional notes to my workaround on Q266305:

  I have tested my findings with PDF, XLS, DOC and ZIP. However JPG and 
GIF didn't make IE pop up the download box.? By changing content type 
from "octet-stream" to "force-download" (or some undefined type), it 
will work. Of course, we need to take care of other browsers too. Here 
is the improved code, hope it helps:

  header("Content-type: application/force-download");

  if (strstr($_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"], "MSIE"))
  ? header("Content-Disposition: filename=$myfile" . "%20"); // For IE
  else
  ? header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$myfile"); ? ? // 
For Other browsers

  Note: If you are using session together with this download, you will 
need to add the following line BEFORE the code above to make IE work:

  session_cache_limiter("");



======


It (or some other voodoo) got my thing working.... good luck.

Of course, while you're there you'll also find an endless discussion of 
."%20", other IE 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and Opera on my Highly Customized 
Toilet discussions....

Can you explain that? I don't understand how it could matter after the resource
has been downloaded and saved to the filesystem. Typically, the content type
described in the HTTP response is used by the HTTP client only.

I'm certainly not arguing, but I'd like that explained further if you are
certain it is true.

I had this problem quite a few months ago. I don't remember what exactly
causes the problem, but I remember the solution was that I was forced to
write the file to disk, and then open it back up and shoot it out.

A similar problem occurs with mod_rewrite and IE6 from a bug thats been
in IE6 for > 2 years. They are pretty lazy when it comes to fixing stuff
like this.

Anyway, try writing the file to disk first and see if that helps.

Well, the whole file metadata thing is a huge can of worms.

So, before I say anything to explain, I'll say:  (1) This probably is 
only a problem in this instance with Classic Mac OS (meaning, prior 
to X).  Therefore, your amount of caring might be minimal.  I say, 
test it on every single browser you care about supporting, and if it 
works, then you've made your choice.

Anyway, the explanation is lengthy, and it's a hot debate in the Mac 
community right now, because Apple is (in a lot of people's minds) 
moving backwards by adopting the Windows/Unix file extension setup, 
instead of creating a more sophisticated file metadata architecture 
in the OS.

The way files are organized in Mac OS is that they have a data fork 
and a resource fork.  Unix and Windows systems don't have this, so 
generally when files from a Mac are put on a Web site, the resource 
fork is stripped.  (Mac OS X, by the way, can utilize the resource 
fork if present, and then has a backup mapping from the extension. 
This is a bit of an oversimplification, but it is pretty much 
accurate.)

Anyway, as Brian said earlier, "stupid Mac resource forks".  And, in 
this case, it sucks for the programmer, because it makes life more 
difficult if you choose to care about it.

Then again, it could be argued that calling a PDF an "octet-stream" 
just to get around file download limitations of the browser maybe 
isn't the best solution from the standpoint of interoperability and 
just "the way things ought to be done", so that everything is certain 
to work on future (as yet undesigned) systems, and so forth.

IMHO opinion, MIME types are there for a reason, and for the good of 
standards and interoperability, people should be sending out the 
proper MIME types with the file, instead of trying to fool the 
browser into doing something else.

So, if I was doing this project, my choice would probably be to ZIP 
the file, especially since ZIP files seem to be so pervasive these 
days that they are auto-extracted anyway. But, to each his/her own, 
and I am not meaning to be critical, or anything.

So, anyway, what most Mac browsers seemed to be doing (under OS 9 and 
earlier) is this:  If they received an octet stream (or a generic 
data stream), if they could determine the file type, they appeared to 
add a resource fork onto the file (sometimes) which allowed the OS to 
map the file properly.

However, many times, the file would just be downloaded and end up 
with the blank page icon which, when clicked, wouldn't open.  (I've 
specifically seen this problem with PDF files, by the way.)

Now, to get religious for a bit:

The main advantage of the resource fork becomes clear when you use a 
Mac on a daily basis.  The thing is, in Windows, if you double-click 
a JPG...any JPG...it opens with the program that's the default for 
opening JPEGs.  Obviously, this is silly, because you might want to 
have one JPEG associated with Photoshop and another associated with 
Preview, or whatever.  That's what the resource fork allows the OS to 
do:  separate the type of file from the creator of the file.

It also frees the user from stupidly having to have a file extension 
on every file.  So, you can just call your file "Letter to Bob 
Jones", rather than "Letter to Bob Jones.doc".  Just easier from a 
user's standpoint.

There was a lengthy article on ArsTechnica about this a while ago.

I have my own opinions on file metadata which I won't go into now.  ;)

Cheers,

Marc

This will be a great addition to the mailing list, and PHP resources in general.  I hope everyone will be eager to weigh in and voice their techniques for the various topics.  There truly are no wrong answers, and with everyone's techniques and opinions will come a valuable lesson.  As the topics are posted on this list, I'll be maintaining a current news event on the nyphp.org front-page so that people can stay abreast of the current discussion topics.

A big thank you to you both for working on this over the last month,

Excellent explanation, Marc!

It's true that the mime-type should always be an accurate description of 
the file, but application/octet-stream is accurate, if overly general. 
Perhaps what was missing from Macintosh's Classic metadata handling was 
a way for the user to easily change the filetype, by adding a .pdf to 
the filename, for example? (it's been a long time...)

The reson for the behavior, while not explained, is set forth in RFC 
2616, the HTTP 1.1 specification:

   "If this header [Content-disposition: attachment] is used in a response 
   with the application/octet-stream content-type, the implied suggestion 
   is that the user agent should not display the response, but directly 
   enter a `save response as...' dialog."

Otherwise, the browser is only supposed to use the Content-disposition 
header for discovering the file name in case the user wants to save the 
file after viewing it.

If you're really curious, that's on about page 170 of 
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt  (thank you, Mozilla, for 
type-ahead find!)

What you are doing is passing a reference to $var_1 and $var_2. In this way,
you can change the values of these variables outside the scope of the
function.

FUNDAMENTALS #1: Site Structure:  Where to Locate Includes?

Index.php is always located in a website's document root, /var/www/html/
on 
a Linux box.
Where should includes be located?

Here are some possibilities:
* in the same directory, /var/www/html/
* in a subdirectory of document root, /var/www/html/includes/
* in a parallel directory to document root, /var/www/includes

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each possibility?
IN THE SAME DIRECTORY
* simple
* but confusing and cluttered if there are more than just a few
IN A SUBDIRECTORY
* provides a logical place for them
* but exposes them to browsers
IN A PARALLEL DIRECTORY
* provides a logical place for them
* doesn't expose them to browsers
* but perhaps write privileges are not available (or needed?)

What does exposure matter?
If the include file contains html, it will be visible in the calling
file's 
source code.
If it contains php code (like a database connection), it will never be 
visible anyway.

Are there important principles here, or is location just a matter of 
preference?

The parallel directory to document root, /var/www/includes, is my vote. No
matter what happens, the .inc files are not available to anyone other than
those who have ftp access.

Once you have decided that your .inc files are outside the public area, it
is an easy matter to consistently format your require statements that are
within your .php code.

Locating .inc files in a parallell directory to the document root reduces
one less factor (ie, noone but u can get to them) that causes headaches
later. Why think about the possibility of a prob when u can discount it
completely?

seth j hersh

My choice has always been in a subdirectory of root.  To satisfy security
requirements I use the .php extension so even though the files are exposed
to the browser, they are still run on the server when directly queried.

The subdir provides a clean organization and an easy deployment with tools
like DreamWeaver.

preg_match() always returns the text that matched the entire pattern as the
first element of the $match array. So the only way to have a match array
that contains just the numbers that match your current parenthesized
subpattern is to have an entire pattern that matches just those numbers from
the string. Which I don't think you can do.

Why do you want to do this?

> FUNDAMENTALS #1: Site Structure:  Where to Locate Includes?

I set things up like this:

Document root: /www/www.sitename.com/docroot
Includes:      /www/www.sitename.com/support

Individual pathnames and directory names, of course, don't really matter,
but it's important to locate includes outside of the document root. You can
configure your web server to not server include files based on extension or
parse include files as PHP based on extension, but then you're in trouble if
you ever have an include file with a different extension (on purpose, by
accident, because you edited one in-place with emacs and ended up with
foo.inc~, etc.)

Putting includes outside of the document root also lets you put other things
in that include directory: PHP scripts that run not as a response to
requests (cron jobs, other maintenance scripts, etc), other programs, data
files that aren't PHP, etc.

Dividing things like this makes it easier to group files into CVS modules
that are used for different purposes. For example, let's say things are
organized like this:

Document root: /www/www.sitename.com/docroot
Includes for database access: /www/www.sitename.com/support/db
Includes for site layout and formatting:
/www/www.sitename.com/support/layout
Scripts run by cron: /www/www.sitename.com/support/cron
Textfiles containing data feeds: /www/www.sitename.com/support/feeds

Each of these directories can be a separate CVS module. If you have a
machine that just needs to run cron scripts (which themselves need database
access), you can just check out (or export) the support/db and support/cron
modules on that machine instead of all the code. Other combinations can be
similarly modular. If everything is piled under the document root, you don't
have that kind of flexibility.

That's a good question  :)  I guess I just want to be sure that the second element of the array will always be what I need.  I came across this in the PHP manual (

An assertion subpattern is matched in the normal way, except
     that  it  does not cause the current matching position to be
     changed. Lookahead assertions start with  (?=  for  positive
     assertions and (?! for negative assertions. For example,

       \w+(?=;)

     matches a word followed by a semicolon, but does not include
     the semicolon in the match, and

That's a good question  :)  I guess I just want to be sure that the second element of the array will always be what I need.  I came across this in the PHP manual (http://us3.php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.syntax.php):

"An assertion subpattern is matched in the normal way, except

\w+(?=;)

the semicolon in the match, and...."

Which basically does what I need, although maybe for the wrong reasons.  As long as I can be sure the second array is the matched pattern, I have no problem with it.  Although, I for large strings I could see this behavior as annoying; ie, having the first element a 10k string that's always ignored.

But even if you use an assertion, the assertion is still part of the entire
pattern that matches, so the stuff that matches the assertion will be part
of $match[0].

My vote is for a directory under the web root, since it gives better 
flexibility to deploy code from machine to machine with a minimum of hassle, 
kind of like packaging a Java web application in a nice tidy WAR file that 
doesn't care about an absolutely mapped OS path.

Granted you keep your classes and beans in a protected "/WEB-INF" directory 
under this web root, but your standard includes stay in the publicly 
accessible web root.

I'm also a fan of naming the includes directory "/inc".  That way you have a 
set of directories whose contents are somewhat self evident based on their 
file extensions or calling tag name, e.g., standard.css goes in "/css", 
functions.js goes in "/js", images of all sorts go in "/img".

Another upshot to this naming convention is that you never worry about 
whether you called it "/include" or "/includes" or "/image" or "/images".

I try to keep all the includes in a central location that is not under the
web root. The reason is that it's easy to use components across multiple
sites and everything is easy to locate. I typically use a file naming
convention for the include files within that central directory to identify
which ones are site specific or general purpose or whatever the case may be.

I don't really feel that exposure is much of an issue because I haven't
heard of any vulnerabilities where a user can stop the server from parsing
the PHP code. I have, however, seen exploits on unpatched NT servers that
allow you to read any file on the target's filesystem using simple DOS
commands. SO, I guess if you're up to date on all your patches, security
concerns shouldn't influence anyone's decision to place includes in location
A rather the B.

FUNDAMENTALS #1: Site Structure:  Where to Locate Includes?

Index.php is always located in a website's document root, /var/www/html/
on 
a Linux box.
Where should includes be located?

Here are some possibilities:
* in the same directory, /var/www/html/
* in a subdirectory of document root, /var/www/html/includes/
* in a parallel directory to document root, /var/www/includes

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each possibility?
IN THE SAME DIRECTORY
* simple
* but confusing and cluttered if there are more than just a few
IN A SUBDIRECTORY
* provides a logical place for them
* but exposes them to browsers
IN A PARALLEL DIRECTORY
* provides a logical place for them
* doesn't expose them to browsers
* but perhaps write privileges are not available (or needed?)

What does exposure matter?
If the include file contains html, it will be visible in the calling
file's 
source code.
If it contains php code (like a database connection), it will never be 
visible anyway.

Are there important principles here, or is location just a matter of 
preference?

Being "up to date on all your patches" is a theoretical goal state never
achieved in practice for any signficant length of time. Even if you think
you've installed all of the currently available and relevant patches for all
of the software running on your web server, your database server, your VPN

and new patches released.

Security concerns should definitely influence how you organize your site.
Running Apache and/or MySQL in a chroot jail, for example, is still a good

I'd be curious to see a poll on this topic now. It seems that the majority of
people who have responded to this question consider a security risk an
acceptable price to pay for a small convenience.

I guess the answers could break down into three categories:

1. I place my includes under document root for convenience, and I'm not aware
of any problems that could cause.
2. I understand the risk in doing so, but I still place my includes under
document root.
3. I place my includes outside of document root. It is a simple task, and it is
at least more secure than doing otherwise.

I am seeing a lot of people who fit into category 2. Does the convenience
really seem worth the risk? I'm honestly curious - not trying to be a smart
ass. :-)

True. I guess it's actually a moot point since we're talking about security
in general. Whether you place your files in one directory or another... if
someone gains significant access to the box, you're exposed. Then again,
someone gaining FTP access using brute force could download the PHP source
code if it's in a readable directory, and considering many hosts grant FTP
access to your webroot, it would be safer to place the files somewhere else.

I typically name my includes with .inc extensions and set Apache to
not serve those files directly. This is both relatively convenient and
relatively secure.

i find it kinda odd that the only advise suggested on the topic in Security
Focus's "Securing PHP" is to simply make the includes + classes w/ the same
mime-type as a php app:

http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1706

-snip-
AddModule mod_php4.c
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
AddType application/x-httpd-php .inc
AddType application/x-httpd-php .class


It is worth to note that besides "*.php", two extensions have been added as
PHP scripts: "*.inc" and "*.class". Programmers often include additional
files, with an extension like "*.inc", "*.class" or similar. Because by
default those extensions are treated as regular files, the requests to
download them will reveal the source code comprised in them. This can lead
to revealing passwords or other sensitive information.

If you use FTP, you're asking to be hacked anyway. Use SFTP, SCP, or
WebDAV over SSL (this last is my preference for ease of use). Demand
this of your service providers.

Personally, I find it depends on my environment:

   -- dedicated server, application not intended for distribution (ie, an intranet, private e-commerce site):  /usr/local/lib/php

   -- any application intended for distribution, or working in a shared public server: inline with the document root, or a subdirectory thereof, depending on the number of files.


I always name my includes with the extension of .inc

Protecting from browser exposure has a couple of options as well.

  -- if the app is open source anyway, what do I care?  To protect sensitive information, I create a drop-in application.php file.  It's a single file, aware of all the needed params, containing configuration options, DB connections, etc, and either in a protected directory or parsed by php anyway.  It contains *no* logic except to determine where includes are, possibly bring a DB connection online, or to create other menial aspects of the app's environment.

  -- if the app's source shouldn't be open to the public, it'll be on a dedicated server anyway  :)  Then, you can do it right; setup a nice hierarchy outside of the web root (/usr/local/lib/php) and use an auto included application file (ie, auto.logic.inc).  I also sometimes set environment variables in the apache .conf file, with additional helper paths and so forth.  This is particularly helpful if you have many sister projects on a single vhost (ie, /reports has it's own include dir, automatically determined by an environment variable set in a <Directory> directive in httpd.conf).

One fallacy I've seen in using the extension .php for included files, as to limit their visibility, is that while the browser may not see any output, that file is still being executed.  So, if you have more than just functions or classes, bits and pieces of the app are running, which may be *much* worse than someone getting the DB password or looking at your code in some form.

> preference?

I think it's most important to just be cognitive of where your files are, and of what types they are (executeable, or includeable).  I like .inc for included files, and .php for *real* php files (ie, those that are executed).

I would agree to setting Apache to not serve .inc files except that I want
to maintain a consistent standard from one application to another.  I don't
have access to config Apache on many applications because the app runs on a
shared box.  Then there's when running under <gasp> IIS.  If I standardize
on the .inc extension protected via the web server then I need to have
knowledge of how to do it in all the various environments I may work in.
Standardizing on putting incudes in a subdir of the app root & using the
.php extension to protect those include files from direct download allows me
to work in most any php environment, no need to have access to Apache, no
need to have access to ftp outside the webroot, no need for knowledge of the
web server either.

This also allows me to work the same in PHP as I do in ASP.  Same standard,
different language.

So I would also say that I fall into the 2nd category of I know the risks
but consider the convenience a worthwhile compromise.

Knock on wood, but in 8 years of web app development ( mostly in ASP and
JSP ) I have yet to have an application hacked.  That may be mostly luck,
but I'ld like to think its partly due to the standards I've adopted.

.htaccess can be set to not serve .inc files. Doesn't require getting 
into apache config.

Yes, but still relies on apache specifics which means when running in IIS I
would have to handle securing .inc differently.  includes with .php in it's
own directory needs no special handling by different web servers and if the
subdir is named inc or include the purpose of the .php file is still known.

So this looks like a wash... If you stop .inc files from being served raw
and exposing source code, you consequently cause them to execute as a "real"
.php file would. Placing .inc files in a locked down, parallel location
(without parsing them) sounds like the best solution to me (if you have that
option), but what are the downsides to executing included files? I guess it
depends on the code, but is there any significant performance degradation in
most instances? I'd make sure any third-party hosts are parsing .inc's
before placing them under webroot. That also makes the app less portable
since you can't be sure if you're moving to a server set up to parse inc's -
I mean it's portable, but you may be opening your app up to direct downloads
on a shared provider.

Another point in favor of .php extensions is that many editors have a PHP
template to make your code easier to read. I use Homesite and it does a
great job of highlighting the code if it's .php, but .inc is just plain old,
boring, hard to read text. Granted, you could config the editor to treat
.inc as .php, but why bother doing that if there is no other apparent
benefit to using .inc over .php?

.htaccess can be set to not serve .inc files. Doesn't require getting

  I'm using setcookie() that I want to set "permanently" (set it to like 100 years from now), but looking up both date() and mktime() honestly made no sense to me as to how to do it.

  So, um, how do I do it?

  Thanx

Note that many browsers won't deal well with an cookie whose expiration date
is after January 19, 2038 at 3:14:07 A.M. UTC (that's an epoch timestamp of
2147483647) since they store cookie expiration time in a 32 bit signed
integer. (The maximum positive value of a 32 bit signed int is 2147483647).

So, you may be better off with:

setcookie('myCookie',$val,2147483647);

That's a good point.

Also of note is that the cookie specification does not allow a cookie's
expiration date to be more than two years in the future, so a cookie should
never be allowed to persist for more than two years. I'm honestly not sure how
strictly this is implemented across the various browsers; maybe someone with
some free time can use David's code and test. :-)

Well, the whole file metadata thing is a huge can of worms.

So, before I say anything to explain, I'll say:  (1) This probably is 
only a problem in this instance with Classic Mac OS (meaning, prior 
to X).  Therefore, your amount of caring might be minimal.  I say, 
test it on every single browser you care about supporting, and if it 
works, then you've made your choice.

Anyway, the explanation is lengthy, and it's a hot debate in the Mac 
community right now, because Apple is (in a lot of people's minds) 
moving backwards by adopting the Windows/Unix file extension setup, 
instead of creating a more sophisticated file metadata architecture 
in the OS.

The way files are organized in Mac OS is that they have a data fork 
and a resource fork.  Unix and Windows systems don't have this, so 
generally when files from a Mac are put on a Web site, the resource 
fork is stripped.  (Mac OS X, by the way, can utilize the resource 
fork if present, and then has a backup mapping from the extension. 
This is a bit of an oversimplification, but it is pretty much 
accurate.)

Anyway, as Brian said earlier, "stupid Mac resource forks".  And, in 
this case, it sucks for the programmer, because it makes life more 
difficult if you choose to care about it.

Then again, it could be argued that calling a PDF an "octet-stream" 
just to get around file download limitations of the browser maybe 
isn't the best solution from the standpoint of interoperability and 
just "the way things ought to be done", so that everything is certain 
to work on future (as yet undesigned) systems, and so forth.

IMHO opinion, MIME types are there for a reason, and for the good of 
standards and interoperability, people should be sending out the 
proper MIME types with the file, instead of trying to fool the 
browser into doing something else.

So, if I was doing this project, my choice would probably be to ZIP 
the file, especially since ZIP files seem to be so pervasive these 
days that they are auto-extracted anyway. But, to each his/her own, 
and I am not meaning to be critical, or anything.

So, anyway, what most Mac browsers seemed to be doing (under OS 9 and 
earlier) is this:  If they received an octet stream (or a generic 
data stream), if they could determine the file type, they appeared to 
add a resource fork onto the file (sometimes) which allowed the OS to 
map the file properly.

However, many times, the file would just be downloaded and end up 
with the blank page icon which, when clicked, wouldn't open.  (I've 
specifically seen this problem with PDF files, by the way.)

Now, to get religious for a bit:

The main advantage of the resource fork becomes clear when you use a 
Mac on a daily basis.  The thing is, in Windows, if you double-click 
a JPG...any JPG...it opens with the program that's the default for 
opening JPEGs.  Obviously, this is silly, because you might want to 
have one JPEG associated with Photoshop and another associated with 
Preview, or whatever.  That's what the resource fork allows the OS to 
do:  separate the type of file from the creator of the file.

It also frees the user from stupidly having to have a file extension 
on every file.  So, you can just call your file "Letter to Bob 
Jones", rather than "Letter to Bob Jones.doc".  Just easier from a 
user's standpoint.

There was a lengthy article on ArsTechnica about this a while ago.

I have my own opinions on file metadata which I won't go into now.  ;)

Cheers,

Marc

COOKIE TO BE SET 
 
I have this cookie I have to set that will be session-based (cookie
deletes when browser session is closed, the classic).  However, the
cookie is set in /Main_page/registrering.php so the path for the
cookie is incorrect; I want the path to be '/'.  HOWEVER, PHP is
strict on syntax so that if I set a path, I have to set a time int
value at the same time.   
 
I want to set the path and NOT the time int.  How do I do that?

If you do not set an expiration time, it makes the cookie a session cookie, so
it persists in the browser session only and is not written to disk.

header("Set-Cookie: nordicnet_registration=$uplinenumber");

Hope that helps.

Thanx for the header() tip, however, I noticed that the path is not set and
it will have to be as the cookie is being set within
/Main_page/registrering.php which will set the path to "/Main_page" instead
of "/" which is what I want.  How do I notate that?

This should do it:

header("Set-Cookie: nordicnet_registration=$uplinenumber; path=/Main_page/");

Hope that helps.

Then the path is superfluous, and my original example was right. :-)

Aside from name and value, cookie attributes are restrictive. Having path set
to / is no more restrictive than not including the path attribute.

Hope that helps.

Phil,

>From the setcookie page:

the full signature (most of the parameters are optional ):
setcookie ( name , value , expire, path , domain , secure )

your call:
setcookie('nordicnet_registration', $uplinenumber, "", "/" );

Try that -- I'm guessing it will work.

hahaha! serves me right for not reading THE VERY NEXT LINE:
"The expire and secure arguments are integers and cannot be skipped with an
empty string. Use a zero (0) instead"

so try this:
setcookie('nordicnet_registration', $uplinenumber, 0, "/" );

14.30 Location 


The Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient to
a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the request or
identification of a new resource. For 201 (Created) responses, the
Location is that of the new resource which was created by the request.
For 3xx responses, the location SHOULD indicate the server's preferred
URI for automatic redirection to the resource. The field value consists
of a single absolute URI. 

       Location       = "Location" ":" absoluteURI



An example is: 

       Location: http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/People.html


      Note: The Content-Location header field (section 14.14) differs

      from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the original

      location of the entity enclosed in the request. It is therefore

      possible for a response to contain header fields for both Location

      and Content-Location. Also see section 13.10
<http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13.10>  for
cache

      requirements of some methods.

Hey Folks:

Quick response, since I'm busy...  Most of my operations are on shared
hosts and I do all of my development on my office machine.  Here's how I
configure.

There are two include directories.  One on the web server for unimportant
stuff.  One in the home directory.  PHP scripts that need access to the
secure files in the home directory are run in CGI mode.

Here's a quick listing of some sample files and their contents...

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

WEBSERVER
/htdocs/username/.htaccess
    DirectoryIndex index.php

    AddType application/x-httpd-php .inc

    <Files *htaccess>
    Deny from all
    </Files>

    <Files *inc>
    Deny from all
    </Files>

/htdocs/username/index.php
    include('./directory.inc');
    include("$IncludeDir/inc-user.inc");

/htdocs/username/directory.inc
    $IncludeDir = './include';

/htdocs/username/include/index.php
    <p>Go Away!</p>

/htdocs/username/include/<unimportant include files go here, such as...>
/htdocs/username/include/inc-user.inc
    #  This makes the deployment portable!
    switch ($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']) {
        case 'analysisandsolutions.localhost':
            $SafeIncludeDir = 'x:/blah/foo';

Message-ID: <002e01c37369$d84867d0$67a76244@philofsoa>

I have a folder that requires Windows Authentication each time it is access.  The remote system is Linux.  However, there is no sign of .htaccess nor .htpasswd as I understand a UNIX-based system to have to prompt for Windows Authentication, yet each time I am always prompted, even if I call the folder directly w/o calling a specific file in that folder (this all done via the browser).

Anyone there run into this and know what I should do about it?

It's been a long day, so please forgive me if it is too incoherent.

I prefer number 3, supporting files held outside the web directory.  If
this option is not available, and the supporting files are IN the web
directory I don't allow them to be accessed via a web browser.

This snippet of the logic I put in the beginning of each file I want
protected:

if($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] == basename(__FILE__)) {
    header('Location: http://whereverIwanttoSendTheBadGuy.com');
    exit();
}

This will allow it to be included but will not allow it to be accessed
by a browser.  You could use whatever code you wanted if it was accessed
directly vs. inclusion from a legit script (verbose logging, take away
their birthday, etc.).

I also don't believe in the .inc, .class extensions for supporting
files.  I don't recall the bias origin but it was an article I read four
years ago that convinced me.  One plus is that everything is .php so one
less dependency on specific configuration options(config file "cleaned
up" by an overzealous admin at 3AM).

I try to keep things portable and under one directory on systems I can
have access to a dir outside a web directory.  Which works well with
multiple developers using CVS(once you get used to using CVS that is ;)
) to have a production site and multiple development sites keep
completely isolated code bases.  So along the lines of:

Production
==========
/usr/local/www/projectname   <-- Main directory of this project
/usr/local/www/projectname/htdocs   <-- web directory
/usr/local/www/projectname/classes   <-- class definitions dir
/usr/local/www/projectname/etc        <-- config files, etc.
/usr/local/www/projectname/libs       <-- function definitions dir

Development Area One
====================
/usr/home/dev1/projectname   <-- Main directory of this project
/usr/home/dev1/projectname/htdocs   <-- web directory
/usr/home/dev1/projectname/classes   <-- class definitions dir
/usr/home/dev1/projectname/etc        <-- config files, etc.
/usr/home/dev1/projectname/libs       <-- function definitions dir

An auto-prepend file modifies the include path so the site code uses
require_once('libs/housekeeping.php').  It also sets up an
ini_set('unserialize_callback_func','require_class') that handles
pulling in object definitions if the session contains an unknown object
in the require_class() user function.  Which grants the site code the
ability to require_class('user') that pulls in the "user" class
definition like a require_once would (by first seeing if the
class_exists() else require_once() the object definition file).

Almost all of my projects have been created on servers that I had root
access on, or known the admin of the box.  So I definitely do get into
some of the apache/httpd.conf stuff to tweak PHP settings and virtual
hosts.

what's so kludgey about this, Phil?

I'm actually curious why you want it set soooo far into the future?

I usually only set it for 3 months on the long end.

It's highly unlikely that your site will still exist in its current form
in 100 years from now, let alone 2 or 3. Of course, you can always be
optimistic. :)

I don't know of any date limitations since I never look ahead that far
(cookies, life, coding, etc), so I would go by tbe guidance of others
regarding the 2038 date.

Thanks for responses to my question about the need for global $var within a 
function whose parameter is &$var (unnecessary; function is operating 
directly on the original because of the &).

Now this raises another question.  Given the above, in those cases where a 
function is intended to operate on a global variable--and only those cases, 
why wouldn't you *always* define the parameter with & instead of using a 
global statement?

Speaking personally, it depends on whether I think the parameter is closely
related to the function and how much data is already required to be passed in.
Imagine if you need to declare 50 global variables (hypothetically speaking).
If you had to pass these all in the function call, you would probably avoid
calling that function whenever possible. :-)

Message-ID: <024DB13B-DFB3-11D7-BA7A-000393B9FB36@mac.com>

I recently had to move one of my php sites from one server to another 
and learned (once again) that not all php servers are the same (give me 
a break, I've had a hangover for about three days now (or is it 
four?)). One of the things that most attracted me to php after working 
with asp for so long was its lenience towards doing things on-the-fly 
without a lot of set up and declarations, etc. So I had some old code 
that worked on my 1st server:

	if ($_REQUEST['from']) {
		$from['rgb'] = $_REQUEST['from'];
	} else {
		$from['rgb'] = '000000';
	}
	if ($_REQUEST['to']) {
		$to['rgb'] = $_REQUEST['to'];
	} else {
		$to['rgb'] = 'FFFFFF';
	}
	
	echo "to: $to<BR>";
	echo "to[rgb]: {$to['rgb']}<BR>";
	
	echo "from: $from<BR>";
	echo "from[rgb]: {$from['rgb']}<BR>";

Which produced the output:
	to: Array
	to[rgb]: FFFFFF
	from: Array
	from[rgb]: 000000

When I moved the code to a new server, the results were:
	to: FFFFFF
	to[rgb]: F
	from: 4563456
	from[rgb]: 4

Of course, none of this was immediately obvious, since the code was 
inside a php script that generated a png and had no echo statements. Of 
course I should've originally said

	$from = array( 'rgb' => '000000');

But I'm lazy.

I am a little curious about what setting in php.ini allows this 
behavior on my (development) server though, since I suppose I should 
turn it off so it matches with the outside world.

I agree-- if you have a function that updates a number of global objects 
or variables, you don't want to force yourself to list them all as 
arguments every time you call the function.

As a further note, I always use global statements in order to make 
objects available to the local scope, but for looking at or updating 
regular variables I tend to use the $GLOBALS array so that the local 
namespace doesn't get to crowded.

did this
$from = array( 'rgb' => '000000');
fix it for you?

which version of PHP on the old/new servers?

I would have to guess that since you didn't initialize $to and $from as
arrays, they didn't get echo'ed as such.

that's at least for the typing issue. I'm not sure why the other results
came up the way they did, even without declaring the arrays.

A good reason to always initialize arrays before populating them.
either.
If you were going to be adding more entries to the same array, I would use
$foo = array()
and array_push()
rather than using $foo = array('key' => 'value')
each time
Wouldn't the latter re-initialize the array and wipe out old values?

If that's an "outside world" setup, I think I'm happy to stay in my own 
little self-contained niche where I can declare an array implicitly.
As far as I can tell, your original code would work on my servers.

Waitaminit!

What if the version of PHP on the new server didn't support $_REQUEST? 
And had register_globals turned on?
I think you might get those results, then, eh?

Events will always conspire to ensure that you will eventually come to 
regret not maintaining portability. Machines get fried, ISP's go out of 
business, somebody somewhere spills a drink and BAM! you've got to do 
the little dance.

Message-ID: <026d01c373ca$6a4c7710$67a76244@philofsoa>

I have never in my life ever seen this happen, but I am doing a typical mySQL insert statement:

insert into nnet_usermetadata (
 ...
) values (
....
)

if (!mysql_query(sql)) { // DO STUFF}

the ID column field, nnet_userid, is an int auto-increment.

This is where I have never in my career seen this happen before.  The INSERT statement, upon execution, literally writes on top of another existing row, so instead of 5 or 6 rows I have only 1 row, same ID, values changed!

The way it works is that once a new user is pre-registered, their information is stored in the db, a cookie is set with their userID (the infamous permanent cookie) and then they're shown a screen w/ link to click to go to the next page.  They can then click onto the "Registrer" link and edit their pre-registration information based upon the cookie stored in their machine and submit.  Once submitted this time it updates their information instead of inserts.

I've checked my code and writing on top of an existing row should NOT happen unless a cookie is set on their machine with their userid.  In short, if I pre-register for the first time I should have a cookie with userid of 1.  If Sven pre-registers for the first time on HIS machine he should have a cookie with userid of 2.  and so on.  

So, uh, HELP!

And you got this by echoing your $sql variable or something from your script,
right? If not, that is something to try, just to make sure the query is exactly
what you think it is.

You can also not execute the query through PHP and just echo it instead. From
the MySQL interactive prompt, try to see if you can reproduce the problem by
entering the query yourself (copy/paste):

mysql> select foo from bar;
+-----+
| foo |
+-----+
|blah |
+-----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> insert into bar...
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> select foo from bar;
+-----+
| foo |
+-----+
|blah |
+-----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

> And here is the SQL that created the table in the first place

Can you show us the output of "desc nnet_usermetadata" as well? I think that
would be helpful.

I can't explain the behavior you described (yet).

A good function to use to obtain a future date is strtotime('+1 week 2
days 4 hours 2 seconds').  I have found it to be very useful and
extremely easy to use.

aha, you mean like this?

No need to do that, the $GLOBALS array is always available in the local 
scope.
Here's an example:

// global variables -- these aren't going to change for this request
$goatcolor= "red";
$goatname= "Quux";

$barn= new Barn;
$barn->color= "green";

function findGoat($goatname) {
    // make the current $barn object available locally
    global $barn;

    if ( $barn->color== $GLOBALS['goatcolor'] ) {
        print "$goatname is in this barn.";
        $barn->empty= 0;
    }
    else {
        print "$goatname is not in the $barn->color barn.";
        $barn->empty= 1;
    }
}

I could make a better example. :-)

By referencing $goatcolor as $GLOBALS['goatcolor'], I'm much less likely 
to change it by accident. And possibly the script is more readable, at 
least to me.

Oh, I had assumed that you knew how to find it, deleted it and were
still having an issue.

Just in case there are still others that don't know, the command:
ls -al

will show the hidden files (that start with a period "."), too

This is on LInux? All you had to do was a 'ls -la' to see all of the files 
in the directory including those that start with a '.'

great responses from all so far.

I have to admit, that most of the time, I use a subdirectory, but a
parallel directory does make sense from a security standpoint.


Using .inc is just way too confusing for me, so mine all get .php
.inc doesn't tell me what language I'm dealing with, nor does it give
good syntax coloring, at least not automatically.


Regarding portability, at the beginning of every file I put
require_once($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/LIB.php");

where LIB.php sets some variables for me, like the location of includes,
images, functions, webroot/domainname, classes, etc. as $INCLUDES,
$FUNCTIONS, $IMAGES, $WEBROOT, etc

I then use these everytime I call on an include or require a function
require("$FUNCTIONS/nameOfFunction.php");

This way I can move from machine to machine and put those dirs whereever
I want or am able. This really helps when you only have access to the
www directory and can't use a parallel directory.


Looking forward to reading the final review/synopsis on this first column.

Message-ID: <002401c373f4$60229740$8d2c0242@peter1>

Hi,
I am using the mail function on a page, and I noticed that the page tends to hang for a while when it loads, no doubt do to having to send an email. Is there a way to send the email in a separate process. Would placing the ampersand in the sendmail path in PHP.ini file work?

Right now, on the server, the path is:

/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i 

Would it help to change the path to:

/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i &

Also, could this be done through the ini_set() function instead of editing the actual PHP.ini file?

it looks like the sendmail path can only be changed in php.ini or httpd.conf.

IIRC in Perl
/usr/sbin/sendmail -q
will queue the message.  It may make a difference -- I may also be blowin 
smoke.

You install it using pear. See http://pear.php.net. PEAR files usually
go in /usr/local/lib/php, but the PEAR Package Manager should take
care of this for you. BTW, you may need to edit your php.ini file to
add the new location to your include_path.

      Phil,

      From the setcookie page:

      You may also replace any argument with an empty string ("") in order to skip that argument.  

      the full signature (most of the parameters are optional ):
      setcookie ( name , value , expire, path , domain , secure )

      your call:
      setcookie('nordicnet_registration', $uplinenumber, "", "/" ); 

      Try that -- I'm guessing it will work.

        That does not work either, it sets the cookie onto disk and instantly deletes it.

          setcookie('nordicnet_registration', $uplinenumber); // SESSION COOKIE TO BE SET 

          I have this cookie I have to set that will be session-based (cookie deletes when browser session is closed, the classic). However, the cookie is set in /Main_page/registrering.php so the path for the cookie is incorrect; I want the path to be '/'. HOWEVER, PHP is strict on syntax so that if I set a path, I have to set a time int value at the same time. 

          I want to set the path and NOT the time int. How do I do that?

Ok i ahve been developing PHP web application for a couple fo years now but they have always been on a volunteer or personal basis.  Now I have a client that wants a custom web application and I am not sure how much to charge them.  So of the features that this web application included are:

Contact Management 
Personal Appointment book as well as global appointment book
Resume management
meeting management
admin features(Such as adding new users)
Sending out template based email to well over 100 individuals
dynamic word document creation
and many other features...

This system is replacing other application such as Goldmine, resume grabber, and will also eliminate many steps such as sending emails in outlook.

if anyone has an idea on how much something like this goes for please let me know.

The C in Set-Cookie is uppercase, the path is not quoted, and there should not
be a newline.

header('Set-Cookie: var=value; path=/');

Are you trying to set a session cookie (a cookie that exists only in the
browser session) or trying to use PHP sessions? Now I'm confused. :-)

Confusing to me is wondering if a file named "a.php" is a script which is
going to be viewed/executed or is just a bunch of included functions.

And if your files are not in the document root and the tree structure 
differs between the development machine and the server?

I think David would have the best advice for this type of thing, but there is
one perspective you seem to be overlooking. Instead of trying to quantity the
cost based on the perceived value of the software, maybe you can quantify the
cost based on the amount of time you estimate will be involved combined with
how valuable you believe your time to be.

I think you are the best person to give such an estimate.

I see your point, but it would be in the includes dir so that's how I
would know.

only the LIB.php needs to go in the document_root.
Then it can set the $INCLUDES, $FUNCTIONS, etc vars to
$INCLUDES = "/path/to/includes/dir";

I try to at least use sym links so that my servers have similar trees.
Ideally, the machines are twins, but in the event that they are not (dev
machine is a workstation?) you could just maintain 2 separate LIB.php
files with different paths.

dev
$INCLUDES = "/dev/path/to/includes";

production
$INCLUDES = "/prod/path/to/includes";

The files which call LIB.php can be anywhere under the www root as
$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] won't change. Document_root is always the www
root.

I think I saw a class for this on phpclasses.org.

Heck, I bet if you just put a doc extension on it and send the file download
headers, Word would probably open it anyway.

What you guys doing in front of a computer now anyway - it's Friday night!

thanks, I'll take a look.

That might work, but wait, who uses Word anymore anyways?
I bet it's much easier to dynamically create and OpenOffice document. :)

Where else would one be on a Friday nite? If you reply this evening,
I'll know the answer. :P

And if the server you're trying to move to is a shared server on which you
don't have control over the document root?  Or, on your development
server, you develop lots of clients websites, so make subdirectories off 
of the main document root to do the designs in?  Or...

That's why I use one file in each directory which contains a relative 
path pointing back to the general includes dir.

Message-ID: <20030906003839.460E8A8729@virtu.nyphp.org>

Phil,

Please be patient with me while I ask a silly question: 
Exactly how are you evaluating the success/failure of your cookie
code?

I ask because earlier in this thread you said:

>> That does not work either, it sets the cookie 
>> onto disk and instantly deletes it. 

are you using the existence of the cookie file in the OS to decide
if the cookie was set? I don't know one way or the other whether
that's a good indicator, and there's certainly better ways to
check.

My first check would of course be to redirect to a second script
that looks in the $_COOKIE (or $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS) array.
Unfortunately there's the faint possibility that the browser you're
using has been (unbeknownst to you) configured to silently discard
the cookies. Therefore I tend to look directly at the raw data
that's received by the browser from the cookie setting script.

If I execute the following one-liner:

  <?php setcookie("cname", "cdata", time()+3600, "/"); ?>

I get back the following header line in the reply:

  Set-Cookie: cname=cdata; expires=Sat, 06-Sep-03 01:30:36 GMT;
path=/

which is what I wanted; a non-session cookie that expires in an
hour.

If I execute this one-liner:

  <?php setcookie("cname", "cdata", 0, "/"); ?>

I get back the following header line in the reply:

  Set-Cookie: cname=cdata; path=/

which is, as far as I know, since it has NO expiration date, a true
session cookie.

If you haven't done so yet, I would strongly suggest you use telnet
or some other low level tool to examine the exact headers you're
getting back from the script.

Of course you may have gone through all of this already, in which
case sorry for wasting your time.

Good luck.

Pat Hunt

setcookie('nordicnet_registration', $uplinenumber); // SESSION
COOKIE TO BE SET 

I have this cookie I have to set that will be session-based (cookie
deletes when browser session is closed, the classic). However, the
cookie is set in /Main_page/registrering.php so the path for the
cookie is incorrect; I want the path to be '/'. HOWEVER, PHP is
strict on syntax so that if I set a path, I have to set a time int
value at the same time. 

I want to set the path and NOT the time int. How do I do that?

shared server meaning what?

I don't think you mean virtual domain hosting where 1 server hosts
multiple domains. Each domain would have it's own document root.

if you mean where you are working entirely in a subdirectory on 1
domain; i.e. domain.com/site1  vs. domain.com/site2
   maybe I'd beg to drop 1 file in the root with some obscure name other
than LIB.php... even as .LIB.php so it's more hidden.
   or I would just append the dir name in the include
        include($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/site1/LIB.php");
   and "assume" that if it moves to another box that it would still stay
within the site1 dir. Else, it's not a hard search/replace.


on my dev server, I usually create multiple virtual domains

Tried all of those, Chris, they didn't set the cookie either.  Went back to

setcookie('nordicnet_registration', $registrationNumber, 0, '/');

And this time it worked.  I am at a loss.

Thanx for the suggestions.. Ian and Dan can tell you the headache I'm dealing with with the remote server.  I am forbidden to telnet nor ssh so neither of those are an option.

I used $_COOKIE['nordicnet_registration'] within a PHP script to display it; upon setcookie it was still not there (this after redirecting to the script with the $_COOKIE element).

What I wound up doing was literally changing it back to setcookie and walking away for the evening.  Coming back, it works this time.

I'm not sure how to handle this. I'm setting up a new server at the
office. I'd like to be able to set up a directory structure like this:

	/var/www/html/clientproj1  <= for client stuff
	/var/www/html/myproj <= for whatever other project I may work on

I started effing around with virtual host (see below) which works fine
for this one instance but it's not obvious how to set up another virtual
host since I really don't have "names" for each one. I access everything
using the IP address.

This works!
<VirtualHost 192.168.1.111>
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html/clientproj1  
	ServerName www.clientproj1.com
</VirtualHost>

This DOESN'T work if combined with above. The two "overlap" according to
Apache's configtest.
<VirtualHost 192.168.1.111>
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html/myproj
	ServerName www.myproj.com
</VirtualHost>

I think the answer is buried somewhere in here
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/vhosts/examples.html) but after trying
a few different things, e.g., 192.168.1.111:8080, I couldn't get it to
work with another subdir like "myproj." Suggestions?

I have several dummy domains set up on my machine.  I think your 
problem is that you're missing the first VirtualHost directive, which 
is the base one for the server (where the "Hey, your Apache install 
worked" page ends up).

Then, you can append the other virtual hosts.

And. here's my relevant snippet from httpd.conf:

---
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
ServerName 127.0.0.1
DocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/Documents
</VirtualHost>

Include /private/etc/httpd/vhosts
---

That first virtual host needs to be declared and then your others are 
handled separately.


So, inside the vhosts directory, I have several text files, each 
containing a virtual host directive.  Here's one:

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
ServerName www.clientname.me
DocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/Documents/clientname
</VirtualHost>

They all have different directories.

(These are from dummy domains that I set up on my laptop to mirror my 
client's real ones, but in principle they work exactly the same with 
a server that's serving to other machines.)

Just make sure the other machines know where to go to see www.testserver.com.

Hope that helps.  I am by no means an Apache server admin, but this 
works for me.

Why is it that within four minutes of posting something that you
suddenly come up with the answer to your own question? Well...here's one
solution that worked. Let me know if there are better ways to do this.

I set Listen:

Listen 80
Listen 192.168.1.111:8080

I then set: NameVirtualHost 192.168.1.111

Finally...I did this.

<VirtualHost 192.168.1.111:80>
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/clientproj1
        ServerName www.clientproj1.com

So...when you want to view a particular client project, what would be
the URL? That is, how do you get to clientproj1, clientproj2, in your
browser? In my situation, since I use http://192.168.1.111 to view stuff
in the browser, how do I get it - the browser - to go to those other
virtual hosts? Am I overlooking something real obvious?

I have several dummy domains set up on my machine.  I think your 
problem is that you're missing the first VirtualHost directive, which 
is the base one for the server (where the "Hey, your Apache install 
worked" page ends up).

Then, you can append the other virtual hosts.

And. here's my relevant snippet from httpd.conf:

---
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
ServerName 127.0.0.1
DocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/Documents
</VirtualHost>

Include /private/etc/httpd/vhosts
---

That first virtual host needs to be declared and then your others are 
handled separately.


So, inside the vhosts directory, I have several text files, each 
containing a virtual host directive.  Here's one:

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1>
ServerName www.clientname.me
DocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/Documents/clientname
</VirtualHost>

They all have different directories.

(These are from dummy domains that I set up on my laptop to mirror my 
client's real ones, but in principle they work exactly the same with 
a server that's serving to other machines.)

Just make sure the other machines know where to go to see
www.testserver.com.

Hope that helps.  I am by no means an Apache server admin, but this 
works for me.

Fourth attempt.. it fails now in login, I check by printing $_COOKIE['nordicnet_registration'] and there is no value there!  Guys, what on earth do I do about this????

Here is the code that sets the cookie:

if ($hasLoggedIn && ($row = mysql_fetch_row($query))) {
   setcookie('nordicnet_registration', $row['nnet_user_registrationnumber'], 0, '/');
   @mysql_free_result($query);
   mysql_close($dbConn) or die('Could not close db');
   $html .= $font . '<font color=000099>Takk for logging inn.  For forsatte ' .
            "<a href=http://$serverName/index.php?content=membersites/Palogget%20S1.php " .
            '  target=_top>klikk her</a></font></font>';
  } else if (sizeof($_POST) > 0) {
   $errorMsg .= $font . '<font color=cc0000><li>Det finns en problem med db</li></font></font><p>';
   $hasLoggedIn = 0;
  }


Because the PHP script is in a frame, instead of using header() I print out some text with a link <a href=mylink.php target=_top> for the user to click and to go to another page.  By then the cookie should be registered, yet it's not there!

I'm at a complete loss.

Phil, can you send me your url so I can try it in my browser?

I maintain my recommendation that you should quote the cookie value you
wish to set.

setcookie('nordicnet_registration',
"$row['nnet_user_registrationnumber']", 0, '/');

http://www.nordicnet.no go to "Logg inn" and enter this username and
password:

ppowell100001

You should see a text with link, click onto the link and then either you'll
go to the right URL or to logginn.php again (the WRONG URL!)

ok, I ended up on the blue fruit of the loom page...
is that the proper page?

cookie manager (Mozilla 1.4; Linux)
shows

host: www.nordicnet.no
name: nordicnet_registration
content: {}

what are you trying to store as the content?

so, it looks like the cookie was set.

Where on the blue page are you reading back the cookie data?

I am now convinced that I am not meant to code.

I did your solution and it failed.  However, when I used a solution that
earlier FAILED in registering.php (the header() solution) it WORKED in
logginn.php!

BUT.. setcookie() WORKS in registrering.php and FAILS in logginn.php

Hans? Anyone? Explain that one!

Phil,

when I follow your login instructions I get the following header
back from the login:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 06 Sep 2003 19:44:59 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.27 (Unix) PHP/4.3.0 mod_gzip/1.3.19.1a
FrontPage/5.0.2.2510 mod_layout/3.2
X-Powered-By: PHP/4.3.0
Set-Cookie: nordicnet_registration=deleted; expires=Fri,
06-Sep-2002 19:44:58 GMT; path=/
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

I think a different line of code is executing, cuz there's a date
there, and it's a year old, which explains why it's not taking.

Pat

Pat, how did you do that?  I've never been able to figure out how to obtain
headers like that from my browser.

I closed and reopened my browser to refresh settings, and then I go to
logginn.php to log in.  I don't know what other line of code is running, but
at this point I'm going to just totally violate protocol and dump the entire

I'd like to recommend Mozilla with the Live HTTP Headers tool:
http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/

It's saved my sanity on a number of occasions.

Thanx.. but I can't find the utility, unless you refer to the online
decipher.  I can't check Palogget%20S1.php either :(

OK this is how I did my test:

1) I go to registrering.php and register fully, thereby setting the
nordicnet_registration cookie.  It's all set, everything is fine (uses
setcookie() with 0 time).

2) I close my browser

3) I reboot computer (just for safety sake)

4) I reopen my browser and go to logginn.php

5) I log in, however, setcookie() this time does NOT work, the cookie is not
set because AFTER I click the link to go to another page the
$_COOKIE['nordicnet_registration'] value is empty, thus, no cookie. HOWEVER,
header() DOES work in logginn.php!

6) I change the code in registrering.php to do header() instead of
setcookie() (remember: setcookie() works, header() does NOT work in
registrering.php)

7) I close the browser

8) I reboot computer

9) I reopen browser

10) I go to registrering.php Now THIS TIME I have header() and NOT
setcookie() instead of the reverse. I register under a new name and email..
Registration is complete, the cookie SHOULD be set.  I get a link to click.
I click the link, go to my next page.. AND NO COOKIE!

So.. this is what happens:

registrering.php:

Register -> setcookie('stuff', $stuff, 0, '/') WORKS -> click link -> there
is the cookie!

Register -> header() FAILS -> click link -> NO COOKIE

logginn.php:

Login -> setcookie('stuff', $stuff, 0, '/') FAILS -> click link -> NO COOKIE

Login -> header() WORKS -> click link -> there is the cookie!

I should have been more clear maybe?
Live HTTP headers is a plugin for the Mozilla web browser, available at 
http://mozilla.org/
If you try the install link with Mozilla and you still get errors, then 
you need to upgrade. :-)

One other hopefully unrelated note concerning Internet Explorer and 
cookies-- IE can be set to reject cookies from sites that don't set a 
P3P privacy header. This probably isn't happening to you, but it's 
something to keep in the back of your head if some IE users get your 
cookies and others don't.

for 

 header("Set-Cookie:nordicnet_registration={"
.$row['nnet_user_registrationnumber'] . "}; path=/");

I see 2 things:

1. Do you want the value wrapped in curly braces? If not, it should
be either:


header("Set-Cookie:nordicnet_registration={$row['nnet_user_registrat
ionnumber']}; path=/");
   or 
 header("Set-Cookie:nordicnet_registration="
.$row['nnet_user_registrationnumber'] . "; path=/");


2. I suspect the real problem is that
$row['nnet_user_registrationnumber'] is null. That would definitely
make the browser discard the cookie.

perhaps you should start by using a common function for both
registration and login pages for setting the cookie

that way you have a better chance of isolating the problem, rather than
maintaining 2 separate pieces of code.

duoble-check your IE settings as Chris suggested as it all seemed to
work ok for me with Mozilla.

$_REQUEST is available, but register_globals is on :(

*duck*

It has to be on to support most third-parts apps.

It seems register_globals still haunts us.  I think it's safe to say that register_globals was a *bad idea*.

Well this is how I solved it:

if ($hasLoggedIn && ($row = mysql_fetch_row($query)) {
 setcookie('nordicnet_registration', $row[0], 0, '/');
 ...
}

That works!! Apparently the problem was neither setcookie nor header, AND it
was BOTH!

Figure that one out, geniuses!!! ;)

you changed from $row['nnet_user_registrationnumber'] to $row[0].

I'd bet that the name of column 0 in the sql resulset isn't
'nnet_user_registrationnumber'

The -q flag to sendmail proper will run the current queue.  You'd need something like:

sendmail -ODeliveryMode=q

Nevertheless, this wouldn't help all that much, Peter.  The lag you're seeing is because sendmail is verifying the recipient address, DNS, etc.  When a message is queued, this verification still takes place.  Simply, it's a real pain to avoid this delay when sending mail from PHP, running embedded in Apache.  Long story short, you need to fork() out to a daemon; and this is particularly true when sending large amounts of mail.  This might be a good FUNDAMENTALS topic sometime.

Then perhaps the mysql fetch is not returning and ASSOCiative array or BOTH?

Does your mysql_connect or mysql_pconnect specify either of these flags?

are you able to use association to get other mysql fetched results?

phil used:

which does not return an associative array.

I normally use mysql_fetch_array with the MYSQL_ASSOC constant, but since
this is guaranteed to return 1 row (or no rows) I felt using a while() loop
with mysql_fetch_array was a waste of time.

I just jumped into this thread, but it seems the development process is a bit, uhh, erratic :)

Consider that you have have three essential peices of logic here, all of which have to come together to give the end result you require (logging, and remaining logged in).  They are:

1) Database query and fetching of the result to determine if the proper user credentials were supplied.

2) Sending an indication to the browser that they've supplied the proper credentials (ie, writing the cookie to the browser)

3) Getting an indication from the browser that they have the proper credentials (ie, reading the cookie from the browser).

Now you can troubleshoot each of these steps, and isolate where the exact problem is.

For 1 above:  make sure you don't have typeing issues, and that your DB is responding 100% correctly.  Meaning, doing a boolean test of ($row = mysql_fetch_row($query)) is scarey to me.  Pull a value explicitly out of the result set, or at least know that you're testing an int, ie:  if( mysql_num_rows($result) === 1 ).  Better yet, do a var_dump() of your final DB result variables (whether they be associative, numeric, etc. arrays) so you know exactly what data you're getting back.

For 2 and 3 above:  when working with cookies, or headers in general, I always use the livehttpheaders plugin for Mozilla.  You can see exactly what is being sent between you and the web server, and can even edit and replay headers to test how your application behaves.  Once you see exactly what you expect being sent back and forth as cookies/headers, you know that piece is working.  If, however the end result expected behavior still isn't what you want, you know it must now be logic in your application that is checking if the user is logged in or not.

Lastly, now use IE :)  If things break, it's a quirk and Google or the php.net user notes will hopefully be able to help you.

And please, try to trim your posts when replying.  Thanks,

H

It's a matter of context and style, IMO.  Function arguments are explicit to that function call, while a global variable isn't and is expected to be operated on regardless of a particular function.  And, as Chris and Chris pointed out, you'll get some nasty-long function calls :)

Here are some [probably obvious] thoughts:
 
I would suggest thinking _not_ in terms of functionality (e.g. Content
Management, Groupware, etc.) but rather value.  Bluntly stated, what will
the _output_ of all this stuff do for your client.  How much money will they
save?  How many more prospects will it uncover?  How much faster will it
increase their cash cycle?  In the perfect world, your invoice should be
only slightly less than the value all of these combined - the delta being a
function of client management...remember (pardon the crude analogy) the
difference between rape and making love is salesmanship!

Ok i ahve been developing PHP web application for a couple fo years now but
they have always been on a volunteer or personal basis.  Now I have a client
that wants a custom web application and I am not sure how much to charge
them.  So of the features that this web application included are:
 
Contact Management 
Personal Appointment book as well as global appointment book
Resume management
meeting management
admin features(Such as adding new users)
Sending out template based email to well over 100 individuals
dynamic word document creation
and many other features...
 
This system is replacing other application such as Goldmine, resume grabber,
and will also eliminate many steps such as sending emails in outlook.
 
if anyone has an idea on how much something like this goes for please let me
know.

Hans, getting me to think methodically like you do would be like asking a

Happy it's coming together.  Sorry I can't help here (I've found being methodical doesn't help much when dealing with frames :)

There are tons for Unix. Most people don't have a reason not to just use
tcpdump, which is on every Unix server I've ever seen. But, I wanted more. :-)

I wrote an HTTP proxy in PHP (to play with the sockets extension) that displays
the HTTP transaction for the parent resource at the bottom of the Web page
(pretty convenient). It still lacks several features and sucks more than
desired, so if anyone feels like making it suck less, feel free to improve it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Retrieving remote files-- caution
Message-ID: <3F5AB072.6090707@chxo.com>

Learned a lesson tonight...

If you're going to use file_get_contents() (or any function with fopen 
wrappers) to allow users to import a file from some other website, 
always check to make sure that the supplied url starts with "http://" 
and not, say, "/etc".

function url_get_contents ( $url ) {
    $array= parse_url($url);
    if ( $array['scheme']=='http' || $array['scheme']=='ftp' ) {
        return file_get_contents($url);
    }else {
        return 0;
    }
}

I used to always use fsockopen for this, but file_get_contents seemed so 
easy by comparison -- except for the part where it was really built to 
handle local files. Doh!

Phil --

Maybe you should try and remember what a pain it was to debug the
setcookie() issue in a non-methodical way. :)

But seriously, my suggestion is whenever you're getting frustrated
to take a deep breath, a five minute break, then come back and put
together a step-by-step list of what you're trying to
accomplish. Once you're armed with a list, you can then verify that
each step is getting the correct input and providing the correct
output. Often times, merely the process of figuring this out will
trigger what you should do to fix the bug.

You can use the Set-Target header, but I believe this only works on
Netscape and not IE. If you do figure out a way to solve this under
IE, please let me know because I was trying to track this answer down
for someone recently and couldn't come up with a solution.

Thanx for the suggestion.  The "five-minute break" is something I need to do
more often, to be honest I frustrate myself into a corner and continually
bang my head against the wall until I give myself a headache :)

I did figure it out but it involves a total Javascript solution, afraid
there is no other solution for this :(

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mySQL datetime fields default now() fails
Message-ID: <090801c3753b$e99da990$67a76244@philofsoa>

I have a mySQL database table with a column field datatype of datetime that I set up in the original create table statement like this:

create table nnet_usermetadata (
...
 nnet_record_entered datetime default 'now()'
)

However, upon execution, each time a record is entered into nnet_usermetadata the results are:

00-00-0000 00:00:00

Is there a way I can always ensure that the current date and time are always entered into the datetime field?  I would prefer to not have a server-side PHP or any other scripting solution because by doing so would mean I would have to alter my table to do so, and after the barrage of questions you've received from me would you trust me to do so effectively?

I believe this is because you are trying to enter the string 'now()'
into the field instead of the results of the function named
now(). However, I bet you tried it without the quotes first and got a
MySQL error message like this: "You have an error in your SQL syntax
near 'now())'"

I went to Google and typed in "default now() mysql" and unless things
have changed in MySQL since 2001 (which is possible), you cannot do
this because default values must be constants. (That's why MySQL spews
that SQL syntax error.)

However, I don't think you'd actually need to alter your table to make
sure you always entered the date -- you'd just need to alter all your
INSERTs and UPDATEs by adding some code to generate the date as part
of your SQL. Of course, that may be worse, but what you need to
do. Alternatively, it looks like MSSQL might support this syntax. :)

Ok, w/o spending 4.5 hours reinventing the wheel, is there an online example
of how to insert the current date/time into a mySQL datetime column field?
I only have to put it in one place for now but better to learn it now,
thanx!

I figured it out but it's a PHP solution, not a mySQL solution:

date("Y-m-d H:i:s")

How inferior.  You can employ pre-defined constants in Oracle, SQL Server,
even stinkin' ACCESS, but not mySQL?

Phil,

I think you want to be using the timestamp column type instead.

http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/DATETIME.html

note that the value will be automatically set if you do not explicity
provide a value for it.

meaning...

if you want to preserve the original value on update, you need to return
the original value with the update query.

alternately, there are other mysql date/time functions you can use with
now() or current() that should work, just don't put them in quotes in
the insert statement.

This is great advice. The setcookie line of questioning perfectly illustrates
why erroneous assumptions can make simple problems into very complex ones.

For example, consider this calculation:

(25 * 4) * 10

There are basically three pieces of data here that are combined together in two
operations to produce the final output. Now, consider this question:

Does anyone know WHY I can multiply 100 by 10 and get 1250??? See if you can
explain THAT one!!!

After scores of messages back and forth, it is realized that the error was that
the following calculation was actually being performed:

(25 * 5) * 10

So, if the question asked had been why 5 was being returned by something
instead of 4, the answer would have been much easier (and less misleading).

Breaking things down is essential to solving problems. This should have been
the first test to prove the assumption wrong:

100 * 10

This would have given 1000, not 1250, so the erroneous assumption should never
even be mentioned in the question. A little effort up front can save a lot of
time for everyone.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Thanks for pointing this out since I always use the function... it would be
nice to see some type of basic security policy for PHP in regards to certain
methods like these ... most languages go by the notion that "bytes are
bytes" no matter where u get them from, but it would be safer to define
walls for certain "dangerous methods" + include them in php.ini for better
safekeeping.  I always thought it would be nice to do something like what
you did beyond a policy that was saying "you can do this" "you can't do
that", like in Java + instead have security handlers instead ... for example
a policy would maybe be like: file_get_contents.allow or
file_get_contents.deny but instead allow a security handler to check params
globally ... file_get_contents.handler = (some method to check w/ first) ...

Message-ID: <0aa701c375aa$25b0f4f0$67a76244@philofsoa>

My first time working with a PHP class, and after 6 hours of working out the kinks I am unable to return a value from the class, so now I appeal to the general audience what on earth did I do wrong this time?

This is the code the retrieves the values:

if (($hasRegistered || $hasPreRegistered) && !empty($uplinenumber)) {
   // CHECK TO SEE IF UPLINE NUMBER IS A VALID NUMBER
   $regNumberGenerator = new RegNumberGenerator($uplinenumber, $email, $dbConn);
   if (!$regNumberGenerator->isValidUplinenumber()) {
    $hasRegistered = 0; $hasPreRegistered = 0;
    $errorMsg .= $font . '<font color=cc0000><li>Du m&#229;ste skicka geltig upline nr., takk!' .
                 '</li></font></font><p>';
   // ERROR PRODUCED UPON REG OR PRE-REG MODE - FORM WILL BE REPOPULATED BY $_POST ELEMENTS
   // NO NEED FOR DB ANY FURTHER

    @mysql_free_result($query); // FREE RESOURCES BUT SUPPRESS WARNINGS IF NON-SELECT QUERY
    mysql_close($dbConn); // CLOSE DB CONNECTION
   } else {
    $registrationNumber = $regNumberGenerator->getRegNumber();
    $registrationNumberForUsername = $regNumberGenerator->getRegNumberDecDigits($registrationNumber);
    $registrationNumberForEmail = $regNumberGenerator->getRegNumberDecDigits($registrationNumber, '-');
   }
  }

And here is the class itself:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Script terminates after certain amount of time period
Message-ID: <087b01c375fe$4a05e870$3500a8c0@com1>

Hello all,

I am facing 1 problem of script termination by browser. My problem is:

My php script generates PDF document that takes approx 2 mins to generate 1.5 MB PFD depending upon criteria, But if i choose more data and when PDF size is to be needed more than 2 MB and higher, browser says "The page cannot be displayed" after few mins, ie php scripts is terminated. However i don't get any php error like "Maximum executon time over" or "Memory size limit exceeded" etc. I have used "set_time_limit();" to increase script execution time but it is not working, also i have tried "sleep()" to delay program execution but it is not also working, or may be it is to be used in another way but i am sure i am using it in proper way. 

Hence is there any other way to keep my browser happy, when it is time to execute long process and to generate heavy output file by executing any script from browser ?

Thanks,

Anirudh Zala

There are two problems, I think:

1. Set your time limit to something big for this script.
<http://www.php.net/set_time_limit>
2. Are you using IE? Don't.

Hope that helps.

Hi,

I just installed the mysql rpm and now I need to know the location of
the mysql tree to install php. However, when I checked, it seems that
mysql is installed all over the place. The system I installed mysql is
mandrake 7.0.

Does anyone know the correct mysql tree to use with the installation
flag

with-mysql=DIR

in this case - mysql installed from an rpm.

Below is output from locate mysql:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] First Big Client
Message-ID: <E19wNgF-00041v-IH@rslrs1-server.com>

Mark's advise is very sage.

Other things to consider are what you think they can afford and/or what
you can afford to do it for and whether or not there is likely to be any
follow-on work.

To address what you can afford to do it for; i.e. how low can you go;
consider how it impacts your capacity to do other work that might pay a
better rate. If you have nothing to do, need the money and have no other
prospects, doing a project for "not very much money" is a whole lot
better than doing nothing for no money.

I often am in the position to consider whether or not I will receive any
additional work from a client when I am pricing initial jobs for them.
If I am certain that it is a one-off, I will be far less inclined to
give them any price breaks to secure the business. If there is a good
chance that there will be more work coming from them, I will want to
develop the relationship and may consider giving them a lower or more
competitive price so that I can be a prefered vendor for them.

One forty hour job at $100/hour ($4000) is not as valuable to me as two
forty hour jobs at $65/hour ($5200) with the prospect for more work.

I have them over a barrel, I will usually give them my top hourly rate,
because, well, I can. Still, I won't overdo it and ask for $1,000/hour
because they never truly are over a barrel. There's always someone else
who can do it for $500/hour.

In considering what they can afford, you have to examine who they are.
Are they off-broadway actors (notoriously poor) or lawyers (notoriously
well-to-do). Start-up or well-established? Don't price yourself out of
their range of affordability.

Of course, if you can get them to divulge their budget, things get a lot
easier. If not, it can take a very keen sense to arrive at figures that
both parties are happy with.

Always leave yourself open to discussion and review of the feature sets
and price. I try not to allow the client to go ala carte with features,
but often their original requests contain parts of the site that are
very complex to implement and have little ROI. Identify those things,
cut them out and give them a revised quote.


Sorry for the lengthy reply that doesn't directly address your question.
:) Hope you/someone finds it useful.


Regarding your pricing, you need to start by breaking down the list of
features into sub-components.
"Content Management" is way to large to consider on its own.

Next, look at those sub-components and their details, then estimate how
long it might take you to implement (err on the high side, you'll be
glad you did later after returning to this list to seek additional
guidance).

Add that all up, multiply by your targeted hourly rate and add 10%-15%
(this is easy to knock-off later in negotiations without feeling like
you're getting ripped off).


If I were to price this out (not knowing what's involved in "and many
other features...") I would be solidly in the 5-figures range
($10,000-$99,000), maybe more. After all, you did say it was "custom." :)

This is great stuff.  Let's get something like this formalized and added into the Fundamentals website, alongside the Ten Commandments.  Website development is unqiue, in that there are several very seperate, yet equally vital, parts of the equation (for example, browser interaction, DB interaction, and application logic).  If any of these are broken, the whole system breaks, yet it can be difficult to know where the problem stems from.

In your case it would be /usr/include/mysql but did you try to compile with
just --with-mysql + no directory option ... it normally works fine.

I think you'll need to step back and revisit the code.  There's nothing special about return a value from a class method (in this case anyway).  However:  

>     $registrationNumber = $regNumberGenerator->getRegNumber();

When I examine the code you posted, that function is only defined as:

   function getRegNumber() {
    return $regNumber;
   }

Which doesn't do anything.

No I haven't compiled yet because it said in a book I am using that the
default is /usr/local.

Thanks for the help,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP growth
Message-ID: <000001c37627$728b9be0$bf8d3818@OBERON1>

  Thought this might be of interest:

Posted August 30, 2003 01:42 PM @ news.netcraft.com

Although PHP is universally thought of as implying Linux, Apache and MySQL,
nearly 7% of PHP sites [when counting by ip address] run on Windows. This
has doubled over the last year, and on its current growth trajectory PHP
will overtake (my emphasis) Cold Fusion as the most popular non-Microsoft
scripting language used on Windows during the next year.

Web site developers are less dogmatic than many analysts like to portray,
and are prepared to mix development paradigms when it suits their purpose.
.. Scripting languages are seeing the best growth of any class of web
technologies presently as site owners seek to make their sites more
sophisticated and see a good return on the development time invested.

Excerpted from:
http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2003/08/30/php_growing_surprisingly_strong
ly_on_windows.html

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Include File Access
Message-ID: <HPEDLHFCBCJOAJDODGKMOEBFCEAA.rudy@taytek.com>

Give the following web site file architecture:

           Root
              |
     -----------------------------
     |                 |              |          |
page1         page2      page3    inc

I place my util.php file in the "inc" directory.  As it turns out I need to
access this file from the Root directory as well as the various page
directories.  While I can place the relative path to the include file with
{ include "./inc/util.php"  } for the Root and   { include
"../inc/util.php" }  for the sub-pages, this causes problems with my common
code.

I construct my pages with common code that controls the left side of the
page.  This code utilizes the functions in the util.php include.  As it
stands now the include fails because the util.php file cannot be found.  I
really don't want to modify this include statement for each of my pages
depending on their depth relative to the directory containing the include
files.

Granted I could flatten the site structure and get rid of this problem but
that would create considerable complexity when trying to work on the site.

I was thinking about creating an environment PATH to the inc directory as
one way to keep the include code that same and still be able to access the
util.php file.

Any suggestions??

Thanks,
Rudy

This is precisely what the recent Fundamentals topic was.  Within a week we 
should have a beta of "best [or at least common] practices"--no help to you 
now, I realize--except that you have just contributed yet another element 
to the complexity of the example.

Hans,
Was it by design that you picked db interaction (Model), Browser interaction
(View), Application logic (Controller).  Sounds a lot like MVC architecture.

I have been building dynamic sites for a while now and have been use MVC as
my approach. It is implement via three state machines, Business State
Machine (Controller), Forms State Machine (View) and a Message State Machine
(not part of the MVC).  Underneath it all is the database which goes almost
without saying (Model).

I been using NetObjects Fusion as my html tool of choice and it has provided
a framework that is very object like.  Hardly ideal but workable.

I try to be as object oriented in my approach as possible meaning that most
visual objects carry with them their behavior.  As the business state
changes the objects respond accordingly either by making themselves visible
or changing configuration.  I have found that by focusing my design to
individual objects, the implementation is greatly simplified.  While a
complex page may consist of many individual objects they are all being
driven by the business state machine.

Just food for thought.

Rudy

This is great stuff.  Let's get something like this formalized and added
into the Fundamentals website, alongside the Ten Commandments.  Website
development is unqiue, in that there are several very seperate, yet equally
vital, parts of the equation (for example, browser interaction, DB
interaction, and application logic).  If any of these are broken, the whole
system breaks, yet it can be difficult to know where the problem stems from.

Thanks for the info.  Before posting this question I reviewed the
Fundamentals topic and wasn't able to find a solution.  I try to stay
current with this list and feel like I taking a college course that requires
considerable reading every night.

If I figure out an approach to my issue you can be sure I will offer it up
to the Fundamentals topic.  For now I'll do some trail blazing of my own.

This is precisely what the recent Fundamentals topic was.  Within a week we
should have a beta of "best [or at least common] practices"--no help to you
now, I realize--except that you have just contributed yet another element
to the complexity of the example.

Obviously a quick solution would be to just use the absolute path to the 
util.php file... or am I missing something?

If you had a number of such paths that you needed to set (or other 
vlaues that you wanted to make available to every script in the 
application), you could define() them as constants in a config.php file:

config.php:

    <?php
    // constants for my application
    define ( 'APP_UTIL', '/path/to/www/inc/util.php' );
    ... other stuff  

script.php:

    <?php
    require_once('/path/to/config.php');
    include(APP_UTIL);

You sill have to change all your files if the path to the config.php 
file changes, of course.

Rudy,

If you structure your include statement look like this, it will work no 
matter where you place the calling page:

include($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/inc/util.php);

Brian's et al's comments are most helpful to this semi-professionl PHP
dude who would like to get more work. There are lots of intriguing
questions that I have about hourly rates, going rates, care and feeding of
clients, and perhaps most important, how to estimate the hours that a
project will take. I used to think ewerything took me 8 times longer than
I thought it should because of my incompetence. Now I think, yeah, I'm a
plodder, that's part of it... but it ain't the whole story. This stuff
takes time. (Yeah I know, all other things being equal, the genius will
bang it out in an afternoon while three weeks later, the non-genius' brain
will be fried, eyes stinging from too much monitor-staring, the job still
not done.)

Some of these are delicate questions that are perhaps best discussed in a
nonpublic forum, Once upon a time the translation and interpretation
industry (in which I have my day job) was the subject of FTC investigation
for price-fixing, because people were talking about what to charge. It was
not pleasant.

Maybe I'll show up at that party on the 19th and pick you-guys' brains.

Yes and no.  I've always felt that a well designed and architectured site is divided up into these three main areas.  Regardless of the label, or the implementation itself, good design is good design.

I agree to a large degree.  All sites, no matter how complex, have these three main segments.  It's a matter of implementation, at the architectural and code levels, how successful and well designed a site is.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of complex OO designs, especially in PHP4.  Putting aside performance issues, I've found classes/objects become inflexible and hackish as they start to grow in complexity.  And by complexity, I mean complex logic and processes; they're great for storing "physically" related data.  I think most would be hard pressed to show an 100% OO site.  There are always some "glue" functions, and instead of forcing a lot of logic into classes, a bit more equally weighted OO/procedural design can be great.

The most successful model I've found is a hybrid of OO and procedural.  That is to say, an object representing a more-or-less physical item or data, which is then processed and handled by various functions.  This is still MVC in an architectural sense, but I've found it allows a greater degree of seperation between logic and data.  Granted, with PHP4 you're not going to see much of a performance boost versus strict OOD.

Just a couple of cents,

You might be able to leverage include_path a bit?

-- in php.ini itself
-- using a .htaccess or httpd.conf "Apache time" configuration change
-- http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.set-include-path.php
-- ini_set()

You can then change the include path, even at run time, as needed. While this can be hugely powerful and useful, stay on your toes; it can also get out of control :)

For whatever reason, your mail client isn't maintaining the MessageID, References and related email headers.

That's a much more elegant solution, as long as all of your scripts are 
being called via the web.

I misread the line "As it turns out I need to access this file from the 
Root directory as well" as meaning that he had scripts that were being 
called from a cron job or other via CLI. Sorry!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Virtual Hosts
Message-ID: <006801c3763f$e8782130$6401a8c0@EZDSDELL>

I was looking at Dan Kushner's presentation on Setup/Dev under Win2000
at 
http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/ampintro3/ 

I found this on slide 19 of the presentation. 

      <VirtualHost *>
         DocumentRoot "c:\sites\foo.localhost"
         ServerName foo.localhost
         php_value auto_prepend_file
"c:\sites\foo.localhost\prepend.inc"
      </VirtualHost>

      <VirtualHost *>
         DocumentRoot "c:\sites\bar.localhost"
         ServerName bar.localhost
      </VirtualHost> 

The question is, how do I adapt this for the following scenario:

My development is done on a separate server (Linux box) and is accessed
solely with an IP address. Therefore, I'm not doing development on the
same box as PHP and, correct me if I'm wrong, I can't use "localhost" as
part of the address to get to the Linux box. How do I accomplish the
virtual hosting thing in this scenario? (At present I'm using port
numbers but that's kinda clumsy.)

You could add the remote machine to your local /etc/hosts (*nix) or 
c:/windows/hosts (win -- at least win98 and me) so that you could access 
it with a host name (or names) that weren't resolved via DNS.

 From my /etc/hosts file:

192.168.123.60  mothra
192.168.123.60  sub.mothra

192.168.123.60 is a box on my local network, no DNS records for it but I 
can still go to http://mothra/ or http://sub.mothra/ and end up where I 
want to be. The httpd.conf on mothra has name virtual hosts that 
correspond to those hostnames.

it works in conjunction with your host file

windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts

in which case ur ip will be given a local name to use as part of the "host:"
header to allow for multiple setups.  you need to edit the file in order to
get a developmental virtual hosting setup running.

192.168.0.7    linuxbox

typing in "linuxbox" would resolve to 192.168.0.7 and

<VirtualHost *>
DocumentRoot "c:\somewhere"
ServerName linuxbox
</VirtualHost>

would let you map it back ... you can also use a mounted DocumentRoot (x:,
y:, z:, etc)

Thank you Chris and Jon. I think I'm almost there.

This is what I have in my "hosts" file on WinXP:

192.168.1.111   unap
192.168.1.111   myproj


When I run apachectl configtest it comes back with this message. 
[warn] NameVirtualHost 192.168.1.111:80 has no VirtualHosts

Obviously...I'm missing some setting. 

Jeff

I'm guessing you have something like:

<VirtualHost *>
   Blah blah blah
</VirtualHost>

Change it to:

<VirtualHost 192.168.1.111:80>
   Blah blah blah
</VirtualHost>

making sure that the:

NameVirtualHost 192.168.1.111:80


comes first.  And that "Blah blah blah" is critical  :)

Does anyone have any recommendations on either using IRC as a real-time chat plug-in or would they recommend somethng else?  I built my own chat client in Java once but it only works if I install it on the machine I have direct access to, so I would have to do this remotely.

Suggestions?  Just wondering, no major rush on this one. For once. :)

I've used mIRC on Windows and BitchX on Linux.

IRC can be great, and a lot of fun; as long as you have nothing else to do :)

Hey Aaron!

I have a solution, switch ISP's.  I work for an ISP, we support all ASP, are
running IIS 5.0 and 6.0 on Advanced Server 2000 and Server 2003 respectively
and CDONTS are enabled!  Plus we also support PHP and Perl on both servers
as well as on Apache/Linux.  And PostgreSql/MySQL/MS SQLServer.  And I admin
the servers so I would be happy to troubleshoot any problems you are having.

If your interested, contact me either here of off the list.

Also, here is a good resource for ASP:

maybe use this instead?
ini_set('max_execution_time', '600');

however, if you are running in safe mode, you can only change this via
php.ini

phpinfo() will tell you if you have safe mode on or off

Read my response again. Specifically:

What I meant by this is that IE is likely giving you the BS error message, and
it isn't the least bit helpful. In fact, it is usually very misleading.

Chris is right, I would pull it up in another browser, just to make sure
that you are actually getting the real error message.

Also, depending on how big the PDF files are that are being created, you may
want to look into the memory limit entry in php.ini, to make sure that you
have enough to allow the PDF to be created.

memory_limit = 8M      ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (8MB)

Sorry, I came into this post late, please excuse me if this has already been
suggested.

Good Luck!

Tom

Read my response again. Specifically:

What I meant by this is that IE is likely giving you the BS error message,
and
it isn't the least bit helpful. In fact, it is usually very misleading.

Guys,

I need some web space and a MySQL access to set up a post nuke site within
the next 8 hours.  Anybody got any suggestions?

To start with I'll simply link to the needed dynamic pages for the next
month or so.....  But it needs to be up by tonight.

i have always thought that companies would move away from the licensing
towards free components + put more money back into programmers pockets but
then the fear over shipping development overseas gets to me ...

do most of you here work in a case related to where there is transitions
taking place?  (ie Java, CFM, ASP-> PHP)?

id be interested in hearing stories ...

OK, this may be a little OT, but OTOH it's about web/database programming
(and the Customer Experience).

I have been back and forth with Travelocity's customer service because I
complained about the following phenomenon. You search for flights; you
select an outboound flight priced at $405/round trip; you select a return
flight priced at $405/round trip; then you come to a screen that says
oh, sorry, make that $652 for this itinerary. Fine, you say; prices are
volatile so let's try again. You repeat the procedure, with the
reasonable, almost unconscious expectation that their data will have been
updated, and guess what, you get the exact same behavior. Not amusing!

Now, their customer service folks have given me a series of ever more
muddled and inconsistent explanations. First they said,

> Our system pulls the information from the Sabre network onto the site
> based on the data you enter in your search parameters. The airlines, car
> rental agencies, and hotels publish their information in Sabre and are

> you may see rates/fares offered that have no availability left, or
> itineraries that show valid prices based on our most current
> information, but are actually no longer available at that price when
> checked against actual availability in the system.

But when I insisted that I was the customer and I said it sucked that they
were displaying stale data regardless of the excuse, they said (and I wish
I were making this up):

<<The information we receive from Airlines is current at the point in
which is it is supplied.  We do not have have a direct connect to
availability, once a request is made, the new request is sent to the the
airlines to check against availability.>>

<<At this point the airlines will notify us if the availability is still
there.  As the availability is constantly changing, so is the
availability. [sic] >>

What is it with the airline/travel website industry? If they have the
wherewithal to connect with wherever and fetch current data at the moment
you are about to go for your plastic, then they can do it before they
display the prices, can't they?

Perhaps switch-and-bat is their true intention. But if they want to get it
right, they should hire some NYPHPers to rebuild the whole deal from the
ground up (-:

Message-ID: <JMEHLOIOFHBEJDCDJNLOIEKCEAAA.chendry@nyc.rr.com>

unfortunately, the problem comes in with the cost of the searches.  There
are multiple levels of searches available to the Travelocities of the
world - the most expensive being the up-to-the-minute fares.  If they
provided each person casually browsing for flights the up-to-the-minute
prices, they'd go out of business.  These sites only see about a 1%
conversion.

What you're seeing when you first search is not avialable fares, but cached
fares (a much cheaper search .00066 compared with .05 - or something like
that) - the travel sites will not show you the available fares until you say
you'd like to book.

That said, not all engines use the Sabre GDS (though most do) - which is the
one that charges the most for look-for-book fares - so try other sites and
you should get better results.  Though Sabre is the only GDS that offers
webfares (ie, better rates on the web than available through travel agents).

ps - one of the sites (to remain unnamed) has hired some of us NYPHPers and
once the backend is complete, I'll be sure to release the site (and
hopefully friends & family rates) to NYPHPers, so keep your chin up, help is
on the way...

All of this growth in PHP use is great but what I want to know is where is all of the growth in the PHP jobs?  Especially in NY.  In Delaware I had no trouble getting interviews or even job offers but since I moved up here, I have trouble just trying to find places accepting resumes.  This wouldn't be such a problem if it weren't for that three hour commute to Wilmington.  Does anyone have any good resources or pointers for a guy new to the big city looking for a job?

most of what I do is (thankfully) fresh development rather than porting
someone else's crappy code. This way, if the code is crappy, it's at
least crappy in my own style.

To answer the other post about where to find PHP jobs in NY(C)... I have
seen scant few actual FT positions available. I do all my work on a
freelance/consulting basis.

I might suspect that the best way to do PHP FT would be to get a job
doing ASP or PERL and then work on getting PHP to replace those
languages where you can.

I work for a technical recruiting company in NYC and I can tell you 
that most of the jobs we have are for C++, Java or .NET. That's not to 
say these companies don't use open source tools, they just don't 
actively recruit for those skills. Linux being an exception to that. 
Most of your larger companies are more interested in scalability and 
support rather than time to development. They can always hire more 
people to speed up a project.
The midsize companies who are outgrowing Access and/or FileMaker are 
ideal candidates for PHP and MySQL, but they don't know enough about 
them to go that direction. I've done some consulting on the side and 
I've had clients who wanted a completely web based system with 
Filemaker as the backend (egads!). They have Filemaker (or Access) and 
are comfortable with them.
I've actually gotten my foot in the door many times because I knew 
Filemaker, not because I knew PHP and MySQL. Although I've ended up 
doing the project in PHP/MySQL.

I believe there still needs to be more growth in the PHP market share 
before you'll start seeing a big demand for it. Cold Fusion has a 
larger market share, but there aren't many jobs on the job boards for 
it in the NYC area.

What job boards have you looked on? You may have more success looking 
at one of the non-commercial job boards like Craigs List.

True, but it still perplexes me why anyone, who has opted to and
received the a-ok to implement an AMP solution, would still elect to
have the end product be WAMP instead of LAMP

I guess it's some irrational fear of the command-line.

Subject: XML SIG 16 Sept -- Sam Hunting on new developments in Topic
Maps


Greetings XML Special Interest Group. We begin our sixth (!) year of
meetings this month. Goldman Sachs will continue to provide the
facilities without which our meetings would not be feasible. I am most
grateful for that, and to all of the Goldman people who have worked with
us to make these SIG meetings possible. Our 'home' in the training
center at 125 Broad Street has now been closed, however, and the regular
venue for our meetings will be the Goldman Sachs Training Center on the
31st Floor at 180 Maiden Lane. Please note this change. I'll look
forward to seeing many of you at meetings this year.

The next meeting of the XML Special Interest Group will be Tuesday, 16
September, 7-9 p.m., hosted by Goldman Sachs at 180 Maiden Lane, 31st
Floor.

Our speaker will be Sam Hunting, presenting his perspective on the
latest developments in Topic Maps. One point which Sam emphasizes is the
formal rigor that compliance with ISO 13250 introduces to topic map
implementations. Questions of such formally demonstrable capability seem
to be recently more numerous and insistent, as, e. g. the XML-DEV thread
late last month on whether XML vocabularies are at an advantage or
disadvantage versus the apparent formal rigor of the relational model.
Sam writes:

The latest on Topic Maps: Hard thinking, actual clients, new and better
tools

The talk is a tour d'horizon of current topic map technologies:

    * Theory as mathematical model
    * Practice at the USGS
    * New free tools

Theory of topic maps will present--for the first time--a set-theoretic
mathematical formalism for topic maps, developed by Neill Kipp with
Steve Newcomb and Sam Hunting. This work is important from a technical
perspective, since such a formalism can ensure that developers of topic
map standards and implementations are "all on the same page" with
respect the meaning of the text of ISO 13250. From a marketing
perspective, the work means that, for the first time, topic mappers can
claim formal rigor with the same force that proponents of the relational
model can.

Practice of topic maps will present--again, for the first time--the
prototype of the topic map system developed for the United States
Geological Survey by eTopicality, Inc. The USGS has requirements that
can be met only by an implementation of the topic map paradigm: A
federated system that permits free navigation between multiple,
overlapping taxonomies. The implementation to be presented is the first
step toward this goal: It is a topic map that implements a "subject
catalog" for USGS holdings on coastal and marine geology data that
allows entries into the catalog to be edited, all using open source
software and an ordinary browser.

New tools for topic maps will showcase--again, for the first time--the
newest release from the GooseWorks project, tmtk-0.8. This open source
toolkit permits people to create Topic Map Applications (TMAs) using a
simple XML DTD. The Standard Application Model developed by
TopicMaps.Org ("XTM") is one such application, but others may be
necessary to serve client needs. XTM, for example, permits addressing
only by URI, but other forms of addressing may be required: Library of
Congress subject headings, astronomical coordinates, latitude and
longitude, etc.

Sam Hunting is the president of eTopicality, Inc., a consultancy whose
service offerings include topic maps, content analysis, and taxonomy and
DTD development. He was a founding member of TopicMaps.Org, which
developed the XML Topic Maps (XTM) specification. He is a co-author of
the XTM 1.0 DTD. He is the technical editor of _XML Topic Maps: Creating
and Maintaining Topic Maps for the Web_, from Addison-Wesley. He is a
co-founder of the GooseWorks project for creating open source topic map
tools (http:/www.gooseworks.org). He has been working with markup
technology for over 10 years. (http://www.etopicality.com)

David, feel free to contact me off-list regarding these topics since I
won't be at the meeting on the 19th (getting married the next day, woo hoo!)

Something else that I wanted to stress was the writing of the proposal.
If it is going to be an involved project as had been origially posted, a
well-written proposal can go a long way in communicating to the
potential client that you have a deep understanding of the project they
are asking you to bid on as well as justification for the price you have
delivered, especially if they find it on the high side. (is that a
run-on sentence or what?)

Strong proposals have won me more business than I've lost or not-won and
often when I've known that my price was 5-8 times more than what the
competition was quoting in a "proposal" that was a simple 1 page email.

Why? Because my proposals demonstrate that I have taken the time to
understanding the client's business and needs regarding the project,
have considered a myriad of possibilities for increased complexity and
taken into account the full development cycle. All of this helps to
assure them that you will have minimal cost overruns that you might have
to come back to them for later asking for more money.

Sometimes, I still don't win the job for whatever reason, and the effort
is all for naught (save the learning experience), but at least I know I
gave it the "old college try." (ok, i didn't go to college, who's counting?)

Then there is the whole topic of requirements and specifications, but
really, that is part of the development process.

Great. Nice to hear.

I'd be more than happy to offer my services in helping you price work
and/or the proposal process as well as req & spec.

It's best if you can contact companies before they make their opening known, and make the contact as personal as possible. Try using http://news.netcraft.com/ to find out what companies you're interested in are running (hey, I wouldn't mind working on The Yankees website, do they run PHP?), then hunt for leads there and approach them directly. Takes some work and guts, but may be more fruitful than responding with 100,000 others to ads.

I just moved here about three months ago, and I found the most opportunities
through craigslist.org.

One disappointing thing about the job market is the number of inexperienced
people who are doing the design and recruitment for large software projects. If
you want to be doing any serious programming, it is almost essential that you
find a technologically-savvy company. For example, mod_perl developers tend to
flock to Ticketmaster/CitySearch or Amazon. Serious PHP/MySQL developers
migrate toward Yahoo!. Python/C experts go for Google. Things like that. Google
happens to be hiring a lot of developers for their next-generation search
engine, and they are hiring them for their NYC office.

While it seems counterintuitive, I think the job market for advanced developers
is smaller than beginners, simply because the people hiring tend to only
understand that which is beneath them. It makes for a challenging situation if
you don't want to sacrifice your standards to find a job, but sometimes gainful
employment is more important. This decision is entirely up to you, of course,
but I recommend keeping your standards high. It will make you happier down the
road.

I held my ground when looking for a job and turned my head from the Microsoft
shops and Java-based financial institutions. While doing so limited my choices,
it actually helped me in the end, because my choices were all *good* choices.
If you lower your standards too much, you will find yourself trying to decide
between jobs that you don't want, and it is tough to pass up job offers (I had
to turn down three due to my strict time constraints) when everyone is telling
you how hard the job market is here.

So, there's some advice based on recent experience. Hope it helps.

Chris

Dear Listfolk,

I have a client that has registered about 30-40 domains. What are some
(easy/cheap) options for managing the DNS for these domains?

Some possiblities:
Widge.net:
  $2.45(!)/domain
  http://dns.widge.net/
easyDNS:
  $13/domain
  http://support.easydns.com/service/subscription.php3

What other options do I have? I'm no dummy, but not too experienced with zone
files, etc. I know what 'A' and 'CNAME' records are and generally how DNS
works, but I don't wanna hafta become a DNS wizard (unless it's easy!) to
manage my client's domains.

Thanks!

I'd highly recommend ZoneEdit, http://zoneedit.com.  They're a Manhattan company that provides perfect DNS services (and no, doing your own DNS is not fun).

I've never used them, but DynDNS seems to have a good reputation, and I think
they specialize in this sort of thing. Disclaimer: They bought me a lot of free
beer at OSCON. :-)

I can't save it as .csv as I don't have Excel (and w/o a working CD-ROM no
means of getting it installed either).  Since that's not an option what else
would you recommend?

OpenOffice? Gnumeric? Going to the public library and using one of
their computers? Kinkos?

Kinko's here is too expensive an option when you're unemployed, and the

Couldn't I just use PHP's COM objects to parse the Excel spreadsheet
instead?

I believe that in order for you to talk to a program using COM you
actually need to have that program on your computer. In any case, that
still seems like a heck of a lot harder than just downloading some
Office clone and exporting as CSV.

However, if you're determined to do this in PHP, this site may have
something that can help:

http://badblue.com/helpphpo.htm

Alternatively, you could download a demo version of this product and
use this function:

Phil,

I would recommend going with Adam's suggestion and downloading an Excel 
clone.

OpenOffice's Calc may be what you need to open the .xls and export as .csv.  
It's a hefty download but may be your best option.

http://www.openoffice.org/

Download for Windows
http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/1.1rc4/index.html#windows

I live 20 - 25 mins from every one of those libraries.  I'm in Virginia, not

I'll look into it as OpenOffice was apparently a bad option for me.  I
downloaded it but cannot install it (got the Windows version and setup.exe
does absolutely nothing)

Isn't there a free "non-pro" version of this? I saw it on the Web the other

Ok guys I give up.  I can't do this one at all.  Could literally someone do it for me?  The spreadsheet is at http://valsignalandet.com/fruit.xls

I have no ability to do this, OpenOffice won't install, and I have a job interview tomorrow and leave for Tampa on Thursday for a final interview.  Since the COM class only works for PHP in Windows, I can't use that either, so I'm out of options altogether.

AUGH!

As far as I know the foreign key constraints are only for "InnoDB" type
tables. The way you have listed your schema, it seems like you didn't
specify the type of the table. The default type is myISAM. 

I might be way off on this one :)

I cannot create the indices I need considering the schema structure I am

if it doesn't let you?

mySQL is starting to SUCK!!!!!!

As far as I know the foreign key constraints are only for "InnoDB" type
tables. The way you have listed your schema, it seems like you didn't
specify the type of the table. The default type is myISAM.

I might be way off on this one :)

http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/ANSI_diff_Foreign_Keys.html states "In MySQL
Server 3.23.44 and up, InnoDB tables support checking of foreign key
constraints, including CASCADE, ON DELETE, and ON UPDATE."

Looking at the schema you gave, you are not creating "innoDB" tables.

For example, you will need to change the first table definition from this:

create table if not exists nnet_produkt_varegruppe (  
	nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id int not null auto_increment,
	primary key(nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id),
      nnet_produkt_varegruppe_navn varchar(255) not null 
	);

To this:

create table if not exists nnet_produkt_varegruppe (  
	nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id int not null auto_increment,
	primary key(nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id),
      nnet_produkt_varegruppe_navn varchar(255) not null 
	)TYPE=INNODB;

When you leave off the "TYPE" in your table definition, mySQL assumes it to
be "TYPE=MYISAM", which doesn't support foreign keys.

More on table types: http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Table_types.html

Hope it helps :D

Let me preface it by saying I've done Oracle for almost 5 years... this is
brand new to me!!!

I checked using phpMySQLAdmin and InnoDB isn't given as a table type option
(only ISAM, Berkeley DB, Heap, myISAM and one other one I don't remember)..

You see, with Oracle, SQL Server and even Access, I've never had to specify
table type because I would always get - I guess - InnoDB and so foreign key
constraints were a normal part of table schema design..

In that case you'll have to do it manually, using the following query:

ALTER TABLE [table name] TYPE = INNODB;

What version of PMA you are running? I have 2.4.0 and it show all supported
types, including InnoDB. Perhaps your mysql is running with "--skip-innodb"
switch.

Latest one is 2.5.3. See if using that gives you the option. Of course
you'll have to install it first ;) http://www.phpmyadmin.net/

Install it.. where? This is on a remote server that is approximately 5000
miles away!  And I don't even have telnet, much less SSH access.

Oh, it's just a bunch of php files. Just edit the config file and dump 'em
all into a subdirectory of your account ( via FTP).

I tried to open it. Excel (I'm using the latest Office ver) says the
file is corrupted and can not be repaired. While the file does,
nonetheless, open up, there are some formulas that are not working. Not
sure if it is worth exporting if these calculations are missing.

Ok guys I give up.  I can't do this one at all.  Could literally someone
do it for me?  The spreadsheet is at http://valsignalandet.com/fruit.xls
 
I have no ability to do this, OpenOffice won't install, and I have a job

use that either, so I'm out of options altogether.

I concur on the file corruption.  On my system the spreadsheet won't even open, seems to think it is locked and won't even offer to open it read only.

I was able to open the file, but it is corrupted, and could not be
successfully repaired.  When I saved it as a csv file, I got a further
message that it may contain features (maybe macros?) that cannot be
saved into a csv file.  Anyway, if you want to see what it exported, it
is here:

I agree, CSV is the way to go.  If that is not an option, check out
phpclasses.org - there are some classes listed that do this, along with
other Excel-related things:

If you know a bit of perl, get the package to read xls files, and
just do a basic read and dump to csv, as other folks are talking about

I know your subject line says PHP, but you could <gasp /> use Perl, DBI,
DBI::Excel and DBI::mysql. I can show you a sample if you're interested.
Sorry if this is too sacrilegious (-:

I put a smiley in there after "Sorry if this is too sacrilegious", didn't
I? Let's try again:


<?php echo "Use Perl! ", str_repeat("(-: ",10000); ?>

Here ya go, Phil.

File was badly corrupted. So bad that Excel was unable to repair it, but
did manage to open it and produce the following...

http://38.117.145.89/fruit.csv


I'm not sure if that was the extent of the data or not.

2.    In the registrer.php the same sender appear BUT there I get all information.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Sneaking in unwanted characters
Message-ID: <006001c377d2$a41f7b70$6401a8c0@EZDSDELL>

My client doesn't want anyone who visits his website to enter an email
address like www.me at mydomain.com.
So, I have two checks to validate the email entered by the user. Each
check uses preg_match.

Here's the pattern used for the first match:
'/^[a-z0-9_.=+-]+@([a-z0-9-]+\.)+([a-z]{2,6})$/i',

Then the email goes through a second check: ( preg_match('/^www\./',
trim($_POST['email'])) ) 

Somehow someone managed to sneak through an email address with a www at
the beginning and I'm a bit puzzled as to how they managed to do it. Is
it possible that they entered some sort of non-printable character, like
a character with an ASCII value less than 33, which would foil the data
check? Or is it something obvious that I'm overlooking?

Phil,

Have you considered reading the online PHP manual for the functions you
are experiencing difficulty with?

This "problem" is quite easily solved in the first user comment on this
page:
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.mail.php

Without looking at your code, I am going to tell you that you need to
set the message headers.

The online PHP manual is great. I have never read a PHP book and don't
think I'll ever need to (sorry to you PHP book authors out there) and I
have no formal programming education (I'm a natural, what can I say?)

without asking why someone's email can't start with "www"... shouldn't
the www in the second check be in parenthesis?

 preg_match('/^(www\.)/', trim($_POST['email'])) ) 

maybe I'm wrong,, regular expressions get so confusing...

alternately, and probably slower, you could just check for a match in
the first 4 chars

if (substr(trim($_POST['email']), 0, 4) == "www.") 

very brute, but very clear :)

What is the e-mail address they snuck through? You probably want to escape
the . in the character class before the @ in the first regex -- otherwise
you're matching ^.+@

Separately, why does your client want to do this? www.me at mydomain.com is a
perfectly valid e-mail address.

/^www\./ and /^(www\.)/ match identically. The only difference is that the
one with the parentheses captures the enclosed text for later use, if you
want it.

Actually, this is faster. And better style, IMHO. If you are using a regex
with no metacharacters (like ^www\.), you should use the string functions
instead.

Others have mentioned this, but that is a perfectly valid email address. Maybe
instead of spending time writing a regex to exclude some special case, you
should take the time to make sure your client understands what an email address
is. Is there a valid reason to exclude some email addresses and not others?
Why? Don't hesitate to question a client.

As a consultant, I would consider it my responsibility to do so.

Although it is true that it is "technically" a valid address, in reality, it
is an incorrect one.  I see this all the time, in data that I receive from
my clients, and even in printed material from companies.  And I can't tell
you how many times these addresses have bounced back (I too was once from
the school of "try it, may it REALLY IS their address").  Something needs to
be done to ensure that the customers type in valid email addresses, and this
is what this fellow's client came up with.  As we have all noticed, it is
not fool-proof.

Perhaps I would suggest a 2nd textbox to confirm that the user typed the
address in correctly, and perhaps even a confirmation link in an email to
that address, to prove a customer actually receives email at that address.
But, I suspect that this doesn't happen often enough to justify those
programming changes, so I would just go with removing the beginning 'www.'
as well.  Or, perhaps some other scrubbing mechanism somewhere else in the
chain (perhaps when the email addresses are exported, etc.).  The solution
has to fit the problem, and I would be very interested to see the "big
contract" that is sent from the address "www.someexecutive at bigcompany.com".

Good Luck!

Tom

Others have mentioned this, but that is a perfectly valid email address.
Maybe
instead of spending time writing a regex to exclude some special case, you
should take the time to make sure your client understands what an email
address
is. Is there a valid reason to exclude some email addresses and not others?
Why? Don't hesitate to question a client.

As a consultant, I would consider it my responsibility to do so.

The online PHP manual did not help me with this one.. turns out it was
sending it twice, from $email and from nobody at itpays.no.  No offense to you
or to the PHP online manual, but sometimes nothing helps except a miracle.

So...substr is the way to go...or at least try.

/^www\./ and /^(www\.)/ match identically. The only difference is that
the
one with the parentheses captures the enclosed text for later use, if
you
want it.

Actually, this is faster. And better style, IMHO. If you are using a
regex
with no metacharacters (like ^www\.), you should use the string
functions
instead.

To answer the second question first, when an email comes through my
client's website it gets sent to a lot of people and the email address
goes into the body of the email. Outlook interprets me at mydomain.com as
an email address but if it says www.me at mydomain.com it treats it as a
URL. Hence the client request to eliminate addresses with "www." 

The email address they snuck through was www.RMujanovic at aol.com. 

I'll see if escaping the period (.) helps but...I still wonder how they
did it?

What is the e-mail address they snuck through? You probably want to
escape
the . in the character class before the @ in the first regex --
otherwise
you're matching ^.+@

Separately, why does your client want to do this? www.me at mydomain.com is
a
perfectly valid e-mail address.

I gotta agree with Chris on this one - one of the reasons the client is
paying you is for your experience and expertise in the field.  Sometimes you
just gotta say no to a client, and hit them over the nose with a rolled-up
newspaper.

Well...as noted in the "Validate Email" section of this page -
http://www.phphelp.com/start - 
"The most comprehensive regular expression currently available for
testing if an email address is valid was published in Mastering Regular
Expressions from O'Reilly Publishing. It appears on page 316 and weighs
in at more than six thousand characters...."

I'm sure there's a better way.

Although it is true that it is "technically" a valid address, in

chain (perhaps when the email addresses are exported, etc.).  The
solution
has to fit the problem, and I would be very interested to see the "big
contract" that is sent from the address
"www.someexecutive at bigcompany.com".

Good Luck!

Others have mentioned this, but that is a perfectly valid email address.
Maybe
instead of spending time writing a regex to exclude some special case,
you
should take the time to make sure your client understands what an email
address
is. Is there a valid reason to exclude some email addresses and not
others?
Why? Don't hesitate to question a client.

As a consultant, I would consider it my responsibility to do so.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Simple parse/replace
Message-ID: <2ADC7BED20C3D711BFF100508B8FA3E307FBA8@webproxy.uat.dbinsight.com>

Hey all:

I have cobbled together a simple changelog system for the web folks here at
work, using php and some flat text files. The script simply concatenates the
fields, with \t characters in between each variable, into a file for that
particular server. The format looks roughly like this:

$timestamp\t$modby\t$files\t$notes\n
for example:
9/10/2003, 5:41 PM	Robert D.	changelog/add.php	Got basic
Changelog service up and running.
(Those are tabs between each field)

There's also a simple viewing page which (you guessed it) lets you view the
file.

What I want to do is output it in a nice table, with the tabs replaced with
table cells. How would I parse it as such? Bear in mind that the text files
must remain tab-delimited, so as not to boff up an analysis script, so I
can't output table data into the text file (nor would I want to, if I could;
that is far too kludgy).

Cheers

Most of the RFCs either have example regular expressions or a very specific
grammar that can be used to build one. I've seen that one in the back of the
O'Reilly book, and my instinct tells me it shouldn't have to be that
complicated. :-)

This could be one of those areas where I'm not entirely clear on Unix 
philosophy, but I think of /var as being for data of a more transient 
nature, and subject to overwrite on OS upgrade. Also, most distros don't 
give /var much space by default. I consider /home and /usr/local as 
safer places for long-term storage.

I generally put virtual host webroots in /home/domain/http for 
single-site domains, or /home/orgname/domain/http for organizations with 
multiple domains.

The full valid e-mail spec is really nasty, cause you can have
comments inside the address and other weird things. Here is the regex
from PHP Cookbook that allows most real-world addresses, but not
everything that's okay:

/
    ^               # anchor at the beginning
    [^@\s]+         # name is all characters except @ and whitespace
    @               # the @ divides name and domain
    (
        [-a-z0-9]+  # (sub)domains are letters, numbers, and hyphens
        \.          # separated by a period
    )+              # and we can have one or more of them
    (
        [a-z]{2}    # TLDs can be a two-letter alphabetical country
    code
        |com|net    # or one of 
        |edu|org    # many 
        |gov|mil    # possible
        |int|biz    # three-letter
        |pro        # combinations
        |info|arpa  # or even
        |aero|coop  # a few 
        |name       # four-letter ones
        |museum     # plus one that's six-letters long!
    )
    $               # anchor at the end
/ix                 # and everything is case-insensitive

This should be enough to get you started:

$fp = fopen('foo.tab', 'r');
print "<table>\n";
while ($line = fgetcsv($fp, 1000, "\t")) {
  print "  <tr>\n    <td>";
  print join("</td>\n    <td>", $line);
  print "</td>\n  </tr>\n";
}
print "</table>\n";
fclose($fp);

Phil,

You need to learn some basics of working with SQL.  In MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and just about everything else, values should always be enclosed in single quotes [1].

With the SQL you show above, none of the values are enclosed in single quotes, and since one of the values contains a single quote itself, it gives an error.  You'll also need to use mysql_escape_string() for every value you create a SQL statement from; this escapes special chars that SQL will interpret as having meaning.  See http://php.net/mysql_escape_string

I think you might have to move to a pay-per-incident support plan  :)

But this is a simple problem to resolve; you should have no problem with it.

Yes; with RFC2822 they really managed to add a lot of unneeded complexity.  Ahhh, acadamentia.

http://cvs.nyphp.org/cvsweb.cgi/pmail/pmail.inc?rev=1.5&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup

Some functions in there may help as well.

yes, everything

if the string being enclosed in single quotes contains an apostrophe, or
other instance of a single quote, it will need to be escaped like \'

I think that Hans is recommending using mysql_escape_string() to ensure
that everything is escaped that might need it (like double quotes).


HOWEVER

if your php script is attempting to insert any variables, you will need
to use double quotes in place of the single quote as the encapsulator.

PHP doesn't parse within the single quote.

You would still want to use mysql_escape_string()


I always use double quotes even though it means that values are being
parsed for no reason. It's just easier for me that way and I haven't
(been fortunate enough to have) had a problem with it creating excessive
load, yet.

Agreed...six thousand characters to check an email address seems
excessive.

Most of the RFCs either have example regular expressions or a very
specific
grammar that can be used to build one. I've seen that one in the back of
the
O'Reilly book, and my instinct tells me it shouldn't have to be that
complicated. :-)

The directory /var/www/html as the Apache document root seems to be the
default location when installing Red Hat. Found this on Google:

http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.1-Manual/ref-guide/s1-ins

"In the version of Apache included in Red Hat Linux 7.1, the
DocumentRoot is /var/www/html. "

I recently installed Red Hat 9 and this is still the default
DocumentRoot directory. Sure...you could make DocumentRoot just about
any directory you want as long as you change the httpd.conf file.

This could be one of those areas where I'm not entirely clear on Unix 
philosophy, but I think of /var as being for data of a more transient 
nature, and subject to overwrite on OS upgrade. Also, most distros don't

give /var much space by default. I consider /home and /usr/local as 
safer places for long-term storage.

I generally put virtual host webroots in /home/domain/http for 
single-site domains, or /home/orgname/domain/http for organizations with

multiple domains.

You posted the actual address later on in the thread.  What happens if you 
put in that email address yourself?  Does it get through?

If so, then there's definitely a flaw in the code.  Perhaps the variable 
being checked isn't the same as the one that gets used.

If not, maybe there's some other older version of the scripts laying 
around that the person in question used.

Not sure about Ensim or anything else, but servers running Cpanel/WHM
control panels usually have /home/USERNAME as the document root for a user.
I'm pretty sure that quite a lot of virtual hosting providers use a separate
drive/partition for user data, such as /home.

That's my experience too...but as pointed out in the article (and
perhaps it needs to be made clearer) the actual path could be whatever
works for you.

Message-ID: <001f01c378a9$b7174eb0$6501a8c0@palacenew>

Ok, somehow my windows machine was compromised and started to send out a dos
attack against an irc server (so i was told). I do keep up with the patches
and I run windows 2000 server. I do not run IIS. I also run norton antivuris
corporate and have come up with nothing. I could not find anything with a
trojan horse cleaner nor could I detect if I was compromised.

Does anyone have any way of determining if I was compromised? Any utilities
I could use to check this out without the hassle of a rebuild of the entire
machine. I would like to avoid rebuilding but what other choice do I have if
I cannot determine the cause of the intrusion and the extend of the damage.
(as of now I can see no damage).

even tho the errors are reporting an error with line 2, which would be
the $retStat = session_start(); line, make sure that there is NOTHING
above the opening <?php tag
no line, breaks, no spaces, nada, zip

I've never actually tried tying session_start() to a var. I usually just
stick it in there...

otherwise, it looks to me like php is trying to find the /tmp dir, which
is typical Un*x/linux, but the other file paths appear to be windows
file structure.

/tmp would be at the root of the filesystem, not a subdir of anything.

Is this a new server? Perhaps the configuration was wrong at install?
I think you can change the path to the tmp dir that sessions are stored
in via the php.ini file, but I'd have to look it up to be certain.

sounds like you're on the right track, perhaps if you set your
session.save_path in php.ini to an actual directory on your C drive, that'll
fix things up...ie, session.save_path="c:/tmp" (making sure c:/tmp exists,
of course)

Brian & Christopher...

Thanks so much for your help. I had never configured session.save_path when I installed PHP.

  sounds like you're on the right track, perhaps if you set your session.save_path in php.ini to an actual directory on your C drive, that'll fix things up...ie, session.save_path="c:/tmp" (making sure c:/tmp exists, of course)

    When I execute the following code:

Right now I'm using the following code to get the value of $action, since
I'm either mixing GET/POST within my project OR am not sure about how the
template will be setup ( yet ).

$action = (empty($_POST['action'])) ? $_GET['action'] : "";

Is there another way of acomplishing the same thing?

$_REQUEST['action']

or, you can turn on register_globals and access it as $action, but I
wouldn't advise it. Using the $_REQUEST array is good.

Be aware of the "security" implications, however, that someone could
override intended $_POST vars by appending to the query string.

Also note that you can dynamically add to the $_REQUEST array, but those
values will not be available in $_POST or $_GET

Thanks all,

BUT nothing is working. I have also increased memory limit upto 20MB, and
tried all of your's suggestions, but still result is 0. While testing this
script on Netscape and other browser same error occures except message is
different that "Document contains no data".

Looks like it needs huge amount of memory resources as finally over 15 MB
PDF document is to be created by that script. Perhaps Apache or Php is not
able to handle this much amount of data in memory. Any other suggestions
will be welcomed.

Thanks

Start by modify your program to run from the command line (take the
arguments via argv, and write the output to disk). This will allow you to
do some profiling and find out what execution time and resources usage are.

If you can't optimize it, you will have to fork it: When the user calls
your script, you execute your pdf-generator program in the background via
"exec" and just echo a message that the "pdf is being generated" and some
javascript that after some few seconds will change the location to a second
php page.
This second page will check if the pdf generator has already created the
file, and if it has it will serve it, otherwise it will wait for another 10
seconds before reloading.

The whole thing is not hard to implement, but be careful about the little
details and security validation in each of the steps.

Anirudh,

If you try this with a "small" PDF (like 1 page, light graphics), do you
still have the same results?

Thanks,

Think the problem was solved. However, the easiest way to solve it is to
create "tmp" directory in your "C:" drive. C:\tmp  maps to /tmp

Hey y'all.

Today I'm looking for recommendations for something that I guess they call
a Content Management System, a thing that will allow clients themselves to
edit their own HTML pages (or Smarty templates as the case may be) so I
don't have to do it, and without them having to have a shell or FTP
account on the shared server where their sites live -- i.e.,
browser-based. They should be able to upload, download, move/copy/delete
files and directories, and edit things in place as well (if they're
fearless and foolish like... some people).

If it's something that runs as me (as I imagine it will have to), then it
should also feature activity logging so we'll know whom to point the
finger at when something gets broken.

Setup should be reasonably easy, the appearance should be easy to
customize and it should cost, oh, I don't know, how about US$0.00 ?

I've read a little about PostNuke and it seems like a 250-pound Swiss army
knife -- but if it's just monsterously fabulous, OK I'll take it.

I'm doing some homework at
http://www.thefreecountry.com/php/contentmanagement.shtml but I thought
I'd ask here as well.

Thanks.

I've been happy with: http://www.webedpro.com/ (no affiliation) - but I
don't think it offers logging, and only works on IE5.5+/PC

I'm not kidding, the only reason yesterday you didn't hear from me was because I wasn't coding, but today I am doing something quick, and yes, as always it failed.. right at the SQL statement:


   $sql = 'SELECT v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_navn, ' .
          '       f.nnet_produkt_farge_navn, ' .
          '       s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_navn, ' .
          '       k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_navn, ' .
          '       p.* ' .
          'FROM nnet_produkt p, nnet_produkt_varegruppe v, ' .
          '     nnet_produkt_kvalitet k, nnet_produkt_storrelse s ' .
          'WHERE p.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code = v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code ' .

          ' AND p.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id (+) = k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id';

I am getting "invalid SQL near (+).  That is totally VALID SQL syntax for an outer join!  If mySQL doesn't allow for that, what am I supposed to do in lieu of the fact that I have to logically join two tables together or if the one is null (the case for an outer join)?

Phil, the (+) is only valid for joins in the Oracle dialect of SQL

I'm sure there are many virus and trojan detection system available for Windows (after all, it's had it's practice :) but Norton should take care of it.  Are you sure Norton's virus definition files are updated?

Before I jump through hoops, however, I'd make them prove that there was a DoS from your box.  People, especially those involved with IRC, are often quick to jump to conclusions.  Put the ball in their court, first.

(+)= is not valid ANSI SQL, it's Oracle SQL you need to use join syntax.

   $sql = 'SELECT v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_navn, ' .
          '       f.nnet_produkt_farge_navn, ' .
          '       s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_navn, ' .
          '       k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_navn, ' .
          '       p.* ' .
          'FROM nnet_produkt p ' .
          '  JOIN nnet_produkt_varegruppe v ON p.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code = v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code ' .
          '  JOIN whatevertable_is_f f ON p.nnet_produkt_farge_code = f.nnet_produkt_farge_code ' .
          '  LEFT JOIN nnet_produkt_storrelse s ON p.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id = s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id ' .
          '  LEFT JOIN nnet_produkt_kvalitet k ON p.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id = k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id '

I Forget the Oracle syntax so if this is suppose to be a right join, just replace LEFT with RIGHT.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Pear: Mail Mime / Mail
Message-ID: <BB87CD6A.FE13%stephen@musgrave.org>

    
Hello all - 

Thank you to those who recommending using Pear's Mail Mime to overcome my
multi-part email issues.. it works like a charm.

However...

.. I want to use it in SMTP mode so that if a recipient is unreachable, the
bounces goes back to the sender, not the postmaster.  When I make the call
to factory() in SMTP mode and send the email, I notice that the "to" field
comes up blank when I receive the email.  (The "To" field is nonexistent in
my mail reader.)  I was getting the 'To' field just fine when the factory()
call was in default mode (mail).

Anybody have any ideas?

Thanks,


Stephen Musgrave

I would like to know about the process of installing PHP and MySQL on a
Mac. Would the Mac OS have to be OS X (to take advantage of Free BSD)?
Would it be similar to installing it on Free BSD (or Linux)? Does Mac OS X
already come with Apache loaded and configured to serve pages through
"localhost"?

Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] installing PHP/MySQL on a Mac
Message-ID: <BAY2-F145Z7hq5ynHFm00008f71@hotmail.com>

Peter,

You could compile from source as on any other Unix variant, but if you want 
to take advantage of Mac OS X's GUI to manage servers, Server Logistics (no 
affiliation) lets you do so through the System Preferences panel with their 
free precompiled binaries.

They're pretty quick to update PHP, Apache, MySQL, and Tomcat when new 
releases come out.

http://serverlogistics.com/software.php
+ Complete MySQL
+ Complete Apache 2
+ Complete PHP
+ Complete Jakarta Tomcat

Jon,

The contractor-oriented dotcom I used to work for had a relationship with HQ 
Global Workplaces.  They seem to still be in business, although they might 
be overkill for your needs.

http://hq.com/
http://hq.com/products/?id=25&section=IP

If you want open space and an open LAN, you could just go to Bryant Park 
and/or the NYPL with a wireless card though.  :)

It is identical to installing it on another other Unix variant, assuming you
compile your own Apache, MySQL, PHP, OpenSSL, and mod_ssl as I do.

If you don't, you can just use the Apache that comes with Mac OS X, or you can
use fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net/). Fink allows you to install/update any
software just as easily as you would on a Debian box (using apt-get), and it's
really solid. I use it for everything that I'm not picky about (I'm picky about
my AMP configuration).

Hope that helps.

Chris

The article on virtual hosting has been heavily revised. Please review
it for accuracy and clarity (admittedly...you can only go so far in
explaining things but make sure that all the important points have been
addressed). 

This version, 1.2, contains a number of changes based on comments from
list members. If there is anyone who had contributed a comment and did
not receive a "credit" at the bottom of the article...please let me
know.

  (+)= is not valid ANSI SQL, it's Oracle SQL you need to use join syntax.

     $sql = 'SELECT v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_navn, ' .
            '       f.nnet_produkt_farge_navn, ' .
            '       s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_navn, ' .
            '       k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_navn, ' .
            '       p.* ' .
            'FROM nnet_produkt p ' .
            '  JOIN nnet_produkt_varegruppe v ON p.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code = v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code ' .
            '  JOIN whatevertable_is_f f ON p.nnet_produkt_farge_code = f.nnet_produkt_farge_code ' .
            '  LEFT JOIN nnet_produkt_storrelse s ON p.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id = s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id ' .
            '  LEFT JOIN nnet_produkt_kvalitet k ON p.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id = k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id '

  I Forget the Oracle syntax so if this is suppose to be a right join, just replace LEFT with RIGHT.

    I'm not kidding, the only reason yesterday you didn't hear from me was because I wasn't coding, but today I am doing something quick, and yes, as always it failed.. right at the SQL statement:


       $sql = 'SELECT v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_navn, ' .
              '       f.nnet_produkt_farge_navn, ' .
              '       s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_navn, ' .
              '       k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_navn, ' .
              '       p.* ' .
              'FROM nnet_produkt p, nnet_produkt_varegruppe v, ' .
              '     nnet_produkt_kvalitet k, nnet_produkt_storrelse s ' .
              'WHERE p.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code = v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code ' .
              ' AND p.nnet_produkt_farge_code = f.nnet_produkt_farge_code ' .
              ' AND p.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id (+) = s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id ' .
              ' AND p.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id (+) = k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id';

    I am getting "invalid SQL near (+).  That is totally VALID SQL syntax for an outer join!  If mySQL doesn't allow for that, what am I supposed to do in lieu of the fact that I have to logically join two tables together or if the one is null (the case for an outer join)?

Ok, well, I am using OUTER JOINs in my syntax and it all broke apart until I
combined what I learned in mySQL what what I've always understood INNER JOIN
syntax to be:

    $sql = 'SELECT v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_navn, ' .
          '       f.nnet_produkt_farge_navn, ' .
          '       s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_navn, ' .
          '       k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_navn, ' .
          '       p.* ' .
          'FROM nnet_produkt p, nnet_produkt_farge f,
nnet_produkt_varegruppe v ' .
          ' LEFT JOIN nnet_produkt_storrelse s ON
p.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id = s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id ' .
          ' LEFT JOIN nnet_produkt_kvalitet k ON p.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id
= k.nnet_produkt_kvalitet_id ' .
          'WHERE v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code =
p.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code ' .
          ' AND f.nnet_produkt_farge_code = p.nnet_produkt_farge_code ';

Unorthodox but it doesn't break.

I can't understand what your URL refers to! It's talking about SELECT
statements, and I need to know about how it does outer joins (not straight
joins, whatever those are)

Looks great Jeff.  It's been suggested that an appendix be added that covers Windows on the server side as well.  I have little experience on this side of things, but maybe someone could contribute some notes, and we'll get them commited into the final version.

Thanks,

Just to offer more advice, here is a link that does a Google search for mysql
join syntax:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=mysql+join+syntax&btnG=Google+Search

I'm not sure what "online notes" you were using, but you should try Google next
time.

Yep already went to that link and found some info on mysql.com on the way
they do outer joins, the syntax is truly bizarre (I'm an Oracle guy)

Tom,

No, problem doesn't occur in small pdf, script can generate file upto 2-3 MB
of size that includes images and data. So Problem arise only when it is
required to have PDF above 3 MB. During this process my script also
interacts with Perl script that manipulates my images and php script uses
those images in generating PDF. Hence 2 scripts working together.

Thanks

Anirudh Zala

We're at the final version for the article on virtual hosting

the question has come up concerning doing virtual hosting on a Windows

So.......we're looking for volunteers to write this piece of the

There is still a tight connection between the original document root and the
virtual host document roots. Quote:
"Therefore, different projects will be in their own subdirectories under
/var/www/html"

This may be misleading and inaccurate. VirtualHost 1 can have a document
root: /home/var/www and VirtualHost 2 can have a document root:
/var/dev/site. Projects or Virtual Hosts are not necessarily sub directories
of the original document root.

Windows Apache has the same httpd.conf and therefore there is not
difference.

If it doesn't occur in a smaller PDF, then your code probably isn't the
problem, but one of those php.ini settings is.  Raise the memory limit to a
large number (like 50MB) and see if it works at all.  If you are on Unix,
you can use top to monitor how much memory and CPU that httpd thread is
actually using.

I think he was asking for someone to outline these facts in a quick appendix text.  Just with a couple examples so people can see the path differences, and any tips when working under Windows vs UNIX (for instance, I always hear the different slashes are a problem).

Thanks  :)

'/^[ a-z0-9-_]+(.[

I would go with {2,4} at the end of your expression because there are some
domains like .info that have 4 characters.

This regex is too broad. You need to escape the periods in the regex so they
match just ".", not any character. You allow usernames that begin with "
" -- do you really want that? The regex also allows domain names that begin
with "-", e.g. foo at -bar.com, which are not valid. Some mail servers allow
individual users to create aliases by appending their username with a "+",
i.e. "foo+list at bar.com", "foo+shop at bar.com" -- your regex does not allow +
signs in usernames.

I know this has come up on the list before, but I'll put in a recommendation
for using the techniques discussed in Recipe 13.5 in PHP Cookbook. There are
two regexes there and some other techniques for verifying addresses, along
with the plusses and minuses of each. If you don't own a copy of PHP
Cookbook (why not?!:) you can download the example code from
http://examples.oreilly.com/phpckbk/phpcbbk_examples.zip

Correct me if I am wrong but won't ([[:alnum:]]|_|\.|-)+ match things like name.._ at domain.com or . at domain.com?  I don't think this regexp requires letters first and lets you have multiple .'s in a row.

Hi Jeff:

The original expression in the prior thread works (barring it'll allow 
addresses starting with punctuation).

So, I'm guessing you haven't tracked down what's going on with the www. 
email addresses.  You didn't reply to my email in that thread dated 9/11.  
Guess you didn't see it...

You posted the actual address later on in the thread.  What happens if you      
put in that email address yourself?  Does it get through?

If so, then there's definitely a flaw in the code.  Perhaps the variable
being checked isn't the same as the one that gets used.

If not, maybe there's some other older version of the scripts laying
around that the person in question used.

Message-ID: <02fa01c37bac$7cddae00$332c0242@peter1>

Hi,
I have PEAR and DB installed on my Windows 98 box and I get an error message when trying to use the
DB/mysql.php function db_connect:

include_once("DB/mysql.php");
$dbh = db_connect(array($db_host,$db_user,$db_password));
if (!$dbh) {
 die("Cannot connect to database");
}

The error message is:

Fatal error: Class db_common: Cannot inherit from undefined class pear in C:\php\pear\DB-1.3\DB\common.php on line 29

I checked line 29 of common.php and there is:

"class DB_common extends PEAR"


Does anyone know what the problem could be? I have installed PEAR-1.0 and DB-1. Both are installed in the directory 
C:\PHP\pear


Yours,

Peter Lehrer

This regex is too broad. You need to escape the periods in the regex so
they
match just ".", not any character. You allow usernames that begin with "
" -- do you really want that? The regex also allows domain names that
begin
with "-", e.g. foo at -bar.com, which are not valid. Some mail servers
allow
individual users to create aliases by appending their username with a
"+",
i.e. "foo+list at bar.com", "foo+shop at bar.com" -- your regex does not allow
+
signs in usernames.

I know this has come up on the list before, but I'll put in a
recommendation
for using the techniques discussed in Recipe 13.5 in PHP Cookbook. There
are
two regexes there and some other techniques for verifying addresses,
along
with the plusses and minuses of each. If you don't own a copy of PHP
Cookbook (why not?!:) you can download the example code from
http://examples.oreilly.com/phpckbk/phpcbbk_examples.zip

The error message says it all.  Line 29 is creating a new class that 
extends a class named PEAR.  Unfortunately, the class named pear could not 
be found.  It's kind of hard to extend something that can't be found, so 
PHP says so and stops.

Now, the question is WHY the PEAR class can't be found.  I'd guess your 
include path doesn't match your installation.  Or, perhaps, you botched 
your installation all together.

You might want to check out eZ publish- www.ez.no .  It is a full-featured CMS and web-application framework. It is based on templates and has a modular design which can be extended to fit any web application.

Hey y'all.

Today I'm looking for recommendations for something that I guess they call
a Content Management System, a thing that will allow clients themselves to
edit their own HTML pages (or Smarty templates as the case may be) so I
don't have to do it, and without them having to have a shell or FTP
account on the shared server where their sites live -- i.e.,
browser-based. They should be able to upload, download, move/copy/delete
files and directories, and edit things in place as well (if they're
fearless and foolish like... some people).

If it's something that runs as me (as I imagine it will have to), then it
should also feature activity logging so we'll know whom to point the
finger at when something gets broken.

Setup should be reasonably easy, the appearance should be easy to
customize and it should cost, oh, I don't know, how about US$0.00 ?

I've read a little about PostNuke and it seems like a 250-pound Swiss army
knife -- but if it's just monsterously fabulous, OK I'll take it.

I'm doing some homework at
http://www.thefreecountry.com/php/contentmanagement.shtml but I thought
I'd ask here as well.

I got it to work by including PEAR.php. That was the problem. Sorry about
the HTML.

Thanks,

This is the result of a broken mailer at tzo.com that is ignoring 
Mailman's "Errors-to:" header and sending undeliverable messages to the 
original sender instead.

We should probably be bombarding postmaster at tzo.com with requests to fix 
their mailer so that it does the right thing when mailing-list messages 
bounce.

Hey all,

Since last month's presentation was on XML validation and parsing, I 
wanted to contribute my own .02 to our knowledge base. I have been 
using PHP to do XSLT transformations and made a short "how to" that 
covers compiling PHP with the XSLT extension and also the basic code 
for doing an XSLT transformation in PHP. It is written at avery novice 
level since I am a novice myself, but hopefully someone on here might 
find it useful.

Yes, Zend Studio is excellent (with a great debugger) but it's way too
expensive for the struggling web designer with no money flow to buy. I =
used
the 3 week trial and got very used to it.

Now, I'm using Homesite5 and TopStyle 3 (combination CSS editor and

Homesite).

Message-ID: <49A9DEB886049242BA28C484A36C03F141F5DD@email.sprout.net>

Hi guys, thanks in advance for helping.

I am having strange issues with a Linux server running Apache. I can send emails from the command line using the mail command but when I try sending it from PHP it goes nowhere. I also don't get any errors neither on the Apache log file nor on the screen. My php.ini is set to give all errors and warnings and the mail is pointing to the correct directory where sendmail is, actually using the default path set by PHP.

These are some of the formats I tried in the php file:

mail("email at sprout.net","nothing at all","jkh kjhg kjygj kjhgkjhty kjhg kjh");

mail("email at sprout.net","nothing at all","jkh kjhg kjygj kjhgkjhty kjhg kjh", "From: carlos at sprout.net\r\n"."Reply-To: carlos at sprout.net<carlos at sprout.net>\r\n");

mail("email at sprout.net","nothing at all","jkh kjhg kjygj kjhgkjhty kjhg kjh", "From: carlos at sprout.net\r\n"."Reply-To: carlos at sprout.net<carlos at sprout.net>\r\n","-f cc at sprout.net");


Any ideas why the mail from PHP may not be going out? 

Thanks a lot,
Carlos

A couple things to try:

--- tail -f /var/log/maillog and see if there are any errors indicated while trying to send from Apache, versus the mail command line tool

--- can Apache (assuming you're running PHP as mod_php) execute the required sendmail, etc binaries?  Does it have the permissions?  su to the user Apache is running as and try the mail command again

--- in the php.ini are the settings correct?  I think the default is /usr/sbin/sendmail, which much exist and be executeable/readable by apache

Thanks Hans, 

Doing the tail -f does not give me anything when sending through PHP.
I am not able to su to apache, "user not available" have to wait for my linux guy to help me in that one.
And the php.ini settings do seem correct

[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
;SMTP = localhost

; For Win32 only.
;sendmail_from = me at localhost.com

; For Unix only.  You may supply arguments as well (default: "sendmail -t -i").
sendmail_path = '/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i'


Will have to try to su when he gets in today.

Thanks,
Carlos

Hi Peter:

> I got it to work by including PEAR.php.

I had a feeling you were calling the DB class incorrectly (and you still
are).  I didn't say anything about it in my last message because I didn't
have an example at my finger tips to show you.  Now I do...

All you need to to is include DB.php, set the DSN and then connect.  The 
database type used is determined by the DSN.

    require_once('DB.php');
    $DSN = 'DB_Type://DB_User:DB_Pass at DB_Protocol+DB_Host:DB_Port/DB_Db';
    $Options['debug'] = 2;

    $db = DB::connect($DSN, $Options);
    if ( DB::isError($db) ) {
        $killProcess('Having problems connecting to the database: '
                . $db->getMessage() );
    }

Enjoy,

Carlos:
"apache" is probably not the name of the user who runs Apache.  In my
experience, it's usually the user "nobody".

If you can send maill from the command line then you probably need to set up your php.ini
You can set it up to sendmail or SMTP as long as you know the name of you mail server or SMTP server

I ran into the problem in a Mac OS X and send mail would not work althought,
I could send mail from the command line so I changed it to SMTP and it work.

Thanks, I also can't su to "nobody". Now in the trusted-users under mail "apache" is the only one trusted. So I guess that would be the only one allowed? But I can email from root with no problems, via promt.

Actually that is what I originally wanted to do use my SMTP server. How did you change it in the php.ini ?

Ok problem solved thanks to Nestor. Now is this a BUG?

This is part of my ini in the Linux box

[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
SMTP = email.sprout.net

; For Win32 only.
;sendmail_from = me at localhost.com

; For Unix only.  You may supply arguments as well (default: "sendmail -t -i").
; sendmail_path = '/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i'

And now it works fine. It is being directed to an Exchange server. Is this why SMTP works? Why does it say for Win32 only?

If I uncomment "sendmail_path" the emails are not sent!!! So in theory is RELAYING to my mail server directly? Not at all, if I turn of the service for "sendmail" it also does not send the emails, but they do stay in que and when restarted they go out.

I could not find any notes on this issue, and I am sure I am not the only one running PHP 4.3.2 sending mail through a Linux box.

Thanks to all for the help, and hope this notes will help someone in the future. But actually hope they don't go through this.

Carlos

Message-ID: <00a201c37ca8$a35ae960$de01a8c0@duron.lan.newageweb.com>


Does anybody know of any good complete web store code with support for the
Linkpoint merchant API?  I usually code my own stuff but I simply don't have
enough time to "reinvent the wheel" this time ... and the deadline for this
assignment is right around the corner. This client needs an advanced web
store with all the bells and whistles, especially for shipping (real-time
interaction with FedEx or UPS would be nice), shopper accounts, advanced
order processing, inventory management and report creation.  He already has
a Linkpoint merchant account, so it would be nice if I could find a ready
solution with support for Linkpoint API.  Your suggestions are really
appreciated.

Cheers,
Jerry

OSCommerce has most of what you're looking for.  There is a Linkpoint API
module in the contributions that uses the PHP Wrapper from Linkpoint (now free,
used to be $95 from them).  There are also shipping modules for the real-time
shipping calculations...

http://oscommerce.com/

PS. Don't bother using the Linkpoint Basic integration module ... there is
potential for user error to foul up an order and thats not good.

I've personally only ever heard great results with OSC
And that's from everyone I've talked to who uses it.
(used all over the world)

> say a tunneled p'keyd mysql connection ...

Yes .. Because the database system on your server can be set to
ip/domain only access
Therefore assuming that your remote location has access to the port
mysql runs on
(firewall issue prevention)

Any other questions?

You have to be very aware of versions of OS Commerce & contributions, some
contributions are modules/plugins and some are patches/hacks.  You'll have to
be carefull of matching versions for your modules and patches and then be extra
careful not to overwrite your own customizations w/ patches.  Before you plunge
into adding in some contribution, RTFM fully and understand just what kind of
contribution it is and what you're getting yourself into.

The reason for this is that some parts of OS Commerce were made  to allow for
modules (shipping, payment, taxation, etc) ... while some were not (product
fields, non-product content, etc).  Keep in mind that this also affects your
own modifications to it... some things were designed to be easily modified,
while others were not.

Shouldn't be a problem at all.  The admin and the store are basically two
entirely separate apps, with separate config files and all, so piping the mysql
connection for the admin over a tunnel should be easy.

Use a POSIX named character class. These respect locale settings:

preg_match('/[[:alnum:]]/','?');

This returns true under a locale like 'en_US', or 'de_DE'.

Read all about POSIX named character classes in the egrep(1) manpage.

You should probably call setlocale() in your PHP script before
preg_match()ing against special characters, the default locale (often "C")
may not include these characters in the "alnum" or "alpha" classes. E.g.:

setlocale(LC_CTYPE,'en_US');

or

setlocale(LC_ALL,'en_US');

Thanks guys!
I'm actually somewhat familiar with OSC. I set it up for a client a while ago, but I had no idea that there is a Linkpoint module for it.
this is great! Thanks again,

If you go to the oscommerce site and click on read the
weekly summaries there is a menu item called 'Workboard'

There is an item: 49

================================
register_globals Compatibility
 
The requirement to have register_globals enabled will be
removed.

Part of this would have been done in Milestone 3 where the
session logic is updated to class.
==================================

There is a target of 2.2-MS4 
(I interpret this to mean they will remove the
'register_globals dependency in Milestone 4 -- they are at
Milestone 2 now and nobody is assigned to the task)

You can see the bug list at
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=tep-bugs

Here is an example:
=======================
New Comment from johan_awouters at pa... @ 09/17/2003 06:39:28
 
 Is this still a problem? 
 
 Can this be related to the effect that the sessions are
lost all the time?  It's strange that the osCsid is not
always appended to the URL. That's way the  session is lost
and the shopping cart is empty. However, if you manually
copy-paste the osCsid, the shopping cart is displayed again
correctly.

 Is this because we are working with a milestone version? 

========================

It looks to me as if the session ids maybe open to capture
by a malicious intruder.

We use to play a bit with OSC, you are able to customize the design as you wish, at least way back when we tried it. Our only problem was that it was too slow. But in general was a good piece of software. 

We decided to write our own with a totally different schema due to the speed. And not based at all on OSC. We branded it under ReadySites.com. Now what OSC has that is great, is the Open Source availability which allows for much faster growth. If you develop an easier design interface and gets added to it, then any design doubts that you have are solved.

If I understand correctly, a regular expression like this: ^[a-z0-9\',.

not part of the regular ASCII set of characters but part of the extended

Use a POSIX named character class. These respect locale settings:

preg_match('/[[:alnum:]]/','?');

This returns true under a locale like 'en_US', or 'de_DE'.

Read all about POSIX named character classes in the egrep(1) manpage.

You should probably call setlocale() in your PHP script before
preg_match()ing against special characters, the default locale (often
"C")
may not include these characters in the "alnum" or "alpha" classes.
E.g.:

setlocale(LC_CTYPE,'en_US');

or

setlocale(LC_ALL,'en_US');

No, it is not kosher. The regex matches strings like "country ham", "cheese
burger" and "shrimp scampi". In fact, it matches any 1 to 35 character
string that doesn't consist entirely of carets and dollar signs. If you want
to make sure that a string at least one but no more than 35 characters, use:

/^.{1,35}$/

But that would match a string of all whitespace. If you want to make sure
that the string doesn't begin with whitespace, try:

/^\S.{0,34}$/

Which guarantees that the first character is not whitespace.

However, you're better off not using a regex for this stuff. Instead, do
this to make sure a string is between 1 and 35 characters, after removing
leading and trailing whitespace:

$len = strlen(trim($s));
if (($len < 1) || ($len > 35)) {
  // the string is too long or too short
} else {
  // the string is just right
}

This also makes you intent clearer, which will be an important factor in a few
weeks, months, or years. Comments are great, but straightforward code can't be
beat.

Well.. it's a regular expression to match a non-empty string, but in real
life you definitely shouldn't use regular expressions for something that
simple.
Dave's example not only makes your code much clearer, but also executes many
times faster than a single regex function.  Regular Expressions are
relatively CPU-intensive and if overused, can considerably diminish your
application's performance, especially on a busy server. Use them only if one
or two simple string functions can't do the job.
Be careful... regular expressions are like drugs - it feels good when you
use them.. they can easily become an addiction,  and they sure can kill (a
server or two).
I learned the hard way.

cheers,
Jerry

Is this "kosher" for determining that something has not be left blank?

Is there a way to repost Post variables, i.e., pass along Post data,
along with a header location change?

No. :-)

To perform a POST with PHP, you have can do it manually:

http://shiflett.org/dev/php_post.phps

or you can use PEAR's HTTP request class:

http://shiflett.org/dev/pear_post.phps

or you can use cURL, and for some reason I don't have an example for that.

Please note that all of this code was written a long time ago and used to
search php.net for cURL (I think that's why I didn't have an example for that).
It should work fine or at least give you an idea of where to look.

Hope that helps.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Best practices for form input/output between PHP &
	MySQL?
Message-ID: <BAY2-F23aZI758Nqm4P00002181@hotmail.com>

Greetings,

I work on a web application that is used to manage tasks and work flow among 
a team of developers and producers.  Clients enter tasks, developers make 
notes and occasionally add code snippets via a standard form with text 
inputs and textarea boxes.

We take care to sanitize user input and data display by way of addslashes(), 
stripslashes(), htmlfunctions(), nl2br() and the like, but occasionally a 
legitimate backslash in a code snippet gets removed when updating a textarea 
containing some code, for example:

escape(document.title.replace(/\+/g,''))
  becomes
escape(document.title.replace(/+/g,''))

Of course, that sort of thing is not easy to catch when you're developing 
such an application (it went unnoticed in our case for quite a few months), 
so I'm wondering if anyone can share some good utility functions that can 
sanitize form input going into a database and information coming from the 
database for display in the browser (with HTML entitized).

In essence, I'd like to hear some thoughts on the most robust way to flesh 
out the following functions:


function sanitizeInputForDB ($strFieldInput) {

}

function formatDataForDisplay ($strData, $isTextArea = false) {
	if (!$isTextArea) {

	} else {

	}
}


TIA,
-Dan

I don't know how secure this would be or if it is considered really bad, but what about saving them in $_SESSION and then redirecting?  Something like:
$_SESSION['post_vars'] = $_POST;
header(blah...);
And then when you get to the second page you could put them back:
$_POST = $_SESSION['post_vars'];

Actually, as I pointed out to someone else, that email was not sent from me (or

By the way your talking, it sounds like you're using stripslashes after 
pulling stuff out of the database -- before displaying it.  Am I reading 
you right?

If so, that's not needed and leads to weird things like you're talking 
about.

If not, where are you using it?

You only need to use it _once_, before putting items into a query.  The
slashes won't be stored in the database.


> function sanitizeInputForDB ($strFieldInput) {

addslashes();

But, you'll also need to make sure data going to numeric fields don't have
anything except numeric characters.  This is because such fields don't
need to be quoted in query strings, thus they're open to being easily
manipulated.

All output should be run through htmlspecialchars(), regardless of it 
being a textarea or not.  That's all you need to do.

Enjoy,

I think you mean to imply the use of addslashes() when generating your SQL
query. I just wanted to clarify that.

Hey Dan,

If you don't need to search the code in the database you may want to
base64_encode/decode it.

Hey Folks:

More excitement...

-----------------------
MySQL Password Handler Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8590

The issue presents itself, due to a lack of sufficient bounds checking
performed on MySQL user passwords that are stored in the 'Password' field
of the 'User' table in a MySQL database. It has been reported that MySQL
fails to properly perform bounds checking when processing passwords. A  
password greater that 16 characters may overrun the bounds of a reserved
buffer in memory and corrupt adjacent memory. The buffer overflow occurs
in an ACL_USER instance of acl_init(), and may ultimately result in the
corruption of a saved instruction pointer.

An attacker with global administrative privileges on an affected MySQL    
server may potentially exploit this condition to have arbitrary supplied
instructions executed in the context of the MySQL server.

This vulnerability has been reported to affect all versions of MySQL up to
and including 4.0.14 and 3.0.57.

Yes-- the syntax is like Java, though: {$array.key}
You may also use objects, with no change: {$object->property}

Or were you asking about getting at the keys themselves, using something 
like a foreach loop?

good question ...

have u tried something like passing in the keys before the template? ie:

{section name=x loop=$keys}
{$keys[x]}<br/>

Message-ID: <011601c37ded$1b16dc30$6401a8c0@EZDSDELL>

I need to allow website visitors to "reset" their cookie values, so to
speak. Anyone have a recommended "method"? Just loop through the array
of vals and set to ''?

Jeff Siegel
P.S. Here's the answer to the question that some may have...namely, why
should visitors be allowed to "reset" their cookie values? Well, after a
user has submitted a form, some of the values are saved in a cookie. On
subsequent visits to the website, those cookie values are automatically
read..and fed..into the appropriate text box fields. So...if they
accidentally messed up during the previous use of the form and bad
values are in the cookies...it seems there should be a simple way to
allow the user to clear out those values.

So, then why not have a preferences page?  It'll have a form displaying
the data from all such cookies.  If something is wrong, the person can 
change it and save the corrected data.

I'm gonna try to explain this as briefly and clearly as I can.

I've got a scheduling program for us court interpreters where there's a
table called 'events'. An event has attributes like date, time, judge,
type of proceeding, language, etc. Of course things like judge and
language are stored as smallints pointing to related records in other
tables. Thus, in order to fetch human-meaningful data I have to join
several tables.

"SELECT events.event_id, events.docket,events.event_time,
 	judges.lastname, proceedings.type, languages.name,
	events.notes, languages.lang_id,
	FROM judges, proceedings, languages, events
	WHERE events.event_date = '$date'
	AND events.judge_id = judges.judge_id
	AND events.language_id = languages.lang_id
	AND events.proceeding_id = proceedings.proceeding_id"

OK, so far so good. But I also want to display data from tables that are
in a 1-M relationship to 'events'. An event can have zero or more
interpreters assigned to it, or zero or more defendant names associated
with it. And I only want to display row of data per event. So even if I
could figure out the LEFT JOIN syntax to left-join multiple tables in this
way, if such is possible, it still wouldn't give me what I want.

What I've been doing is building one associative array with the event_ids
as keys and merging it all together with three queries. (There are rarely
more than about 30 elements at this point.)

My question is, would it be more efficient to do the first query first,
and as I loop through the result, query the related tables, resulting in
maybe 60 queries per page access? Or do it with a lot fewer database
calls, but suck up more memory?

I've always thought it kind of rude to hammer the database when there's
another way, but frankly I'm not sure, maybe that's what MySQL is there
for.

I believe the snarky answer is: "It depends. Do you have more memory
on your Web server boxes or excess processor cycles on your database
machines?"

The second snarky answer is: "Does it even matter? Are your machines
under such load that this comparison is meaningful? If not, code
whatever is most maintainable and document that the other solution may
be necessary under duress." (Alt Answer: Is one significantly faster?)

Finally, my answer is that 60 database calls seems like a lot. I would
probably do fewer calls and more in PHP. Again, I would need to know
the memory footprint and the speed tradeoffs.

Thanks Adam.

I had a feeling the answer would be something like that. I don't know
techniques for measuring memory usage/db access tradeoffs so I don't know
objectively.... I believe the answer to the snarky answers is, no there's
not such a big load on our (one) server and I can surely get away with
either approach, but I'd like to do it "right". I think I will stick with
more PHP/less MySQL.

BTW -- once I had a similar scenario with a Perl/CGI/DBI script and I went
with the big data structure approach, and the thing was so astonishingly
slow (on a shared server) that I know something had to be hideously wrong.

You probably have already thought of this, but if things
slow down too much, you could put the judge's name in the
event table. This brings about the usual headaches
(referential integrity checks you have to make) when you
de-normalize a design. But it might not be too bad (I am
assuming the judges don't change much on the events). 

Just a thought

With clever looping and comparisons, I bet you could get what you want 
with one query.

For exapmle, I've made some calendars where the items are ORDER BY
EventDate, StartTime.  I then loop through the results.  Before starting,
a variable named $LastDate is set to the date of the first record and a
date header is printed out.  While looping through, before displaying each
record, the $LastDate is compared to the current event date.  Once the 
dates are different, then the next date header is printed.

See http://www.bikesummer.org/calendar/ to see what I mean.

Similarly, you can use this principle to handle multiple sub-items.  Like, 
printing the Interpreter and Defendants only when the name changes.

Am I writing this clearly?

Sshhhh, don't let the Normalization Police hear you.

Theoretically one could also make more liberal use of ENUM column types.
Which would also bring major maintenance headaches of its own. Sometimes a
judge retires or dies and should be concealed from the user yet remain
there un-deleted for historical and referential integrity reasons. I don't
even want to think about how to implement that with an ENUM.

Dan,

I believe I do follow you and I don't think it would do for me (or, it
would work, and I do not understand you (-:).

If two successive 'subitems' are different, I want to concatenate the
fields that are different and display then in one cell in one row.

Let's say the result set looked like this

Judge  Language  Defendant  Interpreter
------------------------------------
Jones  Spanish   Estrada    Mirta
Jones  Spanish   Estrada    Elena

...then I want to display


Judge  Language  Defendant  Interpreters
---------------------------------------
Jones  Spanish   Estrada    Mirta, Elena


...because that's what makes sense to the user. Zat make any sense?

Thanks,

	David

I might be misinterpreting his question, but I believe he was asking whether he
should, not whether he could.

As Adam mentioned, with one query, you place a lot of data in memory, which is
good if you can handle it and bad if you can't. With multiple queries, you
create more load on the database, it might be slower, etc.

Without having a good idea about the particular tradeoffs in someone's
situation, it is hard to suggest one way over the other. Personally, I try to
organize my data so well that my queries are as simple as possible (I'm not
joining multiple tables all the time), useful as possible (I can get exactly
the data I need from a simple query), and use up as little memory as possible
(the number of records returned are no more than I need). Given this, I almost
always limit my interactions with the database and do everything in PHP.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Yes.  That's exactly what I thought you were talking about.

So, psuedo code...

$LastEvent = 0;
$LastDefendant = '';
$LastInterpreter = '';
$Defendants = array();
$Interpreters = array();

while ($row = fetchrow()) {
    if ($row['eventid'] != $LastEvent) {
        $LastJudge = $row['judge'];
        if ($row['Defendant'] != $LastDefendant) {
            $LastDefendant = $row['Defendant'];
            $Defednants[] = $row['Defendant'];
        }   
        if ($row['Interpreter'] != $LastInterpreter) {
            $LastInterpreter = $row['Interpreter'];
            $Interpreters[] = $row['Interpreter'];
        }
    } else {
        echo "<tr><td>$LastJudge</td>";
        echo '<td>' . implode(', ', $Defendants) . '</td>';
        echo '<td>' . implode(', ', $Interpreters) . "</td></tr>\n";
        $Defendants = array();
        $Interpreters = array();
        $Defednants[] = $row['Defendant'];
        $Interpreters[] = $row['Interpreter'];
        // also probably need to set the $Last* vars too,
        // but I'm getting lazy and you get the idea by now...
    }
}

Yes and no.  In the question was a lingering doubt that he could 
accomplish it in one query.

That's some great code. Thanks; it works beautifully.

One more thing:  I have a text field for users to enter notes, but if they
include a carriage return, it carries over to the log. How do I strip out
any \n's a user has input (and preferably replace them with, say, a <br />
tag, or at least a space)?

a script using setcookie works fine on a remote host but the cookie doesn't

I suspect the paths are different.  Adjust the path parameter as needed on 
the local machine and see what happens.

Are you setting a domain? You can always omit that to use the current domain,
such as:

header('Set-Cookie: foo=bar');

Hope that helps.

I think I follow you now. Seems like a solution, thank you. I suppose one
could haggle that you're pulling redundant data that you aren't gonna use,
if you see my point. Perhaps I'll  show you how I'm doing it, once I
get it presentable, see what you think.

I think I have done this as best I can in this particular scenario. The
only way to do fewer joins would be to de-normalize the hell out of my db,
and I would surely end up paying dearly for that elsewhere.

Anyway I'm grateful for the discussion. This list rocks.

sorry, don't get it.  Both Moz1.4 and IE6.0 know where to put the cookie 
without being told anything, and they do indeed put it there, but upon next 
invocation they don't read it, as if it's not there.  What "path parameter" 
is this?

Cookies have various attributes that restrict the cases in which a browser will
send them in a request. He mentioned one of those attributes, path, that could
be causing your problem.

I think it is more likely a case of the domain being different, as that is
another attribute. Of course, we're both just guessing.

I am just now in the process of converting a chapter of my book into HTML, so
that I can offer it for free on my Web site. You can read the chapter (without
the figures, currently) here:

http://shiflett.org/books/http-developers-handbook/chapters/11

Hope that helps.

It doesn't have to do with where the cookie is stored.  It has to do with 
the path of the website for which the cookie in question will be 
accessible.

Read the manual.  http://php.net/setcookie

You should try the http.inc class that you can find in PHPclasses website.
This class has methods to send POST variables trough PHP, and of course with
a header location change.

I'd imagine the security risks involved are roughly equivalent to 
accepting post headers in the first place.  Only hitch is you've got to 
make sure you're dealing with the same person, which shouldn't be too 
hard.

has anyone been in the situation to use them yet?

i need some clarification so i can understand their use a little better
because id like to arrange an application to use them because it requires
the need to pull out the data (tables), analyze them + flush the running
process (much like a logrotate type) ...

do merge tables have any real advantage + could you theoretically merge
tables securely over IP using these types of tables/files?

Well, I don't use cookies.  I'd save $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and the
current timestamp in the session and pass the session ID in the query
string of the header(Location) call.  The subsequent script checks the
saved user agent info matches and the time elapsed is less than a few 
seconds ago, you're good to continue.

Isn't it the case that if the user has cookies on it will use cookies
but if the user doesn't have cookies on...then PHP kinda handles things?

Similar.  BUT, you're writing a header() call, which I doubt PHP would 
automatically stick a session ID into.

Plus don't you have to have url-rewriting configured? (I assume url

It's not clear who you're talking to.  Jeff was talking about URL 
rewriting.  I wasn't and URL rewriting doesn't have to be on.

Dan,

If I'm reading this correctly, PHP does automatically handle the passing
of the session ID (see snippet below). However, it doesn't directly
address your question concerning the header call.

"PHP is capable of transforming links transparently. Unless you are
using PHP 4.2 or later, you need to enable it manually when building
PHP. Under UNIX, pass --enable-trans-sid to configure. If this build
option and the run-time option session.use_trans_sid are enabled,
relative URIs will be changed to contain the session id automatically."
(See: http://us3.php.net/session)

Similar.  BUT, you're writing a header() call, which I doubt PHP would 
automatically stick a session ID into.

First, I doubt the transparent session ID / url rewriting works on
header(Location) calls.  Second, even if PHP did tack on a SID to the
location header, the location specified is supposed to be a full URI, thus 
would land in the rule that only relative links are rewritten.  Thus, you 
need to manually tack the session id into the header(Location) URI.

Ok guys, here we go again!

SELECT s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_navn

WHERE s.nnet_produkt_storrelse.id = sv.nnet_produkt_storrelse id

This produces the following error:

You have an error in your SQL syntax near 'id AND sv.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id = v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id AND sv.nnet_' at line 1

I don't see anything wrong with this query, it's standard inner SELECT stuff!  I need help... again!

Sorry for this 'nit-picken' detail stuff again but in
regards to may last post:

 

1.           If you are careful to always use '<br />'
instead of '<br>' the validator won't complain about a
missing end tag.
 
2.           If you never start an unordered list without at
least <li> </li> (empty element) as in:
 
             Line 213: <ul><br />
 
         And you remember to close list items e.g. 
 
             Line 217:  <li>6:45  Product/Technique/Special
Feature<br />
 
        Changed to:
 
             Line 217:  <li>6:45  Product/Technique/Special

Dan,

You may have missed my little "disclaimer" in which I noted "...it
doesn't directly address your question concerning the header call." As
for requiring a full URI...it seems that's not required. The PHP manual
does state that "...relative URIs will be changed to contain the session
id automatically."

You are probably using an older version of mysql which does not support subqueries.  You need to either move up to the latest version of mysql which I beleive now supports subqueries, or rewrite out the subquery.

MessageI did, it seems that mySQL is becoming more and more of a waste of database!

Can't do subqueries, can't do foreign key constraints, even the datetime field column datatype doesn't allow for the now() function as an input parameter value in INSERT?.. so tell me what GOOD is mySQL anyway????

I rewrote the entire database table schema relational structure to include another association table and used that, flatting out the query.  However, it's really BAD coding because I have this query generating for every single $row['nnet_produkt_id'] from the outer query results.  BAD BAD BAD.. that means a while loop INSIDE another while loop!

Can you say performance murder!

MessageI wouldn't categorize mySQL a waste of database.

It depends on your needs.  Do you need a fast, small, cheap database which is easy to get into and use, or a advanced, expensive, database that takes months of studying to begin to utilize to it's best abilities?

Oracle, Sybase, MSSQL etc. have been available for quite some time, have many advanced features, but comes at quite a cost in money, maint, learning curve, and resources.  If you app needs high-end database functionality, then you have to be willing to part with some money, time, and resources.

  I did, it seems that mySQL is becoming more and more of a waste of database!

  Can't do subqueries, can't do foreign key constraints, even the datetime field column datatype doesn't allow for the now() function as an input parameter value in INSERT?.. so tell me what GOOD is mySQL anyway????

  I rewrote the entire database table schema relational structure to include another association table and used that, flatting out the query.  However, it's really BAD coding because I have this query generating for every single $row['nnet_produkt_id'] from the outer query results.  BAD BAD BAD.. that means a while loop INSIDE another while loop!

  Can you say performance murder!

Sorry, that's how I've always viewed the world since birth and school.  Somehow I've compensated for this severe ability lacking and done what I needed to get done.  In the case of creating relational data models of complexities ranging from lookup tables to association tables (as is the case of this freelance project I'm working on), mySQL doesn't cut it.  Oracle, SQL Server and even Sybase (that I don't know) would cut it quite well.  That's how I view it.

  I wouldn't categorize mySQL a waste of database.

  It depends on your needs.  Do you need a fast, small, cheap database which is easy to get into and use, or a advanced, expensive, database that takes months of studying to begin to utilize to it's best abilities?

  Oracle, Sybase, MSSQL etc. have been available for quite some time, have many advanced features, but comes at quite a cost in money, maint, learning curve, and resources.  If you app needs high-end database functionality, then you have to be willing to part with some money, time, and resources.

  mySQL on the other hand has not been around as long as the commercial products, and has at it's foundation a small footprint with the majority of the learning curve in learning SQL and has a very low price - free.

MessageANSI SQL is not what I'm used to, but anyway I bagged the whole initial approach, wrote a new association table (nnet_produkt_storrelse_assoc) and flattened out the query to be

SELECT s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_navn
FROM nnet_produkt p, nnet_produkt_storrelse_assoc sv, nnet_produkt_storrelse s
WHERE p.nnet_produkt_id = sv.nnet_produkt_id
AND p.nnet_produkt_id = ' . $row['nnet_produkt_id'] . 
AND sv.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id = s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id

And that worked perfectly!

MessageSorry to hear you have such a struggle learning from a manual, but I wouldn't disparage a product because it doesn't lend easily to learning based on knowledge of another product.

And when it comes to association tables, I have found no problem using mySQL.  It's all in knowing that in SQL there is always more than 1 way to skin a cat ( no anti-cat sentiment meant ).

With mySQL, they have been working to add in more of the advanced features, and in fact, the foreign keys have been available for a while, the subqueries are now there, and joins have always been Ansi standard.

I can understand you learning in bits and pieces through application.  I think many people learn best this way.  A big problem with learning this way though is that you need to avoid jumping in the fire without a fire suit!  When I decide I want to learn another product so I can add it to my portfolio, I choose an application of my choosing, possibly something I have done already in another environment.  Then I try to replicate it.  I hit alot of walls, but thats when it's time to experiement, hit manuals, ask questions, etc.  Little by little the knowledge comes.  If I try this means of learning while on a "real" project, I'm not going to learn as much because I am constantly under pressure to produce.

  Sorry, that's how I've always viewed the world since birth and school.  Somehow I've compensated for this severe ability lacking and done what I needed to get done.  In the case of creating relational data models of complexities ranging from lookup tables to association tables (as is the case of this freelance project I'm working on), mySQL doesn't cut it.  Oracle, SQL Server and even Sybase (that I don't know) would cut it quite well.  That's how I view it.

    I wouldn't categorize mySQL a waste of database.

    It depends on your needs.  Do you need a fast, small, cheap database which is easy to get into and use, or a advanced, expensive, database that takes months of studying to begin to utilize to it's best abilities?

    Oracle, Sybase, MSSQL etc. have been available for quite some time, have many advanced features, but comes at quite a cost in money, maint, learning curve, and resources.  If you app needs high-end database functionality, then you have to be willing to part with some money, time, and resources.

    mySQL on the other hand has not been around as long as the commercial products, and has at it's foundation a small footprint with the majority of the learning curve in learning SQL and has a very low price - free.  So far, mySQL has worked extremly well in many of my apps.  Sometimes I have to rethink my design because I am thinking too much in the "large db" mindset, but that's me, not mySQL.

    It seems to me that you could really benefit from sitting down with the mySQL manual for a short spell, especially the part about mySQL Ansi 92 support.  It might be beneficial to also get aquanted with Oracle's proprietary aspects so you understand what features need a different solution because your assuming an Oracle feature is Ansi 92.

    This would be true no matter what DB product you pick up.  I got my start in SQL with MSSQL.  When I tried to get into Oracle I was ready to call Oracle a piece of garbage because I couldn't do anything with it.  The joins were different, the allocations different, the stored procedure language different, the permissions systems different.  But after weeks of working with the product, I began to learn the Oracle way and realized my judgement of Oracle was not based on the merits/demerits of Oracle, but on my lack of knowledge of the product and what it's target audience is.

      I did, it seems that mySQL is becoming more and more of a waste of database!

      Can't do subqueries, can't do foreign key constraints, even the datetime field column datatype doesn't allow for the now() function as an input parameter value in INSERT?.. so tell me what GOOD is mySQL anyway????

      I rewrote the entire database table schema relational structure to include another association table and used that, flatting out the query.  However, it's really BAD coding because I have this query generating for every single $row['nnet_produkt_id'] from the outer query results.  BAD BAD BAD.. that means a while loop INSIDE another while loop!

      Can you say performance murder!

        You need at least ver. 4.1 of mySql. You may also be able to rewrite it.

Phil,

When you get a chance, have a look at PostgreSQL -- I'm sure someone has 
already mentioned it though.

I can relate to your learning/doing style and, in fact, I'm glad to get 
this kind of input, since I teach PHP/MySQL, etc. (beginner level).  It 
always helps to be reminded that people have different styles of 
'operating'.

Noticed it.  Sounded like you weren't sure.  Made my points to address
what seemed to be misunderstandings that rewriting would happen in header
calls.

Depends how you interpret "required."  RFC's say the full URI is required.  
Some browsers are kind enough to work on relative paths.

Yes.  That's talking about hyperlinks in the output, not header calls.  
We're talking about header(Location) calls.

Message-ID: <003201c3807c$671ade60$bf8d3818@OBERON1>

Okay let's try a simpler case:

 

You have some products :

 

CREATE TABLE prods (
  prod_id int(4) default NULL,
  name varchar(20) NOT NULL default '',
  desc varchar(20) NOT NULL default ''
) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Products Table';
 
 
INSERT INTO prods (prod_id, name, desc) VALUES (1, 'one',
'first');
INSERT INTO prods (prod_id, name, desc) VALUES (2, 'two',
'second');
INSERT INTO prods (prod_id, name, desc) VALUES (3, 'three',
'third');
INSERT INTO prods (prod_id, name, desc) VALUES (4, 'four',
'fourth');
INSERT INTO prods (prod_id, name, desc) VALUES (5, 'five',
'fifth');
INSERT INTO prods (prod_id, name, desc) VALUES (6, 'six',
'sixth');
 
And the products are sold in districts called groups:
 
CREATE TABLE groups (
  group_id int(4) default NULL,
  name varchar(20) NOT NULL default '',
  desc varchar(20) NOT NULL default ''
) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Products Table';
 
INSERT INTO groups (group_id, name, desc) VALUES (10,
'east', 'eastern district');
INSERT INTO groups (group_id, name, desc) VALUES (20,
'west', 'western district');
 

And you have an associative table which tells which products
are sold in which districts:

 
CREATE TABLE assoc (
  prod_id int(4) NOT NULL default '0',
  group_id int(4) NOT NULL default '0'
) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Associates Prouduct with Groups';
 
INSERT INTO asoc (prod_id, group_id) VALUES (1, 10);
INSERT INTO asoc (prod_id, group_id) VALUES (2, 10);
INSERT INTO asoc (prod_id, group_id) VALUES (3, 10);
INSERT INTO asoc (prod_id, group_id) VALUES (4, 20);
INSERT INTO asoc (prod_id, group_id) VALUES (5, 20);
INSERT INTO asoc (prod_id, group_id) VALUES (6, 20);
 
In English you sell six products one, two and three are sold
in the eastern district and
Four, five and six are sold in the western district.
 
You were trying something like this:
 
SELECT p.prod_id


FROM prods p, assoc a, groups g


where p.prod_id = a.prod_id


and a.group_id = g.group_id


and a.group_id


and g.group_id in
(select group_id from groups where group_id = 10)
 
which roughly states:
 
find the products and districts that exist in a set of
groups that are equal to 10
 
or:
 
find product information from the eastern district 
 
or:
 
SELECT p.prod_id


FROM prods p, assoc a, groups g


where p.prod_id = a.prod_id


and a.group_id = g.group_id


and a.group_id


and g.group_id = 10
 
What do think?

$row['nnet_produkt_id'] from the outer query results.  BAD
BAD BAD.. that means a while loop INSIDE another while loop!

 

Can you say performance murder!

You need at least ver. 4.1 of mySql. You may also be able to
rewrite it.

Ok guys, here we go again!

 

SELECT s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_navn 

FROM nnet_produkt_storrelse s, nnet_produkt_varegruppe v,
nnet_storrelse_varegruppe_assoc sv 

WHERE s.nnet_produkt_storrelse.id =

   FROM nnet_produkt_varegruppe

   WHERE nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code =  'FLU17' 

 )

 AND s.nnet_produkt_storrelse_id > 1

 

This produces the following error:

 

You have an error in your SQL syntax near 'id AND
sv.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id = v.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id
AND sv.nnet_' at line 1

 

I don't see anything wrong with this query, it's standard
inner SELECT stuff!  I need help... again!

Seconded.  I'm very impressed with 7.3, and with its performance, not 
just because it offers core SQL features that probably won't show up in 
MySQL for another couple of years, at least.

Chendry: see also:http://www.netsys.com/library/verisign-hijack-icann.txt

The quick summary is that Verisign introduced wildcard records into the 
top-level .com and .net zones that point all non-existent domains to 
64.94.110.11. With one stroke there are no longer any non-existent .com 
or .net domains, which has fascinating potential for breaking all kinds 
of things.

The issue with returned mail from pjmatthews has nothing to do with 
this-- it is the result of a rude mailer-daemon at dynamic DNS service 
tzo.com that doesn't understand how to handle undeliverable messages 
from mailing lists. (What do I mean by rude? If an email message has an 
Errors-to: header, like this one does, a nice mailer will send error 
messages to that address instead of sending them to the original sender.)

What bot is generating these fake vacation messages?

Is anyone else just a little bit curious about what will go down on 
Sept. 22? Maybe pjmatthews appear from out of the clouds and accept all

mercury.hosting4u.net?

Seems to be where this message generates from - maybe a poorly configured
mailserver.

Whatever it is, thank heavens I have procmail around to /dev/null all 
these stupid messages.

So, Hans, how about adjusting the mail server to drop these type 
of messages?

Just got back from holiday, hence late reply. Didn't you just miss out an

"WHERE s.nnet_produkt_storrelse.id = sv.nnet_produkt_storrelse id"

I usually look twice when I find myself blaming a language or system :D

Tomorrow night's meeting is at Digital Pulp on East 23rd St,
but I'm not sure abut the bicycle-parking situation there.

Didn't want you going to the wrong venue... it's happened to me before!

Since its after hours, you can try to bring it up in the elevator.  If the
doorman complains, ask him to show you where to park it in the court yard
behind the building.

You say you can't do sub-queries

 

But I think if you changed 

' AND sv.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id IN (

   SELECT nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id 

   FROM nnet_produkt_varegruppe

   WHERE nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code =  'FLU17' 

 )'

To

 AND sv.nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id = (

   SELECT nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id 

   FROM nnet_produkt_varegruppe

   WHERE nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code =  'FLU17' 

 )

 

You might have better luck.

 

You say you can't do foreign key constraints -

 

>From the manual:

"Starting from version 3.23.43b InnoDB features foreign key
constraints. InnoDB is the first MySQL table type which
allows you to define foreign key constraints to guard the
integrity of your data. 

The syntax of a foreign key constraint definition in InnoDB:


[CONSTRAINT symbol] FOREIGN KEY (index_col_name, ...)
                  REFERENCES table_name (index_col_name,
...)
                  [ON DELETE {CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION
                              | RESTRICT}]
                  [ON UPDATE {CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION
                              | RESTRICT}]

Both tables have to be InnoDB type, in the table there must
be an INDEX where the foreign key columns are listed as the
FIRST columns in the same order, and in the referenced table
there must be an INDEX where the referenced columns are
listed as the FIRST columns in the same order. InnoDB does
not auto-create indexes on foreign keys or referenced keys:
you have to create them explicitly. The indexes are needed
for foreign key checks to be fast and not require a table
scan. "

 

You say the now() function is not allowed to be input into
datetime columns

While that is true you might want to read up on timestamp
column types

 

Timestamps can (under most circumstances) be set to NULL or
now().

 

In short, I think you are mistaken. 

 

You said you added an associative table to "flatten out" the
query and that it was BAD.

 

Well when you make a sub-query, the database makes the
equivalent of a temp table underneath the covers, from which
it can do the selection. This means you should only use
sub-queries on ad hoc requests. At other times (for routine
retrievals) it is better to set up your own table from which
to do the selections, because you can create the type of
table it is and specifically put indexes where they are
needed.

 

In short, I don't agree with you.

     SELECT nnet_produkt_varegruppe_id 

     FROM nnet_produkt_varegruppe

     WHERE nnet_produkt_varegruppe_code =  'FLU17' 

   )



  You might have better luck.



  I'll remember that but right now they're talking about a complete RDM redesign so this one is a moot exercise until further notice.



  You say you can't do foreign key constraints -



  From the manual:

  "Starting from version 3.23.43b InnoDB features foreign key constraints. InnoDB is the first MySQL table type which allows you to define foreign key constraints to guard the integrity of your data. 

  The syntax of a foreign key constraint definition in InnoDB:

InnoDB does not auto-create indexes on foreign keys or referenced keys: you have to create them explicitly. The indexes are needed for foreign key checks to be fast and not require a table scan. "



  That's fine.  You didn't ask me what version mySQL this is.  They don't OFFER InnoDB as table type for the version of mySQL that is running on the remote server.  So I STILL can't do foreign key constraints.



  You say the now() function is not allowed to be input into  datetime columns

  While that is true you might want to read up on timestamp column types



  Timestamps can (under most circumstances) be set to NULL or now().



  That's fine, for timestamps, but not for datetime.  Again, I don't have this problem in Oracle, sorry to be a db snob.



  In short, I think you are mistaken. 



  You said you added an associative table to "flatten out" the query and that it was BAD.



  Well when you make a sub-query, the database makes the equivalent of a temp table underneath the covers, from which it can do the selection.

At other times (for routine retrievals) it is better to set up your own table from which to do the selections, because you can create the type of table it is and specifically put indexes where they are needed.



  In short, I don't agree with you. 



  That's fine.  You don't have to.  But before you go into slamming my theories realize the fact that I am working with a remote server that has an older version of mySQL than what your solutions can accommodate, therefore, again, mySQL is inadequate in this case.

Hi Nasir,

The meeting outline can be found online at:

http://www.nyphp.org/

Yes, it starts at 6:30, with the 45 minute feature presentation beginning at
7:00 (so if you're running late, you can still catch some good material, but
probably not a good seat).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Sessions in Objects
Message-ID: <3F6F5963.5030900@netzero.com>

Hello,
What are the issues related to storing objects in sessions?  For 
instance, say I have a shopping cart full of objects that I store in a 
session.  If I want to make a change to an object what kind of overhead 
is associated with it? 
ex:
$cart = $_SESSION['shopping_cart'];
$cart->items[2]->change_size('medium');
$_SESSION['shopping_cart'] = $cart;
Is there another appraoch that might be better?
Thanks,
Scott Mattocks

Also, not sure it is relevant, but when I hit reply, Outlook put in two
address in the "To" box, your own address and list's address. Isn't your

normally the small scripts i write either getopt for it's content or read
STDIN along the pipe, but i just tried to throw in a usage() function for
null input and could not determine if STDIN was empty or not it, just hangs
(W32).

ie:
$d = fread(STDIN, 1024);

nothing seems to be able to determine if there is content ... any ideas?
have not tried on debian yet.  thought checking (STDIN) would work but
didn't.

I'd like to jump in, make a fool of myself, and then let the more
experienced people correct me (-:

If you want to store object in sessions, go ahead. The relative overhead?
Object instantiation is said to be an expensive operation, and OOP code
slower than its strictly procedural counterpart. (I hear PHP 5 will bring
major improvements to PHP's OOP support so you are thinking forward.) PHP
serializes and de-serializes session-stored objects as needed at request
time, so you get some disk I/O, but the same is true of primitives in
sessions (right, gurus?).

As for your snippet, I think it's fundamentally ok. A technique I have
uses is to assign $_SESSION['cart'] to $cart BY REFERENCE, just for
convenience (save typing) and it seems to work.


> $cart = $_SESSION['shopping_cart'];
> $cart->items[2]->change_size('medium');
> $_SESSION['shopping_cart'] = $cart;
> Is there another appraoch that might be better?

$cart =&  $_SESSION['shopping_cart'];
$cart->items[2]->change_size('medium');
// there, I saved you  a line.

I'm confused as to what you're really after.  Wouldn't a usage example 
apply to tips on passing arguments to a command line script?  Arguments 
for such scripts are found in $_SERVER['argv'], not STDIN.

As far as STDIN goes, I'm used to reading it via fopen() then fgets().

So, a quick and dirty example...


if ( empty($_SERVER['argv'][1]) ) {
    $_SERVER['argv'][1] = '';
}

switch ($_SERVER['argv'][1]) {
    case 'blah':
        $In = fopen('php://stdin', 'r');

        while ( !feof($In) ) {
           // do blah
        }
        break;

    default:
        echo 'usage...';
}

Enjoy,

that was more or less what I had come up with but I had noticed that passing
say an argument for reading php://stdin when there was no content would just
hang.  So if someone did:
php blah.php blah
-instead of-
cat <file> | php blah.php blah
the feof is never read, im trying to determine if it has to do with the
option 'auto_detect_line_endings'

ok after further investigation i realized i should have worded my question
differently but in a nutshell:

this requires process control functions for setting a timeout to not wait
for STDIN (otherwise user needs to type something first) in turn these
functions are not available on Windoze.  so just to clarify my question -
"on W32 there is no way to timeout STDIN from cli?"

Jon,

I remembered seeing something about stream timeouts at
php.net 

I was curious so I looked it up:

bool stream_set_timeout ( resource stream, int seconds [,
int microseconds])


Sets the timeout value on stream, expressed in the sum of
seconds and microseconds. 


Note: As of PHP 4.3, this function can (potentially) work on
any kind of stream. In PHP 4.3, socket based streams are
still the only kind supported in the PHP core, although
streams from other extensions may support this function. 

I don't know if this is any help -- but it might be.

unfortunatley that failed as well ... here is a simple example:

<?php
 stream_set_timeout(STDIN, 3);
 $in = fgets(STDIN);
 echo $in;
?>

i was expecting this to bail out and print nothing after 3 seconds ...

I found this interesting..

<?php
 
 
 //  hacked  from the proc_open example in the manual
 
$descriptorspec = array(
   0 => array("pipe", "r"),  // stdin is a pipe that the
child will read from
   1 => array("pipe", "w"),  // stdout is a pipe that the
child will write to
   2 => array("file", "/tmp/error-output.txt", "a") //
stderr is a file to write to
);
$process = proc_open("php", $descriptorspec, $pipes);
if (is_resource($process)) {

    fwrite($pipes[0], "\"NE1 there ??\"");   // hacked
here..
    fclose($pipes[0]);

    while(!feof($pipes[1])) {
        echo fgets($pipes[1], 1024);
    }
    fclose($pipes[1]);
    // It is important that you close any pipes before
calling
    // proc_close in order to avoid a deadlock
    $return_value = proc_close($process);

    echo "command returned $return_value\n";
}
?>

again this may not further your cause... but it might

Perhaps you want...
    ${$label . 'Array'} = array();

I ran a similar test.  Do note though, the first parameter to the function 
is supposed to be a resource ID.  None the less, it returns false ("wasn't 
set" in my test) so this function isn't meant for manipulating STDIN.

        $In = fopen('php://stdin', 'r');
        if (stream_set_timeout($In, 1) ) {
            echo "was set\n";
        } else {
            echo "wasn't set\n";
        }

I just searched php.general about this and couldn't find any answers there 
either.  http://groups.google.com/groups?group=php.general

just wanted to point out that STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR with --enable-cli resolves
to a resource automatically
(http://www.zend.com/manual/features.commandline.php)

STDIN = resource of "php://stdin"

same for

$_SERVER['argv'][1] = $argv[1]

here is another example i notice that does not work as it should:

ini_set("max_execution_time", "5");
 $in = fgets(STDIN);
 echo $in;

throws:

Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 5 seconds exceeded.

I'm thinking about getting a subscription to PHP Architect. However, today I
saw PHP Magazine banner on NYPHP.org. Has anyone read this magazine? How is
it compared to PHP|a?  Also, the price is kinda steep, $72 for 6 issues
compared to PHP|a's $22 for 12.

the price.

I have three issues I'll be giving away as samples at tonight's meeting (cover story: PHP 5's New OO MOdel).  I've read through the magazine and it's very complete and detailed.  Both are great, but I might say that PHP Magazine is a bit more technical.

Message-ID: <006B22B846854640942D08F78855FCE14F184B@addison.belkin.com>


Hi.
I just installed php version 4.3.3, apache2.x and mysql version 4.1 on
Windows.  The mySql server does not work with php authentication and the
error message suggests that i update php.  Unfortunately, I cannot find a
higher version of php released as Windows Binaries.  Worse yet, I am not
sure it would save me because the documentation says they are going to
deprecate the mysql library.    But I am thinking that the 'mysqli' library
might fix my problem, but it looks like I have to build the code myself to
integrate it, and I haven't seen a windows source package for php.  
 I can back down my version of mysql, but then I lose some nice coding
advantages there.  This is all very frustrating because I am accustomed to
working in linux or some other unix and working with gnu tools where you
have a lot of freedom.    But I am not sure that would work to get a viable
windows executable and set of dlls.  Does anyone know if this can be done?
Is there any kind of package for building Windows php?  Is there a simpler
solution that I am not seeing?
Thanks for your advice.

I think it is good to support PHP magazines in general, at least while each is
still relatively young. PHP Journal's fall is indicative of the instability
such publications must endure initially. I'm speaking to myself as much as
anyone.

PHP Magazine has always seemed financially instable, but that's just my general
perception (I could be completely wrong). It also seems to be targetted at the
western European audience, which might be why it is so expensive to get it
elsewhere. Still, some good authors have written for it, so I'm sure it is a
quality magazine. I'm going to try and sneak at glance at one of the copies
Hans brings.

php|a seems to be the most successful so far, but I'm not sure if that is due
to better content or being more focused on a worldwide audience. I think
allowing people to buy individual issues as PDFs for very little money has
helped them a lot. They gave me a free subscription back when they first
started, so I've kept up more with it than with PHP Magazine.

I wrote an article on XSS and CSRF for the October issue of php|a. As little as
they pay authors, I figure that counts as supporting them. :-)

This is a nasty combination of versions. You can't run these together,
and surprisingly enough, it's not the fault of Apache 2.0. :)

If you want to use MySQL 4.1, you need the mysqli extension, which is
PHP 5 only. Unfortunately, you need to not only be running the latest
CVS (well, actually BitKeeper) version of MySQL 4.1, you probably also
need to use the latest CVS of PHP 5.0. (So, you can't, for example,
download MySQL 4.1a and use that with PHP 5.0 beta 1.)

MySQL 4.1's in alpha and PHP 5.0's in beta and PHP's Apache 2.0
support is non-production quality, so draw you own conclusions. :)

I looked into getting this running on Mac OS X and/or Redhat
Linux. It's a super pain-in-the-ass. I was looking at installing
BitKeeper just to get the MySQL sources *and* upgrading autoconf and
bison to get MySQL to build. And I already had a working version of
PHP 5.0 building from CVS!

I wouldn't suggest trying it on Windows. I would suggest using MySQL
4.0 instead as that is the best of all the crappy alternatives. You
could also do what I'm doing: waiting until a newer version of MySQL
4.1 is released as a binary. A third option is looking to find a
built-from-CVS binary version of MySQL 4.1 and trying something from
http://snaps.php.net/.

That may work, but now that MySQL 4.1 is GPL, PHP cannot currently
distribute the MySQL client libraries due to "issues." (That are being
worked on.) So, YMMV.

Hello everyone,

Today's meeting was great, It was nice to attach faces to some of the
regularly seen names on the list :)

I just wanted to comment on templates discussion that went on today. All
three presenters did their parts pretty well. The thing that bothered me was
that both Daniel and Chris sort of implied that the "designers" are fairly
dumb creatures, who only know HTML, or XHTML, and are completely oblivious
to the whole realm of scripting. We all know that in today's market almost
every designer has had some kind of experience with scripting, be it PHP,
ASP, CF or even JavaScript. Unless they hands you the design in form of an
image file, which will qualify them as an artist rather than a web designer.


Officially, my stance on the templating engine is not a solid one. I
recently setup smarty for a client, a painful process to setup with no root
access, but it worked out quite well. I'll probably play around with PHPLib,
however, last I looked at it, it totally confused me with the way blocks
work. Most of my projects don't use an external templating engine, mostly
everything in php, evals, includes, etc. etc.

hi everybody,

I am not sure what would be the best way of doing the
following.  I have a php script that will take a HTTP
uploaded zip file and and uncompress it. I am not sure
if  i should just do exec('gunzip $filename'); . Is
there a cleaner way?

Neither Chris or I never implied that designers are dumb. In todays market
you can find many 'Jack of all tades'. I have worked with amazing designers
and many of them did not know any programming what so ever. Not knowing a
program language(s) does not mean that one is dumb. Being able to let a
designer concentrate on what he/she does best, will result in a better
product.
I am positive that there are many good designers that know how to program,
but when I look for a solution, I would like it to fit most cases.

A word about PHPLib: it takes time to get used to! I did not go into
details, but without adding anthing else to the HTML (besides variables and
blocks), PHPLib Templates can do ANYTHING that you need be done with the
template. I have build many commercial and complex sites with it (where the
designers of the site did not know how to program :)).

I am not sure why but it did come across to me that as if  "designers" in
question were mostly those who didn't know anything about scripting, or the
business logic. Hence the usage of "dumb", perhaps not the right word :) 
Thanks for clarification though.

I'll give PHPLib a shot for one of my upcoming projects, and see where it
leads me.

Depending on what you want to do with the file after you uncompress
it, you may want to check out: <http://www.php.net/zlib>.

On the contrary-- designers (and especially the integrators in Hans' 
world) are generally brilliant. It takes a logical mind to program in 
PHP, but it takes an artist to be able to craft an attractive website 
that is actually usable by non-technical people in a wide array of 
browsers. Had I been a little more on target, I would have implied that 
it is important to find a system that maximizes everyone's strengths. 
Even on a project where you are the sole author, it's helpful to be in a 
place where your tasks are delineated.

That's exactly why some kind of templating scheme, whether it's 
disciplined PHP, Smarty, PHPLib, ZPT (I'm gonna check that out, thanks 
Andrew), or something you built from scratch, is important, and worth 
the processing overhead it imposes. Though maybe not worth 3x 
overhead... ;-)

I learned a lot last night, thank you everyone!

Might want to check out the PECL/PEAR zip package

Also, there's the Zip File Functions:

The best way to do this .... Email dan h if you have questions

For this example, we will show how to password protect a directory with
a specific login and password. You can apply this procedure to virtual
sites also by changing the directories. 
   a.   Telnet in, and login as the User or admin or root
   b.   Navigate to the directory you want to password protect.
   c.   Create the .htaccess file in the directory (example: pico
.htaccess), it should contain the following lines:
      # Access file 
      
		order allow,deny
		allow from all
		require valid-user
		Authname "Administrative area"
		Authtype Basic
		AuthUserFile /DirectoryName/.htpasswd

	Replace "DirectoryName" with the appropriate path
	

Now you must create the .htpasswd file using the htpasswd tool. 
   a.	Type the following command to create the file and add a user: 
   b.   /usr/bin/htpasswd -c .htpasswd username 
   c.   You will be prompted for the users' password twice.  If you need
to add additional users to the file, use the command above without the
-c.

I've set up Smarty as non-root more often than not, and it wasn't painful.
What was the problem?

Last night's discussion was fascinating. All the presentations were
compelling. ?Viva NYPHP!

I'd like to have another look at the examples if I could. (I want
to look at that function that converted values in bytes to human-friendly
strings )

That Zend IDE thing has me breathing heavy too. I think I'm gonna bite.
Question:  as it really platform independent? In other words, say I buy a
copy, run it on Windoze machine, then remove Windoze and install Linux in
its place. Would I be able to re-install my Zend Studio? Yes I was paying
attention when Daniel said it's written in Java, but still one wonders if
there are any platform-specific gotchas.

Hands On: Using PHP and PEAR for Web Services
---------------------------------------------------
The promise of distributed, platform-independent applications can make Web
services appealing to many tech execs. But, it can also be more work than
many devs bargain for. A PHP Open Source project called PEAR looks to provide
devs a huge helping hand, by providing many key SOAP classes. See how sweet
a PEAR can be.

Open Source vs. Shared Source - Hunt for Value
---------------------------------------------------
You may have missed last weekend's Mosley-De La Hoya fight, but there's
another battle worth watching that may prove more lucrative to your career.
Vendors are beginning to take a few pages from the Open Source playbook,
offering devs more access to code and community for paid software. OET takes
a look at the back-and-forth over the question of how much value "Shared Source"
truly offers, and it's not on pay-per-view.

Zend Studio 3.0 Supports Mission-Critical PHP Apps
---------------------------------------------------
Engineers at Zend, keying off an uptick in corporate interest in PHP for
mission-critical web-based apps, have released Zend Studio 3.0, an upgrade to
their PHP IDE. See how interest from CBS, Lufthansa and others led Zend to add
dynamic code support, online debugging and performance tuning in the latest IDE.

#develop Offers Sharp, Open Source IDE for .NET
---------------------------------------------------
Developers looking for an Open Source way to access .NET have an Open Source
IDE that sports add-in menus, compiler backend tools and more. The #develop team
has released #develop 1.0, with richer backend support for .NET 1.1, and easier
front-end nav tools. OET spoke with project founder Christoph Wille, to get a

SPML Dev Toolkit Open for Free Download
---------------------------------------------------
Devs can download a free, Open Source toolkit for Service Provisioning Markup
Language (SPML) just as OASIS nears full adoption of an SPML 1.0 standard. SPML
uses XML to help ensure cross-platform interoperability for access-control and
identity technologies. Take a test drive of the latest tools for helping devs
build secure end-to-end web services.

Hands On: Inside the Tricky PHP-to-XML Project
---------------------------------------------------
PHP-to-XML projects can be either relatively straightforward or complex. And now,
as PHP becomes a familiar scripting environment for programmers working with and
supporting XML, questions about the interoperability of both languages abound.
This week, OET looks at the growing list of questions surrounding PHP-with-XML
projects, and, more importantly, offers developers some answers.

You can download all of them. Once you install your product, it registers
your license key as used. If you want to install the client on another
machine, you will need to request from Zend to cancel your key and issue you
a new one.

Does it run out onto the network and check your license every time it
launches? What if you wanted to run it on a machine that for some reason
was not connected to the Internet, e.g, suppose your ISP was down? Would
it refuse to run?

TIA

David,

I am not really sure how Zend do their license validations. You should
contact them at contact at zend.com, sales at zend.com, ide at zend.com.

Best,
Daniel

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHPTAL - PHP Template Attribute Language
Message-ID: <20030924152146.GU8912@thighmaster.digitalpulp.com>

Hey Crew,

As promised, here is the link to PHPTAL, the PHP implementation of Zope's Page
Templates (ZPT):
    http://phptal.sourceforge.net/

The best place to get started is of course the documentation which seems to be
very good:
    http://phptal.sourceforge.net/bagpack/HTML_Template_PHPTAL/doc/

I'd be glad to put together a short presentation (along the lines of what was
done last night) for a future meeting if there is interest.  Like I mentioned
last night, I'm very familiar with the original TAL implementation in Zope, but
not at all with the PHP implmentation, as it was nascent when I had first found
it.  So, a presentation would give me a good excuse to get to know PHPTAL.

Andrew

In the future, please 1) stick to PHP, 2) make a concerted attempt to 
find an answer on your own (see below) and 3) provide a pointed question 
that demonstrates what you're trying to do and what you've tried.

Go to one or both of the following:
http://www.google.com/
http://groups.google.com/

Enter the search terms: "bsf generated tags jsp"

BSF is a generic scripting framework, but you need to say what scripting language you are using underneath ... (i dont think you can use PHP but i could be wrong) ...

http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/

The Alicebot Program D uses BSF for executing Javascript between <javascript> tags.

Thanx, actually I have already gone to jakarta.apache.org/bsf and downloaded the appropriate TLD and JAR files, installed, rebooted and tried using JRun, to no avail, I get NoClassDefFoundError on BSFManager() anytime I try using <bsf:expression> or <bsf:scriptlet>

I thought that (for Dan's sake considering his PHP puritanical viewpointing) there might be some PHP programmers who can cross-program also in JSP and have run into any problems involving BSF.

Happy now Dan?

Well sounds more like a CLASSPATH problem then a BSF issue (a normal common problem when you try to attempt something "that should" work with all containers instead of what they were originally made for (Tomcat)) - thus another example of a common Java problem + why PHP is less of a hassle.  From what I remember on older versions JRun has an extensive management console that manage your .jars ... likewise you did not say which scripting language you are using underneath, for example if I use javascript w/ BSF I need to make sure js.jar is linked, etc.  

This would be your problem if BSFManager() can't find the required libs for the scripting language.  (likewise just guessing)

I would ultimately like to use PHP underneath but that would require some custom JAR files to do that, that would be a trip.. for now I've tried both Javascript and TCL, I have both JAR files installed already.  What would I need to do in CLASSPATH to ensure working order; I put the path to the JAR files in CLASSPATH, what else would you recommend?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Global error handling ...
Message-ID: <006801c3829f$776b5680$8119fea9@thinkpad>

i missed a great meeting *again* last night and one of the questions i
wanted to ask what in regards to having a global error handler for your
website.

for example i really wanted to provide much more helpful info on items that
can occur with mysql for a project (cant connect, misconfiguration,
non-installed tables, etc) ...

but i noticed that (could be my config) that mysql_select_db will not pass
error to any handlers (using set_error_handler).  i ended up giving up and
writing a bunch of tests inside install.php instead.  but i thought there
was a way to pass mysql_error() to your page handlers + if it was ok/smart
to autoinclude both set_error_handler + the handler for all of the app.

was really looking for/asking about this in the site layout discussion.

Aw man... This is the NYPHP mailing list. Is it too much to ask that
people's posts be on at least one, if not both, of NY or PHP?

I know it's tempting to use this list as a general all-purpose Web
programming resource because a lot of people on the list know how to
solve problems with JSP, BSF, ASP, Tcl, etc. But please don't.

This is for PHP. (Or, as I said before, New York.) If you need the
name of a good list for non-PHP Web development questions, I suggest
webdesign-l. (http://www.webdesign-l.com) It covers more than just
questions about HTML and lots of people are happy to answer (and read
the answers to) programming questions of all kinds. I know; I've been
on that list for about 5-6 years now.

I'm not saying questions on SQL and Web hosting are bad. They're okay
because they're closely related to PHP. But BSF? No way.

But enough from me.

Ok maybe I have asked too many questions here I am afraid.  I guess I should
just dart out of here.  I've been in NY enough and normally I post a lot of
PHP questions, and ultimately if I could get BSF to work I'd like to find
some custom JARS that would allow PHP within JSP.

A reasonable suggestion. Quite honestly, I'd like to install it on two
boxes, one Red Hat 9.x, one Win2K, and I'd like to do it legally, and I'd
like to do it inexpensively. <whine>I know it's a fair price, but OTOH I
am not making real cash at this full time, we're talking less than

Theoretically, could one put it on the Linux machine and run Zend Studio
remotely over an SSH tunnel from the Windoze box? I haven't yet
experimented with running full-blown Linux GUI applications remotely in
this fashion.


btw I've already had a little adventure with the Zend Studio eval copy I
just installed. It overwrote php.ini with its own and when I restarted
Apache, she gave me about a dozen error popups "the procedure entry point
_safe_emalloc could not be located in the dynamic library php4ts.dll" and
"unable to load dynamic library C:\Zend\lib\php_ext\php_xxx.dll". So I
restored my original php.ini and that seems to have resolved everything.

id think having a scripting language inside of a scripting language inside
of a scripting language inside of a scripting language could be overkill :-)
plus you can already get what you want:

http://www.php.net/java
http://us4.php.net/manual/en/ref.java.php#java.servlet

trust me, the headache of JSP is not worth it.

I did this when evaluating a previous version of Zend Studio and it worked
just fine.

Hi Jon:

When some mysql* functions fail, they cause PHP to die.  Finding out
what's going on is doable via $php_errormsg, which requires track_errors
to be on (in php.ini for example).

Here are some snippets from my SQL Solution class:

    //  Connect to server
    $this->SQLConnection = @mysql_connect($this->SQLHost, $this->SQLUser,
            $this->SQLPassword) or die
            ( $this->KillQuery($FileName, $FileLine, $php_errormsg) );

    //  Select a db
    $this->SQLDbHandle = @mysql_select_db($this->SQLDbName, 
            $this->SQLConnection)
            or die ( $this->KillQuery($FileName, $FileLine,
            'Could not select database. '
            . 'Invalid database name or connection ID.') );


    //  Run a query
    $php_errormsg = '';
    if ( $this->SQLRecordSet = @mysql_query($this->SQLQueryString,
            $this->SQLConnection) ) {

        if ( ! $this->SQLRecordSetFieldCount =
                @mysql_num_fields($this->SQLRecordSet) ) {
            $this->SQLRecordSetFieldCount = 0;
        }

        if ( ! $this->SQLRecordSetRowCount =
                @mysql_num_rows($this->SQLRecordSet) ) {
            $this->SQLRecordSetRowCount = 0;
        }

    } elseif ( $php_errormsg == '' ) {
        # Probably a database error.
        $this->KillQuery( $FileName, $FileLine,
                @mysql_error($this->SQLConnection) );

    } else {
        # Some PHP error.  Probably a bad Connection.  Complain.
        $this->KillQuery($FileName, $FileLine, $php_errormsg);

    }

Enjoy,

I'm running the ZDE 3.0.  Pretty kewl, however, the GUI slooooowwwws way
down (ZDE 2.6 had no problem).  Currently working with Zend tech support to
figure out why.  One suggestion they've offered is to upgrade to the JRE
1.4.2 (I've got 1.4.1).  Have not gone this far yet as it appears to be a
reasonable PITB to upgrade the JRE.  Just an FYI/data point for everyone.

I'm happy to say I'm one of the keynote interviewees in that article.

A moment ago, the Editor fulfiled my request for a couple minor tweaks to
improve the accuracy of the third paragraph.  So, if you've already read 
it, you might want to check back.

Enjoy,

Hey Folks:

I gave a the IDE sample a shot.  I wrote a quick outline of my painful 
experience which I may turn into a letter to Zeev.  Here's the short of 
it...

I found the Zend site torturous (JavaScript requirements, tons of cookies,
broken advanced search).

I found a couple major drawbacks with the IDE which will keep me from
purchasing it at this time.  It frequently sets a background color of it's
own but uses Window's font color, producing windows that are difficult to
read, if not impossible.  The GUI has no means of debugging or profiling
command line scripts.

Enjoy,

I'm running the ZDE 3.0.  Pretty kewl, however, the GUI slooooowwwws way
down (ZDE 2.6 had no problem).  Currently working with Zend tech support
to
figure out why.  One suggestion they've offered is to upgrade to the JRE
1.4.2 (I've got 1.4.1).  Have not gone this far yet as it appears to be
a

Oh yes:

Forgot to mention...  Since I use a snapshot development build of PHP 5,
the system spit out several warning dialog boxes on every HTTP request.

I'm not sure what merge tables would buy you in this case, and I'm not sure if all of the functionality you'd need would be available (they have some limitations:  http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/MERGE.html

AFAIK you can only merge tables locally.  They are primarily used to provide very large, mostly read only/fairly static tables.  But, with newer versions of MySQL, you'd probably want their RAID functionality (http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/CREATE_TABLE.html#IDX1508)

P.S. We're in complete agreement concerning their site. It definitely
needs to be revamped. It's not always obvious where to look for
something and, if you do find something good and don't bookmark it...you
better remember how you found it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Debugging phpBB: blank page
Message-ID: <BAY2-F66HLyBPgdbgvn00017edc@hotmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm having some trouble debugging a client's phpBB system.

All the tables under a 'phpbb' database seem to be set up, and all the files 
for managing the forum are in place.  I have confirmed this by 
'mysqldump'ing his database and source'ing it into mine, and copying his 
files to my local machine; everything works for me locally.

The problem that he is seeing is that he gets a blank page on what should be 
the forum homepage.  Here are the steps I've taken to isolate the problem to 
no avail:

- set error_reporting(E_ALL);
- added the following to the .htaccess in the directory (httpd.conf is 
configured to allow me to do this) php_value error_reporting 7
- tailed the Apache error_log
- scanned httpd.conf for access restrictions.  I can echo text on this index 
page.
- separately tested for globals and noted that they were on, I was able to 
toggle this in .htaccess with the following flag: php_value register_globals 
1
- stripped the ampersand suppression of mysql errors in the database 
abstraction class.
- successfully used the stock phpMyAdmin from his host, under his webroot, 
to connect to this database.
- connected to MySQL via the command line client as root, the default site 
user, and the phpBB user.
- Googled for "blank page phpBB", which throws up a lot of false hits 
because phpBB is the default forum for many online PHP related discussions 
of blank pages.
- Perused the Knowledge Base at http://phpbb.com/kb/


I'm not quite sure what other tests I can carry out to isolate the problem.  
Is there anything obvious that I'm missing?

Thanks for any and all help in advance,
-Dan

i would recommend using fgetcsv function should help
you.
if you goto http://us3.php.net/fgetcsv there is an
example for you.

IMHO? If you're pretty sure they know what they're doing you can probably
accomplish this with PhpMyAdmin.

I seem to recall hearing of this before, and the problem was that the forum
could not connect to the database. So, what happens when you try to manually
connect to the database with the mysql command-line client?

If that works, check to see if the forum expects the MySQL socket to be
somewhere it is not. You may even create a link from /tmp/mysql.sock to
wherever it is as a test.

Hope that helps.

Chris

I'll bet you a beer that either 
   a)  one or more include/require statements have an @ in front of it to 
supress errors (which has the unfortunate consequence of supressing all 
subsequent errors in that and sub-included files.
   b)  the one or more of the mysql* functions have an @ in front of them.

I'll then bet you another beer that there are problems connecting to the 
database.  Have the MySQL permissions been properly set up and flushed?  
Do the scripts have the right user/password/db names?

Enjoy,

Oh yes, as you now see, phpBB could be better thought out and still has
bugs.  I can't count how many cross site scripting and even SQL injection 
vulnerabilities they've put in there.  Hmm, know what, I CAN count...

http://www.securityfocus.com/search
search area  "Vulnerabilities"
search for   "phpbb"

Drum roll please...  24!  The latest one is as recent as this month!

So, BE CAREFUL!

Heh,

I think security is the *least* of his worries, considering that his Apache 
setup is not parsing .inc's or limiting their access, that his phpMyAdmin 
page is not password protected, that he hasn't set the MySQL root password, 
and he's letting a random guy he just met probe his entire server in search 
of a phpBB bug.   : )

That is intriguing.
It looks like more fun for somebody who is used to Zope/ZPT already, but 
I like the featureset enough to give it a try on something.

I spent a little time reading doc at Zope (always dangerous) and began 
to wonder if it would be possible to build a ZEO/ZODB client in PHP. 
Persistant objects with transactions, subtransactions, and undo sound 
like they might be fun to play with. How can?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] NYPHP List Reorganization?
Message-ID: <3F72DF09.6090503@nyphp.org>



Hi all,

Whew, I think we'll need another server to support all the list's posts :)  Seeing this type of enthusiasm from the community is fantastic, and questions, discussions, and the back-and-forth is what mailing lists, and NY, is all about.

When NYPHP-Talk first started there was very little traffic and participation (actually, none :), and so a general "any topic goes" viewpoint has worked very well.  Obviously, in just a year, it's grown to be a high-traffic and vibrant channel of communication.

However, it may be beginning to outgrow it's usefulness for some, and we want to be sure to address the needs of the entire community.  So, I'm throwing out the notion that it's time for another list, dedicated to the strict technical discussion of PHP/AMP Technology, and other closely related topics.  Topics would include Apache/MySQL/PHP of course, any related installation/system-administration/security topics, any application written in PHP, and any PHP extension/variant (so, Oracle, PostgreSQL, CLI, GD, etc).  Casual chat or posts, and other topics, wouldn't be included.

And, since we do have such a diverse and knowledgeable community, NYPHP-Talk would be the place for any type of general web discussion, chat, and so forth (thus, falling inline with it's original name, 'Talk').  This organization would allow people to get their tough technical questions answered (on the new list, should we call it NYPHP-AMP ?), by probably the best AMP related lists in the world I might add, while avoiding much of the additional traffic related to other web development technologies, NY, political and other discussions.

I've been hesitant to bring this up in the past simply because I didn't want to discourage people from using the lists, and divide the traffic up to the point that things fall dead.  And, with so many varied topics, it wouldn't be good to make people afraid to post, and asking themselves questions "is this the right list to post?".  Maybe some could assist in drafting well-worded list policies, that would eliminate this ambiguity and clearly depict what topics the lists are geared towards.

Lastly, with the recent addition of the front-end list (http://lists.nyphp.org for those who haven't joined yet) we'd have a complete and very knowledgeable set of real time resources for the community to use.  And, with all lists available as digests (also available via http://lists.nyphp.org), having the traffic organized a little may strike a nice balance for people.  I'm eager to hear thoughts on this, either on this list or in private, and if I get a general +1 on this, I'll have the new list this afternoon (and if anyone has any notes/ideas to pass on about mailing list policies and guidelines, I it'd be a very valuable addition).

It's a pleasure to be on this list, and to have seen it grow into a resource for so many.  Thanks all,

Hans Zaunere

Nothing obvious, but here are a couple crazy ideas:

-- put MySQL into logging mode and tail -f mysql.log to what, if any, queries are getting run.  You should be able to map those queries back into the code and see exactly where it's dieing.

-- while watching the apache error logs, a trigger_error('TEST'); is visible?  Just be sure the PHP logs aren't going somewhere else.

here is what i would test:

* design an index.php page that simply connects + selects a table from
phpbb_(table) with a simple query like "select username from phpbb_users"
... if it works you know the db is ok.

* the problem probably lies in the /template area, do the default subSilver
templates work ok?  if so, then try debugging the templates making sure that
overall_header + overall_footer match up and table tags are properly closed.

how id picture it working (without attributes):

$handle = fopen("file.xml", "r");
while ($sub = fgetxml($handle, "<root>")) {
     print "$sub[name] $sub[url]";
}

<root>

as for CVS/MYSQL use the syntax LOAD DATA INFILE as described here (keep in

Well, with SimpleXML in PHP 5, you can do something like

$handle = simplexml_load_file('file.xml');
foreach ($handle as $root) {
    print "$root->name $root->url";
}

ah ok ... i think this was covered in one meeting ... can u recap a few ?'s
for me (i havent actually tried it yet - just look @ the cvs notes -
http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/pecl/simplexml/simplexml.c):

* so the array to the element can go down as far as you want? ie:
$root->node1->node2->node3->node4->node5

* there is only load_file (local) + load_string (content) will there be
load_resource or something to let you pull in other streams? although i
guess you could still pull off something like
simplexml_load_string(file_get_contents(url)) is that the idea? ...

Message-ID: <BAY2-F93pSFd8xHpEbS0003502f@hotmail.com>

Dan, Chris, Jon & Hans,

Thanks for all the suggestions, I confirmed the following based on your 
feedback:

- Hunted down all "@" suppressions, not only in the DB abstraction class, 
but in include statements.
- Confirmed that other PHP errors - like missing semicolons - are being 
logged in Apache's error_log
- Created a dummy page to connect to MySQL myself, I couldn't connect this 
way either, although I was able to from the command line client.

Based on the third test, the dummy page with a simple connect, I'm assuming 
the problem is in the way PHP is set up to interact with MySQL.  I've noted 
that phpMyAdmin is configured to use TCP and not the socket, so I've got an 
email in to the guy to confirm with his host or admin whether there is a 
specific connection string that needs to be used and/or whether they are 
able to connect themselves.

Thanks again guys,
-Dan

Hans,

Would a 'subject' guideline work?  For example, if I wanted to ask an 
AMP question -- first word of the subject line would be:
PHP class question
php and XML feedback
MySQL problem with connects
Apache virtual host question
postgreSQL information

etc...

Then, perhaps a 'steering script' could direct the question/comment to 
[AMP] list.  All subject lines that don't meet that criteria would be 
directed to "talk".  It might also serve to remind people (if they are 
programmers -- they should be thinking logically anyway :)  to give some 
thought to their question/comment ala Eric Raymond's famous "How to ask 
a question" document.  This could be stated as a simple policy for 
posting to the lists.

just some thoughts from out west...

Message-ID: <3F730431.60901@netzero.com>

Hello,
A couple of days ago I wrote asking about sessions and objects.  Per 
David's suggestion I am storing objects in the session and calling them 
by reference, but when I get to the next page, my objects have 
disappeared.  In fact all of my session has disappeared.  When I try to 
login a user it works fine and all of the session info is present at the 
end of the script.  When I click on a link to the next page the session 
is empty.  All pages are starting the session through an included file. 
  Any ideas as to what is killing my session?

Thanks,
Scott Mattocks

IIRC the load_file routine uses the underlying streams support, so you
should be able to use it for whatever stream types are supported:

simplexml_load_file('http://www.example.com/my.xml');
simplexml_load_file('compress.bzip2://my.xml.bz2');

and so on...

That's what I thought, too.  But apparently Apache.com is it's own entity.

I think you will want to change your perspective a bit about the possible
problems that would result in this behavior. The session may very well be alive
and well, but if the client doesn't properly identify itself on the next
request, PHP will have no idea that there is a session for this client.

So, you want to test for different possibilities:

1. The session is in fact gone for some reason.
2. The client fails to pass PHPSESSID (or whatever you may have named it).
3. Both 1 and 2.
4. Something else specific to your session management mechanism.

Hope that helps.

Chris

This is certainly something we ineveitably want to arrive at (ie, when we finally have our own mailing list system finalized) but with Mailman now I'm not sure it's doable.  For now, unfortunately, the best we could do would be to add another list, and concisely define posting guidelines for it, with Talk being the catch-all list.

I've had mixed responses as to whether adding another list is good or not, so I still don't know what to do.  Perhaps we should be totally democratic about it and have a vote?

Although I am in favor of having a separate list, I can give you a reason why
some people do not favor this type of idea (it has come up a lot on php.net
mailing list discussions). The fear is that all of the "smart" people will
migrate to the advanced/on-topic/whatever list that is being proposed, and the
other list's usefulness will deteriorate, and it will die.

If we do create an on-topic list, I can pretty much guarantee that I will
subscribe to it and drop this one. My time is valuable to me, and while I like
to contribute back to the PHP community by answering questions whenever I have
the time, it is not worth it for me to wade through off-topic discussions and
people asking questions without giving any personal attempt at solving their
own problem.

So, I would see the choices as:

1. Enforce that this list remain on-topic.
2. Create an on-topic list.

Given these choices, either is fine for me, because I will choose to be
subscribed to the on-topic list in either case. It makes no difference to me if
others have a list where they can chat casually (and I have nothing against the
idea at all).

But, that's just my perspective, of course. :-)

Meh, my precious scroll key finger isn't that abused by off topic 
posts, there really aren't enough to warrant the diversion of resources 
from some more worthy project to solve the "problem". As I mentioned at 
the meeting, probably the best first phundamentals should be a how to 
filter your email tutorial, since most of the list-based 
dissatisfaction comes from people who apparently don't. I'm not going 
to volunteer for this phundamental however because I do not know or

Somehow the session cookie is not getting set.  A new session id is 
being created on every page load.  The constant SID is available which 
means that the cookie wasn't set right.  Is there a way to determine why 
the cookie isn't set?  The browser is set to accept all cookies.

I largely, if not wholly, agree with Chris, particularly where it
involves "people asking questions without giving any personal attempt at
solving their own problem."

A question or two for a newbie is ok, but it often seems as though the
list is used in lieu of the PHP (or other) Manual.
Often I refer to the manual to answer someone's question, and that is
just wrong.

I think that the front-end list is a bit of a stretch, but at least it's
separate (and I do subscribe to it). There are other lists available for
problems/questions concering apache, mysql, etc, specific problems.

I suppose, for example, apache specific questions could be relegated to
an apache at lists.nyphp.org list, which people who have no apache interest
could not subscribe to.

While I admit that I've asked an off-topic question or two and I don't
have an issue with a call for off-topic help, I think these threads
should go off-list as soon as possible.

Well, there is accepting, and there is returning. It is possible that the
client is accepting the cookie just fine but for some reason is not returning
the cookie in the next request. There are several attributes that can be
associated with a cookie, and these generally restrict the cases in which a
client will send them in a request.

So, the first test might be to turn on "warnings" or whatever your browser
calls them and carefully inspect the cookie that is being set. Check things
like this:

1. Path
2. Domain
3. Expires
4. Secure

A lack of an attribute generally means a lack of the associated restriction,
except in the case of Path, which defaults to the path of the resource sending
the cookie.

You can get a more general overview of cookies here:

Hope that helps.

Browser cookie preferences could be a problem.
Cookie path could be a problem.

But, my preference is to avoid all these problems by passing session ID's 
in the HTML itself.

Perhaps we could have a web page, and ask people to read it
before signing up.

Then members of the list could have a form letter that has a
link to the "etiquette" page. Replying with a form would
just take a 'couple' of clicks and could be a kindler and
gentler RTFM.

Anyway I think the members should police the list instead of
creating an elite list.

Why not consider adding a Forum section to the NYPHP site? In it you could 
set up multiple sections, with multiple topics, moderated or unmoderated. 
So instead of, or in addition to, keeping up by way of mailing lists, a 
member could visit the forum and browse through the sections/topics by 
thread, etc. according to interest.

As I see it, a forum behaves like a "market" in a way, in that popularity 
of, and replies to, postings will be determined by the interest a forum 
visitor has in the thread. If someone posts a question etc. and nobody 
replies, then that just indicates that (a) no-one knows the answer, (b) 
no-one is interested, or (c) "you name it" reason. To me, that's quite 
fair, but even so, overall the forum page gives a quick idea about the 
direction(s) that discussion(s) are going in.

I have seen a "free" product that seems (at first glance) to be well put 
together - http://www.invisionboard.com/ Perhaps it's worth looking at... 
(I have no connection with them).

ahh.. someone finally "gets it".

What is happening here is that NYPHP is having a "good problem" -- 
growing pains.   Some of the most memorable people in my life have been 
the truly gifted ones who have taken the time to help me with something 
I didn't understand -- and for the record, I'm 57 years old and have had 
plenty of help.

a list that is self-regulating (it's ok to simply ignore people who 
abuse it, etc) is the way to go IMHO

The volume on this list doesn't seem so high to me.

How so?  If you're talking about the quality of some of the questions 
posted, that would then wind up being the problem on any new list -- 
unless of course said list has a restricted membership.

Considering the turn of events yesterday with Mr. Powell, it seems the 
community can police itself.

That's what this list already is.

I'll second the idea of forums. They are much more effective ( however, much
younger) and easier to manage than mailing lists. I am an active member of
quite a few forums, related to web design/programming on the net. One of the
most popular ones is Site Point Forums, http://www.sitepointforums.com/
which caters to 28,784 members. And another one is www.webdesignforums.net I
also run and manage a few forums, including my own sites and my employer's
site.

There are quite a few forum packages for AMP environment. 
phpBB, www.phpbb.com , and Invision Power Boards, two of the top free ones. 
vBulletin, www.vbulletin.com, the best commercial one. I run vBulletin on my
site because of its stability and the availability of support.

I think this solution should be looked into, if not deployed on NYPHP.

I concur with the opinion that the status quo seems to be working ok.

There's the moderately OT aside now and then ("Can I bring my bicycle to
Digital Pulp?"), which the very name 'talk' doesn't discourage (as Hans
has pointed out), but nobody seems to have a problem with that. And yes,
when somebody started taxing the community's patience, the community dealt
with it.

I agree with John. The chatter around the serious questions is the soul 
of this list, it creates a very welcoming environment. People will abuse 
it for sure-- but out of ignorance, not maliciousness.

And now...for my 2 cents.

Sometimes the correct phrasing of the question has to do with the
"experience level" of the person asking the question. If you are just
learning a language, you don't yet know the terminology and therefore
don't quite know how to phrase the question.

However, following such rules as RTFM; checking Google, and so forth,
may help someone to understand how to phrase the question (assuming they
did not find the answer they were looking for).

I'd have to agree with Dan.

How so?  If you're talking about the quality of some of the questions 
posted, that would then wind up being the problem on any new list -- 
unless of course said list has a restricted membership.

Considering the turn of events yesterday with Mr. Powell, it seems the

Earlier I wrote that we could have a kinder and gentler RTFM
message.

I was thinking of something like this:

==========
"The reason you got the 'whatever' error was because your
php.ini wasn't configured correctly."

Did you know that you might have been able to solve this
yourself by entering "phundamentals 'whatever' error
site:www.nyphp.org" in the Google search box?
============

I think something like the above would reinforce nyphp as a
resource for finding out more about PHP and still encourage
people to do some homework before asking questions.

I am not suggesting that we say 'go Google on that first,
before asking that kind of question' because it would turn
people way from the site which is a good source of help.

Another problem with telling people to Google for the
answers to their questions is, as Jeff Siegel pointed out,
they may have trouble expressing what the problem is.

Along the same lines, if they are new to the language they
may have trouble sifting through all the stuff that comes
back from a Google query to find what is relevant to them.

Hmm, I wonder if there's a presentation idea in there: "The Art of
RTFM/STFW"

One could start by sort of logging a few incidents of successful
RTFM/STFW, i.e., that didn't result in posting any question, and there
you'd have a few examples. I could contribute a little story about how I
learned how to sort multidimensional arrays all by myself today (well ok,
with a little help from Google when
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.array-multisort.php didn't do it for
me)

IMHO, there's nothing wrong with a WAMP question. One of PHP's
strengths is that you can get it up and running on *both* Unix and
Windows.

In fact, because many people don't use Windows with PHP is actually
all the more reason to encourage PHP Windows questions. It's much
harder to find quality information on this topic, so I'm not surprised
when the subject generates queries. (Running PHP on Windows is like
a dog walking on two legs; you're not impressed with how well he's
doing it, but that's he's able to do it at all.)

In a (somewhat) related note from another post, this *is* NYPHP
Talk. I hope people ask questions about bringing their bicycle to the
monthly meeting because then it means they're actually going to the
meeting!  (Unlike me, who had to miss it this month. Shame, shame.)

Despite my earlier rant, I actually have a pretty large definition of
what qualifies as on topic. And if it's totally off-topic, then like
it when you pretend that you're making an attempt to stay on topic. :)

Hans,
i have been a quiet, proud member of nyphp.org since last year and i thought
i'd add my 2 cents to this topic for what its worth!

first, its a ugly job having to police human behavior - i manage a database
of technical troubleshooting tips at work and its a constant battle to keep
subject lines 'neat' and contributions 'clean' and so forth.   i think some
people just cant or wont follow basic instructions and guidelines. from this
technical group and others i am annoyed when people cant click on the
appropriate link for the simpliest task 'remove from list'.  i mutter
'moran' or some other colorful word and then i use my delete key! that's
probably where some tolerance kicks in for those of us that continue to hang
out.

 i replied once to someone who had accidently posted a php question to
nyphp-dev which prompted a gentle reminder of the list purpose from you...i
remember wondering how to get the thread redirected, so i just abandoned it
altogether!

guidelines for posts are fair and reasonable, select the police if its
necessary, gentle reminders are helpful to some and annoying to others.
encourage tolerance.

i have used forums before... the thread searchability is a nice feature but
again as many have mentioned my inquiry results are based on my ability to
articulate the technical verbage.  i use google, i cherish my 'bibles' and
reference manuals, i ask my friends and coworkers, i read the posts with
nyphp & other groups.... then if i get code working or have experience, i
share.  i have posted replies here when i noticed some basic research was
available, and possible overlooked.  ...i think it shows the diversity of
skill level of your members.

i joined an online group once that strictly used the word "off topic" when
posts werent within the designated guidelines, plus there was an automated
monthly pre-scripted message regarding the membership rules & guidelines...
once in a while the 'police force' posted "enough already" or helped steer
the group discussion... sometimes i had time to read those off topic posts.
the guideline reminder was helpful in the infancy of my membership. the
delete key or filtering is always the members option.

the recent question about bringing a bicycle to the meeting seemed important
to the attendee... i regret i dont live in the area to attend.  the question
seemed reasonable enough and i have enjoyed reading where you all are
heading for dinner or drinks and what train you might take.... but thats
because i find all you  'geeks' interesting. moving this type of discussion
to another location would make it less human, more technical.

lastly i have found on occasion, (yet rarely) posted questions are
unanswered...i have noticed its on or near the meeting dates - probably cuz
most of the focus is on the meeting etc.  again, its infrequent but it might
be something to be conscious of.

i trust your leadership on this so my vote is with you.
i hope if you do start another elite group you invite the current members
that have supported you from nearly the start!
keep up the good work!  ;)
respectfully,
deedee


P.S.   is this thread of discussion...'NYPHP List Reorganization?' or 'AMP
comments' ?

Morning all,

I just tried a little test:  
>From a file in a public directory I included a file located in a file
that is restricted with .htaccess.  I was hoping that I might be asked
to authenticate, but instead the file was included normally.

So, is there any way to make php use apache's authentication in this
kind of situation?

Don't knock yourselves out over this, I should probably figure out a
different way to accomplish my goals here anyway, I was just curious.

Thanks,
Dave

No, I need to set up public and private versions of a telephone

David,

You might want to re-think your strategy -- and look at how
you could protect your data instead of your code. You know,
let the code execute regardless of the access level of the
user. And make private numbers available only to the
suitable privileged users.

Dave:
My first thought reading that paragraph was a database table with as
many data fields as you need, and a password field.

if( $row[ 'password' ] != "" ) // if the password isn't empty
{
    // Authenticate a user
} else {
    // This is public information
}

Now you can use one select query, and just decide based on one field
of the table.  That's what I do.

It seems a little silly now, but this country was founded as a protest

When a PHP script is executing and the script is asked to include files ON
YOUR server, those file accesses will be made via the operating system,
not the web server.  Thus, .htaccess has no role to play.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] More Objects in Sessions
Message-ID: <3F74541E.2@netzero.com>

Hello,
Ok, so I have these objects that have other objects as attributes.  I 
can't get the second object to come out of the session properly.  I have 
tried using __sleep and __wakeup to serialize/unserialize but the object 
loses its methods and is pretty much useless.  I have a class method 
that can recreate the second object but it won't recreate it properly if 
called within the class itself.  ex:
// In the class definition
function __wakeup () {
	unset($this->secondObj);
	$this->createSecondObj();
	return array();
}  // This does not work!?

// In my script that uses object
$obj =& $_SESSION['obj'];
unset($obj->secondObj);
$obj->createSecondObj();  // Works fine but I don't like it!

Any ideas how to fix this?
Thanks,
Scott Mattocks

I'm starting a site that's going to have a newsletter. I was planning 
on sending a confirmation to the users who give their email data, 
something that required them to click on a link to confirm their entry 
to the list. Something simple like:

You have signed up for the CollestSiteEver Newletter. To confirm, click 
below

http://example.com/emailsignup.php?id=randomizedstring


But I recently heard that this type of email was sure to get caught by 
spam filters on most major servers.

Anyone have experience with this? Tips?

thanks.

Out of about 15 posts on the topic, there's 30 different viewpoints, which is good. Thank you for the suggestions, now someone just make a decision :)

I'm not sure where the notion of an elite list came from, but a NYPHP-AMP would be nothing of the sort - it'd be simply a more poignant list for a specific set of topics.  However, as has correctly been pointed out, it'd probably take away from this list.

The "problem" that I suggested needed to be solved was not that of the occasional off-topic post; afterall, this is the "Talk list" and a community needs to communicate.  But, I do see a large turnover on subscriptions/unsubscriptions and I think it's important that those who are looking for a poignant technical resource be able to have it.  True, mail filtering makes this less of a problem, but one of the core reasons NYPHP exists is to help support PHP, etc. and make it easy for new users and experts alike to quickly find the resources they need.  It can be difficult enough to adopt/learn a new technology, without wading through a lot of email (whether it be off-topic or on).  I think NYPHP should be as accomodative as possible to users (afterall, PHP is brand new in the grand scheme of programming languages), while retaining a casual community atmosphere that has been NYPHP from the start.

I think the general consensus has been to *not* grow another list, but other, possibly better options, have surfaced.

Somethings to consider for future development:
   -- having the list be "subject line aware"
   -- maintain a listing of poingant answers/questions, allowing list regulars to refer others to them (a FAQ of sorts)
   -- build a repository of member's "Favorite Posts" or a "Top 10"
   -- integrating tips in posts, where people can mark sections of posts as valuable for future reference

These are fine ideas, and will be developed, but would certainly require some time before they can fully be implemented.

Two other topics, however, have been voiced in the past, and perhaps they're ready for primetime.  Web forums have come up a lot, but implementing them has gotten lost in the shuffle.  A few suggestions have been made:

-- http://www.phpbb.com
-- http://www.invisionboard.com
-- http://www.vbulletin.com

Of these, or others people have had a positive experience with, which could we go with?  Using a commercial product is fine since quality and functionality of the forum is paramount.  After we decide on a forum application, I'll look at getting it online.

Lastly, the notion of list guidelines and suggestions is something we're sorely lacking, and something almost all other lists have.  I have some ideas myself, but I'm sure others have better ideas on this than I.  Please contact me if you can pass on some ideas and suggestions for putting this together.

Thanks all,

Hans

Not too much help I'm afraid, but when I use my Yahoo! email account and get confirmation messages, they don't end up marked as spam.

It's true that SpamAssassin will tag many messages of that type as spam.

Yet Mailman's confirmations, which are essentially the same thing, 
aren't tagged as spam. Take a look at a confirmation message from 
Mailman, such as you might receive when signing up for this list, and 
ask yourself why? Pay attention to the headers and the amount of 
information included in the message.

When you are ready to start testing your application, sign up for an 
email account that is protected by SpamAssassin, or use one of the many 
test scripts out there that will run an email through the filters to see 
how it scores. It isn't too hard to come up with an honest format. After 
all, this kind of opt-in is exactly what your application should be doing.

I do this exact thing when my students create accounts on my website.
Some, but not all, AOL users never get the e-mail.  I'm not quite sure
what causes this, whether it's me or AOL, but as far as I can tell,
AOL is the only domain where these messages don't get through.  The
script is at http://turing.matcmp.ncc.edu/~cmerlo/accounts/new.php, if
you want to look at the code.

Tried it, and my ISP says it probably isn't spam:

X-Spam-Report:  Content analysis details:   (score = -1.60, score threshold = 5)
  BAYES_30           (-1.6 points) BODY: Bayesian classifier says spam probability is 30 to 40%
  [score: 0.3935]

Not sure why AOL would reject it.

Some possible trouble spots that I've seen in other messages are the 
language "someone (possibly you)" and the URL with an  identifier that 
looks like an MD5 hash.

If you really want figure out what's going on, and you have some willing 
students with AOL accounts, you could try tweaking both of those to see 
if the messages go through without them.

Anybody out there having luck with CVS and Zend 3.0 on a Windoze system? I
am using CVS 1.11. My Zend is installed in C:\Zend. My local repository is
F:\data\repository, and that's the setting I put in the CVS Root field of
the checkout dialog (it's also what my CVSROOT environment variable is set
to).

When I try checkout, I get:

 	cvs.exe [checkout aborted]: no such host F

Weird thing is, the first time I tried a checkout, it worked, but
I could not commit, so I started fiddling and now I can't checkout
either. Just for laughs I tried restarting Zend -- no dice.

I've tried different permutations of using my own cvs.exe rather than the
one in zend/bin; using forward slashes instead of backslashes; feeding it
a "-d F:\data\repository" switch.

I am otherwise able to use CVS with both WinCVS and the command line,
so it seems like the issue is with Zend. No luck with the Zend
documentations, forums, or Google.


Hope this ain't too OT. TIA.

Nevermind.

I figured it out (I think). Gotta use Unix style paths. Duh, no wonder it
was giving me a hard time about "host" when it saw the colon.

Surely there must be some syntax to make it happy... file://blablabla/bla
perhaps. Otherwise, you have to have your zend/cvs and your local
repository on the same partition if you're on Win32.

Sorry for the trouble.

Scott,

It's hard for me to guess given my experience level and the amount of info
provided, so I tried to reproduce the problem just for kicks (I need to up
my karmic bank balance here anyway (-: ), and there was no problem. It
occurs to me to suggest that you be sure to pass in your objects by
reference, and also assign them by reference. Here's a snippet by way of
example. (btw I'm told that in PHP 5 objects will be passed by reference
automatically.) HTH.

<?php
class Thing {

	var $attribute;
	function Thing(&$attribute)  {
		$this->attribute =& $attribute;
	}

}

class Attribute {

	var $whatever = "I'm an attribute";

	function wassup() {
		echo "wassup yo?\n<";
	}
}

session_start();

if (isset($_SESSION['thing'])) {
	$thing =& $_SESSION['thing'];
	echo "there's a thing in the session";
} else {
	echo "there's no thing in the session. so let's make one... ";
	$attrib = new Attribute();
	$thing = new Thing($attrib);
	$_SESSION['thing'] =& $thing;
}
?>
<pre><?php print_r($thing); ?>
Testing thing's attribute's wassup method:
<?=$thing->attribute->wassup() ?>
</pre>
<? //session_destroy(); ?>

I haven't even gotten that far. Yesterday I had thought I had licked the
problem I was having with the IDE (didn't seem to want to read my
keystrokes...trouble shutting down, etc.) but it seemed that the longer
the app was running the more likely the problems would resurface.
So....I ended up uninstalling it for now and going back to ver. 2.6.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Zend IDE and CVS on Win32



Anybody out there having luck with CVS and Zend 3.0 on a Windoze system?
I
am using CVS 1.11. My Zend is installed in C:\Zend. My local repository
is
F:\data\repository, and that's the setting I put in the CVS Root field
of
the checkout dialog (it's also what my CVSROOT environment variable is
set
to).

When I try checkout, I get:

 	cvs.exe [checkout aborted]: no such host F

Weird thing is, the first time I tried a checkout, it worked, but
I could not commit, so I started fiddling and now I can't checkout
either. Just for laughs I tried restarting Zend -- no dice.

I've tried different permutations of using my own cvs.exe rather than
the
one in zend/bin; using forward slashes instead of backslashes; feeding
it
a "-d F:\data\repository" switch.

I am otherwise able to use CVS with both WinCVS and the command line,
so it seems like the issue is with Zend. No luck with the Zend
documentations, forums, or Google.


Hope this ain't too OT. TIA.

It might be useful to provide info in a "Welcome to the NYPHP mailing
list" upon signing up to the list.  I am by no means an expert in
netiquette and would find it helpful to read some information how to
effectively use the mailing list as an 'additional' resource.

Not to insult the readers intelligence nor scare off newer users from
even posting to the list.  But maybe info on how to trim response posts
for readability and how to effectively ask questions (steps taken
already, code examples, etc.).

Just a thought that occurred to me while reading Tim's response.  I'll
leave it to the mailing list veterans to fill in any blanks or
oversights.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP and Cookies.. AGAIN!
Message-ID: <0df401c3864a$cc82ec60$67a76244@philofsoa>

ok I have a question maybe this might help
if you have $_COOKIE['nordicnet_registration'] that is a session cookie in path '/' 
 you also have a cookie $_COOKIE['nordicnet_bestilling'] that is a 24-hour timed cookie in path '/'
what is the behavior of BOTH cookies?

I need to know this because the scope of the "bestilling" cookie is to be a 24-hour timed cookie used in the shopping cart process.  However, the scope of the cookie has been erratic.  If I as a user order an item, it adds it to my cart db, however, the bestilling_id is not the correct value; it turns out to be the value of the deleted cookie of the prior session!

Can someone help make sense out of this?  I am having cookie trouble again in PHP.

Message-ID: <0e3301c38654$a7329230$67a76244@philofsoa>

I need a back-to-basics shopping cart tutorial in PHP/mySQL.  I thought I had it down and I failed, as usual. Here is what I mapped out as a spec:

3) initial work on bestilling.php to contain the following plan:

 1) Cookie: 'nordicnet_bestilling' to contain unique, random 16-char string
 2) Table: nnet_produkt_bestilling to contain ordering information bundled by
           unique bestilling_id (16-char string)
  a) produkt_id
  b) farge_id
  c) storrelse_id
  d) quantity ordered
  e) bestilling_id
  f) nordicnet_registration_number
 3) *PROPOSAL* To make cookie a timed cookie - if user does not check out in X hours
    the cookie will be deleted
 4) *PROPOSAL* CRON-based PHP script to systemically wipe out any stray rows in
    nnet_produkt_bestilling that have not yet been checked out
 5) Idea plan for bestilling:
  a) User will order produkt in vis_varegruppen.php
  b) bestilling.php will do server-side checking of produkt, farge, storrelse
     and quantity based upon entry in nnet_produkt_farge_storrelse_assoc
  c) bestilling.php will then check if $_COOKIE['nordicnet_bestilling'] 
     already exists (meaning you have an order # - or, a cart ('bestill')
  d) If you have a cart then check if there is already a row in
     nnet_produkt_bestilling with same produkt_id/farge_id/storrelse_id with your
     matching bestilling_id
  e) If so then increase quantity ordered by the quantity you ordered and check
     quantity totals against nnet_produkt_farge_storrelse_assoc
  f) If NOT then add new row with produkt_id, farge_id, storrelse_id and
     quantity with your bestilling_id and registration number
  g) -- If you do NOT have a cart (no cookie) then generate a new cart (bestilling)
     id into a cookie
  h) If other people ordered the same item be sure to check their quantities
     ordered against yours and what is in stock before proceeding

So far this is what happens:

1) I enter products into the cart
2) If I delete items from the cart, they can be deleted; if I delete all items from my cart, the cart cookie is deleted, I think.
3) I try to re-enter the same item into the cart, it inserts into the db w/ a NULL value for 'nnet_user_bestilling_id' which is
    the cart id (which it's not supposed to do) and browser-side logic fails, you get the wrong screen and all kinds of garbage I cannot even go into because it's in Norwegian

I have tried for nearly 24 hours to build a cart and I can't seem to get it done.  I really need some help.

Hey folks,

LIPHP will be meeting tomorrow, 9/29/2003, at 8pm in Hauppauge.  This is the
first month of our new day and time (we are now the last MONDAY of every
month @ 8PM).  In addition, this month (and this month only) we are meeting
at headquarters of Bascom Global Internet Services, Inc. (also in
Hauppauge), so they may give us a demonstration of their products which
utilize PHP.  Directions to Bascom are here:

http://www.bascom.com/contactus.shtml

Or, you may just come to usually meeting place at Desktop Solutions, and we
may all go together.  If you choose to meet me at  Desktop Solutions, please
be there by 7:40 the latest, so we may get to Bascom on time.  Directions to
Desktop Solutions and other LIPHP info is here:

http://www.liphp.org/


Thanks to Bob and everyone at Bascom for inviting us in for the
demonstration.  Please reply to the list or me directly just so we can get a
general idea of how many will attend.  Our favorite attendee, Krispy Kremes,
will, of course, attend. :-)

Both newbies and veterans alike are always welcome, and we will still be
fielding/talking about all things PHP at this meeting, so come on down!

See you tomorrow,

Tom

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Need Hardware for PHP Code Cache / Accelerator
	Benchmarking
Message-ID: <NFBBJNKBNKCIKGKJIFPJOEFBGMAA.sklar@sklar.com>

One of the books that I'm writing right now has a section on PHP code caches
/ accelerators. I'd like to include some comparative benchmarks in the book
that explore the performance of the different accelerators in various
circumstances.

To do the benchmarking properly, though, I need some computers that I don't
have, namely a relatively beefy server on a network with a bunch of client
computers that can bombard the server with requests. Perhaps someone has a
setup like this that I could run some benchmarks on?

I am most interested in the relative performance of the accelerators, not
their absolute performance, so the server doesn't have to be anything really
beefy, just powerful enough that it doesn't run into problems that are
unlikely in the real world (like swapping web server processes to disk when
handling five simultaneous requests).

The server should be running Linux (although the presence of a Windows
server as well would be a bonus) and the client computers can be running
just about anything, as long as they can handle one of the zillion web
stress tools out there. The server must be configurable so that while the
benchmarks are running, there are no other variable-load programs running
(i.e. a mail, DNS, or active web server is no good.) Remote (ssh) access to
the machines would be most convenient for me, but if you're in Manhattan,
on-site access is OK, too. I can pay you in thanks, acknowledgement in the
book, and a free copy or three of the book.

Thanks (in advance :),
David

Let me see if I can get you access to an intranet I help manage. The
web farm is all copper Gig-E, the 3 main servers are dual Xeons with
scsi-3 disk subsystems, and 2G RAM. I believe that I can get access to
a part of the compute farm for clients, possibly 100-150 nodes, 100Mb connections.
I'll know in 24 hrs if I can get past corporate politics in this particular
case. Too bad I couldn't get you access here at BNL. There's a linux farm

Very nice, reminds me of my old days at working for
New York Realty dot com.   It was straight PHP with Oracle.

Too bad the company laid me off and other developers.  They were
one of the very first sites on the web giving this kind of service
to New York area.

Hope your service does better. G'luck!

Hey PHPers,

Just thought you guys would like to glance at a sizable all PHP site we just
launched through our entronic brand.  It incorporates
use of Flash talking to PHP and MYSQL.

Dan's right, it's totally having to be custom-built due to the unusual nature of the site and all, not to mention the learning curve I would have to endure to use oscommerce anyway.

It's coming along ok now a few bugs here and there to fix up; again, proving that my "hammering process" in learning will eventually pay off; I can't even explain what I did to fix the cart!

    Subject: [nycphp-talk] shopping cart help


    I need a back-to-basics shopping cart tutorial in PHP/mySQL.  I thought I had it down and I failed, as usual. Here is what I mapped out as a spec:

    3) initial work on bestilling.php to contain the following plan:

     1) Cookie: 'nordicnet_bestilling' to contain unique, random 16-char string
     2) Table: nnet_produkt_bestilling to contain ordering information bundled by
               unique bestilling_id (16-char string)
      a) produkt_id
      b) farge_id
      c) storrelse_id
      d) quantity ordered
      e) bestilling_id
      f) nordicnet_registration_number
     3) *PROPOSAL* To make cookie a timed cookie - if user does not check out in X hours
        the cookie will be deleted
     4) *PROPOSAL* CRON-based PHP script to systemically wipe out any stray rows in
        nnet_produkt_bestilling that have not yet been checked out
     5) Idea plan for bestilling:
      a) User will order produkt in vis_varegruppen.php
      b) bestilling.php will do server-side checking of produkt, farge, storrelse
         and quantity based upon entry in nnet_produkt_farge_storrelse_assoc
      c) bestilling.php will then check if $_COOKIE['nordicnet_bestilling'] 
         already exists (meaning you have an order # - or, a cart ('bestill')
      d) If you have a cart then check if there is already a row in
         nnet_produkt_bestilling with same produkt_id/farge_id/storrelse_id with your
         matching bestilling_id
      e) If so then increase quantity ordered by the quantity you ordered and check
         quantity totals against nnet_produkt_farge_storrelse_assoc
      f) If NOT then add new row with produkt_id, farge_id, storrelse_id and
         quantity with your bestilling_id and registration number
      g) -- If you do NOT have a cart (no cookie) then generate a new cart (bestilling)
         id into a cookie
      h) If other people ordered the same item be sure to check their quantities
         ordered against yours and what is in stock before proceeding

    So far this is what happens:

    1) I enter products into the cart
    2) If I delete items from the cart, they can be deleted; if I delete all items from my cart, the cart cookie is deleted, I think.
    3) I try to re-enter the same item into the cart, it inserts into the db w/ a NULL value for 'nnet_user_bestilling_id' which is
        the cart id (which it's not supposed to do) and browser-side logic fails, you get the wrong screen and all kinds of garbage I cannot even go into because it's in Norwegian

    I have tried for nearly 24 hours to build a cart and I can't seem to get it done.  I really need some help.

...am I cursed?

Another client is threatening to "delete everything" calling my work a "waste of time".  There is, however, one possible sane reason for this, and I need to get some PHP guru advice on how to handle this.

You have ordered one item and placed it into your cart.  Let's say you ordered one small black t-shirt.  Your cart will have the product_id, color_id and size_id for the small black t-shirt.  The quantity of this item is, let's say 30.  You have one in your cart, so how many are available:

1) 29
2) 30

Now let's say that while I ordered one small black t-shirt, Sven ordered 1 small black t-shirt, Anders ordered one black t-shirt, and Olov ordered one black t-shirt.  If all four of us, at one time, are all ordering the same item and putting it into our carts, how many should there be available to us:

1) 26
2) 25
3) 29
4) 30

This is where the contention comes in.  The client wants it done "FIFO" (First In First Out) meaning that whoever gets it first will subtract the quantity - but I dispute that (coming from somewhat of a Java background) that since PHP doesn't so single-threading, that means that all four of us could order t-shirts,  but the quantity has to reflect that all four of us are ordering (multi-threading).

I dunno, help!

Phil,

The way this is done in the manufacturing world is with an "inventory
allocated" field.  This field holds the number of quantity of your current
inventory that is "held" or allocated for another purpose, such as checkout.
Similar to inventory in a store, nothing should get removed from inventory
until it is sold.  What this means to you - I would decrement inventory on
the screen, and if he is that particular about it, display both the
inventory and the allocated fields.

However, with this said, personally I feel that you need to do whatever the
customer is asking for, as long as it is in the scope and budget of the
project.  As a consultant, it is your job to inform him of the risks
involved (which you have done), but ultimately do what he asks.

Phil, I hope you are doing this job for ALOT more than the last one
(architecture for $68, remember?). :-)

Good Luck!

Tom

is, let's say 30.  You have one in your cart, so how many are available:

  1) 29
  2) 30

  Now let's say that while I ordered one small black t-shirt, Sven ordered 1
small black t-shirt, Anders ordered one black t-shirt, and Olov ordered one
black t-shirt.  If all four of us, at one time, are all ordering the same
item and putting it into our carts, how many should there be available to
us:

  1) 26
  2) 25
  3) 29
  4) 30

  This is where the contention comes in.  The client wants it done "FIFO"
(First In First Out) meaning that whoever gets it first will subtract the
quantity - but I dispute that (coming from somewhat of a Java background)
that since PHP doesn't so single-threading, that means that all four of us
could order t-shirts,  but the quantity has to reflect that all four of us
are ordering (multi-threading).

  I dunno, help!

You may be right, you may be wrong, but after presenting information, if your client decides that he wants it a particular way, if at all possible, do it. He's paying you to develop his code, right? I mean, if it's in part your business it's different. Otherwise, give him what he wants. Don't worry if it's not correct, if that's what he insists on.

SimpleXML is PHP 5 only. It relies on PHP internals that are not available
in PHP 4.

Hi all,

I am encountering a situation somewhat similar to the one that Jeff was 
referring to in his post titled "Repost post vars".  Basically, I am 
using php to enforce required fields on a form, load a page that allows 
the user to confirm information is accurate (if not, reload the form 
page), and finally once all is OK, process the variables by inserting 
the data into mysql, sending an email confirmation to the user and 
loading a confirmation page.

Where I am running into problems is preserving post variables across 
the various page loads.  I saw the following solutions offered to Jeff, 
and I am wondering, as a relative newbie, which one folks would 
recommend me cutting my teeth on or are there other options that might 
be even simpler/better?

Possible solutions:
	Perform manual POST using PHP
	Use PEAR's http request class
	Use cURL
	Store $_POST as a session variable
	Use http.inc class

Thanks for any suggestions,

-Aaron

I advocate storing $_POST as a session variable. (Or the specific POST
variables you want to keep.)

You stuff the POSTed data into a temporary session and then retrieve
it out of $_SESSION in the confirmation page and MySQL insertion
page. Once it's done, session_destroy() it.

Saves you all the hassle of, well, most of the above. If you're against
cookies, there's always the URL rewriting feature of Session, which
should be easy to ensure given the nature of your transaction.

I'm all for using the simplest solution possible, unless you can't.

Cool, I'm flipping to the sessions chapter now...  I'll probably opt 
for the URL rewriting feature, as it seems there is an increasing

Only after bashing my head at least three times into a brick wall will

My advice is to try it with cookies first because it might be easier
to test. (On your machine, you don't need to worry about rejecting
cookies.)

Once that's working, add in the URL rewriting. This might not be
necessary, but when dealing with something new, I don't like to jump
in head first, as it makes it really difficult to debug.

Hey Gang,
 
After a few months of trying to figure out why we were getting sets of
maximum execution timeout errors at totally random times, I've narrowed it
down to being the result of adhoc queries that return very large datasets. I
noticed something interesting though, and I was wondering if anyone had any
information on this...
 
First of all, it's PHP build 4.3.2 running in CGI mode on Win32. We have the
max_execution_time directive set to 90 seconds, but whenever one of these
wide-open adhoc queries is executed, the spawned PHP process eats up over
90% CPU time... but for about 6 minutes in real time. This is leading me to
believe that PHP's internal timer is actually being short-changed by it's
own CPU intensive existence. :)  Anyway, it seems like what PHP "thinks" is
90 seconds is actually more like 5-10 minutes in reality. Is this a bug, a
WIN32 specific problem, both, etc... any information would be appreciated.
We are planning to cap the resources that the scripts consume in other ways
as a workaround, but in the meantime, we are experiencing periods of
excessive slowness and multiple script timeouts since other php.exe procs
seem to get held up by the initial culprit.
 
TIA,
Dave

MYSQL TIPS & HINTS

Using ORDER BY with UPDATE to resolve the
duplicate key problem

    Indrek Siitan

    To illustrate the problem, let us create a small
    sample table:
    
      CREATE TABLE items (
        id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(32)
      ); 
    
    Let's add a couple of rows as well:
    
      INSERT INTO items VALUES (1,'bar'),(2,'qux');
    
    Now, we want to add an entry named "foo" with an
    ID of 1, and shift all of the existing items up by
    one. Easy, you say - just add 1 to the id field
    values and then insert the new row:
    
      UPDATE items SET id=id+1;
      INSERT INTO items VALUES (1,'foo');
    
    In theory, everything looks fine. In real life,
    however, the UPDATE query most probably bails out
    with the following error:
    
      ERROR 1062: Duplicate entry '2' for key 1
    
    This happens because key constraints are checked
    before updating each row (with MyISAM tables that
    are non-transactional, there's no other way, and
    for some reason InnoDB follows the same path). The
    update is done in the order the rows are stored in
    the table files, which, in case you haven't mixed
    DELETEs and INSERTs and caused the table to get
    fragmented, is the order you have inserted the
    rows into the table. So if MySQL starts to process
    the first row and tries to increment the id field
    by 1, the result of 2 already exists in the table
    and produces the error above, although it would be
    increased next and the final query result would
    not violate the key uniqueness.
    
    But not to worry, MySQL has extended the UDPATE
    syntax with a possible ORDER BY clause, that will
    help us solve this problem. If we change the
    update query to:
    
    UPDATE items SET id=id+1 ORDER BY id DESC;
    
    With this ORDER BY clause, MySQL processes rows in
    descending order of id number: First, it updates 2
    to 3, and then 1 to 2.  Consequently, no
    duplicate-key violation occurs and the statement
    succeeds.
    
    The ORDER BY clause in UPDATE is available in
    MySQL server version 4.0.0 and newer.

Is row locking really necessary in multi-table
updates?

    Is row locking really necessary in a multi-table
    update, where some of the tables are only read
    during the update. Couldn't you speed up the
    updates, if the row locking would not be used?
    
    Consider the example below:
    ....
    mysql> create table table1(a int, b int) type =
    innodb;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
    
    mysql> create table table2(a int, b int) type =
    innodb;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.50 sec)
    
    mysql> insert into table1 values (10, 20);
    Query OK, 1 row affected (2.68 sec)
    
    mysql> insert into table2 values (10, 20);
    Query OK, 1 row affected (2.76 sec)
    
    mysql> update table1, table2 set table1.b = 100
    where table1.a = 
    table2.a;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (48.31 sec)
    Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
    ....
    
    If we do not lock rows in table2, then the changes
    to table1 are based on an old consistent snapshot
    of table2. If that snapshot is very old, we may
    get really unexpected update results. So it is not
    good idea to set a trap to users by removing the
    row locks on table2.
    
    When you are doing multi-table updates, you might
    run into deadlocks.
    Deadlocks are a problem that needs to be taken
    into account, when using row locking and
    transactions. The link
    http://www.innodb.com/ibman.html#Cope_with_deadlocks
    contains some help in avoiding them.

TIP: Maximum size of a BLOB

    MySQL supports BLOBs (Binary Large Objects), which
    means you can store any binary file into MySQL.
    Many people ask, what is the maximum size of a
    BLOB in MySQL.
    
    The theoretical limit in MySQL 4.0 is 2G, however
    each blob requires generally to have 3 copies of
    it in the memory (stored in various buffers) so
    you need a lot of memory, if you have large BLOBs
    stored in MySQL. This is the reason, why the
    theoretical limit can be reached only on 64bit
    systems. The Practical limits are around some
    hundreds of megs per BLOB.

Great looking site, Larry.  It's good to see PHP getting more and more use for large sites, as is deserving of it.  Another idea for nyphp.org content is a link listing of sites people in the area have rolled out with PHP.  Might be a nice way to begin a compilation of php's who's-who

I have heard things similar to this kicked around, although I don't know many specifics, unfortunately.  Win related may be an issue as well, and might surface as a bug with some finite testing.

I've seen that http://bugs.php.net reports some of these issues (search for max_execution_time).

Great point, Jon.  I saw this tip which actually I just put into practice a bit ago.

As an aside, a nice digest of the MySQL and other newsletters of the past month are always up at http://nyphp.org/thelatest

The October edition will be there tomorrow.

Thanks,

H

Yes thanx, however, the client wanted a "FIFO" solution which means that if there are 30 items in stock and you ordered all 30 while someone else ordered 1, both of you will see 30 in stock until one of you checks out; whoever checks out first, wins!

  Phil,

  The way this is done in the manufacturing world is with an "inventory allocated" field.  This field holds the number of quantity of your current inventory that is "held" or allocated for another purpose, such as checkout.  Similar to inventory in a store, nothing should get removed from inventory until it is sold.  What this means to you - I would decrement inventory on the screen, and if he is that particular about it, display both the inventory and the allocated fields.

  However, with this said, personally I feel that you need to do whatever the customer is asking for, as long as it is in the scope and budget of the project.  As a consultant, it is your job to inform him of the risks involved (which you have done), but ultimately do what he asks.

  Phil, I hope you are doing this job for ALOT more than the last one (architecture for $68, remember?). :-)

  Good Luck!

  Tom

    ...am I cursed?

    Another client is threatening to "delete everything" calling my work a "waste of time".  There is, however, one possible sane reason for this, and I need to get some PHP guru advice on how to handle this.

    You have ordered one item and placed it into your cart.  Let's say you ordered one small black t-shirt.  Your cart will have the product_id, color_id and size_id for the small black t-shirt.  The quantity of this item is, let's say 30.  You have one in your cart, so how many are available:

    1) 29
    2) 30

    Now let's say that while I ordered one small black t-shirt, Sven ordered 1 small black t-shirt, Anders ordered one black t-shirt, and Olov ordered one black t-shirt.  If all four of us, at one time, are all ordering the same item and putting it into our carts, how many should there be available to us:

    1) 26
    2) 25
    3) 29
    4) 30

    This is where the contention comes in.  The client wants it done "FIFO" (First In First Out) meaning that whoever gets it first will subtract the quantity - but I dispute that (coming from somewhat of a Java background) that since PHP doesn't so single-threading, that means that all four of us could order t-shirts,  but the quantity has to reflect that all four of us are ordering (multi-threading).

    I dunno, help!

    Phil
