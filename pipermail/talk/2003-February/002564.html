<PRE>Hans,
I may be paranoid, but I'd use a different approach (IMO more secure).
When a user logs on to the ColdFusion server generate a unique ID - session
id or something to that effect. Store it in a database with the username,
User-Agent string, and the IP address of the client. Of course that row
should be deleted when the user logs out or expired after X minutes of
inactivity. Next write a small CF script (check.cfm) that will respond only
to requests sent from the IP address matching your Linux/PHP server. This
script would take the said unique ID as a GET var and echo the associated
username, User-Agent string, and the IP address from the database.
Now when you redirect the user from the CF app to your PHP add it would be
done with a link like this one:
<A HREF="http://linux.server/verify.php?id=737b8a3cfa90cda3bc">http://linux.server/verify.php?id=737b8a3cfa90cda3bc</A>

Your verify.php would issue a request including the ID as a GET var (using
fopen) to check.cfm on your IIS/CF server. check.cfm would query the
database for the username, User-Agent string, and the IP address associated
with the ID and echo the results. The output would be captured and parsed by
verify.php. If the returned User-Agent and IP address match
$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], a PHP session is
established and the returned username is stored as a session var .. and life
is good.
Of course you may apply encoding/encryption on top of that.

Jerry

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ColdFusion Question


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>OK, no comments please  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm now incharge of CF development, and while things have been moving
</I>&quot;well&quot;
&gt;<i>there's one issue I can't seem to get past easily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Basically there is a CF app on IIS under Windows 2000 with a login process
</I>&gt;<i>that I have no control over, nor access to.  My only ability is to place a
</I>&gt;<i>link on the protected CF page that will bring the user to a PHP app on a
</I>&gt;<i>Linux server across campus, which also needs to know who the user is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The most obvious way to do this is to create the link in the CF app to
</I>&gt;<i>contain a GET variable with the username in it.  OK fine, this would work,
</I>&gt;<i>albeit weak.  Of course, we're dealing with computer illiterate medical
</I>&gt;<i>students, so 9 times out of 10 this would suffice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yet, it scares me, so I want to add a couple additional checks.  Basically
</I>my
&gt;<i>question is, how could I get a MAC address, CPU ID, or some other
</I>identifying
&gt;<i>tag (not IP) from the IIS server, which I would then pass in the URL to my
</I>&gt;<i>application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Additionally, to keep the pesky students in check, I'd like to encode the
</I>&gt;<i>information so it becomes less obvious to them what we're doing.  Ideally,
</I>&gt;<i>I'd like PHP's base64_encode() functionality.  Also, does ColdFusion have
</I>&gt;<i>anything like PHP's serialize() ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Security through obscurity, gotta love it.  Other ideas are welcome, but we
</I>&gt;<i>are dealing with a considerably limited environment.  And CF code examples
</I>&gt;<i>would be greatly appreciated  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>H
