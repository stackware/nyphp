<PRE>I have been working on an SNMP project in VB (also, no comments please...) and 
a lot of usable data is passed by an SNMP agent.  You can get a Win32 agent 
from a Win2K disk and of course there are free agents for Linux servers as 
well.  I have not looked for SNMP projects in PHP but I bet you could find 
something on Sourceforge that would suite your purposes. (Look into BER 
decoding as a start).

With the right code, you could easily obtain the MAC address of the 
originating server and check that against your MAC address on record.  
Although encryption might be difficult to handle in this case, what med 
student would be sniffing packets on port 161?

Just a thought since SNMP is new to me, but someone may have a better idea 
that would be easier to implement.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, it scares me, so I want to add a couple additional checks.  Basically

</I>&gt;<i> the URL to my application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, to keep the pesky students in check, I'd like to encode the

</I>&gt;<i> I'd like PHP's base64_encode() functionality.  Also, does ColdFusion have
</I>&gt;<i> anything like PHP's serialize() ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Security through obscurity, gotta love it.  Other ideas are welcome, but we

</I>&gt;<i> would be greatly appreciated  :)
