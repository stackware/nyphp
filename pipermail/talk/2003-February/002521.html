<PRE>Hi Carlos,
I work at a large development organization and while we don't use PHP we are
a major Microsoft house.  For configuration management we use one of two
tools, Visual SourceSafe, or ClearCase.  VSS does not support code merging
therefore only one person can work on the a specific module at a time.
ClearCase,while it does support code merging, I have no experience using it.
A third configuration management tool that I have yet to use but looks very
promising is Perforce (www.perforce.com).  I believe they allow up to two
users for free so you can try the tool out.  I know Perforce does a nice job
integrating into the development environment but that is dependent on your
tool set.

Rational Rose is a modeling tool.  If you are a strong Object Oriented
Analysis and Design shop and are strong with UML (Unified Modeling Language)
Rose could help (you will need very deep pockets to buy this tool).  While
Rose supports forward and reverse engineering (code generation/model
generation) I am not sure it supports PHP.  If you are simply looking for a
nice modeling tool I would recommend Enterprise Architect
(<A HREF="http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/">http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/</A>).  It is about 1/20 the cost of Rose and
does a nice job with the visual models.  If your company considers EA to be
too low cost and wants a company with a bigger balance sheet check out
Embarcadero's Describe (<A HREF="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/">http://www.embarcadero.com/products/</A>).

ClearQuest is Rational's workflow tool.  Unless you are well up on software
process and are looking to automate your information flow, ClearQuest is
probably not for you.

This is actually leading to an interesting question (think it was already
posted a few months ago)

What editor / development platform are you guys using?

I use Eclipse for other languages, but the php plugin is still too
pre-alpha.
Editplus I really like: lightweight, but still very beefy (regular
expression, user definable syntax &amp; auto complete...), but missing cvs, so
good only for smaller one-man projects.

Now the big challenge: I got an enterprise project (here comes the magic
word again -- let's not get religious ;).  Big team, close deadlines,
parallel development, and  I'm very convinced about using PHP for this one.

Suggestions on how to build the ultimate development platform?  What else
besides Zend should I be consider? Anybody used other software development
products with PHP (Rational Rose and ClearQuest are on my mind...)


Carlos

I've been using EditPlus <A HREF="http://www.editplus.com/,">http://www.editplus.com/,</A> a simple text editor
with
auto-complete and elementary syntax help.  It does not offer any debugging
capability.  Has anyone used the Zend Studio debugging and if so what does
it offer?

The Zend Studio offer looks inviting.

I usually do my work in a simple text editor -  metapad
(<A HREF="http://www.liquidninja.com/metapad/">http://www.liquidninja.com/metapad/</A>) in windows or Kate and Quanta
(<A HREF="http://quanta.sourceforge.net/">http://quanta.sourceforge.net/</A>) in Linux.

Do I really need this IDE?  I am comfortable in a text editor, but, I'm not
a zealot for *the purity* of it.  Obviously it is a matter of personal
choice.  I'm open to opinion/suggestion and would like to hear from others.

Then again, who could resist &quot;support your local community at the same
time.&quot;? Let me reach for my wallet. &lt;grin&gt;
