That's a good sign... at least the file is getting there... somehow.

&gt;<i> According to PHP, the file upload is taking place.  The database info

</I>&gt;<i> is verified.  Odd.
</I>
Smells like uploaded... tastes like uploaded... it must be uploaded!  So
basically, everything happens as expected, except the file isn't in the
expected directory?  Maybe the admin has changed upload directories or paths?
 What event exactly causes the upload to be realized as unsuccessful?

&gt;<i> I have contacted the sysadmin and am awaiting a response.  I am hoping to 
</I>&gt;<i> resolve the issue myself but this may not be possible.  Also, I have not
</I>&gt;<i> been able to reproduce the situation on my local machine (LAMP with PHP
</I>&gt;<i> 4.3.0, same as the host server).
</I>
It must be a sysadmin problem.  <A HREF="http://us2.php.net/ChangeLog-4.php">http://us2.php.net/ChangeLog-4.php</A> might be
handy to realize any differances between your previous version and 4.3.0, but
none come to mind off the bat.
