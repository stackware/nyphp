<PRE>Stephen,

	Sessions are OK, I guess, if you really need to keep sending
the data around, but keep in mind then, that all of that POST data
will get sent back-and-forth between the server and browser for each
successive page-load.  And if you do a &quot;Location:&quot; redirect, that
will of course count as two page loads, so that is conceivably a
waste of time and bandwidth.  Depending how your server is configured,
the additional HTTP transaction from the server might be costly if 
you do it a lot, or if your server is already busy.

	So you said you don't want to &quot;embed&quot; the 2nd script into
the first one... why not just &quot;include&quot; it?  That way, the only
additional cost of the &quot;redirect&quot; is reading and executing that
file... no extra HTTP noise (which in some cases could slow things
down by more than a few seconds per page hit).

	Overall, it sounds like you might be moving toward
building one single &quot;library&quot; file of your functions, and then your
&quot;scripts&quot; would include this library and call whatever functions it
needs.

	Also, I don't know how much data is getting POSTed, but if
it's more than a few hundred characters (or has the potential to be),
you might have problems doing Location: redirects with all that data.
I could explain this further if it doesn't make sense.


Bestest,

George Webb

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Upon a successful submission of the form on my PHP page, I use the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; header(&quot;Location: &quot;) function to redirect to another page.  I'd like
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; to carry over some form values over to the redirected page to use.  
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Is this possible?  Or is there another way to do this?  I don't think
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; it's a good idea to embed the second page into the main PHP page as
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the main PHP page will be very long.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  the easiest way is to just:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Location:  <A HREF="http://url.com/?name=value&amp;name1=value1">http://url.com/?name=value&amp;name1=value1</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  then on the corresponding grab the values in the $_GET hash.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
