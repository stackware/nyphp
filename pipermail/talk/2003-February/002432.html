I have to disagree. While I don't love dynamo, I think that it worked  
very well for what we used it for, which was 2 VERY dynamic eCommerce  
sites. It take some intelligence in using, and some care, but it can  
very easily work with javascript, and we did so all of the time. Hell,  
we even integrated it with Flash (even though we disliked Flash). As  
for how it affected the html code and rendering via whitespace, yes if  
used carelessly it did introduce problems. The reality of that is that  
it is a browser issue though, the rendering engine should ignore  
whitespace. And to be honest, it was pretty easy to work around that  
issue.

In regards to syntax highlighting, what more do you need than an editor  
that can color HTML? That's how jhtml was built to be used. I like the  
droplet methodology, and I think it works very well for separating the  
backend logic from the frontend display code.

Now, that being said. It definitely wasn't perfect, and I can't  
honestly say that there weren't times when we just embedded java into  
the page. But I think that I personally would love to see a similar  
droplet system for templating through php. I've considered developing  
just such a tool myself. I think it would work very well for a low to  
medium trafficked site.

But that's only my $0.01.
