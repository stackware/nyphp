I'm not sure what you read, but that is certainly not true.
Making a site P3P compliant is not too difficult, is very
well-documented, and can be done with vi. :-)

I should have been more specific in the URL I gave, but
here are the most important places for implementation:

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/p3pdeployment">http://www.w3.org/TR/p3pdeployment</A> - This is a good
document written by the W3C that goes through everything
involved in compliance, including some useful examples.

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/P3P/validator.html">http://www.w3.org/P3P/validator.html</A> - Like the famous HTML
and CSS validators, the W3C has this P3P validator that can
validate your privacy policy (for proper formatting) or an
entire site.

&gt;<i> IBM's tool appears free, but they also have a &quot;request
</I>&gt;<i> license&quot; link.
</I>
There may be tools that try to make things easy for you,
but they are no more necessary for writing privacy policies
than FrontPage is necessary for writing HTML. 

&gt;<i> Has anyone else created P3Ps for their sites?
</I>
Not yet, actually, but I researched the topic in detail for
a book I wrote by using sites like <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</A> as examples, since they are both
compliant.

&gt;<i> And if you need a tool, are there any good open-source
</I>&gt;<i> versions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If not, I'd be interested in developing an online,
</I>&gt;<i> form-based tool in PHP that would be available for
</I>&gt;<i> anyone to use and mirror (including the nyphp site).
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a realistic undertaking?
</I>
I think it is very realistic and would probably pretty easy
to do, if it doesn't already exist. The only challenge I
can see in P3P compliance is adhering to the proper formats
in the associated XML documents. A PHP tool could use the
latest DTD straight from the W3C Web site (I can't remember
the URL for it off-hand) to create a nice little HTML form
that describes each element and makes things a bit simpler.

Hope that helps.

Chris
