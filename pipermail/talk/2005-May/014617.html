<PRE>Looking for sponsorship (or at least publicity assistance) could be a good
idea too, like maybe presenting all the code in screen captures from the
Zend Studio or UltraEdit. 

Get Rasmus Lerdorf to do three paragraph intro (Somebody knows him good
enough).

Ultimately, even if the book didn't make it to a brick and mortar publisher.
NYPHP could easily convert the project to PDF (Adobe sponsor? Gets a blurb
touting full range of PDF capabilities.) and make available as
appropriately-priced digital download straight from NYPHP or even make a
click-through deal with Amazon.

I haven't actually joined any nyphp projects yet, so I can't 
authoritatively comment on why the project faded into oblivion, but I am 
given the impression that the current projects are large, complex, and 
require some sort of approval process to join. These barriers of entry 
are probably intimidating to a lot of people. Comittment to join a long 
term project is also intimidating, where as firing off a quick hack or 
suggestion on a mailing list is not. Small projects are simply easier to 
bite off and swallow.

You know what might work?
If once a week, a small script or real world problem is presented and 
everyone tosses out suggestions, solutions, and optimizations. OH WAIT. 
THE MAILING LIST IS JUST THAT!  (well, some of the time, heh). The 
rapidfire &quot;development cycles&quot; of mailing list chatter results in a 
optimized solution much faster than with large projects. To help guide 
content for the book, the problems should probably be hand picked. Also, 
if  people knew that they will eventually be published, they might be 
more inclined to contribute.
