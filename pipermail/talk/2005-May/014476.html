<PRE>John,

Contact Zend sales tell them your situation and i bet you they will give you 
a free upgrade. They gave me one.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for any experience-based comments or suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I bought Zend Studio Pro at version 3, and never really used it. I
</I>&gt;<i> encountered some annoyances on install (like what seemed to be a hang
</I>&gt;<i> during install, which turned out to be a hidden console window awaiting
</I>&gt;<i> a key press to continue) and difficulty getting the debugger to work
</I>&gt;<i> properly with the server (turned out to be problems with the GUI
</I>&gt;<i> labeling... we worked our way to success eventually). In the end the
</I>&gt;<i> client/server aspects from the Windows client to a Linux server were a
</I>&gt;<i> hassle. In my experience it was too slow, and not reliable for
</I>&gt;<i> interactive debugging. I never got it to work smoothly from the notebook
</I>&gt;<i> on and off the network. Because of the struggle I never fully adopted
</I>&gt;<i> the client so I admit I didn't give the IDE a good chance to impress me.
</I>&gt;<i> I still have the license for Safeguard (at v3.5) Performance Suite 3.6
</I>&gt;<i> and Studio Pro 3.0 and Encoder 3.5 Plus, according to my Zend account.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now with PHP 5 pretty widely available to me and all the progress I have
</I>&gt;<i> seen from Zend I want to try again. Sadly, it seems everything I had
</I>&gt;<i> before (still available for use) is not upgradeable to the current
</I>&gt;<i> versions. I hardly see the point in buying it again, especially now that
</I>&gt;<i> it costs even more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So then there's the trial downloads. Available to try the product --
</I>&gt;<i> seems a good idea, right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Experienced as I am (whatever that is), I fully expect that a trial of a
</I>&gt;<i> 4.x generation product, installed on my Windows machine, perhaps with
</I>&gt;<i> their Windows enhancer (whatever that is), will muck up my system if I
</I>&gt;<i> decide to use the 3.x product afterwards. You know, blind forward
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility issues and all. Anybody using the 4 or have any hands-on
</I>&gt;<i> experience that would help me out?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know about the so-called &quot;small business development&quot; plan. Even if I
</I>&gt;<i> qualified for it (gross revenue of $250k/year is hardly a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> limit for an east coast small business, even during &quot;development&quot;) the
</I>&gt;<i> same situation applies. Basically Zend is asking for between $1k and $5k
</I>&gt;<i> *per year* for their product which is not insignificant for an IDE with
</I>&gt;<i> debugger and encoder.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was a user of NuSphere's PHP-IDE for a while prior to trying Zend 3,
</I>&gt;<i> but I have never found enough bonus to the specialized IDE over UlraEdit
</I>&gt;<i> or Textpad-configured. The debugger is the draw, so if it works well
</I>&gt;<i> enough for me to be productive with it I want to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anybody care to tell me they *know* the trial versions will be a good
</I>&gt;<i> experience? Or that I should rock on with my 3.x licenses? Or to save my
</I>&gt;<i> time and continue the edit-post-refresh routine and accept that there
</I>&gt;<i> really isn't a decent interactive debugger for the independent web
</I>&gt;<i> developer?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thinks about PHP certification, which leads to Zend, which suggests
</I>&gt;<i> the IDE (again), which teases with promises of a real debugger and
</I>&gt;<i> server-side toolkit.... is it time to try again?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again.
