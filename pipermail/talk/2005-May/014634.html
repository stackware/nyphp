<PRE>I'm not new to PHP/MySQL, but have not used WordPress, but want to for a 
couple of sites. I'd love to get your perspective and guidance, 
especially as I want to customize my installs of it.

&gt;<i> I always apreciated newbie installfests and so I am willing to set one up if there is interest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WordPress is a hot blog software, written in PHP/MySQL. It is very flexible, and can be many things in addition to a standard blog. It is now at a very nice and relatively stable version 1.5.1.2 9 (as of today?) which I really like. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most of you out there are probably thinking &quot;what's to install and configure? It's so simple!&quot; and you are correct. But it's not that easy for those not actively working with all-things-php, and this is an installfest for those people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To make it even more interesting, I will suggest that while there are literally THOUSANDS of themes and templates and plug-ins available (each one promoted as the best thing since Sliced Images), there are actually not that many that are &quot;ready for prime time&quot; on the latest WP1.5.x release. So there's value to participating even if you are so 133t you can program PHP using this kick-ass keyboard <A HREF="http://peripherals.engadget.com/entry/1234000577031787/">http://peripherals.engadget.com/entry/1234000577031787/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Add to that the WordPress docs are widely dispersed and wiki-based, and there's plenty of knowledge to share.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anybody interested? Here's what I figure could happen at least once:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - bring your gear, meet at wifi friendly spot in NY or NJ
</I>&gt;<i> - have an editor, your own hosting account or use a temp one provided by (someone or some not-for-profit? Or we can NAT my T-mobile account and 0wn a Starbucks)
</I>&gt;<i> - we can intro to SVN to get and keep up with WP, or just grab the DL. I can demonstrate why you might consider the SVN nightlies... and if you don't use SVN this is an easy way to start (WP is a wide open SVN repo).
</I>&gt;<i> - there's many places to get themes and templates - I know a few good ones and few dead-ends
</I>&gt;<i> - WP is based on a controller called the WP Loop. Get an intro so you can start hacking it.
</I>&gt;<i> - The WP Codex is a vast knowledge base.. I have a set of bookmarks to start with
</I>&gt;<i> - search engine friendly? Pheh. We can fix that, too, or at least start on the path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know if you are interested, if you have ideas/preferences, or a place etc. Again I encourage those who have little experience but want to dig into WP etc cause it's really low key and low pressure to get started with WP. Of course if there are only uberstus, we could jump right to in-lining bbpress and MG2, or tying in some single sign-on for a multiblog or whatever.
