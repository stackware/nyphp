Well, it looks like I'll have to apologize to the hosting company for assuming the &quot;write them as my user&quot; was the norm. I'm a bit baffled becuase it *used* to do so, but...

The solution for me will be to let &quot;nobody&quot; write the files in the &quot;holding tank&quot; and leave them as that ownership in case someone needs to edit the file by re-entering it on the form. I will scp (easier to script than sftp) them to my local host where I have root and can edit the ownership/files at my leisure and then put them back on the remote host in the directory where they belong.

Since I own the holding directory I can delete the files when I'm done with them.

Thanks all!
