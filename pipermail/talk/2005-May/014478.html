<PRE>I was able to use 3.5 and evaluate 4 on my machine simultaneously. 
The installer created a /config_4.0 folder next to my /config_3.5
folder and didn't override any of the original 3.5 application files
(putting all the 4.0 versions is a subfolder), Of course, I don't use
windows, but I don't see why they wouldn't keep those sorts of
features the same.

On the other hand, after my 30 days were up, I ended up going back to
3.5, seeing 4.0 as too little improvement for too much money.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks in advance for any experience-based comments or suggestions. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I bought Zend Studio Pro at version 3, and never really used it. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encountered some annoyances on install (like what seemed to be a hang
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; during install, which turned out to be a hidden console window awaiting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a key press to continue) and difficulty getting the debugger to work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; properly with the server (turned out to be problems with the GUI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; labeling... we worked our way to success eventually). In the end the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client/server aspects from the Windows client to a Linux server were a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hassle. In my experience it was too slow, and not reliable for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interactive debugging. I never got it to work smoothly from the notebook
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on and off the network. Because of the struggle I never fully adopted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the client so I admit I didn't give the IDE a good chance to impress me. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I still have the license for Safeguard (at v3.5) Performance Suite 3.6
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and Studio Pro 3.0 and Encoder 3.5 Plus, according to my Zend account.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now with PHP 5 pretty widely available to me and all the progress I have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seen from Zend I want to try again. Sadly, it seems everything I had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before (still available for use) is not upgradeable to the current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; versions. I hardly see the point in buying it again, especially now that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it costs even more.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So then there's the trial downloads. Available to try the product --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems a good idea, right?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Experienced as I am (whatever that is), I fully expect that a trial of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.x generation product, installed on my Windows machine, perhaps with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their Windows enhancer (whatever that is), will muck up my system if I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decide to use the 3.x product afterwards. You know, blind forward
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compatibility issues and all. Anybody using the 4 or have any hands-on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experience that would help me out?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know about the so-called &quot;small business development&quot; plan. Even if I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; qualified for it (gross revenue of $250k/year is hardly a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limit for an east coast small business, even during &quot;development&quot;) the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same situation applies. Basically Zend is asking for between $1k and $5k
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *per year* for their product which is not insignificant for an IDE with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugger and encoder.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was a user of NuSphere's PHP-IDE for a while prior to trying Zend 3, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I have never found enough bonus to the specialized IDE over UlraEdit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or Textpad-configured. The debugger is the draw, so if it works well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough for me to be productive with it I want to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anybody care to tell me they *know* the trial versions will be a good 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experience? Or that I should rock on with my 3.x licenses? Or to save my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time and continue the edit-post-refresh routine and accept that there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really isn't a decent interactive debugger for the independent web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developer?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One thinks about PHP certification, which leads to Zend, which suggests
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the IDE (again), which teases with promises of a real debugger and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server-side toolkit.... is it time to try again?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks again.
