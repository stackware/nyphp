<PRE>Normally w/ needed packages like those which don't follow the PEAR  
method is that I split it up and make it into a PEAR-like package  
(without the meta) ... for example for Cake I have:

/usr/lib/php/Cake.php
/usr/lib/php/Cake/all/the/other/crap.php
...

Then anytime its need I have one include path and just require 
('Cake.php');

You would basically fill up that file w/ all your are going to need.   
I beleive its more portable to do it this way but Ive heard of alot  
of people being very anti-pear which I still don't understand.  Ive  
switch to using Cake's /vendor path and placing any PEAR packages I  
need in there and bootstrapping that path via set_include_path 
(get_include_path() . ':/my/new/path')

I wish the include_path did have @ least some namespacing ability to  
it though, then your probably would be solve in saying something like  
use('PayPal') which is what the Cake framework does.

</I>&gt;<i> directories so their top level would be at /srv/www/sites/inc/ 
</I>&gt;<i> PayPal and
</I>&gt;<i> then on down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, if I define each and every lower directory individually in the

</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and further information, PayPal uses multiple nested includes

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For some strange reason I thought that the include_path would be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Someone in this group must have worked with the PayPal module(s)

</I>&gt;<i> and must have come up against the same situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, could someone in the know PLEASE explain how they overcame
