Subject: [nycphp-talk] cakePHP pagination - multiple models with custom
	paginate() functions
Message-ID: <1291218912.26232@coral.he.net>

Hi there everyone,

If anyone is familiar with CakePHP 1.2's usage of multiple models
(defined in the $pagination array) and using the call to $paginator in
the views, please contact me.  

I needed (or think I needed) to use multiple models because I need to
return more than 1 instance of paginate() and paginateCount() and all
three of these applets load each time one is posted...due to the way the
page I inherited is structured.

Since I implemented this, the separate resultsets from the call to the
custom (inherited and debugged) paginate() function are being returned
properly and display in the ajax response properly when parameters are
changed (each list has three selectboxes that feed in conditions for the
search results).  However all the results for each applet display at
once, instead of in sets of five as they did before in the single
applet, and a call to $paginate-> in the view causes an error.  

I will be happy to post the solution for all to see for future list
reference.  I am very willing to pay actual American cash money for any
assistance. 

I'm sure there is a very elegant way to fix this and would love to play
around with it for a week or so but my client is going ape$%#t and needs
this fixed ASAP.  Thanks in advance.

Kristina

PHP works just as well with html5 as it did with html4 and xml. Build
for the mobile web first, and then if necessary drop the assets into
PhoneGap for a native app. It's like progressive enhancement on
steroids.

The biggest pain for me in transitioning to mobile web is figuring out
how to deal with a wide variety of screen sizes, and wrapping my head
around width vs device width. PPK's quirksmode.org has been essential:
http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html

Obviously there are things that you can't do with mobile web that you
can do native, but the ability to write once, run everywhere and use
your existing toolset can give you a big advantage over those stuck in
the native SDKs.

I've been using Appcelerator Titanium Mobile for cross-platform iPhone and Android native app development.  It's uses javascript to abstract the native language - which is nice because you can write once for multiple platforms (doesn't support as many as PhoneGap - but as far as I can tell, produces a more native-feel app).  I then create JSON apis on the server running php for anything that needs server storage/interaction.  They're about to launch a 1.5 version with some major enhancements (and improved documentation/guides).  I definitely recommend checking it out when that is released.

> PHP browser detection (mobile[android,iphone,blackberry,symbian]/desktop/iPad/other pads/book readers)

I saw the latest Zend Framework added some abstraction for PHP browser detection which sounds ideal.  I have been using WURFL - but it's fairly heavy and complicated to setup.  The new library in Zend Framework can still plugin into the WURFL data which is cool.

I am writing an thumbnail generation script and I'm looking high and
low to find out if there is a way to detect an area of an image to use
as a default thumbnail. For example, if I upload a portrait of Robert
E. Lee the script will automatically detect the area around his head
for the thumbnail.

Any thoughts?

I worked an a company that did a lot of image processing.  Here are some
things you need to be aware of going into this:

- More the one person in the picture
- The image can be rotated 90 or 180 degrees
- Mosaic of Faces that create a master face:
http://www.funny-games.biz/images/pictures/846-bush-mosaic.jpg
- Some one uploads a Van Gogh:
http://www.parisprovencevangogh.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/van_gogh_3.jpg
- Facial Hair
- Profiles
- JPG's get a little crazy with the compression which can cause GD to freak
out (depending on which version of GD you are running). Also if you use
apache, some versions have memory issues with Image Magick (The memory wont
be released until that thread dies which can be a long time if you have many
requests trying to analyze images)

Start off by reading up on the algorithms that you will need to know:
http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/  Once you know that you have the face
(or a face for that manner) you can then decide how to create the thumbnail.


One simple option might be to have the user select which portion of the
picture will be used to for the thumb nail.  Lets say I have a pic of me on
the right and 4 friends on the left.  Your script might pick out one of my 4
friends to the right of me which renders that thumbnail useless to me.  I
really want that pic to be my thumbnail so now I go in and crop the pick to
include only me which forces me to leave your site.  If you had the option
for me to drag the thumbnail box to the portion of the pic, I would have
stayed.

Thank You
Chuck Reeves

All good points, Chuck, but let me back up a little. Maybe the face
example wasn't a good one. I have seen at least 2 apps, one being
WordPress, that automatically generate a square thumbnail for an image
from an area on the image that doesn't start with coordinates at the
top left of the original image. How does it do that?

We have always used GD for images, so perhaps I need to look into IM.

Yes, we do that. Of course, some users complain because they have to
actually do the work. If I can figure out a way to automatically
generate that thumb from a somewhat acceptable are of the image by
default that would ease some issues. Maybe.

I'm not sure about wordpress specifically... but there's an imagemagick example for using the "gravity" option to crop the image in different places.  A "north" value tends to work well for profile/avatar images because usually the head is near the top of the image.  http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/thumbnails/

So I guess, you could automatically do it for the person, and then give them the option to change it and specify their own thumbnail if they don't like it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Doctrine and auto_increment not being a primary key
Message-ID: <AANLkTik-bZLERRWZe2xNaQ7EmQMycM7qiHUFAgEgdYvv@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I started using Doctrine some days ago and realized that the way I was using
tables was simply not possible ...

I have always use an integer as auto_increment and do a primary key composed
by multiple fields such as (with MySQL)

CREATE TABLE user(
     id INTEGER(10) not null auto_increment,
     firstName VARCHAR(32),
     lastName VARCHAR(32),
     KEY(id),
     PRIMARY KEY(firstName,lastName)
)

and ... I could not replicate that with Doctrine, which would ask me to have
the id as a primary key ...
So I went to Doctrine IRC for a little chat, and ... some guy told me that I
was completely misunderstanding how a RDBMS worked ...

I am no expert in SQL but ... this is how all the tables are done in
OSCommerce...

So my questions are :
1- Am I really not using SQL tables as It should be?
2- Otherwise, how do you replicate that in Doctrine ?

Regards,

Jean-Baptiste

ps:
I always thought that this was the best way for the following reason :
- the id is just an integer, so better performance for joins, and searching
for a known user
- the primary key is used to prevent duplicates and when searching

You need to read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key

And he's right, in this case you can't ever have 2 people with the same 
name, which is going to be a real problem for all the John Smiths out there!

There may be some reason dictated by the specific requirements of 
OSCommerce, or the designer may just not know what they're doing.

> So my questions are :
> 1- Am I really not using SQL tables as It should be?

In the majority of cases surrogate keys of some kind make sense, the 
fact that you feel the need for a separate id column anyway should be a 
big indicator that this is the case.

In an ideal world the join column will be the primary key, this will 
yield the best performance because every other index just maps the 
indexed column to the primary key.

> - the primary key is used to prevent duplicates and when searching

Improving lookups is the purpose of regular indexes, if you want to 
prevent duplicates then use a UNIQUE index, but as I mentioned above 
this is probably not a good idea in your case.

I'll be short, yes, the guy on IRC was giving good advice.   I read
the schema and it says to me:
"All possible users can be uniquely identified by their first and last
name.  There is no chance there will ever be two different people with
the same name.  There is no chance someone might change their name.
Oh, but we will assign everyone a unique number and keep it sorted in
an index, but that is just for fun... we aren't going to use that
number to identify people."   I can't conceive of a situation where
this makes sense.

ok to make it quick:
 it means that I simply should have id as a primary key and use unique for
the fields that makes the row unique!?

CREATE TABLE user(
          id INTEGER(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
          firstName VARCHAR(32),
          lastName VARCHAR(32)
          PRIMARY KEY(id),
          UNIQUE(firstName,lastName)
)
(or something like that)

For the issue of the 2 people having the same names it just means that I
need more information such as address or email OR I should have a different
primary key (or no primary key at all) ????

Otherwise Is this way of creating table can be used for pretty much every
table ? (except like association table) ?

Anyway thanks for the answers, at least It can be done with Doctrine!

Yes and no.  Use id as the primary key.  Use UNIQUE sparingly.  Use
regular keys when you want to speedup the lookup of that field.

This is better, but still wrong.  This says:
"I'll assign every user a unique id, and I'll reference them by that.
(good)   I'll make looking up by first name really fast, but deny the
possibility that two people have the same first and last name.
(wrong)"

Use PRIMARY KEY for fast lookup, and the absolute reference to the
record.  Use KEY, to speed up lookup on that field, use UNIQUE to
speed up lookup and also to prevent duplication.

below is a sample:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `user` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `fname` varchar(24) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `lname` varchar(24) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `username` varchar(36) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `pass` varchar(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `username` (`username`),
  UNIQUE KEY `email` (`email`),
  KEY `lname` (`lname`)
) ;

This says:
"Assign each user an id, and use that to reference each user.  Make
lookups on last name, email, and username, very fast. Don't allow
duplicate usernames or emails."

I just encountered my first real one.
It's on a MySQL on a Windows platform--someone from the MSSQL world, no 
doubt.
Just got bitten hard by it, migrating from 5.0 to 5.1 has slightly 
different schemata in the mysql.mysql database, which made me need to be 
very careful about importing dumpfiles.

Nothing like a late-night website migration to uncover these things!

I know it's not PHP-related, but was just sharing is all.

Will 5.1 import 5.0 binary files?

BTW, someone who uses a stored procedure in MySQL could be coming from the
Oracle, Sybase, Microsft, or Postgres world. Either that, or they are new to
RDBMSes and do not have prejudices against using certain features in MySQL
since they weren't using it since 4.0 when you could not do these things.

I would us the auto increment field as the primary.
Then index the name fields.

The primary would then be used to associate records in other tables to the
name table.

I actually tried that...but a) this was a Windows platform (so LVM 
doesn't exist) and b) the structure of the tables in the main MySQL 
changed from 5.0 -> 5.1 (extra columns in mysql.proc, mysql.db, etc) so 
a physical restoral (I tried just copying the innodb and myisam table 
files over) failed.

If there were NO sprocs, this would have been easy...but someone started 
using them so I got stuck with a logical dump/restore (and hand-editing 
the dump file to NOT try to recreate any tables in the MySQL mysql 
database).

There's a bit of confusion. MySQL runs a special database called 'mysql' 
that contains all manner of administrative information, and it's where 
things like stored procedure definitions live.

I mentioned that this was a windows machine, running ASP code. My best 
guess is MSSQL. :-) Every large RDBMS (Oracle, DB2, Sybase, MSSQL) uses 
them a lot more.

I was  curious if anyone knows of a PHP group mailling list project offering

mature email list management solution.  But it's in python, and I'd rather
run a PHP app which I can hack easily and learn from coding, than a python

I'm more looking for the group list function....ie what this mailing list
uses.

Mailman's web interface[resetting your password, archives, etc] just makes
me cringe.

I especially hate that almost every install I've seen makes you assign a
password for every mail list you are on to access your account online.  Why
should I have to set a password for NYPHP-talk AND set a password for
NYPHP-jobs ?  If it is the same email address, just let me use one password
for both.

Add to that simple things like RSS feeds are made much more difficult with
Mailman.

I want to setup a couple email lists of my own....and given a choice between
learning enough python to modify Mailman, or writing my own listserv
software in PHP I will go with PHP.  I'd just rather start with something
else and build on it than create my own.


As for PHPlist.....  well, since I am between jobs and my last job was in
managing email deliverability/campaigns using Email Service Providers....I
am currently working on writing my own one way list system utilizing EC2 to
scalibility and PHP/Swiftmail as the mail processor[yes, I am aware of the
general logic that says it is better to do email delivering with a mail
server compiled in C for performance....I feel that general logic is based
on an archaic view of servers where "throwing more hardware" at a problem
was an expensive proposition.  With Amazon's cloud services, you can throw a
virtual PC with 64G of memory and 8 virtual cores at the initial mail
campaign send of a couple of million emails for an hour for just 2 bucks,
then leave the email that can't be delivered immediately on a low priority
queue and process it with a micro instance to handle bounce back and problem
delivery for 2 cents an hour...]  Once I have it up and running I can bounce
you some links if you want to test it out[most likely I will be pay images
of everything pre-installed up on Amazon for a few cents more an hour than
they charge, while keeping all the sourcecode in github so your free to roll
your own if you wish.]

The plus of using Amazon web services is that if you grow to the point of
being worth having your own fulltime system admin team, you can migrate to
Eucalyptus and run it all in house.

Learn,

My suggestion is to just install cacti.http://www.cacti.net/index.php

Also if you want php 5.3 on RHEL, and dont want to build it yourself someone
made them. http://www.webtatic.com/blog/2009/06/php-530-on-centos-5/. I use
that on production.

Rolling my own has two major reasons. First is learning, second is
