Seems like an easy upgrade unless you have TIMESTAMP columns in InnoDB
tables -- if so you'll want to consult the top of that change log to
see if you need to reload your tables after upgrade.

It should be - however gmail accounts tend to not show you the email you
sent to the list.
So if you see this :-) then your gmail account is working just fine

G'morning,
Is there a simple way to access  the *entire* HTTP request body as a single
string?
Of course, I can do a foreach loop on the $_POST array and combine its
elements into a single url-encoded string.
However, it gets more complicated when the request contains file upload data
(especially with multiple files).

Cheers,
Jerry

You can grab the contents of $GLOBALS['HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA'], but for it 
to work with multipart forms you will have to set the ini setting 
'always_populate_raw_post_data'.  Even then whether it will work or not 
is open to debate, you can find a bit more info on this here:

This isn't really an answer to your question, but there are easier
ways of handling multiple file uploads than trying to parse the entire
request body. The following form would post 3 files, available to the
PHP as an array called $_FILES['myfiles']

<input type="file" name="myfiles[]" />
<input type="file" name="myfiles[]" />
<input type="file" name="myfiles[]" />

If you really need the full request body, you can use
$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA if you enable it in php.ini or using a setini()
call. Or check out the php://input stream documentation.

what if you did an implode()?
I know it works for basic arrays, not sure what it would do to an UL file.
I've found serialize() to also be very useful.

I know how to handle file uploads  :)
I'm trying to do something else.

I just found out that $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA will not work for requests with
Content-Type: multipart/form-data and php://input is not available in PHP
versions prior to 4.3.

Thanks,
Jerry

I think the author is off-base.  The PHP5 object model changes 
originated out of both user and developer unhappiness with the PHP4 way 
of doing things.  Many of the changes were both driven and implemented 
by people outside of Zend.

I've been as critical of the Zend guys as almost anyone, but this 
article is just a big (largely unfounded) personal attack against Andi 
and Zeev.  This same author wrote the hilariously off-base article 'PHP 
5: A Sign that PHP Could Soon be Owned by Sun', which was universally 
mocked by everyone actually involved in developing PHP.

I submit that the author should devote less time to these rabid 
conspiracy theories regarding why the language isn't developing in the 
way he wants, and more time actually trying to develop the language the 
way he wants.

It seems a bit bias to say the least.  

The new object model is really a response to the community's demand;
being good marketing fodder is an added bonus.  The community wanted to
have static functions, protected private variables and a better
constructor/destructor, etc.

Procedural programming in PHP5 is still there (plus), what I think the
author considers for "quick development".  And adding the new object
model makes PHP more conducent for the enterprise.  I see v5 as no less
accessible for new programmers and more evolved for advanced apps.

Isn't this typical of the "programmer vs. implementer" debate? Those who 
view themselves as professional programmers seek to advance the academic 
quality of the language (those aspects which suffer criticisms, such as 
scalability,  "enterprise robustness" , etc) while those who build stuff 
that does work seek simplicity, stability, and the maturation of 
toolsets. A relative handful of people are in the middle, and hey are 
usually involved in developing the language.

A woman sees her friend spending alot of time with a new companion, and 
says "is he Mr. Right?" to which her friend replies, "he's Mr. Right Now".

In my view PHP has always been "Mr. right now" - the tool to get the job 
done. For such implementors, time till reveal if PHP5 continues to serve 
the community -- it will have to be a better tool for the job, be 
available on hosting services, be simple enough/reliable enough, etc. 
For those seeking to advance the professionalism of their programming, 
to replace java, or to achieve what PHP has not been able to achieve 
before, there is opportunity for active involvement in the development 
of PHP. Loyalty to the language sans active involvement in its 
development will lead to frustration, for sure.

I see plenty of PHP programmers migrating to python.

Ha, I'm reminded of the early days of the NYPHP library, when we couldn't

Not very well with older versions. There's a configuration directive
(always_populate_raw_post_data), but the "always" is very misleading,
since it doesn't alwys work. :-)

I think it only populates the $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA variable when the
Content-Type is unknown, or something weird like that.

Can you contact me offline; I'd like to see an example of PHP version 
4.1.2+ and the Singleton Pattern for backwards compatibility.

I've been stumped by a question of a fellow freelancer today.  Anyone know
if it's possible in php to do something like this:

usort($array, function($a, $b) {
     if($a == $b) return 0;
     return ($a < $b) ? -1 : 1;
});

Thanks!

Yes but you have to use the create_function function.
See the manual: http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.create-function.php

I don't think it's possible. If he's trying to avoid using globals, I'd
suggest that he create a sorting class and use member variables as his
globals for sorting, and then the usort callback function (class procedure)
can be privy to those private values.

You can use create_function(), but it's rather ugly.

Some of my colleagues have done tasteful multimedia news packages which 
would have been difficult to do without it.

Well suppose you had a application which periodically contacted the 
server but you didn't want to refresh or deliver a new page (say a 
game). Could you open a socket from the client side? Maybe, but I don't 
know how. Keeping a connection open would become draining once there 
were hundreds open to the server and a waste if you only needed access 
for a few seconds. So with Flash and the client side language built in, 
I think you can do event based calls back to the server, without the 
need for a new HTTP request. No?

... yea, I guess I would be a Flash hat wearing user. (Maybe
BPang can vouch for me on this one...)

Flashkit *used* to be good, but, it's so mucky to rake through
the garbage there, and they don't treat their users with a lot
of respect, and I have choose to boycott them having to deal
with their administrators. The following offer some useful
information.

http://www.moock.org/webdesign/flash/
http://www.kirupa.com/
http://ultrashock.com/
http://actionscript-toolbox.com/
http://www.flash-db.com/

And, to relate it to the PHP topic... I've used it a lot, a
heck of a lot, with PHP as a backend. You don't even need XML.
Just FMX and LAMP. http://hottamales.com/ (developed by 2 NYPHP
list members) is all FMX and LAMP.

Nice work :-)  Thanks for the info.

I just came across this: *PHPObject*
(http://ghostwire.com/resources/phpobject/)

Is this unique?  Im trying to understand the FlashRemoting concept .. is
there any 1-2 hour MX intermediate class available anywhere? Ill trade
beer/pizza/wifi hacking for some expert time if any takers :-)

Flush lite (from MuckYo'Media) might be running on 
some D505i (Mitsubishi) cell phones in Japan -- 
that is, it is possible to run the content on the  
cell phones since they have the player installed.

In order to get European handset manufacturers to 
consider 'lite', the software manufacturer had to 
guarantee that the 'lite' player would be SVG-T 
conformant.

This may be because European manufacturers want to 
remain flexible and have the ability to play SVG-T 
content as well -- I don't look at it that way. 
(SVG seems technically superior to me -- 
but I am certainly no expert) 

I don't know if the Japanese handsets can play 
both formats -- but it is probably a good bet that  
they can (that is, that the D505's can play SVG-T also).

Macromedia designed Flash MX Remoting for use as 
a direct transfer link between Flash MX and 
Cold Fusion MX. 

The protocol used in Flash MX Remoting is called 
ActionScript Message Format (AMF).

The AMF format used in remoting is binary, and so 
is more compact than XML -- hence (it can be) more 
efficient. 

Some clever guys at: 

http://www.amfphp.org/ 

(the flash remoting for php site)

figured out the format. 

There are some tutorials on flash remoting for php 
along with some sample programs there.

This was done with Flash constructing gets or posts to a php page which
would return urlencoded name=value pairs. Easy.
Gets a little tricky when dealing with dynamic lists, but easily solved
by also sending along a count of the list length ala
length=2&name1=foo&name2=bar

For whatever reason Flash couldn't figure that out on it's own. I don't
"do" Flash, so I couldn't tell you why. I did it once back in the days
of Flash4 and I am scared to go there again, although I hear it's better
now.

You could probably do a lot more complex stuff with XML, but you don't
have to. It could all be put into a string.

What's important is that you (as the php person) have a Flash person who
understands and respects dealing with dynamic data and not just some
creative monkey drawing tweens.

AS2 adds some REAL oo fun to the mix as well as some organization and
efficiency updates that the language was in dire need of.  I wrote a fully
dynamic php / AS2 kiosk app (xml based) a couple months after it's release
and enjoyed almost every second of it (besides the lack of info available at
the time).  At the time I'd found a lot of advanced JavaScript resources to
be really helpful, since the new version of the language it more in tune
with ECMAScript. (I just ran across this, about moving from as -> as2 and
it's relation to ECMAScript: http://tinyurl.com/66cby)

> any good resources? 

Definitely look into Colin Moock's books.  ASDG2 is the AS Bible, although
it's based on AS1.  Also, check out Moock's Essential AS2 (on my shelf, but
no time to read it yet - although it's gotten there via high
recommendation).
ASDG2: http://tinyurl.com/6ht79
Essen: http://tinyurl.com/5cjez

Also, a few people and places who seem to make the flash world go 'round
(forgive me if the list is a bit stale, it's been a couple months since I
followed really closely)...

Personally, I think flash is tons of fun to work with, especially since the
birth of as2.  Unfortunately it can be truly time consuming and I'm just no
fan of the flash IDE at all whatsoever.  It tries to be a vector tool and
programming tool at once and fails miserably on both counts.  When I was
using it a couple months back, there were a few projects in the works to
avoid the IDE completely.  They may possibly be available by now.

Good Luck!

I had alot read about Macromedia buy a J2ME company which could play
embedded Flash Lite and have yet to find more about it.

appreciated.

Guys i figured this out, for some odd reason it doesnt like the fact
that i had $this->errno and $this->errstr set with the __set method,
it works now but still confuses me as to why i cannot use the __set
method for this.

You did not declare $errno and $errstr.

That would be error_reporting and display_errors:

http://us4.php.net/manual/en/ref.errorfunc.php#ini.error-reporting
http://us4.php.net/manual/en/ref.errorfunc.php#ini.display-errors

Note - IMHO development servers should have error reporting set to 
E_ALL, and production servers should only log errors to file - not to 
the screen.

Sol,

that is because when you use $this->VAR  and it is not declared __get
and __set should take care of that, it does for my other variable
timeout.  I dont think the fsockopen function likes me doing that ;)

it works if i declare them

Here's a few lists:
http://chattyfig.figleaf.com/

The flashcoders one is really good, BUT it's high volume.  I only subscribe
when I'm working on a larger flash project, as there's days that you may get
100+ emails in an hour.  Generally, you'll find some gems in all those
emails though.  Good excuse for a gmail account ;). A lot of the people I
mentioned previously are on the list though, and are generally really
helpful.

There's a few other flash lists on that site that I haven't tried so much,
but I'd imagine would be just as helpful.

Rahmin,

If what you mean is that your variables from the HTTP request or server 
environment aren't available, you're probably referring to the fact that 
register globals is off on the new machine.  In PHP, regular variables 
don't need to be declared before they're used, so that will not cause an 
error.

It's highly recommended that instead of flipping them back on in the INI 
file or in your script, you should consider adjusting your application 
instead:

I'm also on that list... I prefer to receive the digest as it

I think that's what overload means.(correct me if I'm
wrong, French is my first language).

If your intention is to create properties on the fly,
you shouldn't use __set and __get.
You can just do something like this:
$obj->x = 'something';
where $x was not proviously declared.
It works fine event under E_STRICT.

Sol,

i think the reason is because on a good connection $errno and $errstr
are null values and you cant set a $this->errno to null through an
overloaded method.  if they returned something other than null it
would probably work.

Did you try and simulate a bad connection?
I think the reason is not in the data type but
concept.
Remove __get and __set and it will work fine. 
But that's not what you want.

No offense Rahmin, but why not just clean up the code. It will save you 
headaches in the long run and make your code more secure.

You can set error reporting in an .htaccess file and in your code. You 
shouldn't need a sysadmin for this and you definately shouldn't need a 
reboot (a restart of the webserver maybe but not a reboot).

Hey Folks:

I'm performing computer security consulting work for the War Resisters 
League (http://www.warresisters.org/).  Their computers are filled 
with worms and adware.  I've cleaned up and locked down 1.5 computers 
so far, but that's taken a long time, meaning it's costing them a lot 
of money.  Fixing the remaining machines is essential, but beyond 
their financial means at the moment.  Have you heard of any 
organizations that provide emergency grants for computer security 
enhancements?

While this is a long shot, you never know! :)

Thanks for thinking about this,

The Center for Non-Profit Technology is a fee-for-service group, but they 
may be able to point you in the right direction.  They probably are the 
most likely to be aware of resources available to NPs in NYC.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] understanding PEAR::DB_Pager
In-Reply-To: <OF167DDEEC.E9FE0445-ON85256F04.004BA236-85256F04.004C11ED@us.ibm.com>
References: <OF167DDEEC.E9FE0445-ON85256F04.004BA236-85256F04.004C11ED@us.ibm.com>
Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.58.0409031146040.52340@emra.pair.com>


If any of you are using the PEAR DB_Pager (0.7) class with success, maybe
you can help me figure this out. Here's a snippet based closely on the
example in the source:

<?php
require_once 'DB/Pager.php';
$sql= "select * from events"; // has 20K+ rows
$db = DB::connect($DSN);
$from = 100;   // The row to start to fetch from, which you typically get
		// from $_GET. we are simulating that the user
		// clicked a link pointing to a page 5 (of 852)
$limit = 25; 	// The number of results per page
$maxpages = 15; // The number of pages for displaying in the pager

$res   = $db->limitQuery($sql, $from, $limit);
$nrows = $db->getOne("select count(*) from events");

echo  "rows: $nrows\n";

$nrows = $res->numRows();
while ($row = $res->fetchrow()) {
   // display data
}

$data = DB_Pager::getData($from, $limit, $nrows, $maxpages);
print_r( $data );
?>

The author encourages us to use the array returned by getData() to build
our linked page numbers. The build() method, constructor etc are now
deprecated in favor of this one static getData() method.

Above, getData() returns an array that looks like this:

Array
(
    [numpages] => 852
    [firstpage] => 1
    [lastpage] => 852
    [pages] => Array
        (
            [1] => 0
            [2] => 25
            [3] => 50
            [4] => 75
            [5] => 100
            [6] => 125
            [7] => 150
            [8] => 175
            [9] => 200
            [10] => 225
            [11] => 250
        )

    [current] => 5
    [maxpages] => 15
    [prev] => 75
    [next] => 125
    [remain] => 25
    [to] => 125
    [numrows] => 21297
    [from] => 101
    [limit] => 25
)


It's the $data['pages'] array that I don't get. When the offset is 0, it
contains just 7 elements, not the 15 that I want:

[pages] => Array
        (
            [1] => 0
            [2] => 25
            [3] => 50
            [4] => 75
            [5] => 100
            [6] => 125
            [7] => 150
        )

When offset is 75, it has 10 elements:

   [pages] => Array
        (
            [1] => 0
            [2] => 25
            [3] => 50
            [4] => 75
            [5] => 100
            [6] => 125
            [7] => 150
            [8] => 175
            [9] => 200
            [10] => 225
        )
}

When offset = 100, it has 11. When offset = 175 or more, it has 14.  When
offset exceeds 175, $data['pages'] starts "sliding" up as expected, so
when offset is 675:

    [pages] => Array
        (
            [21] => 500
            [22] => 525
            [23] => 550
            [24] => 575
            [25] => 600
            [26] => 625
            [27] => 650
            [28] => 675
            [29] => 700
            [30] => 725
            [31] => 750
            [32] => 775
            [33] => 800
            [34] => 825
        )

    [current] => 28
    [maxpages] => 15
    [prev] => 650
    [next] => 700
    [remain] => 25
    [to] => 700
    [numrows] => 21298
    [from] => 676
    [limit] => 25
)

But it never has 15 elements. I'm wondering whether this behavior is by
design, or I'm doing something wrong, or what. Meanwhile I have been
ignoring $data['pages'] and just doing own arithmetic to get what I want,
but that seems like a duplication of effort.

Many thanks,

So, when did you start having thoughts about this PHP language?

Hey all.. list is being slow yea, and lazy weekend.
I am sitting here trying to figure something out and maybe someone else
knows or I am googling the wrong things..

trying to pass russian/japanese etc chars via the URL.
I.e. (the desc=variable):
http://{SOME_URL}?desc=%u0440%u0443%u0441%u0441%u043A%u0438%u0439%20%u044F%u0437%u044B%u043A
And cannot seem to get them back.

Tried the following:
html_entity_decode(rawurldecode ($desc));
html_entity_decode(urldecode ($desc), ENT_NOQUOTES, "koi8-ru");

And also tried just about every possible combo..
Poked around with mbstring, but these should be pretty basic unicode
transforms but I have never messed around with them.
 
Anyone have any idea how to do this?

Hey Joel:

URL encoding is based on RFC 1738, which says the encoding consists 
"of the character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal digits" 
representing the octet for a "character within the US-ASCII coded 
character set."  So, Unicode seems out of the question.

See you,

Well..
The main issue is something like this:
http://historyagent.com/index.php?str=???????????
Which the browser translates into:
http://historyagent.com/index.php?str=%D0%A0%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA
Which if piped through:
html_entity_decode(rawurldecode ($desc)) 
works fine.

However,
when passed through javascript escape I get: 
http://historyagent.com/index.php?str=%u0420%u0443%u0441%u0441%u043A%u0438%u0439%20%u044F%u0437%u044B%u043A
Which is having issues being translated in php

I think I am going to remove the javascript escaping..

I think he meant "notice" instead of "error". I'm guilty of the same lack
of precision in how I describe these things, too. I call anything that
appears on the screen that I didn't want an error. :-)

Rahmin, I would strongly recommend slowly migrating your code so that you
can turn error_reporting all the way up (E_ALL) without seeing any errors,
warnings, notices, and whatnot. This will at least force one good practice
- initializing variables. This can not only cut down on bugs, it also
eliminates a few security concerns for free.

You can also use ini_set() for all directives related to error reporting,
so there really is no excuse. :-)

Joel,
I've been using this on and off, and it seems to me to be 
shaping up into a really neat tool. There's a slashdot 
discussion on extensions today, and I thought of linking to 
history agent, then I thought I'd bounce it off you first, 
since posting something to this list isn't the same as 
advertising it to the masses. By reply time, the thread will 
be stale, but surely there'll be another within a week or 
so. So the question, I guess, is: do you want as much 
traffic as your pipe can handle?

Unicode isn't out of the question -- it's just encoded in a way
different from how Javascript wants to do it in this case. Unicode
characters are represented in URIs by their octet sequences -- you
just need more octets per character then you do with ASCII.

The trick when you get an octet sequence like that is figuring out
what characterset to translate it into, a problem mentioned but not
resolved by RFC 2396 (which supercedes 1738).

My guess is that the %uNNNN notation is a (misguided?) attempt to
encode around this problem by identifying the sequence as unicode up
front.

Thanks
no, is fine if you want to tell people about it, it is sitting on a
dedicated server that has plenty of pipe.

I just got the translations set up for various languages.

I also reworked some of the favlet code and added in examples to show
how to set up the bars in the various browsers etc..

Trying to figure 2 things out ...

* Is there anyway to create a *global* function for use w/ all tables?
(if so, how?)

* I thought you could get all the stored procedures like:

select create procedure *;

But it does not seem to work .. is

select name,body from mysql.proc; the "correct" way of doing this type
of query?

Thanks.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Storing User Controlled Configs
Message-ID: <FDF0CA18-0085-11D9-9223-003065E1876E@mac.com>

Hello, my name is Jeff Rigby, this is my first time posting and I'm 
very interested in getting involved with this list.

I wanted to get some advice on the best and most efficient way to store 
user controlled configurations. I am currently storing all non-security 
risk configurations in a MySQL table named 'config'. When the user logs 
in I run a query to get all the configs from the table and then I store 
them in a session variable with the following function:


// Set $force to 1 if configurations needs to be reloaded.
function getConfig($force) {
     if($force==1 || $_SESSION['config_set']!=1) {
         $db = connectDB();
         $query = 'SELECT * FROM config';
         $results = $db->query($query);
         while($row = $results->fetchRow(DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC)) {
             $_SESSION['config_'.$row['config_name']] = 
$row['config_value'];
         }
         $_SESSION['config_set'] = 1;
         $db->disconnect();
     }
}

This way, unless I update a configuration, I only need to to query the 
SQL table once per a session. It seems to work fine.

My questions are:
1. Would it be better to query the table on every page load?
2. What are the drawbacks if any of using session vars to store configs?
3. Is there a better method?
4. Is it proper to call session vars from within a function, or should 
the the session vars be passed to the variable when the function is 
called?

Example
function test() {
     RETURN 'Hello '.$_SESSION['config_name'].'!';
}

test();

or

function test($name) {
     RETURN 'Hello '.$name.'!';
}

test($_SESSION['config_name']);

Thanks in advance for all your help.

Jeff

It can be 'dangerous' to keep all configuration vars in the session as
session variables are easily edited by anyone who has the time to find out
how via google.  If your config vars are controlling color schemes and such,
not such a big deal.  But if your config vars have more personal
information, this could prove to be a problem.  

In my reading from Mr. Shiflett and a few others who evangelize the
importance of security scrutiny in php (and elsewhere), I've found it best
to keep an encrypted key of sorts in the session, and then query the
database according to that key for the information needed per user.  This
ensures a tampered session is worthless and that personal information never
gets into the browser's messy pockets.

As far as calling session vars in a function, it's a matter of preference.
I've personally always found it best to pass all vars the function (or
define them in the class) explicitly, which allows you to trace the path of
the variable while reading the code.  But, according to the code I've read
over the years, most coders don't necessarily agree.

Good Luck!

Mark

Mind citing some links you find on Google? I don't think this is nearly as
easy as you make it sound.

Hmmm, not sure how you would attack session vars, which are stored on
the server. Perhaps the security folks could elaborate. At best, you
could discover or fake someone's session id, but if you can do that,
you can gain access to any web application.

To undigress, session vars are the perfect place to store this info in
my opinion. If it saves you a select across a huge member table, all
the better.

As to #4, I would definitely keep your functions/methods as abstract
as possible, so as not to limit your code to working with PHP's
built-in session mechanism. Then again, It *can* be annoying to type
$_SESSION on every function call...

Oops, I believe was referring more to cookies than sessions.  I must try not
to post too much at the end of a long day.

Nonetheless, a google for "hijack session php" (sans quotes) has a lot of
good information as to how to do some dirty, and avoid such things with
sessions (7th from the top is 'The Truth About Sessions', by Chris Shiflett,
as a matter of fact).

Hope everyone had a good weekend!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] a freelancing story..
Message-ID: <1094570768.7501.181.camel@bezel>

Hi all, I know there has been a lot of talk about freelancing here and I
thought I would share some recent events.
I run a semi-busy freelancing job board and just had some issues with a
user and some fraud.
Figured I would pass on this info so that some of you considering
freelancing, or who are new at it might not be aware of a group of
people who scam new freelancers. This one was set up beforehand and
then executed quickly. The product passed hands just several minutes
before I had reversed all funds and started cancelling accounts.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Basically this is how it starts:
Scammer contacts user, requests rush job, agrees to first
quote (it doesn't matter because they are not paying) decides
to use an escrow on a freelance site and always uses a credit 
card. Because of the escrow it seems legit.
In the instance below I was responding to the programmer who 
was scammed by a Mike ONeil (powerx at albarid.net) albarid is 
a free email service and I imagine the name is bogus.
-------------------------------------------------------------
From: Joel D.
To: ****
Subject: RE: Fraudulent activity via Listbid.

Well,
This is pretty common on these sites, I hate to say.
95% of the people are very good and have no bad intentions, but there
is a group of people who attempt to scam others, this is why we build
up ratings systems.
One thing you need to do is allow time for a card to go through so you
know.
This particular card 'did' go through, then was cancelled by the fraud
department at the credit card clearing.
Basically, I am told by the credit company the credit is cleared, I
put the money in escrow which makes it available. If it is charged
back or is determined to be fraud then they get back to me within a
few minutes and they pass on the information to the authorities (which
here in the US carries a pretty high jail term). At that point I have
to go back and refund money and hope that the scammer has not already
got his stuff.
If the money is not there, then I can't in turn give it to you from our
escrow.
Basically, beware of anyone who has a "rush" job that has a
turn-around of less than a day, they will generally be scammers,
nobody is in that kind of hurry. Also, the reason these boards want
you to use the services is because so we can track the users. Pay
special attention to buyers who have very new accounts.
Also when dealing with graphics always heavily watermark your images
if you place them up for view and never give PSD's. Some of these guys
(which we get rid of as soon as possible) will have you "redo" things
over and over and as they look at each version are just copying them
down each time and end up getting twenty things for the cost of one.
Time is against the scammer, so go for jobs that are longer, make them
put money in escrow first.
Within 30 seconds of us being notified that users account was locked
and the funds were reversed.
In this instance, we ban both accounts because the scammers usually
will just wander over to a different job board and pull the same
thing, but we don't want them creating a new account and trying to hit
the same user again.
I am not sure how experienced you are in freelancing, but basically
you just got worked over by someone who knew the timeframe he needed
to do this in, and used 2Checkout instead of paypal which is more
prone to fraud.
I have actually requested a change in the freelancers software to have
a mandatory waiting period (two hours or so) after a credit card
deposit.

Anyway, I am sorry for your loss and understand your frustration.
Just think that it was only one hour and I have heard of far worse
stories of users being scammed out of a lot of money.
Welcome to the world of international freelancing.
Be (much) more careful next time.

If you want an "invite" please check your inbox for people you know

Hi everybody,

I just got a request to install an e-commerce package and I was 
considering either osCommerce or Zen Cart. My understanding is that Zen 
Cart is a newer version of osCommerce with a better templating system, 
but I haven't compared them yet myself. Anybody have any reasons for 
choosing one over the other? Or would somebody recommend another php 
e-commerce package?

thanks,

I understand now. :-) Yes, sessions can be hijacked if you rely on
session_start() alone, but the session variables themselves are pretty
sure, since they're kept on the server and not sent back and forth.

What makes session security so challenging is that something does have to
be sent to the server for every request that identifies the user.

:-)

If any of you will be at php|works, I'll be talking about session security
there. I'm also trying to figure out Keynote, so I may have a fancy
presentation to go along with it. :-)

To be fair, I would bet that neither of the last two emails on this thread
were intended to be sent to the list. This is just one of the bad
side-effects of mangling the Reply-To header.

I can't shake anything out of the knowledge base over at Zend, has anyone
encountered heavy (slow, frequent) flickering in Zend Studio 3.0? Does it
help at all to turn off syntax checking or update java or some other strange

I'll take any salient tips on making Zend stop attempting to give me a

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Best recommendations for SWF -> PHP -> SWF
Message-ID: <413E255C.2050708@adnet-sys.com>

I am working on a freelance project that unfortunately requires for me 
to decompile existing .swf Flash files back into .fla files, embed PHP 
to ensure dynamic content building and then recompile them somehow back 
into .swf Flash.

I don't even know if this is the best approach to doing this, but I've 
read here about some people who have some PHP - Flash experience and I 
bet would have the best approach to this method.

I first of all need a free (if possible) Flash decompiler, or do I?

Secondly, is my next approach (assuming the first one is sane) the right 
approach: that is, to redesign the .fla files to accept dynamic content 
that could be served up via PHP (or.. ???)?

I also studied the PHP built-in functions that deal with SWF conversion 
and also wondered would that even apply in this scenario or should I 
just steer clear.

Thanx
Phil

You need something to rip the AS out -- yes possible.

You can edit it ( add the php right inside it ) then publish to swf.

Would I actually publish back to swf?  That would be very impractical 
since the customer wants the ability to edit and delete text on the fly, 
in short, a CMA.  He wants to edit things like news, events, etc. and be 
able to see the changes immediately upon his Flash-encoded website pages.

That's why I wanted to ask first before going down the wrong direction.

In-Reply-To: <003a01c49420$61830fa0$e98d3818@oberon1>
Message-ID: <BD63A1D0.9910%php@haberco.com>

Adding...I am also curious about this.

DB_DataObject is built on DB_PEAR. I ran my own benchmark tests and viewed
those on the net and DB_Pear appeared several times slower than ADODB and
even my own MySql wrapper. I wonder if there are any object abstraction
libraries like this built on ADODB? Does anyone know?

I've written my own sql building engine similar to DB_DataObject, where the
objects generate their own SQL statements and output template arrays of data
formatted for HTML. It also produces HTML fill-in forms automatically for
objects, taking hints about form elements or making guesses based on field
type. If I ever clean up the code I might open-source it.

Does anyone have any experience working with high-level sql builders and
object-managers that generate SQL and format output data? The next layer of
abstraction after the db wrapper, in other words. The dare I say... Oh
dreaded term: business logic. But it's "smart" business logic. The best of
these should be able to automatically generate multi-table joins and manage
business-layer objects that span multiple tables.

Are there any advanced versions of things like this, even commercially? Or
what toolsets do people use for these "x-treme abstraction"(if I may)
strategies?

Eddie

Phil-

I think you?re best bet is to have your SWF?s pull content in at runtime
using XML or loadVars (urlencoded name/value pairs). Putting PHP into a SWF
doesn't make much sense since the server won?t parse PHP unless it?s a text
file with a .php extension.

I also think you?ll find that decompiling .swfs is not an exact science. In
fact, I?d be surprised if anyone has decompiled a swf into a usable FLA. You
might get away with pulling AS out as Yury suggested, but the simplest
answer is to get the original FLA?s, tweak them to pull in content at
runtime, then output clean swfs.

We use this architecture quite a bit (look at the Whitney.org homepage for
an example). You?ll see that most of the content is held in external text or
xml docs. The ?shell? has the loader and the graphics, but the dynamic
content is loaded separately.

Hope that helps.

That was my initial idea, considering the original web designer has the 
original .fla files (I hope), however, he has, to date, not contacted 
any of us (he hasn't contacted the customer in months and won't return 
phone calls nor emails apparently), so there might not be any way to 
obtain the original .fla files as I would like.  And my knowledge of 
loadVars is 0.00%, XML only slightly more so, so for the sake of 
expediency I felt it be best for me for now to build a PHP CMA that 
would allow for extraction of dynamic data into usable external files 
for inclusion by the modified SWF files.

Tragically, the original designer lied to the customer about the SWF's 
dynamic and scalable capabilities (he hardcoded text right into the SWF 
itself!) so this is not for me going to be an easy science to rebuild 
dynamically (customer wants the same L&F but with dynamic and 
customer-content-management capabilities).

But cool, I won't have to decompile the SWF files, *whew* thanx!

Phil-

If you move forward with building your PHP CMA, I?d suggest that you use
make some allowances for outputting the content into XML. That way, when you
get the fla?s, you can pull that content in. On the other hand, if you have
to ?fail-over? to html, you could run the same xml into a xslt processor and
output normal html (or even a .doc or .pdf if you needed to).

Another simple solution would be to build your CMA as class-based, and use
arrays to output data. For example, if you build a News object,
?$news->getArticle(5)? could output the headline, dateline, author and
content into one big array. Then you use that array in a normal php/html
page, or an xml down the road.

I'll go with the OO approach, my XML is a bit slight and XSLT 
nonexistent (I simply don't know enough to build a project based on it 
right now). However, the problem arises now: Building a PHP CMA that 
will allow the user to submit new content is fine, saving onto database 
and even generating flat XML files based on it, however, I do not know 
what to do next unless I am able to get the .fla original AS files.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Downloading a CSV file
Message-ID: <20040908024555.GA11236@uranus.faber.nom>

Hi all,

I'm building a webapp (a telemarketing tracking thingie) and I'm trying
to figure out the best way to do the following:

I want my worker bee to click on a link and download a CSV file that she
will then use in a mail-merge.  The only way I can think of doing it I
don't like.  I'm sure there's a better, PHP Approved Way (TM).

The only way I can think of doing it is to send a query via PHP to MySQL and
telling MySQL to dump the data to a textfile in the website directory via
SELECT...INTO OUTFILE..., then have PHP redirect to that file, and then
delete the file. I don't like that way.

The only other thing I can think of is to have PHP grab the
dataset, format the data as CSV and then...what?  Display it in her
browser and have her do a File->Save?  Not nice, IMO.

Any brilliant ideas?

You could adjust her MIME options to allow her to open/run the file
automatically instead of File-Save, I beleive Firefox/IE give you this
option .. in other words you dont always have to save.  Give yourself a
custom header and it should pipe the data through.

Personally Ive found cron'ing mysql jobs w/ XML to be a pretty nice way
of having the data around for multiple uses and using XSL (albeit not an
expert but finding it pretty handy once you figure the cryptic
templating out) :-)

Here's some pseudo code to get you started. It should prompt the user 
with a dialog box to save the file. However, keep in mind that if you 
have really large datasets (40,000 rows+) this may not work...PHP may 
run into memory issues. (You might want to see how phpMyAdmin handles 
very large datasets.) However, keep in mind that if the csv file is 
going to go into Excel...Excel has problems with very large datasets. On 
a recent project I had to divide an export into two 40,000 row datasets 
to be able to pull it into Excel.

Jeff S.
-----------------

$query 	= "SELECT * FROM MYTABLE
$result = mysql_query($query,$dbLink);


//For the first row in the file to have column names
$csv_output = "\"ColumnHead1\",\"ColumnHead2\"\n";

//Here's the data
while($row=mysql_fetch_assoc($result)){
$csv_output .=
"\"{$row['column1']}\",\"{$row['column2']}\"\n";
}

Header("Content-type: text/csv\n",true);
Header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=myfilename.csv",true); 

Header("Pragma: no-cache",true);
Header("Expires: 0",true);
print $csv_output;
exit;

No can do.  The idea is to have anyone b able to do this without mucking
with their system (a personal challenge of mine :-)

Well, cron'ing this wouldn't work all that well.  I've yet to grok XSL,
but it's on my todo list!

That's what I'm looking to do!

I was thinking more along the lines of 50 rows. :-)

Instead of streaming the results, you could instead write the output to
a static file and then push that back to the browser. You'd have to do
similar header() settings.
Similar approach and may work a little better for large datasets.
But for 50 Jeff's approach is solid.

Sometimes, I will actually return html tables (and call the file
foo.xls) instead of csv, but, of course, the file gets to be
significantly larger with all those tags.

Which is what I was thinking of doing with MySQL's SELECT...INTO OUTFILE
statement.

That's an interesting approach.  MS Excel will read HTML Tables...that
never enetered my mind. Hmmm, I wonder if going the other way (for
another project) would be beneficial...

this is exactly the technique I use, with one minor difference... just in case the browser has a mime handler for the mime type I'm generating, I use application/force-download to make sure the user always gets the save dialog box:


header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");
header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
header("Cache-control: private");
header("Pragma: no-cache");
header("Content-Type: application/force-download");
header('Content-Length: '.strlen($Buffer) );
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.$filename.'"');
echo $Buffer;

I've never heard of those headers.  Anyone have a good resource where
I can read up on all the available headers?

 Hiya,
 
 I've been out of the loop a lot the past year and even though
I've moved across 3 states, I still don't have internet access
of my own where I live. BUT in this great world of ours, I
can and do have local installations of Apache/1.3.31 (Win32) 
 and PHP 4.3.8 (yes, I know 5.0 is out there) installed and
tested (using the php_info() to get a page) and it's all working
as expected (except for vhosts which I think is an Apache-on
Windoze issue I'm not going to solve in this life)
 
I've been working on a site for a friend and he and I are
scheming to "prove" on his site that his boss is making a
big deal out of nothing. The site is an internet radio station
and they run contests. Sometimes they get one or two entries,
sometimes 500 or 1000 in a week. The problem is to have 
the entry form dump all its data into an excel spreadsheet
so my friend can just email that "finished product" to the
record label sponsoring the contest. I have a gut feeling this
is a snap to do but I don't have a clue where to start. Right
now, my friend's boss has each individual email sent one at
a time to him using some Yahoo! free form mail scriptwannabe
thingy. It's making him nuts on the current contest which is
easily going to get 4-digit entries that he has to manually
enter into Excel to send to the record labels.
 
Help!! clue me in on the logic, algorithmic thinking of this
behind the scenes action and if there's a module or class
out there to help me, please point me to the URL.

My friend won't care if the PHP script emails him or not
each time there's an entry. Just writing to the Excel file for
each entry is fine if at the end of the contest, he can push a
button to get the Excel file attached to an email and emailed
to him. He is not "allowed" FTP access to the site so he
can't just go get it once it's all written. Oh, and I also had
suggested he just have their contractor web developer
output the form data to a flat text file, space or comma
delimited lines that he could at least import into Excel by
hand. He'd be happy with that, too, but the boss says 
that also is "not possible." Kinda funny boss, huh?

Of course it's possible.  Jeff Siegel posted pseudo-code to me (on this
list) just last night on how to do it!  Of course, you're going to need a
database back end to store all of the entries.

If someone knows how to generat and Excel file, though, I'd be
interested in eharing how.

do a search on sourceforge.net you will find a php class for writing
excell files, however an easier way might be to just write a file in a
tab or comma delimited format ( i suggest tab because submitted data
may have ,'s in it) and then just import that file into excell

here is one page i found with a quick search
http://sourceforge.net/projects/psxlsgen/

there are solutions out there you just have to find them ;)

You can set the mime type to
application/vnd.ms-excel
with header()
or 
just name the file with a .xls extension and use
application/octet-stream

So that you don't have to had the end-user import the csv file, output
your data in a html table that would mimic the spreadsheet.
Might also help to use table border=1, else the cell lines won't be visible.

This isn't a true Excel file, however. I believe there are other tools
for that purpose.

Hey there,

One option for you is to put your form submits into a database, and
then output the whole results in a CSV file - but instruct the browser
to use Excel to open it up.

ADOdb has a native facility to output a query as a CSV file:

    http://adodb.sf.net

Then you fool the browser into thinking it is downloading an Excel
file with the following headers commands:

header('Pragma: public');
header('Last-Modified: '.gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s') . ' GMT');
header('Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate'); // HTTP/1.1
header('Cache-Control: pre-check=0, post-check=0, max-age=0'); // HTTP/1.1
header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: none');
header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="basedata.csv');
//This should work for Non IE/Opera browsers
header('Content-Type: application/octetstream; name="basedata.csv');
// This should work for IE & Opera
header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="basedata.csv');

'basedata.csv' is the bogus filename I pass just so it looks like a
real file, and so your manager will have a simple filename to save as.

If there is enough interest I can provide an example class that does just this.

It's also pretty easy to generate spreadsheets with all sorts of fancy formatting using XML... here's a good URL to get started with: http://forums.devshed.com/t69125/s.html

I have found that Excel (97 for sure) will open a tab delimited file whose
extension is XLS or CSV without any dialog or complaint. This is good and
bad as the Excel import dialog screens for delimited (TXT) files allows you
to set column data types appropriately.  

Excel tries to determine the column's datatype automatically and can get
confused if it checks the first row's data and sees a number in a given
column it assumes the whole column is numbers and will drop character data.


This conversion issue happens all of the time with zip codes where preceding
zeros are dropped, i.e., 02134 becomes 2134 and Canadian/foreign postal
codes get converted to a numeric only value.

The workaround is to make sure you have a column heading row, or insert a
row of character data (to be later deleted) as the first row and all of your
data will be preserved.

Go straight to the source -- RFC2616 defines the HTTP/1.1 protocol. It
may not be the easiest read, but it's worth checking out.

Here's the section on headers:
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html

Also, I believe our own Chris Shiftlett wrote a book on HTTP once...

Cool just a terminology issue, that I can deal with.  Thanx.. I'll have 
to take a crash course in ActionScript I believe, along with finding a 
free (open source?) Flash decompiler since the client nor myself can 
reach the original web designer with the .fla files.

Sounds like yet another web developer that deserves a visit from
cousin Vinny and his aluminum baseball bat, and Vinny don't like
baseball, knowhatimean?

*sigh*

A smart solution could be to bring in another Flash designer to
recreate the original, but tell them that they will need to include
external variables in their version to accommodate the updating text. 
That way you have something to work with, and is much more attractive
than a shot in the dark at reverse engineering a binary that lacks the
functionality your client needs anyway.

Just reviewed SAMS' "Flash MX Professional 2004 UNLEASHED" (ISBN:
0-672-32606-X), and can say that the 300-plus pages dedicated to
ActionScript 2.0 are an excellent reference on the subject.

http://www.futurecandy.com/ - Gordon is an application which
can decompile an .swf (or thereabouts). I've used it on a few
projects of mine. However, Mitch makes a good point, using
Flash developer would allow  you to make changes to the new
version of the document with the possibilities for future
changes.

On a side note... where the heck have these Flash developers
gone?  A little over a year ago they couldn't get any work...
now they can't be found. Weird.

No problem with that, however, what's the most tactful way of telling 
the guy the asking price goes up upon doing this?  You might want to 
respond offline since this is moving away from PHP as a solution as I 
see it.

Suppose you were teaching a PHP course (10 sessions x 3 hrs)  to people
who knew only HTML. What book(s) would you recommend?

Programming PHP (Lerdorf & Tatroe) is already on the list. Something that
introduces the reader to some of the universals of progamming languages --
variables, conditionals, loops -- would be helpful.

Thanks,

I've always been partial to Harry Fuecks' writing style, as it is more
explanatory than academic - and consequently easier to grasp for folks
not used to 1,200 page books ;-)

Just recieved a review copy of "Learning PHP 5" by David Sklar, and it
also looks like a good starting point that also IMHO most importantly
covers PHP 5 from the start.  Looking forward to getting that review
done, as the book appears promising ;-)

Yeah, I was going to recommend that one, too. :) I specifically tried to 
cover in the beginning of the book those universals David mentions. My 
target reader is someone who is comfortable with HTML, has maybe seen a 
little Javascript, but really has no procedural programming experience.

This is good good good, gentlemen, keep it coming (-:

The ~Cookbook~ is marvelous, but maybe premature for bare beginners, imho.

As for ~Learning PHP5~, I think I'll head over to Computer Book Works and
check it out, I haven't seen it. Is it suitable even if you expect people
to be working primarily with PHP 4 for the time being? One wonders how
long it will be before PHP 5 is widely used in production.

As for the Fuecks, yes, I picked up just Volume II the other day because I
was too cheap to get Volume I as well, now I'm kicking myself for passing
up the package deal.

I'll also take a good look at Core PHP Programming.

Thanks again,

If it doesn't have to be 5 specifically, I'd actually recommend OReilly's
"PHP Cookbook," co-authored by Mr. Sklar (with Adam Trachtenberg). WAY better
than "Programming PHP" IMHO. Tons of real-world, practical examples with code and
cogent, concise analysis. That's how I learned!

Hi David.

It seems to me there are :

1- books which try to be a paper manual (comprehensive function 
reference, tables of operators, flow-control, etc)
2- books which "introduce" PHP as a language for ______ professionals 
(website, database, specific database, application development, etc)
3- books of didactic examples (not worthy of production use, but 
demonstrative)
4- books of real-world examples (worthy of production use, but not 
demonstrative nor easy to understand)
5- books for ____ progammers to start using or switch to PHP (PHP for 
HTML programmers, PHP for perl programmers, C programmers, etc)

So in your case I could see a need for type 5.html  and maybe a type 1 
reference.

Personally I have never found a type 5.html  book I liked so i would not 
use one if I were teaching that course. As far as I have seen, they 
either teach PHP as a script drop-in to get dynamic with the HTML markup 
(to me that's nasty) or they are too advanced in PHP (trying to use PHP 
to generate every needed HTML markup string). For HTML people not well 
versed in CSS, this could be disastrous (since there are overlaps in the 
way CSS and PHP can be used for dynamic webpages - CSS can be data-based 
markup, and PHP beginners often use PHP for data-based markup).

I would teach the subject from the outside in, first approaching the 
environment of HTML (browser, server, http) and then stepping into HTML 
markup (seeing how it works with the environment) and then stepping back 
out to use PHP between the HTML markup and the environment for select 
tasks where it makes sense. Eventually those select tasks will include 
certain tasks normally considered HTML domain. This approach is 
scalable, so that if you get as far as the overlap between CSS and PHP, 
or approach XML, PHP deployment seems natural.

I have not seen a book that does that well *for beginners* but there are 
two books I feel do this well for intermediate programmers : 
Greenspan/Bulger "MySQL/PHP database applications" and Welling/Thomson 
"PHP and MySQL Web Development".

If I had to give out a book, I'd want to pick one that had lasting value 
(and that rules out the "comprehensive reference" books). A book like 
PHP Cookbook for example... with a clear communication that it is a 
reference book and not a course textbook. I hesitate to hand out 
cookbooks, however, because it is so easy to produce script kiddies that 
way.

Good question. Good luck.

Just a little creative extension here.... would you consider having 
everybody sign onto O'Reilly's Safari Bookshelf for the duration of the 
course? Ten weeks of Bookshelf costs les than a good book, and gives you 
ten titles to work with.

- students get a valuable intro to the Safari service and O'Reilly
- instructor/student can hop between appropriate chapters of up to 10 
top books... no need for compromise
- course vendor gets a commission for every user who stays with Safari 
Bookshelf - may cover some resource expenses

As an instructor, I'd love that cause I could challenge every student to 
her fullest potential (or, er, enable her to challenge herself to her 
fullest  ;-). You'll have to deal with the politics (no free 6 lbs of 
paper included in the course fee) and resource constraints (terminal 
access in class?)

On a "Learning" level, there's actually very little difference between
PHP 4 and PHP 5, so I would you'd be safe to use this book.

All the basics, like variables, conditionals, forms processing,
database access, etc., aren't different. The only major change is
objects, but that's easily segmented into its own world.

I make it a habit to purchase every book by the authors who are active 
on this list.  It would seem that my next purchase will probably be 
Chris Shifflet's security book when it hits.  Adam's "Upgrading to PHP 
5" is in the mail.

Having over 15,000 hours on the floor teaching technical subjects, 
assembler, operating systems, networking, and a few high-level languages 
on the way, I normally would not recommend an O'Reilly book for 
beginners -- read beginners.  The exception would be if the book is 
accompanied by a clearly written student wookbook that roughly parallels 
the text material.  It has to do with O'Reilly's style--and I'm talking 
typography, overall format and busyness.  I would use David Sklar's 
"Learning PHP 5" book along with a a student workbook, and I may write 
my next course using it.

That said, there is a little known book for beginners that I would 
recommend.  It's called "PHP by Example" and the author is Toby Butzon. 
  It is published by Que.

John, the Safari suggestion is quite intriguing. I ought to add here that
there is not going to be ~any~ required text at all. There will be
~recommended~ texts, and suggested supplemental readings therefrom. (One
of the main objectives will be to teach them to understand and use
php.net/manual/[your language]/, mother of all M's ) That being the case,
the Safari might be especially well suited. Thanks for the tip.

We still have a few seats open for the two-day session scheduled for
27-28 September. I can now give you further information about that
session. It will be taught by Jeff Siegel, the President of
EZ Data Solutions, and Project Manager for NYPHP's PHundamentals. He
will use Lerdorf and Tatroe's excellent "Programming PHP" (O'Reilly)
as the textbook. The course is designed to move you quickly but
thoroughly through PHP essentials and database design, providing you
with in-depth knowledge of using PHP to develop a database-driven web
application. More details about the curriculum are at
http://nyphp.org/content/training/twodaycourse.php.

Instruction will take place on Windows-based computers, at a
mid-Manhattan location. All students will receive a copy of the text,
as well as copies of all course materials.

The fee of $780 for the two-day session covers everything except
meals.  We can accept checks or credit cards, and can invoice an
organization.

We hope to see you at this session.  If you would like more
information, please contact me directly at the email address below.

Out of curiosity...where are you all teaching these courses? Are they
in colleges/universities, or other types.  I'm heading off to college
next year and I haven't found a college that has offered a course on
Web Programming (just Computer Science, which I'm assuming is Java /
C++).

The only significant PHP 5-only things in the book are use of the 
file_put_contents() function and SimpleXML. Other PHP 5 stuff that's 
mentioned briefly or out of the main flow of the text includes E_STRICT, 
  mysqli, the introduction to classes and objects, and glimpses of DOM, 
SQLite, and the Perl extension.

The vast bulk of the book (basic language concepts, form processing, 
database stuff, etc.) is PHP 4-or-5 agnostic.

I've been fighting a mostly uphill battle to get Open Source courses 
into community colleges and universities in the Denver area.  So far I 
have 4 schools offering courses on their Fall schedules.  Now, if only 
schools knew how to market I'd be *rolling* in classes :)

PEAR is the answer to everything
http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request

You can send requests as get or post and evaluate the response. You 
should be able to do anything you want with this class.

I was gonna say cURL, but it requires a custom config, no?

If you really want to get your code on, you can always build your own
HTTP Post request and use fsockopen() to stream it out to the remote
server. This is easier than it sounds, and incredibly instructive.

But if you just want to get the job done and move on, the Pear class
is probably the way to go.

It's a non-credit course, at NYU, School of Continuing and Professional
Studies ...and I think this department has a formal name like Information
Technology Institute. This PHP class is new, they offered it once last
spring.

Hi gang,

Winner of this one gets a beer at the next meet.

Say you have a collection of scores, 536 to be exact.  You need to
chop them up into deciles (first 10%, second 10%, etc.)

Now, take the score from the median, and add it to the last score in
the first decile.  Anything above that score gets 100 points.  Simple
enough, right?

But what if these scores include positive AND negative integers.  Then
'normal' math gives the wrong result...

So if the median is 2, and the last score in the first decile is -10,
I get -8.  That also is expected.

But if the median is 1, and the last score in the first decile is -7,
then I get -6.  I need -8, which is the problem...

What is the PHP way(TM) to get this behavior without doing a pile of
checks for whether the scores to compare are negative or not?

-- Mitch, alarmed that his math skills are so pitiful

In order to win a beer I offer this quick response before thinking 
through the details :-)

Offset the scores befoe doing the math, by some constant that is more 
than the expected abs(max score). the shift is neutral with respect to 
your comparisons, and can be removed when you have your results.

I don't see any more to it, assuming that your scores are ordinal (-10 
is a lower score than -8, which is a lower score than any positive score).

...

You don't have to offset all the scores.  Just take the lowest score
and use that as your offset for the first decile.  Just do this very
simple process:

Let's say the lowest score is -10, median score is 20, top of first
decile is -5.

Subtract your lowest score from your first decile.  You have an
adjusted first decile of 5 (-5 - -10).

Add your median and adjusted first decile together.  Now you
have 20 + 5 = 25.

Probably easier to use CURL if they won't take GET, but it's not too
tough to build the HTTP request either way.

Scream at me offline if you need some sample code (I'm kinda hard of hearing).

You can speed up DNS updates merely by lowering the TTL. All Verisign 
are doing artifically is increasing the rate of manual zone transfers 
instead of relying solely on the TTL.

I?ve also had good luck with lowering the TTL a few days before a transfer.
I?ve been able to get many transfers to go through in about an hour that
way.

There?s been some confusion here after reading that press release, and I bet
a few people on this list know the answer. Since this press release is from
Verisign, it automatically includes Network Solutions, correct? Would it
influence any of the other registrars, like Dotster or Register.com? Does
Verisign also control the root servers?

Just thought I'd mention this little tidbit...

... I posted recently about getting Oracle up and running with
PHP 5. After I did that, and ran the development pieces I was
working on, we had our DBA setup a similar setup. He choose to
go with PHP 4.3.8 for whatever reason, and was having issues
trying to get it setup.

In the end, it was due to the configure command not returning
any errors even though it was pretty much missing. --with-OCI8
will fail because of the case sensitive input. It needs to be
--with-oci8, instead.

Just thought I'd put this out there in case someone every
needed the info handy.

Hello all,

I'm looking for input on taking any image format and overlaying 
customized text that a client enters for "proofing" a product order on a 
website.

Before I launch into some research, this strikes me as doable with php 
and gd... any experience on this?

thanks,
John

yep.. it's pretty easy...
createimagefrom{gif/png/jpeg}()
imagetext() to add text to it
header() to set the proper content type
image{png/jpeg}() to output the revised image to browser/file

watch out for stray chars before the header or image output.

I have done this using GD with PHP. One thing to watch out for is to 
remember where the origin is and also when drawing text, remember that 
the coordinates used are the coordinates of the left side of the 
baseline of the text - in other words there will be letters that will 
fall below as well as above the baseline and this needs to be taken into 
account when drawing text.

The function I wrote overlayed text onto a banner - I would calculate 
the text size inside a loop that dropped the point size on each 
iteration, exiting the loop only when the text would fit inside the 
banner (I also centered the text before drawing).

Though, of course, nothing is 100% secure.

If an attacker has found an exploit that allows them to inject code 
(which is your REAL problem, not the exposure of session data) or if 
you're on a shared server, there are several options.

If the session data is stored on disk and the directory it is stored 
in is known and the file permissions on that dir are too permissive, 
the cracker can use opendir() and then loop through the directory to 
gather the contents of each file.

Similarly, the session file name is based on the session id (which can 
be obtained via snooping) and they know the directory, a cracker can 
open the file directly, like this:

   file_get_contents('c:/temp/sess_k8s35ou54m9710jc05lfcgssj5');

The session data can be altered as well.

So, if there's any really sensitive data or data that could be used to 
escalate privileges, it's probably best not stored in a database 
rather than the session data.

Ugh.  I changed the way I was saying that last sentence in mid stream 
and forgot to take out the "not."  So, make that

   [when it comes to sensitive data] it's probably best stored in
   a database rather than the session data.

I mean things like Friendster, Ryze, Orkutz (or whatever it's called).
Some are social networks, some are business related. They're friend of
a friend, so your circle is made up of people you've invited, and they
invite, etc. If you grew up in the US in the 70s, think that shampoo
commercial where some woman told 2 friends, and they told 2 friends,
etc.

Somebody did one called Slashter, which you can download the code for.
Believe it it's in PHP (On Topic? WHat?) I signed up, and invited you,
Joe! Anyone else who wants to join the group to see what it's like
contact me.

I just tried sending another one. Being able to actually invite people
seems pretty important in an invitation only system, doesn't it? :)

I'm curious if any of we listgeeks have seen "special" or "modified"
keyboards with inventive answers to questions like:

Wouldn't it be nice if parentheses were on their own keys?
...if curly braces...?
...if [some character set]... ?

Anyone seen something like this at all of late?

Computer science is independent of programming languages. Most programs
tend to teach something fundamental like C as a first semester course and
use that to demonstrate the theoretical principles taught in other
courses. A programming language course might teach several languages, but
it is more likely to focus on principles.

Of course, the practical stuff is much easier to learn on your own, and
you're likely to do exactly that as you make your way through the CS
program. For example, when taking a class on software engineering, the
class will be teaching you about UML, patterns, and things like that.
However, you'll most likely be required to create a project that
incorporates what you're learning. I wanted to learn to write Web
applications with Perl, so I chose such a thing as my project. The class
wasn't about Perl, the Web, or anything practical, but I forced myself to
learn those things by choosing the project I did.

If you go on to get your Masters, you'll probably find more options in
terms of focusing on one topic like the Web.

There's cURL, various PEAR modules, and the manual method:

Hope that helps.

Just the happy hacking keyboard, which is sort of the opposite:

But you're touch typing anyway, right? Why not just remap the keys you want?

You can remap your keyboard in some operating systems (like Linux:
http://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/usersguide/linux_ugterminal.html).

I have an extra keyboard at home I'm going to cut up to remove and
disable most keys other than letter and numbers - I have a 14 month old
daughter who sometimes plays games of the bang on the keyboard and make
Elmo laugh variety, and she invariably hits ESC, function keys, etc.,
which do undesireable and sometimes odd things.

This looney genius dude did some physical keyboard modding:

I don't *quite* touch type, especially when copying (composition is much
closer). Never had a keyboarding class. It's really just to cut down on
typos from the Shift key, for various and sundry reasons.

Ain't it adorable? There some's PHP out there in production today that has
comments that my baby daughter contributed. Something like

/*
zzzzzzzzz,,,,,,,,,,,,
qwe[09r8u asdjjj

Sounds like comments my cat would leave for me. Translated from the native
it would probably mean 
"Your bed is too small for both of us. Start sleeping on the couch, and feed
me earlier."

Any British ex-pats on this list?

Anyone here remember the microwriter one-handed keyboard from the 70s? 
Basically all the symbols were represented by just 5 or 6 keys that you 
pressed in various combinations with one hand (apparently, once you got 
past the learning curve you could type at "stenographer speed"). There 
is a modern day version still available:

<http://www.bellaire.demon.co.uk/newcykey.htm>

Most susequent chorded keyboards were based on similar ideas.


And there was even a PDA based on it on the UK which won a design award 
in 1990:

<http://www.geoff.org.uk/museum/microwriter.htm>
(Note five keys in a paw shape around the regular keyboard)


Then there's wacky modern stuff like this:

Hello everyone:

I have been using this list as a resource as I put together a membership organization web site.  Thanks for the assistance.  The discussions really came in handy on a number of ocassions as I tried to "get my mind right."

I'm a business guy and not much of a programmer, so I'm a bit reluctant to call it to the attention of the skilled artisans on this list. On the other hand, the subject matter of the organization may be of interest to you.

The site is for ATIDO: The Alliance of Technology and International Development Organizations.  The mission of ATIDO is to facilitate business development and partnering for tech companies as they expand beyond their local markets and across borders.  If you are looking for business across the country or overseas, ATIDO was conceived to help you find it.  And to help it find you.

ATIDO will launch slowly between now and the end of the year.  The membership is made up of companies rather than of individuals, but if any members of this list wish to register their companies they may do so by using the PROMOTION CODE: NYP0104 .  Simply go to the site www.atido.org and click the "join" link.  Or, if you have one, ask your director of business development to register.

Of course, I also welcome comments, criticism and suggestions.  I'm interested in thoughts about the business proposition as well as of the rather basic use of PHP.

Cheers,

Bill

Not to discourage anyone from sharing but did you realize you could
virtually mount your gmail account in Linux? (giving you some nice space)
:-) And then shared with libgmail ... Pretty cool stuff.

hello list :

i am working on a secure donation form.  when i view the page through 
the https protocol on safari (os x & win xp) and camino (os x), the 
page appears without the styles defined in an external styles sheet 
used by the whole site.  it is as if the link to the style sheet is bad 
and it simply isn't being imported.

when viewed on safari or IE on windows xp, it looks just fine.

i have played with making the reference to the style sheet as a full 
https reference and that doesn't seem to help.

any ideas?

thanks,

stephen

Yes, you can definitely do this in Windows.  I spilled coffee on a part 
of my laptop keyboard and now the down key isn't working, so I had to 
remap it to the right-ctrl key.  Works like a charm.  I used a program 
called KeyTweak that modifies the keymap in Windows.

Enjoy.

P.S. I have 4 gmail invites left as well, if anybody still needs some.

Good question .. Im sure your could create a G:/ drive somehow :-)

Anyways more on my blog somewhere about it ...

http://www.jonbaer.net/

Gmail Filesystem .. Id guess you could install python, libgmail, and get
something running on Windows .. Maybe create a mini local ftp server, map
the drive, and whala (well maybe not *that* easy) ..

The https scheme is being used for the parent resource, it sounds like,
and the embedded resources are not secure. You want to either use relative
URLs for your embedded resources, or you want to specify an absolute URL
using the https scheme rather than http.

Hope that makes sense.

Out of curiosity, you say that this doesn't work on Safari, and then you
say that it does work on Safari. I should hope that IE is the only browser
this insecure.

I don't recall having problems with an xml header, although I haven't looked
and it's been a while... 
 
if it's a php file it might just be the short tags setting in your php.ini.
If short tags are on, you'll have to echo the xml declaration tag:
 
echo '<?xml version="1.0"?>';

You might be able to do this in Windows, but "this" is GmailFS, not
keymapping. That's a different thread. :-)

Here's the head:

charset=iso-8859-1" />
	<link rel="stylesheet" title="Default" href="/css/default.css"

It doesn't seem to make a difference even if I change it to this:

<head>
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; 
charset=iso-8859-1" />
	<link rel="stylesheet" title="Default" 
href="https://servername.com/css/default.css" type="text/css" />

Yeah, I think I understand this.  I just responded to Chris Snyder's

Good catch.  I should have said "firefox".  Here is the revised copy in 
question:

"i am working on a secure donation form.  when i view the page through 
the https protocol on FIREFOX (os x & win xp) and camino (os x), the 
page appears without the styles defined in an external styles sheet 
used by the whole site.  it is as if the link to the style sheet is bad 
and it simply isn't being imported."

Seems like mozilla issue?

Thanks!!!!

But, did you do a hard refresh of the page since you made that 
change (CTRL-SHIFT during)?  Sometimes things are coming from cache.

Also, is the CSS file really there and correct?  Browse to that URI 
directly to make sure what comes up.

Yeah, I did get the wrong threat.  Well, hopefully that KeyTweak thing 
will help somebody who spills something onto their laptop. ;)

As far as gmail invites go, I think sending them to @gmail.com people 
won't work.

Oh, and haven't heard of a gmailfs clone for Windows.  Libgmail is 
written in Python though, so I don't think it'd be too hard to write 
something that does this sort of thing.  The hard part would obviously 
be writing an actual file system driver that you could mount in windows, 
it probably wouldn't be hard to write a little app that lets you drag 
and drop files into it and drag them out of your gmail storage into a 
folder.

http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/

libgmail has an example that sets up an ftp server on port 8021, so in 
theory you could hodge-podge something that mounts that ftp server into 
your Windows Explorer folder hierarchy.

Message-ID: <20040910232846.1D2ACA85F3@virtu.nyphp.org>

Can anyone help me with this? I'm struggling through another PEAR package's
documentation and can't find what I need.

The Table package looks like it will do what I need to do, but I can't find
an example of quite what I'm looking for.

I have an array of thumbnail images.

I want to build a table 3 columns and however many rows are required.

The reason I am even using PEAR at all is for the autofill capability...I
was having a hard time figuring out how to deal with a last row that can
have from 1 to 3 cells.

All the examples I can find show building the table from a multidimensional
array...is there a way to just specify number of cols, an array of data and
get back a table?

Thanks,
John

i'm pretty sure cache isn't the issue.

here's what's interesting about that.  when i browses the URI, 
referring to it with https, it downloaded the file to my downloads 
folder instead of showing.  when i browsed with http, it showed the 
contents of the css file in the browser as i would expect.  this was 
the case with camino, firefox and safari in OS X.

thanks!!!

This is the correct way to include the stylesheet, that way it is 
independent of whether the user is using http or https.

I think your problem may be related to the way gecko browsers handle 
stylesheet declarations with the closing slash ala XHTML.  If you change 
the stylesheet link to:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/default.css" 
title="Default"></link>

You may find it now works in gecko browsers.

So...even though it sort of feels 'dirty'...I'll just use array_chunk to put
my array into 3 separate arrays and then use those as the cols for
HTML_Table.

It'll work, but I'm interested if anyone knows a cleaner way.

Hey John,

Don't know about PEAR, but below's a class I set up for that purpose. 
It doesn't generate the <table> and </table> tags, just the rows.
When you create the object, give it a cell template, a template for 
empy cells and the max number of columns. Then give it an array of 
values with the "parse" method. I made a few changes before pasting it 
on here, so tell me if you have any problems with it.

Hope that helps,
-jose
www.josevillegasdesign.com

******

Your cell templates could look like this:
$cellTemplate = '<td><img src="images/{image-name}.jpg"><br>
{description}</td>
';
$emptyTemplate = '<td></td>
');

Your array of values would look like this:
$values = array(
	array(
		'image-name' => 'sunset',
		'description' => 'Florida Sunset'
	),
	array(
		'image-name' => 'palm-trees',
		'description' => 'Florida Palm Trees'
	)
);

You would create your rows like this:
$trg = new TableRowGenerator($cellTemplate, $emptyTemplate, 3);
$tableRows = $trg->parse($values);

******

class TableRowGenerator
{
	var $cellTemplate = null;
	var $emptyCellTemplate = null;
	var $maxColumns = 1;
	var $rowPrefix = '<tr>
';
	var $rowSuffix = '</tr>
';
	var $cellDivider = '';
	
	// Private properties.
	var $nextColumn = 1;
	
	function TableRowGenerator($cellTemplate, $emptyCellTemplate, 
$maxColumns)
	{
		$this->cellTemplate = $cellTemplate;
		$this->emptyCellTemplate = $emptyCellTemplate;
		$this->maxColumns = $maxColumns;
	}
	
	function parse($values)
	{
		if (!$values) return;
		$valuesCount = count($values);
		if ($valuesCount == 0) return;

		// Set up tag elements.

Having used Gecko based browsers for quite a while now and writing 
tons of web pages I can definitively say empty elements like <link /> 
are not a problem.

Sounds like your httpd_conf needs tweaking.  What do you have in there 
for .css files?  Might want to add an AddType directive.

Sorry John, I missed the part about not wanting a multidimensional 
array. I made some slight modifications that should make this class 
work with a simple array. I didn't test it, so let me know if it 
doesn't work.

Now your templates should look like this:

$cellTemplate = '<td><img src="images/{IMAGE}.jpg"></td>
';
$emptyTemplate = '<td></td>
');

Your array of values can look like this:
$values = array(
	'sunset',
	'palm-trees'
);

The rows are created the same way:
$trg = new TableRowGenerator($cellTemplate, $emptyTemplate, 3);
$tableRows = $trg->parse($values);

-jose

******

class TableRowGenerator
{
	var $cellTemplate = null;
	var $emptyCellTemplate = null;
	var $maxColumns = 1;
	var $rowPrefix = '<tr>
';
	var $rowSuffix = '</tr>
';
	var $cellDivider = '';
	
	// Private properties.
	var $nextColumn = 1;
	
	function TableRowGenerator($cellTemplate, $emptyCellTemplate, 
$maxColumns)
	{
		$this->cellTemplate = $cellTemplate;
		$this->emptyCellTemplate = $emptyCellTemplate;
		$this->maxColumns = $maxColumns;
	}
	
	function parse($values)
	{
		if (!$values) return;
		$valuesCount = count($values);
		if ($valuesCount == 0) return;

		// Set up tag elements.
		$prefix = '{';
		$suffix = '}';

		$mod = $valuesCount % $this->maxColumns;
		if ($mod != 0)
		{
			$emptyCellCount = $this->maxColumns - $mod;

Yeah, we're on the same path here.  The hosting provider is looking 
into and I'll know more in the morning.  It sounds like the server 
isn't sending the proper MIME type and while other, less secure 
browsers are accepting it, Mozilla is saying, "eh, no."  Does that 
sound about right?

Fair enough, I just remembered having issues with older firefox builds 
when in quirks mode...with recent builds I haven't had a problem.  From 
the rest of the thread info it appears to be a mime type issue.

The XML header tag shouldn't cause you difficulties.
 
What version of Flash?
 
Having messed with this a few times, I have to recommend the very helpful
XMLtoObject.as script...

	I don't recall having problems with an xml header, although I
haven't looked and it's been a while... 
	 
	if it's a php file it might just be the short tags setting in your
php.ini.  If short tags are on, you'll have to echo the xml declaration tag:
	 
	echo '<?xml version="1.0"?>';

Hi guys.

I have been documenting the NYPHP lists configuration,  and preparing a 
FAQ page on setting Mozilla/Firefox mail filters. If you set your 
filters correctly, your inbox stays sorted by list, with [OT] posts in a 
subfolder of the list folder.

The past day or so has seen a large number of OFF TOPIC posts to 
NYPHP-Talk (which is fine I guess) but they have been mis-labeled. Some 
have properly included [OT] at the start of the subject, but others have 
used [ot], _OT_ and  OT .

In order to keep the list "clean" and manageable, can we please try and 
mark your off-topic posts using [OT] at the *start* of the subject line?

Thanks.   -=john andrews

Should I change my underwear before I post? What if it is clean, but
has the wrong day of the week embroidered on the back?

Seriosly though, shouldn't offtopic posts just simply go to another list?

I completely agree.  I came home from school today, checked my E-Mail,
and there was about 5 different replies to one original thread all
marked with different [OT] tags, meaning they did not properly log
into the Gmail conversation system.

One more thing you might want to check out if you installed the developer 
tools along with the core Firefox or Moz browser:

Tools > JavaScript Console

Sometimes I find CSS mime type errors in there.  They tend to die quietly 
and often don't notice them in the list until I'm hunting some other JS 
bug.

Brian,

i completely agree, the threading in gmail is a nice feature and if
all messages kept the same format it would be nice ;)

What would really be nice is an 'advanced users' option on most apps that
are essentially db front ends  (search engines/apps, browsers - xhtml is
subset of a data format, email clients, etc), which allowed custom regex.  I
mean regex IS a well documented language.

I don't think we need to all use only gmail. And sometimes the subject 
changes, so people change the subject line.

I think a good argument could be made that the thread 
about styles sheets (CSS) should have been posted to 
the front end list.

I could do with less talk about Gmail -- 
particularly stuff like whether you can use it 
as an adjunct to your filesystem  
(and how to accomplish the same with different 
operating systems). 

But here I am straying off topic...

How about this...  If you have a gmail accounts to offer, say so in your
signature with a note about asking you off list.  I personally don't mind
the extra few emails here and I'm generally against reprimanding people for
being social, but I'm very sure some of the people on this list would prefer
less noise. 

Thanks guys.

There was a discussion about Gmail last night with some guys from Google:

http://3gp.us/videos/20040911003347687.3gp

It gets a lot of attention right now because it's by invitation only, so
everyone who gets an account feels special. :-)

But, there are some technical merits that I think we can all learn from.
After last month's presentation on XUL, I think it is becoming clear that
Web development in the near future will involve fewer HTTP transactions
and more client-side logic. The client-side logic might be fancy DHTML
stuff, XUL, Flash (think Flickr), etc.

I absolutely agree, and I've been spouting on about such things for years
now - mostly drunkenly at various people at various bars around the city.
It's the reason I got into flash, as javascript and dhtml support was always
such a pain to get to work everywhere.  But flash has it's own issues and
PLENTY of them (ahem... ide).  I was truly disappointed with their recent
strategy in the Central licensing (they own a percentage of every app you
put out there).  Central is a desktop / browser based client based on flash
with tons of potential, but bad biz.

Now with Moz owning 15% of the market and standards intensive browsers
becoming the name of the game, these 'rich applications' (oooh buzzwords)
are beginning to give me that buzz in my stomach again.  Even better we're
talking about non-plug-in solutions.  XUL is very cool, but still has a ways
to go, DHTML is old and better supported, Javascript is old and better
supported.  These are definitely interesting times.

Oh, and on a similar subject, Check out Mr Fuecks' articles on implementing
such things:

6 more posts today about gmail.. all off-topic, none of them marked as [OT].

This list will deteriorate rapidly if the quality isn't maintained, and 
posting chit chat about gmail is not ON TOPIC for PHP-talk.

so let me ask this, if you are sick of OT posts about gmail, why would
you create a new one like this rather than reply to one that is
already started?

Sorry i dont mean to be rude, but why complain if you are going to do
this yourself...

I must admin i was the one to start the gmail thread, i will not post
anything else about gmail because it looks like people are mangling
the headers or changing the subjects to make things crazy.

If anyone wants a gmail account in the future please contact me OFF
LIST using codebowl at gmail.com and if i have any invites i will invite
you.

To everyone on the list

I apologize for starting this thread it seems to have done nothing
more than cause problems ;)

Maybe I'm more cynical, but I was beginning to think that Microsoft's
success in strangling innovation on the Web was going to persist
indefinitely. I feel like we're just now beginning to return to where we
were ten years ago.

> But flash has it's own issues and PLENTY of them

I've always hated Flash, but things like Flickr are making me change my
mind. I really thought Strongbad was the only good thing done in Flash,
but I'm now realizing (possibly way later than most of you) that Flash is
a very powerful client-side technology that is likely to play a big part
in this new future of the Web that seems to just now be planting seeds.
I've even thought of buying some Macromedia stock. :-)

> Now with Moz owning 15% of the market and standards intensive

Exactly. For the first time in nearly a decade, I'm excited about the
possibilities again. Now I just need to catch up. :-)

I checked out the Gmail FAQs and saw they say that the email message is private between sender and receiver.  I may be a suspicious person, but that may change as people learn how to manipulate the technology.
 
Also, there is a central computer scanning the message to display advertisements.  Goggle compares it to other email services that scans for viruses, etc., but Goggle goes one crucial step further needing to save the scan to do a compare to find a "targeted" ad.
 
"Google scans the text of Gmail messages in order to filter spam and detect viruses, just as all major webmail services do. Google also uses this scanning technology to deliver targeted text ads and other related information. This is completely automated and involves no humans."   and
 
"Google believes that showing relevant advertising offers more value to users than displaying random pop-ups or untargeted banner ads. In Gmail, users will see text ads and links to related pages that are relevant to the content of their messages."
 
You know, spyware does the same thing...  Anyway, the last thing I want is MORE ads--targeted or otherwise!  Yahoo gives an ad at the top of the screen, and it's gone as I scroll down.
 
Thanks for the invite, though, and, John, sorry for the extra work my post caused :)

This thread is the first I've heard of this.  It IS good news.  But I 
was curious about the stats so Googled around and found these month by 
month breakdowns: http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp

What I found interesting is, from a quick look, the bulk of the 
Mozilla usage increase, particularly prior to June 2004, seems to have 
come from people who used IE5 upgrading to Mozilla instead of 
upgrading to IE6.

It also mentions that ~10% of browsers have JS turned off, thank you 
very much. :)

It was a reply. That's why it had "Re:" in the subject line.

I believe it was the Presdient and founder of NYPHP who posted this 
recently regarding OT posts:

It's not my decision, it's a collective decision for everyone making up 
the PHP-Talk list community. If the community wants this  list to become 
a generic "this has nothing to do with PHP but I think it's cool and 
worth chatting about" then so be it...  and I and others who seek high 
signal PHP content will go to such as perhaps

http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php or 
http://news.php.net/group.php?group=php.windows or
http://pecl.php.net/support.php or http://pear.php.net/support/lists.php

Daniel Brandt (author of the page you cited) has a very long history of 
anti-Google "advocacy". Google him and you will see his bias, and that 
he is a very prolific anti-Google writer.
My comments steer clear of agreeing or disagreeing with Mr. Brandt. I 
just feel it is important to know the source of your information.

If you are interested in GMail and privacy, you should read how Tim 
O'Reilly gets it wrong, too : http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/4707

Now since little ole' me I just went on record saying Tim O'Reilly is 
wrong (sound of lighting bolt striking me dead), let me highlight that 
this is a might complex issue. While I believe Mr. O'Reilly got it all 
wrong when he wrote those 4 items in the first half of his article ( 
privacy being no big deal, Gmail not being worse than ISPs and hotmail, 
etc),  I also note that he is an expert technologist with deep insight 
into how technology advances. The second part of his article very 
clearly demonstrates the source of his blindness to the evil that is 
Gmail - he is passionate about technology, acutely aware of the 
potential for advancement by leaps and bounds from where we are 
seemingly stuck these days, and aparently enamored with the way in which 
Google seems to be able to make leaps (as they have done with Gmail) 
while others cannot. O'Reilly wants and needs to see us advance to the 
next stage, and is exhuberant about the possibilities brought on by the 
Googleplex. Gmail just may take us to that very, very exciting next 
place....

At what cost? To the consummate technologist, is any cost too great? I 
think many people are willing to sacrifice a great deal to play in the 
future space.

Ditto for genetic research, stem cell research, robotics and artificial 
intelligence, and every other potential Pandora's box we humans like to 
dance around.

I have been creating a credit card validation module for a client.  I was 
wondering if you can force a POST method within a page.  The client does not 
want the customer to leave their website, but wants to validate and credit 
the credit card.  I worked with another system awhile ago where I can create 
a XML file and send it to the getway and return a SUCCESS or FAIL code, but 
with this new system I'm working with, I can't.  So I was wondering if I can 
collect data on a form and post all the information to a page within the 
website, receiving page will in turn post the information to the getway and 
get a "answer" to the data?

Article by Marco Tabini with a similar sentiment:
http://blogs.phparch.com/mt/index.php?p=25 


And to the recent complaints that this has little to do with php, I beg to
differ.  Of the 6 or so flash projects I've worked on this year small to
large (one being a touch-screen kiosk for malls in the UK), ALL of them
required a good backend for instant dynamic content.  Of course, PHP was my
solution, which allowed me to offer all my clients an easy-to-install
management app on any OS they require for both the clients (for local data
propagation on the kiosk) and the servers (for data management,
distribution, etc).

Indirect maybe, but still useful and important.

The "complaints" we about mis-labeled off-topic posts to the PHP list,  
and "can I have an account" Gmail posts.

Even your message about flash and PHP is labeled "Re: gmail"

Chris Shifflett's post about "There was a discussion about Gmail last 
night with some guys from 
Google:http://3gp.us/videos/20040911003347687.3gp"
gave us that wonderful link... to a handheld video clip of nothing. 
Seriously.. look at it.. handheld video of a meeting, not in progress, 
where "nothing is happening".

When you suggested people complained about Flash having nothing to do 
with PHP, I felt it necessary to respond -- the complaints are about 
quality of these posts.

I guess I just don't "get it" so I will stop now.

Here is a message posted in another list, I wanted to know what the
NYPHP gang thought.  Also, curious to see if there are better
solutions that are done serverside (in PHP, of course!) or if we
really do need to rely on client-side checks?

function noXSS ($input)
{
      # convert all input charakters to lowercase and convert ascii
encoded charakters to normal charakters
      $inputTmp = trim(asciiDecode(strtolower($input)));
           # check if the user wants to execute javascript
      if (substr($inputTmp, 0, 11) == 'javascript:') {
          trigger_error("Someone tried to exploit our UBB system!

   foreach ($asciiCodes as $asciiNr)
       $input = str_replace("&#$asciiNr;", chr($asciiNr), $input);
   return $input;

?>

The only thing it doen't stop is:
<?php
// script.php

Is there a better way to do this?

Frightens me that you say that Shiflett, can't imagine web ever really
going client side...sure, more client side logic, but we still need a
server to make the magic.

Besides, if that happens, what will you write about next?

Message-ID: <1F3CD8DDFB6A9B4C9B8DD06E4A7DE358B87EE5@network.PLMresearch.com>

I'm getting the following error when I try to download into Excel

"Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already sent by (output
started at .../program_files/include/header.php:36) in
.../program_files/form.php on line 466"


I use a the following code to extract, format and display the information
from MySQL:


$csv = build_csv($res_contacts, $fields_labels_ar);
ob_end_clean();
header("Content-Type: text/x-csv");
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.$table_name.'.csv"');
echo $csv;
exit;

Would have thought that ob_end_clean would have flushed the prior header.
Can anyone shed some light?

I probably gave the wrong link, since I didn't actually preview the video
(I was present), but it should have been:

http://3gp.us/videos/20040910232147833.3gp

Luckily, the point of my email didn't rely on the video of that meeting -
it was given in the hopes that it offered more precision than my synopsis
(and people like to get information straight from the source). If you had
kept up with the discussion at all, you might understand. The discussion
is no more off-topic than last month's meeting on XUL (I don't think
either are off-topic; it was a good presentation).

As for quality of posts, you're welcome to add a filter that discards
messages from my email address. If I felt there were others who shared
your opinion, I wouldn't bother answering questions or participating in
discussions, but hopefully that's not the case.

Yeah, I didn't mean to suggest that more of the important stuff will be
moved to the client side. I just mean that I think we're going to finally
see more innovation in user interfaces. I think most of us are more
interested in the "business logic" or whatever you want to call the
important stuff, and I can't imagine that being anywhere except the server
without us moving toward some P2P model.

My brief dissection of Gmail suggests that HTTP transactions are still
taking place on a lot of those page loads that don't feel like page loads
(like when you click Inbox from another folder). They're just very tiny,
and the stuff returned isn't a Web page but rather a few bits of important
data that is incorporated into the interface using JavaScript.

I wouldn't be surprised to be completely wrong, but the things I've
observed lately that made me change my attitude toward client-side
technologies include:

1. The XUL presentation at last month's meeting.
2. My  discoveries while dissecting Gmail a bit.
3. My exploration of what makes Flickr so appealing.
4. Firefox's recent surge in popularity.
5. php|architect developing a Flash-based training solution for
cross-platform availability.

Just in case you think I'm wacky, that's at least a bit of my reasoning.
:-)

> Besides, if that happens, what will you write about next?

Hopefully the next Harry Potter, also known as XUL and the Sorcerer's
Stone. I just have to figure out this XUL stuff sometime.

Take a look at header.php line 36.  It could be an extra space or newline at
the end of a file or an errant echo.

PHP is telling you that headers have already been output, so it can't create
it's own for your file headers.  When ANYTHING is output by the php parser,
php throws out some bs headers t oensure that some kind of html is sent to
the browser (please correct me if that's not the reason).  Make sure your
scripts aren't outputting ANYTHING before using the header function.

Just to add to this, since it looked like you were using output buffering,
you want to check to make sure your call to ob_start() happens prior to
that part that PHP is complaining about. The ob_end_clean() call should
not output anything, as you were assuming, but there is definitely some
output being generated either prior to ob_start() or after the first
encounter of something like ob_end_clean(), since that turns off output
buffering.

Hope that helps.

Message-ID: <!~!UENERkVCMDkAAQACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgAAAAAAAAA5CwFXLZmukKQxR/D3MODdMKAAAAQAAAA8xQh0bSmb0eRzRDTP7iQBQEAAAAA@bigpond.net.au>

Hi,

I'm new to this list - have not been lurking long, new to php but having a
lot of fun and getting good results with it - it's just what I like - small
pieces of code and spot on results.

I have a routine for inserting text into an image (cobbled together from
pieces of code from here and there + my own mods) - I'm using it to put
handwritten text onto the image of a piece of lined writing paper, where the
text is in a plain text file.  

See here http://www.wardair.com.au/ImageTextCheck.html

I'd like to be able to automatically 'highlight' some lines of text similar
to this image http://www.wardair.com.au/images/notebooktest.jpg

Not sure how to go about it - would I need to 'embed' image(s) for the
highlight before putting the text on?  Or possibly someone else has
done/seen something like this where it is straight php code.  I won't know
where on the page the highlight is to go before run-time.

Any help/links/ideas most welcome.

.Sharon

Mark and Chris,

That did the trick (ob_start prior to the part that PHP was complaining
about).  First time using output buffering for me (could you guess ;-).

Really appreciate the help.

I would go about this eitheir by determining the area that needed to be
highlighted and merging a highlight image into that space prior to
placing the letters (your "font" is actually made up of a bunch of
images, right?)

or create another font which has the highlight already.
This would probably be easier, but I don't know how you're populating
the text.

To summarize: you could use PEAR http_Request, the cURL functions, or
build the POST request and send it via fsockopen().

look away for a few days and the list goes insane..

SO..
I posted some code:
http://edit.peoplesdns.com/index.php?show=14
This is for a simple templating system I developed for historyagent and
have since modified to use for my work and a couple other places.

In the comments are some benchmarks on eregi_replace and str_replace
which surprised me, I had thought that ereg functions would be faster,
but in this case, they are are far from it.

Thanks Brian.

I am taking a copy of an existing image for the background, then using
imagefttext to insert each line of text into it using a font and text
specified by the client.  Creating a new font would be a problem as the
client has a set of fonts they wish to choose from on the fly when putting
up content.  Probably the first idea is better, however I wish to make it
look like a hand drawn line has been put through it with a thick marker pen.

Maybe a highlight image divided into end points and middle section which I
can lengthen as needed.  I might try that to start with.

Guys,

i have been working with custom exception classes that extend the
general exception.  Here is some code i have

	public function command($cmd) {
		if($cmd) {
			$res = fputs($this->connection, $cmd);
			$this->response = fgets($this->connection, 128);
			switch($this->getCode()) {
				case 500:
					throw new CommandException($cmd);				
				break;	
			}
		}
	}

	public function selectGroup($group) {
		$this->group = $group;
		if(substr($this->response,0,3) == "200") {

                        THIS IS THE LINE THAT THROWS THE ERROR
			$this->command("NoSuchCommand\n");


			$this->response = fgets($this->connection, 1024);
		}
		$info = split(" ", $this->response);

		$this->first = $info[2];
		$this->last = $info[3];
	}

now when the error is thrown and i do $e->getLine(); it shows the line
of the file where the throw statement is.  Is there a way to make it
show the actual line number of the line that is the error? the
$this->command("NoSuchCommand\n"); line.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Is PHP a good choice for automating network monitoring?
Message-ID: <75b5e56a040913210423c389c6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Not a Gmail-related post: as you can see, I already have an account.  ;)

Instead, I'm wondering if it's possible for PHP to monitor my
computer's IP address, or more accurately, my local network's WAN IP
address, so that it can alert me when the address changes via a DHCP
offer(). Here's the situation:

I have a computer at my parent's house constantly running and
connected to the Internet via a Road Runner account. I'd like to
connect to it remotely sometimes. The problem is, as you know, Road
Runner uses DHCP to designate their subscriber modem's IP addresses,
and this means it changes all the time. I'm savvy enough to configure
an SSH server on the machine locally and configure the router over
there to let requests from the Internet through, but I obviously can't
figure out where that computer is unless I call my parents and direct
her to whatismyip.com.

So the question is, does PHP have any capability to discover and
monitor a network's WAN IP address?

I'd imagine that the solution would be a PHP-CLI script invoked with
cron or a similar utility which would then email me the current
address. (I suppose Windows has the Task Scheduler for this, and I
guess this would also require setting up some kind of mail server, or
else use something like http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/ suggested by
Dan, earlier. (I'm also sorry for not promptly thanking you for that
suggestion, Dan. I really appreciated the pointer!)). But most
importantly for right now, I'm not sure this is the best way to go
about it in the first place.

Can anyone offer some good points why I shouldn't attempt this
project? I'd be grateful if you save me some time.  :)  Thanks in
advance.

Meitar,

Is there any reason that you're not considering a free dynamic DNS 
provider such as noip.com or dyndns.com for this task?

You can get a "static" hostname that is always tied to your dynamic IP 
with these services.  In essence, they provide you with a downloadable 
client that regularly pings their servers to check in with your current IP 
address.  For an annual fee, you can tie one of your own registered 
domains to their nameservers as well.

It seems worth checking out before writing a PHP client to do something 
similar.

I need to be able to send a large number of faxes directly from a 
website. Since this would be an automated process, I'd need to be able 
to capture fax status (e.g., Fax Not Delivered) so that the system could 
resend an undelivered fax.

A bit of googling turned up this company URL - 
http://www.interfax.net/en/dev/php.html - which seems to fit the bill. 
However, I'm always leery of companies that do not provide an address or 
phone number on their website. Suggestions anyone?

You could use $e->getTrace() but that may be more information than you

Jeff,

Go to http://www.esker.com/

Two companies I have worked at have used VSI Fax which now it looks like they
have changed the name to Esker VSI Fax. It also looks like they have another
faxing software called Esker Fax.

This is suppose to be able to run on most platforms with the exception of maybe
Mac OS according to my System Admin.

Hope this helps,
David

Jeff,

If you want to roll your own, you could use Hylafax, http://www.hylafax.org
This is an an opensource fax server that has been around for ages.  I have
used it for fax braodcasting (thousands of faxes, 2 modems, not web-based
over 24 hours) and as the basis for 3 in-bound web based fax servers
(automatic creation of pdfs, printing of faxes and a 3 week web page
archive).

I think Hylafax works well and is very flexible.  The issue in considering
rolling your own server is your fax quantity (pages and destinations) and
timeliness, i.e., how many faxes need to be sent out when so you can
determine the number of modems and phone lines you will need?

Mike

I?m not positive that this idea will work in a CLI-only environment, but
I?ve had very good luck with a service from dyndns.org. To get around the
rolling DHCP ip issue, this service let?s you use a DNS entry as a sort of
proxy. On the client (Mac & Windows for sure), a small daemon or service
periodically sends out the ip address (I think there?s a reverse ping or
something) to dyndns.org. They handle the DNS->IP mapping on their end. I?ve
had it set up and running for a couple of years on various computers and it
works nicely.

See links at bottom for areas marked with (*) etc..

You could pretty easy write something like this to connect to a php
webpage that just logs the ip if that is what you are looking for(?)..

If you need to configure a router automatically, look at the program
called "expect"(*).. It ships with a handy utility called
"autoexpect"(**) that you can run to capture a session, though the file
usually needs a little bit of editing.

If you have good trust relationships (and hosts.deny/host.allow) set up.
You can look at doing no-username/pass ssh. You can do that by creating
a id_dsa.pub (poke around in ssh-keygen) and then place them in a file
on the host your want to connect to called ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 (the
key starts with ssh-dss and the user is the same as you will connect
with) authorized_keys will also need the contents of your identity.pub.
This just make shell scripts act like they are working on your local
machine it also makes doing sweeping changes across a trust-network a
breeze. (*ssh*)

You are absolutely right! I went to the "Contact Us" page, only saw a

anyone put their address and phone number on

Wow, actually no, there isn't. I just hadn't even considered that as a

Yes, Mr. Krook suggested the same thing. Thank you, too for the
suggestion.  :)  I'm going to look into these services.

At the risk of being slightly off-topic, is there any reason why I
would choose one (No-IP.com, for instance) over another (say DynDNS?).
Both of these companies are doing the same exact thing, right? I'm
assuming the niceness of their techs and their level of helpful
customer support will be the main differences between these services.
Any good existing reviews of these services on the Web would also be
helpful (though I plan to google that anyway).

Ah, that's another idea. But for that, I would need to have a server
on the Internet to begin with.

Thanks for these resources. I don't expect (no pun intended) that I'll
need to do anything like this for my rather simplistic purposes (all I
want to do is get access to the remote machine despite it's IP address
changing all the time) but they are nevertheless getting bookmarked.

Best regards,

Nah, don't think you're whacky - in fact, front-end is what got me
into coding - I've always been looking for ways to improve the client
side, and I agree with you that it is happening (as more browsers
become complaint, etc)...Flash too has always offered some interesting
options, though I've run into some nastiness when using it, I'll have
to check out this Flickr, of which you speak.

In the end, IMHO, if the user experience is good, most people (besides
our kind) simply don't care if the backend works properly (ie, if you
handle your errors well, it don't matter much if the app works right -
keep the flame low).

And of course, the user must feel secure.  ;)

Looking over the dyndns list of IP updating clients:

http://www.dyndns.org/services/dyndns/clients.html

I noticed that one of them is written in PHP :)

                         Intruder/Crime Forensics


   This Wednesday, September 15 we will have our version of docu-drama,
   "A walk through some high tech crimes." Steven Branigan, a computing,
   networking systems' forensic specialist will enthrall us with a few of
   the cases he and a forensic team worked on as part of the New York
   Electronic Crimes Task Force (NYECTF). Steven will share the lessons
   he learned and the insights he has gleaned, and will pass on, to this
   meeting's attendees. Quote Bob Weaver, United States Secret Service .

     Task forces, in general, are not a new concept to law enforcement,
     and have been with us for some time. What makes the NYECTF so
     unique is the diversity of our membership and the personal, trusted
     relationships that develop between our members. Today, the task
     force consists of over 250 individual members representing federal,
     state and local law enforcement, the private sector, and academia.
     Our members include the largest financial services,
     telecommunications, and technology companies in the country. It
     also includes computer science specialists from 18 different
     universities. Among these partners, most of whom are strong
     competitors in the consumer marketplace, there is an unprecedented
     sharing of expertise, information and proven solutions, all of
     which have been employed in our common mission to prevent the
     disabling or compromise of critical systems and infrastructure.

   Gives an insight to the role of the NYECTF, and our speaker's
   background. Steven is also an author, his I.T. forensic book is
   entitled, "High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar Stories from the
   Digital Front," via Addison Wesley Press. One of our esteemed book
   sponsors.

  Book Description:

   Stories about hacking, stolen credit card numbers, computer viruses,
   and identity theft are all around us, but what do they really mean to
   us? The goal of this book, quite simply, is to help educate people on
   the issues with high-tech crimes. "High-Tech Crimes Revealed: Cyberwar
   Stories from the Digital Front" demystifies the risks and realities of
   high-tech crimes. Demystifying these crimes and raising the awareness
   of users of technology will make people smarter and safer, and that
   will make all of us safer in the long run. Steven Branigan shares the
   inside details on real cases he worked on in his various roles in
   law-enforcement, information technology, and security. The result is a
   comprehensive, accessible look at how digital crimes are discovered,
   what techniques the criminals use and why, and (in some cases) how
   they can be brought to justice. Inside, you'll find extensive
   information on Actual hacker investigations, including the harm caused
   and how the criminals were tracked and caught, plus the ins and outs
   of identity theft, a rapidly growing crime with potential for serious
   damage. Use of criminology and hacker psychology to detect and deter
   attacks. The risks associated with various technologies Do's and
   Don'ts for high-tech criminal investigations. This easily
   understandable book will take you beyond hearing about high-tech
   crimes to actually understanding how and why they happen--and what can
   be done to protect yourself.

Hi All,

Summary:
When I try to access a PHP page the IP address it works fine, but when I 
use the hostname it hangs.

Details:
(Lets asume www.mydomain.com = IP 1.2.3.4)
These URLs work fine:
http://www.mydomain.com/test.html
http://www.mydomain.com/test.gif
http://1.2.3.4/test.html
http://1.2.3.4/test.gif
http://1.2.3.4/test.php

This URL hangs:
http://www.mydomain.com/test.php (The browser says opening page and 
after a couple of minutes I get an error: The page cannot be displayed)

Here are some more observations:
I do not have this problem when I connect to any other server.
This problem exists both when I use IE 6.0 or Firefox 1.0PR
The problem does not exist if I directly telnet to www.mydomain.com and 
do a GET /test.php (though I really should try it with full HTTP 1.1 
headers).
I tried from another computer at home and the problem does not exist.
Several other people have connected to the server from their computers 
and do not have this problem.

It seems to be a combination of that specific server with my specific 
computer.

I googled this issue and could not find anyone with the same problem.

Any suggestions ????

I am getting a segfault in one of my php scripts. I would post code, but I
am having a hard time figuring out any logical reason of what code is
causing it. Does anyone have any idea what causes a segfault in php, or any
strategies to debug it. I am running PHP 4.3.4 and Apache/1.3.28 (Unix)  on
my server.

Is the host using named virtual servers?  Was the site just moved?

HTTP 1.0 didn't pass the hostname in the headers.

are you saying that, out of the handful of 'scripts', you don't know 
which script is failing?

I knew which script it was happening in, but it just seemed to be occurring
at random iterations of the same loop. I have finally tracked down the
problem. My sysadmin had updated the Pear DB class to the newest version.
The quote() method (now deprecated) was causing the segfault. I changed it
to quoteSmart() and it works fine now. No wonder I couldn't find it, it
wasn't my code :)

Run Apache with the -X option through GDB and get a backtrace:

# gdb /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd -X

then hit the segv page with your web browser, GDB should show that a seg
fault was trapped. From there type 'bt' and display the backtrace:

gdb> bt

paste the *entire* backtrace and i can tell you where it's crashing and
likely provide a patch to fix it :)

Have you tried using telnet to connect to the remote socket manually?

I need some help.
I installed php5.01, mysql 5.0.1, apache 1.3.31, myodbc 3.51.9 on a hp
laptop(sp4) and a dell desktop(sp3) running  W2K OS on both.

My laptop shows Mysql package when I access the phpinfo() via the apache
server, but my desktop
will show the Mysql package.  Alsosome of the diferences in the PHP CORE
Configurations
when I look at my phpinfo.php file(it only contains "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" )
The output is different
I am using the same php.ini file(I did a dif with VIM)  The my.ini from
mysql are the same except for
the bin-address, because the machines have different IP address.

Is this normal behavior?  Why the difference?
When I try to access mysql via phpmyadmin I get the error "cannot load
mysql"

Thanks

Nestor :-)

Without specifying a port number, telnet will use port 23 - Im assuming 
this is not what you want to do.
NNTP runs on port 119 so you need to tell telnet to use that port.

In Linux you would do something like: "telnet news.php.net 119"

	for students
Message-ID: <330532b6040916182818277050@mail.gmail.com>

Here is an actual PHP-related email :D

A friend of mine will be giving an impromptu lecture to a bunch of
photographers this weekend on website management and online
publishing.  The two questions he would like opinions from the
well-versed are:

1) What are the top 5 WAMP installation packages, and which are the
easiest to maintain for non-techies?

2) What hosting providers out there (in the $9.95 range) that provide
good service, easy management, and decent reporting?

As a Fedora/Gentoo/Dynix guy I guess I'm not really qualified to
answer.  I myself would like to know the easiest/safest route to
migrate to php5 on my laptop, as I installed MySQL, Apache and PHP
separately...

XAMPP -- I've been using it for a couple years now, but more 
importantly, my students (intro-level classes) have no problems with it.

here's a pretty good value:

http://www.edmunds-enterprises.com/linux/hosting_plans.php

I've used their tech support once to request SSH shell setup -- very 
responsive.  They keep their software current and even run apache 1.3 
instead of 2.0 -- note the # of mysql databases that come with the 
packages (I have the $4.95/mo plan).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Little heads up with HTMLQuickform
Message-ID: <6ec19ec7040917125552c80ac0@mail.gmail.com>

I've been playing around with HTML Quickform on my site and noticed a
little quirk that may save others some time.

By default (at least with the versions I have been playing with) HTML
Quickform does some stuff to the user entered data before sending it
to you.

Say you create a simple registration form and use this code for the password:
$form->addElement('password', 'txtPass', 'Password');
$form->addRule('txtPass','enter your password.', 'required','' , 'client');
$form->addRule('txtPass','Your password must be at least three
charecters.', 'minlength',3, 'client');

Pretty basic. Display it as you normally would, user enters a password
as follows (no quotes) "a3d<gkas>s2", what your code actually gets is
(again no quotes) "a3ds2", the "<gkas>" has been striped, no error
returned to the user.

My first thought was that this was horrible, since the poor user now
has no idea what their password is, and won't be able to login.
However, this isn't the case. Provided you use HTML_Quickform for all
your login pages, it will perform exactly the same striping and
everything will work.

I still don't think this is an optimal situation however for a couple
of reasons:
1. If HTML_Quickform ever changes the way that this striping works,
users won't be able to log in.
2. If you have any pages that don't use HTML_Quickform, the user can't
log in on them
3. If you have tied togethor any systems (say a login on your page
automatically creates a forum account, or a shell account, or a ...),
those systems probably don't use the same striping rules.
4. Having users not know what their password is just gives me the willies.
5. These restrictions, if known by an attacker, makes passwords easier
to crack as many possible passwords can be skipped, or multiple unique
passwords would match the one on file.

This stripping applies to most (if not all) of the default form types
(text, password, etc), so if their username happens to be "I<Us>they"
it will end up as "Ithey" without prompting an error.

I think the fact that HTML_Quickform takes care of some of the
filtering is awesome, especially for smaller projects, but as
programmers we should be aware of the assumptions the filtering is
making.

At the risk of sounding flakey, because this happened to me and I
posted a bug to PHP only to be rebuffed in the nicest possible way,
are you sure the <stuff in angle brackets> isn't being "stripped out"

View source and see if it's really gone, or just being rendered as html tags...

Which of coursse means that my regex expression to check for brackets
in the string isn't working... Which is why i started this whole thing

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Looking for info on Obfuscating download links
Message-ID: <6ec19ec7040917140878aad500@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for some information on obfuscating download links.

Most places you go to these days and download something end up sending
you to www.domain.com/downloads/a792js92has7s92j29/file.exe, the long
complicated bit changing every time.

I could of course roll my own, but was wondering if anyone had any
experiance with this sort of thing, and had recomendations on the
tools they used.


thanks all

Message-ID: <1448FB4565D489478642386D50D3FB77046C9D79@VVNTMAIL.vvny.villagevoice.com>

Hello all,
Is there any way one can pass parameters to the function registered by
'register_shutdown_function()'?

See, I was thinking that I need a way to 'lock' a resource for the duration
af a script. I'd insert a record into a locking table with a unique userId,
then the unlock function would be registered via
register_shutdown_function(), THOUGH it would need the userID....

I *could* use a global I guess, but that seems messy.

Any thoughts?

No, because you never know when it's going to be called.

You may get in trouble here because if there's a fatal error, I don't
believe PHP will actually call any shutdown functions, but will just
abort ASAP.

Right, I'll write code that will never, never, never, never error.

Hmmm....

This is interesting:

<?php
require_once($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/session_handlers.php');
$shutdown_params = array();

$_SESSION['name'] = "bob dobbs";
$_SESSION['time'] = date('r');

$shutdown_params['sess'] = $_SESSION;

function bye(){
	global $shutdown_params;
	if(connection_aborted()){
		mail('spam at example.com','script
aborted',print_r($shutdown_params,TRUE));
	}
}
register_shutdown_function('bye');

for($i=0; $i< 1e2; $i++){
	echo "$i<br>\n";
	flush();
	$_SESSION['cointoss'] = ($i%2 ? 'heads':'tails');
	sleep(1);
}
echo 'Fin!';
?>


I will get 'heads' or 'tails' for my 'cointoss', most of the time. Just to
try it out, I aborted the script right after the it echo'd '1' to the
browser -- the email I got was this:

Array
(
    [sess] => Array
        (
            [name] => bob dobbs
            [time] => Fri, 17 Sep 2004 17:31:21 -0400
        )
)

!!!

No cointoss! Though you'd expect that it would be written to the SESSION
when the cointoss statement was reached...looks like writes to the SESSION
might be lazy, and maybe thrown away sometimes?

The way I have done it in the past included mod_rewrite looking for
/downloads/ and redirecting that to download.php with the following
directory as a token, and the final filename as the target file for
download.

You can generate the tokens at random, and store them in the session
for that particular user.  If they match, then they get the file.

It isn't perfect (or that detailed) but works for the majority of sites, no?

And, just for reference, NYPHP always has stuff that can be done.
Anyone is welcome to swing by a meeting and get involved with an
existing project, or propose a new one.  There's always code to be

This might be stating the obvious, but these functions should do it:

You could also:

Something like:

SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS LIKE '%';

Ironically, the vast majority of the off-topic and chatter emails were

We've talked about spawning another list, and we can.  From prior
discussions, however, people felt that it would split the activity of
the Talk list.

A word about Gmail...

Gmail invites, etc. should not continue on this list.  Google was
extremely clever in their marketing of Gmail, and now there are so many
invitations available, most lists I'm on are spammed with Gmail talk.

While the technical merit of Gmail is another topic (they have a sexy
front-end, which is exactly the type of discussion for NYPHP-Front-End
(http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/front-end) we should try to
keep posts more on topic.  In general, OT posts are fine, but if they
become quite common, it's probably time for another list.

This will be great John.  As the volume of NYPHP-Talk increases, it's
ever more important to keep posts concise, on-topic, and pertinent.  Too
much chatter can obviously hurt this list.

Yes and no.  I'm not aware of an extension that ties directly into the
kernel system calls, but depending on your system, it'd be trivial to
parse /proc info, ifconfig output, etc.  Possibly helpful of course
would be these functions:

http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/front-end

There are likely PEAR classes and other open source projects that do
much of this parsing, and there are probably even extensions that take
it to the C level (the right way to do it).  I had worked on a C
extension to sculpt raw packets, but it's since stalled any development.

I think this approache would work, and some other tools - cacti comes to

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ./configure, PHP, SuSE and the AMD64
Message-ID: <41EE526EC2D3C74286415780D3BA9F87044C7562@ehost011-1.exch011.intermedia.net>


Hey everyone,

I'm doing a PHP compile for New York PHP's AMD64 Project.  The goal is
to enable all the hottest and modern extensions, and then let people
hack with their favorite extensions to find problems and bugs under a
64bit architecture.  We're running SuSE Enterprise 9.1 on a dual AMD64
Opteron box, with 4GB of RAM.

I notice a number of strange issues while running ./configure.  Most of
which I've been able to work through, and which I've documented to be
revisited later (the complete process of setting the box up is
documented and will be on nyphp.org when completed).

However, there is one issue I'm pretty unclear on - and, unfortunately
it might relate to some of the other issues, which makes matters more
confusion.

I can post the entire ./configure if requested, but this is pertinent at
this point:

....<snip>
--with-dom=/usr/lib64 --with-zlib-dir=/usr/lib64 \
--with-dom-xslt=/usr/lib64 --with-dom-exslt=/usr/lib64 \
--enable-exif --enable-ftp \
--with-gd=/usr/lib64 --with-jpeg-dir=/usr/lib64 \
--with-png-dir=/usr/lib64 --with-zlib-dir=/usr/lib64 \
--with-freetype-dir=/usr/lib64 \
....</snip>

The ./configure stops with this error message:

checking whether to enable truetype string function in GD... no
checking whether to enable JIS-mapped Japanese font support in GD... no
checking for jpeg_read_header in -ljpeg... no
configure: error: Problem with libjpeg.(a|so). Please check config.log
for more information.


And config.log contains this relevant snippet at the end:

configure:29794: checking whether to enable truetype string function in
GD
configure:29819: checking whether to enable JIS-mapped Japanese font
support in GD
configure:31813: checking for jpeg_read_header in -ljpeg
configure:31832: gcc -o conftest -g -O2   -Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib64
-L/usr/lib64 -Wl,-rpath,/usr/ssl/lib -L/usr/ssl/lib conftest.c -ljpeg

-lcrypto -ldl -lcurl -lz -lssl -lcrypto -ldl -lxml2 -lz -lm 1>&5
/usr/lib64/gcc-lib/x86_64-suse-linux/3.3.3/../../../../x86_64-suse-linux
/bin/ld: cannot find -lxml
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
configure: failed program was:
#line 31821 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char jpeg_read_header();

int main() {
jpeg_read_header()
; return 0; }


At first glance, it appears the problem is in libjpeg - but it's not.
Notice "cannot find -lxml"

I have only libxml2 installed:

amd:~/INSTALLED/php-4.3.8 # ldconfig -p | grep -i libxml
        libxml2.so.2 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/libxml2.so.2
        libxml2.so.2 (libc6) => /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2
        libxml2.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib64/libxml2.so
amd:~/INSTALLED/php-4.3.8 #

So why is it looking for -lxml?  There is also the link flag of -lxml2,
which is correct.  Am I missing something here, or do I really need to
install libxml in addition to libxml2 (which totally doesn't seem
right)?

So that's the main question right now.

There are some other issues that I've mostly worked around, but figure
I'll drop by this list for additional comments and thoughts.

-- In general, I've found that PHP's ./configure tends to assume things
are in /usr/lib.  However, on this and other 64bit x86 platforms, what
we want is typically in /usr/lib64.  A prime example of this is libjpeg.
After the RPM's install, ./configure couldn't find libjpeg, even though
ldconfig knew where it was - it was in /usr/lib64.  The error:

configure: error: libjpeg.(a|so) not found.

The solution: symlink libjpeg.so from /usr/lib64 into /usr/lib - but is
this right?  I've tried numerous flags to configure, but nothing worked.
When examining config.log in this case, I see "gcc -o conftest
-L/usr/lib64...."  which looks to be on the right track, yet ./configure
is still breaking.

-- On a similar note is the specifying of specific directories.  In the
./configure snippet above, you'll notice I typically use /usr/lib64 with
any --with directive.  I know this might be wrong, but using /usr
doesn't help either (for instance, --with-jpeg-dir=/usr doesn't work).

In fact, there appear to be some inconstancies, and certainly some
questions:

--with-openssl  (must not have any directory after it, which isn't
inline with what ./configure --help says).

--with-zlib=/usr  (this works - but what if I want to force the 64bit
library version, in /usr/lib64?)

--with-bz2=/usr/lib64  (and this also works - which you would think it
shouldn't, compared to the zlib above?)

And lastly, take these:

--with-curl=/usr/lib64
--with-zlib-dir=/usr/lib64

Both seem to work (so far).  So what is the difference between a
directive having the -dir suffix and not?

For most compiles, I just set everything to /usr/local and /usr and it
works.  Occasionally, there are problems, but they are usually easily
resolved with ldconfig runs, etc.  However, in this case, having lib64
seems to have added another level of complexities and possible
permutations of what doing The Right Thing really is.  Are these
potentially bugs and mis-documentations, or simply me missing the
obvious?

Any thoughts appreciated, thanks all,

I've configured rules that deal with most MIME 
configurations (for attachments, inline elements, etc.), 
but, ironically, the digest format that this list arrives in 
escapes me. There's a digest that includes the entire raw 
email. Then each message is presented as an rfc822 message 
and then, with another imap decimal part, the text of the 
email is included again. I'm assuming this is following some 
standard that I can mesh with the object returned by 
imap_fetchbody. I'm especially interested in the imap 
decimal part of the standard. How are they assigned?

Actually, I'm mainly interested in talking with someone 
offlist about php imap clients, I guess.

Have you tested the script with other mailman lists?  The NYPHP-Talk
list should be no different.  I do believe, however, that there is a
digest MIME type these days.

Sorry, can't help too much here.  Although a PHP mail client would be
interesting - PHP-GTK?

I prefer a good combination of both.  If you go "the php way", then you 
put more burden on the server than you probably would need to, whereas 
if you do more in Javascript in "pure form" then you take away a lot of 
the server burden to put onto the client, however, be prepared for the 
various "browser war"-related issues while doing so.

What I usually do is that I will write a PHP class like a 
JavascriptGenerator class that will dynamically build the necessary 
Javascript functions and scripts to be plugged into the resulting HTML 
to allow for the server to dynamically build what is necessary, all the 
while allowing the client to "share the load" so to speak.

Message-ID: <1448FB4565D489478642386D50D3FB77046C9D88@VVNTMAIL.vvny.villagevoice.com>

Folks,

I know this is kinda off-topic; I googled around but didn't know the
appropriate place to post this. Suggesstions are welcome.

I am using PHP's system() call (am I now on-topic?) to capture the exit code
of scp. I have a machine called 'downhost' that is currently offline; I want
to test the failure of scp.

host 1:
FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE-p20
OpenSSH_3.5p1 FreeBSD-20030924


command 1: copy a file from host1 (local) to downhost:
-----------------------------------------------
scp -i /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key /home/user/file.xml user at downhost:file.xml
; echo $?
-----------------------------------------------
echoing the exit code properly gives me a '1', because the target host
cannot be reached.



command 2: copy a file from  host1 (local) to another location on  host1
(local):
-----------------------------------------------
scp -i /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key /home/user/file.xml /home/user/file2.xml;
echo $?
-----------------------------------------------
echoing the exit code properly gives me a zero; it was successfully copied.



command 3: copy from webdmz to  host1 (local):
-----------------------------------------------
scp -i /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key user at downhost:file.xml /home/user/file.xml
; echo $?
-----------------------------------------------
echos zero!! This is strange since downhost cannot be found!!


Huh! I was hoping command 3 would exit with non-zero... Am i thinking about
this wrong?


TIA,
Wellington

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Exporting csv 
Message-ID: <877jqncpgq.wl%darian@slackworks.com>

Hello List, 

I'm trying to use the header() php function to output a csv from the results
of a mysql query. There was a post on here not long ago about forcing downloads
of a file on the filesystem. Is it possible to force a download of a string? 

Here's my code:

<?
include ('includes/configure.php');
include ('includes/classes/db_utils.php');

function outOfStock(){

$query = "select sku_code, products_quantity, quantity_threshold, products_name, attribute_name from products p join products_description pd on p.products_i
d=pd.products_id where products_status='1' and products_quantity <= quantity_threshold order by products_name";

$rows = DB_UTILS::queryMultiRow($query);
foreach($rows as $row){
    $output .= implode(",",$row);
    $output .= "\n";
}
 return $output;
}


$date = gmdate("m-d-Y",time());
$file = outOfStock();
$filesize = strlen($file);
$filename = "out-of-stock-" . $date;

header("Pragma: public");
header("Expires: 0");
header("Cache-Control: private");
header("Content-Type: text/csv");
header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$filename");
header("Accept-Ranges: bytes");
header("Content-Length: $download_size"); 

echo $file;
exit();

?>

It would be possible to write a temp file with the data, but it seems like there 
has to be away to do this.

Thanks in advance,

Yes.  I have it within my application to do just that by manipulating 
the headers as so:

    /**
     * Generate the HTTP headers necessary for this file type
     *
     * @access public
     * @param mixed $filename
     */
    function &generateHTTPHeaders($filename) {                    // 
STATIC VOID METHOD

        if (!preg_match('/.+\.[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+$/i', $filename))
         die("Filename: \"$filename\" must have an extension");
        $ext = substr($filename, strrpos($filename, '.') + 1, 
strlen($filename));

        switch (strtolower(trim($ext))) {
             case 'pdf':
          $ctype = 'application/pdf';
              break;
         case 'exe':
          $ctype = 'application/octet-stream';
          break;
         case 'zip':
          $ctype = 'appliation/zip';
          break;
         case 'doc':
          $ctype = 'application/msword';
          break;
         case 'xls':
          $ctype = 'application/vnd.ms-excel';
          break;
         case 'csv':
          $ctype = 'application/vnd.ms-excel';
          break;
          case 'ppt':
          $ctype = 'application/vnd.ms-powerpoint';
          break;
         case 'gif':
          $ctype = 'image/gif';
          break;
         case 'png':
          $ctype = 'image/png';
          break;
         case 'jpg':
          $ctype = 'image/jpg';

         default:
          $ctype = 'application/force-download';
          break;
        }

        header('Pragma: public');
        header('Expires: 0');
        header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0');
        header("Content-Type: $ctype");
        $user_agent = strtolower($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
        if ((is_integer(strpos($user_agent, 'msie'))) && 
(is_integer(strpos($user_agent, 'win')))) {
            header('Content-Disposition: filename=' . 
basename($filename) . ';');
        } else {
            header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename=' . 
basename($filename) . ';');
        }
        header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary');
        header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($filename));
        if (function_exists('file_get_contents')) {
         echo file_get_contents($filename);
        } else {
         readfile($filename);
        }
    }

This is actually a class method within a class I wrote that generates 
reports.

I'm sorry for the reply to myself folks, but does anyone have any hints
on the below?  It's a daunting post, I know, but also a daunting problem
:)  Thoughts on any of the points mentioned would be helpful.

Thanks for the speedy responses. I checked my code and I was sending the incorrect 
Content-Length value. I was sending a null value so nothing would get sent. I fixed
it by using:

Content-Length: strlen($filename) 

Thanks again,

I would mind taking the free hosting account either.  It would be great for
my free lancing start up I have with several of my friends.  I have been
looking around for a good hosting for PHP and MySQL

sorry the account is gone, however i can recommend a really good stable host.

www.hostproservices.com they are cheap and i have used them for about
4 years with very minimal problems maybe an hour of downtime or
something.

Hi:

Pardon the slightly off topic post (man, there have been way to many 
of these, I'm sorry)...  Someone I know asked me if I know someone who 
fits the following bill who's willing to be an employee for a major 
corporation for good compensation.

   This role requires 5-7 years of hands-on experience/fluency with 
   Cold Fusion and PL/SQL programming.

If you want more info, write me OFF-LIST.

Thanks,

I think you're on track.  Since the man page says:

scp exits with 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.

This must be a bug.  Try an absolute path for the source file, but I
doubt that makes a difference.

You may be better off with something like this:

function &singleton($class) {
     static $instances;

     if (!is_array($instances)) {
         $instances = array();
     }

     if (!isset($instances[$class])) {
         $instances[$class] =& new $class;
     }

     return $instances[$class];
}

This function will correctly manage multiple singleton objects for 
multiple classes, thus:

$mysingle =& singleton('myclass');

$myother =& singleton('anotherclass');

Will both be valid singleton instances of their respective class.  With 
the function in your example the second call to singleton would change 
the object referenced by $mysingle.

I also changed the way the function returns the reference slightly to 
reflect the preferred syntax in php4.

Dan,

thanks for pointing this out, however one question,  I have been told
that in PHP 4 static variables in functions are not stored from page
to page request, if this is true you will need to use a session anyhow
so why would singletons be of use in php 4?

the article you saw is one that was not updated yet, i sent an email
to the site admin with corrections for the article that also showed a
way to use a session to store the object.

i will add your code to the code example and note your name ;)

Joseph,

Singleton classes can be very handy for things like database access and 
error handling, where it is convenient to be able to access the same 
object from many different areas of the code.  You could use a global 
variable for the same job, but that is really a matter of taste.

If you want your singleton objects to propagate across the session, then 
you can use something like:

function &session_singleton($class) {
     if (!isset($_SESSION['_singleton'])) {
         $_SESSION['_singleton'] = array();
     }

     if (!isset($_SESSION['_singleton'][$class])) {
         $_SESSION['_singleton'][$class] =& new $class;
     }

     return $_SESSION['_singleton'][$class];
}

Hi Folks,

This is really weird, so I'm asking greater minds than mine:

Any ideas what could make a required file not return its stated return
value?  This is driving me nuts, but in one specific instance, code
something like this:  <? $a = require ('requiredfile.php'); ?>  is giving me
NULL for $a.

If I change that require statement to be require_once, I get the return
value with no problem.  And of course in any other situation everything
works fine -- that is, if I make a sample script to test just these few
lines of code in the same environment, I get the result you'd expect.  And
on top of that (extra clue!), if I run this same set of code on my local dev
machine (Windows, php 4.3.7) it works fine, just not on my production
(linux, php 4.1.2) machine.

For context, this code is contained inside of a custom class that's
basically adding features to the Smarty engine, and the actual code is:

$arReturn = require_once ($this->modulesDir."/".$this->module.".php");
or
$arReturn = require ($this->modulesDir."/".$this->module.".php");

And a typical required file contains:
return array ('result',"Completed: $result");

What the heck am I missing here?

- Allen

Hans,
You called it -- 

It looks like the *broken* version I was using was:
OpenSSH_3.5p1 FreeBSD-20030924

It *works* with this version:
OpenSSH_3.9p1, OpenSSL 0.9.7a-p1 Feb 19 2003


Thanks!

Hey:

I had some whitty subject line in mind but I forgot what it was.  Oh 
well...

The first item in #267 talks about a problem in PHP itself.  It's very 
vague and I don't recall seeing any discussion about this on the 
internals mailing list.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Code Highlighting a Mixed Content (HTML/PHP) File
Message-ID: <20040922191225.9033.qmail@hosting33.com>

...</lurk>

Did quite a bit of searching and found lots of scripts on sites all around the world to syntax highlight PHP code. What I didn't seem to find was how to do it elegantly with a file of mixed content types without preg_matching, preg_replacing, etc. I thought I could do it with two built in PHP functions but the following fails and doesn't return anything:

<?php
html_entity_decode(highlight_file("some_directory/$file[name]"));
?>

Leaving out the html_entity_decode() it reads in the file but runs an html_entities() on it which I don't want.

Thanks.

highlight_file() only returns the HTML with the highlighted stuff if you 
pass it a second argument of "true" (Otherwise, it just prints it). Try:

print html_entity_decode(highlight_file("$dir/$file", true));

Wow, I have never seen that $a = require( filename ) construction. But
according to the manual, a return() within an included file will halt
execution of the include and pass back the value.

I have no idea why it doesn't work for you, but perhaps this wasn't a
feature yet in 4.1?

Good point, but I think it's got to be somewhere in my code, because when I
make a simple one-line test script like <? echo require('filename.php'); ?>
I do get the results -- it just doesn't work in this instance in my code.
So it's not the version. I just can't figure out what in my code could
possibly be making this kind of distinction.

This problem is mentioned in the comments to the php documentation 
(Extended CHM Edition).  Unfortunately it isn't in the online docs, so I 
have quoted it below:

Geez, very annyoing indeed!  Good God, how is anybody supposed to figure
that out? [Yeah, I know, read the extended docs, or ask Dan ... :o)  ]

> it may not contain the value you

Yeah, "MAY" -- sometimes maybe yes and sometimes maybe no.  Drat and double
drat!

Anyway, that was the ticket.  Thanks, Dan, for a solution I never would have
guessed.

No problem, in fact I just ran into a situation where I would have 
fallen victim to this bug too, so I'm glad you brought it up!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] static methods in derived classes
Message-ID: <4152D699.5040806@sklar.com>

If you call, in a subclass, a static method defined in the parent class, 
"self" inside the method refers to the parent class. This is causing me 
problems, e.g. here:

class Meal {
     public static function eat() {
         $food = self::prepare();
         self::chew($food);
     }
}

class Lunch extends Meal {
     protected static function prepare() { return 'Sandwich'; }
     protected static function chew($food) { print $food; }
}

Doing:

    Lunch::eat();

Produces:

    Fatal error: Call to undefined method Meal::prepare()


Any thoughts on how to refer to the child methods in the parent class? 
Or why this is stinky OO style and what I should do instead?

Note that with non-static methods, $this works (as expected) just fine. 
The code:

class Snack {
     public function eat() {
         $food = $this->prepare();
         $this->chew($food);
     }

}

class Tea extends Snack {
     protected function prepare() { return 'Cucumber Sandwich'; }
     protected function chew($food) { print $food; }
}

$t = new Tea;
$t->eat();


Prints:

     Cucumber Sandwich

yes i dont believe you can do it like that (although i may be wrong) i
think static methods need to be accessd by parent::eat();

i know that when you have a static method in one class in the same
class you cannot use $this->eat() you must use Self::eat() so try
parent:: and let me know how things go.

parent:: lets you access a parent method from a child class. I am 
interested in accessing a child method from a parent class. There is no 
child:: keyword to do that. This may just be a limitation in how self:: 
works.

i thought i would post this for anyone else who may have this problem,
although not the same case since you are not overloading yet it still
shows it is trying to call Meal::prepare() and not Lunch::prepare()

yea there is no way to have a child:: because several classes can
extend the same class, how would the parent class know which child
class to use?

Pardon my Delphi leanings, that's the bulk of my OO experience... That said:

Does this mean that Dave should be overriding the eat() method in the child,
the body of which is merely calling parent::eat()?

That just postpones the problem -- when Lunch::eat() calls Meal::eat(), 
then Meal::eat() complains it can't find the prepare() method.

I think the bug that Joseph posted is the definitive answer here -- it's 
a design decision/limitation in the way self:: works in the engine.

no that might work for a work around however it is within the way Self:: works.

in the 

class Meal {
    public static function eat() {
        $food = self::prepare();
        self::chew($food);
    }
}

self:: is actualy Meal

so when it tries to fine Meal::prepare, it fatals saying cannot find
the method, in reality the method is not there, however putting the
prepare in the Meal and overloading wouldnt work either now that i
think of it, because Meal::prepare would be called and Lunch::prepare
would never be called so even overloading wouldnt work.

David, 

i know you are poking around trying to figure out why self:: works in
this manor, if you find any work arounds or good reads on this please
pass them to me.

Generally, from my poking around with PHP 5, when a method is declared
static, you cannot reference anything that requires an object
instance. (Unless, of course, you pass that object into the method.)

The assumption is you should be allowed to directly call Meal::eat()
and have it work without instantiating an instance of Meal, and that
condition would fail if you're allowed to reference methods
solely implemented in a child class.

Yeah, I was hoping for an exception since the child methods are static, too.

What Adam makes a lot of sense, and it implies that self:: is poorly named. 

self:: doesn't mean "self", it means "a static instance of this very
same class".

I think you mean for a Meal/Lunch instance to chew() its own food,
which is whacky.

Here's another bug report about the same issue. Since "self" is bound at 
compile time, it can't know about subclasses:

Hi folks,

We've decided to use php at a site I maintain. One of the first tasks
is not too complicated from a programming perspective but we could
prob benefit from features of existing package vs re-inventing the
wheel.

I'm looking for an app that allows clients (aka IT illiterates) to
update a template based site (https post or form submit) with items
they want to sell. The site should be able manage the number of items
available and forward transaction to third party for processing (paypal
acceptable, need processor that charges per transaction not per
month, or nominal per month); the client should get notified when the
transaction is completed and optionally when it is started.

About the most basic shopping cart available, with the exception that
our clients will need to update their virtual domains. I suspect
something like http://www.zen-cart.com/ with a front end that allows
clients to update vdomain "for sale" content.

Does such an animal exist? Will I need to integrate a few packages, or
roll it all in house?  We are open to contracting someone to do this, a

Due to some of what I was trying to work on I have had to make a switch.

Love PHP, but it can't go where I need it to go...
I tried: http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/tut/
and http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/phpgtk/

After much work, I have had to make a switch and wrote about why here:

Think I am going to skip on the talk this month because I am shifting
focus for the time being.

I talked with a few Javaheads of the Northern Virginia Java Users Group 
(NovaJUG) about this issue, and here is their reply regarding 
declarations and static methods:

I think static methods are extremely useful, but they are widely
misunderstood. Many people access them via an instance. This is
misleading and can lead to surprising results. Intellij Idea suggests
that any such uses be changed to reference static methods by their
class name, and I think that's a good idea.

When a method does not rely on any instance context, it's a very good
idea to declare it static because:

1) it can (and should) be called without an instance, thereby saving
resources. (An exception to this is if it is called only within the
class itself, then it would be called within nonstatic methods of the
instance without a class name or a this. In this case, making it
static, even if private, does yield benefit #2).

2) more is communicated to the reader than if the method were
nonstatic; you are promising that nothing in this method relies on
instance context, and the compiler is enforcing your promise. This is
a cue to future readers that this method can easily be refactored,
perhaps moved to a utility class or even a different package.

The class below illustrates the problem. One would think that the
general rules of inheritance apply, and that the object's actual type
would determine which foo() is called. However, that is not the case;
it is the class of the declared reference that determines which method
is called.

Because the method is bound to the class itself, and not objects of
that class, it is wise to specify the class name (as in Meal::eat());
to do otherwise is to invite confusion.



public class StaticOverrideMethodTest {

static class Base {
static void foo() { System.out.println("I am a Base."); }
}

static class Derived extends Base {
static void foo() { System.out.println("I am a Derived."); }
}

public static void main(String [] args) {
Base b = new Derived();
b.foo();

Derived d = new Derived();
d.foo();
}
}

Subject: [nycphp-talk] HTML_QuickForm_Controller question
Message-ID: <4152FBC6.3020602@ceruleansky.com>

Hello all,

I have been quiet for the last month (or two) because I have busy with 
various things.

I have a question now, and I hope someone on the list will be able to help.

I have been using (the PEAR library) QuickForm ( 
http://pear.php.net/package-search.php?pkg_name=quickform&bool=AND&submit=Search 
)  in conjunction with the HTML_QuickForm_Controller 
(http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.html.html-quickform-controller.php 
) add-on package.

I am using the QuickForm Controller package to build a multi-page form, 
otherwise known as a "wizard". There will be 3 - 5 pages. If all the 
info on the first page validates, the user is taken to the second page. 
If not, then the errors are highlighted. Since the whole form has a lot 
(100+) fields, the multi-page format is necessary.

Within this multi-page format, I wanted to do something like the following:

1) On the first page, the user is asked "How many books do you have?"
2) If the user chose 5 books on the first page, then 5 sets of fields 
will be shown on the second page, each with fields such as title, 
author, isbn, etc.
3) For this example, we will assume that the person cannot have more 
than 10 books

The QuickForm Controller package uses session variables to hold data 
from each page of the wizard. The thing is, I cannot how to access a 
piece of information (session variable) from another page. I.e.,on page 
2, I want to be able to say "if 2 books were specified on page 1, then 
use a loop to add  xyz form fields for each book."

If I were using session variables directly myself, I would know how to 
do it immediately. But while the QuickForm and the QuickForm add-on 
package are both very powerful, they are also very complex.

The reason I am using them is that creating a complex multi-page form 
(with so many form fields and umpteen validation rules) would quickly 
turn into spaghetti code without such libraries.

So, anyone have experience with this or a useful link?

Thanks in advance!

- Jay
PS: David Sklar's PHP Tools book has information on the main QuickForm 
library, but not on the Controller add-on. It seems that online 
information for the controller is quite scant.

Check out the exportValue() and exportValues() functions that are 
(barely) documented here:

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.html.html-quickform-controller.php

They let you get one or more values belonging to a particular page (or 
all pages in your wizard).

That sounds right to me. Even if the child class is static, PHP does
not assume ahead of time that such a class exists.

Turncoat!

I have been straddling this fence since the PHP/FI days, and can
definitely relate.  Maybe you could then turn your efforts to the
NYPHP Python list, since it is currently collecting binary
dustbunnies?

Hi David,

thanks for your quick response. I  looked at that page myself before 
posting but somehow missed it.

On closer inspection, it seems that exportValue (as you mentioned) 
should work ...

Thanks a lot!

Best Regards,

- Jay

Message-ID: <415312AF.4000109@ceruleansky.com>

Hi David and others,

I tried David's advice (exportValue() method), and it worked after some 
experimentation. I thought I would post what I found out here to save 
others some time.

Suppose you you define a test element in the first page:

class Page_One extends HTML_QuickForm_Page
{

    function buildForm()
    {
      $testelement1 =& HTML_QuickForm::createElement('text', 
'testelement1', 'Test Element 1:');
      $this->addElement($testelement1);

     /*
      OR:
     $this->addElement('text', 'testelement1', 'Test Element 1:');
     */
    }
}

Then you define the second page:

class Page_Two extends HTML_QuickForm_Page
{

    function buildForm()
    {
     $expval1 = $this->controller->exportValue('page1', 'testelement1');
    $this->addElement('header', 'test_header1', "Test value from 
previous screen: $expval1 ");
    }
}

The point to note above is the "$this->controller->exportValue()" syntax.
I am guessing that due to the subclassing and stuff you have to do the 
weird looking  double -> thing.

Another point to note is that I don't think that in the code block for 
page two you could do something like:

$testelement1 =& $this->getElement('testelement1');
$expval1 = $testelement1->getValue();

Further examples of this technique can be found  on  line 62 of 
"upload.php" which is in the examples folder of the QuickForm Controller 
package.

An excerpt:
"
if ($this->controller->exportValue('page1', 'layout') == 'A')
      {
            $this->addGroup(array($upped, $text), 'contents', 'Enter the 
contents', null, false);
        }
else {
            $this->addGroup(array($text, $upped), 'contents', 'Enter the 
contents', null, false);       
        }
"

Finally, the an excerpt from the Controller.php source:

/**
    * Returns the element's value
    *
    * @access public
    * @param  string    name of the page
    * @param  string    name of the element in the page
    * @return mixed     value for the element
    */
    function exportValue($pageName, $elementName)
    {
        $data =& $this->container();
        return isset($data['values'][$pageName][$elementName])? 
$data['values'][$pageName][$elementName]: null;
    }

- Jay
PS: Does anyone know how to (using QuickForm) add an explanatory block 
of information (other than by adding a "header") next to a certain 
element in a form?

Are they?

you would think they would be seeing how they have a list of top php
mistakes on thier site and they are afterall the creators of php.

BUT

try choosing one of the contestants you like, making a note of thier
id and going to this url

https://www.zend.com/php5/contest/rate.php?vote_again=1&cont_id=ENTER_CONTESTANT_ID_HERE&rating=5&

keep reloading the page and keep watching that contestant climb the
list until they get to the #1 spot, now be warned when they get close
to the top it will take longer to go up positions because of how many
votes the items have already.

now would zend really rely on this bogus voting system?

if you ask me that is just a POS voting system.

1.) first of all this big bug
2.) contestants can vote for themselves
3.) contestants can vote 1 for all other contestants

several people have stressed how bad this system is to zend they just
dont appear to care

write a lynx script, setup a cron with wget, just have to bypass the
login cookie, get that locked and you are good to go.

use an old alladvantage.com cheat that would make your browser refresh
the page every 10 seconds blah blah.

Ah, the real point is that the most efficient and effective cheater wins.
Kind of reminds you of the political system of a certain country, doesn't

Yes. There's another pseudo-element called html. The source for
HTML_QuickForm_html should be in HTML/QuickForm/html.php

no i meant what is the point of his app, all they need is cron or a lynx script

or even simpler Firefox with the home location of 20 tabs to load on
open and open 3-4 browsers at once boom 60-80 instant votes lol

development like this on zends part really makes me think twice about
taking thier training and getting zend certified.

Joel will still be giving the presentation, although perhaps with a spin
of "this is also how you could do it in Python" (which is actually
great).

I'm interesting in releasing code for general consumption. Do people
have checklists of things they do?

Specifically, how do you handle licensing? I want to release it under
the PHP license, version 3.0 (I think.) However, there's lots of odd
stuff in the licnese about bundling it with PHP that doesn't seem
relevant. Has anyone navigated this before?

Also, is the best way to deliver something as a PEAR package? Tarball?
Both?

As you can see, I'm not even sure what are the right questions to ask.

have you read the php license? if i am correct that license will allow
anyone to sell your code without anything you can do, you might want
to take a look at the GPL or LGPL licenses.  I mean if that is
something you do not want happening.

I am not an expert with pear but i believe if you are going to
distribute as a pearm package you should make it a tar.gz but you
should also include an xml file, i cant remember the name of it, so
that it can be installed by the pear command.

Check, double-check, test - and then put a disclaimer :)

As probably comes as no surprise, I'm a fan of the BSD license.  So, I
simply release everything under the generic BSD license, substituting
names where appropriate.

The discussion of which license is the correct one is obviously a very
long and religious one.  GPL has some advantages, depending on how you
want your code to live in the Internet.  That said, since you probably
own the copyright to the code, you could release it under many different
licenses, depending on purpose of intended use by the EU.

> Also, is the best way to deliver something as a PEAR package? Tarball?
> Both?

Again, I'm biased - just deliver it as a tarball of source files :)

> As you can see, I'm not even sure what are the right questions to ask.

You're not alone...

And you're going to let us know what this code is, right?  :)

This probably won't help the original poster answer any questions, but
your interpretation of the GPL is a little off.  It is perfectly legal
for anyone to take GPLed code and sell it to someone else.  That is, I
can take 'gcc' or 'emacs' or anything else that is GPLed and sell it to
someone if I wanted.  The catch is that when I sell it I have to be give
the customer the source code if they want it, and they can do whatever
they want with it.  Note that this is what Red Hat does with their Red
Hat Enterprise Linux and also the reason that things like White Box
Linux exist [1].

[1] White Box Linux is a linux distribution that is free to download and
is basically Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 built from SRPMs supplied by Red
Hat. -- www.whiteboxlinux.org

Apparently, Brian Connolly of Furthermore Inc. 
claims that Mambo has unlawfully used some of 
it's code.

http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1648592,00.asp 

I am interested in the case because (as nearly as 
I can make out) Mambo's position is that since the 
Furthermore work is derived from GPL code it must also 
be GPL'd, which would be true (as I understand GPL) 
if it were published -- which it was not.

This type of situation seems very muddy to me.
If anyone knows of a link to something along 
the lines of 'GPL licensing for dummies' I would 
appreciate learning of it.

(maybe you could send it to me offlist -- 
this has very little to do, at least directly, 
with PHP )

That's not exactly true -- you cannot sell GPLed code.
You can charge a 'reasonable fee' for distributing it 
i.e. "You may charge a fee for the physical act of 
transferring a copy".

Another condition of the license is that you must make 
the recipients of the work aware of the fact that it is being  
distributed under the GPL, i.e. "you [must] conspicuously 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice..."

One of the reasons is "you must show them these terms so they 
know their rights".

Red Hat does not sell the code -- it sells support. 
(Red Hat describes what you can buy from them in a section 
entitled " GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS" in their 
'Subscription Agreement').

I don't believe Red Hat guarantees the software as 
described in the GPL agreement, i.e. " you may at 
your option offer warranty protection in exchange 
for a fee". 

The language at:
http://www.redhat.com/licenses/rhel_us_3.html 

contains something pretty close to the following 
about whether the code will actually work or is of 
any value (merchantability): 

" provided and LICENSED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY..." 

This means the code is (legally) worthless and reemphasizes 
the point that it is not the code which is being sold.

Message-ID: <330532b60409250645206105f8@mail.gmail.com>

First off, a disclaimer that I am a Mambo core developer, and
therefore the tool of Satan.

I'd like to point out some of the facts behind this story:

1) Brian DID distribute Mambo from his site, for weeks (maybe months).
 We even took a screenshot of the downloads page because we thought it
was strange for him to claim something was his, but then distribute it
under the GPL under Miro's copyright.  (Miro is the copyright holder
for Mambo)  Typical Brian behavior, the download area of the site just
mysteriously disappeared...

2) The developer accused of 'stealing' the code actually wrote two
completely separate files - one was a quick hack (nine lines of code)
to a core component of Mambo for the 'client'; and the other was
written a month later with a completely different implementation.

3) The last point, which I find the most distasteful, is that Brian
was a happy member of the Mambo community for a whole year before he
said anything (and knew about the frontpage component/s functionality
all along), and only a month or so before announcing his new website
did he start making a fuss.  He says that he waited for an appropriate
time, I suppose when you need some free press that makes it
appropriate?

This is a PR man with an agenda, and if it had anything to do with
correcting a wrongdoing he would have taken us to court long ago.  I
never did see any evidence from him (no contract, no nothing) and have
been saying for weeks now, "Put up or shut up."  Unfortunately there
is nothing for him to put up, and he certainly won't shut up ;-) It
has grown so nauseatingly repetitive that we openly challenge him to
show us any solid proof - and the best he has mustered is an alleged
(but undelivered) email - which interestingly he fails to send to us
in whole for analysis, although he can send it to his crony
publishers...

Back on the 'alleged issues' (wink wink, nudge nudge), nobody seems to
note that the code Brian claims was stolen WAS NEVER INSERTED INTO
MAMBO CORE.  Please, read that last sentence again, and repeat after
me...  The developer modified 9 lines of code in frontpage.php and
sent it directly to Brian, and that code was never distributed after
that (except by Brian LOL).  On top of that, he has no patents or
trademarks on the 'leading column' front page display technique, as
that has been in use as long as we have had HTML tables (CNN, BBC
etc.)...

I can't tell if he is accusing Emir of stealing the code he paid him
to write (false), thinks he somehow owns the idea of a front page
(still false), or thinks that paying someone to write code
automatically makes it yours (which is also false).

Sorry for coming across so aggressive, but this guy is playing the
media for chumps, at the expense of a project completely manned by
volunteers (who have done nothing wrong), just for some free
publicity; and I really find that despicable.  How in the world can he
threaten the end users of Mambo - and knowing that he has no case,
then why threaten anyone at all?  SCO at least could try to make money
from IBM and others, but Brian is clearly after a media grab and could
care less about anyone but himself.

I would not read too much from the posted articles (hell I was even
misquoted enough to have to post corrections on my site) - but instead
take a look at what Brian says on his site, then read what Emir says
on his site, and what the Mambo team states on theirs:

http://www.literatigroup.com/versusmambo/
http://sakic.net/index.php?option=news&id=13
http://mamboserver.com/The_News/News/Statement_regarding_Furthermore.com/

Interesting is that Brian dedicates his whole site
(www.furthermore.com) now to assaulting Mambo, which powers his own
site.  *shrug*

I am told that the publicity is actually good for Mambo, as downloads
have spiked to the point of us needing more servers to handle the
load; but I am horribly offended that someone can just open up a
character assassination campaign and there is little to be done to
protect the innocent except lose hours and hours of valuable time. 
:-(

We've now opened up a legal defense fund, as we are convinced that
this kind of behavior will not go away and only get worse.  We've had
all the developers sign agreements to Miro to make sure who has the
ultimate copyright, and worry that this will eventually lead to us not
allowing third party code contributions without a 10-page legal
document :-(

IMHO this is the biggest threat to FOSS, the capability of someone
slandering and defaming a FOSS project, and the project having no
resources to defend itself.  Who's next?

Hi Adam:

I distribute software via bzipped tarballs.  I develop the programs in 
CVS and have a script that exports the stuff from CVS, tars it, zips 
it and produces GPG signatures and MD5 sums all in one shot.  I can 
toss that to you if you want.

Here's my downloads page

If he was distributing a 'derived work' based on code 
whose copyright is held by Miro and published under GPL, 
then he is obligated to give his changes or mods to Miro -- 
if indeed the Mambo copyright holder wants them. 

This fact that he was publishing his changes seems 
to me to be diametrically opposed to what this 
guy was claiming (again as nearly as I could make 
out from the news article) -- that the code was stolen 
from his unpublished work.

It is even worse that he is threatening to take action 
against the end users of Mambo (as you mentioned in 
your post). 

If this guy gets away with this (wins any sort of 
legal judgement), it could definitely put a scare 
into prospective clients, who you might be trying 
to persuade to use open source code -- Mambo or not.

This should be a grim reminder to EVERYONE just how easily the media
can be manipulated.  C|Net's original story basically presented
Brian's claims as fact, and never even attempted to contact Miro or
Mambo to see the other side of the issue - and in fact, presented
Brian's claims without even asking for any kind of verification
whatsoever.

Again, Brian does what is in Brian's interest, and that is it.  He
took Mambo and some third party products, stripped all of the credits
and copyright notices, and rebranded it as his own.  So not only did
he distribute his stuff as GPL, he was in violation by removing the
credits and copyrights to boot!

There is no legal threat from Brian, as he knows he has no evidence to
back up his claims.  Just look at his forum posts at mamboserver.com's
community forums (he was 'literati' at the time) and you will see that
when we called his bluff, resorted immediately to his smear campaign
and intimidation tactics with end users - and note, that he knows he
has no legal grounds to threaten anybody, he is REALLY doing this to
stop adoption of Mambo.

And as we are a volunteer-led effort with no funding, there is little
opportunity for us to go after him in court - with what resources? 
Hence the creation of the defense fund (hint, hint).

I've heard of users having a similar problem when connecting from Eclipse 
to SourceForge via SSH and CVS, so it may not be a Zend specific 
connection problem. There are some good results under 
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=eclipse+cvs+ssh+sourceforge&btnG=Google+Search

I think you need to involve Plink and keys in the process.

To test connectivity you might want to download a copy of Eclipse and try 
the following for connecting to CVS over SSH.  In particular, try out 
section III.

Hope that helps.

Daniel,

thanks that eclipse doc helped it stated that CVS_RSH should be set to
the path to plink.exe, Zend support kept telling me to set it to ssh
and then use putty to connect to my CVS Repository.

now that i have the ENV Variable set it is working thanks again...

Joseph,

Glad to hear to hear it worked out.  :)

I had been intending to convert that walk-through to an NYPHP AMPeers 
article some time back.  Maybe you could also share notes on your method 
for connecting to a CVS server over SSH using Zend studio?

The "journalist" in question is Stephen Shankland.  Keep this bozo's

I have no experience with Windows, however.

I don't really understand why you need to do any port forwarding unless
you're talking about a local firewall or something. But yes, I think puTTY
is the ssh client of choice for Windows users.

It's true that you can't exactly log in on the CVS server and get a shell,
but you do have an account there - that's how CVS is able to work at all.
They just do this when you log in:

     Welcome to cvs1.sourceforge.net
 
     This is a restricted Shell Account
     You cannot execute anything here.
 
     Connection to cvs.sourceforge.net closed.

> and i have tried doing this with the user account it just

With Linux, you just need two environment variables (or use command line
flags to set them) for CVS:

export CVSROOT='yourname at cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot'
export CVS_RSH='ssh'

I know that people who use Windows to connect to a secure CVS server use
puTTY for the CVS_RSH somehow, likely by specifying the full path to it.
The CVSROOT should be the same.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Daniel, if you can get it posted on the NYPHP site i can create a

was going to be ;)

This would be really useful. Please send me a copy.

Is the only thing I need to do to make a package usable with the PEAR
Package Manger is to include a suitable package.xml file? Can I use
pear to generate a package even if it's not part of PEAR?

If anyone has some information, which they feel will 
be of general interest or help to the PHP community, 
and they feel it should be published (and here I 
mean in addition to being published in the 
mail list archives), New York PHP has some 
established procedures for accomplishing this.

If the information covers so much ground 
that it would require a whole new section 
on the website, then it would be a project. 

You should then follow the guidelines for 
submitting a project at: 
 http://www.nyphp.org/content/presentations/nyphp/index.php?slide=10 

If the information is more along the lines of 
a best practice for coding or otherwise using 
PHP (e.g. how to best set PHP ini directives), 
it is more likely to be a candidate for a 
PHundamental article.
(see: http://education.nyphp.org/phundamentals/ ) 

Article ideas, which are candidates for a 'PHundamental',  
can be submitted to Jeff Siegel (jeff.siegel at nyphp.org) 
or Michael Southwell (michael.southwell at nyphp.org). 

Other information, which serves as a useful 
'backgrounder', would probably be best published  
as an AMPere.
(see: http://education.nyphp.org/ampeers/ ) 

You can get in touch with Jasper Lin (jasper.lin at nyphp.org), 
who is the AMPeers Project Manager. 

Actually all these ways to get something published 
are described on the website -- but I thought it 
might be handy to summarize them here. 

One more important thing about contributing to 
New York PHP is that you don't have to be a 
'ninja master' or a '6th degree black belt' in PHP 
to be able to contribute. 

I wish this fact were more widely known among associate 
members -- I sometimes get the feeling that many 
people are reluctant to offer to help, because 
they feel they haven't yet mastered PHP.

This is too bad because the fastest way to 
learn something is to work with other people 
who can give you a few 'pointers' -- not slug 
it out by yourself.

One thing i may think is stopping people from contributing is that it
is not very easy to contribute, i think you should have the
information easilly findable on the NYPHP site, and maybe an online
form for submitting stuff.

I contribute as much as i can at www.weberdev.com doing code examples
and articles because they make it very easy.

Jasper is working on just that (an online form).

Get in touch with him. I am sure he would 
welcome any ideas you may have -- 
an offer to help might be even better. 

(sorry about the bad email address: jasper.lin at nyphp.org) 

You can also get in touch with Mike or Jeff 
(see prev. post for addresses)

Tim is exactly right.  In fact, new user's articles are very valuable
because they often cover things that more experienced users just take
for granted.  As we all want people to use PHP, the more we cater to new
users, the better.  Everyone is encouraged to participate, and we'll
never say "hey, that's too basic..."  As noted, Jasper is the contact
for this as part of the AMPeers project.

Exactly right again...  We're working on getting a submittal form more
visible on the NYPHP.org site, and making it trivial for people to
contribute.  Again, anyone is welcome to contribute and help with the
actual coding of the site.  Jasper is doing a great job but I'm sure
another helping hand or two would be appreciated.  Contact Jasper
directly if interested.

Joseph, the Word document looks great.  Be sure to ping Jasper and it
could very likely be the first AMPeers article!

Hans,

you should start up a code example section on the NYPHP site, where
people can submit examples etc.. like on
http://www.weberdev.com/CodeExamples.php

i post all of my stuff there but if i could contribute to NYPHP as
well it would be nice.

Word docs have two major problems.  Massive bloat and being a 
proprietary format.  Plain old ASCII text is the best way to send 
stuff, particularly on a mailing list like this.   The same 
information can be transmitted in a small fraction of the space and be 
read by anyone.

I'd love to but unfortunately don't have the time over the next few
months.  That said, it doesn't mean someone else can't get it going :)

Jasper has done great work on the AMPeers, and someone could easily add
a code post area to it.  If you're interested in getting involved,
subscribe to the NYPHP-Org list (http://nyphp.org/lists) and let
yourself be heard.  We are fairly organized these days and if someone
has a little initiative stuff will get done.

Actually, NYPHP has a standard document format: XHTML. You can have
your plain text, images, and metadata in an open, distributable
unbloated format. The format has many open and closed source browsers
and editors, easily available to anybody.

http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/

Think of it as HTML that is XML compliant. This means, among other things,
that all tags need to be closed and nested properly, and tags with no end
tag need to be escaped (like <br /> instead of <br>). If you write really
neat HTML, you're probably pretty close already.

Anyone here know of a good place for a free CVS repository?
i know all about sourceforge and i have an account there for the OSS i
am working on with a friend however thier repository is very
restrictive i mean to the point where it wont let you remove
directories but it will let you remove files.  To get
directories/modules removed you need to contact thier support then
wait over the weekend for it to get done.  I know everyone needs a
break especially on weekends but... i need something less restrictive.

I found a site CVS Guy or something like that which offered free
accounts but only for 2mb and 1 user, lemme ask this what is the point
of cvs with 1 user? may as well just create a local folder named CVS
lol

There is also a great free tool - tidy -  that coverts HTML to XHTML.
So you don't *actually* have to concern yourself with writing XHTML.

http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ 

Tidy can even chew through MSHTML, the junk you get when you Save As
Webpage in Word. So you can write using whatver tool you want. You can
also compile PHP with support for libtidy if you want to script it.

The only drawback with markup for a document with screenshots is that
you have to put the screenshots on a public server somewhere.

I think sharing code examples is a great idea.

I would think NYPHP is in a unique position for peer-reviewed 
publishing, which appears to be the intent of amppeers and 
phundamentals. In my opinion there are enough advertising-supported, 
low-barrier-to-entry publishing venues already.

My quick look at weberdev's code section tells me it is an ad-revenue 
content aggregator more than anything else (many "published" code 
examples showing several thousand views, zero feedback comments, and at 
least one interstitial ad plus one inline ad for each page view).

Agreed... there could be great benefit to the community with a properly
managed project.

This type of project has come up before, and I have some notes from
people regarding some great ideas.  Unfortunately, the project didn't
get picked up because of time constraints.

Someone should step forward to lead the effort and become a NYPHP
Principal member - let me know and I can share my notes to get you
started.

Hans,

i attempted to email you directly and got this.

This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification

Delivery to the following recipient failed permanently:

Technical details of failure:

so here is the previous email
- Hide quoted text -

Hans,

if i were to take on the code samples project, would i have to follow
in line with someone else's coding style such as integrating it with
some other part of the site or could i start from scratch?

i would prefer to start from scratch but find someone on the list to
also look over my code (i am not the greates when it comes to security
stuff) so that i can be sure it wont be too exploitable.

I have been venturing into PHP 5 and OOP, does the NYPHP server support PHP 5?

i would love to create a system much more feature rich than weberdev
has setup, the only reason i post there is to win stuff from thier
contests lol this may be an idea for NYPHP however i think we would
get a lot of garbage posted just for the contest for instance look at
this.

http://www.weberdev.com/get_example-3617.html

they left that as an example of what not to submit.

i would love to talk with you either on IM or the phone about this at
some point.

I know i have not been a long term member of NYPHP nor have i been
able to attend any meetings, i joined the usergroup because there are
no UG in vermont pertaining to PHP and i dont have the knowledge nor
ambition to start one.  However in my time on the mailing list i have
been helped out numerous times and i would like to also give back to
the NYPHP community.

Granted it may take a few months to get anything finalized and ready
for the site due to time constraints (i work strictly from home
freelancing) but this is something i can take on.

Also i would like to touch on the subject of design, although i am
good with php i have not been able to master any design stuff, i mean
i know the basics of css and html however images/javascript etc.. will
be needed for this project, do you know any other NYPHP members that
may be interested in contributing to this?

Also i wanted to ask is there a list of rules for posting to the lists
i would like to read them if there are so that i dont break anymore :)

For some reason, you have to use nyphp.com (rather than .org) for member
email addresses now. This is a fairly recent change, since I used to use
nyphp.org for everyone.

I'm assuming it's a temporary situation of some sort.

(rimshot)

Actually one option would be someone like Server Beach
(www.serverbeach.com), where you pay $99 monthly to have your own
server.  For $99 bucks, you could afford to get a couple...

Hi Joe,

I seem to recall some comment about 'i understand the use of sessions 
thanks' a little while ago, but I'll help you out anyway.

You need to change the second if statement in your getObject function. 
It should read:

function &getObject($class) {
   if (!isset($_SESSION['objects'])) {
     $_SESSION['objects'] = array();
   }

   if (!isset($_SESSION['objects'][$class])) {
     $_SESSION['objects'][$class] =& new $class;
   }

   return $_SESSION['objects'][$class];
}

There will be an official PEAR package soon (probably by the end of the 
week) http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=36 But you 
probably already know that.

You can use PEAR to generate the xml file and then package everything 
up. It doesn't have to be a part of PEAR for this to work. Take a look 
at http://pear.php.net/package/PEAR_PackageFileManager That class will 
help you create the xml file. Then all you have to do is run
$ pear package
in the directory that your package.xml file lives.

Then to install it all anyone has to do is run
$ pear install packagename.tar.gz

Isn't it a bit dangerous to pass an object not-serialized into a 
session?  Just an observation.

Message-ID: <8d9a4280040927085619571fe7@mail.gmail.com>

the sessions seem to carry over now however my resource ID for my
$db->connection keep changing, i have even altered the open method to
look like this

		if(!$this->connection) {
			$conn = mysql_connect($hostname, $username, $password);
			if(!$conn) trigger_error(mysql_error(), E_USER_ERROR);
			else $this->connection = $conn;
		}

any ideas how to keep that from getting a new resource handle but
rather use the same one?

Thanks. I am familiar with Services_EBay. That uses our XML API
instead of our SOAP API. For various business/corporate reasons, I
want to make sure people can use *both* sets of APIs on PHP.

For one, certain calls are only available as SOAP calls. Also, the
SOAP API has a better data schema. Next, the SOAP interface is
automatically updated just by us changing our WSDL, while
Services_EBay will require some manual additions. Last, some people
just like SOAP for SOAP's sake.

Personally, I will probably use Services_EBay, but that's a different
story. :)

Awesome. With PEAR, I can never tell what's current practice and
what's two years old. I'll take a look at this.

Well, you COULD incorporate your work into that PEAR package or create 
another PEAR package so PEAR'istas will have both available.

I definitely *don't* want to integrate my work in that PEAR package.

For one, I don't want to introduce an external dependency on
PEAR::SOAP. Second, I will eventually port my code to use ext/soap, so
there will be changing requirements. (SOAP is so fricking hard to
understand, I need to play around on PEAR::SOAP before I can write up
meaningful ext/soap bug reports.)

Also, as I already mentioned, the SOAP API has a completely different
schema as the XML API. Switching between them is not just a matter of
altering the underlying protocols.

Therefore, to cleanly graft the two together, I'd need to abstract out
far too much to make it worth my time. However, since the code is open
source, I would be happy if someone else wanted to do it. :)

I actually don't want to submit this as an official PEAR package, but
I want to make it easy to install, hence my interest in how pear
packaging works.

Ok,

1. You don't need to manually serialize stuff you put into the session 
through $_SESSION, php automatically serializes and unserializes the 
$_SESSION array for you.

2. You cannot store a resource ID in a session.  The resource ID is 
specific to that particular instance of the script, you will have to 
reopen the database connection for each request.

If you use persistent database connections it *may* still use the same 
connection to the database, but the resource ID will be different.

Ok I'm sorry I have to ask this: Why is it specific to just $_SESSION 
that it auto-serializes anything you put into it?

To understand this you need to have an understanding of how the session 
mechanism actually works in PHP.

Basically, the $_SESSION variable is just that; a variable, but it is 
special for 2 reasons.

1. It is an autoglobal like $_GET, $_POST, etc.

2. PHP knows that you want anything you put into $_SESSION to be 
accessible throughout the whole session.

After the request has completed and the page has been sent to the user, 
PHP takes the contents of the $_SESSION variable and serializes it. 
This serialized value is then passed to the session handler function for 
storage.

The session handler built into php is 'files', which writes the 
serialized string to a file in the directory defined in the 
session_save_path ini setting.  You can also define your own session 
handlers (See: http://php.net/session_set_save_handler)

When PHP receives another request for the same session, it will retrieve 
and automatically unserialize the session data, placing the unserialized 
array into the $_SESSION variable ready for your script to use.

So, the serializing it automatically done by php behind the scenes, you 
don't have to do any of it.

It wouldn't be very intuitive otherwise. Imagine doing something like
this:

$foo = array('a', 'b', 'c');
$_SESSION['foo'] = $foo;

It wouldn't make much sense if you were to echo $_SESSION['foo'] on
another page and get:

Array

Maybe I don't understand the question...

Both of which I already know, however, that alone does not intuitively 
tell me that if you put something into $_SESSION that it will 
auto-serialize.

Right.  It will save $_SESSION as a flat file with content.  That also 
does not tell me it will auto-serialize, otherwise, so will this:

fputs($fileID, array('hello', 'world'));

That's cool, however, what happens when you do serialize it anyway?  
I've been doing so in PHP 4.3.2 with cool results:

$_SESSION['myArray'] = serialize($myArray);
print_r(unserialize($_SESSION['myArray'])); // LOOKS LIKE AN ARRAY TO ME

It just seems too "random" for anyone to know that you never have to 
serialize anything into $_SESSION, although your explanations are fine.  
That's up there with knowing about "=@" IMHO.

i guess i am a bit confused as to why you cannot store a resouce id in
a session?

is a resource id the only thing that you cannot put into a session?

Because PHP does not preserve resources across requests in the way
that you are expecting it. Trying to access a resource created on a
previous page will not work.

Session information is stored as text in a serialized fashion.  
Resources are live items that have been negotiated between PHP and 
other programs on your computer.  You're kind of asking like, "Why can 
I store ME on a piece of paper in a file cabinet?"

I'm not sure if this is on-topic for this group, but I'm sure I'll hear
about it if it isn't. :-)

One of my clients has hired a third-party vendor to write a graphical
front-end to the database that I'm constructing.  It's not an admin
tool; it's more of a graphical report-generator.  

Example usage: You click on a link and up pops a graph of the stock 
market and several indices for the past week. Click on the red index
line anywhere in the Tuesday area and a graph appears showing just that 
index on an hourly basis for Tuesday.

The third party vendor is doing this under a legacy operating system
(and I'm going to have to tie it in to MySQL running on RHEL 3! Oh
joy!).  

I was wondering how you would do this under F/OSS? Would it make sense
to do this in PHP on the backend?  How would you do the drill-downs? I'm
thinking maybe XUL on the front-end making database calls via XML-RPC
but how would you generate new graphics?

I think something like this would go over *very well* in business, but I
haven't seen the technology in F/OSS to allow it. Are there
libraries/PEAR packages/CPAN modules/etc. that would make this
(relatively) easy for a developer to slap together?

Joseph,

I believe the answer is:
Because the next time the script runs, the resource might not be assigned
the same reference? So your stored reference refers to nothing. I just woke
up and other examples don't come readily to mind.

Well, if you generate a random number and store it in a session,
then generate another next time and compare them to see if they match?
Useful for especially hardened security.

Sounds like you need a run-time engine for PHP.  It would sure be great 
to share
real resources/objects/etc between page invocations (and not just serialized
versions).

BTW, does anyone know what ever happened to this project

Some people would tell you this is exactly what you don't need, but
I'm staying out of the app server scalability debate.

I think Derick still plays with this a little bit.

I'm having real trouble tracking down some segfaults I'm having from a 
commandline php script that I have written.  I found this
article http://bugs.php.net/bugs-generating-backtrace.php on gdb backtrace. 
I'm not really following the core file thing, I havn't been able to generate 
it and the directory with httpd is writable by the user running php as per 
the instructions.   I tried the alternative approach when you can't get at 
core file.  Now when I run the run -X command I get the error below where it 
tells me it exits with code 01 which I havn't been able to find anything 
about.  Does anyone else have any experience in this area or have any ideas?

Thanks,
Dallas

Message-ID: <8d9a4280040929132257930bb@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

i know this isnt directed fully towards php but i have been developing
sites for some time now and one of the parts i lack is the knowledge
about search engines and spidering.

Lately i have read a bit about the NYPHP site and something about
search engine spidering.  I understand the basics such as basic meta
tags but what i need to know is if there is an easy way without use
apache's mod_rewrite to make a search engine index pages that have
querystrings such as

product.php?id=57 

where each id shows a dynamic page filled with information about
different products.

now one would think that when it spiders your products.php page and it
shows links to products it would follow them and then index the
results as if it was an html document, however i have been told that
pages like that are not indexed.

If anyone can direct me to any books/online reading etc.. i would appreciate it.

There's tons of misinformation out there about this. As a technologist, 
your best bet (my best advice) is learn about apache and mod rewrite, 
and learn about search engines and how they work. Then, and only then, 
if mod rewrite looks like a solid solution to your needs, then put it to 
use.

The script kiddie approach is not suitable for search engine work, but 
the web is full of script-kiddie solutions and articles. Most of it is 
garbage IMHO.

I think I am scheduled for the January NYPHP meeting on this very topic....

-=john andrews

PS: search engines already index pages with query strings. Do a search 
for any junk and you'll see it..
like 
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=%22.php%26site%3D%22&btnG=Search

I generally build 'spider food' pages for our sites. Since we're usually
putting our navigation in Flash files, the search engines can't hit interior
pages. I find that this technique also works well for dynamic pages.

Here's an example of a basic one, that rides in the footer of the home page:

http://thesagamore.com/sitemap.html

You can see that it works because this link for an interior section comes up
perfectly in google:

http://www.google.com/search?q=the+sagamore+specials


And here's an example of Google finding a dynamic page (it's #2 on the list)
http://www.google.com/search?q=sagamore+thanksgiving+special


Not sure if that helps you out much, it's pretty basic. But it works.

This isn't true. Some search engines may not do this, but a lot do. For 
example, Google, MSN and Yahoo all show query strings in search 
results. I generally don't worry about this issue.

It seems you're in search of an answer to a problem that doesn't 
exist.  I know Google searches pages with query strings.  I'd guess 
most of the others do as well.

I use ForceType, but mod_rewrite can work, too. My choice is based upon
the fact that I'm no Sklar or Schlossnagle when it comes to regular
expressions.

If I were you, I'd prefer to have URLs like this:

http://store.example.org/products/flying-car

Users don't care about your internal product IDs and such. Keep those to
yourself. :-)

The way you can have a URL like I use above is to make "products" a PHP
script. It doesn't need a file extension, because you can use ForceType to
tell Apache to treat it like a PHP file. The rest of the URL is available
to you in $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'], so you can use that to determine what
product the user wants.

Search engines apparently like this sort of approach, too. I do it,
because I like to have clean URLs.

PHP 5 - if so, any gotchas that one might expect from similar OOP

No.  PHP does not support multi-method dispatch at all.

Unfortunately no, but then again, most would argue that multiple 
constructors are a bad thing.  Unlike in Java, where parameters are not 
allowed to be set as optional, PHP allows for this at the expense of 
uniquely-named constructors.

Thus, in Java you have multiple constructors because you have to, in PHP 
you can't have multiple constructors because you don't ever have to.

Yes, but that's not a language-level feature in the way that Java

I gave a talk about this at the NYPHP meeting back in May 2002 :)
I can't find the slides :( but I did find these two list entries which 
might help:

http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2002-May/000119.html
http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2002-September/000947.html

To make a long story short -  learn regular expressions (they really 
aren't that hard) and use mod_rewrite.
Most decent hosting providers support it. If you're not sure if yours 
does - do a phpinfo(); and u can get a list of all the apache modules 
they support.

If nothing else, mod rewrite lets you change your site structure and not 
have to worry bout old dead links :)

Yep, and can quote the .htaccess supplied by Mambo as an example:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php

That works for us, and we added it specifically for folks with the El
Cheapo (TM) $5 monthly hosting plan.

Message-ID: <415B484D.1020607@adnet-sys.com>

Consider these two classes. Class Accepter in placement_classes.inc.php 
works as a form validation object, and it works like a charm:

    |PHP:|
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    // placement_classes.inc.php - THIS ONE WORKS!

    class Accepter {

      function Accepter() {
            $this->dbAP =& new DBActionPerformer();
            $this->dbAP->connect();
            $this->validate();
            $this->dbAP->disconnect();
            $this->dbAP = null;
      }

        /**
         * Perform validation
         *
         * @access private
         */
        function &validate() {                                                                        //
    STATIC VOID METHOD
            foreach ($_POST as $key => $val) if (!isset(${$key})) ${$key} = $val;

            $varErrArray = array();
            array_push($varErrArray,  'placement_name|setMandatory~setMinLength~setMaxLe
    ngth~setPattern|You must enter a location name~Your location name
    must be 2 or more characters~Your location name must be 50 or fewer
    characters in length~^(?!.*<[^>]+> )|Your location name
    configuration is unrecognizable by our system, please re-enter with
    legitimate characters|');
            array_push($varErrArray, 'unique_key|setMandatory|You must
    have a unique key prior to posting||');

            /*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

              createErrorMsgCollection function from formvalidation.inc
    standalone function returns an array of ErrorMsgCollection
              objects
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

            $this->errorMsgObjArray =& createErrorMsgCollection($varErrArray);


            // CREATE FORM OBJECT PASSING ARRAY OF OBJECTS AS PARAMETER
            $this->formValidator =& new FormValidator('', $this->errorMsgObjArray);

            $this->isValid = $this->formValidator->isValid();
            $this->setErrorArray($this->formValidator->getErrorArray());
            $this->formValidator = null;
            $this->errorMsgObjArray = null;

                    /*
            if (strcmp(strtolower($action), 'add') == 0 ||
    (strcmp(strtolower($action), 'edit') == 0 && $placement_name !==
    $origPlacementName))
             $this->checkDuplicatePlacement($placement_name);        //
    CHECK FOR DUPLICATE PLACEMENT
                    */
        }

    }
    |
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------



This is the class Accepter from contacts_classes.inc.php and while it is 
now identical in code structure to the Accepter classe in 
placement_classes.inc.php, whenever this class method is invoked, all 
processes stop (no errors), arrays are unfinished, objects are 
unfinished, HTTP never produces, Apache goes down, literally everything 
crashes!

    |PHP:|
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |

    class Accepter {

        function Accepter() {

            $this->validate();
            $this->dbAP->disconnect();
            $this->dbAP = null;
        }

        /**

    set isValid boolean property
         *
         * @access public
         */
        function &validate() {                                    //
    STATIC VOID METHOD
            foreach ($_POST as $key => $val) if (!isset(${$key})) ${$key} = $val;

I've been trying to debug this for days now to no avail. I can verify 
every object property is present and accounted for (and identical in 
every way), but if you evoke one it's fine, the other and a segfault!

Help!

Thanx

So,  put the max number of parameters that could be passed in the  
constructor and just pass arg1, arg2 to the max upon instantiation,  
depending on the situation?

Or just use func_get_args()

I see, that will work for me George.

Would you agree that if it is an object or a certain "typed" parameter 
you expect, you should explicitly show what the constructor is 
expecting. I mean for the sake of a future programmer using  the 
class.?

I'm going to think about objects all night, instead of getting any 
scripting done. : )

It's certainly one of the nice aspects of php5's typehints support.  Of 
course, most other scripting languages don't support typehinting at all 
(Python, Perl, etc.), so it's not like you are losing something you 
might have if you move to a peer-language.  Unfortunately true 
multimethod dispatch would be slow as molasses in PHP, which is the 
primary excuse/reasoning for it not being implemented.

You should go with the way that works and submit a bug to bugs.php.net.  
  Scripts shouldn't be able to crash the interpreter, so it's a  
righteous bug.

There are some very specific and good reasons to eliminate url's with 
query strings. Getting spidered and indexed just isn't one of them :-)

That is why I suggested you have clear objectives. You don't simply want 
to get rid of query string URLs in order to get indexed. You may however 
want to get rid of complex, low-readability URLs in order to better 
communicate your content message to the masses (visitors as well as 
spiders).

As Chris Shiflett highlighted already,  
www.yoursite.com?id=456&prod_id=564  is not nearly use "useful" to 
anyone as something like  www.yoursite.com/cars/hover_cars/index.html
The search engines will reward you for improved usability like that (not 
just index you, but rank you higher for keywords associated with cars, 
hover cars, and your site's known themes). In addition you are more 
likely to get bookmarked, and your bookmarks will make better sense in 
your traffic logs.

Additionally, Search Engines may or may not consider 
www.yoursite.com?id=456&prod_id=564  and  
www.yoursite.com?id=322&prod_id=567 as different pages. This is an 
emerging research area, but it seems that Google is considering them to 
be 2 variants of the same page. At first this may not be important as 
long as they both appear in the index. However, since the index is a 
finite resource and the SEs love to keep it *all* in the shared memory 
of their server clusters at all times (for speed), it is inevitable that 
SEs will have to prioritize on inclusion of pages. It is reasonable to 
think variants of the same page will be demoted early in that process. 
It is also reasonable to think this is done already, at several levels. 
There are PageRank issues associated with this as well, even less 
understood. Again much of this stuff is on the edge.... issues like 
semantic URLs being better than cryptic query strings - that is much 
more concrete.

There are empirical data (based solely on observations) that suggest a 
site structure with one level is prefered over one with deep 
directories. That means a site with www.site.com/small_cars.html  and 
www.site.com/large_cars.html is preferred over one with 
www.site.com/cars/small/index.html and www.site.com/cars/large/index.html.

Similarly there is large body of empirical knowledge on search engine 
preferences, for each engine and certain conditions. They are all 
important in optimizaton and when competing, but many are also very 
important just for search engine friendliness.

For example it is pretty clear that www.site.com/index.html is "better" 
than www.site.com/index or www.site.com/index/. The SE bots are seeking 
out *pages* (called documents) and love plain and simple HTML. In 
general the more you look simple clean (and valid!) HTML the better they 
will treat you. It is especially important when you are trying to get 
the spider to flag your site for deep crawling. It appears "difficult" 
sites are defered for deep crawling compared to "easy" sites, all other 
things being equal. Some people see a deep crawl and others see frequent 
visits for small batches of pages.... there is an algorithm at work there.

By the way Flash is indeed spidered and indexed. You have to make it 
easy for the bots semantically. Take a look at a Google search for .swf  
and you'll see many sites are listed and indexed with good snippets, 
while others are only listed, and some are indexed with "poor" snippets. 
There are even some advantages to be gained from using Flash.... I could 
tell you some tricks, but then I'd have to.... ;-)

The proposed NYPHP talk in January is alot of this kind of stuff, 
specifically tailored to the PHP programmer and overall technical 
webmaster of a site. It is my perspective that with a certain level of 
awareness of the issues, the PHP programmer/site designer can take 
certain steps early on which make it much easier for search engine 
specific improvements to be made later. In my work I have to break the 
bad news to site programmers and designers after the site has been built 
-- that it needs an overhaul or needs to be rebuilt. I would prefer to 
be more popular than I am ;-)  Alot of that pain would go away if 
certain things were considered at design and construction time.

In order to use Rewrite directives in .htaccess, the following must be true:

1) your httpd is compiled with mod_rewrite (or loads it dynamically at runtime)

2) there is an AllowOverride FileInfo directive in httpd.conf that
applies to the directory in which your .htaccess resides

If those conditions are met you'll get mad crazy server errors.

Hi,

I have a directory that is password protected with .htaccess.  I have 
two files in that directory that I would like to have accessible 
without requiring a login.  I'm looking for a quick fix, is there a way 
to prevent/override the .htaccess password requirements for individual 
files?

Thanks,

AFAIK, no, not if your are relying on Apache's per-directory configuration
mechanism (which you are). You can either move those files that you want
to be available to a publicly accessible directory, or use PHP's http
authentication mechanism on only those files that you do want to keep
private (http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php).

Yep, you can do it using a <FilesMatch> that matches just the files
you want to open up. The following allows students to download zip,
pdf, and doc files, but only instructors get directory listings and
anything else:

AuthType Basic
AuthName "Instructors Only"
AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/conf/htpasswd
Require user training

<FilesMatch "\.(zip|pdf|doc)$">
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
  Satisfy any
</FilesMatch>

The "Statisfy any" directive is the key to the whole thing.

New to php.... I've extracted an app [1] to my http docs dir,
the first couple php pages work, the server has

LoadModule php4_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/libphp4.so

<IfModule mod_dir.c>
    DirectoryIndex index.shtml index.html index.php index.htm index.cgi
</IfModule>

    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

but the next page is blank,

<html><body></body></html>

I seem to have the package requirements, but I'm thinking it's a problem
on my end because the package looks well developed. Though, I see no
errors, can I enable debugging in php?

You can enable error logging in PHP -- take a quick tour through your
php.ini file. You'll need to restart apache to make the changes stick.

Say you've got a couple classes which at times need to read and insert 
from a DB.
These classes will be instantiated within pages on the site.
I'm thinking of  using a database class which gets instantiated on 
every page which might need it, then pass the handle as an object to 
the other classes to use.
This seems to work fine. I just feel funny about having classes lying 
around which rely on another class having been instantiated somewhere 
upwards on a page.

Will using Pear DB,  if you call DB:: connect() twice on a page, will 
it open two connections to the database?

The first way is the way to go.  Having multiple connection attempts is 
inefficient.  If you want flexibility of potentially not having the 
prior objects loaded, have the subsequent objects do a check if DB is 
instantiated or not.  If not, then instantiate it.
