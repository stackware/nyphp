<PRE>I's say for tonight you should rent a hotel room if you want 24/7 access

Wow, 2 replies instantly for Hive at 55.  That is nice, but I need 24/7
access tonight --- And they don't offer that in their regular &quot;Drop In&quot;
package, do they?    How fast could I pay for access anywhere to gain
24/7 Access?

Matt

	I am a programmer who  an office to work out of both on a
short-term (instant, asap) basis and also longer-term basis for my

	On a shorter-term basis, I need to quickly find an office that I
can work in today (this afternoon, possibly even into tonight) around
midtown (or other locations I am open to :)), that I could work out of. 
	
	Even locations such as Long Island and NJ would be possible too,
depending on size and space and how easy it is to access (eg PATH, LIRR,
train... cab).
