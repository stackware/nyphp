Can't be done as it's a security issue
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/signed-scripts.html

http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6409-10/sec.htm

(search for the word 'status' in those docs)

IE7 and Firefox have settings (in their settings menus) to allow JS to do
so, but unless you're dealing with an intranet of sorts, that may not be
much help to you since they're off by default.

You used to be able to pop open a new window without a status bar  
though... I'm pretty sure that still works... so you do a window.open  
with the option 'status=no'.  Your users may find a popup annoying  
though (or may block it).

The only thing I think is possible is to open a new window from a page 
that does not have a status bar (or any bars for that matter). That may 
not work out in Firefox as those links are typically opened in a new 
tab, which doesn't get you anything.

Maybe knowing why you want to hide the status bar will make it easier to 
give some tips.

Not sure if this is what you are looking for but I know you can open a browser and disable the status bar.  

http://www.pageresource.com/jscript/jwinopen.htm

I do this often when creating admin interfaces and I want my browser to look more like a dialog box.

AT first glance, I thought you guys were absolutely right and in my reply I
was specifically referring to the current window's status bar.  But it seems
the newer browsers don't even let you control the status bar in the popups.

The oldschool way to do it was adding a 'scrollbars=0' to the window.open
command like this:

<html>
	<head>
		<script language="javascript">		
			var openWindow = function() {
				var winRef = window.open('openwindow.html',
'myWindow', 'status=0, width=200, height=200, menubar=0, toolbar=0,
location=0, scrollbars=0');
			};
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a href="#" id="windowHandle">Window!!</a>
		<script
language="javascript">document.getElementById('windowHandle').onclick =
openWindow;</script>
	</body>
</html>

But I just tested this in IE 7.latest and FF
2.whatever.i.downloaded.yesterday and everything is gone except the status
bar.  I'm betting this is an even bigger deal now that these browsers tend
to show https status and other such security warnings in the status bar.

Unless there's another way to open a window, I'd say you can't do it in a
new window anymore.

No javascript required, just have the client use Safari. (just kidding)

As others pointed out, hiding the status bar is considered a security
no-no because it is often the only way for a user to discover
cross-site scripting and phishing attacks.

Even if you can control it in older browsers, you probably won't be
able to in newer ones.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP array_unique vs. SQL DISTINCT
Message-ID: <4662F9C8.8030801@gmx.net>

Hi!

Which one is faster: PHP array_unique or SQL DISTINCT ?

I learned about the DISTINCT key word for SQL some time ago and remember 
that pro developers always told me that SQL is faster than code.
I tested a slightly complex select query across three tables and used 
DISTINCT. The tables have each less than 1,000 records, two of the three 
have only about 600 rows. I let the query run for at least half an hour 
before I hit the reset button (PHP would have timed out much earlier). I 
then tested again but without any sorting, but that didn't make any 
difference. I then googled and some claim that DISTINCT isn't all that 
speedy.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

David

OK, while I still like to know what the answer is, the DISTINCT wasn't 
the culprit, but the way I join the tables. I ran the query across only 
two tables and with that got millions of records when I expected only a 
few hundred.
I guess it is time to learn some more SQL and not just go for broke and 
run queries without knowing what they really do. Worked fine in the test 
system with only a dozen records in each table. My approach apparently 
doesn't scale well.

Does it mean the end of P(*) + MySQL on the backend? ;-)

While I don't think it is the end, it would mark a new way to program

Thoughts?  Will some of this be cover in 6.28 meetup re: RIA?

The key to speedy SQL is in the indexes. Without an index the SQL engine
iterates over every row. With an index it automagically grabs the correct
value.

Try using EXPLAIN to check your queries if they don't seem to be working as
expected.

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table_name;

Good Afternoon NYPHP Talk,

If you hit the browser's Back button after submitted POST, that dialog
box pops up that reads:

 "The page you are trying to view contains POSTDATA ... To resend the
 data hit Ok. Otherwise hit Cancel."

The way I see it, this message box must NEVER appear on a professional
site. It makes no sense [1].

For most things I can use GET. Fine. But to submit forms with GET it
seems to me that would require some questionable JavaScript to build a
URL from the form field elements. Does anyone condone such a thing?

What do you recommend for avoiding that stupid POSTDATA dialog box?

Mike

[1] and it should have been removed from browsers a long time ago since
you can catch and ignore redundant POSTs (but that's a different rant).

Good to know. I heard about indices before, but wasn't really aware that 
they have such a huge impact. Since my days of maintaining Paradox 
tables I am a bit scared of indices as for Paradox they are often more 
trouble than they are worth. I know, SQL is a different universe.
Any good tips as what to index? I doubt that indexing every column makes 
sense. I see what changes when I index those columns that I use within 
selects. There are some columns that I read out after I made my 
selection and also in a different script in a different context and 
there for only one row from.


> Try using EXPLAIN to check your queries if they don't seem to be working

> 
> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table_name;

I will let SQL explain to me what I try to explain to SQL. While working 
on a workaround I thought about what my misfiring query does and in fact 
it does what I want it to do. I'll have a copy of the old file and I 
will see what happens after indexing.

The workaround is something I used before and that works fairly well. I 
select the wanted rows from each of the three tables. They are all keyed 
based on an ID that logically links the records together (I don't use 
set table links, because I don't know how that works in MySQL). I end up 
with three arrays of IDs, I merge the arrays, make the values unique, 
rekey, then populate a temporary table that has the ID column and the 
few columns I want to do sorts on. I then pull a new array of IDs from 
that table using a simple select with the desired sorting.
Of course, the db now has to process hundreds (thousands) selects and 
deal with a temp table that requires simple inserts, but since each of 
those queries runs in a few microseconds if not faster this may be OK 
for what I need it for.
I read a few articles where some claim that people have no right to life 
for using temp tables, but others say that they are helpful and make 
things faster and easier, especially when it is about working through 
complex selects.

And there I thought I'm almost done...LOL.

This is really an eyeopener. After indexing all those columns that come 
up in some selects running the same query that took over 30 minutes 
(that's when I hit the reset button) now takes 26 seconds.

This is plain awesome! Thanks for making me less dumb.

Hi Chris,

Thanks. Your HTTP spec references are interesting. I think I'll stick
to POST for actions. I've always felt a little icky about using the
Location header but I'll try it out and see how it goes.

One special case is the search box which uses POST so I'll have to use
some JavaScript to make that use GET.

Thanks,
Mike

Actually what am I talking about, I can just set the form method to GET.

Hello All, 

I've asked some questions similiar to this in the past .. but would like to get additional
information and hopefully some real feedback from those who have experiance with it.

We currently have a paypal merchant account that we use to collect payments from customers with.

We are releasing a product that will offer a monthly subscription. I'd like to use our existing paypal
account to handle the billing. I've looked into the subscription text on paypal, and I understand it fine.

What I'm not sure about doing is this:

When a visitor decides to purchase our software (its web based) and signs up for the account
I need to get their data into paypal. Now, once they finish the transaction, I want to return them 
to my software, and if they successfully completed the paypal signup I will automagically create
their account.

I also want to be able to query paypal every month to make sure they have paid, and if not, possibly
suspend their account.

So my question is: Does anyone have experiance using the paypal IPN (i believe that is what its called),
or experiance with another merchant account that allows this type of integreation? 
Also, could you recommened other merchant accounts and include some comparision against paypal?

Thanks!
- Ben

I have not used Paypal for recurring payments - I did write a system 
that integrated with Verisign's recurring payment system (now actually 
owned by Paypal).

Zend had an article on Paypal integration (including recurring payments) 
but they took it down. You can still find the article on archive.org's 
"wayback machine":

...Okay, admittedly this describes Dojo Storage's offline component,

Hello,

Brian - How was the experiance with Verisign ..?

Archive.org is having lots of problems returning a result for my search .. 
but I did find
through google this pretty good link: 
http://www.zend.com/code/codex.php?id=1488&single=1

It mentions setting up sandbox accounts for a buyer and fake cc/bank 
accounts, which is something
else I was wondering about for testing purposes.

Thanks.

- Ben

When it comes to choosing which columns to index, you want to pick something
with a high cardinality, or, for lack of a better term, "uniqueablity".
Gender wont have a high cardinality because there are only 2 choices for
many records. Last name on your personal family address book will have a low
cardinality because of family members sharing last name. A key of last name
+ first name will have a high cardinality and will make a good index.

Thanks for the explanation. I will index based on that. I decided to go 
with the temp table approach for now as this lets me work with queries 
that I can comprehend.
I a past post I wrote that I merge the arrays that I get for each table. 
While I in fact did that, I really need to do an intersect to create an 
INNER JOIN. I filter each table based on the contents or ranges of 
particular fields and only those items that have at least one row in 
each table are the ones that I want. Two tables can have only one row 
per item by design, so the distinct will come into play for only one 
query. With that I also do not need an array_unique as the intersect 
cannot have duplicate values.

Good stuff!

David

Your customer can sign up for the paypal subscription just like 
purchasing any other paypal item. Your IPN script will be called by 
paypal whenever a recurring payment is made. The status of the payment 
is sent to your IPN script so you will know if it was successful or not.

If you are using DISTINCT probably means you need to normalize your data 
and look to join more appropriately.  Also for creating indexes you 
really need to consider how you plan to access your data and how it will 
be used - which goes back to properly normalizing database tables.  With 
properly structured tables you should be easily able to identify certain 
relationships and know where to put indexes - preferably columns that 
are used for JOINS and WHERE.

Good place to start:

Hope it helps

Thank you for that pointer. The three tables that I have are for 
pictures. One table contains everything that revolves around the file 
itself, such as storage location, rotation angle, addition and creation 
dates. The second table has the name and description for the picture. 
The third table holds all the categories that can be attached to a 
single picture. And that table will have more than one row for each 
picture, unless I limit assignment to one category, which is pretty useless.
OK, I could force one row and have a column for each category, but then 
I set a hard limit on the maximum number of categories. With my approach 
I can change the maximum number of categories in code without requiring 
a different table structure. I can't see how I could reasonably 
normalize that and keep the flexibility that I have now. What happens 
when I want 10 categories today and 20 tomorrow and I do not want to add 
more tables or change exisiting ones?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] seeking backup/support programmer
Message-ID: <4664CA08.6090302@omnistep.com>

I'm looking for someone who can do light programming work or backup 
support for me in the event of an emergency or for short vacations. Must 
be knowledgeable in php, html, css, javascript, mysql, linux/bsd, have 
plenty of practical experience and be quick to pick up on existing 
projects. I'm not looking to employ someone full or part time, but to 
work out some sort of reciprocal agreement with another qualified 
independent contractor that may be in the same position as me (managing 
5-6 dozen clients, most of them in a situation where they are 
self-sufficient but occasionally need small changes or updates). If you 
happen to be flooded with work, I may be able to take on some of the 
simpler stuff and vice versa. It's always good to have one or more 
backups to care for your clients in case you fall into a snake pit, are 
hit by a truck, or encounter some other unforeseen circumstances. I 
don't have a specific compensation structure in mind, but we can work it 
out. If you are located in the NY/NJ/PA area and fit the above 
description feel free to drop me an email.
I know this probably belongs on the "jobs" list, but all the competent 
people are subscribed to this group and the last thing I need is more 
headhunter spam.

Thanks,
Rolan

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHPAuction Software
Message-ID: <005c01c7a834$578be460$6b01a8c0@gamebox>

Good Morning, 

Yesterday I purchased the GPL version of PHPAuction.

http://www.phpauction.net/gpl.php

After installing it I fixed a few small bugs that were preventing me from accessing different parts of the site.
Anyways, yeah, sucks right?

Unfortunately the script that enables a user to post an item to sell, is broke beyond anything I've ever seen.
My error log file was about 5 pages long for a single transaction (clicking the "submit" button).

And to top it of, their customer support is pretty awful:

Dear Ben,

Please could you ask to your hosting company to set E_ALL&~E_NOTICE in the directive of PHP 'error_reporting'.

error_reporting = E_ALL&~E_NOTICE;

This action will fix the problem.

At Phpauction we value our users and will be more than happy to assist you with all of your needs. If you have any further issues please do not hesitate to contact us.

With best regards,

Yeah bud, that will surely fix your code.


So, my question is, can anyone recommened some auction software. I'd really like it to be in PHP/MySQL but I will settle for PERL
or PostgresSQL. Save me!!

- Ben

Message-ID: <6.2.3.4.2.20070606112206.02878de8@mail.optonline.net>

A host I use recently upgraded to PHP 5.2.0, running on Apache 
1.3.37, and suddenly a perfectly functioning HTTP Basic 
Authentication is not working, presumably because PHP is no longer 
returning $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] and $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'], or 
at least not returning them correctly. They aren't very cooperative 
on fixing this. I don't see anything with phpinfo() that might give a 
clue as to what is happening.  Can anyone suggest something?

Hi all,

While some may think PHP is a toy, there may be some merit to that now.

In cooperation with Vincent Pontier, the PHP elephant designer, Damien Seguy
has developed a plush toy.

Details are at the end of this message.  It depends on how many we order,
but we're looking at a price of about $10 USD.

If you're interested, please contact me offlist and I'll help coordinate
with Damien.

Please respond by June 10th.

Regards,

H

Hello Everyone,
 
I am trying to create a page where users can upload images to the server via
a form.  I wanted to offer 5 input fields and an option that says "click +
to add another image", to allow the user to upload as many images as they
want.  Does anyone know how I can achieve this?
 
Thank you in advance for your help.

You don't actually need to use ajax and talk to the server, just some  
javascript DOM code to insert another input field.

Message-ID: <022801c7a89c$fe025a00$6b01a8c0@gamebox>

Hello, 

This is more of a JS question, but I'm going to ask it anyways.

I just got the book, "Pro Javascript Techniques" (Apress) and what sucks is that many of
the examples do not work.

What I want to do is have to input boxes, a username and password.
Instead of having labels next to them such as:

Username: [INPUT BOX]
Password: [INPUT BOX]

I want to have the text inside the box [INPUT BOX: Username]. etc...

When the user mouses over, I want to make that "Username" text dissapear so they can type their username in.

Any help?

I usually do something like the following to clear the value.  Keep in mind
that when the type is set to password your text will always display masked.

 

DiRN

 

<input onfocus="clearText (this);" />

 

<script type="text/javascript">

  function clearText (el) {

    if (el.defaultValue == el.value) el.value = "";

  }

  Subject: [nycphp-talk] Removing Text from an Input Box


  Hello, 

  This is more of a JS question, but I'm going to ask it anyways.

  I just got the book, "Pro Javascript Techniques" (Apress) and what sucks is that many of
  the examples do not work.

  What I want to do is have to input boxes, a username and password.
  Instead of having labels next to them such as:

  Username: [INPUT BOX]
  Password: [INPUT BOX]

  I want to have the text inside the box [INPUT BOX: Username]. etc...

  When the user mouses over, I want to make that "Username" text dissapear so they can type their username in.

  Any help?

I think this will work in some browsers, but not all.  I believe to
accomplish this in IE you'd have to completely replace the <input
type="text" . /> with <input type="password" . />.

Yes it is possible to change a field type to text and then back to password
in Firefox, but you'll get errors from IE and opera.  They don't like the
idea of changing form field types.

The way I've gotten around this is by creating an new field (innerHtml),
using the old field's values, and then replacing the old field.  It's a lot
easier than it sounds using a framwork's insertion methods
(prototype::Insertion.Before), though shouldn't terribly difficult using
straight javascript.

Andy's two functions cover it all, just make a third function that sets type. Although I'm not sure if changing the fields type will reveal the characters or not, it should.

Or if you don't know how to get around with AJAX or such, have the users 
upload the image files as a zip archive. Depenging on which images you 
want to allow, adding a few .bmp files may quickly fill up the submit 
buffer of the server and / or PHP.
I finished just last week such an uploader and I must say, I am still 
impressed on how quickly I could jam 800 images into the system (in 
chunks of 100 due to server upload limits). In all fairness, I did this 
while being local to the server, but anything else would be upload time 
which depends on client-server connection. I did add a URL load option 
as well, so that one could upload the archive first via FTP to the web 
server and then have the server download it from itself or a different 
FTP or web server assuming the connection between the two servers is 
significantly faster than from the client to the target server. I also 
made it so that users can have the image files in any amount of subfolders.

Or you could do that with PHP and by using a script that calls itself. 
But I really don't recommend this as this requires not only an entire 
page reload each time, but mandates the full submission of the form each 
round - with the already specified image files. This is the dumb stuff I 
did three years ago when starting with PHP. Don't do it, that approach 
sucks. Besides that, since HTML has such a crappy file upload control 
you will get into other trouble for sure.


I couldn't have done my 'turboloader' without the help from the great 
NYPHP folks. So, any way you go, you will find help here.

<input value="Display Value" onfocus="clearText (this);" /> is a bit more
complete.

 

Or <input value="Display Value" onfocus="clearText (this);"
onblur="restoreText (this);" /> can replace empty values with your label.

 

<script type="text/javascript">

    if (el.defaultValue == el.value) el.value = "";

Hello, 

 

This is more of a JS question, but I'm going to ask it anyways.

 

I just got the book, "Pro Javascript Techniques" (Apress) and what sucks is
that many of

the examples do not work.

 

What I want to do is have to input boxes, a username and password.

Instead of having labels next to them such as:

 

Username: [INPUT BOX]

Password: [INPUT BOX]

 

I want to have the text inside the box [INPUT BOX: Username]. etc...

 

When the user mouses over, I want to make that "Username" text dissapear so
they can type their username in.

 

Any help?

Something along these lines should work.

'password');" />
</div>

function swapOut (container_id, field_name) {

Yes it is possible to change a field type to text and then back to password
in Firefox, but you'll get errors from IE and opera.  They don't like the
idea of changing form field types.

The way I've gotten around this is by creating an new field (innerHtml),
using the old field's values, and then replacing the old field.  It's a lot
easier than it sounds using a framwork's insertion methods
(prototype::Insertion.Before), though shouldn't terribly difficult using
straight javascript.

Don't have the German TV station WDR catch them, they came up with a 
blue elephant in the 70s for their "Sendung mit der Maus" (Mouse Show). 
The mouse is very 70ish styled in orange and brown.
They have some spots online here
http://www.wdrmaus.de/lachgeschichten/mausspots/index.phtml

It's a show for children, they have the cartoons and always explain how 
something works or is done. Their explanation of the WWW is a classic.

I'm not clear on whether you actually want the typed passwords to be 
visible as plaintext or hidden as asterisk/dots.
Regardless, below is a css+javascript solution which hides the password 
field underneath until you mouseover. I feel so filthy for doing it like 
this, but there are times when painting over the page with CSS is the 
only way to accomplish the objective. One of my clients has a cafe press 
store and they didn't want the cafepress logo to be visible on the page. 
Cafe press doesn't let you disable the logo, but with little bit of 
dirty css ... voila!

http://www.cafepress.com/doyourememberus/2478464

The logo is gone. In reality it's hidden behind the blue circle at the 
top left.

And now for the example:

<html>
<head>
<style type="text/css">
#TOP {
    position: absolute;
    left:300px;
    top:10px;
    width:100px;
    height:30px;
    z-index:1;
}
#BOTTOM {
    position: absolute;
    left:300px;
    top:10px;
    width:100px;
    height:30px;
    z-index:0;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="TOP"><input type="text" name="junk" value="Password:" size=20 
onMouseover="document.getElementById('TOP').style.visibility='hidden';"></div>
<div id="BOTTOM"><input type="password" value="" size=20></div>
</body>
</html>

Hello Rolan,

Well, ideally, yes, but people can identify well enought with
a Textbox stating: Username and one beneath it stating: *******.

If they can't figure that out, they don't deserve accesss to the app.

Thanks for the code, I'll take a look. That's a neat little trick!

I had to do something similar for a recent project.  My clients asked for a
'show' link instead of an onFocus.  Also had cross-browser considerations.
(for noscript, could use js to hide labels)  defaultValue is very nice, and
I'm glad to have learned it (thanks Andy).  Unfortunately changing the
defaultValue changed the value.  In order to replace the old password field
with a new text field, you have to set the new field's defaultValue to
'Password', which makes the value of the field 'Password', which means you
lose whatever the user may have typed in.  So, you'll notice I use
_defaultValue (my own) to tell the script which value to replace if it sees
it.

Also note, when using defaultValue, if you load the page with the user's
info already filled in (a likely scenario for an account management page),
the defaultValue will no longer be 'Username', which might be what you want
(a clear field regardless of what they're typing), but would probably be
unexpected.  Of course in the account management context, not having labels
on fields is a bit less user-friendly, but that's off-topic.  

getTarget is just from my standard toolbox, and replaceElement is from
prototype (and a bit of research as to how prototype's methods work).
Everything that's in the head would probably be in a separate file and the
stuff at the bottom probably in a window.onload (even better
http://tetlaw.id.au/view/javascript/fastinit)

Here's what I have:

<html>
	<head>		
		<script language="javascript">			
			var getTarget = function (element) {
			    if (window.event !== undefined) {
					return window.event.srcElement;
				}

				return element.target;
			};
			
			// from prototype - mixture of
Element.Methods.replace and Insertion.Before
			var replaceElement = function(oElement, sHtml) {
				sId = oElement.id;
				
				if (oElement.outerHTML) {
					oElement.outerHTML = sHtml;
				} else {
					var range =
oElement.ownerDocument.createRange();
					range.setStartBefore(oElement);
	
oElement.parentNode.replaceChild(range.createContextualFragment(sHtml),
oElement);
				}
				
				return document.getElementById(sId);
			};
			
			var setType = function(id, sType) {
				var oField = document.getElementById(id);
				return replaceElement(oField, '<input
type="' + sType + '" name="' + oField.name + '" id="' + oField.id + '"
value="' + oField.value + '" />');
			};
			
			var clearField = function(action) {
				oField = getTarget(action);
				
				if (oField.value == oField._defaultValue) {
					oField.value = '';
				}
			};
			
			var defaultField = function(action) {
				oField = getTarget(action);
				
				if (oField.value == '') {
					oField.value = oField._defaultValue;
				}
			};
			
			var initField = function(id, defaultValue) {
				var oField = document.getElementById(id);
				
				oField._defaultValue = defaultValue;
				oField.onfocus 		 = clearField;
				oField.onblur  		 = defaultField;
			};
			
			var showPassword = function(action) {

				var oLink = getTarget(action);
				oLink.onclick = hidePassword;
				oLink.innerHTML = 'hide';
						
				setType('field_password' , 'text');
				initField('field_password', 'Password');
				
				return false;
			};
			
			var hidePassword = function(action) {

				var oLink = getTarget(action);
				oLink.onclick = showPassword;
				oLink.innerHTML = 'show';
				
				setType('field_password', 'password');
				initField('field_password', 'Password');
				
				return false;
			};
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<input type="text" name="username" id="field_username"
value="enobrev" />
		<input type="password" name="password" id="field_password"
value="enobrev" />
		<a href="show" id="showPass">show</a>
			
		<script language="javascript">		
			initField('field_username', 'Username');
			initField('field_password', 'Password');
			
			document.getElementById('showPass').onclick =
showPassword;
		</script>
	</body>
</html>


Anyways, good luck, hope this helps anyone who needs it.

(also, not sure if you know, but nyphp has a front-end list for js questions
as well - http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/front-end).

In France, (and Germany, etc?) the elephant has been a mascot for PHP
for a while (since about '98).

Hello, 

I believe you need to set the following:

    $emailObject   = new PHPMailer( );
    $emailObject->SetLanguage('en', "${OOP_INC_PATH}/language/");

Where $OOP_INC_PATH is the path to your PHPMAILER directory and the language directory.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] POSTDATA and back/resubmit revisited
Message-ID: <C292E464.4F76%cliff@pinestream.com>

Recently, there was a thread on pages expires, POSTDATA and the
back/resubmit button, etc. Chris Shiflett provided a link to a page expire
article. Yet the thread seems to die without fully addressing this issue.

Secret keys effectively prevent duplicate submissions, but don?t prevent
that geek-speak browser message. Header redirects seem to solve the
back/resubmit problem, but create duplicate processing on the server side
and generally add session overhead. For a successful form submission, the
?thanks redirect? probably need to grab data again. For a bad form
submission, the postdata probably needs to be stored in a session to be
echo?d back.

My question is, what is the best practice or industry standard practice, if
there is one, for handling POST form submissions while addressing the
back/resubmit issue?

Cliff

No ideas, but a suggestion. The Aptana IDE has a great help guide that
indicates what methods work with what browser versions. Worth a look.

Not exactly sure what you're doing onclick (which may or may not be
affecting this), but it sounds like Safari is getting confused by multiple
events.

Try capturing the form submission instead of the click:

<form action="#" method="get" onsubmit="return good(this)">

Whereas:

function good(form) {

    // do your stuff, but 'return true' to submit to action:
    return true;
}

I might be wrong, but these comments make me think you misinterpreted
the article.

1. Why is there any duplicate processing?

2. What is the basis of your concern regarding session overhead? You can
persist data in cookies, if it's really a concern.

3. What is a thanks redirect, and why must it grab data again?

4. If a form submission is deemed bad, you can opt to display the form
again with the errors noted, but the 302 redirect is the only way to
prevent the back / forward warning.

Might anyone know of a package which would be equivalent to Ruby's  
Hpricot gem?

http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/

libcurl-based would be ok.  So far doing it by hand but thinking  
maybe something else is available.  Thanks in advanced.

A Form submission would start by running the front-end controller, which
loads a whole lot of classes, checks authentication, establishes the DB
connection, inits sessions, sets up the template controller, and other
housekeeping chores.

The way I understand it, we would do all that, and then when the script
finally gets to the action related to the form submission, we would
redirect, which would go through that initial process all over again --
essentially scrapping that first pass of cycles. Am I missing something
here?

This probably dates back to a presentation at the Zend conference several
years ago given by Joyce from Renkoo regarding the evils of sessions. But I
use them, so what's another few fields. I've all but given up on minimizing
SQL hits. More session variables do mean more states to run amok though.

> 3. What is a thanks redirect, and why must it grab data again?
By this I meant the page following a form submission. Say the form did
something as simple as store a record in a DB. Now if we redirect, and want
to say, "hey thanks for submitting this data", we need to query the DB to
retrieve it. Without the redirect, we would innately have the data, since
we're still in the same script that processed the form.

Seems like I just have to model human behavior versus performance and do
what is most intuitive for the end-user.

This sounds like an argument against using a framework. :-)

Jesting aside, if you accept this overhead for every request, why would
it suddenly be unacceptable for a request to process a form?

You incur this overhead twice, but if adding a request / response
transaction noticeably degrades the performance of your web site, I
would speculate that your problems have little to nothing to do with
whether you use this particular technique.

She might have been speaking about scalability. As your userbase
increases, server-side session data stores become increasingly difficult
to scale, although solutions like memcache make this problem manageable
for lots of really popular sites.

An alternative is to use cookies as your session data store, but then
you have to incur extra processing overhead, because you need to take
steps to ensure that you can detect any attempt to tamper with the cookies.

> But I use them, so what's another few fields.

In that case, the overheard of fetching session data is an expense you
already incur.

You're already using sessions, so you can persist data for free.

By the way, since writing the article, this technique has been described
as a design pattern called PRG (POST, Request, GET).

Hope that helps.

True. A trivial script becomes a simple dispatcher becomes a front-end
controller becomes a Framework, becomes...before you know it...ASP.NET?!

Good point. I'm sure other bottlenecks will arise long before this.

Exactly. I've been designer for millions of users before I have even one.
Talk about putting the cart before the horse....

Makes sense -- its all starting to make sense, albeit slowly...

I don't recall where I saw it first described as such, but the Wikipedia
entry lists a few references:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get

The first one is pretty good:

After reading that theserververside.com entry, it seems like we've  
been doing this in Solar (framework for PHP5) for a little while  
now.  Essentially, after processing a form, you call $this- 
 >_redirectNoCache('controller/action') and you shouldn't get any re- 
POST troubles.

Boring code from the page-controller follows.

   <http://solarphp.com/svn/trunk/Solar/Controller/Page.php>

     /**
      *
      * Redirects to another page and action after disabling HTTP  
caching.
      *
      * The _redirect() method is often called after a successful POST
      * operation, to show a "success" or "edit" page. In such cases,  
clicking
      * clicking "back" or "reload" will generate a warning in the
      * browser allowing for a possible re-POST if the user clicks OK.
      * Typically this is not what you want.
      *
      * In those cases, use _redirectNoCache() to turn off HTTP  
caching, so
      * that the re-POST warning does not occur.
      *
      * This method sends the following headers before setting Location:
      *
      * {{code: php
      *     header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must- 
revalidate");
      *     header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
      *     header("Pragma: no-cache");
      * }}
      *
      * @param Solar_Uri_Action|string $spec The URI to redirect to.
      *
      * @param int|string $code The HTTP status code to redirect  
with; default
      * is '303 See Other'.
      *
      * @return void
      *
      */
     protected function _redirectNoCache($spec, $code = 303)
     {
         // reset cache-control
         $this->_response->setHeader(
             'Cache-Control',
             'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate'
         );

         // append cache-control
         $this->_response->setHeader(
             'Cache-Control',
             'post-check=0, pre-check=0',
             false
         );

         // reset pragma header
         $this->_response->setHeader('Pragma', 'no-cache');

         // continue with redirection
         return $this->_redirect($spec, $code);
     }

Hello Jeremy,

I'd suggest taking on a small project that interests you, and
have it contain some database or other types technologies
and programming challenges you don't have experiance with.

Since its something that interests you, I'd bet you'll have the
motivation to see it through. As questions arise, you can
consult google, books, or this list for answers.

Nothing is better for learning than doing.

You could also get involved with an open source project.

As far as classes, how about enrolling in some classes at a local college 
(I'm not sure
who offers php coding).

Then you know way more than I did when I first started with PHP. I 
recommend picking some project that you have some personal interest in. 
  My first project was a self-replicating script that parsed through the 
current directory and dynamically created links to image and flash video 
files (used Jeoren Wijering's Flash Video player). It copied itself into 
any lower level directory and created a link in the dynamically 
generated page if the file existed. The names and descriptions for the 
images and videos came from an INI style text file. That script was 
always pretty shaky and by now it entirely stopped working.
My next project was writing a database backend and some additional code 
for wrapping Jeroen Wijering's Flash MP3 player into a script that 
allows me to search through my MP3s, create an XML playlist, and then 
play the list using the flash based player. Although the script still 
works, I am ebarrassed by the code. It is full of flaws that just don't 
come to play because of my setup and use.
I then got a big break and was allowed to create a bug tracking / CRM 
application for work. Although it never was used, it served me well for 
learning. Next came a new script for pics from my digital and video 
camera. I added a quite complex search function, and stored everything 
except for the files of course in a database. My goal was that I do not 
need to process anything about the pictures, such as renaming or 
rotating some of them. It was quite a challange to dive into exif, 
arrays, GD, more SQL, more queries, and other nifty stuff.

My best resources were the O'Reilly XHTML book (I doubt you need it), 
W3Schools SQL course (you can do quite a bit with very primitive select, 
insert, and update queries), php.net (be cautious of the user 
contributions, some of them send you down the wrong path), anything that 
Google barfed up and above all, no, wayyyyyy above all the folks here on 
the NYPHP list.

I have no training in web or GUI design (and that shows unfortunately), 
I have no training in programming, and until I came across PHP 
absolutely hated coding. I did work for over six years as software 
tester, supporter, and tech writer in a software engineering team, which 
did help quite a bit.

In any case, if I can do it, you can for sure! Just pick something, get 
a very good idea of what you want the script to do in the end, and then 
just go at it.

When you are looking for a good IDE that doesn't cost a thing, ask the 
nice folks at Waterproof.fr if you can have a personal license. Their 
IDE is really nice, but the debugger implementation isn't so hot. Same 
applies for all the others except for NuSphere. And don't even bother 
with the Zend IDE. Their app just doesn't make any sense.

There are a few ways to do it...

For simple GET requests the easiest is to use file functions that  
support the HTTP protocol, like fopen() or file(). (The php.ini  
setting allow_url_fopen must be enabled for this to work). EX:

$responseLines = file('http://google.com/');

more details: http://us.php.net/manual/en/features.remote-files.php

For POST request you'll need to use either the curl, or socket  
functions.

http://us.php.net/manual/en/ref.curl.php
http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php

PEAR also has an HTTP_Request package. This uses the socket functions  
internally, but is much simpler to work with.

http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request

Hope this helps.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Form PRG revisited -- again
Message-ID: <C294796F.5050%cliff@pinestream.com>

I have been testing the Form PRG pattern, and really like the way it acts on
the user side. The back button and resubmit/reload button behave so much
nicer, versus those ugly POSTDATA messages. But it is a bear to implement,
unless I?m missing something as usual.

Paul Jones showed how the Solar Framwork supports redirectNoCache function.
But this is just a small part of the equation. For a redirect after a
successful form submission, its a no-brainer ? clean and simple. The problem
is forms with errors. These forms need to be presented to the user again,
with all relevant data and error messages ? inline and otherwise.

To me, this means the following:
1. Process the form via post for the first pass
2. Redirect to display form again via get with data and error msgs. This
means not just presenting the form again, but also the previously form data,
and all error messages, which means processing/validating the form to catch
the error messages, but not redirecting this time round.

This is a major pain.  Every form controller/action needs to be tweaked.

Am I reinventing the wheel here? Time to switch to ASP or Java?!

I see several options:
1. Skip the PRG pattern. Let users struggle with the back/resubmit buttons.
2. Go for the low-hanging fruit ? redirect only after successful form
submissions 
3. Use AJAX to ?pre-validate? a form prior to submission
4. Make a global PRG function at the start of the controller like so....

if form post submission
   save post variables in session
   redirect to same URL (add post/timestamp tag or some other identifier if
necessary?)
elseif (isset(post/timetamp/identifier tag) && that tag  passes some
validation step)
    get saved post variable from session and repopulate $_POST array
    clear post variables from session
    continue on our merry way as if this were a post submission
         (but how do our controller/actions detect get versus post
submissions ? looking for a post variable or some http field?)
else
    clear post variables from session, if any

What do you think? Seems to make sense. This essentially turns every post
into a get. To the forms, it should be transparent ? right? We could still
redirect for results pages when desired on a case-by-case basis so that the
reload button displays the results again instead of the original form. And
we do this as close to the top the script as possible, right after session
initiation, to reduce unnecessary server load.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ucfirst question
Message-ID: <466F337B.8060803@gmx.net>

Hi!

Being a ucfirst issue, I want to capitalize the first letter in a 
string. What caught my attention is this sentence in the PHP 
documentation: "Note that 'alphabetic' is determined by the current 
locale. For instance, in the default "C" locale characters such as 
umlaut-a (?) will not be converted."

Well, that is what potentially might happen. Is there a less language 
discriminatory version of ucfirst or do I need to snip off the first 
character and check it against ?,?, and ? to make them ?, ?, and ?? That 
will take care of German, but what about other languages?

The locale of my system is US-English, but the script could run on other 
locales as well. Is there any way to switch the locale on the fly? Even 
if, I'd neet to noodle the string through ucfirst through all quite a 
bunch of locales.

This is "bupid" how my 2 year old would put it.

By default programs (and thus PHP scripts) run in the C locale. If you
call setlocale(LC_CTYPE, ""); this will switch to the locale specified
in the environment usually throught the LANG variable. So you can test
this by running your script like:

$ LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 ./myscript.php

> This is "bupid" how my 2 year old would put it.

Much of PHP is derived from the the C language standards. Because C is a
machine language abstraction, it is deliberately coarse about things that
different systems may or may not support (e.g. i18n). This is contrary to
the top-down method of designing more modern and user friendly scripting
languages but it provides somewhat of a guarantee that there will be
no holes in the API since C is the common denominator of programming
languages.

I am recommending, as best as you can lookup and use only coding
examples that program with classes. Don't avoid it, go straight to it.
Learn everything in context of classes, your potential hourly rate 9
months from now will ikely be 33% higher than what you might get without
class knowledge. And my impression is that there is not a job posting
anymore that doesn't call for classes. 

A young turk should know the new stuff. Learn only the newest version of
everything software, meaning e.g. PHP 6 and 5 over version 4.x. Never
bother to learn old versions. By the time you get competitive nobody is
gonna care that you know old versions of software. 

Use multi-page tutorials on the internet that show how to build a login
section or make a basic mailer app. When you look these up with google,
you might try to use the advanced search filter by date feature and stay
with things posted within the last year to stay out of old ideas and
techniques since marked as bad paractice.

Get a book that shows several rudimetary projects done with classes and
step by step coding. 

Look up all you function related questions on php.net. Often if you look
at related functions you will find user contributions that answer your
needs too. Ultimately, php.net usually answers everything. You'll find a
lot of other answer sites source from php.net anyway.

And, of course, yes, this list is pedigree for answers. Contibutors are
awake all over the world 24 hrs, 7 days with answers often showing up
within an hour. And if you cloak all questions as somehow related to a
PHP issue, you can get excellent answers to RegExp, SQL, XML, AJAX and
even CSS from people who a clearly expert. 

Meanwhile, like Jim Cramer be prepared for drinking some cheap dark
Scotch by yourself down on the cold linoleum floor.

the classes at nyphp seem really good, but i'm a little hesitant to  
enroll in an intensive 2-day thing. would prefer something evenings,  
drawn out over a few weeks. gives more time to let things sink in and  
come up with questions. does anyone have any recommendations?

as far as background, i've been doing front end development (hand  
coding html) for many years so i know my way around a text-editor and  
understand a lot of the basic principles of php but i have never  
attempted a php project on my own and am pretty hazy with anything  
concerning databases.

Being somewhat in the same boat as Jeremy, I'd be interested in any 
recommendations for books tthat show usage of classes. Unlike objects, I 
have no idea what classes can do and are there for, although I haven't 
really used either (I used a few objects, such as the zip object).

I'm looking at a quite large project that I am likely to be allowed to 
do at work. I am convinced that I can accomplish it with the knowledge I 
have now, but why not take that opportunity and learn something new.

I have a 2-part series of very nice books published in 2003 by
Sitepoint.

Labeled as "PHP 5 Ready" and entitled: 
"The PHP Anthology - Object Oriented PHP Solutions, Vols I and II"

File handling, images, email, error handling and more; every project
executed step by step with classes only. I am not vouchsafing that these
examples are secure or the utlimate in best practice (that you must
explore on your own), but certainly a good starting point and I have not
found anything else that took you right into classes explaining
precisely by simple example without 250+ pages of abstract explanantion
(though in the long run you will absolutley positively definitely need
one such full-on abstract tome also). 

I have found in my own experience (in VB, VBScript, ASP, PHP, XML, SQL,
JavaScript, etc.), that every time you learn something and the author
hints that technically there is actually a more obscure, more difficult
to comprehend and harder to execute, more exacting technique that
handles more exceptions and degrades gracefully -- that the moment you
get invovled in even the most trivial commercial project you will
instantly discover that you absolutley must employ that more arcane,
more difficult programming technique to successfully handle even the
most minor task before you. 

That is why ultimately you will absolutely need an abstract learning
tome under your belt too.

The number one muck up I have observed in coding, is programmers
creating functions or tools that leave off the final "else" clause at
the 
end of a conditional logic tree. That is, programming logic error
examples, such as:  

You expect users to weigh platinum by the pound;  
someone will try to weigh chicken necks by the ounce.

You expect users to pay in Dollars, Punds, Yen, Franc, Lire and Marks;  
someone will try to pay in Real.

You expect users to pick a State;  
they live in Canada and need Provinces. 

You expect 5-digit numerical Zip;  
UK users have 6-char alpha/numeric mixed.

You execute a cart in English, Japanese and Spanish;  
a user is visually impaired and speaks native Dutch. 

You build online tech support live chat 8AM-8PM EST;  
only to find 23% of users log in from Eastern Europe in off hours. 


Every function you write, every tool you develop has to be prepared to
accept and deal with wrong information or input out of your expected
bounds. 

Incomplete function logic tree I have seen many times: 

if 
  dollars do this 
elseif
  yen do this 
elseif
  marks do this 
else 
  pounds do this
end if 

When tighter functions and logic need to be fashioned like so: 

if 
  dollars do this 
elseif
  yen do this 
elseif
  marks do this 
elseif 
  pounds do this
else  
  unknown currency raise user error flag
end if 

This one precuationary step alone will CYA so many times you may appear
teflon.

offering a class at the moment and it's halfway over. i think i'm  
gonna go for it with the 2-day designers class at nyphp next week.  
after i'll have the o'reiley book and i've got a few things to sink  
my teeth into to put it into practice - namely some customizations to  
zencart for a client of mine (anyone around these parts have much  
experience with it?).

Thank you very much for the hints. I am more interested in improving the 
maintainability of my code. I often do not anticipate what I might want 
to do and when I add functionality I often find myself creating code 
that is only slightly different from existing code. I sometimes manage 
to simplify and externalize into functions that can be included when 
needed, but something tells me that there might be a better way.

I am not engaging in commercial projects and don't plan to do so. I have 
no formal software development background and do this for fun. Shouldn't 
stop me from learning new things and doing it 'right', whatever that is.
I used to be scared by arrays and $_SESSION, now I use them all the 
time. C'mon, classes can't be that tricky.

True! Bit me in the behind before where I was staring at a blank page in 
the browser not knowing why.

Or in general, uses metric. "23" can be anything and if not made clear 
it might as well drill your multimillion $ space probe straight into 
Mars. Honestly, Americans with their "English" system don't deserve 
better. ;)

See above, depends on which Franc you are talking about. And even worse, 
French Franc, Italian Lira, and German Marks don't exist anymore.

I dove into this some time ago and there are about a dozen standardized 
means of writing an address. I think I have that code somewhere to 
handle this. That covers at least the majority of cases, but for sure 
not all.

Or is German and has an attidue like Simon Cowell.

Or use switch, case, and default, which supposedly is the better 
approach since the Logo days.

    Long if-then-else ladders are an antipattern.  After a while,  they 
usually end up like this list:

http://www.multicians.org/thvv/borges-animals.html

    In some cases,  switch/case is better:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.switch.php

    Other good patterns are 'guarded method/subroutine'

function a_good_subroutine($x) {
    if (invalid_input($x)) {
       return;
    }

    ... do something ...
}


    and the patterns of 'computed subroutine name',  'computed method 
name',  'computed object name' and 'computed file name';  ie.

if (invalid_type($data_type)) {
    throw new Exception("...");
}

require "something-doers/do-something-to-{$data_type}";

Message-ID: <6.2.3.4.2.20070613212541.0287a138@mail.optonline.net>

Here is a baffling problem that piggybacks in a sense on recent
discussions about form handling.  The situation is this:

I have a form which submits to a processor script. The processor
writes the post variables into the session and checks for correctness.
If there is a problem, it redirects to the form which is preloaded
from the session, and we start over again. If there is no problem, the
processor redirects to a thanks page which pulls the submitted
information out of the session and sends it via email and says
"thanks" to the submitter.

This works perfectly for everybody except two out of about 400 people.
Unfortunately one of those two is an officer of the organization.

I have determined that, even for these two people, the processor does
indeed receive the post variables and does indeed write them into the
session. But (for those two people, and only for them) when we get to
the thanks page, the session information is somehow lost in the course
of the redirection, and so the email is sent with blank information.

The two people for whom this is happening are both on Macs, and both
experience the problem with both Safari and Firefox. Other Mac users
with either browser have no problem.

Can anyone imagine or suggest what might be happening here?

They may have cookies disabled .
If you're doing a javascript "onLoad" redirect or using http headers 
(ie. header("Location:http://www.yoursite.com")  the redirect may not be 
passing the session id onward.
It might be ugly, but to be safe, include the "session id" in the 
redirect url (eg, 
http://www.yoursite.com/formpage.php?SID=2932398f2398hf23983f )

The only thing that I can think of is that their browsers don't accept 
cookies of any kind and silently block them. Unless I am totally 
mistaken, the session relies on the session id to be available from a 
cookie.


More a guess than a definitive answer.

The only suggestion I can think of is to explicitly call  
session_commit() or session_write_close() just before the redirect.

   <http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.session-commit.php>
   <http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.session-write-close.php>

This will force the session values to be stored before the redirect.   
(Other comments on the session_write_close() page may be of use to  
you here.)

Based on the subject line alone, my guess is that you're sending a
malformed Location header. Can you show us that specific line?

Hey David,

A couple quick things I thought I'd point out:

On Jun 13, 2007, at 11:09 AM, David Krings wrote:

Classes are actually the way that you define objects.  So they're  
really the same thing and you'll often see the terms used  
interchangeably.  So somewhere out there (in this case, probably  
written in C and compiled into the zip extension), there is a class  
that defines the zip objects you've been using.  Here's a quick example:

class ZipArchive
{
   protected $file;

   public function open($filename)
   {
     echo "code to handle reading $file would go here";
     return true;
   }

   // etc...
}

So that's the class... but as soon as you do this:

$zip = new ZipArchive();
$zip->open('somefile.zip');

$zip is an object.  Does that make sense?  I'm sure the books will  
lay it all out, but just thought I'd clarify the class vs. object thing.

This process of simplifying and combining code to be reusable is  
called "refactoring" and it's one of the best skills a developer can  
possess.  Googling "refactoring php" will bring up a few articles.  I  
also saw that the June 2006 issue of php|a has an article on  
refactoring your procedural code (functions) into object-oriented  
code (classes/objects).  I haven't read it though so I can't comment  
on how good it is or easy to understand but here's a link to get it:

Later,

Are you using the default php session handler?  I was just reading a  
thread in Zend Framework discussion where they were suggesting that  
with a custom db session handler, it could be possible for a read of  
the session to happen (mainly in an ajax based app) before the  
previous request finished writing it.  That doesn't make sense though  
with how this would only ever happen to two specific users.  That  
definitely sounds like a browser/os issue.  Unless there is something  
specific about data for these users that causes it to not get written  
properly.  Is their entire session data cleared out?  Or only what  
was written by that form submission?

I actually was troubleshooting a session issue that I had with a user  
on one of our sites and it turned out that his OS time was set far  
enough in the future that it was causing the session cookie be  
immediately expired .  I could only reproduce that on IE/Windows  
though... Firefox seemed to figure it out.

I know this is the easy way out... but if you're writing the form  
data to a database, you could just read it from the database on the  
"Thanks" page instead.

The first thing I define when I create a control flow structure is the 
default condition. Set it up with the test and empty brackets, set the 
default action, and then go back to fill it in.

A strict default action can go a long way towards letting you code what you need now to make progress, while leaving the rest for later. I see too many coders take all day to try and accommodate everything when all we needed was A and B (for now). 

Code the default case. Protect against anything that is not what is expected for A and B, then code A and B and move on. 

Sure it will fail for tons of situations, but it will never let you down for A or B (and that is what I asked for ;-)

Thread is a few days old, but hopefully not moldy yet....

The pattern I use goes something like:

load request subject
define form (allowed values, expected types)
if POST, get form values from POST (validating/filtering on the way)
else get default form values from subject
if POST and no validation errors {
  use form values to update subject
  redirect 303 to subject view
}
render form (with any errors marked)

I hope that's clear enough. It's not a bear to implement, but it helps
to have a smart class for defining, validating, and rendering form
values. Pear's HTML Form was the model for mine.

I always think of unsuccessful posts as "falling through" the
validation logic, so the form can be shown again. The only thing that
breaks between successive unsuccessful form submissions is uploaded
files.

Just remember, its a balancing act between usability and security. By
including the session id in the URL, you are exposing it, allowing it to be
bookmarked, forwarded, etc. I'm sure Chris or Chris could provide far more
insight.

I'd still be interested in seeing where you set the Location header,
because it's possible you're not addressing the root cause of the problem.

Here it is; comments/criticism/suggestions welcome:

I knew that, but I wanted to be able to see it myself. SID is empty 
if cookies are working, so the header doesn't really need it for 
those people; and SID is set when cookies are disabled, so the header 
will have it for them.  But I felt a little more comfortable actually 
seeing it, especially during testing. I could also have used 
session_id() but you had gotten me started down the SID trail, so I 
stayed there ;-).

Interesting. This indicates that you are not doing a redirect to display
form errors, or are you? To eliminate the back/reload problem, shouldn't all
views be redirected after a post, whether a success or error?

I have a fairly smart form class, but drop out of it to cascade through
varying levels of validation beyond input checking...database queries,
password comparisons, product stock checks, DNA testing, political
affiliation, etc. It sounds like anything that can cause the form to be
redisplayed should be considered a form error and pulled into the form
validation routine -- probably best done with a callback. Right?

I still like the idea of saving a post to a session and immediately
redirecting. Its global is scope, which can be scary, and I haven't tested
it yet -- weekend project, but that's the beauty. Here's what I'm thinking
again, for those that fell asleep the first time:

// PRG FORM PATTERN AT TOP OF CONTROLLER
// ERROR CHECKNIG TO BE ADDED


if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] = 'post) {
    // Store post submission, then redirect
    $_SESSION['post'] = array('post' => $_POST,
                              'time' => now(),
                              'uri' => $_SERVER[' REQUEST_URI']);
   303 redirect to same URI
}

elseif ($_SESSION['post']['uri'] == $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] && now() <
$_SESSION['post']['time']+a few seconds) {
    // Retrieve post session using get method. Makes the assumption that
    // this get resulted from the redirect above. Why wouldn't it?
    $_POST[] = $_SESSION['post']['post'];
    unset($_SESSION['post']);
    // continue on our merry way as if this were a post submission
    // Everything should look like a post except $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']
} else {
   // Flush session post variables, if necessary
   unset($_SESSION['post']);
}

Thought process:
1. A rendered form with errors will drop through with only the first
redirect -- perfect
2. A success form will drop through with only the first redirect -- perfect
3. An existing form that already has a success redirect will drop through
with one extra redirect step -- not a big deal, unless its really prevalent.

I'm not sure that you have a back/reload problem. Since the POST
didn't actually change anything, it's more like a GET. The user can
hit reload as much as she wants, the form still won't be submitted.

In the case I mentioned where file upload is lost, I have found myself
taking advantage of the back button so that I can fix the values and
resubmit without having to browse for the file again.

In this case, submission isn't the issue. It's just that annoying message
that pop up when you use the reload button on a post. I bet 9 out of ten
people don't really know what it means.

This is a good case where the back button makes a lot of sense.

Actually, I like the fact that Reply goes to the list.  Usually if I'm 
replying I want it to go to the group, and it kind of seems like that's 
how a group should work: by default you send to the group, and sending 
off-list is a special case (which is why people actually specify 
"contact me off-list" if that's what they want).  It's really 
frustrating to post to a list and then find out it only went to the OP. 
  I hope nobody's trying to change this list to work like that.

+1.

All of the lists that I am on (except one) have the reply set to go  
to the list.  The one list that sends replies to the person who posts  
is annoying and (to me) does not seem to be a logical process.

I definitely feel that "Reply" should go to sender and "Reply To All"
to group as that seems to be the way it's _supposed_ to work, but I'm
a fan of replying to the group as a default as well.  I'm on lists
that work otherwise, and reply-to-group as a default seems to promote
conversation, which, it seems, is the point.

Considering our general place of business (the internet), if the world
used things as they were built, we'd all be out of a job and hence
wouldn't have very much to talk about here.

+1 as well. The worst solution is the MUG list I am on. The reply goes 
to a "no-reply" address. You think you posted and five hours later you 
get a bouncer back.

Hi Cliff,

I'm pretty sure this is a client/user preference issue.  You can turn it 
off in IE as a user, but from the server side, I think you're just stuck 
with it.  Best you can do is explain it to your users.

But I just tried logging into Hotmail using IE and SSL. After login, it
redirects to a non-secure page without the warning. So they figured out how
to get around the bug,

Could they be doing a double redirect? First redirect to a secure page,
which does an immediate client-side redirect to a non-secure page? Poking
around I've seen some proposed solutions the use the http header 400
response code and also a meta refresh tag.

I found an ASP fix: http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/switchprotocol.asp

Implement Tranz.aspx, which takes care of the script-block redirect:

<%@ Page Language="C#" Theme="" %>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<script runat="server">
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
   _to = Server.UrlDecode(Request.QueryString["to"]);
}
private string _to;
protected void js() {
   Response.Write("window.location.replace(\"" + _to + "\");");
}
</script>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" >
<head>
<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">
<!--
<% js(); %>
-->
</script>
<title></title></head><body></body>
</html>

Don't know what this does. Anyone have a PHP equivalent?

It looks like all the C# does is decode the URL of the page to which you
want to redirect.  The page then uses JavaScript (window.location.replace)
to actually handle the redirect.

You should be able to accomplish this with something like:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<?php
  $to = urldecode ($_GET ['to']);
?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" >
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
      <!--
        window.location.replace ("<?php echo $to; ?>");
      -->
    </script>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>

I found an ASP fix: http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/switchprotocol.asp

Implement Tranz.aspx, which takes care of the script-block redirect:

<%@ Page Language="C#" Theme="" %>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<script runat="server">
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
   _to = Server.UrlDecode(Request.QueryString["to"]);
}
private string _to;
protected void js() {
   Response.Write("window.location.replace(\"" + _to + "\");");
}
</script>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" >
<head>
<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">
<!--
<% js(); %>
-->
</script>
<title></title></head><body></body>
</html>

Don't know what this does. Anyone have a PHP equivalent?

Andy:

Awesome! Seems simple now that you "decoded" it. When I first saw the
foreign language, it looked like gibberish.

I finally analyzed the Yahoo login, and the above solution is very similar.
Here's how Yahoo does it -- very nice, multiple levels of fallback. The page
below is still https, so you don't get the IE https -> http warning.

<html>
<head>
<script language="JavaScript">
<!--
window.location.replace("http://finance.yahoo.com/");
// -->
</script>
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=http://finance.yahoo.com/">
</head>
<body>
If you are seeing this page, your browser settings prevent you
from automatically redirecting to a new URL.
<p>
Please <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">click here</a> to continue.
</body>
</html>

Well now that sends a pretty clear message about how much they value

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Sessions / Cookie question
Message-ID: <4674B039.9080903@qualityadvantages.com>

Hello and greetings,

I have an application I am working on and I have a question about 
session timeout and its relationship to the cookie that is set when the 
member logs into their account. The time out code drops the session and 
logs a timestamp in the database to indicate when the user was last 
logged in. That's all fine. The expectation is that if the member comes 
back after the time out, then they would be required to login again but 
the login code does a check for an active cookie and not a session and 
allows the user to access the site apparently creating a new session.

I hope this explanation is clear enough for someone to give me some 
ideas about how to go about solving this. As far as I can see, the 
session timeout code is only looking at a time stamp in the database to 
drop the session. How do I get it to reset the cookie at the same time. 
I was thinking that add a conditional to test for an active cookie on 
the login but that doesn't cover all the bases like if the member just 
went to their CP or some other feature directly. Most of the pages only 
require an active cookie for authorization.

Any Ideas greatly appreciated.

thanks, mikesz

If you're using sessions, there's no need for the cookie. If you must, 
try setting the timeout value of your cookie to the same amount as the 
timeout for the PHP sesssion id. Example: 

setcookie('somesessionid','MrX-a8g238goenrgarPassHash',time()+60*30);

The example above sets a cookie to expire after (current time + 60 
seconds * 30 minutes).
The cookie expires at the designated absolute time and may fail if the 
user has the time/date on their computer set incorrectly.

Hello All, 

Hope all the fathers are having a nice day today.

Lately, I've been really getting into the cost structure and finicial forces at work within my company.

While attempting to refine our overhead cost calculations, I've begun to break up jobs
by the time spent doing one of many tasks:

Information Architecture - Creating the database, flowcharting, high and low level details.
Graphic Design - Creating the actual graphics, .pngs, .gifs, etc.
User Interface Creation - Designing the UI and Wireframes.
Programming - Heads down coding.
Testing - Q/A
Deployment - Pushing the site live.
Support - After the site is live ... this is everying EXCEPT fixing bugs (we don't charge for that!).

I'm trying to find the "going-rates" for such activities. Is there a standard right now, 
or a place to find this information online.

Thanks.

- Ben

I've spent a lot of time at various agencies pricing, and I currently
run my own web testing and development company. I'd be happy to talk
to you about pricing and estimating timing and all that, if you'd
like.

Hello Josh,

That sounds good. I'm still curious if there is an online resource
that publishes technical disciplines and their going rates.

Feel free to contact me off list.

Aside from all the usual suspects like Dice, Monster and Craigslist
for searching for salary and rate info, I've always used
 www.salary.com
 www.realrates.com

Hello Greg,

Thanks: The data on salary.com is great ... I can see what the medium
salary is for said jobs.

Even better would be a site that lists the per/hour rate of said jobs.

Thanks again.

Hi Ben,

I think the "going rate" largely depends on where you're getting your talent from and where they are going to work from. People who live and/or work in NYC or the tri-state area are going to cost a little more than, say, someone like me who works and lives in the midwest. Since our cost of living and dowing business is substantially lower than many other parts of the country, our rates are going to be a lot lower too - and still be considered good by our, midwestern, standards. I think that's why there is a new focus on "insourcing" or "outsourcing within US borders but in lower cost areas".

So, if you're wanting to reduce costs, start by looking at where the generators of your primary costs are and see how you can reduce that. I can guarantee that you can get the same level of talent, the same level of performance, at much lower rates WITHOUT having to leave the USA.

Hope this helps,
Anthony

  Hello All, 

  Hope all the fathers are having a nice day today.

  Lately, I've been really getting into the cost structure and finicial forces at work within my company.

  While attempting to refine our overhead cost calculations, I've begun to break up jobs
  by the time spent doing one of many tasks:

  Information Architecture - Creating the database, flowcharting, high and low level details.
  Graphic Design - Creating the actual graphics, .pngs, .gifs, etc.
  User Interface Creation - Designing the UI and Wireframes.
  Programming - Heads down coding.
  Testing - Q/A
  Deployment - Pushing the site live.
  Support - After the site is live ... this is everying EXCEPT fixing bugs (we don't charge for that!).

  I'm trying to find the "going-rates" for such activities. Is there a standard right now, 
  or a place to find this information online.

  Thanks.

Message-ID: <4676A0BC.3090506@gmx.net>

Hi!

I want to do some housekeeping and wipe a bunch of folders of a drive 
that were not used in the past 24 hours. I get the current timestamp, 
subtract the seconds for a day, and then use fileatime of the folder to 
make a determination.
To my surprise, the fileatime appears to be always more recent than the 
timestamp from 24 hours ago, which means that none of the folders get 
whacked, although they are four of five days old.

Is it better to use filemtime? Or something totally different? The 
script will run exclusively against a file server running Windows, which 
probably makes a difference.

Any advice? I really don't want to track file access of my system in a

Can you provide a little more detail. 
How are you testing file time? 
What OS? 
Are you getting increasing times from the files with just the wrong time or
complete random values?

Annual Salary/2,000 = hourly rate

There are 52 weeks /yr
minus 2 weeks /yr vacation
= 50 weeks @ 40 hrs / week
= 2,000 hours / yr available for work

This is a rough estimation of the hourly *Cost*
E.g. for worker "John" 100K annual rate (~$50/hr)

Actual project estimation and costing can include a whole slew of
adjustments, but at least that gets you a quick idea.

I know you didn't ask about rate calculation, but I just wanted to add
a quick note about that because people new to the idea of consulting
can easily get trapped by bad assumptions.
As an example to how this is just a quick formula for cost comparison
and NOT a formula for calculating 'rates':  In consulting, I would
never charge $50/hr to earn $100K / year.  The available hours for
working aren't even close to 2,000 hours after you subtract a
reasonable number for holidays and sick days.  Subtract the amount of
time you expect to be learning, prospecting, marketing, administering
your business etc.  When you finally arrive at the amount of time you
will actually spend working billiable hours for a customer (in
whatever capacity: sales, dev, support), then you can figure out what
the hourly charge should be.  Often it is 3x what the nominal rate
would be ($150/hr to earn 100K).  Also billing is sometimes done on a
defined deliverable basis instead so that you can forget the clock.
E.g. bill $200 for an application version upgrade (with an unstated
but easily adhered to limit of 1hr because you know that the site
upgrade process is routine and repeatable.)

Anyway, i digress.

Just to throw out one additional tidbit... this is *only* considering
the actual dollar-cost of the person's salary but that's not the whole
picture.

Once you factor in Social Security (employer's half), health
insurance, workers comp, 401k contributions, office space, etc, you
can add anywhere from 20-33% to this number to represent the *cost* of
the employee to the employer.

The last time I was with the Feds and we were calculating FTE's, we
used +31.5% on top of base salary... so the above $50/hour should be
$66/hour to be a real FTE.

I tested this on XP and the reported times are always the same.


This is what I used to have as code:

// Clean up stale login data
// Make time stamp for 24 hours in the past
$timestamp = time() - 24 * 60 * 60;

// Read temp dir
if ($handle = 
opendir($_SESSION['filepathtoroot'].DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR."temp")) {
     while (false !== ($file = readdir($handle))) {
         if ($file != "." && $file != "..") {
             // Check file time of directory
             $filetime = 
fileatime($_SESSION['filepathtoroot'].DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR."temp".DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.$file);
             if ($filetime < $timestamp) $oldsessionids[] = $file;
         }
     }
     closedir($handle);
}


The problem was that opening the directory for read changes the access 
time of all subdirectories. I changed the code to use filemtime and that 
  appears to work better and gives sufficient accuracy for my needs. I 
now have to add some code at significant points where the script checks 
when the login occured so that I don't end up writing to a directory 
that some other login just deleted. That should be easy enough by 
checking against my login table and forcing everyone to login again when 
their login was more than 24 hours ago.

I may make this more lenient/configurable as I can see some value for 
allowing someone to hanng around in the system for more than 24 hours 
assuming that the session lives that long, which I doubt.

Does anyone know for how long session data is kept when idling?

Yes and in grant world (where proposals are written to get government 
contracts) each institution has an "indirect rate" pre-negotiated with 
the government. So before even applying for a contract, you negotiate 
the overhead that covers all those costs.

Last I heard Johns Hopkins was in the 70% range... meaning if they bid 
$100k as the cost for doing the work, they would get a check for $170k. 
A lesser institution may have negotiated a 40% indirect rate, so when 
they bid the same $100k to do the work they would actually get $140k.
 
You can probably see how the government tries to separately manage the 
larger issues of the cost of quality / credit history/ impact of 
regional economies from the actual costs of doing the work.

Hi!

Most of you work in the software industry and may have a good tip for an 
employment opportunity as Technical Writer. Ideally in the Capital 
Region of NY. I am also open to software support and software testing.

I wish I could do something with PHP, but my skills are so limited that 
I doubt anyone would even pay minimum wage for it.

Any further details to be discussed off-list.

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance.

A quick googling gave this among others: 
http://www.convert-in.com/acc2sql.htm

They sell the converter apparently for 25$, which is cheap enough to not 
even try anything manual. I do wonder about the "stored procedures" 
portion as this is the first time that I heard MS Access being capable 
of that.

I actually use that, which can be incredibly useful.  It keeps the keys and
does a create table/insert into for all the data;  I'm more interested in
retaining more of the fancier stuff like what MS calls 'forms' and
'queries'..

Last year I took our introduction to OOP (not called that, but that's what
it was), and they explained the difference between classes and objects quite
well.

Although some people consider them interchangeable terms, they're actually
different.

The analogy I like to use is that a class is like a blue print for a
building, and an object is a building that is created using that blue
print.  The class is a plan for how to make it, where as the object is the
result of that plan.

Hope that helps

Hello Everyone,
 
I wrote a script that allows users to upload up to 10 photo files to the
server.   The script automatically resizes the photos to the appropriate
size.  The upload and resizing scripts are working perfectly.  The problem
is that clients are uploading large photo files and it takes a long time to
upload them.

Is there a script or any way I can resize the pictures before uploading?

Thank you in advance.

Not via server side scripts. Even on the client side you most likely 
will need to open the file, process it, and then write a (temporary) 
file for upload.

I finished a similar script some time ago and I make the users ZIP the 
files together into one archive and upload that one. The ZIP file may 
still be large, but without having the user change the image dimension 
that is about as small as it will get.

There used to be (circ 2003) commercially-available Active-X controls
that would do this, but those require Internet Explorer or an extended
Firefox.

I thought you might be able to do it in Flash, but I don't think the
Flash player can actually re-encode the images.

Sometimes the best solution is to encourage users to use Picassa or
iPhoto to manage their photos, and then export the ones they want to
upload at some reasonable size.

Depending on what you are trying to do, I think its always best to  
keep the ~original~ photos intact ... there is a great script  
available here:

http://phpthumb.sourceforge.net/

Don't let the "thumb" fool you, its a pretty handy script that allows  
you to also resize + add filters (watermarks) and hash your URLs if  
need be.  Then in the view part of your code you basically state the  
size you want and it is cached out for you automatically.

I have put together an HTML form that uses Javascript which works well. However when I fill it in and fire it off to my PHP script (which for the purpose of testing simply echos what was entered in to the form) it cannot find the entered data; But when I strip out the Javascript and the fields that uses the javascript my PHP script happly echos back what was entered into the form. does anubody know what I am doing wrong??

Not without seeing what you're doing. If you don't want to post your  
original code, create an example that shows the same symptoms and post  
that code.

You are suffering from the split-brain syndrome of web development.  PHP as you know is a server-side while Javascript is client-side application.  The left side of the brain needs to communicate to the right side of the brain.  For the PHP to see the variables they must be posted to the server either as Form-Post variables or hidden-form-variables.  I've done this by invoking DOM to instantiate client-side objects (hidden-form-variables) and then posted the form via a submit (Javascript called).  

If I'm off base here sorry about that but I know that I've been stung by this a lot in my applications.

really hard to debug this without any code provided.  It could be 
numerous things...  Your javascript could be clearing your form data 
before submit?  How do you have the onEvent handles configured for your 
javascript?   Also, there could be things wrong with your server-side 
logic.  Do you have your echo statements wrapped in any logic that are 
dependent on the request variables?  Maybe your echo statements are 
skipped because something happened to one of the request values?  What 
type of echo statements are you using?  Have you tried doing 
print_r($_POST) or print_r($_REQUEST).  Gotta give us something more to 
run with on this one :)

I have to thank everybody for helping me and I do appreciate all the help I 
also take onboard that it is difficult to debug anything you cannot see. So 
I have included 3 files the HTML with JavaScript in, another HTML with the 
JavaScript stripped out and (I would not insult Mickey Mouse) a PHP test 
script to echo back what has been entered. albeit only the first field using 
"HELLO WORLD".

The objective of the JavaScript is to achieve word-processing style text 
wraparound upto to a max length (in this case 255 characters, being a nice 
round computer number and exceeding the maximum single text length of most 
peoples screens) all simply because HTML does appear to support text 
wraparound and maximum length (TEXTAREA MAXLENGTH). I have been told some it 
can and by others it cannot I have even been pointed to the 1x1 pixel trick 
which I don't really understand.

My goal is to talk clientside to serverside keep users focused instead of 
just truncating without their knowledge and by doing so keep them on my side 
and keep my i/o and processing down to a minimum thus avoiding things such 
as bottleneck and keep traffic flowing as smoothly as possible.

I just started working on a project that uses MS InfoPath forms to
capture all their data.

Does anybody here have any experience using PHP or some unix tool to
extract the forms and schema contained in an .msn file?

I saw two problems with the source containing the Javascript:
1) You have a line of dashes in the Javascript which don't seem to 
commented. The Firebug debugger throws an error on that line.

2) Your <form> tag is incorrect. You have commas between the 
attributes instead of spaces. Using the FF addon LiveHTTPheaders 
shows the form values passed by the GET method. Remove the commas and 
it should work fine. You don't have commas in the stripped version.

<form action="testreport.php" id="primary" method="post">

Hi,

I have two binary file name bunary1 & binary2. I need to compare these two

changed byte +  location +old value +new value

The files are opened in read binary mod and returns each byte. Can someone
suggest any method to compare bytes?

Thanks.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Encapsulating $_FILE, $_SERVER ... in objects?
Message-ID: <467D415C.8020905@gmail.com>

Hey!

I was wondering how you handle the data from $_FILE, $_SERVER etc. in 
your application. I mean, most of you probably use some framework that 
implements the request object pattern in combination with the 
intercepting filter pattern. So this makes unit testing easy and may 
also improve the security of your application. So how do you handle e.g. 
the data coming from $_FILE? Do yo just access them directly or is there 
also some super cool solution? :D

Cheers,
Jay

Honestly, I think that acessing them directly is already a supercool 
solution. Can't get any easier to get a file from A to B. I also 
wouldn't know what a framework could make easier in regards to that.
What is nice is to have consistent array values mainly from $_SERVER. 
Some time ago someone posted code for this as reply to a question that I 
asked. And that code did come from a framework and I think that is 
indeed super cool as it helps to get stuff working regardless of server 
and OS platform.
I must admit that I haven't work much with frameworks, but would use one 
mostly for the UI and database access so that I don't have to bother 
with layouts and going through the several steps for a select query.

In regards to security, input is evil, even when it comes from a table 
that only your app writes to. Always check for sanity and never trust 
anything, not even a file to be there that you just created a few lines 
earlier. I tend to get a bit paranoid in those cases where something 
being there really matters.

Just have a look at the manual:

filter_var

(PHP 5 >= 5.2.0, PECL filter:0.11.0)

So this function is only available since PHP 5.2.0 and you are using 
5.1.6 ... . I remember that I had a similar problem, because they 
renamed the function from filter_xxx to filter_var. However I can't 
remember the name of the old function.

Just type php -re filter on the command line to get the correct function 
name for 5.1.

cheers,
jay

I was actually asking for some design pattern making it easier to unit 
test my classes ;). I am probably going to implement just the same 
request pattern for $_FILE as for $_REQUEST.

A constant is a value that never changes, whereas a variable can change 
its value (which means that there cannot be something like a "constant 
variable" or a "variable constant", similar to a "variable datum", which 
is also an oxymoron).
A global variable is one that is available in any context (any script 
and any function even when not explicitly declared in that one).

Examples: the constant M_PI has the value of pi. No matter what you do, 
M_PI does not change its value. You can also use the function pi() to 
have the value of M_PI returned.

You can use the PHP keyword global to make any variable to have global 
scope. Some variables are global per definition and are called the 
superglobals, such as $_SERVER or $_SESSION.

Hope that helps,

	David

At this internet radio web site, when you arrive you enter the name of
an Artist that you like and they immediately create an internet radio
stream that only plays songs from the Artist you selected and other
similar Artists. And you can make as many custom streams as you would
like for all your differing tastes and moods. Now that is a pretty good
hit almost out of the park for a Web 2.0 style application,  I feel.

Anybody got any other nice web site apps like this that they can

It is a great site - but FYI this and most other net radio streams will 
go off the "air" on July 15th, thanks to the RIAA's dedication to 
preserving their monopoly on your eardrums.

Our request abstraction merges $_FILE array into the $_POST and  
$_REQUEST arrays before our regular code processing begins.  That  
allows us to set properties of our object via getPost() or getRequest 
() and then run the object's validate method (which calls various  
filters depending on the type of each field and any other custom  
validators that were set).

I'm not exactly sure how the popular frameworks handle it.  I just  
took at look at Zend Framework and Zend/Controller/Request/Http.php  
doesn't seem to have any mention of $_FILE which is odd.  I think I  
remember someone mentioning it on their list... could be fixed by  
now, I haven't updated in a few weeks.  I don't have CakePHP on my  
laptop right now...

Cheers,
Rob

In a similar vein, http://last.fm -- The super cool thing they do is  
called "audioscrobbling" where you can automatically send them info  
on what your listening to in iTunes or other music apps and it will  
store all of that info and use it to give you recommendations and  
other info.  You don't have to manually input anything.

I was going through Google and noticed for some companies, they have a
series of grouped links appearing under the main search result.  For
example: http://www.google.com/search?q=ioma , look at the 1st result for
Ioma.  They have 4 links plus a "more" link.  I thought this might be a
"subscribed" link, but I thought you had to subscribe in order to see the
additional subscribed links?

I would appreciate any insight as to how this is done.

These are being called "site links" and are intended to show the 
searcher how a site has clearly-defined user interest areas, to help 
them in their search.

It is believed that user click data is being used to help determine the 
need for site links, although some SEO people have been teasing Google 
this year and there are now some sites showing site links that probably 
shouldn't have them ;-)

Most people I know think site links are based mostly on site structure 
and back links.

If your site qualifies (searchers would benefit from site links as 
search navigation aids)  then a good SEO would probably guide you by 
suggesting that you:

- get inbound links from on-theme trusted sources TO your desired site 
link demarcation page, and make sure the page it titled and has H1/2 
tags that match the theme exactly. e.g. get job sites to link back to 
/human-resources/index.html and make sure that page is titled "human 
resources" and has a h1/h2 set to match that specific theme.
- make sure the site nav goes to that same demarcation page using the 
same title/htag-matching anchor text
- add some internal text links to refer people to that same demarcation 
page with matching context words and anchor text (be your own best friend)

A more advanced SEO would probably suggest you mine your own traffic 
logs and find the pages that Google ranks for "human resources", 
"careers", "jobs" etc and add a section to those (in H tags) that tells 
visitors that if they are looking for human resources (link) for careers 
at mycompany (link) they should go to the human resources page (link).  
In cases where the destnation page for incoming Google referrals 
on-theme was not important, 301 redirect it to the human resources page.

Personally, I would do that last step first.

I hope that helps.

Thank you very much for such a complete reply.  I am going to have to give

this is a really cool way to show off all the features offered by a site.

Good luck, Mike. Just another edge to keep up with as technology 
advances. Site links do bring traffic, and they displace a half a 
centimeter or so of web page so the guys below you do suffer a bit for 
it ;-) I like them for the branding impression... if you search for a 
web design firm and see they have an SEO section and a "secure web 
hosting" .... you got branded ;-)

I'd pay serious attention to Google Universal Search, coming to browser 
screens everywhere this summer. Images show up in the first position of 
page 1 (up to 5 or 6 hyperlinked images in a raw sometimes) and they are 
very click-attractive. And by the way, there is currently no limit to 
ownership of multiple images in that row, so you can own them all ;-)

Videos are now showing up in-line, and playable inline as embedded 
videos. An embedded video knocks 3 or 4 competitors right off the "first 
page". Again, best for branding cause Google's keeping the traffic on 
the SERP page instead of passing it through to your site. Unless... and 
here comes that "advanced SEO" stuff again, you populate most of page 1 
with embedded videos that are neutral and thus leave only your own web 
page snippets visible on the page :-) as 'calls to action" after the 
videos get old. Theuser has no choice but to click on your link....

Hi there:

[FYI:  last.fm is not going off the air on July 15th.  As they put it  
[paraphrasing] "we don't want to punish our listeners because of the  
RIAA".]

Sort of on-topic:  last.fm is an example of a very well executed "web  
2.0" site, IMO.  Check out the tools they made for creating a custom  
list of your tracks to embed somewhere else (http://www.last.fm/tools/ 
charts/).  Very slick; I have been playing around with making my  
administrative tools totally visual in this way for clients who want  
a little more creative control over the look of their content.

Cheers,

Marc

Hi there:

I have an old site that has been online for ~7 years, and it is  
established, if a bit old and crusty.  It's a database-driven  
directory of products for the Mac, and it performs reasonably well in  
google's search results, and gets a fair amount of traffic.

This site was built before I even had a framework, so it's all  
cobbled together, and I'm just now finally building it out to what I  
always wanted it to be, while simultaneously moving it to my clean 
(er) framework. So, the question is this...

My URLs are all something like www.xyz.com/trigger/0/1/4.  I think at  
the time I just wanted them to be short.

Now that I'm rebuilding it, I have different needs, because the site  
will be structured a bit differently in order to list products for  
more platforms. I would like to have www.xyz.com/product/1234/ 
platform/567.  Still short, but makes more sense.

Thing is, the site does receive a great deal of its traffic from  
google, and who knows how many bazillion links there are pointing to  
various pieces of the site, so I need to implement an intelligent way  
to parse the old URLs into the new ones.

But that's not the hard part; the part I am worried about is losing  
the search weighting I've built up over the years.  I've read that  
google ignores 302 redirection codes and doesn't update its index, so  
I'm a bit at a loss as how to proceed.

Anyway, wondering if someone could give me advice or share a real- 
world example of what they have done in the past.

Cheers,

Marc Vose

You probably want to look into Apache mod_rewrite, if you are running  
Apache. It will do exactly what you are looking for.

The alternative is to put a php file in all of the "old" locations  
that is really just a single include line that loads the file from  
the new location you want to move to.

There is a script out there which will run through your 404 apache  
log + put it into mod_rewrite recipes automatically, if I can dig up  
will post but Im sure it might also be trivial to write.  I used this  
to clean up a switch over a few years back.

Hi
  I'm looking for mid level to senior level developers with LAMP experience for a long term project in Manhattan.
Sorry no telecommuting, onsite only.
Hourly rate is open.
This is a great opportunity to be part of a very talented team in a company which is dedicated in using cutting edge technologies.
   
  If you're interested or would like to learn more contact me at 
  mrutkowski at infotechnologiesinc.com or call 212-710-5534.
   
   
  
Qualified candidates should have a deep background in web software development and have architected and coded complex software systems for large-scale Internet sites.
Specific responsibilities include:
- Building and enhancing high-availability database systems based on open-source solutions including MySQL
- Architecting software solutions that are robust, scalable, and maintainable
- Supporting production by helping to troubleshoot software issues on the site
- Working in tandem with fellow engineers to define software architectures and technologies to be used
- Evaluate new technologies and implement development best practices.
  - 5-7 years of software development experience, including at least 5 years of web development experience
- Significant development experience in the LAMP environment
- Strong background in MySQL, including an understanding of replication, caching, hot backups, load balancing, redundancy, and partitioning
- Experience benchmarking, profiling, and identifying slow SQL queries
- Excellent communication skills with both technical and non-technical audiences  Experience developing in C++ or Java (for patches, performance extensions, and plug-ins), and Unix shell scripts
  In addition, the candidate will ideally have:
- Knowledge of the Sun Solaris operating system
- Familiarity with Oracle
- Programming experience with more esoteric and powerful languages for data manipulation (Ruby, Python, Haskell, Lisp, Erlang)
- Experience with profiling using tools like DTrace for Solaris or SystemTap/Valgrind for Linux

Hi Hans,
  For some reason the job list is not allowing me to  post on it ,I'm not sure why? And since this is a great opportunity that I'm sure a lot of members would want to know about ,I tried "conversations"
   
  Thanks,

Message-ID: <e065b8610706270938k524ebc35j16d6b88c00c679e7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All, this is my first post, so if this is in the wrong section
please let me know.

I'd like to know if anyone has developed a database schema for storing
the revision history for a plain text document by multiple users.
Basically, I'm talking about a wiki, but something much more simple.
Any suggestions on methods of organizing the information using SQL
(specifically MySQL) would be much appreciated.

Thanks!

I'd just keep individual copies of the text files in the file system and 
then use a db table to keep track of the file location and their 
chronological sequence using a UNIX time stamp. Can't think of any 
easier way to do it.

Subversion would be a good tool for your application.

Good luck, Mike. Just another edge to keep up with as technology 
advances. Site links do bring traffic, and they displace a half a 
centimeter or so of web page so the guys below you do suffer a bit for 
it ;-) I like them for the branding impression... if you search for a 
web design firm and see they have an SEO section and a "secure web 
hosting" .... you got branded ;-)

I'd pay serious attention to Google Universal Search, coming to browser 
screens everywhere this summer. Images show up in the first position of 
page 1 (up to 5 or 6 hyperlinked images in a raw sometimes) and they are

very click-attractive. And by the way, there is currently no limit to 
ownership of multiple images in that row, so you can own them all ;-)

Videos are now showing up in-line, and playable inline as embedded 
videos. An embedded video knocks 3 or 4 competitors right off the "first

page". Again, best for branding cause Google's keeping the traffic on 
the SERP page instead of passing it through to your site. Unless... and 
here comes that "advanced SEO" stuff again, you populate most of page 1 
with embedded videos that are neutral and thus leave only your own web 
page snippets visible on the page :-) as 'calls to action" after the 
videos get old. Theuser has no choice but to click on your link....

If you are using mod rewrite make sure you set the R=301, and don't forget
to pass along the query string if you need to.
RewriteRule ^oldurl$ /newurl [R=301,L]

Message-ID: <5EE44AB8-84AC-465D-9D05-2105C56F6153@gmail.com>

has anyone come across any worthwhile analysis of optional vs.  
mandatory account creation in shopping carts. i'm sure it varies by  
demographic, but i'm curious if the amount of customers you'd lose by  
making it mandatory is at all significant.

Appreciate thoughts on contact/help forms on a web site:

Options:
1. Directly send email to admins
2. Store form in database for online viewing by admins

Thoughts? Email is simplest ? the infrastructure is in place. But storing
the form in a database is more powerful. Allows analysis, history, logging,
response time measurements, multiple personnel to view the form, etc. Hummm,
think I just convinced myself DB is way to go.

Web contact form -- email or database?Hello, 

What's the budget? Like you said, email is quick and works.

DB is the better choice...but what does the budget permit?

If you don't have the money, convince them of why the DB is better.
Its  somehting that is an easy sell to my clients when we discuss forms.

Also, if you build it once, make it modular and easy to reuse ..that'll drop
the inplementation cost and allow you to deploy it in almost situation.

Yup, and if your sequence is:

1) store in db
2) generate and send emal

....then you can also resend emails.  It's always good to be able to 
redo something.

If it is just for a single document you can do it pretty easily with just
sql (mysql).

Make a document table and a version table.
The document table would have the shell of what a document was (title, etc).

The version table would have the document_id, content and the mod_date and
author_id.

To get a document just do a join on the most recent version. All the other
solutions would require support outside of the application, which could
cause scalability problems down the road.

I am by no means a database expert, but why would one want to store 
guaranteed to be static data in a table such as the content. That 
content will never ever change. I agree with all other parts of your 
proposal, but recommend to store only a file path to each version of the 
file to keep the static bloat as small as possible.
Since it is to be simple, I wouldn't bother with an author ID as this 
requires author account management, although it isn't that complex.
Another thing to think about is to have some sort of logging and allow 
the system to delete content. In that case you'd need a "Deleted" column 
that keeps track of what is marked as deleted and what not. Taking the 
rows out of the table will corrupt the logging, especially when dealing 
with author accounts, which also need a "Deleted" column in case one 
takes one author account out.
Anything more complicated than that is probably better done with a real 
version control system as proposed by others.

Just my 2? on top the ones I already put on the table. ;)

Another pretty cool option would be to use PECL's xdiff w/ the db  
content ...

Table it w/ created_at, updated_at, content

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.xdiff-string-diff.php

Haven't had a chance to check it out but would be able to show  
changes over time.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Questions to ask at a job interview?
Message-ID: <007401c7b97f$af7cdf10$6b01a8c0@gamebox>

Good Morning, 

In a few days, I will be sitting down with a perspective employee, 
and I'd like to get some feedback on good programming questions
or excercises I can have them work on.

At my last job, prior to becomming a fulltime consultant, I was asked
to create a login function, that checked the username and password
against a file.

I did well, and felt that was a decent test. It had IO, security, string
comparisions, fetching values from $_POST/$_GET ...
This test was in addition to source code I provided for libraries I had
written, and of course my resume.

Now, the position being filled is that of an entry level programmer.
I do not expect this person to be well trained in PHP/MySQL, 
but they must have a pretty strong understanding of programming
methodologies in general (they are a college grad - CIS).

So, again, what are some good metrics I can use to test these perspective employees?

Thank you!

- Ben

I can only offer my experience, which I hope will help some.

The best employees I've ever had for difficult or changing situations 
were those with general problem-solving skills.  In my two best cases, 
neither knew anything about the programming language we were using or 
the database when they were hired,but they quickly became invaluable and 
productive.  In both cases their resumes spoke of their basic 
intelligence and when I met them I like them, so I hired them (or begged 
the powers to be to hire them). 

As for questions, its good to have a formal test you ask them to take, 
but interviewing is an art you can only get good at with practice.  The 
usual advice applies, be yourself, ask questions about things that are 
important to you, and see how the person responds.  Also check with HR 
to find out what you are *not* allowed to ask, anything that could be 
construed to be a basis for discrimination like age.

If you like somebody and think they will work out, ask them to come back 
and invite in 2 or 3 of their potential coworkers and have a short 
brainstorming session on a problem you have at the moment.  See what 
they contribute.

I think this mostly depends on what you want the employee to do once he/she
is employed.  If the job is mostly OO class design, then ask candidates to
create a class to represent, say, a shopping cart, or a customer.  If the
job is mostly design, then create a boring HTML page and ask them to mark it
up for proper application of CSS, or design on paper (without any code) a
user interface for some part of your overall project.

That being said, if I were in your shoes, I would try to gauge the
candidate's level of understanding regarding certain key areas (inheritance,
comments, modularity, etc.), as opposed to how much stuff they have
memorized or can look up.  My first programming gig straight out of school
was cleaning up legacy code, and so in class I always emphasize the
importance of looking at code you've never seen before, figuring out what it
does, and figuring out ways to improve upon it.  So, once again, depending
on the actual job description, I might take some ugly code (in any real work
environment, there should be no shortage of that :), print it out, and give
the candidate a pad and a pen, or a text editor, and say "Clean this up.
I'll be back in 20 minutes."

Hello all, 

So, once again, depending on the actual job description, I might take some ugly code (in any real work environment, there should be no shortage of that :), print it out, and give the candidate a pad and a pen, or a text editor, and say "Clean this up.  I'll be back in 20 minutes." 

That's a great idea. Our first product (wasn't meant to ever be realesed heh) is a mess. If the candidate could manage to navigate through it and improve it, I would be impressed.


Also check with HR to find out what you are *not* allowed to ask, anything that could be construed to be a basis for discrimination like age.

We don't have HR, but I will keep it pretty technical and not personal...besides asking what
their personal interests are.


If you like somebody and think they will work out, ask them to come back and invite in 2 or 3 of their potential coworkers and have a short brainstorming session on a problem you have at the moment.  See what they contribute.

That's a great idea. The position is for a coder, but I let candidates know in my post and on the phone
that there would be times when they might deal with customers, work an account, provide insight
to larger projects, be writing CL scripts, etc. It's a many hats position, because we are a small company
and have lots to get done. I know that this may not work, so based on their performance, I can
place more of their time onto things they a) enjoy doing b) do well (which probably are related).

As for questions, its good to have a formal test you ask them to take, but interviewing is an art you can only get good at with practice.

This will be the first time the tables are turned. I've never conducted an interview before.

Thanks for the feedback.

Hi!

I never hired or interviewed anyone, but currently look for a new job 
and can tell you some of the questions that I ask and my point of view 
of things you consider doing during the interview.

While that is indeed a good exercise it may backfire and make your 
development team look chaotic and disorganized. It may also give the 
impression as if it is OK to create ugly code. You or someone on your 
team apparently did. I would get some doubts if your place is really the 
best address to apply my skills. As a candidate I'd also be confused as 
to what the purpose of this exercise is. Do you expect me to go through 
thousands of lines later and clean up the mess that others left behind? 
Do these developers consider themselves to be "too good" to do work like 
that? And does this test tell you anything about how the candidate 
writes and formats code?
At least don't tell the candidates that this code was considered a 
"product". You need to sell yourself to applicants in the same way as 
they sell themslves to you. And for anyone who is serious about their 
work things like coding standards, work ethic, and such matter as much 
as money.

I wouldn't ask anything personal other than education and previous 
employment. It is none of your business if the candidate likes watching 
SpongeBob. This isn't Germany where it is common to ask this, and the 
occupation of your parents, and to which elementary school you went to.

In that case you may also consider someone who does PHP development as a 
hobby (like me), but has many other skills such as software QA and 
support experience (like me)....uh, did I just apply for the job? ;)
You can always teach them about objects and classes later if they got 
the basics down such as loops, conditions, and such.

I was asked once to take a test during an interview. As soon as the HR 
person asked me to do that I no longer wanted that job. Hire me because 
I work well and not because I test well. Knowing a lot doesn't 
necessarily mean that one can do a lot. There is a fine line between 
knowledge and skill and you really want to go for skill more than 
knowledge. I'm not saying that knowing a lot is bad, but I met people 
with tons of technical degress that were challanged by wiring up a 
simple phone.


Now, the questions that I tend to ask are:
What is the ratio between developers and QA staff? (Should be somewhat 
towards 1:1) Ratio between staff and management? (the lower the better)

Do you like working here? (You better shout out a convincing "Yes" 
immediately and tell me why your company/organization is the best to 
work for in the entire universe)

What is the turnover rate? (If your staff is dropping like the flies you 
really have a problem, not only in regards to answering this question)

Do I have access to all resources and persons on the team and in 
management? (I don't want to schedule an appointment with my supervisor 
for an urgent issue and I don't like not being allowed to go straight to 
other developers to address an issue. This is supposed a team, not a 
jail or the military)

Am I allowed to choose the tools that I consider are the best to do the 
job? (Saying yes may mean that someone buys anything that Programmer's 
Paradise has in stock. If it is about buying the favorite PHP IDE for 
50$ I'd expect that to be a non-issue as long as it makes me (means the 
candidate/employee) be more productive / feel more comfortable. After 
all, you hire someone because they have skills that you currently do not 
have available at all or in the needed amount in your team. You are 
looking for a subject matter expert and not a whipping boy.)

Now the questions that I was asked and that I think are pretty useless:
Where do you want to be in five years? (on my private beach with a huge 
house and tons of cash....no, I don't answer that, I say I want to 
broaden my knowledge and become a subject matter expert in the field I 
am working in. Honestly, first tell me that you will pay me for five 
years and then we can talk where I want to be.)

Why did you apply for this position? (Guess why? I need a job and you 
are hiring, that's why. You apparently think that I am qualified 
otherwise you wouldn't have invited me for an interview.)

How do you organize your workplace? (Who cares if it looks like a bomb 
dropped. There are no customers in my cube and in the end the quality of 
the result counts. A way more interesting question would be how the 
candidate treats other's workspaces and common areas, like the lunch 
room or bathroom - but you are not allowed to ask that.)

What do you expect to get paid? (A million bucks, please....the 
candidate will let you know when you make an offer. If you really like 
one person and they turn you down, you can make a better offer. Use 
salary.com to find out what the going rate is in the area and be sure 
that the applicant did the same. Money is important, but really 
something to talk about at the very very end of the process.)



Good luck finding the right person.

Start with general logic tasks at the white board, like reversing a 
string in place.  Then inverting all the words in a sentence like "I 
really hate taking tests", then reversing the letters in all the words 
in a sentence.  This should be done language-agnostic (no strrchr() or 
reverse()).  What I'm mostly interested in learning is how the applicant 
problem-solves.

I have been asked to solve problems for jobs in the past. One I really 
bombed
and still got the job, another I solved well and got the job.

I don't see the point in NOT testing an applicant..I mean..if they're 
applying
for a job as a programmer, and part of that is solving problems, I'm curious
to see how they approach "problem solving". I don't care if they get the 
answer *right*,
I just want to see their thought process.

> While that is indeed a good exercise it may backfire and make your 
> development team look chaotic and disorganized

True, I guess I'd just be curious if they can follow the code, and also
how they could do it better. Point out some mistakes/bad practices.

Thanks for the thoughts!

Just as a counter to that argument, since I'm the one whose first job was
cleaning legacy code, the someone one the team who wrote like that was long
gone before I arrived.  It was a small company, and they just didn't have
the manpower to clean up code that worked 99% of the time.  Once the code
started acting less reliably/failing more often, that's when my job was
created.

That was precisely what was expected of me.

Do these developers consider themselves to be "too good" to do work like
> that? And does this test tell you anything about how the candidate

I don't know about the other developers.  (Why does that matter, anyway?)
And yes, giving that test to someone tells me a lot about how they write and
format code.  That's why I use similar tests in my courses, because I can't
reasonably expect someone to write an entire program in an hour, along with
multiple-choice and short-answer questions.

I was asked once to take a test during an interview. As soon as the HR
> person asked me to do that I no longer wanted that job.


That's good, because you probably wouldn't have gotten it.

Hire me because
> I work well and not because I test well.


There's only one way to tell whether a candidate will work well, and that's
to watch him work -- at the very least, to examine the results of his work.
I would never hire someone for being a nice guy, or for eloquently
explaining polymorphism.  If you're going to be a coder, I want to see your
code.

Now the questions that I was asked and that I think are pretty useless:


And why employers find them useful:

Where do you want to be in five years?


If your answer has anything to do with not working, or not living here, then
the interviewer will be fearful that you'll bolt as soon as you can.

Why did you apply for this position?


We need to make sure that this really is the job you want, that it'll be
fulfilling, and that you will still want to be here in five years.

How do you organize your workplace?


The guy you're replacing was an absolute disaster, and people hated to share
office space with him.  I sure hope you're neat.

What do you expect to get paid?


If your expectations are unrealistic, you may not be happy working here.

Generally speaking, I imagine it greatly diminishes the effectiveness of
your interview to be offended by standard interview techniques and to
respond with hostility.  Then again, I've had my job for 7 years now; maybe
I forgot what interviewing is like.

Agreed and stand corrected on the other points. Just to make it clear, 
the ficticious answers that I wrote are not the ones I give during an 
interview (I may be blunt, but I'm not stupid) and in some cases don't 
even think that way. I do organize my workspace and find that a tendency 
to neatness and applying some sort of system makes it way easier to find 
  records and react quickly to requests. I worked with people whose 
desks looked like the toy box of my five year old and they did very well 
with that approach. My point is that these questions produce answers 
that I think give an inaccurate impression of the person. There are 
better questions to ask, like "What do you want to learn?", "What do you 
do when your supervisor gives you a task that you think is plain 
wrong?", "What do you do when you are asked to do 15 tasks, but can do 
only 10?". Those are the questions through which I think one gets way 
more information about the candidate.

Message-ID: <95788.81705.qm@web52212.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

This is a rather interesting topic and I am quite
amused with some of the answers.

To start, I have over 27 years in IT.  I've been
through the ranks of programmer in all sorts of
languages.  Some of my greatest achievements were to
take a medium size corporate lending company into the
modern age of computer systems.

None the less, I've been on both sides of the table. 
I've asked those tough questions and I've been asked
those same type of questions.

The key is to have an objective.  If you want someone
to clean up someone's mess then you better state that
during the interviewing process.  When I was looking
for experienced developers I made sure the candidate
new what I was looking for.  In the one situation I
told each candidate that I needed to clean up a mess
and to mentor the other developers to stop making the
mess.  I was quite surprised to see how many people
actually turned down my offer.  

If you want to bring someone in to get a few minor
tasks developed and to manage then make it clear to
the candidates.  

As for testing, the programmer position I took on last
year I was asked to take a test.  The test was no big
deal but as stated here, it was designed to see if I
had the ability to program a solution given a set of
rules.

My present position I was able to carry my 27 years of
experience as well as show some aptitude towards the
type of work which turned out to be enough.

Hiring talented programmers can be challenging.  If
you know what you want then the questions often times
tend to flow much easier.

One other hint.  When I was staffing that corporate
finance company's development staff I would often have
others within the group participate in the
interviewing process.  This was done for several
reasons.  I wanted to make sure that the others
withing the group felt comfortable with the candidate.
 It is so important to develop and establish good
dynamics withing a group.  Groups that get along tend
to be much more productive.

Keep us posted.

Beautiful point Steve.

Critical thinking is certainly a talent that is taken for granted, and often
missed in the standard interviewing process. Although workspace cleanliness
and code hygeine is 'nice-to-have' I'd trade it for the guy that I could
drop an emergency project on, and is going to respond with a clear
communication of several optional solutions.

A critical thinker is also much more likely to learn new concepts and
processes, which is invaluable, particularly within software development,
where the race is run so bleeding edge from time to time.

 I would have to also echo Mr. Merlo's comments. Competency is crucial, but
that does too depend on the area and software. For instance I would probably
be more critical of a C++ heads-down coding position than I would for a PHP
UI builder position. hope that make sense, casue that's what it is, my two
cents. =D

Be careful of over-simplifying so much that it becomes complex. By
storing important data outside of the database, you have created a
situation in which two different sets of data need to be backed up,
migrated to different servers, configured into applications, etc.

Databases are extremely useful for keeping related data together.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Rely on destructor to be called?!
Message-ID: <468407F0.6090909@gmail.com>

Hey!

I am writing a logging class which writes all the data that are to be 
logged in a buffer and when the destructor is called the buffer is 
cleared and written to some data storage.

So I wanted to know whether I can rely on the destructor to be called.

In my tests I just figured out that it won't get called if the script 
ends with a fatal error or something comparable. Otherwise it's always 
invoked.

So just to ensure that I haven't forgotten something? Is there any other 
situation where it's not invoked?

Cheers,
Jay

Message-ID: <021401c7b9b9$86cf0130$6b01a8c0@gamebox>

Hello again, 

I've always had an interest in security. Not too long ago a friend was looking 
into deploying joomla for a client. He's a pentester/researcher for a very well
educated and influential firm = ] , so he had to make sure it was going to be secure.

He started researching and found that many joomla installs had/have been comprimised
via XSS attacks.

Today, he posted the link of a site that had been owned by XSS and the crackers installed this
web based backdoor script.

I grabbed the script and included it here http://www.projectskyline.com/phplist/r57shell.txt  
to show PHP developers AGAIN how important security is and give us an inside look at
some of the tools our enemies are armed with.

For those that deploy joomla, this is especially something to watch for.
For everyone else, just something to checkout.

You'll notice this script enables:

- Mail to be sent out (w/or w/out files attached)
- Commands to be run.
- Search for SUID, writable directories, files, tmp files., .(files) ...
- Outgoing connections to be established
- Some kind of IRC implementation
- SQL to be run
- Files can be downloaded and uploaded
- and much, much more.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] When to close a mysql connection
Message-ID: <46840B21.6000205@gmx.net>

Hi!

Up until now I always opened a db connection to MySQL, did my query 
stuff and then closed the connection again, went on to the next script, 
opened the db connection, did some more queries, closed the connection, 
went to next script.....

Is there anything speaking against making the db link pointer to be 
global, call the connection script once right at the start of the set of 
scripts and then assume that it is just there?

Or asking differently, is there anything speaking against opening and 
closing the db connection each time a set of queries is to be executed?

I just wonder if I make poor PHP / MySQL work harder than necessary.

David

As long as you need to send queries to the database you should keep the 
connection open, because connecting to the database is very often the 
slowest part of the whole script.

Hello,

Doesn't using pconnect take care of this?

What's the best implementation?(provide some source if you can...)

I currently have the connection stuff inside of an include file. So I 
basically would change the line with the mysql_connect to mysql_pconnect 
and ditch all the mysql_close lines that I have in my script, since 
mysql_close does not close persistent connections. But then again, how 
do I close a persistent connection? Uh...found it, the connection gets 
dropped automatically by MySQL.

Hmmmmmm, I am not really convinced that this is as good as it sounds. 
Especially in my current project I allow the active work frame to be 24 
hours before I force users out (will make that configurable later). I 
must then set the MySQL timeout to at least the same value, which 
potentially could cause that MySQL holds many connections.

Yea, what is the best implementation?

I think an even worse attack would be what happened to WordPress not  
too long ago, the code itself on the distribution servers was  
tinkered with.  It's a little unfair to point out XSS as being only a  
Joomla issue.  It happens to any software that lingers past even a  
single minor 0.1 upgrade, including C libraries and such.

The bottom line is if you are shared hosting you are leaving  
"security" in the hands of your ISP period.  If you are running your  
own boxes and don't have things like Tripwire or Snort running you  
are going to be unaware of such attacks anyway.

One of better ways to keep up on it is to monitor files like Bleeding  
Edge for software you are running ...

Hello Jon, 

Great points.

I think an even worse attack would be what happened to WordPress not too long ago, the code itself on the distribution servers was tinkered with.  

Wow, that's really awful. Didn't know about that.


It's a little unfair to point out XSS as being only a Joomla issue.

I didn't mean to say Joomla only has XSS problems...in fact, I don't think I did.

I've used snort in the past, and tripwire. I find snort tough, because you have to keep
up w/the signatures, and thus requires time and attention. In a small company such
as mine, I'd love to set it up, but I don't have the time to monitor and adjust it.

Plus, snort is not the end all be all. Its signature based detection, and as far as I know
doesn't address polymorphic code. But snort is a key part to an overall strong detection
system.

Great link BTW, I haven't messed w/snort in years.

Just for reference:
http://wordpress.org/development/2007/03/upgrade-212/

BTW, you said it nicely, the point being that many smaller shops  
don't have time for monitoring items that Snort or Tripwire pick up  
(Network Security Monitoring).  Neither do I but staying on top of  
the packages you do run and the available signatures via RSS/email @  
least keep you aware of what is out there.

Perhaps most interesting about that r57shell is that it quietly  
remotely logs its own use. So in addition to the use as a backdoor shell 
script, it becomes a beacon for compromised systems - the tool maker 
gets a notice of every IP compromised by the tool when used by others.

To quote full disclosure, "they [the script authors] can 0wn everything 
you 0wned...Trust no one... write your own tools."

Hello,

Its funny you mentioned this because I kinda assumed it might behave that 
way.

I've seen shellcode in the past that did things you didn't know about...

Great link, thanks!

I decided to see what was encoded in the $c1, $c2 variables,
which were base64 encoded strings. This is what they held:

<script 
language="javascript">hotlog_js="1.0";hotlog_r=""+Math.random()+"&s=81606&im=1&r="+escape(document.referrer)+"&pg="+escape(window.location.href);document.cookie="hotlog=1; 
path=/"; hotlog_r+="&c="+(document.cookie?"Y":"N");</script><script 
language="javascript1.1">hotlog_js="1.1";hotlog_r+="&j="+(navigator.javaEnabled()?"Y":"N")</script><script

Hello again,

Just because I was curious, I decoded the remaining variables.

That provided 1 .c program and 3 .pl programs.

The c code binds to a shell and allows incomming connections
dropped to /bin/bash.

The first .pl program does the same.

The second .pl program connects via lynx to a port/host
you specify.

The third .pl program spawns child processes to push data
to a host/port.

Interesting ...

You can view the code here: http://www.projectskyline.com/phplist/test.php

at Pear::Mail and PHPMailer, I'd like to know if you guys would
recommend any others.

I highly recommend SwiftMailer. I use it in my CakePHP applications. 
It's far eaisier to modify (and to use, in my opinion) than PHPMailer.

I have not tried Pear::Mail myself.

Hello Everybody



I would like to set up secure login to my website, which is still under development and I want visitors to login using their allocated User-ID and Password. Of course, if they pass authentication they are in and if not they are 100% completely denied all access to the website. What I am trying to avoid is anybody penetrating security because they know its inner workings. I would also like to understand the coding behind this type of authentication as used on the Internet as opposed to an  Intranet Can anybody point me in the right direction? 



Cheers 



Paul

Hi Paul,

Most web servers (IIS, Apache, others) will support features to require 
a username and password on any directory on your site.  For Apache, 
here's a good place to learn more:
<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/auth.html>

You could also do this kind of thing with pure PHP or other programming 
languages, but since your site is still under development, you're 
probably safer going with a user screening method that doesn't depend on 
your application code.

Securing an internet site is not so different from securing an
intranet site. Use a PHP session. If the user isn't logged-in (no
userid in the session) then show or process the login form and exit().

session_start();
if ( empty($_SESSION['userid']) ) {
  if ( !empty($_POST['username'] ) {
    // authenticate user based on POST
    ...
    $_SESSION['userid'] = $userid;
    header("Location: /");
  }
  // show login form
  ...
  exit();
}

You'll want to use SSL (HTTPS) since the packets will be traveling
over the public network.

You might want to include a mechanism for limiting the number of login
attempts that can be made, so that a casual attacker can't use "brute
force" to guess passwords. Doing this is harder than it sounds; see
mod_security for one approach. http://www.modsecurity.org/

Subject: [nycphp-talk] POST request
Message-ID: <e2bdf8970706291929i530700cejb2fb3e00daafbe8d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Is the maximum size allowed for a POST request 2 gigabytes? Apache 2.2
supports large files, like `not-rotated' log files *already* present
on the local file system (of the web server), but, when file uploads
are concerned, we have the following (from Apache official
documentation):

LimitRequestBody
This directive specifies the number of bytes from 0 (meaning
unlimited) to 2147483647 (2GB) that are allowed in a request body.

It looks like a different thing, not related to the Large File Support
above. As far as I have understood, Apache can only support files
larger than 2 gigabytes accessed locally, e.g. for appending data in
huge log files, and the POST is (maybe) universally fixed to 2GB.
Please tell me what you think about this. I am not able to upload
files larger than 2GB via HTTP although I have set some (valid) values
in the PHP.INI (memory_limit=3.9G, post_max_size=3.5G,
upload_max_filesize=3G). If I look at the Apache's `error_log', it
displays very weird entries, like that the size of the file I am
uploading exceeds zero or a negative value.

Thank you,

Matteo

I am sure there are limits and I am sure they are related to what 
Apache/PHP can address and the server system you are using.
I think the question needs to be not if and how much, but why? HTTP is 
designed to transfer hypertext, not files. Although it can do that, file 
transfer with HTTP and huge files is just waste. While I can see how 
that might be practical for an intranet solution with a fast LAN, I 
really don't see how it is healthy to upload 2GB files via ther internet 
using HTTP. Stuff will time out somewhere at some point and your server 
has quite a bit on its hands when getting several multi GB (pronounced 
gee byte being 1,073,741,824 bytes, not gigabyte being 1 billion bytes - 
enough hairsplitting).
You also want to look at the upload file limits, which are a subset of 
the POST limits. The POST limit has to be larger than the upload file limit.

I propose you look at FTP transfers and use the cURL functions to do 
this. I do not know if cURL has something that allows for uploading from 
the client to the server, but it for sure can grab a file from an FTP 
server and pull it to your web server's file system. I am sure that 
there are compact client side FTP apps in ECMAScript or Flash that allow 
for uploading files via FTP. That strikes me to be the way better 
approach for moving huge files and remedies any potential timeout problems.

David

That's right, I agree with you, I considered to use FTP because of
that, but I was curious about some HTTP related transfers.

Yes, sure, as the PHP guys recommend, that's why I set post_max_size=3.5G
and upload_max_filesize=3G. Also `memory_limit' must be larger than
`post_max_size', as you can see from my previous message. My PHP
installation is also compiled with large file support, I
double-checked that the Makefile had these compiler flags:

-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64

Yes, no doubt about it. I agree, I was just curious about POST limits.

No mysql doesn't hold many connections then as there is only one 
connection at all when using persistent connections.

Well, yes, but I assume one per client. So if I'd set the timeout to be 
x hours then it might just be quite easy to pile up a few hundred of 
unused connections. And that even with only a few concurrent connections 
at a time. Playing devil's advocate here.

I think that this might be less an issue when setting the timeout 
reasonably, such as 30 minutes. Much better to reconnect once every half 
hour (if that) then for every script call. Is that how it works?

No that's not how it works, that's how normal database connections work.
How should MySQL know which user connects? The user makes one HTTP 
Request and if he does it again nobody knows that he has ever been here 
(except if the webserver has set a cookie). I don't know how persistent 
connections exactly work as I haven't used them before. Everything I 
know and probably everything you need to know from a developers point of 
view is that when using persistent connections the connection is kept 
open even if the execution of the PHP script finishes and if the script 
is executed again and again there is always the same connection being 
used. If two scripts access this connection concurrently there is no 
second connection opened, no they are sharing this connection with each 
other.

That's actually how I understood it. So correct me if I am wrong ... :-)

I am in no position to correct you, but isn't it that PHP talks to MySQL 
rather then the HTTP client? As far as MySQL is concerned, the 
connection comes from where the PHP interpreter is located. And since 
each connection from PHP to MySQL gets named sufficiently uniquely I 
guess that PHP can keep multiple clients apart. Normally one opens a 
connection, runs the queries, and then closes it. I always make sure 
that I explicitly close the connection, but after reading the 
documentation a script end will close the connection as well. Seems to 
be quite different from opening files, which stay open and locked even 
after the script is done.
It may just be that PHP uses only one persistent connection and feeds 
all the queries through that one regardless of client (but returns the 
values back to the script instance from where the query came), which is 
what you suspect. Unless someone who really knows what is going on comes 
forward we can only resort to speculation.

I will give it a try and see what happens. It's only adding a "p". Since 
the mysql_close doesn't do any thing on persistent connections there is 
no harm in leaving it in - or so the theory goes.

I don't see a problem with my current project as this one will never be 
used by more than a few dozen clients at a time, but I have other 
projects where some optimization may be more than just OK.
