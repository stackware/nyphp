Actually a customer is somebody who pays for things, so this is not a
customer, they are somebody you allowed to steal from you.  Here is how
you prevent this in the future.

Never deliver a system without payment in full, and you get progress
payments as you go.  this means you need a W-I-P server where you can
put the drafts for them to see, but which they cannot get.  If they run
into cash problems and want to slow down  you say &quot;great&quot;, and just
leave it there until they come back.  If they want to hurry up you say,
&quot;great&quot; and ask for some more progress money.

If they protest that they don't want to pay too much up front, there are
two things you must do so that each of you is minimizing risk:

1)  State very clearly something like this &quot;My ability to extend credit
is very limited, I cannot do more than $X of work w/o being paid,
otherwise I cannot keep my commitments&quot;

2)  Make sure to give frequent updates to the WIP site so they can see
what they are paying for, this lets them protest and stop progress
payments if they don't like it.

For the current situation, they obviously believe that they don't have
to pay you, that you don't count.  Have your family attorney send them a
letter demanding payment.  If that does not work your attorney can
escalate, and you can probably send their hosting company a letter
saying
they are hosting an illegal site and ask them to take it down.
HOWEVER,
it is very important when  you pursue this legal stuff to know that it
will take about 30-60 minutes every 2-4 weeks, and in the meantime you
must not think about these guys, they'll poison your mind, concentrate
instead on new jobs and getting paid for those.  When this money comes
in after 3-6 months it will be like a bonus.


&gt;<i> Hey Gals and Guys,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have noticed that there are alot of freelancers on the list and I am
</I>
&gt;<i> looking for a little advice.  I have a client that is being a pain.  I
</I>
&gt;<i> spent alot of time developing a site for them and it turned out very 
</I>&gt;<i> nice in my opinion.  The client seemed very happy with the finished 
</I>&gt;<i> product as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The client paid about 1/3 of the cost of the site up front and was 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to pay the balance on delivery.  I delivered the site months 
</I>&gt;<i> ago and have not received further payment.  The site is still active 
</I>&gt;<i> and it has been receiving alot of traffic.  They receive hundreds of 
</I>&gt;<i> visits a day and many users submitting information.  Needless to say 
</I>&gt;<i> they are doing business with the site and making a profit from it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The owner of the site has not returned my many calls and emails over 
</I>&gt;<i> the past two months.  I am trying to figure out how to get him to 
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledge me and hopefully pay up!  I have a full time job as a 
</I>&gt;<i> Java/PHP/.NET programmer so I don't do freelance often. This was the 
</I>&gt;<i> only project I have done in years and it was as a favor to a friend. 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I regret doing it at all and feel that I was taken advantage of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any advice?
</I>&gt;<i>
