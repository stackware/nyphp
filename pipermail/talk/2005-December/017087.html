Having done a lot of this type of work, typically even if the spec is 
detailed, there are plenty of other little details that you're leaving 
out, so there's still value in sending it out.

It's always an interactive process, unless your specs are written in 
stone by the finger of Dog and handed down from atop a smoke-covered 
desert mountain. (In fact, the idea of iterative specs is the 
cornerstone of all those &quot;agile&quot; software development dogmata.)

&gt;<i> royally screwed other than trust and faith?
</I>
If the guy is &quot;good&quot;, trust and faith is enough and the contract is 
superfluous. He does the work, and you pay him.

If the guy is &quot;bad&quot;, trust and faith *and* a contract won't be enough in 
any case.

Much of the contracting world is based on trust; you live and die by it. 
I've recently been an observer to a dispute between a contractor and his 
client; the contractor simply failed to deliver repeatedly.
I will decline to make further commentary other than to say that I was 
neither the client nor the contractor.
