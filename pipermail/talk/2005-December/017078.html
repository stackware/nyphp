<PRE>Another extremely effective collection techniquie:  Show-up.

If the client is local and ducking your calls an emails, they obviously
don't like confrontation.  Showing up might result in a check.

Do you have any ability to take the site down?  You should have language in
your agreement that say the site belongs to you until the final payment is
made.  Especially if the site is making money for your &quot;client&quot; he'd be very
anxious to pay up if the site were taken down.

Hey Gals and Guys,

I have noticed that there are alot of freelancers on the list and I am
looking for a little advice.  I have a client that is being a pain.  I
spent alot of time developing a site for them and it turned out very
nice in my opinion.  The client seemed very happy with the finished
product as well.

The client paid about 1/3 of the cost of the site up front and was
supposed to pay the balance on delivery.  I delivered the site months
ago and have not received further payment.  The site is still active
and it has been receiving alot of traffic.  They receive hundreds of
visits a day and many users submitting information.  Needless to say
they are doing business with the site and making a profit from it.

The owner of the site has not returned my many calls and emails over
the past two months.  I am trying to figure out how to get him to
acknowledge me and hopefully pay up!  I have a full time job as a
Java/PHP/.NET programmer so I don't do freelance often. This was the
only project I have done in years and it was as a favor to a friend.
Now I regret doing it at all and feel that I was taken advantage of.

Any advice?
