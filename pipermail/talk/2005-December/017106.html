<PRE>excellent post.

&gt;<i> somebody who might not regret it once wrote: :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This was due to a more creative solution.  Errors.  Simply introduce code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>once a set date is hit, cause the application to throw an error in a key
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>area of the application.  When the customer calls to have it fixed, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>say not until I receive payment for the app development, and advance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>payment for the estimated time to correct the &quot;error&quot;.  Actual error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>correction was to remove this payment trap.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry but this is a terrible idea. Not only is it probably fraudulent,
</I>&gt;<i> but it gives the world valid excuses for not paying you (errors). It
</I>&gt;<i> also validates your (bad) reputation, which otherwise may have remained
</I>&gt;<i> at the rumor / disgruntled cheapskate stage. IMHO never, ever compromise
</I>&gt;<i> your integrity like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mitch offered excellent advice above IMHO, as did Kenneth Downs with his
</I>&gt;<i> work-in-progress process.I agree in theory with Andrew's suggestions
</I>&gt;<i> about specs but I also know that a really detailed spec is a wonderful
</I>&gt;<i> vehicle for screwing people out of their wages. Lawyers get paid to
</I>&gt;<i> argue so the more detail subject to interpreattion the higher the cheat
</I>&gt;<i> ceiling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The whole issue for me is one of professionalism both in work and
</I>&gt;<i> business relationship. Stay the course, hold the line, etc. all apply
</I>&gt;<i> here. Sure it might hurt now but it's nothing personal, IT'S JUST
</I>&gt;<i> BUSINESS. Whether you want to believe it or not, a whole of the business
</I>&gt;<i> world is about cheating other players out of their earned share.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, a bunch of IF's seem to apply here. Just like &quot;if you didn't make a
</I>&gt;<i> backup before your host went bankrupt, it's not the host's fault&quot; we can
</I>&gt;<i> say:
</I>&gt;<i> - if you never had a plan to deal with non-payers, you haven't prepared
</I>&gt;<i> your business properly.
</I>&gt;<i> - if you had too many eggs in one basket, you weren't properly financed
</I>&gt;<i> - if you're overheated emotionally by the gall of the guy, you haven't
</I>&gt;<i> the temperament for business
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And perhaps most poignantly, if you don't know what to do to &quot;influence&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> this guy to pay you the agreed fee, GAME OVER. You lose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably sounds too harsh but it is true - if he can &quot;get away with it&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> while working within the &quot;system&quot;, then you lost and need to learn from
</I>&gt;<i> it. And that includes his being legally wrong and you legally correct,
</I>&gt;<i> yet insufficiently funded to pursue him successfully. Many, many
</I>&gt;<i> business people play those odds every day. If you keep losing you are
</I>&gt;<i> not doing yourself any favors staying in business (and you ARE helping
</I>&gt;<i> the bottom line of that portion of the marketplace that is comprised of
</I>&gt;<i> bottom-feeding scum and scammers).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's really not as negative as it may sound... just realistic. I am 100%
</I>&gt;<i> sure that some creative problem solving could help you, IF you were
</I>&gt;<i> properly prepared to &quot;stay the course&quot;. I once had a client $XX,000
</I>&gt;<i> behind, making money with my work and ignoring my bills. It went to
</I>&gt;<i> almost  $XXX,000 before I collected. The reason I was able to collect in
</I>&gt;<i> full was because except for recurring &quot;past due&quot; notices and the like
</I>&gt;<i> (including usurious 21% interest penalties I added unsuccessfully), I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't start a war. Instead I sought ways to leverage that $40k value he
</I>&gt;<i> was enjoying against the additional debt he would subsequently incur
</I>&gt;<i> with further development. Ater all, if he was making cash off my work
</I>&gt;<i> and didn't have to pay me (perhaps thinking he could shut me out at any
</I>&gt;<i> moment) he was a sucker for more. By the time we got close to 6 figures
</I>&gt;<i> it was very clear that he had a larger than six figure liability
</I>&gt;<i> (equivalent to the value of the system) if I was not satisfied. One day
</I>&gt;<i> I required payment in full with no compromise and it was a simple
</I>&gt;<i> business decision for him to pay me promptly, as it was for me to
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently exit from any further involvement. Perhaps someone on this
</I>&gt;<i> list knows the client. I consider him a good reference, and a
</I>&gt;<i> poor-quality client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for small claims, I live by the truth that *nothing* costs less than
</I>&gt;<i> $5k, regardless of price. Even if the market says $2k it's not true...
</I>&gt;<i> everything costs more than $5k to manage should things go even slightly
</I>&gt;<i> wrong. Don't take any job that doesn't generate at least $5k in profits
</I>&gt;<i> or you are assuming risk in the market place simply because there are so
</I>&gt;<i> many bottom-feeders out there scamming in the under $5k market where the
</I>&gt;<i> costs of doing business exceed the value. It's a game and you should
</I>&gt;<i> only play it if you are willing to assume the risk or have another
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;angle&quot; (like a brother who's a really aggressive lawyer :-)  Of course
</I>&gt;<i> being willing to take the risk as a startup counts as a valid reason to
</I>&gt;<i> take on the work, but then you can't really complain when you get
</I>&gt;<i> cheated because you took the risk, right? There are plenty of forums for
</I>&gt;<i> complaing that some people in this world suck.
