Hola:

Hmm...  No feedback to this response at all.  I miss a meeting so I'm 
dead to all of you? :)

I'm mostly curious to hear what people think about the approach I used 
for monitoring PHP error logs,
http://github.com/convissor/log_monitoring_solution

Do you monitor your PHP error logs?  What do you do it with?  Are there 
improvements I can make?

Thanks,

--Dan

Hah!  If your dead, then I'm a decomposing corpse since I moved away from
the center of the universe.

Well, if your REALLY interested, how about setting up a monitor and
integrating the growl library to send stuff to me via growl?  So whenever
there is an error during dev work, my growl client can spit it up on the
screen for a few seconds.  There is a perl Growl module in CPAN,
http://search.cpan.org/~mattn/Growl-GNTP-0.07/lib/Growl/GNTP.pm

As for version control, I'm getting more and more interested in setting it
up with an all in one, continuous build server after reading Walter Cedric's
blogs on it:
http://www.waltercedric.com/java-j2ee-mainmenu-53/360-continuous-build/1549-installing-teamcity-standalone-on-opensuse-11x-plesk-9.html

The question is....if I go that route...since I need to switch IDE's anyway,
should I go for NetBeans which looks nice but doesn't integrate directly
with TeamCity....or pony up for JIDE which does?

Since this list is an infinite repository of random facts, I've run across a
bunch of php snippets which create mind maps in XML format from data, what I
find interesting though is it is difficult to actually find the XML formats
being used by the various major mind map vendors documented fully.  All I've
found so far is scattered overviews of the format, but a lack of true
detail.  Anyone know of a good in depth definition of mind map XML files for
various vendors?

Im guessing there is no "standard" XML that they all agree on, but maybe 
if you can find sample files for each, you can then see if they reference 
any DTDs?

You might find something to work with XMind (open format)
http://code.google.com/p/xmind3/wiki/XMindFileFormat
http://www.mind-mapping.org/interoperability-of-mind-mapping-software/XMIND.php

XMind is able to read (import) FreeMind, so there is some code of
interest there.

or, FreeMind itself
http://freemind.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freemind/freemind/freemind.xsd?view=log
is the schema
If you get the source, there are several XSL transforms in
/freemind/accessories/ for things like html, openoffice, twiki, task
juggler etc.

It depends on what "faster" means.  MyISAM has about a third of the
storage/RAM/processing footprint.  And because it doesn't do
multi-versioning and row level locks, a given table operation will always be
faster than InnoDB, except...

when the read/write ratio approaches 50% due to table locking vs row locking
(and some other stuff, like the types of available buffers).  This is why
MyISAM is typically favored for the average web application (which are
general read-heavy in well designed applications), and InnoDB can be favored
for more volatile data.  Note that for the "enterprise" style transactions
(finance, for example), InnoDB falls short.  Not until recently can it
support more than about 130 concurrent transactions.  And even now, I'd be
gun shy so pick your battle wisely.

The real number is exactly that - depends on what you need to do.  If your
site really starts to push modern hardware, then you can consider a hybrid
environment across multiple pieces of metal (and obviously including all the
other black magic bones and feathers of scaling).

+1 for unit testing for PHP.  We held a successful testfest in May and had
planned on making it a more frequent occurrence (it's actually fun -
really).

While we have some documentation/notes/experts on how to structure this type
of thing, on let's say a monthly or bi-monthly basis vs yearly, time
unfortunately hasn't allowed for much more on this front.

So, this is another project for the hopper. :)  Let me know if so inclined.

One of many gigs (zillions) on Idealist.org:

Teaching English to Tibetan Children
The Jyekundo area ("Yushu" in Chinese) is one of the most remote Tibetan
regions with Tibetan culture very much intact. Volunteers are given a very
special opportunity to improve the lives of Tibetan children while also
learning about and immersing in Tibetan culture.

Yeah...

We're looking at a trip to Romania to help with marginalized groups. Much shorter but as life impacting.

Message-ID: <4bffc351002080807h7ae69558s4d2dc1927af33c74@mail.gmail.com>

Well...after a foray of reviewing IDE's....  I come to the conclusion that I
STILL loathe Eclipse with a passion.

IntelliJDEA looks fascinating but I'm not willing to be on the bleading edge
of their beta work.

Kiomodo IDE still looks cool and works best for my mindset, but lacks the
integration I seek for other items and has a weird issue on updating the
path when opening remote files.

UltraEdit's product is still windows only[though they have a linux editor]
so it is out of the running.

Netbeans is looking more and more interesting.  Integrating it with their
other product, Kenai makes for some cool project management functionality.
 It also integrates to Hudson so I can give a continuous build system a
stab.

Now there is just one thing I would like to do, I'd like to be able to
maintain a list of files somewhere[for example, in a bug issue ticket] and
have some way of automatically opening all those files at once.

So, 2 questions:
1) Anyone else using netbeans and if so, what do you think?  Especially if
your also using hudson and integrating the whole thing.

2) Anyone using netbeans that knows a simple way to open multiple files at
once if I've but all the filenames in a text field that I can cut and paste
from?

I share the Eclipse loathing. I'm creaking along with Zend Studio 5.5
(which I wish they would just open source, hello Zend?) since it just
works for me.

I tried NetBeans last year. It was close, very close. You could see it
getting more polished by the week. I finally had to drop it because I
was missing a way to manually associate a variable with a particular
class. Last I heard, there were considering adding the /* @var $foo
myFoo */ syntax used in Studio, so I might go back.

    I've yet to see a good IDE for PHP.  I hate to say it,  but the 
editing tool I like the best these days is Dreamweaver,  particularly 
because it has an edit-over-sftp mode that ~actually works~ unlike many 
of the open source editors I've tried.
  
    These days I'm looking at a big codebase that has inconsistency in 
tabbing & spacing...  Is there a PHP pretty-printer out there that's 
good for cleaning up source code (rather than outputting HTML?)

I believe this has been implemented in the current version, but while I've
installed it and poked it a few times, I keep going back to Komodo Edit
because it works for me and I lack the time to learn a new tool this week.

With one weird exception on my Macp[which may be MY Mac since no one else
has complained....wish I knew this stupid OS enough to just wipe/reintstall]
 I have had no problems with Komodo[IDE or the free open source Komodo Edit
version] opening files via SFT, SSH, FTP, etc remotely editing and saving
the files again.

Note, I used Komodo IDE ver 4.4.......  didn't want to pay for the upgrade
to ver5, but Komodo Edit works fine for my needs, so I've switched to Komodo
Edit v5[my minimum requirement these days is it works on Mac and Windows,
and preferably Linux, so I can move from OS to OS without learning a new
editor].

If your pure windows based, I highly recommend checking out UltraEdit and
their bigger IDE product.  UltraEdit did most of what I wanted, the bigger
IDE added some nice features.  Both apps I believe will scan all the files
in your project and build a source/class tree and allows you to jump from
calling the function in one file to the definition by just clicking on
it[and it will also show you all calls to a function/method when viewing the
definition].

Other products do something similiar, but they all seem to use the PHPDoc
format documentation to figure things out, they don't just figure it out
from the sourcecode..  Not so great when your inheriting code.

Lasltly, I've seen solutions for both Netbeans, Komodo, and Ultraedit to
call PHP Beautifier on the open file or all files in a project, so that
might help your cleanup:

Give http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_Beautifier a try.  Some text editors 
take care of this too.  I use EditPlus and it has functionality that 
performs tab/space conversion (under the Edit | Format menu).

While I don't do a ton of PHP these days, for all my editing I just use
gEdit.  I find a lot of the IDE's fall into the category of 80/20, but the
80% they solve isn't the 80% I need.

I tried Eclipse a month or so ago and it was brutally slow, and that was on
a machine with 6gb of ram and a decent processor.

this has absolutely nothing to do with this thread or php, BUT i have used
EVERY IDE in existence.  It probably cost Apple 1/2 billion dollars to get
Xcode out the door.  Worth a free DL just to see what the future will look
like. It's just about perfect.

and free!

ok, back to the thread!  :-)

I use phpDesigner7. This IDE is excellent, has many features. And can be use
for writing java, C#, vb, or any kind of code, not particularly  used just
for php, as it names hints at.
But, it is not free, you will have to buy the license.

    I think the meaning of "IDE for PHP" is very different from what an 
"IDE for Java" or an "IDE for C#" is.  Personally I love Eclipse/Java 
and find Visual Studio is a great environment for work in C#.  In a 
statically typed language,  it's possible for an IDE to do a LOT of 
inference about types and provide many useful features, such as the 
ability to track down all of the places where a function is used and 
change its name reliably.

    In particular,  I feel that Eclipse does a great job of pushing back 
against Java's verbosity:  it makes Java a tolerable language to work in.

    You just can't do so much in PHP,  because you don't know what the 
type of each variable is.  You could certainly build something that 
makes a guess when it can,  but it's not going to be as complete as an 
IDE for a static language.

    To make matters worse,  my big project heavily uses 
metaprogramming,  for instance,  if you write

$x=$object->some_property()

    there's a magic method that looks for

    $object->get_some_property() and $object->_get_some_property()

    If it's _get_some_property(),  the property is memoized.  The system 
revolves around an "object model" where there is a hierarchy of 
persistent types:

so_type_object -> so_type_entity -> so_type_picture -> 
so_type_picture_of_topic

and then there are instances of these objects,  so

so_type_picture ===> so_instance_of_picture

and then there are "controller" objects that define the web user 
interface;  controllers themselves are decomposed into inheritable 
sub-controller objects that means that I can add some feature to,  say,  
so_type_entity (like tags or comments) and have the web UI become 
available for all of the subtypes...  but still be able to disable or 
modify features;  now, I use

$method_name=compute_method_name();
$object->$method_name

all the time.   On top of that,  there is a "value type" hierarchy that 
(roughly) lets me create new types for SQL columns,  and sometimes these 
types are getting boxed and unboxed.

Behaviors here are driven by naming conventions;  it would be nice to 
have an "IDE" that is programmable with my naming conventions so it can 
help me navigate through a pretty big system.  If I'm going to do 
anything in this department,  it's going to build on top of my 
autoloading system,  which already maintains a map of which classes are 
in which file,  and is probably going to also add a profiling capability 
so I can preload commonly used classes in a way that that opcode caches 
can understand.

Actually, most IDE's can do that these days.  In fact, that is how one
implements different languages in an IDE, you build a great big language
file of all that data and import it as either a "language" or a "library".

Most will also parse through your PHPDoc statements and give you information
out of there as well.

The problem I always run into is that by the time one does all that, one
could have finished the program. And it is specific to the IDE.

As an example, there are NetBeans libraries for all drupal functions, smarty
functions, and the symphony framework.

You just need to have someone who is highly motivated to make the
file.....which generally means you need to be working in a team where
everyone uses the same IDE and one person is maintaining the library for the
team.

I don't like Ecplipse either. It is probably a nice IDE for Java, but it is 
blatantly obvious that it was designed without PHP in mind. I spent some money 
for NuSphere's PHPEd and it works ver well for the little bit that I do. I 
bought it mainly for the excellent debugger implementation, no need to have it 
break on each script file.
If it has to be a freebie I found that Waterproof's PHPEdit is the best.

I've been using jEdit ever since Jayesh Seth made the recommendation a 
few years ago.
It has the support of many useful plugins such as the php parser, 
project viewer/manager, svn, ftp/ssh/sftp editing, and much more.

Motivated by all the positive feedback on Netbeans discussed here, I 
downloaded it last week and will dip my feet into it over the next few 
days. Are there any "quick start" guides for netbeans php? The video on 
their website discussing PHP6 namespaces was not all that helpful.

I found none of their tutorials all that great..

I've been dealing with Eclipse for several years now (I was working at IBM when they were creating it, so I think that gives me a little affinity towards it).  I like the outline view of my class for navigating it, the task list for grouping my "TODO" notes, quick custom code templates, the tooltips with function definitions, etc.  But I've grown to not be able to live without the "Open Declaration" feature which lets me highlight a method or class name, hit F3, and get right to that file.  With a large project, that has been a huge time saver.  I think NetBeans has something similar?  I remember downloading NetBeans and being a little turned off by it... but I can't remember why now.

Eclipse caps its memory usage and if it's not large enough, it spends a lot of time figuring out how to clear heap space.  I edited my eclipse.ini file and set 
-Xmx1024m
to let it have up to 1GB of memory if it needs it.  That seems to be enough.

I also stopped using any source control integration.  Subversive would just bring my machine to a halt continually.  I wish it worked well, but I'm handy enough with svn on the command line to not really need it.

I also split my large project into several small projects in Eclipse that reference each other.  This has seemed to help with keeping the "building workspace" time to a minimum.  It also lets me keep libraries I don't use much closed.  I found that certain 3rd party libraries with tons of files -- and especially yui from Yahoo -- would kill performance in Eclipse if I kept it as part of my project.

It seems to me that Eclipse PDT is a beast that needs to be kept at bay continually, but is really powerful if tuned to a tolerable level.

Ctrl + click on the method/class/variable does the job

Err.. I meant php5.3 not php6 :P
The openoffice document downloaded from your mysqlconf link was slim on 
details, but the last page listed some useful resources.
Here is one from netbeans.tv that comes close to being a practical 
"quickstart" for netbeans-php:

Hmm..  jEdit looks interesting.   I really like the bookmark plugin as that
is something I was looking for - especially with the ability to export that
to XML, so one could bookmark every file one touches for a bug, export that
set of bookmarks, and attach it to the issue tracker in case you have to go
back and make more changes.

Sorry about that.... I ran across the title of the presentation while
searching O'Reilly's articles the other day, so I assumed it was an article
but never actually LOOKED at the whole page, just sent it over to Evernote
in my resources notebook to review later.

Is anyone using PSPad?

While not an IDE, PSPad does include a code explorer among other great
features.  It won me over years ago -- esp. the developer/Beta releases.
The dev community is active, and while not open source, there is a rich
collection of extensions written in JavaScript and VB Script.  I've extended
the platform with some contributed code and the underlying Embarcadero
Delphi the editor is based on is currently working on Project X (compiling
Delphi Pascal to Windows/Mac/Linux), so Mac support could arrive soon.
Meanwhile, some users have had success running PSPad through CrossOver 7.

I used jEdit exclusively for about four years. Most of its plugins are 
the extremely useful (the remote file explorer is second to none in my 
opinion.) I ultimately switched to Komodo Edit because of the "Code 
Intelligence" and clean interface. Just my two cents.

Try this website and you might find tons of IDEs for almost every language there is out there.
http://www.ZeroNilZilch.Com
One particular text editor that is suitable for every language, including PHP, is Max's HTML Beauty, which is found in the above website. You'll have to look carefully to find it and it's under title heading "Office (Business) Softwares", about half-way through the page in the middle of the main page.
Good Luck!!!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] YAML and Database Definitions
Message-ID: <4bffc351002100442iaa51d55tda5cb9ad77c589e4@mail.gmail.com>

Both Doctrine and Andromeda use YAML files to describe the database[tables,
columns, etc].

I had assumed[bad idea] that meant that YAML was widely used in that regard
and there was a standardized YAML definition for database definitions.

Now I'm in a bind....since I was talking to my father about that and it's
one of the few new technologies he's actually interested in[he worked mainly
with DB2 and other IBM offerings...seeing that he bleeds blue.... and has
since retiring mainly been doing work in Access....yeah yeah, access is ugly
and let's you design bad databases, but if you already have the database
DESIGN skills in spades, Access lets you design a full blow application that
you can give to someone else to use without them needing to install anything
but access.  So he uses it for things like cemetery plot usage applications
for his cemetery....endangered animal tracking on his property, etc].

So now I'm wondering is YAML used in such a manner and is there a standard
definition for how to use YAML, or is both Doctrine and Andromeda simply
rolling their own systems?  I don't want to point him to the main YAML site,
because frankly outside of database design he really has no interest in
learning another millionth computer language.

You have concept mismatch there. YAML is a way (one of thousands) to
store structured data. Like XML, or CSV, or JSON, or the binary
formats used by databases. It's a file format.

Access is a platform, as are Doctrine and Andromeda.

File formats are generally interchangeable with a little work. If they
wanted to, Andromeda could switch to JSON tomorrow. Changing platforms
often requires restarting from scratch.

Are you really asking if you should use Access, since it is so widely used?

Or the SQL DDL files for databases. :-)

Or the XML DDL files for databases.

Doctrine and Andromeda[and Symphony and a number of other frameworks] can
read and write Database defintions from a YAML file.  And MySQL workbench
will reverse engineer a database and store the definitions as YAML[yes, that
is storing data.  In this case, instead of the data IN the tables, it is
storing the data ABOUT the tables].

However, YAML is a high level markup language.  It doesn't specify down to
the specific level what the field NAMES will be called.  It just says if you
have an array of data, here is how you can present it as text.

Moreover, there are many high level database concepts[foreign keys,
triggers, etc] that can also be mapped into YAML terms.

Now, my question is not /how/ to do this/  Nor is it can you do it[as I know
you can].

What I want to know is it it being done in a standardized format.  Can a
database definition file generated by Doctrine then be taken and used by
Andromeda, and vice versa.  Are they following a set of standards, or are
they making it up as they go along.  And what other languages have libraries
to do the same[the ability to take have a database engineer really design
the database at a high level and store that definition in a YAML file, which
both a Ruby and PHP programmer could then take and generate all their
classes to access the data so they are following the same rules and such is
extremely powerful.  But are we there?]

Nope, I don't use Access.  My father does, he is quite happy with it because
it fits HIS niche.  His niche is non-web enabled individuals, sitting in
little offices in midstate NY with no internet conenctions, who just need
glorified spreadsheets with a user friendly front end.

He also uses Lotus Notes and DB2 and I think a very old copy of Erwin....
 He uses the tools he has, and they fit his needs so there is no reason to
learn new ones in his 'retirement'[retirement....HA, he invents work for
himself...like the aforementioned Cemetery application he built from scratch
since they were using the "piles of paper" method of tracking plots.....
of course, the fact that this gets him in good graces with the owners, on
the board, and when my brother died he was able to not only quickly purchase
2 plots in his section....he was able to convince them that if they leveled
out the slight hill behind his plots and my brother and sister in law's new
plots, they could create another half dozen plots behind them for the rest
of his kids and grandchildren... :-)]

But the idea that if he stores definitions in YAML programmers can use them
interested him enough to learn something new....so now I want to find what
the standards for defining database structure in YAML is...or if there are
none, then I need to find that out to let him know.

Just a few notes. Ken has stopped maintaining and using Andromeda. Donald
Organ has taken over maintenance of it and wants to rename it Postgres on
PHP. I've never heard of doctrine, so I don't know if the formats are the
same. I doubt the formats would be the same.

Also, what does your dad use to define the Access databases? Does he use the
access GUI? I wrote my own tool to read and edit Access databases with SQL
http://plane-disaster.sourceforge.net/. Years after needing PlaneDisaster, I
did find a codeproject article with a prettier looking MS Access Query
Editor, but the maintainer does not have a public SVNrepo or answer my
questions.

Justin Dering

Hmm, any idea why?  I could never get into it because I work for clients in
shared hosting aka mysql environments but he was really gung ho for a while.

Doctrine:
http://www.doctrine-project.org/

You can define your table structures in YAML or PHP and Doctrine will
automagically create all the table classes and getter/setter methods.  Also
adheres to foreign keys, so if you know that each order entry item is
associated with an order, and you try to add a new order line item, the
classes flow that up to adding an order as well.

There are some similar things for Ruby, such as
http://rubyforge.org/projects/db-discovery/ but the more digging I do, the
only "standardized" items I find are config files[database name, server,
username, password] not DDL

Oh well, score 0 for cross platform/language coolness.



> Also, what does your dad use to define the Access databases?

Knowing him...and this is purely a guess, I'd guess that he uses Erwin and
exports that DDL and runs it through DB2.  Once he has a traditional
database format, he can point access to the database and import the
definitions and Access will create it's lame internal structure based on
that.

That's just a guess, but generally everything is done with DB2 and then
migrated to whatever platform he is really going to us.

YAML has standard ways to describe key-value pairs, lists, etc, but each 
application is free to define how something is described.

Yes, YAML is used in Rails and also other frameworks like symfony. 
(Doctrine is the default ORM for symfony and Sensio sponsor its ongoing 
development).

> Oh well, score 0 for cross platform/language coolness.

There is no standard for defining how to describe databases. YAML is 
simply a convenient format for use in config files for any 
language/framework).

Sorry for being unclear...  A defacto standard is fine for me as well.  If
"most people" do things a certain way that's good enough.  A documented
standard is even better.

Kind of like XML can be used to contain lots of data, and then there are
standardized formats for particular kinds of data.

The benefit of XML or YAML would be that you can include those platform
specific features, and if your DB doesn't support it, it just ignores it and
leaves it to the application to implement if needed.

There is far too much that's not cross platform. e.g.:


   - UUID/Guid column types
   - How do I mark an integer artificial key as auto increment (in MS SQL
   its called interval)
   - Can I name my primary key (and how do I drop the foreign key)
   - Table partitioning
   - Filtered/partial indexing
   - triggers

Is he migrating the data from DB2 or using linked tables in access? There is
a difference.

Keep in mind, most of that list is not available or not generally used in
MySQL 4.x

Unfortunately, since most of the world is still MySQL 4,  open source
projects have to code for that - so I tend to avoid special functions.

Auto increment is really the only one that can be flaky, so a find/replace
does the job.

So I should have said, /for me/ SQL is pretty good for cross database engine
definitions.

If my requirements were "higher level language for representing databases
designed with erwin/db2 and implemented with access," I'd seek a higher
feature set then mysql 4.

If my requirements were "something andromeda like for new open source
projects targeted at shared hosting" I'd go with mysql 5 or postgres.

If my requirements were "schema designer for drupal/joomla extensions" and
the decision of mysql 4 was therefore made for me, Then I'd assume mysql 4
level SQL.

Now,with all that being said, If I were pre-dispositioned towards
referential integrity and schema being handled in the app level (which I am
not, big surprise), I'd use mongo for new developement. With its ability to
define stored procs in javascript, and, and 10gen listening to the
community, its a sure win.

Essentially this is what a lot of frameworks do when using XML/YAML to 
describe schema.

I've never been able to justify buying a big flash developer package just to
play around with flash....

But from what I've skimmed, flex/air means you can use the compiler and
don't need the big full flash developer app..

Is that true?  And if so, what would I need to play around?

I mainly want to play with scripts that parse feeds than do something with
them, so I can adjust the parsing or such.  Not worrying about changing
front end design.

Yes, it's true.  You'll need the Flex SDK - http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Flex+SDK

The Flex Builder is a commercial product that is the easiest thing to use to build Flex/Air projects, but you don't need it.  You can code mxml and actionscript and compile it on the command line.

There's also a pretty big community of people that have open source tools for all sorts of stuff related to flash development:
http://osflash.org/projects

There's even an open source actionscript compiler but it only works with actionscript 2:  http://osflash.org/mtasc

Ultimately, if you get serious about creating flash stuff, I think you'll probably want the commercial products from Adobe.  They usually offer 30-day trials of their products which could be enough time for you to play around, but the open source stuff is definitely another good way to get your feet wet without making an investment.

    To stick up for Adobe (which I rarely do),  I will say that the 
flash authoring tool from Adobe is pretty awesome. 

    The quality of the authoring tool,  I believe,  is one of the big 
reasons why Flash has been successful.  Somebody with a visual 
arts/graphic design background can pick up the tools,  do the 
tutorials,  and be making amazing animations in hours.

    From the viewpoint of a developer,  it's not quite so amazing,  but 
personally,  if you're interested in doing Flash and if you think your 
time is worth more than $0 an hour,  the Flash authoring tool is a 
worthwhile investment.

    On the flipside,  I've been doing Silverlight for the last two years 
and I think it's a much better environment,  for developers,  than Flash 
is,  constrained by the problem that not so many people have it 
installed.  The app contains a mapping system which is vastly more 
powerful than anything I've seen in a web-based application,  be it 
Google Maps or something flash-based.  Although it's not quite as 
featureful,  it draws complex maps as quickly as ARC/GIS does and makes 
our competitor's Flash-based and Javascript-based apps look entirely 
uncompetitive.

    Other than that,  I also tend to be disappointed w/ the performance 
of AIR apps.  One of my major complaints about the desktop twitter 
clients that are floating around is that most of them are AIR based,  
leak memory,  and cause all sorts of problems.  Hypothetically there's 
the advantage that AIR apps run on Macs,  but practically,  AIR apps 
spin the CPU on my mac at 100% (even when they are doing nothing) and 
make it sound like a helicopter taking off.

I have an issue.  first let me layout my site which is testing mode.  I am having problem with the php page that handles the form information.
the pages blocks are controlled by <div> statements, no tables.   there is a block on the top for the logo, below that is the content block, and to the right is the block for the tabs, then there is the footer block at the bottom of the page.  all of the pages work fine.  problem is when I test the php page to handle the form information, the tabs to the right with the index and the footer disappears and the thank you information from the form also appears.   In testing it, i remove the php part and run it and the blocks appears, when i re-enter the php portion of the code, they disappears again........any ideas

PS.  I am using wamp and have not configured the mail function in php.ini (that should not affect it should it ?)

Take a look at the XHTML ooutput of your PHP code. My guess is that you echo a 
line that closes the div or html tag prematurely. When you have the PHP code 
in place and look at the source of the resulting page it is often fairly easy 
to figure out where the problem is.

Hum.  Bug somewhere.  Lol

 

Why don't you test it out using another php module, even one doing next to
nothing.

 

I know echos and prints can really skew a layout.

 

A bug in the php will halt any rendering below the include, but I haven't
seen the code, so .

 

First, I'd try to identify where the bug is on the page or the php.  I'm
guessing the php.

 

A few experiments might help identify it.

 

Do you have display_errors on?

 

But, my money is on a php error.

Hum.  Bug somewhere.  Lol
 
Why don?t you test it out using
another php module, even one doing next to nothing.
 
I know echos and prints can really skew a
layout.
 
A bug in the php will halt any rendering
below the include, but I haven?t seen the code, so ?
 
First, I?d try to identify where the
bug is on the page or the php.  I?m guessing the php.
 
A few experiments might help identify it.
 
Do you have display_errors on?
 
But, my money is on a php error.

No, and the browser doesn't matter. You know, PHP is a server side scripting 
language....
And yea, turn display_errors on and leave it on. It is there for a reason.

Hello Everyone,

I'm designing a system that will work on a schedule. Users will submit data 
for processing into the database and then, every minute, a PHP script will 
pass through the db looking for unprocessed rows (marked pending) and 
process them.

The problem is, I may eventually have a few million records to process at a 
time. Each record could take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to 
perform the required operations on. My concern is making sure that the 
script, on the next scheduled pass, doesn't grab the records currently being 
processed and start processing them again.

Right now, I'm thinking of accomplishing this by updating a 'status' field 
in the database. So unprocessed records would have a status of 'pending', 
records being processed would have a status of 'processing' and completly 
processed record will have a status of 'complete'.

For some reason, I see this as ugly but that's the only way I can think of 
making sure that records aren't duplicatly processed. So when I select 
records to process, I'm ONLY selecting one's with the status of 'pending' 
which means they are new, unprocessed.

Is there a better, more eleqent way of doing this or is this pretty much it?

Thanks!
Anthony Papillion

I would generate a unique value for each pass (whether that's an auto
increment field in a table, a UUID, or something else is up to you). I
would add a field to your table(s), just like you were going to do
with status, to store this value.

When processing, do something along the lines of UPDATE table SET
new_field = unique_value WHERE new_field IS NULL (make sure new_field
is indexed). Then you process any records with a matching value in the
new field. This also has the benefit that, should a pass fail, you can
identify which records were part of that pass.

Michele,

Thank you for your input. I'm glad I seem to be on the right track here and 
I'm curious about what others might think of this method of walking the 
database too.

I hadn't thought about the additional logic part in the event of an error. 
How would you propose that be handled? Perhaps a 'current time' field that's 
updated after each operation?  We could assume that a 'current time' that's 
more than, say 15 minutes, is an indication of the row needing to be 
processed even though the status might be 'processing'. What do you think 
about that?

Thanks,
Anthony

Anthony,
 
I'd actually have to put some real thought into it.  I'm watching tv.
 
But, I think a timestamp would actually be ugly.
 
Some random id doesn't really tell you anything.
 
When I work with shell scripts, I actually capture the process id.
 
Then if the records are unprocessed and the process id is not running, then
I'd reprocess.
 
For some backend jobs, I use php.  Other times, I use bash or some other
scripting language.
 
That's actually what I believe the correct process is.  As jobs grow time
can grow as well, time stamps are not reliable.
 
Michele

Michele,
 
Thank you for your input. I'm glad I seem to be on the right track here and
I'm curious about what others might think of this method of walking the
database too.
 
I hadn't thought about the additional logic part in the event of an error.
How would you propose that be handled? Perhaps a 'current time' field that's
updated after each operation?  We could assume that a 'current time' that's
more than, say 15 minutes, is an indication of the row needing to be
processed even though the status might be 'processing'. What do you think
about that?

Hello Everyone,

I'm designing a system that will work on a schedule. Users will submit data
for processing into the database and then, every minute, a PHP script will
pass through the db looking for unprocessed rows (marked pending) and
process them.

The problem is, I may eventually have a few million records to process at a
time. Each record could take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to
perform the required operations on. My concern is making sure that the
script, on the next scheduled pass, doesn't grab the records currently being
processed and start processing them again.

Right now, I'm thinking of accomplishing this by updating a 'status' field
in the database. So unprocessed records would have a status of 'pending',
records being processed would have a status of 'processing' and completly
processed record will have a status of 'complete'.

For some reason, I see this as ugly but that's the only way I can think of
making sure that records aren't duplicatly processed. So when I select
records to process, I'm ONLY selecting one's with the status of 'pending'
which means they are new, unprocessed.

Is there a better, more eleqent way of doing this or is this pretty much it?

Thanks!

Anthony,
 
I'd have to actually look, but you may be able to kick the process off with
a system command and grab the process id at the same time.
 
Or kick the process off with some unique id that will help you grab the
exact process id after the fact.
 
One of the other guys, may have a more practice approach to this.

Michele

You might want to look at a queuing system to hold the input. Your
options are Microsoft message queuring apache mq and IBM tibco. I am
sure there are others Microsoft message queue is supported  by php and
built into windows.  apache probably is. Tibco is expensive.

They all will solve your problem of preventing duplicate processing.
Depending on the size of your input data you might want to store the
data in a file and just out a pointer to the file in the messages.

First off, always process in the smallest increment you can.  So don't grab
EVERY row, just grab ONE row and process it, then grab the next row and
process it... That allows you to run multiple, concurrent processors and
each one can grab the data they want.

Secondly....  there are many queing services already written,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue

As an oddball idea, instead of using a database store, to add an item to the
queue, json encode it and email it to a special address on the processing
server(s)....then configure your mail server to trigger a PHP script for
each email received and process it from there.  Then your email server will
give you queueing for free..

Well, from an admin viewpoint, I'd recommend a lot more thinking before 
doing this. The "script every minute" idea causes all sorts of issues on 
the server as well as the database. One hokey query, or one large 
dataset, and you can cause a lot of problems for the entire machine.

What I don't understand is why you need to have a cron job to deal with 
the user data. Why not have your processing script called when the user 
submits? This keeps your script from having to go through the entire 
database to find uncommitted changes. If you're going to have a 
gazillion row database aren't you going to be spending a lot of time on 
queries just to find those not committed?

One other possibility would be to have a second, separate database that 
stores the user input. Have a script that grabs a small number of rows, 
does it's thing, deletes the rows it just worked on, sleeps for a couple 
seconds, and then calls itself. That way your primary database isn't 
getting hit so hard, your secondary database is the one that has to do 
disaster recovery, you can split the machines up if load gets too much, 
and your SA team won't stuff you in a trashcan when your query trashes 
the system.

It simply means that you a have an error in your php coding. Fix the 
error and you'll see all the blocks again. It may still not work as 
you want, but at least the php part will not fail.

Hey Anthony,

I'd add two columns:

thingy_status
0 - not processed
1 - in process
2 - processed

process_pid
(int)

Basically I'm making an assumption that you're running your PHP code
on a *nix machine (linux, osx, commercial unix...) and each process
has a PID. Store the PID of the process acting on that row, that way
when the next worker looks for a row to process it can also check to
see if any pending records have been abandoned or left in an in
process state.

Keeps your logic clean and simple. Anything more sophisticated than
this and you might as well look into Amazon Queues. :-)

Disconnecting the submission and the processing is helpful in a lot of
situations. Sometimes you have a small amount of data that takes a lot of
processing. For example an ETL (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)  job that has a lot
of validation. If I am an expediting warehouse and I receive pick and ship
orders from online storefronts via XML files, I will want to make sure my
inventory database says I can fill the pick and ship orders. I might receive
these XML file via a web service that does basic schema validation and
returns a receipt of some kind.Those XML files can go into a queue (be it a
loading table, directory in a file system, MSMQ/ActiveMQ/TibcoQ or other
technology). At some point the files will be processed, pick and ship orders
put in another queue, a status message prepared for the storefront that
submitted the order.

This disconnect provides you several advantages. For one, "threading" gets
easier when you have a disconnect between submission and receiving. If
submission order is not that important, you can scale your submission and
processing ends separately. Second, your submitters don't have to wait for
you to process their data. They can wait for the report and deal with the
problems later. Third, you can schedule database writes to not occur during
peak read times.

Has anyone ever configured this?

I have followed several online suggestions and still no luck, a fail 
authentication error is all i receive from this:

CODE:
    <?php
    echo 'trying to connect' ;
    $server = 'SERVERNAME\INSTANCE';
    $link = mssql_connect($server, 'username', 'password');
    if (!$link) {
        die('Something went wrong while connecting to MSSQL');
    }
    ?>


Suggestions greatly appreciated.

If you have Zend installed on your server, can you call zend methods and instantiate objects in any script or is there some extra step you need to access Zend from PHP. Thanks.

Do you have TCP/IP enabled? That is turned off by default in MSSQL. Why? 
Because everyone needs it....

I'm actually kinda glad that Microsoft turns that off, because not
"everybody" needs it.

First of all, you don't need it if your application is on the same machine
as the SQL server. Second of all, if you don't know what your doing, you
don't want your SQL server open to the world. Third, its not that hard to
turn on once you know where to look. So its secure by default.

Don't get me wrong, I'd be all for a prompt during the install to turn on
TCP access and warn you of the risks. I also realize that most real world
usages of SQL server require TCP access. However, especially for the
developer and express editions, a few hoops to make it harder to hang
yourself is a good thing.

Ick..  No, Amazon Queues[and for that matter Amazon SimpleDB] are bad
solutions for this.

Both services run off a group of servers that will "eventually" be in sync.
 When you request data from an element, a sampling of the servers is checked
for the data and anything found is returned.  Next time you check, you get
another sampling.

So it is possible, for example, if you have message #123 and it is stored on
databases A,B,C

First time you request new messages, Amazon checks A,B and returns message
#123, clearing it off A and B

Second time you request new messages, Amazon checks B,C and returns message
#123, clearing it off C

So you can't have, for example, 5 different systems using the queue to find
the next message to process.


Seriously though, I think postfix is a much better "poor mans queue"...
 Send your requests individually by email, they are automatically queued for
delivery.  When you want to have 2 servers, do load balancing on the email.
 And since each message will be processed individually, it's just like
processing one by one on the webpage[PHP script is started
up...processes....ends and memory is reclaimed]..

Leam,

I spent a good part of last night thinking about this problem and I
came to the exact same conclusion you did: it's a useless charge of
resources. I think I'm going to take your advice and simply archive
the user input into the database but process it immediately when the
user submits it. A lot quicker and a lot leaner solution from a
resource standpoint.

Thanks for the input.

Anthony

Have a script that grabs a small number of rows, does it's thing, deletes the rows it just worked on, sleeps for a couple seconds, and then calls itself.

Assuming you're talking about the Zend Framework, and not some product.

Unless you bootstrap the autoloading, you'll generally need to include  
the appropriate class files.  This assumes that the "Zend" directory  
(top of the class hierarchy) is in your include_path

<?PHP
include_once 'Zend/Db/Table.php';

$myTable = new Zend_Db_Table(...);
?>

I agree, but working with especially SQL2008 professionally made me really 
deeply loathe this POS. I could give plenty of reasons, but that will be 
somewhat pointless here. Not to say others are better, the new MySQL workbench 
doesn't work on Server 2003 and is incapable of making remote connections. 
Which idiot decided that this sad excuse of a GUI tool is ready for prime 
time? Luckily they still offer the old tools, which work perfectly fine.
Maybe that is what I get for shying away from the command line....
In regards to TCP/IP and SQL2k5, how many apps run on the same server? Yea, 
there are some, but my guess is that in reality the vast majority connects 
remotely. Aside from that, security is a good thing, but then why is it 
allowed by default to use weak or even no sa password? Just asking 
rhethorically....

In addition to what was already said, you need to add the path to the Zend Framework libary to the php include_path ini setting.  This can be done in the php.ini file or at the top of your script with set_include_path.

Also, if you have pear installed and working:

pear channel-discover zfcampus.org
pear install zfcampus/ZF

Your pear path should be a part of your include path.

Anthony,

I'm not sure how the data will be submitted, but remember about user's
experience.

If you start processing just after user's input and processing will
take some time (based on the way the data will be submitted - HTML
form??), user (browser?) will probably have to wait for the response
from the server (complete the request). This will significantly impact
user's experience with the application.

If you're planning to process a lot of those requests, the load on the
server will impact response time.

Regards,
Marcin

Oh that's handy!

I've typically been doing the following:

cd <path-to-pear-libs>
wget http://zf-download-link
tar xzvf ZendFramework-X.Y.Z.tgz
ln -s ZendFramework-X.Y.Z/library/Zend

Which I suppose isn't as nice, but works quite well.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Enterprise/Commercial  CMS with Support?
Message-ID: <4B7AFFD2.1070406@nopersonal.info>

Can anyone kindly recommend a PHP/MySQL-based CMS that would be
appropriate for an enterprise situation? I've done some googling on the
subject, but I'm not coming up with much--maybe I'm not searching for
the right terms.

The CMS will be used for both a corporate intranet and a public web
site. In the future it will likely also be used across multiple domains.
It will be hosted on existing Windows servers/IIS that can be
reconfigured to play nice with PHP/MySQL (the client doesn't want to
switch to *nix/Apache).

The requirements (the first two being must-haves) are that it should:

1.) Offer 24/7 support

2.) Be very easy to use for the average, non-technical end user
accustomed to using MS Word (editors will likely be department heads)

3.) Allow for fairly fine-grained user privileges

4.) Support multiple calendars with the ability for users to download
events in Outlook/iCal format

5.) Provide automatic newsletter sign-up and allow for the distribution
of multiple newsletters

6.) Provide a search function

7.) Provide a community blog with typical options such as categories,
tags, search, archives (by month) email to a friend, etc.

8.) Allow multiple RSS feeds


Thanks,
Bev

static views that don't require dynamic data.  I did a quick search in the

Agreed. There's not many options in the PHP space, however if you are
platform agnostic you could give Alfresco a look. That's really their
sweet spot, so to speak.

Any idea why Google would disqualify the request I put in for my children's
school?

Their eligibility requirements are both explicit and vague:
http://www.google.com/grants/details.html#eligibility
 http://www.sudburyschool.org


The school is a registered non profit..  Practically all income comes from
tuition with a small amount of fundraising.  No commercial nature.  No
religious nature.

Seems like a perfect checklist, but they got a rejection notice which merely
points to that page with no reason given.

In addition, anyone know what sort of appeals process to go through?  Reply
to the email?  Fill out a form?  Or does anyone know people at google who
could direct me to the right individual?

Thanks for your time.

-Gary

Hi Gary -- does the school have 503(c)1 determination?  I've learned that
many schools operating in nonprofit-mode are operating under another
nonprofit parent.  I can verify status through ActiveCause (full-disclosure:
a portfolio investment) if you send me the nonprofit name off-list; or you
can search for the school using the IRS search engine:

http://www.irs.gov/app/pub-78/

If the school does not turn up in and ActiveCause investigation or IRS
search, it may be a subordinate org.

Maybe private schools fall under the "membership or providing benefits
solely to memebers" exclusion.  I really think they are looking for
causes to support rather than giving free adwords to help a private
school juice its enrollment numbers.

Perhaps.  Their program is fairly broad and they don't provide any
feedback[It is not atypical for this application to take 4-9 months to
process and they don't provide any updates on where it is in the queue]

I generally tell small businesses to avoid adwords because of Google's
method of juicing their pricing.   So I'm not even sure this is a legitimate
program, or if it is just a way Google uses to advertise the
program[figuring non profits will give up on waiting and just start paying
them].

Still, it is certainly their right to put any parameters on it they want.
 It would just be nice if they actually gave meaningful answers.  As it
is...I still recommend that those on a budget avoid adwords and I recommend
non profits apply for the Google grants and then forget about it for a year
till they hear back.

Thanks. I tried that list and gave up about halfway through as none of
them seemed to offer the sort of support the client would expect--i.e.
they want something that's backed by the company that owns the product,
and if there's a problem they expect to be able to pick up the phone and
talk to a representative who's going to address the issue ASAP.

Personally, I'm not sure what the point of open source products are if they
are so complex and difficult to use that you might as well be using
a proprietary system.

When I saw this thread come up, I had so much hope for it.  I was hoping to
learn something really exciting about the CMS world.  

I suggest you reach out to Todd Rengal with Animus Rex
(http://www.animusrex.com).  They offer a CMS called Escort which is
enterprise ready and fits your requirements.  Tell him Hans sent you.

Only the non-profits that charge tuition or a membership fee would be
excluded.  I know of a google grants recipient that provides
tutoring/mentoring for inner city kids.  It is in the education
sphere.  Teach for America has google grants.

Typical google.  No one there is allowed to say anything about
anything.  They are so paranoid about making all external
communication come from the highest levels, that their individual
support is terrible.

Adwords is hard.  It is easy to burn through a ton of money if you
don't know what you are doing.

Thank you, Hans.

BTW, I was tickled to see Lucy on your web site as I lived in Ventnor
for about a year. I also got a kick out of the road sign theme &
humor--any web site that can make me smile is a winner in my book. :)

	Numerals?
Message-ID: <F4BBAD55-97A3-4BCE-BC00-6FFE44849A89@gmail.com>

Hi Folks.

I didn't come up with this method, I'm just the one who has to deal  
with it. :-)

The year is represented most of the time in this format:

(2000)

This regular expression in preg_match to extract it has been working  
fine:
	preg_match('/\((19|20)[0-9][0-9]\)/',$line,$found);

However, other times it is represented with Roman Numeral version  
control when there is more than one version:

(2000/I)
or
(2000/II)

So far it looks like the version control goes out to three Roman  
Numbers. Like I said, I didn't come up with this.

It would be just peachy if some kind person here could show me an  
elegant way to handle this in PHP (as a regular expression?) which  
might  be, for example, either (2000) or (2000/V). Thanks in advance!

Hi David,

I've added the roman numerals to your regex, now it will match either 
just the year (2000) or the year + the roman numeral (2000/I) up to VIII 
(I know you said it goes up to III, but you never know)

preg_match('/\((19|20)[0-9][0-9](\/(I{1,3}|IV|VI{0,3}))?\)/',$line,$found);

I haven't fully tested it though (did run it on (2000), 
(2000/I)-(2000/VIII) but that was it).

Also this is still case sensitive, don't know if that matters...

Rene

Message-ID: <4bffc351002210708t796e213doe026f6f2d1f95488@mail.gmail.com>

Off Topic, but I figured I'd post this in case anyone is interested in some
of the items on the list:

As I believe I posted about previously, their doing a fundraiser to expand
the cancer center at the local hospital my oldest brother passed away at
last year.
http://www.huntingforacure.info/ is the basic website I setup for them
because I just couldn't bear looking at it much[and it looks MUCH better
know thanks to Laura Gordon going in and applying a much better template and
layout!]

Today is the fundraising event[though we are almost at the goal already!]

They have a number of items they will be running a silent auction on:
http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=427194725514&topic=1179<http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=427194725514&topic=11790>
0 <http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=427194725514&topic=11790>


Which includes some items that might appeal to a broader interest:
Sports memorabilia (baseball signed by Mickey Mantle and Willy Meyes
*Guitar signed by Bono
[I am assuming those were pulled out of some personal collections by family]

**Spend a day with a chef! (this includes a $500 food and wine allowance) -
Chef Elizabeth E. Briggs a 23 year Chef / Professor of the Culinary
Institute of America and Chef Owner of Cooking For Transformation LLC. Will
spend the day with you and your 6 guests in your own home kitchen.
 <http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=427194725514&topic=11790>[and a lot
of favors and a lifetime of good karma cashed in]

So if there is something on the list that you would like and your not going,
feel free to email sales at huntingforacure.info and let Danielle know!

Well, people will be happy to know I'll shut up about this now.

Between a sizable last minute anonymous donation and the high value items in
the auction, they made the goal of 10,000 since starting this fundraiser
officially back in January.  10,000 in 2 months that I credit mainly to a
lifetime of good deeds and a lot of energy on Danielle's part.

So I am a mostly happy camper tonight.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Web 2.0 "how to talk like you know something"
	presentation
Message-ID: <4bffc351002251457mf19998cq175a15b28e53952@mail.gmail.com>

Over the winter break in Decemember, a lot of NYPHP's posted various amusing
presentations done tongue in cheek at various conventions.

One of which was MongoDB for DBA's.

However, another of which[or I just ended up seeing it as a related video]
was about "How to talk about Web 2.0 like you know what your talking
about"..

Basically a presentation on keywords to throw into conversations to act like
you know stuff.

I was talking to a friend the other day and she mentioned how she got so
sick of the word "dynamic" 5-6 years ago since she had to use it in every
proposal she did at her company, multiple times.  And I was going to show
her this video because it was so funny.

But now I can't find it!

So, NYPHP's, come to my rescue and give me a laugh.  I really need it today.
 Pull out your most outrageous BSing presentation, bonus points for those
who can find the one I refer to based on so little info.  [Mitch, you need
not apply. :-)]

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Eclipse, try try again
Message-ID: <4bffc351002252024rf371791qe0d86eea7b59b1ce@mail.gmail.com>

Well, despite not liking it...I'm giving eclipse yet another try as every
other system I've tried has small failings that irk me here and there.

The biggest issue I have with eclipse is the PHP code folding.

It seems somewhat arbitrarily limited, as it does not fold if/then clauses.
 Switch clauses...  Etc.  Basically, anything
{

}

Should be able to be folded.

I was wondering if anyone can give me a clue on where to hunt around for to
add some extra code folding?  I suppose if I am looking for the above, I
might as well also look for creating custom manual fold tags as well.

Too many little consoles..  :-)

Which is the main item which has put me off.

Written in Java and needing to know Java to do a lot of extending of
Eclipse[though with PDT going to a markup language for rules, I might be
able to do quite a bit there]

Oddities with network connections:  I went through half a dozen install
processes, and each one broke irrepairably at some point.

Too many versions: which one to use?

PHP code folding inadequacies:  just doesn't fold everything the other IDE's
I've used can.

Source Class browsing failures:  I've yet to see a function like Ultraedit
where an entire project of files is kept up to date for the class/function
browsers.  OTOH you can emulate all this functionality if you document your
code as it will pick up documentation in standard formats.  So here the
"downside" is a matter of getting really good at commenting code that should
be commented anyway!

My setup:

I ended up with the all in one PDT installer. Then I added in the Bzr
plugins for source code repositories.  Then I REMOVED Mylin and installed
the latest version of Mylin....
Then I installed the Mylin/Eclipse Redmine plugin[and installed the server
side 2.6 plugin on my server].  Finally, the one item that caused weird
problems when I installed originally, I loaded the RSE plugins[Remote Server
Environment].  Note: the local one caused me to be unable to open local PHP
files, so the 3rd time around I specifically excluded that one.

I added my Redmine server to the task servers[small nit here: under the
current setup, I cannot get a list of /all/ issues.  I have to add project
by project, and sub project by sub project.  Gotta find out why and fix
that]

Now, outside the "project" concept as I was debugging code that was offsite,
then for the Remote Servers I added my FTP and SFTP servers and was able to
browse those repositories online and open the files directly.  [Note: small
nit here, a LOT of the tools I wanted are kind of hidden.  I had to keep
going to Window->ShowView->Other to get a long list of windows to find a lot
of these things.


Ok, so with all this setup, I had 3 features to change.  So I opened the
first task in my project in eclipse, checked the spec, hit activate, and
then hunted around for the files on the server.  Finally found the oddball
layout and located the 2 PHP files that needed minor changes to.  Updated
and tested them.  Then when I was done, I went back to the task and used the
feature I am now in love with: there will be a tab to "Add Context".....
click on that and you have a list of all open files[or is it files you have
opened?]..   Clicked save and I believe it generates an XML file of all the
file paths/files and zips them up, then it gets attached to the issue.  Next
I close the issue.

So NEXT time I have to make a small change, I can go back to this issue and
open the context from Eclipse and it will automatically open the files from
the FTP server for me.

Second feature, again changed 2 files.  This time I had to dig through a
dozen files to find the area to change and had left them open.  As an
experiment, I went to add context and sure enough, lots of stuff I did not
change was there.  But I could right click and remove items from the context
that were not relevant, and then save them.

Soo... that one feature has me sold.  It was quick and easy and I will live
with all the other little annoyances for now to be able to easily record
which files were changed directly into my project management tool AND be
able to open them later[it's easy to add changed files by adding an issue
keyword to the files and checking into version control - Bazaar can check
files for keywords in the commits and files and update the issue id number
as needed - but that is one way communication, wheras this two way
communication is great!]

BTW, I have no objection to paying for a decent IDE.  I felt the $300 I paid
for Komodo IDE years ago was money well spent.

So I'm not fixated on "free".

I am however fixated on must run on Mac and Windows and preferably Linux.

I go from my macbook at work to windows at home.  And sometimes fire up
Linux on older laptops because it runs just fine for what I need and avoids
speed issues.

I hate going from platform to platform learning new tools.  Which is why
I've stuck with one for so long...

Hrmm, interesting. I've been using PDT for a while and never missed it.

I seem to remember phpeclipse doing that. Give that a shot?

Have you tried aptana? It was built for ror, but they took over pydev
and have a php plugin as well.  I just started using it and its pretty
decent (not sure about the code folding).

Aptana was what convinced me to try Eclipse again.

I gave it a shot and it installed and looked layed out the way I think.
 However, doing Aptana as a stand alone I had all kinds of problems with
trying to get eclipse plugins to install PLUS they have discontinued their
PHP plugin and plan on donating code from that to PDT.  So you still have to
use PDT[which is a shame, because their plugin had a much better feature
set....  it was limited in that it did not support the new PHP 5.3
functions, but since I'm not using 5.3 it didn't bother me]

For me that was a deal breaker.

Me as well.  I'm a fan of UltraEdit, which released a Linux version in

Ah, I installed it as the eclipse plugin and I saw the option to
install their php plugins, so I figured I'd chime in.

True story:  I have a colleague who bid on a project and was expected to be the winning bid.  However, another bidder used the phrase "Web 2.0" in their proposal and for that reason alone the project was awarded to the other bidder!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Over the winter break in Decemember, a lot of NYPHP's posted various amusing
presentations done tongue in cheek at various conventions.

One of which was MongoDB for DBA's.

However, another of which[or I just ended up seeing it as a related video]
was about "How to talk about Web 2.0 like you know what your talking
about"..

Basically a presentation on keywords to throw into conversations to act like
you know stuff.

I was talking to a friend the other day and she mentioned how she got so
sick of the word "dynamic" 5-6 years ago since she had to use it in every
proposal she did at her company, multiple times.  And I was going to show
her this video because it was so funny.

But now I can't find it!

So, NYPHP's, come to my rescue and give me a laugh.  I really need it today.
Pull out your most outrageous BSing presentation, bonus points for those
who can find the one I refer to based on so little info.  [Mitch, you need
not apply. :-)]

+1 on UltraEdit (which does code folding correctly!)

They also have UEStudio

I think the folding problem is probably in the PHP plugin for Eclipse 
rather than Eclipse itself.

Ultraedit is a fantastic editor, but I really want a full fledged IDE.
 UEStudio is my first choice when they finally go cross platform. :-)

True, and it should also be relatively simple to fix.  I am assuming code
folding intelligence is just basically a large pattern matching database to
locate all the folds properly.

In that sense, it is more a matter of deliberate design than not being able
to.  The only problem I have is I don't  know where that database is stored.

I think the point is that Eclipse was designed for Java and someone stapled on 
support for PHP that in some cases has some issues. I am not surprised. It's 
like using VisualStudio to write Delphi code.

Crap, all my default bids will need to be updated. Paradigm Shift,
Disruptive Technology, Web2.0, 360 Degree View of the Customer, all my
favorites are gone.

Seriously though, what phrases are the current climate seeing tumble
from "wired" to "tired"?

As silly as the buzzwords are and we can laugh about them, it's a  
short-cut to people doing evaluations for a field they know very  
little about. We all do this. I know nothing about blenders, so I look  
in Consumer Reports and gather buzzwords on what to look for. I don't  
have the time or desire to become a food appliance design engineer  
just to select a blender for consumer use, even though I want a good  
one.

This just shows how much you have to talk with the perspective clients  
to understand what's important to them. I'm not saying they always  
know what's best, but being able to successfully figure out what's  
important to them can be key. What's important to them might be  
considered lame to the proposal writer, but it's about getting the work.

Web 2.0?  OMG, I've been using Web 3.0 for a year now in my pitches.   
Sprinkle in 'The Network Effect and the new Semantic features that  
embodies' and you're back in the game.

And of course: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube viral marketing across the  
mobile always on connected landscape   ---  OMG that's so January  
2010.  ;-)

Just repeat: iPad, iPad, iPad.   Now we're talking.  Gets them  
everytime. ;-)

Now that I'm getting into Redmine...  I find many things I want to
consolidate tracking there.

I was wondering how others use project tracking tools to keep track of
technical debt:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt

As it seems to me I'd like to make sure that the technical debt accrued on a
project is listed there and all in one place.  Technical debt looks like a
great bucket to go through when one needs a break from the "mind drain" and
a change of gears, so if it is in the tool to begin with that helps quite a
bit.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] RDBMS Applications with Good User and Group Management?
Message-ID: <78c6bd861002270954k2c14424amea69468de23ad410@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I need an RDBMS application that has a decent UI for managing users
and groups to demo a generic security API I'm working on. I was
thinking about Joomla maybe but I'm interested in other suggestions.
It doesn't even have to be PHP or Linux but preferably it should be
something Free that everyone will have access to and preferably
something either very popular or very small.

More specifically, I'm working on a security API that handles client
and server authentication, creating, updating and deleting accounts
and groups, manipulating group membership, checking group membership,
setting and changing passwords, and so on. I have various
implementations of this API for protocols like Kerberos and LDAP and
now I would like to create an example implementation that uses a
traditional relational database like Oracle or MySQL. But rather than
create an entirely custom database, I thought I would just use an
existing application that installs it's own database and includes a UI
for user and group management.

So can anyone suggest a preferably small, popular, Free RDBMS
application with a good UI for CRUD operations on accounts and groups?
