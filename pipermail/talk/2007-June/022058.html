Or if you don't know how to get around with AJAX or such, have the users 
upload the image files as a zip archive. Depenging on which images you 
want to allow, adding a few .bmp files may quickly fill up the submit 
buffer of the server and / or PHP.
I finished just last week such an uploader and I must say, I am still 
impressed on how quickly I could jam 800 images into the system (in 
chunks of 100 due to server upload limits). In all fairness, I did this 
while being local to the server, but anything else would be upload time 
which depends on client-server connection. I did add a URL load option 
as well, so that one could upload the archive first via FTP to the web 
server and then have the server download it from itself or a different 
FTP or web server assuming the connection between the two servers is 
significantly faster than from the client to the target server. I also 
made it so that users can have the image files in any amount of subfolders.

Or you could do that with PHP and by using a script that calls itself. 
But I really don't recommend this as this requires not only an entire 
page reload each time, but mandates the full submission of the form each 
round - with the already specified image files. This is the dumb stuff I 
did three years ago when starting with PHP. Don't do it, that approach 
sucks. Besides that, since HTML has such a crappy file upload control 
you will get into other trouble for sure.


I couldn't have done my 'turboloader' without the help from the great 
NYPHP folks. So, any way you go, you will find help here.
