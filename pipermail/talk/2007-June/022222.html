<PRE>I can only offer my experience, which I hope will help some.

The best employees I've ever had for difficult or changing situations 
were those with general problem-solving skills.  In my two best cases, 
neither knew anything about the programming language we were using or 
the database when they were hired,but they quickly became invaluable and 
productive.  In both cases their resumes spoke of their basic 
intelligence and when I met them I like them, so I hired them (or begged 
the powers to be to hire them). 

As for questions, its good to have a formal test you ask them to take, 
but interviewing is an art you can only get good at with practice.  The 
usual advice applies, be yourself, ask questions about things that are 
important to you, and see how the person responds.  Also check with HR 
to find out what you are *not* allowed to ask, anything that could be 
construed to be a basis for discrimination like age.

If you like somebody and think they will work out, ask them to come back 
and invite in 2 or 3 of their potential coworkers and have a short 
brainstorming session on a problem you have at the moment.  See what 
they contribute.
