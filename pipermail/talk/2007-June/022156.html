<PRE>Hi Ben,

I think the &quot;going rate&quot; largely depends on where you're getting your talent from and where they are going to work from. People who live and/or work in NYC or the tri-state area are going to cost a little more than, say, someone like me who works and lives in the midwest. Since our cost of living and dowing business is substantially lower than many other parts of the country, our rates are going to be a lot lower too - and still be considered good by our, midwestern, standards. I think that's why there is a new focus on &quot;insourcing&quot; or &quot;outsourcing within US borders but in lower cost areas&quot;.

So, if you're wanting to reduce costs, start by looking at where the generators of your primary costs are and see how you can reduce that. I can guarantee that you can get the same level of talent, the same level of performance, at much lower rates WITHOUT having to leave the USA.

Hope this helps,
Anthony

  Hello All, 

  Hope all the fathers are having a nice day today.

  Lately, I've been really getting into the cost structure and finicial forces at work within my company.

  While attempting to refine our overhead cost calculations, I've begun to break up jobs
  by the time spent doing one of many tasks:

  Information Architecture - Creating the database, flowcharting, high and low level details.
  Graphic Design - Creating the actual graphics, .pngs, .gifs, etc.
  User Interface Creation - Designing the UI and Wireframes.
  Programming - Heads down coding.
  Testing - Q/A
  Deployment - Pushing the site live.
  Support - After the site is live ... this is everying EXCEPT fixing bugs (we don't charge for that!).

  I'm trying to find the &quot;going-rates&quot; for such activities. Is there a standard right now, 
  or a place to find this information online.

  Thanks.

  - Ben
