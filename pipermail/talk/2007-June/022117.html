Are you using the default php session handler?  I was just reading a  
thread in Zend Framework discussion where they were suggesting that  
with a custom db session handler, it could be possible for a read of  
the session to happen (mainly in an ajax based app) before the  
previous request finished writing it.  That doesn't make sense though  
with how this would only ever happen to two specific users.  That  
definitely sounds like a browser/os issue.  Unless there is something  
specific about data for these users that causes it to not get written  
properly.  Is their entire session data cleared out?  Or only what  
was written by that form submission?

I actually was troubleshooting a session issue that I had with a user  
on one of our sites and it turned out that his OS time was set far  
enough in the future that it was causing the session cookie be  
immediately expired .  I could only reproduce that on IE/Windows  
though... Firefox seemed to figure it out.

I know this is the easy way out... but if you're writing the form  
data to a database, you could just read it from the database on the  
&quot;Thanks&quot; page instead.
