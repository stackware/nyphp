<PRE>Hello All, 

I've asked some questions similiar to this in the past .. but would like to get additional
information and hopefully some real feedback from those who have experiance with it.

We currently have a paypal merchant account that we use to collect payments from customers with.

We are releasing a product that will offer a monthly subscription. I'd like to use our existing paypal
account to handle the billing. I've looked into the subscription text on paypal, and I understand it fine.

What I'm not sure about doing is this:

When a visitor decides to purchase our software (its web based) and signs up for the account
I need to get their data into paypal. Now, once they finish the transaction, I want to return them 
to my software, and if they successfully completed the paypal signup I will automagically create
their account.

I also want to be able to query paypal every month to make sure they have paid, and if not, possibly
suspend their account.

So my question is: Does anyone have experiance using the paypal IPN (i believe that is what its called),
or experiance with another merchant account that allows this type of integreation? 
Also, could you recommened other merchant accounts and include some comparision against paypal?

Thanks!
- Ben
