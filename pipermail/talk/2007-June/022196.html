</I>These are being called &quot;site links&quot; and are intended to show the 
searcher how a site has clearly-defined user interest areas, to help 
them in their search.

It is believed that user click data is being used to help determine the 
need for site links, although some SEO people have been teasing Google 
this year and there are now some sites showing site links that probably 
shouldn't have them ;-)

Most people I know think site links are based mostly on site structure 
and back links.

If your site qualifies (searchers would benefit from site links as 
search navigation aids)  then a good SEO would probably guide you by 
suggesting that you:

- get inbound links from on-theme trusted sources TO your desired site 
link demarcation page, and make sure the page it titled and has H1/2 
tags that match the theme exactly. e.g. get job sites to link back to 
/human-resources/index.html and make sure that page is titled &quot;human 
resources&quot; and has a h1/h2 set to match that specific theme.
- make sure the site nav goes to that same demarcation page using the 
same title/htag-matching anchor text
- add some internal text links to refer people to that same demarcation 
page with matching context words and anchor text (be your own best friend)

A more advanced SEO would probably suggest you mine your own traffic 
logs and find the pages that Google ranks for &quot;human resources&quot;, 
&quot;careers&quot;, &quot;jobs&quot; etc and add a section to those (in H tags) that tells 
visitors that if they are looking for human resources (link) for careers 
at mycompany (link) they should go to the human resources page (link).  
In cases where the destnation page for incoming Google referrals 
on-theme was not important, 301 redirect it to the human resources page.

Personally, I would do that last step first.

I hope that helps.
