That and an extreme lack of sleep. Unfortunately, that sloppiness has
infected a good part of my codebase over the last two days since I've
gone through it and changed things to try to get the code to work. A
cleanup job is definitely in order.

&gt;<i> In either case, are you using the double quotes around your variables to

</I>
No, I did not need to typecast my variables. Hadn't even noticed the
double quotes around them. They weren't there when I started this, I
swear! lol

&gt;<i> You mention that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The final variable (media) should contain the binary data of the file
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In that case, the following code might be what one would expect to use?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> $post = array(
</I>&gt;<i>     'cmd' =&gt; 'uploadmessage',
</I>&gt;<i>     'session' =&gt; $_SESSION[sid], // No need for double quotes
</I>&gt;<i>     'message_guid' =&gt; $msg_guid, // No need for double quotes
</I>&gt;<i>     'file_name' =&gt; &quot;$file_name.mov&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     'media' =&gt; file_get_contents($target_path) // Assigning the binary
</I>&gt;<i> file data
</I>&gt;<i> );
</I>
You're very right. THAT code seems to work with no problem at all. Well,
there *is* a problem, but I think it's on the server side as it seems to
think that there is no 'cmd' variable being passed. Yet, when I
print_r($post) I can clearly see that 'cmd' is being passed. Weird.  But
anyway, YOUR code does indeed work! Thank you for the corrections!

&gt;<i> Also, purely judging from the variable name, it looks like $baseURL
</I>&gt;<i> might be pointing to a local URI or only a URL fragment? Is that what
</I>&gt;<i> was intended?
</I>
Right. $baseURL has the HTTP address to the API (something like
www.sitename.com/api). I'm using that so I don't have to type out a long
site name over and over as this snippet is part of 9 different calls I
have to make to the API to get a file uploaded and operated on.

Again, thank you *very* much for the help. It is much appreciated. The
use of file_get_contents() never even entered my head and I totally
missed the double quotes.

Thanks!
Anthony
