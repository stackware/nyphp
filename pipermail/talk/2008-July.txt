True. It is not proper way. But if you still want to pass such data using GET 
method then you can build Query string as shown below:

$cartStr='cart[0]=val1&cart[1]=val2';   // assuming that array keys are 
numeric.

This $cartStr string can be appended to URL where request is to be forwarded 
to. On that receiving page you can have that array in form of $_GET['cart']; 
which you can use for your purposes.

Remember if values in $cart is *sensitive* then neither GET nor POST is safe. 
Use session instead to store data on server only.

You can take advantage of the mechanism in PHP that's used to use 
arrays in forms:

<?php
$cart = array('item one','item two','item three');
$urlstr = 'gallery.php?final[]=' . implode('&final[]=',$cart);
echo '<a href="' . $urlstr . '">Go</a>';
?>

Then in gallery.php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['final']))
     echo implode("<br>\n",$_GET['final']);
?>

Thanks for everyone answer my question!
 
One further question:
if
url=galleryform.php?$cartStr='cart[0]=val1&cart[1]=val2';
 
then
On gallery.php page:
<?php$totalcart=new array()
$totalcart=$_GET['cartStr']
for($x=0;$x<$totalcart[].length;$x++)
{echo   $totalcart[$x];
}  ?>
 
Is gallery.php coding is correct?I want to output array.
 
Thanks again!

url would have to be 'galleryform.php?cart[0]=val1&cart[1]=val2'
(i'm not sure if you can use brackets [] in a URL either)

or something of that nature.  remember, a querystring has to consist  
of key=value pairs (or it can be just one value if a single 
parameter)...and it will automatically BE an array after it is passed 
to the receiving page -- $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'];

Hi there.

I exported this create table statement from an existing table of  
mine.  I was just wondering if someone would enlighten me as to why my  
"edi_updated" timestamp column is not auto-updating when a record is  
updated?

Cheers,

Marc

   `edi_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `edi_title` int(10) unsigned default NULL,

With the context of PHP, above mentioned array format is also supported for 
both GET and POST method. Remember HTTP just passes whatever Query_String you 
have passed to it. It is PHP's feature that it converts both single and 
double dimensional arrays in equivalent super globals array like $_GET, 
$_POST etc.

foreach{} is better than this. Study PHP manual about how to implement it.

Shouldn't it auto update by default?

alter table <tablename> modify edi_updated timestamp NOT NULL;

Wouldn't that auto update it anyway?

I think the default is to insert the current timestamp on creation of 
new row and not change that value even if row is updated... ?

I remember I had some fun with phpMyAdmin trying to figure out how they 
had this set up.

If I remember correctly, it will update the first timestamp record 
automatically.

For instance:

CREATE TABLE test (
 	field1 varchar(50) NOT NULL,
 	field2 timestamp NOT NULL,
 	field3 timestamp NOT NULL
 	);

will update field2 on insert AND update.  field3 will not be touched.

Well, my guess would be because your code tells it not to.  For 
example,  if your using some nice object oriented code, where you do 
something like:
-----
// set some edition id value
$ediid = 123;

// load the edition data
$myedi = new editionClass($ediid);

// set a 20% discount - ideally this data should actually
// have come from someone, ie entered on a form perhaps
// by the user
$discount = .80;
$newprice = $myedi->getField('edi_price') * $discount;

// update the price of the edition
$myedi->setField('edi_price', $newprice);

// update the record
$myedi->update();
----

or if you prefer a condensed coding style:
------
// get the edition
$myedi->new editionClass($ediid);
//set the discount, ideally this is provided by a user instead
// of hardcoded
$discount=.80;
// make our changes and update the record
$myedi->setDiscount($discount)->updateRecord();
------

The above generates a long update clause such as:
UPDATE EDITIONS
SET EDI_TITLE='$this->edi_title',
...
EDI_UPDATED=$this->edi_updated,
...
WHERE EDI_ID = $this->edi_id

(though of course, your using the safer syntax where you bind the 
variables instead of writing it out directly - it's just easier to write 
this way)

In which case, since your code explicitly specified what the update 
timestamp should be(and since you did not change the value, it is the 
original timestamp) the field will not be updated.

Just a guess though, since I don't have your code here. :-)

Hi:

I had just wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy and my  
understanding of how MySQL (5.0.25 is my version) works was not  
flawed.  It seems from the responses here that I've got the column  
declared properly, at least.

I originally asked the question because I have a different table, with  
basically the exact same setup.  (The data titles, and editions, of  
software products, in this case the editions mean versions of a title  
on a different platform.  so the "title" might be "Photoshop" and the  
edition would be "Windows, Mac, etc.".)

What is odd is that the title table's timestamp is auto-updating  
whenever a title is modified, and the editions table isn't.  Both  
tables have only one timestamp column and the structure is very similar.

This is from the title table:

   `ttl_updated` timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP on  
update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

This is from the edition table:

   `edi_updated` timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP on  
update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

I'm checking out my code now to see if there's a difference in the  
editions update form vs. the titles update form, but both forms run  
through the same framework.

Very odd...perhaps just an idiotic mistake of mine somewhere.


Cheers,

Marc

An easy way to test would be to do  a meaningless update from NaviCat, 
phpmyAdmin, the mysql command line, or whatever you prefer to use to run 
SQL commands manually.

For each table, update a single record and make a change to the title or 
some other text field, and then change it back.

Then pull up the 2 records and see if the timestamp updated 
appropriately in both tables.

If it did, than you know there is a problem in your code somewhere.

Note: just because one table works and one doesn't, does not mean the 
update timestamp field is working in one and not the other - it is very 
possible that your code actually updates the timestamp explicitly in one 
case to the current timestamp, while in the other it updates it to 
current value explicitly.

Since you say your using 5.0, if you have control over your mysql server 
I'd recommend enabling the general query log and checking that rather 
than tediously going through your code to find what the update 
statements are.  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/query-log.html 

That will tell you precisely what SQL commands are sent to the server.

Please also make sure that data is really getting modified. For example if you 
edit record by various ways but actual data residing in fields are not 
changing then MySQL would not update timestamp.

You could write this a little more simply as:

$parts = explode('|',$y);
$cnt = count($parts);

for ($i = 0;$i < $cnt - 1;$i += 2) {
   echo $parts[$i] .' '. $parts[$i+1] ."<br/>\n";
}

Is this the same thing that you are trying to accomplish with the
for loop?
for($Sub1=0,$Sub2=1;$Sub2<=$Count;)
{
   echo "<br />$Parts[$Sub1] $Parts[Sub2]\n";
   $Sub1+=2;
   $Sub2+=2;
}

I just want to know if I read it correctly.

Thanks,

This works (tested)

<?php
$y="tnk81|98.8$|yuhj78t|32.6$|tris78y|459.78$";
$Parts = explode("|",$y);
$Count = count($Parts);

Yes but increments (or decrements) are executed much more efficiently 
than additions.

$p=explode('|',$y);
while ($p) {
        echo array_shift($p).' '.array_shift($p)."\n";

This is wrong for three reasons:
1) 4 ++ increments is 2.5x slower than one increment by two.
2) Unless you are using an opcode cache, any gains from faster
execution are probably lost by the additional parsing required.  Of
course this depends of the number of elements in the loop.
3) Unreadable code is orders of magnitude more expensive than the
performance benefit.

Ignoring #3, the fastest way to write it is something like:

$p = explode('|',$y);
for($i=0,$c = count($p);$i<$c;) {
echo $p[$i++],' ', $p[$i++], "<br>\n";
}

Removing the string concatenation is more beneficial than any
increment / decrement hacking.

John C.

I believe this will miss the first element of $p; you need instead:

for ( $i = -1, $c = count( $p ); $i < $c; ) {

Although calling count() repreatedly is also more expensive than doing it
once and saving its value in a variable, isn't it?

and.... aren't you glad this guy asked this question?

The code doesn't call count repeatedly because it is in the first part
of the for loop.

If you start from -1, then you would need to use ++$i rather than $i++

Starting from -1 and using ++$i would be faster than what I wrote.

No.  $i++ returns the value of $i, then increments it.

Geek fight!

I think that all the time spent debating this issue far exceeds the 
time actually saved between using one technique as compared to the 
other over the next 100+ years.

It's interesting to see what we get our collective shorts in a knot about.  :-)

Cheers,

Starting at -1 to avoid using ++$i seems way more confusing than starting at
0 and using $i++.  As someone mentioned above, confusing code will offset
any computation savings you gain.

And in the interest of being as clear as possible here, and not to 
mislead any lurkers or anybody who can be as dumb as I can:

I was wrong when I said "this will miss the first element." The reason 
is that echo $p[$i++] first echoes $p[$i] and only then increments $i; 
it does *not* echo element $i++ as I must have been thinking (out of 
stupidity or inattention or whatever) when I wrote that.

Hi Dan,

It's a good idea, but this application is accessed worldwide for read 
and write by various affiliates.  I wouldn't want to put the central 
server behind this slow connection.  But one idea is, if we're going to 
some kind of proxy system, we could do it on a single local server, 
rather than on each user's laptop.  Doing it on the laptops also makes 
my skin crawl from a security viewpoint, since it would mean putting a 
copy of the data on  the laptop itself (think "Veterans 
Administration"...), and it's also a tedious PITA from an 
installation/maintenance viewpoint.

What might work well is some kind of headless server-in-a-box to run the 
local server.  Something fairly low-profile, portable, and unobtrusive, 
thus less likely than a laptop to get stolen by petty thieves (many 
people wouldn't even know what it was).  This would be far better than 
having to install the local application on each laptop, from viewpoints 
of installation, maintenance, and security. 

For this event it's by now too late for a solution, as we're already 
over the hottest part of the work.  But for the future this headless 
local server idea is probably the best way to go.

Thanks.

- Allen

Jumping into this late...

You may want to consider using web services.  Data would be stored in a
local MySQL database, and then as you mention, a central server aggregates
the data from all the locations.

The reason I mention web services, is that HTTP is typically more robust
over flakey connectivity than database protocols are.

The central web service would then hand out data per requests from the
remote offices, if it didn't already exist in the local cache, or it was
determined to be stale.  Using a optimistic type locking scheme and built in
conflict resolution, the central web service would then handle data sent
back from the remote locations.

Each remote location, however, could of course use a local MySQL instance,
and in a fully transactional way.  Then on some event or time basis, data
would be sent back to the central office over HTTP (probably actually
HTTPS).  Depending on the complexity of the data, though, this may be a good
or bad idea.

HP T5735 is along the lines of what you want. Sold as a thin client,
it also makes an excellent, low-power thin server when running a LAMP
stack.

Or you could just use a beat-up old laptop, which has the advantage of
battery backup when the power goes out.

Hans, have you seen something like this in production? It seems like a
great open source project that could become part of MySQL's lineup,
for use in exactly the type of situation that Allen describes.

MySQL Master <--> HTTPS Transaction Broker <--> Remote MySQL Cache

It's kind of the same architecture that Gears wants to put you in on
the client: you keep a local copy of all the data that's important to
you, synchronized whenever you are online with the main database. The
pattern is everywhere, but I've never seen a tool that was
purpose-built to do this between MySQL instances.

I haven't seen a general purpose tool for this type of thing, but have seen the same architecture done in a couple of places.  For example, desktop patch level tracking and location tracking for trains.

The caveat to all of this is the complexity of the data.  As data increases in complexity, conflict resolution gets more difficult on the aggregating web service.  And perhaps more importantly, the actual XML/POST/GET/etc actions that transmit the data between remote and central location can grow quickly and be complex to parse/structure themselves.

But as you mention, the pattern is good/growing, and useful wherever connectivity can't be guaranteed, or is known to be intermittent.  HTTP is a good fit because of its asynchronous nature, whereas database protocols are often latency and connectivity sensitive.  But with a flexible framework, the purpose specific logic could be dropped in where needed, and this would be an interesting project.

Can you take advantage of a bunch of PCs with EDVO cards?  Remove the
bandwidth issue from the equation?

------
Paraguay's mobile sector is far more dynamic. New investment and
competition are leading to exceptional growth in the take-up of mobile
services and innovative new mobile services. There are four major
mobile operators offering mainly GSM/GPRS services. They are Telecel
(Millicom), Hola (KDDI), Personal (Telecom Argentina) and CTI Movil,
(Amercia Movil).

The broadband sector is directly benefiting from these trends. Since
2001, several mobile operators have been implementing wireless
broadband options (WiFi and WiMAX technologies) that since mid-2007,
provide a serious alternative to fixed line broadband services. In the
near future, Paraguay's ISPs are predicted to serve more homes and
businesses via wireless broadband than ADSL.

I was thinking on same line. In developing countries like India, China, Brazil 
and other Latin american and African countries where purchasing PC, Internet 
connection etc. could be costly and sometimes not feasible, Using mobile 
services like SMS etc. can be very helpful.

Although my suggestion is not direct solution of your problem, but if you have 
control over design of your application, you can use use Mobile services to 
handle dynamic operations of your websites such as booking/canelling rooms 
and making requests which are bound to create conflict when internet is 
slow/down.

Hence you can put static data on website which may not effect slow connection 
like display of rooms/rates/information about hotel etc., and use mobile 
services (like sending SMS to book room) whenever dynamic operation is 
required.

This kind of solutions are being very popular in developing countries because 
mobile costs < 50$ and you can use it from anywhere as far as network is 
there.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SIMPLE authentication and menu framework
Message-ID: <20080706171324.E45478@mercury.atopia.net>

I'm looking for a really tiny framework for building an authenticated, dynamic 
menu-driven web app.

Basically, I need to write an application that people can:

1) authenticate to
2) have a menu dynamically generated for them that gives links they can access 
based on their access

I don't mind writing something like this myself, but it seems so basic that I'm 
sure someone may have written something like it in the past.

I don't really want something that's majorly complex.  Something simple 
designed just for this purpose.

Any suggestions?

Here's a brief writeup of how to enable upload progress bars in PHP.
http://undesigned.org.za/2008/07/06/simple-php-upload-progress-meter-using-prototype

The PECL extension that enables this is still marked as experimental.

I wish browser makers would realize that upload progress is just as
important to people as download progress, but at least now we have a
way to roll our own.

I also recommend swfupload.  Has a good deal of control over file types, 
files size and progress, and the best part is that it's all run via 
javascript (actual upload is done via swf, but the api is all js).

+1 for swfupload.  It is easy to setup and does everything on the
client side.  No ajax polling loop necessary, no hidden iframes to do
multiple background uploads.

IMO, polling the server is the wrong way to do file upload progress
bars.  As soon as you have more than 1 front end server, it takes a
holy hack to make it work.

Does anyone else have problems with SWFUpload freezing Firefox? I'm
running FF3 on Ubunty 8.04 and when I load the SWF demo it freezes
until the file is completely uploaded.

Maybe it's just an Ubuntu problem?

D'oh, I totally forgot about that! Plus you get styled upload controls.

The tradeoff with swfupload, as I understand it, is that you need to
have a process for temporarily associating the uploaded file(s) with a
form submission that gets POSTed separately.

Not a big deal, but it means that swfupload isn't always a drop-in
replacement for file inputs.

Last time I needed an upload progress bar, I couldnt get the php
progress bar to work and I didn't find swf upload. I ended up writing
the uplaod page in .net using this component
:http://www.brettle.com/Default.aspx?pageid=32

The developer write it in mono from the get go so it works great on linux.

The above progress bar doesn't work for me.

I've been down this road several times and each time it's a hassle 
that usually doesn't work well.

I finally just placed a animated gif when I want to show the user 
something -- it works for me.

Here's an assortment of images.

If anyone has any they want to add, please let me know.

Cheers,

That's exactly what produces the error warning.  (I actually had  
single-quotes, but same result either way.)

When I ftp via shell, I get a 220 response straight-away, which makes  
me think something else is going on..

There's that DBSlayer project that implements mysql calls over json.   
I don't think it would solve the main problem of conflicts though nor  
was it meant to be used like this.  But... if someone really wanted to  
start some type of project, they might be able to look there to get a  
jumpstart on the "web services <> mysql" part.

I used to work on Lotus Notes... MySQL replication isn't like  
replication in Lotus Notes.  Kinda funny though that an older  
technology like that would actually be a decent solution for this.  It  
was built back when the internet connections were probably similar to  
what these clients are experiencing.  I think the majority of us these  
days expect people to have broadband and pity the fool that doesn't.  ;)

I think the APC implementation of the server side process is the most  
recently updated php option.

Add this to your php.ini assuming your have APC installed (you do have  
it installed, right?):
apc.rfc1867 = on
There are serveral articles about it on the web.

If you have a multiple server setup, you still run into the issues Mr.  
Campbell mentioned.

Hello,

Maybe php or apache (whomever is execing the process) doesn't have perms 
to open a socket.

If your on a chrooted or some shared hosting plan this might happen - I 
really don't know though.

I'm guessing you googled this error message and found no help? If not, 
I'd surely hit up google.

HTTP_REFERER is pretty common, I think you can count on it 9 times out of
10.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL PHP Class generation
Message-ID: <4874C839.2080608@bzcode.com>

Getting tired of typing the same functions over and over to create a 
table class in PHP, so I'm working out script for my editor(Komodo) to 
do it for me.

I decided to go the XML/XSLT route because I can use the same code to 
make an online web interface(since PHP5 has such nice XSLT function 
support), pretty easily automate creating the XML given an existing 
MySQL table, and most importantly Javascript can also be used to do the 
conversion(leading me to be able to create everything from within my IDE 
since it has a javascript macro interface).

I also figure since Komodo supports PHP unit testing, I can create the 
unit test for the class at the same time.

Soo, before I go reinventing the wheel, does anyone have any good links 
for creating simple table classes using XML/XSLT(yes I did run across 
the plugin for Eclipse to do the same thing.  In the end their 
terminology did not really appeal to me - and since this is for ME to 
use, I might as well make it the way I want).

Or even 999 times out of 1000. Opera lets you turn it off, I believe, but
all other modern (since 2001?) browsers send it.

You still need to account for the case where someone has no HTTP_REFERER
upon first hitting your site--maybe they typed the address into the browser
bar, it happens! ;-)

I have tried running the HTTP_REFERER using the one liner below and nothing happens 

<?php
  echo $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];
?>

I cannot see why it should not work on my hosted Linux website, as it works on this site

You are using a link on another page to get to your referer test, right?

Try print_r( $_SERVER ) to see if the $_SERVER superglobal is being
set in the first place.

The best solution is for the page they came from to pass the return 
point to you in some manner(cookie, get or post variable, session 
variable, etc).  That way you have control over some things(like not 
returning them to a page that requires some posted variables to load 
properly).

Failling that, referrer works, or use some javascript and go "back" the 
correct number of pages in the history.

Some of the older browsers, including I believe Opera, let you mask 
HTTP_REFERER as a security option.  A lot of proxy servers also don't do 
a good job with it.  As a fallback, it might be more effective to cache 
the URI_REQUEST when the user first hits the page.

I was seeing some odd behavior myself recently.  It seems Firefox 3.0 
masks it as "(none)" for some reason so that may be an issue to look into.

Yeah, think you could provide some more info as to what you are trying
to do?  I don't think you want to create a class per table for CRUD or
getter/setter operations and that's what it sounds like to me.

Instead of reinvent the entire wheel, why don't you use existent tools
that does that job for you?

The two most known tools are Propel and Doctrine:

Doctrine: http://www.phpdoctrine.org

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ereg_replace() behavior
Message-ID: <200807101924.35714.arzala@gmail.com>

I am facing a strange behavior of PHP's ereg_replace() function. Here is 
scenario:

Problem:

Removing "__" (2 continuous underscores) and Capitalizing character that 
immediately follows "__" from a string. In our example our string 
is 'ss__name' and expected output should be 'ssName'.

Solution:

Tried following code using function "ereg_replace()" but character is not 
getting capitalized:

echo ereg_replace('__([:alnum:]{1})',strtoupper('\1'),'ss__name');

Outputs:

"ssname" instead of "ssName"

Here is bit matching explanation of this behavior 
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=24645&edit=1 (2nd last answer)

Contrary to above explanation, following code works properly (I just used 
different function instead of "strtoupper"):

echo ereg_replace('__([:alnum:]{1})',str_repeat('\1',5),'ss__name');

Outputs:

"ssnnnnname" as expected.

Any idea of such behavior? Or am i making mistake somewhere? I am using PHP 
5.1.6 on FC6. Although there is solution in PCRE (preg_replace()) and by many 
other, long, ways, I would like to dig first about this behavior.

Thanks

Doctrine has the added advantage of migrations.

Problem:

strtoupper('\1') = '\1' => 'ssname'

Problem:

str_repeat('\1',5) = '\1\1\1\1\1' => 'ssnnnnname'

Solution:

preg_replace_callback('/__([a-z])/i', create_function('$a', 'return
strtoupper($a);'), 'ss__name');

The strtoupper is being executed before ereg_replace, and doesn't have 
any effect on the string '\1' because it doesn't contain any alphabet 
characters.

You need to use the /e modifier for preg_replace()

echo preg_replace('/__([a-z0-9])/ie','strtoupper(\'$1\')','ss__name');

This is executed as:

echo ereg_replace('__([:alnum:]{1})','\1\1\1\1\1','ss__name');

Beat me to it, preg_replace_callback is probably better than /e from a 
readability and maintenance perspective too!

Migrations, Behaviors, Multi-Relation to the same table, Utilities,
DQL, Fixtures, extremely Active Community, etc...

So many advantages that it's difficult to count... that's why it's the
#1 on market, even not being the most stable. =)

Message-ID: <4876A940.4060505@thinkcomputer.com>

Hello,

I realize this is blatant self-promotion, but hopefully it won't ruin 
anyone's day...

In case anyone is interested, I've recently published a book that's 
pretty directly related to PHP, as well as issues of  programming, 
intellectual property, and computer security and privacy. It's called 
"Authoritas: One Student's Harvard Admissions and the Founding of the 
Facebook Era," and it talks about the complex and mostly unknown story 
of Facebook's birth. As you may know, Facebook is based on PHP and 
MySQL, as was houseSYSTEM's Universal Face Book, the site that preceded 
it at Harvard.

The book has a site here:

http://www.aarongreenspan.com/authoritas.html

and if you're interested in reading the first few pages, you can on the 
Interbook site for it here:

http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/index.html

The Interbook site also features the actual documents used to write the 
book (which are linked page-by-page) such as e-mails and IMs with Mark 
Zuckerberg, Facebook, Inc.'s present CEO, Apache logs, letters to and 
from the Harvard administration, etc.

Both sites are written in PHP (of course!) on the Lampshade framework. 
If you want, you can buy the book through any of the places listed on 
the Order page.

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks to all. Later found that it is limitation of "ereg_replace()" (against 
preg_replace()) that it can't execute replacement argument as PHP code nor 
can call other call_back functions like we could do with preg_replace.

Hi Chris ,

I genuinely believe that I have a misunderstanding of what the HTTP_REFERER 
is all about. I was trying to grab the address just before the user entered 
"my" application.

In my INDEX.PHP,  I used an extra script named LOGIN.PHP, where the 
HTTP_REFERER was captured.  Then in turn LOGIN.PHP called another script 
named LOGON.PHP which picked up the HTTP_REFERER information. which in my 
case is the url name of  my INDEX.PHP, Which of course pointed the way into 
the application in the first place.

Within the application HTTP_REFERER works just fine. I can see its potential 
and some importance possible uses within applications.

I am guessing the way around my problem is to forget the use of HTTP_REFERER 
and just put the user back to the login page and let the user press the back 
button to let themselves out, or is there a more elegant way to do what I 
want??

Cheers - Paul

Hi Paul,

As someone pointed out earlier this week, unless your app is set up so 
that the only entry point to it is a link from another URL, in most 
cases your user's entry point into your app would be typing the address 
directly, in which case there would not be an HTTP_REFERRER.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Returning users from whiniest they came
Message-ID: <1215782317.14401@coral.he.net>

Full text of what I was trying to post, below:

Hi Paul,

As someone pointed out earlier this week, unless your app is set up so 
that the only entry point to it is a link from another URL, in most 
cases your user's entry point into your app would be typing the address 
directly, in which case there would not be an HTTP_REFERRER.

HTTP_REFERRER's most common use is to track marketing and sales data 
coming from links on affiliates' websites, in emails, and etc. and 
records the URL of the referring site.    So you could determine, for 
instance, which one of your 10 affiliate sites sends the most customers 
(and how many each sends), or what percentage of persons you send an 
email to actually click on your sales link.

In your case, if your concern is that you want to ensure that users 
exit your app, I feel that programmatically closing the browser window 
would not only accomplish that but be best for security reasons.  Or, 
in the alternative, but way more annoying to users, you can use headers 
to send them outside your app to another URL.

If you programmatically send them back to the logon page, the back 
button won't then send them to the website they may have previously 
been on, but back to a previous page in your own app.

Wow, I have to disagree strongly with this (not that it's incorrect, but it is incomplete).  The only way I would think this is an 
even remotely possible design choice is if your users are "captive" in some way.  That is, you don't care at all how much you 
annoy them (because for whatever reaason they *have* to use your app).  I'm pretty sure that if the site is one that needs to 
"attract" or "retain" users in any way, programmatically closing the browser window is not something which should be considered 
(even if you could find a way to even effectively do it across all browsers).

While I don't dispute that some users might find that annoying, I would argue that few would find it more annoying than closing 
the browser window.   In any event it's certainly possible to log the user out without redirecting them away to a foreign url. 
And I do think Kristina gives a lot of other good information.

Charlie -- I do agree 100% that it's best from a design standpoint to 
just log them out and then let them choose the next action.  However, 
the original question from Paul was how to programmatically get them to 
another URL (or at best out of his URL) after using the app...so that 
is what I addressed.

Maybe if Paul can give some additional feedback on why he needs to do 
that specifically, we can better advise him on best practice.

Capture the HTTP REFERER when they enter your application to a session 
or cookie(some prefer session, some cookie, some do it some other way.  
Session or cookie is simple, you can get fancy when you know for sure 
what you want to do)..  When you exit the application, send them to a 
logoff screen, clear out their session information, and display a simple 
goodbye message:

"Thank you for using my application, I hope you enjoyed your session.  
If you would like to log in again, click here. 
If you would like to return from where you came form, click here. 

Here are some sites we happen to like and recommend."


Obviously, click here should be styled up and made nice.  Don't display 
the return from whence you came text if you don't have a referrer for 
where they came from.  You can make that one a fancy preview thumbnail 
link(pop up or not) to help them decide.

And of course, the here are some sites.... is a chance to monetize your 
application by accepting advertising, placing affiliate links on your 
page, or whatnot.

Hi Paul:

You misunderstand what http referer does.  In addition, be careful of 
what some other folks have posted in this thread, they're 
misunderstanding your situation, so may confuse you further.

Here are several key points:

* it is set by the browser
* it gets sent in the HTTP headers when requesting a page
* it indicates the URI a hyperlink was found on

Let's say a browser is on Page A.  Page A has a link to Page B.  When the 
user clicks the link to Page B, the browser will put the URI of Page A 
into the referer header.

Then, when the person is on Page B they click a link for Page C, the 
browswer will put the URI of Page B into the header/request for Page C.

So note that it contains the page that referred the _current_ request.

As others indicated earlier, if you want to know the place someone 
entered your site, you need to capture that on the first page they hit.  
Something _like_ this:

// Make sure session_start() was called already.

if (!isset($_SESSION['source'])) {
    /*
     * This is the first hit this person has made to your site
     * DURING THIS SESSION.  So if you don't manage things right
     * this could be a value from an earlier visit.
     */
    if (empty($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])) {
        // Either not sent or person typed in the URI directly.
        $source = false;
    } else {
        // They clicked a link to get here.
        // Make sure it is safe.
        $source = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];
        $source = preg_replace('/[^!#-9:;=?-Z_a-z~]/', '', $source);
    }
    $_SESSION['source'] = $source;
}

Daniel's #1 is an important point and one reason why I avoid relying on 
HTTP_REFERER at almost all costs.  Because the browser sends this it 
means it can be spoofed.  Worst case, it's like allowing a potentially 
tainted global variable into your application unless you're very careful 
about vetting it.

In my pre-PHP days, in fact my very early web days circa 1995, my web 
server got hacked because of a cleverly configured, spoofed HTTP_REFERER 
I was using to regulate access to a vintage motorcycle image archive and 
provide a back link.  I learned a lotta security lessons from that 
episode, including not to trust ANYTHING the browser hands me.

In the case that Paul is describing it's okay to trust it _as much as
you would trust any other user-submitted value_. You should always
html_entities encode a referer when displaying it on a page, just like
any other value in $_SERVER, $_GET, $_POST, or $_COOKIE.

Granted, there are all kinds of reasons not to provide back links.
Users aren't really expecting them, the referer is not always going to
be there, and it potentially leaves your site open to Google abuse,
because suddenly your site has links back to anybody else's website.

But at the end of the day if you want to redirect people back to where
they came from (like Paypal does, for instance, after you make a
payment), you have no choice but to rely on the referer.

All of the above of course depends on the application:
Users aren't expecting them, but they may make sense in the application.

The referer is not always going to be there, so simply code in a way 
that your exit point makes sense if it is not there.

Google abuse doesn't really apply if someone has to go through a 
sequence of form submits before they logoff - Google won't do that so it 
won't see the backlink page.

It does have the potential for people using your site to redirect others 
to somewhere else(for example, if your application had something to do 
with surveys about vintage cars, someone might post a redirect link that 
takes people through a porn site and then automatically redirects them 
to your site the first time they go through it, but takes them to a 
popup laden main page when they return. So after someone goes through 
your entire site, the link they are sent to at the end is porn).

Paypal has a much better mechanism, where the person sending someone to 
paypal indicates to paypal in the redirect exactly which page on the 
website to return the user to when the payment is completed or canceled.

Depending on his application, this may be a method he can use if he can 
require people linking to his site to provide that information to him.

Hi Everybody

Thanks for all your help and suggestions. It all appears to be my 
misunderstand of the use of the index files. Just because it happens to be a 
file with a PHP extent didn't mean it it going to act as a PHP script. It is 
logical really, as it does have a special function. The solution for me is 
to imitate the method in which my broadband service handles logging users 
out of their site (not service) and it seems to be confirmed by the manner 
in which my webhosting providers works too.

Once again thanks for your help.

Paul

Message-ID: <46569.192.168.1.71.1216317275.webmail@192.168.1.71>

I've been "cross-training" in a few languages and been thinking about differences in semantics in dictionaries (associative arrays) in common languages.  I wrote an article at:

[javascript:void(0);/*1216316970142*/] http://gen5.info/q/2008/07/17/the-semantics-of-dictionaries-maps-and-hashtables/

Which compares and contrasts dictionary semantics in four popular languages,  including PHP.  In a lot of ways I find the behavior of the

$value=$array[$key]

operation works well,  but I find it pretty obnoxious that:

(1) This throws warnings on a missing keys if a certain bit is set in error_reporting,  and
(2) It's not possible to have strict checking of variable names without also turning on strict checking of array keys  (which I'd usually expect to be a bit sloppier)

Any thoughts?

One right way to do this is:

if (array_key_exists($key, $array)) {
   // Life is good.
   $value = $array[$key];
} else {
   // Erm, it doesn't exist.  Now what?
   // Typically either set to NULL or throw error.

The lack of a default dictionary in php does suck.  Of course one can
work around this with a function like issetor($array,$key,$default),
but in my opinion that makes for ugly code.

Of course it is possible to create a class with this behavior using
SPL, but that doesn't take care of the superglobals and there might be
performance problems.

    For a long time I've used

isset($array[$key])

how's that different from array_key_exists?  The article at

http://gen5.info/q/2008/07/17/the-semantics-of-dictionaries-maps-and-hashtables/

tries to capture a similar logic into a single function,  array_get()

Overall I think logic like the code sample you give should be condensed into a function for several reasons:  the most serious is that duplicated logic can hide errors.

Well,  I've got a 'framework' that I use for my own projects that I call "PHP on Nails".  It has several levels,  and "level 0" is the most mature.  It's mostly about configuration management,  tightening error handling and reducing with variations between environments.

It introduces a few single-letter functions,  such as

Q($string):  almost the same as echo(htmlspecialchars($string)) except it maps the empty string to &nbsp;   Your designer and junior programmers ~might~ actually use it in a template.  I'm thinking about expanding UTF-8 unicode characters to numeric form here too.

G($key) and P($key):  which replace $_GET and  $_POST while doing a few kinds of filtering.  If the key is undefined,  it returns the empty string.  Whitespace gets trimmed from the beginning and end of the strings.  magic_quotes_gpc is undone if set.

Perhaps it's a bit crazy to use single character function names,  but my take is that these function greatly improve the security and reliability of PHP applications IF people actually use them.  If the names were like

get_and_filter_post_variable

they wouldn't get used.  Someday I'll release the level 0 library and blog about it.

I second that. From a professional QA view point I way too often see that 
developers assume something to be there even if it is a record that their own 
code wrote to a table or array just a second earlier. While that may pan out 
most of the time and not cause problems all pieces come off once there is a 
problem.
I use mainly isset() since that allows for crafting the whole checking and 
default value assignment in one line that is still readable.

I find this to be similar to initializing variables. Sure, under PHP you can 
get away with not doing that, but once you come across the problem where you 
think $i has the value of 1 when PHP really sets it to 0 you get to understand 
why other languages/compilers throw errors when a variable gets used and comes 
out of nowhere. In that sense I find it quite OK that warnings or errors get 
thrown when one requests the value from an array element, but the provided key 
is nowhere to be found.

isset() thinks NULL is not set.  Similarly, empty() can be used for stuff 
like this, but of course, it thinks NULL, 0, FALSE and "" are all the 
same.  Which function to use depends on how your program needs to work.

Sure, that works.  But I wouldn't take this person's advice too seriously 
since they're talking about using isset() to see if a key exists and they 
don't once discuss that their sample code on lines 11 and 15 can throw 
notices.

Depends.  I tend to like to see exactly what's happening right where 
you're at.  But if you're doing the same thing over and over, functions 
are helpful.

Message-ID: <af4f9a900807171452o3df524b2m9b1aa1a11bd8b05d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm working on a PHP cache library, and I wanted to check in and see what
folks thought.

Usually, you have many different front end views that you will want to
cache.  These may pull from multiple datasources in odd ways.  Far away from
the front end, there is backend CMS, either a tool like Wordpress or Drupal,
or a custom tool.  Generally, I find myself managing caches by:

1. Putting the code that generates the cache into the front end, since it is
the design that dictates which pieces of information should be grouped
together.
2. Putting a very small amount of code in the back end which causes the
cache to be deleted on the appropriate CRUD operations.  CMS's are
complicated enough as they are, and I don't want to clutter them up more
then necessary.

The hard part is creating the association between the front and back end.
What I want to do is to use *tags* to create this association, and to break
caches.

It works something like this:

<?php
function an_expensive_operation($arg1, $arg2) {
    ....
}

cache_set_dir('/tmp/www/cache');

// this will either run the callback and cache
// the return value and output, or just spit
// out the output and return value
// function cache( $callback, $params, $unique_name, $flags ) {...};
cache(
  'an_expensive_operation',
  array($value1, $value2),
  'run_an_expensive_operation_on_the_home_page',
  array('on_save', 'on_update', 'on_monday')
);

// any of these calls will cause the cache to be deleted,
// and force the cached function above to be re-run
break_cache('run_an_expensive_operation_on_the_home_page');
break_cache('on_save');
break_cache('on_update');
break_cache('on_monday');
break_cache('on_tuesday', 'on_monday');
?>

Does this sound similar to any existing library / tool, either for PHP or
for any other platform?  Does this sound like a useful library?

Thanks for your feedback!

Cheers,

Patrick

First thoughts: why not Zend or Pear cache libraries?

http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.cache.theory.html#zend.cache.factory
http://pear.php.net/package/Cache_Lite
http://pear.php.net/package/Cache

The pear packages are looking for maintainers - perhaps you could roll
your work into that?

So, what is your goal with this caching library?  FE caching can be
fixed with more boxes or a squid layer.  Datasources can be harder to
cache but will be much more valuable when you try to scale.

Thanks, these were the sorts of libraries I wanted to check for reference.

My experience is that the broader the cache the less effective.  Caches can
make sites appear un-responsive or oddly buggy to users.  I've done reverse
proxy caching with Squid, but it's painting with an extremely large brush.
You can't target *part* of a response for caching.

I also don't believe in "more boxes" all the time.  While an important part
of scaling is adding more resources, it's also important not to waste the
resources you have.  For example, you can cache the datasource.... or the
result set.  If the two have the same effectiveness, then I'd rather cache
the result set because that extends the per-box capacity.

If my application is failing to meet performance expectations, I like to
have on hand some caching tools to see if I can rescue it.  And that would
be the purpose of this library.

Cheers,

Patrick

I love the idea of providing the cache with an event model, so that
you can fire events that invalidate the parts of the cache that are
listening for them. I haven't ever seen that before, but then again I
don't get out much. Is it derived from some other system/language?

The caches I've used and built are of the stock squid or apc
variety--they check on load to see if the cache is valid, and recreate
it if necessary. Call it "pull". What you propose (in part) is "push":
mark the cache as expired at action time, so that when a subsequent
request gets around to reading out the cached value it can already be
regenerated and ready to go.

One thing that would make this extremely useful (to me, anyway) would
be to have the methods pay attention to additional metadata besides
just the name of the cache. I would want to be able to also pass a
request signature: a string that encodes the user-agent, language,
content-type, and even the userid or sessionid, in both the cache and
break_cache methods.

This push cache concept has me intrigued.  

As to passing a request signature that encodes user agent, language, userid, etc. - can't this simply be added to the cache id (for instance with Cache_Lite)?  We've had great luck using pretty urls for caching db result set objects and embedding userid on the end of the url.

Agreed.  Multiple layers of caching are also can be a pain to testing
and debug.  But even if I only I only served from that cache 10% of
the time, I'd still want it there.

Yes, as long your data is tied to only one view.  My experience has
been that performance issues stem from the datasource rather than the
FE rendering.  Don't get me wrong, I used local, file based cache as
well, but I cache the datasource separately.  And for FE cache, you of
course don't want to cache the view (or page module or widget or
whatever) if your datasource fails.

Yes, this would be the quickest way to breath life into a fledgling or
over-taxed application.  Wouldn't require too much work and can handle
user/session specific page modules.

So this is basically the "perfect" cache.  Items are cached "forever"
until invalidated.  Easier to achieve with data sources that don't
depend on many variables (basically static data coming from a
database, an article, a block, data appropriate for everyone vs. user
specific data) with basically a publish methodology and file cache and
a mechanism to flush.  Much more difficult for the variants.

We've done alot of work on this at Y! and unfortunately it is tailored
a little too much to our environment to be useful to others.  A lot of
effort went into invalidating not only the file cache but the squid
layers as well, on box CPU usage as well as network performance.  A
drop-in technique for the popular frameworks out there would be an
awesome invention.

With anything else, you need to weight whether or not you need it and
if it is worth the overhead of implementing it.

Part of this has to do with your system.  For example, Joomla is made up 
of Templates, Components, Modules, and Plugins all of which go into 
generating a page.

A component will generate HTML content for the main section of the 
website(think displaying articles, displaying a directory, etc).
A Module will generate a small block of HTML for specific purposes(think 
"most popular articles" list, "advertising banners", "number of users 
online")
A template is used to put all of that together into the layout of the page.

Finally, a plugin will take that page and do a bunch of regular 
expression find and replaces(so in your content, if you put {contact 
author} the author of an articles contact information is placed on the 
page).

Therefore, Joomla has multiple levels of caching.  As I recall, you can 
have it cache the output of specific modules and you can have it cache 
the complete page output. 

Now, compare that to the Smarty template system.  In Smarty, you can 
cache the results of applying a template to generate HTML.   Smarty also 
has an invalidate function, so whenever something is changed you can run 
the invalidate function and kill the cached object.


My feeling is it really needs to be taken to the next level.  So, when a 
cached object is generated, that object needs to record somewhere what 
underlying data points make up the cache. 

So, for example, your looking at a listing of all articles relating to 
PHP and Caching.

As a first step, if an article is added, most systems just do a generic 
"invalidate all article cache files" - but a more specific function 
would say "lookup all files related to caching that where cached tagged 
with X and invalidate them".

A smarter step would be to refresh the cache if possible.  So instead of 
deleting the existing cached files, generate new ones.  Considering that 
create/update operations are already expected to be slow, making them a 
few milliseconds slower is not a big deal.  Especially since the editor 
is a user you don't need to worry about getting upset at site slowness 
and moving on to a competitors site.  Wheras the reader is the person 
who you have to be quick for.

However, I will say the main issue is that developers have to USE the 
cache.  It does no good to have a method of storing data in a cache 
unless the developers of the components trigger the flush/refresh 
mechanisms that are already there and most CMS systems have(similiar to 
the logging facility.  It seems every framework has one, yet how often 
do people actually add a bunch of extra code to log information except 
for failures).

When I was working on caching, I remembered having to implement double
buffering for applets when I was learning to program.  Part of the
abstraction included marking the buffer as "damaged" when something was
drawn on it.  This would trigger an actual re-draw to the screen, when it
was time.

Dealing with caching websites, I found it was useful for the front end to
write caches to disk, and have the backend just delete the cache file.
These apis worked something like:

  <?php
  cache('callback', '/path/to/file')
  // to delete cache...
  @unlink('/path/to/file')
  ?>

The advantage of this technique is that it is very easy to span environments
and applications, since the 'event' is the deleting of a file.  But it can
get annoying making sure each event has the right file deletions.  So then I
started working on the tag / events idea, to make it easier to create the
association.

Cheers,

Patrick

I also prefer array_key_exists - mostly due to being exactly what I need 
when I use it (checking for a key, though I recall seeing somewhere 
(sorry no source, but should be easy enough to test), that isset is 
somewhat faster than array_key_exists.

Anyways, I like the article, but I noticed 2 errors.

You forgot an "I" in "mplementations" in the 2nd paragraph.

And you have an extra closing parentheses in one of your early examples:
[11] if ($_GET["q"])) {  // <-- Extra Closing Paren.
[12]     throw new InvalidInputException("You must specify a query");
[13] }

Have a great weekend NYPHP!

bzcoder,

I hear your point that using a framework, one should be aware of the various
framework-specific options for improving performance.  Through the 'tags'
structure, I am trying to create an api to specify the underlying data
points that make up the cache.

I disagree that it is smarter to re-generate the cache immediately on the
backend update.  Generally speaking, front end and back end code can be very
different and should be kept separate.

Also, I disagree that CMS users can tolerate a poorly responding site.
They add value to the site, and if the cache gets in their way, then they
give up on improving the quality of site content.

Cheers,

Patrick

Rather than recreating an entire procedure and the functions it uses we'd like to call the proc from within PHP like you would a stored perl function.  We are an Oracle-PHP shop.

Any suggestions/resources you'd recommend?

Tom,

Perfect caching is indeed what I am after.  Knowing that you work at Y!, I
understand why you need to throw boxes at the problem :)

With anything else, you need to weight whether or not you need it and
> if it is worth the overhead of implementing it.
>

Definitely.  I want the api to be simple enough to be useful.  The pure
file-based caching is dead simple, and extremely flexible.  The tags-based
system has rewards, but also drawbacks (like the need for the backend to run
php).  I'm trying to get some feedback to find the right balance of
simplicity and features.

It does sound like there is some interest.  I'll get something released, and
we can see if it is useful.

Thanks for all the feedback!

Cheers,

Patrick

Message-ID: <78c6bd860807191436y5dfca4aej5262cd28cc2d0cf0@mail.gmail.com>

I have a class that implements __get which retrieves the named

to do the following:

  $a = &$this->a;

such that modifying array $a would be reflected in the underlying
$this->_data array.

However currently I'm using a machine with 5.2.6 and that code no longer works.

If I change this to the following it works:

  $a = &$this->_data['a'];

This is not a big deal for me because the code in question is isolated
within the class but I was wondering if something has changed or if
I'm just mistaken or if there's an INI setting behind this?

Any ideas?

Could you post the code for your __get function? I think there are two
possible reasons for the discrepancy between 5.2.* and whatever version you
were running before:

1. You're using "Call-time pass-by-reference" by marking your return value
with an ampersand, try changing your code to this:

public function __get($field) {
  return &$this->_data[$field];
}

and removing the ampersand from the function call:

$a = $this->a;

or:

2. Perhaps the bug fix in 5.2.6 (see http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=43201)
changed the reference scheme.

But I don't want the default behavior to be to return a reference.

Ah, well, you're setting yourself up for some fun debugging later on, it's
probably best not to mix and match pass by reference/value, which is why I
think the PHP group depreciated the ability to do call-time pass by
reference. IMO, whether a function returns a reference or a value should be
part of the object method definition, not on the basis of the way the
function was called.

I did not use, do not use and do not want to use call-time pass-by-reference.

The code in question was "&$this->a" where $this is "magic" so it
should, in theory, behave as though "a" was a real object member. If
that code did in fact work like I thought it did, it must have been
doing some extra "magic" because my __get function does not specify a
reference in the signature or in the return.

I suppose someone could have decided this case was call-time
pass-by-reference in practice since it does go through the magic
functions, declared it a bug and changed it.

But I'm fine with &$this->_data['a']. I was just curious to know if
something fundamental had changed. At this point I'm not sure if the
code ever worked the way I claim and I don't care enough to write test
programs to find out.

Thanks tho,
Mike

Ahhhhh... sorry, that's what I get for having a programming conversation

I don't consider an extra millisecond or ( even 5) when editing a web 
page to be poorly performing, as the human based edit process is already 
structured around making changes, hitting save, waiting a second, making 
more changes, etc.

I consider an extra millisecond when generating content for readers(and 
having it added to thousands of requests, if not tens of thousands) to 
be poorly performing.

Both are working with user expectations, readers expect things to be 
instantaneous, editors expect something to take a little bit of time.

Even pure file based caching uses tags. 

You have to go from:

http://www.mydomain.com/somepath/to/myscript/script.php

To saving a cached file to /some/path/to/my/cache/somecachefile

You can embed your tags in your filename convention

Oh I wasn't thinking of an extra millisecond to be too much for the editor.
I referring to the 5 minutes of waiting for caches to clear b/c the cache
isn't integrated with the event of CMS updates.  I'm sacrificing the
occasional 500ms wait for content in favor of simplified code management and
integration, with the goal of more widely deploying perfect caching.

If the content generation stretches above 500ms I agree pre-generation in
the CMS is necessary.  I wonder if there's a pattern here that could also be
supported by the library?

Also, you are correct that you can embed information in the cache files.
What I'm going for is some library support to automatically clear both of
these caches on article updates:

  /cache/article/1234
  /cache/frontpage/article/sidebar

I know this could be done with:

  system('find /cache | grep article | xargs rm -f');

and I do question what's wrong with such a simple line of code :D

I want a simple abstract "clear cache" line of code to embed in various CMS
locations, while the actual mechanics of clearing cache are managed by the
library.  By simplifing the process of describing something that is cached,
I hope to have widespread 'perfect' caching.

I've got the code written for another project, just need to fiddle with the
namespaces and release it.  Thanks for the help thinking through the idea.

Cheers,

Patrick

Perhaps this goes without saying, but I was assuming you were thinking 
of file system caching only as the basic underlying method, and not the 
only method.

IE you have a system cache setup as:

$cache->check("somecode1");
$cache->get("somecode1");
$cache->save("somecode1");
$cache->clear("code1");

But your actual cache function should be extendable, so it can cache to 
the file system, it can cache to a database, and it can cache to 
memcached(http://www.danga.com/memcached/). 

That way your scalable from people who need file system caching, to 
people who want a central repository and can't do shared files, and
then people who want to maximize performance and can throw memory at the 
problem.

Message-ID: <78c6bd860807211448k32bb4d5arf3d955ccfddf2704@mail.gmail.com>

I trying to write a Wiki syntax tokenizer using preg_match. Meaning I
want to match any token like '~', '**', '//', '=====', ... etc but if
none of those tokens match I want to match any valid printable string.

The expression I have so far is the following:

  @(~)|(\*\*)|(//)|(=====)|(====)|(===)|(==)|(=)|([[:print:]]*)@

The problem with this is that the [[:print:]] class matches the entire
input. Strangely if I use [a-zA-Z0-9 ]* instead it works (but of
course I want to support more than ASCII and a space).

Meaning given the input:

  [The **fox** jumped //over// the fence]

I want each call to preg_match to return tokens (while advancing the
offset accordingly of course):

  [The ]
  [**]
  [fox]
  [**]
  [ jumped ]
  [//]
  [over]
  [//]
  [ the fence]

Can someone recommend a good PCRE expression for tokenizing like this?

Mike

Having a configurable cache backend is definitely one of the reasons I want
to put this stuff in a library.  Ideally the backend would use a URL-like
configuration line, so it becomes like a JDBC url that is set in a config
file.

Thanks again,

Patrick

The reason for this is that your token characters are included in 
[[:print:]] but not in [a-zA-Z0-9 ].

If you want to end up with everything in an array, you might want to 
look at preg_split with the PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE argument.

Something like:

$tokens = 
preg_split('@(~|\*\*|//|=====|====|===|==|=)@',$string,PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE);

May do what you're after.

Oh, yeah. Duh.

So is there any way to say "capture anything that didn't match" (aside
from created a sub-expression that explicitly excludes all of the
tokens)?

No, I need the tokens (or rather I need to know which token matched)
for the state-machine that follows so preg_split probably isn't going
to do the trick.

Afaik no, you could probably do something like:

preg_match('@^(.*?)(~|\*\*|//|=====|====|===|==|=|$)@',$string,$m);

Which would give you anything before the first token (or end if there 
are no more tokens) in $m[1] and the first token (or nothing if there 
are no more tokens) in $m[2].

That's what the PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE flag does, it returns the 
delimiters.  You can iterate over the returned array and you'll get 
either a token or text in each element.

An iterative preg_match setup will most likely be more memory efficient 
but also slower.

This should actually be:

preg_match('@^(.*?)(~|\*\*|//|=====|====|===|==|=|$)@s',$string,$m);

if your string is going to contain newlines.

Actually matching two tokens is what I started with and probably what
I end up using. Except I don't try to match the string. I match only
tokens, capture them separately and then use the offset of the
captured value to determine which token was matched. That way I get a
numeric value representing which token matched (otherwise I have to
try to map strings to token values after the preg_match). Then I use
the offset of the matched token to determine if I also got a string
and if so, save the token for the next iteration. It's probably more
efficient processing two tokens at a time anyway.

Thanks,
Mike

Good morning folks,

Just a reminder.  Tonight's meeting is *not* at IBM.  I've seen a few

not require RSVPs:

When you say "new venue", do you mean permanent, or just for summer

It's just a change for tonight since the room wasn't available.   All 
other meetings this year will be at IBM.

The situation is this...the full app needs to

1.  upon redirection from Paypal, display some text on an HTML page,

2.  post some data that is passed to the download page, and

3.  serve up a file for download.

In order for me to use headers to serve up the file, I have to pass the 
data on the transation to another page after I render the HTML.  There 
is database validation stuff which is stripped out for this sample but 
which is working in the original code.  



Thanks!

So why not approach it like this:

	1) Redirect back from paypal.  Display whatever text you need.
	2) Include in that page a good ole "Your download should start  
momentarily, if not, <a ...>click here</a>
	3) Include a hidden iframe pointing at an empty page
	4) Include a hidden form that targets the iframe
	5) Use javascript to trigger to form submit
	6) Whatever the form-handler script is, I'm assuming it's the bit  
that outputs some headers and then emits the PDF content.

This seems to be close to what you're trying to do, but with the  
addition of the iframe.

Hi Tim -- is there any way to get it to work by submitting the form 
twice and then including the file with the headers/pdf content?

thanks.

I suppose you could try just rendering the page, along with your  
hidden form that automagically submits... something like:

--BEGIN--
<?PHP
	if (! empty($_POST['txid']) && ! !empty($_POST['pdfid'])){
		//Send headers and PDF data
		die();
	}
?>
<html><head>...
<script type="text/javascript">
doDownload=function(){
	document.getElementById('secretForm').submit();
}
</script>
</head>
<body onload="doDownload();">
Hi, and thanks.

Here's yer file.
<form id="secretForm" action="" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="txid" value="<?PHP echo $txid; ?>" />
<inpu type="hidden" name="pdfid" value="<?PHP echo $pdfid; ?> />
</form>
</body>
</html>

--END--

So the first time through (with no posted txid and pdfid) you just  
get the page, which as soon as it loads everything, submits it's own  
hidden form back to itself (posting txid and pdfid).

I believe, without testing, that if your headers are correct, most or  
all browsers will just do their standard "download a file" behavior,  
and continue to display your content from the first request.  But you  
should test thoroughly.

Well, I don't use stored procedures or Oracle much, but a quick google 
search reveals this article: 
http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/oracle_php_cookbook/fuecks_sps.html

Seems straight forward.

Message-ID: <1216905443.4009@coral.he.net>

This project has since lost some of its urgency and so I've decided to 
try both suggestions, below (thanks Tim), and whatever else is 
necessary to get this working the way I need.  I'll post both the old 
code which is working without the new "feature" and the new code in 
progress.  

What the application does:

Processes Paypal-returned transaction information, inserts into 
database and then authenticates for unique transaction ID to download a 
particular file residing in a non-web directory, as identified by id# 
of purchased document.  File save/open dialogue box appears if 
authenticated.

The current code redirects back to the original website but opens up a 
file save/open dialogue box in that domain only, and does not offer the 
capability to display your thank you message and custom web page.

Right now after working on this yesterday and looking at it again, I'm 
not at all certain my original proposed approach, below, could ever 
work.  Tim's suggestions look interesting.

Do you really plan to spam every list you are on with this message? I 
just want to know now so that I can set up a filter to remove then 
automatically.

Thanks.

Scott,

This was not intentional.  I imported my google contacts, choose which  
addresses to NOT send to and YET it STILL sent to them.

I apologize this was not done on purpose.

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

Hrm.. another web 2.0'ism is about to be born. We already have phishing, 
vishing (voip based phishing).
I'd like to coin the term scishing (scour.com phishing?).

Scishing - (ski'-shing)  : The act of fooling an internet user into 
divulging their web mail login/password during registration, then raping 
them for and spamming their entire email contact list.

perhaps on a lesser malicious level there could also be FBishing, 
Plaxoishing, Linkedishing, recently MySpaishing, and so forth..

Subject: [nycphp-talk] A good PCRE expression for matching URLs
Message-ID: <78c6bd860807241119m571a023eg3fd40d8325d230c8@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone have a good PCRE for matching URLs?

All of the examples that I have looked at in various places are too
simple or exclude invalid characters rather than include valid ones
(and of course fail to exclude all bad characters) or don't properly
use escaping ... etc.

Or perhaps someone can improve (or correct) the expression I'm using currently:

  $expr = '[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,10}://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+[\p{L}/~._-]*|mailto:[a-zA-Z0-9\\@.-]+';

The exprssion breakdown is:

  [a-zA-Z0-9]{1,10} - Protocol specifier (e.g. http, ftps, smb, gopher, ...)
  :// - Protocol host separator (mailto style handled by or condition)
  [a-zA-Z0-9.-]+ - The hostname (currently we assume only ASCII)
  [\p{L}/~._-]* - A UTF-8 path (probably need to allow some other
chars but not '?')
  |mailto:[a-zA-Z0-9\@.-]+ - Or a mailto URL

I am not sure I completely understand what you are trying to do, but
it doesn't look like you are matching + or %.

What is the context for the matching?

Ben,

I am not sure what you mean.  I imported my google contacts into scour  
and told it to only send to certain contacts but it sent to ALL  
contacts.
Sorry for the spam

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

Check out Zend's URI validation. It?uses permissible characters rather than excluded characters.
http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.uri.html#zend.uri.chapter
(you'll want to take a look at /Uri/Http.php)

Here's an ereg expression I wrote many years ago:

eregi_replace("(http://|https://|ftp://|gopher://|news:|mailto:)([[:alnum:]/!#$%&'()*+,.:;=?@_~-]+)([[:alnum:]/!#$%&'()*+:;=?@_~-])", 
'<a href="\\1\\2\\3">\\1\\2\\3</a>', $Val);

You mean in the path? In the path I suppose I should permit quite a
few more characters (I forgot 0-9 too). This makes the expression:

$expr = '[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,10}://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+[\p{L}0-9!$%&\\()+-./;=^_~]*|mailto:[a-zA-Z0-9\\@.-]+',

> What is the context for the matching?

This will be used to pick out URLs in Creole Wiki markup. Which
incedentally is not supposed to match characters that can occur
naturally at the end of a sentence (,.?!:;"') so I guess I need to
leave out '.' and ';' for my particular application.

So given markup:

  Please visit http://www.yahoo.com/us?rs+100%&lusers$/~jerry/y_a-n.g/Yahoo;=^(!)foo.

The regex should match (minus the dot at the end):

  [http://www.yahoo.com/us?rs+100%&lusers$/~jerry/y_a-n.g/Yahoo;=^(!)foo]

although in practice a URL this crazy should probably be formalized
with square brackets as defined by Creole for links.

Hi Rada,

Zend_Uri_Http is using regrex to capture each component separately and
is quite complicated about how it builds the regex so I don't think
it's going to help me.

Thanks,

Well gmail is picking out and linking the above link up to but not
including '^'. I wonder if it will link the remaining characters ...

  http://www.yahoo.com/us?rs+100%&lusers$/~jerry/y_a-n.g/Yahoo;=(!)foo

Many urls contain a question mark.  Why not just accept anything
except a period or an question mark at the end?

Despite the fact that things should be escaped when output, I think
it's a good opportunity to effectively validate things.

But it would be nice to exclude those end-of-sentence punctuation from
the capture output. I tried the following minimalistic expression just
to try and get the trailing condition right I'm not able to
distinguish between a dot that is part of the URL and a period at the
end.

  $expr = '(http://[a-z./]+)\\. ';

Your expression doesn't seem to work for me either. It seems that '.*'
is just matching everything.

Got it. I just needed to negate the end-of-sentence punctuation character class.

This seems to be handling all cases properly:

  $expr = '([a-zA-Z0-9]{1,10}://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+[\p{L}0-9"!#$%&\\()+,\\./:;=?\\@\\\\^_{}~-]*)[^,\\.?!:;"\'\\s]';

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Multitons and Late Static Binding
Message-ID: <57536.192.168.1.70.1217002947.webmail@192.168.1.70>

I've been thinking a lot about the weaknesses of static inheritance and polymorphism in most of the languages that people use.  Often we need to write really complicated code to handle initialization of systems.

In PHP,  on the other hand,  there are really good tools like dynamic constructors

$obj=new $SelectedObject($param);

and PHP 5.3 introduces late static binding.  I've been wondering if late static binding could be used to implement a Singleton or Multiton base class that other classes could inherit from.  See the following article for a typical Multiton implementation in a static language:

http://gen5.info/q/2008/07/25/the-multiton-design-pattern/

In the article I suggest that LSB could be used to do it better in PHP,  but I haven't figured out exactly how.  Any ideas?

P.S.  I think that the memory disadvantages of multitons would be less severe in PHP than they would be in other environments because of the short-lived nature of the PHP process.

Hi Paul:

Hadn't heard of "multitons" before despite my using them under the name 
"singletons."  So I checked out the Wikipedia entry about it, 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton.  What's even more interesting, is 
the versions of this article prior to May of this year said this term is 
kind of made up:

   Multiton is a (disputed) term often used to describe a Singleton-like
   pattern that allows more than just one instance to be created. While
   there is no official Gang of Four design pattern called Multiton...

That aside, the code I was doing this in has its roots in PHP 4, so the 
hash/objects were being stored in $GLOBALS.  But seeing Wikipedia's 
example made me realize I could store the hash in the class itself.


> In the article I suggest that LSB could be used to do it better in PHP, 
> but I haven't figured out exactly how.  Any ideas?

Not sure how late static binding is really needed for this since the 
pattern works just fine in PHP 5.2:

class db {
    private $db_resource = null;
    private static $dbs = array();

    public function __construct($user, $db, $host, $port, $pass) {
        $this->db_resource = @new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $db, $port);
        if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
            // handle it...
        }
    }

    public static function multiton($user, $db, $host, $port, $pass) {
        $hash = self::get_auth_hash($user, $db, $host, $port, $pass);
        if (!isset(self::$dbs[$hash])) {
            self::$dbs[$hash] = new db($user, $db, $host, $port, $pass);
        }
        return self::$dbs[$hash];
    }
}

Hi 

I am at the stage where I need to put style to the site and am using CSS. with Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer and Safari to test for browser compatibility. What I find puzzling is there seems to be differences in the styles of output, Using the same the exact same coding the only varible in the testing are the browsers themselves.

Welcome to the world of web development.

Cross browser css development is plagued with problems.  IE 6 is
consistently the worst offender.

Even something as simple as centering a block is different in IE, and
the standards compatible browsers.  There are dozens of quirks, and it
is not something that is easy to learn, but I'll give you a few
pointers.

1) Make sure you have a doctype that put IE into "standards mode"
2) Get firebug and use the inspector to learn from other people's code.
3) Do some reading on "CSS columns", "CSS clear fix", "CSS centering",
"CSS IE bugs".  There are tons of articles and blogs that contain
useful pointers.
4) Make sure you understand the box model inside and out.

Hope that helps,
-John Campbell

Great summary, John.

When you really decide you don't like yourself anymore, start reading up 
on IE's "hasLayout" property.

I never encountered that property before but it sounds like something
Raymond Chen would think is a good idea.

It's a beast.  Here's some misc. description I found with a quick search:

""Layout" is an IE/Win proprietary concept that determines how elements 
draw and bound their content, interact with and relate to other 
elements, and react on and transmit application/user events."

And then later...

"Consequences of an element having, or not having "layout" can include:

    * Many common IE float bugs.
    * Boxes themselves treating basic properties differently.
    * Margin collapsing between a container and its descendants.
    * Various problems with the construction of lists.
    * Differences in the positioning of background images.
    * Differences between browsers when using scripting."

When in doubt:
*height:1%
min-height:0;

As a side note, is anyone thinking about abandoning IE6 testing?  My
numbers on IE6 market share show it is around 20%. (my sites are US
based and tend to be "consumer" focused).  Apple has dropped support
for IE6 on their new me.com site.  I feel like once IE6 drops to 10%,
it will no longer be worth supporting.

How do most people even do IE 6 testing?  As far as I can tell, there
is no legal means to test IE6 on a mac or linux.  I was told that
microsoft has virtual PC images available for free, but that only
works on the Pro/Business editions of XP/Vista.  Microsoft should
release free copies of XP and Vista that only have a web browser and
don't allow other software to be installed.

Well what are the firefox numbers? I think IE6 is still relevant for
e-commerce and 15 year old girl sites. No one runs windows update and
no one is buying vista. I would consider limiting support of IE6 at
this point, and maybe exclude IE6 from new features in your site.

The same way we tested Safari before it was released for windows. Also
your suggestion is totatly unfeasable for Microsoft. It would be hard
to limit what you can install on Windows.

I think the virtual PC images already have this property.  I just wish
they would ship the images as an installable iso.

I feel your pain, but remember that even Apple has less than 10% and 
most of us support Safari. (Granted, it's easier to support).

My figures show IE 6 has about 26 percent of the market and that 
figure is dropping about a percent a month. So I plan on supporting 
it for probably another two years.

The good side is that I'm pretty familiar with the problems that IE 6 
presents and have solutions for them -- so, it's not a big deal for 
me.

>How do most people even do IE 6 testing?

I do my testing on BrowserCam -- if it passes there, then I don't 
worry about it.

Under windows I've had good luck with MultipleIEs [1], for Linux there 
is IEs4 Linux [2].

The easiest route is probably to keep a Windows machine around running 
IE7, IE6 (via MultipleIEs), Firefox, Safari and Opera.  You'll still run 
into issues that only raise their heads in older versions, but you'll 
have the major bases covered.

Interesting discussion.  We are now working on a heavily CSS'd site and 
already finding some weirdness in IE6 behavior with our new dynamic 
menu.

I remember back when the incompatibilities were very bad already, and 
IE and Netscape kept thinking that adding new incompatible features 
would cause the other product to become extinct overnight...haha.  What 
it really caused was 10,000 different browser detection routines and an 
unwillingness on the part of developers to go anywhere that might not 
be universally supported.

Is there anything out there now that's a good comprehensive "where not 
to go with client side dev" overview, like we used to have?

Here's a pretty decent roundup of how long a few well known companies / 
developers will be supporting IE6, if at all - some good arguments on 
both sides.

Thanks everybody

Great suggestion Erik and I am checking it out.
John when you say - Make sure you have a doctype that put IE into "standards 
mode" I am not sure how to do that.
Could either of you gve me snippets of coding so that I can see what these 
quirks, strict and standard mode locoding looks like.

The best way to test IE is in windows.

If you're doing web stuff, most of your users will be on windows, so  
you have to run windows.

My solution, which works quite well: VirtualBox (http:// 
www.virtualbox.org), is a free Virtual machine.  A couple of small  
VMs running under MacOS as the host operating system (you can run  
VirtualBox on linux too) let me test in both IE6 and IE7.  I figured  
out how to do it when my (non-virtual) windows machine died.  It  
actually works quite well.  I suppose the multipleIE setup could work  
too, but it seemed wonky last time I tried.  So now I just have to  
virtual windows boxes, one running IE6, another running 7.

Yes, this means paying for a copy of XP.  I hate to do it,  
personally, but if you're in this business, it's a necessary evil.

Hi Paul,
     Everyone gave some really good suggestions, but you should invest
in this book http://www.cssmastery.com/ . I'm more of a back-end guy
now, but i've done front-end development for some big name companies
and this book has been my CSS bible. It's hasn't let me down once.
Additionally it provided answers to all previous CSS problems I've
googled prior to buying the book.

The question is who is that 26% and do you have to care about them? I've
been developing an app for a private audience, inside an intranet, so you'd
think it would be easy in that at least I know whom to expect and what they
are running. Turns out that some of my most  useful cute Web 2.0 tricks fail
in the browser that a lot of them are running:  IE6. Why don't they upgrade?
Because, I am told, IE6 is the top and the end of the line for their Windows
flavor, Win 2K , and management doesn't want to pay Microsoft prices to
upgrade. I need Scriptaculous' autocompleter to work -- it's supposed to
support IE6, but it aint so in my case. I am forced to consider dumbing down
my UI to the lowest common denominator.

Pardon the OT, I guess is isn't about CSS per se.

The best slide show I ever saw is the Image Rotator from Jeroen Wijering. It 
is Flash based and if it works like anything else Jeroen created you can set 
plenty of options through parameters as well as determine the play list 
through an XML file. I don't know any of the details. I use the JW Flash Video 
Player, which is just awesome. For the image rotator see here:

I'm coming to this discussion late, and while you've already gotten some 
excellent advice, I don't think anyone has mentioned CSS resets yet.

Every browser, or rather browser family, has its own internal stylesheet 
that sets the default presentation of HTML elements. For example: In IE 
& Opera lists are indented by setting a left margin of 40px on the <ul> 
element, whereas in Gecko-based browsers lists are indented by setting 
40px of left padding. Trying to achieve consistent list indentation can 
drive you insane if you're unaware of this.

The best way I've found to avoid these inconsistencies is to use CSS 
reset, which sets page elements to margin: 0, padding: 0. There are tons 
of examples out there--just google "css reset". Some people only reset 
certain commonly used elements, others reset everything (I reset 
everything so I don't have to think about it again).

Personally, I have a prototype CSS file (also referred to as "CSS 
framework"--another term you can google) which I use for all the sites I 
build. My file first resets all elements, then sets up basic layout divs 
like #wrapper, #branding, #navPrimary, #contentMain, #sidebarPrimary, 
etc. It also includes a default set of rules for typography, headings, 
lists, links, etc. It takes time to create one that works for you--mine 
took months and is still constantly evolving--but in the long run it's a 
huge time saver.

If you decide to go the prototype/framework route, you'd do well to read 
up on CSS naming conventions. For maximum flexibility you'll want to use 
structural rather than presentational names--i.e. #navPrimary, 
#navSecondary, #sidebarPrimary, #sidebarSecondary instead of #navTop, 
#navLeft, #sidebarRight, #sidebarLeft.

Hope that helps a little.

Eric Meyer has a good reset, which I've used on quite a few projects as 
well:

Hi Kristina,

I don't know of anything offhand. As you undoubtedly know, web 
technologies change so rapidly that it's well nigh impossible to come up 
with a definitive guide that won't be outdated by the time the next 
browser is released.

I'd say your best bet is just to be aware of current standards, bugs in 
current browsers, and make sure you have a solid understanding of the 
box model & proper doctypes (as already mentioned by someone else). IMO, 
it's also important to understand how floats work as well as the cascade 
itself (inheritance & specificity). As long as you're aware of the 
possibilities & limitations of those things, you should be fine.

Of course, knowing who your users are is probably the most important 
thing as evidenced by what David M. said about discovering that his 
intranet audience was using IE6, which screwed up his cool Web 2.0 tricks.

On a more practical & somewhat OT note, our web site clearly states 
which browsers we develop for: only mainstream, non-proprietary, modern 
browsers (nothing more than 5 years old, with the exception of IE6). We 
also educate clients on what to expect--i.e. consistency doesn't 
necessarily mean identical, pixel-perfect rendering across all 
browsers/platforms. Oh--and this is important--we let them know that 
while we follow current web standards & best practices, it is impossible 
to predict future browser bugs & technology changes, therefore we cannot 
guarantee future consistency.

Regards,
Bev

Below are?current Cut-off Wages for?computer specialists?from the New York State Department of Labor. These are not some extravagant rates. These are rates that the NYS DOL considers so low that if you are unemployed and someone offers you work below this rate, you can refuse the job without losing your unemployment insurance. Needless to say, nobody with a brain will work for cut-off wages, these are just examples of absolute rock-bottom rates. 
?
Occupation Cut-off Wage 
Computer Programmers $31.77 
Computer Software Engineers $35.79 
Computer Support Specialists $24.30 
?
The above hourly rates are for full-time work. For less than 40 hours/week, the rates have to be proportionately higher. For example, if you are a "Computer Programmer", the hourly cut-off wage is $31.77 but the corresponding yearly wage is $74,626.00. 

To Susanna: 
This is a professional PHP community and frankly, your $10/hour?for part-time work?is inappropriate to the point of being insulting.?You may think that an offer is just an offer and those who don't like it could simply pass on by, but I'd rather not see this online space turn into a craigslist ghetto with its infamous "looking for someone to build me a?YouTube/Ebay?combo for $1,000" ads.?
?
To fellow PHP developers:
I know we are all flooded with work and don't necesarily have time for nonsense, but let's?try and take care of each other.?Save this link for the DOL minimum wages page and let unethical?would-be clients?know?when they've crossed the line.?For?sample language,?please?refer to the No Spec project which contains lots of great examples like this.???
?
?

Rada,

She did say it was a student and you get what you pay for. She could
do much less than $10 an hour if she went to rent a coder and this
student probably couldn't get better than $10 an hour if he or she was
working for this person.

If this student no longer can do the work then one can assume they are
making better than $10 an hour. If no one is willing to do the work,
at that rate she will be forced to pay someone a higher rate. As a
photographer, she has to hire models, assistants, makeup people etc.
She's well aware of the costs of labor.

Now if some 16 year old kids want to give it a go at $10 an hour I'd
say more power to him. It will probably take him three times as long.
Its not taking any food out of my mouth. I do business with people
that are willing and able to pay my rates, and I don't begrudge those
who deal with those jobs below my rate. I would have never had the
experience to be able to command my current salary if it were not for
me taking jobs that paid little and demanded too much.

Regards,

Justin Dearing

Subject: [nycphp-talk] upgrading PHP on CentOS 5 -- or should I?
Message-ID: <721f1cc50807300856r26551d88m424667cd446cd5fd@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all,

I got two CentOS 5 LAMP production servers and a Zend Framework app. The
CentOS boxes have PHP 5.1.6 and CentOS evidently has no intention of
offering an upgrade. There are third-party RPMs available but as a novice
sysadmin I am uneasy about going there lest I break stuff.

Why upgrade? There's a strange and subtle bug in IE6's, also Safari's
behavior with an Ajax call involving Scriptaculous' Autocompleter. What's
the server side got to do with it? I don't know, except that I cannot for
the life of me reproduce the bug when I run the selfsame code on PHP 5.2.x I
am out of hypotheses.

I am dissatisfied with CentOS' conservatism -- I guess it's not for me --
but installing another distro based on a hunch that it might help seems like
overkill, doesn't it?

What would you do?

PS, the code that acts weird only on 5.1.6 is substantially this:
http://davidmintz.org/eg/autocompleter.php (source:
http://davidmintz.org/eg/autocompleter.php/source). If you see anything
wrong with it, do share.

In deepest gratitude,

I'd configure yum to use a repository that has PHP 5.2 for CentOS,

What's wrong?  Seems to work for me.

Yeah, there are many Linux distros that really suck at updating packages.  
You can always compile PHP yourself.

David,

So what exactly is the cause of the bug? Is different html of
javascript being generated by different versions of PHP? Is it a
matter of warningnotices and errors being raised in the code producing
the javascript?

Also, why not install a seperate copy of apache and php in a seperate
directory that you built from source? You can run apache on a port
other than 81 and see if the problem still exists.

I have a hunch though that warning are being inserted into the output
code that your other php configuration places in a log file. Check the
PHP.INI settings.

Below are current Cut-off Wages for computer specialists from the New York State Department of Labor. These are not some extravagant rates. These are rates that the NYS DOL considers so low that if you are unemployed and someone offers you work below this rate, you can refuse the job without losing your unemployment insurance. Needless to say, nobody with a brain will work for cut-off wages, these are just examples of absolute rock-bottom rates. 
 
Occupation Cut-off Wage 
Computer Programmers $31.77 
Computer Software Engineers $35.79 
Computer Support Specialists $24.30 
 
The above hourly rates are for full-time work. For less than 40 hours/week, the rates have to be proportionately higher. For example, if you are a "Computer Programmer", the hourly cut-off wage is $31.77 but the corresponding yearly wage is $74,626.00.

Well a quick fix is to replace the Scriptaculus Autocompleter with a
jquery version.

http://plugins.jquery.com/search/node/autocomplete+type%3Aproject_project

Then worry about the upgrade down the road.

Your analysis is faulty. CentOS (or really Red Hat since CentOS is
mostly just re-branded RHEL) not "updating" packages is quite
deliberate.

Once the major.minor version of a package is selected, it does not
change for the life of that OS' major.minor version (and for many
things only the major version - ie. the kernel). The reason is that
the API provided by the package can change if the minor number
changes. So the new package could cause all sorts of strange things to
happen if it's linked with or used by other packages.

And in fact, the internal PHP API has changed with 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2.
So if you install a third party extension for PHP 5.1 and then upgrade
to PHP 5.2, the extension will no longer load.

> You can always compile PHP yourself.

And then re-compile it for every patch level release?

I forgot to mention that while our web site says we only build sites for 
modern browsers, we also say that if they have special needs we can 
accommodate them. I just wanted to clarify that.

learning & need pointers, here are some links that may prove helpful:

Good point, thanks. Actually I have just now been flirting with les RPM de
Remi (http://blog.famillecollet.com/) and considering that route, but I
heard of the site you mention in a thread about this very issue (need to
upgrade PHP on CentOS 5)

Kind of like, if you don't like your spouse, get divorced and re-marry
someone else. It makes sense but it's a lot of work. (-:

Seriously, my js is now loaded with Prototype-dependent stuff -- hmm just
how similar are the Prototype and JQuery APIs? I will go have a look. Maybe
that divorce/re-marriage wouldn't be so awful...

Ummm -- I don't know. That is, it's an Ajax thing and the JS is (mostly)
hard-coded client-side. With Firefox/Firebug of course I see exactly what's
going on with XHR. With IE6 I have no clue what's going on when it
fails/acts funny. That's the issue -- code that breaks ONLY with IE6 and as
far as I can tell, IE6 + PHP 5.1.6. Because try though I might, I can't
reproduce the IE6 bug on my dev box (PHP 5.2.6) but the bug does happen with
the same code on the production boxes (PHP 5.1.6).

Specifically, it's a situation where the user is posting a request for a
court interpreter for a court proceeding -- so there's a form with fields
for stuff like date, time, language. For the defendant name(s) however we
have thousands in the db already and don't need/want them trying to spell --
it's an ideal scenario for autocompletion. So they type something and select
a name from the results returned, and my callback inserts a node in the DOM
with a hidden field holding the record id, bla bla bla. Works great but in
IE6 sometimes there's an apparently random extra record gratuitously added
to the POST payload. At first I thought it might be caused by multiple users
doing stuff at the same time but that ain't it.

Oh yeah, in IE6 there is also the issue where they type something and
nothing happens the first time, type some more and then it works normally
(more or less). That's a known issue that was supposed to be fixed in the
release I am using but it ain't so.

Jeez, I suppose I could but I have been there and done that:  wget and tar
xzf whatever, ./configure --etc --etc --etc, watch it fail,, chase down
dependencies, and dependencies upon dependencies, google obscure (to me)
configure errors, watch the compiler work for 11 minutes and then puke,
google obscure compile errors, feel manly once it's all over and lay back
and have a smoke... nah. I mean, I have never had much trouble compiling
apache but PHP has been too exciting.

I could be logging more verbosely and I will do that.  Thanks.

Rada,

Sorry for coming on so strong. I generally follow these lists for the
technical discussion, and not the solicitations for work. I get
annoyed when people don't let the market take care of lowball offers
like this. You are right that people on this list in general command a
better than $10.00/hr fee, and that's about living wage in the NY
area.I know a security (as in rent a cop) company that pays people
about that much to watch construction sites, and many of them are
immigrants that are completely illiterate in both English and their
native languages. So I do appreciate how little $10.00/hr is.

That being said, I started out programming for $8.00 an hour when I
was hired to do clerical work. It was a benefit to both parties. It
made their operations more efficient. It helped me to get a help desk
position for more money, and lead me down a path to earning my current
salary doing something I love. Without the crappy jobs I would not
have ended up in my current good one. When I was at the stage of my
life where I wasn't good enough to get paid a proper wage to program,
I preffered to make a substandard wage programming to making a
substandard wage doing something I didn't like.

thanks for the link btw - i've also been testing a few repos without
much luck (first on a dev env then on production of course ...)

how's the stability on this repo and have you ever got bad builds ?

That's why you write build scripts. Especially for a minor version  
update, my upgrade procedure is:

cd /src/archive
wget http://.....php-X-Y-Z.tar.gz
cd ..
emacs build.php
[edit some line that looks like "export PHP_VERSION=X-Y-Y" to read  
"export PHP_VERSION=X-Y-Z]
exit emacs
./build.php

Well, actually, my setup is a little more complicated (it compiles a  
bunch of things, openssl, zlib, mhash, etc, then builds apache and  
php, linking against the various libraries)

If anyone's interested, I can try to document them and up them up on  
the web somehwere.

Binary packages are great, until they're not.  In my experience, it's  
worth spending a few days putting together some scripts to compile  
what you need.  That way, you know what you're getting.

Hey there:

I had a category structure that was previously limited to two degrees,  
but I've decided that I want it to be able to grow however it needs  
to.  I has been using a "parent" field previously, and I converted it  
to be stored using a typical nested set model, so that I could achieve  
display with a single database query, and so forth.

I now have a slight problem, which is that I would like the categories  
to be alphabetized in each level.  Has anyone previously tackled this  
problem before, and have some sample code to rebuild the entire tree,  
but alphabetize or sort the entries in each level?

Cheers,

 From memory  ... I don't think you can do it in SQL (but I very well  
may be wrong), at least on the query-end.

It's probably best to approach it by restructuring the tree when you  
insert/update, though that's going to be a good deal of hairy code in  
your business logic.

Sorry I don't have a better answer.

I think CentOS (and other RedHat-derived distros) all suffer from this 
problem. (I had the same problem with Ruby packages too). That's why I 
stopped using those distros a few years ago. I now use Gentoo.

Yeah, I tried this when I still used RedHat-derived distros. Its doable if 
you only have one or two servers, but not if you have more to update.

Hence the attraction of source-based distros.

I'm not looking for general framework suggestions as much as an existing system that is well-coded and worthy of adoption/mimicry for this kind of app. Typical add - manage - publish - integrate & cross-reference stuff for events, hopefully including some handling of recurrence/venues/etc. PHP and MySQL preferred, Python and PostgreSQL ok if the PHP folks recommend it in this case, ZF is fine... CalDAV should on the roadmap at least if it's already an even calendar.

I don't mean to trivialize  development.. but this is a personal project for an amateur coder (me) and I simply hate building upon something that smart developers later tell me at a NYPHP gathering was poorly written, badly coded, or completely stupid ;-)

Thanks in advance for the guidance!
