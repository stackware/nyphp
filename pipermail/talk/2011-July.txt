Subject: [nycphp-talk] Issues with File Permissions
Message-ID: <CAHz22PyBR+mT85tprG6cAzxxksuPKjhmmzPCJ7pqmjz-T8EQwA@mail.gmail.com>

We have a site where if we create a folder or file on the server the
Owner/Group is one name (foo/foo) and if we use the CMS the
Owner/Group is another (bar/bar).

Typically, we set folder permissions to 0777 so that we don't have to
open and close directories for uploading files. However, a hacker
uploaded a couple of files to one of these directories last week, so I
am trying to add code that uses chmod() to properly open and close
directories.

The issue I'm running into is that this only works through the CMS if
the Owner/Group of the directory or file is bar/bar.

I'm trying to figure out what my options are here. Here are a couple
of possibilities:

1. Use bar/bar to create a duplicate directory, copy all of the files
from the original directory to the new one, delete the old directory,
rename the new one. Essentially this makes everything owned by
bar/bar.

2. See if tech support can change the Owner/Group on the server for
the entire directory.

I am not very savvy with this sort of thing, so shell access is really
beyond my skill set. Is it possible to change these settings via SFTP?
Or is there a way via PHP to change the Owner/Group that I am
accessing the files as?

The rules are that only root can change ownership of a file. So group
id is the only one you have to play with here. A user can change the
group id of a file to any group they are a member of.

In this case, I'd set folder ownership to foo:bar and folder
permissions to 770.

Your host will need to do that for you if foo is not a member of the
bar group. Also, you won't be able to manually manage the files if you
aren't a member of bar.

I am in a situation where I need allow_url_fopen to be on, but it is  
off and I have no access to php.ini (which, according to the docs, is  
the only place where it can be set). Does anybody have any ideas about

You should ask to your provider... and just give a try with an .htaccess
config, not sure, but it might work
php_value allow_url_fopen = On

.htaccess is a good suggestion.  Otherwise, perhaps the curl extension is installed and you can workaround to use that instead?

Message-ID: <4E158CD8020000A400011263@gwsmtp1.smith.edu>

Hey guys,
 
I'd like to spruce up my html/php pages with more dynamic elements and JS/AJAX/JQUERY/JSON type stuff.  My stuff has been mostly html and php to date, only played with javascript a little.  However, I see value in adding more dynamic elements to my pages (showing/hiding div content, calls to php from the page without reloading, etc.).
 
I'm looking for a book that will cover the basics and get me up and running, but also has room to grow and get into more intermediate/advanced stuff.
 
Any thoughts or recommendations would be most appreciated.

Look into a jquery book....Its the easiest way to go because it deals with the individual brower issues internally....

JavaScript The Definitive Guide:

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=JavaScript+The+Definitive+Guide

This is the only book I would trust.  It covers jQuery as well in the 
later chapters (6th edition only).  On top of that it is an excellent 
resource to read if you are delving into Node.js and want to learn more 
about closures, callback functions, and real inner workings of EMCA 
script and how it applies to client side as well as server programming.

Hi Margaret,
     I'm sure there are some WP plugins out there that use ajax to
work but it's not too difficult to create your own solutions. What
types of ajax features do you want to create?

Darryle,

I see the file showcase.js in the themes/js directory uses jquery, which 
means jquery must be included, which means it should have ajax 
functionality.  And, don't worry about the details of my project.  That's my 
problem.  :-)

Hey Margaret,
       1. Just because a file uses jquery that doesn't mean it has
ajax functionality. You still have to make the ajax call on your own
if the showcase.js file isn't doing so.
       2. I'm not worried about  the details of your project. I was
going to help you and provide a solution on how I used my own jquery
ajax solution for my own wordpress project, but like you so
professionally said it "that's your problem".  Good luck.

Margaret,

This list exists to help php developers connect and create solutions - 
we have some very deeply involved members that can answer some deep 
questions - hopefully next time you ask a question on here you're able 
to share details of what you are trying to do - chances are someone here 
has already solved it or can take your project from a week to a day with 
their answers. Intellectual Property and Confidentiality often get in 
the way of speed and growth but if a client is willing to pay you more 
then it's sometimes worthwhile.

hope you find the answer to your need!

It crossed my mind that it may not be the full jquery library.  I'll find 
out when I go to test my code.

Hey Margaret,
       1. Just because a file uses jquery that doesn't mean it has
ajax functionality. You still have to make the ajax call on your own
if the showcase.js file isn't doing so.
       2. I'm not worried about  the details of your project. I was
going to help you and provide a solution on how I used my own jquery
ajax solution for my own wordpress project, but like you so
professionally said it "that's your problem".  Good luck.

A grep on ajax on the jquery.js file spewed out lotsa code.  Looks like I'll 
be good.

Margaret,

Your best bet for jQuery AJAX is to use the $.ajax function to route 
your asynchronous communications.  All you need to do is include the 
main jQuery file and then define your $.ajax function(s) wherever 
appropriate.  The function has inbuilt success & error methods which 
capture your returned stuff from PHP and allow you to pass it through 
into the DOM.

See here for comprehensive documentation:
http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

YVW Robert.  Be aware of "gotchas" such as that JSON is the default 
$data type and its syntax is very unforgiving.   What gets returned as 
the $msg is whatever text is generated by your PHP file.  So if you do 
an AJAX POST to a PHP script that prints out "This AJAX stuff really is 
easy" that text will get passed right back into your success method and 
you can dump it into a div or whatever you need to do.

I was going to use $.ajax, but I thought $.post looked prettier.  What I'm 
doing with this is very simple.  It's just return and success/failure code 
via xml.

Margaret,

Your best bet for jQuery AJAX is to use the $.ajax function to route
your asynchronous communications.  All you need to do is include the
main jQuery file and then define your $.ajax function(s) wherever
appropriate.  The function has inbuilt success & error methods which
capture your returned stuff from PHP and allow you to pass it through
into the DOM.

See here for comprehensive documentation:

$.post is easier to configure but has less flexibility.  If it has all 
the functionality that you need for the specific instance you have, that 
works!!

You can do this with $.post

var jqxhr = $.post("example.php", function() {
      alert("success");
    })
    .success(function() { alert("second success"); })

    .complete(function() { alert("complete"); });

I'll just through in an .error to $(div.formDiv).html("Access Failed.

Anyway, I better stop because this is a php forum.  Anyone know of a good 
javascript forum, I have a question about processing the xml in jquery 
returned from post.  I know how to process it with straight javascript.

$.post is easier to configure but has less flexibility.  If it has all
the functionality that you need for the specific instance you have, that
works!!

You can do this with $.post

var jqxhr = $.post("example.php", function() {
      alert("success");
    })
    .success(function() { alert("second success"); })
    .error(function() { alert("error"); })
    .complete(function() { alert("complete"); });

I'll just through in an .error to $(div.formDiv).html("Access Failed.

I don't think jquery provides any utilities for handling XML. You might find a plugin that does it - but there's no reason not to use straight javascript if you know something that works.

I don't have a javascript forum to recommend.  It could be worthy of a special nyphp-js list here since javascript and php go pretty hand in hand these days and I'm sure many people here are experts in javascript in addition to php. Or actually, I think we have a nyphp-frontend list already. I guess the only problem is those special lists don't see the same amount of activity as the nyphp-talk list.

400 sounds like a server response code not a cURL error code...

HTTP response code 400 is a syntax error in your HTTP request.

Oh, PS and 201 means that you probably achieved what you were trying
to do ;)  So no wonder you are tired....

10.2.2 201 Created

   The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being
   created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s)
   returned in the entity of the response, with the most specific URI
   for the resource given by a Location header field. The response
   SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource
   characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can
   choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by
   the media type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin
   server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code.
   If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server SHOULD
   respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.

   A 201 response MAY contain an ETag response header field indicating
   the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant just
   created, see section 14.19.

Let's face it, there is NO other list anywhere that can hope to measure
up to the NY-PHP list.

Why?

There is already a mailing list - NYPHP SIG: Front End that covers
JavaScript / jQuery /JSON. You can join at nyphp.org

Subject: [nycphp-talk] cookies and experiation
Message-ID: <0B6ECA7F976B43C4B39E706B725DDA8A@michelePC>

I wanted to create a cookie that basically never expires.

time() + x

We can live to say 100 or so, so say 125 years expiration would be good.

time() + 3944700000

But that number is too big.

Intval says on a 32 bit machine max is 2147483647.

So 2147483647 ? time() = 4294967294, which is bigger than 2147483647

2147483647 = 68 years but because I?m adding time it grows bigger than the bigger integer

But I really can only do this 2147483647  - time() = 837178076 26 years

But php wasn?t crapping out on 290000000 + time(), so what really is the biggest integer

Time today =            1310305571
Time tomorrow =     1310391971
Next year will be =   1341863171 (42 years)
In 20 years will be = 1372420841 (52 years)

So, 2147483647 ? time in 20 year (1372420841) = 775062806 approx 23 years

The numbers don?t look quite right but at time increases the life time you can extend in ints decreases.

So, instead of just adding a value to time, I should

$newLife = 2147483647  - time();

setcookie(?name?, ?val?, time() + newLife);

I?m sure by the time, time() grows to be so big that this formula is an issue, integers will be big enough to handle it?

Anyway, does anyone know the real max size of an integer? Cause it ain?t 2147483647 like the docs say for a 32 bit machine.

PHP has some useful predefined constants, particularly PHP_INT_MAX in this
case (http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php).  What you should
really be doing while setting the cookie is ignoring time() completely, and
just set the expiration time to the maximum size of an integer.

  setcookie(?name?, ?val?, PHP_INT_MAX);

This way, the cookie expires in 2038 for everyone, which is the furthest
expiration you can set anyway.

On a more theoretical note, there really isn't a need to set a cookie's
expiration date beyond, let's say 5 years.  For that cookie to even still be
alive, you have to hope that the user:
- is using the same computer for five years
- has never reformatted the hard drive or re-installed a fresh OS
- has never switched browsers
- has never cleared their cookies

I'd say a combination of all of the above is extremely rare, and I can't
really think of a good use-case where a cookie would still be useful 5 years
from now, given that the internet is constantly evolving.

It's platform/operating system dependent.  Things tend to get hairy over
2^53.  There's bcmath if you need big numbers or significant precision.

I?ve thought of all of this ...

- has never reformatted the hard drive or re-installed a fresh OS
- has never switched browsers
- has never cleared their cookies

Message-ID: <CAGMFw4j-o02tzHTHWELNtm4VfNSz4U2Xn6c2+-B1zcHwv+_ZUA@mail.gmail.com>

I just found a major mistake in one of my websites. The Google rank
for the primary page has always been inexplicably horrible. Then I
found out that Google decreases the ranking of a page if it contains
content that is largely duplicated elsewhere such as on an adjacent
page. Turns out that index.html was just a symbolic link to the page
with a bad rank. Meaning Google was indexing the same exact page
through two slightly different URLs.

I now generate the pages separately with one containing <meta
name="robots" content="noindex"/> (which unfortunately has to be
index.html because the other page has good external links) so
hopefully that will clear up any penalty for duplicate content.

Anyway, if anyone knows of other Google rank pitfalls to avoid, I
would be delighted to hear about them.

Take a look at <link rel="canonical" href="put the primary url for the content here" /> and put that in all of your pages with the same content.

The reason you cannot add 125 years is the 2038 problem.  A simple solution
is to set the expiration date to Jan 1, 2038.

Your "solution" will make things worse with google.  There is no "duplicate"
content pentalty, but there is a "scraper" penalty, and I doubt that is
being applied in your case.  "noindex" tells google that you have a page
that customers can and should see, but the googlebot specifically doesn't
have permission to view it.  That is not likely to help your cause with
google.

The best solution, is to 301 redirect to the canonical page.  If you can't
do that, then use Rob's suggestion of <link rel="canonical"...

The reason you cannot add 125 years is the 2038 problem.  A simple solution is to set the expiration date to Jan 1, 2038.

  PHP has some useful predefined constants, particularly PHP_INT_MAX in this case (http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php).  What you should really be doing while setting the cookie is ignoring time() completely, and just set the expiration time to the maximum size of an integer.

    setcookie(?name?, ?val?, PHP_INT_MAX);

  This way, the cookie expires in 2038 for everyone, which is the furthest expiration you can set anyway.

  On a more theoretical note, there really isn't a need to set a cookie's expiration date beyond, let's say 5 years.  For that cookie to even still be alive, you have to hope that the user:
  - is using the same computer for five years
  - has never reformatted the hard drive or re-installed a fresh OS
  - has never switched browsers
  - has never cleared their cookies

  I'd say a combination of all of the above is extremely rare, and I can't really think of a good use-case where a cookie would still be useful 5 years from now, given that the internet is constantly evolving.

This is the only book I would trust.  It covers jQuery as well in the later chapters (6th edition only).  On top of that it is an excellent resource to read if you are delving into Node.js and want to learn more about closures, callback functions, and real inner workings of EMCA script and how it applies to client side as well as server programming.

Hey guys,
 
I'd like to spruce up my html/php pages with more dynamic elements and JS/AJAX/JQUERY/JSON type stuff.  My stuff has been mostly html and php to date, only played with javascript a little.  However, I see value in adding more dynamic elements to my pages (showing/hiding div content, calls to php from the page without reloading, etc.).
 
I'm looking for a book that will cover the basics and get me up and running, but also has room to grow and get into more intermediate/advanced stuff.
 
Any thoughts or recommendations would be most appreciated.

Pondering how to approach a situation where the application needs to count
on a certain string to be in certain database rows in order to know what to
do. Without going into excruciating detail, let me ask if you think there
are cases where it's good practice to basically hard-code in some rows of a
table certain data that your application needs, and somehow mark them as
immutable -- at the application level, stop the user from touching them.
Other rows in the same table would be fair game -- they can add, modify and
delete.

Comments?

Well, I'm not totally convinced, and I haven't described my scenario in any
detail to try to convince you. But it's food for thought that I will duly
consider.

Whenever I see myself getting too fancy, Occam's Razor makes me skeptical of
my own thinking. And I do have the Razor here hovering over my shoulder.

Yes, is called permission and it make sense, same as file system there can
be users that have limited access on some contents

It's simple just add a permission table :) linked to the content table and
to the users and to the groups:
Permission ( permission_id, content_id, users_id, group_id, permission )

Also normalization is not always necessary in my experience I found faster
and easier sometimes to just "brake the law" and keep all info on a single
table, not elegant but if works better/faster why not?

My 2 cents

Well, I'm not totally convinced, and I haven't described my scenario in any
detail to try to convince you. But it's food for thought that I will duly
consider.

Whenever I see myself getting too fancy, Occam's Razor makes me skeptical of
my own thinking. And I do have the Razor here hovering over my shoulder.

Why not simply add a second table, one that is free game and one that is set 
to read-only. They will have the same structure and technically the same 
function, but the permissions are different. May not be the best approach, but 
strikes me to be better than mushing it all into one table. Or is there a 
technical need for this?
Then again, if those records are never to be changed by users, why have them 
in the database to begin with. Some may disagree, but I think that anything 
static has no place in a database. Put it in flat file somewhere or if it 
truely is never to change hard code it.

totally no, how you get a complete query of both? You should merge them and
order the ID, and it's very performance killing.
Just use the filesystem solution, a permission flag, that's pretty easy
right?

I hesitate to bore you with my details, but -- you can stop reading if it
gets too boring.

The application will manage judiciary interpreters (yeah, same project for
the past 8 years or so) in the office where i work ( as a court interpreter;
code monkey isn't in my formal job description at all (-: ).

There's an entity called an "event." Its attributes include: date, time,
language_id, event_type_id, location_id, and so forth. Naturally, there's a
related table called event_types for storing the kinds of things we do:
plea; sentencing; arraignment; attorney/client interview; etc. There's much
more to be said about the db design, but I'll skip it.

event_types have an attribute "in_court? which is boolean. Things are either
in-court, or they are ancillary events like attorney-client interviews.
(This is important; the suits in Washington require federal courts to report
interpreter usage based on such things).

Fast forward to the user interface for creating/editing events. I want to
intelligently guess the default location based on the event type. (A judge
has a default courtroom usually, though in some cases not: some have only a
default courthouse. My locations model supports one level of nesting. A
courtroom is in a courthouse but both are locations.)

Now we come to some Javascript: an event handler that fires when the change
event on the "judge" select element happens. This handler looks at the
event_type to decide whether to set the location controls to that judge's
default courtroom, or not. I will have already loaded a JSON data structure
that tells me if an event_type is in_court or out. (There's much more: e.g.,
I get the judge's default location info via xhr and cache it; so first I
look in the cache to see if it's already there. Yesterday I created a flow
chart on a large marker board to get a clearer picture in my mind, and
confirmed the obvious:  it seems complicated because it is complicated.)

The plot thickens if the event_type is out of court. if it's out, it's
usually still in a courthouse, so I want to leave what a call the parent
location (the building, basically) consistent with the judge's default.
Unless the event_type is of type "probation interview" which is almost
invariably held outside any courthouse:  those happen in jails and US
probation offices. Therefore, if the user selects "probation interview" I
don't want to default to any location, but make her choose (note my PC use
of what I call the counter-sexist "she." Actually everyone is my office is
female except me, so the odds are that the user is indeed a she (-:).

So, should my JS code examine the currently selected event_type option to
see if it matches the string "probation interview?" That would do fine,
unless a user with admin privileges decides to edit the name of that
particular event_type beyond recognition and breaks my javascript. Hence my
conclusion that this application needs to have certain event_types -- I
think of them as "core" event types -- that are loaded into the database at
setup time and are never messed with again. There's a logical business basis
for that:  there are certain kinds of courtroom events that you are
absolutely going to need, so why not get them in there up front. Thereafter,
users at a certain privilege level can add other event types as needed --
occasionally some new exotic thing may arise; edit them when they decide
they spelled it wrong; delete them (if the event_type has no related rows
and they change their mind).

I don't think it makes sense to have two different tables, as in "basic"
event_types that ship with the app, and "custom" that the user creates. That
would make for torture when it comes time to figure out which table you need
events to JOIN with.  btw I have seen db designs in which you had a column
for a foreign key, and another column to tell you which damn table to FK
pointed to. Obviously this is for myisam or similar, not db-level FK
relationships. I think that's a bad idea and don't wanna do that (again (-:
)

Better, it seems, is to somehow mark my sacred rows as such. At the UI level
I simply won't provide a way to edit them. At the model level I will throw
an exception if they try to update|delete them. So I'm planning to add a
boolean "mutable" to my event_types for that purpose. (Pseudo-boolean, if
you will, since this is MySQL).

PS:  My weapons of choice are MySQL, Zend Framework, and JQuery. When it's
all done, this will be far and away the most ass-kicking federal court
interpreter management application known to humankind.

Comments?

It sounds like you really just need to change the way in_court is used, 
having multiple options instead of just yes/no.

Then your javascript can key off that and your users can create any 
event types they require and specify where they take place.

In my previous description of the case, for brevity's sake I lied about
in_court being boolean. There already is 1, 0 and -1. To the application -1
means "not applicable" and it's for one thing we interpreters sometimes do
-- translate written documents -- which really isn't "in" or "out," and
which per the business requirements is counted differently from all the
rest.  If I were to have another value signifying "usually even further
'out', like off-site" that would seem appropriate from one point of view but
it smells a little funny. The location is not and shouldn't be tightly bound
to the event_type; rather, it's an attribute of the event. I made the
mistake of coupling the what with the where in my last iteration of this
project, and it came back to bite me.

Looks litke there needs to be some pain however I slice it; the model is
complex because the reality it models is complex. But Dan's approach feels
like it's the right track, so many thanks again -- to all.

Hi David,

PHP has ID3 functions. Here's where you can find it in the reference
manual: http://php.net/id3

Cheers!

Have you thought about giving event_type a few different edit levels (in 
a single field - edit_level).  That way you can edit anything (your 
level would be 1 higher than the highest level in the table).  Each 
event has a level the user has to be in order to be able to edit it.  
Default level is the level of the user creating it.  Some users would 
have higher levels, since they understand the data (or can make your 
life miserable).

If I understand the problem, that should work.  If it won't work, I 
don't understand the problem.  Which wouldn't be unusual - it's about 90 
degrees, the end of a long day of debugging and "hello" is a major 
undertaking right now.  But I run into this sort of thing a few times a 
day (I write a lot of web pages), and I usually just brute-force it.  
Elegant is nice, but sometimes it just has to work, and it has to work 
now.  Once it's working and out there, you can play with it on a local 
server and code it so that the flow chart looks nice.

Thanks for the suggestion. I was considering solutions tending in that
direction, then realized (thanks to a nudge from D. Cech) what I really
needed was slightly more fine-grained metadata about each of my OPTION
elements. I ended up tweaking my database design and using css class
attributes to mark my OPTIONs as belonging to this or that category. Kind of
like, <option class="fish" label="salmon" value="123">salmon</option>.

Maybe what I really need is HTML5 custom attributes, but I think this will
do for now.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Reading/writing id3v2 tags from MP3 files in PHP?
Message-ID: <665AF97C-9EB2-4C47-A08B-EEB427FF152A@gmail.com>

Hi Nick.

Thanks for the reply. It turns out for writing tags, those PHP  
routines don't support v2 which I needed.

Now for the gory details. :-)

However, I did find a solution that worked. There is a command line  
Linux utility called id3v2 which I installed on CentOS.

I ended up writing a PHP program which wrote a shell script to handle  
the passing of the data needed for the parameters to id3v2. Then I ran  
the shell script.

I did want to get the program length of each MP3 to write this to a  
MySQL database, so I did use PHP's shell_exec with command line  
mp3info to get the program runtime.

The other thing I learned about this is that iTunes uses a later  
version of id3v2 (id3v2.2), so you can't write all the tags it uses  
with the id3v2 software although it can read it.

And to convert them to podcast files which remember the position and  
to skip during shuffle, that actually had to be done in iTunes itself.  
Apparently that is a function of iTunes and likely stored in its own  
XML file. Luckily,  the user can select multiple MP3 files after they  
have been imported to iTunes and globally change them to do this.

All this helped make an archive of old radio shows much more enjoyable  
to use.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Usernames with whitespace
Message-ID: <CAH3aafUSK5emcqq4vf4_EbsmXW3ceNWacq1KObeF_=+BtXCOqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,
What are your thoughts on allowing usernames with spaces, e.g. "john
smith". They're often disallowed and I was wondering on your thoughts
as to why that might be.
One reason I can think of is to avoid confusingly similar usernames,
e.g. "john smith" and "john  smith" (2 spaces)
In those cases wouldn't collapsing multiple spaces into a single space
be a more conservative solution than disallowing the character
entirely?
