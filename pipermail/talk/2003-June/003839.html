There are mainly two sets of Chinese characters. One is GB2312 system,
another is Big5 system. GB2312 is mainly used by MainLand China, Big5 is
mainly used by Chinese overseas, Taiwan, Hongkong. so you need to make
decision where is your marketplace and which one is suitable, or you
want to handle them all. But I guess you need both, since more more
Mainland Chinese people are come to aboard, it will be very soon to
become the majority of Chinese overseas. IE can handle both Chinese
character sets, for Netscape you may need a third party encoding
software to handle the display, but those are free. Here is one you may
use: <A HREF="http://www.njstar.com">http://www.njstar.com</A> . Msql database has no problem to handle
chinese Character. 
There are two ways to handle those two Chinese Character sets. 1)Dynamic
interface handling, you may need a convert program to convert those Char
sets each other, there are some programs are free to download, but I
don't know where. Usually it is perl or c++ program. 2)Static web
contents. This is the easy one, you can prepare two sets of your web
contents, and disply them seperately. So totally will be three sets of
them, 2 Chinese and 1 English. There is the way OSCommerce handles
multiple languages.

Hope it may help little bit!
