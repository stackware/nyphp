<PRE>My jaded 2 cents...

It's cheaper for your employer to use the most experienced Drupal  
developer for Drupal work.

You can probably get Drupal things done very quickly compared to  
others at your workplace... quick=profit (or getting the job in the  
first place.)

I would guess that your career development is not at the top of the  
priority list for your employer.

Maybe there is a compromise?

Better for everyone if you don't have to leave...
