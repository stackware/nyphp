<PRE>So, as I see it -- natively Android will only sync with Outlook
Contacts.

So can one get full Outlook Contacts/Email/Tasks sync to myTouch.

Does one ad hoc this by first, setup a google Calendar. 
Sync Outlook to Calendar. Calendar to myTouch.

Also, Netflix may be up for sale to MSFT or AMZN. Hmmm.

 

Warmest regards,

Ive spent years following developments in the mobile space (Im a refugee

from the Psion / Symbian world :-)

&gt;<i> T-Mobile HTC &quot;myTouch&quot; w/ google Android OS (brand new, Aug 5 09)

I just pulled the trigger and ordered this last week. Ill explain why a 
bit later.
 
&gt;<i> Sprint Palm Pre (new, mid-Jun 09) 
</I>
Pre is great if you dont mind being on Sprint's US-only network (or
maybe 
you dont mind paying the exorbitant amount to acquire the UK GSM version

unlocked! Has gotten greta reviews and I like the whole
embrace-the-cloud 
concept and universal search concept.

&gt;<i>From a development standpoint, Pre is nice. Any web developer can write
</I>
Pre apps (Basically, you've got a Javascript engine embedded in the 
frontend running on top of a Linux kernel, so unlike the iPhone you can 
access acclerometer, GPS and app data from JavaScript). You use HTML and

CSS to build the GUI. If I had the choice I would probably buy a Pre,
but 
I hate Sprint so Im waiting for a GSM version to come to the US, but
that 
might not happen until late 2010...

&gt;<i> AT&amp;T iPhone 3G S 
</I>
Very nice and pretty good value at $199. Im not a big fan of
Obfuscated-C 
:<i>-) so as a developer its got a steeper learning curve. There are a 
</I>bazillion apps for it and its hard sorting the wheat from the chaff. But

being locked on AT&amp;T's network is a drag for me. That said, it is a nice

phone.

&gt;<i> T-Mobile RIM Blackberry Curve 8900
</I>
I like the haptic feedback of the Storm more than the Curve. Development

environment is (like Android) Java-based. More business-oriented, so I 
never think of them as 'sexy'.
 
&gt;<i> T-Mobile Samsung Comeback SGH-T559 
</I>
Did not (along with the envy) make my smartphone &quot;A&quot; list :-)


So why did I order the Ion / Magic / G2 / myTouch ?

Pre was actually my top choice but Im never going back to Sprint. While
Im 
waiting (hoping?) for a GSM Pre (or some other webOS device like the
Eos) 
I decided I needed a smartphone now even if I only get a year of usage
out 
of it.

Im a T-Mobile customer and I didn't want to switch carrier and T-Mobile 
have plenty of roaming coverage in Europe which was important to me.
Also 
when deciding between Android and iPhone, the fact that Android is open 
source was a major factor in my decision to look at the myTouch over the

iPhone. The G2 is quad-band and has gotten good reviews. T-Mobile are 
running a pre-sale for existing customers so we get it first for $199. I

should get mine the first week of August.

(You might also consider the HTC Hero which runs Android and has a 
stunning UI, BUT the reviews I read said the hardware was not quite up
to 
the task. The last I heard, the FCC had approved a version that looks
like 
it could run on Sprint's network. Finally, a T-Mobile exec mentioned
they 
had no plan to offer the Hero on their network, so that was that).
