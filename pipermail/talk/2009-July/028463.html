<PRE>Oh I hope it didn't seem like I was incompetent in PHP, far from it.  Just
that every project I get is Drupal based and I want to branch out.  All I
can put on my resume is Drupal, Drupal, and more Drupal!  I worked with it
for 1.5 years.  Built about twenty custom modules.  Installed memcache a
dozen or so times.  Wrote different nodes from scratch and have figured out
the Views/Panels/Taxonomy CF.  Just that I don't want to do it anymore, it
is tiring and there are better ways to do it.  I was graced with the ability
to work with CakePHP for two weeks and was the happiest developer in the
world cause it was OOP based and made building a functioning site from
scratch easy, the the clients with Drupal all reared their ugly head and
that was the end of CakePHP for me.
