If you have informed the client of how the end user will preceive the application as broken because there was inventory available when they placed an item in the cart, but the inventory was gone by the time they checked out, and they still want to go with the FIFO, then you need to consider how important this client is to your business.  If they are not that important, then stand on principle, state that you can't intentionally develop a defective application, then see how the cookie crumbles.  If they are important to your business, make sure they understand that the only reason you are developing the application in a way you consider defective is because they have asked for it, and you will not be held responsible if later their customers are complaining about this defective behavior.  You may also want to put code in to track when this situation occurs.  This way, when you see a high occurance of this, you can inform your client that your warning is coming true.

  Yes thanx, however, the client wanted a "FIFO" solution which means that if there are 30 items in stock and you ordered all 30 while someone else ordered 1, both of you will see 30 in stock until one of you checks out; whoever checks out first, wins!

    Phil,

    The way this is done in the manufacturing world is with an "inventory allocated" field.  This field holds the number of quantity of your current inventory that is "held" or allocated for another purpose, such as checkout.  Similar to inventory in a store, nothing should get removed from inventory until it is sold.  What this means to you - I would decrement inventory on the screen, and if he is that particular about it, display both the inventory and the allocated fields.

    However, with this said, personally I feel that you need to do whatever the customer is asking for, as long as it is in the scope and budget of the project.  As a consultant, it is your job to inform him of the risks involved (which you have done), but ultimately do what he asks.

    Phil, I hope you are doing this job for ALOT more than the last one (architecture for $68, remember?). :-)

    Good Luck!

    Tom

      ...am I cursed?

      Another client is threatening to "delete everything" calling my work a "waste of time".  There is, however, one possible sane reason for this, and I need to get some PHP guru advice on how to handle this.

      You have ordered one item and placed it into your cart.  Let's say you ordered one small black t-shirt.  Your cart will have the product_id, color_id and size_id for the small black t-shirt.  The quantity of this item is, let's say 30.  You have one in your cart, so how many are available:

      1) 29
      2) 30

      Now let's say that while I ordered one small black t-shirt, Sven ordered 1 small black t-shirt, Anders ordered one black t-shirt, and Olov ordered one black t-shirt.  If all four of us, at one time, are all ordering the same item and putting it into our carts, how many should there be available to us:

      1) 26
      2) 25
      3) 29
      4) 30

      This is where the contention comes in.  The client wants it done "FIFO" (First In First Out) meaning that whoever gets it first will subtract the quantity - but I dispute that (coming from somewhat of a Java background) that since PHP doesn't so single-threading, that means that all four of us could order t-shirts,  but the quantity has to reflect that all four of us are ordering (multi-threading).

      I dunno, help!

1. From my personal experience, this doesn't happen all that often. 
The success (or lack of) the site will have little to do with how you deal with this situation.

2. If you want my $0.02, I think the solution is really better approached from a UI perspective.
Don't show an inventory on the product page.
If the product has several variants (like A shirt with sizes and colors) there is no good way of showing inventory even if you wanted to. If the product has only 1 variant (like a music CD), if you really have to, just show a general term for inventory levels on the product page, something like: "In stock", "Only a few left", "Out of stock". Then whenever you decide to actually decrease stock levels, do the check.

Is there a way within the class "constructor" function to verify if a
parameter passed into the class has retained its value? I keep apparently
losing the parameter value somewhere in the structure of the class and I
can't figure out how to verify when/if it gets lost.

The class I can't copy onto here, unless you want to see a class that's 200
lines long and has 30 parameters.

Hey,

I have a small batch of dates that I'd like to get into a db.  Almost
all of them are specific, eg October 1.  However, a few refer to things
that happen around a certain time.  For example students' "Housing bill
for spring semester due" is listed as 'Early January'.

So, I'm not sure how to set up the db to accomodate the oddballs.  Any
suggestions would be much appreciated.

thanks,
Dave

How about adding a column for date modifiers with options like "on date or within next 15 days" or something, and then change the oddballs to regular dates (search and replace) and just have entries in the date modifiers column for them?

I've dealt with almost the same thing.  Very often, patients will say "I was sick in March" or "I came down with xyz in 1970".

I wrote http://pcomd.net/Ymd to handle these types of things (you can just download/copy the source without worrying about the pCom part of it) and it's worked great.  While the code is tuned for MySQL the premise remains the same for any DB; use ISO dates, which have no problem being ambiguous and are super fast/portable (they're just ints).  The only items I see that Ymd wouldn't address for you is stating "early xyz...", and they require at least a year to be used (although these could be hacked out).

What you want to do involves setting up some 'fuzzy' sets
for use with 'fuzzy' logic.
e.g
 "early in the week" is in the set of ('Mon', 'Tue' )
 "middle of the week is in the set of ('Tue', 'Wed'. Thu')
    "end of the week is in the set of ( 'Thu', 'Fri')

Typically such sets are used for queries (instead of input)
like "What do I have scheduled for the "end of the week"?

However you could associate a key phrase like "mid-week" for
input.

This means you would have no way to connect via secure

Message-ID: <20031002011516.95144.qmail@web13601.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi guys,
I am trying to get linkpoint select API integrated into an osCommerce installation and get the following error at the very first step.
Fatal error: Call to undefined function: curl_init() 
 
I asked for cURL to be installed and after a short time I was told that he got it installed from instructions found at some website (http://www.viaverio.com/support/virtual/admin/curl/index.cfm ) but the phpinfo doesnt show any section which says that curl is installed/enabled.
I do see curl in the config line as below..
'--with-curl=shared,/usr/local/curl' 
 
but even now I get the fatal error .. anything I missed? . help anyone!
I can put up a public phpinfo if required ..
 
thanks,
Vinay

Hi Vinay,

Since you are compiling the cURL extension as a shared library, the module must
be loaded in your php.ini.  You'll need to add something like:
    extension=curl.so
I'm not sure of the actual name of the library, but you should find it in
/usr/lib/php4 or somewhere similar.

If you don't have that file the attempt to add curl support may have failed.
You'll want to look at the output of the configure script to be sure it found
everything it needed for curl support.

Hope that helps and good luck with the LP Select API.

Andrew

Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT: Apache access_log integrity
Message-ID: <BAY2-F105ELi1UdHqn5000063fb@hotmail.com>

Folks,

I'm trying to trim the fat from Apache's access_log: removing my own IP 
addresses from the log; stripping referer spam; bots; etc.

While I understand that I can exclude known IP addresses and other common 
patterns via mod_setenvif, I'd like to be able to do this on an ad hoc basis 
when I notice certain spikes in useless records in the log and/or when my IP 
changes when hitting my own site from various wireless points.

My first idea was to grep the logs by using a shell or Perl script that I 
could add to my daily cron or call arbitrarily like so:

#!/bin/sh
grep -v "192.168.1.1" /var/log/apache/access_log > 
/var/log/apache/access_log.tmp
mv /var/log/apache/access_log.tmp /var/log/apache/access_log
/export/home/krook/bin/restart-apache.sh

Of course, this has the drawback of restarting Apache everytime the 
access_log is changed by the script, but the second or two of down time is 
acceptable if it means logs that can be regularly analyzed for useful 
reports that don't have "http://jeff-knights-online-viagra-megastore" as my 
top referer.

I'd like to know if anyone else had addressed this problem in a sucessful 
way or has any best practice, either via mod_setenvif, Perl, CLI PHP, cron 
etc.

I've Googled the following topics without any good results:
"strip line from access_log perl"
"clean access_log"
"setEnvIf"
"eliminate referer spam access_log"
"remove line from log"


Thanks in advance for any tips.

Hey Folks:

Here's the note I just fired off to Zeev about my experiences with their 
site and the new Zend Studio IDE.

Subject: TONS of difficulties getting/using Studio 3

Greetings Zeev:

Congratulations on launching version 3 of Zend Studio.  Daniel Kushner
provided a demonstration of the IDE at the September meeting of the NYPHP
group.  I subsequently downloaded the package for a test spin.

Unfortunately, nearly every step of the process was problematic.  So, like
the version 2.6 I tried a while back, the problems outweighed the
price/benefit ratio, so I decided not to purchase the IDE at this point.  
Here's what happened.

* Discount Period
Thank you for providing a 50% discount code for the NYPHP group.  The
code's expiration date offered only three days for playing with things.  
This rubbed me the wrong way.

* Upgrade Terms
The one year upgrade period also seems unusually short.

* Website Advanced Search
Submitting terms from the Advanced Search form lead (and still does) to a
nonexistent page.

* Website Contact Form Bugs
I went to report the search problem via the contact form.  Upon submitting 
it, there was no indication that there was an error nor that the message 
was sent.  I subsequently realized this was because I'd left off the 
browser, which was a required field.  A warning should have been provided.

* Website's VERY Small Fonts
Fonts on the site are set via px.  Worse, they're set to a very small px 
size.  Lower case letters wind up being only 1.5mm tall on my screen.  
OUCH!

* Website Information Center Requires JavaScript
This section is completely useless without JavaScript turned on.  This is
unnecessary -- particularly from the makers of the world's greatest server
side language.  Worse, no message is displayed saying JS is needed.  All 
one sees is the navigation links and two blank panes below.

* Download
Downloading the files requires cookies and JavaScript.  Again, not 
only is this lame, there's no indication that this is the case.

* Activation Information Email
This email wound up being a huge chunk of HTML marketing crap.  It wound 
up getting cought by my spam filters.  Geez.  All we need is the 
activation code, please.

* Installation: Choose Components
On Windows 2000, this dialog box has the background color hard coded to 
white, while the text color is left to Windows' default window text 
color... which on my system is white.  Makes this screen impossible to 
read.

* Colors of File/Project Pane & Code Completion Box
Similar background color settings conflicts occurred in the IDE itself.

* PHP Version Warning
I'm using development builds of PHP 5 on my system.  So, when the 
debugger system is turned on, I get a series of message box warnings for 
each HTTP request.  No fun.

* Debug/Profile Command Line Scripts
The IDE GUI doesn't have the ability to deal with command line scripts.
This is a major shortcomming for me, since these are my biggest projects. 
Users should be able to type in a script name and arguments and have the 
system debug/profile the results.


I hope these experiences provide guidance for improving Zend's website and 
software.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

L'shana tovah, if you're into that stuff.

Thanks,

--Dan

Did you look at Webalizer, an app that has many startup config options that
allow you to remove/massage info to generate focused reports and charts from
Apache logs. Also, cron to grab, analyze and archive your logs
systematically. 
Then maybe you could do some set it and forget it type of processing. PSaw

I haven't had to do this type of thing exactly, but an idea that just popped in there:  CustomLog can take a pipe instead of a flat file (see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog for syntax).  For example:

CustomLog |speciallogger.psh

where specialogger.psh is a PHP CLI, of course :)  specialogger.psh could then have some scheme to ignore certain types of lines that come in on stdin, or log them in some preferred way (via mysql,file,etc).  It could also speak to a DB, which would determine what lines are ignored and which are not (maybe just via a set of regexs).  There's a lot of possibilities, and would especially be handy for sites without huge amounts of traffic (although I could see it tuned for even those with a lot of traffic).

And it would make a cool sig (with proper attribution, of course). Out of

from the blow-your-own-horn dept:

There's a Spanish<>English court interpreters glossary application that I
wrote with MySQL/PHP. The private read-write version lets the user insert,
update, delete. However we have also put a read-only public version out
there:

	http://sdnyinterpreters.org/term/

Now here's the point. Some French terminologists run a site called
lexicool.com that finds, evaluates and ranks web-based multilingual
dictionaries and glossaries -- translators' tools, basically -- based on
presentation and useablility. And in the category of Spanish<>English
Legal/Administration the winner is.... no not me, a United Nations site
was first, but ours was second in a field of 54.

Note that both First and Second Place go to organizations based in NY. I
love NY!

That does explain it, but it sort of defeats the purpose of having a
maximum_execution_time directive in this case. I would think that a large
percentage of PHP scripts have some kind of external processing going on,
particularly DB connectivity. Anyways, thanks for the side note!

For each day of the week, I have an opening time and closing time for a

After some fumbling and stumbling I seem to have things working OK.  
However, right now I am naming each form element/post variable 
individually to put the data into session_register, which could be a 
pain the longer the form gets!  I would like to, as Adam put it, "stuff 
the POSTed data" into $_SESSION using $_POST but I don't see how to do 
this.

Example my code:
session_start();
session_register('first_name','last_name',etc.,etc.many more fields to 
follow...);
header ("Location: session_results.php");
exit;

Session Results page:
session_start();
echo "$_SESSION[first_name]";

Whenever I start trying to use session_register with _POST things go 
south quick.

Hints/suggestions?

TIA,

saving the _POST array should work with no problems...


using your example code (_POST array has first_name, last_name):

session_start();
session_register('_POST'); 
$_SESSION['_POST'] = $_POST;
header ("Location: session_results.php");
exit;

Session Results page:

session_start();
$_POST = $_SESSION['_POST'];

echo $_POST['first_name'];
echo $_POST['last_name'];

You can forget the session register and use $_SESSION instead:

session_start();
$_SESSION['foo'] = $_POST['foo'];

But, before I continue, I should point out that my example code here leaves out
the most important step:

Make sure $_POST['foo'] is exactly what you think it should be. Always filter
your data. You should validate $_POST['foo'] and then put it into
$_SESSION['foo'].

If security was absolutely no concern, you could throw everything from $_POST
into your session like this:

$_SESSION = $_POST

But that is very bad. So, don't let the inconvenience dissuade you from being
mindful about security.

> header ("Location: session_results.php");

The URL in a Location header should be absolute:

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt

In section 14.30, the syntax for the Location header is defined:

"The field value consists of a single absolute URI."

Hope that helps.

How about something like the code below? It's the same kind of logic you use
when you're printing out a list of date-sorted items and you want a new
header only when the day changes, e.g. something like

October 1
---------
10:00 Get Haircut
12:00 Eat Lunch

October 2
---------
12:00 Eat Lunch

The idea is that while iterating through your items, you keep track of the
relevant attribute (day) of the current item and compare it to the attribute
of the previous or next item. If the two are different, then it's time to
print a header (or a listing of hours).

I just did this.

session_id(); 
session_start();
$_SESSION = $_POST;

header("Location:myresultspage.php?code=" . session_id());
exit;

And then on the results page....


session_id($_GET['code']);
session_start();
$_POST = $_SESSION;

After some fumbling and stumbling I seem to have things working OK.  
However, right now I am naming each form element/post variable 
individually to put the data into session_register, which could be a 
pain the longer the form gets!  I would like to, as Adam put it, "stuff 
the POSTed data" into $_SESSION using $_POST but I don't see how to do 
this.

Example my code:
session_start();
session_register('first_name','last_name',etc.,etc.many more fields to 
follow...);
header ("Location: session_results.php");
exit;

Session Results page:
session_start();
echo "$_SESSION[first_name]";

Whenever I start trying to use session_register with _POST things go 
south quick.

Hints/suggestions?

TIA,

You just killed anything else you had in the session with that line. You 
probably don't want to overwrite your entire session array.  Use 
something like was suggested before:
$_SESSION['_POST'] = $_POST;
This will still let you access other info that was in your session.

You could also consider array_merge() to update $_SESSION with $_POST
variables -- after your sanity check of course.

$_SESSION = array_merge($_SESSION,$_POST);

That works, thanks!

One thing I am wondering is why one needs to use the line:
$_POST = $_SESSION['_POST'];

If $_SESSION now has the array stored, it seems that this should work:
echo $_SESSION['first_name'];

?

If you used $_SESSION['_POST'] = $_POST then the session array has as an 
element an array containing the post data.  Since you have an array in 
an array you would access it like this:
echo $_SESSION['_POST']['first_name'];

It would if you had used array_merge() instead (-: But you have a
two-dimensional array now, so you need to say

	$_SESSION['_POST']['first_name']

My preferred way of handling this is something like this:

$fields = array('username', 'password', 'zipcode');

foreach ($fields as $f) {
    $_SESSION[$f] = $_POST[$f];
}

This avoids:

1) The $_SESSION clobbering problem.
2) Needing to do $_SESSION['_POST']['username'].

It does require you to update the array when the fields change, but
this way you're guaranteed to only get the fields you want. I like the
array_merge() solution if you want all the variables.

Psaw, Hans and Jon,

Thanks for all the suggestions.   I think I'm going to settle on a 
combination of the following solution:

- a daily cron job that strips by regex my two most common IP variations,
- a standalone script that does the same with given parameters,
- take advantage of Webalizer's exclusion options.  Psaw, thanks for the 
tip, I really didn't realize it was that flexible but it has a ton of great 
conf options that can be used retroactively against already generated 
reports.

Thanks again for the tips, I'll keep you posted if I need to add some more 
processing or if I find a simpler solution.

from the blow-your-own-horn dept:

There's a Spanish<>English court interpreters glossary
application that I
wrote with MySQL/PHP. The private read-write version lets
the user insert,
update, delete. However we have also put a read-only public
version out
there:

	http://sdnyinterpreters.org/term/

Now here's the point. Some French terminologists run a site
called
lexicool.com that finds, evaluates and ranks web-based
multilingual
dictionaries and glossaries -- translators' tools, basically
-- based on
presentation and useablility. And in the category of
Spanish<>English
Legal/Administration the winner is.... no not me, a United
Nations site
was first, but ours was second in a field of 54.

Note that both First and Second Place go to organizations
based in NY. I
love NY!

I'm not exactly clear *why* it matters if you just do $_SESSION =
$_POST? (Perhaps I overlooked something in the thread?) 

Assuming that the data has been "cleaned" before you dump post into
session, and assuming that when you pull the data out you don't blindly
grab all the post vars but handle them by name, e.g., $_POST['myname'],
etc., and even if someone put some bogus additional post var in there
you wouldn't be handling it (since you are handling the post vars by
name), so, what's the source of the potential harm?

Well, one potentially bad thing is that your session becomes only what was in
$_POST. So, if you had other important data in there, you would overwrite it.
Of course, I doubt I'm saying anything that isn't obvious here.

The other risk is more ... vague. If your software architecture is such that a
developer can screw up and create a security vulnerability, it is a good idea
to see if it is possible to design your application such that this is not the
case. Of course, this is not always possible, and depending on how badly the
developer screws up, there may be nothing in the design that can help.

In general, naming conventions are very important. Developers need to see
$_POST and immediately be suspicious about the data. If they begin to get used
to data in $_POST being filtered, then they might mistakenly use tainted data
(thinking it was filtered).

In addition, consider something like this:

1. Validate $_POST['foo']
2. Validate $_POST['bar']
3. $_SESSION = $_POST
4. $_SESSION['blah'] is used somewhere important

So, there are two problems here. One problem is that step 3 should send red
flags to an alert developer. If this sort of assignment is allowed, you're
deteriorating this natural security-conscious instinct that you want to foster.

The second problem is, of course, that $_SESSION['blah'] is tainted data. Yes,
it is tainted because of a failure on the part of the developer, but imagine
this instead:

1. Validate $_POST['foo'] and store it in $clean['foo']
2. Validate $_POST['bar'] and store it in $clean['bar']
3. $_SESSION = $clean
4. $_SESSION['blah'] is used somewhere important

The developer makes the same mistake here by failing to filter $_POST['blah'].
However, now the only harm is that there is no $_SESSION['blah'] - better than
it being tainted! Also, depending on your error reporting (which you should set
high), you will be alerted to this error. This is much safer.

Also, your developers don't have to tolerate seeing $_POST being trusted. They
can continue to always be suspicious of client data.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Well argued. The bottom line, if I've correctly understood your
arguments, is that it is not necessarily wrong to do it the way I
proposed (functionally speaking). However, it is "bad practice" in
general and a type of practice that should not be encouraged. Further,
it can introduce, for lack of a better term, "sloppy thinking" in terms
of application architecture and can create a sense of "security" (laxity
may perhaps be a better word) among developers - vis-?-vis client data -
when developers should *always* be wary of client data. And, of course,
it plays havoc with any other session data that may exist.

As an added note to forgetting session_register().  This caution is
listed at http://www.php.net/session_register :

"If you are using $_SESSION (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS), do not use
session_register(), session_is_registered(), and session_unregister()."

I don't know the specific reason for sure.  But I seem to recall having
unexpected results from mixing the two 'methods' on projects in the past
(legacy code that existed prior to $_SESSION in PHP).

The issues I ran across may be attributed to PHP bugs at the version
level I was using at the time.  But in case its still on going just
passing along a word of caution.

There's been a couple who have expressed interest in writing these types of guidelines up, which I think is very important.  If others are either interested or experienced in such guidelines, please contact me and we'll get somethings down on paper, and finally up on the site.

I also setup a forum at http://forum.nyphp.org.  It's barebones right now, and needs to be tweaked for nyphp's look and functionality.  If you have experience managing a forum like this, please contact me and we can work together on getting this resource out to the community.

I honestly have found nothing on www.mysql.com or anywhere else that can address this problem.  All I simply want to do is to delete rows from a table where nnet_produkt_record_entered is more than 24 hours old.  I thought this would do it but it produces a mysql_error near 'HOURS)':

   $sql = 'DELETE FROM nnet_produkt_bestilling ' .

Any ideas, sorry I'm fresh out as usual.

Close, but your syntax is a little off.  Maybe something like:

DELETE FROM nnet_produkt_bestilling
      WHERE nnet_produkt_placement < NOW() - INTERVAL 1 DAY

Although in your text above, you mention nnet_produkt_record_entered so you may want to check that you're using the correct columns.

Message-ID: <05c801c38b7f$c9794020$67a76244@philofsoa>

I am looking at www.authorize.net as the credit-card 3rd party solution for the freelance project I'm doing; they seem very PHP-friendly.  However, on the site it does not list account pricing information or how much they "take off the top".  

Anyone have a better or another solution or do you also recommend Authorize.net?

Thanx

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Site dies when class calls this method: no DIE
	statement. HELP
Message-ID: <068f01c38bb3$5e54f9e0$67a76244@philofsoa>


   function setTableStr($tableRefName) { // VOID "METHOD" SEE NOTE BELOW
    /*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This function will set the class property $this->tableStr to the appropriate
      table name depending upon the scope of that which is calling it
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
    $this->tableStr = 'nnet_table_';
    $this->tableStr .= (strcmp(strtolower($tableRefName), 'head') == 0) ? 'head' : 'line';
   }

The moment this method in the Betaling class is called by another method in the Betaling class, insert_table_line(), everything just dies.  No error statement, no HTML display, no nothing, just a complete nothingness!!

This method is important to determine which table I will be doing insertion, and it's all the code I can provide that might make sense, I'm sorry.  If you need more I am not even sure what I can provide for you.  But honestly, I can't explain it better than the class method just.. dies.

 if you have a Bestilling class with method display_cart(), and you have a Betaling class that extends Bestilling, how do you call display_cart from a Betaling class instance?

I'm trying to retrieve the max(ID) from a column that cannot be auto_incremented (since mySQL version on this remote site only allows for tables to have ONE auto_increment field - how stupid), the basic premise is this:

I either return
1) the max ID
2) '1'

How have you guys done it, or what have I missed?

Well I would go into php.net, phpbuilder, zend, nyphp.org and pcom.net but
in the course of frustration, a long walk, prayer and a call from a cool
friend of mine..

I fixed it.

Message-ID: <000401c38c0c$bc3baeb0$6501a8c0@EZDSDELL>

Wondering how to handle the following problem. 

I installed Apache 2.0 using RH 9 (it comes bundled with PHP 4.2.2).
After setting up virtual hosts using that beautifully written article I
found at http://phundamentals.nyphp.org, I then tested some of my code
which redirects a user to an HTTPS connection. I keep getting an Err
404. Thinking it might be the code I created two simple test pages: the
first page has a link to the second page. Here's the link: <a
href="https://unap/test2.php">click me</a>. Now, "unap" is a virtual
host on the server and all other links work correctly on the server but
not this one. *However*, if I change the link to a fixed IP address,
i.e.,  <a href="https://192.168.1.112/unap/test2.php">click me</a>...it
works fine. It seems, then, there is an Apache configuration that I'm
missing. Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.

It looks like a configuration issue with ssl/apache.  Basically, an SSL server can be seperate from a non-SSL server.  It's generaly just another virtual host (based on port), with it's own document root, permissions, directives, etc.

I'm not sure of the default httpd.conf that RH 9 uses, but I have a feeling this is the case.  You have to make sure that either:

1) the two vhosts overlap, considering that name based and "SSL based" vhosts can be independant, or
2) that you're not letting Apache fallback to a default vhost (ie, the main server).  Also keep in mind the ordering of vhost directives, and the document roots of each - if a request doesn't match a named host, AND the fact that it's either SSL or not, the request will fall back to the main server.

Hope that doesn't confuse too much :)

hey,

im actually working on something called "smartboard" which is an integration
of AIML for FAQs (AIML is just a regex-like XML pattern matcher used in AI
chatbots) and phpBB, ive already coded SOAP/RPC functionality into the AIML
side + it will mainly be for the nycwireless stuff (hardware/software/device
faqs) ... im mainly looking to parse examples from the php.net manual ...
for example:

http://us3.php.net/mysql_connect
<?php
    $link = mysql_connect("localhost", "mysql_user", "mysql_password")
        or die("Could not connect: " . mysql_error());
    print ("Connected successfully");
    mysql_close($link);
?>
does anyone know if there is a methodical way to grab it from the site
(either XML based or text based) so
that it could be integrated?  or do you think i should do this w/ offline
docs?
i will donate the work if i can get it going.
- jon

Jeff,

The NameVirtualHost directive can be either an ip address or
a domain name

Which one is yours?

So now you're saying "would."  Your last email said "assuming that I have"
as to imply that you actually "did."  Which is it?  If you actually "did,"
what are the URI's you actually looked at?  You can look in your web
browser's history (in IE: it's the icon in the tool bar that looks like a
sun dial).

Most people on this list learn well from experience, and experience has shown
that you do not give anything "careful investigation" prior to asking the list.
Your questions would be better received and easier to answer if you would put
forth some effort of your own (before or after you ask, in fact; we're
forgiving).

In the future, perhaps you should add this URL to your list of things to
reference prior to asking a question:

http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

Hope that helps.

I've been shown that URL before and have read it and read it, which only
goes to show I must either have a learning disability or a different method
of understanding computing than everyone else here.

Trust me, I read stuff, online and off.  If I've gone to answering
questions that means I have exhausted EVERY SINGLE OPTION I am aware of.  I
just can't intuitively know things like you guys, I'm not that intelligent,
as you have most likely ascertained for yourselves.

So sorry, but you can show me the URL a million times; I will probably
STILL get it wrong because I just can't know exactly what to see online or
in manuals that will give me the clear answer every single time.

I had tried adding in a virtual host with a specific port, namely, 443,
but then realized there's more going on here that I realized and the
docs aren't as clear as one might hope.

By your lack of response, I'll take this discussion to mean "would," thus
you didn't actually read the PHP manual on line.

By the way, the manual has code examples that you can cut and paste, then 
examine and play with to determine how things work.

Enjoy,

By your lack of response, I'll take this discussion to mean "would," thus
you didn't actually read the PHP manual on line.

By the way, the manual has code examples that you can cut and paste, then 
examine and play with to determine how things work.

Phil,
You are correct you don't have to prove anything to anyone.
However if you are requesting help, then you should plan on making the
request in a way that people are likely to provide help and not grief.  If
the request even hints that you haven't done "sufficient" research first,
then you're likely to get grief.  If you spend a couple minutes in the first
email explaining what you have done and what you have tried, then it's
likely that you'll get your question answered.  Think about the time you've
spent on this thread.  If you had provided a "better" request, then you
would have saved that time.

Words in quotes are to be considered very subjective.

Chris

STEPS I FOLLOWED IN PURSUIT OF ORIGINAL PROBLEM 10/6/2003 @ 1:30AM EST
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.classobj.php 

Highlight:



Example 2. test_script.php

<pre>
<?php

include "classes.inc";

// utility functions

function print_vars($obj) {
    $arr = get_object_vars($obj);
    while (list($prop, $val) = each($arr))
        echo "\t$prop = $val\n";
}

function print_methods($obj) {
    $arr = get_class_methods(get_class($obj));
    foreach ($arr as $method)
        echo "\tfunction $method()\n";
}

function class_parentage($obj, $class) {
    global $$obj;
    if (is_subclass_of($$obj, $class)) {
        echo "Object $obj belon

gs to class ".get_class($$obj);
        echo " a subclass of $class\n";
    } else {
        echo "Object $obj does not belong to a subclass of $class\n";
    }
}

// instantiate 2 objects

$veggie = new Vegetable(true,"blue");
$leafy = new Spinach();

// print out information about objects
echo "veggie: CLASS ".get_class($veggie)."\n";
echo "leafy: CLASS ".get_class($leafy);
echo ", PARENT ".get_parent_class($leafy)."\n";

// show veggie properties
echo "\nveggie: Properties\n";
print_vars($veggie);

// and leafy methods
echo "\nleafy: Methods\n";
print_methods($leafy);

echo "\nParentage:\n";
class_parentage("leafy", "Spinach");
class_parentage("leafy", "Vegetable");
?>
</pre>

One important thing to note in the example above is that the object $leafy
is an instance of the class Spinach which is a subclass of Vegetable,
therefore the last part of the script above will output:

[...]
Parentage:
Object leafy does not belong to a subclass of Spinach
Object leafy belongs to class spinach a subclass of Vegetable


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(incidentally, I DID just that in my subclass to reference the superclass'
method: $cartQuery = $this->display_cart();
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://www.phpbuilder.com/manual/keyword.extends.php

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://www.zend.com/zend/zengine/zengine-issue10.php (based upon a
comp.lang.php newsgroup article I thought would maybe clarify the SYNTAX of
calling a superclass method from a subclass using the Namespace operator -
was wrong there!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=class+extends&btnG
=Google+Search&meta=group%3Dcomp.lang.php

Couldn't find anything there other than the typical denotation
$this->super_class_method() 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

http://www.pcoms.net/

That was suggested by Dan Horning.  I found nothing there that pertained to
my problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There you have it.  As you can see I followed the steps to the letter in
searching out the problem on my own, which was to no avail at the time,
hence, my decision to brainlessly post on nyphp.org my apparently inane
questions about classes and calling the superclass method from the subclass.

I hope that offers proof of my ability to follow instruction.

Phil

Okay.  Here's part of the problem.  You're looking at PHP's functions that
manipulate classes.  You need to be looking at the "language reference"
section that explains how to write your own objects and utilize them.

Manual:
   http://us2.php.net/manual/en/index.php

Section II:  Language Reference
   Subsection 13:  Classes and Objects
     http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.oop.php

Read the text there then copy the example.

Then, since you're interested in extensions of classes, click the link on 
the top of the chapter named "extends."

Read that information.  Copy the examples into the same file as the other 
example.  In there is this line, that answers your question of how to 
access a method from the original class:

   $ncart->add_item("10", 1);  // (inherited functionality from cart)

That's how you call ANYTHING from any part of the class when you're in PHP 
code that's not part of a class.

Execute the example to see what it does.

Which is how you call a method of the the class (be it a parent, child or
itself) from _inside_ any method of the class regardless of whether you're
in the parent, child or present class.

If you posted these URI's up front, we could have told you up front that 
you were looking in the wrong places and point you to the right place.

Quick question:  I noticed on some posts to my original question the 
syntax for accessing an array element of $_POST or $_SESSION uses 
single quotes around the array element.  In the reference book I am 
using there are no quotes, just something like $_SESSION[first_name].  
I googled a number of discussions and articles and have found examples 
of both methods.

So, my question is, does it matter if one uses the single quotes or no 
quotes as both seem to work?  Are there any security issues or other 
nuances I should be aware of or is the language just forgiving in this 
respect and I could choose either way?

TIA,

I think I know this one.

Saying array[foo] without quotes is something you can (usually) get away
with but it's deprecated. Bad habit. If you have error reporting set to
report 'notices', PHP will give you a warning about it.

Notice: PHPDocument1 line 5 - Use of undefined constant foo - assumed
'foo'

btw, if you want to embed $array["foo"] within a doble-quoted string, you
can do it protecting it with {}.

echo "Value of \$array["foo"] is now {$array["foo"]}, isn't that
fascinating.";

It matters; unfortunately PHP lets people be too sloppy in this respect.

Doing:

$anarray[elementname];

assumes elementname as a constant first; since it's not a constant first, it takes it literally as a string.  This is *very* bad (performance/security/style) and any book that gives examples like this should have it's worth reconsidered.

You should always do:  $anarray['elementname'];  unless you need to get fancy, as in the following examples:

define('ELEMENTNUM', 5);
$anarray[ELEMENTNUM];         // This is totally different from the very first example.


$elementname = 'somethingelse';
$anarray[$elementname];       // This is the same as writing  $anarray['somethingelse'];


$elementname = 'elementnum';
$anarray["{$elementname}5"];   // This could also be written  $anarray[$elementname.'5'];


So yeah, don't ever do $_SESSION[first_name];  PHP is loosely typed and forgiving - but don't take advantage of it too much, as it'll come around and burn you some time :)

Hans beat me to it.

Specifically, your syntax declares elementname to be a constant, such as
ELEMENTNUM is in Hans's example:

> define('ELEMENTNUM', 5);

PHP can tolerate your error and continue. But, this is no better practice than
writing broken HTML tables that IE happens to render; it doesn't make them
right. :-)

Also, use single quotes, unless you need the information therein to be
evaluated, in which case you'd need double quotes.

Ah, good point.

BTW in the don't-trust-everything-you-read department: Hans just said any
book that says to say $array[elementname] should be reconsidered. Just
such a book is where I picked up the nasty habit back in the day.
Likewise, register_globals. I seem to recall in ancient times (4 years
ago?) reading PHP tutorials online that said, in substance, PHP is just
great because if you have a form element named "foo", then when the form
is submitted you automatically get its value available to you in $foo,
isn't that the coolest?

Thanks for all of the responses.  I'm very happy I asked as I 
definitely DON'T want to develop bad habits that could potentially come 
back to torment me later!

BTW, the book that I am using which gives the no quote examples is 
"Advanced PHP for the World Wide Web" by Larry Ullman, part of the 
Visual Quickpro series by Peachpit Press.  Perhaps this was acceptable 
back when it was written (copyright 2002), as it is also using 
$HTTP_POST_VARS instead of $_POST?  Hmm, the cover does say that it 
covers PHP versions 3 and 4...

Yes, that was the coolest. :-)

It all has to do with perspective. If you go back five years ago or more, most
people using PHP also have experience working with CGIs written in C or
something like that. These people know *exactly* where and how they are getting
data from the client. In fact, they know all too well and are wanting to get
rid of some of the hassle. PHP takes away the hassle, freeing developers to
focus on the business logic. This is very nice, but it is only nice because the
developers are already experienced. They understand what PHP is doing for them.

Now we have people who learn Web development with PHP. They have no previous
experience. This is where the "problem" originates. PHP makes things so easy
that it abstracts many of the details from you. The result is that developers
have no idea where data is coming from or how. What makes this worse is that
these developers often don't care. Security vulnerabilities spread like the
plague...

So, the PHP development team decides to make register_globals disabled by
default. This won't solve these security vulnerabilities, but it does force
developers to understand where data comes from and can save them from a few
common errors. Now the problem is that php-general gets several questions a
week that boil down to the same thing - register_globals is disabled, and the
developer asking the question doesn't understand why $foo is empty.
Unfortunately, a lot of people get tired of answering this same question (or
begging the one asking the question to search the archives, where the question
has been answered in great detail) and instruct the developer to enable
register_globals. Of course, the types of people asking this question are
exactly the ones who need to leave register_globals disabled and crank up their
error reporting to the highest level. Security vulnerabilities continue to
spread like the plague...

That's a very abbreviated history from my perspective. Hopefully the next
chapter will be better. :-)

I should also mention that I develop with register_globals disabled, and I do
not mean to suggest that experienced developers are immune from errors. I only
mean to point out that the major problem with register_globals is a result of a
new generation (Internet time moves quickly, you know) of developers who begin
with PHP.

I am having to set up an HTML form page dynamically created by elements in
a "glued" array, the same way I've done it in TCL before, except that I'd
use a list instead of an array, but anyway..

Everything works until you get to the part where I am setting variables in
the list() function if it flags to 'radio'; there every single variable is
set to the wrong value!  I have looked over my code now for a good hour and
I can't find what I did wrong, so I am going to have to get a second pair
of eyes to look at it and tell me what I missed.

Thanx

Larry Ullman has done a much better job with coding in his new book "PHP

Jeff,

I was playing around with my apache (2.043) server on
windows -- Starting it with different command switches
Apache -t -D DUMP_VHOSTS   showed me my virtual hosts 

Have you tried setting your LogLevel to info or debug 
To get more info in the error log?

Just some thoughts..

I had tried adding in a virtual host with a specific port,
namely, 443,
but then realized there's more going on here that I realized
and the
docs aren't as clear as one might hope.

It looks like a configuration issue with ssl/apache.
Basically, an SSL
server can be seperate from a non-SSL server.  It's generaly
just
another virtual host (based on port), with it's own document
root,
permissions, directives, etc.

I'm not sure of the default httpd.conf that RH 9 uses, but I
have a
feeling this is the case.  You have to make sure that
either:

1) the two vhosts overlap, considering that name based and
"SSL based"
vhosts can be independant, or
2) that you're not letting Apache fallback to a default
vhost (ie, the
main server).  Also keep in mind the ordering of vhost
directives, and
the document roots of each - if a request doesn't match a
named host,
AND the fact that it's either SSL or not, the request will
fall back to
the main server.

Hope that doesn't confuse too much :)

Hans

jeff,
"name based virtual hosts dont work with ssl because of the nature of the
ssl protocol"  as quoted from  http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/vhosts/

therefore, you could get this working much 'easier' with ip-based virtual
hosts.
each virtual host will require its own ip address.

however in efforts to give you a heads up, you should take a look at your
ssl.conf file; i believe you'll need to add your virtual hosts in that file
to actually get ssl working.  the default server is all that is defined
initially.

using https and ssl requires certificates....you'll probably want to set up
a separate certificate for each virtual host.

good luck with this one.

mysql.users

Unfortunately, either due to an oversight on my part or due to not addressing this I have not found any solution to this (also posted to experts-exchange.com, to no avail).

I want to select the max(revenue) from bonus where revenue < 8411.  Here is the query I tried:

select revenue, bonus
from bonuses
where revenue < 8411
having max(revenue) < 8411

This produces no results, so, not understanding honestly (even after reading mysql.com ' s tutorials on WHERE vs HAVING), I used my "hammer-peg-into-hole" comprehension process and kept at it:

select revenue, bonuses
from bonuses
having max(revenue) < 8411

This produces too many results when I only need one.  I need to come up with a clean DB solution to this and I at this point just don't know what I would need to do to do it, sorry, I hope this is the best possible approach to the problem.

My last hurdle toward getting the shopping cart completed - I could have it all done tonight!

try this:

select revenue, bonuses from bonuses 
group by some_field 
having max(revenue)< 8411

ps: some_field should be replaced by the proper field that you choose to use.

hope it helps.

You use WHERE when you want to place restrictions upon your query
based on upon information already in the table. You use HAVING when
you need to restrict based upon the results of an aggregate function
(like count() and average()) and a GROUP BY clause.

While max() is an aggregate function, you don't really want to use
HAVING here; in fact, it doesn't make any sense at all.  That's
SQL-specific, not MySQL.

A good example of when to use HAVING is something like this: You have
a table containing order, item, and price. (You can have multiple
items in an order.)

To find all the items for a specific order:

SELECT * FROM sales WHERE order = $order;

To find the total sales for each order:

SELECT SUM(price) AS total FROM sales GROUP BY order;

To find only the orders with total sales of $50 or more:

SELECT SUM(price) AS total FROM sales GROUP BY order HAVING total >= 50;

You can't do a WHERE here, since total is not a column in any
particular row. And you don't want to only have items with price >=
50, since 2 $25 items in one order still give you a $50 total.

If you haven't setup those hostnames in your hosts file... They aren't

jeff,
"name based virtual hosts dont work with ssl because of the nature of
the
ssl protocol"  as quoted from  http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/vhosts/

therefore, you could get this working much 'easier' with ip-based
virtual
hosts.
each virtual host will require its own ip address.

however in efforts to give you a heads up, you should take a look at
your
ssl.conf file; i believe you'll need to add your virtual hosts in that
file
to actually get ssl working.  the default server is all that is defined
initially.

using https and ssl requires certificates....you'll probably want to set
up
a separate certificate for each virtual host.

good luck with this one.

Thanks so much for tracking this down. Is it my imagination but the
"details" on how it is done is not there? If you've got the details,
pass 'em along! I'm sure there are others that would be interested in
this.

It is impossible to have more than one SSL enabled site on a single IP
without using an external device to hold multiple IP's and forward to a
single IP but on different ports.

What I am trying to say is that these cannot be hosted on a single IP
(but one could be):
https://www.example1.com
https://www.example2.com
https://www.example3.com

You can have multiple virtual hosts that use http and a single https
virtual host all on a single IP though.  This is possible:
https://secure.hosting.com
http://www.example1.com
http://www.example2.com
http://www.example3.com

The reason (unless something major has changed in the TCP/IP world) is
that SSL happens at a lower level in the TCP/IP protocol stack than the
browser sending over what site it is looking for.

If someone can prove me wrong please provide details I would LOVE for it
to be possible and it has been over a year since I have needed to
implement something like this.

I don't think he's trying to have multiple ssl virtual hosts
-- I think he just wants the the one he was to work "name
based".

I feel a little guilty about sending the message about that
link because, like you, I don't think it's possible. And I
would not want to send anyone on a wild goose chase.

Just to clarify...it was a single SSL virtual host. And the Apache docs
*do* say it ain't do-able. So...I'm looking into IP aliasing as the
"solution" and then change httpd.conf to do IP-based virtual hosts.

I haven't been following this thread, but I did notice a comment buried in the
middle of it all about having SSL-enabled hosts using name-based virtual
hosting. This isn't possible, because of a chicken and egg problem. You can
read more about this here:

How does the Web server know which certificate to use?

Hope that helps.

Message-ID: <CMEFIEOFAGGBOFFKCPKNCEHPCAAA.nyphp@websapp.com>

Hi PHPers,

Sorry for the large file post and please forgive my ignorance in graphics
and fonts!

The attached files show graphs generated using JGraph
(http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/index.php) version 1.12.1. The fonts in the
good.jpg are what else but good, and visa versa for the bad.jpg. The .html
files are phpinfo's for each server. The good fonts are being generated
using PHP 4.0.6 and bad fonts are on a server running PHP 4.1.2. Both
servers have GD 1.8.3.

Any pointers in how to get the  PHP 4.1.2 to generate fonts as in the 4.0.6
installation would be appriciated.

Thanks,
Daniel

looks like it's a 4.1.2 problem.  You might try what is suggested here, as
it looks like you're actually using 2 different fonts (compare the 'M's in
Message):

http://www.wellho.net/forum/8415150301.html

Or, I'd just try dropping the font size 2 pts, as it doesn't truly look
solvable:

But then again, all I did was Google it  ;)

Hope that helps.

Message-ID: <265000-220031049213055304@M2W048.mail2web.com>

I have this line in my code:

eval('$field->' . $val . '(' . $max . ',' . $errDisplayArray[$key] . ');');

where $field is a predefined class instance, $val is a string containing
the name of an existing method within the class, and $errDisplayArray[$key]
will be an array element containing text that goes appropriately into the
class method whose name is in $val.

Whenever I run this I get a parse error, however, upon using a die()
statement instead of eval it configures as so (and works!):

$field->setMaxLength(40,"The last name cannot be more than 40 characters");

when I insert this line verbatim into my code I receive no breakage of any
kind upon that line.  I have read the eval() statement all over php.net,
phpbuilder, phpfreaks and zend and I can't see what I'm doing wrong.  Could
someone clarify it for me?

Thanx

Oddly enough I just did a Oracle 8i install on RH9, and at a hospital of sorts.  I've done easier things, but it was rewarding to see Oracle startup, and then drain all my RAM :)

Wow.... $func( var1, var2, etc )
Didn't know that was valid without some fancy evals.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] pcntl_* functions.
Message-ID: <3F86DE00.7060601@idsociety.com>

I'm using the pcntl_fork function to split up a workload between a bunch 
of processes.
I've managed to separate the master from the children, but I am having 
some trouble with
the pcntl_waitpid function.  I was wondering if anyone has any 
documentation or examples
of it's usage. I looked at 
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-waitpid.php but it
still isn't really clear to me.

Here is a quick script I made up:
---
<?php /* -*- C++ -*- */

$max_children = 3;
$is_daemon    = true;
$forks        = 0;

if ($is_daemon) {
  echo 'Master Starting Up. [' . date(' Y-m-d H:i:s ') . '] ( ' . 
mktime() . " ) \n";

  for ($forks = 1; $forks <= $max_children; $forks++) {

    $new_pid = pcntl_fork();

    if ($new_pid == -1) {
      die('Could not fork.');
    }
    else if ($new_pid != 0) {
      echo "[ MASTER ] Starting thread with pid $new_pid ... \n";
      $thread_list[$forks] = $new_pid;
    }
    else {
      echo "[ CHILD  ]  Fork Initializing....!\n";
      $is_daemon = false;
      $i_am = $forks;
      break;
    }
  }
}

if ($is_daemon == true) {
  $i_am = 0;
}
else {
  $seconds = (int)($i_am * 20);
  echo "[ CHILD  ] Sleeping for $seconds!\n";
  sleep($seconds);
  echo "[ CHILD  ] Done Sleeping!\n";
  exit(1);
}

if ($is_daemon == true) {
  $waitpid_status = null;
  echo "[ MASTER ] Waiting For Children to Die!\n";
  pcntl_waitpid (-1, &$waitpid_status, WUNTRACED);
  echo "[ MASTER ] My Children are dead!\n";
}

?>
---

The result is :
Master Starting Up. [ 2003-10-10 12:24:17 ] ( 1065803057 )
[ CHILD  ]  Fork Initializing....!
[ CHILD  ] Sleeping for 20!
[ MASTER ] Starting thread with pid 28773 ...
[ MASTER ] Starting thread with pid 28774 ...
[ CHILD  ]  Fork Initializing....!
[ CHILD  ] Sleeping for 40!
[ MASTER ] Starting thread with pid 28775 ...
[ CHILD  ]  Fork Initializing....!
[ CHILD  ] Sleeping for 60!
[ MASTER ] Waiting For Children to Die!
[ CHILD  ] Done Sleeping!
[ MASTER ] My Children are dead!
[max at computer:/] $ [ CHILD  ] Done Sleeping!
[ CHILD  ] Done Sleeping!


Obviously the master is only waiting for the first child to die out 
before it responds
that they are all done.I have a few options, one of which is keep an 
array of the pid's
of each fork and then loop and wait for each of them.I was just 
wondering if it was
possible to have it wait for any and all forked processes with one 
command. Does
anyone have any experience with this?

Thanks, and sorry for the long mail!

trying to look for a simple time tracking app (for charging clients based on
hourly rates), is there anything in php @ the moment that could create an
invoice for you?  i had envisioned an app a long time ago that could link
your IM to your paypal account for consulting but it never happened so im
sure there are web-based projects that might do the same thing ...

phil, what are you using?  :-)

(i guess its pen+paper vs. php+mysql)

I read this and imagined a chat bot that listens for InstantMessages 
from you, so you can tell it when you start and stop working on various 
projects. It would generate an invoice with a PayPal link on request.

This would be excellently cool, but I don't think that's what you mean. :-)

I know we have people on the list that have written IRC bots in PHP (or 
at least thought about it)... has anyone written an IM bot in PHP? It's 
theoretically possible using a command line IM client...

well ...

technically speaking it can be easily conceived using a number of different
methods (for example using ngrep or snort), you can do analysis on your
networking to just track certain protocols + then analyze w/ PHP to do
tracking results ... im doing this now w/ a PHP app called AirRecon to track
wireless packets/traffic, so it can be reapplied to monitoring instant
messaging, not to mention there is also phpcap which might be used to do the
#entire# logging w/ php.

you would just need to create an invoice manager class or something.

There really isn't any other way to do it than to keep track of all your
child PIDs and test for them all to return.  pcntl_waitpid(-1, $foo), as you
say, returns once any child exits.

waitpid() itself takes a single process id, and so only lets the parent be aware of a single child process at a time, as you've pointed out.  Probably the correct way to handle this is using signals, since the parent gets a SIGCHLD (IIRC) when a child exits.  This might possibly help:

My error handler emails me when there is an error and this morning I
received a message that said "Session object destruction failed." Since
I've never received this message before (the site has been live for a
number of months) I'm not panicking over it. However, just wondering if
there is anything that I should look for in terms of the environment
that might cause this error. The site is running PHP ver. 4.1.2 and is
on a dedicated box.

At this point I know I'm making a relatively easy task difficult.

How would you go about converting an HTML table to tab-delimited text. 
assuming same number of columns for each row and that there will be 
attributes within the table tags.

thanks

1) Slurp table into variable
2) split() on <tr>s
3) iterate over each line doing:
3.1) preg_match_all() on /<td[^>]*>(.+)</td>/U or something similar,
making sure to use non-greedy capturing patterns
3.2) join() each capture item using \t as your delimiter
3.3) store the results in an array: $lines[] = join('\t', $matches)
(or something like that)
4) save results to file
4.1) open file
4.2) write each array element as line, placing \n at end
4.3) close file

Depending upon the frequency you do this, you may find this easier in
a text editor that supports regex matching. Or not.

i just recently had to do the same thing, i ended up lazily doing it in sed
as such:

$ grep -o "<td>.*</td>" file.html | sed "s/<\/td><td>/,/g" | sed
"s/<[/]*td>//g" > file.csv

Or is it longer and longer each time someone replies without snipping out

Message-ID: <20031014070120.GB11848@ylayali.net>


Hi,

I'm new enough to PHP that I've always used $_SESSION-style superglobals
with register_globals off & etc, but now I find myself trying to get a
project to run on 4.0.6

At first the docs led me to the conclusion: No problem, I'll just change
all those $_SESSION collections to $HTTP_SESSION_VARS, but the values
I'm setting don't seem to be installing themselves into the session at
all. The PHPSESSID out of $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS stays the same, but
$HTTP_SESSION_VARS seemingly empties out on every page load. 

Any idea if it's some odd server config? The scant remaining docs about
HTTP_SESSION_VARS make me feel like it should work pretty much the same
way $_SESSION does on our 4.2.2 server.. where the code does work. I
can't find anything specific to these deprecated globals.. 

Of course I am calling session_start()

&, no. sadly, upgrading the server doesn't count as a solution, though
I've been advocating it for some time.

Is this a familiar problem? 

Thanks,
Kenneth

the session vars. it's been so long so I don't remember the exact function

Thanks Shawn,

I gave both:

session_register($HTTP_SESSION_VARS);

and, e.g.,

session_register($HTTP_SESSION_VARS['S_user_id']);

a desperate try before writing to the list; neither has any result,
which is one reason I was suspicious of lousy php.ini settings &/or
buggy weirdness in this ancient version of PHP

Thanks for the response though,
Kenneth

I believe he was referring to the fact that there is an ever growing number of security alerts, and thus more security issues in PHP applications.  This is not a good thing; regardless of email size.

I put SQL into my prayers all the time, is this a bad thing? :-)

In an attempt, um, to redeem this message, what *is* an SQL Injection 
Vulnerability? Is the religious use of addslashes() on any request 
variables used in a database query enough to prevent it?

For example:

$email = $_GET['email'];
$safeemail = addslashes($email);
$query = "SELECT * FROM supplicants WHERE email='$safeemail' ";

Is this safe, or is my site at the mercy of a clever SQL injector?

For the most part.

To avoid all potential problems, it's a good idea to check that the data
matches your expected format.  For instance, if it's supposed to be a
small integer, make sure it only contains numbers and is less that five 
characters long.  This example prevents errors from overflowing and trying 
to put in non numeric characters.

Under this regimen, addslashes() is only needed for strings that are
allowed to contain SQL related characters.  So, you wouldn't need
addslashes(), say, for input you validated to either be a "Y" or an "N."

Also, the step of converting $_GET['email'] to $email is superfluous.  
You could save some time and memory by putting $_GET['email'] in the
addslashes()  call.

Why?  Are you stuck on a server with a majorly bug ridden, outdated, 
version of PHP?  OUCH.  Time to change providers.

Far simpler is to do this at the top of the script than to change all 
instances of your variables.:

    $_SESSION = $HTTP_SESSION_VARS;

The rest of your questions were already answered.

I am surprised that you are uncertain about this.
It is clearly documented in the discussion at Security
Focus:
"an SQL Injection vulnerability can present itself due to a
lack of sufficient sanitization performed on user-supplied
data." 

You have to the 'lustrate' the data, preferably with a
self-flagellation routine. (Maybe addlashess intead of
addslashes)

Thou shalt not *not* use mysql_real_escape_string()  :)

Basically, yes.  There are a few flavors of SQL injection that I'm aware of, one more of a problem with MySQL than the other.

1)  The most common and problematic isn't that common in PHP land, as far as I've seen.  It involves generating SQL *on the client* either via Javascript or passing SQL directly through a GET/POST request.  We all know this is crazy, but apparently others do not:  http://www.nextgenss.com/papers/advanced_sql_injection.pdf

2)  Another type is poisoning variables with complete SQL statements.  The current MySQL API will only run one SQL statement at a time, or throw a parse error otherwise, and although I don't agree with this behavior, it does prevent a lot of abuses of this type of thing.

3)  Lastly there is simply passing in chars that aren't supposed to be interpreted literally.  A common example is someone submitting a form, whereby the backend code doesn't escape anything, and so using a '%' in any of the fields will dump the whole database.  Or, even worse, is if this happens in a DELETE FROM statement.  This is bad :)

This is essentially correct, although I'd recommend using mysql_escape_string(); and actually, mysql_real_escape_string() is even better.  These are direct from the MySQL API and will always correctly escape strings The Right Way (ie, depending on locale, if MySQL's syntax/special chars/ change, etc).

Honor thy PHP and MySQL.

I'd go with:

$_SESSION = &$HTTP_SESSION_VARS;

This way if you change something in one of them you won't get two distinct copies of the variable.

I don't think I've seen this explicitly, but it's probably not a major issue; especially if it's not happening on a continuing basis.

The most probably cause is that a session was attempted to be destroyed, but either it was already destroyed somewhere else, garbage-collected just before, or never created for some reason.  Looking at google/bugs.php.net there were a couple bugs about this at one time, but I don't think they remain an issue.

Oh, I quickly saw someone mention session_register().  I now see that was 
you.

Are you sure session propogation is turned on in your php.ini file?  Is it 
set to use cookies and/or URI rewriting?  If it's set to cookies, is your 
browser accepting and sending the cookie?

Also, http://php.net/session_register says:
vvvvvvvvvv
If you are using $_SESSION  (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS), do not use 
session_register(), session_is_registered(), and session_unregister().

... snip ...

You can also create a session variable by simply setting the appropriate 
member of the $_SESSION  or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS (PHP < 4.1.0) array.

<?php
// Use of session_register() is deprecated
$barney = "A big purple dinosaur.";
session_register("barney");

// Use of $_SESSION is preferred, as of PHP 4.1.0
$_SESSION["zim"] = "An invader from another planet.";

// The old way was to use $HTTP_SESSION_VARS
$HTTP_SESSION_VARS["spongebob"] = "He's got square pants.";
?>
^^^^^^^^^^
Are you setting your information correctly using ONE of those methods?

<snip>
I gave both:

session_register($HTTP_SESSION_VARS);

and, e.g.,

session_register($HTTP_SESSION_VARS['S_user_id']);
</snip>

the proper syntax is session_register('variable_name')... from the manual:


The track_vars and register_globals configuration settings influence how the
session variables get stored and restored.

Note: As of PHP 4.0.3, track_vars is always turned on.

If track_vars is enabled and register_globals is disabled, only members of
the global associative array $HTTP_SESSION_VARS can be registered as session
variables. The restored session variables will only be available in the
array $HTTP_SESSION_VARS. Example 1. Registering a variable with track_vars
enabled


<?php
session_register("count");
$HTTP_SESSION_VARS["count"]++;
?>


If register_globals is enabled, then all global variables can be registered
as session variables and the session variables will be restored to
corresponding global variables. Example 2. Registering a variable with
register_globals enabled


<?php
session_register("count");
$count++;
?>


If both track_vars and register_globals are enabled, then the globals
variables and the $HTTP_SESSION_VARS entries will reference the same value.

Tell me the URL, and you'll find out. ;-)

Just kidding.

I'm not the most creative guy out there, which is why I don't bother trying to
outguess what people will try. I can't think of a specific attack that will
bypass your filtering offhand, but that doesn't mean someone else can't. In
fact, I would characterize this code as a security vulnerability (assuming
addslashes is the only data filtering) even though I can't think of a specific
example to exploit it.

What I can do is tell you that it is practically assured that no valid email
address can be used as an SQL injection attack, so if your data filtering
validates the format you are expecting, this is much safer than only using
addslashes.

Hope that helps.

Chris

i once read a paper that covered crazy recon hacking techniques and the one
that involved SQL injection was pretty interesting, I think if I remember it
was more pertaining to Perl but could be applied in anything.  Basically it
was case scenerio where the hacker was actually looking for the exact box
the admin material was being hosted on (the SQL Server/MySQL) and he
discovered that if he placed \<img\> tags inside of an entry that he could
trace back the IP request when the admin viewed results.  (he already had a
working password) ...  from what I know, this is already common in spammers
determining "good" hosts when they embed tagged images.

Actually, this is how I got involved with this. I began to notice
extremely bizarre results on our 4.2.2 development server after I began
using $_SESSION syntax while the existing code was using
session_register. I converted everything over to superglobals & took out
all the session_register, session_unregister & session_is_registered
stuff & the pages began to display properly again. I wasn't 100% sure of
the "or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS" part though, so thanks for clarifying that.

register_globals is on here, so this seems to imply that either syntax
should work. 

though, as Dan pointed out, you shouldn't mix them.

This sounds similar to CSRF, a topic I have found particularly interesting.
Imagine that the URL in an image tag causes the person requesting it to perform
some action:

<img src="http://stocks.example.org/?task=trade&from=MSFT&to=RHAT&qty=1000" />

There is an article in php|a this month (which should come out today) that has
more information about this. You can also read the original "paper" at:

I love PHP and all, but I find these results hard to believe. Perl still seems
quite a bit more popular to me. And Java, which I can't stand, seems more
popular than both PHP and Perl.

I was surprised to not see Java, as well.  My only thought was that it's "Favorite Programming Language," rather than most popular, but then again it'd be vital to see how these are ranked because I think more people "love" C than C++, although C++ or some variant of is more common these days.

I just attended a presentation by Tim O'Reilly where he broke down
computer books sales data by programming language.

I don't remember the exact order, but I believe it went something like
this:

1) Java
2) VB
3) JavaScript
4) PHP? (Maybe C# is 4 and PHP is 5)
...
X) C, C++, C#
...
Y) Perl

PHP books outsell Perl books considerably. The Perl market is in the
toilet compared to a few years ago, while PHP has gone up, up,
up. Non-programming programming langauges, like VB and JS are more
popular than most programmers expect. (Just as how Photoshop is the
best selling computer book subject.)

I remember Nat saying something similar recently. It still doesn't explain
this:

http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/top25.html

I see a couple of Perl books on there, and sometimes there are as many as four.
However, I have only seen a PHP book make their top 25 once, and it was
Rasmus's. Of course, if buyers had any sense, it would be PHP Cookbook. :-)

But, I'm happy to hear that PHP is a growing book market. That means good
things to come for people like us.

This logic assumes computer book sales are divided equally among
titles and publishing houses. That is false.

In *many* topics (all but the biggies, like Java and JS) *one* book
sells the lion's share of all the copies. In Perl, it's Larry's book,
so Programming Perl is really high on the O'Reilly Top 25. In PHP,
it's Luke and Laura's book. So, Programming PHP and PHP Cookbook are
lower down on the O'Reilly book list.

But, I believe Luke and Laura far outsell Larry over all and if you
sum the total number of Perl and PHP books, PHP wins.

-adam

PS: This doesn't account for all those years when Programming Perl was
selling like gang busters and there were no PHP books. This is just
w/r/t recent sales, like 2001 - 2003.

about 16 hrs. later... "oh, i get it!"

it's like when I try and assign stuff in bash like this:
$NEWVAR='value'

aside from the above, I was trying
session_register('S_user_id');
$HTTP_SESSION_VARS['S_user_id'] = $something;

or even
session_register($HTTP_SESSION_VARS['S_user_id'])
etc..

but what finally works is just (back where I started from)
session_register('S_user_id');
$S_user_id = $something

and later accessing it with 
$HTTP_SESSION_VARS['S_user_id']

though, after session_register, I'm not sure what the point of that
would be with regiater_globals on.. unless it's to be didactic about
where your variables are coming from.. which I like to be anyway.

all of which seems to directly contradict the session_register page Dan
quoted to me earlier:

    If you are using $_SESSION  (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS), do not use
    session_register(), session_is_registered(), and
    session_unregister().

    ... snip ...

    You can also create a session variable by simply setting the
    appropriate member of the $_SESSION  or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS (PHP <
    4.1.0) array.

& which *still* implies to me that the above should've worked (as it did
on later versions). Maybe it really is just an obscure 4.0.6 bug, at
least I had a history lesson, I guess.

Regarding that quote of Dan's though, what initially prompted me to take
out all of the register_globals & friends was rendering/garbled header 
problems when I began to mix them with $_SESSION syntax, which you can
see the results of (on PHP 4.2.2/Apache 2/Red Hat 9, but also seen on
the 4.0.6/Apache 1.3/Some Earlier Red Hat machine) here:
http://dev.ylayali.net/~kenneth/images/superglobal_and_register_session.jpg

I guess it remains to be seen if that behavior will come back as a
result of mixing session_register() with $HTTP_SESSION_VARS

Thanks again,
Kenneth

Message-ID: <157240-220031021421325870@M2W043.mail2web.com>

I am having to be tasked with a rather painful task of updating an existing

database field value there has to be a generated array inside the class
plus a function "get method" to return it. 

I do not want to have to constantly type out:

function getStuff() {
  return $this->stuff;
}

for every occurrence of stuff I find that is generated by the database
SELECT call on the fields of as many as 20 different tables!! This is
enormous and I would love a more dynamic, functional method to generate..
methods.

Can someone give me an idea of how this can be done?

Thanx

Subject: [nycphp-talk] How to dynamically generate class methods based on
	dbfield values

Message-ID: <NFBBJNKBNKCIKGKJIFPJCEILGNAA.sklar@sklar.com>

How about something like

class Foo {
  $fields = array('bar' => 1, 'baz' => 1, 'quux' => 1);

  function get($field) {
     if ($this->fields[$field]) { return $this->$field; }
  }
}

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Nonexistent class error called by included script that

Message-ID: <281450-220031031514270367@M2W077.mail2web.com>

Fatal error: Cannot instantiate non-existent class: dropdowngenerator in
../view_internship_applicant.html on line 123

viewinterns.php => requires html.inc which has DropdownGenerator class
viewinterns.php => will instantiate a new showApplicant class
viewinterns.php => will call upon the constructor to include the HTML file
below
viewinterns.php => then will include view_internship_applicant.html (which
is not really HTML but PHP - long story)
view_internship_applicant.html => will instantiate a new DropdownGenerator
class with dynamic parameters depending on where you 
				  are in the "HTML" file

Line 123:

			$htmlDropdown = new DropdownGenerator('birth_month', 'birth_day',
'birth_year', 2);

Everything I research and understand tells me this should work, but I keep
getting the nonexistent class error, and I should not get it, it's totally
right there in the parent script thus included within the scope of the
child script as well and thus should exist.

Where did I go wrong now?

Ever thought of simply including macros.inc inside html.inc?
There's nothing in the php manual that says you can't do that.

Or, if you don't feel that's very koser, on every page that
the class DropdownGenerator class needs function(s) from macros.inc
just do:

include('macros.inc');
include('html.inc');

I'm in the early stages of a project just like that. It's going to be a
Jabber bot written in Python that will  collect timesheet information
from you and store it in a database. Then there will be a companion php
application to let you run reports and such from a web browser. 

If anyone has ideas for features (like this Paypal invoice thing, for
instance), feel free to send them my way. This is a side project of
mine, so it's flexible.

Im just wondering (I don't know Python that well) but is there a reason on
why the bot itself could not be done in PHP as well?  I noticed a few people
do write tools which require both Python + PHP but could never figure out
why ... is it just what u are comfortable with or is there another reason?

I'm more comfortable with PHP, but Python seemed a better option in this
case because I had already done some Jabber-related experimentation
with it. Now that I think about it, there's really no reason why CLI
wouldn't be an option.  It's mostly laziness on my part-- I never got
rolling completely with CLI.

what you want is:

 function myFunction() {

I'm not sure how closely Python supports Jabber, but PHP seems to have a nice run as well:

And using PHP CLI is a snap; heck, it might even overtake Perl/Bash (it did for me :)

Oscommerce is pretty simple plain and easy...
It's really only the bandwidth side of things you'll want to prepare for
But for most sites... It won't ever matter. 

So what's the plan .. Big site .. Little site,
Onsite CC processing .. Offsite?? (this might
be a deciding factors for ya as the package 
you get will have to allow you to add secure
certs. Otherwise .. It's just, will they give
you the space you need, we already know pair 
Is very very very reliable.

This is the kind of conversation you two might want to have with 
everyone that cares, i.e. off list.

You're the list monitor?  I for one, although have not participated in this 
thread, but am also interested since I am working on an OSCommerce site as I 
write this.  Try delete for those items that do not interest you.

It is replies like this that make people hesitant to post questions on 
this list.  I don't think that this qualifies as a "gentle nudge."

Subject: [nycphp-talk] accessing phpmyadmin as different users
Message-ID: <31602098.1066407081853.JavaMail.root@grover.psp.pas.earthlink.net>

I am trying to access phpmyadmin as diferent users by having a login webpage 
that ask for the userid and password and then passing it to index.php. In the 
config.inc.php I change the code to look like this:

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = $_GET['userid'];
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = $_GET['pwd'];

But when I try this I get an error:
========================================================
Error

MySQL said:

Access denied for user: 'ODBC at localhost' (Using password: NO)
========================================================

If I change the code to :
=========================================
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'view';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'view';
=========================================

It works. This is the same userid and pwd I am passing from my login page

Any ideas?

This tool is great but it would much easier if we could set it up to allow for users to login 
and according to their user and pwd they would have access to different DB's and tables 
according to the permissions that were granted to them..

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

So, it sounds like the information you suppliied in $_GET isn't getting 
there.

So, to confirm my theory you can put "view" and "view" into the form you 
created.  Bet you'll get the same error message.

Do you really mean $_POST?

Regardless, you need to alter your code to obtain the user input from the 
right place and naturally.

I need a simple shopping cart solution for a client.  The user will be able
to browse a catalog, add to cart (with quantity) view the cart and then
"submit" the cart.  On submit, an email will be sent the client and they
will fulfill the order and process the payment manually.  This is really
just a glorified cookie tracker.. anybody have a recommendation.

I tried it with $_GET and $_POST and with either of them I am able to print the information in the 
variables.

But it fails

I'd continue with your thought of hardcoding the username and password. 
Hard code everything to verify that you're putting in the right 
variables, etc. Use print statements and error logs to see exactly what 
you're passing.

I'm always stuck on the osCommerce end .. But not applicable here

I'd suggest looking up http://php.resourceindex.com/ for the latest versions of standalone software
And then if all else fails .. OSC :-)

Before I get too far, I thought phpMyAdmin has it's own login page.  Why 
are you making another?

Anyway, you need to learn how to do some debugging, step by step.

You said you made a login page.  Go to the script that login form gets 
submitted to.  Put in echos for the variables you're submitting.  Did your 
input get through?  If not, there's your problem.  But, if so, go to the 
next step.

Now, you need to pass that information from there to the index.php, right?  
How are you passing it between the pages?  Check in index.php that the 
information you supplied is getting there.  If it's not, why not?  If it 
is, then are you putting it in the right place to be accepted by the 
system?

I hope you now get the idea of how to debug... think through your system,
step by step, create tests that checking things at each step of the
process.

Lets find out something
Are you trying to pass http passwords to it?
If so just change your auth_type to 'http' then you will use the http type login ..

Otherwise .. I have no idea what you're trying to do .. As you could pass the login and PW in a URL or in a form just like the one
on the login page phpMyAdmin uses. I'm not sure if this all helps .. So a plan of usage might allow me to be more direct.

--------------{ EXAMPLE }---------------------------------
On my servers I have a staff area with phpmyadmin located
Inside it. The auth_type is set to 'http' and so therefore
Since to get to the staff area requres a password.. So 
Also does the [phpmyadmin) and each staff has their login
Which I've programmed in using htpasswd
----------------------------------------------------------


$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']     = 'config';    // Authentication method (config, http or cookie based)?
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']          = 'root';      // MySQL user
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']      = '';          // MySQL password (only needed
                                                    // with 'config' auth_type)

Nestor,

If I understand you -- you want to let different users
access mySQL through phpAdmin.

What throws me is when you say it would be nice if different
users could have different access based on their login.

Consider the following:

In the user table you have something like this:

Host      User  Password     Select_priv Insert... Delete...

----      ----  --------     ----------- --------- ---------
localhost  root md5_password       Y        Y        Y   
www.ur.com you  md5_password       y        Y        N

and in the database table you have:

Host         Db    User         Select_priv  Insert_priv 
----         ---   -----        -----------  -----------
www.ur.com   data  you               Y           N

The above would allow 'you' to login to mySQL database from
www.ur.com and select and insert -- but not delete.

Even though 'you' can log in with insert privileges 'you'
won't be able to insert into the 'data' database.

The security system works on a combination of user and host
as detailed in the mySQL manual.

If you look at the 'tables_priv' and the 'columns_priv'
tables in the 'mysql' database you will see that there are
opportunities to get pretty fancy with who's allowed to do
what.

I have to admit I have never used phpadmin except as a root
user with total privileges. But I find it hard to believe
that phpadmin operates outside the regular mySQL security
framework. I doubt if phpadmin circumvents or constricts the
general security features of mySQL.

This means you should be able to put your own 'happy face'
on phpadmin -- and you shouldn't have to post variables to
it from a form.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] accessing phpmyadmin as different
users

I am trying to access phpmyadmin as diferent users by having
a login webpage 
that ask for the userid and password and then passing it to
index.php. In the 
config.inc.php I change the code to look like this:

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = $_GET['userid'];
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = $_GET['pwd'];

But when I try this I get an error:
========================================================
Error

MySQL said:

Access denied for user: 'ODBC at localhost' (Using password:
NO)
========================================================

If I change the code to :
=========================================
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'view';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'view';
=========================================

It works. This is the same userid and pwd I am passing from
my login page

Any ideas?

This tool is great but it would much easier if we could set
it up to allow for users to login 
and according to their user and pwd they would have access
to different DB's and tables 
according to the permissions that were granted to them..

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

I way pass these steps you mentioned.

I can handle the debugging, because it is the same way I do it 
everytime I program in PHP or Perl.

PHPmyAdmin does not have a loging page as of version 2.3.3.  
Basically you add the user and pwd into the config.inc.php file
in a hash array:
-------------
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']             = 'user';      // MySQL user
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']      = 'pwd'; // MySQL password
---------------

BUT WHEN I put in variables in the hash array it fails:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']             = $user;      // MySQL user
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']      = $pwd; // MySQL password

YES, the variable do have the information that I want to pass.

Thanks,
Nestor :-)

Before I get too far, I thought phpMyAdmin has it's own login page.  Why 
are you making another?

Anyway, you need to learn how to do some debugging, step by step.

You said you made a login page.  Go to the script that login form gets 
submitted to.  Put in echos for the variables you're submitting.  Did your 
input get through?  If not, there's your problem.  But, if so, go to the 
next step.

Now, you need to pass that information from there to the index.php, right?  
How are you passing it between the pages?  Check in index.php that the 
information you supplied is getting there.  If it's not, why not?  If it 
is, then are you putting it in the right place to be accepted by the 
system?

I hope you now get the idea of how to debug... think through your system,
step by step, create tests that checking things at each step of the
process.

Hans,


Thanks for your info.  Maybe what I need to do is to installed the latest phpmyadmin, because I am using 2.3.3
and this version does not have a login page, you just go directly into web form that allows you to be view databases and tables according to the values in the has:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']          = 'user';      // MySQL user
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']      = 'pwd'; // MySQL password

Thanks again,

Nestor :-)

Ahh, I blurred out what version you were dealing with :)

Just as an FYI, though, you should take care using older versions, especially with newer versions of MySQL.  I've seen old versions of phpmyadmin do fun things, even with old versions of MySQL.

You're probably having name collisions, or worse, register_global problems.  Try using variable names that aren't so common.

$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']          = $yankees_user;     // MySQL user
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']      = $yankees_pwd;      // MySQL password


Of course those names might cause problems too :)

Tim,

Thanks for the summary on Mysql, I am aware of  how the 'user' and the 'db' table work.

I think I just need to upgrade, but I hate leaving an issue unresolved............@#$^&*
I feel like the thing is beating me and I do not like to give up :-)

Thanks again to all!!!!!!

So, what happens if you go to a command line and try to log in with the 
information you provided in the variables $user and $pwd.   If you
don't get in, you need to issue the "flush privileges" command to the 
MySQL server from the command line interface.

Also, in another email, you mention the fact that you're using an older 
version of the program.  Not good.  There are security vulnerabilities in 
them.  Upgrade now.  You'll solve your problem of trying to hack your own 
login page AND tighten security.

Not to rekindle a thread that has died gracefully, or painfully depending on your viewpoint, but I think it raises some important points.

For those that missed our prior dev meeting, we're going to be working on a mailing list system that will enable people to unsubscribe from particular threads and resubscribe to them at a later point.  It will also have an interactive archive, ie forum, so people will be able to have essentially the same flexibility and functionality of forums and mailing lists, and new features realized by the combination of the two, including an interface of their choice.

Until technology solves all of our problems, however, simply deleting messages is something some of us may take for granted.  We've received feedback from NYPHP-Talk subscribers, both past and present, that the list can have heavy traffic.  While email filtering can alleviate much of this, some email clients, providers or users don't provide/utilize it, and there's still reason for concise, complete and well-formed postings.

Perhaps it was more a shove than a nudge, or perhaps the messages began to get a bit back-and-forth.  Whatever the case, people should not hesitate to ask questions on the list, nor at the same time be afraid to rebut.  And, for those with suggestions on making the lists more useful or to help draft some guidelines, swing over to NYPHP-Dev at http://nyphp.org/lists

Dan,

Yes,  It looks like the only recurse now is to upgrade.  The FLUSH was done a long time ago when the database and the users were created.
The idea came from basically having different users and I wanted to allow them to view the data over the web using thier existing database user and password.

Yes I think I will upgrade after the weekend :-)

Thanks again,


Nestor :-)

It is working, but not via my logging page.

I new it was something simple but   am glad is fix or would have had a bad weekend.

DAn,


WE are in an intranet behind a firewall, but I see what you are saying :-{

In your list I did not see phpmyadmin version 2.3.3 at all.  Is that because is not vulnerable or
because it never became an offcial release?

I used GTK for a bit. First of all, it was pain to configure on Windows.
However, a bit later, I didn't feel the need of using PHP as a desktop
application language and gave it up for .Net. I'm learning C# these days.

Message-ID: <001801c395bf$3dad3700$6401a8c0@main>

Hi all,

I am working on a project that uses Sessions (only) for tracking logged in
users. Everything works in IE and most netscape/mozilla browsers. However,
my client uses AOL, and he is having problems logging in. Some times he can
login, other times he can't. He also reported that he get "kicked off", i.e.
session is gone without explicitly logging out. Any ideas how to track and
fix that problem? 

Also, after trying pretty much everything, I was thinking about utilizing
PEAR_Auth, but I'm not sure how Pear_Auth handles passwords and whether it
will work with my existing system or not. 

Thanks for your help :)

I recommend lots and lots of logging. This situation also demonstrates why I
think a PHP debugger is no substitute for good logging. Sometimes your users
are going to run into problems that you can't reproduce, and this can make
things very challenging.

Use your own session functions, and you can track exactly what data is being
read, stored, etc. With good logging within your application as well, you
should be able to track a specific user's experience as he/she interacts with
your application.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Are you using cookies to pass the session ID?  I strongly suggest using 
URI based session ID's, just for reasons like this.  You can check out my 
Simple Session Solution class:

Are you using IP addresses for session authentication anywhere?  AOL's 
system seems to have users browsing via a proxy which can change IP's 
along the way.

PHPSESSID is passed through the URL, since I'm working between three
subdomains ( xyz.domain.com ) and the main doamin itself. I tried cookies,
but failed terribly LOL.  It is passed as
http://www.domain.com/file.php?PHPSESSID={sid} {sid} = session id.

I'll take a look at your code and see if I can update my code.

The very reason I didn't use IP addresses in any of my authentication
procedures. I just store userid, usergroup and a couple of other things in
$_SESSION.

Message-ID: <006101c395d4$f26693c0$5c096444@philofsoa>

Based on the information I read in www.php.net on the header command I wrote a dummy test script to try to convert the contents of $stuff to MS Word downloadable format:

http://www.php.net/header

Code:


  $stuff = '<html><head><title>stuff</title></head><body><b>Hello</b> World</body></html>';

  header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT");               // Date in the past
  header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT");  // always modified
  header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");   // HTTP/1.1
  header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
  header("Pragma: no-cache");                                     // HTTP/1.0 

  header("Content-type: application/msword; filename=stuff.doc");
  //header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=stuff.doc");
  echo $stuff;


However, upon attempting to run this script I ran into the following error in IE:

Internet Explorer could not open this script: test.php (note: I am trying to change it to be "stuff.doc").  Nothing ever showed up.

test.php (the code you see) is in a Linux environment in a folder protected by .htaccess.  

In NS 7.0 it produces no errors but it tries to save the downloaded file as "test.php" and not "stuff.doc".

I am unsure how to do this in PHP although I can do it in TCL and have done it that way before, that, however, is not an option here.

Please help, I'm stuck at the very beginning of attempting customized simple reporting.

Thanx
Phil

you don't really want to do this because there is no tracking for the
variable $i (in other words if you are including this file it will change
all of user/pass of every login if its included) ...

if on the other hand you are doing it individually you need to match up the
corressponding database w/ the correct user name/pass by the first reference
($i) ..

$cfg['Servers'][2]['user'] = $_GET['userid'], etc

im not sure if you looked closely @ the config file but you can have as many
configurations as you want, in mine i have 8 ... you can add a user/pass to
the form (custom) + do what you are looking to do but need to make sure to
pass a Server variable ...(which is $cfg['Server']).

PHP scales. There, I said it. The word on the street is that "Java scales
and PHP doesn't." The word on the street is wrong, and PHP needs someone to
stand up and tell the truth: that it does scale.

Interesting article. I also found it funny that there are actually more
clueless people posting comments at the bottom than one can find on Slashdot.
Amazing. :-)

It's hard to vote for something like phpMyAdmin in a list like that. There are
some pretty major projects there (Subversion, Zope, etc.). Or, maybe it's just
that I'm more impressed with tools that help people like us solve problems more
easily than I am with our solutions to those problems.

I would just like to thank Dan for providing session-simple source code.
After going over it, I realized quite a few quirks in my session handling
routines. It was either to recode the whole thing or use session_simple. I
opted to drop in the session_simple code with only modification of the
session name, which I had set to "PHPSESSID", as opposed to Dan's
"SessionID". It worked beautifully and didn't break my existing
authentication routines (login/logout/accesslevel checking).

Eek, I'm a little shocked to see some of the canidates.  Nevertheless, phpMyAdmin has gotten my vote.

BTW, I've been meaning to rewrite NoCatAuth in PHP.

Yeah, developing outside of the MFC on Windows is kinda of, well, like using a *NIX based system for a desktop  :)  That said, the only place I've really heard of php-gtk used is on the Linux desktop.

I could have done without as much my-tier, your-tier, pattern and anti-pattern blah blah, but it was nice to see a fairly objective look at PHP from a Java house.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] trouble using ob_start(),
	ob_end_clean() and header() combination
Message-ID: <244640-2200310120134348859@M2W033.mail2web.com>

I traced the problem to what I believe is when I use the included content
library script into the viewinterns.php page.  This script will repeatedly
instantiate a DateGroupHTMLGenerator class because I have to constantly
produce these HTML form element fields with different names throughout my
page.  Here is the code I use to reproduce it everytime:

<?php		
			
			$gradArray = array();
			foreach(array('graduation_month', '', 'graduation_year') as $key =>
$val) 
			 $gradArray = $gradArray + array($val => $$val);
			array_push($gradArray, 2); // ADD TEXT FIELD SIZE
			$dateGroup =& new DateGroupHTMLGenerator($gradArray, 1, 0, 1);
			echo $dateGroup->getMonthDropdown() . $dateGroup->getDayDropdown() .
$dateGroup->getYearText();
?>

This is one of the dategroup HTML content snippets throughout the library. 
There are several of them since the form is rather large and requires an
enormous amount of data including several month/day/year groupings, all
having different names (see the foreach() loop for more clarification on
naming convention, etc.).

At the end of this library script I do the following:

<? $dateGroup = null; ?>

I zero-out the object.  Upon review, however, I am convinced that somehow a
latent object or a latent buffer is still floating around.  Here is the
code to DateGroupHTMLGenerator constructor method:

        // CONSTRUCTOR
	function DateGroupHTMLGenerator($classPropertyArray, $hasMonth = 1,
$hasDay = 1, $hasYear = 1) {
		global $REQUEST_URI;

		foreach(array('month', 'day', 'year') as $key => $val) $this->{'has' .
ucfirst($val)} = ${'has' . ucfirst($val)};
		
		$this->propertyArray = $classPropertyArray;
		
		// CONVERT THE INPUT PARAMETER ARRAY INTO A 2-DIM ENUMERATIVE ARRAY TO
PRESERVE KEYS AND VALS AND HAVE ENUMERATION FOR SWITCH
		$enumKeyValArray = array();
		foreach($this->propertyArray as $key => $val) 
		 array_push($enumKeyValArray, array($key, $val));

		// GET THE VALUE OF THE LAST ELEMENT OF THE INPUT PARAMETER ARRAY WHICH
WILL BE THE TEXT FIELD LENGTH
		$textFieldLengthArray =
array_values(array_reverse($this->propertyArray)); 
		$textFieldLength = $textFieldLengthArray[0];

		$this->htmlArray = array();	
				
		$monthArray = array('01' => 'January',
				    '02' => 'February',
				    '03' => 'March',
				    '04' => 'April',
				    '05' => 'May',
				    '06' => 'June',
				    '07' => 'July',
				    '08' => 'August',
				    '09' => 'September',
				    '10' => 'October',
				    '11' => 'November',
				    '12' => 'December'
				   );


		for ($i = 0; $i < sizeof($enumKeyValArray); $i++) {		
		 $html = '';
	 	 switch ($i) {
		  case '2': // TEXT FIELD SLOT IN INPUT ARRAY PARAMETER
		   	if ($this->hasYear) {
			 if ($textFieldLength == 2) $html = '20';
		    	 $html .= '<input name="' . $enumKeyValArray[$i][0] . '" value="' .
str_replace('"', '&quot;', $enumKeyValArray[$i][1]) . '" size="' .
$textFieldLength . '" maxlength="' . ($textFieldLength + 1) . '">';
	 		}
		  	break;

		  case '3': // SIZE OF TEXT FIELD - NOTHING NEEDS TO BE DONE
			// DO NOTHING
		   	break;
		  
		  case '0': // MONTH DROPDOWN
			if ($this->hasMonth) {
			 $html = '<select name="' . $enumKeyValArray[$i][0] . '">';
	 		 foreach($monthArray as $innerKey => $innerVal) {
			  ob_start();
			   preSelect($enumKeyValArray[$i][1], $innerKey);
			   $preSelectText = ob_get_contents();
			  ob_end_clean();
	 		  $html .= '<option value="' . $innerKey  . '" ' . $preSelectText . '>'
. $innerKey . ' - ' . $innerVal . '</option>';
			 }
			 $html .= '</select>';
			}
		  	break;

		  case '1': // DAY DROPDOWN
			if ($this->hasDay) {
			 $html = '<select name="' . $enumKeyValArray[$i][0] . '">';
			 for ($j = 1; $j <= 31; $j++) {
			  $myDay = ($j < 10) ? '0' . $j : $j;
			  ob_start();
			   preSelect($enumKeyValArray[$i][1], $myDay);
			   $preSelectText = ob_get_contents();
			  ob_end_clean();			  
			  $html .= '<option value="' . $myDay . '" ' . $preSelectText . '>' .
$myDay . '</option>';
			 }
			 $html .= '</select>';
			}
			break;

		  default: // THIS WILL BE EXPANDED FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION OF
DATEGROUP, FOR NOW IF ANYTHING ELSE IS FOUND DO NOTHING
		   	// DO NOTHING
			break;
		 }
		 
		 $this->htmlArray[$i] = $html;
		} 		

	}

I have certain fields surrounded by ob_start() and ob_end_clean() because
the function those commands surround does an 'echo' (required).  So to
prevent it from going to stdout that is why I have ob_start() and
ob_end_clean() around them.  However, when the user submits the form
generated by the library using this class object, it will instantiate a
saveData class object that saves everything (no headers produced mind you)
and then does a redirect header() command.  Whenever anyone does that they
get  this specific warning:

Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already sent by (output
started at /var/www/html/development/phillip/libdev/html.inc:160) in
/var/www/html/development/phillip/admin/viewinterns.php on line 659

Mind you, the saveData class in viewinterns.php does NOT instantiate
anything in html.inc, much less a DateGroupHTMLGenerator class instance,
which is exactly what this warning is pointing to (the line 160 in html.inc
is the end of the entire html.inc, classes and all).

I'm totally stumped.  If I replace "header()" with client-side redirection
it works but is EXTREMELY slow (avg download time 20 - 30 seconds per
page), so it's not an option.  I do not know what to do at this point so I
really need help.

Thanks
Phil

I was interested in seeing how mangled the definition of scalability has
become. I spoke a bit about this on my blog, and I have sparked discussions
about it on php-general and use.perl.

So, we may as well discuss it here also. How do you define scalability? What
does it mean?

http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=95856

I'm going with multidimensional scalability  :)

All joking aside, scalability holds different meanings in different contexts - are we talking hardware, software, or the architecture of how the system as a whole was designed (or lack thereof).

In general, without getting into various flavors and types, scalability is suitability to task and the ability to accommodate future requirements.  Sure, a big piece of this is performance - what happens when your traffic increases by some factor of 10 - but there are other issues to deal with.

What if you need to "scale" functionality; what if you need to change/outsource development; what happens if a particular server/network goes offline?  Each of these are given their own buzzwords, but they all reflect one key fundamental aspect:  the architecture of the system as a whole.  Some languages, or platforms as they've become, have some sugar builtin to address these issues, but they still remain less of a remedy versus good design and planning.

Let's take two kings of "scalability" - Oracle and J2EE.  Why are they generally accepted as being so scalable, outside of the marketing muscle behind them?  Is Oracle lightweight and agile?  Is J2EE and it's core language Java highly tuned for performance?  No.  They divide functionality up and suggest, almost force, you to build on an architecture that provides the ability to be distributed across machines, networks, development groups, etc.

PHP doesn't have this foundation in a predigested form as other languages/platforms attest, but there is certainly no reason it can't be implemented.  And furthermore, implemented with greater success by avoiding mistakes the big guns have made.  Then again, maybe most of it is a mistake.

>> http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/10/15/php_scalability.html

I got a nice laugh, and then was inclined to take the remainder of the article more seriously, after reading this:

"Within the Java community, the standard J2EE topology is anything but clear."

There's no cure all, and no such thing as a free lunch.

Well it definitely has to do with the 'size of the problem'
and maybe 'bang for the buck' also.

It's more than just the number of (concurrent) users -- it's
also the amount of data and the work performed on the data.

A schema for a database might be okay for queries against
8-10 thousand items but have response problems at say 80-100
thousand items.

Ultimately you have to have some measure of throughput and I
guess 'transactions per second' is about the best.

Then you need a 'rate of change' measurement like to go from
200 tps to 500 tps using technology 'A' costs an additional
3 cents per transaction. Technology 'B' will cost you 4 1/2
cents to do the same. But when you 'scale up', the move from
500 to 1000 tps technology 'A' has an incremental cost of 2
1/2 cents whereas technology 'B' has an incremental cost of
only 1 1/2 cents.  So if you make a chart of tps / cost per
transaction at the start technology 'A' is less expensive,
but as time and the number of transactions move on and up,
technology 'B' is cheaper because it 'scales'. 

Anyway the idea that PHP doesn't scale is ridiculous.

pages) per day from a single PII-350..."

yo,

I have a client that won't get a regular merchant account so I suggested
using paypal for handling the purchases on there site. The only problem is
they want a transparent layer when the sales are finalized. Does anyone
know of a service similar to the paypal services but allows for
transparency on the payment layer.

Message-ID: <293580-220031012019833622@M2W089.mail2web.com>

Here is the scope of what I need to do;

want:

enrollment_year
allowed (even if null)
all of ica

criteria:

1) join ica and i
2) ica.intern_id = 821
3) either (q.partner_name = 'ECSU' and joins with permissions according to
your intern_id AND ica.has_ecsu_essay = 'Y') OR
(ica.has_ecsu_essay != 'Y' AND there is NO row in permissions with
partner_id where q.partner_id = 'ECSU' according to 821)

This is what I've done so far and it fails:

SELECT distinct i.enrollment_year,
IF (p.intern_id = i.id AND p.intern_id = '821' AND p.partner_name =
q.partner_name AND upper(q.partner_name) = 'ECSU' AND
upper(ica.has_ecsu_essay) = 'Y'), '1', '0' AS allowed,
ica.*
FROM interns i, intern_complete_application ica, permissions p, partners q
WHERE ica.intern_id = i.id
AND ica.intern_id = '821'
AND upper(ica.has_ref_letter_1) = 'Y'
AND upper(ica.has_ref_letter_2) = 'Y'
AND upper(ica.has_transcript) = 'Y'

I get syntax errors on this query, and every other combination gives me
syntax errors or wrong data. I have been trying for 2 days to get this
query and it's either that or I write this horrifically bloated PHP method
to do the same thing (it works but it takes about 15 seconds to execute the
whole thing):

function isCompletedIntern($internID) { // BOOLEAN "METHOD"
global $dbHost,$dbPort,$dbUser,$dbPwd,$dbName;

$db = new dbConnection($dbHost,$dbPort,$dbUser,$dbPwd,$dbName);
$dbconnection = $db->connect();

Take a look at www.paysystems.com or www.2checkout.com  they are's
completely transparent but are more 'profrssional', if you will.
2checkout.com let's your customize the headers and footers for the payment
pages, which makes it easier to integerate the payment pages into your site.

There are others, like ibill.com, worldpay.com, etc. However, I have not had
any experience with them so can't say much.

Hope that helps.

yo,

I have a client that won't get a regular merchant account so I suggested
using paypal for handling the purchases on there site. The only problem is
they want a transparent layer when the sales are finalized. Does anyone know
of a service similar to the paypal services but allows for transparency on
the payment layer.

Are you sure that's the correct place to put the ()s w/r/t the IF? I
would look that up on mysql.com.

actually I rewrote the query to be a bit more clear..

Ok I finally figured out the query I want to write, here is the Oracle
version of the query:

select i.enrollment_year, (select p.allowed from permissions p, partners q,
intern_complete_application a where p.intern_id = a.intern_id and
p.intern_id = 821 and p.partner_id = q.partner_id and upper(q.partner_name)
= 'ECSU' and upper(a.has_ecsu_essay) = 'Y') as allowed, ica.*
from interns i, intern_complate_application ica
where i.intern_id = ica.intern_id
and i.intern_id = 821;

I hope that clears things up a bit.

In an attempt, um, to redeem this message, what *is* an SQL
Injection 
Vulnerability? Is the religious use of addslashes() on any
request 
variables used in a database query enough to prevent it?

For example:

$email = $_GET['email'];
$safeemail = addslashes($email);
$query = "SELECT * FROM supplicants WHERE email='$safeemail'
";

Is this safe, or is my site at the mercy of a clever SQL
injector?

i would vote for myphpadmin ... basically because i've used it the most.
but i also have used squirrelmail, kde, open office, xmms and mplayer.
with recent withdrawls from cnn streaming video i am sooooooo thankful for
my discovery of xmms & mplayer....(cnn web support told me to use window
media player on my linux box .... uh!?!  no!)

i think at a comdex show the video and music playing booth is definately
going to be the best choice...  and will draw a big crowd of all ages.

so in the last possible moment....... i vote for xmms.

That looks like a handy class, thanks Tim.

I was only half-joking -- more trying to shine a flashlight on the 
issue. SQL injection vulnerabilities seem to be a problem in a lot of 
open source applications, and probably an even bigger problem in the 
scripts that we never see.

My understanding was (with MySql anyway) that you only needed to be 
careful with stray quotes, so that an attacker would have no way to 
rewrite your query. I never really considered the possibility of 
overflows or attack by value of the wrong type, because in my experience 
those conditions were either handled gracefully or generated an error 
and I was lazy.

So we can kill this thread, is it safe to say that three best practices 
here are:

1) always check user input to make sure it's the type and size of data 
that you expect
2) use mysql_real_escape_string() if possible, or addslashes() to escape 
any quotes in the data
3) always encapsulate field values in quotes in your queries

Will the PEAR DB's quote($value) do as well, do ya think?

Also, if you use PEAR's prepare("select * from foo where bla = ?")  and
execute($sth,array('Gack')), you get quoting/escaping automatically,
right?

Yeah, I've read somewhere that it never hurts to quote even numeric field
value types. That's standard rather than MySQL-specific, no?

please dont take offense Jon but we just discussed the setup of virtual host
about 2 weeks ago... we recently had more than 18 posts on how to set up
virtual host including links to apache website
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/vhosts/ and our own
http://phundamental.nyphp.org  (check the nytalk archives around oct 6
through oct 8).

a general question to our fearless leaders of NYPHP, i am wondering how
anyone can be sure to thoroughly search the 'archives' before asking
questions in this nyphp-talk.  the only reason i even know the virtual host
discussion occurred is because i was  involved with the discussion thread...
but i am just as likely to ask a question about a topic that was discussed
in detail in the past or in another nyphp resources.

so i hope you find your answers Jon in the resources above.  i was hoping to
hear from Jeff Siegel about his success story of setting up virtual hosting.
;)

regards,
deedee

I'm not a leader of NYPHP, but I don't think this has been much of a problem
yet for this list. It doesn't have so much traffic that repeated questions are
terribly annoying. In fact, I don't really mind repeated questions much,
especially when there are new answers given. I think this condition is much
worse on lists like php-general, because it is less likely to hear a new answer
to someone asking why $foo isn't defined (when register_globals is disabled).

I've never actually searched our archives, but I know we have some. Maybe
someone should suggest that php|a include our lists in their mailing list
archive search tool.

I thought he was talking specifically about running PHP 4 and PHP 5 at the
same time, which I don't think we talked about. Or did we? (Did I review
the archives? No, sorry. Too busy watching the World Series. (-: )

There is a horizontal menu that has a search button which
will present a search form. You can click the radio button
for lists.nyphp.org to search the mailing lists.

As a test I entered "virtual host setup" in the form.

In the fifth item returned I noticed:

lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2003-May/003682.html

I didn't really poke around but it would seem that Jon Baer
was already participating in that thread about virtual
hosting (or one very nearly like it).

It would probably be a good idea to have that navigation
menu available while reading the mailing list archives...
It is awkward to have to travel back through a browser
history to make another search...

Note -- I am answering this just to be of assistance.
I am not a leader at NYPHP (or anywhere else for that
matter) and as for being fearless -- I am just guilty of
rushing into discussions where I shouldn't tread.

Did I miss a "virtual hosting" question? ;)

You *can* Google the NYPHP site...http://www.nyphp.org/google.php to see
if a particular issue has been discussed.

And as for my success story, well, virtual hosting works fine for me.
Keep in mind, though, different situations may not be covered in that
article, e.g., if you need SSL, since the hosting as described there is
name-based...not IP based.

P.S. I'm not a "leader" but just fairly involved with the group.

please dont take offense Jon but we just discussed the setup of virtual

about 2 weeks ago... we recently had more than 18 posts on how to set up
virtual host including links to apache website
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/vhosts/ and our own
http://phundamental.nyphp.org  (check the nytalk archives around oct 6

a general question to our fearless leaders of NYPHP, i am wondering how
anyone can be sure to thoroughly search the 'archives' before asking
questions in this nyphp-talk.  the only reason i even know the virtual
host
discussion occurred is because i was  involved with the discussion
thread...
but i am just as likely to ask a question about a topic that was
discussed
in detail in the past or in another nyphp resources.

so i hope you find your answers Jon in the resources above.  i was
hoping to
hear from Jeff Siegel about his success story of setting up virtual
hosting.

As others have mentioned, a google is probably the best best right now (http://nyphp.org/google.php or click Search from the main menu across the top of nyphp.org).  It works good (I actually used it the other day to find something) but the only downside is there's at least a several week lag between crawls.

We're working on doing a new mailing list with tons of goodies, but until then the google search will probably be the way to go.  Unless of course someone wants to hack up Mailman, let me know :)

All this said, I'm not sure Jon's post concerned vhosts that much... see followup.

Admittently I haven't played with php5 yet, but this is how I would have done it.

Using the SetEnv, SetEnvIf, IfDefine and other tricks is great - I use them to setup application configuration in PHP (who needs a big application xml file any way :) and in combination with <Directory> and <VirtualHost> it's fantastic.

You can use many of the php.ini directives in this manner and it's hugely powerful, but not all, and you may run into some restrictions in regards to security.  That said, Jon, I think it'd make for a great article/demo on setting PHP through httpd.conf only (or as much as possible and what just can't bet set).

Agreed.  Although, you can eat up a lot of time/code/performance checking incoming data.  People deal with this in various ways and with varying levels of paranoia, but I've always liked the 'if bad data only effects that user's data, then that's his problem.'

It's also good to know where to validate the data, ie as it's coming from the outside world (browser), being passed around within your logic, or finally getting committed into a data base.  I've always like the first one.  Being conscious of this allows you to realize the difference between validating data as you should, ie from untrusted, external sources, and validating data within your application, ie programming mistakes.  Kind of the the hard shell, soft chewy center model.

PEAR should handle all this, regardless of the database itself.  That's the beauty of a DB abstraction, but... do you trust it?  :)

Yeah, in fact Oracle will often curse you if you don't use single quotes everywhere (not that Oracle uses SQL standards).  That said, and this could probably be viewed as a bad habit, when working with mysql:

$somenumber = (int) $inputnumber;

mysql_query("SELECT * FROM somedb.sometable WHERE numcol=$somenumber", $MYDB);

Quick, secure, and dirty,

SQL standards - which standard?

 

SQL-99

SQL:2003

ISO/ IEC (working draft) 9075-2:2003 (E)

ISO/ IEC JTC 1/ SC 32/WG 3

SQL92 Entry Level  or maybe SQL:1999 Core Level

 

This is a pet peeve of mine, but I will throw it out here
anyway, I wish people would say:

"Do you think this SQL syntax is 'portable' to Sybase (or
some other DBMS) " instead of saying "is this SQL 'standard'
".

 

Because that is what (I think) they mean. 

 

As for standards -- they are voted on by committee members
who are oftentimes placed on the committees by big vendors
like Oracle in order to steer the standard towards what they
(the big vendors) have already developed. That way the
vendors can advertise that they are fully compliant with a
certain standard. 

 

I don't really hold much hope to ever really 'get my arms
around' SQL standard syntax  - I will settle for being able
to use MySQL to get some things done. I realize its sort of
'sour grapes' - thumbing my nose at standards because I
can't understand them. But for me even the name 'MySQL'
holds a certain charm  - it is "my sql" verses say Larry
Ellison's sql.

 

Notwithstanding the above, I still like to read about SQL
standards and relational database developments in general. I
found an article at http://www.dbazine.com/gulutzan3.html
written by Peter Gulutzan, who co-wrote the book "SQL-99
Complete, Really" and now works for MySQL AB in their quest
to become 'standard'. Maybe this will be of some interest to
readers of this list.

Hello,

I am working with Smarty templates but I am having trouble trying to do 
what I want with them.  I want to print a block of code a specific 
number of times sort of like I would do with a for() loop in PHP.  I am 
not using values from an array so I can't use section or foreach loops. 
  I can't find in the documentation how to turn something like this into 
Smarty code:

for($i = 0; $i < max_iters; ++$i) {
  echo $i . "<br />";
}

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks
Scott Mattocks

As a hack you could make an array with the number of elements needed, 
and use that to loop in the template.
Sounds ugly, I know, but you could do it in your PHP code before you go 
to display the template, using something like:

$loop = array();
for ( $i = 0; $i < max_iters; $i++ ){
    $loop[$i] = $i;
}

There's probably a more graceful way to do it, but then, there are more 
graceful ways to template than Smarty, as we learned at last month's 
meeting. ;-)

Cycle loops is used to alternate or cycle through an array of values. 
It isn't a looping structure.  It will just return the next element in 
the array when called and then go back to the begining.  I need a loop 
that doesn't require an array for control.  Even a while() structure 
would work but I can't seem to find that either.

I thought about doing that but I want to avoid any unnecessary work in 
my PHP if I can.  I know that I could also just include PHP code in my 
template but I was hoping for something more elegant than that.  It just 
baffles me that Smarty doesn't have a plain old looping structure that 
isn't tied to an array.

try this:

  <select name="number">
    {section name=i loop=50}
       <option value="{$smarty.section.i.index}">{$smarty.section.i.index}
    {/section}
  </select>

It will loops from 0 - 49.
It's not in the documentation. I found it in a forum, but can't
remember where. But it works just fine with me.

It is a little baffling considering all of the other functionality 
packed in there. I guess for loops definitely cross the line into 
application logic.

In light of the overhead that Smarty imposes on your scripts, you might 
want to rethink the notion of avoiding unnecessary work in PHP-- after 
all, anything that you are asking Smarty to do is eventually being done 
by PHP anyway. Just because you can do something in the template, like 
logic or iteration, doesn't mean that you should. Take a look at the 
"compiled" code that Smarty is generating to see what I mean.

hmm i could have sworn cycle was an outside tag that let you go straight
through a set without skipping like what a for would give you ...

well either way you can always get away with {php}{/php} or {counter} maybe.

Thanks!  That is exactly what I wanted.  I wish that they had documented 
it though.

This is true, ive noticed a few variables pertaining to safe_mode are
protected but one of the more easy ideas pertain to auto includes + db
setups:

/usr/sbin/httpd -DEV

<IfDefine EV>
<VirtualHost *>
ServerAdmin foo at foo.com
DocumentRoot "/var/dev/www"
ServerName dev
# php stuff
php_value auto_append_file "/var/dev/dev.inc"
phpe_value error_reporting "E_ALL"
</VirtualHost>
</IfDefine>

should probably go into the virtual host phundamental setups or something.
my original problem with the 2 php's was the setup for taking php4ts.dll's
into effect (since they seem to only look for the single one in the window
path) ...

Jon,
Here is something which might interest you:
"... DBDesigner 4 offers the ability to connect to a MySQL
server and to create and synchronize a database with the
designed model"

The online online docs are at:
http://www.fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/doc/index.html

It can reverse engineer a database and store the schema as
xml.
It has an import menu for Erwin 4.1 xml (which I didn't try)
It can generate an html report
It has a query designer which can generate php (4.X.X) pages
with forms and views.
It is open source ( GPL )
It is optimized for use with MySQL but can be used with ODBC
(didn't try the odbc)

I tried it on a MySQL data with about fifty tables with
maybe a hundred attributes --
It seemed pretty quick (I wasn't benchmarking it)

I didn't execute the php pages but they looked okay on the
surface.

Flexibility like this isn't often used, and I think people forget just how powerful Apache can be.  It's a bit ironic, just to rant a bit here, how people feel the need for an xml-based application configuration file, akin to JSP/CF, when in fact Apache's own conf file is 95% there or more.

The PHundamentals guys have been kicking around an Advanced PHundamentals, and I think this is a great starter topic for that, when it comes together.

Anyone have a 'best practices' primer they can recommend?  I've got two

In fact, the other database will simply feed the MySQL one with out
reciprocation from MySQL.  Really _don't_ want to have to upload the entire

I would think to either to create a changelog, and then only sync the
changes (like the keys/tables of what needs to be added/deleted), or do the
changes in both databases at once, just that would be so slow :/

Ideveloper network has some information about data
replication (as opposed to database synchronization) at the
following:
http://www.idevelopernetwork.com/manual/Page0337.htm

Maybe its not 'best practices' but it will give some
background on the issue.

this would actually be kinda difficult I would think unless your data was
specific to use time/date stamping that ran in parallel because mysql only
uses actually a single file to keep tabs on a database.  I did some packet
analysis on what the SQLyog tool did initially, which seemed to match row
for row and then MD5 of the columns to analyze changes, which makes sense.

if you data was stamped (maybe a best practice) then you can poll one result
and update another.

Hans, can you please talk more about that?  Like, for example, is it going
to bitch about not using single quotes around a numeric literal you're
inserting into an integer colunn?  Or are you saying that it wants you to
use single quotes rather than double quotes?

Excellent link!

Does anyone HAVE that book?  I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd 
like to see it before hand, especially since it runs ~$70 list.  I called 
three Barnes and Noble's, including the textbook one, and they don't have 
it.

Thanks,

If it's a numeric column, and a numeric value, it'll let you get away without using any quotes, for instance:

somenumber=12345

But if it's a column of type string, date/time, etc, you'll need single quotes to avoid the "invalid number" error.  And double quotes are just a no no.

I've had good luck with Amazon's used books:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0879305681/qid%3D1027710751/sr%3D1-1/ref%3Dsr%5F1%5F1/103-4200861-4283003

Or, they have it for $50.

Yeah, I noticed, on both counts, thanks for making sure, though.  Thing 
is, I'd like to have it _NOW_ god damn it! :)  Also, I would like to see 
if it's really what I want.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] AOL, sessions
Message-ID: <003801c399ac$7e5db180$6401a8c0@EZDSDELL>

Here's the situation. On my client's website, a user fills out several
forms. Values get passed from form to form. Before the final submission
of all of the data, it all gets "cleansed" by a number of data
validation routines. All this is working fine. After submitting all of
the data, it all gets dumped into session variables (i.e., the post
variables get dumped into the session variables) and the "Thank You"
page takes the session vars and performs various functions. Again, all
of this is working correctly.
When going from the final page to the "Thank You" I use the following:

header("Location:$http://{$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']}/used_auto_parts_request
/used_auto_parts_request_thanks.php?code=" . session_id());

The "Thank You" page grabs the session ID and then performs its stuff.

This works quite nicely *UNLESS*, it seems, someone is using AOL and
it's built-in browser. Not every AOL user has a problem but some do.
It's not obvious how to even troubleshoot this (of course...I don't have
AOL so it's hard to test it). The only info I could get was that the
user has AOL 7.0 which should have IE 5.5.  

Any clues/hints are greatly appreciated. Is something being overlooked?

I have a bulk email script that sends emails to about 1000 recipients.  The
script has sleeps in it that cause it to run for about 2 hours after the
user initiates it.  Due to the nature of request/response, the user will not
get a confirmation message until 2 hours later.  I have set
ignore_user_abort and I would like to send the a confirmation screen to the
user that tells them that, "the process has been started and it will be

Sounds like a chicken before the egg thing.  Any solutions?

I frankly have no idea except the obvious, and a troubleshooting tip:

-- that's a space right before the http:// instead of a $ right?

-- maybe something like:  trigger_error("{$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']} => '.session_id());

assuming you're logging to a file; just to see that the crucial info is being generated properly.

Also I know AOL uses proxy servers up the waazoo; perhaps they are incorrectly caching pages, and the redirect isn't getting through properly?

I'm assuming you're using PHP as an Apache module, in which case you need to fork so that the mailing script is independant of Apache.  Otherwise, they share file descriptors and you'll run into problems.

I'm going to be finalizing a php component for this type of thing, but in general it might go something like:

[ in a script that is used in apache ]

	   $saddresses = serialize($addresses);
	   $mpp = popen('/usr/local/bin/mailer.php > /dev/null 2>&1','w');
	   fwrite($mpp,$saddresses);
	   pclose($mpp);


[ in a command line script ]

$saddresses = file_get_contents('/dev/stdin');

$pid = pcntl_fork();

if( $pid )
   exit(1);

posix_setsid();

$pid = pcntl_fork();

if( $pid )
   exit(1);

$addresses = unserialize($saddresses);

The simple way is to send them to a confirmation page.  Just print out the
confirmation on the original page when the process is done.  You can use
the output buffering functions to get the initial "be patient" message.  
You can also use it to spit out a list of emails sent along the way, if
you like.  Then, when it's completed, echo that fact out to the browser.

AOL's a pain, that's for sure.  It really blows when the big players 
ignore standards and come up with proprietary kluges.

Anyway, the simple way is to send it between scripts using post rather
than sessions.

That was actually a dollar sign in front of http and that code comes
from my local server and not the live server. I rechecked the code on
the live server (at least that particular line) to make sure there's a
space in front of the http. So...I'll just take a "wait and see"
attitude...that is, wait and see if anyone complains again.

I frankly have no idea except the obvious, and a troubleshooting tip:

-- that's a space right before the http:// instead of a $ right?

-- maybe something like:  trigger_error("{$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']} =>
'.session_id());

assuming you're logging to a file; just to see that the crucial info is
being generated properly.

Also I know AOL uses proxy servers up the waazoo; perhaps they are
incorrectly caching pages, and the redirect isn't getting through
properly?

I know AOL can create a challenge because of the things they do at the TCP/IP
layer, but are there things they do at the HTTP layer that violates standards?
I'd like to know about these things (maybe you can make a Web page for
reference), and I bet others would as well.

For all the heat AOL takes, I have to give them some credit for the aforementioned site - they obviously realize that their network and technical patterns effect people greatly.  I've found the site to be a resource, for not only dealing with AOL, but also as a window into the world's largest network.

That said, I haven't seen anything that would solve your problem Jeff, except perhaps proxy/caching issues :)

Jeff,

As a side note here, AOL on the PC uses whatever version of IE that exists 
on the user's computer, so you can't really tie an AOL version to an IE 
version.

On the Mac, however, the browser comes with the client so you can tie the 
AOL version to the browser version.  Up until very recently this was IE 4.5 
(this may still be the case on OS 9).  On versions for OS X it's a newer 
version of Mozilla/Gecko.

Hi all,

I'm trying to avoid a bunch of if/then statements by looping through 
$_SESSION.  I hit a roadblock that I can't seem to get around.  Here is 
a simple piece of code which I think gets to the heart of the problem:

$begin=1;
if(isset($_SESSION['$begin_fair_name']))
{
   echo "success";
}

Of course, this works:
if(isset($_SESSION['$1_fair_name']))
{
   echo "success";
}

BUT, I have between 1 and 10 fair_name fields (i.e. 1_fair_name, 
2_fair_name) coming from the form.  It would be much more efficient if 
I can loop through and perform operations as opposed to a bunch of 
if/then statements referring to specific fair_name fields.  Obviously 
the problem is with using a variable inside the array and I haven't 
been able to figure out how to work around it.

Trying to keep it brief here, but please let me know if further details 
would be helpful.  I would appreciate any tips or suggestions.

Thanks!

You need to isolate 'begin' as a variable; the above is looking for a variable named $begin_fair_name; that is, if there were double quotes around it.

One way to do this:

$begin=1;
if(isset($_SESSION["{$begin}_fair_name"]))
{
  echo 'success';
}

> Of course, this works:

But for the wrong reasons.

for( $i = 0; $i < 10; ++$i ) {

   if( isset($_SESSION["{$i}_fair_name"]) )
      echo 'success';

}

There are other ways to do it, too, for instance:

isset($_SESSION[$i.'_fair_name'])

or this

$_SESSION[${$i.'_fair_name'}]

What about using an array as your session variable, and loop through the
array:

foreach($_SESSION['fair_name'] as $val) {
	echo $val . ': success';
}

you almost did
you needed to either have the _SESSION var in double quotes to force
parsing or use explicit concat with period (.).

Ah, I see.  That's helpful.  Sometimes I am getting things to work but 
there is still a gap in my knowledge of exactly how things are working 
and being interpreted behind the scenes.  On a very basic, newbie level 
I might add!

Why was it necessary to create your own session handler? There is nothing
inherent in PHP sessions that depends on anything at the TCP/IP layer; that
would be foolish.

Note that this isn't the fault of AOL or an example of them violating
standards. HTTP is the protocol for Web traffic, and as long as that part is
right, the transport is independent. Now, if AOL violated some TCP/IP layer
specification, it would be a networking error, but still not really a
Web-related one.

The only problem comes from the fact that PHP makes available to the developer
some information from the TCP/IP layer, such as the remote address, and this
information is misused in some Web applications. AOL can't be held accountable
for that.

Aside from all the explicit advice you've gotten about how to handle this, 
make sure that "isset" is actually the test you want.  Check PHundamentals 
#2 at http://phundamentals.nyphp.org to see (or remember) just how

Ouch! I'd hate to start putting in my own session handler at this stage

Hmm, good reading.  However, the second line on the phundamentals 
article says "The focus here will be on determining whether the 
variable contains something;"

Since my form is dynamically generated, the first thing I am trying to 
do is determine if the array element even exists.  For example, if the 
user chooses to enter 4 fairs, 5_fair_name will not exist.  So, first I 
was checking it's existence using isset, and then if it does I can 
perform operations on it.

Does that sounds like I'm on the right track or are there better ways 
for me to check for the array element's existence?

I'd love to see a little tutorial or something on How To Do That. I've
tried it playing around with output buffer functions and I encountered
that familiar phenomenon know as "it doesn't work" (This, in a shared
server situation where there are some php.ini things I can't set)

I did buy Shiflett's book (wow, can't wait for the movie to come out!) and
it seems you can do cool tricks at the protocol level with the
"Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header, spitting out chunks as you go along
(although I've yet to try it), but I wonder how one does it in "pure" PHP
with the buffering functions.

As chance would have it, my scenario is similar to Stephen's -- I'm
sending a message to a bunch of addresses. No more that about 150 or so
for now but it would be nice if this script could (...dare I use the
S-word?) scale up well, and this technique of outputting the page as the
process goes along would help..

Aaron,
It seems like what you really want is an array of data. If you have your 
form submit the individual fairs as elements of an array ($fairs), 
you'll find php's array functions very helpful when determining what 
indeces are set. It seems that your prepending an integer to the string 
'fair_name' is just a poor man's array which makes your looping tests 
akward.

Best,
Robert Redcay

Hi Robert,

I do have an array of data, let me backtrack to explain:
In the first form a user enters name, etc. and how many fairs they want 
to enter.
On post, a loop iterates set number of times which is equal to the 
number of fairs they have chosen.
On each iteration, the loop spits out the html form fields that enables 
the user to enter each fair, i.e. 1_fair_name, 1_fair_location, 
1_fair_date, 2_fair_name, 2_fair_location, 2_fair_date, etc.  The 1, 2, 
3, etc. distinguish each fair.  If I was creating a static html form I 
would be naming the fields with the same convention.  Here I am just 
using php to create the fields.

I did this to make the interface more appealing, so the user doesn't 
have to wade through a long form with all of the fields for 10 
different fairs if they only want to enter 1.

Then on submit I am looping the set number of times again and testing 
to see if the array elements are empty.  If any element is empty I will 
reload the form with appropriate error messages.

On typing this I realize that I don't need to test to see if array 
elements are there.  I know what is there, based on the number of fairs 
they have chosen, which is stored as an array element as well.  I just 
want to test to see if said fair elements are empty.

I have been reading through the array functions but hadn't found a good 
way to say "Does array key "foo" exist?  and if it does, is it empty?". 
  I could very well be blind at this point.

Well, you could do it like:

Form input names:
fair_name[]
fair_location[]
fair_date[]

Then on the processor, the array size will be the size of passed vars.  So
if they only fill out 3 sets, the array will actaully be 3 large.  Hence, no
checking for empties.  The empties aren't passed (not sure if that's http or
php, but empties don't get passed).

Then you can loop through and continue:

foreach($_POST['fair_name'] as $index => $value) {
	echo '<b>Fair ' . ($index + 1) . '</b><br />';
	echo 'name: ' . $_POST['fair_name'][$index] . '<br />';
	echo 'location: ' . $_POST['fair_location'][$index] . '<br />';
	echo 'date: ' . $_POST['fair_date'][$index] . '<br />';
}

If you need the indices to be specific numbers, (Ie starting at 1 instead of
zero) you can set the form inut names as fair_name[1], fair_name[2], etc.

I hope you enjoy the book. :-)

There is an example on page 173 that shows how to perform chunked transfers
with PHP, and you can try it out from this page (it's flush.phps):

http://shiflett.org/books/http-developers-handbook/code

The flush() function is a tough one to debug when it doesn't work. Basically,
anything that buffers output can potentially cause problems. This includes the
Web server and the browser (IE, notably) in addition to things like ob_start().

If you try my example from my Web site, and it doesn't work, it's definitely
your browser that is doing the buffering. There are some tricks to get around
this with IE, such as sending at least 256 bytes of whitespace before any other
output. My example doesn't include this trick.

If the example on my Web site does work, then your browser definitely handles
the chunked transfer correctly. If you use output buffering within PHP, you'll
have to flush that and then also flush() to send a new chunk.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Aaron, I still think that arrays would do it. See my comments inline, 
and also play with code snidbit at the bottom of my post.

now you just need foreach()

exactly, which is what Micheal was trying to get you to realize in his 
post which pointed you to the phundamentals page.

In general, to answer the question "does a variable exist, and if it 
does, is it empty," all one needs is a call to the empty() function.
In your case, you need an additional call to the function 
array_key_exists(), but again, in this case you know the key exists, the 
only question is is it empty?


/* -------- example code --------- */
<?
error_reporting (E_ALL);

if (isset ($_POST['fairs'])) {
  echo "<pre>\n";
  print_r ($_POST['fairs']);
  echo "</pre>\n";
}
?>

<form action='' method="POST">

Fair 1: name:     <input type="text" name="fairs[1]['name']"><br />
Fair 1: location: <input type="text" name="fairs[1]['loc']"><br />
Fair 2: name:     <input type="text" name="fairs[2]['name']"><br />
Fair 2: loc:      <input type="text" name="fairs[2]['loc']"><br />

<br />
<input type=submit value="Go">
</form>

Hope this helps,

Urgh, brain fuzzy, must get food...  but I think I am seeing what you 
are getting at.

> <form action='' method="POST">

> Fair 1: name:     <input type="text" name="fairs[1]['name']"><br />

>
> <br />
> <input type=submit value="Go">

So in this example are you setting an array inside of an array?  From 
what I am seeing there is a fairs array that would hold a "1" array and 
a "2" array.  These "1" and "2" arrays would hold the key => values of 
name, loc, date, etc.

Ah yes, it's been here mentioned before, hasn't it. btw, it works fine
with Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U;  Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.2.1) Gecko/20030225

Thanks for the tips and the code to play with.

Hi there:

I've written a simple script that's moving files from a staging 
server location to the live server area (virtual servers on the same 
Linux box).

I'm doing it by creating a TAR file from specified files in the 
staging area, copying the TAR file over to the live area, and 
extracting it.

My problem is that all files coming out of the archive are having the 
user and group 'apache' assigned to them.  Is it possible to 
accomplish this without altering the user/group information?

(The script is being run from a Web interface...PHP scripts are being 
parsed by the PHP Apache module, not the CGI version.)

Marc,

I am sorry I can't help you.

After I read your post, though, something didn't seem right.
I thought I could remember something about tar preserves the
ownership of files --
Unless you tell it not to (with --owner=user  option)
So I searched the web for my own benefit ("tar file
ownership")

I found the following:
...
Package: tar
Version: 1.11.8
Revision: 1

The session below demonstrates a NASTY bug in tar.  Tar does
not
restore ownership of files.  I tried -p, --preserve,
--same-owner,
etc., and nothing worked.  I verified that my passwd file
was alright.
The clincher was when I ftp'ed the latest slackware tar from
a
friend's machine and tried it.  Slackware's tar worked just
fine...
At
http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1996/debian-devel-19960
1/msg00411.html

Now I am not suggesting that this is the answer to you
situation.
I am pretty sure its something a lot simpler.

But as you can see in the correspondence above it was very
specific about the
Version of the software.

That reminded me of the fact that it is always a good idea
to mention the release version
Of the software you are discussing.

Hope you find your answer(soon).

Regards,

Tim G.

The file ownership becomes that of the user making the write to the disk.  --preserve or --same-owner may help, but as time points out it's problematic at best.  You could also consider using cp -pr   which works pretty well, or good old chown :)

As a heads up, doing filesystem operations, especially when involving multiple users, can get sticky.  It's always worked best to execute some out of apache process to do the filesystem operations; PHP CLI works great! :)

I replicate from stage to live with a a script that uses rsync to move the
files.
With rsync you will be able to replicate only the files that have changed,
and also preserve ownership. It's also faster and can securely copy between
servers.

rsync is good. Another alternative is CVS, which is my preference.

As is known, I hate Spam.



About two years ago I came up with a simple way to eliminate Spam. I stopped
collecting all traditional email and directed anyone who desired to
contacted me to visit the contact section of my website. Here they were
instructed to either login or apply for right to contact me electronically.
This was a solution worked for fundamental purposes, stopping all Spam.



This under developed method for handling *email* didn't really take that
long to manage, having to review applicants and read mail. The difficulties
were not being able to receive acceptable automated lists such as NYPHP, and
emergency emails from non approved clients.



Needless to say, I started collecting my email again. I feel though, through
wide scale participation, all the hassle can be eliminated. It would require
a WS type architecture for the mailing lists and a completely new standard
for email retrieval and sending, but is certainly possible. Anyone up for a
project? Heh.



Another idea:

In the 70's and early 80's kids would pull the emergency brake at rush hour
on the subways of Manhattan. It had become a major problem. Then one day a
most of the people riding in a car, beat the crap out a guys who pulled the
emergency brake for no reason. Since that day no one falsely pulls the
emergency brake. Point being, these emails could be tracked and managed if
there were mass motivation.

Cord pulling was a problem on the Lexington Ave line.  The reason most

Not exactly.  The Transit Authority implemented my suggestion to place
alarmed covers over the pull cords.  Thus, people can't anonymously pull
the emergency brakes any more.

This is basically the whitelist approach taken by ISPs like Earthlink. 
It's also available as off the rack software, TMDA (http://tmda.net/). 
It's fine for casual email use where email isn't a critical path for the 
end user.  But there are inherent problems with it, for instance how do 
you deal with machine generated email like double-opt confirmations, 
notifications of ecommerce purchases, warnings like domain name 
expiration notices and of course bounce mail from mailer daemons telling 
you that your intended recipient doesn't exist?  For all practical 
purposes you can't preauthorize these sending addresses.

Another problem exists when you have two users with whitelists trying to 
contact each other.  In a badly designed system you could have an 
endless loop as the two whitelists fired off confirmation messages to 
each other.  Otherwise, one side is waiting for the other to do 
something before either party knows that a communication attempt has 
been made.

In the end, you need to queue those unauthorized contacts somewhere and 
inspect them periodically for "good" mail, but that's essentially what 
you do with a procmail or bayesian spam filter.  In the end, you still 
have to visit that "spam" folder to make sure that no "good" fish got 
caught in the net.

Dear PHP Developers!

Any Howard Dean supporters out there?? I?m trying to develop my website,
DEANROCKS.COM and need help! My programmer and graphic designer are both
too busy to help me any further and I am looking for people who may be
interested in joining the DeanRocks.com team. We started the site back in
June with a packaged program written in Cold Fusion that drove the site.
The functionality and speed of the program was amazing, however, there was
little room for design. We?ve now started from scratch and would like to
use PHP and a MY SQL database to create our new site with more
flexibility. My idea behind this site is to create the first online
database of Howard Dean?s endorsements nationally. We want to seek
endorsements from various bands, celebrities and political figures
nationwide and display them for public viewing. This will revolutionize
the power of endorsements as a political tool, because we will be able to
create a nationwide, documented network of support that will literally
rock the nation.
There are many things I would like to change about the site and a team
with fresh energy could certainly make this really happen fairly easily.
These are things that we need to work on:
-A login system- to capture people?s information and connect members with
each other (I really like the login system on this site!)
-A new message board- ours is horrible!
-A download section- with fun graphic and music downloads, hopefully
musicians who?ve endorsed Dean will make a few songs available for free to
members
-A blog with threads- so people can respond to our posts
-A marketing strategy- to get our site out there to more people and on
major search engines
-YOUR IDEAS- This site models the collective nature of the Dean Campaign
itself, bring on your ideas and make them happen! I have no web experience
and basically need people to do all of the technical aspects.

Please let me know if you or anyone you know may be interested in helping
DeanRocks take off, it will have such an incredible impact on the campaign
if we can get it together!

Thanks for your time and I hope someone out there can help!

Sincerely,

Amanda Mattoon

Sounds like it'd be a nice addition for mega-mailing list nyphp has planned.  Hope you can make it to the meeting tomorrow and we can chat.

Interesting article. I think it is O'Reilly who came up with the LAMP acronym
(I'm not positive), and you think that since these guys are from MIT, they
would be "in the know" about the real LAMP. Guess not. :-)

I believe the "LAMP" acronym originated in Europe.. Germany?   In doing 
some research for a "LAMP" certification, for a course series that I was 
teaching, at least  that's what I found.

Of course, 50 years from now the historical revisionists will say "Oh, 
that really originated in ...[insert newsworthy-place-here]  :)

Message-ID: <184670-2200310127193532944@M2W074.mail2web.com>

I have a class object I am calling in another class:


class Stuff {
  var $myObj;

  function Stuff($myObj) {
   $this->myObj = $myObj;
  }

  function doStuff() {
    print_r(get_class_methods($this->myObj)); print_r("<P>");
    print_r($this->myObj->name . "<P>");
    print_r($this->myObj->getName()  . "<P>");
  }

}


The first "print_r" works just fine and shows a "getName" method in the
array of methods for object $this->myObj.  The second "print_r" works just
fine and shows the property value that was set in a prior
$whateverObjName->setName('Whatever'); the value comes up as "Whatever". 
BUT the third print_r throws a nasty error "Member function called on a
non-object".  What happened? How did it turn from being a legitimate object
to a NON-object in one line?  Could someone with some class experience
point me in the right direction as far as using "getter" functions of one
object inside another object function?  Confused.

Thanx
Phil

With PERL, if passing two arrays to a subroutine the arrays should be
passed as references to ensure their integrity.

Should this also be applied with PHP?

Just curious, are you delcaring the function with arguments, or are you
grabbing them via func_get_args()?

Either way, I don't believe you HAVE to.

Are you changing data in either of those arrays inside the function?  If 
so, then passing by reference is more efficient.

Oh, you mean so they don't get flattened into a single list.

Is it not so that PHP -- I'm gonna try to say this intelligibly --
doesn't actually copy data that is passed-by-value unless and until you
change it inside the function? So pass-by-reference isn't necessary unless
it's what you really mean. Stated differently, passing by reference just
for the sake of saving memory doesn't save memory. True?

David,
This is the impression that I was under as well.
What I'm worried about is passing objects. Are they not copied until 
they are changed inside the function?

Thanks,

I believe I am doing the reference assignment:

$var =& new MyClass;

The identical code still fails on one site and works on two others.. the
site it fails is Red Hat 9, Apache 1.3 and PHP 4.1.3.  The others range
from PHP 4.0.3 to PHP 4.1.2

i am kinda stuck on what exact method to use ... it involves a plug-in like
related class in which i need to determine if the object is actually that
type of object ...

i had been thinking is_scalar($obj) would be ok but is there a better way to
compare?

what would be a better way to accomplish this would be to use something that
can actually compare (as example):

$myObj = new MyObject();
if (is_object($myObj, gettype($myObj))) {
 ...
}

this wont get an exact type (should return "object") ... but basically i
want to know if you can do something like this ficticious method to
determine object equality.  (coming from java where everything is an object
to begin with).

I would imagine so but you ought to ask a guru (-: In any case, if you
want forward-compatibility with PHP 5, you should not count on objects
being passed/assigned by value automatically.

Try:
    $myObj = new MyObject();
    if (is_a($myObj,'myobject')) {
        ...
    }

There are also the other class/object functions that may help such as
get_class, method_exists and is_subclass_of. See:

    http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.classobj.php

I'm not sure what 'integrity' means exactly in this case.

>>>Should this also be applied with PHP?

So I'm going to answer "no" here.  If integrity means "not copying the data the array contains" then you don't need to use the ampsersand (which is actually an alias, not a reference).  See caveat below.

PHP uses "copy-on-write."  When you pass a variable into a function, the function gets a reference to the variable, and the contents are not copied.  They are, however, copied if you decide to write/change that variable in any way within the function.  If you want to avoid this "copying-on-write", ie. want to change the variable that is outside the scope of the function, you need to use an alias by specifying an ampersand in the function's prototype.

This *does not* apply to objects - they are copied all over the place, which is why PHP 5 will be a big improvement for those heavy OO developers out there.

When there is a lot of code to display, please include it as an attachment, or include a link that lists the code.  Having it inline in the mail message makes it difficult to read and understand the code.

If anyone would use it, we can setup a code post webpage so that it can easily be referred to and syntax highlighted.

Hi all.  Just another too sense:

	In case it's not already obvious, PHP doesn't "flatten"
multiple arrays into a single array in a function argument list.
E.g. you can send three different arrays to a function and they
will each remain independent.

	Regarding passing references versus values for arguments,
I recall hearing from an expert at last year's PHPCON (West) that
passing references (instead of values) doesn't really save memory.
(David Mintz began saying this already....) I believe this is
because PHP's internal copying of an array is so efficient.  However,
I would assume that this is only true for arrays that are not "huge"...
if you want to pass a "huge" array to a function, I believe it
would be better to pass a reference instead of the regular way.

	What constitutes "huge" is probably hard to determine
exactly.  I would guess maybe an array larger than a megabyte or so.

	Also, you can conveniently specify pass-by-reference in
either the call to the function or in the function's declaration.


Best, George.

I think this is a great idea.  If possible it would also be nice to see line 
numbers and attach annotations as well.

I stop short of volunteering to build it myself, but this would be a great

Do what I usually do:  write it anyway.  If the tool already exists,
then you've provided (more) competition.  If it doesn't already exist,
then you've filled a gap.  Either way, it's a chance for you to work
on your problem-solving and coding skills, on a project that you're
motivated to finish.  Motivation doesn't come knocking every day.
Sometimes you want to code, but you can't think of any problems to
solve.  This, however, sounds like a cool problem to solve.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Handling MySQL result sets
Message-ID: <EB2FB004-0A90-11D8-9744-0050E4A02242@optonline.net>


As a newbie, I find it a little surprising that the mysql_fetch_() 
functions don't have a variant where any row of a result set is 
directly accessible via an associative array.

I am sure many users encounter query results where some column is 
guaranteed to have a unique value (eg. primary key), and could be used 
as a key in a PHP array of arrays. Instead, one must always proceed 
through the query result row-by-row.

There are so many different array capabilities in PHP, I wonder if I'm 
taking a reasonable course or if I haven't overlooked something. I have 
two MySQL result sets to handle when rendering a web page. One contains 
a set of Topics, each with one or more identifiers that point to 
relevant information. The other result set contains the information for 
each identifier.

I render the page according the alphabetical order of the topics. I 
dealt that within the SQL query. In order to directly access the data 
for each identifier and speed things up, I built an index where the key 
is the identifier and the value is the row number in the result object. 
It seemed less memory intensive to create a simple index rather than 
create a "keyed" version of the result object. (It also wasn't clear if 
I could directly modify the result object while looping through it).

Here's a snippet of my approach:

	// get the record of information for each identifier (pmid).
	$sql = 'SELECT pmid, doi, pii, pst, volume, issue, page, source, 
title, authors, affiliation
	        FROM articles
	        WHERE pmid IN ' . $pmid_set . 'ORDER BY pmid DESC';
	
	$refs = mysql_db_query("autolit", $sql);

	// pmid is a unique identifier to a record of information
	$pmid_index = array();
	$cnt = mysql_numrows($refs);
	for ($i = 0; $i < $cnt; $i++) {
		mysql_data_seek($refs, $i);
		$row = mysql_fetch_row($refs);
		$curr_pmid = $row['pmid'];
		$pmid_index[$curr_pmid] = $i;
	}
	reset($refs);

	// now, while looping through the rows of the Topics result set...

	$topic_name = $row['name'];
	$pmid = $row['pmid'];
	
	// use the index to find details for current pmid
	mysql_data_seek($refs, $pmid_index[$pmid]);
	$details = mysql_fetch_row($refs);
	
	$source = $details['source'];
	$title = $details['title'];
	$authors = $details['authors'];
	etc...

It's easier than you think-- here's how I'd do it:

$query = "SELECT * FROM articles WHERE  blah blah blah ORDER BY pmid DESC';
$result = mysql_query($query);
if ( !$result ) {
    exit( "Database error on query: $query -- ".mysql_error() );
}
$records = array();
while ( $array = mysql_fetch_assoc($result) ){
    $records[$array['pmid']] = $array;
}

And that's it -- that will give you an array $records, which is an array 
of associative arrays matching the records in the result set, keyed on pmid.

Arguably, it's still not as simple as $array = 
db_fetch_result_set($query); -- but then, there's nothing stopping you 
from writing that function and using it throughout your code.

Yikes!  I *did* miss the obvious. I was making it harder than necessary 
when I tried to build the keyed array:

	$details = array();
	$the_keys = array('doi', 'pii', 'pst', 'volume', 'issue', 'page', 
'source', 'title', 'authors', 'affiliation');
	
	while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($refs)) {
		$details['pmid'] = array();
		foreach ($the_keys as $key) {
			array_push($details['pmid'], $key => $row[$key]);
		}
	}

Thanks for the tip.

No way, man, bring it on -- just keep it brief, keep it smart, and don't

SQL is at the heart of what most of us do with PHP, after all.

The "best" solution is probably for you to do some sort of SQL JOIN
here. This will condense the two result sets into one. Or am I
misunderstanding what's going on here? I guess it depends upon the
size of your keyed information and how (un)common it is.

Yes, in principle that would be best. It also seems best to minimize 
the total number of SQL queries when generating a page. But I didn't 
take this approach because it would lead to some redundancy. The 
"topics" are not mutually exclusive, so there are often identifiers 
shared between them. (the topics are queries to a search engine, and 
the identifiers are result pointers; some queries generate overlapping 
hits). Size of the data structure might also be an issue, but I'm so 
new to MySQL and PHP I don't have an empirical sense of how fast it can 
be.

I'm anxious to get this first project working!

I think we've considered this type of thing and the concensus was to keep it all on one list.  Forums are of course available at http://forums.nyphp.org and are divided up a little more.

By all means, ask away.  For one, SQL isn't off-topic, and even if it was, well formed and complete questions are the most important factor.  Mr. Myers' post shows what a concise, organized and generally well asked question can do.

I think some of this comes down to:

Will PHP 6 (or 7 or whatever) be based on this:

They're pretty fast. :) Well, it depends upon your machine and your traffic.

In that case, I am always an advocate of doing the simplest thing
possible and then optimizing later if need be. Writing the JOIN and
retrieving the redundant data simplifies your PHP and will get you
going. If you later decide that this is a bottleneck, then you can
improve this piece of the code at that time.

Don't waste your time trying to "fix" something that isn't necessarily broken.

Personally, I think Parrot is very interesting, and the idea of PHP running on
top of Parrot and being a fast enough language that software traditionally
written in C can be written in PHP (without too many people laughing at you) is
pretty cool.

Also, at OSCON, I understood what the heck .NET was for the first time when
someone explained that it was sort of like Parrot. I think Larry Wall explained
Parrot better in 10 minutes than anyone has been able to explain .NET in a few
years.

Interesting stuff.

"Before I came down I was worried about how I would be accepted by this crowd as a Microsoft representative.  Would it be hostile?  Would it be open?  I was pleasantly surprised by how well I was received.  Everyone has been open, understanding, and engaging."

I think that pretty well sums it up.  The PHP crowd is often more 'open' than the Linux folks.

I need to update table2 with data from table1

the mysql4 code would be:
update table2,table1 set table2.field = table1.field where table2.id =
table1.id

how is this done in mysql 3.x ?

current mysql docs only show solutions for 4.x

Of course, I could do a php solution, but that seems less elegant.
conceptually:
select id,field from table2
foreach(id)
select field from table1 where table1.id = id
update table2 set table2.field = field where table2.id = id

I think PHP/Perl/Python/Java/etc collectively make up the C. There is no libc
yet.

That's what my analogy looks like anyway. :-)

Brian,

Here's an excerpt from the MySQL Manual 3.22

 "  * Updates and deletes that run over multiple tables is
harder to do
     in MySQL. This will, however, be fixed in MySQL 4.0
with multi-table
     `DELETE' and multi-table `UPDATE' and in MySQL 4.1 with
subselects. "

And:

============================
`UPDATE' Syntax
---------------

     UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] tbl_name
         SET col_name1=expr1, [col_name2=expr2, ...]
         [WHERE where_definition]
         [LIMIT #]

`UPDATE' updates columns in existing table rows with new
values.  The `SET' clause indicates which columns to modify
and the values they should be given.  The `WHERE' clause, if
given, specifies which rows should be updated.  Otherwise
all rows are updated... 

================================

Hope this sheds some light on your situation

Yeah. With multiple languages hosted by a common VM, you get access to the
same core function library from each language instead of having to
reimplement it again and again (cf. form processing, web services, image
manipulation, XML parsing, etc. etc. etc.)

When was the last time (if your name is Dan Bernstein, don't answer this
question) you wrote a version of strlen() for your app? Not very frequently.
When was the last time (even in PHP) you wrote a function to display an
<input type="text"> widget with the entity-encoded default value inserted if
present in $_REQUEST? I want that to be the same in any web programming
language.

all this session talk thought id throw out a question ...

a long time ago someone made a plugin-like feature for tomcat java server
which allowed for something like a reissue of a session id in which it
merged together contents from one session content (the hard file) into a new
session key.  it was something like:

session.reissue();
session.reissue(int); // tell it when to reissue after x transactions
(default 1)

it was mainly a security idea to prevent hijacking over time.

does session_regenerate_id() perform these same type of functions w/ a
transaction count?  and is there anything new in php5 pertaining to this?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Waiting for query redirect...
Message-ID: <E1AFKDT-0002Ip-Fe@server1057.webserver33.com>

(apologies if this msg gets posted twice, i posted form the wrong address
the first time)
 
Not sure how OT this is...
 
I've been working on a registrar app that requires communication with an
external api.  On some queries to the api, the request takes a few seconds
to go out for a response and return it.  During the process, the browser
basically just shows an incomplete page and then fills in the rest once the
response is given from the external server.  On sites like expedia.com and
orbitz.com, when you do a search and it goes out to the airline api (sabre i
believe it is), it shows an animated loading message, basically tellign the
user that it's grabbing the info they're looking for.
 
How would one go about doing that? -  Where it waits for a full response to
load showing a temporary page and then redirects to the query display once
fully loaded.
 
Thanks!

I have had success doing this in JavaScript the following two ways.

To show/hide the loading message on the same page as the results:
- Place your loading message in a block element such as a TD or DIV with an 
id of "loading".
- As the last line of the body in your document (and thus the last to load), 
use the following to hide it. 
<script>document.getElementById("loading").innerHTML = "";</script>

To redirect after page loads:
- As the last line of the body in your document (and thus the last to load), 
use <script>location.href='confirmation.html'</script>

You wrote:
...Thanks, but this gives me an error

Brian, sorry about speaking 'Dervish' (as in whirling
dervish)in my earlier post. I am often reluctant to say
things in a definitive way E.G. "It can't be done" even with
an AFAIK on it.

So I tend to just quote something definitive. 

The active ingredient in my prior post was:
>  "  * Updates and deletes that run over multiple tables is

When the manual says "harder to do" I take that to mean
(waffling again) the developer has to handle it
programatically.

I quoted the manual so that you could compare it with the
current 4.XX Manual, because the 3.22 manual is sort of 'out
of print' -- well you could find it on the web but it might
take you a  considerable amount of time. I didn't mean to
say that you could actually do it with 3.XX MySQL
statements. 

As to what you wrote earlier:
"Of course, I could do a php solution, but that seems less
elegant.
conceptually:
select id,field from table2
foreach(id)
select field from table1 where table1.id = id
update table2 set table2.field = field where table2.id = id"

I think what you should try is more like this:

A) Lock the table you want to update.

B) Select the records you want to update into a temporary
table.

C) Use a programatic (such as php) method to do the update
you want.

D) Delete the records in question from the locked table

E) Insert the temp records into the table.

The reason I would do it this way is that if you have a lot
of select activity on the table you could skip the locking
of the table in step A. and use a synchronization method
(like timestamps) to coordinate the deletion and insertion
steps.

As you probably are aware, the locking scheme in 3.2X is
table based. All selects will wait on pending updates (as
they should). But the effect of this is to make the database
seem real slow to some users when there are bursts of
activity.

Sorry -- I should have been more clear.

Off the top of my head...

You could cheat with some Javascript:

<body onload="hideDiv('foo');" >
 <div id="foo">Please stand by.</div>
.... rest of the result here

Trick is forcing PHP to flush the output buffer after you print the div.

OR you could hand off the query to a backend cli script that will write the
result to a file, and use a refresh loop to keep checking for the file and
displaying "please wait" if it's not found. 

That's a lot more complex, and possibly prone to security problems, but might be

And make sure to have a <noscript> in there for folks without JavaScript, 
providing them a link to the confimation page.

Or, I guess you can simply continue on the same page and eventually feed
the response below the waiting message.

Or, perhaps, you can place the results in another <div> which you can use 
style sheets to have it placed opaquely over the waiting message.  I 
haven't tried this, just a hypothesis.

To really figure out Orbitz, et al, do it, look at their HTML.

Great suggestions!! Thanks!!

I had actaully checked them out, and they were redirects.  I figured they
might run the query and save the results locally, then once saved, perform
the redirect, but wasn't sure how they notified the page of the redirect.  I
suppose they could do something similar to what's mentioned as a cached
page, and once the page has been saved, output a javascript redirect to it. 

And now that I look at it, here's the url params:
ViewFlightSearchResults?cache=1067557412820&requestId=117

Which says to me that it's most likely exactly that, just s cached page (or
set of pages) of sorts.

Thank you all!!!

Message-ID: <20031030202730.B16883@vtbear.com>

Hi!  This is a followup to Hans's comment about passing variables to
functions (from 'Passing Arrays' thread, Tuesday afternoon).

	So is it true that, even though PHP documentation says
variables passed to functions are, by default, passed-by-value,
really they are passed by *reference* -- BUT -- only when an actual
change (i.e. write) is attempted on the variable does a "copy" be
made?

	This seems like a really cool trick to try to maximize the
convenience of duplicating a variable's data only when it is actually
necessary to do so.  If no change is actually made to the data,
then there is no need to duplicate it; the function can simply
use the original variable -- because it is only *reading* it.

	Is this really how PHP 4 works?  If so, I'm somewhat impressed!

	Does anyone know if PHP 5 will do this silent optimization
as well?

	As an offshoot topic, is it really good that the documentation
hides this important performance issue, by simply stating that
function variables are by default pass-by-value?  I would think that,
as the prior thread shows, users *do* need to know this.


Best, George.

That's it in essence.  The point of them saying it's passed by value is to
put you on notice that, by default, anything you do to the variable will
only have effect within that function.

Yes.

I'm pretty sure this won't change.

Perhaps the docs could be clearer, but they're presently geared to my 
point above.  Also, perhaps the docs were written at a point when the 
parameters were actually copied and haven't been changed since?

Enjoy,

Thanks, Dan.  This is very cool news!  Does this also hold true for
values *returned* from functions?  I would have to wager that it
would....

I believe recall hearing some guru at the PHP conference in NY last spring

AS a follow up, expedia.com seems to use the hide the loading div method:

Here's a snippet:

<!-- srvpush2 18:05:48(:991) -->
	
	<SCRIPT>getObj('PT').innerHTML="Expedia.com is searching for cars.

	document.title="Expedia.com is searching for cars. Please

<!-- abcd -->

<!-- srvpush 18:06:02(:491) -->

And the result code is displayed here.

Thanks again for all the suggestions!!

Thanks for pointing that out. I had noticed that it doesn't like
magic_quotes. A shared hosting environment where I presently have it
installed has magic_quotes on and, well, it does some funky things.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Session Thoughts
Message-ID: <BBC7F8BE.19BE8%jmusil@villagevoice.com>


Hi,

I'm looking for some general guidance from those who may have gone down this
road before.

I'd like to be able to use PHP's Session functionality while a user is on my
site to save whichever preferences and other data the user chooses. Since
Sessions by definition end, I need to bring them back once the user comes
back.

It's a pretty simple structure to describe:

1. User comes to site.

2. Site checks for cookie or asks for log in. If either, then site restores
session data. If neither, then start anew.

3. User uses site to heart's content. New Prefs and data are added to
session and saved until next return.


The big question in my mind is whether this needs to be stored in a database
or can I just move the session files to storage directory?

How do I ensure that the new data and prefs is stored?

Can I just choose to not expire my session files?


Thanks for your thoughts!

Jim Musil

Message-ID: <E1AFcQf-0006jM-6h@server1057.webserver33.com>

Here's how I do it in my login class:

Store ONLY a user ID and any information that you query on EVERY page in the
session.  Everything else should be able to go into a users table of sorts
and be queried when needed.

Set a remember_me cookie with an md5 made up of a good combination of the
user's login, password and datetime they signed up.  The date/time ensures a
good variable result and the user / pass combination when used in your query
will be specific to the user.

In the top of your site files (an app_top or config or whatever), run some
sort of:
if (!logged_in) {
	check_for_login_cookie();
}

Whenever user updates their profile, be sure to update their session info
and cookie.

Also, make sure to provide the option of staying logged in, in case they are
on a public system, like a library or at work.

----------

I suppose if you have your own session management, you could also save the
session_id in a cookie and have it pick up where it left off, but I've never
tried it.. Just a thought.

Good luck!

Mark

I agree that's it's incredibly well written, although could use a bit more
of seperation of logic and data.  I find myself spending far more time
customizing the system than I expect due to just trying to find where things
are in the code.

ALSO, when adding contributions, BACKUP!! And be SURE the contribution is
made for the version you've installed.  The dev community is pretty well on
the ball, and they make some big changes from release to release, so you
might find your self bringing someone else's contribution up to date because
of some change in their class system or something.

Um... Haven't worked with it in a few months, so I'm a bit rusty.  Be sure
to contribute!!! It's an incredible community.

I'm putting up an OSCommerce based site. Just wondering if there are any
particular "gotchas" that I need to look out for, e.g., no magic_quotes,
etc.

Out of curiosity, when a user's cookie is compromised for whatever
reason, this ensures that the attacker is able to hijack the user's
session at any time in the future?

Or, does the check_for_login_cookie() function require a password or
something before continuing?

you can prevent that , construct the cookie like this:
hash( hash(password) | sessid | expire-date-time ) | sessid | expire-date-time

But yes the session could be hijacked and used before it expires.

If you use PHP session they will expire eventualy so its all taken care for you. PHP session dont carry any login information in the cookie, but if you construct your own session cookie you can embed the login information like the password in it yourself.

This is why I still roll my own sessions -- I was under the impression 
that the session cookie/url remains the same for an entire session, 
which may be days. That makes it a little too easy to hijack a session 
-- either maliciously by intercepting traffic enroute or catching it in 
a referer, or inadvertantly by sending someone a URL that contains the 
sessionid.

This appears to be the problem that session_regenerate_id() is meant to 
solve. You could implement your own transaction count, or just update on 
every request.

for a little bit of stability, you could store the session id and ip address
in a database, so that that session can only be used by that ip.. but that
wouldnt help people who move from computer to computer..

i would think of looking at some other source code, like phpbb, and see how
they do things. im not sure if those are "secure" logins when they re-log
you on, but its something to get ideas from.

OSCommerce has lots of functionality, but you have to be willing to get your
hands dirty if you want to start moving beyond the out-of-the-box layout.

yeah, thats what i meant by using smarty or something, the admin tool is
very nice but as a tip:

* do not upload it onto your website anywhere, for better security when
admining tunnel 3306 to ur server (ssh -L 3306:server.com:3306
user at server.com) ... especially for db backups.  in other words keep it
local.

* perform md5 checks on payment/shipping/etc modules once in a while.

I found the setup to be a snap but after toying around I then realized
that my ISP has magic quotes turned on. 

I had found a site that sells templates...not dirt cheap but some are
real pretty and if you think about the labor involved in doing it
yourself it may be worth the purchase.

The answer is NO.  Automatic logins are not secure.  Don't use them.

Also, FYI, just set the SessionID in the cookie.  Store the fact that
they're logged in or not in the session information (in the session
files/database/etc).

Second, set a timeout.  It's really not a good idea to have open ended 
sessions.  My preference is for the session to time out after ten minutes.

Have fun,

Not really, no. I am of the opinion that the idea of "atuto-login" is
what sessions are really all about. The further into the future that
the session expiration is set (whether you let PHP expire sessions or
write your own logic), the less secure the session becomes. I prefer
that the user be slightly inconvenienced by having to provide a
password after a certain amount of time has passed.

Remembering the username is convenient for users and doesn't lessen
security too much, so that seems fine.

There are other things you can do to make session
hijacking/impersonation more difficult in any case, and some of these
methods are worth applying. For example, if the user with an ID of
12345 has been accessing your site with a user agent of "Mozilla 5.0
(Badass OS)", does it make sense to automatically resume the session
when the user with an ID of 12345 accesses your site with no
User-Agent header or with "Mozilla 4.0 (compatible; Lame OS)" or
something else? I think it's at least a situation that's worth
prompting the user to verify his/her password.

You can do like Yahoo and provide a link that explains why the user
must enter his/her password again, in case you're worried about your
users complaining about the hassle.

NYPHP will be offering a course on this topic as part of RAMP, and I
hope a lot of people are able to attend.

Hope that helps.

I'm going to venture a guess as to what's going on.  I hope someone with 
more knowledge on the subject will corroborate or correct what I'm about 
to say...

The idea of returning from functions is different than sending data to 
functions.

Most functions return static values.  You can put that value into a
variable.  If you alter that variable, you're altering THAT value.  I
don't think PHP's going to be making a copy because there's no need to
remember the old value returned by the function.

Pardon me while I skip over explaining the whole "return by reference" 
issue.

Or who use AOL.  Don't rely on IP addresses when doing session validation.

A Web application should only use data in the HTTP layer in most
cases. The only exception is if you are in a very controlled
environment with a specific pool of users. If you are developing a
Web application for public users, using anything from the TCP/IP
layer is probably going to cause problems for your legitimate users
and doesn't really offer any advantages.

> i would think of looking at some other source code, like phpbb

I think it would be better to observe the practices of places like
Amazon and Yahoo. phpBB and many open source PHP applications are
very poor examples of a lot of things, especially security. Dan's
emails to this list demonstrate that.

I've heard of this thing called New York PHP, but I'm not too sure :)

By this you mean ssl + reask password for sensitive functions ? 
Reasking the password i think is a bit of overkill if a site with no money is involved.

I'm "no Jack Kennedy", but would be interested in an osCommerce SIG,
unfortunately I'm up in Boston so might not be the best one to try and
organize something in NYC.  Would be happy to help out though.

That's a pretty enormous oversimplification of Amazon and Yahoo. I
bet they would like to know that all they had to do was use SSL and
ask for a password for important stuff.

Being serious, there is a lot more to designing and securing Web
applications than that.

Hi.  I hope I'm not the only one who finds this discussion
enlightening!


Analysis & Solutions <danielc at analysisandsolutions.com> wrote:

	So what if you call a function that generates a large
data result, e.g.:

function GetStuff () {
	$r = array();
	for ( $i=0; $i<100000; $i++ ) {
		$r[$i] = LookUpStuff ( $i );
	}
	return $r;
}
$myStuff = GetStuff();

	Then does this large data set actually get duplicated
twice?  E.g. if $r takes up 5 MB of space, then does $myStuff
take up *another* 5 MB of space?  According to conventional notions
of "return by value" it does.  But Dan is suggesting that PHP
optimizes this situation by silently changing the $myStuff assignment
to "return-by-reference" since $r is legitimately trashed after
the function returns, PHP can simply substitute the actual contents
of $r for $myStuff -- thereby re-using $r rather than creating a
fresh one and trashing the old one.

	I had been assuming that if the variable the function was
returning (in this case, $r) was sufficiently large, it would be
more efficient to return a *reference* to that variable, rather
than copying that huge thing.  So in that case the function would
have to be called as $myStuff =& GetStuff();  or defined as
function &GetStuff () { ... } .

	Then, in general, whenever you copy large variables, do
the same concepts apply?  For example, if $myArray is 5 MB, how
much space does the following function use???:

function TakeUpSpace () {
	$myArray = GetHugeArray(); // array data size will be 5 MB
	$myArray2 = $myArray; // take up more space ?
	$myArray3 = $myArray; //  "   "   "     "
	$myArray4 = $myArray; //  "   "   "     "
	$myArray5 = $myArray; //  "   "   "     "
	// now how much space have we used???
	return $myArray;
}

	Does this function actually require 25 MB of space?  Or,
since nothing is actually written to $myArray2 thru $myArray5,
these variables are not actually copied?

Yes.  And no.  Perhaps this helps:

http://www.zend.com/zend/art/ref-count.php

Basically, (and I know there are some Zend Engine coders here, so feel free to correct me) the Zend Engine uses references internally; all variables in php land (those starting with '$') are references to underlying C data structures, called zvals.  Each zval can have any number of other names in php land, or aliases (think symbolic links), which are created explicitly by using the ampersand.  However, the Zend Engine also will create these references automatically at times, for instance to implement the copy-on-write for passing arguments into functions.  More or less, references are at the Zend Engine level; aliases are in php land.

Exactly.

> 	Is this really how PHP 4 works?  If so, I'm somewhat impressed!

And you can illustrate this easily with a simple script that reads 10mb of data and then passes it into a function.  If the function changes even a single byte, you'll see the memory usage of the process double (or more).  Otherwise, it remains around 10mb, plus overhead of php itself.

Yes, and I believe there will be improvements to it.  Especially important will be the implementing of copy-on-write, or reference counting for objects.  PHP 4 *does not* do this (ie, objects are truely passed by value - they are copied).

I think this topic is essential to understand.  So essential, maybe it should be queued up as a PHundamentals?

There is no magic tricks that Amazon and Yahoo to do to secure their webapplication and ssl and ask for a password is really what they do at the application level. I am sure they have more advanced network security and host security and they hired expensive consultants to audit their security but at the end of the day what they do anyone can do.

kewl.  I'm in.  Again, I'm no expert but have been hacking around with
OSCommerce from back when it was The Exchange Project.  Would be happy to
organize a SIG you just need to point me in the right direction/elucidate:
have you folks organized other SIG that I could copy (I'm a firm believer
that plagiarism and procrastination are grossly undersold)?

Perhaps a bit off topic but google for:  psyn nyphp

I had written a session scheme that uses syn/ack numbers just like TCP does.

I never really finished it but I have some more klunky code if you want to see it.

I'm not sure if I want to dig through "klunky" code, but I'd be

I agree that it's not magic, but if you think using SSL and asking
for a password is all that they do, or if you think this is all that
you need to do to secure a session or a Web application in general,
you're simply wrong.

Any code written by someone with this perspective is almost assuredly
full of security vulnerabilities.

I always found it odd that a request for https://mail.yahoo.com/ is
presented with an SSL certificate for login.yahoo.com. Most browsers
sound the alarm as soon as this happens.

I was not born under a rock and I can point to good example of Fortune 100 companies totaly screwing up security in web application. The Microsofts Hotmail password change feature comes to mind.  At the HTTP level there is only few things that can be done such as use of ssl and sessionid's and asking for passwords. This is only having to do with the interactions between the browser and the web application talking. Once the control passes to the application ofcourse million and one details have to be taken care of. There is no feature that would let you automaticaly log someone one if they have not clicked on anything because they went to the restroom.  

I happen to be an amazon customer and I looked up the cookies they left on my machine. There is 6 cookies 5 of which are id's and one that has sort of redirect url. They dont disguise the meanings of the cookie values for example one of 'order_cache_primed' and another is 'sessionid'. I entered a restricted function like change billing and i noticed that my session id has not changed from since before. So I conclude that even if i walk away for 10 meninutes now anyone can come and muck around in my amazon account.

eBay's login is http by default, and that surprises me.  You have to
click the "Secure sign in (SSL)" link in order to use https.  And, epier
doesn't even appear to have https as an option.  That's why I avoid
epier.  I asked them about that, but never got a reply back.

I have never, and likely will never, point to Microsoft as an example
to follow for software development, security-related or otherwise. I,
too, was not born under a rock.

Someone mentioned observing phpBB for security-related strategies,
and I pointed out the dangers in such and gave Yahoo and Amazon as
alternatives. Your argument is that using SSL and asking for a
password is all that these entities do, so it seems you think such
observations are useless. I strongly disagree.

Take those cookies, recreate them at a friend's house (within 10
minutes if you like), and see if your friend gets access to your
account as a result.

Let me know how that goes, and then tell me if it was SSL or asking
for your password that prevented this.

Actualy I thought why should i not try exactly this after all it wont prove anything either way. I didnt need to go to a friends house i have more then one computer. I copied the .phonix/default/xyz/cookies.txt file to the other machine and whent to amazons webpage. It recognized me fine , I was able to view my shoping card and wish list. It did not let me go to 'change payment method' feature and asked me for my password although it filled in my current email i was using for the account which i though was odd since if attacker got a hold of my email he could try the forgot password feature and try to intercept my emails. Anyway I think the reason why just copying the disk stored cookies didnt work was because obviously amazon placed that information in a hidden field in one of the forms. This is well known techiniques and does not neccessarily add security because cookies can be stored in browser memory just as well.

OK, so you at least realize that such an impersonation attempt does
not work, even in the hypothetical situation that *all* of the user's
cookies are compromised. This is the point I wanted to make with this
exercise.

As for the forgot password feature, I suspect that more is required
than an email address. Again, anytime you think you have discovered a
vulnerability, I urge you to try it. By discovering how sites like
Amazon prevent such attempts, you might come up with a few ideas of
your own. It is a very good practice.

What you just said makes no sense, as hidden form fields and session
cookies are not directly related. However, this is not important.
What is important is:

1. You should not try to make assumptions about what Amazon is doing.
Rather, you should research what they are doing and find out for
certain. Making guesses does not help you in any way, and you are
probably wrong when you do so.

2. You now have expanded your list of security methods to using SSL,
asking for a password, and this weird session cookie/hidden form
thing you are trying to explain. I suggest to you that there are even
more methods and techniques being employed. In fact, there are many
more. Don't assume things are so simple until you understand what is
going on.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Well if i had all the time in the world maybe i can figure out exactly how it works on Amazon but i dont have that interest.

Ok I am not going to disagree here.
One can make a long list of security methods. Another is to ask oneself weather any of the methods actualy add anything usefull.
Of the top of my head i can list these:
a. Use rewerite rules to hide variable names(seems like security by obscurity)
b. Check Referer Headers
c. You even said this check User-Agent Header
d. My guess on how amazone does it by hidden fileds (they may not do it i had not seen any such fields that may suggest that)
e. Somone suggested use transaction id and basicaly a hidded filed that changes on every form submit.

This list can go on but all these methods fail to protect against someone sniffing the TCP/IP connection. If they can see all the HTTP messages they can with time figure out how to get around all these methods. 

This is why i stressed the importantce of SSL as being primery importanse. SSL provides authentication(only of server usually), integrity and confidentiality. Something that all those other HTTP tricks cant offer. I would consider not using SSL as playing with fire and asking to be hacked.

The asking for a password again that only is ment to protect someon walking away from computer when they go on the site or if somone else sits at their computer.

One last comment (I think). :-)

If you can prevent every security vulnerability except those that
require sniffing the TCP/IP connection(s), you will have created a
very secure Web application, and adding SSL will eliminate the
remaining concerns.

So, don't assume that a protective measure that cannot defend against
TCP/IP sniffing is useless. This is a very bad assumption.

Hope that helps.
