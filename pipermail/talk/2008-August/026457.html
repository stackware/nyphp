<PRE>Here's another question.

Is an ebusinesses supposed to file taxes and licenses in every state they
are doing business?

How else are those sales taxes paid?

If you charge them you are supposed to pay them to the state.

NY has a line on the tax return for people to pay their online purchases
taxes.

That's crazy.  If the store is in NJ, it should pay NJ taxes.  That's where
the product is being sold and shipped from.

You would definitely need a cron job to keep track of the changing sales
taxes.

&gt;&gt;<i> Tax tables are available from NYS gov site.

The state taxes are based on County and City, which is nearly
impossible to deal with.  Zip codes aren't completely accurate but
much easier.  You can find the zip code data here:

<A HREF="http://www.oscommerce.com/community/contributions,2792">http://www.oscommerce.com/community/contributions,2792</A>

The only problem is that there are a few customers who will be pissed
that they are being over charged sales tax.  However, it if is a
national business, it will be less than 1 in 10,000 customers (a few
people are in white plains and yonkers zip codes but not in that tax
jurisdiction).

To do it exactly right, you have to geocode the address and use a geo
tax database.  this is offered as a service, but it cost roughly
$500/year.

Hope that helps.
