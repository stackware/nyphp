<PRE>on 2008-08-13 19:14 (Margaret) Michele Waldman said the following:
&gt;<i> Is an ebusinesses supposed to file taxes and licenses in every state they
</I>&gt;<i> are doing business?
</I>
It's an open question.

&gt;<i> How else are those sales taxes paid?
</I>
??? Typically, it is up to the individual to file and pay sales tax on 
any purchases he makes where the merchant doesn't collect and submit the 
tax.

&gt;<i> If you charge them you are supposed to pay them to the state.
</I>
That's why stores have those silly signs: &quot;We don't *charge* sales tax, 
we *collect* it.&quot;

&gt;<i> NY has a line on the tax return for people to pay their online purchases
</I>&gt;<i> taxes.
</I>&gt;<i> That's crazy.  If the store is in NJ, it should pay NJ taxes.  That's where
</I>&gt;<i> the product is being sold and shipped from.
</I>
Whether or not it's crazy, that's not the way things work.

I cannot emphasize this enough: be careful. States have very different 
ideas about what's taxable, what's not, and what constitutes a &quot;business 
presence&quot; in the state (the typical way they USED to decide if you had 
to collect and submit sales tax). As far as I can tell, NY is making any 
&quot;large&quot; retailer ANYWHERE nowadays collect and submit sales tax to NYS 
on your behalf. vis.

&gt;<i> You would definitely need a cron job to keep track of the changing sales
</I>&gt;<i> taxes.
</I>
Or an accountant, or a tax lawyer. Or both. And you thought keeping 
abreast of Linux security updates was a pain!
