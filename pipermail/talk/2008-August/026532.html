<PRE>I can't comment on vi + xdebug (im an emacs guys) but w/komodo &amp; xdebug 
- what is so &quot;impressive&quot;
is the ability for me to step through my code.

Say I have a class that does a few SOAP requests - My client hits my 
service and all they get back is a 500. Great.
How would I go about debugging this w/xdebug.

Simple, I'd set a breakpoint at the start of said method / class / 
function and step through it. I can examine
any and all variables at any point, step into or out of any 
function/method as well.

As I'm stepping through the code, I might notice where it errors out. 
Maybe it error'ed out because a variable
value it was depending on wasn't getting set, or was getting initialized 
improperly.

I can then step through the code in the debugger again, focusing on 
where this variable gets assigned its value.

I come from a c background, both on windows and linux, and the one thing 
I really liked was visual studios' IDE.
I can't imagine trying to write *enterprise* level applications without 
an IDE. PHP or any language.

Its truly one of my most powerful tools as a developer.

Also, take this scenario - Imagine you're handed a new application to 
continue development on. Looking through the code is
my first step, my second would be to fire up xdebug and step through the 
code. What better way to see the previous' developers
intentions than by watching the code in real time.
