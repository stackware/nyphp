I've been hoping to find a branch, at least, for strict p5 support.
It seems Cake 2.0 is headed in that direction.

I will check it out, thanks.

You're absolutely right, and being that this potential client is in
the public sector, I wholeheartedly (and mind-edly) agree with their
decision to use an open source project.  This is why, instead of
outright turning down the project, I went on a discovery mission to
find something suitable.

It seems to me that once php4 got it's end of support announcement
that these projects should have branches ready for those of us who
want p5 strict support

I've another project that came in disallowing me to take this project,
so I'll likely be moving on - but I'm still largely surprised by the
results.  If I had the time to keep a blog, this would likely be a
very long demonstrative post about the issue, including some eventual
patches.  Hopefully maybe I still can do that some time soon.

digitalUs - The installation had p5 strict issues (un-initialized vars
throwing notices, which could be easily caught with __get methods -
also some method signature differences.  once fixed (and @'d), ran
fairly well).

typo3 -  only required 2 minor changes to kill strict warnings (was
running mysql_fetch methods on invalid result vars),  But once it was
running, I couldn't get a new page added.  Seems a minor but obviously
significant bug in the page adding form processor.  Haven't had the
chance to dig in to find out why.

Thanks again for your responses.  It seems that if I were to take this
project, I would have to pick my favorite according to features and
maintainability and modify it accordingly - which is just fine - this
is just a surprising result.

Mark
