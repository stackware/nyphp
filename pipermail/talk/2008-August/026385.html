<PRE>I personally like the lattitude D820 my company gives me to use. The
D830 models are out and I don't think much has changed other than
ram/cpu configurations.

I never ran linux on it or vista on mines. The D830s seem to run vista
fine. My laptop screen has a higher resolution than either of my 20&quot;
flatscreen monitors that the docking station is hooked up to.

Yes its big and heavy, Thats' something I don't care about.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the (excellent) advice of the PHP community almost 4 years ago, I bought

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can anyone recommend the Lenovo t61p as a replacement, or is there something

</I>&gt;<i> I recently got a T61 15&quot; widescreen 1600x1050, Intel video and Intel
</I>&gt;<i> AGN wireless (model 6465-CTO).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I let it &quot;age&quot; a while before installing Fedora 9 which ran on it with
</I>&gt;<i> very little help. IIRC Fedora didn't install the wireless firmware
</I>&gt;<i> out-of-the-box but I think that was about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Originally I got the lower resolution screen, hated it, had to send it
</I>&gt;<i> back and Lenovo charged me a 15% restocking fee. So pay close
</I>&gt;<i> attention to the screen resolutions. If you like smaller text, make
</I>&gt;<i> sure you upgrade the screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a related note, note that the T61p (which has the highest
</I>&gt;<i> resolution) requires the Nvidia chip last I checked which non-Windows
</I>&gt;<i> systems do not support as well (Linux uses that driver wrapper
</I>&gt;<i> business).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was a little disappointed with the screen. If you move your head
</I>&gt;<i> back and forth it looks like there are shadows behind it. It's fine
</I>&gt;<i> but it's definitely not as *consistently* bright as my now quite old
</I>&gt;<i> T30.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The lid is somewhat hard to open and now it seems I can rock the
</I>&gt;<i> hinges a little in the open position. It's not a problem. It just
</I>&gt;<i> makes me wonder if there's an engineering flaw that might become a
</I>&gt;<i> problem later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the machine is a little big. I don't know if Lenovo designed
</I>&gt;<i> the IBM Thinkpads but it seems to me they could do a little better job
</I>&gt;<i> squeezing things into smaller spaces (note that I'm talking about the
</I>&gt;<i> widescreen version).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I'm a little worried about Lenovo. I could be wrong, but for
</I>&gt;<i> some reason I don't think IBM would have charged me a restocking fee
</I>&gt;<i> for a &quot;I don't like the screen&quot; kind of problem. But then again, the
</I>&gt;<i> prices have really come down over the past year so I guess we end up
</I>&gt;<i> paying for things either way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Despite the above mentioned minor issues, I looked closely at
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives and there simply were none. I don't understand how anyone
</I>&gt;<i> could buy anything other then a Thinkpad. ALL the other offerings out
</I>&gt;<i> there are more expensive, have fewer features, and are bigger /
</I>&gt;<i> heavier. The only contender is Apple because OSX gives you a UNIX
</I>&gt;<i> based OS, a really nice desktop and very sleek looking hardware. But
</I>&gt;<i> Apples are much more expensive and have fewer features so if you can't
</I>&gt;<i> really use OSX (e.g. you want to dual boot w/ Windows) or you don't
</I>&gt;<i> care about weight and sleek design, it's not compelling enough to
</I>&gt;<i> usurp a Thinkpad.
