I've been using the now discontinued Z61m for a year or 2 now, and I've 
been very happy with it.  The only issue I've had is that the built-in 
bluetooth is very flaky, but that seems to only affect the z-series.

I used to have a Dell D830 as well (was given it by a company I was 
doing work for), and imho compared to the ThinkPad it was junk.  The 
keyboard in particular was springy and the whole thing felt more like a 
BestBuy $600 special than a real business machine.

Right now I'd probably go with something like a T400 2767-R3U or 
2765-T7U, though if you can wait a month or so the 2767-R9U looks like a 
very nice machine.

Those are both 14.1&quot; 1440x900 models, but I think the reduction in bulk 
is worth the loss of screen real estate vs the 15.4&quot; 1680x1050 on the 
T500 and my Z61m.

For those not familiar with it, you can find a PDF with the complete 
details of every standard ThinkPad configuration here:
