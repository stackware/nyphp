<PRE>As originally conceived, the United States of America was not 
a &quot;democracy&quot; but a &quot;Constitutional republic&quot;.   School kids today are 
taught that these two things are the same, but in fact, they are not.

In a Constitutional Republic, the popular vote, or any executive of 
any governmental branch alone, cannot supersede the Constitution and 
the rights granted therein.  Only an Amendment to the Constitution can 
have this power, and that was never something that was meant to 
be &quot;voted on&quot; in a &quot;general democratic election&quot; where 51% of people 
could exercise a &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; over the other hapless 
49%.  

[I, personally, would not feel at all comfortable living in a 
true &quot;democracy&quot; where at least 80% of the population were, by any 
standards, borderline illiterate and completely uninformed about 
reality.  The governmental form we now have, which is essentially an 
oligarchy where the &quot;globalists&quot; dictate policy and we have this farce 
of a &quot;two party system&quot; we can &quot;vote for&quot;, at least has the benefit of 
being completely unaffected by the &quot;popular vote&quot;.]

I belong to a hereditary historical/patriotic society and we are asked 
to swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America -- 
NOT the &quot;elected government&quot; of the United States of America, who 
themselves, in the present day, are not upholding the Constitution and 
the rights granted therein, and in fact from a strictly Constitutional 
standpoint are probably illegitimate.

</I>vote idea, 
&gt;<i> which doesn't even apply with the EC in the middle. There is nothing

&gt;<i> mandates that the EC members of one state have to follow the 
</I>majority decision 
&gt;<i> of the voters. So if 80% in state A vote for candidate 1 the EC

&gt;<i> process? It is like me hiring you to do my work, but not givinh you

</I>&gt;<i> I agree that the cases where the EC member(s) voted differently than

&gt;<i> are not that many, but just having this possibility designed into

</I>such a 
&gt;<i> process that may have made sense 200 years ago. I guess it is kept

&gt;<i> it is much easier to bribe only a bunch of people than the whole
