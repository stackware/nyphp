</I>

I was just pointing out that Internet business has more State 
involvement than typical sales.

While you may say the location of the server is not an issue, I would 
bet that you would get an argument from MO's state tax revenue 
service if you told them they had no taxable part in the transaction 
I described.

And as far as the location of the drop-shipper, what if I was not in 
this country while making the sale, do you think that OH's state tax 
revenue service would find the drop-shipper exempt from collecting 
taxes by a company selling something in their state?

Currently, there are very few laws (that I am aware) that requires 
you to collect taxes on Internet sales, but every State in the union 
is scrambling to figure out how they can lay their greedy little 
hands on Internet sales.

And lastly, while Michigan doesn't have the specifics in-place, 
Michigan still requires you to collect whatever they finally deem 
required ex post facto.

While this doesn't seem reasonable, I've seen this happen before. I 
remember the Feds ('80's) requiring us to pay taxes that they had not 
figured out the formula for nor even created the paperwork. You 
actually had to guess how much you owed and make payment. AND if your 
payment was off by more than 10 percent, there would be penalties. 
That's a true story!

Now, does any of that make you feel better about Internet taxation?

Just a word of concern from someone who has been down this road before.

Cheers,

tedd

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  One of our customers in California contacted us for a piece of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  jewelry. We show them a picture of the item via our web site which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  located on a server in Springfield MO. The customer likes it and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  wants to purchase the piece and pays us via PayPal (a global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  company). The manufactor of the jewelry is located in Columbus Ohio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  and per our instructions and payment, they drop-ship directly to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  customer in California. Now, who owes what State taxes?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Remember, there are four States involved (not counting PayPal) -- and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I am positive not one of them will say &quot;No thanks&quot; to the possibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  of cashing-in IF they can.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  When we have congressmen like Ted Stevens who was opposed to an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  amendment regarding network neutrality and called the Internet a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;series of tubes&quot;, we are far from resolving the State tax problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  As Will Rogers once said &quot;Be thankful we are not getting all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  government we are paying for.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
