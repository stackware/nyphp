IME, &quot;part time work&quot; might be your problem.  If I'm going to pay
someone 50/80/100 USD per hour, I don't expect them to be &quot;part time&quot;.
If I need your help *now*, I don't want to hear &quot;I'll be over as soon as
I get off from my day job&quot;.  I, and my clients, pay for that kind of
access.

As for paying &quot;by project&quot;, it's all in how you approach them.  If you
say &quot;I charge $X per hour and I can do Y&quot; they will want to know how
long it takes you to do the project.  If you say &quot;I can install Apache
for you (your website is extra) and it will costs $300&quot; and they agree
to it, you just earned $300 to install an RPM.  One of my clients paid
$300 to have SpamAssassin installed.  Granted, the guy did a good job,
but I know it didn't take him $300/(15$/hour) = 20 hours to do it. It
didn't take the guy three hours to do it.

BTW, there *is* work in south Jersey. I've had a client near Eatontown for
years and I just picked up another one near there.  I can't pay the rent
on just those two but then I'm not located in south Jersey.
