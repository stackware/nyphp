Look, I'm not forcing them to do it.  If they don't like what I have to
offer, guess what, they CAN go elsewhere.  If I can't find anyone to do
it at the price I'm offering, I have to raise my offer.  That how Adam's

Oh, please!  Why don't you just call me a Nazi and get it over with.

I'm not ripping anybody off.  I am not forcing anyone to do anything
they don't want.  I am not the only game in town. I don't have that kind
of influence over another person.

A young fella recently contacted me and said he charges $25/hour and did
I have any work for him.  You're telling me that I am at fault if I take
him up on that?   

And for your information, I've never paid a subcontractor less than
$65/hour (does that rate meet your approval?) and I've told the young
fellow mentioned above that he's underpricing himself.
