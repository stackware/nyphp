<PRE>&gt;<i> IME, &quot;part time work&quot; might be your problem.  If I'm going to pay
</I>&gt;<i> someone 50/80/100 USD per hour, I don't expect them to be &quot;part time&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> If I need your help *now*, I don't want to hear &quot;I'll be over as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> I get off from my day job&quot;.  I, and my clients, pay for that kind of
</I>&gt;<i> access.
</I>
The reason I say part time is because I have to pay my bills and need a 
steady job.  If someone offered me a full time job, then of course I would 
probably switch if I was ready.

&gt;<i> As for paying &quot;by project&quot;, it's all in how you approach them.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> say &quot;I charge $X per hour and I can do Y&quot; they will want to know how
</I>&gt;<i> long it takes you to do the project.  If you say &quot;I can install Apache
</I>&gt;<i> for you (your website is extra) and it will costs $300&quot; and they agree
</I>&gt;<i> to it, you just earned $300 to install an RPM.  One of my clients paid
</I>&gt;<i> $300 to have SpamAssassin installed.  Granted, the guy did a good job,
</I>&gt;<i> but I know it didn't take him $300/(15$/hour) = 20 hours to do it. It
</I>&gt;<i> didn't take the guy three hours to do it.
</I>
Wow ... I think I install things at work all day long, its like a 
repetitiveness for me ... mostly ports though :)  I just wish I could 
market everything I do ... I can do anti spam solutions, LDAP solutions, 
Webserver setup, configuration, custom PHP, database work, Mail server 
setup, etc. etc .... so much, I just wish I knew how to get work for it.


&gt;<i> BTW, there *is* work in south Jersey. I've had a client near Eatontown for
</I>&gt;<i> years and I just picked up another one near there.  I can't pay the rent
</I>&gt;<i> on just those two but then I'm not located in south Jersey.
</I>
Well if you ever find anyone looking to hire for any kind of work related 
to the above, let me know :) I have resume and references :)
