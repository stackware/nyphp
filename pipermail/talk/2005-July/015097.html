<PRE>The real money can be found in cleaning up the mess left behind by these 
$15/hr programmers when they discover they can't complete the job or 
finally realize that the money it isn't worth their time and bail out 
1/2 way through the project (or are fired by the client when they 
discover things are not going as planned).

It is still a rarity to find an experienced consultant who can do more 
than simply convert raw specifications to code. One that can effectively 
communicate with the client, foresee problems down the line, offer 
suggestions on how to avoid them, accurately spec out time and price for 
a job, and deliver quality work within the bounds of the estimate.

If someone is offering you only $20/hr and you know you are worth much 
more, politely decline their offer and move on to find other work with a 
client that is more in touch with reality. In the end, it will work out 
better for you and your client.
