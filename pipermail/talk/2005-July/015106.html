I dont think there's ever a time where I can't finish a job.  I never give 
up, so I might ask for an extension, but I dont think I've ever not been 
able to do something.

I can't afford that right now though.  And I think other people agree. 
I'm in South Jersey, and there's not much more opportunity down here.

Plus, I've still got one more semester in College, to which I still 
haven't learned much.  Does anyone else agree that College teaches you 
things you don't really need to know?  I've learned more on my own than 
anything...

I think once I have the degree, things will be different...
