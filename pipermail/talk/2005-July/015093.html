Then let me give you some friendly advice, becuase a good PHP/Bsd/Linux guy is worth more than $15 hour.

1. Drop the &quot;Free&quot; in BSD. Per the SAGE salary guidelines, last time I read them, Using FreeBSD lowered the average salary, all other things being equal. I've got nothing against FreeBSD, but it seems to have a dampening effect on peoples wallets.

2. If you want to be more of a web-site programmer, add MySQL and some Apache. Make sure you read Chris' security stuff. E-commerce is growing in a *big* way and small businesses will pick you up to configure things.

3. Learn an e-commerce package like OSCommerce. Much of the hard work is done, and you can really speed up your delivery time.

4. Donate your time to a worthy cause. This will give you a portfolio to show your prospective paying clients, give you experience dealing with non-technical clients, and give you references in case someone should ask for them.  :)

5. This one should have been first, but I always have a harder time expressing it. Find your vocation. A vocation is a calling--it is what you would do if money was no object and all the bills were paid. How would you spend your day? When you know your calling and are working in it your passion will be communicated to your clients. 


Just my thoughts. I believe you could work hard for the next year and probably double your rate.

ciao!
