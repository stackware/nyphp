<PRE>Bill,

 

The closing tag in this case is the same color as the opening tag, and is
the same color used in all &quot;healthy&quot; PHP scripts.  I still suspect that your
possibility is the best suspect, and perhaps my next step is to get a Zend
Developer editor.  I appreciate your offer to review the code, but it is 247
lines long and the List Moderator is currently blocking the posting of that
code on the list because of its length.

 

Phil

Phil,

 

I use Dreamweaver as well for php.  For certain syntax errors that it
catches, it displays the closing php tag (?&gt;) in a lighter color to tell you
something is missing or added.  Maybe a missing or extra parenthesis or
bracket, or a missing or extra semi colon.  If the file is not too large,
just paste it into an email, and I will take a look.

 

Bill

Brian,

 

I did a Find Next on &quot;;;&quot; and found nothing, then a Find Next on &quot;;&quot; and
likewise found nothing suspicious.  I am using Macromedia's Dreamweaver
editor, which offers PHP editing with syntax coloring, but it did not
complain when I introduced the &quot;;;&quot; error.  I sense that this editor was not
designed for PHP but simply offers PHP editing as an add-on.  I'll
investigate Zend.  Thanks for the tip.

 

Phil

The way I usually find it is through Zend, but I'm assuming you're not using
Zend, or another editor with the red underlining on errors.  My only
suggestion would be to do a search for a ';;' (two semi-colors), or try out
Zend :D

Good luck.

My thanks to the following who responded to my call for help:

 

Flavio - I tested your code and reproduced the same error message.

 

Brian - The extra &quot;;&quot; is the prime suspect, but two visual reviews have not
surfaced the problem.

 

Jeff - I suspect you are right about the missing (or extra) &quot;;&quot; further up
the code.  That makes sense.

 

Joseph - The suspects have been narrowed with the help of Flavio, Brian and
Jeff, but the problem is still unresolved.  What is the best way to send the
code - attachment or paste into e-mail?

 

Phil
