Hey everyone,

 

As it&#146;s probably no surprise, I&#146;m a fan of compiling from source.  The
exception, however, is MySQL, which I will use either the RPM or tarball.

 

Especially for production systems, I&#146;ve found much better stability and
reliability (from a maintenance and system administration perspective) when
compiling from source.  Combine that with a high load environment, and
trimming the fat of unneeded extensions, etc. and source is generally the
way to go.  I will say, however, that for development &#150; especially on
Windows &#150; I&#146;ll use some type of package management or pre-built packages,
like XAMPP (<A HREF="http://www.apachefriends.org">http://www.apachefriends.org</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.apachefriends.org/">http://www.apachefriends.org/</A>&gt; )
which I use all the time on Windows.

Hi Leila,

Yep, I've found several sites for rpm downloads (though not yet php 4.3.11
for RH7.3), but I just wonder, how far can you trust an rpm that you find
that way?  I'm still a little green, but I think trust and integrity is the
reason I check md5sums on official php rpms from Zend; so if I'm concerned
about trust and integrity, shouldn't I be concerned about where those
unofficial rpms come from and what other people say about them?  So, I'm
just wondering if anyone's got a trusted source that they like for such
things.

Still, I admit, it seems like most people prefer building from source, right
gang?  And I'll probably end up going that way after all.

Thanks,
Allen

I'm looking for an rpm package for my RedHat 7.3 box
-- hopefully the 
latest 4.3.11 version. (Currently I'm still using
fedoralegacy's latest, 
4.1.2)
 
Could anyone point me to a source you trust for
unofficial php rpms?
 
Thanks,
Allen

Start by using google to find out exactly what rpm you
need.  I usually use a search string like &#145;what-I-need
rpm download&#146;.  My experience finding missing rpm&#146;s
this way has been very good. A couple of years ago
when I first upgraded from RH 7 to RH 9 there was some
dependency failures and as the result I could not use
PHP with MySQL.  It took a while for me to find the
patch and the rpm download for it but it was a good
experience and I learned a lot.   
 
Last week I finally upgraded from Redhat 9 to Fedora
Core 4, because I wanted to use PHP 5.  Now, with
Fedora upgrade, I no longer have to look for packages
everywhere.  Fedora comes with a utility (yum) that
links to specific repositories of upgrade rpm&#146;s and
installs from those directly.  Life is getting easier
and better every day.
