<PRE>A few years ago, I was in the exact same situation, and I did something
similar, I posted on this very group:
<A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=nyphp-talk&amp;m=116460542719740&amp;w=2">http://marc.info/?l=nyphp-talk&amp;m=116460542719740&amp;w=2</A>

There were a lot of great suggestsions then that still hold great value
today.

I've accomplished, and learned a whole lot since I posted that message, I
graduated from a top rate university with a degree in c.s., work for a
fortune 100 company doing embedded c / c++, however it all started right
when I posted that message.

If you're doing this from a learning perspective, pick a product you like,
and go one of two routes: recreate it or start contributing to it.

What I ultimately did was created my own CMS/blog for my site that was
awful.  It wasn't nearly as robust as Wordpress, nearly as powerful, or
nearly as useful, but I learned a lot as I did it.  Then I created some
programs to try and tie into my current fixation with WoW, which didn't work
great either.  Then I made a calendaring system, which worked okay.  I then
redid my calendaring project which worked pretty damn well, but that's about
when Google released their calendar product, so I dropped interest in mine.
The point here is you're obviously interested in PHP / programming for a
reason, so even if something is already done, there's no harm in redoing it
from a learning perspective.

If that doesn't suit your fancy, well, then I'd recommend learning new
languages and frameworks.  I'm currently reading a Ruby on Rails book, even
though I really don't have a specific reason to - I just want to learn it.

I hope that helps.
