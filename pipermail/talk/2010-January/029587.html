</I>    The architecture where &quot;multiple processes communicate with a shared 
database&quot; gets less credit than it deserves.  In your case I think 
there's no reason you can't write your batch scripts in PHP:  pretty 
commonly I write command line scripts that run as cron jobs...  In that 
situation,  you can use

<A HREF="http://php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-fork.php">http://php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-fork.php</A>

    to fork the same way you would in Perl.  I tend to do long-running 
tasks as cron jobs that are scheduled to run for a certain time (maybe 4 
minutes) and that get respawned every so often (say 5 minutes.)  You do 
need some logic to prevent them from getting stacked up when things go 
wrong,  but this works pretty well.

    BTW,  I've got no problem with an RPC-based architecture;  there 
really are two ways REST is a danger sign:  (i) 80% of the time it's a 
sign that people don't know what they're talking about...  They really 
want to say &quot;not SOAP&quot; and they've never heard of POX (plain old XML) or 
POJ (plain old JSON.)  In those cases it's easy to set people straight.  
The 20% of people (ii) who know what REST are actively dangerous.

    There are quite a few problems w/ REST,  but the biggest is the lack 
of transactional semantics.  It's easy to write a RPC that &quot;transfers 
money from bank account A to bank account B&quot; and handles all the 
transactional stuff on the server side.  Now,  it's certainly possible 
to build a REST system that posts a transfer slip,  and the posting of 
the transfer slip causes the transfer to happen transactionally;  that 
could be part of a great document-based architecture,  but I've yet to 
see somebody using REST in the field think that far ahead.  I suppose 
you could use REST together with a distributed transaction mechanism,  
but that's really asking for trouble.
