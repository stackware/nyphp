<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Oh my :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That applies to IIS, right? I just have to ask the question: can't you
</I>just
&gt;<i> use a real web server that actually works, like, let's say, Apache? I
</I>'work'
&gt;<i> with IIS at work and it is a totally dysfunctional kludge.
</I>
We're actually porting away from Apache to meet various requirements.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  I need to handle 200mb+ file uploads.  I'm aware of the all the
</I>caveats
&gt;<i> &gt; to this, and have set what I've thought to be appropriate limits in
</I>php.ini.
&gt;<i> &gt; I'm apparently hitting some other timeout/limit from IIS 7, though.
</I>After
&gt;<i> &gt; roughly 60 seconds, I get a server 404 message.  I've done some research
</I>and
&gt;<i> &gt; have seen this error comes up with ASP developers, and so I don't think
</I>I'm
&gt;<i> &gt; hitting a PHP limit/timeout (yet).  I've looked at IIS setting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MaxAllowedContentLength, but it's default value is apparently at 2gb.
</I>Any
&gt;<i> &gt; thoughts on how a resolution, or at least how to debug what limit is
</I>getting
&gt;<i> &gt; hit?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, circumventing an issue is also a valid approach. Does the upload
</I>have to
&gt;<i> happen via HTTP? Maybe uploading via FTP to the same box (or one on the
</I>same
&gt;<i> local network) may be a workaround. The script can then later 'upload'
</I>from
&gt;<i> that local resource or directly access the file, which should bring the
</I>final
&gt;<i> upload process close to local file copy speed. Using HTTP for uploading
</I>files
&gt;<i> of that size is very inefficient, but may be convenient.
</I>
I'm aware of other/better approaches, but unfortunately I have to play the
hand I've been dealt for now.

&gt;<i> I did search around a bit and came across one comment in the PHP manual
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with IIS having PHP installed as CGI. It is a bit older, but may
</I>still
&gt;<i> apply, load <A HREF="http://us2.php.net/features.file-upload">http://us2.php.net/features.file-upload</A> and go to the comment
</I>from
&gt;<i> 2003-March-09...or just keep reading here, I copied verbatim:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This took me a few days to find out: when uploading large files with a
</I>slow
&gt;<i> connection to my WIN2K/IIS5/PHP4 server the POST form kept timing out at
</I>&gt;<i> exactly 5 minutes. All PHP.INI settings were large enough to accomodate
</I>huge
&gt;<i> file uploads. Searched like hell with keywords like &quot;file upload php
</I>timeout
&gt;<i> script&quot; until I realised that I installed PHP as CGI and added that as a
</I>&gt;<i> keyword. This was the solution:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To set the timeout value:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. In the Internet Information Services snap-in, select the computer icon
</I>and
&gt;<i> open its property sheets.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Under Master Properties, select WWW Service, and then click the Edit
</I>button
&gt;<i> 3. Click the Home Directory tab.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Click the Configuration button.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Click the Process Options tab, and then type the timeout period in the
</I>CGI
&gt;<i> Script Timeout box.
</I>
Saw this one, too - somehow my control panel doesn't look like this guy's.
But, as far as I can tell, the FastCGI timeout is set to 600 seconds, which
is far greater than the roughly 60 second timeout I'm seeing.  Now I
wouldn't bet the farm that that timeout is actually the one he's referring
to, or that it's active for my &quot;site&quot;, but I'm not able to troubleshoot
things under IIS that well (yet).

&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, if I could figure out #1, I may be better able to debug #2 :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can't help you with #1 other than to see what the IIS and system logs
</I>&gt;<i> state.
</I>
They're not getting much of anything... bleh...

Maybe I will just change the business requirements to use FTP :)
