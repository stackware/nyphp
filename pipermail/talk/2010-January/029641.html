<PRE>Gary,

A cross specialized dba will not be out of a job with mongo, but a sql
admin will. Your perspective (shared by me) is hard to see for those
who are married to their specialities.

However, I will add one caveat to your statement. When a system gets
to a certain size, it behooves the IT team to segregate dba developer
and admin roles. From a change management perspective it creates
barriers that simplify documentation and auditing.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't follow this one.  How does it make the dedicated DBA job obsolete?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my experience withy the DBA world[fill disclosure, I started as a
</I>&gt;<i> programmer, moved into Windows Admin and DB2 DBA, then moved to Lotus Notes
</I>&gt;<i> Admin and Programming, before moving into PHP/Mysql programming]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The role of the DBA is to keep the system running, to provide a check on the
</I>&gt;<i> developers who tend to throw any old query together and blame the network,
</I>&gt;<i> the os, or the database for their lousy performance choices, to recover the
</I>&gt;<i> system when it inevitably has some weird failure, and to provide a central
</I>&gt;<i> resource for all things data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Programmers who butt heads with DBA's would rather just have them out of the
</I>&gt;<i> way so they can finish their work.  Of course, chances are that programmer
</I>&gt;<i> will be long gone when the crud hits the fan and so doesn't give a damn
</I>&gt;<i> about recovering from stupid choices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the years, again and again I've seen the &quot;this eliminates the DBA
</I>&gt;<i> position&quot; - MySQL......Lotus Notes.....everything.   What they really mean
</I>&gt;<i> is that you don't need a DBA to start throwing code up and together and
</I>&gt;<i> rolling it out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plus when you have a small team of programmers....one of them becomes the
</I>&gt;<i> DBA in effect....doing the small bits of work for it in the initial phases
</I>&gt;<i> and providing that central check.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where you store the data doesn't matter, you still need someone for all
</I>&gt;<i> those functions once your system achieves a certain level of complexity and
</I>&gt;<i> commercial value.  When having the system down for more than an hour is a
</I>&gt;<i> crisis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whether you need someone full time for that, or a maintenance contract with
</I>&gt;<i> a consulting team which built the system, is irrelevant - you need that
</I>&gt;<i> person there.  Monitoring, checking performance, catching problems BEFORE
</I>&gt;<i> they occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If all coders where like me...knowing a good bit of network admin, some
</I>&gt;<i> amount of systems admin, database admin, and programming - sure you don't
</I>&gt;<i> need that.  But my experience is that this is rare, most people specialize
</I>&gt;<i> in one of those skills.....which leads to a tendency for finger pointing
</I>&gt;<i> when things go wrong[it's the network...no its the system...no it's the
</I>&gt;<i> code....].  Of course, this always kept me busy with Lotus Notes
</I>&gt;<i> troubleshooting problems and implementing solutions when they cross
</I>&gt;<i> specialities[I especially would love the discussion where everyone thinks
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;ideal&quot; solution is to fix the problem involving days of effort by one
</I>&gt;<i> person....when everyone also acknowledged that there were hour or so of work
</I>&gt;<i> arounds they could use to make it work.....but that required THEM to do the
</I>&gt;<i> work rather than pawn it off on someone else.  So they were all too happy to
</I>&gt;<i> cost the company days of manpower to avoid an hours work.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry....hotbutton here.  I suspect that the &quot;wit&quot; who responded that way
</I>&gt;<i> was not a DBA but a programmer speaking as if they were the programmer
</I>&gt;<i> stereotype of a DBA....and I have little patience for crap programmers who
</I>&gt;<i> only care about their code and are willing to torpedo the business rather
</I>&gt;<i> than follow a little process.
