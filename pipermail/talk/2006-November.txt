Message-ID: <d2969d250611010327g34a88fe8n9112054120e45a5d@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to map multiple url to one controller method like this:

example.com/bmw
example.com/toyota
example.com/nissan
..
should invoke method (for example "view") in my controller with parameter
"bmw", "toyota" etc.
Probably I should configure it in routes.php but I don't have idea how.

Marcin

Hi,

    yes, $text is the string passed to rtrim, which in retrun is 
supposed to overwrite what is in $text previously. Kinda like
$k = $k++;
When k was 5 before this line it will be 6 after.

That string in question is build by a loop, so I may take your advise 
and do it differently. That still doesn't explain why rtrim doesn't work 
as I expect it to.

Hi,

    just after I hit send it made 'ping' in my mind and I did see what 
you meant. My script is wrong.

rtrim($text, ', ');

    does trim the string alright, I just tell it to send the result to 
nowhere as I don't pick up the trimmed string. DUH! I changed it to
$text = rtrim($text, ' ,');
    and now that works. The problem was between keyboard and chair as so 
often.

You should place them in a central controller or else you will get  
bit later ...

Ie:

example.com/cars/bmw
example.com/cars/toyota
example.com/cars/nissan

In your routes.php:
$Route->connect('/cars/*', array('controller' => 'Car', 'action' =>  
'view'));

In your car controller:
function view($car = '') {
   if ($car) {
      $cars = $this->Car->findAllByCar($car); // (dynamic) available  
in 1.2
   } else {
      $cars = $this->Car->findAll();
   }
   $this->set('cars',$cars);
   $this->render('view');
}

If you *need* to have those URLs instead you can just move the Route  
up one level.

Some informal benchmarking on my own showed that creating and imploding 
the array generally takes longer than appending and stripping, depending 
on the number of iterations in the loop: for fewer iterations, use 
append-and-strip; for more iterations, use and array and implode.

Hi Marcin,

Cake 1.2 adds support for this.  In app/config/routes.php, you can  
add a route like the following:

Router::connect('/:car_brand', array('controller' => 'cars', 'action'  
=> 'view'), array('car_brand' => 'bmw|toyota|nissan'));

The only issue is that all the possible values of car_brand must be  
hard-coded into the route.

Message-ID: <4548CD9E.9020205@fdcx.net>

Sorry for the OT post.  But most subscribers work in the industry and 
some MIGHT have some knowledge of sources of information.

I've just inherited the support and further app development for a bunch 
of thin clients running web based apps on NTA 6010 thin clients.  These 
seem to run some flavor of *nix as their proprietary OS.

My questions relate to printing to these boxes:

It appears that they may use cups as their print server software (as I 
can access it local with localhost:631 and actually get connected.  But, 
trying to do anything requires the admin username and password.   As no 
one has ever (so they say) set this up and I do not have any real admin 
access (because its a closed OS) what can one use for these values?

If anyone is familiar with this line -OR- if anyone knows of any source 
of info (other than their source - devonit.com) please advise.  And, of 
course, if anyone has any actual usable knowledge of these devices 
please share it?

Thanks for reading and thanks for responding.

    Creating delimited lists in strings is a common task,  and there are 
a number of patterns for doing it.  It's a task that PHP programmers in 
particular seem to struggle with.

    I don't like the pattern "create an invalid list,  then fix it up 
afterwards" and the related pattern "create an invalid list and expect 
the user of the list to deal with it".  All too often the "fix it up 
afterwards" gets forgotten or broken,  or the "user of the list" doesn't 
deal with the invalid list correctly.

    Until recently,  I used the following pattern

$list="";
foreach($values as $v) {
   $item=process($v);
   if ($list) {
      $list .= ",";
   }
   $list .=$item;
}

    Some will complain that I'm writing too many LoC.  More seriously,  
it's easy to code a pattern like this wrong.  One day I did this,  and 
decided to create a function to (i) reduce errors,  and (ii) reduce LoC.

function append_to_list(&$list,$item,$delimiter=",") {
    if($list) {
       $list .= ",";
    }
    $list .= $item;
}

    Now I write

$list="";
foreach($value as $v) {
   $item=process($v);
   append_to_list($list,$item);
}

    In terms of LoC,  this is as good as any of the other solutions,  
but has the advantage that the list is always in a valid state.  (For 
instance,  you can do a "return" to drop out of the loop at any time,  
the list is valid if an exception gets thrown,...)

    I added "append_to_list" to a file that contains utility functions 
that address my other PHP Pet Peeves...  You know...

$whatever="";
if (isset($_POST["whatever"])) {
   $whatever=$_POST["whatever"];
}

you might find this pattern coded up 100 different ways,  from the cute

$whatever=isset($_POST["whatever"]) ? $_POST["whatever"] : "";

to monstrosities that end up indenting hundreds of lines of code ten 
tabs because the programmer stacked a bunch of if(isset())'s.

Now I write

$whatever=array_get($_POST,"whatever");

this returns the empty string if $_POST["whatever"] is not set...  An 
optional third parameter lets you pick a different default value if you 
don't like "".

Another thing that drives me up the wall is

<input name=field1 value="<?php echo 
$user_supplied_string_that_may_contain_quotes ?>">

You ought to write

<?php echo htmlspecialchars($whatever) ?>

but that's painful.  It's nice to have

function q($string) {
   print htmlspecialchars($whatever);
}

So designers can write beautiful,  simple and correct code:

User name: <?php q($user_name) ?>

Alas,  there are two problems with this approach:

(1) It's tough to get other programmers on the team to be aware of this 
kind of library.  They end up scratching their heads when they see 
functions like this.  Getting them to take the initiative to actual use 
them is even harder.
(2) Defining functions in the global namespace pollutes the global 
namespace.  If you're pulling in libraries from multiple sources,  
there's a lot of risk that other people are going to claim names like 
"q()" and "array_get()".  It's not fun anymore if you have to write

PAULS_PET_PEEVES::q($user_name);

In some cases,  however,  you can do something like

$p=new PAULS_PET_PEEVES();
$p->q(...);

which at least leaves the option of changing $p to something else in 
places where you really need to.  This is particularly good for 
greenfield projects:  for instance,  I've got a struts-like 
"action-view-controller" framework where it's easy to pass a few utility 
objects with single-character names into the views that define 
anti-antipattern functions...  Views never end up with code like

<select name="myselect">
   <option value="1" <?php if($value==1) print " selected" ?>>Value 
1</option>
   ...
</select>

because you can just write

<select>
   <? $h->draw_select("myselect",$mychoices,$value) ?>
</select>

Simple. Write a php script that connects to your server and sends \x1a as input.

Don't forget, it's not just humans behind web browsers that we have to

All,

I appreciate your responses, but for some reason Brian's suggestion (which
is the one I can most comfortably follow, given my knowledge) is not
working.

Brian suggested:
<input type="radio"  name="Referrals" value="Y"
onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/Pop%20Ups/Referrals.php?user_id=<?=$user_id?>','Referrals','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=600')"/>


But once I put any parameter after Referral.php, all I get is that the "The
Page cannot be found".

I even tried replacing the button for an image and also a text link... and I
can't seem to be able to use either, to open the window AND pass the user_id
parameter (which is, indeed, a php variable).

An example of the failed attempt using a text link:
Just FYI : rstuserdata is my recordset,
                us_user_id is the field that contains (for sure) the value
which user_id should take
                user_id is the parameter I want to pass..

<a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/Pop%20Ups/Referrals.php?user_id=<?php
echo $row_rstuserdata['us_user_id'];
?>','Referrals','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=600')">USE
THIS TEXT AS LINK</a>

Any thoughts?  I know that, collectively, you've suggested other
alternatives... but given my limited skill, this one has a syntax I
understand, and I know where to put it, in the code...

Your advise will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Ariel.

Jon,

The problem I found with this solution is that when I create a link pointing
to specified brand cake automatically adds name of the controller to the
url. Say for example I create link:
$html->link("bmw", "/bmw/");
cake renders it as :
<a href="/cake/controller_name/bmw">bmw</a>
Now when I move up one level in routes.php the url is not pointing to:
 /cake/bmw
but
/cake/controller_name/bmw.
It there way to get around it?

Nate,
Interesting, but the hard coded values is what I'm trying to avoid. In
similar way I could just add methods in my controller named after each
brand. I will do that if there is no better solution.

I use the ADODB data abstraction library for my db calls, and it
/supposedly/ works with openLDAP, but I am unable to get it to connect
that way.

I have been looking around, and have not really been able to find many
resources at all that deal with LDAP directories and PHP.

Does anyone have any advice to offer in this area?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] LDAP for web authorization?
Message-ID: <4549FD47.2050208@fdcx.net>

Gentlemen;

A few pointers please?

My department has been charged with replacing multiple existing login 
mechanisms that support our PHP web intranet applications.  Fortunately 
we are a 100% Linux/OSS shop.

My thoughts immediately went towards a centralized LDAP mechanism and 
designing/creating a single callable login facility to accomplish this.

As I personally have ZERO experience working with LDAP, I was hoping 
that those of you who have had experience can share your advice as to 
what works/what doesn't.

Am I all wrong in my thoughts?  Are there other better solutions one 
should be looking at?

Your kind advice and suggestions again, greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Bob

Well, the route you are taking is a good one. LDAP, done right, is robust.
You should try to get *all* authentication done via LDAP. Linux has PAM 
modules to do authentication, and you can do authorization with it too,
utilizing the valid hosts, if you restrict users from certain machines.
If you are just looking for authentication, it's a no-brainer, for the most
part.

PHP has excellent hooks into LDAP. php.net has good examples of how
to use them. You just want to try to do an authenticated bind to the
server using username and password. If that works, you have the right
credentials, and go on your merry way (use this within sessions for
ease).

Tim

PS: I use LDAP for just about everything for my ISP (buoy.com), including
the backend for FreeRADIUS, which replicates out to 4 machines, so LDAP
is never down.

The trouble with LDAP has traditionally been that it is complicated to
set up and configure, and that front-end directory administration
tools are stone-age if they exist at all. It doesn't help that its
been around _forever_ so Google results get cluttered with out-of-date
info.

OpenLDAP binary packages solve the first problem nicely, but there's
still a few minutes of by-hand configuration and bootstrapping
involved.

As for LDAP administration front-ends, anybody have any suggestions? I
heard good things about the Netscape Directory console that was
supposed to be open-sourced last year, but I could never figure out
where or how to download and install it.

That all depends on what you are trying to do with LDAP. Simple account
admin and maybe lookups for email? You can do it by hand or with a basic
PHP page or three. I rolled out LDAP to work with Exim for about 6000 users
in about 3 days. 

www.padl.com has very excellent migration tools to go from flat files
to LDAP, and they wrote some of the software like nss_ldap and the
ldap PAM stuff.

I have some crufty old PHP code I slammed together in a few hours
about 4-5 years ago that will show how to manipulate the attributes
for mail aliases, if you want to see some real basic stuff. It's not
code that I'm proud of, but it served the purpose way back when, to
get basic tools out to the admins and helplessdesk.

I like the Java LDAP Browser (when you google that string it's at the top -- the url has "~gawor" in it).  Others are fond of GQ 
(i don't think it works from a windows workstation -- i use linux on my desktop).   I think that with the variety of LDAP setups 
out there, it really depends on what you want to do (as to which tool will fill your specific need).  There are lots more choices 
than the 2 I've mentioned; just install them and try them out.

Once one learns enough about LDAP, there's a temptation to create your own php frontend for adminstration (that was one of those 
projects that I never managed to finish however).

I'm pretty familiar with the basics of setting up LDAP servers and if questions are posted to the list, I'm happy to chime in and 
try to help if people are getting stuck with that part (as long as the list moderators don't consider this too far off topic). 
For those that really want to learn ldap in depth I'd recommend subscribing to the openldap-software at openldap.org list and/or 
hanging out in the #ldap channel on irc.freenode.net

I am in the middle of a project where the client uses LDAP not only as
a authentication tool, but also as a data store. My understanding is
that LDAP is not supposed to be used as a data store that is

It currently manages the data for something like 2,000 library

That was the design, but with the right hardware, you can make the
writes and resultant replication much less expensive. Schema and indexing
are very important. Just remember, depending on your implementation,
unindexed searches may cause the server to block, making the service
appear very slow.

That doesn't sound like it would be an issue. Just remember, 'right
tool for the right job'.

Most LDAP servers are generally optimized to be very fast on read, but not necessarily fast on updates/changes/additions.  If your 
client has no problem with the slower pace of writing back to the directory, I'd say there's nothing wrong with using it in this way.

$k++ will make k increase by 1. $k=$k++ still only increases $k by one
because ++ is a postffix operator, and the assignment of $k=$k happens
before $k is incremented with ++. $k=$k+1 is equivalent to $k++, but what
you have is an extra assignment for no reason, or at least it looks like it

When k was 5 before this line it will be 6 after.

Pheeew, that is some tasty-looking crack, API-wise.

I'm not sure if it enhances everything I've been working on for the
past 3 years or obsoletes it. But at least I know how to approach
category/label queries now: /path/to/resource/-/category/category

Thanks for the update.

Hi,

    I agree, that wasn't the best example to give. I probably thought 
first to write $k = $k + 1, and then recalled that a + 1 is easily 
expressed as ++, which also does not require to assign the result to the 
same variable. It really was only meant as example and I guess I just 
add two in future to make a point.
    The really embarrassing thing is that if I just would have looked at 
my code for some time more and did it as shown in my botched example, 
the whole mess could have been prevented. I got this squared out now and 
it all works and I keep on screwing my head on straight.

Nothing major that's noticeable, although we haven't done a thorough use

Hi, 
I use a slide show package to have live stock chart on my site. It migt not be the one you are looking for:

If interested, you can find a link to the original package over there.

Allen Shaw <ashaw at polymerdb.org> wrote: Hi All,

I'm looking for a free/OSS (preferably PHP-oriented) solution to this 
problem:  Deliver paged content (eg., typical still-frame slide show) to 
any number of viewers via the web browser only, while providing only the 
host/operator with the controls to advance the slides in real time;  and 
don't require the user to have anything other than a decent Internet 
connection and fairly modern browser.

If nobody knows of an existing package like this, it seems it would be 
fairly simple to build, no?  Page-forward/back/jump commands could be 
sent by the operator to a database or file on the server, and some 
Javascript in the viewer could be monitoring the server for those 
commands and then adjust the display accordingly. 

Question: Is this
a) so self-apparent and easy that nobody's bothered to develop a package 
for it?
b) much more complicated than I've explained and thus potentially a 
waste of time?
or
c)  contained already in some fairly simple CGI package you know about 
and I don't?

Thanks,
Allen

I suspect dozens of php slideshow applications out there, sorry I
don't have the links, however Google  is your friend on this one.

If you really want to do it right, Flash is probably your best bet,
people have been doing this for year in Actionscript and have put
together some very sophisticated applications that are way beyond what
you can do with php/js.

for example:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MyBic Users: problems in Safari?
Message-ID: <F1E29232-29C9-4FD5-A93B-5A72D675F055@sala.ca>

Any MyBic users out there? http://www.litfuel.net/mybic/

I've run into a situation where some remote requests are crashing  
Safari. I ran it down line-by-line and it seems to be in the  
Javascript JSON library that's bundled with MyBic. It chokes when it  
executes JSON.parse() while handling the request's response. Within  
JSON.parse() it looks like a validating regex is the offending line.

Admittedly, this is a Safari/JavaScript problem rather than a PHP or  
MyBic problem. Just thought some other MyBic users might have seen  
this problem. Anyone...?

BTW: I think MyBic is a great tool. Very light-weight, and easy to  
use. I've adapted the server-side code for my own purposes, but it  
has been a great way to get started with AJAX.

Hi Ed,

Yeah, I know.  That's what I was thinking, too: this ought to exist. I 
did google around quite a bit, but all I'm finding are apps to help me
put up a slideshow that the user pages through himself (for example, 
SlideshowPro and others).  What I really need, though, is the ability to 
let the *presenter* control the advance of the slides in
real time, as you would do in a meeting with people.

If I could find this existing, it would be a great thing.  I'd rather 
not create something from scratch if I can avoid it.

Thanks,
Allen

Allen,

I've never see a slide show application that does what you want to do short
of a WebEx or Windows NetMeeting presentation.

The rough approach I would take to your problem would be:

1) Create authentication code to determine slide show viewer or presenter

2) Create code to display the current slide as determined by a value in a
flat text file or database

3) Create code to update the flat file or database to set the current slide
(slide control buttons only visible to the presenter)

4) Create code to refresh the slide display page if there is a change in the
flat file or database

Most likely you'd populate an array with the slides in the order you want
them shown and page back and forth through the array with the slide control
buttons.

I'm a Network Administrator that sometimes wears the intermediate web
programmer hat and this would undoubtedly be the simple approach to this
issue. I'm sure there's some AJAX method of doing this in the way that you
describe, but that's beyond my current skill set.

Cheers,

Tim Boyden

Hi,

    a totally different approach would be to use the web interface from 
VNC and run the slide show on the server. I have no experience as to how 
well that works with multiple clients. Just an idea.

If You want to connect your application to an LDAP (OpenLDAP specifically)
you'll need to compile PHP with ldap option and the you can use ldap
functions (http://php.net/manual/en/ref.ldap.php)

You could also use send a "Webcast" of the audio and video from
a screen
using a media player with UDP or HTTP. 

The clients would watch via a media player (which could be a
flash or Java
window in a browser) for watching the "live" event. 

With this setup the "server" screen (with optional audio) could
be
replicated at all remote clients.  This "server" could be a
watched from a
media player or from a browser at the client.

You might consider Flash -- check out the scripts here:

I've purchased a few scripts -- they were all neat and worked quite 
well. I even use their phpFlashMyAdmin over the standard.

under an open source license.

Anyone who's interested can see more at the project blog: 
http://slides.sourceforge.net

This is the first project I've started that's intended from the 
beginning to be open source, so it looks like it will be a lot of fun 
and quite educational.

If anyone thinks it's worth mentioning, I'll be happy to report back 
here once actual code (PHP) is ready for release.  In the mean time, 
please let me hear whatever comments you may have, either by email 
off-list, or via the blog.

Thanks,
Allen

Hi Peter,

Those are actually quite interesting; thanks for the references.  They 
do seem to be attempting the same goal as me, but I'm not sure the 
MS-only requirements are going to fit my needs.  From what I can see, 
this is a pure-play MS solution, relying on PowerPoint (obviously) and 
the Windows IIS server or a third-party NetShow server.

Can't say you didn't warn me, can I?  :-)

This is the first project I've started that's intended from the 
beginning to be open source, so it looks like it will be a lot
of fun 
and quite educational.

If anyone thinks it's worth mentioning, I'll be happy to report
back 
here once actual code (PHP) is ready for release.  In the mean
time, 
please let me hear whatever comments you may have, either by
email 
off-list, or via the blog.

Thanks,
Allen

Disclaimer: I haven't read the entire thread and I don't have exact details.

I was at ZendCon last week and one of the presenters on Ajax stuff used 
a PHP/Ajax script that allowed him to change the slides in everyone 
else's browser as they followed along with the presentation. I don't 
remember who exactly or the name of the script he was using. Nor am I 
really sure if this is what you are looking for because, as I said 
above, I haven't read the thread. Anyway, the ZendCon site might be able 
to help you out.

Yes Scott, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about, though I hadn't 
thought of using it in a room full of laptops.  I'll try and follow up.

Efficient development Using PHP, JSON and AJAX
Jaisen Mathai - FotoFlix

 From the Wednesday morning sessions. I don't remember the name of the 
script (it is not FotoFlix though). If you can find Jaisen's blog he 
probably has a link there.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP and Apache doing funky stuff
Message-ID: <454FD70E.8040101@gmx.net>

Hi,

after loading a PHP script on my "production" server and accessing the 
pages generated by the script, I get wierd stuff like this:

<p class="center" ><input type="submit" value="Submit" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;????p;<input type="reset" value="Reset" />

where the ????p; is supposed to be a &nbsp; . I use a browser that is on 
the same box as the server, but access it not through localhost but by 
using the server's URL. That line shown above is the result of an echo. 
I receive this on almost every page and even in the type property of an 
input element, where it really just destroys the form. The browser 
thinks it is supposed to be a textbox although it really should be a 
submit button.
I used several pages connecting via localhost and did not notice this 
problem. Also, I access this site frequently from work and never noticed 
this issue either. Could this really just be that it is because I go out 
to the web and then back into my server that some characters get 
randomly garbled like this?

Anyone ever experienced something similar?

David K.

I'm developing a Practice Management System and Electonic Medical Records.
Something with a built in app server would be nice.

Message-ID: <c11f47240611071629t5a2489e2vf994c546b2372b40@mail.gmail.com>

Can a php script be made to perform actions on a site, such as: open it,
fill in a form, click a link/button, and receive the page returned? I've
been having problems getting cURL to extract a site behind an https login
and I was wondering if there was a more direct method.

thanks,

Yes, using PHP functions like "fsockopen, fputs, fgets" etc. you can do so. 
But this method might have certain limitations of accessing pages. For 
example, pages being submitted using JS might not work with this method.

It is not to be assumed that whatever acctions is performed using browser, can 
also be done exactly using these methods.

Thanks

Zala

Thanks Anirudh! You wouldn't happen to know of any good sites/examples
showing this kind of thing in action?

Here are some links with examples.

http://in.php.net/fsockopen
http://livedocs.phpdoc.info/index.php?l=en&q=function.fsockopen

You can also google term "fosockopen" or "socket programming in php" to get 
more materials like above.

Thanks

After a class watches a dozen PowerPoint presentations, I jack in my
iBook and show off something I did in Apples Keynote.

It's like wow!

Keynote just has that tiny Apple (Job'sian) edge in all things
graphics. It's all Applescript ready, maybe something in that
direction may work for you. AS is a pretty sophisticated language. Not
sure how it works over the web, but may  be worth a google or 2.

Did you know that that PNG is actually generated dynamically by a PHP
script that downloads the latest version of all those frameworks and
inspects the source code? Pretty nifty, huh.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] number_format / round issue
Message-ID: <45521773.9070105@optonline.net>

I have data that I am pulling out of the database a number such as 3.987 
and number_format() seems to work fine when i tell it I only want two 
decimal places but I am having a problem with 4.075 when applying 
number_format() I should be getting 4.08 and i am not.

This is running on PHP 4.4.4 on IIS

If i run the same code on a Linux PHP 5.2 box the correct number is 
returned, what is extremely strange is that both numbers being formated 
are in the same for loop, therefore the same operations are being 
performed on both pieces of data.


Unfortunately switching the entire system over the the linux box cannot 
be the solution(as of right now, it is planned for the future).

Just wondering if anyone else has run into this situation.

Sean, don't look at that graphic.  It is horribly outdated, and the  
author of the corresponding article barely did a shred of research  
before publishing it.  The article and the graphic have been updated  
a few times to correct some of the initial mistakes, but you can read  
the comments here http://www.phpit.net/article/ten-different-php- 
frameworks/ to see how many times the author had to be corrected.

As far as actually choosing a framework, others can provide you with  
information, but the decision should be based on your needs.  On one  
end of the spectrum, you have the Andromeda framework, which, as Ken  
says, is more of an "un-framework", and it's great for all kinds of  
heavy-hitting business applications.  On the other end, you have a  
framework like CodeIgniter, which is easy to learn and get up and  
running with quickly.  It doesn't do everything for you, but it also  
has probably the shortest learning curve of any major PHP framework.

Between those two is (my framework : ) CakePHP.  Cake is well-suited  
to doing all kinds of web applications.  It provides structure to  
organize your code, and will handle a lot of things automatically,  
while still allowing you to take control where you want to.   
Hopefully that's helpful.  Granted I'm a little biased : )

Yeah... I was going to chime in and say that the chart is out of date 
with regards to the Zend Framework too.  The current preview release has 
caching and the roadmap for the 1.0 release has an auth module as well 
as many options for web services - 
<http://framework.zend.com/roadmap/components>.  I've also seen 
discussion of possible ORM options in the dev wiki.
Zend Framework requires php5 and is not fully mature yet, so it may not 
be the best choice if you're quickly trying to get an app off the 
ground, but I think it has a bright future.  I'm also a big fan of 
CakePHP and thought the Andromeda demo app was pretty neat.  I'm not as 
familiar with the other frameworks out there.

I want this in a Smarty template:
 
PHP equivalent: $params[0]->Contracts[$params[1]]['textkey']
 
Smarty template: {$params[0]->Contracts.$params[1].textkey}
 
This doesn't work. I can't figure out how to make the nested ->Contract
[ $var[n]  } work in Smarty.
 
Any ideas? David Mintz.hint, hint..

there has to be some type of evaluate function in smarty because you 
want to evaluate $params[1] so i would start by looking for an evaluate 
function.

Yeah, I think $smarty's eval function can't handle nesting.

I created this work-around. It's ugly, but it works:

{assign var="temp" value=$params[1]}
{$params[0]->Contracts.$temp.textkey}

I'm not sure if it will work in this particular case... but sometimes 
putting backticks like this will get it to parse it the way that you want:
{$params[0]->Contracts.`$params[1].textkey`}
I know I've still had to resort to using assign in some cases though.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] So who's using Ajax anway?
Message-ID: <45531EF2.10109@secdat.com>

Just curious as to who has gotten into Ajax.  Would you say you are in 
light? Deep?  Use it for nothing? Everything?

I'll toss in my answer to get us started.  Andromeda was written first 
as a non-Ajax framework, so we had to add it in later.  We've got a 
small library that works very well on the browser, and are currently 
developing the server-side library of common routines.  We've used it 
for our report writer, and think it is very cool.

Generally we've moved over to doing all custom screens in AJAX, while 
the "for-free" screens that Andromeda generates are still old-school.

I've noticed a curious fact about using Ajax, it tends to enforce a very 
clean structure for your HTML, and also for the corresponding 
server-side routines.  It is one of those immediate gratification things 
where the increased attention to structure pays off as an immediate and 
visible improvement in the UI.

I've used it pretty heavily in my last 2 projects.  One was an internal
application for a major music company.  Had about 200+ fields (could grow to
a couple thousand) on one page.  With all the interior page functionality
needed, it was near impossible to make it a multi-page application while
maintaining usability and efficiency.  Learned quite a bit about JS
optimization and client / server communication on that project.  Only other
headaches were file upload, which I had to use an iframe for.  Though flash
8's upload capabilities are interesting (if only I could find an hour to
look into it)

My most recent project's cms is all JS/Ajax, though it's back-loading.  So
all the pages are available and all the links on the page (listing, forms,
etc) are normal.  Then I add the javascript at the end to overwrite the
links' onclicks and forms' onsubmits and add all the ajaxiferated
functionality.  The primary headache for that is generating both 'static'
(well, dynamic, but server-side) and scripted forms for each section, but
otherwise smooth-sailing (works in all major browsers / platforms) and
wonderful backward compatibility (static pages with no js).

I'm a big fan of google's method for such a thing in gmail and reader.  They
frontload all the data on the listing and then show it on the subpages
without hitting the server.  Great for a multi-page application, and I'm
hoping to implement it into my own projects soon.

I'd been reluctant, but it does do wonders for functionality as well as
takes a good deal away from server load if done right.  Also allows a large
form to load a bit 'faster' if you, for instance, load your dropdowns after
page load.  Also great for making your own caching, if you have say 20 of
the same dropdowns on the same page.  Load the data for one and fill the
rest with the same data. 

My only gripe now is dealing with adding html to a loaded page.  InnerHTML
is fastest but 'ugliest', but at least it lets the browser to the dirty
work, dom gets code-heavy and rather clunky.

I've gotten in to Ajax, but would classify myself as a minor user. I 
only use it when I want to change something (text or images) without 
having to reload the entire page. As such, it helps in the GUI side 
of things -- but other than that, I have not had cause to dig much 
deeper.

I have also looked into jQuery, which is like Ajax on crack.

http://jquery.com/

Here's a couple of examples:

http://xn--ovg.com/thickbox

http://xn--ovg.com/dragdrop

My only reservation into those type of time investments is WILL the 
new <whatever> work across all browsers. I have enough problems just 
trying to get css to produce the same result on most browsers let 
alone load in a bunch of libraries and hope that they do.

I've only replaced a few actions (like rating items) with ajax calls 
thus far.  I definitely like it and would like to put it in more, but 
developing new functionality is taking a priority right now.  A 
pagination system like the google method Mark mentioned would probably 
help with database load and web admin productivity.  For example, it 
would be great to send a search query via ajax to the database and get 
all of the results to the browser.  Then javascript can hold the results 
and display say 50 of them at a time in the html.  I feel that browser 
memory issues could be a concern with this method if you have thousands 
of results... maybe you still need to have a limit on the query.  Anyone 
run into browser memory issues with ajax? 

I'm also not exactly sure of the best way to deal with the browser back 
button and location bar issues with bookmarking.  I'd be interested to 
hear what people on this list have found as the best way to do that.

Also... are people using a javascript framework for the ajax 
functionality?  I've tried out prototype and jquery.  I like both of 
them, although jquery is much smaller and I've been using that over 
prototype since it seems to provide everything I need.

I've had a very positive experience with AJAX, and I'm starting to  
use it everywhere. It had a big impact on the maintainability of my  
code. It's pretty cool how it enforces the separation of business and  
presentation concerns. You application deploys an interface to the  
browser. Then, a lot of the functionality can be implemented as a  
private web-service which your interface communicates with. It  
becomes very easy to keep your services generic and presentation free.

One time it really saved my ass: I had an interface that needed the  
equivalent of select field for which there were over 200,000 choices.  
Obviously a plain select field wasn't going to cut it. The user  
really needed to run a search across those items first to narrow down  
the choices, then make the selection. This field was just one of  
several just like it on a single form that had plenty of other stuff  
going on too. Imagine trying to deal with all this as full post-backs  
to the server every time you needed to update the interface before  
submitting the full form. Not fun. Your code is going to be messy.  
But AJAX made that all go away.

So, I'd like to look into Ajax.

Any good books you can recommend? I know PHP pretty well, but I dont have 
much experiance w/Javascript, or Java (but I know c pretty well).

So, I'd like to look into Ajax.

Any good books you can recommend? I know PHP pretty well, but I dont
have much experiance w/Javascript, or Java (but I know c pretty well).

I've only replaced a few actions (like rating items) with ajax calls
thus far.  I definitely like it and would like to put it in more, but
developing new functionality is taking a priority right now.  A
pagination system like the google method Mark mentioned would probably
help with database load and web admin productivity.  For example, it
would be great to send a search query via ajax to the database and get
all of the results to the browser.  Then javascript can hold the results
and display say 50 of them at a time in the html.  I feel that browser
memory issues could be a concern with this method if you have thousands
of results... maybe you still need to have a limit on the query.  Anyone
run into browser memory issues with ajax?

I'm also not exactly sure of the best way to deal with the browser back
button and location bar issues with bookmarking.  I'd be interested to
hear what people on this list have found as the best way to do that.

Also... are people using a javascript framework for the ajax
functionality?  I've tried out prototype and jquery.  I like both of
them, although jquery is much smaller and I've been using that over
prototype since it seems to provide everything I need.

One excellent free AJAX resource is Michael Mahemoff's softwareas.com  
podcast. He also has a companion website goes along with his book  
ajaxpatterns.org (although it seems to be down right now).

Start here: http://softwareas.com/ajax-basics-podcast-1 and work your  
way forward from there.

Once you understand the fundamentals, find a simple framework to help  
you get started. I like MyBic. http://www.litfuel.net/mybic/ It's  
pretty lightweight, but has some nice extra features like a built-in  
debugger, and default behavior for gracefully handling network-down  
issues and things like that.

What other AJAX frameworks are people using? Ken, I know you've  
rolled your own that looks super-lean. I'd like to try that. I've  
tried PEAR's HTML_AXAJ, but found it overkill.

I'm not currently using a server-side php ajax framework.  I do the 
following check on incoming requests:
isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']) && $_SERVER 
['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']  == 'XMLHttpRequest'
Prototype and jQuery ajax calls (and maybe other frameworks) set that 
header to their requests, so can do the above check and use a different 
template or execute different code or whatever.  That way can support 
requests for ajax and regular page requests with the same url and 
without changing much server side code.

I'm using my own Ajax API on a couple of our management systems.

It's fun.  You still need middleware for db connectivity -- and you'll
realistically need backup (ie, normal) solutions if you're not in a closed
environment -- but there's a ton of neat tricks you can do (especially if you
go more DHTML-heavy), so if you're willing to put in 3-4 times more 
development
time (by my estimates) to make sure all your initiatives are tight, then why
not.

For you guys, does the X in AJAX really stand for XML? Or are you sending
back finished HTML?

When it's finished HTML, dropping it into your page is utter cake, but the
front/back presentation/biz logic separation is less clean. When it's
XML, you find yourself doing all that DOM stuff and it gets tedious. Why
go to the trouble of generating XML if you never intend to do anything but
turn it into HTML anyway?

Unless I'm missing something...

When I first got into this mess a year or two ago, your Smarty
presentation -- or was it class notes? -- was one of the first things I
ever read. You owe me -- is McSorely's still around?!

I ended up using Smarty assign to break it up a bit. Perhaps Smarty can
parse nesting, but I think a good rule of thumb may be that when the
human can't read it, don't expect the computer to be able to parse it.

I tend to hate to "flatten" data structures, as see it as unnecessary
data movement/swapping and performance hit to accommodate our feeble
minds, but I'm slowly learning that readability and maintainability is
often worth the hit.

Finished HTML.

On the PHP side we send back a big string, composed of object IDs and 
innerHTML values.  Delimiters are pipe and a pipe-star-pipe, like the 
following:

object_1|<span class="notice">Everything worked great!</span>
|-|
object_2|<table><tr>.....
|-|
object_3|<select><option>....

The browser side cuts it up and assigns the innerHTML.

We can also send alerts back for debugging, like this:

echo|This text will appear in an alert

and finally if there is no pipe symbol in the return, the js assumes 
something is very wrong and displays the HTML in an alert.  It does the 
same thing if the named object does not exist.

You can return xml or text, and that text can be an "innerhtml, json, or
anything else you can dream up. For simply stuff I just return plain
text strings, "innerhtml stuff" or even just a few "switches" and text
in the text response for further Javascript processing. AHAH (async HTML
& HTTP) instead of AJAX.

For returning HTML blocks I just use plain text. But if I don't want  
my server-side handlers to have to know too much about the html  
context in which they will be used I send back raw data in JSON. JSON  
rocks. You just need a library on the server-side to translate your  
PHP data structures into JSON.

ex:

array('name' => 'joe', age => '35');

is transformed into a simple javascript object that is easy to work  
with.

{ name : 'joe', age : '35' }

who needs the headache of XML for this?

I just upgraded a box w/ 4.4 and included --with-gd and php -m shows gd
but imagecreatefromjpeg() can no longer be accessed or any of the jpeg
functions and libjpeg is installed ... did I miss a step here?

Thanks.

To enable support for jpeg-6b add --with-jpeg-dir=DIR.
To enable support for png add --with-png-dir=DIR. Note, libpng
requires the zlib library, therefore add --with-zlib-dir[=DIR] to your
configure line.

You probably need to add --with-jpeg to your configure statement (and 
--with-png if you want that too).  I actually needed to compile libjpeg 
on my Fedora Core 5 box as php couldn't find it, nor could I.  So then I 
had --with-jpeg-dir=/usr/local in my configure statement.

I return JSON for everything. Using the PECL extension if I can, or a
library otherwise (extension makes solar systems of difference).  Because
the returns aren't always spit directly back into the page.  Sometimes
(often) they need to interact with already existing client data.

Ken, any reason you wouldn't just generate JavaScript to be eval'd on  
the client side?

I would think that would actually be more efficient, despite the use  
of eval().  It also saves you from having to re-implement more  
JavaScript language features, should you choose to expand your  
dynamic capabilities.  Also, (and the likelihood of this may be a  
little far-fetched), it insulates you against having your client side  
code misinterpret control character sequences embedded in the text.

Thanks for indulging my curiosities.

Only inertia :)

The code we have works, so I've kind of gone on to other things.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] A Joomla question
Message-ID: <4554874C.7040309@secdat.com>

Hi folks, I'm wondering if a Joomla wizard out there might be able to 
speak up and help me out.

I've joined rockettheme.com and am using his templates for Andromeda 
apps.  I've written a simple compatibility layer and am just about at 
the point where I can drop in a Joomla template and have it JustWork(tm).

My question centers around menus.  These themes are making pulls out of 
a menu table and populating an array of objects.  I've modified the code 
so that it pulls from my own menu and builds a similar array of 
objects.  Question is, will this be compatible with templates from other 
sources?  Is the menu table in Joomla fairly uniform for everyone, or 
can there by wide divergences?

Actually, if you return vanilla HTML it's called
AHAH -- Asynchronous HTML and HTTP.

You can't make this stuff up (or someone else did).

Sorry if I sound stupid and unable to understand what you're trying to do: 
are you trying to write your own menus instead of using the existing 
component in Joomla?

Yes and No.

We do not actually use Joomla.  We only use Joomla templates.

We use the Andromeda framework, which is all about building database 
applications.  The menu is generated by Andromeda based on the database 
itself.  This is very very different from the CMS functions of Joomla, 
which we really don't need.

But Andromeda has no real UI component.  So we wrote a compatibility 
layer that opens up the world of Joomla templates for our use.  Now I 
can download a Joomla template, put it into my Andromeda app, and I have 
a UI.  So we have Joomla templates but no Joomla.

One of the attractions of these templates is they often have nifty 
drop-down menus, animated menus, and so forth.  But the template is 
trying to read from a Joomla table, which ain't there!  So I modify the 
database retrieval code to pull menu information from the Andromeda 
source instead. 

So this leads to my question:  Do all joomla templates read from the 
same menu table?  If they do, then what works for one will work for 
another.  That's what I'm trying to figure out.

OK, now I understand (even if I think its weird ;-)

As far as Ive seen (and Ive built several sites with Joomla), most 
templates don't include much code and usually just call a function to have 
Joomla drop a component in a page. For menus this is the menu component.

So the real question is whether the menu component in Joomla always pulls 
data from the same table. Im inclined to say yes, based on the fact that 
the database schema doesn't change very much and the menu component is a 
standard part of Joomla.

Depends on what line of work you are in.  We are not really in the 
website business, we are in the software business, it just so happens 
that these days we deploy our software in browser-based setups, so we 
need stuff that looks good.

The particular templates i'm using seem to ignore the menu component and 
build their own, by pulling out of the database.

I would assume that all Joomla templates somehow pull from the same 
table (why else use Joomla, right?), but assumptions can sometimes get 
you into trouble, that's why I ask.

Heh. I don't use AJAX anymore.

1) XML is so bloated and slow compared to JSON. Just because Java
likes it doesn't mean other languages do.

2) The whole Asynchronous XMLHttpRequest thing breaks the web paradigm
and accessibility in interesting ways. I'll take form submission to a
hidden iframe any day.

Maybe it's time to stand up for DHTML again. AJAX is like Flash, it's
pretty but it breaks shit. DHTML still works the way it always has, we
just happen to understand it better now.

Ken, I think we need to give you an award for taking mashups to the next level.

Seriously, this kind of cross-modularization is really impressive.

Thanks.

Sometime today or over the weekend we are going to put the joomla-fied 
Andromeda up for our demo medical manager site, I'll let you know when 
it is there to see.

I do beg to differ regarding the use Asynchronous XMLHttpRequest. Sure,
it's just a speed-up thing, and when I get my spanking new 10GigE fibre
link and SiCoretex SC5832 5,832 processor system (seriously, check out
their web site), I'll live with page re-draws. But until then, judicious
use makes sense. Although we have probably all experienced poor and
useless implementations that break the back button, among other things.

Unless you are doing something highly dynamic like google maps, I think
a prudent strategy is to start with conventional strategies and only
then layer on Asynchronous XMLHttpRequest where it truly makes sense and
the consequences are fully understood.

Ajax wasn't an acronym last year either:

See if you can find "acronym" or "AJAX" mentioned anywhere.

Methinks you will always do better if you assume limited bandwidth.

One of the best things about XMLHttpRequest is that it frees us from
having to transmit fully-formed HTML pages on each request, which is
great for limited bandwidth. The client asks for just the pieces it
needs.

On the other hand, the bulk of a page's content is often not markup or
textual data, but attached media. You don't need (or want)
XMLHttpRequest for that -- you can dynamically add DOM elements (or
tweak existing src attributes) as required for just-in-time media
delivery.

You guys gotta take a quick look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax and
see just how heavily overloaded "Ajax" is. It looks like the "Greek hero
and legendary king of Salamis who plays an important role in Homer's
Iliad"  might have come before the HttpRequest thing.

One of the best things about XMLHttpRequest is that it frees us from
having to transmit fully-formed HTML pages on each request, which is
great for limited bandwidth. The client asks for just the pieces it
needs.

On the other hand, the bulk of a page's content is often not markup or
textual data, but attached media. You don't need (or want)
XMLHttpRequest for that -- you can dynamically add DOM elements (or
tweak existing src attributes) as required for just-in-time media
delivery.

Ok, this may sound like a stupid question, but bear with me.

First, the quote:

"If you build an intranet application and deploy it inside your 
organisation, your users can request the source code and legally you 
have to give it to them. It?s not likely that they will know that you?re 
running the GPL version of MySQL so that they have the right to request 
it but legally you have to provide the source code upon request."

 From http://www.lamp2lapo.com/

Does this apply to ALL web-based applications (e.g., ones written in 
PHP)? If I write a website in PHP that uses MySQL without a commercial 
license, do I have to share the code?

Help me out here. Am I understanding this correctly?

 From what i can tell on the faq on mysql.com you only have to provide 
the source if you application is redistributed, such as something like 
phpBB or post nuke or something like that where it is distributed and 
setup on other machines.

Message-ID: <4554E762.3060109@fdcx.net>

Gentlemen;

I know its late Fri afternoon - but hopefully before everyone splits for 
the weekend someone can help me close this one?

I am trying to process an entire array referencing all the elements both 
keys and values.  I don't know the current values of the keys and that's 
why I have to "walk" through them.

here's what the array looks like:

$agx=array( 'back_door' => '0',
	'front_door' => '1',
	'side_door'  => '0',
	'garage_door' => '1'
);

I have tried various permutations of the while(list($k,$v... and 
foreach($atx as $v => $k)

and all I get are the numeric indexes of the elements as:

0 = 0
1 = 1
2 = 0
3 = 1

What I NEED to extract for EACH iteration are:
$k = 'back_door', $v = 0
$k = 'front_door', $v = 1
$k = 'side_door' , $v = 0
$k = 'garage_door', $v = 1

In the interest of time, can SOMEONE PLEASE provide some guidance as to 
the best way (code-wise) to accomplish this?

Thanks a million on a nice Friday afternoon.

Only if your application code is open source - the quote talks about 
having to provide *MySQL* source.

The rest sounds like anti-MySQL FUD...

Sounds like misinformation being spread by someone with a blog on
"helping PHP developers migrate from MySQL to Oracle."

No, because you haven't "distributed" anything.  Also, since that site
exists for the purpose of migrating people from MySQL to Oracle, I'm
sure they're trying to introduce a little FUD themselves.

First off IANAL. Generally speaking this is not true unless you license
your application with an Open-Source license that has that provision.
Your application itself can be licensed in any way you want, but if you
distribute it commercially, you will probably have to purchase a
commercial license for PHP and MySQL. You as the author have the sole
copyright to the code (or if your work contract specifies, your company
does) and therefore you (or your company) decide how it is licensed and
ultimately whether or not the source code can be requested. Just because
you use Open-Source software doesn't mean your application has to be,
but by using Open-Source code in your application you do need to adbide
by the associated applications' distribution licensing terms if you plan
to package it in with your application. For instance Oracle makes use of
a lot of Open-Source software in their apps, but you can't get their
source code. Same with Sun.

No, the claim on lamp2lapo.com is false.

GPL licensing requires that if you MODIFY THE SOURCE CODE OF THE
APPLICATION and then REDISTRIBUTE IT, you must provide the source of the
modified application on request.

Thus if you modify how MySQL functions (maybe you've got a better way to
index tables, or something), and then redistribute your improved database
application (you call it "MyBetterSQL"), you must provide the source code
of that application on request.

If you modify how MySQL functions (maybe you've got a better way to index
tables, or something), but DON'T redistribute your improved database
application (you just use it yourself), you need not provide the source
code of that application.

If you merely use MySQL "as is", as 99.9999% of everyone does, you need
 not provide the source code.

You never need to provide the source code of something, such as a PHP
application, that is merely built adjacent to MySQL rather than being
intricately linked with it.

Paying for MySQL's commercial license allows one to modify MySQL and
distribute applications that are intricately bound together with it, and
not distribute the altered source code.

Lamp2lapo.com is lying (and I do say lying, rather than mistaken, because
anyone speaking "authoritatively" about GPL licensing certainly knows the
rules by 2006).

GPL is a distribution license.  If you don't distribute the code (e.g. the
output is delivered via the web) then you're kewl.  If you incorporate the
mysql client in your code, and then distribute your code - guess what, it's
under GPL too.  Now, if that bothers you, MySQL would be happy to sell you
their software under their proprietary license.  Pretty kewl marketing idea,
huh?

Excellent responses from all of you. Thanks for clearing it up.

Micheal -  your response is exactly what I *thought* might be the case.

for your array $atx,

foreach ($agx as $key => $value) {
	echo "$key is set to $value\n";
}

will give you the output:

back_door is set to 0
front_door is set to 1
side_door is set to 0
garage_door is set to 1

Note that in your example foreach $v is in the key position & $k is in
the value, but that's probably a typo in your email & not your code.

Since you "don't know the current values of the keys", are you sure
that the keys of the $atx array are set as you suspect? Try a
print_r($atx) and see what you are starting with.

I'm confused. Are you saying that Asynchronous Javascript + XML

I wasn't addressing whether it would count, but whether it is, and it
isn't. Does PERL count as an acronym for Practical Extraction and Report
Language? :-)

You know the credit goes to the Joomla team for creating a de-facto 
standard for providing an HTML template that calls out to well-defined 
functions.  If you can intercept and redirect the functions, your 
framework can use Joomla templates.

All we did was implement simple methods like mosCountModules() and 
mosLoadModules(), redirecting them to Andromeda functions.  Most of them 
to tell the truth get discarded, we don't need the full complexity of 9 
user module areas, top, debug, etc.

One of our simplest is this:

function mosMainBody() {
  ehStandardContent();  // Call the similar Andromeda function
}

Yup, I tried this very early on, and it works very well.  It was 2 years 
ago I did it and it turned out to be kind of cart-before-the-horse 
stuff, I had to get things straightened out on the DB first.

Now I'm once again considering it.

As far as I know, there is not any licensing term that gives right to user to 
request owner of the software to provide it's source code. Because user is 
using service generated out of that software and not the software itself.

Moreover until something is under your domain/control, (i.e. no matter how 
much amount of deployment you make of your software under your control all 
over the world) you are not bound to provide any kind of source code of your 
software to anyone.

Licensing terms comes into consideration only when you THINK about 
re-distribution, selling etc. of your software, which is made of one or more 
open-source softwares. Correct me I am wrong anywhere.

You don't have to use AJAX. You can use .NET objects, JAVA beans, python,
whatever.

It isn't about who is using it, it is about why are we using it.

It isn't about the type of technology, it is about the technique and
delivering benefits 
to the end user. 

It is about positioning your programming product out in front, ahead of the
user needs 
and not behind them. Lead the user to what is better, faster, simpler -- for
them the user. 

Essentially, I think you would agree, that in a truly altruistic world, 
programmers would simply be expected to come up with the innovations -- that

is the programmer's job capacity -- and said innovations ripple out to the
users --  
the users who cannot even know the impending innovation, cannot even know to
want the 
innovation ahead of the invention. 

Breakthrough techniques in usability, design and process are pushed out to
the user 
by knowledgeable creators who can do it. 

So choose your model, but the wave is definitely there -- and this is a
commercial, sellable wave 
that promises to keep programmer's in work for ten more years -- fat
real-time desktop performance style 
is anticipated from thin distributed server products. 

The time and money saving, one-time build it, we can one-time update it
concept that eliminates 
redundancy and reduces error or contrary input is what moving apps to the
internet was always 
all about. 

I'm an insurance agent settling a claim right at the rainy roadside incident
-- as this type of end user 
who is under pressure I'd rather:
A) have a seven-page, multi-load and reload, seven submit clicks form input
process, or
B) a single page, multi-tabbed, single submit form that is intelligently
pulling down all the new 
data I need (working for me, working with me, pushing me ahead) every time I
update an input box.

I am a harried traveler on a hotel site while I am transferring planes at an
airport with only a 
few minutes to make a pick, I'd rather;
A) enter some details on page one, a few more details on page two, submit
all details, watch dream-inspiring  
animation, get back 137 pages (137 pages of 25 entries to a page!!!!
$%*&^@!!) of results and click abjectly  
through lethargic pages with spongy buttons, or
B) enter my info on a tabbed panel on the left side and watch results appear
in what feels a whole lot like 
real time on the right side in handy readable clumps of six entries.

The old business story, of course, is that no one knew they wanted the speed
and potential of 
Federal Express style, overnight delivery until the technique was created
and put in front of the 
customer. 

There just is no denying the overwhelming success of the centralized app
over the internet.

Every single day I hear: can we google that, will you mapquest that for me,
can't you just go 
online and get pictures, let's email them and see what they say, let's buy
those tickets online now... 

All of these remarks are about living, buying, researching, communicating
and working on, thru and 
by the internet -- right now. Now. This instant, in real time, from anywhere
I want. And I want it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] So who's using Ajax anway?


Just curious as to who has gotten into Ajax.  Would you say you are in 
light? Deep?  Use it for nothing? Everything?

I'll toss in my answer to get us started.  Andromeda was written first 
as a non-Ajax framework, so we had to add it in later.  We've got a 
small library that works very well on the browser, and are currently 
developing the server-side library of common routines.  We've used it 
for our report writer, and think it is very cool.

Generally we've moved over to doing all custom screens in AJAX, while 
the "for-free" screens that Andromeda generates are still old-school.

I've noticed a curious fact about using Ajax, it tends to enforce a very 
clean structure for your HTML, and also for the corresponding 
server-side routines.  It is one of those immediate gratification things 
where the increased attention to structure pays off as an immediate and 
visible improvement in the UI.

Thanks Jeff (and the others)...

I believe the above is what I needed.  Regarding whether or not the 
array actually contains what I expected... YES - I used print_r to 
verify and it does.

Sometimes is the seemingly simple stuff that gets the most confusing.

Hey guys,

I found something today that was rather interesting and i would like to feed
my brain and figure out how to do something like this

http://webdesignbook.net/snapper.php?url=http://www.josephcrawford.com&full

you can change the url in the querystring and it will take a live screenshot
of the page.

Any direction on what i should research would be great.  obviously i would
have to use image manipulation, but i am not sure how the screen would be
captured.

Message-ID: <6.2.3.4.2.20061111105849.0282ef50@mail.optonline.net>

I have run into a problem with the $_FILES global and reloading a 
form when the user has omitted required information. Reloading the 
$_POST variables is no problem. But the form among other things 
offers the user a chance to upload a photo, and it is reloading that 
$_FILE information where I'm not succeeding. The relevant code is this:

<input name="photo1" type="file" class="style1" value="<?= 
$_FILES['photo1']['name'] ?>" />

print_r( $_FILES ) shows that $_FILES['photo1']['name'] exists, but 
it's not being shown in the input field.  What am I doing wrong?

Further than that, the name that exists is not fully qualified, so 
even if it were being displayed, I presume it wouldn't do any good 
upon the eventual successful submission of the form. How can I solve that?

By the way, it all works perfectly when the form doesn't need to be reloaded.

Hi,

    my guess is that one cannot easily pass back a file name to a form, 
mainly because the file input element doesn't let one do anything at 
all. It is a pure client side only controlled user interface element.

    I can think of two ways assuming that the file itself is OK, just 
some other info isn't.

a) secure the uploaded file and don't show the file input element at all 
on a reload
b) show an empty file input element and display a note that the user 
doesn't have to browse for the file again
c) instead of showing a file input element show a text box and a 
customer button that says "Browse...", but is disabled - sort of faking 
the looks of a disabled file input element

I faced the same problem not too long ago and chose a). There isn't any 
reason to show the file name again or have the user select a file again 
(and possibly select a wrong file this time as the user may think that 
is the source of the problem). I am sure that the problem is simply the 
dumb file input element that doesn't let you do anything. You can't even 
set the file types to be allowed.

I found the path of least resistance to be Paul Hammond's webkit2png,
but it's a Macintosh solution. It uses WebKit to render the page and
then takes a screenshot.
http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/

There are links on that page to two Linux-friendly solutions.

There are a lot of limits on what you can do with file controls. Think
about how nasty things could be if you could preload an arbitrary file
name into a file control like you're trying to do... <input
type="file" name="upload" value="/etc/passwd" style="visibility:
hidden;"> could be used on a seemingly-innocent form to compromise
your system.

David's suggestion about hanging onto the file temporarily (storing
the file name in a session key, for instance) and presenting the form
with the file input replaced by a message is probably the best way to
handle this.

Telnet, WinSCP, putty and Windows Remote Desktop? 
Will these work through these service interfaces?
 
Any other tried true solutions?

Thank you, but picking out specifically the item:
- Starbucks monthly wifi pass.

While using Starbucks wifi, can one accomplish any of these steps:
1) Kick open an SSH or FTP client like Filezilla or WS_FTP or WinSCP 
and then transfer files to and fro, from laptop to web site? 
2) Telnet from laptop to a server? 
3) Do a Windows Remote desktop Connection to your own 
web site server and then FTP from there to another web site?

Will these strategies work on a commercially moderated 
wifi subscription internet?

Peter

Kind of a cute idea -- but what a massive infrastructure. Sadly, there 
doesn't seem to be an fopen-wrappers compatible GD image function called 
'getwebpageandrenderaspngjustlikethelatestversionofIEorFFwould()' (grin).

I'll bet PHP-Windows people could do this sort of thing quasi-natively, 
all on the server side, by slaving a local copy of IE under control of a 
thin ActiveX component. But I'll bet FF on Linux can't be controlled 
(read: 'subverted') in an analogous way -- to look where you tell it to 
look, and capture a screenshot to the local file system.

But I'll bet a Linux PHP user could approximate the same effect (with 
better security) by downloading an ActiveX screen capture component to a 
client PC under IE, then using AJAX (or simpler asynch techniques) to let 
the PHP server drive the client browser around the web, making it look at 
and capture URLs in iframes, and upload the resulting image files. To keep 
from hitting cross-domain security roadblocks, you'd probably have to 
proxy the client's outbound accesses across your server.

Peter,

The T-Mobile service that Starbucks uses does not filter your internet
connection so you pretty much have full unfettered access to do what you
need to do. Speed is equivalent to a Cable Modem connection.

Recently while I was in California and Mexico, I was able to maintain our
Windows (RDP), Macintosh (SSH) and Sun servers (VNC over VPN), FTP photos to
my web site, VPN into work and mount Xinet FPO volumes and do some pre-press
work and more.

Frankly I'd be happy if could work from the road like that all the time. Too
bad nobody pays enough for web development to make that happen, not when
they can hire the local college kids at $10 - $15 bucks an hour instead.

Cheers,

Michael,

An approach I use which would eliminate this issue would be to use
JavaScript and do error checking as the user is still filling out the form.
The way I see it is, why make the user wait until s/he has filled out the
entire form and submitted it before telling them they made an error? Make
use of the event handlers and when they "change focus" or click on another
form field, fire off a JavaScript that checks the previous field for errors
and pop-up a dialog box that lets them know they made an error on the
previous field. A site that gives some good recommendations is here:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~sbpoley/webmatters/formval.html

As others have stated, saving the upload file to a temp file on the server
is also a possibility, but I've also in the past returned the form all
filled out with the previously submitted data (read only), with the field in
error highlighted and a message that the user will need to re-upload the
file(s). YMMV.

Cheers,

Hi,

    this requires that one has to do tests both on the client and the 
server (can't just not do the server side checks!). I don't really see 
why this extra effort is that much better. The task is to upload an 
image file with some extra info, so the burden on uploading first and 
then checking doesn't strike me as that huge as that one wants to 
prevent submitting the form before all input is checked. And pop-ups are 
often blocked, a small mistake that a user may even notice upon 
reviewing the input before clicking submit throws an error....I don't 
know. I don't say that this isn't a working approach, but users got 
accustomed to getting a consolidated error report with a chance to 
correct the wrong entries after submitting the form the first time.

    I like the highlight idea, but I don't see any reason to make a user 
re-upload the file when there is nothing wrong with the file. Contrary 
to fixing some text in a box, uploading a file again requires to open 
the browse box, select the file again, and click OK or do some other 
action to submit the file selection. That may not be that bad as long as 
there are only a few files in the source location, but if I'd have to 
find PDRM1066.jpg in a folder that has several hundred image files just 
because I forgot to enter a mandatory name I'd get mad really quickly. 
The server got the file already and this is just make work for the user. 
Not that this is a huge issue, but the traffic generated is much higher 
as there is a bigger form page to load with all the JavaScript in it and 
one has to upload the image again for any unrelated input error.

    I found sessions and session IDs to be very helpful. I can create a 
temp folder using the session ID that is by design unique to each 
client. Upon completion of the submission I move the interim file to its 
final location and ditch the session ID temp folder. You need to add 
some housekeeping that cleans up leftovers from aborted submissions. 
That is fairly easy when the user guidance allows for going back to a 
main menu, which is a good spot to clean up any temp files for the 
current session. Same applies on logout. Leaves only the case where the 
user is nasty and simply closes the browser. I haven't found an optimal 
solution for that, but did OK by saving the session ID in a db table 
upon login and check if a temp folder with that name exists when that 
user logs in the next time. That limits the worst case to those 
situations where a user aborts a submission and does not log in again 
for quite some time or never. Those cases can be handled by pulling in 
all temp folders and looking at their creation dates and dump all those 
with any file(s) inside that are older than the maximum expiration time 
set for a cookie/session (I think the default in PHP is three hours). It 
may then still be that the user is currently logged in, but that 
shouldn't matter as any access to that temp folder should first check if 
that folder exists and if not creates it or does something else that is 
applicable.

    Quite a bit of effort for something really stupid, but computers are 
just that. :/

       So, now that I gave this speech I better get to practicing what I 
preach, LOL.

You don't really need to take anybody's word for it Peter. You can get a 24
hour pass for $9.99 (or pay $6 for an hour) and check it out for yourself
before deciding on one of the subscription models:
http://preview.tinyurl.com/yeedoe

It has been my experience on the road that all of the hotel and free
internet services haven't blocked the ssh/sftp ports, and on a wireless
connection you should probably avoid the telnet/ftp services anyway.

And, welcome to the gulf Mr. Sawczynec. Snow is for suckers.

    It depends on the context,  but file uploads can take a ~long~ time.

    I used to work on a site that took document uploads from an 
international audience.  One day other people on the team noticed that 
we had http connections running for an hour or longer,  and they thought 
that there was something wrong with our system.

    I did some investigation,  and discovered that people were uploading 
multi-megabyte files over dialup connections from places like India.  It 
turned out the long connections were because of slow uploads,  not 
because of anything wrong with our system.

    This is an extreme case,  but it's not unusual for file uploads to 
take 30 seconds or more -- it's pretty frustrating to have to wait 30 
seconds to know that you did something wrong.

    I'm not a fan of client-side validation in Javascript,  since it 
often is done in a slapdash way,  but it helps a lot with forms that 
involve big uploads.

Thanks. T-Mobile Hot Spot tech support could not 
answer this question with assurance. Meanwhile, likely 
my first 5 weeks, at least, I will have broadband at 
temp condo lease in Clearwater (five min beacPhP)   
where the initial well-abstracted plan is to 
keep working, but robust failover contingency plans 
are locked in place.

Peter,

The T-Mobile service that Starbucks uses does not filter your internet
connection so you pretty much have full unfettered access to do what you
need to do. Speed is equivalent to a Cable Modem connection.

Recently while I was in California and Mexico, I was able to maintain our
Windows (RDP), Macintosh (SSH) and Sun servers (VNC over VPN), FTP photos to
my web site, VPN into work and mount Xinet FPO volumes and do some pre-press
work and more.

Frankly I'd be happy if could work from the road like that all the time. Too
bad nobody pays enough for web development to make that happen, not when
they can hire the local college kids at $10 - $15 bucks an hour instead.

Cheers,

Jeff: I planned only to lease where broadband was avail, but just in case 
I was sounding out last ditch contingency internet access options. 
Thanks for the break out. Peter

You don't really need to take anybody's word for it Peter. You can get a 24
hour pass for $9.99 (or pay $6 for an hour) and check it out for yourself
before deciding on one of the subscription models:

It has been my experience on the road that all of the hotel and free
internet services haven't blocked the ssh/sftp ports, and on a wireless
connection you should probably avoid the telnet/ftp services anyway.

And, welcome to the gulf Mr. Sawczynec. Snow is for suckers.

For the love of god, man, please don't telnet to anywhere using a wifi
connection.

Space aliens will be able to intercept your password years from now
when the radio signals reach their galaxies, and then they'll 0wn you.
And by extension, us. The survival of humanity in the future depends
on your use of ssh, today.

I am sooooooooo sorry about that, Chris. 
As Bill Clinton and George Bush have been made to 
concede to a past dark secret publicly, I will state that 
one time four laptops ago I used a telnet 
client on Windows 2000 to log onto a server once 
as proof of concept. But, yes, for at least 7 years 
I have used the tiny, handy 'putty' client for Windows to 
SSH to any *NIX servers I may admin in any way. And 
I use Remote Desktop Connection for WIN servers. 

But your call out is deserved and well expressed, I will 
do time out in the thinking corner for that slip.

Peter

Well actually I moved out of Manhattan to upstate NY where for $15 an
hour you can live like a king.

My rent is 10% of a similar place in Manhattan (a renovated studio,
all utilities, with a view of the river).  My wifi rocks, food is a
minimum of 50% less then NYC, and since there are 5 colleges here
(Potsdam),  culture galore. I live above an internet cafe, next to a
head shop, which is next to 2 music stores, next to the bagel shop and
Cafe. Summer rents drop to about a 1/3, so for all practical purposes,
it's cheaper to live here then Bangalore.  And for nature?  It's very
hard to top the Adirondacks. (ummm, movies prices?  how about $3.50?)

I'm reading in the local paper we now have French, Indian, and
Jamaican restaurant coming to down.  Sushi on the horizon.

I told a local that I was paying $295 a month for my studio, and he
was "are you CRAZY!", I was like, I know it's a great deal.  He was
"WHAT?", that's crazy, $200 is the max here.  and so it goes!

So that means you'll work for less than $15 an hour? You're hired, as
long as you aren't spending too much time in that head shop.

Hi All,

A short report to follow up on the earlier discussion:  actual code for 
this project has been posted at sourceforge.  I had proof-of-concept 
code several days ago but made the mistake of trying to put in lots of 
"nice" features before releasing it.  Not smart.  This morning I decided 
just to get something that works and post it.  Actually feels pretty good.

The current implementation uses no database in the back-end, just a 
config file to record the order of the slides, and another file to 
record which slide is current.  The viewer interface uses AJAX to poll 
for the current slide every 2 seconds. Very barebones at this point, but 
very capable in its stated purpose.

Demo: http://slides.sourceforge.net/blog/?page_id=9
Download: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=181580

Thanks to the list for hashing out a few ideas up to this point. Thought 
I should let you know it's progressed into actual released code.  Won't 
be bothering you with more details hereafter.

Thanks,
Allen

Message-ID: <01e101c70812$eb823100$021919ac@D2Y4NP61>

Hello Everyone,

I wrote an application in PHP to export all of the data into a CSV document
so my client can view the data.  Everything works great except the Zip Code
fields.  For the zip codes that start with a zero, the zero is removed.  

I know this is done by Excel because it is treating the contents of the cell
as a number.  

Is there any way to tell excel to treat the content of the cell as text
automatically?

Thank you in advance for your insights.

Sincerely,
Nelly Yusupova

Put a single quote in front of the value.  This value:

'01234

will be seen by Excel as the text string "01234" rather than the numeric 
value 1234.

(Another solution: the user can also, when importing into Excel, set that 
field as "Text" rather than "General".)

It can have great prices, fast machines with tons of disk space, 
wonderful customer service and be totally Linux friendly, but if they 
are down 40 minutes or so at random times it isn't acceptable to an 
online catalog web site. While a promise of an uptime of 99% sounds 
near perfect, 1% downtime can be a lot especially when its at peak 
times. I might be expecting too much, and it might cost too much, but I 
thought I would post and see if anyone has recommendations and 
solutions for web hosting services that have better than what I have 
described in uptimes.

Thanks in advance,

For *nix systems there is this:

I can't vouch for it as I have never used it, but seems like a good 
start if not a solution...

A better solution is to use Firefox:

1. Run Xvfb instead of a real X server so that you don't need to attach to a monitor.
2. Run firefox supplying the URL as a command-line parm.
3. Run xwininfo to find the proper root window.
4. Run import from imagemagick to get an image of that window.

Piece of cake ;)

It's actually a little PITA to get working, but it makes for a reasonable 
server/unattended solution.  Works best in Perl, but you could accept the request in PHP, 
pass it on to the Perl script, and wait asynchronously for the results.  Usually you 
display a dummy image saying "we're working on this" when the first request for a given 
URL comes in, then the real thing once it's available.  A little PHP script could be used 
in the <img> tag, essentially as a "404" handler.

Did any of this make sense?

As no one else seemed to, I'll mention server firewall rules as a 
possible impediment. While Starbucks (or whoever) may not filter your 
traffic, lots of  servers will have a restriction on which IPs (and 
sometimes even MAC addresses) can even connect to them...just something 
to think about.

I was always happy with Pair Networks uptime.  I think maybe there was a 
couple minutes of downtime that I noticed once in the 5 years I've had a 
shared hosting account with them.  Here's their statement: "Our network 
is monitored and maintained 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Our 
server and network uptime is well in excess of 99.9%. Your data is 
backed up daily to ensure full recovery in the event of a disaster. Our 
entire facility is protected by multi-stage security, FM-200 fire 
suppression systems, Powerware battery backup systems, and a 750,000 
watt diesel generator that can run indefinitely. Your data is always 
safe with pair Networks."

However, I recently switched to Empowering Media because I liked the 
10for10 developer hosting account that they offer.  Fits what I 
personally need more than the Pair accounts.  They claim 99.5% uptime 
for their shared accounts.  I haven't been on the shared account long 
enough to say from experience... but I know that they're good people 
over there from having worked with them on other managed servers for my 
company.  The only way to ensure absolute 100% uptime would be to spring 
for some kind of managed hosting where you have servers in multiple data 
centers.  Empowering Media can do this and I'm sure there are many other 
hosting providers that do the same thing... but I'm pretty sure that 
would cost a lot more than you're looking to spend.

One simple way around that is to use a server you own as a bastion host,
and connect from there.

If you wanted you could also set up a vpn from your mobile workstation
to the bastion host, which would have the added advantage of encrypting
all your traffic.

It can have great prices, fast machines with tons of disk space, 
wonderful customer service and be totally Linux friendly, but if they 
are down 40 minutes or so at random times it isn't acceptable to an 
online catalog web site. While a promise of an uptime of 99% sounds 
near perfect, 1% downtime can be a lot especially when its at peak 
times. I might be expecting too much, and it might cost too much, but I 
thought I would post and see if anyone has recommendations and 
solutions for web hosting services that have better than what I have 
described in uptimes.

Thanks in advance,

if you want fast stable machines i would suggest rackspace, although they
are not the cheapest around they have excellent support and service

I second the Rackspace recommendation. They are really on top of support 
services (they advertise as "fanatical support") and I've never had any 
complaints with them.

Hi,

I host my own server and since CL&P is still running the same grid as 
Edison himself put it in, power is on and off quite a bit. I bought to 
UPS to compensate for that.
If you don't want to bother with self-hosting, look at places in Western 
Europe (e. g. Germany). Power is far more reliable there than anywhere 
in the US (OK, except for the goof-up from E.ON recently), host 
providers have backup systems, and infrastructure is about as good as it 
is here (if not even better), and pricing may even be better when you 
look at technology havens such as Ireland.

Just my 2 ?...

...and then look right at the next provider. We have from work a web 
server hosted by interland and while the physical box may not be down, 
the system is often and gets intentionally rebooted at least 4 or 5 
times a month. And that ain't patch tuesday or sth like that.

    I also work with a server hosted by ACS in Dallas, TX and I never 
had a problem, but cannot say anything about uptimes. It is just for a 
small suppport site that doesn't cause too many complaints when it is 
down on a saturday night.

You have to make sure the zip code data is imported to Excel as text. By
default Excel will treat is as a number and will therefore drop any leading
zeroes.

Hope this helps ...

Hello Everyone,

I wrote an application in PHP to export all of the data into a CSV document
so my client can view the data.  Everything works great except the Zip Code
fields.  For the zip codes that start with a zero, the zero is removed.  

I know this is done by Excel because it is treating the contents of the cell
as a number.  

Is there any way to tell excel to treat the content of the cell as text
automatically?

Thank you in advance for your insights.

Sincerely,

I just reread your question. Yes, in an Excel cell you can put a single

if that works in a CSV file.

Sorry for any confusion.

so my client can view the data.  Everything works great except the Zip Code
fields.  For the zip codes that start with a zero, the zero is removed.  

I know this is done by Excel because it is treating the contents of the cell
as a number.  

Is there any way to tell excel to treat the content of the cell as text
automatically?

Thank you in advance for your insights.

Sincerely,
Nelly Yusupova

it will work when displaying a CSV file in excel, but now the data has a 
single quote in it.

Hi Nelly,

Have you looked into PEAR's Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer? I haven't used  
it myself, but perhaps you can have more control over cell types if  
you generate a native excel file rather than a csv file.

Deja vu all over again (-:  Yes, it works good.

Though I found that if I used writeRow() with a row of data right out of a
db table (with stuff like lastname, firstname, ..., zipcode), I had
exactly the same issue you're trying to solve, i.e., the zips were treated
as numeric types. I had to use writeString() to make it a string. It was
little clumsy but it worked.

I just went through this with a customer.  Here is the rehash.

My experience:

Rackspace: triple the cost.  What do you get?  Very knowledgeable tech 
support available w/in 5 minutes 24/7/365.  They claim 100% network 
uptime through multiple redundancy.  I've run one server with them.  My 
customer paid $500/month and they did everything we asked.  A little 
beauracratic when you first get started.  They do Red Hat, but no 
gentoo.  However, and this is HUGE, they offered absolutely no 
guarantees about repair time in the event of catastrophe such as loss of 
hard drive or CPU blowing out (it happens, and always at the worst 
moment).  This struck me as extremely odd.  I went around with them on 
this several times asking the question many times and the answer was the 
same, if the machine goes down due to hardware failure we make no promises.

Sevenl.net.  Lowest price.  What do you get?  A machine up and running 
in 24 hours. They had intermittent network outages when I first started, 
nearly 3 outages of up to 10 minutes.   They also had a neighborhood 
power failure during business hours last month and were down for several 
hours.  These systems are suitable as failover servers, because it is 
reasonable to expect them to be up for the few hours you may need one if 
the main server goes down.   I've had one for a year, and have just 
leased a new one on behalf of a customer.  And they install gentoo 
linux, the coolest distribution ever.

ServerPronto.com.  Same basic services as SevenL.net, except the machine 
was running a few hours after they charged my credit card, instead of 24 
hours.  I've had exactly one incident of downtime for about 3 hours one 
evening in the one year that I've had one of their servers.  They do gentoo.

Bottom line: If you want guaranteed million-percent uptime, you will 
have to go with two servers, one as a failover if the main one goes down 
(remember Rackspace is only perfect until the first time they aren't, 
and on that day you'll be in the hotseat explaining, "well gosh, I mean, 
it's never happened before.  Failover server?  Well, no, we didn't, 
because Rackspace is so expensive and they never have problems...."). 

So my customer and I figured we could go with Rackspace at 400/month + 
SevenL.net at 100, or, since we were going the failover route, take the 
ServerPronto at 150/month and the failover on SevenL at 100.

If you do the failover route, its a good idea to pick systems very far 
away from each other and owned by different people.  I do the SevenL + 
ServerPronto because one is in Florida (hurricanes) and the other is in 
Canada (icebergs).  I figure the chance of both going down by natural 
disaster or mismanagement is pretty small.

Using Softlayer for my customers and for myself almost a year now.
They have 99.9% uptime SLA. There are 1~10 minutes of scheduled
maintenance down times in every 3-4 months. Most of them takes less than
5 minutes.
Network is amazing, staff is professional and prices are cheap. You can
get a pretty powerful box well under $200/mo
*however* they are UNMANAGED.  *but* they have a very good paid support
system. They will fix/install/update anything you want, for only $3 per
ticket. And they do it in minutes.

b) If yes, do you find availability very high? 
 
c) Download/upload speeds satisfactory?
 
Any of your experience(s)/insight(s) would be invaluable.

For people struggling with the same problem, I managed to do it like Jon
suggested.
I can say that Cake is a very flexible and easy to use framework.
Thanks for your help!

I am working on writing the code (with PHP LDAP functions) to insert
records into a directory. I  have been working for about five hours
now, trying to insert a new organization, but to no avail. I continue
to get an error (65) from this block of code, and I cannot figure out
why. Any ideas?

	function addOrganization(){

I'm originally from Tennessee. Where I lived, broadband was unavailable. 
Dialup was painfully slow, so I ended up using Verizon's wireless 
network as my primary connection (while at home). I have found it to be 
great to use, but I've also heard some horror stories about 
nightmarishly large cell phone bills (they advertise it as "unlimited", 
but it's not - I think 5GB is the magic number).

The connection was slower in the country (but faster than dialup, 
generally speaking) but in medium to large cities it was lightning fast 
on an available EVDO connection.

Even in the countryside I was able to (telnet|ssh|ftp) without any real 
issues.

I wouldn't recommend it for constantly-on connections, but for basic 
administration, ssh, vnc, what-have-you, it works in a pinch.

By the way, I learned the hard way it's cheaper to get access through a 
PC card (60/month) than a cell phone (80/month).

Hey Folks,

I'd like to offer my (brief, I promise) opinion on this having been on
both sides of the fence (offering and evaluating an SLA).  I also want
to note that I am coming into the middle of this thread, so I may have
missed the initial requirements.

We all want 100% uptime, which as Ken said, is only good until the
first time they are down.  Really, what you want is someone who
promises a respectable uptime and has a process in place to make it
happen.

What about an SLA?  Well, my experience has been that SLA's really
amount to "well, if we're down and you complain, we'll refund you your
money for the month (or period of time)."  No SLA that I have ever
seen reads, "If we're down, show us how much you lost in revenue
(e-commerce site) and/or lost productivity (mega-corporation) in that
time and we'll cut you a check immediately".

I admit it has been a few years so it totally possible that this has
changed, but I doubt it.

Message-ID: <7CFD545A-BFC1-4D4C-8A16-2FFD33989965@gubavision.com>

I have the start of a zipcode radius locator.  It seems to work but  
the problem I am having is creating an error statement if no  
locations are found.  At first it made sense to check for retuned  
zipcode values.  The problem being one zipcode will always be  
returned the one that is used for the search.  So my thinking would  
be to uses the retuned query that actually looks for the locations :  
$sql_events = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM area36 WHERE zipcode  
='$key'") or die (mysql_error());  .  However anything I try seems to  
loop and create ugly things.

I am a rank beginner far better photographer than coder so talk  
simple.  My brain is also a little tired after seeing Ziggy Marley  
last night as you might expect, so I apologize up front for my  
sluggish brain.

You want to use mysql_num_rows - 
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-num-rows.php - after your 
query.  You can then do an if statement to check if mysql_num_rows != 0 
before doing the while loop:

$sql_events = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM area36 WHERE zipcode  
='$key'") or die (mysql_error());
if (mysql_num_rows() !== 0)
{
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($sql_events)) {
    // stuff in here
  }
}
else
{
  // error - no records found
}

Hey Brian,

HOPE is great. I went in both 04 and 06. I've been reading 2006 since '97.

I feel the technical level hasn't kept pace with my own expertise as I've 
aged, but its a refreshing read.

I recently stumbled on a new magazine at B&N, 'haking', a European 
publication.
Very technical with source code included on CD. Cool magazine!

My  correction snippet based on that here:

{
$sql_events = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM area36 WHERE zipcode  
='$key'") or die (mysql_error());
if (mysql_num_rows($sql_events) !== 0)
{
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($sql_events)) {
	$dist = $row['dist'];
     $day = $row['day'];
     $town = $row['town'];
	$time = $row['time'];
	$place = $row['place'];
	$street = $row['street'];
	$type = $row['type'];
	$Special = $row['Special'];
	$hca = $row['hca'];
	$ns = $row['ns'];

     //row count for alternating colors

     $row_color = ($row_count % 2) ? $color1 : $color2;

     //create tables for data row loop

     echo "<tr>
	<td class='$row_color'>$dist</td>
     <td class='$row_color'>$day</td>
     <td class='$row_color'>$town</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$time</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$place</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$street</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$type</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$Special</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$hca</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$ns</a></td>
     </tr>";

     // Add 1 to the row count

     $row_count++;
}
}
// error statement if no locations are found within search radius
else {
echo 'Sorry, your search returned no locations.  Try using a larger  
radius to search.';
}



Returns the error statement each time there is an x amount positive  
result.  This was the exact problem I was having.  So what I get is  
the error repeated x amount of  times than my table is built with the  
actual results.  What am I missing?

Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check that out. Does any B&N carry 
'haking' or is there a particular location I need to look for it?

Hearing good things about Media Temples new 'Grid Server'.  From what 
they are advertising the grid system should balance sites across all 
servers instead of clustering with the possibility of no downtimes.

Sorry... I looked at it a little too quickly...  You need to put your if 
statement outside the foreach.  That was the issue.

$zips = $z->get_zips_in_range('07732', '10', _ZIPS_SORT_BY_DISTANCE_ASC, true);
if(isset($zips) && count($key) > 0)
//find all locations within range using returned zipcode values
{
  foreach ($zips as $key => $value)
  {
    $sql_events = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM area36 WHERE zipcode  
    ='$key'") or die (mysql_error());
    while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($sql_events)) {
      // process rows
    }
  }
}
// error statement if no locations are found within search radius
else {
  echo 'Sorry, your search returned no locations.  Try using a larger  
  radius to search.';

The B&N on Madison Ave and 46th street (Midtown)  has it tucked in the 
computer magazine section.  I know the B&N back home in Ohio doesn't 
carry it.  So probably isn't in all the B&Ns

Wow, MT's grid server is incredibly interesting.  Been using MT for years
with few to no complaints on any level.  Anyone have experience with the new
service?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] http post request relative links
Message-ID: <c11f47240611161038o2858f708vb733dc7673d221b0@mail.gmail.com>

I'm making a post request to an https site using PEAR HTTP_Client.  The site
redirects me and the redirected page returns a response as a relative link,
and so I end up getting back http://locahost/xxxx rather than
https://[site]/xxxx and so end up with a 404 error.  Does anyone know how I
can get the response back as relative to the site I'm trying to access
instead of relative to my web server?

thanks so much,
   Rob

Message-ID: <491198290611161049r6d31447bud4d871f5eeb2da8a@mail.gmail.com>

I'm retrofitting a simple templating system.  Ends up that I've got PHP in
the output buffer that needs to get executed prior to sending to the
browser.  I'm using the callback function within ob_start command (e.g.
ob_start(runphp);).  Anyone had any experience doing this (or better ideas)?

Thanks,

Mark

The problem with this is that the count is always greater than zero.   
The count($key) will always equal at least one.  The one being the  
orignating zipcode that you searched since even if you searched 1  
mile, you would still have one originating zipcode.  If there is a  
location at that originating zipcode it would also return a location  
query.  Hence my problem.

3tera has a solution that they offer to hosting companies that goes way
beyond this. In fact, MT could even be using it. Check out:

http://www.3tera.com
http://www.thegridlayer.com
http://www.utilityserve.com/

This may be the future, but for whom -- you or the service provider? The
benfit is obviously to the service provider; it the mother of all VPSes.
To the end-user? Awesome, if it works as stated. But remember -- you
still need to think about how "managed" a solution you want.

See:
http://www.utilityserve.com/packages.htm
http://www.thegridlayer.com/products/index.php

The question is, how do you compare this with a dedicated server? Is it
a fair comparison? What would your comfort level be if you were
deploying a mission critical application? I think it rocks, but no
matter how you look at it, you are getting a "slice" of pie instead of
the whole enchilada.

Btw, I just got a quote from Rackspace for $500ish -- don't know about
Fanatical support, but they definitely have a Fanatical sales force. I
wonder if a little guy like me would get lost among their 10,000 other
big customers....

with few to no complaints on any level.  Anyone have experience with the

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Bandwidth modeling -- extending the hosting question
Message-ID: <002501c709b5$645dade0$12a8a8c0@HirschLaptop>

Every service provider asks me, how much RAM do you want? How much
bandwidth do you need?
 
My standard answer is that on the first day, the application will have
one user - me. After that, it's anyone's guess.
 
Any thoughts on ways to estimate bandwidth requirements? Are there any
modeling tools available?
 
Cliff

Gotcha.  Try this:

$zips = $z->get_zips_in_range('07732', '10',  
_ZIPS_SORT_BY_DISTANCE_ASC, true);
$row_count++;
foreach ($zips as $key => $value)
{
  //find all locations within range using returned zipcode values
  $sql_events = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM area36 WHERE zipcode  
    ='$key'") or die (mysql_error());
  while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($sql_events)) {
    $dist = $row['dist'];
    $day = $row['day'];
    $town = $row['town'];
    $time = $row['time'];
    $place = $row['place'];
    $street = $row['street'];
    $type = $row['type'];
    $Special = $row['Special'];
    $hca = $row['hca'];
    $ns = $row['ns'];

    //row count for alternating colors
    $row_color = ($row_count % 2) ? $color1 : $color2;

    //create tables for data row loop
    echo "<tr>
	<td class='$row_color'>$dist</td>
     <td class='$row_color'>$day</td>
     <td class='$row_color'>$town</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$time</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$place</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$street</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$type</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$Special</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$hca</a></td>
	<td class='$row_color'>$ns</a></td>
     </tr>";

     // Add 1 to the row count
     $row_count++;
  }
}
if ($row_count == 0)
// error statement if no locations are found within search radius
{
  echo 'Sorry, your search returned no locations.  Try using a larger  
  radius to search.';
}

Hmm... Did not think that this would be that difficult.  Though I  
know I looked at it for several day before posting here. Sorry for  
all posts.  The last solution did not work either.  There is an if  
statement but no else.  Sorry I am unsure where it would go.  Also  
for some reason the changes prevented the first found zip not to  
display.  As it turns out in this case I know is 07701 and there are  
locations there.  Thanks for all the help so far Rob above and  
beyond.  I think I'll get some coffee going.

Attended them all. Getting a bit crazed now.

The best was '04.  After the RNC came to town and we all got ourselves
arrested.  Emmanuel too.

Yes, 2004 was awesome. Everyone! That's very cool!

Infact I do:

In association with 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, Steven Rambam will finally
deliver his talk entitled, "Privacy is Dead." As you may recall, this was
originally scheduled for the middle of HOPE Number Six but wound up being
cancelled due to the FBI arresting Steve right before he was scheduled to go
on stage. We promised to make it up to our attendees and that's what we're
going to do this week.

This will be a wide-ranging lecture covering databases, privacy, and
"computer-aided investigation." Steven is the owner of PallTech, the largest
privately held online investigative support service in the U.S. This talk
will include numerous examples of actual data and secret databases as well
as a demonstration of an actual online investigation done on a volunteer
subject. Admission is free.

The talk is scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 16th from 6:00-9:00pm at
the Stevens Institute of Technology Babbio Center Room 122 in Hoboken,
which is only a stop away from Manhattan on the PATH train and cheaper
than the subway.

Darn, I'm sorry to have missed that. I would have liked to have been there.

I checked the B&N in Union Square, and they also carry "Haking." I 
balked a little at the $14.99 price tag, though.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Bandwidth modeling -- extending the hosting
	question

Good question, Cliff. In addition to mere uptimes, I'm concerned about 
capacity planning. I don't feel comfortable recommending anything 
without being able to answer the real question of how much can it 
handle. This kind of reminds me of when I had the central air 
conditioner in my home replaced. Some installers would only do a Manual 
J Calculation to determine exactly what was needed, while others 
claimed that by the time they pulled up in the driveway they knew the 
number of tons size unit the home needed. I feel comfortable having a 
formula if one can be applied.

I wonder if anyone has taken servers in a lab environment and did 
benchmarks on it so that there were some sort of guidelines? That way, 
if marketing says "We expect X number of users accessing the web site 
at once..." then a nice formula to plug it into to help us gauge what 
CPU, RAM, bandwidth and number of servers that would be needed would be 
very helpful. This would vary depending on how a user is defined such 
as streaming video or submitting an inquiry form, for example.

As for determining the number of requests per second an Apache 
installation is capable of serving, there is a tool called 'ab' (Apache 
HTTP server benchmarking tool). I have some experience with this tool. 
I connected an older slow box on the LAN, and continued to increase 
traffic until it buckled. Of course, I wasn't able to perform such as 
test with a web hosting service because I'm sure it would be considered 
a Denial of Service attack, which is why I mentioned to do this in a 
lab environment LAN and then with permission to a live target web site.

For the specific web site, a load test tool could simulate X numbers of 
users doing Y activities simultaneously.

I'm thinking to gather all this test data, a package (open sources) 
could be installed on the source and target test machines and the 
results uploaded to a web site which would be a clearing house for the 
data. Anything like what I described (wished for:-) ) exist in open 
sources?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] microframeworks
Message-ID: <455E59FD.7070502@devonianfarm.com>

    Last week somebody asked what framework he should be use for a 
project.  People brought up the usual suspects,  such as CakePHP,  
Symfony,  Andromeda and the Zend Framework.  Yet,  I get the feeling 
that more people are talking about frameworks rather than using them;  
the talk-to-action ratio depends on the framework,  but I think 
frameworks haven't yet "crossed the chasm" to mass adoption.

    The other day I had to get an application started in a hurry.  It's 
doing something useful at < 700 lines,  but I'm considering options that 
could grow it out to about 10 times that.  It depends on a "core 
library" that's < 500 lines.  This library deals with common issues in 
string handling,  parameter handling,  and HTML form generation.

    About 10% of the application,  or 70 lines,  is a microframework 
that's loosely built on Struts.  About 20 of those lines are in 2 
functions which would be generally useful for microframeworks (such as 
file_exists_in_include_path()).  Like Struts,  the microframework 
chooses an "action" based on form parameters:  the action then chooses a 
"view" -- a "view" is basically a template that a designer can edit 
which can be supplemented by an optional "query" which pulls stuff out 
of the database.  Like Ruby-on-Rails,  the microframework uses 
convention instead of configuration:  the dispatcher computes an "action 
name" based on query parameters,  and uses that to compute a 
filename...  It checks that the file exists and executes it with the 
"require method".

    The microframework uses no object-oriented techniques.  That's not 
because I have any antipathy to OO,  but because I didn't need it,  and 
I like writing my actions,  queries,  and views in a style that "feels 
like PHP".

    Yes, my microframework is nowhere near as powerful as CakePHP or 
Symfony.  Yet,  it's more flexible,  because I can codesign it with my 
application.  Because it's so simple,  I can easily adapt it to do what 
I want.  If I decide I really hate it,  I can write a new one in an 
hour.  I'm an expert on it,  because I developed it,  and I wouldn't 
have to take on the technical,  social and emotional burdens of 
"forking" an open-source codebase if I wanted to make a change in direction.

    I'm moving towards a vision of web app architecture where we move 
towards shared vocabulary and standardized interfaces.  Rather than 
working with a "comprehensive framework" that does everything,  I'd like 
to have a "framework construction set" that contains a number of 
elements that I can take or leave.

I've been on a cruise ship sailing the southern Caribbean for the past 
week and half. Prior to leaving, I configured the home network to allow 
ssh into the the servers and VNC to my desktop machine (never know when 
you need emergency access to your desktop!). Wi-Fi and internet cafe 
rates on the ship are expensive at 50 cents/min. Upon boarding, I signed 
on for the $100 "unlimited internet from the cabin" package which 
basically offers a ship compatible telephone with an analog port. 
Connectivity is via dial-up and the max speed is 46.6 kbps. Latency over 
the satellite link, surprisingly, isn't that bad. SSH works fine and 
TightVNC with high compression is usable, despite the low bandwidth. I'm 
able to effectively keep watch and tune my all clients servers remotely 
over ssh or their vpn. Skype ports are blocked on the local network, but 
Net2phone works so I can do voip phone calls for "free" avoiding the 
$7.99/min ship rate. The internet was particularly useful for the rental 
car situation prior to arriving at Curacao. I woke up, browsed the web 
for that to do on the island, then google'd for rental car discount 
codes and reserved the car online 2 hrs prior to arrival. Ended up 
saving about $50 (and the hassles of possibly not having a car). $100 
for 9 days of internet is kind of steep, but it's written off as a 
business expense and the alternative would have probably been much 
worse. I should write up a howto faq on being an IT ocean warrior. And 
now I have figure out how to lose the 10 lbs gained from eating all that 
buffet food!

Message-ID: <b76252690611181203q76eb0fa4t83c7b5955bdfc653@mail.gmail.com>

Ajaxian posted a story yesterday about SWFUpload, which is a
configurable Flash file upload control. Users can upload multiple
files using Ctrl-click. It has progress bars. And you can make the
control like whatever you want. The included test script is PHP.

http://labb.dev.mammon.se/swfupload/

I was especially curious about multiple upload, it turns out that it
just makes sequential calls to the backend script. The backend script
needs to save the file somewhere, and store that location in a
$_SESSION variable, so that in can be matched up with any other files
and the rest of the form submission later.

In a recent thread here we talked about how you should be storing
uploads temporarily anyway (in case there are errors on another part
of the form); this provides even more incentive to do that.

Despite the Flash requirement, this seems like a graceful way to wipe
out a number of file-upload-related annoyances once and for all.

Most of the new features I've added to CakePHP have been extracted  
from Real Applications(tm).  It's also flexible enough to allow you  
to modify or replace the framework's functionality at pretty much any  
point in the process.  The only reason you'd ever want to fork a  
framework project is if it is too inflexible, which Cake is not.

The entire point of having a framework like PHP is so that you  
*don't* have to write your applications from scratch every time.  Not  
only that, but half of the brain-work that goes in to designing your  
application is taken out of the equation, because Cake provides you  
with the best (for most web applications) design patterns from the  
very beginning.

The buzz on frameworks is the precursor to the uptake.

But PHP does have very successful frameworks, those that are suitable to 
origins as a web platform.  Content management systems came first, and 
Joomla has a healthy community around it.  Those were the first PHP 
frameworks, and their focus is, naturally, tightly coupled with the idea 
of PHP as a dynamic content serving tool.

Now PHP is recognized as a powerful general-purpose server language, and 
so the masses of biz app authors are coming over and the frameworks are 
being born.  There will no doubt be more on the horizon, though IMHO 
Andromeda is the only one you need :)

Ain't it always the way :)  and ten times after that, and ten times 
after that....

When I worked in Manhattan I would often have to cut meeting short by 
saying, "Look, the last thing we need now is more good ideas, how about 
we actually code some of this stuff?"

I cannot fault your approach in attacking first the items that are 
important on the first project, I did the same with Andromeda.  Strings, 
parameters and HTML.  Conspicuously absent from the list though is 
rudimentary SQL generalization, have you hit that yet?  Do you have any 
thoughts yet on security?

This is suspicious.  Why is only 10% of the app in the framework? 

For the sake of framing a debate, lets say that if the framework code is 
< 50% of the app, then the framework itself is less mature than the app.

Perhaps this should just be called a library at this point?

Now I must respectfully but firmly insist that this is not a framework.  
Conventions are a requirement for rigorous development, but they don't 
make a strategy any more than buying a computer makes you a programmer.

The danger of this path is death by success.  Conventions work very well 
for 2-4 people, but beyond that they cannot be maintained through 1-1 
communication, and they begin to break down when expediencies demand 
quick results (remember, going from 2 programmers to 5 means you are 
doing well, so now you have those pesky customers with their 
unreasonable demands). One compromise on top of another and sooner or 
later it all collapses.  You can see this coming when people start 
talking about the "next framework" and how it will redeem us all from 
the failures of the first.  When you've seen this go around twice you 
begin to get suspicious that Godot is not coming.

My own experience suggests you are one the right track.  I went through 
the OO mania in the mid 90's and have come out comfortable in leaving OO 
mania to the OO maniacs. 

Consider this: a web transaction is a stateless time-sensitive event.  
By its very nature performance concerns play into every design and 
coding decision.  Any element, such as OO, that adds overhead and 
complexity must prove itself overwhelmingly valuable to gain adoption.  
Since there is nothing that OO does that you cannot do without it, 
better to avoid the false dreams and just stick to writing well-defined 
functions that accept parameters and return values.

Here I will play devil's advocate with two arguments.

One, "it is not as powerful as...." to which I add, "..and therefore not 
as valuable."  Having a small code set is great for maintenance and 
quality, but it is not a goal in itself, it is only a goal if it 
contributes to quality through maintainability.  Having a small body of 
code that does a small body of things is not the goal, by that measure a 
blank page wins.

Andromeda's entire library is less than 10,000 lines.  This very morning 
I finished off the first usable version of our publishing and version 
control system, and the entire thing came in at about 900 lines.  What 
makes the 900 line count attractive is that it is easier to debug and 
enhance 900 lines than 9000.  I do not claim, "look it is small" I 
claim, "Andromeda lets you manage patches and revisions, stamp versions, 
and publish code node-to-node for free".  The 900 line count just means 
it will go stable that much faster.

Second, I will play devil's advocate and say  it is *not* more 
flexible.  There is an illusion of flexibility because your small 
feature set leaves future decisions open, but it cannot free you from 
the inevitable day when you must decide on each item.  As your projects 
roll in and your needs press in, you will decide how to handle multiple 
browsers, security, user features already present in other systems, and 
so on and so on.  Each decision will press all future projects to 
conform to the decision as it was made *at* *that* *time*.  Unless you 
are perfect in your decisions, the larger the framework becomes the more 
of a chokehold it gains on your development shop.  So flexibility is not 
found in a small feature set, we must look elsewhere for a definition.

A truly flexible framework does lots of work for you, lets you override 
it when you think you're smarter, and, very importantly, let's you 
repent of your decisions and change your mind without breaking 
anything.   This is the kind of flexibility that we are after with 
Andromeda, and I like to think we've done it.  Here is an example.  We 
are doing a system for a magazine distributor that has about 40 tables.  
All but 5 of them are maintained with normal screens for which we did 
zero programming, they all came for free.  But there are 5 crucial 
operations that by their nature require custom screens, so we are doing 
5 custom screens loaded with Ajax and lots of alerts, validations and so 
forth.  Andromeda is flexible because it not only allows me easily to 
put up menu items pointing to custom forms, but it also provides me with 
facilities to determine the security of those forms, routines for Ajax 
and HTML generation, and so forth. 


>  Because it's so simple,  I can easily adapt it to do what 
> I want.  If I decide I really hate it,  I can write a new one in an 
> hour.  

Lots of people have heard of the KISS principle, "Keep it Simple, 
Simon".  But most have not heard of Einstein's variation, "Keep it as 
simple as possible, and *no* *simpler*."  Remember that we said above 
that if simple is better, a blank page wins.  The real genius is in 
accomplishing necessary goals in a simple way.

A framework is a middle ground in the "generalization-specialization" 
problem.  Something like PHP is perfectly generalized, it can do 
anything in potential but out of the box cannot actually do anything 
practical.  A finished program on the other hand is perfectly 
specialized, it can do one thing well but cannot do any other thing.  A 
framework is supposed to be in the middle.  A CMS framework specializes 
in CMS systems, but still has enough generalization in it to allow for 
all of the variations that are necessary.  A business framework like 
Andromeda specializes in eliminating labor from the task of drafting, 
revising, delivering and documenting complex business apps.  But it 
still has enough generalization to allow for other variations.

Why not just talk to the developer? Why fork?  Why not make code 
contributions to a framework?  Nate of CakePHP is on this list, and so 
am I.   If you use Andromeda I benefit, so I want you to use it.  The 
law of averages says that anything you want is likely to be desirable to 
other programmers, so I want to know what you need and get it in there. 

I wish you luck and I thank you for bringing these thoughts to the list, 
I'm looking forward to more fruitful discussion.

I can get this to work when running the PHP CLI, but I can't get it to
work with Apache.

I'm sure it has something to do with Windows permissions, but I don't
use Windows XP on that level to route around this.

My whole take on frameworks (and languages in general) is the  
debugging process.  In a web application if something does not look  
right or function correctly am I going to know exactly *where* to  
look for the problem?  In an MVC ideal its pretty simple (even if you  
look at in GUI terms) ... its ridiculous to spend an entire day  
tracking down where $_variable is and what it does.    They were  
doing that 10 years ago in C and C++.  I like smarter languages and  
smarter frameworks.  If you write one or two lines of code +  
everything is figured out for you, its pretty powerful stuff to take  
for granted.

One easy way to grab the text from a word doc is to use the command line
program catdoc.

here are a couple of examples to get you started.

Dan

function catdoc_string($str)
{
	// requires catdoc
	
	// write to temp file
	$tmpfname = tempnam ('/tmp','doc');
	$handle = fopen($tmpfname,'w');
	fwrite($handle,$a);
	fclose($handle);
	
	// run catdoc
	$ret = shell_exec('catdoc -ab '.escapeshellarg($tmpfname) .' 2>&1');
	
	// remove temp file
	unlink($tmpfname);
	
	if (preg_match('/^sh: line 1: catdoc/i',$ret)) {
		return false;
	}
	
	return trim($ret);
}

function catdoc_file($fname)
{
	// requires catdoc
	
	// run catdoc
	$ret = shell_exec('catdoc -ab '.escapeshellarg($fname) .' 2>&1');
	
	if (preg_match('/^sh: line 1: catdoc/i',$ret)) {
		return false;
	}
	
	return trim($ret);
}

S5 http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ by Eric Meyer, is an XHTML/CSS
and JavaScript slideshow system.  Mix in some "presentacular"
(http://labs.cavorite.com/presentacular/ ) js libraries and now you
can use script.aculo.us visual effects in your S5 slide shows.

Since your goal is to create a slideshow that you can share with an
audience while you control the timing, it would seem like you could
possibly create a "S5 remote control" so that you could build on a
widely used project and focus on the one aspect that is missing
without having to bother with the details of actually creating the
x-browser content/slideshow system.

There is another system similar to S5 created by Dave Raggett and
others at the W3C called Slidy. http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/

And Robert Nyman created a spin-off of S5 that already uses Ajax...
except his implementation uses Ajax to retrieve the content (as XML)
from the server rather than to create a controller.

While I understand what you are saying, I don't think I properly
explained what the client is doing. They store all of their data in
the LDAP, then they run a bunch of batch files on a nightly basis that
exports the data from the LDAP to CSV files, so that the data can then
be imported into Access, MySQL and other data sources.

There is a lot of hoop-jumping required because LDAP is the primary
data store. For example, one of the required attributes is 'recordID.'
To get that, which is essentially a primary key for the MySQL export,
we have to go out and open a file that stores all of the recordIDs,
get the last one in the file, increment it by one, and then use that
value when we do the ldap_add().

I just think it would make a lot more sense to use MySQL as the
primary data store, and then extract the data as an LDIF for import in
to LDAP.

Hi Greg,

Great suggestions.  slidePresenter is in version 0.03 by now but is 
essentially an ammateur hack.  I'm really impressed with Slidy, 
especially when I see ( <http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/#(15)> ) 
that it's got a vision to include exactly the "distributed audience" 
features I'm looking for.  Perhaps I can use it as my excuse to rid the 
world of yet another slideshow program.

Thanks,
Allen

my understanding of LDAP (I was immersed in it for a bit back in the
boom), is it's really optimized for name/address lookup applications
(colleges, hospital directories, etc).  I know some people have tried
to use it for securing directories at various levels, not sure how
that worked out.

I think for its designed purpose, there is probably no db engine that
can match it in speed for what it does best, SIMPLE looks ups.
Anything beyond that (as described in your post), is for sure a
mysql/db type application. The syntax always drove me crazy, I noticed
the coding pros were all english majors, who hacked LDAP on the side.

Language of choice working with LDAP?  I would suspect that the
biggest systems are perl based.

That's my understanding as well.

Security, although not for directories, is also a part of this
project. A lof of the parent organizations have child records and we
need to secure them based on the user login. I think we'll have to
verify everything based on the user's DN or something. I don't even
want to begin to think about that yet.

I tried, unsuccessfully, to convince the client to ditch LDAP as the
data store and move to MySQL. If he had done that, I would probably be
done with this project by now.

But, at least someone else thinks this is probably not the best
approach. If it comes up again, I can always say that I got some other
opinions:)

Some of those people work for Microsoft, and their implementation is
known as Active Directory.

That's not a recommendation by any means, but there it is.

This may be where the "higher-ups" thought that LDAP lends value (in controlling access in a granular fashion).  It's not an easy 
problem to solve, but the infrastructure is available in LDAP.  I know there's basic authentication available in MySQL (I'm more 
of a postgresql person myself), but I think that complex access requirements will probably be easier to implement in LDAP.

I'm not a big fan of the syntax either (though I've been doing it long enough now, that I no longer notice how rough around the 
edges it is).   One thing that I would point out is that it's not a "pure speed" thing (accessing a local flat file to perform a 
lookup will almost always be faster than querying a network resource, no matter how much you've optimised the latter).  The 
benefit of LDAP isn't that it's faster than everything else.  The benefit is that it gives you a robust extensible structure 
that's relatively well-documented, and there are lots of tools and code snippets out there which can be leveraged.

I have always had trouble with trying to write these from scratch. The

<?php

$unique=false;
$newTeam=$_POST['newTeam'];

You don't need a loop here. The loop is in the function, where it belongs.

All you need is:

$unique = checkDuplicate($newTeam);

I am confused as to why you are looping over one value to begin with? 
You really only need to loop over a list of values but you only have one.

Anyway, you need to change something with each iteration of your loop. 
If you don't modify the team name, or the array of teams, or what 
condition you are checking on you just keep checking the same thing over 
and over and it always ends up with the same result (true in your case).
Every time you call checkDuplicate() you are resetting your count to 0. 
You probably should be keeping that in a global somewhere so that it 
keeps its value between iterations. But even then, I am not sure that 
what you have written is what you really need.

The way it looks now... your doing a while loop that will keep looping 
until unique is true.  If unique never gets set to true, then it's going 
to loop forever.  I don't see a need for that while loop.  You can just do

$unique=checkDuplicate($newTeam);

also... your function could be simplified a little bit:

function checkDuplicate($value){
    global $teams;
    //do query here, return an array
    for($i=0; $i<count($teams); $i++){
        if($value==$teams[$i]){
            return true;
            }
        }
    return false;
    }

Be sure to escape the contents of $newTeam before doing anything like 
inserting it into a database or echoing it on the page.

Good luck!

Oh yeah, that would probably have been helpful.

OK, the deal is that I need to ensure that the value that gets
inserted into the LDAP directory is unique. So if the value that is
entered by the user is 'Browns,' I need to take that value and search
for matches. If there is a match, then I need to drop the 's' off of
the end and make it 'Brown1.' But then I need to ensure that value is
unique. So I have to take the newly computed value and run it back
through the array to make sure there isn't a duplicate.

The client wants the script to generate this unique key without any
involvement from the end-user.

I didn't properly explain before. I do need to set $unique to true at
some point.

Yes, that is part of the plan. It's removed here for simplification.

Guess what happens when $unique is FALSE?

As a helpful suggestion, when it takes 40 lines of code to check to see
whether a value is in an array, it's probably a good idea to take a step
back and see if there is a simpler solution:

Hope that helps.

Again, my fault for not being clear enough.

If $unique returns false, I need to run some other scripts that will
*attempt* to uniquely generate a new value, then take the new value
and run checkDuplicate() again. And so on until $unique returns true.

Yeah, I know. This is the client's hair-brained idea. I told him I'd
take a look. The problem all goes back to how they are handling their
data.

They are using LDAP for data storage. Each record has a 'key' value
which they want to be unique. The key is generated from a combination
of three user-input values, so it's not as easy as 'Browns.' In the
current system, there is no check in place to ensure that the key is
unique. In the new system, they want the script to generate the key
and ensure its uniqueness.

while (!$unique) {

    $unique = checkDuplicate($newTeam);

I took your original code and modified it extensively. It now uses 
recursion to get a unique value and I add that value to the array. I 
put echo statements at the end for debuging purposes. I also 
hardcoded the "$newteam".  Have a look and see if this solves your problem:

<?php
$teams=array(
'Reds',
'Browns',
'Bengals',
'Cavaliers',
'Blue Jackets',
'Indians'
);
$unique=false;
//$newTeam=$_POST['newTeam'];
$newTeam = 'Browns';
function checkDuplicate($value,$teams,$cnt=1){
                 $chk = in_array($value,$teams);
                 if (!$chk) {
                         $teams[] = $value;
                         return array(true,$teams);
                 }
                 $nt = substr($value,0,-1) . $cnt++;
                 list ($chk,$teams) = checkDuplicate($nt,$teams,$cnt);
                 while (!$chk) {
                   $nt = substr($value,0,-1) . $cnt++;
                   list ($chk,$teams) = checkDuplicate($nt,$teams,$cnt);
                 }
                 return(array($chk,$teams));
}

list($unique,$teams) = checkDuplicate($newTeam,$teams);
echo '<pre>' . var_export($unique,true) . "\n";
echo print_r($teams,true) . '</pre>';
list($unique,$teams) = checkDuplicate($newTeam,$teams);
echo '<pre>' . var_export($unique,true) . "\n";
echo print_r($teams,true) . '</pre>';
?>

Hello Everyone,

I am using the following regex to retrieve text between two <div> tags. 

$trans_text = preg_match(/<div id=result_box dir=ltr>(.+?)</div>/);

However, the parser keeps telling me it expects a ) but found / instead. What am I doing wrong? 

Can anyone please help a regex newbie in his quest? lol

Thanks,

    It's probably the / in /div.  Try

...<\/div>/

Thanks for the help...that worked. But, for some reason, the entire regex breaks down now. While I don't get an error, it seems to not be working as I get the entire text. Is my syntaxt wrong?

Thanks,
Anthony

Don't you need to surround the pattern in quotes?  I always have.

Is it returning everything between that first div and the last </div> on the
page?  If so, it's being 'greedy'.  Basically that .+? is matching
everything (including interior </div>'s).  You can use the 'Ungreedy'
modifier 'U' (captial u after the final slash) or make your regex between
the divs more specific.  Something like ([^<]+) (anything that's not a left
angle bracket) can be ok if you don't expect the left angle bracket to be in
your subject.

manual for modifiers:
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php

And Mr. Merlo's suggestion about quotes (strange that it doesn't throw an
error without them, no?)

Message-ID: <200611290912.59316.arzala@gmail.com>

You are violating 2 rules here of how to use regular expressions.

#1 Regular expressions always needs 2 arguments. 1: Pattern to be matched and 
2: String in which defined pattern is to be matched.

Here you missed 2nd arguments that is why parser gives ) => / error.

#2 Quote (double or single) is almost must in regular expressions specially 
when you want to expand modifiers (?, ., + etc)

If you don't use quote then code will work but pattern will be treated as a 
constant and php will go to parse it and may generate "Notice" if such can 
not be found. Below is the correct way to use this regular expression 
function.

$trans_text=preg_match("/<div id=result_box dir=ltr>(.+?)<\/div>/",
$ss__strToBeLookedIn);

Also note "</div> => <\/div>", because php thinks that "/" is end of boundary 
which is not actually :)

Thanks

One nice 'trick' in using regex to match code is to use another
delimiter character bessides '/' since it is so commonly found in the
'needle' pattern.  Other 'common' delimiters are % or #.

e.g. instead of
preg_match('/needle/imUs', $haystack);
do this
preg_match('#needle#imUs', $haystack);

Using alternate pattern delimiters means that you do NOT have to
escape '\' any slash '/'
e.g. (a rough untested pattern that matches and captures anchor tag
parts inside div tags)
preg_match('#<div>.*<a href="([^"]+)">([^<]+)</a>\s*</div>#imUs', $haystack);


ps
imUs is my mnemonic for pattern modifiers
i = case insensitive
m = multi-line so ^ and $ pattern anchors can match many times per
file instead of only once
U = ungreedy
s = "dot-all" such that the '.' meta character matches/includes new
line characters.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] output to Dymo LW400 label printer?
Message-ID: <456DD249.3030406@fdcx.net>

Fellow PHP'ers;

I've been working with a Dymo USB attached label printer on a Linux 
system piping my output to lp which prints through cups to the 
referenced printer.  It actually does work!!!

However, I need to control the sizes, fonts, styles, graphics, etc 
output that is printed.  I've searched groups.google, Dymo's site, just 
about anywhere I could think of to no avail.

Has ANYONE been able to control this printer from within a PHP program 
either by sending embedded escape sequences or adding -o option 
parameters to the output string?

If so, I would LOVE to get some insight of how you accomplished that.

I've tried just about everything I have found and/or could think of and 
nothing seems to make a difference.

Anyone???

Thanks,

bobmct

Try this one
preg_replace('/(http:\/\/[^\s<>]+)/i', '<a href="$1" 
target="_blank">$1</a>', $str);

Take out the target="_blank" if you want.

Thanks to Rob & Tim. Exactly what I needed.
I've got to expand my knowledge or reg and preg. I was attempting to use str 
positions and such to find it.
Uggh.

Thanks!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] simple date arithmetic:  days since x
Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.58.0611301037310.81278@emra.pair.com>


I am having a little trouble thinking this morning. Suppose I just want to
know how many full days have elapsed since October 21, 2006.

$then = mktime(0,0,0,10,21,2006);
$now = time();
$days = floor(($now-$then)/86400);

echo "$days days since 2006-10-21";

Anyone see anything wrong with my reasoning here? This happens to straddle
a seasonal time change, but as I see it, that doesn't matter.

Thanks

Just as a side note, adodb extension supports ldap and sql backends 
using pretty much same syntax, so at least you can have code 
consistency, simply changing the statement executed from some .conf file 
('select * from bla' vs  ugly ldap queries), and then send it to the 
good old $conn_id->Execute().
