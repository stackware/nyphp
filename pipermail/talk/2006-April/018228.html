<PRE>Okay, here it is -- my last draft on &quot;Selling the PHP 5 Upgrade&quot;:
 
1) XML/RSS/Web Services Integration 
Accurate, simpler and faster usage of these essential technologies. 
Jump starts integration potential with other sites and third-party services.

 
2) File Upload/Downloads Improved
This increasingly vital user interface is more securely implemented and 
the usage standardized for more exacting control. 
 
3) Date/Time Handling Improved
Date usage is broadened in scope and features more date formatting options 
to satisfy more local and international needs. 
 
4) Database Interface Improved 
More coherent and more versatile MySQL functions: opens/closes connections,
executes queries, 
and returns large result sets more efficiently. 
 
5) Directory Reading and Display Improved
Scan full directories of files with more ease, accuracy and speed. 
This resource intensive user experience is enhanced. 
 
6) OOP [Object Oriented Programming] Model 
Eases the maintenance of centralized core business logic and 
handles scaling up for large enterprise applications. 
 
7) PHP5 Eases Management Concerns
PHPP5 natively engenders more coding innovation. Management rests easier
knowing 
that web applications are being built from scratch with built-in improved
security and 
more application strength.
 
8) PHP5 Will Eclipse PHP4 in Best Code Projects 
Freely-available, open source PHP business-solutions projects 
in their next wave will not be backwards compatible to PHP4.

Any good framework to develop in is going to require the advanced features
of php5, there is just no way php4 can do this well.  Probably a good
argument for an enterprise web site management team.

Based on my experience, PHP 4 will be sunsetted right around the time
none of the core developers are still using it.
