</I>That is funny. Never is this theory tested more than in marketing. Your 
logic says a good marketer must have an amazingly well marketed 
business. Hah.

The best marketers I know do no marketing at all for their own 
businesses. The best SEOs I know have simple, one age websites, and even 
then only because they needed somewhere to point the people they 
*didn't* want to talk to.

I work in competitive tactics. I deploy fast and innovate on the fly. 
Almost everything is opportunity driven, and backed by a strong faith in 
fundamentals. That flies in the face of modern &quot;expectations&quot;. I *could* 
show you my tricks and tactics and methods by using them on my own 
website, but why would I? In fact, it is conceivable that I would use 
the wrong methods and tactics on my public website, just to distract the 
competition from my real work.

Ditto for CSS pros who achieve goals with CSS. Why give it away by 
labeling it as &quot;your best work&quot; and putting it up at a known address for 
anyone to inspect, copy, critique?

I know.... not a simple topic. Chicken and egg, etc. But it has always 
been true that you should not judge a book by it's cover in most cases.
