</I>&gt;&gt;<i>In fact, it is conceivable that I would use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the wrong methods and tactics on my public website, just to distract the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>competition from my real work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But you enjoy the cloak-and-daggerness of it, and you obviously have enough work to keep you busy and networked into new clients. If you
</I>&gt;<i>were looking for growth, you would deploy world-class techniques and sit at the top of the results. The volume of new business could allow
</I>&gt;<i>you to hire a big chunk of the competition.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If I wanted to spend my hours managing a large business with employees 
and clients maybe, but I prefer to spend my hours optimizing and 
strategizing. Growth for me is larger, more complex and long term 
projects, not volumes if optimize-these-title-tags work where I would 
have to hire monkeys and  cut contracts with banana farmers. The problem 
with my line of work is that it is easier to make $N using the tools for 
myself in the market than to make the same $N deploying the tools for 
someone else. Customers are not often interested in paying to learn why 
they should do what I suggest, and I literally have to dig into a field 
in order to be successful (so it has to be interesting to me either 
way). What sells SEO is competition - when a site owner loses to rank 
the owner seeks out an SEO. What they will find in the SEO serps  is 
someone to take their money. If you even try to rank in the SEO world 
you will have to outrank big money fast-talking MMF outfits and that's 
not affordable.

&gt;&gt;<i>Ditto for CSS pros who achieve goals with CSS. Why give it away by labeling it as &quot;your best work&quot; and putting it up at a known address for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>anyone to inspect, copy, critique?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You're trolling now, because anybody who writes CSS for a living knows that their work is on display for anyone to see. My god, how fortunate
</I>&gt;<i>you will be if someone actually takes the time to inspect, copy, and critique.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Me? Troll? No way!  ;-)     Eric Meyer does not have an excellent 
website IMHO, yet he's a CSS guru. And if I challenged you to find a URL 
that showcased his best work, could you? I have often wished I knew when 
my CSS guru launched a new site... I'd be all over it as I would not 
have to pay him so much to repeat the best of it for me. And he knows 
that, and keeps his client list under wraps.

&gt;<i>The only reason to hide a good idea is because you are afraid you'll never have a better one. Good luck selling yourself if you're never
</I>&gt;<i>going to have any more good ideas.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Not true at all in an opportunity-driven market. Good ideas are cheap, 
and execution is everything. I can guarantee you that if I post a page 
of my best SEO work with my name on it, it will be duplicated many times 
in the same markets within days. Partly because my work is focused on 
opportunity (if I did it there must be opportunity) but also because of 
a blind faith that I would not have executed if it were not worthwhile - 
a blindness fueled by the low cost of copying.  Misdirection raises the 
costs of copying.
