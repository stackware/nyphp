Hi!

To make it obvious: I hate IIS! I have to deal with it on a regular basis and 
it is a pain in the rear to work with. Yes, it has a flashy admin GUI, but 
that does not make it any easier. That said, the are means to get PHP to work 
with IIS. The connection to SQL Server is independent of that and works the 
same way as when running Apache. That said, a while ago I came across a 
comparison between the various stacks and it turned out that Apache on Win has 
the best performance compared to IIS on Win or Apache on Linux. That might 
have changed by now.
If it is an option, I'd go with Apache on Win. It is very stable, easy to 
configure, and it prevents all the headaches that come with IIS. OK, it leaves 
the ones that come with Apache, but you know about those. As far as scripts 
are concerned, they should work fine less the cases where you do direct file 
access, but that depends on how that part was / is going to be implemented in PHP.

Go with Apache on Win!

David
