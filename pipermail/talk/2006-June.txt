Can someone explain $$_key = $_value  (I see it often in plugin functions in
Smarty dealing with passed parameters.)

foreach ($params as $_key=>$_value) {
         switch ($_key) {
             case 'loop':
                 $$_key = (array)$_value;   //   hmm....$$_key
                 break;

Thanks

It is a variable variable. Take a look at the PHP manual for more 
information:

That's using variable variables. It's all explained at

Subject: [nycphp-talk] CMS with split testing?
Message-ID: <f1dc81bb0606011244x5af893b1tfab1434fa0ff8eeb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone knows of / has used a CMS that has split
testing built in (or can be added with an existing plug-in or
something).

For example, I need 50% of the visitors to see version "A" of a page
and 50% to see version "B" of the same page. Then I need to check how
many of group "A" did something (like reached page "C") and how many
of group "B" did the same thing.

I found this discussion which claims that Joomla can already do this,
but I have not been able to find where this is documented:
http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=385858

Something free would be nice, but a "low cost" (under 2k) solution
would also work.

TIA
Ophir

Nice list ... Id probably also add the ~native~ builtin calls to  
__get, __set, and __call in there as well ... (vs. having to always  
call overload()).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Static variables, self:: and abstract classes
Message-ID: <C0AAF29C.97A9%akamm@demicooper.com>


Hello all -- I've coded a set of classes that inherit from an abstract
class. To my dismay, I've realized after charting and coding everything out
that my class hierarchy may be of no use because of how PHP handles
inheritance of variables/methods when extending a class.

In short, when a method is declared in the parent class and uses
"self::$whatever", when calling the method from a child class the "whatever"
portion always references the parent value of "whatever."

I've come to grips with this being just the way it is, but does anyone have
a solution that will prevent me from cutting and pasting all the methods
from my parent class into the child class (effectively killing the point of
the inheritance)?

In addition, is there any logical reason for the language to operate this
way? I found it reported as a bug on the PHP site, but I believe the final
result/response was that it's not a bug, but intentional. I don't know Java
or C, so I have no frame of reference, but it seems kind of weird to me.


Example:

*****************************************
abstract class ParentClass {
    protected static $myVar = "parent var!";
    function printVar() {
        echo self::$myVar;
    }
}  


class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    protected static $myVar = "child var!";
}


ChildClass::printVar();  //displays "parent var!"
*****************************************


thanks in advance!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Why the light has gone out on LAMP
Message-ID: <8C8579086BD16D2-7BC-1310@FWM-D36.sysops.aol.com>

Hey everyone,

Check out this article.  It is a huge slam on the LAMP framework.  It 
may be worth our collective response.

The article is titled:

Why the light has gone out on LAMP

Written by:

http://blog.develix.com/frog/user/cliff/article/2006-06-04/9



Bits and pieces from the article:

I'm quite opposed to using MySQL and PHP, and I'm none too fond of 
Apache. Anyone who knows me or happens into a conversation with me 
about development quickly learns of my distaste for these particular 
projects. To be fair, Apache is the least problematic of the three and 
if there were no alternatives, I'd use it without a lot of complaint.

MySQL and PHP, on the other hand, really raise my ire. Both of them 
have two major problems:

1. Bug ridden (by this I am including both misfeatures as well as 
actual bugs).
2. They encourage bad habits.

PHP is another sore spot for me. I've gotten to the point that not only 
will I not write PHP code, I won't even run applications written in PHP 
(my long search for decent blogging software was due to the restriction 
that it not be written in PHP). At some level PHP is a great language 
because the entry cost is so low. Not so much because the language is 
so particularly friendly, but because it was designed to work in an 
extremely simple environment (the web) and because it's quite possible 
to learn PHP incrementally by intermixing it with HTML. So what's the 
problem? Well, first of all, as anyone who's done much web programming 
will tell you, mixing code with markup is *not* a good thing if you 
care about maintenance or extensibility. The very thing that makes PHP 
a great language for beginners is the very thing that makes it a bad 
language for beginners. At some point they will have to unlearn those 
habits, except that usually they don't. Also, because it's so easy to 
whip out a quick PHP webapp, many, if not most, PHP programmers fail to 
delve very deep into the realm of programming, preferring to sit at the 
edge and reap the benefits without the work (I'm not talking about 
coding work, rather the work of understanding your field). PHP 
programmers practically popularized the most common attack in the 
world, the SQL-injection attack. Not only is it the most common, it's 
the most easily avoided. That's how shallow most PHP-programmer's 
knowledge is. "Professional" programmers are still assembling SQL 
queries by concatenating strings.

PHP and MySQL are this generation's BASIC, the language that was 
described thusly by the Free Online Dictionary of Computing

BASIC has become the leading cause of brain-damage in proto-hackers. 
This is another case (like Pascal) of the cascading lossage that 
happens when a language deliberately designed as an educational toy 
gets taken too seriously. A novice can write short BASIC programs (on 
the order of 10-20 lines) very easily; writing anything longer is (a) 
very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make it harder to 
use more powerful languages well. This wouldn't be so bad if historical 
accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros. As it is, it 
ruins thousands of potential wizards a year.

Replace BASIC with PHP or MySQL and you've got today's most common 
programmer. Worse, the most common programs in existence today mix the 
two in a brain-freezing mixture of stupidity.

Yeah, I may have missed how I originally coded it -- I've been trying
several different methods so I probably got confused.

Ultimately, it comes down to any use of a "self::XXXX" reference in a parent
class method will cause a child class to use the parent's value for
"self::XXXX."   

Most recently, I tried assigning constants in the parent class to the value
of __CLASS__. Sure enough, when those constants were used in a static method
and called by a child class, the value of the constants were the name of the
parent class, not the class actually calling the method(!).

I'm thinking I may have to develop a separate manager class to handle the
functions. Kind of a drag, but I really don't want to cut and paste the
exact same methods into 10 child classes.

I'm not seeing the upside to this implementation of self::. How does Java
handle this?

I don't think a response is necessary. This statement illustrates how a

That is so true it that I can?t help but +1 it. Admittedly, older versions
of MySQL aren?t as rich in features as other databases, but most users
understand the concept of 'keys' and normalization because they had to do
some work to set it up rather than use a wizard.

I've had M$SQL users give me the eye roll when they hear that I work in
MySQL, then after reviewing their work I find that they haven't even
normalized their database, made use of foreign keys, indexes or anything
else that would make their 'database' something more then a glorified
spreadsheet.

Most languages support GOTO and do not require you to comment, and your 
code will still compile/run.
Any OO language can be used as a glorified wrapper for a bunch of functions.

Its also possible to learn ASP by doing that same thing.
In the matter of fact, its possible to be stupid with any programming 
language/environment.

I love the "most php programmers" part.
I got another great one, "most people are born with sub-standard 
intelligence level".
That one is also hard to argue for/against...

BASIC typically gets a bad rap -- but in some it's not deserved.

I spent many years programing in FutureBASIC for the Mac it was far better than the other languages I programmed in, such as CodeWarrior.

I could turn out a "real" application in a fraction of the time it would take C programmers and there was no difference in application performance (i.e., speed).

But then again, maybe I'm one of those "brain-damage in proto-hackers" -- that might explain a lot, huh? Maybe that's why I turned to php/mysql -- hmmmm.

Damn, and he's speaking at our conference...

Though it's strange how he forgets that LAMP actually stands for
Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP-Python-Perl.  Guess his little rant is in response to
him forgetting that, too.

Hi Andrew,

well. i?ve left php exactly for this "problem", the solution well, it?s a
different history.

on java, when u extends a class the child class inherits all methods and
attributes, and you still have the option to overwrite or override the
parent method. but, i dont know why php does not let you override a method
(and, i?m not sure, but does not let you overwrite a method too).

so, what can u do?

you can change the static method to a non-static one and try to overwrite
the method to get the child attribute in the method.

or you can try testing the instance of the class. just like this

if (obj instance of parent1) call method from parent1
elseif (obj instance of parent2) call method from parent2 and so on

if this does not help you. let me know... and then i can make further test
to get a solution

[]?s

I could have sworn there was a command line tool which someone posted
that audited an old PHP4 codebase to perform PHP5 migration checks ...
(ie a code scanner that spitted out warnings).  Things like array_merge,
domxml, etc ...
 
Anyone know of it or the name?  Was it a Zend tool?
 
Thanks.

Just an update ? my hack to get around this was to allow instantiation of
empty objects that are used for calling what would be static methods.

The classes would normally accept a numeric $id var in their constructor
(the constructor being defined in the parent class) --- I?ve adapted them to
accept the string ?static? as well. If ?static? is the argument for the
constructor, they object is created without any of the normal properties it
would have as an individual ?object?, but it?s able to call methods defined
in the parent class and have them be relevant to the child class (i.e., in
the parent class there are no more references to ?self::XXXX?, just
references to ?this->xxxx?.

The methods within the parent class are no longer static.

It?s a hack, but it beats maintaining several files with the exact same
code.

Hi Andrew,

well. i?ve left php exactly for this "problem", the solution well, it?s a
different history.

on java, when u extends a class the child class inherits all methods and
attributes, and you still have the option to overwrite or override the
parent method. but, i dont know why php does not let you override a method
(and, i?m not sure, but does not let you overwrite a method too).

so, what can u do?

you can change the static method to a non-static one and try to overwrite
the method to get the child attribute in the method.

or you can try testing the instance of the class. just like this

if (obj instance of parent1) call method from parent1
elseif (obj instance of parent2) call method from parent2 and so on

if this does not help you. let me know... and then i can make further test
to get a solution

Sometimes blog articles are best ignored. The last thing I would do for

That said, I can't ignore the new bill introduced that eliminates fair 
use and makes us have to pay "per listen" for music. It enables the RIAA 
to sue anyone who listens to a song (even one they bought..even if they 
bought the CD) each time they listen to it on their mp3 player, etc. 
http://www.eff.org/IP/060512SIRAof2006DiscussionDraft.pdf

As if that wasn't ballsy enough, they are trying to make it retroactive 
to 2001.

Now do I pay attention to a rant from a hardcore non-PHP coder about how 
he dislikes the most popular and successful innovation platform on the 
web since HTML, or email the members of the committee set up to govern 
me before they eliminate innovation via the chilling effects of $150,000

Andrew:

You can keep it static, but the child class must manually modify the 
values as desired rather than setting the property in the child.

class a {
    public static $aa = 'original';
    public static function e() {
        echo self::$aa . "<br/>\n";
    }
}

class b extends a {
    public function m() {
        self::$aa = 'modified';
    }
}

b::m();
b::e();

That's basically the problem I'm having -- your example redeclares a new
function in the child class. I would like to declare all of my functions in
the parent class, then allow the child classes to inherit them and have any
static references refer to the static vars in the children and not the
parent. I've tried using constants and get the same results.

I guess it seems logical to me that static self:: variables would work like
how $this-> variables work. When you have a parent class and the child class
inherits the functions, an instantiated child object will use it's own
variables when it is faced with an inherited function that includes
'$this->' (it's not going to fail or look to the parent class for a value).

I'm trying to avoid having to re-write the functions in each child class
because it kind of defeats the purpose of even having a parent class. I
assume I'm missing something, but it seems like a pretty big omission from
PHP --- this really limits the usefulness of class inheritance if I have to
paste code into several child classes.

Basically:

****************************
class a {
    
    //declare parents var
    public static $var = 'original';
    
    //function that will be used in parent and child
    public static function e() {
        echo self::$var . "<br/>\n";
    }
}


class b extends a {
    //declare child's version of the static $var
    public static $var = 'modified';
}

b::e(); //outputs 'original'
****************************

If anyone can give me an example of how this is advantageous and not a bug,
I'd greatly appreciate it. I'd much prefer to see a positive side to this
(especially after hours of trying to work around it), and I really can't.

Is there a better way to handle situations like this? I'm open to
suggestions. I've got a work around, but I'd rather work in a 'best
practices' pattern than just hack around the limitations of the language (if
it is indeed a limitation and not a feature that I am misunderstanding).

If it's not advantageous, any chance it'll be ditched in V.6? Word on the
street is it's not very popular.

thanks again-

why did u had declared the variable as static?

No.  You misunderstand.  You don't need to redeclare each function.  
Consider "m" to be like a constructor.  I would have used __construct(), 
but they don't get called in static mode.  So, instead of setting the 
property values via instantiation in your example, manually set them in 
the fake constructor.  Then manually call the "constructor" before making 
any other static calls on your inherited static methods.

The idea was to have an abstract parent class for customer preferences since
most preference classes would basically share the same code.  The static
vars (or constants) that were to be stored in the individual classes were
properties that differentiate how the child classes would interact with the
database (among other things).

Some of the methods within the classes were not object-specific, but rather
class-specific operations (like a getList() method to get a an array of
options for a specific type of preference (class) rather than something
related to an actual object instance).

For example: customerPreference has child class 'beds' which can be
referenced statically for information about 'beds' in general or you could
instantiate a 'beds' object that refers to '2-bedroom' or '4-bedroom', etc.

Some of the vars I was attempting to store as static (or as constants) were
things like "tableName", "linkTableName", "isMult", etc.

thanks-

Ah .... I see now. Fantastic. I just did a little trial run and I think
that'll work great.  I'm diving back into the actual class files right now
to work it out.

Static is the wrong approach.  So scratch what I said in my prior email, I 
was just trying to prove it could be done.

Declare the methods in the parent and the properties in the children.  
Then instantiate your class into an object.  You get your desired outcome 
without a fake constructor plus you don't have to maintain properties in 
the parent that are just going to get overridden.

class base {
    public function getTablename() {
        echo $this->_tablename . "<br/>\n"; 
    }
}

class joes extends base {
    protected $_tablename = 'joestable';
}

$obj = new joes;
$obj->getTablename();

You know, I've never understood the "real programmers" "real
languages" "real databases" debate thing. If a technology meets your
needs, does what you want, and makes you more marketable because you
acquire skills that are in demand, *who cares* what idiots like this
think?

*Real* programmers adapt and learn whatever languages they need to
stay competitive in their field. They learn whatever is popular. When
VB was popular, we all leanred VB, when C++ was all the rage we
learned C++. Now that so much is moving to the web, PHP and MySQL are
in high demand. It would be career suicide for a programmer to ignore
those technologies because a few people feel they aren't *real*
somehow. The checks I get in the mail for programming in PHP sure feel
real to me.

I think this has been fueled (not created) by the boom which someone
convinced the masses that anyone who could throw together some table
tags was a "programmer".  Since then there are some who have tried to
demonstrate what "real" programmers use vs what the posers use...
Personally, I'd hire Bob Villa with a pair of rocks over myself with
an entire workshop any day.

During most of the 90's, my mother worked at a community college in
the Midwest.  I'll never forget the day ('98 or '99) that I met their
"web developer" who proceded to ask how she could include images in
her webpage...

I agree with Chris that writing a response is not necessary.

While I don't really agree with his "solution" - don't use PHP / MySQL
I do agree that:

- PHP has lowered the entry barrier into the realm of computer programming.
- Many of the people who write programs in PHP don't take the time to
learn computer science fundamentals (and it shows in their code).

I have an old blog entry that goes into more detail about this:
http://www.prusak.com/archives/2004-11-04/how-did-we-get-here/

But to the point - An analogy I like to use is Digital Video.
Today's tools and technologies allows anyone to make their own "movies".
Of course this means that we have more people making movies that are
junk, but that doesn't mean everyone should be using 35mm (

Why can I create php file on this directory?

You just said yourself why you can't:  because your script has no 
write permissions.  chmod the target directory to 777 and you will be 
able to write to it. Alas, so will anybody else, so there is a 
certain security risk involved here.  Only you can decide whether the 
ability to write is worth the risk that others can also.  (You might 
however consider writing to somewhere outside the web directory if 
that is possible in your context.)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Double Loading PHP as image - Firefox or PHP?
Message-ID: <cea129a00606071821t41e79131tbd003d9b972db956@mail.gmail.com>

This is a follow up to an old discussion I started months ago, on which the
last post I found in my own archives was on 12/2.  I can't seem to find the
original post in the archive, but here's a link to one of them:

http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2005-December/017145.html

Strangely long after I'd forgotten the problem due to lack of time to find a
real answer, I got 2 emails from unrelated people working on unrelated
projects with the same issue.  As I'm still as backlogged as I was when I
originally had the issue I haven't progressed much and I couldn't be much
help.  But they seem to have solved the issue, and as I promised then - when
I figure out the answer I'll post it.

I haven't had the opportunity to give this a shot on my end, so I can
confirm nothing - but it seems sound.  Also, should you need to email Jason,
let me know and I'll get you in contact.  I don't want to post his address
here sans permission.

First Conversation with Jason Wieland...

I was wondering if you found a solution to this.  I saw your post a couple
months ago on the nyphp-talk mailing list.  I have exactly the same issues.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Firefox double loading images


Hey thanks for your response.  how I solved it was sending Etag and
Last-Modified headers.  Something like this:

$file_hash = md5_file($post_abs);

header("Etag: \"$file_hash\"");
header('Last-Modified: '.gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s', filemtime($post_abs)).'
GMT');

That seemed to make firefox happy.  I then check for those headers in the
future request to possibly issue a 304 if the image is the same.  Something
like this:

  #Possibly we could the file in the browsers cache
  $headers = apache_request_headers();
  $file_hash = md5_file($post_abs);

  if (isset($headers['If-None-Match']) && ereg($file_hash,
$headers['If-None-Match'])) {
    logger( DEBUG, "Etag match sending 304");
    header("HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified");
    exit;
  }


  if (isset($headers['If-Modified-Since']) &&
(strtotime($headers['If-Modified-Since']) == filemtime($post_abs))) {
    #Etag should always hit first... but just in case
    logger( DEBUG, "If Modified since looks good sending 304");
    header("HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified");
    exit;
  }


Maybe you'll find some of this useful,

Jason, that's fantastic.  I'm going to have to give it a shot when I find a
few minutes.  I really hated the 3-second thing but never caught a moment to
figure it out.  The worst part about researching it was that both requests
'looked' exactly the same even though they were in fact different types of
requests.  I do recall looking everywhere for info, though.  How'd you
figure it out?

If it works for me, I'll probably post it to the list for the archives (with
reference to you, of course), if you don't mind.

Thanks!!

No problem, glad I could help.  I stumbled upon the solution in two parts.
First I loaded up a static image on firefox and used Live Headers (a great
developer extension http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/) to view the
different headers sent for a static image and php dynamic image.  I noticed
that apache automagically stuck in Etag and Last-Modified when requesting
the static image.  Firefox would double request on php dynamic images but
not on static images so I knew it had to be something to do with those
headers.

I also wanted to create a browser caching solution.  The default way php
sends out dynamic images the users browser will request a new image from the
server every time the page is reloaded even though it may have a perfectly
good image sitting in its local cache.  The browsers uses Etag (Entity Tag,
basically just a unique string the represents an id for that image) and
Last-Modified (the time of image creation or modification).  You really only
need to send one.  But apache sends both for static images so I just though
I would send both as well.  After I added those headers the browser stop
doing the double requests and on future request of the image it would return
the Etag and last-modified (If-Modified-Since) http headers which I can use
to issue a 304 (use local cache) to the browser instead of creating the
image all over again and sending it out.


Good Luck,

Jason

http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2005-December/017153.html

Hey Mark, did you ever find any resolution on this? I am hitting a dynamic
(.aspx) resource in an <img> request, but Firefox is making 2 identical
requests one after the other.

It is very bizarre.

There is a slight difference in the Accept header; I'm wondering if some
form of content negotiation is occurring?

Subject: RE: Double Firefox Image Requests

funny you should ask right now.  I'd long forgotten about that post and
ended up using a workaround that did the job but felt so dirty.  Another
person by the name of Jason Wieland came out of the blue a couple days ago
and asked.  I told him my workaround, which was basically to put a timestamp
on requests, using the user agent and _possibly_ the ip(it's been a while)
and a cookie to discern the visitor.  Then set it to ignore any other
requests by the same user for the next 3 seconds.

It's worked all this time (to my knowledge), but it has that terrible kludgy
feel to it.

Jason hit me back just yesterday with his solution:

--- (refer to last message) ---

I haven't had the chance to test it yet and probably won't for at least a
couple weeks, but it's an interesting approach.  I just replied to him right
before writing this to ask how he came up with it.

Anyways, if it works for me, I'm going to add it to the nyphp post for the
archives.  If you get a chance to try it out, let me know how it goes.

Have a great evening!

----------------------------------------------------------

Jason Collins:
As I did more experimenting yesterday, I found that Firefox behaved much
differently when the request came from an <img> tag embedded in an HTML
page.

That is, if I requested the resource directly, I received double requests
from Firefox for many response header combinations (basically any header
combination that made the resource non-cachable).

If I embedded that request in an <img> tag inside of an HTML document, many
of those double requests went away.

My solution was similar to below ? I set a Last-Modified in the past, and
set the Expires header to Now. Combining this with only requesting from an
embedded <img> tag, I got 200 and 304 activity as I would have expected. My
C# source:

              // Case 1
              //context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(
HttpCacheability.NoCache);
              // IE good
              // firefox makes double requests

              // Case 2
              //context.Response.Cache.SetETag("123"); // ETag, on its own,
doesn't emit!!!
              // ETag is not emitted at all!!! Asp.Net weirdness? Unknown.
Moving on.

              // Case 3
              //context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(
HttpCacheability.NoCache);
              //context.Response.Cache.SetLastModified(new DateTime(2000, 1,
1));
              // Last-Modified is not emitted at all (likely due to NoCache)
              // case 3 is therefore like case 1 above.

              // Case 4
              //context.Response.Cache.SetLastModified(new DateTime(2000, 1,
1));
              // IE makes one request, but caches
              // Firefox makes one request, but caches

              // Case 5
              //context.Response.Cache.SetLastModified(new DateTime(2000, 1,
1));
              //context.Response.AddHeader("Expires", "-1");
              // Custom "Expires" header is not emitted therefore like case
4 above

              // Case 6
              //context.Response.Cache.SetLastModified(new DateTime(2000, 1,
1));
              //context.Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now);
              // IE makes correct requests, including If-Modified-Since (for
304)
              // Firefox makes double requests, but does include
If-Modified-Since
              // Update: Firefox only makes double requests if the image is
requested directly!!!

              // Case 7
              // final solution: using Case 6, assuming that <img> is
embedded in web page, and supporting
              // 304 revalidation headers
              context.Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now);
              if (context.Request.Headers["If-Modified-Since"] != null)
              {
                     context.Response.StatusCode = 304;
              }
              else
              {
                     context.Response.Cache.SetLastModified(new
DateTime(2000, 1, 1));
                     context.Response.ContentType = "image/gif";
                     context.Response.OutputStream.Write(ImageBytes, 0,

Forward progress in any field, even the hi tech, is actually a very
incremental uptick of new knowledge and technique applied on top of existent
knowledge. Great creators in every field will readily admit that they stand
on the shoulders of previous giants. As we do even with PHP.

Therefore, I believe there is nothing, not even a spate of misapplied
technique that cannot be refocused and refined within a single generation of
new PHP product and developers.

Just as PHP is actually a compendium of many fine minds at work delivering
slices of solution, then the necessary refocus of all PHP programming on the
more enterprise-ready, flexible, matured OOP technique should start right
here, right now with any and all of us.

To the tech writers, to the tutors, to the paid consultants brought in to
teach a team, to the book writers, to the module creators, to the project
leaders, to the book editors, the conference leaders, the industry leaders,
and the gurus that watchfully circle the fire:

I believe that we can all enhance our product with a single well-applied
master stroke: Start teaching the OOP paradigm, first thing, right out of
the box. Make it the first essential construct that needs to be bridged to
youthful developers. No more first step "echo 'hello world';" examples,
instead go straight to something more like: "class output{ function
present_output($matter){ return $matter; } } $msg = new output();
$msg->present_output('Hello World'); echo $msg;".

Why not segue OOP examples and techniques into all your new instructional
material right now. 

I believe that within 1 - 2 years we could have almost all PHP product
totally converted to OOP, have new people coming in ready set for OOP work,
and have a giant pool of teaching material and product that is all OOP. 

Like others here note, I do independent programming for the certain
freedoms, direct hands-on responsibility, the pretty fine earning potential,
and, yes, even the satisfaction of helping a business use their resources
more competitively and more cost-effectively.

So if we want i) an optimized PHP product, ii) new developers ready set to
go straight to OOP enterprise dev, and iii) developers and the product gain
more share of mind, more market share, and ultimately more dollars
potential: it is time to switch more and more to the OOP paradigm from the
get go.

To those unthanked early adapters already implementing OOP in your
instructional material, we salute you.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Why the light has gone out on LAMP


Hey everyone,

Check out this article.  It is a huge slam on the LAMP framework.  It 
may be worth our collective response.

The article is titled:

Why the light has gone out on LAMP

Written by:

http://blog.develix.com/frog/user/cliff/article/2006-06-04/9



Bits and pieces from the article:

I'm quite opposed to using MySQL and PHP, and I'm none too fond of 
Apache. Anyone who knows me or happens into a conversation with me 
about development quickly learns of my distaste for these particular 
projects. To be fair, Apache is the least problematic of the three and 
if there were no alternatives, I'd use it without a lot of complaint.

MySQL and PHP, on the other hand, really raise my ire. Both of them 
have two major problems:

1. Bug ridden (by this I am including both misfeatures as well as 
actual bugs).
2. They encourage bad habits.

PHP is another sore spot for me. I've gotten to the point that not only 
will I not write PHP code, I won't even run applications written in PHP 
(my long search for decent blogging software was due to the restriction 
that it not be written in PHP). At some level PHP is a great language 
because the entry cost is so low. Not so much because the language is 
so particularly friendly, but because it was designed to work in an 
extremely simple environment (the web) and because it's quite possible 
to learn PHP incrementally by intermixing it with HTML. So what's the 
problem? Well, first of all, as anyone who's done much web programming 
will tell you, mixing code with markup is *not* a good thing if you 
care about maintenance or extensibility. The very thing that makes PHP 
a great language for beginners is the very thing that makes it a bad 
language for beginners. At some point they will have to unlearn those 
habits, except that usually they don't. Also, because it's so easy to 
whip out a quick PHP webapp, many, if not most, PHP programmers fail to 
delve very deep into the realm of programming, preferring to sit at the 
edge and reap the benefits without the work (I'm not talking about 
coding work, rather the work of understanding your field). PHP 
programmers practically popularized the most common attack in the 
world, the SQL-injection attack. Not only is it the most common, it's 
the most easily avoided. That's how shallow most PHP-programmer's 
knowledge is. "Professional" programmers are still assembling SQL 
queries by concatenating strings.

PHP and MySQL are this generation's BASIC, the language that was 
described thusly by the Free Online Dictionary of Computing

BASIC has become the leading cause of brain-damage in proto-hackers. 
This is another case (like Pascal) of the cascading lossage that 
happens when a language deliberately designed as an educational toy 
gets taken too seriously. A novice can write short BASIC programs (on 
the order of 10-20 lines) very easily; writing anything longer is (a) 
very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make it harder to 
use more powerful languages well. This wouldn't be so bad if historical 
accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros. As it is, it 
ruins thousands of potential wizards a year.

Replace BASIC with PHP or MySQL and you've got today's most common 
programmer. Worse, the most common programs in existence today mix the 
two in a brain-freezing mixture of stupidity.

Actually, you were pretty right on with the other suggestion in terms of
this particular implementation (the other method being to use a 'setVars()'
method to set the static vars in a class that is being referenced
statically).

Either way would work, but I want to limit instantiating an object unless
it's really going to be utilized as an object (contrary to the email I sent
a couple days ago about instantiating objects with the string 'static'
rather than the numeric ID they should use).

Basically, I probably should have structured those classes differently, but
I didn't anticipate the whole inherited 'self::' calls referencing the
parent rather than, well... 'self::'. I always thought that's what parent::
was for. I still scratch my head at the logic of that -- I'd love to see an
example of it in a beneficial situation so I could look at it as a
functionality rather then a limitation of PHP.

Thanks for all the help, it's appreciated.

I am always concerned about the beginners, for they are the future.

I would prefer teaching a class "Hello World" and have them experience something immediately positive than teaching them OOP and have the majority not understand or become frustrated with its complexity. What is easy and obvious to you, may not be to others.

Also, keep in mind that innovation and advancement in any field seldom comes from established norms (schools, industry, government), but rather by the fringe, which includes beginners. The examples around us are abundant, such as those found in the histories of Xerox, Apple, Excel, and the list goes on and on.

I taught Karate when I was much younger and my teacher was literally at the top of his craft. I asked him once "Who do you learn from?" and he pointed to a group of white belts.

White belts in Karate, programming, or in any field for that matter, can learn the complexities and benefits of advanced techniques, but only after they learn the basics. And the easier the basics, the better the chance of taking root and supporting growth.

My $0.02.

The person that made that post (Dalt) is the one holding the keys to
that riddle. I have never used Joomla! in that capacity, and am
equally curious how he has done such without significant modification
to the core.

Message-ID: <4489B3F6.7050309@email.smith.edu>

Greetings!

I'm beginning a project that will involve creating PDF documents.  So 
far my research has turned up PDFlib 
(http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdf.php) and FPDF (http://www.fpdf.org/).

So far it seems that FPDF will do what I need.  It has the added benefit 
of being free (as opposed to PDFlib which would run at least $450).

Have folks used FPDF?  Would you recommend it? 

Are there are any other means to generate PDF that you would recommend?

If helpful, here's a brief project summary:
I am developing an application that will allow nontraditional students 
to apply for admission to our college.  The user will be able to create 
an account and work on her application, saving and returning at any time 
(data will be stored in MySQL).  The PDF aspect comes into play when the 
applicant would like to preview the application with her data populating 
the fields.  It will also be used for our support staff to print the 
applications once they are completed.

Here's the blank application which would need to be created and 
populated with student data (application is pages 2-4, instructions are 
on page 1):

I've used FPDF for a few large clients and have been very pleased with it (I
recommend it). Our use involved pulling text from a database and dropping in
images. One of them we did at a high resolution (the client wanted it to
match a print piece we did, but with dynamic content).

The positioning and layout is done differently than HTML (you can't just
print a webpage), but once you get the hang of it, it's fine.

It's picky about image formats too, but not a big deal as long as the other
folks contributing content know what formats are allowed.

Haven't used PDFLib.

HTH,
Andy

I would heartily recommend the R&OS pdf class:

http://www.ros.co.nz/pdf/

It's broadly similar to fpdf and I've used it on several different
projects without any problems.

Another approach that could work very well for what you're describing is
to use fdf/xfdf to dynamically fill fields in an existing pdf document.

There are quite a few good examples of this to be found in the book
PDFHacks by Sid Steward, with an online example and source code
available here:

we have a marketing client that has us building a fun promotional 
feature as part of their website. can't say much except that it involves 
personalizing some things that are then output to PDF to facilitate 
printing. we started down the path of using an expensive .NET component 
(from http://www.tallcomponents.com/) for use in this client's IIS 
environment when we happily discovered PHP was available to us. FPDF is 
working just fine, though we are still in development and haven't done 
any serious QA yet.

I have done several projects where I build data and create a custom pdf file
for printing and in some cases even made it print on the client machine...
Fpdf is the way to go.

Don't know if it fits what you're trying to do (or if it's an 
unnecessary Rube Goldberg solution), but here's what my system does:

We needed a system to take files edited in MS-Word (invitation letters, 
actually), pop in the various name and address fields for a recipient, 
and export the whole thing to a PDF file.  Support for some 
MS-Word-friendly format was crucial, as the invitation letters would 
change at least with every event, and often go through several versions 
for each event.

Our solution was to save the files in RTF, with placeholder tags typed 
right into the text; then use PHP to replace the tags with the right 
values and use Ted (http://www.nllgg.nl/Ted/) (a linux only RTF reader) 
to convert the files from RTF to PDF.  This way, the non-technical 
people who write the letters can spin away on their edits, and I can 
upload them as templates with little trouble.  (Trial and error showed 
me a few things to clean up each time from their sloppy MS-Word 
formmatting before uploading, though.)

It's not pure PHP like FPDF, but it gets us the features we needed.

The last several days i've been working with fpdf and fpdi, which allows you
to import an existing pdf as a template. So far it's been working pretty
well. Some of the methods seem to be a bit buggy, such as MultiCell, but
overall it's very nice.

My jaw hit the desk on this one, guys. Do not allow the webserver to
create php scripts, under any circumstances ever. It's just asking for
trouble.

Abstract the data (job listings) into a text file or sqlite database
and give the webserver password protected write access to that. Or use
a .csv file and edit the records by hand using Excel or EditGrid.com.

If you need to create world-writeable directories for uploaded files
(and you _do_ need them sometimes), you should also take steps (via
Apache config or .htaccess) that php scripts residing in those
directories cannot be executed.

Yes,  That is what I am have decided to do.  Just reading and writing
a txt file.
The php file just include this text file.

I was having problems with the txt file until I found out that there
was a cron job that every hour chmods the values of all the
directories and files to non 755 under the web directory.


Thanks,

N?stor :-)

1. Create the file
2. store md5 checksum of in database
3. compare stored checksum and actual file checksum anytime before 
running the file later.

No?

That might be fine for files you create, but what is going to stop a 
malicious person who finds the directory, put his own scripts into 
it, and causes havoc to your server or the web and you won't even 
know he's there until too late.

Yeah, that's right.  Guess I was thinking too narrowly.  Thanks.

Greetings!

I'm beginning a project that will involve creating PDF documents.  So 
far my research has turned up PDFlib 
(http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdf.php) and FPDF (http://www.fpdf.org/).

So far it seems that FPDF will do what I need.  It has the added benefit 
of being free (as opposed to PDFlib which would run at least $450).

Have folks used FPDF?  Would you recommend it? 

Are there are any other means to generate PDF that you would recommend?

If helpful, here's a brief project summary:
I am developing an application that will allow nontraditional students 
to apply for admission to our college.  The user will be able to create 
an account and work on her application, saving and returning at any time 
(data will be stored in MySQL).  The PDF aspect comes into play when the 
applicant would like to preview the application with her data populating 
the fields.  It will also be used for our support staff to print the 
applications once they are completed.

Here's the blank application which would need to be created and 
populated with student data (application is pages 2-4, instructions are 
on page 1):

I'd also suggest looking into FO, which is a markup language for  
document layout.

I'm not sure if there is yet a PHP parser for FO that will output  
PDF, but it exists in the Java world, and I've heard the java  
libraries work fine from PHP via the java bridge.

I've used FPDF in the past, with good results, but when things start  
getting very dynamic, you start wishing you had an intermediate  
language like FO which could then just be parsed and interpreted.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] DTD choice help?
Message-ID: <BAY105-F1381BBC579CBFE9D97C62ABC890@phx.gbl>

Hiya,

You know, I've been on this list for what, a couple of years now? Reading,
learning (a little) but not much since I still haven't DONE anything! My big
obstacle is nuisance factor - I don't own my server, I rent from GoDaddy
and therefore, don't have my HOTB and in the end, it has just seemed
easier to stick to hand-coded HTML.  *finally* I'm thinking it's going the
other way.

I want to implement a design that is standards compliant, at least browser
independent, and to me, that screams: USE PHP!! So I went off and
found a CSS layout I wanted to use (why code it myself when it's out
there already) and the guy at Blue Robot had a really nice one that
seems to be stable but he's using the HTML 4.01 Strict DTD and I've
been creating content (not much of it but some) for 3 years w/the
XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD.  Before I go "converting" the markup
into PHP templates, I kinda need to pick a DTD, right?

The page or layout I plan to use is on my home page with absolutely
no nav system--it's amazing, a page that goes NOWHERE but has
lots of links offsite!! *chuckle* I'd like to convert to PHP before I
start making myself a nav system for my own content.

http://www.sarahryoffa.com/
CSS is at the root in the file "layout3.css"

My goals for PHP will ultimately be:

1. have the 3 columns (2 of links, one of content) each be a PHP
template file

2. when clicking on a link in one of the side columns, if it's ON site
(my stuff) display it in the content DIV

3. when clicking on a link in one of the side columns, if it's OFF
site (like all the ones there now) open a new window for it

This is *REALLY* basic, I know, but (1) I've never done any PHP
so it's just one more thing to make work and (2) I need to pick a
DTD before I start generating pages, PHP or not.

Help? Advice?

Don't let hosting stop you. I sart people on dreamhost with the L1 
Monthly if they are just getting their feet wet (I give them code 
"tenbucks" to get it for $10). That's $10 to be all set with no 
commitment. For those doing a website from the start, I give out code 
"try92" which is $92 off the prepaid year, which means you get that 
first year for something like $25.

If you are a developer or coder you are very likely to switch hosts or 
add another hosting account in your first 6 months, so don't sweat the 
start and just get going. You can spend forever picking a webhost (or 
reading about advanced PHP issues - lol) but it's all about jumping in 
and trying.

Sorry if I was accidentally misleading... that wasn't made by Allie at 
cyberxdesigns.com, but she was the first to pass that viral to me (hence 
the tip of the hat).

Allie's flash work is much more creative than that (see 
cyberxdesigns.com for the New Jersey bit).

And yes I also know that is in flash and not PHP... so the purists don't 
need to tag me for that :-) 

(for those interested, I actually used it in another context... 
suggesting some of the PR dangers associated with wildcard DNS...  hit 
monster-dot-com.youarealmighty.com and see jobster pay for a nice 
branding effort for their competitor, OR
 hit hey_sh*thead.youarealmighty.com and see how a little sarcasm 
becomes funnier than the original joke, and jobster gets the brand 
tarnish from something potentially more viral than the original.)

Alas, no shortage of minutia on the PHP talk list!

PS: anyway the point was happy birthday php!

Umm, John, your reply not only has nothing at all to do with my ACTUAL
question, but it sounds like a spammy sales pitch.

I have *no* intention of leaving GoDaddy, *love* their service, features,
etc. and can't imagine why you'd be pitching me to change hosts other
than you are trying to sell something on a list dedicated to discussing
technical issues...kinda off topic, aren't you? Please stop spamming tech
lists or at least change the subject to "shameless self-promotion" or
something.


Back to the question at hand, I look forward to some insights on DTD
choice when you guys come back to the office Monday.

Sarah,

John may not have directly addressed your DTD question, but I think the
point he was trying to make was that you should just jump in and give it
a shot.

That said, if you wish to make points about list etiquette, here are a
couple for you.

1. choose the right list

Your DTD question is really more appropriate for the front-end list as
it's not directly related to PHP

2. be aware of your position on the list, especially if you're
considering a potentially insulting post directed at another member.

Here is a quick illustration of what I mean:

http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=john+andrews+nyphp.org&word2=sarah+yoffa+nyphp.org

John is a valued member of the community and was simply trying to help
you out, accusing him of spamming the list is downright insulting and
serves only to discourage him and other members from trying to help out
in the future.

nyphp.org is a great place with many people who are not only very
knowledgeable but also willing to share that knowledge, a very rare and
valuable resource for all the members.

My apologies in advance if I have offended you or anyone else on the
list, the point I'm trying to make is that nyphp.org in general is a
wonderful resource, and the people who are kind enough to take the time
 to share their knowledge should be treated with the respect and thanks
they deserve.

Dan

Of all people, I understand what it means to deal with web hosting. NONE 
of them are straight forward. If you think a newbie has trouble picking 
a DTD (a trivial problem easily answered here: 
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=DTD try the first result) then you 
are in for a surprise dealing with chrooted jails and PHP as CGI and all 
of the other "unmentionables" that come with shared hosting.

As some on this list can attest, I have had tons of problems with 
Dreamhost. I have also had tons of success with Dreamhost (ditto for 
westhost,  serverbeach, and Hostway, and Rackspace, and ev1, and dozens 
of others). For someone who wants to start inserting <?= into their 
DHTML, to start learning what PHP can do with them, IMHO the first step 
is to get on a platform where it really is an easy as inserting those 
codes.

As for "spammy sales pitch" well perhaps that's because I created a 
promo code that gives away the affiliate commission as a discount? I see 
they even allow $97 off now, so I could even make it $97 off if I had a 
reason to go back in and make a new promo code. I don't.

So I suppose I should let you learn the hard way that you should *never* 
host with your registrar? Okay.

(not to the rest of the Talk list: think very carefully about hosting 
with your registrar, especially one that begins with GO and ends with 
Daddy see 
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=godaddy+ransom&btnG=Search for 
just one set of examples).

Welcome to PHP Talk, sry. Make yourself at home. Don't let the old 
timers intimidate you.

A VERY good point! Keep your domain names and sites separate. That way if you decide to divorce, unlike the real world, you get to keep your stuff.

While you have to be married to one woman at a time, that doesn't apply to hosts. It doesn't cost that much (one of mine is under $7 per year, imagine that). So try out different ones for different needs and come and go as you want.

As I often say -- I think everyone should go through at least one divorce before getting married.

To anyone who was following this:

It was Apache.  The AddDefaultCharset directive in httpd.conf (on the new
box) was encoding data before it hit MySQL (which is why none of my
charset-collation changes mattered).  All working now.

Thanks to all who responded.

Nice feature for finding bugs during execution instead of waiting for
output. A bit complicated to set up, but useful for hard to find issues.

Great stuff. Just to be clear, where can we see a schedule of what the $25

Thanks to all for the helpful information.  It looks like FPDF and FPDI 
may fit my needs and I'm currently working through the tutorials for the 
FPDF class.  Importing my existing PDF as a template using FPDI sounds 
like it could be an ideal solution. 

Also ordered the PDF book recommended by Dan:
http://pdfhacks.com/form_session/

I'll post at some point during or on completion of the project if I have 
helpful information or feedback about these classes.

Cheers,

-Aaron

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Strange PEAR DB problem
Message-ID: <002f01c6909d$c1f63080$0ba8a8c0@cliff>

Every so often, my server seems to "lose" PEAR DB. Why? I have no idea.
I haven't investigated whether the files actually disappear or whether
the dir pointers disappear -- that's next. Running pear install -o DB
makes everything lovely again.
 
I am running PHP5 ZendCore on a VPS.
 
Unless someone is specifically hacking my server and just mucking with
my PEAR DM install, which seems unlikely, I am truly perplexed. Perhaps
some sort of cron job I'm unaware of that is flushing something? Any
thoughts? 
 
I hope you are all enjoying that $25 open bar. In NY -- what a deal.

And all of the above is in the New Yorker hotel, correct? The schedule 
doesn't even mention which room they are in so I'm a little suspicious :)

I'm writing about 20 excel files via php and want to print to the screen the

The problem is the script only displays the status at the end of the whole

Aaron:

The script is running and done before you see it.

If you want it to step through the process, then place a "continue" button within the loop. That way, it will do it's thing and get back to you asking for permission to continue.

This is not that different from the long uploads problem where people try to use progress bars and such to monitor what's happening.

My technique (not original) is simply to provide a "waiting gif", like thus:

For some reason, I could never get flush() to work.  Ended up always
hacking the GUI so things looked like they were working.

few points in the script.

As I recall I've had that problem, too.  I think the fix was related to 
this line from the flush() page at http://php.net/flush

"
flush() has no effect on the buffering scheme of your webserver or the 
browser on the client side. Thus you need to call both ob_flush() and 
flush() to flush the output buffers.
"

I had to leave a little early on Friday, so I may not have had a chance
to say goodbye to everyone.

All in all, the conference was very well done.  Kudos to the organizers
(Hans?).  I especially like seeing Rasmus Lerdorf (my first time) not
just to put a name with a face, but also to hear his insights and
concerns.

I spent most of my time in the more technical track (org track) and
took in some great talks.  While the specific technology talks were
invalualble, I found the "tip-n-tricks" and "best practices" sessions
by John Coggeshall and Laura Thomson to be the best. 

Thanks again for the effort and bringing the Con to NYC.

Thanks Michael... I think it was a success by all measures.  That said, I'm
happy it's over - well until next year anyway.

It certainly isn't easy to do an event in NYC.  Ironically, several weeks
ago I was surveyed by a City business development agency regarding this very
topic.  Perhaps this conference and others from organizations like NYCBUG,
will be a starting point for progress for getting conferences back into the
city.

Thanks all,

Hello,

I am trying to install PHP 5.1.4 on my Windows Computer. Please note that it
is not a Web Server. Its just a simple computer for home use. First of all,
can I even install PHP on this or does it have to be on a web server? Then
what configuration changes do I need to make in order for the PHP files to
run successfully? Does my source code have to be in any particular directory
on my machine and in order to access those pages, what URL do I need to type
in my browser and can I also put my HTML files in the same directory? Please
can you help me?

Thanks.
Sincerely Yours,

Go to php.net 

Find a distro for your platform. 

It will place files into the correct directory which typically was c:\php on
a windows machine. 

 

HTML is different. Do you want to display the HTML in a browser? If so, you
need to install a HTTP server (web server) such as apache. www.apache.org.

Web server install is a separate process. If you do the web server you may
need to tell it about (change a config file setting) to indicate the
presence of a php install.

PHP.net has excellent documentation covering the install of PHP on the
Windows platform, see the following link for instructions:

The user comments on that page contain links to additional tutorials if

I recommend getting one of the prepackaged bundles that include 
Apache, PHP, MySQL, and possibly other things like PERL, Ruby, and/or Python.

The one I use is xampp <http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html>

What is your purpose? It would help to know what you want to do. 

 

To get php go to www.php.net <http://www.php.net/>   You will find an
install distribution for your platform. 

The install will place the PHP language files into a directory which
typically is c:\php on a windows machine. 

 

HTML is different. Do you want to use PHP to make HTML and show it in a
browser? If so, you need to install a HTTP server (web server) such as
Apache. Which can be found at www.apache.org <http://www.apache.org/> . The
apache install is quite straight forward. If you install the web server you
may need to tell it about (change a config file setting) to indicate the
presence of a php install. There are notes on this on the apache site and
also on the php.net site. 

 

Your source can go anywhere if you are only using php. Source goes into a
specific place if you are using a web server and you want to see it in the
browser.

 

A path the php will take care of allowing you to run the php code. PHP like
Basic or other languages has a interpretive mode, is that what you want? If
rather, you want to run the php from a browser, then you are talking about a
web application which requires a web server like Apache.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] QUESTION ABOUT PHP INSTALLATION

 

Hello,

 

I am trying to install PHP 5.1.4 on my Windows Computer. Please note that it
is not a Web Server. Its just a simple computer for home use. First of all,
can I even install PHP on this or does it have to be on a web server? Then
what configuration changes do I need to make in order for the PHP files to
run successfully? Does my source code have to be in any particular directory
on my machine and in order to access those pages, what URL do I need to type
in my browser and can I also put my HTML files in the same directory? Please
can you help me? 

 

Thanks.

Sincerely Yours,

Salman Mazhar.

You can install mysql and php without having to do anything with a web server.
Php can work just as a script language just like perl.

N?stor :-)

Why don't you try to get the latest version of xamp and install it on your

If it's just for development work, use XAMPP or EasyPHP or WAMP. I have 
all three on my Windows notebook and they all work. I like XAMPP the 
best, but that may be because I am comfortable manually configuring 
Apache/PHP anyway. EasyPHP was truly easy.

Sounds like a great opportunity to make a quantum leap and install 
Ubuntu linux as a dual-boot on that Windows machine :-)
If you have decent hard drive space, Ubuntu installs nicely alongside 
windows. There are a few videos on Google (ubuntu windows dual boot) 
that make it trivial to do. Once you do that, you can experience PHP in 
a Linux environment and your learning will be much more valuable. There 
are many, many Free/Open source packages that don't work properly on a 
Windows box and discovering that for yourself can be quite frustrating. 
Instead, every newbie struggle with PHP on Ubuntu will lead to forward 
knowledge momentum... a much better value for your time spent IMHO.

Of course any decent linux would do, but I went with Ubuntu on an 
existing Windows box and it was a breeze.

And put the path ("c:\php" in this case) into your PATH environment 
variable.  My Computer | Properties | Advanced | Environment Variables | 
System Variables.

You don't need to go for a package as others are suggesting.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Custom static extension compilation
Message-ID: <AAB4B3D3CF0F454F98272CBE187FDE2F0AB1072A@is0004avexu1.global.avaya.com>

After trying to compile my custom extension as a dynamic extension, I
decided to try to compile it as a static one. I found out that I have to
copy the directory with the sources and the config.m4 to the ext
directory under the source dir and call ./buildconf --force to rebuild
the configure script. However, doing that built the configure script in
a way that doesn't even compile. My configure command is:
'./configure' '--host=powerpc-wrs-linux-gnu' '--build=i686-linux'
'--prefix=/usr/local' '--disable-all' '--enable-static'
'--disable-shared' '--enable-memory-limit' '--disable-safe-mode'
'--disable-rpath' '--disable-ipv6' '--disable-wddx' '--disable-bcmath'
'--disable-debug' '--disable-calendar' '--disable-ftp'
'--without-aolserver' '--without-apache' '--without-continuity'
'--without-pi3web' '--enable-releasemode' '--enable-xml'
'--cache-file=config.cache' '--enable-libxml'
'--with-libxml-dir=/home/artzi/work/down/temp/target/usr/local'
'--disable-simplexml' '--enable-dom' '--enable-soap' '--with-db'
'--enable-sockets' '--enable-track-vars' '--enable-trans-sid'
'--enable-magic-quotes' '--without-pear' '--with-zlib'
'--with-exec-dir=/usr/local/appweb' '--sysconfdir=/usr/local/appweb'
'--with-gnu-ld' '--with-openssl=/usr' '--enable-mbstring'
'--disable-mbregex' '--enable-session' '--enable-pcntl' '--enable-pdo'
'--with-pdo-sqlite' '--with-pcre-regex' '--enable-spl'
'--enable-tokenizer'
'--with-snmp=/home/artzi/work/down/temp/target/usr/local'
'--enable-ctype' '--with-ctype' '--with-tsrm-pthreads'
'--enable-threadsafe' '--enable-maintainer-zts' '--enable-embed=shared'
'--enable-cgi' '--enable-cli' '--enable-inline-optimization'
 
Before the buildconf, the configure passed fine, but afterwards I got an
error from the PCNTL extension that the system doesn't support fork().
It happened both when cross compiling and when compiling normally.
 
Any idea what is the right way to add an extension as static so it will
compile right?
 
Thanks,
 
Yoav.

And you removed --disable-all? I would try getting rid of all the 
configure options and then adding them one at a time until you figure 
out which one is causing problems. There's way too much information 
there to be able to track down the problem.

Try enable_dl = On  ?

Seems like a silly difference.

Also, php enables dynamic extensions by default. The --disable-all in
your config call might be turning that off...?

I cross compiling to another platform. Using the same configure commnad
it works fine on my i686, but on my PPC box for some reason (same

And you removed --disable-all? I would try getting rid of all the
configure options and then adding them one at a time until you figure
out which one is causing problems. There's way too much information
there to be able to track down the problem.

The enable-dynamic options doesn't exist in PHP 5.1.4, I checked in the
configure file and nada. Thanks anyway.

after you '--disable-all'

Message-ID: <dc1507df0606260954m33427bebl3e54f4a61cbd61a9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all-
I'm working on a mailing list (announcement only) for a client and I'm
trying to decide if using PHP is the way to go. I'm more comfortable
with PHP than with Perl, but it seems that Perl has better email
handling modules available.

When I've worked with PHP mail() before, my experience was that even a
relatively small list of about 50 addresses took a while to loop
through and send. I'm concerned that the server will time out for a
larger list. I'm wondering if I need to make a socket connection.

Can anyone point me in a good direction to research?

Thanks in advance-
Robyn

I believe that if you run the script that sends the emails from the 
command line using say cron that the PHP has no max execution time.  
This may help.

Hello,
Has anyone ever used/using something they like to deal with reading and writing MS Excel files?
Not CSV, but the actual XLS, specifically things like formatting, multiple sheets, etc?
Something like a good xls class, like the one for PDF.
I found something on phpclasses, but would like to get some opnions and suggestions...

Thank you!

Thank you. That's helpful. It makes sense that if I run the script
behind the scenes, not only will it not time out, but the user won't
be affected by the 'long' time it takes to send mail. Since I'm
writing a web application, though, I don't think cron will help -- I
need to run the script (not in the browser) when the user hits "send
to subscribers". Any suggestions on how to do this?

Thanks
Robyn

I've used PHPMailer with a lot of success, and I've heard the Pear Mail
class is good (though I haven't used it).

If it's something you don't mind outsourcing, CampaignMonitor.com is a great
service. Some folks on the list mentioned it a while ago and I really like
it. (and it's very affordable)

Well create a cron job that runs every x amount of minutes that looks

Great! That makes sense.

Still wondering how to let the user know the status of the process
from the browser. Obviously, the browser PHP could check the database
repeatedly to see if the send field is set to 0, but that might create
a long wait also. Additionally, is it reasonable to query the database
in a cron job every minute? Every 5 minutes? The client will probably
only use the app weekly or monthly, but of course it needs to be ready
at any time.

TIA

have the script update a field in the database for the percentage complete.

I wrote an entire backup system using php and a cron'ed script that runs 
every minute, but depending on how fast your client wants these messages 
to go out would depend on how often you run the script.

Now running the script every minute isnt really a big load on the 
database because most of the time its not returning anything.  So if the 
database is index correctly, this will have no effect on the system.

you can run a detached background task by either turning off std out and err:

shell_exec("env -i /your/path/to/php -q -f /your/path/to/script.php >&- <&- 2>&- &");

or directing them to /dev/null:

shell_exec("env -i /your/path/to/php -q -f /your/path/to/script.php  2>>/dev/null >&- <&- >>/dev/null &");

It sounds like you're looking for PEAR Mail_Queue:

For writing XLS Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer is definitely a good option,
I've used in on several projects with great success.

I haven't tried reading/modifying XLS files from php.

Hey Max:

Yeah, the PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer package works, for the most part.
But it exports version 5 of the Excel format, so you're limited to 255 
characters in any one cell.  Joy.

My company has hit this limit and I'm in the middle of rewriting the 
package.  As a temporary stopgap measure, we're exporting the data to the 
XML format used by the Perl/CPAN FromXML package that then converts it to 
Excel.

These new PHP packages we made should eventually be released, but don't 
expect that in the immediate future.

Keeping the user apprised of progress in the back end... Sounds like a
candidate for AJAXification, doesn't it? You could have some Javascript
send an XmlHttpRequest to a back end that reports progress, and update DIV
element with progress information. No? (I'm tentative b/c I'm an AJAX
newbie at best).

More generally, a few months ago I tried writing something similar to what
Robin is attempting and discovered that (at least for me, under my set of
constraints) it was a lot harder than it should have been. The shared host
(pair Networks) doesn't want people mass-emailing with their system, CLI
or otherwise. So I tried running it from my very own box instead, but
because I am clueless and do not have a properly configured mail server,
things were going out with malformed headers and being identified as spam
by a lot of systems on the receiving end, and I got my IP blacklisted by
SpamHaus et al.

The PEAR Mail_Queue class is nice but there's something peculiar to me
about saving the very same message text n times, once for each recipient.
Why?

For writing excel files there are good packages, but for reading, I  
assume, there is not any good package. There is 1 package that can be  
found here http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpexcelreader but it doesn't  
work properly many times. Hence we had to do work around by 1st converting  
Excel files into CSV format.

To convert excel files into CSV there are many packages available but I  
specially like this software  
http://www.45.free.net/~vitus/software/catdoc/ because it is multipurpose  
and can be used to extract plain text from ms-excel, doc and power points  
files as well.

This is actually a software that needs to be installed on your web server  
and to use it you need to run relative commands (which can easily be done  
using php). Worth to have look at it.

Thanks

Hi Robyn,

It seems that basically there is not such package that can satisfy all  
your needs. So either you may combine different different  
packages/software that can serve your purpose or design your own custom  
application.

Your custom application's logic can be divided into 4 steps (scripts)

1: mailScheduler.php
2: sendMail.php
3: checkBounceMail.php
4: mailLog.php

1st and 4th script are intended to run from browser, while 2nd and 3rd are  
 from CLI. Logic can be as mentioned below:

+> "mailScheduler.php" will determine how many mails are to be sent, to  
whom, what content will be etc. It can be, in fact, your regular script  
that can generate above information. Instead of sending those mails  
directly (which is your 1st problem domain), store them in database as it  
is. (i.e in various fields like mail_to, mail_from, mail_content,  
mail_status, date_send etc.) In short mailScheduler.php will insert mail  
related information into database with mail_status=Q (Q means queue).

+> As soon as insertion of data is finished, you can call script  
"sendMail.php" to run from CLI from above script using many methods like  
using functions, using Backtick operator etc. (about how to run PHP script  
in background from command line by executing that command from script  
running in browser). Read reply of "drydell at optonline.net". This script  
will simply read those inserted content from database, maybe do some other  
foo stuffs, and will start sending mail and then it will set value of  
field mail_status=S (S means sent). If you have 10 000 mails to be sent  
then it wont take more than 15 minutes to finish execution in normal case.

+> As soon as execution of above script is finished, either you can call  
3rd script "checkBounceMail.php" immediately from above running CLI script  
to check whether any mails are bounced or not by checking mails from that  
account or schedule that script in Cron to check bounced mail at every  
hour and parsing content of bounced mail and marking status of field  
mail_status=B (B means bounced)

+> 4th script is special script which will manually read content from  
database, at any stage during execution of any 1st, 2nd or 3rd script, and  
will list status of all mails whether Q or S or B according to value of  
filed mail_status (and other information if required). Since this is  
manual script it will need to be clicked in browser in order to display  
desired results. Alternatively if you want automatic results then you can  
make this script to be run from CLI and set it's execution time in Cron  
and it will then notify results via email etc.

By this way, I think within an hour everything will be scanned and report  
can be generated. There are also many other issues to be handled while  
sending mass mails like setting bounced mail address, how to read bounced  
mails etc. but since you have not asked, no need to reply at this moment.

Thanks

Sounds like you want to use PayPal Website Payments Pro:
    https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_wp-pro-overview-outside
You can setup a developers account for free in the PayPal sandbox:
    https://developer.paypal.com/
... where every transaction is fake.

To use this with osC is likely a different module than the regular
PayPal module.

HTH,
Andrew

I believe it is a requirement to be prompted for the option of paying 
via paypal.

You could sign up for paypal "Website Payments Pro." which would allow 
you to present a credit card form directly on your oscommerce checkout 
page. Paypal would process the transaction "transparently" in the 
background. When I was messing around with that a few months back, there 
were 2 plugin modules that supported WPP. Paypal does charge a monthly 
fee for the service and in their written terms of agreement, you are 
supposed to present a "pay with paypal" button on the checkout page as 
an alternate option.

Message-ID: <9db292e90606280816i4f6137c6p2c584e50a986ec7d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Looking for some general advice here...

We have an Oracle 9i database on HPUX.
We access it in three ways
- legacy front end interface (internal users)
- PHP on the HPUX server using OCI calls (internal users)
- through a public web server (LAMP) using XML RPC (public)

We are getting rid of the legacy front end and rewriting the screens in PHP.
Our plan is to use the webserver and move away from servicing web requests
on the DB server.

Questions:
1. We've only used XML-RPC on a small scale and are not sure whether to
continue with this approach. Having said that, it's simple and it works. But
what about SOAP ? We have no experience of it but "feel" we should be using
it.

2. XML-RPC has proved fine for just calling stored procedures on the DB
server but should we be using something like ADODB which would potentially
make coding/designing a lot easier if we want to go the whole data
abstraction route. This however uses OCI calls to the database.
The webserver will be in the public domain. Is it safe to connect to the
production DB using OCI calls ?

Any advice would be appreciated
Thanks

Mike

You can't do this. Even if you adopt the more advanced APIs (see other
messages in the thread), you must legally also offer payments via
PayPal.

In general, this is a good idea, as sites that offer both have higher
completion rates than one that just offer credit card
payments. (PayPal has done tests of what happens when existing sites
with just credit cards processing add in a PayPal option.)

If you're looking for a credit card only option, you need to get
merchant account. (AFAIK.) One such option is Verisign's payment
processing unit, which, oddly enough, is now part of PayPal. :)

Hey there,

          I have a question/concern ... the XML-RPC "server" is written
in PHP I assume, if so you'll still be making OCI calls anyway.

As far as security is concerned, it starts with you.  Always carefully
evaluate/filter your query variables/strings for valid data before
sending it to the database.  That applies to your webpages and the
XML-RPC.

 

Regards,

-Eddy

I'm not even sure what I was trying to say...

 

If you want to take advantage of data abstraction, take a look at PDO.
Ilia gave a good presentation at the conference going over it's merits
... e.g. "it's completely written in C, so you know it's pretty fast!"

Simple and it works?  Stick with it...

SOAP is quite complex, and while it may feel right now, once you start using
it, that feeling may quickly change.  And since this is internal, the added
complexity of publishing services, will likely get in the way.  Plus, you're
team is likely comfortable with XML-RPC already, so at this stage, it
probably doesn't make sense to bring in another new learning curve.

Since it appears as though you are working with a single database technology
- Oracle - why abstract?  Sure, people will say "well, there's a chance
we're going to change the database at some point."  Ok, but database changes
aren't trivial - you don't hot-swap a database out for another technology -
and using an "abstracted" database access method will be the least of the
migration.

As Eddy pointed out, security is a very large picture.  But done right,
sure, it could be safe.  OCI is one of the most mature and heavily tested
database connection methods out there, and again, you have the expertise
already (which is usually the toughest part of OCI), so you're more likely
to do it right, than with a new technology.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] apache2/php5 and include ( ) paths
Message-ID: <44A33F07.7040304@clickfacts.com>

Hi all,
  Perhaps someone can help me out with a weird error I am experiencing. 
I've installed Apache2, PHP5, MySQL5 on a WindowsXP machine and 
everything works like a charm. Except when I try to use php.exe from 
command line. If I execute a php file from command prompt using the 
php.exe, if the include/require paths are not entirely hardcoded 
(c:\AppServ\www ...) but are dynamically set (../../config.php): it 
throws errors.

Warning: include_once(../../config.php): failed to open stream: No such 
file or directory in c:\AppServ\www\fill_combination.php on line 10

However, if I put the same into the browser, it works, but from local 
command line I get path errors. Any ideas? I am at the end of my wits.

Thanks,
mikhail

What happens when you add the -C flag to the mix?  From what I recall  
on windows you path is actually set  where your interpreter is setup  
(ie c:/php5/php.exe) so your 'document root' in that case is really  
c:/php5.  I could be wrong, trying running a print_r($_SERVER) from  
your CLI program to see what differences you get.

Are you using PHP via Cygwin?

Are we allowed to rant on here?
 
So I have been trying very hard to heed some management advice:
"Sometime it's best not to look under the hood." Of course I should know
better as last time I tried that strategy, I threw a crank rod --
literally.
 
But look I did... That's interesting an echo value in a text input
field. Ok, no big deal; it's not a echo post or get. Trace
backwards...surprise, surprise...the assignment was made earlier with no
filtering or escaping. As it was in the other 6,000 lines of code!
 
Oh the joys of sub-contracting. It is going to be an unpleasant July 4th
weekend. As I said, Filter Input, Escape Output Stinks.
 
Hey, at least it may be raining anyway...

Jon,
You're completely right. When running  print_r($_SERVER) from the 
localhost browser I get
$_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] = C:/AppServ/www
however, when running it from command line it's empty.

Perhaps excuse the naive question, but how do I set C:/AppServ/www as 
the Document root for when I run files from the command line?

Thank you again,
Mikhail

If you need to be able to access include files, you have 2 options:

1. set the include paths dynamically
2. change to the directory of the script

in both cases, you'll find the construct:

basename(__FILE__);

very handy, eg:

directory of your script: basename(__FILE__);
parent directory: basename(basename(__FILE__));
parent of that directory: basename(basename(basename(__FILE__)));
etc...

then you can either do something along the lines of:

ini_set('include_path',basename(__FILE__));

or:

chdir(basename(__FILE__));

at the top of the script you are executing from the command line.

Hello Everyone,

I need help with updating an existing data in MySQL through PHP. I want to add a certain amount to an already existing data in a field. For example, in a field called "numbers", in that record, there's already a value of "500". I want to know how I can add "50" to that record so that it becomes "550". 

Help will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] FPDF/FPDI template size too small
Message-ID: <44A57820.7020408@email.smith.edu>

Greetings,

I am working with the FPDF and FPDI classes and have run into an issue. 
  When I import a pdf to use as a template it comes in smaller than it's 
original size.  I have specified the size of the template to be full 
page and set the margins for the pdf page to zero but the issue remains.

Code excerpt:

$pdf->SetMargins(0,0,0);
$pdf->addPage();
$pdf->useTemplate($tplidx,0,0,215.9,279.4);

(Unit measurements 215.9 and 279.4 are in mm, equivalent to specifying 
8.5 x 11 inches.)

Has anyone working with the FPDI class noticed an issue with the 
template size?  Workarounds or suggestions?

Thanks,

-Aaron

I am not sure what if anything you might be doing wrong, but a few months
ago I gnawed on the demo/example that ships with the Fpdi class until I
got it to open a PDF doc test_pdf.pdf and generate a new one using
test_pdf.pdf as a template, with some text inserted in a specific
position. (this is substantially the same snippet I put out here a few
weeks ago in response to another question, sorry for the redundancy). If I
remember correctly, the demo (before I hacked it up) explicitly resets the
dimensions -- you don't want to do that. HTH.

define('FPDF_FONTPATH','../font/');
require('./fpdi.php');
$pdf= new fpdi();
$pdf->setTextColor(255,0,0);
$pdf->setSourceFile("./test_pdf.pdf");
$tplidx = $pdf->ImportPage(1);
$pdf->addPage();

I need help with updating an existing data in MySQL through PHP. I want to add a certain amount to an already existing data in a field. For example, in a field called "numbers", in that record, there's already a value of "500". I want to know how I can add "50" to that record so that it becomes "550". 

Help will be greatly appreciated.
