Then at least I could outsource myself to someone local (rimshot)

In all honesty, I think the toughest part in this city is developing
the contacts. Once that is done, your talent and work ethic will take
care of the rest, and give back what you put into it.

A funny sidenote - in the Mambo universe there is a horrible slant
regarding talent on the template making side, where anyone and
everyone is promoting themselves as 'Mambo template specialists'. Even
when they suck. What blows me away is that there are still floods of
people in panic mode because they cannot get a template put together
in time, or need someone to setup a Mambo and import their (usually
static) content.

So if you know anything about PHP, HTML and Mambo, you should be doing
just fine ;-) Take on the $300 template gigs, and eventually you will
establish a reputation. If that is a good reputation, then you should
not have to look for work anymore, and people will find you looking
for Mambo help, which of course ups your rate.

You will NOT however find the $150/hr stuff as a Mambo template guy.
Those gigs are almost exclusively with the financial research firms
and so on, and it is very hard work that (occasionally at least) is
not worth it.

I would rather spit out Mambo-based products.
