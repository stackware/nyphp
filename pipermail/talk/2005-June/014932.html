<PRE>Joseph-
 
if you're interested in the practice of software development, two classics
that have been highly recommended to me are:
- code complete
- mythical man month
i also would also suggest kent beck's eXtreme Programming (XP) book, as XP
practices, especially test-driven development, have been very helpful for
me.

Ophir,

could you recommend any books that are directed towards software engineering
or software development?  As you said most people are fine with coding but
dont have the necessary knowledge in this area.  That is me :).

I have gone through book after book and taken the zend course so PHP is not
new to me but when i try to get into a large project i find myself lost in
the planning stages.  I know how it should work and can make it work but i
am sure it's not going to be coded the proper way.

I have no CS background..  are there any books i could pickup to get some of
this knowledge as well?  I am looking to forward my knowledge in PHP but
other aspects as well.

I know the easiest answer is to go to college but the largest obstacle wirh
that is time and money. :(
