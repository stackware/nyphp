Hi Chris,

 

Those who have taken the course are welcome to give feedback, but for specific questions we have a form:

 

<A HREF="http://www.nyphp.org/content/training/training_info.php">http://www.nyphp.org/content/training/training_info.php</A>

 

since we'd prefer not to clutter already busy lists.

 

Thanks,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] NYPHP Courses

 

The NYPHP pages seem to point me here with any questions on the courses, so if anyone can help I'd appreciate it. Essentially I'm trying to figure out which course I should take, leaning towards the two-day &quot;programmers track&quot; as opposed to leaping right into one of the intensive 2-hour RAMP courses (e.g. the February course on OOP in PHP). 

To this point, totally self-taught (with the help of some of the authors who frequent this very list), I've used php mainly as &quot;glue&quot; to automate, say, photo galleries and for mail forms and the like. I've written a few sites that included database abstraction layers to interact with small MySQL databases - I'm pretty comfortable with SQL, but I am having trouble getting a useful grasp on Classes and object-oriented php in general (I wasn't a CS major). I would say my comfortable vocabulary of built-in functions is rudimentary - I always need a reference open. On the other hand, I run my own linux webserver and have been using linux as my desktop for almost a decade and until gmail made it painfully obsolete, my main (web) email client was a php app I wrote.

My worry is that the two-day course is going to be too basic, though, like &quot;Now we're going to write our first F-U-N-C-T-I-O-N.&quot; Can anyone give me a sense of the level of the course? I don't have a generous employer to pay my tuition; it will be coming out of my own pocket, so I want to make sure I'm not taking the wrong course. I do feel that I've kind of run into a wall in my auto-didactical regimen and could be well served by merely _talking_ with other people who use these tools. Lately I've set my php books aside in frustration, distracting myself by writing greasemonkey scripts. If it's a useful bit of info, web programming/designing is not my day job (yet), though I do make some money doing it. 

Thanks,
Chris
