<PRE>The NYPHP pages seem to point me here with any questions on the courses, so 
if anyone can help I'd appreciate it. Essentially I'm trying to figure out 
which course I should take, leaning towards the two-day &quot;programmers track&quot; 
as opposed to leaping right into one of the intensive 2-hour RAMP courses (
e.g. the February course on OOP in PHP). 

To this point, totally self-taught (with the help of some of the authors who 
frequent this very list), I've used php mainly as &quot;glue&quot; to automate, say, 
photo galleries and for mail forms and the like. I've written a few sites 
that included database abstraction layers to interact with small MySQL 
databases - I'm pretty comfortable with SQL, but I am having trouble getting 
a useful grasp on Classes and object-oriented php in general (I wasn't a CS 
major). I would say my comfortable vocabulary of built-in functions is 
rudimentary - I always need a reference open. On the other hand, I run my 
own linux webserver and have been using linux as my desktop for almost a 
decade and until gmail made it painfully obsolete, my main (web) email 
client was a php app I wrote.

My worry is that the two-day course is going to be too basic, though, like 
&quot;Now we're going to write our first F-U-N-C-T-I-O-N.&quot; Can anyone give me a 
sense of the level of the course? I don't have a generous employer to pay my 
tuition; it will be coming out of my own pocket, so I want to make sure I'm 
not taking the wrong course. I do feel that I've kind of run into a wall in 
my auto-didactical regimen and could be well served by merely _talking_ with 
other people who use these tools. Lately I've set my php books aside in 
frustration, distracting myself by writing greasemonkey scripts. If it's a 
useful bit of info, web programming/designing is not my day job (yet), 
though I do make some money doing it. 

Thanks,
Chris
