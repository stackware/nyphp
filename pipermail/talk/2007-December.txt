What do you mean by "the function closest to the top of the stack is 
selected?"  You can only have one __autoload() function in your code 
base otherwise you'll get a fatal error.  Also __autoload() does whatever 
you program it to do.

No, autoload is not meant to be called directly.  I didn't say using 
autoload is a best practice, though that doesn't mean that it isn't a 
good/best practice.


> Do you use spl_autoload_register, and if so, how?

I have not.  I just manually declare it the "normal" way in my 
functions.inc file:

function __autoload($class) {}

I think you're over-complicating things.

Then you haven't written good code.  For example, you can "namespace" 
your functions and classes by prefixing or postfixing them with something 
unique, like the initials of your company.

Try something like

$cmd= "/usr/bin/wget -P/tmp --post-data 
'subscribees=$email&adminpw=$password&send_welcome_msg_to_this_batch=0&send_notifications_to_list_owner=0' 
http://www.emdrhap.org/mailman/admin/$list/members/add";
print $cmd;
system($cmd,$returnval);

to see if there might be something funky going on with the command line. 
Have you properly escaped the $list, $email, and $password? If a space 
creeps up in there it could throw it all off.

If all else fails, you might want to try the CURL functions to post and 
retrieve data from a remote script.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] switch cases
Message-ID: <47519896.7050907@gmx.net>

Hi!

I make use of a switch statement, but now need to execute the same code of one 
case for a different case (it is a switch on a file type and some types are to 
be handled the same). I know how to craft this case using if, but how would I 
do that with using case within a switch?
Is it something like this
switch ($a) {
	case 'a' or 'b':
		// this is for the case that $a is 'a' or 'b'
	case 'c':
		// this is for the case that $a is 'c'
	default:
		// this is for the case that $a is neither 'a', 'b', or 'c'
}

For now I duplicate the code as that for sure works, but that seems to be not 
that great in case I need to change something within the block of code (have 
to do it in two places). The PHP manual doesn't cover this case.

Any tips are greatly appreciated.

	David

You would list each case, one after another:

switch ($a) {
        case 'a':
        case 'b':
//
//    stuff for 'a' or 'b'
//
          break;
        case 'c':
//
//      .....
//
             break;
        default:
}

I've found the following useful if you don't want to use a bunch of if /
else if but you need to do more than a simple comparison:

switch(true) {
  case ($a=='a') : // Behaves like a normal switch
    break;
  case ($a===1) : // Strict check
    break;
  case ($a>$b) : // Do whatever test you'd like
    break;
}

Thank you all for your suggestions.   

Although I have no idea why the old script stopped working on the new
server,  I was able to accomplish the same task with CURL functions.

Thank you again!

Good to read that you got it working. I was following some time ago advice 
from NYPHP and also made use of cURL, which worked out nicely. That is one of 
the many reason I like PHP. It has an answer for about everything, cooks your 
breakfast, and is easy to learn.

One of the periods ends five minutes after the next period begins, it's 
the fourth from the bottom.  That suggests another post later on about 
constraints :)

Ken already replied to this, however...

There is a trick to figuring it out that is really
lazy, and doesn't involve scanning with your eyes but
scanning with the database itself.  Here's a quick
hint: Ken formatted the data such that column by
column there is a specific delimiter, a pipe ("|"),
and row by row there is a specific delimiter, an
endline.  That means it is trivial to parse it into
insert statements on a database.

Why not only follow along with Ken's tutorial, but
create a database on your home computer and build the
sample one table database.

I won't say any more because it would be stealing
Ken's thunder.

Thanks for the tips, my query :-P was not made after giving the problem a
real try, I thought the solution would be presented in the second post.

I need to produce charts and graphs in PHP for a web site. I have  
googled and see a lot of things out there. It would be very helpful  
to get some recommendations on what's best to use in open source to

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP Question -- SID in Oracle
Message-ID: <475553B7.70303@vassar.edu>


My question is:  how can I accurately capture and display the name of 
the db to which I am connected?

We use Oracle here.  If you know of a solid online resource for 
PHP/Oracle guidance which I can tap, please redirect.

I'm developing a little application connected to our pre-production 
database.  Once the application is live I'll be pointing it to the live 
database.  In the interim I'd like to note on the screen which database 
the user is connected to so that the folks beta testing are kept aware 
(and don't stress out when they've deleted several things they didn't 
intend to remove).

I am attempting to use the getenv function for this purpose:

$ORACLE_SID = getenv("ORACLE_SID");

  but when I echo it

echo "ORACLE_SID = $ORACLE_SID<br>";

It shows that I am connected to the live database when I am certain (I 
checked both the connection params and all the data after posting 
changes) I am connected to pre-production.



Thanks either way.  I am searching via other sources too.

I don't know about the variable your asking about, but looking over 
http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/php/pdf/underground-php-oracle-manual.pdf 
the examples I see there the database name is specified when the 
connection is made, so wouldn't that be where to set the name to display 
to the user?

Dear Gary,

Yes.  I can  set the database name while making the connection. I use an 
include file for the connection and make a small change just  to the 
name of the SID when I want to point the whole shebang to the production 
data.

My problem is that the SID name I return in using getenv is wrong.

But you gave me a really good idea.  Instead of using the standard oci 
connection

$Ora_conn = OCILogon(DB_USER,DB_PASS,DB_NAME) or die ("Couldn't Connect 
to Oracle");


which uses the define that follows:


define('DB_NAME' , '(DESCRIPTION =

                    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 
somemachinehere.vassar.edu)(PORT = XXXX))

                    (CONNECT_DATA = (SID = testserverX)))');

define('DB_USER','myadminuserid');

define('DB_PASS','myadminuserpassword');



I could instead use: $conn = OCILogon($dbuser, $dbpass, $dbtns);

$dbuser = 'myadminuserid';
$dbpass = 'myadminpassword';
$dbtns = 'testerverX';

and $dbtns  is a variable I can recall accurately.  This is fine as long 
as the web app can resolve the TNS on it's own (in the config)

I am playing with this and am hopeful that it will work

I guess the question I was driving out is what /sets/ the getenv 
variable to begin with.

 From glancing through the docs, I didn't see that mentioned.  Generall, 
an environmental variable is set by the server prior to the script even 
being executed.  In which case, that SID is really just your server 
setup being "helpful" and expecting you to use the environmental 
variable in your connection statement.

It doesn't actually mean or represent anything beyond what Oracle 
connection information the server thinks most PHP scripts run on it 
would want to use.

In short, the SID is a broken clock, it will be right twice a day(when 
your using the database the server is configured to use) but otherwise 
it is useless information for you.

Instead, I'd build up the connection string in a more procedural manner, 
such as:

define('DB_NAME' , 'testserverX');
define('DB_SERVER' , 'somemachinehere.vassar.edu');
define('DB_PORT' , 'XXXX');
define('DB_CONNECTION' , '(DESCRIPTION =

                   (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = '. DB_SERVER . 
')(PORT = '.DB_PORT.'))
                   (CONNECT_DATA = (SID ='.DB_NAME.' )))');
So if you want to display something conditional in the program, for example:
if (DB_NAME == 'testserverX') {
echo "<font color='red'><h2>You are using the test server, updates will 
not affect live data!</h2></font>";
}

Than you can(and yes, 'proper' formatting of the above would be to use 
CSS to define the text size and text color rather than embedding ugly 
old h2 and font tags.  I'm just too lazy to write out all the styling in 
an email message.)

You might consider creating a table called version_info
(or something like that) with things in it like last date of
modification to the schema, and maybe whether the database
is for QA, Dev, or Production.

Then you can check if you're in the right place.

(I mean instead of just relying on access denied when
someone mungs the config file and forgets to point it
to right SID)

Message-ID: <f32de7f50712040959h1e218e98i500dd83e68997863@mail.gmail.com>

sent on behalf of a co-worker....


I am building a zip code area UI.

For instance, a resource is assigned a range of zip codes that they can
recruit prospective clients from.

The table fields are: RESOURCE_CODE | ZIPCODE

Each available zip code is listed with the relative resource code.

My problem is the query.  On the UI end I don't want to list all 1000 zips
for a resource, I'd like to show ranges where possible (e.g. 07748;
07750-07790) in a delimited format. I can then do the inserts without any
issues.

Is there a way in Oracle to recognize row values that have an increment of
one from the previous row in order to split them into a range? Therefore, if
I wanted the zips from code M99 it would return any single zips and ranges
(07750-07790) as opposed to listing them individually.

Requested Row Output Example:

Row1: 07748

Row2: 07750-07790

And so on..


I can do this with PHP, but I figure if Oracle can do it the application
would be a lot faster.

I believe another way to do this would be to change the chapter table to
have low and high values, but I'd still have the problem of initially
populating the new table with the ranges.

Also, I'm sure there are other ways do this. If I'm off track please guide
me.


Thanks for your help.

If I want to redirect domain.com to www.domain.com (or for that matter

the following so far:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain\.com$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/$1 [L, R=301]
</IfModule> 

But what about https? How can I make the redirect work for both http and
https transactions, redirecting http to http and https to https?

Hello,

Looks good to me. Maybe the where clause is never getting met.

Does it generate an error when you paste the resulting query into the MySQL 
Query Browser? When I craft queries I often test them first using the query 
browser. That way I can find out much quicker what is going wrong and modified 
the query there and test again before changing it in code.
Just looking at things I cannot see anything wrong, but pipe it into the query 
browser and see what happens. If you don't like the MySQL tools, take a look 
at EnginSiteSite's MySQL client. What MySQL splits into three tools is in 
EnginSite's single client.

Also, when looking at the table, did you refresh the view? If you use the 
MySQL query browser to look and edit the table values you need to refresh the 
query result to see any changes.


Regardless of all that, you can write echos just like this:
echo 'Some text';
or if you ever happen to use the \n and don't want to make sure that you don't 
forget to use the " for that case, just use the " all the time as in
echo "Some text";
And make use of concatenating strings when you want to output an entire block, 
such as
echo "Line 1".
      "Line 2".
      "Line 3";
Which is what you already do with the break tag. You can also concatenate 
strings with it. I also use the echo for small pieces of static HTML as I find 
that to be easier to deal with than having the >?php ?> tags floating around. 
Yes, it is slower, but I guess for our pruposes we can spare that millisecond 
for now.

Shouldn't the first rule use port 80 instead of 443?

Perhaps I am reading this wrong, but it appears you are calling
mysql_query() using a variable called $sql which never has a value (thus
executing no query at all), and then in the next line of code you are
setting $query equal to your query.

Try doing $rs = mysql_query ($query, $conn); after you assign the string to
$query.

The first rule uses not 443.

There's a ! on the 443, so it should work. Otherwise ^80

Just seems like a strange way to write it:


	if (not port 443)


is not logically the same as:


	if (port 80)

You make a good point.  The original will not work for ports other
than 80 even though it looks like it might, I think it would be better
to write the script like this:

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^www\.example\.com$ [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^$
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT}  ^80$
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$  http://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L]

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^www\.example\.com$ [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^$
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT}  ^443$
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$  https://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L]

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^www\.example\.com$ [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^$
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT}  !^443|80$
RewriteRule ^/(.*)$  http://www.example.com:%{SERVER_PORT}/$1 [R=301,L]

This way http://foo.example.com:8080/ -> http://www.example.com:8080/.

John

Gents/Ladies - 
 
Some help please with my PHP5 OOP learning curve:
 
I'm trying to use a $this variable to call a function within a class.  I
know the following works:
 
class actions {
 
 private $_aData;
 private $_table;
 
 public function __construct(){
    $this->_aData=array();
    $this->_table=FALSE;
 }
 
 private function update(){
  echo 'Update being executed!';
  return TRUE;
 }
 
//public functions ==================================
    public function do_action($table,$data){
     //direct action activity
     //assumption: $data['action'] will contain action definition
     $this->_table=$table;
     $this->_aData=$data;
     
     $completed=self::update();  //<==  THIS IS THE PROBLEM LINE
     
     return $completed;
     
    }
}
 
When I change that line to "$completed=self::$this->_aData['action'].'()';"
(which contains the string 'update'), the line is read, but nothing happens.
When I add "$action=$this->_aData['action'].'()';", then change the line to
"$completed=self::$action;", I get the following error message:
Fatal error: Access to undeclared static property: actions::$action in
C:\Program Files\Apache Software
Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs\cjmea\hs_choir\classes\class.actions.php5 on
line 37.
 
All help is appreciated!

Hi - I don't have an answer on this, but a good article on mod Rewrite was
in the latest issue of PHP|architect.  Advise if you need a copy.

If I want to redirect domain.com to www.domain.com (or for that matter
anything.domain.com to www.domain.com I have figured out (but not tested)
the following so far:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain\.com$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.domain.com/$1 [L, R=301]
</IfModule> 

But what about https? How can I make the redirect work for both http and
https transactions, redirecting http to http and https to https?

Have you tried using a callback?

If the function name passed to do_action is declared within the current
object you should be able to perform the following:

call_user_func($this,'update');

Check out the section on callbacks:

http://us.php.net/callback

and the function call_user_func:

http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php

Try $completed=$this->update()

Update is not a static function. If you want to use self, use static
function update().....

Hi Cliff - Thanks.  Maybe I'm using the wrong implementation here.   My
design is that $this->_aData['action'] could resolve to an 'update',
'insert' or 'delete' request and thus be directed to the appropriate
function.  I didn't want to use a literal, but have the decision made by the
calling routine.
 
Best Regards - 
 
Rick

Try $completed=$this->update()

Update is not a static function. If you want to use self, use static
function update().....

Paul:

Several issues, including basic logic and security matters.

* calling mysql_query() without setting $sql.
* setting $query without ever calling mysql_query().
* not using mysql_real_escape_string() on values you're putting in the 
SQL string.
* echoing input out as HTML without using htmlspecialchars().
* you're setting all sorts of variables with values from other 
pre-existing variables.  This wastes time and makes things harder to 
follow.
* learn about XHTML rather than the old-world HTML.

What Cliff was trying to explain was you wrote the class' update() method 
to be called from an instantiated object, using the "->" syntax.  But 
you're calling it as a static method via the "::" syntax.  You need to 
pick one way or the other and carry it through the whole implementation.

Static and :: are covered here:

Here's what you're looking for.  Also... my two cents... name your  
class something less common than actions and capitalize your class  
names - this helps with readability and making it clear that something  
is a class.  Use protected instead of private unless you really need  
visibility contained to the current class for some reason.  If you  
extended your actions class, the new class wouldn't be able to access  
the private methods and variables.

<?php

class RetzkoActions
{
     protected $_aData;
     protected $_table;

     public function __construct()
     {
         $this->_aData = array();
         $this->_table = false;
     }

     protected function update()
     {
         echo "Update being executed!\n";
         return true;
     }

     public function do_action($table, $data)
     {
         $this->_aData = $data;
         $this->{$this->_aData['action']}();

         // as you can see this is hard to read...
         // so it's probably worth doing this
         $action = $this->_aData['action'];
         $this->$action();
     }
}

$instance = new RetzkoActions();
$instance->do_action('someTable', array('action' => 'update'));

?>

You need to find out the latitude and longitude of the zip codes.   
That's the only way.

You can purchase zipcode databases that will give you the latitude and  
longitude.  Usually it's something you get a subscription for so you  
can be updated when zipcodes change.  My company uses this service:
http://www.zipcodeworld.com

An alternative to purchasing your own zipcode database, is to use a  
web service to get the latitude and longitude:
http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/rest/V1/geocode.html

Rasmus Lerdorf (creator of php) even posted a great article on how to  
use that web service:
http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/35-GeoCool!.html

Once you have the latitude and longitude, you want to search google  
for "distance latitude longitude php."  The first hit is  
coincidentally the site that sells the zipcode databases:
http://www.zipcodeworld.com/samples/distance.php.html

If you go the route of buying a subscription to the zipcode database  
(probably only if you have too high a level of web traffic to use the  
Yahoo! ), you should import the CSV file into a mysql database.   
Donald J Organ IV just posted a mysql query to this list last week  
that can find all the zipcodes in a range:

You need to calculate the distance between the centroids of the zip
codes. Zip codes centroids (lat,lng pairs) are free and published.
(Search for "zip code centroid")

1) import the zip code data into your database
2) Use a formula to calculate the distance between the lat,lng pairs.
(just google for "haversine formula")

I assume you can fill in the rest, but let me know if that is not enough.

John Campbell

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL/Flash/Apostrophe issue
Message-ID: <1197051180.7635@coral.he.net>

Hi Everyone,

This is my first post to the list and I appreciate any feedback, 
thanks.

I'm debugging a site someone else built in PHP & MySQL and on a few 
places in the site, there are Flash applets (.swf files) that are 
directly pulling strings from the MySQL database.

The previous programmers neglected to properly handle apostrophes and 
there are many text strings displayed in the .swf files, unfortunately 
what exists now is that whenever an apostrophe occurs, it cuts off the 
rest of the string.

One thing that I tried was to go into the MySQL database itself and 
add the escape character before the apostrophes, this resulted in the 
display of the encoded HTML for the apostrophe and not the actual 
apostrophe.  

Is there any trick with MySQL which I'm not aware of that will enable 
me to fix this without decompiling the .swf file just for this (which 
I really, really do not want to do)?

Well, it sounds like the apostrophe was properly escaped when placed 
into the MySQL database.  If it is escaped, it doesn't store the escape 
charector in the database, it stores it as it is.

What I'm guessing you need to do is escape/convert the apostrophe for 
Flash/Actionscript.

At a guess, since Flash is so HTML centric, try converting the ' to &#39;

Have you looked at the action script in flash? It may just be an easy fix
there too.

Yes it's definitely a flash issue.  I will replace the apostrophes in 
the strings with &#39; before database insert and let you know how 
that works!

Hi Kristina,

PHP has a function to take care of this for you: mysql_escape_string

Don't replace the single quotes in the database. Use the  
htmlentities() function on the output with the ENT_QUOTES option. This  
will replace the quotes (and other symbols) with the appropriate "&"  
strings.

That's not her problem. That escapes quotes and other symbols so they  
can be stored in the database. Her problem is that the single quote is  
disrupting the output. Escaping it with a backslash won't help.

If memory serves me right, Flash doesn't adhere to the HTML or ASCII entities, 
at least it didn't a few years back when I ran into this issue. What I did is 
replace the characters with the ones that Flash understands before writing it 
to the database alongside with the properly escaped 'real' string. In my case 
the strings were pulled from an XML by Flash and not from a database, so that 
and the fact that my encounters are years past may put a different spin on 
this. So if you get something, but not what you expected, this could be the 
reason why.

Thanks Ken, so what you're saying is there is no way to do this 
without going into the .swf file itself.

By the way -- 

$caption = str_replace("'", "&#39;", $caption)

yields record in database of

A Reporter&#39;s Life

Displays in Flash applet as

A Reporter&amp;#39;s Life

(it's encoding the & apparently).

A swf file cannot directly access the database because it runs on the
client side (I'll assume you are not using remoting).  The swf
accesses a php script on the server that outputs something.  There are
two major methods, load vars and xml.

My guess is that the php script outputs data for flash's load vars.
In that case the quotes need to be urlencoded not htmlencoded.  Try
$caption = url_encode($caption)

John Campbell

allowScriptAccess is set to "sameDomain" but the name of any script

Do you use firebug?  You need to open the page, and look through the
list of downloaded files (firebug is the way I do it, it is built in
in Safari, and I don't have a clue for IE).  From there you probably
guess at which request is providing the data.  To do this with
firebug, just open it, and click on the "Net" tab.  It will show you a
list of every thing that was downloaded to render the page.  You can
even inspect the contents of each request.

If you want, just post a link and I'll let you know what scripts the
flash is accessing, what they return, and why there is an error.

John Campbell

I don't think you can do any of that sort of thing with IE...what a 
piece of sh%t it truly is.  Is there any Windows software that can 
give me this functionality?

firefox with the firebug extension.  Now that I think about it, you
can also use the IE7 developer toolbar (which is modeled after
firebug).

If you do need to use IE, Fiddler is pretty useful to intercept and manage
requests... http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/
Also, the IE developer toolbar is helpful.

I had to get something like this working a few weeks ago and ended up 
using Google Maps. It's not an elegant solution but it works and it's 
free. Go to Google Maps and do a search. Do something like 74354 to 
70601. You will notices that on the left hand panel of the returned page 
will be something like Drive: 602 mi. Look at the HTML generated. You 
can parse that and get the distance. Pretty simple actually.

Hope it helps,

Message-ID: <BAY143-W212C9715CB44A83B5F0EE0D3690@phx.gbl>


Hello,

I have apache 2 , php5 on windows 2003 server. I want to execute the external command like,

system( 'c:/PHP/safedir/pdftk.exe C:/AppServ/www/mylegalwork/images/pdf_files/PROD-5298b6/MLW_Demo_Form_1.pdf  dump_data_fields > C:/AppServ/www/mylegalwork/images/pdf_files/PROD-5298b6/rizwan')

basicaly pdftk.exe is pdf utility. I have put it in safe directory. The problem is when i try to access the page its not execute the command. I have try it with passthru, exec and with shell_command but all do nothing. Its working fine on my local machine and on linux server where i install pdftk but on windows 2003 server its not working. I have found an article at http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=20951 which says there is security issue thats why its not allow php to execute the command. If anyone of you know anything about it than do let me know. I really want to run the command.



Thanks

If you're going to do that you should use Google's API, otherwise when they
make a change to their HTML your code will fail.

Here's a more efficient method: use this guy's free class file. I've
used it for similar solutions, and it's pretty easy to hack to make it
fit into whatever architecture you need. The code is fairly
straightforward.

On w2k3 getting exec() to work is a PITA.  If you are running fastcgi
you will have to give that user permission to execute cmd.exe.  Since it
will be running as a network service PHP needs to execute both the
program and cmd.exe.  First I would try and figure out who is requesting
the file (who do you have PHP running as) and then give that user access
to cmd.exe.  Also you can use "filemon" to figure that out.

Hope this helps.

That's REALLY dangerous.  Services like Apache should have very minimal 
permissions.

Message-ID: <475CF7B8.4080801@adcl.biz>

Hello Everyone,

I have a problem that I'm hoping someone here can help me solve. It's 
plagued me for a while now and, to be honest, I'm not terribly sure 
there actually is a workable solution. Here's the deal.

I have a 'secret santa' type application that I designed for a Yahoo 
Group my wife owns.  The way it works is that people go to the site, 
enter their email address and are randomly matched with some other 
person. The two filtering criteria for the match are 1) the persons 
match can't be taken )as indicated in an 'isTaken' field) and 2) the 
persons match can't be themselves.

The systems works very well unless there are an odd number of people on 
the list. Then, one person is left out. We've just run into this problem 
a few minutes ago. There are 7 people on the list and everyone is owned 
by someone else except one person.

Any idea how I can make this workable on an odd numbered list?
Your help is really appreciated.

Thanks,
Anthony Papillion

Do they have to be matched as pairs? If so, then it's simply not 
possible. If they only need to be matched to another person, then pick 
any pair off the list (Santa A & B) and the left out Santa (C) and match 
A->B, B->C, C->A

Hi Rolan,

Thanks for the input. Works like a charm. I was approaching the problem 
from the wrong angle.  Thanks again.

you should probably randomize the entire list and do an 
A->B,B->C,C->D,D->E, etc.. instead of pairing up because by the 4th or 
5'th gift, people might catch on that all their gift givers are paired 
together (not that it really matters but...)

Message-ID: <475D6423.1090605@projectskyline.com>

Hello All,

I'm going to be storing some simple data in an xml file.

The data will have information for session, including username/passwords.

I want to encrypt the username & password associated w/the session.

What's the easiest method/functions to do this? I've only done md5 and 
matched
the input against the stored string.

The program would:
1) Prompt the user for the password when starting. This is the password 
used to decrypt all sessions,
and has nothing to do w/the stored/encrypted password.
2) Decrypt the session data in the xml files
3) Store the decrypted session data in memory.
4) Only if the user changes the session username/password would I write 
to the file (the encrypted) version.


Thanks,

- Ben

Hi Ben,

So the password in 1) is the decryption key, right? PHP's mcrypt
functions will allow you to encrypt and decrypt using AES or Blowfish
in CBC mode, which is most likely what you want.

I give this advice with a _huge_ grain of salt, do not proceed unless
you feel fully informed about the practical application of
cryptography.

Hi, I'm the speaker from last week's NYPHP talk on cryptography.

1) SLIDES

Sorry for delay.  I will be posting my slides shortly!  I've been reworking
them and getting source code online.  I will post here when they are up.



2) ENCRYPTED SESSIONS


Most importantly, before any technical questions is "what threats are you
trying model"?  and what type of data are you trying to protect?  (I ask
since certain data, i.e. such as credit cards, have certain standards).  For
example:


1) hacker "breaks in" and scans session data for ???
2) hacker scans network traffic from database to php-app to get ???
3) hacker hijacks session and takes over another account


etc etc...


Then there are some product questions:

1) Do you have "user database" or are these just anonymous sessions?
2) Is _all_ data in the session sensitive?   Do you want an encrypted XML
file or an XML file with encrypted data?  And why?
3) How much data per user per session is expected?
4) What is anticipated volume/growth of the website?
5) Is this data, _just_ going to live in session?  It's never going into a
database or other file?  If not how do we protect those items?
6) Do you need password recovery?  Or what if the user forgets the password
the data is gone?
7) How are you currently storing session data (are sessions sticky to a
machine? or are sessions on a separate box)


>From this a solution can be crafted.  Maybe there is an simple out of the
box solution (e.g.an  encrypted disk volume might be all you need!). If you
need more help, please contact me directly

thanks,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Reading in strings from text file
Message-ID: <475D7C2C.30205@gmx.net>

Hi!

I am about to start on a module for i18n and wonder if anyone has experience 
on how long it takes to read in let's say 1,000 strings of about 30 characters 
on average from a text file that has numeric keys, with those keys  becoming 
the key of an array that in the end is to be stored in $_SESSION. Is there a 
better place than $_SESSION to hold this? What I really want to prevent is to 
have each script that generates text output have to read in its own strings as 
this adds management needs to make sure the right strings are picked up.
Anyone knows how well this would scale with 10,000 or 100,000 strings? Sure, I 
could try it out, but asking NYPHP is way faster.

David

I highly recommend *not* doing it this way.
1) A session is the worst place to put the data because there is a
different session file for each user.  If you do want to do this, use
a singleton pattern to access the array bundle.
2) Plurals, and translation re-ordering will be nearly impossible.
3) Performance will be suboptimal.
4) You will have to build your own tools for the translators.
5) Dealing with merges is going to be a pain.
6) You need to give the translators context for the strings.
7) Your system will have to deal with non-translated strings appropriately.

The good news is that all of these problems associated with i18n, have
been solved.  Gettext is the GNU standard and you get all of the tools
for free (PoEdit for translators, msgmerge, binary encoding for
performance)  Gettext seems confusing and complicated at first, but
you will appreciate it once you have tried something else.

I know this doesn't answer your question about the performance, but it
is unlikely that you will be able to successfully internationalize an
application with 1000+ strings if your plan is to use array bundles.

Just so you understand the difficulty of i18n'ing an app, consider this string:
"Your Visa card with last four digits 1234 expires on Dec 15, 2007".

In another language, it may need to be written as:
"On 15:Drb:2007, expires, last 4 digits 1234, is your Visa"


Also, your application code will become unreadable if you use array
bundles. Consider:
echo $translation_bundle[ERR::CC_EXP];
vs the gettext way:
echo _("Your credit card has expired");

I find the latter much more readable.

Cheers,
John Campbell

Hello,

Just to clarify, when I say "session" I don't mean "session" data. Just 
a previous "session" of work
performed by the user. I want to save their settings.

This is a tool for company use only, specifically debugging/QA and is CL 
driven.

Now to answer your other questions:

Username/Logins - This would be the most valuable data in the xml file.

It doesn't provide a web interface. And the XML wouldn't be served by 
HTTP. This wouldn't be in web root.

I wouldn't think so. Unless they hijack a tty. But honestly, if they 
have root on the box we have other problems.

I have no idea what a singleton pattern is.

That is what I considered to be the case and thus the reason why I asked.

I did not mention this before, but I have collected first hand experience in 
i18n as both project manager and translator. Context for strings would have 
been the application. I expect from any translator who is halfways serious 
about a useful translation that he/she knows the app. Most of the time 
translators do not as the companies hiring them don't want to pay for their 
time spent in training. In my case, the app is gosh darn easy and there will 
be CSH available.

> 7) Your system will have to deal with non-translated strings appropriately.
That is something that I would have considered if going ahead with my now 
shattered plan.

I know about the difficulties in dealing with i18n. I never heard about 
gettext and I will take a look at it. I just hope it uses a string text file 
format that allows for using spellcheckers, but maybe that is included in PoEdit?

I'll take a look at it and then cast my verdict. I worked with too many 
developers who implemented i18n in a way that made quick and easy translations 
close to impossible, for example by insisting on using alphanumeric monikers 
as keys. That totally sucked.

Thanks for the tip and saving me from spending time on something stupid. :)

+1 for gettext. It's extremely fast, very capable, and there is the
weight of many other projects behind it.

In the simplest case, you simply wrap all of your output strings in _(
) and keep going. When you're ready to translate, the command line
scripts will scan your code for all those instances, and then generate
plain text files that you can give to translators to work on.

That said, it is not the easiest thing to learn how to make it all
work. And the downside to the lightning fast speed is that you have to
restart Apache whenever you change one of the .po files. In practice
this isn't such a big deal.

Anyway, feel free to ask specific questions here when/if you start using it.

It is worth your time to google search for "singleton pattern php" and
do some reading.  I don't mean to sound smug by sending you to google,
but others can explain it much better than I can.

> That is something that I would have considered if going ahead with my now

I am glad I have shattered you plan, because I went down the road you
were headed and hit a brick wall.  I wasted dozens of hours instead of
intelligently posting to a list.
I now know:
- i18n is a hard problem.
- it has already been solved
- gettext is the free solution
- gettext works well as an afterthought to an already existing application.

The caveat is that gettext is "As simple as possible, but not
simpler".  My advice is to spend a day reading he man pages for
"msgfmt", "msgmerge", and "msgfmt"  and reading php.net/gettext.

John Campbell

Well, this is for a picture and video viewer. There are tons out there. I am 
sure that with most of my endeavours in PHP I can find a faster, better, 
safer, more featured version in 5 seconds on the web ready for download and 
use. My goal is to learn on how to do it myself. I do want to learn and get 
experience. That said, my plan was to create string files one for each 
language with the following format
<numeric key>	<tring text in quotes>
or as an example line
12345	"This is a test!"

Plus some simple formatting codes or even a small subset of XHTML tags so that 
I can control line breaks, make text bold, and such. From all string files I 
ever worked with the ones following the <numeric key>	<tring text in quotes> 
format worked the best. As a tool one needs a plain old text editor, one can 
run a spellchecker against the flat file (and it doesn't choke on the numeric 
keys), and when selecting the keys so that they build groups for each section 
or page it is very easy to put new blocks in and take blocks out. Comparisons 
and cross-checks can be made with a spreadsheet, although I would have built a 
simple tool for doing so. And changing anything is as easy as editing the file 
in place or dropping in a new one. Sure, plurals and potential segments would 
need to be their own string, but German being the first language to translate 
to, I know that there isn't an easy algorithm to pluralize the words. It is 
not as easy as in English were slapping and "s" or "es" at the end works in 
99% of the cases. In German there are several endings, the entire word stem 
may change, or the singular word is the same as the plural word and the only 
difference is the different article in front of it. I am very sure that having 
a few strings more in the string file is more efficient than to figure out the 
inner workings of the German language.

So how would one go ahead when starting a new application? Not use gettext, 
but something else?

And simple is a very relative term. From what I have seen, gettext's .po 
format is quite different from what I was going for, but it may just be the 
better approach. I start reading and try it with a small sample script.

Thanks for all the pointers.

Gettext works well with existing and new applications.  I am not aware

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Managing form data with PHP
Message-ID: <E1J29Va-0003Qx-00@pop-altamira.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

Newbie request -

I want to handle a form by redisplaying the submitted data, along 
with error information. Eg one of the forms has two dates (a FromDate 
and a ToDate) as well as an identifier. The usual error conditions 
apply to the dates - valid form, From <= To, etc.

What I'd like to be able to do is to have a stack of error messages 
which identify a field in error, and the set of associated error 
messages. Ideally the fields in error would be shaded to indicate the 
severity of the error (no shading = fine; yellow shading=warning; red 
shading=error), and would also allow the user to see the list of 
errors for a field by hovering over the field.

The 'pretty' enhancements are relatively easy - but I'm having a 
problem trying to get the form data to redisplay.

Any pointers? ideas? suggestions?

Thanks,

Tony

Start by submitting the form to the script that renders the page:
<form action="" method="post">
Then each field should of the form:
<input type="text" name="username" value="<?php echo
htmlspecialchars($_POST['username']); ?>" />

If the post data is valid, redirect.  Otherwise, the form will
automatically redisplay with the original values intact.

I am sure there are better ways, but this is what I do:

I submit the script to itself and check with isset() which values in $_POST 
are set. With a good initialization of variables you get a very reliable means 
of checking if there was data submitted at all (after getting values from 
$_POST unsubmitted variables retain their initialization value) and when it 
was submitted (variable valuye is no longer the initialization value) one can 
check for plausibility, such as checking if a date entered really is a valid 
date (PHP has nice functions for that). Based on the outcome of all this 
checking I set the default value of the form elements to the submitted and 
accepted value or show an appropriate error message (which you say you have 
handled with the 'pretty' stuff). Upon a submit that generates no error I 
write the values to $_SESSION and redirect the browser to the next script, for 
example one that writes the values to the database. Of course, you can also 
show a message that all entries are OK and place a button on the page. Upon 
clicking that button the whole entires are submitted via hidden fields through 
$_POST to a different script.
Or you could just stuff all the code into one big script and redirect to 
itself with commands sent along through the URL parameter that can be 
harvested from $_GET. You ideally create a huge switch statement that acts 
upon that activity tag. I like many script better than one big one, but I can 
see advantages for both approaches. There are some HTML form fields where you 
do not want to (or even cannot) set default values from previous submissions, 
such as password fields. It is common practice that those entries are not 
preserved. There are two ways to get the previously submitted value to show in 
drop-down lists as current selection. The easy, cheesy method is to make sure 
that it is the first entry in the list, which is the default selection if not 
specified otherwise. You will have that option then in the list twice. The 
nicer approach is to set the selected flag appropriately. Likewise for radio 
button groups and check boxes.

I use this in some cases, but do so sparingly. If the form contains three 
fields I don't bother. It is nice to do this for large forms. It can get 
confusing at times and there is a lot of checking needed so that you don't get 
screwy results for the various states of the page/form. But, I found it to 
work well and in a way that I can comprehend and troubleshoot. Add a lot of 
comments so that in a week from now you still have a clue as to why there are 
all these checks in there. The script will get quite complex compared to one 
that 'only' shows a static form.

Hope that helps,

		David

Smarty, Smarty, Smarty. smarty.php.net.

Smarty Template File:

Error "log" at the top of the page could look like this:
<ul class="errors">
{foreach from=$errors key=field item=message}
  <li class="{$message.severity|default:low}">{$field} :
{$message.text}</li>
{/foreach}
</ul>

Each field label could be marked up to include the above error:
<label for="fullname"{if $error.fullname} class="error"{/if}>Full
Name:</label>
<input type="text" name="fullname" id="fullname"
value="{$smarty.post.fullname|filter_var:$smarty.const.FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING}"/>

Note that the whole filter_var thing could be looped inside of your PHP
script, I just included it because you should always cleanout POST and GET
and REQUEST.

Message-ID: <475F0074.6080403@projectskyline.com>

Hello,

A while back I asked an OOP related question. Brian D suggested:

If you're just starting out in the PHP5 OOP world, I highly recommend 
Zandstra's "PHP 5 Objects, Patterns, and Practice." I promise you it's 
worth the $20.

Which I did and started reading it (twice) and it just assumes too much. 
I have zero OOP experience (well that's not really true) and need more 
explanation than that book provides.

Here's a list of OOP books I've collected from Bookpool. Can anyone 
provide insight as to which are good.
I've been coding for a few years now professionally, but dont have any 
real schooling in it.

So, I'm kinda looking to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. So other 
books of interest I'm welcome to hear too.

The list:
http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0321247140
http://www.bookpool.com/sm/020163385X
http://www.bookpool.com/sm/020189551X
http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0672326116 - Which I just borrowed from work

I'm also interested in learning UML.

Thanks!

I posted this to the Boston list and received two replies:
1. Using pretty URLs via Joomla.
2. Try Horde Route: http://dev.horde.org/routes/integrate.html (btw, this
looks like a good solution)

Let?s see what NY has to say. Here?s what I posted.

So...how many of you use ?pretty urls?? If you do, how do you do it? With a
Framework (Cake, Symphony, Zend, etc.) that you are using? Rolled your own?
Via php or mod_rewrite? Thoughts and ideas for introducing pretty urls into
an existing application (i.e. can?t jump into a new Framework for a legacy
app)?

Happy holidays,
Cliff

Hello,
First thanks everyone for coming out the NYPHP on 27-nov-2007 for my talk on
"Tamperproof URLs and PHP"

Based on your feedback, comments, and uhhh, a few blank stares, I completely
revamped the slides.

Right now, I've dumped the slides, the source code and the unit test here:

      http://modp.com/slides/securestring/

However I hope to move all of it to svn at code.google.com once they let me
use more resources.  If you have any comments, questions on the slides, or
corrections what not, please post a comment on my blog:

     http://blog.modp.com/2007/12/tamperproof-urls-and-php.html

thanks again,

Perhaps it would be better to say its a legacy app up front so people 
don't waste time posting about routing in frameworks like symfony...?

I would imagine mod_rewrite rules are probably your best bet.

Good point. LEGACY APPLICATION. Many of us don't have the luxury of
completely porting an existing application to a modern framework, but do

a front-end controller.

I used Peter Lavin's book to learn PHP5 OOP:

Most of these are too dry and academic for me.

I also looked into using UML and found it to be not of much value for what 
Im doing.

Hello Ajai,

I'll take a look at that. Thing is, it doesn't have to be a php oop 
book. I just want
it to really flesh out all the OOP Design details.

Strange as it may sound, I like the dry academic books. heh.

UML would be great for what I'm doing. I find I'm lacking a
way to describe a program, both verbally and visually. I think
that's where UML will come in handy.

Thanks Ajai,

- Ben

Hello:
I am trying to understand what your are trying to accomplish.
this is just a suggestion.
if  you are using a form to submit the data, then I would change the isset($_GET'aid'] to isset($_GET['submitted'])) to test if a form was submitted.  The your could use $query="SELECT....VALUE.....    items to be place into the database.
if the result is ok then $result=mysql_query($query); the if($result) {
print the results.
That way all of the artist is into one database and you only use one statement to display the info from the data base using the aid.
Good luck
see a sample below:
/////////////////////////////////////////////
if(isset($_POST['submitted'])) {//if the form was submitted
    
if(!empty($_POST['artistfname'])) {
    $afn=$_POST['artistfname'];
    } else {
        $_POST['artistfname']=NULL;
        }
        
if(!empty($_POST['artistlname'])) {
    $aln=$_POST['artistlname'];
    } else {
        $_POST['artistlname']=NULL;
        }


if(!empty($_POST['description'])) {
    $desc=$_POST['description'];
    } else {
        $_POST['description']=NULL;
        
        }
        }


 

require_once ('../mysql_connect.php'); // Connect to the database.

 

// Are we looking at a particular artist?

if(empty($errors)) {
    require_once('./connect/mysql_connect.php');
    $query="INSERT INTO artisttable concat(artist_fname, artist_lname) as name,price, description) VALUES ('$afn','aln','$price', '$description');
                                        
    $result=@mysql_query($query);
    if($result) {
    
echo '<table border="0" width="90%" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" align="center">

<td align="right" width="20%"><b>Price</b></td>

</tr>';

 

// Display all the prints, linked to URLs.

$result = mysqli_query ($dbc, $query);

while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array ($result, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {

 

            // Display each record.

            echo "   <tr>

                        <td align=\"left\"><a href=\"browse_prints.php?aid={$row['artist_id']}\">{$row['name']}</a></td>

I am a relative php amateur who is trying to kind of master

the authors example he lists all the results.


  
 

What I want to do for this project is to display the
following product information in rows and columns whereby; 


  
 

i
     could  specify the number of columns
     and rows per page (using php 5 syntax)And finally
     I also want to paginate the result set (using php 5 syntax)

  
 

I know this might sound trivial to most of you ?Gurus? on
this list (which is why I finally decided to stop trying to figure it out
myself and ask for help) and I appreciate your help in advance.

Of course I may be surprised by how advanced some of you are, but from 
where I sit, even the new apps on the new frameworks suffer from the 
same routing issues.

If anyone is enjoying reliable, manageable, strict and pretty URLs on 
one of the "modern frameworks" I'd like to hear about it. That means 
content level control of "pretty" URLs, ability to manage redirection 
(at the content level), and enforced one-URL-per-document.

At this point I'm all in favor of a neutral bolt-on rewrite router.

I find Joomla + a SEF component comes pretty dang close, and if you 
remove the "breadcrumbs" feature support it can be almost 100%.

The problem isn't so much the framework, as that the individual 
components also have to support the framework.

Basically, you have a function Joomla will call to convert to/from SEF 
urls.  It's built in SEF is ugly though.  Than you have the SEF 
component that gives a better ruleset for SEF.  Finally, all those 
components have a simple mechanism to customize them component per 
component.

Now, control at the "content" level in what manner?  For example, I used 
an ad component for user profiles, and I wanted to remap it to use the 
person's name as the end of the url, and special beginnings for 
different categories.  About 20 lines of code and it was done, and this 
only because I was in a hurry and hardcoded a lot of rules that should 
be configurable.

What do you mean by redirection?

In any case, I don't think Joomla is unique in this manner, all the 
various routers provide the same goals and functions.

As for how to use Pretty URL's, it really depends on the need. 
If you have a disciplined structure legacy app, you can use mod_rewrite 
and not much else.  Maybe use obstart so you can postprocess the page 
generated and convert the ugly urls to their mod_rewrite formats.

Using routers is nice, but main issue I see is that most everything is 
built to be generic.

IE a router will maintain a list of pretty URL to internal URL entries 
in a table or the file system(or memcache) and so when a request comes 
into the system, the router has to remap it on the fly everytime.

This allows the router to work with Apache, lighty, IIS, etc.

But if you know you are using Apache, it seems a far better solution 
would be to have your router save the url to a mysql table in a format 
that Apache's mod_rewrite with mysql support can use(and then to work it 
out in such a manner as to consolidate rewrites as much as possible 
using regular expressions).  And if your using Lighty, do it in a manner 
Lighty can use.  Etc etc and so forth.

I think in the end, "pretty urls" in a corporate/business setting are 
going to be 60-80% generic, and than a small bit of customization for 
just their specific needs.  Thus leading to most people starting with 
generic and then upgrading later(which has it's own penalty, as if the 
business grew and is popular, you then need to maintain /both/ systems 
for legacy purposes)

John, I can't believe you don't have something like this. You've been
asking for it for a few years, so the requirements must not be as
simple as they sound.

Maybe it's a wiki-like version of a reverse proxy. This app would act
as a reverse proxy for your site, so whenever someone requests a url,
the app rewrites it, fetches and lightly caches the content, and
returns it as a response.

Whenever you (as editor) visit a url that doesn't exist, an interface
kicks in that helps you map it to a resource in your site (or create a
redirect to a different url). Since you require one-url-per-resource,
the app would also add a redirect that sends a direct request for the
mapped resource to the pretty url.

Upside is that it would act as a caching/mirroring layer and improve
scalability. Downside is that for some legacy apps, using a reverse
proxy can involve non-trivial amounts of content rewriting and reverse
engineering.

Yes, use javascript and inform the user in real-time and before they 
send the junk to the server. Of course, you then have to scrub and 
clean everything, but you would have to anyway.

That works OK for something like a date or making sure that a mandatory entry 
exists, but for example for a user name that has to be unique you need to 
check it against your tables. Can't do that with ECMAScript.

It helps to picture it this way:

1. Javascript is for user convenience, avoid submitting mismatched 
passwords, malformed dates and so forth.
2. Server checks are about integrity, unique, referential and other 
constraints

Ok, but wasn't the OP asking for a date thing? I must of missed the 
"user name" part.

Thanks for the presentation.

I have a question that is related, but along different lines.  I have
a flash game that saves high scores to the server and I want to
prevent high scores from being forged.

Initially the scores were send as a simple post request, e.g.
name=john&score=1000.  This is a problem because it is trivial to
forge the request.  So my solution was to create the post request as
follows:

name=john&score=1000&checksum= . md5(md5("My secret") . name . score)

on the server side, I can verify the checksum.

This works well enough, but an enterprising hacker can download my swf
file and run `strings game.swf` to extract "My secret", and then they
can forge the request. Is there any cryptography method that
guarantees the request is coming from my code?


Thanks,
John Campbell

I dont know if we satisfy all of the above but one of our new sites, 
built using symfony, has a lot of routing and pretty URLs.

http://www.quamut.com

(Yeah I know, some of the URLs look like static pages, that's deliberate :-)

Sure, I understand. I just don't get much more than theory out of 
"generic" books (which is fine if you dont know the theory but if you've 
coded in several languages like me, its not so useful). The books that 
*do* include code talk about Java or C++. But not all the features of say, 
C++, are present in PHP5. So while its good to know about multiple 
inheritance, at some point you have to get more language-specific and 
realize that PHP5 doesn't have that.

Hi John,
Great question.


Your general idea is sound, but sadly there is no such thing as a "secure
client".  If there were, every game client (unreal, wow, etc), IM client,
dvd player, cable tv box, xbox, iphone, etc would use it.  But these are
routinely cracked.

The only thing they do differently is to make is it 'real hard' to find the
secret key (and other "tricks" but by careful reverse engineering these can
all be broken)


So for your application, you can a do a few things.

1) The dumbest is to make a string like 't' + 'h' + 'i' + 's' ...
2) or even better use ascii numeric values... chr(34) + chr(75) to build a
string
3) and use indirection... make an array of values of numbers , and use these
to build the string
   chr(myarray[i])  (or make myarray be a function).
4) or consider making your secret key be an integer that it is the result of
a computation or iteration
secret = highscore;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)  secret *=  2 + Math.cos(5 + math.sin(secret))

This way the secret depends on the score it self.  The "secret" is the
function that both the client and server must implement identically. I just
made that up to give you an idea.

This will prevent the "strings" attacks.

  more advanced stuff for flash is

1) use byte code obfuscators.
2) I know a lot of spy ware has a small shell that loads another file that
is encrypted flash, then decrypts it then runs it.  Or something like that.

I'm not an expert on flash, but I'm sure if you look around on google you
can find off-the-shelf solutions for this.

But remember these are all hacks and a very determined person _could_ fake a
high score.  Hopefully it will be such a pain in the arse, no-one will
bother.


enjoy!

Hello Ajai,

I'm about two chapters deep in http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0672326116 and 
I'm pretty happy w/it so far.
Great background into OOP and a gentle introduction into UML.

Enjoying it so far, looking forward to getting more time into it.

- Ben

PS: BTW, just finished Hawkings, "the universe in a nutshell", great 
book, leaves you wanting more!
http://www.amazon.com/Universe-Nutshell-Stephen-William-Hawking/dp/055380202X

I need to dig up more books like that. Please email me off list if you 
have recommendations.

If language isn't an issue, I'd recommend Bruce Eckel's "Thinking In  
Java". It starts by covering OOP from the ground up, in a somewhat  
language-non-specific way.

http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/

I believe you can download electronic versions for free.

Once you get the basics down, I'd recommend looking at design  
patterns. I happen to like "Head First Design Patterns". You either  
love this series or hate it. This also includes examples in Java.

http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfdesignpat/

Another interesting read, from a somewhat philosophical perspective,  
is "Object Thinking", by David West. He is an XP and OOP evangelist.  
He proposes a way of thinking about objects and programming in  
general, as a simulation of real-world things. Really drives home  
great design principals.

http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/6820.aspx

There's a podcast interview with him gives you a sense of what he's  
all about.

I'm using an agnostic router class:

I tried to stick to the basics.  Let me know if this is useful.  Also

Thanks Nick,

I'll take some measures to obfuscate the "secret", but I just realized
I have another potential hole.  There is nothing to prevent someone
from actually getting a high score, then replaying the request to get
all of the top positions.  I suppose the solution is to have the
server create a random string, save it on the server, send it to the
client, and use the token as anonther element of the checksum.  Then
once the score is saved, the token is deleted from the server.  I
think that will work, but now I am starting to feel sorry for the next
guy that has to figure out what the hell the my code is doing. :)

Cheers,
John Campbell

Message-ID: <bcb7aa500712120929s6b3a16a9r42759e0eb990bb9f@mail.gmail.com>

The simples way to achieve nifty URLs is using a ForceType directive.

For example... you create a file named 'app' and fill this file with
php code. It'll not be executed.
Then you do the trick and ForceType this file to be interpreted by PHP:

<Files app>
        ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Files>


Now it'll execute the source you defined there.

To handle URLs like: http://www.domain.com/app/controller/action/arg1/arg2

You need to explode the URL you have:

// URL Exploding
$address = explode( $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'], $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] );
$address_exp = array();

// Parsing URL pieces
if ( isset( $address[1] ) ) {
	$address_exp = explode( '/', $address[1] );

	// Removing blank index
	array_shift( $address_exp );
}

Now you have $address_exp with the pieces you want.
In my framework, I used this way:

Controller1/SubController1_1/.../Action/arg_name,arg_value/arg_array,arg_value1,arg_value2,...

This can be easily achieved using some PHP.

Now just open your imagination and you can create Search Engine
Friendly URLs. Just remember that SE Spiders does not like ?, & and
other weird characters on URL.


If you have any other question, do not hesitate to send messages in this thread.

Regards,

Yes there is, John, but you may need to seriously consider whether
implementation is worth it.

You can use a public/private key pair to perform asymmetric
encryption. That means that a value encrypted using one key can only
be decrypted using the other. This is the encryption scheme used for
SSL, where your browser uses the server's public key (aka Certificate)
to encrypt the request.

So you would use the game's public key to encrypt hash-of-score:random
on the client side. And then on the server, you would use the game's
private key to decrypt the value and check the hash.

Your tasks, should you choose to go this route, are to find an RSA
implementation in ActionScript to perform the encryption, and to use
PHP's OpenSSL support to perform the decryption. I'm pretty sure the
first task is going to be tougher than the second unless Adobe
provides an api in the Flash player.

Aha!  Good point.
So there are a few ways you can do this.   But i think the simplest is just
to record the username (perhaps the ip), and highscore and time stamp.  Then
when a new message comes in check the db to see if this user's timestamp is
close to now.  If so, reject.

More complicated ways are having the client send the timestamp and use it in
your hmac/hash thing.  If their timestamp is old then they are replaying and
you can just reject it.

Or some combination of the both.  Without know your product & operations
better it's hard to say, but something like this should get your started.

have fun!

I don't follow how this is any better than what I have now?  The
public key is still stored in the swf, and there is nothing that
prevents the key from being extracted from the swf and the request can
still be forged.  This seems to just be better obfuscation.

I recently was able to implement a front controller (http://www.phppatterns.com/docs/design/the_front_controller_and_php 
) that used include() to call old html/php files from a legacy  
application.  There are numerous ways to get all your requests (other  
than those for images, css, js files, and other static resources)  
through my front controller.  Hans Zaunere recommends using AliasMatch  
apache directive if you have access to httpd.conf because it's faster  
than mod_rewrite:

Anyway... once the urls are going to the front controller, it then  
parsed the query string to figure out the mapping between the current  
url and the legacy version.  The request vars were extracted and  
populated $_REQUEST, $_GET, etc accordingly.  Then I just included the  
file that the url would have gone to and called "exit;" afterwards  
(just in case).  In writing it seems like that would obviously work...  
but I was still surprised that it actually did work.  I found using a  
big switch statement in my front controller and working in php rather  
than a lot of mod_rewrite rules was a bit easier and kept more code in  
the php app rather than spread out between php and apache config  
files.  You should also put 301 header redirects for all of the old  
urls.

The next big task is making sure that all of the url links are  
rewritten properly and that.  That can be fairly difficult if your  
links aren't very centralized.

Hi yah,

re: Chris  and public/private key pairs.




In your solution/example, anyone with the public key can talk to the server.
 Since anyone with the public key can then forge messages somehow you have
to "hide" the public key.  This isn't any different from use plain old
secret keys as he did originally.  Even if you flipped it around somehow and
that the server minted key-pairs for each client downloaded (good luck),
there it's the same problem of hiding the private key on client.  This does
make communicating back to the server 'secure' in that people can't see what
is being transmitted but it doesn't prevent forgeries which what I think the
original issue was about.

The SSL example is solving a different problem of how two parties with out a
shared secret can  communicate security without snoopers.


cheers,

-nickg

Unfortunately this won't help.  If a malicious user wished to fake a
high score it would simply be a matter of extracting the public key from
the game and using it to create a bogus hash.

I do not know of any way to secure against a user with the capability to
disassemble the .swf.  Regardless of the mechanism used to create the
'secure' string for submission, the code to create that string must be
present in the .swf, and therefore vulnerable.

The degree of protection offered is really not dependent on the
encryption/hash method you use, but rather on how difficult it is for a
would-be cheater to figure out how to create the appropriate POST.

Without knowing the impact of a forged high score (eg can a user win
money by faking a high score?) it is difficult to make any
recommendation, but combining a simple checksum (using one of the
suggested methods to obfuscate the source of the secret portion) with
obfuscation of the .swf itself should give enough protection to thwart
casual attacks.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Callback syntax
Message-ID: <4760293E.90908@projectskyline.com>

Hello ,

I'm trying to do the following:


object calling code:

$callbackSet = array( " " => "return",
                               "w" => "moveUp");

$key = $object->nonBlockOnInput( );

$object->process($key, $callbackSet);


.... inside the class....

public function process($callbackSet)
{
            reset($optionSet);
        while(list($index, $callbackFunction) = each($optionSet))
        {
            switch ($key)
            {
                case $index:
                    call_user_func($this->$callbackFunction);
                break;
            }
        }
}


It doesn't seem to work.  I'm not sure of the syntax to do this. moveUp( 
) is a method of the class,
but I'm not sure how to tell it, call_user_func( ), since I need the 
syntax to be $this->functionName( ).

Also, I need to be able to call return as well.

Any ideas?

I see this as a big assumption on the part of many router/controllers. If
you are working in a framework, things will probably work. But all it takes
is one handwritten uri to muck things up. Most of the routers/controllers
I?ve seen expect or write something like /param1/param2/param3, which
assumes a certain order...and level of knowledge.

It seems to me that a more robust method would be to have something like
/param1/value1/param2/value2/.../paramn/valuen

Wordier and exposes more about the application. But security by obscurity
doesn?t get you very far anyway.

Message-ID: <47602AAD.40702@beezifies.com>

Due to the nature of Flashs, someone will always be able to revere 
engineer the code.

So how about this(if it doesn't slow things down too much):
When the game loads up, have the Flash program connect to the server and 
provide it with some information(how about hashing the ipaddress, 
username, and current score in some manner with a secret key)

So now you have some session information on the user.  Their username, 
their ipaddress, and a score.  In return, the server provides the client 
with a new secret key.

Every 2 minutes, connect to the server again and provide the ipaddress, 
username, and current score and a hash with the new key.

When the game is over, connect to the server and post the information a 
final time, ipaddress, username, and current score, the hash, and the 
status code(completed).

So now you have a sequence of records:
1.1.1.1 Gary 0 Hash: xxx newkey: abc
1.1.1.1 Gary 1000 Hash: xxx newkey: bcd
1.1.1.1 Gary 50000 Hash: xxx newkey: bcd
1.1.1.1 Gary 500000 Hash: xxx - final score

So you only accept a final score that has a history behind it.  To 
"repeat" the attack the hacker needs to run a new sequence of inputs.  
So at best, for a game you know takes at least 10 minutes, he can only 
submit 1 high score every 10 minutes.

Then if someone complains of cheating, you have logs to go through and 
see if something jumps out, and how to change your final score 
acceptance algorythm to accomodate.

Actually worse obfuscation because more trouble. I saw the last
question and ran with it. I'll just go back to coding now.

If you are trying to call a method of an object or class you need to 
tell PHP which object or class to call. You do this by passing the 
object or class as the first element of the callback array.

call_user_func(array($this, $callbackFunction));

or for static methods:

call_user_func(array(__CLASS__, $callbackFunction));

>

Huh? You want to return the value of the callback? Just return the value 
of call_user_func().

Replace:
call_user_func($this->$callbackFunction);
with:
$this->$callbackFunction();

see http://us.php.net/manual/en/functions.variable-functions.php for
an explanation.

call_user_func() treats everything as a static method and will not work.

Thanks to all for the help.  Since there are no cash prizes and this
is part of online educational software that requires a subscription, I
doubt anyone will care enough to decompile the swf.  I did check the
database however, and it appears there are 2 university students that
are resending the requests (same score submitted multiple times in a
too short of a time period).  I need to protect against that.

If I remember correctly, this is the default url structure for the

I prefer following pattern of URL.

protocol://domain (application)/module/action?param1=value1&param2=value2

or 

protocol://domain (application)/module/action/param1/value1/param2/value2

e.g.

http://www.myapp.com/user/view?id=1&type=2

or

http://www.myapp.com/user/view/id/1/type/2

1st one is more clear as it clearly separates "query string" portion from rest 
of URL scheme.

Thanks

Doesn't that defeat the purpose of pretty urls?  I though the whole
point was so the url looks like:

/blog/MostRecent/Page1/ and /blog/john_caught_picking_his_nose/

instead of:
/blog/orderby/recent/page/1/ and /blog/post_id/37/ or

If you are going to do it the latter way, I don't understand the
benefit vs a query string.  Maybe I am missing something.

You bring up a good point. Perhaps the place to begin is the beginning,
which is, "what is the point and benefit." Things I have heard:

1. SEO friendly because search engines do not process the query string
    Ok, but say you need to be logged in. What's the point?

2. Easier for humans to understand
   Perhaps for content/blog/news site; maybe for recognizing what a bookmark
is. But how many of us do that? Depends on the application....

3. Security. Hides the file.php and param names.
   Yeah, but I hope you are not solely relying on security by obscurity

4. Looks cool and Rails does it
   Do we have to mimic everything Rails does?!

5. Other?

It's also not pretty urls.

Here is an example:
http://test.com/index.php?option=com_adsmanager&page=show_category&catid=34&brandid=48

Now convert that in std format to:
http://nowhere.com/com_adsmanager/show_category/34/48
Or your proposal
http://nowhere.com/option/com_adsmanager/page/show_category/catid/34/brandid/48


Neither of these are "pretty" and their only real benefit is hiding 
things form search engines to make the urls look unqiue.


http://nowhere.com/find/widgets/acme.html

That is what I feel is a pretty url.

Where find summaries the whole component & action
widgets is the category
acme is the brand

Now someone searching on google looking for "acme widgets" will see the 
url http://nowhere.com/find/widgets.acme.html

Oh look, that is precisely what I'm looking for. I'll go there.

The thing is though, stuff like this can't be automated by some fire and 
forget generic routing app, it requires some intelligence.

The parm./value or /value/value format is great to get you from nothing 
to something, and as long as you have a way to customize the function 
for your needs, that seems great to me.

Once upon a time someone said it was a security risk to echo back $_POST
data unconditionally, even if you escape it, and even though you are only
showing them the very thing they just submitted to you. But I forget what
that risk was. Maybe I misremember.

I suppose if someone were to submit a string the length of War and Peace, it
would squander bandwidth if you sent it back without truncating, but is that
a true security risk?

Sin't changing the server's directive for passing on php files better? Name 
your file .whoknowswhat and have that get sent to the PHP interpreter...or 
pull everything through the interpreter and use no file extensions at all. And 
for the parameters, don't use GET.
I agree, there are better means to achieve security and even my proposals are 
lame.

I second the recommendation for "Head First Design Patterns." I might
be a little biased, though, since my background lies in Java

While the variable function might work, could you clarify what you
mean by 'treats everything as a static method'?

I just ran this:<?php
        class Foobar {
                private $schmoo = 9;

                function setSchmoo( $var ) {
                        $this->schmoo = $var;
                }

                function getSchmoo(  ) {
                        return $this->schmoo;
                }

                function setCallbackSchmoo( $var ) {
                        call_user_func( array( $this, 'setSchmoo' ), $var );
                }
        }

        $foo= new Foobar;
        var_dump( $foo->getSchmoo(  ) );
        $foo->setCallbackSchmoo( 20 );
        var_dump( $foo->getSchmoo(  ) );
?>

And got this:
int(9)
int(20)


Which is precisely what I'd expect.

Message-ID: <E1J2ukV-0005eQ-00@pop-scotia.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

Thanks to those who replied earlier. I've moved on a little, and now 
am wondering how to make an object 'persist' between activations of 
an action script, associated with a button on the form.

The model I have (the common thread of most replies) is something 
like this (not in php, but in reasonably self-evident pseudo code):

(firsttime) is determined by a test of the $_POST variables, or in 
some similar way

if (firsttime) then
     showform and wait for action script {this script} to re-activate
else
     edit form data and build error stack
     showform along with error stack and wait for next action
end

I can get this to work fine if I'm not using an object, but if I 
create an object on the (firsttime) path, it disappears between then 
and the next activation.

The object includes not only the functions to build the form display, 
but also the editing and error-stack management functions (no 
multiple inheritance :-().

Is it as simple as stashing away the object in a hidden field? or 
maybe in some $_SESSION variable?

Thanks for any help!

Tony

Hello,

Can you serialize the object and stick it in the $_SESSION?

Yes, just remember to unserialize it when you want to use it.

Don't use sessions.   You need to embrace the atomic nature of a web
request, and just reconstruct the object on each request.  Each
request should have all of the information required to reconstruct the
object.  I am not sure what you are trying to do, but maybe you need
hidden form fields to retain state across requests.

In my opinion, sessions should be used very sparingly.

John Campbell

Hi Ben,

If you just want the basics of how to write programs using OOP
constructs, you might look at something like the Deitel & Deitel Java
How to Program book. PHP's OOP is very close to Java's.

However, more generally, I would de-emphasize the importance of
"Design Patterns". The whole DP thing is overrated. Unfortunately it's
pretty common to see people using various patterns without really
knowing why. Most of the patterns you'll find described in those books
are only useful in a few advanced high-level scenarios like UI widget
libraries (e.g. Composite). Or they're so simple you really didn't
need a book to explain it to you (e.g. Flyweight). It is much more
common to find that you simply want to use an abstract base class so
that other parts of your code can overload some methods. That sort of
basic stuff is covered in an intro book like the Deitel & Deitel one.

I have recently been modelling my code after Zend Framework. Some of
the ZF components are a little over-designed but I think the coding
standards and organization is excellent. Just looking at some good
examples might be all that you need to get on the right track.

John,

That's easy to say, but unless your building the app as RESTful or 
something, then the easiest
way to accomplish it IS to store it in a session.

I am not sure what you are trying to do, but maybe you need
hidden form fields to retain state across requests.

Sessions sound easier.

Hey Michael,

Good points.

As I said before, I like that book I got from work, "The object oriented 
thought process".

I will take a look at the Java book your recommending.

I do like UML though, er, well I at least like the concept of it. I'd 
like to have
the ability to map classes out (but I have to understand them well 
enough) before
I start coding them.

Thanks.

Can you elaborate on this? I use sessions very often and find them to be very 
useful. After all, they are there to be used, so why not use them when applicable?

They do have applications, but most people find way too many applications.

1) Sessions often break a lot of things, typically bookmarks, the back
button, using mutiple windows, and they expire.  These are especially
problems for beginners.
2) Sessions are not a good substitute for a performance cache, and
people tend to use them that way.
3) Sessions make for very hard to find bugs.

Think about how ridiculous it is to save an object to a session.
Let's assume the object has 20 methods and 4 data points.  Serializing
an object and saving one copy for each user is a terrible programming
habit to get into.  What does it even mean to serialize an object?  I
find the concept nonsensical.  Structs (arrays) can be serialized,
objects should not be.  What happens when you unserialize a database
resource? or a Singleton?  or anthing that references something else?

The right solution is to boil down the required information to as
little as possible, and then include it with the request.  And then
you can just do something like $myobj->restore($v1,$v2,$v3,$v4)
If you want a short cut, then save the 4 data points in a session, but
know your form won't work in mutiple windows at the same time.

John Campbell

Hi,

The easiest way I can think of is to upload a PHP document with the
following line:

<?php  echo $_SERVER["SCRIPT_FILENAME"]; ?>

Then access that file from a browser. It will tell you the actual path top
the file on the server. something like "/home/user/public_html/file.php"

You can work out path to your photo directory from there.

I wrote a couple flash client / php server casino games.  I didn't  
actually do the flash client part (takes me forever to produce nice  
looking stuff with that app) but I did come up with the api.  It used  
a token and timestamps that were hashed with a secret key - pretty  
similar to the way that Amazon's api works.  The only way I came up  
with to really prevent cheating was to keep all of the game logic on  
the server and use the client to send user actions and display the  
response.  So for a blackjack game, for example, the client would say  
start a new game - which would give it a new token - then the server  
would deal the cards and tell the client which cards it was dealt, the  
client would tell the server if it was hitting, staying, splitting,  
doubling, etc. and then the server would tell the client if it won or  
not.

Sort of a side note here... but I also had a client once ask if we  
could serve a video in a flash player and make it not possible for  
anyone to download it.  I told them we would have to embed the video  
in the flash player timeline (which makes it not look as good), we  
would have to encrypt the whole thing somehow and obfuscate the key to  
unencrypt it (perhaps it could be timestamp based and requested from  
the server which would send back a current key to use and verify the  
client was authorized to have it).  After going through all that  
trouble and spending a ton of money, a really good hacker could still  
crack it and even worse... any screen capture program could easily  
save the video as another file.  That was my long way of saying... it  
can't be done.

I'm going to agree with John on this, with a caveat. $_SESSION in and
of itself is fine, I think the objection boils down to using it for
"application instruction" that should normally be handled by
parameters. Using $_SESSION to pass params from one page to the next
*will* cause problems with users who are browsing your site with more
than one tab. Serializing also is a performance hit, so it should be
used, in my opinion, rather sparingly. It has issues with private &
protected variables, and other oddities.

I could be wrong on this one, but it seems like a mistake to be
throwing objects into a $_SESSION array for the sake of convenience.
Passing $_SESSION user information in the form of an array, or user
preferences, or other structs, would be fine. From that information
and your url params, you'll know what needs to be done.

Install Menalto Gallery and upload through one of their many methods.  
When your ready to do your own coding, you have a source on the server, 
working, where you can see how they do uploads.

Not that I experienced it, not that I'm correct, but the idea *I* 
remember was that if you exceeded the length of a POST you could 
crash the system and have your way with it. BUT, that was a long time 
ago and things have changed.

The really important thing about a lot of this stuff you hear is that it 
is repeated over and over by people who do not necessarily understand 
*why* it is a problem.  Blindly following rules of thumb is always bad, 
but in security it can be really bad.

The principle behind not returning $_POST (or $_GET) is /never trust 
anything from the browser/.  Assume that anything that came from the 
browser may have nasty stuff in it.  So, when sending back to the 
browser escape out the HTML entities.   When sending to a database 
escape out quotes to prevent SQL injection.  And of course *never* 
execute it as code on the server because it could delete files, reveal 
passwords, or anything else your process is privileged to do.

Message-ID: <EECDF5E03326984FB1DB40FA25957B24351BC5@gt1u-w3kfs1.pdfkqs.local>

Hi All;

 

I've just started using Zend Framework and having a hard time getting
used to this new way of doing things.

 

I'm a bit confused about how to register databases with the registry and
putting things all together.

 

I can query tables fine and put the results into my view if I use the
table model, that is make the table a class and refer to it as a object
through Zend_Table_class.  This is fine for querys with one table but I
think for joins its better to use their SQL builder interface.  So if I
put in my bootstrap file:

// load configuration

$config = new Zend_Config_Ini('./application/config.ini', 'general');

$registry = Zend_Registry::getInstance();

$registry->set('config', $config);

 

// setup database

$db = Zend_Db::factory($config->db->adapter,
$config->db->config->toArray());

Zend_Db_Table::setDefaultAdapter($db);

Zend_Registry::set('db', $db);

/////

Can I just use in my controller :

$db = Zend_Registry::get('db');

           $select = $db->select();

                        $select->distinct()

                        ->from( 'course')

                        ->join(array( 'user'), 'course.teacherID =
user.id') ;

            $data = $db->fetchAll($select);

            $this->view->data = $data;//

This doesn't work and I'm not sure why.

 

This works with the model:

$dbuser = new User();

$this->view->dbuser = $dbuser->fetchAll();

Thank you for those pointers. I use $_SESSION in my current project to store 
such things as the language of the currently logged in user, the user's access 
level, and the base portion of the URL to redirect the browser to pages on my 
server. The first two could be obtained from a table in the database, but I 
figured retrieving this information once and carrying it along with the 
$_SESSION saves hitting the database several time to retrieve the exat same 
piece of information. The last piece saves running the same code over and over 
again to get the same result. So far I haven't found any problems with doing this.
In one section of my application I do store more in $_SESSION, an array and a 
pointer. The array includes unique IDs of records in the database and the 
pointer contains the current array key of the element I  want to look at. That 
way I was able to build a simple navigation tool that allows for calling up 
records in the sequence specified by a search. Yes, I could do that by 
crafting the navigation as forms and pass along the info via $_POST, but for 
that I'd need to handle both the array (and serialize that) and the pointer, 
whereas using the session I only need to write the new pointer to the session, 
which is way less code and way less stuff that shows up in the XHTML. I admit 
I haven't tested it with multiple windows and the browser controls, but even 
if there are problems the worst that may happen is that the individual windows 
rewrite the pointer in the session and then the navigation would show on a 
Next click really something that is 3 Previous clicks before. In my case I 
deal with pictures and video files, so that there is no horrible damage, 
althought I admit that the app then no longer works as designed. And thinking 
about, sending everything via $_POST will for sure prevent that. I do have 
code in place that makes sure that the next or previous item indeed exists and 
that the pointer does not get set to keys that do not exist in the array.
I found it not to be difficult to find bugs that were related to $_SESSION. In 
my IDE it gets displayed the same way as the $_POST variable. I also do not 
use objects that I'd need to pass along. My app uses an object in one place to 
deal with ZIP files, but that's about it. I see the benefit of objects, but so 
far found easy enough ways to do without them. That may change when I get the 
crazy idea to work on more complex stuff.
I will go back and look at my code and see where I stuff more into $_SESSION 
and if I could do without it. In case of bookmarking, that is a side effect 
that can be to one's advantage. I know for sure that if someone bookmarks the 
pages in my app the bookmark will not work, but code is in place that captures 
especially the missing user level and gracefully redirects one to the login 
page. That is a behavior that I want.


Is there anything drastically flawed with my approach?

Since you understand the pitfalls of your approach and choose to do it
that way it is not a problem.  You are also using sessions to prevent
repeated hits to the database for "performance reasons".  Don't do
that. It typically makes performance worse because session data must
be serialized and written to disk on every request even if the data
doesn't change.

Try printing that Zend_Db_Select object -- it has a nice __toString(). Then
copy and paste that query into your mysql command line client and see what
happens. It may be that your SQL isn't what you want it to be.

Check this out.  PHP 5 now includes the filter extension by default.   
Saves you from having to keep your regular expression up to date --  
just keep your php install up to date instead:

if (filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL) !== false) {
	// email passed validation
} else {
	// email is not valid
}

So you are saying that a database access is faster than a file access? I find 
that hard to believe, but do not have any evidence of the contrary.

I have actually seen it in several cases, and it took me by surprise.  I

Hello,

Reading a java book on OOP, I wanted to do this in php:

class foo
{
    public function bar($string){...}
    public function bar($string, $int, $array) {...}
}


It should provide different "signatures" and allow method overloading...
Why not in php?

I can't answer the "why", but you can get to the same place by providing 
default values:

class foo {
    public function bar ($string,$int=0,$array=array()) { ... }
}

Yup,

I figured I'd go down that path. It just adds extra logic, because in one
case the 1st arg is an array, in the other its a bunch of strings.

Ok, so you the answer is "no", you can't do method overloading in php?

Yeah, I just handle that by putting a trap in, if the argument is an 
array I leave it alone but if it is a string I explode it.

AFAIK, Yes, the answer is no :)

I would guess it depends on a number of factors -- like whether or not  
the session file is in the OS filesystem cache, what type of hard  
drive you are using, etc.  I think the point John was making is that  
if the data doesn't change you might be able to recognize that there  
was no change and not write the session data at the end of the  
request.  With php's default session handler, it's going to write to  
the session file at the end of every request.  If you're not working  
on a medium to high volume traffic site, the performance difference  
probably isn't a big deal.

As a general rule of thumb, databases are faster for small bits of
data and the file system is faster for larger data.  Both the
filesystem and the database have memory caches, so reading data from a
file or the database repeatedly doesn't require going to the disk.

The problem with php sessions is that they force a write on every
request, which requires going to the disk every request.  This could
be mitigated with memcached or memory tables, but that has a whole
host of other problems.  I think if i had a session performance
problem (which I don't) I'd use a hybrid database/memcached solution
that only writes if the session has actually changed.  That way, you
would only have to hit the disk if required and your would be able to
restart mysql/memcached without destroying every session.

John Campbell

haha

I want to set the customException dynamically.

I tried doing so by passing it in as a var ... catch ($var $e)

but that didn't seem to work.

Can it be done?

Exceptions will bubble all the way up to the first place the code was  
called from... so usually you don't have to catch an exception just to  
throw another one.

I'm not sure... seems somewhat odd that you would need to do that...  
You could catch Exception which would get you everything and then use  
a switch on get_class:

try {
	// something
} catch (Exception $e) {
	switch (get_class($e)) {
		default:
			// blah
			break;
		case $customException:
			// handle it
			break;
	}
}

I'm curious, is there a reason readini is not used for config files in 
general?

Is it that much faster to include the config.php file as opposed to 
using readini?

Method overloading could mean overloading the method in a subclass so
to say "you can't do method overloading in php" is false. PHP does
support method overloading. It just doesn't support using the same
method name with different signatures.

But as you point out, PHP does allow optional / default values instead
which achieves a very similar result (and in fact I find it to be
superior in many ways).

No. But you do know that you can catch multiple different exceptions
at the same time right?

try {
   // do something
} catch (MyCustomException $mce) {
   // handle this type of exception here
} catch (SomeOtherException $soe) {
   // Only SomeOtherException exceptions will be caught here
} catch (Exception $e) {
   // All other types of exceptions will be caught here
}

That's overriding, not overloading.

Overloading is by definition exactly what it does not allow, having 
different methods of the same name with different signatures.

Overloading is a requirement for strongly typed languages, since PHP is 
not strongly typed it can get by without it.  I also find PHP's loose 
typing far more appropriate to its role as a string generator (sql, 
HTML), and appreciate its default values as part of its entire 
philosophy of flexibility.

You mean parse_ini_file, right? http://php.net/parse_ini_file

Ini files are more readable than php... but sometimes I think it's  
nice to have the flexibility of php in my config files to be able to  
put a little php in them... I guess what I'm thinking it more akin to  
the bootstrap file concept.

Parse_ini_file is part of the core php code, so it's probably pretty  
fast.  A pure PHP implementation would surely be too slow.  I would  
guess the performance difference with parse_ini_file (if significant)  
isn't reason enough to not use it if you prize readability... then  
again... maybe it's worth taking it one step farther and installing  
syck and the pecl ext/syck extension so you can read/write YAML:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] gettext help
Message-ID: <47640112.1050003@gmx.net>

Hi!

After creating a simple test project and going with xgettext at it I did 
successfully create the .po file, but found that concatenated strings aren't 
treated as one string. For example, I have this in my test script:
echo _("This is a string ".
        "that is concatenated ".
        "over three rows in one statement.");
xgettext reads that out as three individual strings. What I expected to happen 
is that a string within _() gets treated as one string and since I specified 
PHP as the language to deal with I further expected xgetttext to know how 
strings are concatenated in PHP and that any concatenated variables are to be 
ignored (although I haven't tested yet if it did that). I used the following 
command:
"C:\Program Files\Poedit\bin\xgettext.exe" -pF:\gettexttest\lang -a 
--language=PHP F:\gettexttest\*.php

I have concatenated strings all over the place after many people yelled at me 
that my lines in my scripts are longer than 80 chars. Any advice on how to 
make xgettext understand the dot?

Also, how can I specify an entire directory tree to be searched for php files 
rather than just one directory. I did see that one can specify the locations 
to be read from a file, but I couldn't find conclusive instructions on how to 
format that file.

I also tried using poedit to create the catalogs, but all I get is an error 
message that it couldn't find source files. The help doesn't really specify on 
where to set where to look for the source files.

I guess with some more time I could get used to gettext, but the motto "as 
simple as possible, but not simpler" requires that I redefine what I 
understand under "simple". What makes it even worse, the several tutorials 
that are available all have their own, often overly complicated approach. Most 
create extra functions and wrap functions into new functions.

I also wonder how gettext differentiates between text strings. It is possible 
that a string in two spots is the same for English, but different for German. 
Since gettext apparently keys off the english string, how can it differentiate?

Does anyone know of a good tutorial that doesn't try to get fancy in step 0?

While waiting for answers I will look into using ini file as string files. 
There are translation tools out there and ini files are simple enough to 
create one's own tools. Reading ini files is part of the php core...wait, 
wasn't there a discussion about this going on as well? The downside to that is 
that I'd need to create a new function and that I need to extract the strings 
manually, which in my case wouldn't be that horrible as there aren't that many.

Thanks in advance!

I have a class I created that I have been using for years to do  
almost exactly what you are looking to do. Although you don't really  
need to use PHP5 syntax to do it. I've attached the class file and an  
example file that shows how it works. The example is a calendar and  
it generates it's own example data array, but any array will work.  
Just put the files in a web accessible directory and call the  
listMaker.example.php file. This is just an example, so there are a  
number of things I am not doing, like sanitizing the form input data.

There are 3 essential settings to it:
1. The template for the data. In your case, it's what is in your  
while loop without the "tr"
2. The data, which is a multi-dimensional associative array. It's the  
array you get when you retrieve data from mysql the way you are.
3. The row delimiter. In your case "</tr><tr>"

When you call the makeList function, you tell it how many columns you  
want. It then creates however many rows are necessary based on the  
size of the data array. So if your data array has 9 items and you  
specify 3 columns, it will create 3 rows.

I did not mention pagination, because you should only be retrieving  
enough records from the database to build the page, not all the data.  
You would do this by adding a "LIMIT" clause to your query. There was  
a pagination discussion not too long ago, you should search the  
archives for that discussion.

Hope that helps.

xgettext is not a full blown php parser.  Maybe making an exception to
the 80 char rule is a good idea for strings that need to be
translated.  Does your application have good separation between
presentation logic and application logic?  Keep in mind that if you
make your own translation method, there will be no xgettext at all.

This is trivial with a *nix shell.  I am useless with the windows
shell.  Maybe someone on this list can explain how to emulate the
behavior of "xargs" and "find" in the windows shell.  My solution
would be to install cygwin, but that is like killing a gnat with a
sledgehammer.

I have only used po edit to open and edit .po files.  The catalogue
manager is for translators who have many projects.  You need to
consolidate all of your po files to one master file, and just open
that with PoEdit.  Use msgmerge to merge po files.

The expression "as simple as possible, but not simpler" is an Einstein
quote about General Relativity.  Gettext is not quite that bad, but it
ain't simple either.

This is a pitfall, but I have never found it to be an issue. Do you
actually have this problem?  In theory, it seems like it would be a
problem, but in practice I have never found it to be an issue.

You may be trying to translate too many one word phrases.  For
instance, don't do:
_('Showing') ." $pos " . _("of") . " $total";
do :
sprintf(_('Showing %d of %d'),$pos,$total);
or if you need reordering:
sprintf(_('Showing %1$d of %2$d'),$pos,$total);

If it is still a problem, you could hack it with:
You could hack it with:
$text = _("back::as in - scratch my back, not a back button")
$text = preg_replace("/::.*/,'',$text);

> Does anyone know of a good tutorial that doesn't try to get fancy in step 0?

No, but I think you are taking the right approach.  Learn the basics,
and then proceed from there.  You are 60% of the way to a gettext
epiphany.

I didn't know you were trying to do this on a windows enviroment.
Without decent command line tools, it may be tricky to make it
seamless.  Consider writing some .bat files to help with the merging
and building of the po files.

A couple of other things:
Are you using a templating framework?  If you are using smarty, you
will need a plugin.

Does your editor allow regex search and replace? It is really helpful
if you have a bunch of strings.

Hi!

First of all, thanks John for your reply. Yes, I do use the WAMPP stack, which 
in several tests happened to come up on top in regards to performance compared 
to LAMPP and IIS. I am not surprised that it performs better than IIS, but was 
suprised about the LAMPP. Although, performance wasn't the reason I chose it. 
I have a W2k Pro box with server SCSI drives that is rock solid and runs for 
months without problems. My record is 9 months without reboot, unheard of in 
the Windows world. And if there is a reboot, it is because Patch Tuesday.

I did dig a bit deeper into gettext and the tools that are available on *nix 
are mostly ported to doze as well. I got tired of the resulting .po files to 
be littered with all kinds of string garbage or less than half the strings no 
matter what I did.
Plan B was writing two simple functions, one that reads in a specified ini 
file into an array, and when a section was specified, returns only that 
section while ditching the remains. The second function accepts a key and a 
default string (the current english string) and has to get passed on the array 
with the strings. I crafted an ini file with 300 entries and strings that each 
are about 200 chars. In my first test I had PHP barf up the entire array, then 
in a second test pick out random strings. I braced for the worst, but turns 
out that this is really fast.
My plan is to create sections for each script that generates output, read in 
the file, then based on the name of the script keep the required section and 
throw the rest away (hoping that PHP releases the memory used). Overall, the 
two functions are less than a dozen lines of code.
That approach has two disadvantages. The code once instrumented gets more 
difficult to read, but using some one or two letter name for my function and a 
short array name will condense the calls. It is not as  short as _(), well, I 
could name my function _, but I don't think that is a good idea. Maybe ~() or 
?() isn't taken yet. The other disadvantage is the manual string extraction, 
but I need to rework all echos anyway and given the state of the .po files 
those would need some massive manual cleanup work as well.

My scripts aren't as logic / display separated as they could be, but I do make 
a point in preparing everything first and then focus on output as much as 
possible, but still, it is sometimes within the same script. I go with the ini 
file approach and see how that works out. The tests worked much better than I 
expected. I then can also expand the functions to accept additional parameters 
if needed.

I found that PHP doesn't like ~ as a function name, but ? is fine. After 
reading in the ini file or a portion of it I can now craft echos as such
echo ?(123456, $l, "This is the default string.");
with the integer being the numeric key (alphanumeric would work as well, but 
with alphas in the key spellchecking the ini string file is a pita), $l the 
array that contains the string for the current script, and the optional string 
being a default text if the requested string is not found.
I may get back to it and refine the ? function to pass things like a number or 
a date along that then needs to be inserted into the correct position, but I 
will see if I need this for my app. If anyone is interested in the functions 
let me know and I'll post them.

So long, gettext, maybe next time....

I don't have one of those on my keyboard... You might want to pick
something that is in 7-bit ascii to avoid character set problems.  T()
seems like a good name.

It is unfortunate that you are giving up on gettext.  I am sure your
solution will work, but I think in the long run it is going to be
extra effort because the function now has 3 parameters rather than
one.  You also don't need to bother testing performance on
200x300=60kb of data.  No matter what you do, it will be fast.  Once
you have 1Mb of data, then there will start to be a difference because
gettext will use 1Mb of memory per language, and your solution will
write 1Mb to memory every request.  Btw, how are you testing
performance?  Pure php, ab, or something else?

Cheers,
John Campbell

To be quite honest, overloading is rarely ever
necessary even in a language with static types.

The temptation is to use overloading where default
values for parameters are reasonable.  Using
overloading in place of default parameter values leads
to Run-On Initialization bug patterns where part of
the object instantiation code is apart from the
constructor.  This is a code smell, and the only
reason it might have for existing is its legacy code
and "making it right" might actually break it.

If overloading is used for some other reason, then
it's likely still a code smell.  However, instead of
Run-On Initialization, the code smells would be code
duplication and exposing structure.  Typically,
overloading might be used because requirements
changed.  e.g., you thought it was a good idea to use
a formatted string to determine the internal structure
of an object.  This often results in Broken Dispatch
bug patterns.  These aren't usually very obvious when
performing maintenance on code, because typically any
maintenance error only manifests itself in another
class that was depending upon the previously exposed
internal structure.  Yet, for composing objects with
complex graph structures, there are superior
approaches that are more flexible for maintenance. 
One correct approach is to use a Builder pattern and
inject the built structure into the constructor. 
Algorithms should be bound to data structures as late
as possible, and that is another way to say, "program
to an interface, not an implementation".

These nefarious issues with overloading are not at all
obvious, especially the Broken Dispatch, and therefore
a good reason to stay away from overloading whenever
possible.

Ad-hoc polymorphism is more useful, and is sometimes
mistaken for overloading.  Ad-hoc polymorphism is a
way to provide more specific dynamic method dispatch,
helps provide late binding, and thus allows the
execution path to be determined at run-time.

Well, you need to get a better keyboard then, one that has an Alt Gr key and 
none of these windows buttons like my good 'ol Cheery. It is the first 
keyboard I ever bought (about 20 years ago). ;) I change it, it was more 
curiosity and a futile attempt at being kewl than rational thinking.

Oh, the super scientific method of running it in the debugger and see what 
happens. I found that pulling it through the debugger makes everything extra 
slow compared to the production system (not that I expected it any different). 
I have some sections that take about a second from request to page display, 
but on the production side it is an unnoticeable delay. I could put in 
measures using microtime or such, but since I do not have a base line that 
becomes useless, nothing to compare it to. This was really just a subjective test.
Also, the ini file approach has one big and one smaller advantage over 
gettext: one does not have to restart the web server in order to load the 
updated strings and one also does not need the gettext extension to be enabled.
The three parameters are something I am not too happy about, ideally it would 
have been two, the key and the default string, which is optional. But I need 
to pass the array to the function otherwise the function doesn't know anything 
about that array. I could make it global, which saves four characters in the call.
1 MB of strings is a lot. I worked on professional desktop apps that had 
external string files and those were 400 or 500 kB max. You also got to see 
how much stuff gettext puts around each string (useful stuff). Using integer 
keys cuts down on data size to be handled right there. Although, when you say 
"1 Mb of data", do you mean mbit or mbyte (your notation indicates mbit)? And 
does that refer to file size or data size of strings only? In any case, I 
doubt that I will end up with that many strings for my app either way.
I think gettext is a good solution per s?, but the tools wrapped around it are 
lacking a bit of comfort. What would be nice is to have a parser go through 
the PHP files and allow for manual intervention right there allowing to reject 
strings and combine concatenated, while after accepting a string the source 
code gets updated to use the correct call. When trofitting one has to touch 
each string anyway.

Well, let's see with how many strings I end up. I think that I will first work 
on my CSH functions so that I can put that in as well while crawling through 
the code.

It depends on what your doing.

As an example, what if your the message text for an email someone sends 
to your site.  It's just one field, and you put your logo and framing 
around it, but without much explanatory text.

Now, I trick someone with an account on your site to post to that form 
and display the following text:
"There is a problem with your account.  Please contact scumsucker at 
212-000-0000 and have your account name and the credit card number 
associated with the account to verify account ownership".


Opps, not such a good idea to display that on your site!

Using php, you can define constants, arrays, objects, and localized strings.

Message-ID: <AE49ED75-A5A1-4D7F-83F0-604B692BA5C1@jellyandcustard.com>

Hi Guys,

I'm connecting to a SOAP Server that is being run under Perl.  
Unfortunately, there is no WSDL for this server, and all I have to go  
on is legacy Perl code.

When I receive back a response from the SOAP Server, the data is  
wrapped in gensym tags:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
xmlns:soapenc="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"  
xmlns:apachens="http://xml.apache.org/xml-soap" xmlns:xsd="http:// 
www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" soap:encodingStyle="http:// 
schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" xmlns:soap="http:// 
schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
<soap:Body>
<API_ExecuteResponse xmlns="http://server.co.uk/API">
<s-gensym1437 xsi:type="xsd:string">
remote_pass</s-gensym1437>
<s-gensym1439 xsi:type="xsd:string">
*****</s-gensym1439>
<s-gensym1441 xsi:type="xsd:string">
password</s-gensym1441>
<s-gensym1443 xsi:type="xsd:string">
*****</s-gensym1443>
<s-gensym1453 xsi:type="xsd:string">
error_string</s-gensym1453>
<s-gensym1455 xsi:nil="true" />

</API_ExecuteResponse>
</soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

(Above has been snipped).

In the Perl code, the above is handled internally, and it will create  
the key=>value pairs as an array. However, I can't get this to work  
in PHP.

The perl code makes use of $result->paramsout; to do this (it appears).

To make things even more difficult, the digits within the gensym tags  
are randomly assigned, so each request is different.

Any ideas what I can do to get this to work? If I had a WSDL, would  
this problem be rectified?

Cheers,
Khalid

The php.net site on this is pretty good:

http://us3.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php

I'm going to assume that was the missing piece in the puzzle for you,
otherwise you'll have quite a bit to read about interfacing with a MySQL
database and coming up with a schema to represent the data you have.

Overloading in C++ can be useful to 'line up' your
classes so that you can use them in templates

But since we're discussing PHP, I would say
that you couldn't be any more right --
especially about the 'smelly code'

Hi!

I'm trying to re-install Apache, version 2.0.59 (running with PHP 
5.2.5 and MySQL 5.0.45). The problem arises when trying to restart 
Apache after installing PHP. Before this step, I get the Apache logo, 
and everything seems fine.

Installation of PHP goes fine, and all the .ini and .conf files are 
updated, but when Apache tries to start I get a long list of missing 
DLLs. The list includes:

LIBEAY32.dll
sqlite.dll
aspell-15.dll		
DB2CLI.dll		
ICLIT09B.dll		
intl3_svn.dll		
isqlt09a.dll		
lcrzo.dll		
libcs.dll		
libmonetra.dll		
libSQLDBC_C.dll		
OCI.dll			
OCIW32.dll		

Two of the files are identifiable in closely related (but different) names:

LIBEAY32.dll		4 different versions of libeay32.dll!
sqlite.dll		as php_sqlite.dll

Does anyone have any ideas how to track these files down? I have a 
note from an earlier installation (February 2006) that restarting 
Apache after installing PHP was 'tricky', but in my eagerness back 
then, I went no further towards noting just how tricky it had been (:-()

I'm guessing that the references are coming from php5apache.dll, but 
the files weren't in the PHP distro!

Thanks for any advice!

Tony

Hello and Greetings To All,

"The closing PHP tag isn't required and actually stops people breaking
things. We removed it intentionally, since some customers were adding
whitespace to the end and getting blank pages / cookie errors."

This was posted by a senior developer for a VERY popular PHP product.

Any body care to comment on this, I am a little disturbed about where
it came from having had the white space after the tag problem on more
than one of the products I have had the joy to troubleshoot... but I
don't think dropping the closing tag was ever a solution that I
entertained. I just think its a poor and sloppy approach to problem
solving. Any comments?

Omitting the closing tag is often considered good form, and for some
projects is mandatory style.

If you want to avoid "sloppiness" you can always end your scripts with:

// EOF

or something similar to indicate that the script hasn't been truncated.

Just to fully clarify this, I have seen the same argument put forth for 
a few projects, one thing they all have in common is using ob_start and 
saving all content generated to the buffer, before finally releasing it 
at the end.

Personally, I'm nor a big fan of buffering the output like that because 
it leads to a laggier looking display(when you don't buffer, the page 
loads as it is built, instead of waiting on a blank page untill the page 
is generated and then appearing in one block)

However, I do see the attraction and even necessity for some 
products...like a certain CMS I like to use.  :-)

Personally, I'd be more concerned about the missing comments and 
documentation than a missing closing tag.

Hi Tony,
I'm not a Windows guy, but afaik you should double check your
httpd.conf file: into the 'LoadModule' directive for PHP5, just make
sure you are referencing to php5apache2.dll rather than php5apache.dll
(if this dll still exists) since you are using apache 2.0.x; also, do
make sure the 'extension_dir' directive in php.ini is referencing the
right php's extensions folder in your filesystem.
Also, copying some of the dlls you mentioned into the apache's bin
folder might help, it happened to a friend of mine while dealing with
some specific dlls for the mssql extension, and might be applicable to
your case although you are not using mssql but oracle, as I can see
from your post.
Hope this helps!
Just check the above steps out, and let us know!

Hi again,
Forgot to mention: also make sure you are commenting out all the php
extensions you don't need. Extensions like oci8 or db2 do require a
client installation for these databases in the same machine running
apache/php; if you do not have these db clients, you can get errors
like not found dlls. You might also want to consider installing the
php binaries exploding the tarball and dealing with the installation
manually following the included readme files rather than using (if you
did so) an installer.
Let us know how it goes!

So how does the parser know where PHP ends and HTML starts?

Simple, PHP starts where you have <?php (or an alternative that has been 
configured) and PHP ends where there is a ?> and HTML starts.

IE
<?php
// this is PHP code
?>
This is html
<?php
// this is some more PHP
?>
This is more html
<?php
//this is more PHP

// This is the end of the file


You don't need a closing tag at the end of the file if you don't place 
any HTML code at the end.

And since there are some operating systems where some editors will stick 
a blank space at the end of a file accidentally, not placing the closing 
?> on the file means if some extra spaces/lines get added to the end of 
the file, they are not treated as HTML.

Thanks for explaining, but I wonder why the </html> tag doesn't take care of 
that. Once the html tag is closed anything after that ought to be ignored by a 
browser. That is not the case?

The discussing is regarding the PHP interpreter, not the browser.

The problem is dealing with HTML data sent from the script to the 
browser.  The data is, for convenience and simplicity, in 2 parts.  The 
"header" data and the "content" - header here does not mean the HTML 
header section, but the actual header(where you send cookies and other 
information).

When sending data from a server to a client, all the header information 
has to come /before/ the content.

When your including say...12 different files into a page, sometimes 
script number 8 needs to send header information.  So the practice is to 
accumulate all the content information into a variable, and send that at 
the end of the script.

This makes it no longer possible to mix HTML and PHP code in a 
document(ok, it's possible, but outside the scope of this email) as the 
second you have a raw HTML outside the PHP execution tags, you have lost 
your chance of sending header data and are into the sending of body data.

The problem is when at the end of a file you place ?>[space]

The PHP interpreter sees that there is a charector after the ?> and 
sends it.  So now content has begun and you can no longer send headers.

Of course, that is less ugly than the
?> <?

Mistake, with a space between the two(less ugly because at least at the 
end of the file you can blame the editor!  In the middle of the file 
it's purely your fault, and why did you close and open the PHP execution 
tag to begin with!?)

I remember reading that and it immediately seemed like a great idea.  
How many times have you tried a redirect or set a cookie, only to get  
the error "Headers already sent". That extra return after the  
closing ?> causes the headers to be sent, since you are delivering  
content. You also avoid extra characters being sent.
Did you ever look at the source code of a web site and see dozens (or  
more) of blank lines together? Anything after the closing ?> gets  
sent to the client, even if it's just a bunch of extra returns.

I can't think of a good reason to include the closing ?> if you don't  
specifically need it.

I was browsing the MediaWiki repository (the code behind wikipedia)
one day and I saw that someone removed all of the closing tags.  I
immediately thought it was smart and did the same thing to my code.
Excluding the closing tag at the end of the file is a *good idea*.
Are there any "sed" gurus on the list that can write a 1 liner to
remove the closing tags?

David,

This does not apply to files that mix php and html.  This is for php
only files, such as classes, or config files.   If your application
separates the presentation logic from the application logic, you will
have lots of files that are pure php and this prevents those scripts
from inadvertently sending output to the browser.

John Campbell

Ah! Now I understand and see where the problem is. I am surprised that I 
haven't run into this so far, but maybe I am just lucky or the IDEs I use take 
of this.
Thanks! You should seek a carreer as instructor. :)

I do use scripts that do not output anything, but I usually run a browser 
redirect within the code once done and before the closing tag, so I guess it 
wouldn't matter in my case as the bogus content would come after the redirect 
and it also doesn't matter once content is sent. I don't think I have any 
scripts so far that would cause this problem, but good to know that this issue 
exists.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Andromeda MySQL hackathon
Message-ID: <47682B32.2090805@secdat.com>

Hi everybody,

The Long Island PHP group is contemplating a hack-a-thon to make 
Andromeda build mySQL databases.  I just brought this up this afternoon, 
so there are no firm plans, but we are talking about at least one long 
Saturday plus maybe Friday evening before and Sunday after. 

The goal is to have Andromeda provide all of its database features to 
MySQL databases.  The plan is to talk it through ahead of time so 
everybody has a pretty good idea of what they'll be coding when they 
arrive.  This is very doable if we have a few people who know MySQL 
pretty well and if we talk it through ahead of time.  Andromeda 
intentionally only uses a very few back-end building blocks, so as to 
make things like this possible.

The bulk of it will probably be very annoying translations.  So for 
instance Postgres requires a certain syntax for IF/THEN in triggers, and 
I have no doubt MySQL will want the commas and semis in different 
places, that kind of stuff.  Same kind of thing for any syntax 
variations in create table commands, create indexes, and so forth.

Remote and on-site participation is welcome.  Food and beverages will be 
provided, and an internet connection and a flat surface for the laptops!

If you are interested, please subscribe to the Andromeda general mailing 
list, as I will be moving the conversation about this over to there next 
week.  That is available on sourceforge:

Message-ID: <000b01c84267$d7dd5310$8797f930$@com>

Hi Everyone,

 

I am trying to check if a program is installed on the server through PHP. In
particular, FFMPEG. In Linux, I can just run "ffmpeg", and the shell will
throw an error if it isn't found. The same happens in Windows.

 

Is there a way I can figure out if FFMPEG is installed on the server
(Windows or Linux)?  I know I can try something like shell_exec(), but it
doesn't seem to work too well if the command isn't found.

 

Thanks,

Alexey

FFMPEG was a PITA to setup for me.

Got it working though, converting .wmv's to .flv.

There is a PHP library for accessing some functions of FFMPEG.
This is helpful for the setup:

Note: just wait untill you get a corrupted wmv file which plays fine on 
windows media player but keeps truncating when converted to FLV.  When 
you have really weird errors, I suggest submitting the file to Google 
Video and Youtube and see if they convert it ok.

If they don't, than you can let the submitter know their file is 
corrupt.  If a billion dollar company can't convert it in an automated 
fashion, it's highly unlikely anyone can.

I've had bad experience w/a client who was using host gator. We needed 
to run php5 and I had to spend
a few hours to get them to upgrade us to php5 from php4. It was a pita.

I use nexcess.net, they are amazing. Amazing! Been using them for a over 
a year, maybe two,
w/a 30 node reseller account. Excellent customer support, very smart, 
quick, great stability,
centOS w/php5, mysql, phpmyadmin on all the panels, great domain 
management, etc.

SSH access if you need it! ( no additional cost) SSL if you need it. 
They are great!

No bullshit phpwebforum scripts and crap like that.

Ben,

Thanks for the recommendation, unfortunately the space they offer vs. the
high price didn't go by too well with the higher ups.  Approximately how
long ago was your PHP 4/5 conversion issue?

SSH access if you need it! ( no additional cost) SSL if you need it. 
They are great!

No bullshit phpwebforum scripts and crap like that.

you can also check dreamhost (who's affiliate program I am a member  
of), they have a nice way of setting up users and managing bandwidth  
and space for accounts which is great for reselling. you can also  
choose between php 4 and 5, and there are other niceties. Caveat -  
there are some issues though (check http://www.dreamhoststatus.com).

for the price I find it's worth it, and I basically post this same  
email every time someone asks for hosting options ;)

good luck in your choice,

We have about 27000 files that might need to be migrated.  Couple of big SQL
databases (1gb max) and then personal office storage lockers.

Online DVD... I would but then there are all those laws I would be
breaking...

I'm very happy with sevenl.net.  Lots of personal attention and 
going-rate pricing.

heh,

Yeah, I don't store lots of stuff on these servers (email me for the 
secret stash, hehe) so I haven't run into
those limitations.

I know nexcess will create custom plans, so please email support if you 
really know what you want.

Good luck!

Kind of a side note but, some might find this interesting:

I was hosting a 1U at my house, public facing for about 6 months.

I didn't notice the electricity.

When I moved from an apartment to a house, I realized I was paying 
+-$100.00/month
for this thing.

Crazy.

Kind of a side note but, some might find this interesting:

I was hosting a 1U at my house, public facing for about 6 months.

I didn't notice the electricity.

When I moved from an apartment to a house, I realized I was paying 
+-$100.00/month
for this thing.

Crazy.

Message-ID: <E1J56t0-0001yV-00@pop-gadwall.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

What a difference a day makes!

Turns out that I had missed a little "2" on a directory name - not 
content with having to remove all the "5"s from PHP5 for this 
install, I had to add "2"s to the Apache stuff, and one got lost in httpd.conf

Many thanks to Matteo Rinaudo for the suggestion.  Now onwards to see 
if it fixed the problem I was having with the interpreter!

You guys are great!

Message-ID: <78c6bd860712191913r1fe2df96j64b9a4c90ec5e7e6@mail.gmail.com>

I have a bunch of subclasses that define a static varible that I need
to access in the parent class. So I'm trying something like:

$_staticvarname = get_class($this) . '::$_staticvar';
print_r($$_staticvarname);

But this doesn't work. I just get:

  Undefined variable: Sublcass::$_staticvar

If I do:

  print_r(Subclass::$_staticvar)

it works so I know it's just an evaluation issue.

I can't use const because the variable is an array. I don't want to
hardcode the subclass name in the parent class and I want to use a
static variable reasoning that it uses less memory.

Is there any way to do this?

Mike

Humm...

The only thing I can think of is to do something like:
$v = get_class_vars(get_class($this));
print_r($v['_staticvar']);

Kind of a shitty hack, and it reminds me of one thing that pisses me
off about php.
Why can't we do:
print_r(get_class_vars(get_class($this))['_staticvar']);

Try using double quotes instead of single quotes:

$_staticvarname = get_class($this) . "::$_staticvar";

Variables are not evaluated when surrounded by single quotes

This does work in my case.

But, I the code could get invoked quite a bit which makes me wonder if
the overhead of calling those functions and building the vars array
would offset the benefit of storage savings from using a static array.

I have opted for the KISS approach and just used a non-static array instead.

That is a neat trick though. I'll have to remember this one.

Thanks,
Mike

Hi,
if I understood your issue correctly, then in C++, Java, and PHP5 you'd do
something like this:

abstract class Foo {

public function doit()
{
echo $this->gettext();
}

abstract protected function gettext();
}

class Bar extends Foo {
static $msg = "this is some text\n";
public function gettext() {
return self::$msg;
}
}

$tmp = $Bar;
$tmp->doit();


Or you can get rid of the 'abstract' part and just define Foo::gettext() to
do "nothing" if that make sense.

Yeah the method to wrap the variable is a bit annoying, but you can think of
it this way... the parent class doesn't care if it's static or not.  It just
wants the variable.  The fact the children wanted to use a static is their
choice.

hope this made sense... looks like you found a another nifty way of doing
it.

enjoy!

Actually this lead me to a solution that didn't use the static array
at all. I really just wanted the child class to be able to map some
strings. So I just some if return blocks in the overridden method:

    protected function mapName($name)
    {
        if ($name === 'foo') return 'bar';
        if ($name === 'zig') return 'zag';
        return $name;
    }

The parent version just returns $name unchanged. No need for the
static array at all.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Need some JS / HTML help
Message-ID: <476D84FC.7030904@gmx.net>

Hi!

I have this hyperlink
<a 
href="http://localhost:8080/file:/F:/piviviewer/include/help/en_us/Default_CSH.htm#100">?</a>
that I use to access context sensitive webhelp. The link works fine and the 
help shows. That is the good part, the bad part is that all my tries to make 
it show up in a new window so far didn't even do something. I am basically at 
this point:
echo "<a 
onClick=\"javascript:window.open('".$href."','HelpWindow',toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,copyhistory=no,resizable=yes');\">?</a><noscript><a 
href=\"".$href."\">?</a></noscript>";

Obviously, something is majorly wrong with that. I did check the O'Reilly 
HTML&XHTML Definitie Guide to make sure that the a link has the onClick event. 
After getting this to work I also want to attach it to a button, which should 
be the same call.

Anyone has a good idea on how to craft this? I'm just at the end of my very 
limited HTML latin.

Thanks in advance!

David

Here is an ezample on how to do it with a popup but I think that you can
also do it
if you put a link and set the target to blank  "target=blank"
The Target Attribute

With the target attribute, you can define * where* the linked document will
be opened.

The line below will open the document in a new browser window:

<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"
target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>

	<br />
	<br />
This popup window is a completely separate HTML file that was opened
using JavaScript. This file can contain
whatever you want.</p>

<p>The JavaScript command to close a window is to refer
to the window by name, or by self-reference, and use the close method.
The link below looks like:
<pre>
    &lt;a href="javascript:self.close()"&gt;close window&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p><b><a href="javascript:self.close()">Close this Window</a></b></p>

Hi!

Thanks Nestor, your examples helped at least to point me to the right 
direction although you didn't copy the popup code, but the stuff that is in 
the popup window. But I found the source page and could figure it out, 
although their approach didn't work for me, but see below.

OK, I got the target in the regular hyperlink all set and that works at least 
for those cases where JavaScript isn't an option. I still can't get anything 
from JavaScript. What I did see in the Defintive Guide that one can write the 
JS code into the fref attribute. That causes the browser to render the link, 
which it didn't do before, and it opens the desired window, but it also 
navigates away from the source page and in Firefox at least shows a blank page 
with the text [object window]. It is halfways there, but as bad as before somehow.
But while I was writing this I got another idea that led to another idea and 
some more googling and now I got it. I don't really know why it works, but it 
does work:
<a href="" 
onClick="javascript:window.open('http://localhost:8080/file:/F:/piviviewer/include/help/en_us/Default_CSH.htm#100', 
'HelpWindow', 
'toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,copyhistory=no,resizable=yes,width=350,height=250');">?</a>

What I'm surprised about is that in order to get a link rendered the href 
attribute needs to be present, but when no URL is specified the click on the 
link doesn't do anything, but the onClick event fires and executes the code.

But then I tried a subsequent link / button and as it turns out the popup is 
behind the main window. So I needed to find a way to give it focus and after 
some more googling I got this:

<button onClick="javascript:var 
w=window.open('http://localhost:8080/file:/F:/piviviewer/include/help/en_us/Default_CSH.htm#100', 
'HelpWindow', 
'toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,copyhistory=no,resizable=yes,width=800,height=550'); 
w.focus(); return false;">Help Me</button><noscript><a 
href="http://localhost:8080/file:/F:/piviviewer/include/help/en_us/Default_CSH.htm#100" 
target="HelpWindow">Help Me</a></noscript>

And I got the CSH portion also down and with my little function I can 
customize the button caption or only show a ? or have a text link with custom 
text. I then tried the code without JavaScript enabled to see if the 
<noscript> portion works, but that doesn't do a thing. If anyone knows how to 
add the proper noscript code, let me know.

David,

Try javascript:void(0) for your herf. 

<a href="javascript: void(0)">Ilink</a>

Sorry, didn't mean to send a short and Curt reply. Javascript:void(0) in the herf will stop the browser from navigating away from the current page. i have used it in similar situations, where an onclick is required.

Nasir

Here is my link crafted accordingly
<a 
href="http://localhost:8080/file:/F:/piviviewer/include/help/en_us/Default_CSH.htm#100" 
target="HelpWindow" onClick="var 
w=javascript:window.open('http://localhost:8080/file:/F:/piviviewer/include/help/en_us/Default_CSH.htm#100', 
'HelpWindow', 
'toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,copyhistory=no,resizable=yes,width=800,height=550'); 
w.focus(); return false;">?</a>

While it works without JavaScript, it ends up to work the same with JavaScript 
enabled...or better to say, the JavaScript code never gets executed even when 
JavaScript is enabled. In your example you load either the tab or the entire 
new page into the same window that is currently in use. I want to have a JS 
popup and when JS is disabled a plain link into a new window )ends up to be a 
new tab in the modern browsers, which is OK). In this constellation the JS 
popup never shows up. I guess that the browser gives href preference over the 
onClick event.

I will see that I add a generic help link into the page header using an href 
only. So when JS is disabled the user has at least a chance to get to the 
help, it just doesn't come with CSH and the extra window. I could find a 
better fix if there is a way to detect if the browser has JS enabled without 
executing any JS. All solutions I've seen so far pass a value, have JS update 
and return it. If you get the same value back then JS is disabled, but that 
strikes as very ugly. I basically provoke a 'crash', catch it, then act upon 
that. It would be much nicer if browsers send over what they can and can't do 
in the response.

That doesn't seem to work the way I want to. It appears as that the href takes 
precedence over the onClick, which basically causes the link to do nothing. 
Yes, Javascript:void(0); prevents naviagtion away from the page, but it also 
disables the onClick code. I tried it in both Firefox and IE, and while 
Firefox just doesn't do anything IE complains about a semicolon missing in a 
spot where I put a semicolon. Microsoft's error messages are always beyond 
useless.

I went back to using href="" instead, which appears to work OK.
I expanded my function to accept a different parameter so that it can create a 
plain simple link. That makes it easier even when someone finds a good way to 
detect JS, it needs to be done only once and the parameter to be passed can be 
set accordingly.

Thanks for your help.

Thanks for the tip! That is indeed so. But how does the browser know which 
type of client side scripting language that is to be?

But while testing this, I noiticed that with JS enabled the MadCap Flare 
WebHelp won't work anyway...gotta file a bug report, because then it is most 
likely not 508 compliant either. Not that my pages are...

Thanks for all your help, I made note in the comments about NYPHP's awesome 
support.

David,

I believe all handlers default to JavaScript (at least that's the experience
I've had).  If you wish to explicitly identify it as JavaScript use
onclick="javascript:..." making sure "javascript:" comes before all of your
JavaScript code.

I've tried different PHP versions (5.2.1, 5.2.3) and different

Message-ID: <476FD386.4020605@gmx.net>

Hi!

In case you don't already know this, NORAD tracks Santa for us...at least 
something useful is done with our tax money.
http://www.noradsanta.org

The story behind this is funny. Some time in the 50's a department store 
started an ad campaign before christmas that allow children to call a number 
and talk to Santa. Unfortunately, the paper misprinted the number and the ad 
showed a secret, unlisted number of the NORAD command center. The officers 
there were quite suprised when out of a sudden the red telephone rang off the 
hook with children at the other end asking to talk to Santa. Since then NORAD 
uses its gear each year to track Santa....and not the moon mistaken it for a 
squad of russian bombers until some low level tech noticed that the distance 
was quite off and was equal to that between earth and moon. It's a nice page 
and kids love it...needs Flash though.

In any case, meery christmas ...or whatever you want to celebrate around this 
time...yea, like festivus, isn't that today?

Message-ID: <476FD8CB.1050506@nyphp.com>

After a new install of xampp on Windows, I am having trouble getting
MySQL running properly, and therefore also phpMyAdmin. Apache is
looking at port 80, and MySQL at 3306 (according the the xampp control
panel). Localhost works correctly (I can run non-db dependent websites
there). Mytest.exe reports inability to connect to the server on 3306.
phpMyAdmin reports "Cannot start session without errors, please check
errors given in your PHP and/or webserver log file and configure your
PHP installation properly." I don't find any errors in Apache's logs,
and no error notices anywhere else (I may be overlooking some
somewhere).  Can anybody help?

First thing I'd do is check if the service is running (My Computer > Manage > 
Services and Applications > Services). If the service is running, echk the 
details of it and see if it really is running the executable that you think it 
should be running. I once installed XAMPP without making sure that a different 
instance was properly uninstalled. The new install went to a different 
directory and that was a problem. You should also see any MySQL service 
related problems in the application and / or system log.
If you can't see anything wrong there, get the admin tools from MySQL and use 
those. While I do like phpMyAdmin I also found it to not work properly at some 
times without any real reason. Besides that, it can't do several things or at 
least makes them to be fairly complicated compared to MySQL's own tools (which 
aren't great either, Luckasoft's MySQL client is much better as are many others).
If you cannot connect using these tools I recommend to uninstall XAMPP again, 
make sure that all the services are wiped out, delete any residue in the file 
system, reboot, and then try again. If all that still does not work and the 
service cannot start, check if there is anything else running on the port. If 
not, you could also try to install a bare MySQL to see if there is anything 
wrong with the XAMPP install, which I somewhat doubt as our friends from 
Berlin typically do an awesome job.

Beyond that, I don't know what else other than to suspect that your Windows 
install is missing some substantial pieces. Before reformatting the drive you 
want to dig deeper and find out what is going on. Do you use that system for 
anything else? Although radical, reinstalling the whole system may be faster 
in the end (this is why I always have a ghost image floating around that makes 
that a bit easier). I am sure you find the problem before looking at this 
option. Unlike MS SQL / SQL Express installing MySQL was always a piece of cake.

HTH,

David

Hi Todd,

Could you tell us which methods are experiencing the problem?
Could you show us the data you are sending and what you expect to receive?
Judging by the naming of the directory in the error below, it seems
that you are using a package (commercial or open source) of some
sorts?  Which package is it?
Did this ever work for you?  Perhaps in 5.1x?

Thanks,

Tom

Something to understand about Dreamhost... they are Extremely efficient 
at their operations. That's Extremely with a capital "E". They will do 
just about anything to gain efficiencies... and you will notice that 
alot. The trick is to work with it to your advantage.

Got low traffic? They will give you low bandwidth. Got big traffic? Ask 
for it and they give you appropriate servers/services. Forget to ask (or 
if they don't notice themselves) and your site will not serve its users 
very well. If you have a stable site, Dreamhost can be a dream. If you 
have a fluctuating site, you are likely to be very frustrated *unless* 
you communicate with them about your performance and expectations, in 
which case it can still be very good and extremely good when factoring 
in the cost.

Lots more can be said, but probably OT for this forum.

Did you do what Jake proposed on the 17th? It would be nice to know if you 
want to understand what PHP & MySQL are doing and how the code works, or if 
you just need some piece of software that works. If it is the latter, use 
Google. If you want to know how things work, you better start reading a bit 
and ask more specific questions. Especially, what you want to do with MySQL. 
Honestly, a database table is IMHO the worst place to store an entire image. I 
recommend storing a file path and before display making sure that the file 
still exists (see file_exists() in PHP manual).
I am currently working on a system that will do what you are asking for, but I 
am not done yet. I could give you my alpha code and a sample database, but 
that is it for now. I do not have any install scripts, I do not have any 
finished documentation, and I do not have the time to fill someone in and give 
support.

I did a two second search on Google and found this
http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/php-photoalbum.htm
That ought to do it.
Otherwise use this search URL
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=mysql+php+picture+viewer&btnG=Google+Search
and go through the first twenty hits. If you can't find anything that is easy 
enough, try Jeoren Wijering's Image Rotator at
http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=JW_Image_Rotator
That guy is awesome and I'd wish I had the money and influence to hire him 
into a company I work for. In regards to visuals I haven't seen anything 
better. He is always busy and while he does like to help people out, he just 
doesn't have the time to hold everyone's hand. So don't bother ask him a 
question like "How do I install this?". Jeroen created some very basic, but 
sufficient documentation. Read it and spend some time trying things out. 
Install a web server (I recommend to the apachefriends.org 's XAMMP, read 
their documentation, too - again, a group of selfless young people who spend 
their spare time for the greater good) on your PC and try things out locally. 
Once you have a good understanding of what you want, what you don't want, and 
how the basics of PHP and MySQL work make a decision and either go with that, 
or come back here and ask questions other than "give me working source code".

OK, that is way more information than your inquiry deserved, but today is 
Christmas, so what the heck.

Check the source code of the resulting page and see if the value for the <img> 
tag points to a location from where the image can be retrieved. When you see 
the X the browser cannot download the image as the file is not found in the 
specified location.

There a three methods that are giving me that error. They are
CreateReceivablesInvoice, CreateSalesOrder, and CreatePayablesInvoice.
At one point in time, those three methods did work on the version of
PHP I am currently running, which is 5.2.1. I have not tried PHP 5.1
yet.
The web service is a commercial package it is M/S Dynamics GP (Great Plains).

Here is the request that is getting sent over for CreatePayablesInvoice.

What should be returned is a CreatePayablesInvoiceResponse. Which is
pretty much nothing.

I pretty much and at a loss at this point. Any help is greatly appreciated.

I think we had an issue with the maling list yesterday, when you get a 
chance can you try and send something to the list.

Go with the no-brainers, devote no more then 10 seconds to think about
hosting, it's not 1999.

pair.com, dreamhost, for 99% of your needs they probably can do it
all.  Yes, in 1999 we paid $25,000 per MONTH for hosting, today a rock
bottom account on dreamhost is probably 100X better.

Once you make your fist 100G, and you actually have health and dental
insurance for everyone - THEN think about managing your own servers,
but not before.  Don't waste any time on hosting issues, work on your
SITE (IMHO)

:-)

PS,  in 2008 I am no longer a "Consultant", I'm now an "Adviser"   :-)

More likely in this case, something is causing the image data that gets 
sent to the browser to be corrupted.  Note that he's storing the image 
in the database, and this very same script (with $_GET['gim'] set) is 
outputting those data.

It's a perennial debate, but I'll go there:  Storing image data in the 
database is a bad idea.  You already have a very robust database for 
managing files: the filesystem.  So before you bother debugging this 
code more, you might want to consider changing your implementation.  
Simply write a uniquely named file somewhere on disk, and store the 
filename in the database.  Then you can construct the relevant src 
attributes on image tags, etc, or if you must, run the image data 
through PHP using fpassthru() or similar.


Here are some things I'd look at, if I was debugging your code:

    1) When calling the script with "gim" in the URL (telling it to send 
the image), does any extra data get sent?  Are there spaces before your 
opening <?PHP tag, maybe?  Maybe something else in the code is causing 
warnings or notices to be issued?  If any of that garbage makes it into 
the output stream, you'll be ouputting a corrupt image.
    2) When storing the image in the database, are you doing anything 
that might corrupt it?  Maybe try using mysql_real_escape_string() 
instead of addslashes()

But as I said above, I've not even tried to do anything like this in 
years, since I figured out that it just makes your database sad to deal 
with lots of binary data.  Really -- consider using the filesystem to 
store the files, and the database to store the names of those files, and 
you avoid all of this headache.

Sorry for replying to a relatively old thread.  I've been on  
vacation.  But I see know one exactly answered this - the  
is_executable only works if you know the exact absolute path that the  
program would be installed at.  The following should work on a unix  
based machine.  There's got to be something similar for Windows, but I  
don't want to reboot my Mac to try to figure it out :)

<?php
function getCommandPath($command = '')
{
	// note: security vulnerability...
	// should validate that $command doesn't
	// contain anything bad
	$path = `which $command`;
	if ($path != null) {
		$path = trim($path); // get rid of trailing line break
		return $path;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
}
var_dump(getCommandPath('ffmpeg'));
var_dump(getCommandPath('php'));

On my machine (which doesn't have ffmpeg), I get this output:
bool(false)
string(18) "/usr/local/bin/php"

Need Freelance Help:

I am trying to use Larry Ullman's chapter 14 ecommerce example for an
ecommerce project I am currently working on and need some freelance help;

- First of I need help in integrating the cart with PayPal's Payflow pro
(someone with past experience with Payflow pro is preferred)
- Secondly I need some one to help me get the products to display in a
thumbnail format i.e. product image, prod price, prod name

This is a low budget project, so I would prefer someone who can provide a
flat bid (or I will be willing to pay 35hr max depending on how many hours
you think it would take) and execute upon that.  This project needs to be
live by Friday.

If you are interested please email me with your contact information and
samples of similar work you've done.

First off I want to apologize for the blatant solicitation.  I have been
actively following this list for about 4 years and have found the discussion
on all things web development related an outstanding resource.  The group
has great participation and members that often provide excellent advice to
the PHP development community.  I hope that I am not out of line seeking
some business advice.  I work for a growing web development company in
Minneapolis, MN (4+ years 45+ employees) and we are looking to expand our
customer base to the east coast.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a
company rooted in the Midwest to get in on the action out east?  Does anyone
need a partner to supplement their workload?  We are an agile development
shop with ~30 programmers that bills ~1000 hours/week.
