well, I'm not sure what Dan was thinking, but my first reaction to
&quot;parse every file as php&quot; was to think of an image containing the string
'&lt;?', text files containing sample code, etc, and then the obvious
implications of accepting any content files from third parties anywhere.
The only way I know of to convince apache to do that is ForceType, which
could be safe if it was deployed carefully, sure, but I agree it would
introduce a risk.  I also think it's a really ugly way to do it, whether
there's a security risk or not (and I'm pretty sure nobody said they
were doing it that way anyway), but that's a matter of opinion

I've been experimenting with doing this for one small site using
RewriteRules in an .htaccess file: 

RewriteRule ^account$               account.php [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^account/edit$          account.php?action=edit [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^catalog/recent$        catalog.php?filter=recent [NC,L]

And I've been pretty happy with the friendliness of it.  Yes, it is a huge
headache to debug, and yes, using .htaccess files &amp; RewriteRules will slow
apache down a bit, but we don't mind.  We didn't have any motive other
than the user-friendliness one
