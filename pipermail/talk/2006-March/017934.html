<PRE>Actually, because when I created these websites with events, I was dealing
with an individual's events, and on the large scale, any one user most
likely won't have an overwhelming amount of events.  So each time their
calendar was loaded, I grabbed all their events, and looped through them
(with some filters, like if it never recurred, and it didn't happen during
that month, I didn't need to grab that).

In addition to my key/value approach that I described earlier, it was just a
huge if / else if block, and if anyone has any suggestions on how to improve
that, I'd be very happy to hear.  Basically, right now it goes through the
events one at a time checking each day for each event.  For instance, if an
event is to happen once every month on the 29th, it would have a key of 1,
and a value of 29, and then if the event had the start time of &quot;yyyy-mm-29&quot;,
it would return true for that event on that day.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The way I always handled occurance was to have two fields in the
</I>&gt;<i> database, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; key (usually an integer), and a value, which I stored as a string.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I then had a function which took an event and a day in, and checked the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; events occurance key / value to see if it applied for that day, and
</I>&gt;<i> returned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either true or false.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I doubt this is the most efficient way, but it works for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say I want to render all of the events on a particular date:
</I>&gt;<i> April 1, 2006, a Saturday. There is an event on January 18, 2003 (also
</I>&gt;<i> a Saturday) which is set to recur every two weeks... which translates
</I>&gt;<i> in this case to &quot;odd Saturdays&quot;. Okay, I see how that would work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For any given day you generate a list of all the possible matches
</I>&gt;<i> (April 1, 2006 is a Saturday, an odd Saturday, first Saturday, first
</I>&gt;<i> of the month, etc), and then SELECT against those matches to find the
</I>&gt;<i> events that apply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And multi-day events would just work, as long as you enforce a maximum
</I>&gt;<i> duration, right? If events can last up to 5 days, you have to start
</I>&gt;<i> your lookups 5 days before the month in question in order to capture
</I>&gt;<i> recurring events that started before, but end during the month.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be truly useful you need to have an override mechanism -- one time
</I>&gt;<i> events that mask out properties on a recurring event. We have a
</I>&gt;<i> monthly meeting the recurs on 4th Tuesdays, but each instance of that
</I>&gt;<i> event has a different &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot;. That seems like the easy part.
</I>&gt;<i> A truly excellent implementation would even allow you to push or pull
</I>&gt;<i> the start date, so that Cliff could reschedule the publication of his
</I>&gt;<i> newsletter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might also want an event log to track events that have actually
</I>&gt;<i> happened, so that when a recurring event is updated to reflect a new
</I>&gt;<i> reality, it doesn't rewrite history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> John, your taxonomy idea is interesting (fetch events tagged
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Wednesdays&quot;) and essentially the same as the &quot;key/value&quot; approach
</I>&gt;<i> Brian described. If you're using a system that has robust tagging
</I>&gt;<i> (like Ning) it might save some time.
