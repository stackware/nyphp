One suggestion I have is to develop your applications to work on both 4
&amp; 5 now.  That will make your life easier when the masses (such as your
web host, colleagues, and developers of 3rd party software/libs you use)
migrate to PHP 5, while allowing you to run them now on servers that
currently run PHP 4.  You don't need to learn all the new features -
learn them as you need/want them.  Focus on getting your apps working on
both gets you started.  Adam Trachtenberg's Upgrading to PHP 5 is a
great book on this subject.

I don't know that if has been discussed publicly, but PHP 4 may be
sunsetted sometime in the next couple of years.  This may force the mass
migration at some point.  PHP 4 is only receving bug and security fixes
as it is now.  No new major releases are planned.  It may only a matter
of time.  However, at the same time, the PHP community is huge, and the
PHP 4 install base is also huge.  It has had a longer life than PHP 3
did... whose last release was in Oct 2000, just 5 months after PHP 4 was
first released in May 2000.

HTH,
Andrew
