<PRE>Hello everyone.  

I apologize beforehand for using this list for this purpose, I wouldn't normally do it, but please know I need your help.

I'm looking for an organization, company or freelance team, that is interested in hiring a hard working employee.  I possess professional qualities and work ethic that demonstrate commitment to my work and employer.  My diligence and dedication to Web projects provide top quality results.  I am a team worker, have good organizational skills, artistically inclined, and willing to work many hours including weekends.

I am using this list because my English in not yet quiet fluent, and puts me at a disadvantage when looking for work.  In some instances I am competing with people that have less experience than me, but have the upper hand because they dominate perfectly the language.  

In a recent internship at the World Federalist Movement, I worked doing the website programming and design.  For the work-in-progress please see www.iccnow.org.  This organization would also serve as a job reference as they are available to answer any questions regarding my work.

Thank you for taking the time to read my petition.  To contact me please send a message directly to my email, I wouldn't like to burden this list with responses to this message.

With much appreciation.

Denis Ramirez
