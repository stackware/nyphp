&gt;<i> &gt; I'm developing a small utility web page to run on my own server which is

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I tried using from PHP the exec function and also system, but after

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have searched for an answer and have not been able to find a workable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution to this. I looked and Safe Mode is off for PHP, as it is shipped
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with CentOS. I've see forum postings about having Apache run as root, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that's not secure. I was wondering if it was possible to put some

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...'); would work without promoting for a password?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd greatly appreciate a solution from someone who has already been

</I>&gt;<i> Not necessarily a straightforward resolution to this, but some things
</I>&gt;<i> to keep in mind:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - ensure that the CLI and Apache versions of PHP are using the same
</I>&gt;<i> php.ini and that they're logging to the same (or atleast some place
</I>&gt;<i> that you know)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - confirm that the logs don't confirm errors
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - use output buffering and system() to execute a command and debug
</I>&gt;<i> what it returns
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - permissions are probably a concern which should be reflected in the
</I>&gt;<i> above output
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully that helps a bit :)
</I>&gt;<i>

Thanks for the suggestions. The plot thickens. :-)

I decided to have system() execute a shell script to do the rsync to see
what happens. In the shell script I have 2&gt;rsync_results to capture what is
going on. system() was returning 255:

Could not create directory '/var/www/.ssh'.
Host key verification failed.
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [receiver]
rsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.c(600) [receiver=3.0.6]

I also added this to the last line of the sudoers file:
apache ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Yes, I know that's not secure and it should just be for the rsync command
only, but I tried that first to see if it made any difference at all, but
it doesn't.

The rsync error output of &quot;Could not create directory '/var/www/.ssh'.&quot; to
me at least reveals that the Apache server doesn't have root access and is
operating as user apache, not root. Is my sudoers file wrong? Keep in mind,
if I run this shell script from the command line as root, it works. If I
run the php script from the command line as root it also works.

There is no .ssh in /var/www/.ssh nor should there be. The .ssh for root is
located in /root.

It appears this has to do with permissions, but I'm not sure how to do this
properly. Thanks!
