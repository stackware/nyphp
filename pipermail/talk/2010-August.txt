Subject: [nycphp-talk] OT: Sales Management Tool (Open Source) for Linux
	server (or Mac application)?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=1jBfF5V1Pt2i0Zbqqd=gH1a_48LJFcZxeeYx0@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for a Sales Management Tool that's Open Source similar in
functionality to ACT! that runs on a Linux server or on The Macintosh. The
following features are most important:
- Integration with gmail, Mac's Mail.app or handle client pop e-mail.
- Reminders of activities.
- Pipeline/Opportunity Stages/Sales Funnel Management.
- For a single user (in other words, not a full Enterprise solution is
necessary)
- Doesn't have to be written in PHP, but should be Linux (unless it's a Mac
application)
I'd appreciation recommends of software packages that you highly recommend
that you've had experience with.

Thanks in advance!

Specific to the Mac, I've used iBiz (sales, project management and
billing) and was perfectly happy with it for freelance stuff. Might be
problematic if you have several people needing access though.

Not sure if this is enough for specifically tracking sales efforts,
but it might work for you.

Hi all, i'm working for a company which is considering creating a website
using SalesForce

I've been asked about how many time it would take for a developer to get
into it

Have you ever used it? How much did it take to you to get familiar?

thanks in advance

Message-ID: <AANLkTik4sSEC6d+EBB0FCT1vvGbi3JMVd+G8tOYVG5Zm@mail.gmail.com>

I'm starting to work on a system that will require a bit of extra security.
One of the security protocols the customer's decided on is that the
outputted page should be fairly hard to copy. Yes, I know making an HTML
page uncopyable is impossible but I want to make it as hard as possible.

So far, I've come up with the following possible solutions:

- Put all the output on an image and disable right click
- Output a PDF

Both of these solutions really feel nasty to me and don't really solve the
problem at all.  Does anyone have any other ideas?

Thanks!
Anthony

Well, you're pretty limited to javascript (unless you output to flash
or pdf), which obviously means anyone who disables it won't be
affected. However, as you already stated you're aware of that, one
thing that might be cool is to detect the ctrl+c keys being pushed,
and reversed the selected text. That requires access to the clipboard
(not always available), and disabling right click.

I don't really think about this problem too much, but might be an
interesting idea.

An image would be better, copying text out of a PDF is a piece of cake. And 
even with all the protections in place one can always make a screen shot and 
use OCR. All you can do is making the process a bit more annoying. If the 
customer doesn't want anyone to copy the content, don't have them put it on 
the web. And in that sense, why bother with any tricked out web site. Either 
put it out there and be prepared to have it copied or don't do it. It is 
possibly one of these cases where management tries to solve  a management 
problem with some technology. That usually fails.

Other options would be audio. The text gets recorded and you play the audio 
file. Any optical means fall flat here. So the only way is to use voice 
recognition or stenography. Could even do video, maybe that gives an option to 
present the content nicely.

In the end there is always a way and the real question is, how much damage 
could occur if indeed someone copies and distributes the content. If that 
would be potentially bad the next step up is paper copies and an NDA. At least 
the customer has something to base a lawsuit on.

One site that I worked on had an image for each character on some
pages -- in the images directory, each file X.gif was an image
representation of character X, and the pages would call for a bunch of
those images to spell out words.  I think it was more so they could
get a particular font than for any duplication concerns, but that
could be a pain to copy.  It did impact performance and search engine
optimization, so I ended up converting it to text by replacing each
<img> tag with its respective character.  It wasn't that hard for me,
but would require a user who wants to duplicate it to know how to view
source, and then to have some knowledge of find/replace or regular
expressions.

You could make it even harder by naming the file something different
than the character represents, without an obvious formula.  Make a key
of characters -> filenames that only you have, and have a script
(possibly PHP) convert your text into a series of images following
that key.  A user would have to read through the source code, match up
each filename to the character on the page, and run a bunch of
find/replace commands to get the original text.

If all that's still too easy to copy, insert some extraneous
character-images in between the real ones, and have a Javascript
dynamically remove them from the page.  Now someone using view >
source would have a real tough time matching it all up and removing
the extraneous characters, unless they are using a DOM inspector tool
like Firebug that shows DOM changes as they are executed.

At this point it would be faster for them to just retype the whole
page, which they can do no matter what.

Basically, it all depends how much you care about accessibility to a
variety of users, speed/performance, and search engine optimization.
Images and Flash will make it inaccessible to some users and make it a
bit slower.  That may be a price you and the customer are willing to
pay.  It will also make it hard/impossible for search engines to
crawl.

Good luck,

Blake Elias

Thank you everyone for your feedback on this problem. In the end, I think
the most secure way of solving this problem is to output the text to
Flash.   While I know it's fairly easy to download a Flash applet (which
would, in essence, copy the text, I believe most of the people using this
system won't know that and will be 'safe enough'.   Additionally, if I
remember correctly, Flash content doesn't show up in a screenshot (though I
could be wrong on this).

So thank you for the input. It's much appreciated.

Impossible.

I can always get a screen shot, shoot it  off to Amazon Turk and have it 100% transcribed and sent to my email probably in a few minutes.  

There is no way of 100% preventing a screenshot. The core DNA of the Internet is built on sharing.  No way of getting around that.   

You can make it a bit harder but impossible to prevent copying.  Just the nature of the beast.

You're right, Ed. It's impossible to prevent someone who wants a
screenshot from getting one. Someone intent on copying information
will do it, even if they have to take a picture of the screen or hand
copy the material.

The goal of this project is just to make it harder for the "average"
enterprise use from copying information.

Thanks,
A

A:

You might investigate placing a transparent image over the text 
making it harder to copy.

Here's a working example of how I did that to protect an image from 
being easily copied.

Granted, it doesn't stop everyone, but it does slow them down.

Cheers,

Hmmm, and what about those people who do not want or are not allowed to 
install Flash for security reasons? Also, on older systems Flash is just 
excrutiatingly slow. I mentioned earlier using video files. I was first 
thinking about a person presenting the content, but why not take images of the 
content and compose a video of that. I am sure any system has some basic video 
capabilities, which typically can play an avi that uses a common coding (OK, 
video on older systems isn't great either, but typically works better than 
Flash). Depending on how the video is embedded in the page you can have player 
controls that allow people to stop the video and read the text.
Again, even that is no sure way of stopping anyone from obtaining and 
retaining the content, see Fahrenheit 451.

Anthony, I think for the average visitor to a web page, I would look  
into outputting the text as an image. This way it could be made to  
look like a regular web page and doesn't require the visitor to  
install or update anything on their computer such as Flash. I remember  
seeing some routines built-in to PHP that including writing text over  
a graphic. The graphic could be simply white to look like the  
background of the web page or whatever the design is.

You could write some test examples and run them at the Linux command  
level using the 'time' command to see how much overhead they really  
add vs displaying the text:

time php textasgraphic.php
time php justtext.php

Before anyone else further beats up on the concept, I can understand  
why someone would prefer not to have people copy and paste their  
content out of context and  e-mail it around such as a company news  
release, where the company would prefer people direct others to the  
web page itself.

either in your body tag or on a secured block of text(div) you can use onselectstart="return false"   which will not allow the user to highlight said block of text.  Id doesnt secure things 100% but at least its another roadblock.

You're right, Ed. It's impossible to prevent someone who wants a
screenshot from getting one. Someone intent on copying information
will do it, even if they have to take a picture of the screen or hand
copy the material.

The goal of this project is just to make it harder for the "average"
enterprise use from copying information.

Thanks,

    I haven't made "Salesforce pages" (public-facing web sites that run 
on the SF platform) but I have done some work with the API and I made it 
to Dreamforce last year.

    From a technical point of view,  you can develop public and private 
facing SF applications with a system that's very similar to modern MVC 
frameworks like CakePHP or symfony,  but you'd do coding in a language 
called APEX,  which is derived from Java,  and the database is somewhere 
between SQL and NoSQL.  There's a Web UI builder in the IDE for it,  so 
you can build simple pages with very little coding -- I saw a demo aimed 
at marketing people where they were able to knock up a form in the 
builder in about five minutes.  Particularly looking at the API I see a 
lot of similarities between the SF platform and the Facebook platform,  
but SF is really optimized for classic OLTP applications and doesn't 
have the specializations for large social networks that you see in sites 
like FB or LinkedIn.

    That said,  I find the business of Salesfore puzzling.  I like 
building web sites that are supported by advertising,  so think in terms 
of eCPM,  which is typically between $0.25-$5.00 for the sites I make.  
Pages hosted on the SF platform cost $1.00 eCPM to host,  which would 
eat an unacceptable amount of my profits...  Particularly when the costs 
of a more conventional system (MySQL/PHP,  or MSSQL/ASP.NET) is probably 
1/100 that assuming reasonable scale and utilization.  SF has an ARPU of 
around $1000 a year...  If it wasn't possible to provision a similar 
kind of service for 1/1000 the price,  it wouldn't be possible for 
Facebook to exist.  You'd think,  given the prices they charge,  SF 
would have good margins,  but according to what they file with the 
S.E.C.,  Salesforce.com's margins are much much smaller than those of 
Amazon Web Services!

    In the back end,  SF has several big clusters that center around an 
instance of Oracle 10g,  and they buy lots of gold plated hardware.  The 
reliability of SF is excellent,  and performance is really good for OLTP 
work,  but the platform is weak for analytics,  network analysis and 
anything that doesn't fit into its paradigm...  They charge something 
like $1K / month/ GB for database storage,  which is just nuts...  They 
could be storing it in RAM for what they're charging.

    Overall,  if your company is already using SF and you want to build 
applications that communicate with your SF database in an OLTP manner,  
SF pages are a reasonable way to go.  If you don't already have a 
commitment to SF,  I'd stay away.  They like to recall the days that 
they were a disruptive upstart,  but I think 10 years from now they're 
going to be seen as an over-the-hill high cost provider.

Paul,

First of all, thank you for sharing all this information

In this case it seems like a client is already using SalesForce and asking
about doing some changes. So after this i've been asked about how many time
it would take for a developer to get into the platform

My first guess was a week, then i downloaded the manual (with > 300 pages)
and i started thinking in two weeks, but if it's Java i don't think we'll be
able to take it. We are doing PHP mostly, also FB apps, ASP, AS, but not
Java

>From what you are telling me, it seems like we might need to develop in
Java, not in PHP, is this correct?


best,
Fernando

    The language is APEX,  which is very similar to Java -- there's an 
IDE for APEX that runs in Eclipse.

    You definitely can write applications in some other language that 
access Salesforce via a SOAP API.  In my experience this works very well 
with Microsoft's SOAP stack in .NET,  I can't say I've ever tried it 
with PHP.  On the other hand,  if you host the whole app in Salesforce 
there are some big advantages in terms of reliability,  performance,  
not having to sysadmin,  etc.

Message-ID: <20100813200040.GA24424@panix.com>

Hey Folks:

Hang out, drink some beer and write some unit tests for PHP.

Unit tests ensure the PHP engine behaves as expected and continues to do 
so as it is developed. Let's put our minds to work exploring the 
underlying C source code and documentation to find edge cases and 
uncovered segments that need checking and then we'll go about writing 
those tests.

Bring a laptop that has PHP CLI installed or Internet access to a machine 
that does. I will explain the rest. Also bring some interesting beer to 
share.

Saturday, August 28, 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM

We will be meeting in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. 
Accessible by the D, R and N trains and the B35 and B63 buses. RSVP via 
Meetup:  http://www.meetup.com/BKTK-meetup/calendar/14197299/

If you REALLY don't want to sign up for a Meetup account, contact me 
directly.

See you,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] file_get_contents() with a context
Message-ID: <11416065.377.1281730411472.JavaMail.root@localhost>

I am using file_get_contents() with a context that defines it should be using http 1.1 default is 1.0.... 


I am using this inside of a loop that is pulling remote product images and creating thumbnails.... 


The reason we had to add a context is because with no context specified file_get_contents() used http 1.0 and when looping through say 2000 products it creates 2000 connections to a server in under say 10 seconds.....Most servers dont like this and most hosting companies will see this as a DOS attack. 


So Now we've added the context and now each request is taking anywhere from 8-15 seconds. From what I can tell it has to do with the fact that http 1.1 uses a single connection for all of these requests...if I add connection: close to the header then I am right back where I started with http 1.0 


So I was wondering if there is a way to tel file_get_contents that it can use more than one connection but its only allow to use say 10. 




Any help on this is greatly appreciated.

I'd be looking into cURL and specifically curl_multi, or forking a bunch
of sub-processes so that each one can maintain its own connection and
process a portion of the requests.

I guess my biggest problem is with http 1.0 and multiple simultaneous connection i can process 2,000 images in about 13 seconds.

with http 1.1 it is taking anywhere from 8-15 seconds per image.  for lets say 10 seconds.

so on 2,000 images that would take approx. 5.5 hours.

Now if i cut that down and did 10 at a time with something such as curl_multi or forking scripts.  it would still take 30 minutes.


Now 30 minutes I guess isnt that bad for 2,000 images but say i have to do 1 magnitude higher than that and had to do 20,000 thats back up to 5 hours.


Maybe the question is...If a customers site is running on shared host what would be an acceptable number of simultaneous connections to do this would 10 be OK , and if so how about 20? and if so how about 30?  And would it matter based on the host?

I know the easy solution to this is to have the customer send us a DVD and process the images this way...but that assume that the customer is capable and even has the knowledge to do so.


Suggestions/comments and anything else is welcome.


I guess the BIGGEST question of all is why does it take 10 seconds to process an image when using http 1.1 but less than a second when using http 1.0, and can this be fixed?

The cause for the increase in speed is PHP was not pipelining the requests so it was waiting for the connection to timeout..which was what was causing it to appear that the file was taking longer to download.

I ended up using http://code.google.com/p/php-pipeline Which gives me the ability to pipeline on multiple connections.

Now I just need to figure out how to log the number of connections over a given number of time to make sure it's actually working

Subject: [nycphp-talk] NY Symfony MVC PHP Framework is holding a social
 gathering with Fabien Potencier and other core Symfony team members with
 free pizza and beer tonight! 7pm

Much of the symfony core team will be in town for the PHPBB Libertyvasion
event and we are going to throw a party!

The meetup will be at the Meetup.com Offices located at: 632 Broadway, suite
301, New York, NY 10012

It will start off with a quick meet and greet and then we will hand over the
podium to Fabien/Symfony core team for a Question and Answer session so come
armed with your most interesting and intriguing Symfony questions!

We will then have a post Q/A cocktail hour at a bar down the street. I am
trying to secure a location today. Does anyone have any preference in that
area? I reserved a table at:

http://www.sweetandvi...

It also has a backyard for those who smoke.

Finally if you get to the meetup.com offices early you can help us choose
what kind of food to order! I think I will be there by 6:30 so your welcome

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Being notified when something changes in the database
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=T7bnOudZDgM6s5uhTTFaXQopa6MVwOab2ZVLM@mail.gmail.com>

So I'm developing an application that will work within a larger supply chain
system. There is a table in the database called 'Items' which holds a list
of all items and how many of those items are in stock at a particular
location.  Fairly regularly, another system will change that table (for
example, when a new shipment of items come in) and I need to notified of
that change and fire a script to process those changes.

How can this be done effectively and reliably?  Is there a 'standard' way of
doing it?

Thanks!

Use triggers, plus a queue, and have a script watch that queue.

Hi Matt,

I get the use of triggers but can you explain the queue concept? Let's say I
want to be notified every time the count of an item is increased. How would
a queue play into that?

Have a trigger create a record in the event queue, and then have a process 
that runs to process the queue (could be a cron, or a daemon) and send out 
emails, etc.

Not to discount Matt's solution; it is a good one. But for the sake of 
completeness: you could also use the observer pattern here.

Anthony:

Not to discount anyone's solution, but I had a similar problem that I 
solved by simply emailing what happened. As someone updated the 
database, the script that changed the database also sent an email to 
me at the same time telling what happened.

Cheers,

tedd

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Make PHP Better.  Come to Brooklyn's PHP TestFest.
Message-ID: <20100825012705.GA13192@panix.com>

Hello Again:

A reminder... TestFest is this Saturday...

Hang out, drink some beer and write some unit tests for PHP.

Unit tests ensure the PHP engine behaves as expected and continues to do 
so as it is developed. Let's put our minds to work exploring the 
underlying C source code and documentation to find edge cases and 
uncovered segments that need checking and then we'll go about writing 
those tests.

Bring a laptop that has PHP CLI installed or Internet access to a machine 
that does. I will explain the rest. Also bring some interesting beer to 
share.

Saturday, August 28, 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM

We will be meeting in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. 
Accessible by the D, R and N trains and the B35 and B63 buses. RSVP via 
Meetup:  http://www.meetup.com/BKTK-meetup/calendar/14197299/

If you REALLY don't want to sign up for a Meetup account, contact me 
directly.

See you,

[Not PHP-specific, but we all know the greatest minds in town are here, so
---]

Here's my dilemma. For reasons a little too boring and involved to go into
here, I have split the thing called User into two tables, one called
'people' that holds firstname, lastname, email, and other personal data. The
'users' table holds username, password, last_login timestamp, etc. Both
tables have a boolean 'active' so that I can disable user accounts and mark
people as, well, inactive and only interesting for historical reasons.

I want to provide a self-service user registration, with an email
verification thing. They submit their data, we email them a link to verify
that they control the email address they provided, bla bla, then the account
is enabled. So I thought I would go ahead and do the inserts, marking both
new records as 'inactive' pending email confirmation.

In some cases, though, there may already be a row in people corresponding to
the new user. If I attempt the insert and the email already exists I will
get a duplicate email error. But if I instead run an update on the
already-existing row, I will have done the update without first verifying
the email. I am therefore thinking that the pending person/user rows maybe
ought to be stored somewhere else temporarily. I am even thinking, maybe
serialize much of the person and user details, perhaps as JSON, since it's
just being crammed away temporarily pending verification.

What would you do?

Gratefully yours....

In this case would it make sense to let the user know that there is 
already an account and just offer to re-send the verification or 
password reset email (depending on the status of the account)?

Of course that would assume that the account hasn't been disabled for 
some reason, in which case if you have a hard unique constraint on the 
email you're going to have to reactivate the account rather than being 
able to create a "new" account for the user and leave the old account as 
deactivated.

The big dedicated commerce platform out there is Magento:

    http://www.magentocommerce.com/

They are getting more and more aggressive with converting from FOSS to
paid downloads, but are currently still open source.

There's also Tienda, which is a Joomla-native suite of commerce tools:

    http://bit.ly/bUTyKV

My preference is the DIY approach, but that's mainly due to people
only coming to me with very specific needs that don't settle well with
the one-size-fits-all solutions out there. My advice is to look at the
features provided by the existing platforms, and weigh those with the
requirements of the store you're trying to produce. Somewhere in there
should be the justification for the "Build or Buy" decision that
should be your first task. :-)

Sorry, I didn't explain clearly enough. There may be cases where there is
already record for the soon-to-be user in the 'people' table, but not the
'users.' See the issue? If I try to insert where the email already exists, I
run into the unique constraint, but then if I say instead 'update ... where
email = $their_email'  before confirming the email, well, that sounds like a
poor idea, basically  allowing anyone to run an update on anyone else's
record in the table.

Not the end of the world, but I am looking for the most graceful solution.

Hi!

I would tell them that they are already registered with that email and offer 
them to send them a temporary password to said email address in case they 
forgot the one they chose before. The Insert to fail is exactly what you want, 
saves one query compared to first checking and if not in the table inserting.

This may very well be a dumb question, but what's wrong with doing the
insert and just detecting if it fails?  If you get a duplicate key, you know
they're in the database and can act accordingly.  Otherwise, it inserts.

This may be somewhat of a controversial stance, but I'm all in favor of
letting my database do my checks for me.

Disqus does something like this. If you run into where there is an
email in the system but no "profile" (entry in the "people" table)
just bring up a screen and have the user fill out the rest of the
information. Then, stick it in the database and you're on your merry
way!

One way to handle the duplicate key problem is to append a flag to the
key when you mark the record inactive. So chsnyder at gmail.com becomes
chsnyder at gmail.com_20100831. That way your tables are ready for the
next chsnyder at gmail.com to come along.

If you want to mark a user inactive AND prevent them from
reregistering, don't add change the key.

All interesting, thank you. I think I still might not be explaining the
situation clearly enough. Or I am dense and not getting it.

The form I am gonna display is bound -- so to speak -- to two tables.
Actually I'm using Zend Framework and MySQL and Zend_Form_SubForm. I don't
know until I see their email whether this is someone whose information has
already been put in the people table. Usually it will not be, they will be
entirely new to the application.

In the typical case, filter and validate and attempt insert, marking the
records 'inactive' until we confirm the email by sending them a link with a
token as URL parameter, they click it, bla bla, all good.

If however I catch a duplicate email exception when I attempt the insert
into 'people,' then I know this is most likely a person we've dealt with but
who has never created an actual user account -- a row in users as opposed to
people. IOW there is a record in 'people' that has this email address, but
there is no corresponding row in users. Now, I might go ahead and run an
update of the old row -- indeed MySQL provides ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
syntax for just this situation. But I don't want to do that until I have
confirmed their email. So... I think I just need to hold onto their input
pending email verification.

Thanks again.

Can you insert the new user, associate it with the existing person, and
still make them activate the email address?

Uh, "big" doesn't seem to be the right word.  Perhaps "ginormous" fits 
the bill a little better.  A note of mine indicates it weighs in at 
106MB, though I think that was a subversion checkout.

Are you using the email as the only "GET" parameter to do the
confirmation?  That is a mistake.

Do something like:

confirm.php?email=joe at example.com&checksum=abcdefg123

where checksum is md5($email . 'a secret');

Now when you run the update do:

if($_GET['email'] && md5($_GET['email'] . 'a secret') == $_GET['checksum']) );
  // sql update

- - - - -

There are lots of variations on this pattern.  You can just save the
checksum in the table, and avoid the email altogether if you want a
shorter url.
