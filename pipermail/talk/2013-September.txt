Subject: [nycphp-talk] Beagle Bone Black PHP
Message-ID: <5223675A.1060802@gmail.com>

I am in the process of writing a library for the BeagleBoneBlack and was 
wondering if anyone here is hacking around with it as well and can test 
it out/give me feedback.

http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black

My library requires upgrading to a relatively recent kernel.  I'm using 
Robert Nelson's latest Ubuntu kernel, 3.8.13-bone26, 
http://rcn-ee.net/deb/raring-armhf/v3.8.13-bone26/, though any of his 
3.8 versions should provide the necessary functionality.

The main thing for those using it is I am limiting it to a recent kernel 
so I don't have to chase down 2 different ways of handling the pin 
interface.  Everything will depend on the linux device-tree, and all the 
pins are accessed from PHP by reading and writing to the /sys/class file 
structures created for the pins.

Keep in mind this is very much alpha level coding, as I am working 
through each interface one at a time, and will be restructuring it 
later[for example, right now on my local I have standalone classes 
usr-led and gpio-led with methods for configuring/controlling LED's.  
Eventually those should be refactored to move common methods into an led 
super class with subclasses to override them].

Also at the moment I'm using the much maligned singleton class as it 
makes the most sense to me.  IE I can't imagine a situation where a PHP 
script would have more than one system board since that represents the 
entire computer.  I can imagine a possible remote-control option, but I 
think to support that it would make more sense to re-factor the 
singleton Board class into a parent Board class and a couple of 
children, the BBBSystemBoard singleton and a BBBWebsocketRemoteBoard class.

Anyone interested have any thoughts on what sorts of functions they 
would like?

Unfortunately not offhand.  I read it on the internet so it must be 
true? :-)

Honestly though, I think I read about it in Pragmatic Thinking and 
Learning: Refactor Your Wetware, by Andy Hunt
http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning

It was a very interesting book with lots of little tidbits.  The most 
fun "new to me" fact was when he was....disparaging the idea of 
cube-farms.  He referenced a wide spread belief that we only have a set 
number of brain cells, they don't grow back.  I recall learning this 
back in school as part of all the anti-drinking classes[ie "alcohol 
kills brain cells and you don't grown any new ones!"]  This bit of 
wisdom is based on a decades old study of rats where it was found that 
they stopped growing new brain cells after adulthood. What had been 
overlooked was the environmental factors: ie these were rats kept in a 
sterile environment, no stimulation, nothing new, every day the same old 
same old[making the obvious analogy to cubicles and their sameness].   
Take those rats and give them changing environments and stimulation and 
low and behold, they do grow new brain cells. 
http://www.livescience.com/505-adult-brain-cells-growing.html

Now, I'm not quite sure I'd buy into comparing working in a cubicle to 
being a rat in a lab, since you DO still have mental stimulation for the 
projects one works on.

Unfortunately my copy is at my brothers, so I can't look it up.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Mysql tweaking
Message-ID: <52237AB2.9030205@gmail.com>

As a followup on my previous post, I'm curious if anyone here has some 
quick and easy mysql configuration mods for low memory?

The "out of the box" ubuntu install of mysql server used a hefty[:-)] 
256M of memory.   As a quick fix I disabled innodb completely and that 
dropped it down to more manageable 64M - but I'd really like to get it 
down to under 24M.

For the use case[running on a System on a Chip board] myisam is a better 
choice anyway - large numbers of concurrent connections are unlikely, 
and the need for row-level locking is practically non-existent.

For those that aren't familiar with the environment, the entire system 
has 512M of memory so using half of it for a sporadically utilized MySQL 
server is detrimental.   There is no traditional hard disk available, 
disk storage is provided by an SD card, which does not have very fast 
write times AND deleting and writing data is destructive to the long 
term lifespan of the card - just like with SSD drives.   Swapfiles do a 
lot of write/delete/write/delete to pull memory in and out of swap, so 
their use is discouraged.

The problem is that very, very few people code in a vacuum anymore.  So
yes, your rockstar programmer can turn out code very quickly if they don't
have to follow any guidelines... and then it will be turned over to junior
programmers to maintain and they will have no idea WTF is going on.

At the very least it will slow them down trying to figure out what's going
on.  Probably they'll end up taking up more of the senior developers time
to get him to explain it.  At worst it will create bugs b/c they thought
they knew what was going on but didn't.

The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. :-)

Message-ID: <CAAF+Sg7PEsWr4S+GCGgiwLCa8wXapkuvUWe1icN3_io-9Xpmcw@mail.gmail.com>

I have been setting up replication where the master is
5.5.31-0+wheezy1-log, and after more hours of hair-pulling than I care to
think about, I think I've discovered what appears to be an undocumented
oddity. On startup, mysqld reads in any file in /etc/mysql whose name ends
in .cnf.  So, I had a fomer.my.cnf as a backup as well as a my.cnf in
/etc/mysql/ and was wondering why my server-id kept being 2 when my
configuration setting in my.cnf was plainly 1. I moved away the other file
and restarted. Ding!

After some googling I have not found anything about this, at least not yet.
Tell me whether I'm crazy.

Is there any includedir directive used?

Yes, it says

    !includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/

and /etc/mysql/conf.d/ contains only mysqld_safe_syslog.cnf. whose entire
contents are

    [mysqld_safe]
    syslog

Curious, as somebody that's worked in MySQL in a while I have not
experienced this.
I wonder if it's a debian trait  (because FWIW !includedir is not standard
MySQL).

you can check what files are read, with the following command.

I have included the lines from a MySQL 5.6 CentOS 6.x rpm install binary.

$ mysqld --verbose --help

...
Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
/etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /usr/etc/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf
The following groups are read: mysqld server mysqld-5.6
...

D'oh! I think it may be that I was doing 'sudo service mysql reload'  after
editing my.cnf and *that* might be was doesn't really reload. I would have
to go study my .bash_history and I'm away from that machine now
(blessedly!), but I think it might be another PEBCAK type of problem,
albeit a tricky one.

Debian does seem to have a personality. I am giving it a go for the first
time on the two LAMP servers I administer at my job.

Why use MySQL at all?  SQLite is a WAY better way to go.

What packages are people having good experiences with to do web browser
automated regression testing? I'm interested in this for being able to test
a website mostly to make sure all it's functions are working for the user
experience. Thanks!

Hi!

That is a loaded question for the following reason: in order to secure optimal 
user experience you need to run manual or semi-automatic tests. I cannot think 
of a single automated testing tool that can check for properly alignment of 
controls, etc. Humans are much more efficient and faster for such tests, even 
for regression.

Test automation is useful to test the backend for features that are unlikely 
to change. Do not use automation for anything that is still under development 
because you will spend more time fixing your test scripts than what you gain 
in test automation. A while back I gave Selenium a try and found it to be OK, 
but since I work in a Microsoft shop we use Microsoft Test Manager (which 
works fine with IE and sucks for any other browser). Microsoft Test Manager 
also needs a Team Foundation Server and if you do not have that set up or are 
not willing to spend a lot of cash it is out of the competition here.

For a while I also used iMacros for Firefox to automate a few processes, but 
mainly because I was lazy 
(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imacros-for-firefox/). The 
biggest problem with iMacros is that it tremendously slows down the response 
of the system. As long as you do not take iMacro's script run times as 
performance indicator you can quite easily click together scripts and run them 
as needed.

One other popular tool is Fitnesse (http://fitnesse.org/). I have read plenty 
about it, but have yet to find the time to dive into it...maybe I get to it 
ten years from now.

How large is your application? If it is under about two dozen features I 
wonder if automation will really benefit you. Keep in mind test automation 
means writing more code to test code, and yes, test scripts can have bugs as 
well! Also, test scripts will work fine as long as the test engine can find 
the control on the page. That means the automated test will not fail when the 
controls are splattered across the page or all on top of each other. Just 
because an automated test passes does not mean everything is peachy, all it 
tells you is that whatever worked before appears to be working fine right now 
(which is important). You still need to do some manual testing which will also 
reveal a bunch of issues the script wasn't programmed to look at.

Hope I could give some pointers.

Put your mother or father in front of it. Let them use it for an hour. Have them tell you what they think.

Automated testing for load balancing and prediction is one thing.... But real world when people are clicking back button, forward button, jumping from page to page. Only mom can test that...

Because it's fun to take existing PHP applications, dump them onto my 
BeagleBone, make a few tweaks to interface them to some pins and have it 
all "just work". :-)

Beyond that, definitely SQLite is a much better database solution for an 
embedded processor.

Hi Guys,

I wouldn't automatically disregarded MySQL as being not possible to utilize on a single board controller; what about a tunnel or parodying solution; such as `mysql-proxy`?

It's memory usage would I assume be lower?

There is no traditional hard disk available, disk storage is provided by an SD card, which does not have very fast write times AND deleting and writing data is destructive to the long term lifespan of the card - just like with SSD drives.   Swapfiles do a lot of write/delete/write/delete to pull memory in and out of swap, so their use is discouraged.

Been using WebDriver (i.e. Selenium 2).

Here's a tutorial. http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/get-test-infected-with-selenium-2/

Actually got the WebDriver javascript working with node.js and Mocha.

For PHP connecting to WebDriver, check out Mink - http://mink.behat.org/

Hello David



Autmated testing is upto 70% useful because of it's limitations in context of testing modern web application. Hence support of manual testing and unit testing is must. Since you mentioned to use automated testing for regression mainly, I would say automated testing becomes useful exactly here.

In nutshell, automated testing should be part of overall QA plan. Carefully designed automated tests saves lot of manual testing time during regression.

You could look into using HP's ePrint. We have an HP printer that uses
ePrint and you can email output to it and it's queued and printed:

https://h30495.www3.hp.com/c/46339/US/en/

So once the order has been completed from your software you could have it
e-mailed using ePrint to the printer. This is assuming a few things, one
that you either have an HP printer that supports ePrint or convince your
client to get one. I also don't know if it supports anything fancy like
PostScript with ePrint.

It's way simpler than that. Just create a printable version of your page
with the body as follow:
<body onload="window.print(); window.close();">

Doesn't that assume the Point of Sale computer is connected directly to the
printer via USB? I was picturing a shop where the printer is in the kitchen
area away from the POS computer and the printer is connected to the network
either by Wifi or Ethernet.

Correction: The OP said it was coming in from the web, so there might not
even be a POS computer used at all.

I could go for a pizza right now! :-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MODXpo: Cologne, Germany - November 2013
Message-ID: <CAMBZG=zWNAq-Y51oLtFmFHD5uG5NkE8LgX=EWt7k=LZ_T1JNJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening everyone,

As some of you know, I am a MODX Ambassador thus it is my responsibility to
evangelize occasionally and spread the word.   MODX is holding  conference
in Germany this year and some of you might want to attend.

Join as many as 300 MODXers from around the world and members of the MODX
team in Cologne, Germany on November 1 and 2, for two full days of
MODX at MODXpo
2013 <http://2013.modxpo.eu/>.

About MODXpo
MODXpo is the official, international MODX user conference. MODX
developers, designers and site builders gather to learn, share, explore and
network. Our first MODXpo was held in Dallas, in 2010 and last
year<http://modxpo.eu/2012/home> was
held in the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands. If you've not been to a
MODXpo, this is the event for you.

MODXpo 2013 Highlights
There are top-notch keynotes, presentations, workshops, and much more, from
well known MODX community members including Susan Ottwell, Mark Hamstra and
Gauke Pieter Sietzema. Ryan Thrash, MODX Co-founder, will present his State
of MODX and showcase the past, present and future of MODX. Other great
sessions include: responsive development tools, continuous deployment,
scaling and high availability, how not to build MODX sites, case studies,
contributing to MODX and much more. In addition, there will be plenty of
time for making connections and code.

More Info
For complete details including the schedule <http://2013.modxpo.eu/schedule>
, location <http://2013.modxpo.eu/location> and more, please go to http://
2013.modxpo.eu.

Sponsors Welcome
A high-caliber conference like MODXpo would not be possible without
generous sponsors <http://2013.modxpo.eu/sponsors>. In exchange for their
generosity, MODXpo sponsors get to a promote their business to both the
conference attendees and the MODX universe, at large. For MODX-based
companies that can't make it to MODXpo 2013, becoming a
sponsor<http://2013.modxpo.eu/sponsors/sponsor-modxpo> is
a great way for you to show support for the free software that powers your
business.

Warmest regards,

Hans C. Kaspersetz, President
*Arteric*

selyah,

I was in the middle of writing a reply and got distracted:   ??.In my experience??.

Scenerio 1:  You have a NORMAL INKJET/LASER PRINTER?  Use CUPS/cupsd.  It is easy to configure and setup a simple method to send a document to a http or print spool over a network.  Just tunnel your document data that needs to be send to the printer via some type of tunnel @ port 631, and edit your cupsd.conf to let the authorized user that you create (probably not admin or root) to send that to the printer  spool.

Result: your receipt prints out.

also there should be docs at http://localhost:631/help, b) in /usr/share/doc/cups or within c) /etc/cups or on the project website.

Scenerio 2:  Your program/software is using a THERMAL PRINTER?  Access the device spec manual and figure out how to send the reciept data to the device and do so?.

	(may include sdk, etc? or commonly (i'd venture to guess 90% of the time; over serial connection).

Ah, Cologne...I grew up in that region. I wish I could go...*sigh*
Just be advised that November 1st is a holiday (All Hallow's Day) and shops 
are closed and public transit is on Sunday schedule.
Have a good conference and drink not too much K?lsch! Uh, and if you are 
hungry for chicken don't order a "half chicken" (Halve Hahn), because that is 
a cheese sandwich in Cologne.

You could look into using HP's ePrint. We have an HP printer that uses ePrint and you can email output to it and it's queued and printed:

https://h30495.www3.hp.com/c/46339/US/en/

So once the order has been completed from your software you could have it e-mailed using ePrint to the printer. This is assuming a few things, one that you either have an HP printer that supports ePrint or convince your client to get one. I also don't know if it supports anything fancy like PostScript with ePrint.

Doesn't that assume the Point of Sale computer is connected directly to the printer via USB? I was picturing a shop where the printer is in the kitchen area away from the POS computer and the printer is connected to the network either by Wifi or Ethernet.

hey you don't need to over engineer your problem, it's a website for a pizzeria, seriously all you need is window.print() and a page that refresh itself.

If you wanted to go down the route of sending a fax, you could try a web
service that does it:

http://www.interfax.net/en/dev
https://www.phaxio.com

The advantage is that it could be done from a web server without needing to
integrate with anything on-site.

I built an ordering app though and the owners log into a page that shows
the current orders. They hit a button that users window.print to print out
all of the pending orders and updates them in the database as having been
printed. So next time when they print or reload the page, it doesn't print
the same orders again. You can even use css page-break-after to separate
orders into different pages.

If you want to fax; don't use a 3rd party service.

Use PBX in a Flash or Asterisk;?.

I think that it would us the default printer that the machine is interfacing with.  If it is setup to use a wifi printer you could get away with the js window print suggestion.  Just create a css file for the print version and use a media query to make that css be used when printing.

Anyone have any corrections to my above statement that I am not aware of?

I am curious why people are suggestion to use a web service that adds to the monthly bill for the company rather than a simple print using javascript, so long as the machines are on the same network a wifi printer would work.  If they are not on the same network then you would have to do some sort of email to the printer like the HP one suggested.

I think I was the only one that suggested it. And I suggested it for this
flow:

1. Person places order online.
2. Server receives order, sends fax to pizza shop.
3. Pizza shop receives order as fax. No on-site computers are needed and no
need for them to check and print orders.

Interfax says "Free unlimited faxing to one designated fax number." It says
it has restrictions, but it might be possible to use them basically for
free depending on what those restrictions are.

But, if they can just log into an onsite computer and check orders and
print them, then yeah, that's way simpler and the same thing I did for a
client. It might be possible to create some type of application that
automates printing new orders, but that is probably going to take a decent
amount of development.

I think your suggestion is a good one, with just one thing though, using JS
will pop up the print screen but some one needs to hit ok in order for it to
start printing, on the other hand the eprint option with an HP printer would
print the order with out having to hit anything, but the order would have to
be converted to a PDF and emailed to the eprint email address, but in my
opinion there are both good option.

Ah I see I missed the part about no on-site computers.
I would still suggest the hp email printer, low cost and no development required other than sending the order to the hp email address.

Message-ID: <CABsCM1OfKrf2Ew-t_xBJdZcCavEfGLFtBZ1_tUbvHC_=3gsU2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

So someone wrote an app and library called OrcaMDF for reading Sql server
files offline.

https://github.com/improvedk/OrcaMDF

Most of its use cases are forensic and recovery at the moment. However, its
got real potential as an ETL tool if you get shipped MDF files from a
partner and just want to import them into your RDBMS of choice.

It happens to "just work" on the latest version of mono. I'd love to see
some people in the linux community get involved in this.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Help With My Contact Centre Website
Message-ID: <5243AAE4.20001@gmail.com>

hi. a blind website development student. my lecturer not able to answer. 
so looking for help. the site is a contact call centre application. you 
add, edit, delete and update contact, and events, then you create an 
account and also login. so the site is at: 
http://marvinhunkin.bmtafeweb.com. I use a screen reader Jaws For 
windows from http://www.freedomscientific.com. have uploaded all the 
files to filezilla. now. I am getting the following problems. if any 
people who knows php, my sql, html, css, and is in Australia, might be 
able to help. I will outline the problems below.  1. the add contact 
form, does not redirect, and not sure. 2. the edit contact, edit event, 
update contact, and update event has errors. maybe not liking the php 
self form tag. also with the create account and login, get errors. and 
apart from the add contact page, it does redirect the other pages. and 
also, do I need extra security, for the create account, login, and 
feedback form. and when I get these issues fixed, better to have a list 
of users, then they can then click, and then goes to a page, and then 
have buttons, like edit, delete, update. with the delete contact and 
delete event, no errors, but have php code, appear on the form. a much 
more friendly way of doing this. also do I need a change password form,

suggest ways and how I can fix the errors, with sample code, and other 
examples. have googled, looked at previous projects. so want to get this 
project done in the next couple of weeks. got a deadline. also, any 
sighted people, have a look at the layout, html, css, and if it looks 
professional, as totally blind. and also, if I need to change images, if 
they are appropriate for this site. so, if any one is in Australia, as I 
live in South Australia, Australia. would be more preferable if 
possible, as same time zone, but if not, then any help would be 
appreciated. a local friend was helping out, but he cannot help, has a 
full time job, family, and I understand that. have asked on the student 
forum, but no one, helping me out. so if any one could help, I would 
appreciate it. thanks. Marvin..

Marvin:

I can't see the code, but I can tell a couple of things from the errors:

1. The error "headers already sent " is created when you have already sent stuff to the browser and try to do it again. Functions that send/modify HTTP headers must be invoked before any output is made. Otherwise the call fails.

2. The session_start() statement *must* be the first condition addressed in your scripts. I commonly use:

<?php	if (session_id() === '')
				{
				session_start();
				}

Try implementing number 2 and try it again.

Also, I find it typical that blind users have no concept of paragraphs (i.e., linefeeds between topics/ideas). If you can do that, then your post will be more readable for sighted users and probably more fruitful.

Cheers,

tedd

I am getting the following problems. if any people who knows php, my sql, html, css, and is in Australia, might be able to help. I will outline the problems below.  1. the add contact form, does not redirect, and not sure. 2. the edit contact, edit event, update contact, and update event has errors. maybe not liking the php self form tag. also with the create account and login, get errors. and apart from the add contact page, it does redirect the other pages. and also, do I need extra security, for the create account, login, and feedback form. and when I get these issues fixed, better to have a list of users, then they can then click, and then goes to a page, and then have buttons, like edit, delete, update. with the delete contact and delete event, no errors, but have php code, appear on the form. a much more friendly way of doing this. also do I need a change password form, and so any possible code. trying my best, not to do it for me, but to suggest ways and how I can fix the errors, with sample code, and other examples. have googled, looked at previous projects. so want to get this project done in the next couple of weeks. got a deadline. also, any sighted people, have a look at the layout, html, css, and if it looks professional, as totally blind. and also, if I need to change images, if they are appropriate for this site. so, if any one is in Australia, as I live in South Australia, Australia. would be more preferable if possible, as same time zone, but if not, then any help would be appreciated. a local friend was helping out, but he cannot help, has a full time job, family, and I understand that. have asked on the student forum, but no one, helping me out. so if any one could help, I would appreciate it. thanks.

Could also be caused by errors generating output - so check your web

I've also run into the "headers already sent" sort of issue being caused by
line breaks or white space after a closing php marker "?>".  This is
considered output to the screen and then any following php header()
commands will fail.

Hi,

 

Modern frameworks do not close php tag <? In php file, so if you have normal
code:

 

<?php

 

                echo "test";

 

?>

 

in modern frameworks it will be

 

<?php

 

                echo "test";

 

 

Best Regards,

Sasa

Hi Robert,

 

If you have file:

 

<?php

 

                echo "test";

 

?>[space] [space]

 

When loading this php file and extra spaces will be sent to browser, this
will

Break session start or cookies sent from php script after spaces.

 

If you write:

 

<?php

 

                echo "test";

 

[space] [space]

 

PHP engine will not write spaces, as there is not ?> tag, it will be parsed
as:

 

 

<?php

 

                echo "test";

 

[space] [space]

?>

Sasa

I won't debate the statement why "modern frameworks are omitting ?>"

What I will say that is that I've been writing PHP code for over a decade and teaching PHP at college level for several years and I have never encountered any problems with *me* coding using a closing tag. Other people report differently.

The OP asked a question as to the errors he received after the submission of a php form. Considering all, I submitted my recommendation. If my recommendation is followed, then I strongly suspect the problem will be resolved without having to omit "?>".

Cheers,

tedd
