<PRE>Rada,

Sorry for coming on so strong. I generally follow these lists for the
technical discussion, and not the solicitations for work. I get
annoyed when people don't let the market take care of lowball offers
like this. You are right that people on this list in general command a
better than $10.00/hr fee, and that's about living wage in the NY
area.I know a security (as in rent a cop) company that pays people
about that much to watch construction sites, and many of them are
immigrants that are completely illiterate in both English and their
native languages. So I do appreciate how little $10.00/hr is.

That being said, I started out programming for $8.00 an hour when I
was hired to do clerical work. It was a benefit to both parties. It
made their operations more efficient. It helped me to get a help desk
position for more money, and lead me down a path to earning my current
salary doing something I love. Without the crappy jobs I would not
have ended up in my current good one. When I was at the stage of my
life where I wasn't good enough to get paid a proper wage to program,
I preffered to make a substandard wage programming to making a
substandard wage doing something I didn't like.

Regards,

Justin Dearing

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Below are current Cut-off Wages for computer specialists from the New York

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone offers you work below this rate, you can refuse the job without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> losing your unemployment insurance. Needless to say, nobody with a brain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will work for cut-off wages, these are just examples of absolute rock-bottom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rates.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Occupation Cut-off Wage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Computer Programmers $31.77
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Computer Software Engineers $35.79
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Computer Support Specialists $24.30
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The above hourly rates are for full-time work. For less than 40 hours/week,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the rates have to be proportionately higher. For example, if you are a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Computer Programmer&quot;, the hourly cut-off wage is $31.77 but the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corresponding yearly wage is $74,626.00.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To Susanna:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a professional PHP community and frankly, your $10/hour for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part-time work is inappropriate to the point of being insulting. You may

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply pass on by, but I'd rather not see this online space turn into a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> craigslist ghetto with its infamous &quot;looking for someone to build me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a YouTube/Ebay combo for $1,000&quot; ads.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To fellow PHP developers:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know we are all flooded with work and don't necesarily have time for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nonsense, but let's try and take care of each other. Save this link for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DOL minimum wages page and let unethical would-be clients know when they've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crossed the line. For sample language, please refer to the No Spec project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which contains lots of great examples like this.
