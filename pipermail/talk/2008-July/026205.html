</I>&gt;<i> Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As someone pointed out earlier this week, unless your app is set up so 
</I>&gt;<i> that the only entry point to it is a link from another URL, in most 
</I>&gt;<i> cases your user's entry point into your app would be typing the address 
</I>&gt;<i> directly, in which case there would not be an HTTP_REFERRER.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP_REFERRER's most common use is to track marketing and sales data 
</I>&gt;<i> coming from links on affiliates' websites, in emails, and etc. and 
</I>&gt;<i> records the URL of the referring site.    So you could determine, for 
</I>&gt;<i> instance, which one of your 10 affiliate sites sends the most customers 
</I>&gt;<i> (and how many each sends), or what percentage of persons you send an 
</I>&gt;<i> email to actually click on your sales link.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In your case, if your concern is that you want to ensure that users 
</I>&gt;<i> exit your app, I feel that programmatically closing the browser window 
</I>&gt;<i> would not only accomplish that but be best for security reasons.  
</I>
Wow, I have to disagree strongly with this (not that it's incorrect, but it is incomplete).  The only way I would think this is an 
even remotely possible design choice is if your users are &quot;captive&quot; in some way.  That is, you don't care at all how much you 
annoy them (because for whatever reaason they *have* to use your app).  I'm pretty sure that if the site is one that needs to 
&quot;attract&quot; or &quot;retain&quot; users in any way, programmatically closing the browser window is not something which should be considered 
(even if you could find a way to even effectively do it across all browsers).

&gt;<i> Or, 
</I>&gt;<i> in the alternative, but way more annoying to users, you can use headers 
</I>&gt;<i> to send them outside your app to another URL.
</I>
While I don't dispute that some users might find that annoying, I would argue that few would find it more annoying than closing 
the browser window.   In any event it's certainly possible to log the user out without redirecting them away to a foreign url. 
And I do think Kristina gives a lot of other good information.

</I>&gt;<i> If you programmatically send them back to the logon page, the back 
</I>&gt;<i> button won't then send them to the website they may have previously 
</I>&gt;<i> been on, but back to a previous page in your own app.
