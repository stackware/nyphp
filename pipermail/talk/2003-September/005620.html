Aw man... This is the NYPHP mailing list. Is it too much to ask that
people's posts be on at least one, if not both, of NY or PHP?

I know it's tempting to use this list as a general all-purpose Web
programming resource because a lot of people on the list know how to
solve problems with JSP, BSF, ASP, Tcl, etc. But please don't.

This is for PHP. (Or, as I said before, New York.) If you need the
name of a good list for non-PHP Web development questions, I suggest
webdesign-l. (<A HREF="http://www.webdesign-l.com">http://www.webdesign-l.com</A>) It covers more than just
questions about HTML and lots of people are happy to answer (and read
the answers to) programming questions of all kinds. I know; I've been
on that list for about 5-6 years now.

I'm not saying questions on SQL and Web hosting are bad. They're okay
because they're closely related to PHP. But BSF? No way.

But enough from me.
