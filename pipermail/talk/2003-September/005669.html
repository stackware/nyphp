<PRE>I largely, if not wholly, agree with Chris, particularly where it
involves &quot;people asking questions without giving any personal attempt at
solving their own problem.&quot;

A question or two for a newbie is ok, but it often seems as though the
list is used in lieu of the PHP (or other) Manual.
Often I refer to the manual to answer someone's question, and that is
just wrong.

I think that the front-end list is a bit of a stretch, but at least it's
separate (and I do subscribe to it). There are other lists available for
problems/questions concering apache, mysql, etc, specific problems.

I suppose, for example, apache specific questions could be relegated to
an <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">apache at lists.nyphp.org</A> list, which people who have no apache interest
could not subscribe to.

While I admit that I've asked an off-topic question or two and I don't
have an issue with a call for off-topic help, I think these threads
should go off-list as soon as possible.
