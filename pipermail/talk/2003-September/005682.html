<PRE>Earlier I wrote that we could have a kinder and gentler RTFM
message.

I was thinking of something like this:

==========
&quot;The reason you got the 'whatever' error was because your
php.ini wasn't configured correctly.&quot;

Did you know that you might have been able to solve this
yourself by entering &quot;phundamentals 'whatever' error
site:www.nyphp.org&quot; in the Google search box?
============

I think something like the above would reinforce nyphp as a
resource for finding out more about PHP and still encourage
people to do some homework before asking questions.

I am not suggesting that we say 'go Google on that first,
before asking that kind of question' because it would turn
people way from the site which is a good source of help.

Another problem with telling people to Google for the
answers to their questions is, as Jeff Siegel pointed out,
they may have trouble expressing what the problem is.

Along the same lines, if they are new to the language they
may have trouble sifting through all the stuff that comes
back from a Google query to find what is relevant to them.

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] NYPHP List Reorganization?

I'd have to agree with Dan. 

On an occasion or two, I have asked a question that I maybe
should of asked elsewhere. Even though they are all AMP
related it usually involves Windows as I don't have the
luxury of a Linux box where I work nor will the bossman let
me convert the server over to Linux. I always Google the
question and RTFM first before I ask, but a lot of times I
ask because I don't understand TFM. 

I have a treasure trove of saved emails that I have gleaned
from this list and refer to them as needed or save for
future reference. I would really hate to see the &quot;Elite&quot;
disappear from this list. This would cause me to try to join
the elite list to continue to glean info but be too afraid
to ask a question for fear of a &quot;What the *$%# are you doing
on this list&quot; response. In the end my effort to employ PHP
when possible where I work would suffer. 

To keep this list going I would recommend:

1) Keeping posts on topic. 
2) Subject lines should reflect what the question is about.
3) Let people know when their abusing the list. Kindly at
first more aggressively if the problem persists.
4) Read other responses to a question before you answer it
as the question is probably already answered. I see quite a
bit of this on this list. 
5) Be nice when possible. The so called Linux elitist
attitude is a turn off to those who would like to delve
further into Linux, self included. 
6) Resist the temptation to throw in your two cents for the
sake of throwing in your two cents, it's annoying. 

My two cents for keeping the list as is,

Jessica Kelly

The volume on this list doesn't seem so high to me.

How so?  If you're talking about the quality of some of the
questions 
posted, that would then wind up being the problem on any new
list -- 
unless of course said list has a restricted membership.

Considering the turn of events yesterday with Mr. Powell, it
seems the 
community can police itself.


&gt;<i> So, I'm

</I>dedicated to the

</I>other closely 
&gt;<i> related topics.
</I>
That's what this list already is.

Enjoy,
