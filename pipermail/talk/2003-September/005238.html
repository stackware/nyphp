<PRE>unfortunately, the problem comes in with the cost of the searches.  There
are multiple levels of searches available to the Travelocities of the
world - the most expensive being the up-to-the-minute fares.  If they
provided each person casually browsing for flights the up-to-the-minute
prices, they'd go out of business.  These sites only see about a 1%
conversion.

What you're seeing when you first search is not avialable fares, but cached
fares (a much cheaper search .00066 compared with .05 - or something like
that) - the travel sites will not show you the available fares until you say
you'd like to book.

That said, not all engines use the Sabre GDS (though most do) - which is the
one that charges the most for look-for-book fares - so try other sites and
you should get better results.  Though Sabre is the only GDS that offers
webfares (ie, better rates on the web than available through travel agents).

ps - one of the sites (to remain unnamed) has hired some of us NYPHPers and
once the backend is complete, I'll be sure to release the site (and
hopefully friends &amp; family rates) to NYPHPers, so keep your chin up, help is
on the way...

-&gt; [mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">talk-bounces at lists.nyphp.org</A>]On Behalf Of David Mintz

-&gt; Subject: [nycphp-talk] Travelocity sucks (semi-OT)
-&gt;
-&gt;
-&gt;
-&gt; OK, this may be a little OT, but OTOH it's about web/database programming
-&gt; (and the Customer Experience).
-&gt;
-&gt; I have been back and forth with Travelocity's customer service because I
-&gt; complained about the following phenomenon. You search for flights; you
-&gt; select an outboound flight priced at $405/round trip; you select a return
-&gt; flight priced at $405/round trip; then you come to a screen that says
-&gt; oh, sorry, make that $652 for this itinerary. Fine, you say; prices are
-&gt; volatile so let's try again. You repeat the procedure, with the
-&gt; reasonable, almost unconscious expectation that their data will have been
-&gt; updated, and guess what, you get the exact same behavior. Not amusing!
-&gt;
-&gt; Now, their customer service folks have given me a series of ever more
-&gt; muddled and inconsistent explanations. First they said,
-&gt;
-&gt; &gt; Our system pulls the information from the Sabre network onto the site
-&gt; &gt; based on the data you enter in your search parameters. The
-&gt; airlines, car
-&gt; &gt; rental agencies, and hotels publish their information in Sabre and are
-&gt; &gt; responsible for updating it at least 5 times a day at times of
-&gt; their own
-&gt; &gt; choosing. Because the availability is sold in real time, the
-&gt; information
-&gt; &gt; can become past-dated between updates. Depending on your search method,
-&gt; &gt; you may see rates/fares offered that have no availability left, or
-&gt; &gt; itineraries that show valid prices based on our most current
-&gt; &gt; information, but are actually no longer available at that price when
-&gt; &gt; checked against actual availability in the system.
-&gt;
-&gt; But when I insisted that I was the customer and I said it sucked
-&gt; that they
-&gt; were displaying stale data regardless of the excuse, they said
-&gt; (and I wish
-&gt; I were making this up):
-&gt;
-&gt; &lt;&lt;The information we receive from Airlines is current at the point in
-&gt; which is it is supplied.  We do not have have a direct connect to
-&gt; availability, once a request is made, the new request is sent to the the
-&gt; airlines to check against availability.&gt;&gt;
-&gt;
-&gt; &lt;&lt;At this point the airlines will notify us if the availability is still
-&gt; there.  As the availability is constantly changing, so is the
-&gt; availability. [sic] &gt;&gt;
-&gt;
-&gt; What is it with the airline/travel website industry? If they have the
-&gt; wherewithal to connect with wherever and fetch current data at the moment
-&gt; you are about to go for your plastic, then they can do it before they
-&gt; display the prices, can't they?
-&gt;
-&gt; Perhaps switch-and-bat is their true intention. But if they want
-&gt; to get it
-&gt; right, they should hire some NYPHPers to rebuild the whole deal from the
-&gt; ground up (-:
