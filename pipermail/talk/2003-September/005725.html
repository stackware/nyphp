<PRE>Phil,

The way this is done in the manufacturing world is with an &quot;inventory
allocated&quot; field.  This field holds the number of quantity of your current
inventory that is &quot;held&quot; or allocated for another purpose, such as checkout.
Similar to inventory in a store, nothing should get removed from inventory
until it is sold.  What this means to you - I would decrement inventory on
the screen, and if he is that particular about it, display both the
inventory and the allocated fields.

However, with this said, personally I feel that you need to do whatever the
customer is asking for, as long as it is in the scope and budget of the
project.  As a consultant, it is your job to inform him of the risks
involved (which you have done), but ultimately do what he asks.

Phil, I hope you are doing this job for ALOT more than the last one
(architecture for $68, remember?). :-)

Good Luck!

Tom

  ...am I cursed?

  Another client is threatening to &quot;delete everything&quot; calling my work a
&quot;waste of time&quot;.  There is, however, one possible sane reason for this, and
I need to get some PHP guru advice on how to handle this.

  You have ordered one item and placed it into your cart.  Let's say you
ordered one small black t-shirt.  Your cart will have the product_id,
color_id and size_id for the small black t-shirt.  The quantity of this item
is, let's say 30.  You have one in your cart, so how many are available:

  1) 29
  2) 30

  Now let's say that while I ordered one small black t-shirt, Sven ordered 1
small black t-shirt, Anders ordered one black t-shirt, and Olov ordered one
black t-shirt.  If all four of us, at one time, are all ordering the same
item and putting it into our carts, how many should there be available to
us:

  1) 26
  2) 25
  3) 29
  4) 30

  This is where the contention comes in.  The client wants it done &quot;FIFO&quot;
(First In First Out) meaning that whoever gets it first will subtract the
quantity - but I dispute that (coming from somewhat of a Java background)
that since PHP doesn't so single-threading, that means that all four of us
could order t-shirts,  but the quantity has to reflect that all four of us
are ordering (multi-threading).

  I dunno, help!

  Phil
