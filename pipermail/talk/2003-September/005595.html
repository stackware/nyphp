<PRE>&gt;<i> Today's meeting was great, It was nice to attach faces to some of the
</I>&gt;<i> regularly seen names on the list :)
</I>
it was nice to meet you too!


&gt;<i> I just wanted to comment on templates discussion that went on today. All
</I>&gt;<i> three presenters did their parts pretty well. The thing that
</I>&gt;<i> bothered me was
</I>&gt;<i> that both Daniel and Chris sort of implied that the &quot;designers&quot; are fairly
</I>&gt;<i> dumb creatures, who only know HTML, or XHTML, and are completely oblivious
</I>&gt;<i> to the whole realm of scripting. We all know that in today's market almost
</I>&gt;<i> every designer has had some kind of experience with scripting, be it PHP,
</I>&gt;<i> ASP, CF or even JavaScript.
</I>
Neither Chris or I never implied that designers are dumb. In todays market
you can find many 'Jack of all tades'. I have worked with amazing designers
and many of them did not know any programming what so ever. Not knowing a
program language(s) does not mean that one is dumb. Being able to let a
designer concentrate on what he/she does best, will result in a better
product.
I am positive that there are many good designers that know how to program,
but when I look for a solution, I would like it to fit most cases.

A word about PHPLib: it takes time to get used to! I did not go into
details, but without adding anthing else to the HTML (besides variables and
blocks), PHPLib Templates can do ANYTHING that you need be done with the
template. I have build many commercial and complex sites with it (where the
designers of the site did not know how to program :)).
