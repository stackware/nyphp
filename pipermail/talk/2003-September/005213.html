Yes and no.  I've always felt that a well designed and architectured site is divided up into these three main areas.  Regardless of the label, or the implementation itself, good design is good design.

&gt;<i> I have been building dynamic sites for a while now and have been use MVC as

I agree to a large degree.  All sites, no matter how complex, have these three main segments.  It's a matter of implementation, at the architectural and code levels, how successful and well designed a site is.

&gt;<i> I been using NetObjects Fusion as my html tool of choice and it has provided

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I try to be as object oriented in my approach as possible meaning that most

</I>&gt;<i> changes the objects respond accordingly either by making themselves visible
</I>&gt;<i> or changing configuration.  I have found that by focusing my design to

</I>&gt;<i> complex page may consist of many individual objects they are all being
</I>&gt;<i> driven by the business state machine.
</I>
Personally, I'm not a big fan of complex OO designs, especially in PHP4.  Putting aside performance issues, I've found classes/objects become inflexible and hackish as they start to grow in complexity.  And by complexity, I mean complex logic and processes; they're great for storing &quot;physically&quot; related data.  I think most would be hard pressed to show an 100% OO site.  There are always some &quot;glue&quot; functions, and instead of forcing a lot of logic into classes, a bit more equally weighted OO/procedural design can be great.

The most successful model I've found is a hybrid of OO and procedural.  That is to say, an object representing a more-or-less physical item or data, which is then processed and handled by various functions.  This is still MVC in an architectural sense, but I've found it allows a greater degree of seperation between logic and data.  Granted, with PHP4 you're not going to see much of a performance boost versus strict OOD.

Just a couple of cents,

H
