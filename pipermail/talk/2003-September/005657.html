</I>&gt;<i> [mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/talk">talk-bounces at lists.nyphp.org</A>] On Behalf Of Hans Zaunere

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [nycphp-talk] NYPHP List Reorganization?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whew, I think we'll need another server to support all the 
</I>&gt;<i> list's posts :)  Seeing this type of enthusiasm from the 
</I>&gt;<i> community is fantastic, and questions, discussions, and the 
</I>&gt;<i> back-and-forth is what mailing lists, and NY, is all about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When NYPHP-Talk first started there was very little traffic 
</I>&gt;<i> and participation (actually, none :), and so a general &quot;any 
</I>&gt;<i> topic goes&quot; viewpoint has worked very well.  Obviously, in 
</I>&gt;<i> just a year, it's grown to be a high-traffic and vibrant 
</I>&gt;<i> channel of communication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, it may be beginning to outgrow it's usefulness for 
</I>&gt;<i> some, and we want to be sure to address the needs of the 
</I>&gt;<i> entire community.  So, I'm throwing out the notion that it's 
</I>&gt;<i> time for another list, dedicated to the strict technical 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion of PHP/AMP Technology, and other closely related 
</I>&gt;<i> topics.  Topics would include Apache/MySQL/PHP of course, any 
</I>&gt;<i> related installation/system-administration/security topics, 
</I>&gt;<i> any application written in PHP, and any PHP extension/variant 
</I>&gt;<i> (so, Oracle, PostgreSQL, CLI, GD, etc).  Casual chat or 
</I>&gt;<i> posts, and other topics, wouldn't be included.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, since we do have such a diverse and knowledgeable 
</I>&gt;<i> community, NYPHP-Talk would be the place for any type of 
</I>&gt;<i> general web discussion, chat, and so forth (thus, falling 
</I>&gt;<i> inline with it's original name, 'Talk').  This organization 
</I>&gt;<i> would allow people to get their tough technical questions 
</I>&gt;<i> answered (on the new list, should we call it NYPHP-AMP ?), by 
</I>&gt;<i> probably the best AMP related lists in the world I might add, 
</I>&gt;<i> while avoiding much of the additional traffic related to 
</I>&gt;<i> other web development technologies, NY, political and other 
</I>&gt;<i> discussions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been hesitant to bring this up in the past simply 
</I>&gt;<i> because I didn't want to discourage people from using the 
</I>&gt;<i> lists, and divide the traffic up to the point that things 
</I>&gt;<i> fall dead.  And, with so many varied topics, it wouldn't be 
</I>&gt;<i> good to make people afraid to post, and asking themselves 
</I>&gt;<i> questions &quot;is this the right list to post?&quot;.  Maybe some 
</I>&gt;<i> could assist in drafting well-worded list policies, that 
</I>&gt;<i> would eliminate this ambiguity and clearly depict what topics 
</I>&gt;<i> the lists are geared towards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, with the recent addition of the front-end list 
</I>(<A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org">http://lists.nyphp.org</A> for those who haven't joined yet) we'd have a
complete and very knowledgeable set of real time resources for the
community to use.  And, with all lists available as digests (also
available via <A HREF="http://lists.nyphp.org">http://lists.nyphp.org</A>), having the traffic organized a
little may strike a nice balance for people.  I'm eager to hear thoughts
on this, either on this list or in private, and if I get a general +1 on
this, I'll have the new list this afternoon (and if anyone has any
notes/ideas to pass on about mailing list policies and guidelines, I
it'd be a very valuable addition).

It's a pleasure to be on this list, and to have seen it grow into a
resource for so many.  Thanks all,

Hans Zaunere
