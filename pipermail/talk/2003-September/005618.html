<PRE>I would ultimately like to use PHP underneath but that would require some custom JAR files to do that, that would be a trip.. for now I've tried both Javascript and TCL, I have both JAR files installed already.  What would I need to do in CLASSPATH to ensure working order; I put the path to the JAR files in CLASSPATH, what else would you recommend?

Thanx
Phil

  Well sounds more like a CLASSPATH problem then a BSF issue (a normal common problem when you try to attempt something &quot;that should&quot; work with all containers instead of what they were originally made for (Tomcat)) - thus another example of a common Java problem + why PHP is less of a hassle.  From what I remember on older versions JRun has an extensive management console that manage your .jars ... likewise you did not say which scripting language you are using underneath, for example if I use javascript w/ BSF I need to make sure js.jar is linked, etc.  

  This would be your problem if BSFManager() can't find the required libs for the scripting language.  (likewise just guessing)

    Thanx, actually I have already gone to jakarta.apache.org/bsf and downloaded the appropriate TLD and JAR files, installed, rebooted and tried using JRun, to no avail, I get NoClassDefFoundError on BSFManager() anytime I try using &lt;bsf:expression&gt; or &lt;bsf:scriptlet&gt;

    I thought that (for Dan's sake considering his PHP puritanical viewpointing) there might be some PHP programmers who can cross-program also in JSP and have run into any problems involving BSF.

    Happy now Dan?

      BSF is a generic scripting framework, but you need to say what scripting language you are using underneath ... (i dont think you can use PHP but i could be wrong) ...

      The Alicebot Program D uses BSF for executing Javascript between &lt;javascript&gt; tags.

        I'm having trouble with using BSF-generated tags in JSP, and I can't find anyone that knows what BSF is.  Can someone here may help?

        Thanx
        Phil
