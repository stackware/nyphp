</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mark's advise is very sage.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Other things to consider are what you think they can afford and/or what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you can afford to do it for and whether or not there is likely to be any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; follow-on work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To address what you can afford to do it for; i.e. how low can you go;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consider how it impacts your capacity to do other work that might pay a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better rate. If you have nothing to do, need the money and have no other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prospects, doing a project for &quot;not very much money&quot; is a whole lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better than doing nothing for no money.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I often am in the position to consider whether or not I will receive any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; additional work from a client when I am pricing initial jobs for them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I am certain that it is a one-off, I will be far less inclined to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; give them any price breaks to secure the business. If there is a good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chance that there will be more work coming from them, I will want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; develop the relationship and may consider giving them a lower or more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; competitive price so that I can be a prefered vendor for them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One forty hour job at $100/hour ($4000) is not as valuable to me as two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forty hour jobs at $65/hour ($5200) with the prospect for more work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have them over a barrel, I will usually give them my top hourly rate,
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; because, well, I can. Still, I won't overdo it and ask for $1,000/hour
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because they never truly are over a barrel. There's always someone else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who can do it for $500/hour.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In considering what they can afford, you have to examine who they are.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are they off-broadway actors (notoriously poor) or lawyers (notoriously
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well-to-do). Start-up or well-established? Don't price yourself out of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their range of affordability.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, if you can get them to divulge their budget, things get a lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easier. If not, it can take a very keen sense to arrive at figures that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both parties are happy with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Always leave yourself open to discussion and review of the feature sets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and price. I try not to allow the client to go ala carte with features,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but often their original requests contain parts of the site that are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very complex to implement and have little ROI. Identify those things,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cut them out and give them a revised quote.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry for the lengthy reply that doesn't directly address your question.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; :) Hope you/someone finds it useful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding your pricing, you need to start by breaking down the list of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features into sub-components.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Content Management&quot; is way to large to consider on its own.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Next, look at those sub-components and their details, then estimate how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; long it might take you to implement (err on the high side, you'll be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; glad you did later after returning to this list to seek additional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guidance).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Add that all up, multiply by your targeted hourly rate and add 10%-15%
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (this is easy to knock-off later in negotiations without feeling like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you're getting ripped off).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I were to price this out (not knowing what's involved in &quot;and many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other features...&quot;) I would be solidly in the 5-figures range
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ($10,000-$99,000), maybe more. After all, you did say it was &quot;custom.&quot;
</I>:<i>)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Brian
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Here are some [probably obvious] thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I would suggest thinking _not_ in terms of functionality (e.g. Content
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Management, Groupware, etc.) but rather value.  Bluntly stated, what
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the _output_ of all this stuff do for your client.  How much money
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; save?  How many more prospects will it uncover?  How much faster will
</I>it
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; increase their cash cycle?  In the perfect world, your invoice should
</I>be
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; only slightly less than the value all of these combined - the delta
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; function of client management...remember (pardon the crude analogy)
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; difference between rape and making love is salesmanship!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Ok i ahve been developing PHP web application for a couple fo years
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; they have always been on a volunteer or personal basis.  Now I have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that wants a custom web application and I am not sure how much to
</I>charge
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; them.  So of the features that this web application included are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Contact Management
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Personal Appointment book as well as global appointment book
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Resume management
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; meeting management
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; admin features(Such as adding new users)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Sending out template based email to well over 100 individuals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dynamic word document creation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and many other features...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This system is replacing other application such as Goldmine, resume
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grabber,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and will also eliminate many steps such as sending emails in outlook.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if anyone has an idea on how much something like this goes for please
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;snipped a few lines here and there&gt;
