</I>Thanks for all the well thought out replies .

My takeaway is that these databases have 2 important benefits.

1) Performance - they perform much much better than relational databases
2) Ease of programming - they make it faster and easier to code your apps

The big downside seems to be reporting, they lock you into needing a
programmer for reporting.  Which, if it makes it easier to program, is not
so bad.  And I can definitely see the attraction for internal applications
for a company that has an IT staff that can include a couple of part time
programmers[a couple for turnover reasons].

I'm not seeing it as a good fit for the company that wants to hire &quot;experts&quot;
to come in and do their work.  Or the small business setting up a site where
they will have a consultant set it up, and they will use it.  The former
mainly because until it is in widespread enough use, it makes it much harder
to find someone else to work on it - and being locked to a single provider
is never a good thing.  The latter for the same reason.

So I can see the use..... I'm just not a &quot;cutting edge&quot; person.  I use tried
and true solutions where at the end of the day Gary is not a requirement for
future changes to the system.
