<PRE>Hello Peter,

At my current company we do both peer reviews and group code reviews.
The group code reviews seem to have the best impact, as the peer reviews 
have naturally ceased to happen.

Our group code reviews happen bi-monthly and during the time (usually an 
hour) developers working on different
clients within the company will show high level (run the code, interact 
w/the UI, etc) and also walk through the source
code showing all the major components.

The audience is typically programmers, but is open to anyone within the 
company.

In the past I've also worked in companies where a senior developer will 
review junior developers major commits. What defines a &quot;major commit&quot; 
differs within companies, but this was a great way to make sure the new 
hires are obeying coding standards, not introducing new bugs, and are
using appropriate libraries (&quot;hey, we already solved that, see abc lib...&quot;).

I think the reason that our current peer reviews died was because they 
are time consuming and they were not manager driven, they were peer 
driven, so people would either be too busy to schedule something with a 
peer, or just forget. Plus, since management isn't' involved, besides 
getting a peer to compliment your work, management wouldn't directly 
hear of your accomplishments via this channel.

 &gt; &quot;On the one hand it seems like it'd be somewhat redundant since we 
are a small team and the left hand does know what the right hand is doing,&quot;
I don't think this is true - even on a small team I find most developers 
are not that familiar with the work of their teammates.
