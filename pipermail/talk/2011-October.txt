Subject: [nycphp-talk] Insert updating instead of inserting

I think, I have resolved the issue. I was not using on duplicate key, but after reading through the documentation about auto_increment, I decided to include an Id, the primary auto_incremented field in the insert statement and assign it a value of null. This seems to force the auto_increment?to do it's thing instead of updating.

Also if you don't want to receive any MySql error from the INSERT query you might want to user INSERT IGNORE, it won't do nothing if the row you're inserting is already there.

Just in case you don't find a simple solution, you can create a pipeline for the chron job and let him handle all the insert queries.

Bruce,


I have an issue I hope someone can help me figure out. We have a Mysql database
two php processes that insert new records into a table. There should never be a
time when these processes update a record they should only insert a new one.
These processes run simultaneously one running from a cron job and the other
running when requested is made via an ajax call.

For some reason when each process is working at the same time It seems to not
insert a new record but update a similar record. I am explicitly calling insert
and I do not include the primary_key id in the insert statement.

Can you post the output from SHOW CREATE TABLE and an example of the queries you're running?

Also, please don't create a new topic by hitting reply and changing the subject, it breaks threading in most mail clients.

How do you even ADVERTISE that? On the radio?  People like words, that's 
why Chinese or Arabic characters make decent domain names, and we 
punycode them to make them palatable to our ASCII-valued eyes.  But "dot 
dot com"?  It's almost as bad as Tony Finch's email address -- of which 
I am *insanely* jealous.

Returning to the my original obPHP (so that Hans doesn't get upset at

and how well does PHP+your underlying OS manage it?  Do you need to do 
environment-wrangling to make encoding issues go away?  Tedd's original

not see a difference between the two.)

PUNYCODE is the ULR for IDN (Internationalized Domain Names). PHP doesn't have to deal with it any more/less than any other URL.

For most browsers, entering a PUNYCODE string is the only way to provide Unicode characters (code-points). It is only in the Safari Browser where a user can enter a string that can be composed of something other than ASCII AND the browser will accept that string as a real URL and direct the user to the proper URL. Whereas, other browsers convulse.

Nothing o the above has anything to do with PHP.

The following is from memory and may be flawed, but should be close:

Now, in PHP string management (string functions) that's a different story. Using the standard built-in PHP functions to deal with strings, such as strstr(), please realise that these routines deal with standard ASCII strings.

If you are dealing Unicode strings, then they are handled differently, such as using the routine mb_strstr() (the "mb_" mean muitibyte) of which Unicode strings are composed.

In other words, the extended charset taken from standard ASCII and expanded to include all Unicode (actually ASCII is a subset of Unicode) required more information to properly address each code point. In doing so, special functions had to be created to deal with the extended set of characters (code-points) that the Unicode database provides.

I understand that, but I'm asking something like: if you type in ?.com 
into your browser, what's getting passed to the server behind the 
scenes?  Are we dealing with $_SERVER['HOST_NAME'] being the unicode 
value?  If your browser punycodes that, how do you make sure that you 
are getting the same thing?  So what comes through in the HTTP header, 
what does the server see, what does the PHP interpreter see, and how do 
you match up http:// www.3?.com with  http:// www.xn--3-6mb.com?

Obviously I'm not talking about dealing (necessarily) with user input or 
display -- those are different things.  I don't run a server that hosts 
an IDN domain name, so I don't even know what ends up in the logs, and 
what PHP sees from the Hostname: HTTP field, and ... ?

(Oh cool, Verizon's mail server scanned this initially, found the IDN 
URL in the message, and determined this to be spam.  Neat! Therefore, I 
have added spaces above to thwart this behavior.)

The non encoded string (xn--...).  It must be this way because the
HTTP protocol requires the header to be completely US-ASCII.

It is best to think of punycode as just a browser adress bar display hack.

I would read that as 'the encoded' (into punycode) string, and not 'the 
original' (aka the single unicode character) string, but that's just a 
quibble.  Thanks for taking the time to read the RFC for me :-)

> It is best to think of punycode as just a browser adress bar display hack.

??? um, you just said it's the punycoded string that gets passed 
through, because the Header element needs to be US-ASCII.

It's not so much a hack but rather the way one can send information that exceeds the capability of the medium.

The Internet is/was based upon a seven-bit character set and not 8 (or greater). As such, simple ASCII was used from the beginning. Domain names composed of ASCII characters posed no problems -- after all they're all English characters. However, when additional characters were needed (non-English), there was no way to address them. After all, if you are held to only 127 possible characters (seven-bit), how can you address over 65,000 characters as found in the UTF-8?

So, circa 2000 the IDNS WG was established to create a method to use seven-bit addressing to accomplish more than what HTTP was originally designed to do. One of the first algorithms was AMC, followed by RACE, and finally followed by PUNYCODE. These were simply algorithms that used a prefix (such as "xn--" as found in PUNYCODE) to identify that the characters transmitted were to be transposed to code-points. For example, the string "xn--19g" meant that the "xn--" string identified the string as a IDNS domain and the "19g" was transposed by the PUNYCODE algorithms to produce a square-root symbol.

I believe that Browsers like Safari have the PUNYCODE algorithm already built-in and thus can make the translation "on-the-fly" between characters entered via the keyboard and what's transmitted via HTTP. Keep in mind that PUNYCODE was never meant to be seen by the end-user. All domain names were supposed to be seen in their native language.

Now, my understanding of the specific process may be flawed, but my description should be generally correct. Please understand that I lurked on the IDNS WG at the time (circa 2000), but did not fully understand everything that was discussed. There were some very smart people on that WG.

last a long time (e.g. 60 minutes) AND if a restore from some service
failure was done quickly, then it MIGHT be worthwhile to include your
session directory in backups.  BUT, this is still somewhat problematic since
we'd have lots of files (large cost compared to small gain).

What do you do?

I would say no... the nimble session and lethargic backup/restore models
just don't fit in my opinion.

If there are that many sessions, and/or they are that complicated and long
lasting, they should be stored in some type of database anyway.

Thanks Hans,

That's what I was thinking.  It's good to get the feedback.

Hi,

	I am working on porting a site from a custom LAMP code base to Drupal 7. Drupal is running pretty slow on the same server config/VM that has hosted the site nicely for years. I have enabled Drupal caching but things are still sluggish. I am trying to determine what a reasonable hardware config would be to run Drupal. We currently run on a fairly standard LAMP stack and serve around 500k pages a month on a VM with 512MB of RAM. 

	Essentially my question is, how much hardware does it take to run Drupal compared to a straight php/mysql site? Also are there some configuration changes I could make that would speed Drupal up, other than the standard stuff I have found on the web? Any insight or comments or ideas would be appreciated.

	Thanks,
		Russ

I can't imagine how slow Drupal would run on even a super-computer.

Oh, Try installing Varnish Cache though, it will definitely speed it and everything up, I guarantee it.

You don't have a great deal of detail about your setup, custom code,
what response times (in ms) you expect, but here are some broad things
to think about.

1) Look at your modules' memory footprint. There are modules to sort of
help you do this, but the "turn one off then look at your web server
memory usage" is often faster. Turning off modules or writing custom,
optimized code does sort of defeat the purpose of using a modular system
like Drupal, but it's sometimes unavoidable with piggish modules (and
it may just be small number or single culprit.)

2) Aside from normal caching, make sure you're using minified JS,
gzipped HTML output, APC, a reverse proxy(Squid or a module like
Varnish) for static content and/or something like Boost, separate hostnames
for different sorts of content to increase parallelism, etc. The Page Speed
module for Chrome and Firefox is helpful here. Depending on your
specific site, memcache can also be helpful.

3) Check your MySQL query cache, key cache and friends. tuning-primer.sh
is very handy for this.

The other considerations are of course your VM host/machine. Are you sharing
the system with many others? Has their usage ticked up recently? Is your
host's (or your own) internal/external networks' usage increased? With
the ease of cloud rollouts these days, you can easily check it by
deploying a copy of your setup elsewhere (AWS <-> RS, for example) to
quickly sanity check your hosting environment.

As far as whether your setup is underpowered, it's hard to huge without
knowing the specifics of your site. Highly dynamic? Lots of complex
DB queries? 

Anyway, that should get you started.

Another pertinent question is how many concurrent logged-in users do you
average?  Drupal is actually pretty good about caching pages for
anonymous users because they all see essentially the same output.  But
lots of login accounts creates lots of dynamic overhead, particular with
the database.  While Drupal passes core common data in the environment,
the downside of modules is that they're each responsible for fetching
their own data from the database, where you're at the mercy of the
module developer.

I worked on one Drupal site where there were 26 SQL queries posted for
each page.  Optimizing the database for high traffic and gobs of cache
memory paid the most dividends there.  So is, as another subscriber
noted, profiling the modules you've got running.

Drupal is a memory monster I am running with APC
and this is my set up on my php.ini:
max_execution_time = 120     ; Maximum execution time of each script, in
seconds
max_input_time = 60     ; Maximum amount of time each script may spend
parsing request data
memory_limit = 256M      ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume
(16MB)

My set up on my setting.php file:
ini_set('arg_separator.output',     '&amp;');
ini_set('magic_quotes_runtime',     0);
ini_set('magic_quotes_sybase',      0);
ini_set('session.cache_expire',     200000);
ini_set('session.cache_limiter',    'none');
ini_set('session.cookie_lifetime',  2000000);
ini_set('session.gc_maxlifetime',   200000);
ini_set('session.save_handler',     'user');
ini_set('session.use_cookies',      1);
ini_set('session.use_only_cookies', 1);
ini_set('session.use_trans_sid',    0);
ini_set('url_rewriter.tags',        '');

I have 89 modules in my set up, but only about 75 modules are turned on

I hope it helps,

:-)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] XPath Assistance
Message-ID: <4E510CF3-1414-48F9-922B-C13CD8082B3C@gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I have recently been working with XPath and have a document setup like the code below

<div id='content>
<h3>Content</h3>
<div class='log-entry'>Content</div>
<div class='log-entry'>Content</div>
<div class='log-entry'>Content</div>
<h3>Content</h3>
<div class='log-entry'>Content</div>
<h3>Content</h3>
<div class='log-entry'>Content</div>
<div class='log-entry'>Content</div>
<div class='log-entry'>Content</div>
<div class='log-entry'>Content</div>
<div class='log-entry'>Content</div>
</div>

What I am attempting to accomplish is grab each H3 element and then grab every log-entry class element that immediately follows the H3
up until the point when another H3 is found.  Basically the same results as JQuery's .nextUntil() function.

Is this possible to do in XPath?  Would I have to work up some PHP code to replicate JQuery's .nextUntil() function?

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Here is my example code: http://codepad.viper-7.com/BOz0Ak
Note that my current xpath query fetches ALL log-entry's and not solely the siblings of the current h3 tag

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

If you need it dynamic or on a network service; utilize an ICAP server through a proxy to apply the transformations invisibly.  GreasySpoon is a very great project and is used commonly with Squid, very easy to setup and great admin UI to manage your page modification ( or req or res); and a lot more

Does anyone know the directives that will work for me? 

 

Or do I still need to know more info about what type of Apache I've got?

I'm not exactly sure why it's not working for you.  I use those directives on Apache 2.2.17 on my mac.

Does "apachectl configtest" give you any errors or warnings?  Where do you place those directives?  Top-level, virtual host, directory, htaccess?

in an immediate subdirectory I have this legacy site with the html pages as

the .htaccess file is in that subdirectory

 

I just set up .ssh access for myself last week. I need to look up my

but I'll get in there and run that command.

I'm not exactly sure why it's not working for you.  I use those directives
on Apache 2.2.17 on my mac.

 

Does "apachectl configtest" give you any errors or warnings?  Where do you
place those directives?  Top-level, virtual host, directory, htaccess?

Does anything work in your .htaccess file?  Maybe AllowOverride is turned off so the .htaccess files aren't being processed.

Are you seeing your php code output to the page?  That's what I think would happen if the AddType/AddHandler directives aren't working.

The index.html page comes up, but I see in the source that several 

php snippets such as  this <?php include(some.php) ?> are actually printing
out

so the directives are not working 

 

I tried this:

DirectoryIndex index.html

AddType php5-fastcgi .htm .html

AddHandler php5-fastcgi  .htm .html 

 

Does nothing.

 

And this: 

DirectoryIndex index.html

AddType x-httpd-php5 .htm .html

AddHandler x-httpd-php5  .htm .html

 

Produces HTTP 403 Forbidden error page

You probably don't need the AddHandler line.  I don't in my Apache 2.2
config.

I was thinking the same thing.  Peter needs to look at Apache's
error.log.  Also, is the .htaccess file, and all of the files for that
matter, readable by the web server's "user?"

Good luck,

Ouch.  Have you asked your hosting company what settings are needed
and/or looked at their help/manual?

I'd run "grep -r php /etc/apache2" (assuming you're on a *nix/BSD box) and
see if that provides any clues.

Okay I will fess up in full here.
This is all happening in a virtual hosting environment in which I run my
personal websites for business and hobby earning a few monthly dollars.  
All using the godaddy deluxe linux hosting package running now on their new
grid hosting called Linux / 4GH web hosting

I am allowed to have .htacces files at the root and in subdirectories,
config allows overrides

It is poosible I can see my apache error logs thru the godaddy admin
interface. I've gotta look now.

Meanwhile, I have mis-remembered my SSH login creds and so can?t do that for
the moment. 

And the godaddy support team remains resolute in providing no help on
.htaccess directives and 
cannot/will not clairfy why the directives that used to work in my legacy
server environemtnt don't work now.

The new server environemnt is literally a whole lot faster than the legacy
and I do not want to roll back.

I'll be here reseraching this all till I get it. Thanks, in the meantime,
for all the input.

Okay. Using a different tactic, what mod rewrite would for this given
subdirectory cause 
all requests to:

anyfile.html or anyfile.htm to always map to anyfile.php

...not issuing 301 or 302 and without the browser or search engine spiders
and bots knowing. 

If that is possible? 

(Then I would gladly rename all my site file extensions to .php).

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule (.*).html?$ $1.php [L,QSA]

If that's the case then you need to use:

AddHandler php5-fastcgi .htm .html

So did you try

AddHandler x-httpd-php5-cgi .htm .html .php
AddHandler x-httpd-php-cgi .htm .html .php

Really, Rob, Daniel, Dan, Ajai, thank you all. 

AddHandler x-httpd-php5-cgi .php .htm .html
AddHandler x-httpd-php-cgi .php4 .htm .html

This is what works in this setup. And the .htaccess is working in a
subdirectory.

And for me and my set of sites, my website page load speed has vastly
improved.

It has gone from worst case scenario to best case.

Thanks again. 

The sites involved are the http://capehazeinsider.com
and the still in dev http://palmislandinsider.com 
and soon to come http://bocagrandeinsider.com  and
http://englewoodinsider.com

php instead of HTML?
Thanks

Started the Capehazeinsider.com html site as a personal travel log collecting local Florida info I could not find online so that I could look it up reliably later. Told some friends, put AdSense on it, did some SEO on it, submitted site maps. Gets some quality organic page 1 search results on the very niche terms related to "Cape Haze". Only using PHP for very  basic work. By any standards will always be a very modestly trafficked site. But it does generate bankable income. The spin off South West Florida sites are being built in Drupal 7 leveraging LAMP and will attempt to take more volume vying on search terms with easily 4 - 20X more searched on volume than Cape Haze. I will be rolling out google DFP (DoubleClick for Publishers) which will serve AdSense as a fallback within it. I will circle back to Cape Haze Insider in 1 -2 yrs and pull into Drupal. So for now until the other sites overshadow it, Capehazeinsider.com will keep html pages and I will not tinker with its search engine edge. I know the whole techie SEO-friendly 301 permanent re-direct is acceptable strategy but still rather hold as is. And PHP, well, it is in great shape and probably doesn't mind. And all will ultimately get mobile HTML5 versions too that I will generate from pretty simply re-themed Drupal 7 output.

Hi:

http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/10/19/analysis-of-compromised-web-sites-hacked-php-scripts/

Alas, it only looks at the results of the attack, not how the attacks
are getting through in the first place.  Of course, this is how:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Top_5#P1:_Remote_Code_Execution
but it'd be good to know which holes are currently being exploited.

Hello Dan, 

> but it'd be good to know which holes are currently being exploited.

Well of course it would be, but I think we can safely assume it's unpatched known exploits
in common popular software platforms (wordpress, drupal modules, etc) or 0days against the same.

We'll see soon enough.

For those of you who are not familiar with OWASP, take a minute to review. There is a ton of great
security related information and methodologies there.

Yes, exactly.

All of those things we saw back in 2004 that were unbelievably sloppy
are still around. The bad guys are just getting better at finding and
exploiting them. Aided by easy access to stolen credit card info, no
doubt. How secure is a shared web host against attack by a customer?
Not very.

It would be more interesting to find out that these attacks are
happening in VPSes or private servers, which would indicated a real
exploit, rather than on GoDaddy or Dreamhost or some other shared
system.

ARP MITM attack on your RackSpace Cloud instance and check for yourself; there are various 'routes' to obscenities of your imagination; lol.
