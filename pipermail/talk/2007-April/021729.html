<PRE>I get newsletters and flyers which have a picture based layouts.
If I turn
off HTML I cannot get a quick look at the page a know anything. 

To me this is a case where HTML mail is desirable and
beneficial. I am not
so sure I want my mail client doing AJAX round trips. There is
way too much
spam already, let alone spam which has dynamic content
updates...that
worries me.

Those font attributes are in printing apps because they are
printing 
apps. Email is and always was intended and therefore designed to
handle 
flat ASCII.
The main reason why I recommend against HTML in emails is that
most 
popular email clients apparently have problems with either
displaying or 
securely handling it (bad handling: Eudora, security problems
see e.g. 
here <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/267we7">http://tinyurl.com/267we7</A> [second page, middle]).

You also refer to very basic font styling, which makes me think
if there 
is a need to an email specific markup that does only that, but
not all 
the stuff that HTML and ECMAScript can do. Let's say, there
would be 
such an ESML (email styling markup language), email clients
could simply 
ignore anything else but this.

I had frequent problems with HTML emails and finally got
convinced that 
turning all this eye candy crap off is the way to go. Since then
I never 
came across a single occasion where I thought, gee, some bold or
colour 
is really needed here.

In regards to the original post, when HTML in the email isn't
direly 
necessary (which I think it isn't) then the problem goes away,
because 
it never occurs. Avoidance is a valid approach to problem
handling.
