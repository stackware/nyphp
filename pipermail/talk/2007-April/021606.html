I agree, I thought for some time on how to optimize my code and I am 
pretty sure there are things that give me a bigger bang for the buck 
than changing double quotes to single quotes.
I further think that there is a balance between code performance and 
readability. I've seen code where the programmer drops out of PHP for 
even a single word instead of concatenating that into the echoed string. 
  That is plain silly and I doubt that this turns into a performance 
improvement at all compared to doing that for the before mentioned 100 
lines of static text. But even for that there is maybe an explanation. 
The first thing for PHP that I learned was this:
print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
It took me about a year to make the move to the much easier echo and 
much later I learned that I can drop out of PHP into plain HTML and then 
go back. Bad practices are typically coming from bad teaching, and 
especially the PHP manual on php.net makes excessive use of double 
quotes. No wonder only a few really understand what the difference is, 
what to use when and why.
