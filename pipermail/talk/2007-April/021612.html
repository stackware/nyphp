<PRE>I would also like to express agreement with Micheal.

Code readability is extremely important. In PHP you're often working 
with several different languages at once, and it's important to keep 
that in mind (especially if you're working with other developers who may 
be specialized in certain areas).

A few microseconds are important when speed is your *top* priority, but 
rarely does it ever become that. As developers our job is to evaluate 
the priorities that come into play and make the decisions that offer the 
best balance.
