The manual indicates that's for MyISAM tables.  You said you're using 
InnoDB.

I am currently using this regexp noted below to validate client-side
before the user submits so that 
at least their email is well-formed:
 
var emailRegxp = /^([\w]+)(.[\w]+)*@([\w]+)(.[\w]{2,3}){1,2}$/;
 if( emailRegxp.test(strng) != true ){
  return false;
 }else{
  return true; 
 } 
 
But, this regexp is not accepting emails of the form name at tom-cat.com
It is rejecting the hyphen in the domain name.
 
Does anyone have a real-life tested simple regexp that would plug into
the 
snippet above and be more complete?
 
Thanks to all.

The Daily WTF had a regular expression recently on their page that was 
supposed to be the be-all end-all for email validation.

http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Validating_Email_Addresses.aspx

It's near the bottom of the page. The comments have a lot more examples 
and discussion about email validation in general.

I use the regexp from Chris's Essential PHP Security book:
http://phpsecurity.org/

$email_pattern = '/^[^@\s<&>]+@([ -a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,}$/i';
if (preg_match($email_pattern, $yourEmailVar)) {
	echo 'It's good';
}
else {
	echo 'There's a problem';
}

Note, the echo's are thrown in for clarity, those aren't part of  
Chris's example code.  =)

Just ran it on your tom-cat example.  Passes through ok.

I'm personally no good at all at regexes, but a colleague sent me a link to this story: 
http://worsethanfailure.com/Articles/Validating_Email_Addresses.aspx

which does have what the author claims to be a pretty complete email validation regex at the bottom

	good luck,

Any RegExp gurus care to do an educational breakdown of the RegEx filter
in that function?

I just can't get my head around regular expressions, too much like
algebra and Perl  ;-p

TIA,

Tim

I use the regexp from Chris's Essential PHP Security book:
http://phpsecurity.org/

$email_pattern = '/^[^@\s<&>]+@([ -a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,}$/i';
if (preg_match($email_pattern, $yourEmailVar)) {
	echo 'It's good';
}
else {
	echo 'There's a problem';
}

Note, the echo's are thrown in for clarity, those aren't part of  
Chris's example code.  =)

Just ran it on your tom-cat example.  Passes through ok.

Hi Aaron,

> http://phpsecurity.org/

Cool. :-)

I actually prefer Cal Henderson's pattern, because he meticulously
crafted it from the RFC, and it's still reasonably short. The one in my
book works well, but it's slightly more lenient than necessary.

If/when I write a second edition, I'll likely point readers to Cal's
pattern or perform the same exercise.

Thanks! I plan to bring some more free copies to a NYPHP meeting, but I
keep missing them due to being out of town. Hopefully I'll catch the
next one.

Hi,

I'm sort of new to PHP but not new to programming and am looking for some
advanced PHP training / classes (offline, in NYC, or online).  Does anyone
have any recommendations?  I'm thinking about the Zend online classes, does
anyone have a point of view on those classes?

Thanks in advance,

Also, NYPHP's own "Front-End" list (meaning, anything that happens on
the client) is still active. We'd love to see more CSS / Javascript
questions posted there.

Oops.. yes Dan.. I overlooked it.. and was using that on most of my tables,
when I needed bulk inserts..

I just checked it on my 4.12-max

mysql> alter table personaldetails disable keys;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> show warnings;
+---------+------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Level   | Code |
Message                                                             |
+---------+------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Warning | 1031 | Table storage engine for 'personaldetails' doesn't have
this option |
+---------+------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

So it seems that for InnoDB engine, dropping the indexes, and recreating it
is the only way.. ?

Ah yes, I see that.  They just don't have their home page updated.   
The home page says only for Windows.  It's only once you arrive at  
some of the lower tier pages that a Linux version is mentioned.

Have to add this to the list of reasons to upgrade to a new Intel  
based Mac.  RegEx Buddy looks nice.  Hopefully their software is  
better than their web design.  =)

OK, so let's say I'm trying to make an honest go of it and resist the 
urge to use TABLEs for non-tabular data.

So how do I handle this one?

I'd like to have two links on a page.   They should be on the same line 
together, one flush left, the other flush right.  The TABLE method is 
just to have two cells, but of course we don't want to do that.

What I tried was putting two divs, one after the other.  The 2nd one was 
relative positioned with its height at -1em.  This did not work on IE 6, 
and as I am using a downloaded template, as I twiddled I quickly 
realized I was going to make it a lot worse before it ever got better.

So right now I am using a TABLE  and wondering if anybody can teach a 
database guy yet another CSS trick.


P.S., you know I wonder if there is something about programmers, 
especially db guys, preferring that TABLE element, some kind of 
subconscious thing...

You have the option of floating them both. Add float: left; to the style 
or the CSS specs. Either that or you could float: left; one and float: 
right; the other.

You could use float:

<div style="text-align:right;">
<a href="#" style="float:left;">Link Left</a>
<a href="#">Link Right</a>
</div>

I'm sure there are lots of other ways too.

Ken,

If you need another example, I just happened to be practicing my CSS
layout skills today with a new project I'm starting. Below are links to
the HTML page and the CSS for it. It's about as clean as I think I can
get it:

http://www.supercoups.com/fms/fms_template.shtml

http://www.supercoups.com/fms/includes/fms.css

I think you'll get the idea by looking at the source for each document.

Compare that to this document created by a web design shop:

For the past 3 days, I have treaded through css hell converting a site 
from nested tables to non-table css. There were issues with background 
colors not showing through, columns not lining up, padding and margins 
on boxes are handled differently between IE and Firefox and various DTD 
types, quirks mode vs nonquirks??, phantom rows appearing from nested 
div's with multiple floats in IE, and a myriad number of other browser 
incompatibilities/bugs.

All this was a result of some twisted desire to make table rows 
drag+drop resortable with dom/javascript magic.

After all the CSS quirks were addressed, I discovered that the 
scriptaculous drag+drop functions would slow down or  lock up the 
browser when there were too many elements to sortable. Ugh. Now, I'm 
working on writing my own leaner drag and drop script which will 
hopefully run more quickly. They say what doesn't kill you makes you 
stronger. I'm not sure if I am any stronger, but I did lose a few 
handfuls of hair in the process.

You might want to look at the Drag & Drop module of the Yahoo User 
Interface libraries <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/>. I've 
never used this feature, so I can't tell you if you will run into the 
same problems, but it might be worth a look.

Message-ID: <001801c75da9$e0ffb8a0$6401a8c0@SUNCODE1>

I believe it could be appropriate to used nested divs, as in roughly:

<div id="parent"
style="position:absolute;top:100px;left:270px;width:400px;height:300px;b
ackground-color:#eheheh;color:#333333;">
<div id="c1"></div><div id=c2"></div>
</div>

Some benefit(s) are you can position the parent div absolutely or
relatively, and set the width as a percentage (100%) or exact, such as
400px. Then the child divs when positioned can be positioned relative to
the parent x,y position on the page, if needed. And then use whatever
attributes work to position the child divs. Or you may find that you can
apply align or alignment properties to the content itself that is in the
child divs, such as text-align:right.

And just while I'm here. For those who like to sip their CSS, and use it
to help finely tweak the formatting of a page (especially text and
images that are within parent table(s): don't neglect the font/text
prosperities like text-decoration, text-align, line-height,
letter-spacing, font-weight, and font-style. These properties which used
to fail are actually nicely applied in modern browsers. E.g. this
baseline class when applied to a <div> or <td> tag will allow you to
really tune your text till it is quite perfect within your layout:

.pulloutcopy {
	font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	font-size: 12px;
	color: #091016;
	font-weight: 900; /* value 900 = bold, 100 = book */
	font-style: normal; /* value oblique creates ital */
	text-decoration: none;
	line-height: 21px;
	
	padding-top: 0px;
      padding-right: 8px;
      padding-bottom: 0px;
      padding-left: 15px;
}

OK, so let's say I'm trying to make an honest go of it and resist the 
urge to use TABLEs for non-tabular data.

So how do I handle this one?

I'd like to have two links on a page.   They should be on the same line 
together, one flush left, the other flush right.  The TABLE method is 
just to have two cells, but of course we don't want to do that.

What I tried was putting two divs, one after the other.  The 2nd one was

relative positioned with its height at -1em.  This did not work on IE 6,

and as I am using a downloaded template, as I twiddled I quickly 
realized I was going to make it a lot worse before it ever got better.

So right now I am using a TABLE  and wondering if anybody can teach a 
database guy yet another CSS trick.


P.S., you know I wonder if there is something about programmers, 
especially db guys, preferring that TABLE element, some kind of 
subconscious thing...

This was my first approach.  However, there is a ripple effect to take 
into consideration.

In my case I was dealing with some custom content nested about 8 levels 
in on a template that I downloaded from somebody else.  When you use the 
position: absolute, you must take into consideration the parent element, 
so then I'd go change that, messing up the template, and trying to fix 
it would just start breaking more stuff.

That was my motivation for a construction that was free-standing, that 
would not require any settings in the containing element.

~Rolan:

You want drag and drop stuff, look into Query. This is an example:

Hey Hans:

One possible thing could be the slow log.  Do you have it turned on?  If 
you do, large extended inserts will land in the slow query log, slowing 
down the whole insert process.

My workaround is before making my dump, create the file with a query at 
the top that extends the setting for long queries.

    echo "SET @@session.long_query_time = 3600;" > ~/$name.sql

DIVs are block elements, which have an implied <br /> in them.

Consider using SPANs, which are inline elements which don't have an
implied BR, for things that are side by side.

Hey everyone,

Is anyone familiar with this Spreadsheet_Excel_Reader class?
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=99160

I need to import Excel to MySQL. This class seems promising -- I have
started playing and can get the data into PHP, no problem. Except that the
single quotes, double quotes, em dashes, et cetera are wreaking havoc. Does
anyone know of any solution? I see there are setOutputEncoding() and
setUTFEncoder() methods but I am not sure whether they are what I need and
what values to pass them.

Thanks.

But why not use the old-fashioned way and export your Excel data in a CSV format and import it into MySQL?  I do it all the time with locally inserting Office data into a MySQL database and creating backups for my database.

Just be careful if you're exporting CSV's in a mac and using fgetcsv(). 
You will need to set "auto_detect_line_endings = On" on the php.ini or 
the line breaks will be ignored.

I wanted to avoid the extra step of exporting to text, as in fact I've done
in the past. And I expect to have to repeat the procedure in the future.
But.... maybe that's the way to go after all.

Thanks for the suggestions!

Can't resist trying to pick your brains a little more instead of spending
the next $x hours in trial and error.

This is an Excel spreadsheet created on Mac. I am opening it with Open
Office Calc on a Fedora Linux box. I can "Save as..." and choose text, and
there are  myriad choices for "Character set." Which is my best bet?

Thanks again.

Well, I've certainly seen people use Javascript validation as a way to 
avoid using "MVC" thinking and complexity in the back end app.

Back in 2000 I developed an application for a client who insisted on 
Javascript validation and told me that he didn't need server-side 
validation... Against my advice. Soon he called me up to complain about 
the junk data accumulating in the database because a certain fraction of 
people had Javascript turned off.

As a maintainance programmer, Javascript terrifies me. Javascript is a 
powerful language, and I've seen beautiful code written in it, but it's 
got a number of problems:

(i) Browser compatibility -- I've seen a lot of Javascript break in IE7. 
Not just the racy, AJAX style of Javascript, but the pre-2000 form 
helper kind of Javascript.
(ii) Bad Smells -- Javascript often gets used as a band-aid to patch up 
problems in deficient web applications. (Is a bad smell in itself) As a 
result of this, Javascript is often applied in a disorderly way with no 
thought about organizing code into functions, how variables are named 
and scoped (which can really burn you in Javascript) and how event 
handlers get wired in.
(iii) Small System Limitations -- one of the problems that torpedoed 
Java applets. The trouble here is that there is a gap between practices 
for writing good systems (good for the user, which means they don't an 
hour to download) vs. what most people think are good software 
engineering practices. (writing generalizable code;) In most cases, it 
makes a lot of sense to use libraries and frameworks. On the other hand, 
I was thinking about reworking my 3-d viewer Javascript:

http://polyhedra.org/

to use Prototype. It turns out that Prototype is a 40kb download while 
my 3-d viewer is 8kb. That kind of ratio would be fine for a PHP 
framework, that the client doesn't need to download over a slow link, 
but it does make a difference in the Javascript user experience.

---

As for how many people have Javascript turned off, I will share 
something. It always seems that it's the gatekeepers of life who run 
funky web browsers. It will be the people at your next job interview, 
the venture capitalists, the thesis advisor, the people on the grant 
committee, who have cookies or Javascript turned off in their web browser.

+1 brilliant insight.

I'll add that they typically have slower-than-normal internet
connections, unusual screen resolutions, and strange font size
defaults in their browsers. Or a projector that can't display certain
colors.

If anyone on this list is an executive, and you haven't set traps for
unsuspecting techies, you're really missing out on some good fun. Just
delete Verdana from your computer and watch what happens at the next
application demo!

And don't forget that the first time you show anyone anything you've 
programmed, it's going to fail regardless of how many times you have 
tested it. Or, at least that's been my experience -- but perhaps I'm 
the only SOB that this happens to. :-)

For me it generally works the first time you show it then fails as soon
as you go on on vacation.

Same happens to me. It works and looks great until I show my boss or client.

Who is the Managed Dedicated Hosting provider of choice today?  I have a 
quote from RackShack and would like to seek some competitive bids.  
Since Cyber X Designs typically provides the hosting services, I am not 
sure who to go to for quotes.

So what does this have to do with PHP?  We developed an airline 
reservation system for regional carrier in Alaska.  The system is 
written with PHP/MySQL.  It includes booking, ticketing, servicing, 
frequent flyers, corporate accounts, ect.  It is pretty damn cool and 
the customer is out growing their current hosting solution and I am 
tasked with finding another hosting provider.

I know this topic is covered every couple of months on the list.  I am 
looking for timely recommendations from experience, I know you guys must 
be provisioning these services for your clients and employers.

Thanks in advance,
Hans Kaspersetz

I've had good experiences with PAIR networks: http://www.pair.com/

My current employer has a dedicated machine with GoDaddy. So far it's 
been very stable, and the support is mostly competent, although if you 
get their support package, they deny you root access. And you're limited 
to RedHat and/or CentOS, I think.

Hi Hans,

If I were you, I'd stay away from RackShack. While they appear to be a 
fairly good company to provide managed hosting, I was told they also are 
blacklisted by many ISP's for allowing their customers to spam.

Right now, we're looking for a hosting solution for a new webmail program 
we're deploying. We're looking seriously at RackSpace (www.rackspace.com). 
Amazon also seems to be about to change the hosting landscape with their EC2 
service. Check it out too.

Anthony

I use pair networks and like them a lot.  Not sure whether they are/not
super competitive on price; very impressed with their service.  If you're a
FreeBSD guru (I'm not), then you probably don't want to pay for "service"
you don't need.  Here's a link to their pricing so you can compare
apples-to-apples: http://www.pair.com/services/dedicated/

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Friendly URL, Ajax, and SEO
Message-ID: <45F017CF.1080809@secdat.com>

Lately I'm wondering about best designs when balancing things like a 
friendly URL, Ajax, and SEO.  It seems there are some contradictory 
indications.

First, friendly URLs are great if for no reason than log analysis. 

However, friendly URLs are supposedly better for SEO also (besides all 
the other stuff for SEO).

The rub is that I'd like to start moving over to AJAX for CMS-related 
stuff, such as loading a news article when the user clicks on a 
headline. But this seems like it make the site very search engine 
un-friendly. 

Anybody care to comment on the problem as a whole?  Is it an either/or 
choice?

I like to back-load all my ajax on top of already working pages, so for
instance I might have:
http://www.example.com/news/

And clicking on a headline on that page with js disabled would go to
http://www.example.com/news/headline_with_underscores_or_whatever

But clicking on it with js enabled would just load the story dynamically.
Keeps everyone happy - including your visitors of the arachnid family.

Mark, web searches on "js graceful degradation" and related terms are 
getting me a lot of blog entries about *whether* to do it, but not much 
about *how*, can you offer a link that gives the basic howto of putting 
both kinds of links on the page?  Thanks.

Basically, you have a regular <a> tag link that goes to the location  
you want, but you also have an onclick javascript event for that link  
that does the ajax stuff and returns false so that the browser  
doesn't request the href part of the tag.  Ideally, you'll have an  
onload event to your page that attaches all these onclick events to  
your links so that you don't even have inline javascript.

I want to enter the 21st century and add a forum to my site.

My ISP offers phpBB2 and Discuss, a CGI-based forums. Or I can add my own.

Does anyone have suggestions regarding a great forum package for a business,
not consumer, web site? What about vBulletin, although it looks like a
commercial product. Is phpBB2 the way to go? I though it was known to have
security issues. Suggestions?

Exactly... To test, you can do without the onload, just put your scripts at
the bottom of the page.  The added benefit to backloading your ajaxification
is that regardless of js enablement, the user could right click your link
and open in new tab or window or even bookmark it and it's still a plain
link that will open normally.

I would usually have all this in some elaborate library built for the
project with all kinds of fancy news specific 'stuff', but essentially
here's how I would do it (tested example in ie and ff - so you can download
prototype.js and test if you like)...

<html>
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="prototype.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <a href="/article/1" id="show_article_1">Show This Article</a>
    </body>
    <script>
        /////// This should probably be in a separate script file and get
started by an onload as Rob mentioned

        // give the link an id for function reference
        $('show_article_1')._id = 1;

        // tell it what to do with a click
        $('show_article_1').onclick = showArticle;

        function showArticle(link) {
            link = getTarget(link);

            // prototype::insertion - add the new paragraph tag after the
link
            new Insertion.After(link, getArticle(link._id));

            // change the link to close the article
            link.onclick = hideArticle;

            // make sure our link doesn't actually go anywhere
            return false;
        }

        function hideArticle(link) {
            link = getTarget(link);

            var the_article = $('article_' + link._id);

            // make sure we have an article to kill
            if (the_article !== undefined) {
                // kill it!
                the_article.parentNode.removeChild(the_article);
            }

            // change the link to show the article
            link.onclick = showArticle;

            // make sure our link doesn't actually go anywhere
            return false;
        }

        function getArticle(id) {
            // fling ajax brand pixie dust into air, clap hands and return
story text or for now, just 'story text'
            return '<p id="article_' + id + '">' + 'story text' + '</p>';
        }

        // cross browser utility function to get a link target
        function getTarget(element) {
            if (window.event != undefined) {
                return window.event.srcElement;
            }

            return element.target;
        }
    </script>
</html>

and some notes...
When you set an onclick event it passes itself (or a 'click' element) to the
function.  What's actually passed differs between browsers, so getTarget
ensures we get our anchor tag back every time.


I use prototype for my projects as it's done very well by me.  If you're not
familiar...

the $ function is nearly an equivalent to document.getElementById

the Insertion class handles manipulating the innerHTML in and around the
elements in your document.  It has 4 methods
Insertion.Before
Insertion.After
Insertion.Top
Insertion.Bottom
(I'll let you guess what they do)


Always return false from your onclick functions.  This tells the link not to
redirect.  Probably good to put some exception handling to make sure it
returns false no matter what.


And that's it.  Properly ajaxified / backward compatible.  Family Fun for
everyone.

Good luck, and thank you for the opportunity to procrastinate!

If you don't mind waiting a little, or don't mind it's not officially 
out, the first Release Candidate of phpBB3 will soon be released. Even 
the beta 5 version is very stable. You can see it in action here

Hey all, long time lurker...

I've had problems keeping bots out of phpbb (have tried all sorts of 
extensions).  vBulletin, no issues.  Have they gone after that in 
version 3?  Other than the bots, I like that system much more than vb.

Cheers,

Pete Czech

I used Mercury Board http://www.mercuryboard.com/ for my site. I tried
phpBB2 but had a lot of issues trying to theme it to match my website.
Every time I'd go to edit a theme, even so much as to simply change a
logo, the whole structure of the board would break down and I'd have to
re-install phpBB2. It's possible I just don't understand the whole .tpl
system but I didn't have the same issues with Mercury Board.
 
My site is at: www.boyden.us, the board is at: www.boyden.us/discuss 
 
It's not a commercial site but there's no reason why you couldn't use
Mercury Board for a commercial site.

I want to enter the 21st century and add a forum to my site.

My ISP offers phpBB2 and Discuss, a CGI-based forums. Or I can add my
own.

Does anyone have suggestions regarding a great forum package for a
business, not consumer, web site? What about vBulletin, although it
looks like a commercial product. Is phpBB2 the way to go? I though it
was known to have security issues. Suggestions?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] One more question about Friendly URLS
Message-ID: <45F044ED.9080401@secdat.com>

Last question on friendly URLs.

These are very easy to generate and parse, thanks to the tips I've 
gotten here on NYPHP, but I ran into one very strange detail and I'm 
sure I'm not the first human being to hit this problem.

It seems that relative links to CSS and JS all suddenly break.  So if 
you have:

www.example.com/friendly/varname/varvalue/varname/varvalue

and you have a link to "css/main.css", then it will not be able to find 
the style sheet anymore.

So it seems natural enough to make the link dynamic, but then I stumbled 
over finding the "stem" as it were.  Without friendly URLs I have code 
that does not need to know its own site name, it works from context to 
build links.  But with this stuff going in it got really nasty trying to 
do that.

Has anybody else run into this, or rather, what are the standard solutions?

The most common way, I've seen is to keep all your css at  
www.example.com/css/*.css so that way your links in the page are "/ 
css/main.css"

You can still use relative URLs. Just use an absolute path:

/css/main.css

Hope that helps.

Without a doubt, phpBB is a nice forum and one of the most popular ones 
with tons of features. The only not so great thing about it is the 
search function. You cannot go to a post that has no subject, which is 
the default setting for replies. Nevertheless, I'd go with phpBB.

I did have that problem on my website, the CAPTCHA, or image 
verification, that comes by default doesn't do anything against bots.
I use this extension: http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=344831 
for the image verification, I haven't had bots since I implemented it. 
(Yes, humans have registered since.)

Id agree w/ someone else + say @ least look at EC2 from Amazon ...  
here is a good podcast on the subject ... http:// 
www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1728.html

The main point of using the service is that when you hit that spot  
where you say "the customer is out growing the hosting solution" you  
fire up as many new EC2 instances (ie full virtualized servers) that  
you need, and when/if the load drops you kill the instances.  Ive  
never really understood the need for a "queue" service in a web app  
until I listened carefully to the podcast and put the true automation  
aspect together, where you can say if there are x reservations in the  
queue I need y instances.  When the job is done go to z instances.  I  
think more and more will drop the whole idea of "managed hosting" (as  
in racks/co-lo/disk/memory) and look at what parts of their app need  
the scalability and use something like EC2.

Just a thought.

So both are actually relative, it is more a matter of relative from 
where?  A "relative" path is relative from the complete path of the HTTP 
request, while an "absolute" path is relative only from the domain of 
the HTTP request?

No, an absolute path is different than a relative path. It represents
the same path regardless of the location of the current resource.

Hope that helps.

Yeah... just to clarify further:

Absolute path:
http://www.example.org/css/main.css

Relative path that will start at whatever comes after your domain  
(i.e. it's still relative to the domain):
/css/main.css

Relative path that starts after the request uri:
css/main.css

I'm not positive on this... but I think an addition advantage of  
relative urls (in addition to not needing to know the domain) is that  
the browser will reuse the same http connection.  Can anyone verify  
that off the top of their head?

The difference is in the terms "relative/absolute URL" and 
"relative/absolute path".  An absolute URL starts with 
"(ftp|http|etc.)://" and generally works against you when it comes to 
caching, etc.  An absolute path starts with "/" and indicates that the 
given resource can be found by appending given path to the site's domain.

Using an absolute path gets you none of the troubles you mentioned with 
relative path, and none of the caching problems you'd get with an 
absolute URL.

This is more often described as an absolute URL, although it does use an
absolute path.

This is an absolute path, not a relative one.

Yes. :-)

The only trouble I have found with absolute paths is that it makes the
assumption of DocumentRoot and where your files are to it.  If all of
your environments (dev, staging, qa, production, running off media,
whatever) are set up the same way, no problems.

But, using absolute paths removes the ability to just copy a bunch of
files in a directory and run them.  Now, in today's day, our sites are
now "applications" and you probably couldn't do that anyway.  Still,
if you did, I found the following to work in the past:

Simply make the call to the css file a PHP script, which has the
'smarts' to figure out where the CSS file is based on the URL
provided.  The PHP script still has to live absolute to the Document
Root, but it can act as a "traffic cop" to determine which CSS file
should be loaded.  So, something like:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="csshandler.php?p=foo.php">

FWIW, I really don't do this anymore, and even when I did, it was only
in development (because you'd want to be sure that files weren't
getting served up that shouldn't be) on my laptop.  But it gets around
the problem.

Yup, this is the only problem.

I think however I might be ok.  Andromeda tracks the directories that 
apps are in and can make that known to the app, so it can add the 
directory to the domain name itself.  Now that I've got the theory down 
this should be easy enough to do.

The method used by me to salvage this kind of coding (bad though, but get it
working fast), is to use
Apache mod_rewrite, with a top level htaccess containing the following

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} ! -f
RewriteRule (.*)/css/(.*) css/$2 [L]

Have a website that a non profit uses for their organization.  Have  
been trying to install FCKeditor so users would have a way of editing  
the pages.  Documentation is spare and rather cryptic for use as a  
standalone editor on existing site.  I can't for the life of me  
figure out the most basic function like opening a html document on  
the server.  Does anyone have any experience with this as a  
standalone.  Have been using it in a joomla site and like it.  Forums  
not much help either.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mysql_real_escape_string and setting of charset
Message-ID: <45F1A936.1090808@criticode.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Good afternoon all,

I have several questions regarding mysql_real_escape_string (and the like).

When default_charset is not set in php.ini, it appears that PHP has no
fallback default.  Am I wrong in this thinking?  Is UTF-8 the default?

It seems best practice would dictate using the same charset from
persistent storage (ie., tables defined as utf8_unicode_ci), through to
HTML output (Content-type header, meta tag).  But what about cases where
the database needs to use UTF-8, but a front-end is being written that
does not?

What is the behavior of mysql_real_escape_string when default_charset is
not defined?

Also, how does one define charset (as it pertains to
mysql_real_escape_string) at runtime?

And could anyone direct me to (or incant) a working exploit that takes
advantage of the default_charset not being defined, or being defined
incorrectly?

I've been doing my homework on this, but am coming up with insufficient
information on this topic.

Thanks very much everyone,

Darian

To clarify, I'm unclear as to what "connection" means in

"Escapes special characters in the unescaped_string, taking into account
the current character set of the connection so that it is safe to place
it in a mysql_query()." -
http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php

I'm guessing it's the charset of the MySQL client
(http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-client-encoding.php)
connection.

I wrote this one a while ago:

It doesn't answer all of your questions, but I think it might help.

Message-ID: <C12F0900C695FF47AEE0A7C2C75760A09043A8@greenmonster.supercoups.local>

Hi All,
 
I will be starting on a project to convert a fairly extensive Microsoft
Access based application to a web based version. This application was
internally built to manage all manner of details regarding our
franchisee operations (financials, reporting, CRM, etc..). It uses MS
Access forms with a tabbed structure and various form elements. The
application will be hosted on a Network Solutions shared hosting server
that has an Apache 1.x, MySQL 4.1.x, and PHP 4.1.x back-end. The MS
Access application uses an MS SQL 2000 Enterprise database for data
storage.
 
I could use some recommendations on tools that will help me convert this
app as quickly as possible. Everything from IDEs to conversion utilities
are on the table. Unfortunately changing the web infrastructure is not.
 
Traditionally I code and manage my app files using Macromedia
Dreamweaver.
 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
 
Regards,
 
Tim Boyden

Hmm, why not just leave it as-is?  Whatever you may think of MS Access 
(I'm not a big fan myself), its got to be simpler and easier than 
splitting it into 3 pieces and using older versions of all three. 

What is the motivation for doing this?  Just to get web access?   If so, 
use Terminal Services.

Shared hosting?  The project doesn't warrant its own server?  Doesn't 
add up.  If its that big and is contributing to the bottom line one 
would think it could justify a server and the admin's choice of tools, 
languages, etc.

why just make the form and routinexs to edit the access do, php can use 
the access db for the data soruce.

Perhaps I need to clarify some...

The Access database is just a front-end to an MS SQL server.

Some issues that this causes: it is not cross-platform; it is not accessible
outside the corporate network; the presentation is intertwined with the
logic making it difficult and time consuming to update features; the
application has not been refreshed to keep up with current Microsoft
technologies and as such parts of the code keep breaking as Microsoft
obsoletes older parts of the VB and ASP languages.

Budget constraints dictate that we make do with the resources that we have
available to us. As such, adding Terminal Server infrastructure or
purchasing a dedicated hosting service is not in the cards. From a security
standpoint we?re not comfortable exposing the current MS SQL server on the
web, and we don?t have a server we can dedicate at this time to put out in
the DMZ for this project. Plus we?re not sure how well our internet
connection would scale as this app grows, we?re not really setup for web
hosting on our own. We already have the Network Solutions hosting in place
and run other applications on there that this application would integrate
with, as such it would be ideal for us to build it on this existing
infrastructure. This application isn?t our entire business but it does serve
to glue a few other main line apps together to automate some functions of
our business. 

I?m not saying this app needs to be completed tomorrow, but anything that
would help make the process go faster would be great.

Hmm, why not just leave it as-is?  Whatever you may think of MS Access (I'm
not a big fan myself), its got to be simpler and easier than splitting it
into 3 pieces and using older versions of all three.

What is the motivation for doing this?  Just to get web access?   If so, use
Terminal Services.

Shared hosting?  The project doesn't warrant its own server?  Doesn't add
up.  If its that big and is contributing to the bottom line one would think
it could justify a server and the admin's choice of tools, languages, etc.

I'd just start from scratch and use the new web based system for new 
stuff and the old system for legacy stuff. There is a transition time 
while two systems are in use, which sucks big time, but it depends on 
how quickly records gets obsoleted overall.
Starting from scratch allows you to do things differently that do not 
work that great in the current system (believe me, there are things like 
that in every system). Since CRM data is usually the most interesting, 
I'd see that you isolate that information and device a one time import 
plan, e.g. via csv and some one time use code that sucks that all into 
the MySQL database (if code is even needed). Doesn't SQL server export 
SQL directly?
My point is to foremost forget about the old system and make a new shiny 
one. Then see on how to get old data ported over, ideally the least 
amount with which you can get away with.

Just the 2? from someone who never did anything like this....

Hey, Timothy,

Do you only want to convert it to a MySQL database?  If so, each access table is just an MS Office table (same as an Excel spreadsheet).  You can export each table into a CSV file from Access and create each field name as a MySQL field and just import the data into MySQL as importing a CSV file in PHPMyAdmin.

If you want to keep it as an Access database, I know it can be done.  I googled PHP MSAcess and here's two links:

Hi All,
 
I will be starting on a project to convert a fairly extensive Microsoft Access based application to a web based version. This application was internally built to manage all manner of details regarding our franchisee operations (financials, reporting, CRM, etc..). It uses MS Access forms with a tabbed structure and various form elements. The application will be hosted on a Network Solutions shared hosting server that has an Apache 1.x, MySQL 4.1.x, and PHP 4.1.x back-end. The MS Access application uses an MS SQL 2000 Enterprise database for data storage.
 
I could use some recommendations on tools that will help me convert this app as quickly as possible. Everything from IDEs to conversion utilities are on the table. Unfortunately changing the web infrastructure is not.
 
Traditionally I code and manage my app files using Macromedia Dreamweaver.
 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
 
Regards,
 
Tim Boyden

Hi there:

Another post not answering your question about FCKEditor, but because  
of your very problem, I ended up incorporating TinyMCE into my  
content management framework instead:

http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/

Seems to be rather well written.  I'm happy with it, and my clients  
are too.

Cheers,

Marc

Hello all.

Does anyone here know about some good tool for static analysis of PHP code?

I know only the PHP-SAT tool (
http://www.program-transformation.org/PHP/WebHome )
and the Pixy tool ( http://www.seclab.tuwien.ac.at/projects/pixy/ )

    No matter who you are,  you need to find an answer to these problems.

    One answer is to always use a new virtual host to deploy a new 
instance of a system.  It's easy to do this with Apache.  At my last 
job,  I developed a system for packaging an entire virtual host in a 
single directory -- each directory would have a "conf",  "htdocs" and 
"logs" directory.  We'd add "lib",  "var",  "scripts" and similar 
directories if they were appropriate.  The httpd.conf file would include 
a "vhosts.conf" file that simply includes the virtual host configuration 
files from the vhost directories.  The vhost directories go in a 
structure like

/usr/local/apache/sites/www.site.com

    In this scheme,  most web sites have three "primary" configuration 
parameters.  These are:  (1) the virtual hostname,  (2) the location of 
the "sites" directory,  and (3) connection information for the 
database.  A site built to this scheme can often be moved or cloned in 
under five minutes.

    If you work this way,  a good practice with URLs is to base them all 
"relative to the virtual host",  which means like

/img/logo.gif
/css/main.css

    this way you know that every resource on the site can reference 
every other access without recomputing URLs.

    Another good practice is to use the "root" directory sparingly.  
It's OK to have

/robots.txt
/favicon.ico

    and other filenames that are mandated by outside conventions,  but 
install a CMS in it's own directory,  say

/a/

    where you let your CMS do whatever it wants.  The reason is that you 
might switch to another CMS in a few years,  which you can
install under

/b/

    When you decomission CMS A,  you build something (URL rewriting 
rules,  a script,  whatever) that redirects /a/ -> /b/ as accurately as 
possible.

----

    Unfortunately,  not everybody can use the above scheme.  It's not as 
easy to pull off with Microsoft IIS,  and some people don't have good 
control of their DNS.  Also,  general-purpose software (say PHPBB or 
Wordpress) will be installed in subdirectories by people,  so it needs 
to be able to live "whereever"  (using <base href> can help,  but opens 
it's own bunch of problem.)  No matter what,  software should configure 
the toplevel URL and the toplevel of the app in the filesystem in a 
single place,  in a file that's unique to each instance of the app 
(often the one file ~NOT~ in the version control system)

    It's hard to say.  You really ought to consider this option,  but it 
depends on how you feel about the quality of the existing database.

    I recently did some work on a project that was botched by another 
programmer -- the presenting problem was that a particular feature 
didn't work right.  Looking deep inside,  I saw that certain database 
structures were hopeless,  making the feature impossible to implement in 
a reliable and maintainable way.  It took about 100 hours to understand 
the requirements,  change the database structure and rework the rest of 
the application to use the new database structure.  After all that,  it 
took 5 hours to implement the new feature.  What's great about it is 
that the new design reflects the business reality so well that it 
reflects scenarios that the client and I never thought of -- and can 
sometimes be accomodated in 15 minutes to 2 hours worth of work.

    If the old database design is good,  it makes sense to keep the 
database.  If the old database makes you want to punch the wall,  then 
you'd better consider switching.  Even though desktop databases are 
often overgrown spreadsheets,  I've seen Access databases that are as 
beautifully designed as any Oracle or MySQL database.

    If you keep the existing database,  you can have the PHP and Access 
versions running in parallel.  You might port the 20% of functions that 
80% of people use to PHP first,  and make a gradual transition towards 
eliminating the Access version.  This approach takes a lot of risk out 
of the transition -- one problem with the "Build System B and migrate to 
it" approach is that you might build system B from scratch and think 
that it's really great,  but discover that the migration isn't really 
possible once you try it.

+1.........  You never really know the gremlins that live deep in that 
database that make ETL or migration a complete fiasco until you run your 
migration scripts several hundred times trying to get all your data to 
look right to the end users. If it was a custom app, you never know when 
some programmer, or several personalities, a couple of years ago decided 
to change the date format and has included a patch in his code to deal 
with the two or more formats but didn't tell you.  You go to key off 
that date and you find your scripts inexplicably failing.  You look 
deeper and find 6 different date formats in the same column.  Who would 
have guessed we store dates in 6 different ways?  Hmm.... then you 
discover that not all accounts have all information because columns were 
added as time went on and requirements grew. 

It seems so easy to move data from flat files (access) to a relational 
database in concept.  In a trivial system it might be easy, however the 
cost associated do not grow linearly.  It seems to grow much faster then 
the perceived complexity of the problem, ask Airbus.  They just had some 
wires that were the wrong length.

Then you start to try to take advantage of RDMS and you find that 
incomplete data or data that is not keyed properly doesn't move 
gracefully.  You find that the original design of the flat files falls 
short and needs to changed to support the new app.  So you start to 
transform the data to fit the new schema and you find that keys you 
think would be no brainers don't exist or are incomplete.

On top of that, you design all these new data structures and classes to 
do really neat things.  Your very proud of yourself and the way the 
application behaves with test data.  Then you shoe horn the old data in 
and your application looks more like a cubist painting then a crisp 
photo from a Canon 20D with an L lens.  Then you spend some more time 
massaging the data.  In the end it is beautiful, but it requires a high 
level of expertise and the constitution of Conan.

I speak from direct personal experience working with data collected over 
the course of 20 years.  It is not impossible, I know, we are 
successfully doing it here.  I happen to be blessed with working with a 
very talented team of people.  But you have to be very very aware that 
there are things that you don't know that you don't know. Ha ha ha....  
It is a very painful lesson to stand in front of the CEO and CFO and 
explain that you just spent 160 man hours working on how to retrieve and 
correctly key broken data from the old system.  Data everyone thought 
was locked down until someone in sales says they can't find some over 
looked piece of data when he is testing.  Your story may not be the 
same, but your feelings will be.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] DST & cron jobs running an hour late
Message-ID: <a304e2d60703120835i624b97f8x9f9afad535d14a7e@mail.gmail.com>

I update my time on my RHEL 3and when I type 'date' on my systems it
is correct, but I noticed that my cron jobs are running
an hour late and my PHP applications that are using
the date command are displaying the time without the change
I did not think that we needed to do anyhting on PHP to deal
with the DST.
This is my php command that causes the problem:
  <?= $today = date("F j, Y, g:i a"); ?>


My 00-logwatch cron has a perl command
for 'localtime(time)' and that display as 1 hour later
This is what I get now:
 ################### LogWatch 4.3.2 (02/18/03) ####################
       Processing Initiated: Sun Mar 11 05:02:04 2007

This is what I used to get:
 ################### LogWatch 4.3.2 (02/18/03) ####################
       Processing Initiated: Sat Mar 10 04:02:03 2007

Any ideas how to fix this problem.

Thanks,

N?stor :-)

Maybe, but how would that fix the date in my PHP applications?
The cronjob is perl file

and when I type the command the following command the output is correct:
# zdump -v /etc/localtime | grep 2007
/etc/localtime  Sun Mar 11 09:59:59 2007 UTC = Sun Mar 11 01:59:59 2007 PST
isdst=0 gmtoff=-28800
/etc/localtime  Sun Mar 11 10:00:00 2007 UTC = Sun Mar 11 03:00:00 2007 PDT
isdst=1 gmtoff=-25200
/etc/localtime  Sun Nov  4 08:59:59 2007 UTC = Sun Nov  4 01:59:59 2007 PDT
isdst=1 gmtoff=-25200

Subject: [nycphp-talk] FOSS Event in Technopark Trivandrum -- Suggest a Event
	Management System
Message-ID: <6431a0f40703120938h3782e2c4ndd8e04af57545d25@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Introduction:

It has been a long time since we were having the idea of organising a FOSS
event in Trivandrum.  Most of you would not need an introduction about what
Technopark ( http://www.technopark.org) is.  Any way the use or adoption of
FOSS in the Technopark is not quite that deep, and we AFAIK dont have any
meetings or UGs. Still some of us are really enthusiastic to plan for an
event in may be mid of  June 2007.

The event is planned to be a two day event, with free admission, first come
first served.  The event will be sponsored by some companies inside the
Technopark.  Our plans are to highlight

1. Benefits and general methods of FOSS adoption
2. Benefits and general methods of FOSS contribution
3. Technical sessions covering PHP, MySQL, Mono

with mostly giving emphasis towards financial benefits, while adopting as
well as contributing.

The portion where I am stuck is with contributing delegates, or speakers.
And I am at a loss on
how to go around asking for people to come and present the above matter in a
two day workshop.

Now that the above is said, I would appreciate if some one could point me to
an event management system which would help me setup a website for the
specific event, preferably SugarCRM, Drupal or Nuke Module would be the
best, or even a standalone one which should ofcourse be PHP / MySQL.

I am using php 4.3.2
I had to do the following to have my date show up correct
but I have to remember to change it bac on NOv 4th 2007 (yack!!!)

// echo date("F j, Y, g:i a"); //this line does what the next 3 line of code
do
                                        //except that the date is wron gby
1hour
   $today = getdate();
   $mydate = $today['month'] . " " . $today['mday'] . ", " . $today['year']
. ", " . ($today['hours'] + 1) . ":" . $today['minutes'] ;
   echo $mydate . "<br>\n";

I tried setting the time.zone but it did nothing and it complaint when I
tried
to use date_default_timezone_set() because that is a php 5 function

I need to find a better solution!!!

Thanks,

N?stor :-)*

I have decided to use javascript which uses the system date
and that way I do not have to worry about it.

<script language='JavaScript'>
var rightNow = new Date(); // create a new variable called .rightNow.
document.writeln(rightNow.toLocaleString());
</script>

Hello

I have uploaded many swf (flash file) and stored their names to tables .

When someone clicks on the swf banner, it will directs to its  destination

How can I add hyperlink to swf files. I found code from net to include swf
files to html. The code is below:

               ##   $image_name, $width, $height. will come from table.

                 <OBJECT
classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"              codebase="

This is code to get and use the flashplayer plug-in. 

The code includes 3 variables for the videoor image content: 1) $image_name, 2) $width, 3) $height

 

The call to the player is this: 

        <EMBED src="images/upload/'.$image_name.'"quality=high WIDTH="'.$width.'" HEIGHT="'.$height.'" 

        NAME="MyMovieName"ALIGN="" TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash"

The 3 vars are there-in: 

$image_name, $width &$height

You need to place your content details into these variables.

I think you need to modify the actual SWF to handle the hyperlink
behavior on click.  I don't believe it's something that can be done
outside of the SWF.

Actually, maybe you could do it with JavaScript event handlers, but I
very seriously doubt it.

HTH,

Darian

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Webinars: anyone want to present and promote....
Message-ID: <45F823AE.7090608@danhorning.com>

I'd like to sponsor a few Technical & not so technical Webinars and 
would like to see if any of you would like to not only promote it - but 
possibly be a part of it - we can have up to 1000 +1 (me) on the event 
including a conference call and multiple panelists (where you guys might 
come in)

For those who dont know me - i've been a nyphper since almost the 
beginning and have been so busy with clients lately that i've found it 
hard to keep up on the list - we all know what the feels like on 
occasion. and now that my company has grown thanks to advice and help 
from many nyphpers and wwwacies (ask me if you dont know them)i think 
it's time to give back.

I personally would like to do some webinars on using CMS effectively, 
working with ecommerce, php 5 common errors, using php 5 efficiently and 
many more ideas.

the key here is getting us to all promote them - (I'd be sponsoring the 
events myself) since the 1000 person mark is the limit i think we might 
be able to even find ways to make that limit need to go higher.

the backside idea is that panelists present and would also leave with a 
list of attendees and their interests - I think this would be a great 
way for our influence in new york city to expand to areas all over. (and 
since i'm up in the albany area - I'd really like to be more involved...
any ideas you might have would be appreciated (wwwac members may notice 
this to be a similar email)

-Dan Horning

PS -= the goal is to have a webinar a week - following a plan of techie, 
non-techie, nyphp members special, and a free for all webinar (where the 
panelists would answer questions on the fly to the best of their 
ability). thus making it easy to promote these events to your clients - 
since you know ahead of time the topics

PPS -= once i get some feedback I'll start creating a schedule of events 
which will be posted to this list and to my website 
http://www.americandigitalservices.com/

talk to you soon

This is the best way to add Flash to HTML: http://blog.deconcept.com/ 
swfobject/

So in your case it would be like this:
<script type="text/javascript">
    var so = new SWFObject("images/upload/' . $image_name . '",  
"mymovie", "' . $width . '", "' . $height .'", "7", "#336699");
    so.write("flashcontent");
</script>


To add click urls, you need to modify the source for the swf.  It is  
possible to do this programmatically.  The OpenAds (formerly  
phpAdsNew/MaxMediaManager) project does it: http://www.openads.org/   
Take a look at the www/admin/lib-swf.inc.php file.  You want to make  
your swf accept an actionscript argument that contains the link where  
it should go when clicked.  The standard name for this argument is  
clickTAG.  So with you swf modified, here's your embed code:

<script type="text/javascript">
    var so = new SWFObject("images/upload/' . $image_name . '? 
clickTAG=' . $whateverUrlYouWantToGoTo .'", "mymovie", "' . $width .  
'", "' . $height .'", "7", "#336699");
    so.write("flashcontent");
</script>


Good luck!

It could be that Clorinthia just blasted that to their whole address 
book, inadvertently spamming the talk list.  That or Google is trying to

As some of you may have seen I have been working on a google maps mash up
for work.  We have it working great however
we have several people from the same company who register.  This caused
issues with the map a little so what we determined we would do
is check to see if we have already used that coordinate, if we did we would
add 0.0005 (or something) to the coordinate so that it wouldplot it close
but not on top
of the other markers.

I created this function that takes 2 arrays as arguments

function nextCoord($coords, $usedCoords)
{
    list($lat, $lng) = each($coords);
    $lat = (float)$lat;
    $lng = (float)$lng;

    if(in_array($lat.':'.$lng, $usedCoords))
    {
        $lat += 0.0005;
        $lng += 0.0005;
        return nextCoord(array($lat, $lng), $usedCoords );
    }
    $array = array($lat, $lng);
    echo '<pre>'; print_r($array); echo '</pre>';
    return $array;
}

The issue here is that the print_r that i have there outputs odd results
like the following

Array
(
    [0] => 0
    [1] => 32.766592
)

I am not sure what is going on there.

Pretty much this function takes the coords in this format lat:lng and checks
them against the $usedCoords array
that is passed into the function.  If a match is found it will call the
nextCoord function again until it get's to one that is not
already used.

Can anyone shed any light on the reason why it is returning the odd results
you see above?

Here is the code that consumes the function above

        list($attendee['lng'], $attendee['lat'], $attendee['alt']) =
(isset($googleData['kml']['Response'][0]['Placemark'][0]['Point'][0]['coordinates']))
? explode(",",
$googleData['kml']['Response'][0]['Placemark'][0]['Point'][0]['coordinates'])
: array(0,0,0);

        $coords = nextCoord(array($attendee['lat'], $attendee['lng']),
$usedCoords);
        list($attendee['lat'], $attendee['lng']) = each($coords);

        array_push($usedCoords, $attendee['lat'].':'.$attendee['lng']);

Take out each (), e.g., list ($lat, $lng) = $coords;

 

As a side note, you can do echo '<pre>' . print_r ($array, true) . '</pre>';
to save yourself a few key strokes.

haven't used swfobject in quite some time, so I'm not sure of the
internals or usage, but you may have to put the so.write call _after_
the flashcontent div is defined.  You can probably put it right after,
at the bottom of the page or use an onload event of some sorts to run
it after the page has loaded.

Try this:

<html>
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src=" swfobject.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            var so = new
SWFObject("images/upload/so_tester?clickTAG='http://www.biokerala.org?id=10'",
"mymovie", "468", "60", "7", "#336699");
            so.useExpressInstall('expressinstall.swf');
        </script>
        <title>Flash</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="flashcontent">
            This text is replaced by the Flash movie.
        </div>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            so.write("flashcontent");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL Clustering & HA
Message-ID: <C2200735.C958%jhy2104@columbia.edu>

This might be a little off topic, but I'm wondering if anyone has experience
with MySQL clustering?

I'm working with a System Administrator to architect a failover solution and
he's under the impression that we need MySQL HA, but I don't see that
product offered on mysql.com, all I see are MySQL Cluster, and MySQL Cluster
Carrier Grade.

Also, what are the limitations/requirements for deploying a cluster into
production? Is this something easy to setup, or worth hiring a consultant
for?

Thanks in advance,
Dave

I'm looking for recommendations of excellent web testing open source 
tools that run on Linux and cover testing areas that include functional 
testing and performance testing. Capture and creation of test messages 
that easily handle the web interface is important. My intention is to 
create a test regression package of test scripts to verify a web sites 
functions. For performance I'm mainly concerned with areas of how well 
a given web site performs under heavy traffic conditions and measuring 
its capacity.

Im also after such an all in one click package.  One of the better  
things I have seen lately was a really good analysis w/ httperf (but  
the tool is so old!), yet always highly recommended ...

http://www.peepcode.com/products/benchmarking-with-httperf

I think ab (Apache Benchmark) and httperf are the norms (for free  
tools) but there are other interesting packages like webstress ...

Check out SimpleTest.  it doesn't do any benching, but the web tester  
stuff should handle everything else you're going for.

I have no idea.  I tried your code and it works fine for me.  Maybe  
you should post it publicly and we can use Firebug to try to track  
down the problem.

Clustering can be a little tricky.  For one thing, it's a RAM based
database, so capacity planning is important.  It's fairly straightforward to
set up, but not as simple as MySQL itself.

I think I'm actually speaking with someone from Columbia about cluster next
week.

Hi David,

I am just providing list of certain softwares that can be useful for various 
types of testing. 

Unit testing at code level: PHPUnit2 and SimpleTest (PHPUnit2 is purely for 
PHP code while SimpleTest can be used for code + web page functionality 
testing) 

System testing: Selenium

Usability testing: ab, httperf, OpenSTA

These all are open source and very popular.

I think they are trying to get out of having all of the data in  
memory ...

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data.html

The one slick part of ~newer~ versions is autodiscovery ...

-snip-
Autodiscovery of databases is now supported for multiple MySQL  
servers accessing the same MySQL Cluster, provided that a given  
mysqld is already running and is connected to the cluster at the time  
that the database is created on a different mysqld.

I was mainly concerned towards "programming" so looks like I need change my

Now, I want to make this a bit more user friendly and create URLs like:
myhost.com/MayEvent07

Is this done via an apache mod? or can I do this in PHP ... The app is developed on my company server,
so special configurations are not a problem. However, its a software product, that will be deployed on hosting 
company servers, so I'm not sure if I will have the ability to run apache mods (if that's the answer).

Thanks!

Has anyone used mod_rewrite with lighttpd?
I tried to use it but can't get it to work.

Also, you can usually put mod_rewrite rules in a .htaccess file -- so  
it doesn't require httpd.conf access.

Even without mod_rewrite, you could still do myhost.com/index.php/ 
MayEvent07 -- you then look at $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], remove  
index.php/ from it, and then explode on / to get your args.

Even if you are able to use mod_rewrite, you probably need to do a  
database lookup to find MayEvent07 so your mod_rewrite rule would be  
something like this:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule !\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css|html|htm|xml|php)$ index.php

Then you still process it by exploding $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] but  
you won't have index.php in that string.  The rewrite rule forwards  
everything to index.php except for files with the extensions listed.

Hi gang:

I got the idea of how to change things so that if the user types in a 
url to a part of your site, then you can redirect the user to where 
you want.

For example, long ago I had my site setup with folders and indexes. 
For example, one folder was named "contact" with my contact page 
residing inside named as index.php.

For SEO considerations I changed everything to root level. For 
example, the "contact folder index page" combination was changed to 
just contact.php.

However, that left legacy link problems where people/SE's/etc had 
previously linked to my site using the old links.

To solve that problem, I simply used htaccess like so:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^contact$ contact.php

That meant that anyone who had a link to my previous contact, would 
be redirected to my new contact.php. Everything is cool.

However, I liked the way the url looked before. I liked:

[1] http://sperling.com/contact

instead of the new:

[2] http://sperling.com/contact.php

How can I get the url displayed to look like number [1] regardless if 
the user adds ".php" or not?

In other words, I know how to redirect the user to where I want, I 
just don't know how to change the url the user see's -- how do you do 
that?

Thanks,

tedd

Hey Rob,

So I decided to do what you mentioned:

$eventNameStr = strrchr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], "/");
$eventNameStr = substr($eventNameStr, 1, strlen($eventNameStr));
error_log($eventNameStr); <-- this is the other line of the error log snip 
below

However, I'm getting some wierd script action..

Here's a snippet from my error_log( ) calls when loading: 
http://192.168.1.102/pc_release/index.php/26657d5ff9020d2abefe558796b99584

[19-Mar-2007 13:53:08] 26657d5ff9020d2abefe558796b99584

[19-Mar-2007 13:53:08] DBAS: 192.168.1.106 connected to mysql server db 
'hhc'
[19-Mar-2007 13:53:08] favicon.ico
[19-Mar-2007 13:53:08] DBAS: 192.168.1.106 connected to mysql server db 
'hhc'
[19-Mar-2007 13:53:08] pc_app_logo.png
[19-Mar-2007 13:53:08] DBAS: 192.168.1.106 connected to mysql server db

[19-Mar-2007 13:53:08] favicon.ico
[19-Mar-2007 13:53:08] DBAS: 192.168.1.106 connected to mysql server db 
'hhc'

As you can see, its loading the file (index.php) 5 times for a single 
request. (the hash, style, favion, png and favicon)..

Now, when loading:
http://192.168.1.102/pc_release/index.php?act=700&eventid=26657d5ff9020d2abefe558796b99584

[19-Mar-2007 13:54:09] 
index.php?act=700&eventid=26657d5ff9020d2abefe558796b99584
[19-Mar-2007 13:54:09] DBAS: 192.168.1.106 connected to mysql server db 
'hhc'

So, any ideas as to why its working like this?

- Ben

Tedd,

You say you are motivated by "SEO" concerns. SEO is a dynamic field, 
with "rules" changing frequently but more importantly the rules are 
applied differently in different situations. Certain markets (certain 
search keywords and phrases) are handled by search engines differently 
than others. So when one thing seems "better for SEO" it might only be 
better for that particular situation... not in general. Often the rules 
follow competitiveness, with more competitive search markets getting the 
most restrictions.

To my knowledge and in my experience is is not better to have /contact 
than to have /contact/index.php. Google considers those two forms of URL 
the same and has published that their algo is careful with /file and 
/file.ext and /file/index.ext, so that they can be sure they have the 
right "canonicalization" or root paths to the resource. They have a 
strong desire to eliminate duplicate routes to the same data in the 
search index because they don't want to index /contact as a resource, 
and also an identical /contact/index.php as a second resource showing 
the same content. .

And of course, thinking competitively, that is precisely why I think 
it's best to have /contact/index.html. By presenting a clean, 
no-monkey-business URL structure, you may avoid the extra scrutiny (and 
all possible consequences of caution that may ensue if flags are 
triggered). Of course I would and use important and relevant keywords in 
the URL path, and usually I use a Front Controller and/or mod rewrite 
solution to actually deliver the URLs and web pages. But I keep the URLs 
as "standard" as possible.

It is commonly observed that if you leave duplicate paths to the same 
resources, and Google doesn't properly detect it, you may suffer 
filtering such that one path gets included and others get filtered out. 
You may not exercise clean control over which one they keep, so if they 
keep "A"  and you have tons of quality incoming back links to"B" which 
Google chose to filter out,  you suffer. Certain very competitive SEOs 
may notice that you have left a duplicate path to a popular resource in 
place on your site, and link to it from a high page rank page in hope of 
getting the "other way in"  indexed and ranked ahead of the more popular 
route. I'm not saying it works, but if you also have a mistake that 
causes a blip in the indexing and inclusion of your site, it can work as 
a competitive tactic to get your resource removed or demoted.

This idea of maintaining unique routes within your site is known as 
"strict URLs" -- no two URLs go to the same exact content. When you use 
a front controller, it becomes important (difficult?) to ensure strict 
URLs because of the default behavior of Apache and all the possible 
incoming URLs.  So if you want to deploy a PHP front controller for 
example, then plan your URL structure so that you properly redirect or 
404 all routes except the one you intend to use as the strict URL to the 
resource.

If you have a controller called "contact" and a method called 
"contact_us" then your URL is /contact/contact_us/ but you need to be 
sure that you also trap /contact/contact_us and 301 redirect it to 
/contact/contact_us/ if apache doesn't do it (and Apache won't do it if 
there is no actual folder in place on the web server). You also need to 
make sure your controller is "strict" so it doesn't accept 
/contact/whatever without throwing a 404 error (which apache wouldn't 
have done, because it passed everything to the front controller as a 
valid resource locator).

With frameworks, I think it's the same old rules applied to a new, more 
complex yet elegant solution for web app development. Before it was 
really hard to manage everything. Now we have some great tools (like 
frameworks) for managing everything, but out of the box they seem to 
default to the same old behaviors and so, need optimizing.

Of course your situation may be different than my experience.

Seems like you are probably using relative paths to link to those  
resources...

like url(pc_app_logo.png) vs an absolute path (/pc_release/ 
pc_app_logo.png)

So those requests are going to http://192.168.1.102/pc_release/ 
index.php/style.css, http://192.168.1.102/pc_release/index.php/ 
favicon.ico, etc...

That's the one minor inconvenience with using these types of  
'friendly' urls.

I was messing around with it and it seems the only way to get it to  
work without causing a circular redirect is to put your php code in a  
file named contact (without the .php) and get apache to process that  
with php -- I forget how to do this but seem to remember someone  
posting it on the list last summer.  Then you can have almost the  
opposite rule of what you currently have:
RewriteRule ^contact.php$ /contact [R]

i suppose a simpler answer, though possibly not the one you want,
might be to rename contact.php to something like contacts.php or
contactpage.php

so your redirect will point contact.php -> /contact/
and your rewrite will point /contact/ -> contactpage.php

Let's say you use a friendly url (furl) system so that a url looks like 
this:

www.example.com/furl/parm/value/parm/value

Because we are faking a nesting of folders and files here, will a search 
bot expect to be able to find:

www.example.com/furl/parm/index.html?

and

www.example.com/furl/parm/value/index.html?

I have not seen any mention of this by search engines (or their human 
representatives).

I don't think you are "faking" anything, though. It's a valid web 
resource, right? Who said it had to represent files and folders?

Lately it seems that they do some poking around when you do this:

www.example.com/furl/parm/value/parm/value

to try and determine the best way to grab that resource (slash or no 
slash) but the name is just "value".   Google has said it uses your own 
internal linking styles as clue for your site, and also how others link 
to you.

A quick check of Google shows this page ranking well:
http://www.phpwact.org/pattern/model_view_controller
with  this snippet:


    Model View *Controller* [Web Application Component Toolkit]
    <http://www.phpwact.org/pattern/model_view_controller>

Application *Controller* Controls the flow of logic of a single 
application. Because the popular MVC framework Java Struts from a *PHP* 
Perspective implements a *...*

- Similar pages 
</search?hl=en&q=related:www.phpwact.org/pattern/model_view_controller>


A hit to a trailing-slash-added version  gives a 200ok but emptyish 
template page, BUT it is in the Google index with this snippet:


    Model View Controller [Web Application Component Toolkit]
    <http://www.phpwact.org/pattern/model_view_controller>

You are here: Web Application Component Toolkit ? pattern ? Model View 
Controller. Table of Contents. Model View Controller. Model. Passive

- Similar pages 
</search?hl=en&q=related:www.phpwact.org/pattern/model_view_controller>


Notice that Google lists that trailing slash page with a URL that has no 
trailing slash. That looks like a double listing of the 
no-trailing-slash URL, with two snippets.

The contrived resource (with index.html) does the same (200ok but empty 
template page): 
http://www.phpwact.org/pattern/model_view_controller/index.php

A search of Google for that contrived page 
http://www.phpwact.org/pattern/model_view_controller/index.php shows "no 
such page".

So? Google says slash and no trailing slash are the same resource as no 
trailing slash, but represents the two as different content in the index 
(which they are). That suggests that Google is confused about that 
resource. A scan of the rest of that results set shows some URLs have 
trailing slashes, some do not : 
http://www.google.com/search?q=php+controller&hl=en&start=10&sa=N

What happens if I put a page on my site and 302 redirect to those pages? 
Will Google take their content and index it as belonging to my site? 
What if I put content at that empty template page, which is diferent 
content than the no-trailing-slash URL. Will Google still list both 
pages as going to the no-trailing-slash URL? If one page is on red 
widgets and the other on reen baboons, will it effect relevance ranking 
of either page?  That's for SEO homework.

Message-ID: <20070320183246.43a89a94.mba2000@ioplex.com>

Hi All,

I have just released a PHP extension that should interest people using
Linux in a corporate environment. I hope you don't mind the proprietary
plug here but it is Free (as in beer) for up to 25 users. If you remember
me from the PHP conference this release is MUCH more advanced over what
we were pitching last year.

Basically the extension adds everything one would need to integrate
Linux IntrAnet sites into Windows-centric networks (i.e. large corporate
networks).

The following is a high level outline and description of Plexcel's
features.

    * Active Directory Single Sign-On (SSO)
    * Explicit Logon with a Username and Password
    * Full Delegation Support
    * Authentication from Web Tier to other Servers
    * Add, modify and delete users, groups and group members
    * Advanced LDAP API
          o Access accounts with wide variety of names
          o Easy binding strings w/o hostnames or base DNs
          o RFC 2255 style LDAP URLs
          o Create, modify and delete objects
          o Attribute intelligence
          o Automatic attribute conversions
    * Fast Script-Level Access Control and ACLs
    * Password Setting
    * Directory Location Services
    * Easy Installation - No setup on Windows side required
    * I18N - All functions are fully internationalized
    * Generate service keytab files
    * Highly compatible with Microsoft products

Some of these features you can piece together using existing products
like mod_auth_kerb and PHP's LDAP API but this is trivial to use by
comparison and it has a number of things that you can't do like setting
passwords, script level access control, looking up accounts with names
like 'NYC\Managers' instead of long DNs and much more. It's easier to
use Plexcel than it is VBScript.

Anyway, if you're interested, we're trying to get people to try the
beta. This was just released last night so I have no feedback yet but
you can grab it here (no registration required):

  http://www.ioplex.com/

Also, I'm 50 minutes from WTC Station or Penn so locals will get four
star support for peanuts.

I'm pretty sure I'll be at the LUG meeting tomorrow too if you have
any questions.

Thanks,
Mike

It is for *nix although at the moment we only have binaries for 32
bit / x86 / Linux. We could do AIX or x64 or Solaris or whatever but
currently there's some confusion as to how best to compile and test libs
for other systems.

Well currently it *only* works in an AD environment. At some point
we may sit down and try to figure out how to parameterize all of the
possible differences in LDAP schemas, how to query for groups, how to
abstract the concept of a Windows SID, etc but right now we are focused
on AD since that is almost exclusively what the Megacorps are using.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP + UTF-8 + mb_string issue.
Message-ID: <200703211050.26510.arzala@gmail.com>

Hello Everybody,

While building a truly multilingual project, I am running into an interesting 
problem with php5 + utf-8 + mb_string. Please study below table carefully. I 
have taken 1 word in 3 different languages English, Finnish (of Finland 
country) and Gujarati (of India country) to test PHP's Unicode character set 
handling with single and multibyte strings using mb_string extension.

Word appearing on left of "=" sign is actual string whose length is to be 
counted. What I have tried here is to count length of word in each language. 
For English and Finnish I have got correct results but for Gujarati language 
it seems that mb_string(?) is not working properly.

=======================================================
zala = 1 word; 4 bytes; 4 characters (z, a, l, a); 4 key-strokes (z, a, l, a); 
"strlen" should be 4 and is 4 also.

z?l? = 1 word; 4 bytes; 4 characters (z, ?, l, ?); 4 key-strokes (z, ?, l, ?); 
"strlen" should be 4 and is 4 also.

????  = 1 word; 4 bytes; 2 characters (??, ??); 4 key-strokes (?, ?, ?, ?); 
"strlen" should be 2 but is 4.
=======================================================

Question is why PHP is not able to count length of given string in practical 
way. I am aware that current PHP versions are not aware of string, instead 
they just deal with bytes. In that case output is correct but this is not 
practical solution as length of word in Gujarati language is only "2" (In 
Indic languages, we have primary characters like "?" and secondary characters 
like "?", but there is not value of secondary characters without primary 
characters) and not "4" even if it requires 4 bytes to store data.

I am sure that I am not missing any settings to be done at server, php or at 
client level to work this correctly. English and Finnish languages are 
different languages but they are part of same character set (i.e Latin) and 
their glyph is also same, while Gujarati language has different character set 
and it's glyph is also different. But this should not create this problem if 
"mb_string" is capable to handle strings in proper way.

Thanks,

Anirudh Zala

Generally the libc-like functions exhibit libc behavior so 4 is the
correct answer.

Is mb_strlen not suitable for some reason? You have to use mb_* functions
whenever you perform character-wise operations as opposed to byte-wise
(and that assumes you're running in the UTF-8 locale).

I am using mb_* functions and UTF-8 as locale. Everything is transparently
processed in UTF-8 format only. I have tested same thing using "iconv"
extension but same results. Looks like it is the behavior of php + mb_*.

It is because length of string should "2" in actual way when it is used in
communication, writing, speaking etc. But PHP needs 4 bytes to store it hence
giving length as "4". As I told in original mail that Indic languages have
primary (like ?, ?) and secondary characters (like ?) to create different
meaning but secondary characters should not be counted while calculating
length of word (even if it requires additional byte to store). This is the
issue.

It's my understanding that the mbstring extension doesn't actually replace
php functions.  If you're using the extension, you'll have to use the
mb_string functions, (mb_strlen in this case).

function utf8_strlen($string){
  return strlen(utf8_decode($string));

I hope that works for you.

It does if you set directive "mbstring.func_overload=7" in php.ini or in 
server configuration file.

I throughout use UTF-8 encoding in input, processing, storing, output data 
hence data is already in UTF-8 format.

I have found that it is UTF-8 encoding that it is not properly supporting 
Indic languages as it has been designed so. My tested word requires 4 bytes 
to store in UTF-8 encoding hence in that way php + mbstring works properly. 
So I have concluded that it is not anymore php and/or mbstring issue as it 
happens same when I try to calculate length using SQL or using any other 
scripting language.

In Indic languages, there are separate alphabats for vowels and consonants. 
There is grammatical rule that when any vowel is used alone then count it's 
length as 1 but when it is used along with any consonant then count only 
consonant. That is how languages are used in communication, writing, reading 
etc. But while accommodating characters in UTF-8 encoding, developers either 
thought in different way or they have been told to do so.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [WAY OT] Windoze to Windows Vista Ultimate 
Message-ID: <002301c76c90$333748a0$99a5d9e0$@com>

I thought this could be helpful for busy people who could use this
little mojo that includes 

some info for those of you that may need to do Vista at some point
probably for business purposes. 

This may save you some time and reduce your googling and reading around.

 

This covers an Windows Ultimate Upgrade from Win XP SP2. 

Older Win will not upgrade to Ultimate. 

 

Why Vista Ultimate? 

Because this is the only Vista version that has Remote Connections,
Networking, Hard Drive encryption, 

and the Media Center with CD/DVD rip and burn capability and new Aero
look built in and 

you will likely need all these features. 

 

1) Download and Use the Win Vista Upgrade Advisor

It does a valid job of isolating your hardware and software
incompatibilities.

 

2) Issues to Address in Advance While you are still in Win XP

a) Update your BIOS, some drivers, and maybe patch some software. 

(Other software you will update after Vista upgrade.) 

b) Norton and Windows Firewall Incompatibility Issue is solved. Norton
now has 2007 Vista-ready versions 

for download on their web site. Upgrade Norton before Windows. 

 

3) Backup Data as Needed

 

4) Run the Vista Upgrade. Takes several hours.

 

Total time, steps 1 - 4 above. Approx. 12 hours spread over two weekend
days.

 

 

Potential Vista Pitfalls to Note

 

1) Outlook Legacy Passwords Issue

Outlook versions older than the most recent Outlook 2007, lose all email
account passwords every time 

you close Outlook. New Vista security schema pre empts the old Outlook
saving method and breaks it.

You will likely need, at least, to upgrade to Outlook 2007.

 

2) Outlook 2007 Install Issue

On original install, Outlook 2007 from store bought DVD failed with dll
not found error. Rerun Outlook install 

in Repair mode to get to success. All your Contacts, Calendar, Emails,
Accounts and even Rules are preserved. 

New interface, one box search and Email/Calendar/Task unification are
snazzy enough and actually helpful.

 

3) Radeon Display Drivers

Radeon has new Catalyst 7.2 driver set and Control Panel only on their
web site for download. 

All other older version will likely muck up strangely.

Even the new Catalyst 7,2 for Vista forgets position of dual monitor
configuration with every reboot.

This will be corrected in Catalyst 7.3

 

4) Some Notable Remarks 

The entire interface is very DHTML and AJAX-like. So many tool tips,
popups, rollovers, pulldowns, right-clicks, sort options, 

layers swapping, shadows and semi-transparency effects  that are meant
to assist in navigation and menu selection. It could bother you.

 

There are a lot of new naming conventions, new locations of familiar
tools and so many new ideas that you will 

need at least 3 hours (and probably at least one ref book) to get it all
in and be situated. 

 

A new visual menu interface called the Ribbons toolbars system replaces
all regular File Save/Print menu systems that 

you used to know and this may also jolt you at first. 

 

The new Windows Explorer file management, navigation/sorting and the
one-box universal Search features are tasty. All 

a little weird at first, but genuinely more flexible. If you move around
a lot, all day, working on a lot of separate items, in the 

long run Vista will help you. 

 

You can apply your own Meta data to anything (files, images, folders,
emails) and then do single Search to find all in 

one result set. And sort results in Windows Explorer by meta, author,
date, recent usage and save these views/searches. 

 

New Picture Gallery tool, grabs your incoming digital media, allows you
to do custom renaming and apply custom meta 

(singularly, in bulk or you can standardize your transfer style). Images
and all media can be infinitely sorted, categorized 

and viewed especially by meta. 

 

All my major apps came over with no issues: Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and
older Office apps except Outlook. 

 

Pretty much every registry change performed by any app must be approved
by you. This is actually cool. 

 

A lot of stuff that you used to not be able to adjust, turn off, change,
move or regulate, you now can.

 

Warmest regards,

Message-ID: <721f1cc50703220856h1e1a27cl2692672e798d395b@mail.gmail.com>

A couple of naive questions here. I hear PEAR::DB is deprecated in favor of
MDB2. If that's so,

* does that mean we should definitely use MDB2 instead of DB in new projects
that we undertake?

* what is MDB there for?

tell it the datatype of each parameter. If I intend to use MySQL and not
planning to support other backends (except maybe something like SQLite), is
there any reason not to lie to it and say that everything is 'text'?  My
motivation is Laziness, shorter code, less hard-coded SQL, e.g.:

     $db->autoExecute($this->table, $this->data, DB_AUTOQUERY_UPDATE, $where
);

* Suppose you like the PEAR::Auth module. It supports DB but not its
successors. Write your own storage container that wraps MDB2? Is it worth
it?

It's the webserver that is configured to look for default-index files, 
such as index.html, and not search engines.  Search engines only attempt 
to access valid resources, such as the "fake" resource you mentioned 
(which is quite valid and not fake at all).

I would use MDB2 over DB personally, or switch to PDO.

It was the version before MDB2, and is obsolete.

Laziness is a great motivator in many cases; this is quite possibly the

Well if you like PEAR::Auth and plan to switch to MDB2, then it would 
likely be worth it I suppose.

I just took a look at http://pear.php.net/package/Auth and it looks to 
be claiming functionality with MDB2, are you sure you are looking at the 
latest version of the Auth package?

Thanks for the input. I got nothing against prepared queries at all. I was
simply thinking it's nice not to have to examine every key=>value pair in
the $this->data of my example, and figure out the data type of each value.
And since MySQL lets you quote numeric data types....

I got spoiled by my old friend DB's autoExecute()

Arg, shame on me! I should have read the docs (AGAIN) before speaking up.


Meanwhile, I *think* I have discovered that the mysqli driver does not
really support unbuffered queries, which I need sometimes. I tried it and my
script just quit without a word of explanation; I disabled it and it ran
fine. Maybe I oughta write those parts with the mysqli_XXX API

(Top-posting requires top-posting... sorry Michael.)

Yes, technically correct -- it is the webserver. BUT, to the traditional 
search engine, the URL defines the resource. Every unique URL is 
potentially a unique resource, and ideally they are all tested and 
included in the index if unique.

As webmaster, in the eyes of the indexing search spider, you have 
defined your "site" by the URL structure you used to define the 
resources, and not by the content (regardless of how that content is 
served... by the web server or your PHP scripts). So it becomes 
important to control the URL even more carefully than the content in 
many cases.

This is now changing, as we move away from URL as defining name/label 
(ajax, etc). If semantic web were more advanced, it might work, but for 
now, it's a good thing we only have one search engine because its 
behavior is slowly becoming less standardized and more customized over 
time (that was sarcasm.... a little).

John:

You are correct in saying that the URL defines the resource, and the 
"permanence" (I use that loosely) is quite important really.  The way I 
translated the question was more or less along the lines of, "say I have 
this resource, which looks like a folder, is it going to look for an 
index.html file?"

In the case of my answer, no.  The search engines are not going to try 
to guess the default resource to go to in the event of something that 
appears to be a folder.  They merely go where they're told, and they 
follow (usually) a number of rules along the way.

Now then, as I understand it (please correct me if I'm wrong, John... as 
I'm actually curious), if you move a resource to a new location, you 
should provide the proper headers to do so (I believe 302 for 
permanently moved, but I don't use it enough to know off the top of my 
head), than most intelligent search engines are aware of the change.  
Moving resources should be fairly painless, in that regard.

As far as AJAX is concerned, that's a touchy subject with me.  I try to 
make sure that anything I'm serving via AJAX is more-or-less personal to 
the person requesting it, say a message list or friends list or 
something, directly related to the person.  There's always elegant 
fallbacks, and what I tend to use AJAX for (I am using AJAX as a synonym 
of a XMLHttpRequest object, as opposed to anything else which would be 
correct) is personal data related to the user currently logged in that 
isn't important to be indexed.


I intended to write a bit more, I have to deal with some other issues I 
wasn't expecting so I'll leave it at that :(

Recent comments suggest that Google does some figuring for "canonical" 
urls, although it's not clear if they do it on a regular basis or only 
when they have reasons to look closely. They have said they use clues to 
help guide them, including how you set up internal links and how others 
link to your resources.

A 301 is used for a permanent redirect, and a 302 is supposed to be OK 
for an internal redirect now although I still think Google screws up 
interpretation of 302s too often. A 302 is a bad choice for a 
cross-domain redirect, as it has been so widely abused in the past 
search engines hesitate to trust them.

Yes, that was my meaning.

This has suggested itself to me as well -- AJAX after you're logged in, 
or at very least elegant fallback for the public links.

I may be missing it, but I don't see anything there that makes me feel
warm and fuzzy about Vista.

Sure there were fewer overall vulnerabilities found over the reported
period, but look at the number of high priority vulnerabilities found,
12 for windows vs 2 for redhat and 1 for osx...

I just wanted to clarify that this topic I introduced to this list was not to act as a poli/techno endorsement of MSFT or their products. 

Me, I know I will come across Vista with clients in the near term future. I like to be ahead of the curve on every tech topic I can when I sit at the conference table with clients. And having hands on usability experience with Vista ahead of my clients was strategically important to me. 

So since I had already gone and set part of my own house on fire, I figured I'd just throw a little breadcrumb trail out there from behind the curtain of flames for the other few who just might have to do as I did. 

I did not want to introduce tech evaluations of one product vs another product. 

What do they say: 
Know thy enemy. 
Keep your enemies closer than your friends. 
Know the con to avoid the con.

Hi Joseph,

it is the problem of using list(..) = each
Each - Return the current key and value pair from an array and advance the
array cursor

So your list($lat,$lng) = each($coords) will assign $lat = 0 and $lng =
($lat you passed), creating the weird output. Changing the function to as
shown below should clear your woes.


function nextCoord($coords, $usedCoords)
{
    $lat = (float)$coords[0];
    $lng = (float)$coords[1];


    if(in_array($lat.':'.$lng, $usedCoords))
    {
        $lat += 0.0005;
        $lng += 0.0005;
        return nextCoord(array($lat, $lng), $usedCoords );
    }
    $array = array($lat, $lng);
    print_r($array); // disable this after debug
    // return $array; // enable this after debug
}

The correct approach to this, in my opinion, is to create an
application proxy -- a script that will parse incoming request for uri
MayEvent07, convert it into $_GET['eventid'] = 4e...7 using a db
lookup, and then include() the software package's index.php, using an
output buffer so that the urls in the software package's response can
all be converted back to your friendly format.

In other words, build a php wrapper around your software package. Done
right, it won't know the difference, and you don't have to muck around
with httpd.conf.

Would this work?

$html = str_replace( '&quot;', '"', $html );

If not, please restate the question, as it sounds like all you want to
do is decode &quot;, which is a little strange. An example would be a
good idea.

Hello again,

This is a pretty good idea ...

Once they click the link that brings them to the page, they only stay for 
one action (to RSVP to an event)
so I don't care what the URL looks like once they are on the page ... its 
getting to the page I want to make
easier ... as in /eventMay VS /eventid=sweet_md5hash ... hopefully this will 
be less prone to error and users
will notice when something is spelled wrong in the URL .. vs's the hash ...

To be honest .. I dont see how users keep messing this up ... all they have 
to do is a click a link to bring them
to the page... but they manage to fudge it at least once a day (error logs 
mailed to myself)

Well, I'll think about it all a bit more before I implement anything .. but 
I like the proxy idea, i can leave my current
db as is for the RSVP page (minus the lookup for eventMay and the new table 
to map eventid to names).

Thanks,

- Ben

Message-ID: <1b3d2fde0703260728k4c99bf42i31ac94346b544367@mail.gmail.com>

Hello


I have to read large CSV file upto 10 MB size. I tried to read each line by
using getcsv() method, but cannot worthy. I have to make some checking the
contents of the CSV files such as any duplicate row, or any row missing
contents etc.

Can anybody suggests a method to read large file of CSV files ?

You could always put the csv contents on a multi-dimensional array as 
you are reading each line.
When you read the line, you check to see if all the data is complete, 
then you check against the array for duplicates, if it passes both 
tests, then you enter the new line into the array.

I don't know how efficient this is with a 10MB file, but I'd say it's 
worth a try.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Creating database tables when deploying products
Message-ID: <01b001c76fb4$bef4f730$6a01a8c0@gamebox>

Hello, 

When creating software, I inherited a method from my previous company of creating a file, 'createdb.php' that includes
the instructions to create all the database tables and populate them w/default values.

When deploying, I run the script first and all is setup.

I've included two different segments from files that I've used to create tables: 
The first is an older procedural method, the second is newer OOP code.

...
...
...
/* create admin table if it does not exist */
    if ( @ !$tableSet[constAdminStr] )
    {
        error_log("createdb.php: creating 'hhc.admin' table");
        $sqlStr = "CREATE TABLE admin "
                . " (id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,"
                . " username varchar(64) default '',"
                . " password varchar(64) default '',"
                . " last_login int(12)   default 0,"
                . " primary key(id, username)"
                . ')';
        DBAS_MySQLQuery($sqlStr, $db);

        /* password: test */
        $userStr = constUserName;
        $md5Pass = md5(constUserPass);
        error_log("createdb: creating admin account '$userStr'");
        $sqlStr = "INSERT INTO admin "
                . " SET "
                . " username='$userStr',"
                . " password='$md5Pass'";
        DBAS_MySQLQuery($sqlStr, $db);
    }
...
...
...
function PRNK_CreateDatabaseTables($dbObject)
    {
        $debug = 1;
        $defE = constDatabaseDefaultEmpty;
        
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateTable(constDatabaseTableAdmin);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("id", "int(11)", "NOT NULL",
                                       "auto_increment");      
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("username", "varchar(64)", $defE);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("password", "varchar(64)", $defE);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("primary", "key(id, username)");
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateCommit($debug);
        
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateTable(constDatabaseTableIdea);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("idea_id", "int(11)", "NOT NULL",
                                       "auto_increment");
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("email",   "varchar(64)",   $defE);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("phone",   "varchar(64)",   $defE);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("content", "varchar(2048)", $defE);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("votes",   "int(11)", "default 0");
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("time",    "int(11)", "default 0");
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("primary", "key(idea_id)");
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateCommit($debug);
        
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateTable(constDatabaseTableVote);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("vote_id", "int(11)", "NOT NULL",
                                       "auto_increment");
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("idea_id", "int(11)", "default 0");
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("email",   "varchar(64)", $defE);
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateField("primary", "key(vote_id)");
        $dbObject->DatabaseCreateCommit($debug);
    }
...
...
...
So my question is ... is what I'm doing ok? .. there must be a better way to do it ... How are you all
doing database table creation for products that need to be deployed on multiple systems.?

Thanks!

Hello

I tried this method.

When we read large file, CGI timeout will occur. So cannot read large files
of length 10 MB or more. Can someone suggest any other method?

What about extending the time limit for the script?  I have a script that
processes a 7 MB file and make a call to set_time_limit () at the beginning.

The trick to parsing large files is to completely process and then discard
each line one at a time. Hopefully the memory for strings that have been
processed will be collected although I'm not technically sure that will
be true. You might want to run a simple test to read and discard lines
from a file that is much bigger than the memory limit.

If the CSV interface you're using right now doesn't support that model
then you'll have to write your own CSV parser. The below code is one
that I wrote in C but fortunately PHP is very much like C, it shouldn't
be too hard to translate it. It's used in production environments by
major software products, free and otherwise. If you do translate to PHP,
perhaps you can post it back on the list.

Note that this code looks complicated but it's actually one of the
smallest CSV parsers you'll find and it's a lot more correct than just
about anything you'll find. Parsing quotes and quotes within quotes
is non-trivial.

Obviously you'll need to change the sinput parameter to a file or some
kind of stream source and return an array instead of the user providing
a buffer.

This is an interesting technique. I like the fact that it could  
easily be wrapped around an existing site without messing around with  
mod_rewrite. But the idea of modifying URLs in the buffered output  
has always seemed a little sketchy to me. I'm imaging some sort of  
regex replace, right? What about urls that are constructed  
dynamically in javascript? And I feel there must be other holes. Is  
there a way this can be done reliably, or am I just being paranoid?

Actually you would either redesign the package, such that you wont mess up
with
htaccess, mod_rewrite or any such sort of plugs, or use some kind of
internal plugs
which will always be a headache.

I was involved in a project where the web server was really a modest one
with
256MB ram and a pIII 800 processor yet, had a very huge database, but the
basic
thing is that the data seldom changes, ie, there may be additions, but
modifications
are not that frequent.

We had the folowing htaccess

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^projects/(.*)\.html projects.php?g=$1 [L]

we also had a projects folder which was writable by the webserver process.
now
the php script would get the $_GET['g'], which could be parsed to identify
which
section of the projects was being referred to, and the database content
would be
merged with the static and layout template, and finally the whole html page
is built
into one single varaible, which is written to 'projects/' . $_GET['g'] .
'.html', as well
as echoed.  So in a second request, the file will be fetched from the file
system.

Whenever the content in a particular section is modified, we just unlink the
related
html file, which will get generated in the first subsequent request.

The point which I wanted to emphasise is that you should consider redoing
the whole
package with the furl in mind, and you will start seeing that you will no
longer require
any plugs.

Guys,

The company I am working for wants to have a single signon for multiple
sites that will be on different domains.  I know that you cannot use a
cookie accross domains.  Is there a way to do this
aside from passing a hash via querystring or POST form?

The reason I ask is because we cannot always rely on the hash being
present.  What if the user is at one domain then types in the other domain.
We would want them to remain logged into the system because it is a network.
I know it is possible just look at Google.com and Gmail.com.

Any Ideas?  Everything i read seems really insecure and ends with passing a
querystring in your links.

Thanks,

Dear Shadab,

When I do a google search for "+agloco +scam" I get 159,000 results, 
which is approximately 1/5th of the results you are getting.

No thanks.

(All fun aside what's with the spam lately guys?)

Have a DB or filestructure(write a temp file) that stores the login info with particular authenticating information. Then whenever they move from one domain to another the Database is accessed and the login persisted.

right but how will i know that it is the same user without being able to
store a hash in a cookie etc.

I know i can store the data for the user but associating the user with that
data again could be tough

How do you know the session that moved from one domain to the other is 
the same session? IP address?

(By the way, I know an IP address *won't* work, it was a theoretical 
question.)

I've had this same problem before and I'm curious to see how others have 
solved it.

You cannot rely on the IP Address.  Think about AOL, they use a proxy server
and the users IP can change without a reboot of the modem.
Also think about a computer lab that is on 1 IP address.

Hello yall, 


I decided to just do the wrapper because it was quick and painless...

Here's a snippet from the new event.php file.

------------------------------------------------

/* This is our wannabe mod_rewrite hack
   The REQUEST_URI comes in as /pc_release/event.php/myEvent
   we only want the myEvent value.
*/
$eventNameStr = strrchr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], "/");
$eventNameStr = substr($eventNameStr, 1, strlen($eventNameStr));

DBAS_InitDBHandle(HHCE_SQLInfo( ), 'HHCE.php', $db);

$tName = constEventLookupStr;
$sqlStr = "SELECT event_id FROM $tName WHERE event_name = '$eventNameStr'";
DBAS_MySQLReturnOne($eventSet, $sqlStr, $db);
$eventId = $eventSet['event_id'];

$host = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . "/pc_release/index.php?act=700&eventid="
      . $eventId; 

/* REDIRECT */
header("Location: http://$host");

------------------------------------------------
/event.php/MyEvent =(redirects to)> /index.php?act=....

Works fine and I only had to make minimal changes to my existing code.

Thanks for all the great ideas everyone!

- Ben

    regex replace, right? What about urls that are constructed
    dynamically in javascript? And I feel there must be other holes. Is 
    there a way this can be done reliably, or am I just being paranoid?



  Actually you would either redesign the package, such that you wont mess up with 
  htaccess, mod_rewrite or any such sort of plugs, or use some kind of internal plugs 
  which will always be a headache.

  I was involved in a project where the web server was really a modest one with 
  256MB ram and a pIII 800 processor yet, had a very huge database, but the basic
  thing is that the data seldom changes, ie, there may be additions, but modifications 
  are not that frequent.  

  We had the folowing htaccess

  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^projects/(.*)\.html projects.php?g=$1 [L]

  we also had a projects folder which was writable by the webserver process. now 
  the php script would get the $_GET['g'], which could be parsed to identify which
  section of the projects was being referred to, and the database content would be
  merged with the static and layout template, and finally the whole html page is built 
  into one single varaible, which is written to 'projects/' . $_GET['g'] . '.html', as well
  as echoed.  So in a second request, the file will be fetched from the file system.

  Whenever the content in a particular section is modified, we just unlink the related 
  html file, which will get generated in the first subsequent request.

  The point which I wanted to emphasise is that you should consider redoing the whole
  package with the furl in mind, and you will start seeing that you will no longer require 
  any plugs.

getcsv() is the way to go.  As you read each line, check it for sanity 
then run an insert or update query.  The query can be designed to 
gracefully handle duplicates.

Can you flag the user?s database record when they log in. Then add a
database query to each restricted page on each domain to look at your new
?logged in? field for true. If you don?t want to trust the user to click a
log out button to unflag the record, you could set a cron to clear the flag
every hour.

There are also quite a few results for ?php sessions over multiple domains?
on Google!

The way I see it you can divide this into two problems:

1. You need somewhere to store the login state that all participants
   have access to.

2. You need some way to determine the client's identity to lookup the
   login state.

For example, you could use a central server to store the state and
a cookie to determine the identity. When the user logs into domain A
their logon state is updated in the central server and their username
is stored in a cookie. Then when they go to domain B the username is
retrieved from the cookie (assuming they have previously visited the site)
and used to lookup their state in the central server.

Note that to make this method secure you would need to mcrypt the
cookie and traffic with the central server with a secret shared by all
participating servers.

There are no doubt other permutations of this but I think all would need
to satisfy the two problems regarding where to store the state and how
to determine the identity.

I am guessing this talk of a central server is a central domain like
erenetwork.com
which would hold all the session data in the database.  Whenever someone
accesse say domainA.com it would redirect to erenetwork.com, get the session
data then redirect to domainA. with the session id in the header or
something is that correct?

Basically yes. If you don't want to (or can't) have the client carry
some state with it, then you're pretty much locked into using a central
database to store cross site session data. There's just no other way
for site B to know that the user authenticated successfully with site
A without site A and site B sharing data.

As for the redirects, that's up to you. Personally I think I would rather
have the server issue a secondary HTTP request to erenetwork.com. The
only problem with that is that you don't know who's session data to
ask for. That's why I was thinking you could use a cookie to store the
client's identity. The first time they visit each site they will have to
logon separately. That's ugly but they would only do that once until the
cookie got deleted or expired. Once their identity is set in the cookie
you have the means to ask erenetwork.com for the session state for that
user every time they visit that particular site.

Of course you can't just store a username in the cookie since a cookie
can easily be forged. You would have to encrypt something that uniquely
identified the user. When they a site you decrypt the cookie and use the
unique identifier to query erenetwork.com for the session state. If the
state is not present or indicates the user is not logged in, then you
reauthenticate them and submit the updated state to erenetwork.com. Then
when the client goes to another site, the same thing happends but this
time the session state indicates they are already logged in and thus
they do not have to log in again.

I had once explored this method, client wanted something like passport
login, used by hotmail.

There were about 30 tlds, and the client needed a single signon, what we did
was to maintain
one single authentication table, and update that with the userdata and a
cookie hash. Each domain
also had a session validator, that just fetched the data from the central
table and stored into the php
sessions, using php http client class.  The user data would be fetched only
if the data is not
existing in the session, and the cookie hash is received.

I would consider using a temporary table, provided we have to finally
address an sql database.
If we could pass LOAD INFILE.. statement to a temp table, and then use sql
queries, that would
be less painful for us, as well as our server, it is my assumption.

We use a more or less the same method, with one difference,  that is the sql
query instead of being embedded, is a seperate setup.sql file with comments
and whitespace stripped off.  Means, each complete statement is in one line.
The script issues a source setup.sql to the mysql after connecting to the
database.

If you are deploying databases across multiple systems on a regular 
basis (ie: planning on doing it more than once or twice) I recommend you 
look into the PHP version of Ant called Phing.

Hello all,

Brian - Looks cool, but seems like I need CL access to the host ..which I 
often do not have.
I'll look into it more.

Jiju - So you use an .sql file w/the instructions to build the table. Do you 
execute from CL, PHP or
phpMyAdmin. As stated above, I often do not have CL access to a host.

Thanks for your suggestions.

- Ben

We use it from php, with a "source setup.sql" statement thrown in from the
script.

It seems to work sometimes and not at other times. My (unhappy) client

Have you tried sending the headers and body separately? 

mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers); 

I've never seen anyone do it your way before

> $headers .= "MIME-Version: 1.0\n";
> $headers .= "Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\n\n";
> $headers .= '
>          <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 
> Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

I always send html as part of a multipart message :  

$mime_bound_1 = '__=MIME_BOUND_1=' . md5($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . time());         
$headers .= "MIME-Version: 1.0\n";
$headers .= "Content-type: multipart/alternative; boundary=\"$mime_bound_1\"\n";

and then within your message body each type is delimited by your
$mime_bound_1 ("simpler" content types before more complicated ones): 

$body .= $mime_bound_1 . "\n"; 
$body .= "Content-type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n"; 
$body .= "\n"; 
$body .= $your_text_part; 
$body .= "\n"; 

$body .= $mime_bound_1 . "\n"; 
$body .= "Content-type: text/html; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n"; 
$body .= "\n"; 
$body .= $your_html_part_including_doctype_and_head; 
$body .= "\n"; 

$body .= $mime_bound_1 . "\n"; 


to generate a text part quickly, I do something like this in my mail
class (if only an html part is set) : 

$tmp = tmpfile(); 
fwrite($tmp, $html_part); 
$elinks = (defined('ELINKS_PATH')) ? ELINKS_PATH : 'elinks'; 
$text_part = `$elinks --dump $tmp`; 
fclose($tmp); 

hth, 
Kenneth

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Single sign-on -- one more gotcha
Message-ID: <C23016B4.2BCA%cliff@pinestream.com>

I have been going through the two-application ? two sessions ? single
sign-on issue as well, and just want to point out one more potential gotcha
that hasn?t been covered yet.

If you are integrating multiple applications on one site, any form of
authentication/single sign-in does not address the session duration/expiry
issue. Unless you have one session store or update all relevant sessions,
parts of your application will expire/garbage cleanup at different times,
which could be very confusing to the end user. ?Why am I still logged in
here, but not there...??

As I see it, there only two ways to deal with this:
1. Integrate the sessions
2. A register shutdown function that ?refreshes? the expiry value in all
related sessions.

Hi Ben:

Your oo approach looks nice.  If you want to do something really cross 
platform, check out PEAR's MDB2 package.  Can reverse engineer an existing 
table into an XML syntax.  The XML syntax can then be used to create 
tables in any DMBS.

Hello Dan,

I will give it a look. I'm at the point of having to write the same code to 
handle MSSQL for an upcomming project.
My OOP code is good w/only mySQL.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <a304e2d60703291709o20fa6c8w80ba5cc381ab5602@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

I have QUERYSTRING  that I am passing to another web page
and it contains 'Consideration 534 & 535".  When I GET the variable
I only get 'Consideration 534'

How do I pass the '&'  so that I can read the rest of the variable????

I tried using the following with no luck:
1) htmlentities and html_entity_decode
2) addslashes

I am using php 4.3

Thanks,

Message-ID: <5.6148636341095.16.7732670307159@1.00003074514532>

Have any of you dealt with any source code escrow firms?  A couple of organizations I work with are interested in this subject.

The various interests include putting source code into escrow to be released if:
- Development company fails to finish delivering on agreement;
- Development company stops maintaining software in the future;
- Development company goes bankrupt;
- Developer dies.

I've found the subject interesting myself.  Does anyone have any suggested companies who do source code escrow, or other suggested approaches to handle these concerns?

I've found various companies listed online, but I'm curious to hear about personal experiences (with escrow companies or with other approaches).

Thanks!

- Ken

    Not too bad,  but PHP isn't Java.  you can write multi-line string 
literals.

$sqlStr = "
    CREATE TABLE admin (id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
                username varchar(64) default,
                password varchar(64) default ','
                last_login int(12)   default 0,
                primary key(id, username)
      )";

    More readable,  less painful.  I'm thinking about this stuff too.  
There are lots of people who are addicted to visual tools like the 
"Enterprise Manager" that comes with Microsoft SQL Server.  These have 
their place,  but you really should be writing DDL (CREATE TABLE, etc.) 
if you want consistent results.  Historically,  I've written schema 
files into *.sql files that can be

* cut and pasted into the MS-SQL "Query Analyser",  or
* mysql -uuser -p db_name < load_schema.sql

    The cross database thing is making me think about a different 
answer.  Also lately I've been creating large numbers of repetitive 
tables,  or groups of tables that all have certain columns (timestamps,  
for instance)

    When it comes to cross database,  however,  you ought to think about 
the business goal you're after.  It's pretty silly to support all 20 or 
so relational databases that PHP can connect to.  Most organizations,  
however,  will have a few databases that are reasonable targets:

* Mysql and MS-SQL:  the kind of shop that likes to have it both ways 
with Microsoft and Open Source.  You can ship apps that will keep most 
people happy.
* Mysql and Oracle:  good for the Unix shop which has both 
entrepreneurial projects (install Linux,  start coding) and 'enterprise' 
systems (ask your boss to ask her boss to ask his boss to ask the DBA to 
make you a table)
* Postgresql and MySQL: if you want to please all the open source people 
you meet

    This can be fun.  It can be an easy way to improve the user 
interface of commercial junkware web apps.

     I did a presentation at a conference about a demo system I built 
with an instruction librarian.  With about 200 lines of PHP I was able 
to put a wrapper over a library catalog that created an online 
instruction unit that worked with the real catalog.  It would display 
popover <div>s that would give people instructions.  The app monitored 
their progress -- it would congradulate them if they found what they 
were looking for and offer them help if they made certain common mistakes.

Reinventing the wheel is a waste of time in most circumstances.  When it 
comes to security,  reinventing the wheel is a way to get hacked.

Take a look at some serious systems such as:

Hello Paul,

Excellent points. I'm *shamed* .. as stated, "less painful", heh.

I believe Jiju had mentioned using .sql files as well, its a great idea.
I may try that out on my next project.

Up until taking a recent job, our shop only supported mySQL. That's where
all my experiance lies (besides a few months at a MSSQL shop).

But now we need to support MSSQL, and I just ported my SQL
php 4 libs to OOP PHP 5....(guess I'll write these libs right the first 
time).

I suppose I can use PEAR:DB:SQLwhatever, but I'm intimate
what my SQL code and don't want to give it up.

Anyways, thanks again to all!

- Ben
