Subject: Warning: Page has expired!!
Message-ID: <199.aad8783.2a7a2eec@aol.com>

I wrote an app that has a master config file which contains all the session 
calls. I have writen many php files that have require statements that call 
this master config file.

When ever I hit the back button from any of these pages at any time I get the 
page that tells me the page has expired. I was wondering how I can get around 
this. I would like it to display the last page and all the data that was in 
the text boxes, and so on.  

I do hope I gave enough info

i dont think you can get around this, basically you are getting that message
because the information was posted by a form.

I'm not too sure about this but normally when you hit back on a posted page, it should ask you whether to post the form again. 

Might this have something to do with a  <HTTP-EQUIV="PRAGMA" CONTENT="NO-CACHE"> tag you might have on the page ?

Hi,

You can solve most of the 'page has expired messages' using :

header("Cache-Control: yes-store, yes-cache");
header("Pragma: yes-cache");

on top of page.
Actually this also works for POST method but sometimes I'm getting page expired messages although
I used this header all the time. I've checked that it is not because of browser, it happens
randomly on all versions of IE and Netscape. I guess this weirdness caused by Isp's proxy servers.

One warning, by enabling cacheing to eliminate the browser message you may
be allowing the user
to see invalid data.  The normal reason for disabling all caching is to
force the browser to requery the
server to ensure that the dynamically created page contains the most up to
date data.  Use of the
back button on the browser or use of history in the browser allows pulling a
page out of the browsers
cache, no query is sent to the server.  If the browser sees that a page in
it's cache is expired, you get
that warning which indicates it needs to requery the server.

Hello all..

No solution will work in this problem...As this is POST method of submitting 
data..so headers opr other tricks will work perfectly as u want.

But if you really want that.. while clicking back button of your 
browser..user would not get "Web page expired" message then do 1 thing..

When page loads..first..generate a random hash key..in very begining of 
script...and store in db.. now pass that key value as hidden varible when u 
submit that form.. Now again get that key from db just where your submit 
even starts..and match that db key value with your hidden variable key.. 
means that form is submitted properly bcoz u have propr match (hidden var 
key is in db too) ..Now when submit event ends and u r going to pass 
header(means direcing page to other page)..just before it delete that key 
from db..so now your whole page event is over..

when user tries to hit back button of your browser..means submit event..will 
be called as we know.but there u have written query of that selection key 
and as u know user will not get..that perfect match between what is still in 
cache and what is in your hidden var

Now bingo u can do whatever when u don't found..this 
match.means..redirecting to same page or other page..with message like "No 
dual submission is allowed"

This methid is extrmely useful when u r submiting imp data which must not be 
submitted more than once per page loading..

It's been my experience that usually it is better to not expect the
browsers back and forward buttons to work. It's good to try to handle them
gracefully but if your app is going to try going back to another page as
part of it's design you really should include links to take the user
there. :)


Don't dream it. Be it.

Hello and ATTENTION!!!!!!

As far as I remember, the GET method is limited in terms of total bytes that
you may send to the server, or the length of data (I think Query_String was
the name of env. var. which returns GET data) that it will send should be
configured on the server and script side. But POST method has no such
limitation. At least that was the case when I was coding with PERL a couple
of years ago. So please make sure that it really works with large amounts of
data (like files) before using it. Unfortunately, I really don't have time
to test it with PHP (but I think it will be the same thing).  Whoever tests
it, could you please let me and other people know about your experiments and
experience.

FYI

unfortantly, 

The normal user has been trained to hit the back button to see the previous 
page. There is nothing I can do to change that. I do not want to put any java 
script in my app to hide the back button. Even for myself I still hit the 
back button to get to the previous page. I also placced links to move forward 
and backwards through out the site.

Someone posted a message awhile ago that included the URL of a site that 
shows a graph of job openings from dice.com.  Unfortunately, I didn't save 
the message.  Can someone tell me the URL?

I remember that the message wondered about why the number of job listing 
keyword matches for PHP is so much smaller than for other programming 
languages and included a lament that he was writing poetry instead of code 
or something like that.

Hi Ted,

I'd suspect that PHP gets used a lot in cases where management doesn't
care how the problem gets solved and also in a lot of small projects
bought outright from consultants etc. Thus a good many sites are done in
PHP but not that many PHP jobs are created.

Usually the layout of the site should not emphasis 'forward' and 'back'
but instead the steps to getting specific tasks done. You'll still
sometimes get people that hit the back button but a little UI design goes
a long way. No Java/Javascript required. ;)

PHP flows so naturally from C++ and PERL that it very well might even
be totally forgotten when it comes to writing up the job description. If I find
someone who can do C/C++ and/or PERL I wouldn't think twice about throwing php
at them.

Ok I know I can str-replace in a word document and have a nice doc for 
printing with page breaks and formatting without the URL at the bottom and 
the page numbers on the top. I was wondering if any of you guys know of a way 
to print using another method.  

I was thinking dynamic PDF, since some of the documents will vary in size but 
the speed and crashing of PDF files have me worried..

99% of the time I can hit the back button in my apps without any problem.
Just saying it isn't usually a problem if users just mentally don't
expect to hit the back button. ;)


Don't dream it. Be it.

There is an IE specific tag or attribute that allows for an alternate
document for printing.
The alternate can be any document the user has a plugin for.

I once wrote a task managing application where users would login to see in
the home page a queue of incoming tasks and work on them.
Many users would hit the refresh button on home page, or hit the back
button after reading a task, and because the home page was reached after a
login screen (username & password posted), they would get the "page has
expired message", very annoying.

The way I solved it:
1- I coded an authenticate function: User name & password get validated,
and if OK, some important user data gets saved as session variables.
2- On top of each page, I call a validate function that starts the session
and checks the session variables in (1). If they're not registered, it will
display login page, otherwise continues with validation (acls,
initialization, etc....)

When user first logins (in index.php), I get their username/password via a
POST form. If authentication (2) returns true, I use "header" to forward
them to the mainpage (main.php), free of all forms and thus, free of the
"expired" problem when refresh/back buttons are hit.

Because on top of mainpage validation function gets called, nobody can
access it without passing first through authentication.



So, you can save your post variables (either in the DB with session as a
key, or link them to session variables (as cookies)) and then send a header
that forwards to a new php page that will fetch your variables and display
the page. Since this new page would not be associated to any post action --
your variables came from the DB, not from post --, reloading or going out
and back in with the back button will not give any "expired" problem.

Voila!!!!

Might you be referring to a 'session expired' issues rather than the 'page expired' issue caused by trying to post a form twice ? If not, please elaborate cause I don't see how this method will fix the latter.

Hiya folks...
Need a little help with Javascript...

My problem is .... I need to close the current window and change the
'location' of it's parent window.
I was trying to do something like this, but obviously it doesn't work:

<?php
$ref = getenv('HTTP_REFERER');
echo "<script> NewWindow('$login_page?ref=$ref','login',300,200,false);
</script>";
?>

Within the login.page, after a successful login I want it to close itself
and reload the $ref
in the parent window:

<script> parent.location='$ref'; window.close(); </script>

Any JS experts wanna toss me a clue?   Thanks.

-Eddy

Say you have a php page like this:

/* test.php */
<?php
if($submit){
      // process form
      echo("you typed: $myvariable");

} else {
      // print form
      echo "\
<FORM METHOD=POST ACTION=\\"http://localhost/test.php\\">";
      echo "\
<INPUT TYPE=\\"text\\" NAME=\\"myvariable\\">";
      echo "\
<INPUT TYPE=\\"submit\\" name=\\"submit\\" value=\\"submit\\">";
      echo "\
</FORM>";
}
?>

The first time you call this page it will execute the 'else' part, thus
printing the form.
If you hit the submit button, it will execute the if part. Now, if you hit
refresh, you will get a 'page expired' error.

So one work around:

/* test.php */
<?php
session_start();
if($submit){
      // process form
      session_register("myvariable");
      header("Location: http://localhost/test1.php");

} else {
      session_unregister("myvariable");
      // print form
      echo "\
<FORM METHOD=POST ACTION=\\"http://localhost/test.php\\">";
      echo "\
<INPUT TYPE=\\"text\\" NAME=\\"myvariable\\">";
      echo "\
<INPUT TYPE=\\"submit\\" name=\\"submit\\" value=\\"submit\\">";
      echo "\
</FORM>";
}
?>

and then,

/* test1.php */
<?php
session_start();
echo("you typed: ".$_SESSION["myvariable"]);
?>

when you hit submit, you will get test1.php on your browser, with the right
content from the posted variables. When you hit refresh, no 'page expired'
error.

SELECT * FROM aaa WHERE aaa.ID NOT IN( SELECT ID FROM bbb )

DELETE FROM aaa WHERE aaa.ID NOT IT( SELECT ID FROM bbb )

aaa.ID and ID are the key fields which link aaa to bbb.

i've attempted but solutions, neither seem to work.

i'm upgrading the mysql from 3.23.44 to 3.23.51... hopefully that will do
it.

The solution I provided may not work with mysql, I'm not sure if mysql
supports nested queries.

Another way to try it would be:

SELECT aaa.* FROM aaa LEFT JOIN bbb ON aaa.ID=bbb.ID WHERE bbb.somefield IS
NULL ;

somefield would need to be any field from bbb.

Item B in your original query is based on your where clause.  With the info
you provided you get:

aaa.1 != bbb.1 ? No
aaa.1 != bbb.3 ? Yes
aaa.2 != bbb.1 ? Yes
aaa.2 != bbb.3 ? Yes

This is because you do not provide a Join condition.  Under a no join query,
you get a join that links all
records in aaa with all records in bbb which means without your where
clause, your query would result in 4 rows.

Nice try, but mysql doesn't support subselects... :(

You can use left joins:

SELECT aaa.a from aaa LEFT JOIN bbb on bbb.b = aaa.a where bbb.b IS NULL ;

this query will return all values in a that are not in b.

enjoy!

SELECT * FROM aaa WHERE aaa.ID NOT IN( SELECT ID FROM bbb )

DELETE FROM aaa WHERE aaa.ID NOT IT( SELECT ID FROM bbb )

aaa.ID and ID are the key fields which link aaa to bbb.

Subject: need your help populating a database
Message-ID: <F37lbhsKd6QR7j1HaKt000012dc@hotmail.com>

Hi, I just wrote a PHP program that produces music/movie/book 
recommendations.  It is supposed to produce recommendations in this form:

(starting from the fact that the user likes New Order - Bizarre Love 
Triangle)
90 people who like New Order - Bizarre Love Triangle also like New Order - 
Ceremony
80 people who like New Order - Bizarre Love Triangle also like New Order - 
Everything's Gone Green
60 people who like New Order - Bizarre Love Triangle also like Joy Division 
- Atrocity Exhibition
etc.

Unfortunately, I don't have enough data in the database to produce 
meaningful recommendations yet.  If each of you could give me a list of your 
ten (or more) favorite songs, movies, or books in this format:
artist/filmmaker/author - title
it would help me tremendously.

If you'd like to see how it looks so far, take a look at 
http://www.liquidmarkets.com/?name=youmightlike

recommendations).  The program for entering data is

In return, I can offer a free copy of LiquidClassifiedsXML 0.8.1 to each

You may want to tackle the built in dictionary in Unix. You can come up 
with some really cool band and book names quite easily using a perl or 
php script to generate random names. Plus it's a good exercise. You 
could generate a million names a minute i bet!  :-)

Subject: NYPHP.org Downtime -- Forward...
Message-ID: <20020813012001.21576.qmail@web12806.mail.yahoo.com>


Hello all,

NYPHP.org (which has been hosted in my apartment via DSL) is being
relocated!

I'm moving the box to a professional co-location facility in downtown
Manhattan.  This is a considerable advancement for NYPHP and will mean
greater features and *much* faster access.

Although I'm very excited, the move, inevitably, means downtime.  While
the NYPHP.org front-page will be available and contain updates on our
move, functionality will be severely limited.  This includes the
unavailability of the mailing list, logging in, and nyphp.org domain
email addresses.

However, in an effort to fill the upcoming communication void, I've
setup a web-based forum.  It is available at http://nyphp.org/forum 
(or, depending on the state of DNS: http://dev.nyphp.org/forum). 
Accounts from NYPHP.org are NOT being migrated, so you'll need to
create an account for the forum, but I urge everyone to create their
account and use the forum to it?s fullest (one day this will all be
integrated!).  If you should notice any problems, please contact me at
zaunere at yahoo.com to resolve these issues.  If you have prior
experience with phpBB, feel equally welcome to contact me and I?ll try
to accommodate any configuration suggestions and changes.

This email will most likely be the last on this list until Friday, or
even into the weekend.  Progress and updates will be available on the
forum and at http://nyphp.org (or http://dev.nyphp.org depending on the
state of DNS).

I'm looking forward to our new server and what it will offer, and I
thank everyone for their continuing support.

For any reason, I am always available at zaunere at yahoo.com.


Thank you,

Hans Z.

OK, so the server isn't quite down yet, but I just had to send this out
- very exciting news:

I've killed the sendmail listener now, however, so this *really* is the

Hi all,

I'm sorry for the longer than expected delay in getting the mailing
lists back online, however it seems that they are once again fully
functional.  If you do notice any oddities, either with the list or on
the website, please contact me immediately at zaunere at yahoo.com.

I have the rest of this week off from work, and will be trying to
improve http://nyphp.org on an ongoing basis during this time.  While
this probably means periods of mailing list (and even website)
instability, I ask that everyone use the mailing list normally, and
even excessively.  This will help in development (the more messages,
the more debugging info gets generated) and I will try to liason any
dropped messages.  It is also important to note that the new server
does not have reverse DNS at this point; as a result, some mail servers
will not accept messages, but I do expect rDNS to be functioning within
a couple of days.

Lastly, I'd like to thank every for bearing with us while these
upgrades are done.  While it may seem to be more of an annoyance than
anything else now, this new server will be a keystone in NYPHP's
progress and development.

Thank you,

Hans Zaunere

Now that the mail server is operational, I'd like to remind everyone
about our next monthly meeting; TOMORROW, 8/28!  With Mozilla and
Mozdev developers presenting, this certainly isn't a meeting you'd want
to miss.  Starting at our usual time and place (details at
http://nyphp.org), be sure to join NYPHP for another exciting meeting
and presentation.  Details follow and are available at
http://nyphp.org.

Thank you,

New York PHP Presents:

"Mozilla and Mozdev"

NYPHP is excited to offer this month's presentation from one of the
staunchest Open Source projects: Mozilla/Mozdev.

Pete Collins et al of http://mozdev.org will discuss the Mozilla,
Mozdev and Hovercraft projects, and how they inter-develop to produce
some of the most celebrated Open Source software.  And since these
projects rely heavily on PHP as an integral part of development and
end-user enhancement, PHP's current and future endeavors will certainly
be exciting to hear.

Please join us August 28th at 6:30pm in Manhattan for what's sure to be
a stimulating and informative meeting.  Location details and a map are
available at http://nyphp.org.

Subject: PHP/LDAP
Message-ID: <20020828124202.GA5012@bnl.gov>

I need some guidance from the LDAP gurus, I think.  I've long been
able to get PHP to read from LDAP, but now I have the need to write,
and I'm running up against a strange problem.

Basic code is as follows:

----
<?
$ds=ldap_connect("ldapmachine.bnl.gov");

if (!$ds)
{
  echo "No connect! Result was ".$ds;
  exit;
}

#non-anon bind, since we have to update stuff.

$nab=ldap_bind($ds,"cn=admin,dc=bnl,dc=gov","password");
if (!$nab)
{
  echo "Bind failed! Exiting...";
  exit;
}

$searchstring="(uid=".$uid.")";
$sr=ldap_search($ds,"dc=bnl,dc=gov","$searchstring");

echo "Search String: <b>$searchstring</b><br>";

$info=ldap_get_entries($ds,$sr);
$dn=$info["dn"];

echo $dn;

#$info1["objectClass"]="inetLocalMailRecipient";



$bla=ldap_mod_add($ds,"$dn",$info1);

ldap_close($ds);
----

Now, this is just test code, but it should work. $uid gets
passed from a form, and I just want to add an objectClass,
and 2 attributes. What I get is this from PHP:

Warning: LDAP: modify operation could not be completed. in /var/www/ldap/mklabmail.php on line 33


And this from LDAP:

I've been lucky enough to only have to read from LDAP myself, but I did
run into the fact that the LDAP functions can be picky about what is
pased to them; ie, references, arrays, etc.  The code certainly looks
reasonable, however, I noticed a stray #, although I'm probably just
nit-picking.

Sorry I couldn't be more help, though.

PHP 2? As in, 1.. 2?  I don't think this will be possible, especially
on something as modern as WinXP.  Go with PHP 4.2.2 (or 4.3 coming up
soon) and you'll be much happier.  Plus, I don't think PWS is supported
anymore on XP (http://www.smartwin.com.au/help/install_pws.htm).  But I
would really try to setup a modern PHP version with Apache/IIS on
Windows.

Hans

 Found that Win XP home doesn't support PWS.

Huh. I found out how to make it work, but I'm not sure why this
kludge... I ran up etheral, and sniffed the packets, since it knows
LDAP packets. In the modify request, the DN was blank! So, poking around
some more, I got the bright idea to go from:

$dn=$info["dn"];

to

$dn=$info[0]["dn"];

Since it, really a multi-dim array. Well, it works now. Sorry
for the bother.

I run into these types of things all the time, and find print_r() or
var_dump() invaluable to assure I know what I'm actually working with. 
Sometimes they don't fit just right, however, so I wrote a little
wrapper which will save some of the output buffering bothers and
optionaly put it to a log file instead of the browser.  I've included
it below.

H


function trigger_dump( $mixed,$error = 1 ) {
   if( $error === 0 ) {
      echo '<pre>';
      print_r($mixed);
      echo '</pre>';
   } else {
      ob_start();
      print_r($mixed);
      trigger_error(ob_get_contents());
      ob_end_clean();
   }
}

Correct PWS is not supported on XP.  In fact if you try to install it, it
tells you that can't be done.  I am running XP Home ( forced on me by the
notebook I purchased ) but I have instructions how to install the full IIS
from NT( forget which version ).  This solution works fine for me since I
also develop *gasp* asp stuff.

Hello Robert,

If you wish to unsubscribe from the mailing list, login to
http://nyphp.org.  If you run into problems, contact
listmaster at nyphp.org, but please do not send administrative requests to
the list.

I'm sorry for posting this to the list, but others should remember that
sending "take me off the list" requests to the mailing list itself will
get you no where.

Thanks,

Hans

Hi -

I do a lot of development in ASP and some in ColdFusion, but my preferred
web development language is PHP.  However, I've been quite dismayed at my
inability to cleanly port some functionality from my ASP apps into PHP.  The
biggest hurdle by far is that I cannot cache data in "Application scope".
In ASP, I can have "Page scope" - which is just regular variables, "Session
scope" by using the Session object and also "Application scope" which is
accessible to all sessions that are using this web application.  So far, I
haven't found any clean way to do this in PHP except using shared memory,
and I understand that there are limitations on the size of shared memory I
can get my hands on through PHP.

So my question to the list is:

Have you found any clean and simple way to store data in Application scope
in PHP?  I could live with a php class that handles shared memory well and
provides an elegant way to access and manage objects stored there, but
haven't been able to find a good implementation of this yet.

Interestingly, unsubscribing on the web site doesn't work; I 
unsubscribed about a half hour ago, and I keep getting these e-mails.

Perhaps some new code needs work, or the e-mail list is being served 
off an old database?

What about placing a footer on all list messages that tells users how to

If people bothered to read that far down AND list participants took the 
time to trim the crap/fat from their messages I might agree to that. But 
most list members seem to be youngin's or are so indoctrinated with the 
Jeopardy style of replying (and yes, I really *do* feel that comments 
belong at the bottom of the message, not the top); this would only lead to 
more clutter on the list.

Subject: Paging through large result sets
Message-ID: <B993A1F6.13B9%myersm@optonline.net>


First: I am a newcomer to MySQL and PHP. So I will be asking many newbie
questions, which I hope is not a drag!

Environ: Macintosh G4 running OSX, MySQL and PHP installations provided by
the inimitable Marc Liyanage. Webserver is Apache.

Experience: Proficient with UserLand Frontier scripting and webserving;
moderate experience with perl and javascript. PHP looks pretty
straightforward.

I have already built a few MySQL databases from scratch, so I have some
experience with the mysql client, mysqladmin, and mysqlimport. Lately I have
also been using the web-based frontend phpMyAdmin.

----

What are the implementation strategies for allowing a user to page through a
result set that is too large to view in its entirety?

I see that for simple queries (eg. 1 table or 1 join), the LIMIT statement
is the easy solution, which entails re-running the SQL query as the user
browses.

But what if the query has multiple joins? It seems inefficient to re-run the
query each time. If I want to cache the original result in a new MySQL
table, then I have to manage that on a per-user basis. This implies using
cookies or session ID to track the user.

This also suggests I need to code a separate process that periodically drops
these temporary result tables after a defined time has passed. Thus, I need
to continually track the time of last access to each temp table. That data
could go in another MySQL table, or a file of my own convention.

Whew! There are probably other aspects of this arrangement that require
management code.

Am I on the right track here, or am I making it harder than it needs to be?

I think I need more real-world examples of mysql_pconnect() than my PHP
reference provides.

In the context of a web-environment, where a user can issue a query and then
walk away for hours or days, how does mysql_pconnect() work?

After a connection is first established in this manner, does it ever close
on its own if it is not explicitly told to? With multiple users accessing
the database, what prevents an ever increasing number of persistent
connections?

Hi Mike,

You're on the right track, but it really depends on many different variables.
Can you tell us the specifics of the application in mind ?

If the site doesn't get to much traffic, and the original query is fast
enough for your needs, then who cares if it's not efficient :)
I'd only go with a different solution if the query takes a "long time".
The solution you propose would work, but is it worth the comlexity ?

I have an idea that would work if :
1. Using MySQL 4.X is an option (yes I know it's beta, but it's really
quite stable) 
2. You can pump the MySQL and PHP machines with memory
3. You can limit the max number of results (to like a few hundred)

What you could do is:

1. Do the complicated query with a limit of the max number of results
2. read the whole thing into an array
3. just display array entires x to y.

MySQL 4.x has result caching, so re-doing the query will be FAST.

Basically it's more or less the same idea as you had, but instead of
trying to cache the results yourself, you're letting MySQL 4.X do it
for you. Of course there are plenty of other MySQL result cache solutions
out there if MySQL 4.x is not an option, or you need finer control of
the cache.

Hope that helped.
Ophir

p.s.
We've actually done exactly what you describe on one of the projects
where I work (Community Connect Inc).

Apparently there's a wait_timeout parameter that sets the amount of time the link will stay open. But in general you need not worry about these.. they will stay open for a while and get used if some other connection request is made during that period. 

It has nothing to do with a visitor issuing a query and walking away. The connection -even though it's persistent- will not stay active forever.

this might be misunderstanding.. are you sure this is for pconnect ?

php.net says:

"
 First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent) link that's already open with the same host, username and password. If one is found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use (mysql_close() will not close links established by mysql_pconnect()). "

Note that that's the wait_timeout parameter on MySQL, not PHP.  The default
is somewhere around 28800 seconds (8 hours)... You could set that to be
fairly low (around a half-hour (1800 secs), perhaps) to be sure you're
cleaning up your idle connections.

Apparently there's a wait_timeout parameter that sets the amount of time the
link will stay open. But in general you need not worry about these.. they
will stay open for a while and get used if some other connection request is
made during that period. 

It has nothing to do with a visitor issuing a query and walking away. The
connection -even though it's persistent- will not stay active forever.

Oktay,

It could be, I recall that Rasmus answered someone's similar question about 
mysql_pconnect with a pretty simple answer.  I wish I had taken notes.

In any case, your connection pool will be limited by Apache & and MySQL's 
max_connections and MaxClients settings, so you won't have an ever 
increasing number of connections:

Yes, I'm all for keeping it simple!

The server and the hosted apps are all up to me, so I could certainly

The machine is at its max: 1GB of RAM (It's a 1999 Mac). These days, I don't
know if that qualifies as a lot of memory.

Nice.

Does MySQL 4.X support sub-selects yet?

Thanks for the suggestions.

not sure, but a strategy i used to use in coldfusion/ms-sql (before you all
gag, be happy to know i've migrated myself to learning php/mysql during this
period of unemployment) involved performing the query, then redirecting the
user to a view-results page which used an URL variable set by the
query/redirect script containing the id's of the items in the result set.

so let's say the user searched for products - one script would perform the
rather complex set of queries for the search, build an id list, redirect to
an URL looking like /?id_list=0.2.5.7.8.9.24.78, and the results page would
re-query the db for the product details based on a subset of the
dot-delimited id_list.

said query would look something like:
q = mysql_query("SELECT id, name, desc FROM product WHERE id IN (" .
replace(".",",",HTTP_GET_VARS["id_list"])) . ")") or die("!mysql_query");

this Might seem problematic for large result sets, but actually you'd be
surprised how much data you can stuff into an URL with no worries
whatsoever.

Hi,

For one of my domains I was doing search on 'Persistent Database Connections' with Php and MySQL.
There are several aspects of persistent connection, you can't just directly use mysql_pconnect to
have persistent connection. Even in php.net and related sites don't give enough explanation on
this topic. I guess they keep this kind of performance related information to themselves. Here are
my notes on this topic :

1- You need to have Apache (or web server) waiting on the memory if you want to have persistent
connection. Otherwise Php and MySQL may loses traces of connection ID's so MySQL opens new
connection each time. To have this you need to modfiy 'Keep Alive', 'KeepAliveTimeOut' and
'MaxKeepALiveReqeusts' line in httpd.conf (also if you have really high loaded site like mine you
may need to make changes on Apache header files and recompile it) Latest Apache sources by default
enables KeepAlive to ON, but older versions were shipped with OFF value, so this is the first
thing you should check to enable Persistent database connections.

2- You are supposed to use 'mysqlpconnect' on every Php script, 'mysqlconnect' may not be able to
find same connection ID that was created by mysql_pconnect 

3- To check whether you have peristent conn or not your 'show processlist' request get should
produce an output like this one (sleep lines indicate that that conenction is waiting for request
and time is waiting time in seconds) :

mysql> show processlist;

I suggest to use 'mysql_unbuffered_query' for large result sets. It really effects performance.
>From the manual :


mysql_unbuffered_query
(PHP 4 >= 4.0.6)

mysql_unbuffered_query --  Send an SQL query to MySQL, without fetching and buffering the result
rows 
Description
resource mysql_unbuffered_query ( string query [, resource link_identifier [, int result_mode]])


mysql_unbuffered_query() sends a SQL query query to MySQL, without fetching and buffering the
result rows automatically, as mysql_query() does. On the one hand, this saves a considerable
amount of memory with SQL queries that produce large result sets. On the other hand, you can start
working on the result set immediately after the first row has been retrieved: you don't have to
wait until the complete SQL query has been performed. When using multiple DB-connects, you have to
specify the optional parameter link_identifier. 

The optional result_mode parameter can be MYSQL_USE_RESULT and MYSQL_STORE_RESULT. It defaults to
MYSQL_USE_RESULT, so the result is not buffered. See also mysql_query() for the counterpart of
this behaviour. 

Note: The benefits of mysql_unbuffered_query() come at a cost: You cannot use mysql_num_rows() on
a result set returned from mysql_unbuffered_query(). You also have to fetch all result rows from
an unbuffered SQL query, before you can send a new SQL query to MySQL. 

Best,

Kayra Otaner

I am working on a project with a similar problem of large result sets, and a
relatively slow query due to many table joins and fulltext indexes.  While I
don't expect the site to get huge traffic, queries take about a second or
two on my Dual 500MHz Apple G4, and this site will be hosted on a shared
server at an ISP, where I would think it would just get slower.

So I was thinking as a way of extending your idea of passing keys through a
URL redirect, I'll put the IDs from my result set into a session variable.
This poses two problems. First users need to get a cookie (or I need to go
through hoops) to store the session id.  Second, users may want to open
multiple windows with multiple searches, so there needs to be a way of
associating more than one search with a session.

I'm thinking a way to kill two birds with one stone is to create a unique
'search session id' and place it in hidden fields and urls of the pages that
are part of browsing a particular result.  A new ID is created whenever the
user hits the search button.

Hi guys:
How can I submit my site to search engines? I know there are some paid services, says "you pay $29.99, we submit your url to 1000+ search engines...",  but I want to kown how can they do that? Is it possible for me to write a program in PHP to submit my site by myself? Do I need to sign some contracts with search engines, or do I have to get permission to do it? where to find search engines' search links? How the search engines work? sorry too much questions.
Thanks
Mark

for starters, check out:

    www.searchenginewatch.com

will give you lots of background.

Also, when you go to search engines, there's often a submit link
somewhere.  Often it's at the very bottom or hidden on the side.  just
look through the whole page at all the links.

Also, make your site available to bots/spiders, and have good meta tags.

hope this is a good starting point.

If the application data doesn't change often, you can store it in an
included file.  If it changes in a more dynamic way, you can store it in a 
database which can be queried as needed.

No?

Dan, I would agree that what you say can be done, but it does not
necessarily fit the bill of an application scoped variable in ASP.  With an
application scoped variable I can change it's value from one session & that
change is available in other sessions.  This is especially useful for things
like failover or site maint.  I use it myself for site maint so that when I
am ready to do site maint, I go into the app and into a section reserved for
developers(me) and set the maint flag.  I then wait on my developer screen
to watch the count of connected users ( also via an application scoped
variable ).  Once the count is at zero, I can then rollout my changes and
reactivate the application.  Basically through out the application are
checks for the maint flag.  If the maint flag is found to be set, it forces
the user to complete what they are on & logs them out of the app.

In PHP you would need to use shared memory to get this same behavior, unless
you used a table in your database to hold onto application level variables.

BTW, the other major advantage of application scoped variables is that they
use less memory since all sessions go to the same variable rather than each
session taking memory for these shared variables.

Subject: can't get one field out of mysql
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20020830142427.00b1af98@mail.optonline.net>

There is no doubt a simple explanation here, but I'm still relatively 
inexperienced and so I'm missing it.  I'm running this off localhost right 
now so I can't give you a URI.  I'm using MySQL 3.23.51-nt and PHP 4.2.1.

I can't retrieve a text field even though I can retrieve all other fields 
from the record.  But I *can* get it using MySQL Monitor, so I know it's there.
==============
Here is the table definition:
create table names(
nameid int not null,
key(nameid),
lname varchar(15),
fname varchar(25),
note text);
=============
Here is the relevant segment from the retrieval code (with a lot of 
debugging thrown in):
$result=mysql_query($query) or die("Query #1 failed");

$numresults=mysql_num_rows($result);

$numnames=$numresults;

   for ($i=0;$i<$numnames;$i++){
     $row_array=mysql_fetch_row($result);

// debugging
$numfields=mysql_num_fields($result);
echo "number of fields is $numfields<br />";
for ($j=0;$j<$numfields;$j++) {
$field=mysql_field_name($result,$j)." | ";
echo $field;}
echo "<br />";

     $lname[$i]=$row_array[0];
     $fname[$i]=$row_array[1];
     $note[i]=$row_array[2];
     $date[$i]=$row_array[3];
     $unitid[$i]=$row_array[4];
     $address[$i]=$row_array[5];

//debugging
echo 
"###$lname[$i]|$fname[$i]|$note[$i]|$date[$i]|$unitid[$i]|$address[$i]###<br 
/>";}
====================
Here is the output from this:
lname | fname | note | dates | unitid | address |
###Southwell|Michael G||Jan 1983 -|106|81 South Road###
=================
So you can see that the fieldname has been retrieved but the contents of 
the field haven't.  The contents themselves are simply this (it's test 
data):  "He is creating the Historical Archives website database."  Anybody 
have any ideas about what could be wrong here?

aaargh!  I was looking at the "note" not the "i".  Thanks for the eyes, 
Oktay.  I knew it had to be something stupid; sorry, everybody.

Hi Jim
Where are these "install IIS instructions" located?
Can anyone download IIS from MS web site?
I work mainly in Visual FoxPro. What language(s) to you work in? I went to
your web-site so I have a handle on your company.

Im interested in doing a CD auto-start which could include as options:

My Application (must include PHP path, MySQL info, etc)
My Application + PHP (must include MySQL info, etc)
My Application + PHP + MySQL

Basically Id like to present a whole package to a novice user and an 
advance installation procedure but I would think that setting this up 
would be a little different than just a normal application in some sense.

Anyone have a good idea?

Thanks.
