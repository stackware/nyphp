Hi all, how do you solve the problem of the browser detection?

The PHP built in function get_browser() doesn't seams to work very well,
it's slow and inaccurate, it also need a huge browscap.ini file to be
loaded and updated, and looks like isn't maintained really well.

The most accurate library I've found uses the user-agent-string.info API,
which isn't very fast, and it doesn't tell the device type, such as iPhone,
iPad, Android, etc.

Not satisfacted by the available solutions I've decided to create a library
that with dependency injection loads other parser, so it's flexible and
accurate. The library, Sail\Useragent, is open source and available on
packagist:

The best way to do browser detection is to not do it. It's unreliable and
difficult to even come close to trying it.

Why do you want detection?

It looks like Detector just uses modenizer some how behind the scenes. Kind
of cheating? Federico have you looked into Phantom.js yet?

Fair enough. I need to do user analytics.

I can't run JS and I didn't find any good PHP solution.

I googled and networked around for sometimes, it looks like browser detection is just messed up because the browser finger prints don't have a standard. 

So, the best solution I found is definitely the online user-agent-string.info API, which is accurate but slow and unreliable because the site is slow and often down. They also provide an ugly but working PHP library that download the browser definition file, which is faster but accurate. Although again it does not provide the platform (iPhone...).

So in conclusion, I've create the sail\useragent, because I needed a solution and because it was a fun challenge!

I've implemented WURFL before, but it's pretty heavy and a bit complicated
to setup and maintain.
