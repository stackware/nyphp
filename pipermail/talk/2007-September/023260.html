Let me restate that &quot;discovered something new to me&quot; -- which isn't 
that hard to do.

&gt;<i>There are no sessions, or at least there shouldn't be in

Ouch -- straight through the heart, and now you've got my head hurting too.

In all my &quot;applications&quot; I use sessions to pass significant variables 
around from page to page. Each page is doing something different for 
the user and it make sense to me to break the routines into different 
groups and string them together using sessions.

If the user opts out at any time, then no harm done. If I want the 
user to have a state to come back to, then I use cookies &quot;on-the-fly&quot; 
to store that on the user's machine. For example:

<A HREF="http://ancientstones.com">http://ancientstones.com</A>

If a user is looking through the widgets and has a search criteria 
they like, it's saved on their machine as a cookie and when they 
return, it's still there.

However, if the data is &quot;sensitive&quot;, then I require a log-in.  If the 
user leaves in the middle of a session, and I want to store the 
session for the user, then I use the session id and mysql to store 
data and state on the server and the sid in a cookie on the user's 
machine. When they return, I check session id's and require another 
log-in before presenting &quot;sensitive&quot; data and they're back where they 
were.

All pretty simple stuff.

If someone told me that I couldn't use sessions, then I'm not sure 
how I would handle &quot;sensitive&quot; data. For example, I'm currently 
working on a site that provides papers, articles, tapes, cds, 
conferences, seminars, and videos to it members. However, they must 
be currently paid-up members to access the goodies.

My solution is to simply require them to log-in and set a session 
auth variable to OK and turn them loose. Then they have access to all 
the goodies.

While what they ask for on the site is provided in the URL via a GET, 
and as such, they could bookmark it and/or send the URL to someone 
else -- but they can't get at the goodies without being logged-in 
(i.e.,  session auth variable set to OK).

Again, all pretty simple stuff.

This works for me -- but, how do you do this without using sessions?

Cheers,

tedd
