</I>Well It was real great to see all those replies. And could not resist to add
my own views.

I started doing php on a fury, to prove that php was better than jsp, no
flames, and I dont want to hurt anyone. At that time I just had experience
in perl cgi, and wanted to switch somehow, due to the hype php was getting.

My first project was a fully written community site just for the hero honda
cbz users, since we had a handful in our neighbourhood. Well it was real
tough, when starting with a personal project, but I myself being the project
owner, I could decide on what features and where to cut corners.  The
biggest lifesaver was the dynamic function reference at <A HREF="http://php.net,">http://php.net,</A>
which I had stated to rsync to my office once a week longback. And to admit
it, once done it was a piece of hell. From then on there was no turning
back.

Currently I am mostly doing code reviews, guiding new recruits and doing
R&amp;D.
