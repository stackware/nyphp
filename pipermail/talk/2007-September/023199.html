Hi,

&gt;<i> One thing that seems to have gone unsaid in the praise for Ajax is its
</I>&gt;<i> ability to radically transform how we maintain state.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The web server session is our basic mechanism for storing information
</I>&gt;<i> between requests.  But it gets clumsier and clumsier to try to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain complex state across many page requests when you use a
</I>&gt;<i> session. Ingenious minds have put their will to the problem and come
</I>&gt;<i> up with workable systems, but all of them are complicated because of
</I>&gt;<i> the nature of the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That problem, stated here, is simply the problem of tracking what I'll
</I>&gt;<i> call the &quot;context&quot; of a user's session.  Some elements of a session
</I>&gt;<i> are fixed: the user id, the password, a few other things, but almost
</I>&gt;<i> everything that we need to track is always changing.  A basic
</I>&gt;<i> example: a list of search results.  Where do you store it?  When the
</I>&gt;<i> user hits, &quot;NEXT PAGE&quot;, how do you know what to do?  If you are using
</I>&gt;<i> a session, what happens if he opens a new window and has two search
</I>&gt;<i> results sets up for two different tables?
</I>
We've encountered similar problems, which are especially prevelant in a web
2.0 super-duper-magic type of site (ie, tabbed browsing, draggable modules,
etc).

&gt;<i> Ajax solves this problem neatly by letting you move all state [1] into
</I>&gt;<i> the browser.  This makes sense from an architectural viewpoint because
</I>&gt;<i> we are putting this context information close to where it is needed,
</I>&gt;<i> the UI.
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean, though, by keeping state in the browser.  Here's
essentially what's work for me in the past:P

-- typical session ID is generated and the browser is cookied, just like
with any other site.  this sets a session for the entire browser - nothing
special here

-- the Javascript code is written to persist the browser's cookie, so it's
requests appear to the server just like any other regular browser request

-- the server is now getting hit with numerous requests - some are the
&quot;whole browser&quot; and some are simply partial requests (Ajax/JS requests).
These requests are typically out of the classic order that you'd expect a
browser to produce, since you can't always assume the timing of the user's
browser.

The Ajax requests hit a certain set of URLs, let's say /Ajax/, on the
server.  The server knows to handle these requests specially, which in
effect creates sub-sessions.  That is to say, for every complex set of Ajax
operations, the server is maintaining it's own sub-set of data.  For
instance, search results and the search criteria, which is attached strictly
to a single module or Ajax part of the page.
