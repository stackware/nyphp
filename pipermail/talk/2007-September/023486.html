I'd also like to prevent users entering something in an input field 
because their &quot;friend&quot; tells them it's a good idea.

But since I can't control users.....

I'm thinking more from the perspective that the Application would run on 
a GoDaddy host, it will run on a Dreamhost account, and it will run on a 
dedicated server.

Designed in such a way to devolve down to the single db user access 
rights when that is all that is available, but will scale up to the 
multi user access level when it's available.

It would mean a lot of redundant code at the application level to manage 
security when the user access is lacking.

It seems to me it's better to start with an app dedicated for the shared 
hosting environment and then upgrade to something like Andromeda when it 
is economically justified.  But it would be cool to be able to use the 
same app under different security models.
