<PRE>That is weird, so your LINK is IN an included file? That is wierd. You would
think that the LINK doesn't happen until all the PHP is done executing...so
the LINK should happen the same regardless...however, if it's not happening,
and your INCLUDE file is in some location that, if it was executed directly
the LINK path would be wrong, then that would suggest that PHP behaves
differently depending on the way in which files are included (via include()
vs. php.ini).

Tis strange though.

I just noticed something strange. If I comment out my include directive in
php.ini, files in the same directory as the calling file are still included,
BUT stylesheets fail to be included. Basically, if I pull up a file that has
an include statement for another file, that other file's content is included
but the LINK tag is ignored for some reason. I don't understand why that
would happen. I am parsing through CSS and Javascript files, but it should
still work, shouldn't it?

You don't _HAVE_ to.

You DO have to if you have your include files in another location AND you
want to be able to say


include(&quot;mylib.php&quot;);

Otherwise, you have to do something along the lines of

include($GLOBALS['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . &quot;/../include/mylib.php&quot;);

Hi Deidra,

You have to add the directory that contains the files you wish to include to
the php.ini file.
There is a section for paths and directories in there:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Paths and Directories ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; UNIX: &quot;/path1:/path2&quot;  
;include_path = &quot;.:/php/includes&quot;
;
; Windows: &quot;\\path1;\\path2&quot;
;include_path = &quot;.;c:\\php\\includes;c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\&quot;

Once you add the path, it should work.

List,

I'm breaking up my html site into includes (header, copyright, etc.).
Within the HTML documents that call the include files, I have the
appropriate php tags (i.e. &lt;? include(&quot;copyright.html&quot;); ?&gt; . All of the
includes (i.e. copyright.html) are sitting in the same directory as my
html pages (i.e. index.html). PHP is installed.

So, why, no matter what I do, don't the include files parse into my
document? I have tried to changed the include extensions from .html to
php to .inc. None parse. Most of my includes contain basic HTML (no php)
like &lt;p&gt;Copyright &amp;copy; 2003. All Rights Reserved.&lt;/p&gt;.

Am I doing something wrong? Or does my technician need to change something
in the server configuration (if so what)?

Thanks,
Deidra
