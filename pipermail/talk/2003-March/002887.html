<PRE>Do your include files also have &lt;? and ?&gt; inside them? Maybe it's a dumb
statement. But &lt;? in the file that is doing the including doesn't carry into
the included file.

THanks,

Subject: [nycphp-talk] php include file question


List,

I'm breaking up my html site into includes (header, copyright, etc.).
Within the HTML documents that call the include files, I have the
appropriate php tags (i.e. &lt;? include(&quot;copyright.html&quot;); ?&gt; . All of the
includes (i.e. copyright.html) are sitting in the same directory as my
html pages (i.e. index.html). PHP is installed.

So, why, no matter what I do, don't the include files parse into my
document? I have tried to changed the include extensions from .html to
php to .inc. None parse. Most of my includes contain basic HTML (no php)
like &lt;p&gt;Copyright &amp;copy; 2003. All Rights Reserved.&lt;/p&gt;.

Am I doing something wrong? Or does my technician need to change something
in the server configuration (if so what)?

Thanks,
Deidra
