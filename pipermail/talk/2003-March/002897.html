<PRE>I just performed this test.

1) Created a file called inctest.php
2) Contents of inctest.php

&lt;?
	include(&quot;./myinc.php&quot;);
?&gt;

3) Created file called myinc.php
4) Contents of myinc.php (note there are no &lt;? and ?&gt;)
	
	print(&quot;Hello&quot;);

5) Loaded up file inctest.php in browser
6) Output is:

	print(&quot;Hello&quot;);

So it seems to me that you MUST put the PHP code in the INCLUDED file IN &lt;?
and ?&gt; in order for it to be parsed. It doesn't matter that you are
including it from withing PHP and it doesn't matter that it ends with .php.
It will not be parsed if it is not in &lt;? ?&gt;.

This test was run on RH 7.3 with PHP 4.3.0-dev with Apache 1.3.22

Try:
  &lt;?php include('./copyright.html'); ?&gt;

What's your OS and web server?  I found that under PHP 4.3.*, Apache,
NetBSD (and perhaps other combinations) there was a recent change in
behavior where the directories above the included files need to be world
readable and executable (meaning &quot;chmod 705&quot;).

What error messages are you getting?  You do have error messages turned
on, right?  This kind of stuff comes in handy, helping you figure it out
for yourself, and if you cant, helps us help you.

The suggestions that you need to edit your include path statement in the 
php.ini file are likely incorrect, since &quot;.&quot; is in the default include 
path value already.

Similarly, the file extension doesn't matter, nor does the included file 
need to have &lt;?php ?&gt; in them.
