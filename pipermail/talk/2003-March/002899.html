<PRE>Well...Deidra said &quot;parsed&quot; so my brain read it as PHP parsed...not HTML...

so, assuming that the included file is not yielding any output...

...I have no idea :)

Permissions maybe?

They are required if you plan on parsing PHP code in the included file. The
Zend engine switches out of PHP mode whenever include is called and it will
not parse by default. It then returns to PHP mode when it reachs EOF.

Try:
  &lt;?php include('./copyright.html'); ?&gt;

What's your OS and web server?  I found that under PHP 4.3.*, Apache,
NetBSD (and perhaps other combinations) there was a recent change in
behavior where the directories above the included files need to be world
readable and executable (meaning &quot;chmod 705&quot;).

What error messages are you getting?  You do have error messages turned
on, right?  This kind of stuff comes in handy, helping you figure it out
for yourself, and if you cant, helps us help you.

The suggestions that you need to edit your include path statement in the 
php.ini file are likely incorrect, since &quot;.&quot; is in the default include 
path value already.

Similarly, the file extension doesn't matter, nor does the included file 
need to have &lt;?php ?&gt; in them.
