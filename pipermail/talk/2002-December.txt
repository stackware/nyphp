Hi:

Does anyone know why apache would corrupt files
over a few K. I am running Apache 2.0 with php as
a module and with virtual hosts. The upload
directory is set correctly and I'm running with
the open_basedir and safemode on.

Any thoughts or ideas why images would be
corrupted. For example, I have the system output
bad data and it says that a file sized: 63,887
bytes gets uploaded as 113,231 bytes?? Anyhow, I'm
confused why this would happen. Any help would be
of great assistance.

-Evan

Beats me, but the PHP crew has been telling folks not to use PHP with 
Apache 2 at this point (well, at least when I last heard a few months 
ago) since it's still in major development mode.

Use the latest Apache 1.3.x and you'll be happy.

Sadly on windows 2000 I don't dare use apache 1.3
branch. It really does suck on windows but that's
what I'm bound to for now. I think I have figured
out the problem and tracked it down to an obscure
bug. I've spent probably 20-30 hours trying to
find this bug but it seems like if you use:

<Files *.php>
	SetOutputFilter PHP
	SetInputFilter PHP
</Files>

it will cause any file uploaded over 8500 bytes to
corrupt. Weird huh? Well, I'm off to do more
testing to see if this fix by removing those lines
works.

Rasmus has been telling people not to use Apache 2, period, everybody else
pretty much stays out of that holy war ;-)

PHP and Apache2 is pretty much stable from a PHP perspective - the major 
architectural difference is that Apache 2 supports a threaded model instead
of a multi-process model, which means that everything that links into 
Apache2 must be threadsafe.  This therefore means that everything that links
into php must also be threadsafe, if you are using libraries that aren't
threadsafe, then you're messed up.

So, when using Apache 2, you can't use the threadsafe model, but using the
multi-process model should be fine.  [1]

In this case :)  I don't think this is a php issue, or an apache 2 issue
(its running quite stably on large sites like download.com that serve many
files above a few K :), I'd take a look at what exactly is happening with 
these files - are you locking reads & writes?  What are the permissions?  
Are the files themselves messed up - or is it just the display?  Are you 
properly setting mime types, etc. etc. etc.

-Sterling

[1]  It also has a few other problems, such as messed up content transfer
encoding, and a rapidly changing filter model, but those would not be 
related....

A note on this, this is not how you should be handling PHP with
Apache 2.0, you should be using MIME types...

As noted in other posts, be sure to run Apache 2 in it's classic prefork
process model (http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/#core).  I've had issues
with threads on FreeBSD, but seems to work well on RH 7.3; no idea what the
process model under Windows (mpm_winnt) means, however.  Either way, AFAIK
PHP isn't thread-safe yet, so go with the prefork process module.

Although the size increase seems a bit large, this sounds like it could be a
binary safety issue.  UNIX doesn't make a distinction for most file
operations but Windows will.  Make sure you open the file properly, something
like: fopen('pathtofile', 'rb') (the b is vital, as noted in the second Note
at http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php

And make sure that the other functions you are using within PHP to operate on
the file's data are specified as binary safe (not fgets(), but rather
fread(), for example) and the Note at
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fread.php

And if I buy a commercial I can say just about anything I want too.  
Now, I'm not here to start/get into an OS war (Yes, I am a Linux  
bigot). However I will make the following observation. I debated though  
high school, then went to college on a scholarship for debate. After  
nearly 10 years of debating if I learned nothing, it was the truism  
"Statistics lie." In so much that you can turn to support your  
side/point/belief just as easily as your opponent can.

Those who wish to get into a urination contest, go find a different  
stall...

Funny how they didn't mention the costs of the various BSD OS's.

Here are two of the prime quotes from the story:

"Personnel costs involved in the upkeep of Linux-based servers, which 
manage networks of computers, far outweigh the benefits of being able to 
obtain the software for free or at lower costs"

"For example, in order to support 100 full-time users 
over a five year period on a networking server, Linux-based systems cost 
$13,263 versus $11,787 for Microsoft, the IDC study said."

Now, that second quote doesn't say anything about the cost of the
operating software.  Then, let's not forget the cost of MS Office and
other software for 100 workstations.  Are those costs included in that 
$11,787 figure?  Sure doubt it.

Anybody remember this: http://www.cyber.com.au/cyber/about/linux_vs_windows_tco_comparison.pdf

However, in the interest of fair competition.  The above study pits RedHat 7.2 against Windows 2000 Advanced Server.  Perhaps a more accurate study would incorporate one of the per-seat/per-server
Linuses against the Microsoft Solution. ie: RedHat Advanced Server (http://www.redhat.com/software/advancedserver/subscriptions/ bottom line cost $799 per seat on up through $2499 - and yes, you
really, really do have to pay RedHat for EVERY server you have running AS).

The Linux solution still wins based simply on the accompanying software licenses... I may plug in the numbers just to make sure - anybody interested?

Hi,
 
I'm about to install and play with Ampoliros/Magellan and Midgard.  I am
looking for a good application server based on PHP.  Perhaps, you guys can
save me the trouble by telling me the pros and cons of the two apps.  Based
on my reading, Midgard seems to have a better architecture, but Ampoliros
has more applications built for it (i.e. Magellan CMS).
 
I'm seeking for a framework that enable even dummies to manage the site.
 
Thanks in advance.
 
Larry

I'm sorry about this Larry et al.  I'm looking into the problem (the message

Good evening,

As noted earlier, there won't be a NYPHP meeting in December due to conflicts
with Christmas.  However, there are still some exciting events this month:

-- The monthly PHP Meetup (http://php.meetup.com) is only two days away, on
12/5 at the Remote Lounge.

-- NYLUG (http://nylug.org) will have it's monthly meeting on 12/18 at
6:30pm.  This month's topic deals with monitoring and managing Linux in the
Enterprise and should be a great talk.

-- Then immediately following NYLUG's meeting, their yearly Holiday Party
takes place at the Old Stand, 914 3rd Ave. and 55th St. and are always a lot
of fun.

NYPHP meetings will resume in January, and any topics of interest for future
talks should be sent to contact at nyphp.org.

Happy Holidays,

Can anyone recommend some decent software to maintain a departmental newsletter?
 
Post/PHP Nuke are a bit overkill - I don't need user authentication, user management, subscription or anything like that... just something simple that will manage articles (that one admin produces),
sections and issues (eg: monthly).

Try PHPLIST.  It's easy to customize and uses a nice templating system 
so you can easily send HTML email newsletters.   The best part is that 
it can handle multiple lists and not send the same newsletter to the 
same person.

Hi all, the company I'm working for is looking to get a part time web dev
person, mainly for work on existing/in progress sites.

Here's the posting as it went up on CL a bit earlier:

--------------------------
YB Services, a full service design & development shop in Midtown, needs a
part time Web Developer comfortable with PHP & MySQL, CSS & HTML.

You will work onsite with our current developer on new and existing
projects, help create and maintain documentation and assist in web & file
server maintenance.

Approximately 20 hours a week, Pays $15/h, high likelihood of more time
involvement if things work well. Scheduling can be flexible/floating.

Please indicate availability (immediate preferred) in your reply.

Please send replies to webjobs at ybservices.com

Just out of curiosity, is this really the going rate for PHP talent these
days? Seems just a bit low, especially with no benefits and the like.

My experience is that that is far below the norm, and I am in a
significantly smaller (and cheaper) city then Manhattan.

Yeah it's low... but we're also not looking for someone who's really "PHP
talent" in the good sense of that term...

It's a job for a studentish type person, really...

For a Jr position, yea I would say that is a little low to about par. 
There is some real talent in the market place today, especially if you 
don't need them "in the office". I've seen some of the PHP developers 
(those with commit privs) doing work for $40/hr. If they can do the 
work of a Jr person in half the time (and probably better quality work) 
I'm willing to pay the extra $10 for that kind of talent.

Wow, $40/hour for the developers with commit privs?

I think that a career in PHP is not in my future :)

that's just a very lowball offer, i make a whole lot more than that
for php consulting.

Keep in mind - it depends on your experience, plain php jobs tend to 
be on the low-side, the idea is to charge for solutions, if php happens
to help you accomplish the job, then great.  Looking to go into the 
industry as a "PHP Programmer" is frankly benign.  Look to get in the 
industry as a programmer, and if PHP is helpful in getting your job 
done, great use it.  If not, use cold fusion, perl, python, php, asp, 
c, c++, java, assembler, whatever tool is best/most suitable for the
task at hand.

Bah.  Certification can just mean you're good at taking tests.  Doesn't 
necessarily reflect real world smarts, discipline, nor research and 
hacking skills.

A good interview, references and coding examples prove far more than any 
certification test.

In fact, requiring certification for a position will likely have you miss
some really star tallent -- like myself :) -- who don't go along with that
paradigm.

Im gonna partly agree with you.  I myself have a few years of JSP, ATG 
Dynamo, [insert your favorite J2EE app server here], but have *yet* to 
land a PHP/MySQL gig (in the middle of a convert project right now), I 
have been so tempted to stay away from certification but without 
employers being EXTREMELY specific on what they are looking for instead 
of jotting down every acronym they have seen in a magazine somewhere, 
what other options do you have?  

Its either:

[Business] needs X, Y, Z
Candidate has done X,Y,Z
Candidate has never done X,Y,Z but certified to know how to do X,Y,Z.

How diverse and broad is PHP for a project?  Extremely, and to me (it 
seems anyway), that if you can SSH ur way into a companies site to do 
work, there should be no questions asked, certification or no 
certification.  So im not complaining, good experience makes up for it 
to some degree but I really wonder how many resumes a biz guy is going 
to get these days that all look the same.

Amen! Well, rather than doing CF I think would rather be strung up  by 
my... ;)  But as much as I am a Unix bigot (Linux, *BSD, Solaris, AIX) 
I have a number of client that use Microsoft server products because 
they are still the best solution for their needs. (What I would give 
for an Open Source replacement for Exchange!) My biggest grip about PHP 
programmer/coders is that PHP is often the only tool they know. As such 
they tend to stuff from "If you only have a hammer, all the world is a 
nail." (I won't even go into my thoughts on php-gtk).

Sure... the same could be said for college, too.

I agree, but requiring a college degree can cause the same problem.  I guess
my point is, while people in-the-know (developers, for instance) know that a
cert. doesn't necessarily signal a person's skill, IT managers and directors
like the piece of paper - the CYA idea, mainly.

I think a PHP cert. would be valuable, not only to those who hold one, but
also to the language, as a confirmation of a technology's seriousness -
again, in the eyes of the manager/director.  This would be a great project,
but very time consuming, IMHO (preparing a test and course material, etc)

Here you make a valid point. And I have sat on both sides of the table, 
something in the same day. Running a  consulting firm means that either 
my resume or the "company resume" needs to make a lasting enough 
impression to get a second look. If you get that second look, you will 
be remembered.

<soapbox position="high and mighty">

Now, as the person sitting behind the desk. I can say most definitely, 
you're resume is nothing more than a bullet list of accomplishments. If 
it's more than two page, 99% chance I won't read it (if it's four or 
more, it won't even get to my desk for review). What *I* want to see on 
a resume is a list of skills, who you worked for and when. That's 
really it. Now if you want to make the "A List" pile (the ones I take 
home and review at dinner/whatever), you *MUST* have a cover letter. I 
want to know 1) what it is you want to do. 2) What it is you have done 
that is related to my project/job. 3) Why you think you would be one of 
my better choice.

Whether applying for a job, or trying to get 'that contract' these 
truism hold. Other points I'll make for those who've read this far.

    o Unless you are applying for position in Europe, don't call your 
resume a CV. You look stupid and ALT-F4 is a fast key stroke.

    o If you put your resume online on your own website, make sure it 
looks the way you want in all browsers. *Nothing* makes you look more 
incompetent for a (PHP|language of choice)/Web job than your own resume 
looking dorked. *Don't* make any assumptions here. I use a Mac running 
OS X. which means I could be in Mozilla, Opera or IE.

    o Make sure those you put down for references are going to give 
*good* references. The law (In CT at least) requires that references be 
giving and checked. If the person you give also able to confirm they 
know you and the dates you where employed you might as well consider 
that a bad reference. (I do)

    o This seems obvious, but don't lie. References are asked pointed 
questions long delays in answers are generally not a good sign.

    o (Personal point here) A letter of recommendation is meaning less. 
I can get ahold of much company stationary and produce as many of those 
as I want
</soapbox>

All in all, have code examples and a working site to point generally 
means more than anything. Certification mean even less to the 
*knowledge* hiring manager.

Over the years Ihave interviewed many many people with certifications -
most of whom I would never employ. As the CIO of a non-profit
organization, as a former system engineer in the private sector, I can say
with complete confidence - certifications have done nothing to improve the
skill sets of tech staff. They have not increased the professionalism of
it workers. Indeed, all I can see is that they have increased is the
profits of computer "schools." I would rather look at experience and
examples of programming as a "certification" that a potential employee has
the stuff needed.

I agree that a resume should make its owner memorable  in the eyes of 
the potential employer. However, it can only be memorable to the 
potential employer if it advertises those qualifications the employer is 
looking for. Additionally, it should meet the length requirements 
desired by the potential employer.  Which brings me to my next point: 
cultural/ international differences in desired resume length and content.

I guess, in America, the shorter the sweeter, right? Additionally, as 
you stated, what is important to you in making a hiring decision is what 
the applicant's skills and experience are like, and if the applicant 
desires to work and is capable of working for you. So, all you would 
like to know is the facts - " just the facts, sir".

In Europe, or more specifically Germany (where I worked recently before 
forming my own web design company in NYC)  a resume is not called a 
resume. It is called a Lebenslauf - i.e. a list of your life-long 
experiences. So, you write your "resume" or Lebenslauf in chronological 
order: where you were born, where you went to high school, where you 
went to college, what you studied, what degree you got, where you worked 
thereafter, hobbies - and at the end, you list your skills. In America, 
you list your skills at the top to avoid "wasting the other person's 
time". In Germany, you have to first establish who you are, where you 
come from and where you have been before you can stand up and announce 
your qualifications. In Germany a normal resume can be 4 pages. The more 
detailed, the better!

I personally like to know more about a person than what he or she can 
"do"; somehow, I am curious as to what makes the person tick, what his 
or her interests are. Maybe I just have not been around long enough to 
learn that all that stuff is really irrelevant - that in the "real" 
world all that counts is what's in your head, what  "added value" you 
can bring to a company. Maybe I have yet to realize that all that it 
comes down to is what is in my head, and if that information can be 
successfully summoned to solve someone else's problems.

But somehow, each time I try to entertain that notion - that it's just 
what I know, not who I am which signifies my human worth - I am forced 
to dismiss it. At the liberal arts college I studied at, the professors 
always mentioned seeing things from different angles; they always asked 
us the think about the big picture. I ask myself , and all of you now 
too: are a person's history, character, personal experiences, personal 
victories and personal failures not of importance too? Are they not part 
of the bigger picture surrounding our professional lives?

- Jay

I think PHP though is just one element, can't have really one without 
the other, for example if you look at this course:

http://gracie.santarosa.edu/web_training/php-cert.shtml

Stating that SQL is mandatory along with Unix admining is not pretty 
neutral in my opinion but there are parts that should be included with a 
PHP Developer certification ... you then have the option that if a 
business required work w/ Oracle vs. MySQL that certification either way 
will not matter, the person w/ more Oracle experience will win out even 
if its against the "better" PHP programmer.  (Would this be true?)  

I think most/some of certifications are such a sham, much like the 
wireless networking exams now, but there are not many options when 
people have not met face to face and a developer is working project to 
project for his paycheck.  Good personality, clean certificate, and a 
smile? :-)

I agree that all of that is important. Yet it can wait to be shown at an
interview. When a position gets 250 applicants, does someone want to
skim through all of that to get to the part where they can see if the
applicant even has the skills necessary for the job? The answer is no. 
First and foremost when applying for a job is whether you can do it. If
your resume clearly shows you can through a skills listing and past
employment, then you should get an interview. 
The interview should contain all the personal experience questions that
allow the hiring person to get a better idea of who the applicant is and
how well they would fit in with the group. Then they can make a decision
on which of the interviewees gets the position.

It's funny that you mention how much PHP is related to other technologies. 
While I was home over Thanksgiving, my dad (who had taught me C in the early
days) had wanted to get a crash course in PHP.  Thinking this would be a good
way to spend some father-son time, I said sure (I expected him to catch on
quickly) but as I began talking about PHP and such, I realized how many
smaller things it's dependant on - SQL, HTML/etc, Apache interaction, MySQL
(in this case) interaction.

In some cases, I think so.  But as many of us have come across, there are
many different facets of PHP - possibly "PHP Designer", "PHP Developer", and
"PHP Architect" (divied up further into Oracle/MySQL/PostGreSQL/etc) tracks? 
Sure, each overlaps a bit, but there really is a focus on signigicantly
different technologies in each area.  And, as I found, trying to teach/learn
PHP, as simply a language, is about exciting and rewarding as
teaching/learning C (ok, I know - it's fun for some).

Sure.  A cert, while ambiguous to the developers themselves, can often cut
through a lot of the uncertainty that an employer has about an employer.

Just weighing in;

Somewhere  I heard that certification simply means one knows enough to
do  damage.  More than anything, it shows you know how to learn, which
is a positive in and of itself.

Personally I found PHP made more sense, and was easier to employ after
I  learned  to  program in JAVA.  Prior to that I could use PHP, but I
really was deficient in a whole slew of areas.

So,  if certification comes around, great, but barring that, if PHP is
the main base of ones knowledge, I'd suggest learning JAVA, or C++, or
any  strongly  typed  language for that matter, leaning more to OOP if
possible.

PHP  is  so  forgiving  in  that it dynamically types everything, it's
incredibly easy to make an error and hunt around for hours looking for
it,   where  if  one  was  more familiar with a stricter language, one
might expend much less effort, and hair, in those situations.

Just my .31 cents ( adjusted for inflation )....

Hey all,

I've been meaning to write a simple debug tracking class for use in my 
own projects. So this week I finally did. I have no clue if anyone else 
would ever use it, or have any interest in looking at it, but I've set 
it up for people to download it if you have any interest. Regardless, I 
would love if people wanted to take a look at it and just give me 
general comments on the code.

http://www.anapraxis.com/os/apxDebug/

What does it do?
It's just a simple tool for logging debug messages from within any 
other php development. Being a MacOS X user for developing and serving, 
I find that many of the nice tools, such as Zend's aren't available for 
real debugging. So I frequently am writing values out to screen for 
debugging. This tool separates them mostly from whatever you are 
working on and let's you classify them, and show/hide groups of them 
when browsing. I've set up a simple online demo, but since it really is 
for development it may be hard to understand without just trying it out 
in your own code.

I've been developing tools for installations on clients intranet 
servers lately too, to where I cannot see in, but they can see out. So 
I have written the tool to both log the debug info to a text file, as 
well as email the logfile to an address through the browser pop-up. 
Right now it only does html emails, but I am working on getting it 
setup to handle plain text and mixed mode as well.

It uses css, dhtml, and javascript for the display so likely requires 
gecko or MSIE 5 or higher. Also, if you are just interested in seeing 
php and javascript work together, it might be a good introduction for 
you, nothing complicated, I just use php to feed in some of the js 
variables.

Anyhow, drop me a line with any questions if you have them, or feature 
requests, I'd love to know if anyone else besides me would actually use 
this thing. :) Oh, and if it just completely screws up for you, let me 
know too. I'd call this a 0.9 beta version, so I'm sure it will find a 
way to surprise me.

Cheers,
Wes

how about something like...

Can you set something like a "setTimeout" feature in fopen? That is, if you
use fopen to open a URL for "scraping", if that URL's server is down or
doesn't respond in x seconds, can you set a feature to show an error message
or a "friendly" error message indicating such?

I agree, but requiring a college degree can cause the same problem.  I guess
my point is, while people in-the-know (developers, for instance) know that a
cert. doesn't necessarily signal a person's skill, IT managers and directors
like the piece of paper - the CYA idea, mainly.

I think a PHP cert. would be valuable, not only to those who hold one, but
also to the language, as a confirmation of a technology's seriousness -
again, in the eyes of the manager/director.  This would be a great project,
but very time consuming, IMHO (preparing a test and course material, etc)

You are right . Brainbench does offer a php 4 test and
they also have a MySQL test coming out soon ..

Nice solution, but sadly, I can't use it, because the script I need to fopen
is not the default script on the host domain's docroot:

<?
  $fp = fsockopen("www3.brinkster.com/soa/val/profile/display.asp", 80);
  if(!$fp) {
   echo "Unable to open\
";
  } else {
   fputs($fp, "GET / HTTP/1.0\
\
");
   $start = time();
   socket_set_timeout($fp, 5);
   $res = fread($fp, 1000000);
   var_dump(socket_get_status($fp));
   fclose($fp);
   echo $res;
  }

?>

This will never open.  :(

Can you set something like a "setTimeout" feature in fopen? That is, if you
use fopen to open a URL for "scraping", if that URL's server is down or
doesn't respond in x seconds, can you set a feature to show an error message
or a "friendly" error message indicating such?

I'm not sure about you, but having the ability to ssh doesn't really 
mean anything to me. I'd say one of the problems with php is that it
is so loose, you don't really have to know anything about 'programming'
to write it. From my experience, as most non-technical management can't
tell the difference between a really skilled coder and someone who can
use words like 'pro-active' and 'methodology'.

I think to truly be qualified you need to understand many things beyond
syntax, which most people don't get. It seems no one even writes code
for high performance and low resource usage any more. Everyone needs 
their hand held through the most basic of exercises. I'm not sure if 
it's just my opinion and current situation, it just seems like a lot
of people who make a living of programming/scripting web applications
have absolutely no idea what they are doing.

I read a good rant which made a lot of sense to me at

You make a number of assertions here, which are not necessarily
related:

1) People write inefficient code.

Yes, that's true. But high-performance/low resource usage isn't always
the best thing. What if making your code highly tuned takes you three
times as long and makes the code completely incomprehensible to anyone
who comes along after you? Like everything else, efficiency is a
trade-off for other things. The problem isn't that people write
inefficient code, it's that they don't know the difference. Much of
"web scripting" is written in a RAD environment and should be written
in such a way that it's fast to code, fast to replace when the
functionality changes, and easy to read. This is not to say that
efficiency should be ignored, but making every last component perform
at its optimum is probably a waste of valuable developer time that
could be better spent on other things (such as writing better comments
and documentation).

2) People don't know what they're doing.

There is a difference between a junior developer and a senior
architect. Similarly, there's a difference between somone who picked
up the PHP-in-24 hours book last week and someone who's deployed
dozens of successful projects. If you're hiring, and you don't know
the difference, your project isn't going to succeed if you're doing
anything remotely complicated. Junior developers have a valuable place
on a development team, but when they're in charge of the development
effort (or solo), it's only natural that their lack of experience is
going to show up in the final product.

> I read a good rant which made a lot of sense to me at
> http://m.bacarella.com/papers/secsoft/html/

There are some good points there, certainly, although most of that is
aimed at admins and systems programmers. A lot of it is just
frustrated ranting that is amusing but not productive.

Ive noticed these comments to come from people in their mid-50, early 
60's who have spent more than 20 years on C/C++ and have absolutely no 
faith in high level languages :-)  Just an observation.  

But I think you are right, the very LAST thing people ever ask when 
designing a web app today is what kind of resources in terms of memory 
requirements, scalability, etc ... I think its just a case of the market 
place that has turned from taking ur time to secure an app to come in, 
deploy tomorrow, fix bugs later if we need you.  I don't think its a 
case of not knowing what u are doing because today (vs. yesterday) there 
are several ways to accomplish one thing, no matter if you are a junior 
developer or senior architect.  There are things that look pretty and 
things that were a late night hack to make it work, but who is to 
decide?  I dont think much has changed, in fact I got an assignment on 
Saturday for a PHP-based quiz for a site launching on Monday, Id like to 
think my options were to figure out how well their php.ini was tweeked 
or how they are setup but its something accomplished last nite for 
peanuts.  Id like to think something like a PHP+ certificate would help 
get more work.    

Thanks for the link, I found it very informative, and enjoy the 
discussion.

I have worked for a technical recruiting (aka headhunter) company for 
the past three years and I can backup the statement below. Also, you 
can't always count on a technical person seeing the resume and 
"understanding" what you have done. At larger firms resumes go through 
Human Resources first as a filter. To them, someone with JDBC, EJB, JSP, 
and J2EE doesn't know Java. But someone with Javascript does. Someone 
with awk, csh, zsh, and grep doesn't know how to write a shell script. 
If they know Solaris, AIX, HP-UX and IRIX they don't know Unix. Etc, 
etc, etc,.

It's not easy to write a resume that spells out everything for a 
non-technical person, yet keeps a technical person from becoming bored 
and still has the required content presented concisely. Really the only 
common ground between human resources and a technical manager is that 
neither wants to read a resume longer than two pages. So where do you 
put all the buzzwords for the search engine? Put a "Key Words" section 
at the bottom of your resume and forget about the "References available 
upon request", of course they are.

It's a good idea to keep multiple "versions" of your resume that cater 
to different reviewers and skill sets.

Well I think you said what I was trying to say a bit better.
I'm not really hard on people for using a " on a static string
rather than a ', but I would like to know they actually know
the difference in how they are parsed. I just feel like more senior
developers do write better code, not only does it work, but it takes
into account a great deal of future expansion, it is usually well 
documented and there is usually a lot of good forethought put into it.

A long while ago at a job I was forced into a bunch of standards by the 
lead developer, which at the time I hated. I didn't see any use for them 
until I got a new job, and was forced to fix an amazing amount of really 
unorganized hacks. At this point I fully understood the need for fully 
commented, peer evaluated code that fit a style guide. Also at this job
the lead developer ignored a good amount of my questions, causing me to 
seek out the answer on my own, via documentation or trial and error.

I think it helped me greatly. I wish some of the people I worked with 
had the initiative to teach themselves some things without needing to 
have someone walk them through the most basic parse errors.

I don't think that document has many uses from a professional 
standpoint, but I did understand his frustration and I did find the 
humor in it, regardless of if I agree with all of his points. =)

I'm 20. heh.
My frustration has come up due to dealing with a large amount of 
developers that have no idea what they are doing. For instance, in a 
content management system, there was a text area where the client could 
enter in text, to be shown over the web. Instead of converting a line 
break character to an html line break tag on insert of the text, it is 
done on every page view. This is just a miniscule piece of the code I 
have been forced to fix over the last 6 months. People who refuse to use 
CVS or anything that doesn?t have a gui. Refuse to learn how to learn 
how to use FTP. It's the small things, they add up quickly.

I think certification could be a good tool, but someone else made a very 
valid point, PHP alone isn't really a challenge, but you would need to 
quiz on SQL/HTML etc. It would be kind of like having JavaScript 
certification without mentioning the DOM, it's something else entirely.

I've been asked to post process a canned HTML screen that has
multiple named forms on it. I'm pulling a complete blank on
how to get the name of the form the submit button was clicked on.
Isn't this an HTML variable???

Hi,

My personal opinion is 'real Open Source developers doesn't need cert'. Just like any other
issues, OSS philosophy developed its own unique 'certification way' by means of 'pet projects'. 
Since most of the OSS developers already developing some sort of 'pet projects' for their own,
this indicates what level of knowledge they have. Certifications are for developers who don't have
any reference sites or apps to show, and/or doesn't have education background related to the field
at all. If you're talented and know how to express yourself, guy sitting accross the table on an
inverview will going to notice your talent. If they can't notice your capabilities, you don't even
need to show a certification :-))
I suggest recruitters to look for the ones with pet projects instead of certification.

PS: I don't have pet project(I can't even call it pet project)

Best

Hi,

As for cert tests, I'd probably do terrible.  I can never remember the
specific syntax.  But I can remember "how" to do something, or at least I
can figure out an approach to try.  Then I look at the object model to see
the specific syntax for that event, method, etc.  That is think is more
important - The Logic.  How does everything tie in together.  Where should
things be done -- client side, server side, business-logic-tier, etc.

As for junior developers not knowing everything . . . isn't that why they
are "junior" level?

Experience comes from experience!  Two people in the same situation will
take the experience differently.  One will sit around whining and say "I
never learned that . . . you don't pay me enough." and another one will
spend the time to figure it out, looking through books or API's online, or
posting questions on forums.

My $0.04 worth ($0.02 invested in dotcoms that went to $5.00 then back
down to $0.04!!!)

This is not true. I worked for a  major company that would not even consider
you for an interview unless you had passed the Brainbench PHP certification
test at the master level. In fact they hired directly off of this test. They
needed three developers, and surprise the three developers they hired just
happen to have the top three scores on this test for the state. To this
hiring manager, nothing else mattered but the score on this particular test.
Luckily for me, I was one of those top three in my state. But this is beside
the point, I did have plenty of work to show, both online and submitted to
them, it simply did not matter without a "Master" level score on this test,
they refused to even interview me until I took the test even after seeing
very high quality code, which leads me to your next point.

This is all fine and dandy as long as you know how to get to the right
person (you have inside connections etc., you have done an exceptional job
at networking and on and on) and you actually get to sit down across the
table from them. The problem though, is that much like the above example,
you never get to sit down across the table from the guy that matters. Every
job that I have made it that far, I have been given an offer. The problem is
getting to the right person and getting that opportunity to sit across the
table.

All too often resumes are screened out because they do not have a particular
certification etc., and then you never get that chance to actually impress a
person with what matters, yourself. This in my mind is the real issue
concerning certifications. It has nothing to do with wether you know a
particular technology, it is just an unfortunate thing you have to deal with
to get passed the ignorance that so often plagues the human resources dept.

Just my 2 cents.

Alan

Happy Holidays everyone,

      Does      anyone      have      any      Application      Design
      texts/primers/white-papers etc they can recommend?

      As my projects become more ambitious I'm definitely in need of a
      framework of some sort.

      Thanks in advance,

      Pete

No.  The option I'd use is to use different values for the submit buttons.  
For example...

form for adding record...
   <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Add" />

form for updating record...
   <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Update" />

Similarly, you can add hidden form elements.

Oh, and of course, you can have the various forms be submitted to 
different scripts.

Or... :) you can add a query string to the form's action...
   <form method="post" action="script.php?source=firstform">

Enjoy,

What exactly are you looking for? Code style guidelines? A primer on
OOD? Data storage design? Network protocols? The list goes on...

The "right way" to build an application tends to differ depending on
what kind of an application it is.

Of course, doing all that is contingent on being able to modify the HTML
forms, which, from your question, I gather you can't do.  Your only other
real option is to look at what elements you DO get back, and try to pick a
processing routine based on that (e.g. if I have A & B but not C, use the
processing code for form 2).  That's a huge pain in the butt, but that's
HTML for ya.

No.  The option I'd use is to use different values for the submit buttons.  
For example...

form for adding record...
   <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Add" />

form for updating record...
   <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Update" />

Similarly, you can add hidden form elements.

Oh, and of course, you can have the various forms be submitted to 
different scripts.

Or... :) you can add a query string to the form's action...
   <form method="post" action="script.php?source=firstform">

Enjoy,

*All* the  forms have the same &^$^% names for the elements. Talk about
frigging poor design. "The forms are named to make post-processing easy."
Right. Idiots.

It's a custom app, not on our servers, and the entity that developed
it will *not* make any changes.

Sounds like time to find another vendor or write a complete application 
yourself.  They're clearly amateurs who'll continue to give you headaches 
for the rest of your relationship.

If I understand correctly, there are multiple forms on a single page. 
The form elements have the same name on each form. What about the actual 
name of the form?

Couldn't you test which form is being submitted by the form name? Of 
course, that assumes they didn't name all the forms the same also. I may 
be way off track but, just a thought.

That's what I'm trying to do. My question is *how* to do this in PHP.
I'm completely stumped on this one. Mainly because this is so stupid
that I have do this, and I'm pissed.

Some people were talking about getting their resumes past non-competent HR
people.  Here's what i do:

Since they may not know that JDBC and J2EE are Java, I could write:

- Java (JDBC, J2EE, Swing . . .)

Since they may not know SQL is used with Oracle, I could write:

- SQL (Oracle 8i, MySQL, . . .)

This also has the added benefit of organizing things.

The problem is, the name of the form does not get passed to the action page,
only the form elements and their values do.  So if all the elements are
named the same and they all appear in each form, there's no way to tell them
apart.

The talk actually gave me a better idea ... I figured to make a 
resume.xml file with all my projects and include a link to dynamically 
create the resume w/ different formats & info (filter), maybe overkill 
but might help:

resume/?java+sql
resume/?php+mysql
etc, etc, etc.

I saw a "Human Resources Markup Language" but looked completely outdated.

Look, this is straightforward.  On the receiving page, all you have is 
the form variables and the action= URL.  That's it.  If there's a 
difference between those variables, you can tell the forms apart.  If 
not, you can't.  Period, full stop.  If someone writes an (idiotic) form 
like this:

----------------------------------------

Enter employee ID to fire:

<FORM ACTION="process.cgi">
<INPUT NAME="ID" TYPE="text">
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="submit">
</FORM>

Enter employee ID to promote:

<FORM ACTION="process.cgi">
<INPUT NAME="ID" TYPE="text">
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="submit">
</FORM>

----------------------------------------

... then you can't tell them apart, period.  Quit trying.  It's their

What are the tags used to distinguish say Java from J2EE, JDBC?  Could you
use main_technology and sub_technology?

This xml idea is pretty interesting!

I'm always spending time re-writing my resume for a particular job.  It
seems to take forever.  If all my jobs, skills, accomplishments, etc. were
in xml, I could easily create a 1 page resume that focused on a specific
position!

I thought about this too.. But would you be able to address the forms like this on the 'submit' page?

Aren't these only available where the forms themselves are? If yes, then we're back to "I can't modify the HTML".

This is only useful on the page that has the originating form, not the

I've been working on a fairly general cma generator application for
editing relational data structures. This is not a CMS, but it does
provide some CMS capability. 

I'm releasing the source for the PHP version for non-commercial use,
so please download it and let me know what you think.

The first public alpha code package and documentation are available
here:

http://www.surgam.net/fields/cmacs

Any comments are welcomed.

Enjoy!

Are you taking form input directly from this HTML page somewhere, or
are you just not allowed to change it?

If the latter, you should be able to wrap it in a frameset and insert
hidden variables into the different forms with an onload handler.

I'm taking the input from the page.

Then you can't do it, as has been noted elsewhere. Either they're
passing you the name of the form or they're not. If they're not, you
can't get it.

Hi everyone- this is my first post to the list, and I'm a newbie to PHP, so if
I'm clueless please forgive me- but, I'm thinking you could write a javascript
handler that loops through all the forms on the page and writes the values to
unique variables that it then passes to a PHP handler in a URL, ie:
location='handler.php?f01Input01=foo&f02Input01=bar'

Do you have access to the route used to get to the forms page?

I'm thinking you might be able to wrap their html in a frame, and address
the forms, as Jessica described, from a script within the frame.

This also suggests just pulling in their html file into your PHP, and
inserting the hidden fields you need at specific points...

That happens on the HTML side of things.. on the form page itself. He does not have access to that as far as I understand. If he had access, there's more straight forward ways to do it.

You make a number of assertions here, which are not necessarily
related:

1) People write inefficient code.

Yes, that's true. But high-performance/low resource usage isn't always
the best thing. What if making your code highly tuned takes you three
times as long and makes the code completely incomprehensible to anyone
who comes along after you? Like everything else, efficiency is a
trade-off for other things. The problem isn't that people write
inefficient code, it's that they don't know the difference. Much of
"web scripting" is written in a RAD environment and should be written
in such a way that it's fast to code, fast to replace when the
functionality changes, and easy to read. This is not to say that
efficiency should be ignored, but making every last component perform
at its optimum is probably a waste of valuable developer time that
could be better spent on other things (such as writing better comments
and documentation).

2) People don't know what they're doing.

There is a difference between a junior developer and a senior
architect. Similarly, there's a difference between somone who picked
up the PHP-in-24 hours book last week and someone who's deployed
dozens of successful projects. If you're hiring, and you don't know
the difference, your project isn't going to succeed if you're doing
anything remotely complicated. Junior developers have a valuable place
on a development team, but when they're in charge of the development
effort (or solo), it's only natural that their lack of experience is
going to show up in the final product.

 > I read a good rant which made a lot of sense to me at

There are some good points there, certainly, although most of that is
aimed at admins and systems programmers. A lot of it is just
frustrated ranting that is amusing but not productive.

Well I think you said what I was trying to say a bit better.
I'm not really hard on people for using a " on a static string
rather than a ', but I would like to know they actually know
the difference in how they are parsed. I just feel like more senior
developers do write better code, not only does it work, but it takes
into account a great deal of future expansion, it is usually well
documented and there is usually a lot of good forethought put into it.

A long while ago at a job I was forced into a bunch of standards by the
lead developer, which at the time I hated. I didn't see any use for them
until I got a new job, and was forced to fix an amazing amount of really
unorganized hacks. At this point I fully understood the need for fully
commented, peer evaluated code that fit a style guide. Also at this job
the lead developer ignored a good amount of my questions, causing me to
seek out the answer on my own, via documentation or trial and error.

I think it helped me greatly. I wish some of the people I worked with
had the initiative to teach themselves some things without needing to
have someone walk them through the most basic parse errors.

I don't think that document has many uses from a professional
standpoint, but I did understand his frustration and I did find the
humor in it, regardless of if I agree with all of his points. =)

Subject: Introduction to PHP @ New School
Message-ID: <NFBBJNKBNKCIKGKJIFPJEEICEEAA.sklar@sklar.com>

As an addendum to the thread a little while ago about PHP training, I
thought I'd mention the class I'm teaching this spring at the New School.
They've finally put up their Spring 2003 schedule online, so here's a link
for more info:
--> http://www.nsu.newschool.edu/spring03/comp5.htm#NCIC1522

Also, I suppose while I'm in commercial mode I'll mention that the O'Reilly
PHP Cookbook that Adam Trachtenberg and I wrote is now out and in stock at
various online bookstores. I haven't seen it in any offline bookstores yet,

Subject: An Action Item App or Help Desk App...
Message-ID: <E7F20B466062D511973800508B6DBC6C360394@MDRCI-C02-EXCH>

Evening gang,

Recently I became disenchanted with an application I was using to track web
job assignments by all of my staff.  This ColdFusion/Oracle web app. acted
like a help desk where customers could input requested changes, updates or
corrections directly.  My staff could also enter these actions themselves to
handle phone requests, emails  or other "non-web" requests.

We could then track these items, hand them off to each other, and allow the
users to see where thier issue was in the process.  Finally we could close
the issues and later get metrics on how quick we were.

Three issues:

1) Not scalable without kickin' in a lot of cash for additional users.

2) No option for sub-tasks below the main task.  THis makes sence because it
was made to be a help desk app., so it was MEANT to deal with the opening,
working and closing of discret tasks.  But we need a little more...

3) The CF was encoded, so I couldn't change it to do our bidding.  I know
whatever I get will need at least a wee bit o' customization.


So... my question to you.  Anyone know of a LAMP (actually NETBSD AMP, but
now I'm quibbling) product out there that will let me do the Help Desk for
your Web Clients thing?  I'm going to set it up on my own NetBSD server and
if the powers that be like it... we'll get them to set up a Linux server for
our use.

I'd like it to be something that one of you has some faith in... or a couple
of products that I can test against each other and make an informed
decision.

THanks for you imput.  Also... sorry about the spelling.  I'm sending this
from a web mail client without the bells & whistles.

Larry,

The class is 12 sessions, so there's time to cover a broad range of topics.

Here are the topic headings from my syllabus:

Language Basics
Arrays, Functions, Objects
Forms
Cookies & Sessions
Regular Expressions
Databases
Dates and Times
Security & Encryption
XML (and SOAP)

(There are less than twelve items there because "Databases" spans two
classes, there's a midterm exam, and the last class is devoted to talking
about the term projects that the students have been working on.)

Message-ID: <BA1E270D.9CCD%jim@nettmedia.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to move a group of sites from an internal overburdened server to
a new colocated server.

I'm having a few problems with some PHP commands that don't want to work on
the new environment.

1. The mail() command no longer works. Although I can send mail using
popen() to communicate directly with sendmail.

2. My fsockopen() behaves differently. For certain reasons, I need to
connect to a mail server and an ftp server via a socket. These
communications no longer work. It appears to have something to do with the
line endings.

3. When connecting via FTP (not through PHP), it takes 20-30 seconds to
connect. Once connected everything works great and I can navigate through
directories as quickly as shell. I included this oddity because it seems
related.

The server configuration is similar but not identical. I realize this isn't
enough information to work with, but I'm hoping that maybe someone has dealt
with this situation before. Or maybe someone could just give me some general
areas to inspect.

Here's some info on the servers:

            OLD             NEW
System      SunOS 5.8       Linux 2.4.2-2
PHP         4.1.2           4.2.2

Hi Jim:

For a quick comparision of what's going on between the servers, do a 
phpinfo() call inside a script or execute "php -i > phpinfo.htm" on each 
of the servers and compare the difference.

I suspect the new server might have safe_mode on or might be an apache 
module as opposed to CGI.

On the new server, you might be able to use their CGI with your php.ini 
file or build your own php for CGI use.

Good luck,

Hi,

I'm trying to move a group of sites from an internal overburdened server to

I'm having a few problems with some PHP commands that don't want to work on
the new environment.

1. The mail() command no longer works. Although I can send mail using
popen() to communicate directly with sendmail.
Your sendmail.mc might be pointing to a specific address (?) - usually on
this line: DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=smtp,Addr=x.x.x.x, Name=MTA')
If that is the case, correct it accordingly.  It'll solve #2 problem as
well.


2. My fsockopen() behaves differently. For certain reasons, I need to
connect to a mail server and an ftp server via a socket. These
communications no longer work. It appears to have something to do with the
line endings.

3. When connecting via FTP (not through PHP), it takes 20-30 seconds to
connect. Once connected everything works great and I can navigate through
directories as quickly as shell. I included this oddity because it seems
related.
Some FTP daemons need to auth with port 113 and it tries to look for a DNS
server.  That's why you are experiencing the latency.  Try to REM out the
flag in FTP conf file or in the loader script (inet or xnet?).

The server configuration is similar but not identical. I realize this isn't
enough information to work with, but I'm hoping that maybe someone has dealt
with this situation before. Or maybe someone could just give me some general
areas to inspect.

Message-ID: <200212121843.NAA12492@gw00.com>

<Unix>

	Just installed the 4.2.3 PHP Windows package, to use with IIS on 
NT Server 4, and it mostly works, but about 1 time out of 20, the server
fails with a HTTP 500 (Server Error), saying something like
"The remote procedure call failed."

	Checking the server logs, the following line would appear in the
failure case:

63.76.212.75 - - [12/Dec/2002:13:10:44 -0500] "GET /gwebb.php?Out-of-process ISAPI extension request failed. HTTP/1.1" 502 0

	What else can we do to figure out this occasional problem?  It
appears the CGI version of PHP runs 100%, so the problem seems to be with
the ISAPI version.  If we can't figure it out, I guess we'd be better off
running the CGI version entirely, wouldn't you agree?

	There are warnings in the INSTALL.TXT file about how "unstable"
is the ISAPI version.  So do you think that is the inherent problem?

	Although I strongly dislike Windows, getting PHP to work on this
particular (legacy) web site is a significant step forward!  Thanks for
your help!

Search phpinfo() output for sendmail and smtp.  Make sure sendmail_path is
correct, and that the UID PHP/Apache is running as can execute it.  And watch
sendmail's logs to see what's going on.  /var/log/maillog and the -X switch
to sendmail can be helpful.

In what way?  What do errno and errstr say?

Hmm, odd, maybe:

Yeah, maybe everything is just timing out.  Check DNS responsiveness, rDNS
setup, and /var/log/messages and /var/logl/maillog.  Do you see this behavior
with all protocols? (ie lynx http://google.com)

I'd try to run with a newer kernel, uhh, like 2.4.18.  Or maybe your colo
facility's link is just saturated :)

I'm currently using bway.net.

Pros:

* They have a very liberal TOS. I'm hosting several low-volume servers
currently, no issues.

* They will (in my case, anyway), agree to put in a reverse DNS value of
your choosing. Very good for mail apps.

* Speed and reliability are generally good.

Cons:

* Cost. Very expensive - $100/month for what you're looking for.

* No 24x7 support. If your connection goes down at night or weekends,
you'd better hope that someone is checking the messages. I've had a couple
of lengthy outages with them.

I'm pleased overall, but may shop another provider once my year ends
(which is this month). I'm looking at pilosoft.com, who gets a lot of
thumbs-up from the NYLUG folks.

	Update: Another bummer is that after a certain number

with some complaint about no more resources!  So that's
rather unfortunate.

	Again, the CGI version does not seem to cause such
problems.

	Any suggestions on things to check or upgrade would

I don't know about the PHP problems but can only assume your dealing with a
different compile with different features enabled/disabled.

For the FTP delay, I experience the same problem with my provider back a few
months ago.  It turns out it was a problem with the management software, I
forget what the management software is called or who makes it, but the
client end of the management software is called cpanel.  My provider applied
an update to the software and the login delay went away on FTP.

Hmm, this is a toughy.  I seem to remember some things coming up surrounding
this, either on PHP-DEV or as a bug somewhere.

http://www.zend.com/zend/week/week114.php#Heading6

and http://bugs.php.net/search.php searching for ISAPI in all bugs.

Yeah, that makes sense, I guess.

I'd try 4.3RC3 (http://qa.php.net/) which has just been released, and is
probably pretty stable.  I've been playing with 4.4 from CVS and even that's
stable (although I have no idea as for Windows).

I currently have AceDSL and couldn't be happier, but if pilosoft.com had
offered DSL when I was in the market, I'd gone with him.  As Oktay mentioned,
Alex (pilosoft.com) is often on NYLUG-Talk and active in the local community;
and I can personally vouch for his technical and support repertoire.

I have heard of a similar problem about moving applications between servers. 
  The problem that I have from before was that the mail server was having 
problem looking at new-lines.  I hope that might give you some hint.

Hi,

I'm trying to move a group of sites from an internal overburdened server to
a new colocated server.

I'm having a few problems with some PHP commands that don't want to work on
the new environment.

1. The mail() command no longer works. Although I can send mail using
popen() to communicate directly with sendmail.

2. My fsockopen() behaves differently. For certain reasons, I need to
connect to a mail server and an ftp server via a socket. These
communications no longer work. It appears to have something to do with the
line endings.

3. When connecting via FTP (not through PHP), it takes 20-30 seconds to
connect. Once connected everything works great and I can navigate through
directories as quickly as shell. I included this oddity because it seems
related.

The server configuration is similar but not identical. I realize this isn't
enough information to work with, but I'm hoping that maybe someone has dealt
with this situation before. Or maybe someone could just give me some general
areas to inspect.

Here's some info on the servers:

             OLD             NEW
System      SunOS 5.8       Linux 2.4.2-2
PHP         4.1.2           4.2.2

Thanks!
Jim

<Unix>

	Just installed the 4.2.3 PHP Windows package, to use with IIS on
NT Server 4, and it mostly works, but about 1 time out of 20, the server
fails with a HTTP 500 (Server Error), saying something like
"The remote procedure call failed."

	Checking the server logs, the following line would appear in the
failure case:

63.76.212.75 - - [12/Dec/2002:13:10:44 -0500] "GET /gwebb.php?Out-of-process 
ISAPI extension request failed. HTTP/1.1" 502 0

	What else can we do to figure out this occasional problem?  It
appears the CGI version of PHP runs 100%, so the problem seems to be with
the ISAPI version.  If we can't figure it out, I guess we'd be better off
running the CGI version entirely, wouldn't you agree?

	There are warnings in the INSTALL.TXT file about how "unstable"
is the ISAPI version.  So do you think that is the inherent problem?

	Although I strongly dislike Windows, getting PHP to work on this
particular (legacy) web site is a significant step forward!  Thanks for
your help!

I have the following line:

$startTime + $time);
if (!$file){
 echo "Timed out, try again later";
} else {
 // do stuff
}

Problem is, when it attempts to connect to the remote server, it's supposed
to time out after 2-5 seconds, but it doesn't, it just locks up :(  Any
suggestions?

1. I don't see that you assign anything to $time and also you are not 
incrementing it.
2. To do while loop like this is very dangerous. (Might cause you to open a 
lot of file pointer to the same file)
3. Maybe you can use a socket instead.

Oh sorry..

$time = time();

And I can't use sockets, I tried and it produced nasty errors.. I can only
do it this way, but I might change the while to an if

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Fw: PHP script needs to timeout upon FOPEN to URL
Message-ID: <F129wHoRRZhn3UnGreF0001a3af@hotmail.com>

I don't think this will work at all.  PHP is a server side include scripting 
language.  This means that the everything is eventually parse into text and 
send to the browser.

You are trying to keep track of time, but when you send to the broswer it 
became static.

I think you should try to get the socket working.

Oh sorry..

$time = time();

And I can't use sockets, I tried and it produced nasty errors.. I can only
do it this way, but I might change the while to an if

hello all,

I've been evaluation quite a few PHP programs (mainly bug tracking and
helpdesk software, but other things too) and I find that there are many
problems with version and server configuration incompatibilities.  

1.  Version incompatibilities example:
     the software was developed on PHP 3.x or 4.0.x.  It depends on
     get and post variables being globals (PHP 3.x) or in the 
     $HTTP_GET_VARS or $HTTP_POST_VARS arrays (deprecated
     in PHP 4.2.x).

2.  Server configuration incompatibilities example:
     Software was developed for the same version of PHP that it is
     to be deployed on, but the deployment server uses safe_mode,
     or register_globals_off, while the code assumes that register_globals
     is on.

Those are just the most common incompatibilities.  There are many more
incompatibilities possible, and combinations of incompatibilities too, since
some configuration settings and version differences will interact with
many other settings and differences.

It is possible (but unpleasant and undesirable) to hack the code to make
it work with the deployment configuration.  This is undesirable though,
because when the next version comes out, the same code hacking would
have to be done.

The patches could be sent to the author of the software, but it might not be
applied.  Even if applied, the code gets complicated because there will be
version checks everywhere.  there will also be checks as to whether a 
setting is set correctly, and if not, then calls made to ini_set(...) or
import_request_variables(...) or need to set up per-directory php.ini
files, etc).

My question is, is there a standard (or even just an emerging standard) on
how to deal with these issues in PHP code?  is there a recommended library
of functions that does all these checks (e.g., Do_PHP30_Compat() or 
something similar) so that PHP 3.0 standard global variable behavior
works.  

A discussion of best practices would be interesting.  My particular 
interest, though, is in what the emerging standard (tending to actually 
be used by PHP developers of important projects) is. 

I've tried to install maybe 8 different bug tracking systems.  Some of them
are perl (most were rejected because they lacked the features i wanted),
many were PHP (most were rejected because i'm using PHP 4.2 and most of
them won't work with 4.2 with default security but not in safe_mode.  i could
get them to work, but that would require massive modification of the code).

I've got bugzilla working.  It's rather too much for what I need, but it *is*
working, and I can deal with it.  I'd like to stay with PHP products though
since i know php and i can't stand perl.

But of course this isn't really about bugtracking or helpdesk software.
It's a general question involving the evolution of best practices in
the development of PHP software.

Your issues can be easily addressed by editing the php.ini file.

; You should do your best to write your scripts so that they do not require
; register_globals to be on;  Using form variables as globals can easily lead
; to possible security problems, if the code is not very well thought of.
; ##### JMD: This is set to On in Mandrake because a lot of existing scripts
; needs it to be on, and we don't want to break configuration. Turning
; it on is a Bad Thing (tm), but for the sake of compatibility and less
; technical support, we'll close our eyes ;-)
register_globals = On

AND

; Safe Mode
;
safe_mode = Off

Someone else could probably tell you what the exact revision number was in 
which they changed the default register_globals setting -- the reason for the 
change, as outlined above, was for additional security.

Just curious, what don't you like about Perl?  I started in Perl and find the 
two so similar that it was an easy transition.  Perl is a little more 
stringent in its requirements but that is not a bad thing IMHO.

I don't think that is the question he was asking... although changing the
php.ini file will possibly provide a way of working around the errors he was
having...

The question isn't focusing entirely on the specific problems with those
pieces of software, but more of a standard that he believes should be formed
to keep things current with each other and to ensure that problems like this
won't happen due to previous versions of software, which is an age-old
concern that gets to everyone at some point.

-Brad.

it's not so easy.  i run many different programs.  they have
different requirements in php.ini.  mostly i can deal since they
rarely conflict.  but i'd like to run the sites as securely as
possible.  that means disallowing per-directory php.inis,
register_globals=off and safe_mode.  and then stuff breaks.
clients want to run their own different programs.  and they
won't pay for their own box.  so we have to all have them
run on a common box.  what a mess.

even on my notebook, where i have total control, i can't
change php.ini settings willy nilly because while i can get the
current application to run, other applications will stop running
or would become insecure (not a problem on my notebook,
but a porting problem later if the code i write depends on those 
settings and my web server is set up to be more secure than my
notebook).

> ; You should do your best to write your scripts so that they do not require
> ; register_globals to be on;  

i wasn't posting about my scripts.  i already write my scripts for safe_mode
and the PHP 4.2.x default settings (with some stricter settings too, like,
uh, safe_mode).  i was asking about other scripts, lots of which can
be downloaded, and none of which (of the not so many, but n>5 i've tested 
so far) will run unmodified with the settings mentioned above.

is there even an understanding in the PHP world that there might be a
problem with the current situation and that a solution is needed?  either
that or perl will win.  as i noted, i've got bugzilla (royal pain that it is
to install notwithstanding) running.  and i have not got a single PHP
bugtracking system running correctly yet (mainly because of the
register_globals requirement, they were written for 3.x, 4.0.x etc).

thanks for the info :).  i compile my own PHP on Mandrake, because
i need DBG to work, and i don't know how to get DBG to work with
Mandrake's PHP.  easier to just install my own PHP and apache
in /usr/local.

the info is useful though, for reference, and so i know to turn it off
on production sites.  thanks again.

there *is* a similarity, i agree. PHP was just easier for me since it
looks so much more like C.  i can't stand the line noise that some
perl looks like.  but that's just me.  i'm sure if i worked on perl enough 
i'd learn it pretty quickly and use it.  even the line noise i'd get used 
to eventually :).

I completely agree with you, Gerald.

    There is no direct, easy way of making everything compatible with
everything else. It's not your fault, obviously -- it's just a lack of
thought on the other programmer's side.

    Changing the php.ini file around on the fly for specific applications
isn't really a feasible idea, and I realize that. It's an age old problem,
and it just boils down to programmers writing crappy, incompatible code.

-Bradley.

i was looking at ini_set, but i don't think ini_set will do anything about
register_globals. by the time ini_set is called, even if it resets
register_globals (untested), it won't do it because the globals will
already have been or not been registered (purely theoretical...
i am entirely open to correction on this one :).

i'm trying to think of a good way to approach this.  some obvious
approaches (starting with the most common, register_globals :):

1.  for any configuration issue/parameter that can be handled by 
Directory specific php.ini's, provide a directory specific php.ini.
e.g.  register_globals is indicated in the PHP documentation to
be PHP_INI_PERDIR or PHP_INI_SYSTEM.  

** EXCEPTION ** unfortunately (i have not read any specs, just 
tested on my box), it looks like, if PHP_INI_SYSTEM's setting is *set*, 
then PHP_INI_PERDIR does not matter.  that is, it's ignored.  can 
anyone confirm? so, in order to use a register_globals = On in per 
directory mode, the global register_globals setting needs to be 
undefined?

2.  for register_globals, perhaps a standard function to call which
does what register globals does.  or which just registers the
variables in the current scope (e.g., via extract) if the function
is called within a function, in which case it should not register
a global).

3.  other functions (mainly calling ini_set(...) probably) which programs
can call from some include file.  e.g., init_compat.inc.php or something.
the init_compat.inc.php just sets user-settable things which override
global php.ini settings.

what other approaches might work?  and will software authors (e.g.,
the author of php-nuke, MOT (Ministry of Truth), otasks, phphelpdesk,
PHPTroubleTicket, techtables) accept such suggestions?

heh, i'm willing to assume the last.  in any case, i figure, if someone
sends them patches, and the patches work after testing, then perhaps
they'll get integrated into the final code.

by the way, what debuggers do you all use?  i use DBG and
maguma studio lite (running under win4lin, which gives me win98/ME
running on the same linux notebook as the web server).

Gerald,
    I'm afraid there is no "real" definite solution to your issue, you can
look into the code, and try to tweak it so that it would work -- but there
is no magical code that you can feed it to make everything work. The problem
is incompatibility, and where there is compatibility issues, there is always
lack-of-thought. Not your fault.
    Given that it is a common issue, that effects more then what you're
saying here -- I'm sure your comments would be welcomed by the developers of
whatever software you are using. I suggest dropping them a line, and seeing
what they have to say about it.
    Not too much more can be done, since we don't live in a perfect world.
Sucks, eh?
-Brad.

	It sounds to me like the best solution is per-directory php.ini files,
preferably distributed with the source code itself.  Maybe a "install script"
would have to "configure" the php.ini file to make it compatible with your
server.

	Even if the author would simply include *their* php.ini file with
no explanation, it might help the installer (you or me) to troubleshoot
or prevent problems.  So if your program's distribution doesn't come with
its own php.ini file, perhaps at least you could get the author to email
you a copy of his/her own php.ini file which is known to be compatible.
Then you could just tweak that file.

	MAGIC_QUOTES_* is another one to watch out for.

	Even better scripts can test for these "critical" .ini options,
and either override them or work around them.

	Or of course *you* could make these improvements and contribute
them back to the project!

What could be the best practice, best defensive programming regarding 
this situation when you write your own programs? Anyone have 
suggestions or pointers.

I started this September with PHP and I was really bitten by the 
differences in version between 4.0.6/4.1.2

For example I had to write/install a PHP module for a client running 
unfortunately 4.0.6 while I was developing on my staging server on 
4.1.2. I fall in all the traps regarding the differences in scope 
with $HTTP_GET_VARS and $_GET. That's ok, I was beginning to learn 
the language.

But I find quite astonishing that key_exists() doesn't work anymore 
on 4.1.2 (you have to use instead array_key_exists 
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-key-exists.php>). So I 
had to write a wrapper for this functionality.

function keyexists ($key, $array) {
     $keyexists;
     if ( function_exists ( "key_exists" ) ) {
         $keyexists = key_exists;
     } else {
             $keyexists = array_key_exists;
     }
     if ( $keyexists ( $key, $array ) ) {
         return true ;
     } else {
             return false;
     }
}

Why in the world key_exists was not aliased to array_key_exists and 
flagged as deprecated in 4.1.2?

Cheers

hi all,
on the off chance that someone is still checking this list-- i'm working on
a freelance project over break, designing a community site for a network of
youth groups around the country.

i have a few things to put out there:
1. a possible position for a JSP/mySQL programmer-- please write back if you
have experience

2. some suggestions of sample community sites with loads of dynamic
functionality including collaborative work areas (real-time text, image, +
object manipulation).

3. i'm considering using the flash communication server... anyone have any
experience with it or suggestions for other options for the type of
functionality listed above?

many thanks... hope to hear from some of you.  have a great break!! and see
you on the flipside.

cheers,

While there are exceptions, generally a well-written application will:

1) Set it's environment explicitly, through ini_set() for example.
2) Document what it's environment requirements are.
3) Allow for a configuration process, where the application adjusts to your
environment.
4) Perform runtime checks that changes program-flow, etc.

While none of these are perfect, in such a hetergenous environment that PHP
is often required to work in, they are needed.  If a script can't adjust to
it's environment (and it's meant as an end-user program, for distribution)
don't use it - or, help the developers perfect their application.  The bar
needs to be raised, and tolerance of rinky-dink scripts needs to be
decreased.

> is there even an understanding in the PHP world that there might be a

Yes and no, but the 'current situation' is broad.  Well written applications
generally can work in an assortment of environments, and will allow for
configuration, which is always nessecary (otherwise we'd be out of work). 
But again, you should not bend over backwards to support callow scripts.

register_globals will be something that haunts PHP for some time.  I suggest
not using applications that depend on register_globals, and if so inclined,
offer patches to the developers, so that we can rid ourselves of this
tomfoolery.

No it's not.

All this said, PHP could use a general standard, or best-practice spec. to
increase portability.  This has come up on the list before, but as always,
there aren't enough hours in the day.

Subject: improving php+mysql performance  at blogyourdesign.com
Message-ID: <3DFE1C87.7010503@netscape.net>

Hello all,

I have recently set up a site called blogyourdesign.com ( link: 
http://www.blogyourdesign.com ), which is a site for designers to review 
each others' designs. I have several questions about the site; however, 
before I ask them, here is a quick backgrounder on how the site runs: I 
use a small (5 kilobytes) , open source weblog system, called Rodin, 
which can be found at:  http://rodin.lot23.com/about/ . Rodin uses the 
"dynamic duo" : PHP and MySQL. Since I am more of a designer person than 
a database guru, I just followed their setup instructions for the 
database (using PHPmyadmin), and then plugged my own "theme" into Rodin.

It all worked perfectly the first time I tried it (knock on wood), *but* 
the main problem is that the site often loads slowly. I use Yahoo's 
Webhosting for this particular project, so my question is: is it slow 
because Yahoo has millions of customers sharing its PHP and MySQL 
resources, or because (I think) Rodin does not "cache" the output?

Also, a second, but less important (for now) question is : would anyone 
know how to write a commenting module for this system. I am trying to 
learn more about using PHP with MySQL everyday, so maybe in some time 
I'd be able to do that myself. But if any of you have some good ideas, I 
will definitely use them.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,

- Jay Sheth

Guys-

Ok, here's an apache config question for you.

Is it possible to assign a variable in apache. For
example

I would like to make a "home" variable that points
to c:\\home\\webpub\\

I could then use this variable in other
configuration file (like virtual hosts) to point
to individual directories using  DocumentRoot home
. "usersdirectory\\public"

Is this possible to do in apache?

	As for a "standard" how about the "php.ini-recommended"
file usually included with the PHP distribution?  I don't know
how much it changes from release to release, but it probably
changes only most conservatively.  Furthermore, PHP scripts
might do well to be aware of the changes within this file
(e.g. the whole register_globals saga...).

	Since PHP scripts usually are quite configuration-
dependent, it would make sense to distribute a PHP application
with its own (per-directory) php.ini file.  Perhaps a
"configure" -type script could generate this file during
the install process.

	If the distribution did not contain one, perhaps
you could ask the author for his/her own php.ini file to
use as a guide for your troubleshooting.

	MAGIC_QUOTES_GPC is a typical config option which
varies from server to server, and many scripts assume only
one of its valid states.  Good ones can deal with either
configured state.

	Many critical options such as these can be tested by
the PHP script itself and either overridden, worked around,
or explicitly announced as a "fatal configuration error."

	But since many cool scripts were not engineered for
mass-deployment, it may become your (or my) responsibility
to discover and fix these incompatibilities -- and then send
them to the author.  This is the essence of "Open Source
Software!"

	So be happy about it and consider contributing to
your favorite Open Source project!

Best, George.

I agree that it have showed lacked of thought, but PHP is still in 
development.  Advancement in any language all have this growing pain.  Be 
patient, a standard will come once the dust comes down.

I completely agree with you, Gerald.

     There is no direct, easy way of making everything compatible with
everything else. It's not your fault, obviously -- it's just a lack of
thought on the other programmer's side.

     Changing the php.ini file around on the fly for specific applications
isn't really a feasible idea, and I realize that. It's an age old problem,
and it just boils down to programmers writing crappy, incompatible code.

-Bradley.

yes. If you look thru httpd.conf file.  You will find that it is there.  
Also, It is the file you also need to tweak to make the Virtual Host work.

Guys-

Ok, here's an apache config question for you.

Is it possible to assign a variable in apache. For
example

I would like to make a "home" variable that points
to c:\\home\\webpub\\

I could then use this variable in other
configuration file (like virtual hosts) to point
to individual directories using  DocumentRoot home
  "usersdirectory\\public"

Is this possible to do in apache?

-Evan

I was also shocked by the many differences between versions in PHP. Why no
key_exists? ... I found this in the change log:

In 4.0.6 David Croft: Added key_exists() to check if a given key or index
exists in an array or object.

In 4.2.0 Derick: Renamed key_exists() to array_key_exists().

I dont know how the policy is on renaming between versions like that rather
than depricating. Sometimes language developers will preserve the right to
change code interfaces so long as it is within major version releases but
that can not be the case now because an uprade from 4.0 to 4.2 looks like a
major one to me.

Rgds,
 Sigurdur

A vast majority of the postnuke developers left the project and went on to create their own fork. ( I think there might even be only one guy left on the postnuke project ). 

This is based on chitchat with one of the leaving guys. He might be biased. It also doesn't say anything about the code itself. But if you liked postnuke, you might want to stay with the developers, not the project :)

No. I can't remember the name (there was no PHP or Nuke in the new name) but that's not what I'm talking about.

First there was PHPNuke.. then a group of developers couldn't deal with this main developer guy anymore and forked the code to create PostNuke (actually this is where PostNuke gets a lot of its appeal.. doing things the right way).. now what I'm saying is a group of PostNuke people are working on yet another fork. I'll try to find the name of the new project.

Subject: Config Problems, Apache-PHP on Windows
Message-ID: <sdff1634.018@mail.sussex.edu>

I'm trying to get Apache 1.3.26 and PHP 4.2.3 setup on my win production computer after a crash a week ago. I don't want to use the PHP module for apache I'd rather run it as a separate program. I'll worry about MySQL after I have the PHP working.

After setting up per the instructions from adslworld (A.K.A. GeekForums) I get this message upon trying to get the phpinfo();
"You have chosen to download a file of type: application/x-httpd-php from 127.0.0.1/a/test.php" 
The page will not display and acts as if it is a download. When I do download & display the page it only has the <? phpinfo(); ?> text and that is it so the server is not processing the PHP.

Anyone have a clue? I've been at this since Friday and have compared the conf file with my web server conf file (That's working fine, Apache-1.3.24  PHP-4.0.5). It has to be something simple I'm overlooking.... 

TIA,

Jessica

i think i mis-wrote because i misunderstood something. the 
documentation talks about: PHP_INI_PERDIR. so i thought 
that meant that if you put a php.ini in each directory,and if 
you only overrode items which are overrideable, then your 
new setting would override the system setting.  it's not so simple. 

0.  local php.ini files (i.e., files with php directives, 
    named php.ini, in the same directory as the
    php programs) are not used.  php directives in
    that file are ignored.  I haven't done an strace
    (since stracing httpd is a major pain :), but
    changing settings in the local php.ini file
    does not change any behavior.

1.  the documentation discusses using .htaccess with 
    php_flag <setting_name> <setting_value>.

    e.g., for register_globals, we say:

    php_flag register_globals on

    This works on apache for settings which may be set on
    PERDIR basis.  I see no discussion of how to achieve the same 
    effect when using other web servers (google might know, but I'm 
    not online as I compose this).

The documentation clearly states that register_globals cannot be
modified by ini_set (and this is perfectly reasonable and understandable).
However, if there is no universal way (e.g., through local php.ini files
instead of server specific special configuration files) to do PERDIR
settings, then distributing configuration files with applications is not
feasible.

And if, as seems likely, there is no equivalent to .htaccess php 
specific perdir settings for some web servers, then there is no way
to solve at least the register_globals problem for all web servers.
most other settings can be modified by ini_set.  So previous comments
on how mature applications should clean up their environment by 
using ini_set and adapt to their environment via ini_get and 
ini_set are definitely correct.  but not everything can be solved
that way.

it will probably be necessary to rewrite any applications that depend 
on register_globals.  this is obvious and should be done anyway for
reasons of security.  unfortunately, it'll probably be a while before the
major PHP applications will be ported.  and it's likely that some won't be
ported and will, instead, require their users to run apache (so they can
use .htaccess) or run on servers which have register_globals on.

Yeah.  I'm looking at five PHP helpdesk/bugtracking packages
I'm testing and none have php.ini files.  

initially i was just assessing the different packages to see which i might
want to use.  i couldn't even assess them since none would run
without register_globals.  I think i'll just test them on a separate server
(running on the same box, but on a different port) that has register_globals
on, and then, once i've made my choice based on features, i may work
with the author to make it less reliant on register_globals and generally,
able to adapt to its environment (thus making it easier to install).

thanks for all the comments.  this discussion has been enlightening.

It doesn't matter what code you have in the .php file, what the webserver is
trying to "say" is that it doesn't know how to handle files with a php file
extension. I'm not sure how you set everything up... but you need to
configure the webserver to recognize them.

Modify your httpd.conf file...

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
Action application/x-httpd-php "/phpdir/php.exe"
ScriptAlias /phpdir/ "c:/Program Files/php/"

Tweak paths as appropraite for your system.

Oh jeez, I don't know how I looked over the fact that you are CURRENTLY
using apache. For some reason I read it thinking that you weren't.
Sorry about that. Dan is correct, you just need to modify your httpd.conf
file.

Hi Dan,

I added/changed what you suggested. I'm still having problems though.

I have mucked around with the below section hoping to get things going but to no avail.

>>>
    # To use server-parsed HTML files
    #
    AddType text/html .shtml .htm .inc
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml .htm .inc .php
    #
>>>>
If I change " AddType text/html .shtml .htm .inc"  and "AddHandler server-parsed .shtml .htm .inc" to not include .php I get a "Bad Request Error".

If I add .php to "AddType text/html .shtml .htm .inc [.php]" I get a page with <? phpinfo(); ?> in the source code but nothing else.

If I keep .php in "AddType text/html .shtml .htm .inc [.php]" and add .php to "AddHandler server-parsed .shtml .htm .inc [.php]" I get the same error as above (I get a page with <? phpinfo(); ?> in the source code but nothing else.)

If I get rid of .php in "AddType text/html .shtml .htm .inc" and Keep .php to "AddHandler server-parsed .shtml .htm .inc [.php]" the server wants to download the page to the computer rather than displaying the phpinfo();

All this said I don't think that the above in any form is the answer but maybe a clue as to the cause.

If someone would like to paruse the .conf file let me know & I will send a copy to you.

Thank's

Jessica

Jessica,

"server-parsed" is not the setting you should be modifying. Like Dan said, what you need to do is to add 

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
Action application/x-httpd-php "/phpdir/php.exe"
ScriptAlias /phpdir/ "c:/Program Files/php/"

which has the effect of associating the .php extension with the x-httpd-php mime time which in turn will be handled by php.exe.

If you put .php in the 'server-parsed' setting Apache will try to *handle* it as if it was a server side include (i think that's what server-parsed is for) and not as php. Make sure you remove .php from that line. You can also add other extensions such as .php4, .phtml etc but you should do that in the section i've described above.

Jessica,

You need to check the httpd.conf ( which you should find in the directory 
called "conf" in the Apache install directory).  This is the file where 
you add the line 

 AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

If you want   PHP to parse other extensions, add more of the above lines 
but change the last part ( .php) to the extension of your choice.

Jessica,

"server-parsed" is not the setting you should be modifying. Like Dan said, 
what you need to do is to add 

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
Action application/x-httpd-php "/phpdir/php.exe"
ScriptAlias /phpdir/ "c:/Program Files/php/"

which has the effect of associating the .php extension with the

If you put .php in the 'server-parsed' setting Apache will try to *handle* 
it as if it was a server side include (i think that's what server-parsed 
is for) and not as php. Make sure you remove .php from that line. You can 
also add other extensions such as
 .php4, .phtml etc but you should do that in the section i've described 
above.

I've strived to make CMACS well written. It started out
not-well-written, so some of it is still in transition, but I'd
welcome any comments on what's non-compliant with it.

It is not recommended to run php as a cgi script because of security reason. 
  If you really want to do that, you can try looking in the file of 
"php.ini" file.

I'm trying to get Apache 1.3.26 and PHP 4.2.3 setup on my win production 
computer after a crash a week ago. I don't want to use the PHP module for 
apache I'd rather run it as a separate program. I'll worry about MySQL after 
I have the PHP working.

After setting up per the instructions from adslworld (A.K.A. GeekForums) I 
get this message upon trying to get the phpinfo();
"You have chosen to download a file of type: application/x-httpd-php from 
127.0.0.1/a/test.php"
The page will not display and acts as if it is a download. When I do 
download & display the page it only has the <? phpinfo(); ?> text and that 
is it so the server is not processing the PHP.

Anyone have a clue? I've been at this since Friday and have compared the 
conf file with my web server conf file (That's working fine, Apache-1.3.24  
PHP-4.0.5). It has to be something simple I'm overlooking....

TIA,

Jessica

If you are trying to put php to work with apache,  you have to add
LoadModule
AddModule
and AddType into httpd.conf file to make it work with apache.  Also, adjust 
your php.ini file too.

It doesn't matter what code you have in the .php file, what the webserver is
trying to "say" is that it doesn't know how to handle files with a php file
extension. I'm not sure how you set everything up... but you need to
configure the webserver to recognize them.

apache and php

here it is

add the following to their sections in httpd.conf:
LoadModule php4_module <directory of where it sits>/libphp4.so
AddModule mod_php4.c
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

then:
copy php.ini-dist to c:\\winnt\\php.ini
change directory to point to where php.exe sits in php.ini file

restart your web server 

this should do it.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Config Problems, Apache-PHP on Windows
Message-ID: <se00785d.011@mail.sussex.edu>

There is no php module to add such as:
AddModule mod_php4.c
It doesn't exist and didn't come with the php binary.
I do get a "Can't remove mod_php4.c, Not found in module list" when I stop apache. but no problems when I start or restart apache.
I do however Load the php4apache module that came with the php binary (it is uncommented).

I also have added everything else including the 
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
Action application/x-httpd-php "c:/php/php.exe"
ScriptAlias /php/ "c:/apache/Apache/php/"

My php binary is under c:/php/php.exe.
/php/ is under c:/apache/Apache/php/ like it's a cgi-bin but I have nothing in the folder.

I would love to have someone look over the conf & php.ini files but am wary of pissing people off by posting such a large file(s) in an email. Can I do this? 

I have also run the test file in a DOS prompt:
c:\\php\\php.exe c:\\apache\\Apache\\htdocs\\sussex\\a\	est.php
and I get the the html file that phpinfo(); generates so it seems that the binary is working fine.

My head hurts. I've been at this since Friday.

Jessica

If you are trying to put php to work with apache,  you have to add
LoadModule
AddModule
and AddType into httpd.conf file to make it work with apache.  Also, adjust 
your php.ini file too.

It doesn't matter what code you have in the .php file, what the webserver is
trying to "say" is that it doesn't know how to handle files with a php file
extension. I'm not sure how you set everything up... but you need to
configure the webserver to recognize them.

Forget about running PHP as an Apache module on Windows platforms.  
Comment out all references to such in your httpd.conf file.

The script alias is supposed to point to the real php binary.  So change 
that line to:
   ScriptAlias /php/ "c:/php/"

Hell everyone,

Thanks for the discount code Jaz.

Can anyone tell me about their experience with Zend Studio? I downloaded
evaluation version a few days ago but found it to be rather slow. Is it
just my computer or is it really not that robust, especially the
debugging was a pain.

Given enough ram :-)  Actually I was able to run the Zend Studio on a PIII 700mhz
with 128 mb ram no problem.  I've now upgraded to 320 mb, and it runs like a 
dream.  This is 2.4.19-preempt though, could be different depending on your kernel
version/operating system.

The Zend Studio really does seem to be the best IDE out there, if you want/need 
an IDE.  For me the emacs/vim combo has always worked, so no reason to stop now.

Subject: loop
Message-ID: <200212191626.59262.brian@preston-campbell.com>

I am currently using a script to move a webcam at certain time intervals.  The 
script never times out and uses the following to run indefinitely:

for (;;) {
[camera instuctions]
}

Anyone know the principal behind this snippet and why it works?  I have not 
been able to find any information on the subject.

It's a Cism near as I can tell. As you know it's the functional equivalent of
while(1) {}. As for the principle behind it... the entire (;;) evaluates to
an unmet condition. thus the for loop never ends. Personally I prefer (for
readability purpose) the while(1). But most compilers today will optimize
both such that the condition is never met.

Sure it's an infinite loop, that is exactly what I am using it for.  I found 
it in use in another script and put it in use.  I'm more interested in the 
nuts and bolts.  What is the significance of the ;; operator, if it is in 
fact an operator?  There is nothing that I could find in the docs.

Interesting article and well written, except for a couple minor things:

How it work --> How It Works
non-programmer --> non-programmers  (in some cases)

There might be a couple other things, but it's hard for me to describe where
changes need to be made :)  You might also want to run a spell checker
through it, or send me the plain text and I'd be happy to revise a bit.

Best,

Never mind, I get it. Not passing any expressions to for() causes it to loop 
infinitely.

It just has an empty starting and ending conditions and an empty step action

e.g. for ($i=0;$i<10;$i++) with both conditions and instruction taken out...

i didn't even know it was possible.

I didn't no it was possible either, until I needed to use it.   It has been 
invoked, so the camera moves 6 times in 21 minutes and loops forever 
(http://www.aquaeast.com./webcam.php -- not much to see at night).  Now the 
question is how to stop it when running in an embedded system.  Hard reset 
maybe?

How about using a boolean variable in a while loop.

Instead of  

for(;;)
  [camera instructions] 

Use something along these lines:

$run = true;

While($run)
{
  [camera instuctions]
}


Set $run to false under some condition to stop the loop (inside the
loop).

You don't have to do that. You can use break inside the for loop to
get out.

I already ran the BBEdit spell checker (I'm on OS X). But this spell 
checker will not catch syntax errors. Anyway, I'm taking your 
generous offer and the file is on your way. Thanks again!

The script will specifically not time out.  I don't want it to.  The
issue is that it is running on a tiny embedded server (see
http://www.boa.org) running php3lite, a reduced version of php for just
such a system.  I opened a browser three days ago, started the script,
and then closed the browser.  If I need to kill the process I am not
sure how to do it other than restarting the server although I can
probably end it with [kill -1 php] in ssh.  Since these are not normal
circumstances, I was curious if there might be another way to end the
process.

You could have PHP kill itself in various way, if this helps:

How about passing the $run variable for the while loop (as someone else
mentioned) through the browser, via get?

so you could go to
http://tinyembedded/control.php?run=true
or
http://tinyembedded/control.php?run=false
to start and stop, respectively...

That would merely start a non-running instance of the same script, as opposed 
to killing the one that is looping on the server.

I'm looking into Hans' suggestion of

I have to look into how PHP was compiled and if these will be possible.  Back 
to the limits of an embedded system -- can't compile anything.

I see what you mean..

what about using a value set in another way to start/stop the loop - for ex,
reading the contents of a file every so many loops and continuing or not
based on that.

this file would then be altered by the $run=false script, and the currently
running script could exit when in encounters the changed value...

Under what circumstances do you want to kill it?

I thought daemons were supposed to run forever. Why does the daemon have to die ever? Are you saying you're starting to browse a page and it's somehow starting another process that runs forever? (like a bad SQL query or something)

By the way, if it's anything like the web server that comes with webmin, there might be a function defined already to restart the server based on .. based on anything really..

That is a great idea.  I could keep it simple and just check for the existence 
of the file.  When I want to kill the script, I delete the file.  Before 
invoking it again I just upload the file again.

To answer Adam, I would want to kill it if the client decides to change the 
pattern of camera movement or the duration between moves.  They have not 
asked for either of these yet but I will be doing these on a regular basis so 
I am building an arsenal and expanding my knowledge / options.

>From the server administration page it is possible to restart the server.  I 
look at that as the last option for these devices because there are other 
processes running that I do not want to kill.  One of which is the FTP cleint 
that is sending the camera image to the real web server that is used to 
display the web cam.  Although it usually reboots quickly, if there is no 
image people start asking why their $xxxx.xx machine is not working as 
expected.

Forever is a long time, I'd like to have contingency in this case.  Camera 
servers with embedded Linux and PHP are fairly new, so there is not much 
documentation out there -- even from the manufacturers.

Thanks to all for the help.

That's a great idea. I didn't know that Evolt.org had a forum to

Yeah.  There is always a way, but at what cost?  Since this is in a infinite 
loop, this is acting like a daemon.  You might want to do it as a daemon.  
Open a port and listen in on it.  When you received a certain message, it 
will stop.

You could also do what Unix daemon wrappers do: write the PID to a 
'run.pid' file.  A separate kill script would read that file and send the 
appropriate kill signal to the PID.  This would eliminate the overhead and 
latency of periodically re-reading a control file.

Hello Adam,

I'm not sure if you are using Opera on Windows. But the source 
listing at <http://scriptdigital.com/divers/gems/setstring.txt> 
display correctly with Win/Opera 7. What I noticed though is that 
when saved to disk, the end of line of the file are jammed when 
viewed with Notepad and the source listing display as one very long 
line. I tested also with Explorer 5 which do the right thing. All my 
testing are done in Virtual PC running Windows 98.

Cheers

I'm using Opera 6.05 on Windows, on a 1024x768 laptop screen.

They're formatted correctly, just very small, and very light grey. If
you care about this, you might want to use something other than
"<pre>".

I'm using "<pre>" as a workaround of a CSS bug in Explorer 5 that 
doesn't recognize some font properties, but I don't remember exactly 
which ones. Also, the listing is not suppose to be grey. The listing 
is in dark blue and on  Win/Opera 7, its not small. Your the first 
one to complain about this.

The class that I use for <pre> is this one:

.code1
{
   color: #00008B;
   font-family: monospace;
   font-size: smaller;
}


Can you set in your prefs in Opera the minimum size of the fonts. Are 
other seeing what Adam is seeing.

I'm not a designer by profession and just recently learned CSS.

Cheers
-Emmanuel

I have always used PHP with either RedHat or FreeBSD. However, I am working
on a site now that is equipped with windows 2000 and IIS. I am considering
using PHP on this site and was curious to hear from anyone who has any
expereince using PHP on a reletively high traffic site on IIS.

The current site gets over 100,000 hits a day. For my own internal
development I use PHP as a CGI module and I know that eats up a lot of
resources, I don't think this would be a good option for our production
server. I know that you can run PHP on IIs as an ISAPI module but the last
time I looked into this it seemed it was still buggy and not really ready
for production.

So if you were me, what would you do and why? Of course at this point,
ditching windows is not an option. It is in the long term plan however.

Thanks in advance,
Alan

Alan,
    Just out of pure curiosity, and utter hatred for IIS...why, may I ask,
are you using it? What can a Microsoft product do that FreeBSD / RedHat
can't?

  I understand if it's a client that is just picky about what is used, but I
think that it would be better in the long run to not waste time with Windows
2000 / IIS and just use something you're familiar with.

    However, I do have experience with IIS and high-load websites, there
isn't too much you can do to tweak the speed, or anything like that... It's
pretty..."bland". PHP works under Windows, and IIS just fine (not as well as
*nix, I, personally think -- but that's me)

    As for the ISAPI modules, why even use them? Why not write it all in
PHP? Personally, I think that PHP is better then perl/cgi. Let us know what
this module does, and perhaps we can help you to port it over to a PHP
script.

    What bugs are you encountering? Give us the errors, and the code -- I'll
try and help you.

Good luck.

Believe me, I am no fan of IIS but in this particular case, the site was
written in Cold Fusion, which in turn needs to run on IIs (for licensing
reasons). The real reason I am stuck with IIs for the moment is that the
site I am working on just has too much to rewrite in PHP right now. I plan
to make a transition slowly to PHP on a RedHat machine once we have all the
major site functionality rebuilt in PHP. Until then however, I want to
implement some important features on the site and begin rewriting other apps
in PHP to work alongside the Cold Fusion stuff until we are ready to make
that final move. So technically there is nothing that Windows IIs can do
that FreeBSD or Redhat can do right now except run our only licensed copy of
Cold Fusion (sucks. I know) :(

What I am referring to here is that it is my understanding there are two
ways to install PHP on windows with IIs. You can run it as a CGI, that is to
map the .php files to execute the php.exe file, or map the .php files to
execute the /sapi/php4isapi.dll file. With the former, you load the whole
php.exe executable on every invocation on PHP, with the other PHP runs as a
module in the server memory. I remeber a while ago, the module was not all
that stable and was not reccomended for production systems. I was hoping to
find out if that is still the case, and if anyone had any luck doing so on a
busy server (100,000 hits a day).

Thanks,
Alan

I tried recently install PHP, Apache 2.0.43, and Oracle client on a Window 
2000.  The site is really fast, but I still don't know how many hits it can 
support.  Maybe you can do a load testing on it and find out.

I have always used PHP with either RedHat or FreeBSD. However, I am working
on a site now that is equipped with windows 2000 and IIS. I am considering
using PHP on this site and was curious to hear from anyone who has any
expereince using PHP on a reletively high traffic site on IIS.

The current site gets over 100,000 hits a day. For my own internal
development I use PHP as a CGI module and I know that eats up a lot of
resources, I don't think this would be a good option for our production
server. I know that you can run PHP on IIs as an ISAPI module but the last
time I looked into this it seemed it was still buggy and not really ready
for production.

So if you were me, what would you do and why? Of course at this point,
ditching windows is not an option. It is in the long term plan however.

Thanks in advance,
Alan

Just wondering why can't you point or redirect to the resulting page on a 
system running php and redhat and versa.  This will can make the transition 
a little more smooth.

What I am referring to here is that it is my understanding there are two
ways to install PHP on windows with IIs. You can run it as a CGI, that is to
map the .php files to execute the php.exe file, or map the .php files to
execute the /sapi/php4isapi.dll file. With the former, you load the whole
php.exe executable on every invocation on PHP, with the other PHP runs as a

Everything is so tighty itegrated with Cold Fusion now, Sessions and more
that make integrating the two all at once unlikely, as I am only one guy and
there is simply too much code to rewrite, yet I need to fix some things now,
which I can do faster in PHP.

The way this site is currently written, to do as you suggest would force me
to write a bunch of hokey code that I will eventually just have to toss. I
am trying to keep some of the Cold Fusion in Place that is working
relatively well, and until we are ready to make the swap alltogether to a
new server, make my additions and fixes in PHP with anticipation for that
switch.

Eventually, both IIS and Cold Fusion will be gone, I just need to work
around some of it for now and we only have one production server at the
moment to mess around with. I would really like to know if the phpisapi.dll
is relatively stable, and would like to hear if anyone has actually used it
in a production environment.

Thanks,
Alan

It's understandable that you are hesitant to rewriting this CF code in PHP,
due to time restrictions, or what have you. But I can only foresee problems
along the line, if you try to "combine" the two, as you are now.
Especially, since "both IIS and CF will be gone", eventually. Save yourself
the trouble, and the stress. Do it the right way, the first time around.

Personal opinion.
-Brad.

No one has as much contempt for Cold Fusion and IIs than I do, but at this
point I simply do not have an option but to deal with it. I am working on a
production site that I simply cannot deconstruct overnight. There are some
pressing matters that need to be addressed, and I am working to rewrite
those parts of the site now in PHP, rewriting the rest will follow suit, and
in a few weeks, we will be moving everything over. But I was just hoping fo
some pointers to reduce the amount of problems that may come up when running
PHP on a high volume IIS server and perhaps prevent any known issues.

Believe me, I fully understand. It is not that I am hesitant to rewrite the
site, as I am doing that, I just have too much to do, and cannot wait until
I have rewritten the site before I impliment some PHP code into it.

Alan,

I use the module on a apache server 1.3.xx on a Win Advanced Server 2000 and it is a bit flaky at times. It seems to just stop working. The site does not get a lot of hits and the PHP seems to crap out when you need to enter info into a MySQL DB. This doesn't happen often but about once a week and is frustrating the person entering the data (myself also!). 

I have been told to avoid using the module from persons on this list (Thank's Daniel!) because of this and am currently trying to get it to work as CGI on my test server then I'll switch the other server over.

I suggest running IIS and PHP on Windows 2000 Server, or Advanced Server.
There may be a couple configuration things you might want to look into...
(how many users at a time? etc, etc)
Also, you're going to want to look into MySQL's (or whatever other database
you're using) configuration, too... (again, amount of users at the same
time)...
Those are the only real obvious things I can think of, if I can come up with
anything else, I'll be sure to let you know.

Good luck.
-Brad.

Miss/Mrs. Jessiaca Kelly,

Better to use PHP and related softwares on Linux machine rather than on

rather than on Gas.

I really wonder. Hard to change everything, once set up on Window's 
environment but "Better" to move on Linux.

Anirudh,

    That's the point we're all trying to make, but -- there _are_ situations
in which immediate attention is required, and tedious code translation
simply takes too long for it's environment.
I'm sure he's making the choice appropriate for his situation.

-Brad.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP in production on Microsoft IIs
Message-ID: <se06f663.070@mail.sussex.edu>

IIS is a four letter word as far as I'm concerned. Also everyone needs to realize that as web/PHP developers we are often stuck with what we have, not what we would rather have. If IIS didn't have such a sordid security past we would be running it here and I would have absolutely no say in the matter. I wanted to put Linux on the server and they put Advanced Server 2000 on it. I scream, yet no one hears...

The site is for a very small community college and it gets very few, if any, concurrent hits on the PHP/MySQL portion of it and I have plenty of room for multiple users config wise.

I still think that Alan should use CGI instead of the module. It is flaky.

Thank's Guys
Jessica

Miss/Mrs. Jessiaca Kelly,

Better to use PHP and related softwares on Linux machine rather than on 
Microsoft based OSs :) ? This is like running your Ferrari car on Diesel 
rather than on Gas.I really wonder. Hard to change everything, once set up on Window's 
environment but "Better" to move on Linux.
Thanks,

>>>
I suggest running IIS and PHP on Windows 2000 Server, or Advanced Server.
There may be a couple configuration things you might want to look into...
(how many users at a time? etc, etc)
Also, you're going to want to look into MySQL's (or whatever other database
you're using) configuration, too... (again, amount of users at the same
time)...
Those are the only real obvious things I can think of, if I can come up with
anything else, I'll be sure to let you know.
Good luck.

Perhaps if you told us what exactly this ColdFusion code did, some of us (in

in my spare time.

Subject: photo album
In-Reply-To: <200212231930.gBNJU6St097948@parsec.nyphp.org>
Message-ID: <CIEHKGNAJJDGOHPAAHEGCEKIGAAA.mike@hilliardfarber.com>

Hey All,
I've got a mySQL/php question here . .

I want to create a photo album using a php script that will call a sql query
to help populate the page now the first question is:

What would be the best way to store the images in the database?  Links to
the images?  Can you store the actual images? (I'm guessing that would not
be recommended . . )

I figure I would run a for loop that runs the total number of items returned
and echo the path into the img tag.
ie: <img src=<?php echo 'results of query function' ?> border=0> or
something to this effect.

Anyone do anything like this?  Suggestions?

Thanks!

Mike Lee

I've made quite a few of these... you've got a number of options:
I find this to be the best:
Using a simple HTML form, upload the file -- and add the filename / filetype
into a database. NOT THE FILE _ITSELF_. Just the info... also, in the table,
have an ID (auto incr.) field, so that each file / photo is assigned an
individual, exclusive, ID number... then, upload the file, or move it,
rather... with the "move_uploaded_file()" or "copy()" function.
see:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php
Name the file itself, with the ID given to the record in the database,
"mysql_insert_id()".
Now, every time you do an SQL search, you can have the "real" name of the
file, it's type, and the ID of the filename handy.... this way you don't
need to worry about files with the same filename, or anything like that...

It really depends on what you want, but this way (with some other features,
too) seems to be good, tried and true.

I hope this method makes some sort of sense. If it doesn't, let me know.
I'll re-explain.

Good luck,
-Bradley.

You might want to check out a little open source item out there that does
all of this and more.
It also auto generates the thumbnail images, and uses a java desktop piece
to help upload multiple images.  I've used in about 4 websites, and I've
been very please with it so far...

I AM NOT affiliated with it in any way.... just happy with the results....

http://gallery.sourceforge.net/

Gallery is the name of the project.....

Hey All,
I've got a mySQL/php question here . .

I want to create a photo album using a php script that will call a sql query
to help populate the page now the first question is:

What would be the best way to store the images in the database?  Links to
the images?  Can you store the actual images? (I'm guessing that would not
be recommended . . )

I figure I would run a for loop that runs the total number of items returned
and echo the path into the img tag.
ie: <img src=<?php echo 'results of query function' ?> border=0> or
something to this effect.

Anyone do anything like this?  Suggestions?

Thanks!

Mike Lee

Good luck, buddy.
Perhaps if you told us what exactly this ColdFusion code did, some of us (in
our free time) could help you write some code... I'm always willing to help
in my spare time.
Let me know,

Looks interesting due to the fact that it doesn't use GD or ImageMagick... I
might actually look into NetBPM (image manipulation libs) that they are
using, because it can handle GIF files again, which GD can't do, due to
UniSys legal stuff.

Thanks for the link, Patrick.

Hi Bradley or anyone.

Speaking of GD, ImageMagick and all that...I've got a situation where I want
to shrink an uploaded image to 50px max vertical and still maintain image
quality.  Unfortunately, it's on a hosted server, which only supports GD and
I'm not even sure in what form.  I've messed around with some of the code
from PEAR, but I can't get good image quality, and can only support jpegs
(I'd like to at least get gifs in there)...any thoughts or suggestions???
What does anyone know about the Gallery link
(http://gallery.sourceforge.net/)- are you saying it's using NetBPM ... is
this something I can install locally???

Thanks for any help.  And hello all.
Chris

Looks interesting due to the fact that it doesn't use GD or ImageMagick... I
might actually look into NetBPM (image manipulation libs) that they are
using, because it can handle GIF files again, which GD can't do, due to
UniSys legal stuff.

Thanks for the link, Patrick.

Hi Christopher,

You can find pre-compiled NetBPM binaries here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7130

There is no installation process what so ever. Just upload the files, make
sure they are executable and off you go! Take a look at the PHP Gallery
application for example use.

Daniel Kushner

Hi Bradley or anyone.

Speaking of GD, ImageMagick and all that...I've got a situation where I want
to shrink an uploaded image to 50px max vertical and still maintain image
quality.  Unfortunately, it's on a hosted server, which only supports GD and
I'm not even sure in what form.  I've messed around with some of the code
from PEAR, but I can't get good image quality, and can only support jpegs
(I'd like to at least get gifs in there)...any thoughts or suggestions???
What does anyone know about the Gallery link
(http://gallery.sourceforge.net/)- are you saying it's using NetBPM ... is
this something I can install locally???

Thanks for any help.  And hello all.
Chris

I would never store images in a database.  For one thing, they can't be 
locally cached.  For another it precludes the use of a dedicated image 
server, or at least complicates it.  For another, it takes a lot more 
bandwidth to pull something from a database than it does from a 
filesystem.  And if the application should ever grow to the scale where 
edge delivery is desirable...

You could store the paths in the database but if you have a lot of images 
you have to be careful about overloading directories.  Typically, 
hand-rolled photo archives are based on a bunch of categorized 
directories.  For instance, you might have thousands of photos in the "NYC" 
category and only a handful of snapshots of Boise.  As those directories 
grow, search times slow and maintenance becomes more problematic.

A better solution which tends to balance out a directory tree better is 
create a two or three tiered directory structure based on an MD5 hash of 
the image's name or image id:

     $IMAGE_DIR = "/images";
     $hash  = md5($image_name);
     $relative_path = sprintf("%s/%s/%s/%s", $IMAGE_DIR,
         substr($hash, 0, 2), substr($hash, 2, 2), $image_name);

This creates a pseudo-random distribution of directories.  Run through this 
function, the image "slobbering_dog.jpg" would produce this directory 
hierarchy:

/images/fe/24/slobbering_dog.jpg

Then you only need to store the image's name, or numeric id, in the 
database (along with a category id probably).  If you have millions of 
images, I'd probably increase those node names to three characters.  We 
use  this at CCI too, BTW.

1.  don't store the images in the database; store them in an image 
directory and store the name of each image plus any commentary in the database.
2.  store your search results in a temporary table
3.  loop through that temporary table echoing each result (as you say) with 
previous/next posting a direction to go, backwards or forwards, for the 
next one

On the note of a photo gallery .. 
The gallery mentioned back a few messages ago .. It really does take
care of everything.. Including controlling permissions if you need to do
so... 
If you want to see a site that's using the software (integrated within a
postnuke - a feature of the gallery) check out 
http://www.conwayentertainment.com/
And I just added a small addition of being able to send an ecard of any
of the pictures with ecards (again a postnuke module set)

site looks good, and the gallery looks great, nice and clean and good
navigation.  However, I'm still just looking for the ability to manipulate
images - my latest (and greatest) problem is that the host that my site is
sitting on is on (get this) PHP4.0.3 - which does not allow the previously
mentioned gallery program to run (or configure) - so I'm trying to get the
netPBM library set up and just to use that to manipulate images, but so far
no luck - I know I'm on apache, and I think the software I'm on is Tomcat
(is that right???) - or maybe Sparc - can someone let me know how to find
out what software is running on my server.  I'm not very good with Unix, so
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing with the netPBM library ... can
anyone out there help?

Thanks all.  C

phpinfo();

Will give you a full breakdown of the version and configuration of PHP
you're running, you're machine's OS and version as well as a multitude of
other useful information.

yeah - call me a fool - but I'm not quite sure how to read phpinfo(), is it
in this line (ie, sparc?):

One More Way to Handle Images which we used at my previous job:

The form will upload the file and rename it as a random generated number ( I
believe it was 8 digits long). There was a folder called images and then
inside this folder there were 10 folders named 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9. Once
the image is renamed, the program looks at the last digit of the name and
puts it in that directory. Obviously the name of the image was entered in
the DB. It may sound a little bit complicated but once we set it up it was
very easy to handle images since we had about 10000 images of Artists and CD
covers.

If you are reading it by eye, you make a page like below:

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

and you save it.  Call it from a browser.  The setting and version with show 
up there.  If you are reading the info from a PHP script.  You have to use 
ini_get() function, because all these info are in php.ini file.

Hey All,
Thanks for all the replies and the help - I decided to go with the gallery
option but I'm running into a problem.  Anyone running gallery on dreamhost?
Their my hosting comp. and there is some info on how to get gallery working
on it but it's not working for me.  They apparently cut off access to
certain functions like exec() and stuff for sec. reasons so there is a
workaround using pcgi file formats (basically running the php as a cgi
script).  I'm still working with the techs on trying to figure out other
problems I'm having (locks and so on).  Could just be that I royally screwed
up the install  . . who knows =)  Any suggestions are welcome thanks!

Mike

Does any know of any digital asset management software, preferably an
open-source?  The one based on PHP would be great.  Heck, we can't expect to
have everything our way. :)

Thanks and happy holidays!

Hi Again,
I've got another request of the group.  I'm wondering if anyone has
used/recommends a php/mysql based calender app that shows events - enter
events, edit, etc.  I setting up my church youthgroups site and I need a
calender to help keep track of various events and stuff.  Thanks for all the
help - still working with dreamhost about gallery.

It would be better to keep a max-id in a central location.  Keep max-id in its own 1-row table and bump max-id everytime a new request comes in for a new-unique-file-name, then incorporate it in the file name returned.  The problem with an 8 digit random number is that at a very short time you will end up with a collision (the odds are not 1 in 10^8 that your system will experience a collision but are much less because each file id is competing with each other one).

Generated random numbers should be fine if you append them to some
string that corresponds to what the image in.

>From experience, it is not a good idea to take a bunch of images and
rename them to random or sequential numbers - it makes it impossible
for a human to look at a file listing and see what you've got.

Subject: Sorry, really stupid question...
Message-ID: <016001c2aea6$b2e4f9f0$2aaf6244@scandinawa1bo6>

Honestly, what does this do:

$fileID = fopen("nicknames.txt", "a") or die("Could not open " . $path . "/nicknames.txt");
   chmod("nicknames.txt", 0755);
   fputs($fileID, $nickname . "\
"); fflush($fileID); fclose($fileID);

What does it EXACTLY do?  What I'm trying to do is very very simple:  I have the nickname of "phil" and I add it to nicknames.txt as "phil" + "\
".  The next person adds his name as "bob" + "\
".  However, this happens:

phil
philbob

Is it due to the way I'm adding to the file?  Can someone show me how to append to a file properly without carrying over persistent existing data like what you see above, instead having it like this:

phil
bob

Thanx, I'm lost here.

Phil

Let's rewrite this in more efficient, readable code...
   $File = '/path/to/nicknames.txt';
   $fileID = fopen($File, 'a') or die("Could not open $File");
   fputs($fileID, "$nickname\
");

Key changes...
   * Have the file chmoded in the first place, not every time you open it 
     up, nor while you have it open already.
   * Changed double quotes to single quotes in fopen statement.  Double 
     quotes only needed when strings are evaluated (have variables in 
     them).
   * fflush() isn't needed at all.
   * fclose() happens automatically when the script ends, so is 
     only helpful when you have a long script.

Still, it's a good habit to close resources you open.

But you still didn't answer the original question.

Phil, what is the rest of the code doing?

Adam, it's a lot more complicated than I thought.  Basically, it involves 3
PHP files and 4 TCL files, along with 2 flat text files.  I will have to
tackle this on my own unless you want to view about 11 files including HTML.

Sorry

"Have the file chmoded"...

You can chmod a file at anytime, whether it is open or not.  at the command
line you use the chmod command.

In response to the various fclose() message:
    fclose() is *never* necessary.  not even in long scripts, short scripts
    or medium sized scripts. PHP 4 is reference counted, meaning when 
    the file pointer variable is no longer referenced in the script it is
    automatically cleaned up.

Well, you could always hire me to consult on it. Contact me offlist if
you're interested in that.

But it sounds like the problem is that the variable isn't getting
correctly reset between instances.

not in the php script.

chmod() is a standalone function, and not part of the stream
read/write set. You don't have to have the file open to use it. It's
as if you called chmod directly from the shell.

You do, however, need to supply it a full path.

You may need to use fflush, if you run into buffering issues. Under
normal conditions, you shouldn't have to. You can explicitly use
stream_set_write_buffer to configure your stream for no buffering, but
again, unless you have a good reason to do so, you shouldn't.

Just to clear up what may seem to be a very universal statement,
I think that for this script chmod the *nix shell would be a better idea...

But also know that sometimes it IS appropriate to chmod with a PHP script.
For example, sometimes while making directories, or uploading files.

Good luck.

Get this.  This may not be your fault.  If you are looking at it from the 
web brower, you forget to put <BR>.

Why chmod 755?  Wouldn't 666 suffice since you are not executing the text 
file?

Another question is why chmod in php script?  Unless you are trying to 
simulate semaphore, you don't need to do chmod in the script. If you are 
trying to simulate semaphore, this is a bad practice. You can do that on the 
shell if we are talking about *nix.  If we are talking about windows, then 
you can forget about it.

Why chmod 755?  Wouldn't 666 suffice since you are not executing the text
file?

Again, I can't do that.  The file must be set to 0755 and I can only do it
remotely because the chatroom is on a remote server, and I am legally not
allowed to have a webserver running here in Northern Virginia.

Message-ID: <021801c2af19$e05909d0$2aaf6244@scandinawa1bo6>

Ok, I am a bad coder. :(  I can't figure this out at all:

   $fileID = fopen("nicknames.txt", 'r');
    $stuff = fread($fileID, filesize("nicknames.txt")); fclose($fileID);
    if (strlen($stuff) > 0) $priorNickNewLine = "\
"; 
    $nicks = explode("\
", $stuff);

The last line produces the Warning.. why?  I am trying to read contents from nicknames.txt and split according to the newline character so that each nickname is an array element.

What did I do wrong? :(

Not to add any further confusion if you are simply wish to fix what you
have, but you could read the contents of your textfile into an array
with file()

$nicks = file("nicknames.txt");

// You then use rtrim() to remove any unwanted whitespace,newlines, or
carriage returns at the end of each item.

foreach ($nicks as $nick) {
$trimmed_nick = rtrim($nick);
echo "$trimmed_nick<br>";
}

At the same time, it's good habit to only do things that need to be done.

To be honest, I haven't ever had a use for this function and it's 
documentation is sparse, so I may be talking out my, uh, ___, but here 
goes anyway.  It looks like this function is for writing whatever you've 
put into memory via PHP's output buffering commands.

Quite true.  I started writing something along these lines, but cut it out 
because from the code Phil supplied it wasn't clear where the variables 
value came from.

You obviously have the capacity to upload your scripts.  I assume you're 
doing this via FTP.  FTP has the capacity to change file permissions.  So, 
upload a blank file and then change the file permissions.

I'm saying this out of pure programming efficiency.  If the file already
exists and has the right permissions, it is wastefull to reset its
permissions each time the script is called.  Of course, in the real world, 
it's not that big a deal.

Enjoy,

Hi:

Does anyone know of a control panel for windows
that allows for easy web administration? I.E.
allowing customers to login to the control panel
and modify their domains, email accounts ect..?
Anyhow, if it doesn't exist, would anybody be
interested on working on a php driven project like
this? It could use use PHP 4.3 and Apache 2.0.43
along with Imail Webserver (or others) and
whatever ftp clients we can do. Anyone interested?

Hi Shawn,

3 options.

1. Do a lot a reading / trial and error. Sounds like that's what you're
trying to get away from.
2. Download and install (and eventually buy) a package like ensim
(www.ensim.com) , plesk (www.plesk.com) , or cpanel (www.cpanel.net) . These
are packages that allow you do %99 of your web hosting sys admin needs via a
web browser interface. Most of them have a trial version as well.
3. Find a sys admin who will do the work for you in exchange for
access/usage of the machine.

I myself have been toying with the idea of a dedicated server myself for a
while.
I'm curious as to who you picked and why.

Thanx,
Ophir

For installing most of the stuff you can use the FreeBSD ports, that simplifies
installing and upgrading software quite a bit.

Setting up the users and stuff:
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/users.html

Sendmail:
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/sendmail.html

Apache virtual hosts:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/vhosts/index.html

If you get stuck you can contact me off list and I can see if I can help you.
Though you'll probably find enough help in #freebsdhelp on EFnet or the
httpd.apache.org Documentation and FreeBSD handbook.

Hope that's been helpful. G'luck. :)

Hi Shawn,

3 options.

1. Do a lot a reading / trial and error. Sounds like that's what you're
trying to get away from.
2. Download and install (and eventually buy) a package like ensim
(www.ensim.com) , plesk (www.plesk.com) , or cpanel (www.cpanel.net) . These
are packages that allow you do %99 of your web hosting sys admin needs via a
web browser interface. Most of them have a trial version as well.
3. Find a sys admin who will do the work for you in exchange for
access/usage of the machine.

I myself have been toying with the idea of a dedicated server myself for a
while.
I'm curious as to who you picked and why.

Thanx,
Ophir

Have you look into Redhat Linux?  FreeBSD's pthread are not easy to work 
with at this time. You might want to install instead.

You can install GNU Pth, or use the MIT pthreads, etc.

I too have been toying with the idea of a dedicated server - I wonder if
anyone might be interested in a bit of a joint venture.  Perhaps even a PHP
community dedicated server???  At least then for a low cost all of our PHP
needs could be met.

If it helps, I can supply all-in-one script to compile OpenSSL, PHP and
Apache with rewrite and proxy.

Will this help?

Why pthread?
I don't think you need that.

If you figure this out, I can provide a hosting on BSD or Linux. You can
bring your server and I can help you set it up.

Are you saying you can provide the access if we come up with the server?  To
be honest, I'm not too strong on the server end and am not sure what would
be involved - can you fill in the gaps?  Access / Server / Software...

When you set up php from the source, you need to configure it.  Don't 
remember if Apache also ask for it, too.

If it helps, I can supply all-in-one script to compile OpenSSL, PHP and
Apache with rewrite and proxy.

Will this help?

Why pthread?
I don't think you need that.

Yes and no.

We do basic open-source related hosting. You need to pay for some expense
like electric bill and a part of access. Your server needs to either
Linux/BSD/Solaris. I can help you set it up. I don't do NT/2k because of too
many reasons.

Do you do any socially minded projects? Non-profit related?

The company I work for takes care of such requests (except for creating virtual hosts and adding users etc, which are day to day administration tasks). We will install php and apache the way you want it to be installed if you let us know up front. We also provide managed services where you pay us an additional fee and never have to touch your box. We will do absolutely anything you need.

I'm sure there are other companies like this out there and being the *cheapest* is not our *thing*. If you're interested, please contact me for more info.

Shawn,

I am sure that nyphp.org can supply you with a virtual server if you need it
for PHP development and non-profit use. Drop Hans (hans at nyphp.org) an email
for more info.

I suggest using Redhat Linux.  That way we both have a frame to work with.
Linux is good for a reason that alot of people who uses php know at least a
little bit.  This way I can walk you thru some basic stuff and you can
figure out the more advance stuff at your own time.  This will at least get
some stuff up an running quick while give you some time to learn...  What do
you think?

Yes, on Linux is easier, getting things compiled or getting RPM or DEB (the
scale of compilers).

My only complaint is that there are lots of packages I need to maintain.
Just because of some OpenSSL vulnerability on Linux, there have been several
occasions to do quick upgrades which can take much time.

At times, I get the feeling Linux is less secure. This is way I track
Openwall if you are not familiar with it. Check it out.

BSD gives much higher stability and your programming investment will last
longer. If I were you, give BSD a good try. Once you set, you will be
cruising. You can use this board to have others help you debug...

Chalu--

Any reason why you included the text of the original message twice?

Not to start a holy war, but more as an observation.

Perhaps you have a valid point, but you have not demonstrated it here. All 
recent OpenSSL vulnerabilities have affected all platforms using OpenSSL, 
this includes *BSD.

> At times, I get the feeling Linux is less secure. This is way I track
> Openwall if you are not familiar with it. Check it out.

I think what you *really* meant to say was "...the feeling <Insert Distro 
Here> is less secure." Linux is a *kenerl* nothing more. What various people 
do to package that kernel is left to that group and those who choose to use 
it. Also, you don't mention *which* flavor of BSD you are speaking of...

I do find it very interesting that Yahoo! is moving more and more towards 
Linux based machines (For those who care, Linux rocks BSD for running MySQL) 
for many of the reasons you give for liking *BSD.

.r ( who runs both Debian and FreeBSD )

Since early August (when NYPHP.org was colocated as it's own server) we've
offered rooted FreeBSD jails for Open Source development
(http://xs.projects.nyphp.org for instance) projects.  These are full blown
virtual servers, where you can compile/configure/etc just about everything
you need, and play around with it.

Does this mean you can host non-computer-related-non-profit.org or
ebusiness.com with us?  No; for that, use one of the many great commercial
hosting solutions offered by list members (PLUG: I administer
http://thehostingcompany.us  :)

This is not a hosting service, but rather a SourceForge on steriods, with
access to the host's sysadmin (me) and root access, giving you maximum
flexibility and support for development and education.

Lastly, if there are people who are experienced with these types of things
(jails, sysadmin, scripting, etc) we'd be interested in forming an
admin/support staff group, allowing many projects to be hosted
(bandwidth/hardware resources are not at issue - just time).  And it looks
great on a resume  :)

Excellent, it'll be good to work with you.

A website mirror per se, not really, but a system mirror wouldn't be turned
away  :)

Sorry, can't be much help - use freenode or efnet  :)

I'd be very interested in helping out with all of this myself.

If I can wing it soon, and if there is any interest, I might be able to 
come up with a Mac OS X box. That would allow people to compile for 
multiple platforms, and test on the different platforms too. If there 
is interest I guess I could talk with Hans about putting it out there 
for people.

Or whatever.

Though I am probably the only *nix freak who loves OS X around here.

:)

I dont know how much of , php forget about it.
a benefit a rooted jail is in comparison to a regular user account if the
purpose is simplty to privide a user account.  The way i see it someone
either wants to learn to be a unix sysadmin or a developer.  To be a
sysadmin its better to get a real root access but to be a developer the
normal user account is fine i think.

But anyway i like the idea of setting up a server just for development.  I
myself setup a machine in my college just for that purpose for students of
my school.  I figured that the Unix servers school provides to students are
pretty useless for development.  The main student server still has the gcc
version is 2.95.2 , and to get cgi once has to fill out forms with the IS
depertment, php forget about it.  But even the servers that are set up for
specialized courses where the TA or the professor with have enough sence to
put the things the student need on it the general student dont get access
unless they are in the course.

Having said all that.
Most student are in general "unix morons"  the reason being that they never
used it.  The environment of choice these days is yes you guessed it
Microsoft Visual Studios. NET

I agree, to an extent.  The two (dev/sysadmin) are related, and go
hand-in-hand, to a point.

Right... and I'm not trying to be a design/layout person, but in most
circles, you're not lucky enough to have a perfectly balanced staff.

Exactly... and that means, to some extent, knowing a bit about sysadmin work
(for instance, in FreeBSD use adduser to add a user, if you're root).

Sysadmin isn't my bread and butter either, but it is something that's always
needed, and as a result I've picked it up.  As a developer, you can depend on
someone else (if you're fortunate enough to have the resources) to setup
things to meet your needs, or you'll need to learn a bit about it.

NYPHP.org tries to offer the best of both worlds.  For one, giving the
support developers need to get a system up and running, and providing the
framework for letting them do what they're best at, code.  But at the same
time, having what so many wish they had; a "personal", knowledgable sysadmin
"on call" to learn from and work with.  Plus, with such a close-knit
community, often the sysadmins are developers as well, which is even more
valuable.

Maybe it's just because I've always had root (since I've also been the
sysadmin on the boxes I develop :) but a simple user account is rarely
enough, especially when developing from the ground up.

User accounts are a dime a dozen, and it may be a good way to get started. 
For instance, people who just want to develop can get a user account on a
shared, generic, system, and as their needs increase, be moved to a more
dedicated environment with the help of other developers and the sysadmin.
