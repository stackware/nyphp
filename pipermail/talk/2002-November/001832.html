<PRE>Morning All,
i agree with what was said below about being a developer or a sysadmin, it's
the same comparison with being a graphics designer or a developer. what you
may be over looking is the benefit of at least knowning the tools the
designer(s) use, because you will then understand the needs of the
designers, and how to comunicate with people who often have so idea what you
are saying. you see i'm not trying be as sysadmin because i am a programmer,
i just need to be able to have more control over the enviroment then i have
with a shared hosting account. i care nothing about many sectors of being a
sysadmin, security being the one issue i have no time to deal with. as i say
do what you're good at and the rest will follow.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; my whole objective with my server was to not only have a for/non

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; developement enviroment but also to gain the experience needed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; facilitate my/others needs. what do you mean nyphp could provide
</I>space?
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since early August (when NYPHP.org was colocated as it's own server)
</I>we've
&gt;<i> &gt; offered rooted FreeBSD jails for Open Source development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (<A HREF="http://xs.projects.nyphp.org">http://xs.projects.nyphp.org</A> for instance) projects.  These are full
</I>&gt;<i> blown
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtual servers, where you can compile/configure/etc just about
</I>everything
&gt;<i> &gt; you need, and play around with it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dont know how much of , php forget about it.
</I>&gt;<i> a benefit a rooted jail is in comparison to a regular user account if the
</I>&gt;<i> purpose is simplty to privide a user account.  The way i see it someone
</I>&gt;<i> either wants to learn to be a unix sysadmin or a developer.  To be a
</I>&gt;<i> sysadmin its better to get a real root access but to be a developer the
</I>&gt;<i> normal user account is fine i think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But anyway i like the idea of setting up a server just for development.  I
</I>&gt;<i> myself setup a machine in my college just for that purpose for students of
</I>&gt;<i> my school.  I figured that the Unix servers school provides to students
</I>are
&gt;<i> pretty useless for development.  The main student server still has the gcc
</I>&gt;<i> version is 2.95.2 , and to get cgi once has to fill out forms with the IS
</I>&gt;<i> depertment, php forget about it.  But even the servers that are set up for
</I>&gt;<i> specialized courses where the TA or the professor with have enough sence
</I>to
&gt;<i> put the things the student need on it the general student dont get access
</I>&gt;<i> unless they are in the course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having said all that.
</I>&gt;<i> Most student are in general &quot;unix morons&quot;  the reason being that they
</I>never
&gt;<i> used it.  The environment of choice these days is yes you guessed it
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft Visual Studios. NET
