</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;And, as PHPCon will be in New York in the Spring, if anyone has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;any questions on the conference, I would be more than happy to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;answer them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I know I certainly have a few for this group. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By all means; that's what we do  :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fantastic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps we can block out some general questions to hash out on the list
</I>&gt;<i> and provide a topic for discussion in future NYPHP meetings.
</I>
Sounds good.  By no means do I want speak for others on the list, but I'll
try to get the ball rolling by voicing my opinions.  I encourage everyone to
do the same, as we have a rare opportunity to forge a national conference to
be as informative and useful as possible.

&gt;<i> Tracks. Currently we are blocking out three tracks with the option for a
</I>&gt;<i> fourth if the need arises. Current proposals for tracks are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Enterprise
</I>This is always a hot topic, and may include performance tweaking and proper
programing techniques.

&gt;<i> - Application Development
</I>Very broad.

&gt;<i> - XML
</I>Same with this.

&gt;<i> - Education (PHP in an academic setting)
</I>This is interesting to me.  I work at NYU, and depending on the details of
what this track entails, may be able to help out.  There must be others who
work in an academic (non-profit?) setting and are using PHP.

&gt;<i> - CMS
</I>&gt;<i> - Web Services
</I>Hand in hand with XML IMHO.

&gt;<i> Additional suggestions? Comments on those listed?
</I>
I always feel that a large part of PHP is left out, that being local
scripting and CLI.  We use PHP through crons to mine data from Oracle/MySQL
and couldn't be happier.  Considering the other language choices and the
various DB support, PHP really is the only answer.

&gt;<i> General Theme. What are the problems that you are looking to solve?
</I>
PHP recognized as more than just an &quot;HTML embedded scripting language&quot;

&gt;<i> What are you looking to take away from the conference?
</I>
This is a toughy.  Offhand, probably the satisfaction of feeling that PHP has
been launched into the eastern seaboard, and has a strong development
community.  Also, possibly, the continued support of companies, following
suit of Yahoo!.

&gt;<i> Why will you be attending PHPCon East 2003? 
</I>
Why wouldn't I?  :)

&gt;<i> Sessions and Speakers. Are there specific sessions or speakers you would
</I>&gt;<i> like to see at PHPCon East 2003? Judging from what you have seen of the
</I>&gt;<i> sessions from PHPCon (<A HREF="http://www.php-con.com/2002/agenda.php">http://www.php-con.com/2002/agenda.php</A>), where do
</I>&gt;<i> we need to improve?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keynotes. Rasmus has penciled us into calendar and will likely be
</I>&gt;<i> delivering one of the keynotes. I have some ideas for a second but I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to hear suggestions. 
</I>
In general terms, more of the same.  Sessions concerning
enterprise/scalability/XML/design/etc are always useful, and always something
that could use reinforcement.

&gt;<i> Tutorials. We did not provide hands-on tutorials for the first PHPCon
</I>&gt;<i> but feel it is a necessary addition.
</I>
Very much so.

&gt;<i> What topics are would you be interested in seeing offered?
</I>
I'd like to have some of the core PHP developers give an indepth/&quot;hands
dirty&quot; look at performance tweaking, from PHP land and Zend land.  Of course,
a technical look at the session topics mentioed above would be valuable, as
well.

&gt;<i> Are you more interested in 3 or 6 hour tutorials?
</I>The more I can pick their brains, the better  :)

&gt;<i> What are your requirements for attending (material to take away, PC
</I>&gt;<i> provided vs. bring your own laptop, &amp;c.)?
</I>
Reference material to take away would be useful, but obviously speakers that
I know know the source.

&gt;<i> I would like to encourage everyone on this list to participate either in
</I>&gt;<i> the discussion, at the actual conference, or as a media sponsor (banner
</I>&gt;<i> exchange, email promotion, &amp;c.).
</I>
Thank you, and I look forward to working together in a large and diverse
capacity.

&gt;<i> We had wonderful support from the Bay
</I>&gt;<i> Area with the first PHPCon and I suspect, by what I've already seen on
</I>&gt;<i> both on and off the list, that the local NY PHP community will be just
</I>&gt;<i> as active. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We will be making an open call for papers if anyone is interested in
</I>&gt;<i> participating as a speaker. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, as before, we will be accepting Birds-of-a-Feather (BoFs) and
</I>&gt;<i> Works-in-Progress (WiPs) up to the day of the event.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I realize there are quite a few questions above, and I don't expect
</I>&gt;<i> answers on everything, but any feedback I can take in will make for a
</I>&gt;<i> better conference experience.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we set a good tone with the first PHPCon and generated some
</I>&gt;<i> positive press for PHP and its community. Our goal is to make this a
</I>&gt;<i> very important event for PHP developers and I think we heading in that
</I>&gt;<i> direction. Thanks to everyone for their help.
</I>
Thank you Bryan.  I'm sure PHP-Con 2003 East will be great and NYPHP is here
to help, allowing you to put your ear to the ground, here in the East.

Best,
