<PRE>Mark,

We'll put something up as soon as we are done with ossuite.org website.  For
the time being, we'll try to utilize sourceforge.net to meet our agenda.  

If you would like to participate, we would love to talk to you in person so
that you have a clear view of what is going on and the technical directive.
We meet twice a week: Wednesday evening with dinner served for active
members only and Sunday afternoon.  Drop me a line if you want to come by.
Thanks.

Larry

Hi Larry:
Is there a project managment tool online? or have to go to your office for
the developer meeting?

offer. I take a ring check for now since we
have all the required hardware already. Right now, we just need more
programmers or scripters, whichever suite you better. We have no problem
mentioning names either Donald J. Organ IV, if you're serious about helping
out. ;0)

BTW, for the CRM component, we were thinking about template language. Does
anybody have personal experience with Smarty or FastTemplate? Please share
the pros and cons.

Larry

I'm sure you have what you need Larry, but should you need a virtual private
server (meaning root and whatever specially configured daemons/etc), the
NYPHP projects server is online with capacity to spare. Just say the word
and I'll set an instance up for you.
