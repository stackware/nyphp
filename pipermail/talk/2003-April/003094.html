<PRE>Chris,

&gt;<i>You can't really do that. When someone clicks a link, their browser sends
</I>an
&gt;<i>HTTP GET request. If someone wanted to write their own form that used a
</I>method
&gt;<i>of &quot;get&quot; and submitted to the same URL, they could reproduce this exact
</I>same
&gt;<i>request. Of course, they could also just manually send their own GET
</I>request,
&gt;<i>though that is less convenient.
</I>
I'm aware of all this.

&gt;<i>I'm not sure what sort of security you think is lessened by this fact.
</I>
I know this does not make much sense when you don't know what the project
is.  Unfortunately I can not reveal any details at this point. This is a
client's project.  The significant fact is that for a specific reason the
users will want to link to the some scripts by submitting a form instead of
clicking on an &lt;a href&gt; link.  I know there is no difference on the back end
whether the request came from a form or a &lt;a href&gt; link, but it's not really
about the back end. The request needs to come from an &lt;a href&gt; link, period.
I know it sounds weird but trust me there is a very good reason for that.

&gt;<i>If you are wanting to make sure people can only access a particular page,
</I>it is best
&gt;<i>to use sessions or something and just make sure that person has access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you are particularly concerned that the user clicked your specific link,
</I>you
&gt;<i>can use something like a shared secret. For example, when you generate the
</I>&gt;<i>link, attach a URL variable to it that you also keep on the server (in the
</I>&gt;<i>session or something). You can then check to ensure that this URL variable
</I>is
&gt;<i>correct when determining whether the user can access the page.
</I>
None of these would apply. I forgot to mention that the links will be placed
on third party sites (or rather extranet sites) by other webmasters. In
addition to checking the referer header against a database containing
qualified referer URL's, I also need to make sure that they are not linking
from a form. Again, sounds weird but you need to trust me.

&gt;<i>Maybe that gives you some ideas. I recommend, however, that you don't
</I>concern
&gt;<i>yourself with what happens on the client. This can lead to a false sense of
</I>&gt;<i>security. It is best to consider each HTTP request as a request that can
</I>truly
&gt;<i>be anything. Use your own programming logic to determine the rest.
</I>
This usually applies to all my other projects but this one is really
different.


Thank you much for your help .. cheers!

Jerry
