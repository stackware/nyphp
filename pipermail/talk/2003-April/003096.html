<PRE>ok - dunno what I'm talking about, but could you possible append some sort
of hash value to the href - which could only be generated by your script and
not any third party?  Make the key available only to the valid websites in
order for them to generate it - and don't accept anything that does have a
submit.

-&gt;
-&gt; Chris,
-&gt;
-&gt; &gt;You can't really do that. When someone clicks a link, their
-&gt; browser sends
-&gt; an
-&gt; &gt;HTTP GET request. If someone wanted to write their own form that used a
-&gt; method
-&gt; &gt;of &quot;get&quot; and submitted to the same URL, they could reproduce this exact
-&gt; same
-&gt; &gt;request. Of course, they could also just manually send their own GET
-&gt; request,
-&gt; &gt;though that is less convenient.
-&gt;
-&gt; I'm aware of all this.
-&gt;
-&gt; &gt;I'm not sure what sort of security you think is lessened by this fact.
-&gt;
-&gt; I know this does not make much sense when you don't know what the project
-&gt; is.  Unfortunately I can not reveal any details at this point. This is a
-&gt; client's project.  The significant fact is that for a specific reason the
-&gt; users will want to link to the some scripts by submitting a form
-&gt; instead of
-&gt; clicking on an &lt;a href&gt; link.  I know there is no difference on
-&gt; the back end
-&gt; whether the request came from a form or a &lt;a href&gt; link, but
-&gt; it's not really
-&gt; about the back end. The request needs to come from an &lt;a href&gt;
-&gt; link, period.
-&gt; I know it sounds weird but trust me there is a very good reason for that.
-&gt;
-&gt; &gt;If you are wanting to make sure people can only access a
-&gt; particular page,
-&gt; it is best
-&gt; &gt;to use sessions or something and just make sure that person has access.
-&gt; &gt;
-&gt; &gt;If you are particularly concerned that the user clicked your
-&gt; specific link,
-&gt; you
-&gt; &gt;can use something like a shared secret. For example, when you
-&gt; generate the
-&gt; &gt;link, attach a URL variable to it that you also keep on the
-&gt; server (in the
-&gt; &gt;session or something). You can then check to ensure that this
-&gt; URL variable
-&gt; is
-&gt; &gt;correct when determining whether the user can access the page.
-&gt;
-&gt; None of these would apply. I forgot to mention that the links
-&gt; will be placed
-&gt; on third party sites (or rather extranet sites) by other webmasters. In
-&gt; addition to checking the referer header against a database containing
-&gt; qualified referer URL's, I also need to make sure that they are
-&gt; not linking
-&gt; from a form. Again, sounds weird but you need to trust me.
-&gt;
-&gt; &gt;Maybe that gives you some ideas. I recommend, however, that you don't
-&gt; concern
-&gt; &gt;yourself with what happens on the client. This can lead to a
-&gt; false sense of
-&gt; &gt;security. It is best to consider each HTTP request as a request that can
-&gt; truly
-&gt; &gt;be anything. Use your own programming logic to determine the rest.
-&gt;
-&gt; This usually applies to all my other projects but this one is really
-&gt; different.
-&gt;
-&gt;
-&gt; Thank you much for your help .. cheers!
-&gt;
-&gt; Jerry
