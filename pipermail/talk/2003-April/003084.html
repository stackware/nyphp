9:00am - 10:00am     	&quot;Road to a Service-Based Architecture&quot;
			Ted Schadler - Principal Analyst, 
			Forrester Research
			
Web services standards are lowering the barriers to business and
application integration.  But companies need more than just SOAP and
WSDL...they must implement a service-oriented architecture to transform
a simple Web service into a system for establishing and managing
connections to customers, partners, and suppliers.  This first
presentation will introduce a roadmap for building a service-oriented
architecture including best practices and technologies.

10:00 - 10:10		Break

10:10 - 10:55am    	&quot;The Network is the Application - Exploiting the
			Service-Based Architecture&quot;
			Drew Engstrom, SR. Market Strategist - Web Services, 
			Sun Microsystems

Revolutionary or evolutionary? Continuous or discontinuous? Still 
trying to get beyond the Web Services hype and find out what these new 
technologies can offer your company? This presentation will examine the
impacts of a service-based architecture on network systems, software
development and business strategy. In this presentation, you will learn
both Sun Microsystems' vision of where current IT trends are taking the
market and Sun Microsystems' roadmap for navigating the way. Critical 
points will
be supported with customer examples and market data.
			
			
10:55am - 11:05am	Break

11:05am - 11:50am      	&quot;Web Services Applied - Case Studies&quot;
