<PRE>I believe you can use $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] within the included file and it
will return the path/name of the includer file.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Who include()'d me?


 
Quick question:
Anyone know if there is a constant or something that contains the name
of the file that &quot;I&quot; was included into.
 
e.g.
 
includer.php:
&lt;? include(&quot;codefile.inc&quot;);
    etc etc etc;
?&gt;
 
codefile.inc:
&lt;?
    [declare some functions, resolve world hunger, etc...]
   [but how do I figure out that I was used by &quot;includer.php&quot;?]
?&gt;

 
I know about _FILE_, if I use it, it'll just return who the current file is
...
and no I don't want to pass it as an argument. Looking for something more
elegant.
 
Let me know if I am not making sense. Thanks.
 
-Eddy
