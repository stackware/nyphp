<PRE>Say you named a cookie 'player_type' in another script and assigned a value
of 'real' or 'wmp' to it...
Reading the value back would go something like this...
 
if(isset($_COOKIE['player_type'])) {
    if($_COOKIE['player_type'] == &quot;wmp&quot;) {
        //...statements/output for WMP
    }
    else {
        //...statements/output for REAL player 
    }
}
 
else {
    // Cookie doesn't exist... do whatever...
}

etting



There's really no need for me to save the user's state on the server side of
things; all I need to do is set (and then, later, read) the cookie.

I've read the feature on php.net about cookies, but it simply talks about
creating them. What I'll need to do is have a PHP script in the popup player
that reads the cookie and outputs the code for the correct media player.
How do I do this?

Sounds like a plan... unless you foresee a use for maintaining state info 
down the line, and reliability isn't important (since clearing your cookies 
will wipe out your preference), then it's not worth the work, as Rolan 
suggested. Then again, if reliability isn't an issue, is it worth any effort

at all in trying to retain the pref? That's your preference... :)

register/login is way morethan i need here; a simple cookie with the stored 
preference will do. If they don't choose a preferred player, they don't get 
the player. Simple as that.

...or require them to register/login, which would be more reliable since you


can store/retrieve the prefs server-side using sessions. Maybe you already 
have an existing login process, which would make it that much easier to 
implement.
