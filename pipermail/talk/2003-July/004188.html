<PRE>Is upgrading as simple as uploading and overwriting the older PHP with the
latest 
version or is this going to get hairy and play havoc with the sites I'm 
hosting that are built with 4..2.2?
=======================================
Yes, it is that easy to upgrade, but make sure you test everything first. We
ran into an issue with 4.3.1's mssql_bind function not working properly, but
it was fixed in 4.3.2. Just make sure you have a plan to revert in case
things don't go as expected.

I'm not sure which version started defaulting to register_globals being OFF,
but if things do not work properly, you can try turning them on in the .ini
file as a temporary solution (that's if your sites do not all use
superglobal references). Just note that having them on is less secure, and
you should eventually try to clean up any existing code to use the new
method. If there are a number of people publishing to this box, there is a
good chance some sites are using the old, ugly method. Something to keep in
mind...

OOPPS - I transposed the version. I wrote 4.4.2 at one point and then did 
the right way later. Sory about that.  I am definitely running 4.2.2.

But the point is, do you think if I upgrade to 4.3 that will resolve the 
problem?

I run the site on a Rackshack dedicated server that I manage. Is upgrading 
as simple as uploading and overwriting the older PHP with the latest 
version or is this going to get hairy and play havoc with the sites I'm 
hosting that are built with 4..2.2?

TIA
