If your session is dependent on the status of a cookie, you need to set your
cookie to expire when the browser is closed (i.e. ccokie lifetime = 0). You
can put a timestamp in the session and manualy kill the session if it was
created more than 20 minutes ago.

  Does anyone know of a way to not only have the session expire when the
cookies do when also when the browser closes, right now I am using:
session_set_cookie_params( 1200,"/","dorgan.serveftp.net");

  Now I know that, will make the session expire after 20 minutes but how do
I have the session expire not only after 20 minutes but when the browser is
closed.

I'm sure there are creative ways of having a cookie expiration date *and*
terminate the session when the browser closes, but it's much simpler to just
have the cookie expire when the browser closes (by putting no expiration date).
Does this help, or do you really need both?

Hello all!

I'm wondering if anyone has experience with multipart-related html emails.

I'd like to send out an html email with embedded images, that do NOT reference
an external img src, but rather another "part" of the email.

For eaxample, the first part is the html code, which references an image
thusly (it's quoted-printable):
*************************************************
<IMG src=3D"file:email2.gif">
*************************************************

as a second part, the image is encoded:
*************************************************
------=_NextPart_000_0000_01C35826.C5C0BC10
Content-Type: image/gif
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Location: file:email2.gif

R0lGODlh8wF3AdUAAP///wAAAP8B/wAA/wD/AP8AAAH///7/AKWlpUNDQzHDw39/f/+5uf96eqam
<snip>
*************************************************

My questions are:
1. Does anyone know how well supported across email clients
"multipart-related" emails are?

2. Does anyone know of a freely available script for authoring these?

Thanks all!

I had this same need and found this bit of code on the web which I modified
a bit to suit my need.  I can't remember where I got it, and I would like to
give credit back to the original author, but they didn't put anything into
the comments.

The function should send any kind of file as part of a multi-part email.  I
used it for a gif.  In testing it, it seemed to work fine.  In terms of
compatibility, I did find that one webmail client (IMP) didn't handle the
attachment correctly, but forwarding it to another mail client from IMP was
fine.  Outlook 97 handles it fine.

Hope this helps.

Mike

Here it is.

<?php 
// Read POST request params into global vars 

function mail_attachment
($to,$from,$subject,$message,$file_location,$filename) {

/*
if you want to play with the function, just uncomment what you want from
this section and shove some values in.

$to      = $_POST['to']; 
$from    = $_POST['from']; 
$subject = $_POST['subject']; 
$message = $_POST['message'];

$to="someone at somewhere.com";
$subject="test attachment";
$message="this is just a test.";
$file_location="/www/yourserver/somewhere/";
$filename="yourfile.gif";
*/


//File uploads in PHP 4.1 are placed in a special $_FILES array, so we fetch
the values we need out of it:

// Obtain file upload vars 
$fileatt      = $_FILES['fileatt']['tmp_name']; 
$fileatt_type = $_FILES['fileatt']['type']; 
$fileatt_name = $_FILES['fileatt']['name'];

//For the sake of brevity, we'll assume that the required parameters ($to
and $from) now have valid values (email addresses) in them. Normally we
would check their format with regular expressions.

//Next, we use the $from value to begin building the extra headers for the
email:

$headers = "From: $from";

//Next we check the $fileatt variable, which may or may not contain the path
and filename to an uploaded file attachment. We use PHP's is_uploaded_file
function to find out:

if (file_exists($file_location.$filename)) { 
 // Read the file to be attached ('rb' = read binary) 
 $file = fopen($file_location.$filename,'rb'); 
 $data = fread($file,filesize($file_location.$filename)); 
 fclose($file);

//Having read in the data for the file attachment, we need to set up the
message headers to send a multipart/mixed message:

 // Generate a boundary string 
 $semi_rand = md5(time()); 
 $mime_boundary = "==Multipart_Boundary_x{$semi_rand}x"; 
  
 // Add the headers for a file attachment 
 $headers .= "\nMIME-Version: 1.0\n" . 
             "Content-Type: multipart/mixed;\n" . 
             " boundary=\"{$mime_boundary}\"";

//Now for the message body itself. This works just as we saw for the text
part of a mixed message in the previous section:

 // Add a multipart boundary above the plain message 
 $message = "This is a multi-part message in MIME format.\n\n" . 
            "--{$mime_boundary}\n" . 
            "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"\n" . 
            "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\n\n" . 
            $message . "\n\n";

//Now, to allow for binary file types, we need to use Base64 encoding to
convert the (possibly binary) file attachment data to a text-only format
suitable for sending by email. All email programs in popular use support
Base64 encoding of file attachments, so this is the best way to go.
Fortunately, PHP provides a function for Base64 encoding:

 // Base64 encode the file data 
 $data = chunk_split(base64_encode($data));

//We now have everything we need to write the portion of the message that
contains the file attachment. Here's the code:

 // Add file attachment to the message 
 $message .= "--{$mime_boundary}\n" . 
             "Content-Type: {$fileatt_type};\n" . 
             " name=\"{$filename}\"\n" . 
             "Content-Disposition: attachment;\n" . 
             " filename=\"{$filename}\"\n" . 
             "Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n\n" . 
             $data . "\n\n" . 
             "--{$mime_boundary}--\n"; 
}

//That completes the modifications necessary to accommodate a file
attachment. We can now send the message with a quick call to mail:

// Send the message 
$ok = @mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers); 
/*if ($ok) { 
 echo "<p>Mail sent! Yay PHP!</p>"; 
} else { 
 echo "<p>Mail could not be sent. Sorry!</p>"; 
} 
*/
return $ok;
} //end of function
?>

This looks similar enough to one that I worked up... although mine seems
to have some unknown problem with Lotus Notes (1 client uses that so I
had to go with a PERL module solution for their site instead).

However, I found that the chunk_split() would insert a literal space
every chucklen (default of 76) which was totally screwing everything up.

So I just nixed the chunk_split() and it worked ok, except for Lotus
Notes.. but who cares about that ;)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] eating cookies in IE on XP?
Message-ID: <E19ieFT-00018R-9U@rslrs1-server.com>

Does anyone know of an issue with (php) cookies in IE on XP (at least I
think it's XP, it's not my machine, it's a remote client's) where if the
cookie's expiration is set to sometime in the past it is still somehow
returns true for
isset($_COOKIE['foo']);

It doesn't happen to me with Mozilla/Linux and I don'to have an XP box
to test with.

I'm guessing that I if I have to, changing the value of the cookie to a
string I can check, like $_COOKIE['foo'] = "EXPIRE", will be a
reasonable workaround.

Thanks....

Mike,

Thanks very much! Just after I sent my message to the list I found a great
script for sending complex emails called PHPMailer
<http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/>

Below is the code that I used to send an HTML email with an embedded image.
Note the src value of the image -- it uses a "protocol" called "cid:" which I
must investigate. Seems like that must refer to another "part" in the
multipart message....

********************************************

<?php
require("class.phpmailer.php");
$mail = new PHPMailer();
$mail->From     = "sender at mydomain.com";
$mail->FromName = "Sample Name";
$mail->Host     = "smtp.mydomain.com";
$mail->Mailer   = "smtp";
$mail->IsHTML(true);
$mail->AddEmbeddedImage("foo.gif", "my-attach", "foo.gif");
$mail->Body = 'Embedded Image: <img alt="PHPMailer" src="cid:my-attach"> Here
is an image!';

$mail->AddAddress("recipient at example.com");
if(!$mail->Send()){
   echo "Message was not sent";
   echo "Mailer Error: " . $mail->ErrorInfo;
}else{
   echo "Message has been sent";
}
?>

Do you understand how cookies work? If you answer yes, then I can skip a whole
bunch of questions. :-)

If not, at what point after "setting" the cookie's expiration date to an
expired date are you checking for its existance?

yes, I understand how cookies work... I assume you are asking if I know
that the changes won't take effect until the next page load.

I'm checking on subsequent pages after changing the expiration...

Well, that and a dozen other questions, yes. I didn't want to offend you by
asking a bunch of questions that were not the least bit helpful or insulted
your intelligence. I'm just trying to gauge the question.

Given that, there are a few methods of getting a closer look into what is going
on. If you have ethereal, tcpdump, or something like that, you can snoop the
HTTP transaction(s) in question. Because "setting" a cookie really just means
that you send a Set-Cookie response header in your HTTP response, it is
possible that you are actually setting a different cookie that is immediately
expired rather than modifying the existing cookie. The browser determines
whether the cookie identified in the Set-Cookie header is a new cookie or the
same old one, so that might account for some slight differences with regard to
different browsers, platforms, etc.

Another thing that would be helpful to do would be to examine the cookie store
of the browser. Instead of trying to expire the cookie, change the date you are
sending to be in the future (rather than the past - use the same exact code
otherwise). If the browser is in fact updating the existing cookie like you
want, you should be able to observe the change in expiration. Otherwise, there
should be an additional cookie created (which you wouldn't notice if it was
immediately expired), and you'll know that some of the cookie restrictions
aren't matching up, so the browser considers it a new cookie.

Those are some ideas. Hope that helps.

I want to make it so that people here at the company can edit info on our website, and i want to make it so that if they hit the return key within a text field, a new line will be parsed. So that instead of having to learn how to use <br> and html they will just hit the <return> key and php will know to make a new line.

Phil,
I've had EXTREMELY mixed results with the 'replace' parameter of
the header function, so I suspect it's broken in some versions of
PHP. I've had good results with combining all the Cache-Control
directives into one call to header(). I'd also add 'private' to the
list of Cache-Control params.

I was going to make the same suggestion.

Actually, "no-store" is the most extreme anti-caching directive for the
Cache-Control header, so it alone should suffice. I've always coupled it with
"no-cache" just in case some browsers misinterpret one or the other (which some
do).

Try just those two first - no sense in beating a dead horse. :-) Throw in the
"Pragma: no-cache" to prevent caching from HTTP/1.0 agents that don't
understand Cache-Control.

I've heard/seen some not so pleasant cacheing stuff from IE, whereas Mozilla
seems to respond to cache-control quite well.

Correct me, please, if I'm off base here.

There are other kinds of caching besides browser (client-side) caching.

This: http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/#KINDS is an  excellent article about all

So things should make more sense to you than the rest of us. :-)

> isn't cacheing a client (or proxy) side thing, thus
> independent of PHP?

Any Web agent can cache resources, so caching can be on the client, server, or
any intermediary (such as a proxy). Even with client caching, PHP can play a
significant role, because it allows you to modify the HTTP headers sent in the
response. Whether interpreted correctly or not, the HTTP headers in the
response are what these agents use to determine whether to cache the response.

Pertaining to your comment about the differences between Mozilla and IE, I sent
an email to this list a few months ago where I speculated about one legitimate
reason for such discrepancies. You can read it here:

http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2003-March/002828.html

Hope that helps.

I'm wondering what's the most efficient way to find out if $array1 and
$array2 contain exactly the same elements, without regard to order.
array_diff(array1,array2) "returns an array containing all the values of
array1  that are not present in any of the other arguments." according to
TFM. Assuming

$array1 = array(1,2,3);
$array2 = array(2,3,4);

then array_diff($array1,$array2) would return an array containing 1. I'd
like to get one containing (1,4). I know I could sort them both and then
test them for equality. I just wonder if there's a more efficient
technique or if I'm overlooking some native function that does this.

(FWIW, it's for a home-grown shopping cart kind of thing and the objective
is to detect whether the array of product ids they just POSTed is any
different from its counterpart in $_SESSION, to avoid doing needless
database calls).

Always gratefully,

dont think u need to sort, u could just merge results:

$array1 = array(1,2,3);
$array2 = array(2,3,4);
$array3 = array_merge(array_diff($array1, $array2), array_diff($array2,
$array1));
print_r($array3);

but i think u r right there should be a "array_diff_recursive" method or
something.

that makes sense. I ended up doing this, because all i really need is a
boolean

function isDifferent($array1,$array2) {
    return sizeof(array_diff($array1,$array2)) +
        sizeof(array_diff($array2,$array1)) > 0 ;
}

and I guess that's sane... Sane Enough, to coin a phrase

thanks!

Message-ID: <JMEHLOIOFHBEJDCDJNLOEELNDEAA.chendry@nyc.rr.com>

ok, so my POST needs to go to a secure server, and although fsockopen has
SSL support in PHP 4.3.0+, I have to make this happen in a couple of hosted
environments which are all 4.2.* ...

Before I go and mess about with cURL (which seems a bit hefty) or - dare I
say it - use perl, does anyone have any suggestions for using fsockopen or
another option which would use PHP to send POST data to a secure server?

Thanks.

I'd go with curl, especially if you're stuck with an oldish version of PHP.  Perl isn't going to gain you anything and curl is better suited for this type of thing anyway.

Ok, so in the fury of development, I have been a bit lazy in managing the

there are scripts out there that 'listen' to the inbox and removes the email

The email list software, Mailman, can be configured so that it
only sends out emails (newsletter style). Mailman automatically
handles subscribes, unsubscribes, and bounces.

You could start with manually gathering bounced messages. Then look for
common used words in these messages (such as bounced, warning, unknows
address). Based on a few rules you can determine wich mails are bounced
e-mails, there is no standarisation on bounced e-mails. To determine to
which account or e-mail address the bounced message belongs, I would put an
unique id in the header of the eNewsletter and store thus id in the
database.

Using this method you can nog filter all bounced messages, but depending on
the rules you used, filter a lot of them.

Succes, Jan

Good Day:

I'm looking for suggestions. I want to give a client:
1) ability to have online IM/chat-style meetings
2) ability to create/post a topic and have associates make suggestions and
updates

Optionally, ability to print history of an IM exchange and/or threaded
topic.

Should be opensource PHP/MySQL project. Flash okay too.

I'm sifting through the collaborative, whiteboard, shout, chat, threaded
message projects out there. Most have way too many bells and whistles like
avatars, private rooms, blacklists... 

I'm seeking a basic project for use on controlled, private, business level.

Hey Peter,

I'm just throwing a couple things out here...

> 1) ability to have online IM/chat-style meetings

Hmm, in AMP?  Jabber, or even AIM itself, might be the way to go, especially if it needs to be realtime.  Otherwise, perhaps a PHP forum of sorts, but I don't know of a realtime chat system in PHP.  Although, you mention Flash, so maybe an AMP backed system with a Flash frontend does exist... would be cool.

Some flavor of wiki I suppose, although I'm not a big fan either.

There's IRCG, which uses IRC somehow to provide real-time streaming to
PHP-enabled Web sites. There is a related project called TitanChat that I think
uses IRCG somehow. I know very little about it other than that, but you can
read more about it here:

http://schumann.cx/ircg/

A few years ago, I wrote a simple script to demonstrate how to control the size
of chunks when using chunked transfer encoding. Combined with a persistent
connection, this is how you can make "chat rooms" and the like with PHP. You
can check out my (rather lame, now that I look back at it) example here:

http://shiflett.org/tutorials/php_flush.php

Hope that helps.

I can't seem to get this (your flush example) to work on Win32. I've heard
that some versions of IE output 1 byte at a time, but it works fine from
your host with IE6. Anyone know how to get this to work with IIS? Thanks.

So you copy/pasted the code and tried it on IIS? I just want to make sure I
understand what isn't working.

That being the case, there are several things that can make flush() not work
like you want (even with Apache). Basically, any buffering is going to screw it
up, unless you can control the buffering also. For example, with ob_start() and
friends, you can ob_flush() and then flush(), and you're fine. Of course, with
Web server buffering, it's not as easy to force it to flush when you want. With
Web client buffering (like some versions of IE use to make it look like they
render faster), I've heard of some "tricks" you can use like generating a bunch
of whitespace output first.

http://www.php.net/flush has this to say:

"Several servers, especially on Win32, will still buffer the output from your
script until it terminates before transmitting the results to the browser."

So, it looks like you might be out of luck on Win32, but maybe Apache still
works, even on Windows.

Yes, unfortunately it does look that way, unless there is a way to
"convince" IIS into behaving differently. I just wanted to make sure I
wasn't overlooking anything from a PHP perspective. Thanks for the insight.

Something like this should do it:
    try {
        // For IE
        htmlsource = document.body.innerHTML
    } catch (e) {
        // For Mozilla et. all
        htmlsource = document.body.value

Kushner,

I don't think it's possible to simply get the contents of the file, but you 
can get the innerText and innerHTML of many elements by tag or id.  That 
process is pretty finicky too as it requires a cutting edge browser and well 
formed HTML.

The easiest way that I can think to approach the problem (depending on 
whether you can use PHP or whether your page content is determined before or 
after page pre-processing) is to dump the results of a PHP readfile into the 
JavaScript variable:

var pageContents = <? addslashes(readfile($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])) ?>

If all else fails, this guide is pretty handy for JS DOM element reading:

Unfortunately this isn't the case. The dynamically created page belongs to a
third party and the maximum they can do is stick in some JavaScript and
Oddcast's VHost. The VHost flash component will send parts of the HTML (that
it is embedded in) to our servers for further processing.

Beware of the recursion problem this introduces... you could easily bring a
server to its knees if that isn't corrected.

Heh, I wish I had written it myself.

It's actually something I discovered packaged along with Parasoft's WebKing 
tool.  I found it a pretty handy reference so I posted it on my development 
server for easy reference.

Anyone know why you wouldn't use p_connect to make a connection to a database?
It seems like it would be better than regular connect in every case.

Or at least does anyone know of any problems with it?

Hi Matt,

The main reason would be if you have more Web processes than Database
connections. There just wouldn't be enough to go around :(

It depends on the DB for the most part.  PHP's integration with some APIs, like OCI8 isn't 100% from what I've seen, and you can get stale connections or other odd behavior.  On Oracle, this is important, since creating and tearing down connections are extremely expensive.  With MySQL, connections open and close very quickly, and I've found it rare to see much benefit from persistent connections.

I'm designing a new user database for a personal project, and I was toying
with a different method of storing the data than I have used before.
Usually I create tables with logical column names that reference the data
in the column.

For Example:

---------------
| User        |
---------------
| id          |
| first_name  |
| last_name   |
| email       |

...
---------------

But this becomes cumbersome when you have to add fields to the table.  I
have designed a new table structure that looks like this:


---------------
| User        |
---------------
| uid         |
---------------

-----------------
| UserAttribute |
-----------------
| attribute_id  |
| uid_fk        | * foreign key to user table
| attribute     |
| value         |
-----------------

Okay.  So I've built many user databases before and never employed the
system below.  Has anyone else?  Besides the requisit JOIN that has to be
called with every SELECT, what is the downsides to using this kind of
architecture?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mysql_insert_id Strangeness
Message-ID: <3F2FB312.9030606@nyphp.org>


Bonjour,


I've got a strange situation here, and I'm hoping it's something I'm overlooking, rather than a bug.


The setup:

MySQL 4.0.13-max-log
PHP 4.3.2 running as a DSO under Apache 1.3.28
FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE 

MySQL is the mysql.com binary package; everything else is compiled from source


The table:  

CREATE TABLE `links` (
  `linkid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `link` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`linkid`),
  UNIQUE KEY `link` (`link`)
) TYPE=MyISAM;


The code:

<?php
$MYDB = mysql_connect('localhost','xxx','xxx');


$links = array('http://hans.zaunere.com',
               'http://zaunere.com',
               'http://hans.zaunere.com',
               'http://nyphp.org',
               'http://lists.nyphp.org',
               'http://nyphp.org'
              );


foreach( $links as $key => $link ) {

   $tmp = mysql_escape_string($link);

   mysql_query("INSERT INTO xxx.links (linkid,link)
                VALUES (NULL,'$tmp')", $MYDB);

   $R_linkid = mysql_insert_id($MYDB);

   if( !$R_linkid ) {
      $result = mysql_query("SELECT linkid FROM xxx.links WHERE link='$tmp'", $MYDB);
      echo '<pre>Selected '.mysql_num_rows($result).' rows.</pre>';
      $R_linkid = (int) mysql_result($result,0,0);
   }

   echo "<pre>Array key: $key <br>Link: $link <br>Linkid: $R_linkid </pre><br><br>";
}



The output:

Array key: 0 
Link: http://hans.zaunere.com 
Linkid: 1 

Array key: 1 
Link: http://zaunere.com 
Linkid: 2 

Array key: 2 
Link: http://hans.zaunere.com 
Linkid: 2 

Array key: 3 
Link: http://nyphp.org 
Linkid: 3 

Array key: 4 
Link: http://lists.nyphp.org 
Linkid: 4 

Array key: 5 
Link: http://nyphp.org 
Linkid: 4 


The problem:

It seems that mysql_insert_id() returns the inserted ID from the previous 'successful' INSERT query, rather than it getting reset to 0 since the immedieately previous INSERT fails to produce an AUTO_INCREMENT ID (as it's documented).  I sure hope I'm missing something; otherwise this bug is burning me in ways I have yet to discover.

Thanks,

H

I believe the best way to normalize your tables is to apply the concept 
of wether the information is related to that ID and is not going to 
change or need to be archived. For example the users first and last 
name and username/password and date of birth, etc are only related to 
this user and there is no reason to have additional tables, Addresses 
on the other hand can change and history can be important depending on 
your project so a separate table for them is appropriate.

Your structure is good for random data that will change or be added 
later but for specific data that is unique to that ID and not going to 
change your prior table structure is the most efficient and easiest to 
code. Having over normalized (still up for debate) previous databases 
the data is nice and makes sense but writing extensive joins down the 
road become gruesome. I would recommend a blend of these two techniques.

Planning out your database with a nice entity diagram will make your 
life much easier and you should have the fields defined pretty well 
before you create your first table. Of course this is the old boring 
way but elliminates mistakes that will haunt you down the road.

Hope this helps.

There are a couple strange things, I am not accustom to.

Why do you define the link column as NOT NULL and then default to ''? 
Is this not the equivalent of a contradiction? I doubt this is related.

Maybe I am old school or something but I normally set my mysql_query() 
equal to something like so

$sql = "INSERT into table blah blah";
$res = mysql_query($sql) or die("Error insert");
$new_id = mysql_insert_id($res); 	# The $res is not needed, it default 
to the last result set returned.

This is a little different than you have it. Maybe try it and see what 
happens.

Good Luck

i had been thinking of that as well.  i think you're right about the JOIN
nightmare to follow.  i just wanted someone else to tell me that it would
be a nightmare, so i wasn't not trying it because it seemed too abastract.

thanks!

I've done the "normalize to the point of abnormality" and personally don't find it worth; especially in this type of situation.  Normalization can be cumbersome in its own way and every environment (and developer) warrants a balance between the two.

I've always used mysql_pconnect and haven't had any problems with it,
perhaps because, as you say, it works very quickly. I guess I copped the
pconnect style from original db connect scripts when I was first
learning and, since it wasn't broke, never thought about it again.


off the subject... maybe I should just DL my own copy of the PHP manual,
but is it me or is the php.net site really slow right now?

Defaulting to '' means it'll default to the empty string, which is different from a NULL column.  You're right as in this case it probably isn't related, but I'm not a fan of NULL columns :)

Hmm, I'd take another look here.  For INSERT statements, mysql_query() will only return TRUE or FALSE; not a result resource.  Furthermore, mysql_insert_id() takes a link resource; not a result resource.  Nevertheless, still no joy in trying the code.

Yeah, it's always slow  :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mysql_insert_id Strangeness
Message-ID: <E19k2XV-0008GF-IP@rslrs1-server.com>

I usually send 0 to the primary key


using the mysql client, are you able to replicate the problem? meaning,
do you get the right mysql_insert_id when performing inserts in the
mysql client

from the mysql manual:
"mysql_insert_id() is updated after INSERT and UPDATE statements that
generate an AUTO_INCREMENT value or that set a column value to
LAST_INSERT_ID(expr). See section 6.3.6.2 Miscellaneous Functions.

Also note that the value of the SQL LAST_INSERT_ID() function always
contains the most recently generated AUTO_INCREMENT value, and is not
reset between queries because the value of that function is maintained
in the server."

They say it doesn't get reset [to zero?]

still can't get into the php.net site to look at the php manual :(  so I
can't cross check exactly what php's mysql_insert_id() is doing or for
an alternative

Russ,
That's wrong. The optional parameter that mysql_insert_id() takes should be the database connection identifier and NOT the result resource returned by the mysql_query() function.

It's just ambiguous in the documentation, but mysql_insert_id() doesn't
default to 0 for this insert fail.

It's safer to check the return value of mysql_query in this case (will
return false if insertion fails).

Looking at the source code (file php-4.3.2/ext/mysql/php_mysql.c), the
insert_id value gets set under the "get_info:" label in the
mysql_read_query_result function, there's no variable reset on error, so
what you describe is the expected behavior (codewise).

Using LAST_INSERT_ID() in SQL can also be misleading, as it gets calculated
before insertion (and thus key validation), so it might increase even if
the query fails.

Bonjour,


I've got a strange situation here, and I'm hoping it's something I'm
overlooking, rather than a bug.


The setup:

MySQL 4.0.13-max-log
PHP 4.3.2 running as a DSO under Apache 1.3.28
FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE

MySQL is the mysql.com binary package; everything else is compiled from
source


The table:

CREATE TABLE `links` (
  `linkid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `link` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`linkid`),
  UNIQUE KEY `link` (`link`)
) TYPE=MyISAM;


The code:

<?php
$MYDB = mysql_connect('localhost','xxx','xxx');


$links = array('http://hans.zaunere.com',
               'http://zaunere.com',
               'http://hans.zaunere.com',
               'http://nyphp.org',
               'http://lists.nyphp.org',
               'http://nyphp.org'
              );


foreach( $links as $key => $link ) {

   $tmp = mysql_escape_string($link);

   mysql_query("INSERT INTO xxx.links (linkid,link)
                VALUES (NULL,'$tmp')", $MYDB);

   $R_linkid = mysql_insert_id($MYDB);

   if( !$R_linkid ) {
      $result = mysql_query("SELECT linkid FROM xxx.links WHERE
link='$tmp'", $MYDB);
      echo '<pre>Selected '.mysql_num_rows($result).' rows.</pre>';
      $R_linkid = (int) mysql_result($result,0,0);
   }

   echo "<pre>Array key: $key <br>Link: $link <br>Linkid: $R_linkid
</pre><br><br>";
}



The output:

Array key: 0
Link: http://hans.zaunere.com
Linkid: 1

Array key: 1

The problem:

It seems that mysql_insert_id() returns the inserted ID from the previous
'successful' INSERT query, rather than it getting reset to 0 since the
immedieately previous INSERT fails to produce an AUTO_INCREMENT ID (as it's
documented).  I sure hope I'm missing something; otherwise this bug is
burning me in ways I have yet to discover.

Thanks,

H

An illustrative C program (below) shows the same behavior, so it doesn't seem to be anything with PHP.

And even the MySQL documentation says something different than the behavior, from: http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/mysql_insert_id.html

"Note that mysql_insert_id() returns 0 if the previous query does not generate an AUTO_INCREMENT value..."

As Carlos pointed out, this is a gross documentation ambiguity.  The statement above is false according to the actual behavior, since an INSERT that fails because of a UNIQUE index doesn't generate an AUTO_INCREMENT value, yet mysql_insert_id() doesn't return 0.  This seems like a new quirk, although I could be wrong.

I'm going to bounce this off the mysql guys and see what they say.

ok, the C code is good for comparison and isolating where the problem
might be, or at least not with PHP...
good luck

On the subject of PHP, SQL, joins and the like, I encountered something a bit weird and wanted to see what all of you had to say on it.

 This is from the manual:

"mysql_fetch_array() is an extended version of mysql_fetch_row(). In
 addition to storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array,
 it also stores the data in associative indices, using the field names as
 keys.

  If two or more columns of the result have the same field names, the
 last column will take precedence. To access the other column(s) of the
 same name, you must use the numeric index of the column or make an alias
 for the column. For aliased columns, you cannot access the contents with
 the original column name (by using 'field' in this example)."




  so I have address fields, for example, that overwrite eachother. I
 either have to make up wacky names for the database columns, or I have
 to write out AS names for each (so using Select * is out). Now why
 wouldn't they throw in an option so your results have table names in
 front? So client.zip, owner.zip, etc. could all coexist? Doesn't that
 seem reasonable?

I suppose. I bet most people in your situation either use "wacky" names such as
client_zip and owner_zip, or they alias them in the query. I see no benefit in
$foo['client.zip'] instead of $foo['client_zip'] myself. Plus, you can always
just use the enumerated array instead of the associative one.

Hope that helps.

Chris

This might have been asked here before, but I was curious, what parameters would I need in order to set up a link to allow people to contribute to a PayPal account? 

I was not sure but I thought the account had to be at least Business for it to be set up, but is that true? Can General accounts also have that kind of access, and does PHP have anything built-in to handle PayPal?

Thanx

IMHO, you'd be causing more trouble than you'd be solving.  Think
about the kind of join required to do the equivalent of:

SELECT * FROM User WHERE last_name = "Smith" AND zip_code = "90210";

(assuming last_name and zip_code are moved into UserAttribute)

Message-ID: <E19k5sg-0000B9-G2@rslrs1-server.com>

Here are the basics of my way of dealing with this... I use this all the
time, so hopefully peer review won't expose some serious flaw! :)
(besides you often end up defining a bunch of variables you don't
actually need, but, you're smart, you can figure out how to change that)


$fooFields = array("foo.id", "foo.bar");
$barFields = array("bar.id", "bar.foo");

$result = mysql_query("select * from foo, bar");

$fields = array_merge($fooFields, $barFields);

while ($content = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
    for ($f = 0; $f < count($fields); $f++) {
            ${str_replace(".", "__", $fields[$f])} = $content[$f];
    }
    echo("
        foo.id: $foo__id<br>
        foo.bar: $foo__bar<br>
        bar.id: $bar__id<br>
        foo.id: $bar__foo<br>
}


I dunno if you would consider the double-underscore to be wacky variable
names or not. For me, since I use it so frequently, it works well and I
always know which table the data is coming from.
You can, of course, change the table/column separator to whatever you
like. I found __ to be unique enough to not conflict with anything else.
The "automation" of it is also really handy when dealing with lots of
fields.

enjoy

Yes.  It guarantees access to your resources.  I don't even bother with 
cookies, because managing them differs slightly from browser to browser.  
Even if users accept one cookie from you, there's no guarantee they'll 
continue to do so, thus, it's difficult to manage sessions reliably with 
them.

This can happen with cookie based sessions too if the cookie hasn't 
expired or been deleted by the next time the user arrives.

It's not a problem if you structure your system effectively.  The way to
handle situations like these is to have your session system keep track of
the last time the session was used.  If it's longer than your timeout,
kill the old session and start a new one... and if the current page
requires authorization, don't show them the stuff.

I just whipped up a new session manager which takes advantage of PHP's 
transparent session id propagation, plus some other handy tricks.  It's 
available on my website:
   http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/software/session-simple/

I'd love to get some peer review on the program, so please check it out.

Enjoy,

--Dan

I'm running a templated PHP-driven site and it dawned no me the other 
day that my template's modified date is almost  a year old. Of course, 
some of the files that get included are modified almost daily.

So, does PHP modify the HTTP headers to reflect the "last modified" 
dates of any files included, or am I reaching here?

paypal provides some php or perl code that you can add to your site.

I was working on something simmilar at one point and I was pull away from the project (I do not remember much now!).  We would keep track of the user that came into our site before we send them to paypal.  We add the user to the DB and put up a flag about the user.  When paypal send us information on payment we would autmatically remnove the flag from the db as he had paid.  

It gets tricky because once the user is sent to paypal, paypal just returns a couple of field info.  YOu got to look at the php paypal code.  A couple of the fields that paypal returned to us we used to identiy the client in our DB

Good luck,

Nestor :-)

Why don't you tell us.  Most browsers have a feature that lets you examine 
the present page's information.  In that list of info is the last modified 
field.  So, whip up some tests and tell us what you find.

Doing so saves one byte per record and it saves time when doing queries
since you only have to check for WHERE Field='' rather than having to also
do a WHERE Field IS NULL.

You don't need to use IPN. I have a site that uses PayPal to purchase gift 
certificates. On the page where the "Paypal" button is, I store the 
variables I will need in Session variable and set the "Paypal Success URL" 
to my success PHP page. When Paypal invokes my page, I get everything I

As you may have heard by now, the Apache Software Foundation has initiated a
project to develop an open source, Apache-licensed implementation of the
J2EE specification. In addition, the project is committed to certifying the
implementation as J2EE compliant. This is an ambitious goal and will present
a formidable challenge for the people involved, given the wide range of
technologies covered by the specification.

The project (tentatively named "Apache Geronimo") builds upon the many Java
projects at the Apache Software Foundation. In addition, the project is
bringing together leading members of the Castor, JBoss, MX4J and OpenEJB
communities. We would like to extend an open invitation to everyone involved
in the J2EE space, both commercial entities and talented individuals, to
join the community and build a world-class J2EE implementation.

The Apache Software Foundation is in a unique position to build a J2EE
compliant platform. Our non-profit, charity status, and our relationship
with Sun Microsystems, provides the Foundation with access to the J2EE TCKs,
making it possible to achieve certification. In addition, our flexible and
unrestrictive licensing makes it possible for a wide variety of participants
to assist in the development of Apache Geronimo, and to build their own
solutions upon the platform.

Apache Geronimo has been launched within the Apache Incubator. You can find
more information about the Incubator at http://incubator.apache.org/. To
find out more about this project or if you would like to become involved,
please send email to the incubator mailing list: general at incubator.apache.org

this is probably one of the bigger reasons for my switch to php, the fact
that there is no rather expensive certification procedure for any apps u do
build, much of the dictation on items u wanted to build into an enterprise
app had to wait for finalization from sun (a rather long time for some apis)
and then go through the j2ee process.

id really wonder how all the other companies which did have to license j2ee
to the max feel about this ... (http://java.sun.com/j2ee/compatibility.html)

not to mention the fact that php folks would not have to send a nice letter
:-)

http://java.sun.com/j2ee/vendorltr.html

i still think java is a solid well rounded robust language, but im not sure
i agree w/ the j2ee process.

Phil,

I though paypal only allowed you pass them 2 special variables.

How do you manage to pass all of your session variables to your success page. When you give control to the paypal page and paypal does not keep track of session variables, when it returns to your sucess page?

I am just curious, I am not working on this stuff any more.

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

Yep.  When mysql_query() fails, I check the value of mysql_errno().  Error 
numbers 1022 and 1062 have to do with duplicate keys on (if I recall 
correctly) primary keys and duplicate keys (or if I recall incorrectly, 
insert vs update queries).

switch ( @mysql_errno($Connection) ) {
    case 1022:
    case 1062:
        # Couldn't insert/update record due to duplicate key.
        break;

    default:
        # Some other database error.  Trap it.
        echo @mysql_error($this->SQLConnection);
        exit;

Show me your site ... And I could steal a ton from you... Unless you
check the paypal IPN .. You don't really have any real way to verify
that an order has been aproved or declined...

Make sence everyone..???

True.  But doing a type-strict comparision on the query itself, seems, well strange somehow.

Absolutely; I'll use mysql_errno() when I really need to keep things in line, but I'm almost positive the mysql_insert_id() trick works (or worked).  Especially since it's documented that way.

Oh well.  Still fishing on mysql's lists,

You bring up a good point Jon.  While the approval process can be tedious, especially for the developers and tech folk, it fares well with the "higher ups."  Just like the Intel Inside, Windows logos, and now the RedHat logo, they love to see some branding - something that says "we certify this will work, and if it doesn't, it may cost you more money but we'll fix it".

Maybe we should startup the NYPHP p2ee approval process :)

Now you got me thinking again (damn!). I have in place right now a sort of
poor-man's de facto session time-out. I am using a private directory to
save sessions (and wrapping the script to run as me in cgi mode, and
setting file permission restrictively, because it's a shared server and
there are security considerations). Old serialized session files
accumulate indefinitely unless I do something. So I have a daily cron
job/shell script that deletes all the session files whose last access
times are greater than x. I figure this is better than nothing. OTOH I
will give your code a look.

Interesting, two of our gurus (Hans and you) take different approaches to
this.  How about a debate, guys?

Well, if anyone else is interested in the answer to this question, this 
is what I've found so far:

http://us3.php.net/source.php?url=/index.php

I haven't poked around in all of the inc files that they also link to, 
but this does reveal that the authors go to some trouble to make sure 
the "real" modified date is showing up.

Thought this was interesting enough to share with the group.

Cheers,

Good morning,

Over the last couple of days I've been playing with trying to provide some search capabilities to the mailing lists, noteably Talk.  Day after day valuable information and URLs are passed around and, for the most part, lost into history.

I tried a couple of things, not finishing any of them, until I finally took the easy way out.  Warning: These are all very rough :)

-- http://lists.nyphp.org/ptips/ scrapes URLs from each NYPHP-Talk message and throws it into a table.  There's of course many improvements that could be made, but it's kind of interesting to see the links people have referred to in the past.  Also, clicking the X will deactive that link (for instance, if you find a shopping.yahoo.com or hotmail.com in the listing).

-- http://lists.nyphp.org/search.php is a full text index of all NYPHP-Talk's mail message.  Yes, it's very rough (I forgot to include the subject of the message in the result listing) but it has potential.

-- http://nyphp.org/google.php is the easy way out.  It's your basic google search of our entire site, including the mailing list archives.  The only drawback is it's not very current.  The searches are always right on (afterall, it's google) but you'll probably have to wait a few weeks to see things get updated.  That said, I made it the primary means for searching our sites, until we get something better online.


So I just thought I'd throw these out there and I'm happy to hear any feedback as to what improvements could be made, what features/functionality people would find useful, etc.

Thanks,

H

wow Hans, I was *just* thinking of this the other day in terms of 
"task/problem" type training.  There is a wealth of info in the lists, 
even tho I've been signed up for only a short time, and I wanted to 
bring some of the issues that are brought up to include these types of 
problems in my PHP/MySQL training curriculum.


thanks,
John

ok what would be extremely cool is to make ptips integrated *with* a mailing
list.  i attempted this a long time ago w/ alicemail in which ud setup
something like dummy at nyphp.org and have it attempt to help out a user by
attaching urls/info @ the bottom of emails/responses (in terms of faqs).
the hardest part about it i found is visible in ur tests (the
signatures/keys/urls which pertain to nothing in the topic).

does "x"ing a link out remove it from all pertaining links?

very cool hans.

This seems simple enough, but maybe it isn't that simple... Does anyone know
of a way to have PHP return the top level document's location? Basically I
have a script that references PHP_SELF... if you throw it into a frameset,
it naturally returns the frame source URL, not the frameset's.

As far as I know, a frameset is a client-side thing, so PHP wouldn't know anything about it natively.  You could, perhaps, have some kind of Javascript callback to a php script, but I don't really know how you'd do it in JS :)

I will be testing the full text search capabilities of MySQL in the near
future and want to explore how Boolean searches and result relevance could
be implemented. Should you need a collaborator, I would be interested in
making the NYPHP-talk searchable. I am interested in how you implemented
your test search; could I see the code for how you implemented this search?

There's a couple of things along these lines I've been kicking around, including what you mention above.  Without trying to write an AI engine, I suppose you could just search for keywords against some type of fulltext/keyword database.

My ineveitable goal is to have a phpTips database, thus the name /ptips/ in my original post.  evolt.org has something similar, but it could use some improvement.  It basically works by placing tags in your messages when you see something useful, or write something useful yourself; or a combination.  For example:

<ptip subject="removing links" keywords="links remove mysql ptips">

> does "x"ing a link out remove it from all pertaining links?

Yeah, the link won't show up, but it won't remove the whole message (ie, if a message has more than one link).

</ptip>


Something like that.  Then there'd be a full text searchable DB of all these things, which would also link back to the original message.  It wouldn't be very hard to write, and I'd be happy to do it; if people promise to use it   :)

yeah - what Hans said.

I've had plenty of success dropping PHP into javascript, ie:
<script language='javascript'>
alert('<?=$hello?>');
</script>

One possible solution, though convoluted, would be to have the frameset drop
a cookie with the _top URL and then in the subsequent frame PHP could read
from the same cookie and get the URL.  Otherwise, I often use hidden forms
on the client side and document.submit() the values back into a PHP script -
when I need info from the client-side in the server-side.

I'd love to hear other solutions...

Message-ID: <BAY2-F138ZtORDcsXPL0000c91b@hotmail.com>

Hans is right, PHP wouldn't know that it is in a frameset.  Only the client 
knows that, which is after the PHP is executed.

You can throw around the parent frame's PHP_SELF with something like this:

In the parent frameset declaration page:
-----------------------------------------
<script type="text/javascript">
var self = <?= $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] ?>;
function getSelf () {
	return self;
}
</script>
<frameset rows="50,20,*">
    <frame name="top" src="top.php" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" 
scrolling="auto" frameborder="0">
	<frame name="middle" src="middle.php" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" 
scrolling="auto" frameborder="0">
    <frame name="bottom" src="bottom.php" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" 
scrolling="auto" frameborder="0">
</frameset>
-----------------------------------------


And in the child, e.g., "top.php":
-----------------------------------------
	<script type="text/javascript">
	var par = window.parent;
	var self = par.getSelf();
	</script>
-----------------------------------------

Sure, see attached, although it's contrived, dirty and without even boolean.  pre.search.php seeds the DB from the HTML archive files, and search.php is the end-user interface.  To take this further, we'd probably want to add booleans and tune the fulltext engine a bit, although the initial test results seemed to produce some reasonable results.

Total guesses...  How about checking $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] in the
frame?  Or, put a query string onto the frameset's call to the frame, 
which you can then read in the frame.

I'm building a system that takes user purchases and turns that information
into a suggested purchases list for other users.  I know Amazon, B&N,
everyone and their dog does it.

Does anyone know of open source packages, online documentation, or howtos
that might help point me in the right direction?  I see several for
purchase products, but I am more interested in doing it myself for the
experience.

Starting from scratch, I figure I'm going to need a database that tracks
user purchases and then software to "score" those purchases for other
users.  It's the scoring portion that I'm finding a little daunting.

Anyone?  Anyone?

You might want to take a look at "Case Based Reasoning" - in which, once 
some "cases" have been stored and verified, later "cases" are compared 
against them. It's been a long time since I looked at this, but if you get 
stuck, let me know and I will try to find resources.

You might try contacting the oscommerce mailing list to see if someone 
is already working on it for their PHP-based 
catalog/shopping-cart/order-tracking solution.

Seems like a feature they'd definitely want to have.

Thanks for the suggestions everybody. It looks like passing a value (e.g.
the frameset URI) around is the only way to accomplish this, but at least I
now know I'm not overlooking anything obvious.

Thanks again.

wow Hans, I was *just* thinking of this the other day in terms of 
"task/problem" type training.  There is a wealth of info in the lists, 
even tho I've been signed up for only a short time, and I wanted to 
bring some of the issues that are brought up to include these types of 
problems in my PHP/MySQL training curriculum.

You definetely should check out OScommerce, and if you're not going to use
that check out some of the contributions on "customers who bought this also
bought" type things. Works just like amazon's shopping cart.

There was an article in Dr. Dobbs journal sometime in the Fall on
personalization that you might check out.  I believe it was called "Adaptive
Resonance Theory"... a fancy name for just what you want to do.

I've had good success with doing all of the computation in the database,
leaving nothing for PHP to do but display the results.  I use a combination of
aggregate (SUM & COUNT) functions with a CASE statement for the weighting to
give me a scoring and then order the result by that.

Message-ID: <20030807.075610.16315.1104826@webmail02.lax.untd.com>


I am trying to figure out if it is possible to force a page refresh for all users viewing a page at the same time.  I want all users to see a new page when one user submits info via a form.  I am picturing something along the lines of:

if(submit)
{
   write_to_file($POST[new info]);
   foreach($ip_addr in $ip_addr_list)
   {
     fsockopen($ip);

My question is, can I send headers to an ip address and expect the web browser to refresh even though the user at that address hasn't done anything?

you could probably get away using a hidden frame on each of the viewers
client and occasionally polling a queue on the server ... let the submit
write the text to the queue/text/db file and then let the viewers poll it
for changes and if changes are made using javascript to reload the
corresponding window ...

i did this once w/ a java applet but i think u can get away w/ a simple php
script ...

Not exactly, but you can have pages that represent states in a state machine.

1. Regular page - has a Refresh header to refresh itself every 30 seconds
2. New Page - has a Refresh header to refresh itself every 30 seconds

When you want everyone to see the new page, you change the URL in the Refresh
header in state 1 to point to state 2.

I'm sure there are better examples of a state machine, but that just came to
mind. Keep in mind that this is not completely reliable and that you're
generating a lot of unnecessary traffic (and load) on your Web server to do
something that seems very unimportant.

> I want all users to see a new page when one user submits info via a form.

Can you explain what you're trying to do? Surely there is a better path to
take.

Nope. Imagine how awful that would be. Web browsers are HTTP clients, not
servers.

Hope that helps.

The double slashes should be fine, I think.  You probably have an unnecessary
trailing / in a config file somewhere.

Have you checked the permissions on the containing directory?  Does the user
the script is running as have permission to write to it?

This is very different. You see, you don't need a new page; you just need a new
message added to the existing page.

This can be done using a chunked transfer encoding. So long as your Web server
(and your users' Web clients) does not buffer, the flush() function can be used
to output the next "chunk" to the user.

I wrote a (very poor) example of this a few years ago. This is the second time
I've mentioned it on a mailing list recently, so I'm feeling pressure to write
a simple chat-room example now. :-) Anyway, you can have a look and see if it
helps explain anything:

http://shiflett.org/tutorials/php_flush.php

Hope that helps.

The only thing I can think of using a standard web browser is to setting the
timeout to 0 (set_time_limit (0);) and using some combination of flush/sleep
functions to continuously poll and update the display frame... I have no
idea how it would behave or if it would slam your server with all the
concurrent connections, but an applet sounds like a better solution for
something like this.

[I might have messed up the first time - apologies if this is a double-post]


Tomorrow's the big day!

Here's the plan for tomorrow morning:

-- Meet at Penn Station at 6:30am to catch the 7:03 train to New Brunswick (Northeast Corridor Line)
  -- After trying to figure out a good place to meet, I'll say the corner of 7th Ave and 33rd Street (this is corner across from the huge Farley post office, right?).  It's actually shockingly difficult to find a good map: http://www.citidex.com/map/penn.html.  If I'm in the wrong here, please tell me!  


So how do we find each other?  It should be early enough in the morning that there won't be *too* many people around, but we'll try to speak loudly about computers and PHP.  And, my cell number is 646 242 4101.

If you are planning on coming, please send a quick note to rsvp at nyphp.org so we know who to wait for, etc.

See everyone tomorrow!

Well, the Post Office is between 8th and 9th, so not exactly. That's basically
the NE corner of Madison Square Garden, if I'm not mistaken.

Hmm, well so much for me picking a good meeting spot.  Yeah, NE corner is where I planned, but I could have sworn that would be 7th Avenue.

Anyway, I'm actually on my way to an area somewhat close to there, so I'll pin it down (a digital camera would certainly be handy right about now :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] providing patches for php apps ...
Message-ID: <004e01c35d10$1f6c5880$6500a8c0@THINKPAD>

greetings ...

im just curious how everyone might apply patches to php apps (for example if
u took a pretty old open php app and adjusted a few files, .php, .sql) and u
wanted to just provide the patch file, is there a common way to do this?

diff ~/dev/file.1php ~/tmp/file1.php > patch
patch < patch

is the sufficient/common?

You're right about that, just not about it being across the street from the big
Post Office building.

I've got a camera, and that's basically where I live, so I can take some
pictures if you want (or you can drop by and borrow the camera).

Well, it wouldn't cause much strain at all, since it's only having to send a
little chunk every time someone sends a message.

What it does do is tie up connections. Most people who do this consider the
Web server to be a chat server and dedicate it to that purpose (or, at least
dedicate some Web server to the purpose, perhaps listening on an alternate
port). Because the strain is very little, you can increase your maximum
number of child processes/threads/whatever a ton without increasing your load
too much (this tuning requires a bit of experience with tuning Web servers, but
trial an error is also very educational). You just need to be able to support a
connection for every user in a chat.

Hope that helps.

Jeff,

You have templates_c directory (used for caching templates) created,
right?
If not, create it in the same folder that your templates directory
exists.
This one is explained in the installation part of Smarty manual.

If you get a chance to take a picture of that corner that be great, but I don't think it should be a problem either way.  I picked this particular corner because it's fairly small and generally easy to see everyone who is standing around.

See everyone tomorrow (at 33rd and 8th at 6:30am)

Some FYI's from someone who's not going, but lives in NJ, takes NJ Transit 
and frequents New Brunswick...

Make sure you but your train tickets before getting on the train. If you 
don't you will be charged a $5 surcharge.

The Hyatt is a 2 (longish) block walk North on Albany Street from the train 
station in New Brunswick. If you get to the river, you've walked too far...

We built a dedicated chat app for a client's website once.  We used Jabber and a Java client for the front end.  It worked great.
Although they hardly ever had anyone in the chat rooms to really test the system under load.   I know this is not a PHP solution but
I don't think PHP is well suited for a real-time application like IM.

I just found out that this is legal

$minutes = array(''=>"&nbsp;","00"=>"00","30"=>"30"); //etc

Is this  -- the fact that you can get away with using an
empty string as an array key -- a bug or a feature (or neither)?

I wonder if I can count on this behavior in other PHP versions (mine is
4.3.2 on RH) In this instance it's quite helpful in solving my problem
with sticky dropdowns and the Smarty html_options function ... a problem
too boring and complicated to explain unless someone's interested.

Thanks.

I believe it is a feature. The empty string is a valid string and
differentiable from NULL. In fact, if you are creative enough, you can
name variables (or array elements) all sorts of stupid names:

${"\n"} = 'return';
$a = compact("\n");
print_r($a);

Array
(
    [
] => return
)

oh -- ~that~ Adam Maccabee Trachtenberg! <fawn>Love that Cookbook!</fawn>.
Now let me ask you (or anybody) a question about 14:11 a/k/a Encrypting
Email with GPG.

If you're an ordinary user on a shared server, what is the best strategy
for GPG-encrypting data? I have figured out (stolen) one way to do it, but
it requires wrapping the script with php-cgiwrap and doing something like

$encrypted = shell_exec( "echo 'secret stuff'|/usr/bin/gpg
--no-secmem-warning --homedir /my/.gnupg -ear recipient at example.com");


It doesn't work when run as nobody, I presume because nobody doesn't have
permission to get into my .gnupg directory. Perhaps php-cgiwrap is the
answer... ?

btw thanks to all for the discussion re my last Q.

I get this error upon opening a PHP script I wrote; however, upon refreshing my browser, the error goes away and usually does not appear again.  The page is not supposed to cache and I have caching turned off on my script:

I have no idea why this happens but I can tell you that this script /cma/index.php will go to a TCL CGI script which will go back to /cma/index.php eventually upon form completion or linkage or some user action.

Message-ID: <000d01c35e0d$c2149360$68e4a144@bronco>

Here is a descrip of what the php.ini setting for open_basedir does:
 
Limit the files that can be opened by PHP to the specified directory-tree,
including the file itself. This directive is NOT affected by whether Safe
Mode is turned On or Off. 
When a script tries to open a file with, for example, fopen() or gzopen(),
the location of the file is checked. When the file is outside the specified
directory-tree, PHP will refuse to open it. All symbolic links are resolved,
so it's not possible to avoid this restriction with a symlink. 
The special value . indicates that the directory in which the script is

Hi,
Could somebody tell me where I can ask this question and get some answers?

I have inherited a small Javascript app that stores pagination 
(next/previous pagination) data via cookies.  The parent window sets 2 
cookies and then opens another window.  The child window is supposed to 
read the cookies to get the default pagination.

//Parent page snippet

var newWindow = '';

newWindow.open("newPage.html");
newWindow.focus();

newWindow.opener = self;
newWindow.document.cookies = "start=ss";
newWindow.document.cookies = "end=ss";

//----------------------------

//Child page snippet:

var ck = document.cookie;

var pos = ck.indexOf("start=");

// etc.


The strange thing is that this works in IE6, but not in NS7.
When I check NS7 and check the cookies in the preferences, the start and 
end cookies are there.

The length of document.cookies is much shorter in NS7 than in IE6.  When 
I print what is in document.cookies, IE6 shows me the 2 cookies, while 
NS7 does not.

How do I make these cookies work in IE5, IE6, NS6, and NS7?

Thank you,
Stephen

It looks like we can't override safe_mode with ini_set(). Maybe you can
run php in CGI mode and use your own config file?

Maybe someone else can give you a better idea -- just thought I'd give it
a shot.

A few months ago, I created a php based socket server app (based in part
on http://www.php-tools.de/site.php socket server class).  For the front
end, I used flash via xml_sockets.  Now in order to add IM-ability to
the chat app, I basically set allow the user to click on a user who is
logged on which will send an "IM" command to the server via the socket,
which in turn sends it to that user via their socket connection.  Then
Using javascript from Flash it open up a new browser window with a new
room with the two members in it for both clients.

Most everything is held in php arrays and the class is continually open
on the server (with a while (1) { // socket commands }).  The only issue
I had was that my hosts's server wouldn't allow the app to run
constantly, so the socket connections would close after 20 minutes.  Now
that they just gave me my own server, I may be able to keep it running
at all times.

I've also done something similar with perl before that, which worked
well, but I've never liked maintaining perl because I'm not strong
enough with it.

I've found that the traffic and processees involved are incredibly
minimal, but it's only been for a group of 30 of us at a time.  The app
also adds all messages to a mysql database for archiving, and besides
the time limit which I'll be working around now, I've had no problems.

Good luck!

Mark

We built a dedicated chat app for a client's website once.  We used
Jabber and a Java client for the front end.  It worked great.
Although they hardly ever had anyone in the chat rooms to really test
the system under load.   I know this is not a PHP solution but
I don't think PHP is well suited for a real-time application like IM.

Well, it wouldn't cause much strain at all, since it's only having to
send a little chunk every time someone sends a message.

What it does do is tie up connections. Most people who do this consider
the Web server to be a chat server and dedicate it to that purpose (or,
at least dedicate some Web server to the purpose, perhaps listening on
an alternate port). Because the strain is very little, you can increase
your maximum number of child processes/threads/whatever a ton without
increasing your load too much (this tuning requires a bit of experience
with tuning Web servers, but trial an error is also very educational).
You just need to be able to support a connection for every user in a
chat.

Hope that helps.

Chris

gpg has to run as a user that has access to your secret key ring.

Doing gpg encryption with a passphrase-protected key on a shared server has
many risks: can anyone else on the server (through misadministration or a
hole in pages on your site) alter any of your cgi-wrapped scripts and do
their own encryption/decryption/steal your key? Separately, putting your
passphrase in a file readable by other users is no better than just having a
passphraseless key.

What are you trying to encrypt?

Last question first: credit card information, which will then be emailed
and/or written to a database.

As for the first question, well... maybe I'm confused. When I run the
snippet


$encrypted = shell_exec( "echo 'secret stuff'|/usr/bin/gpg
--no-secmem-warning --homedir /my/.gnupg -ear recipient at example.com");

from the command line or as a wrapped script, it does not require a
passphrase in order to encrypt. Since gpg needs the user's secret key in
order to encrypt and sign, a copy of that secret key has to live on the
server -- is there any way around that? The permissions are as restrictive
as possible and I guess the key is as safe/vulnerable as anything else in
the house that's similarly chmoded.

The private key for decrypting is not going to be anywhere near the
server, nor will my secret key passphrase.

So how, if at all, does one safely gpg-encrypt on a shared server?

Thanks,

There's no solution.  open_basedir is a preventive security measure, and was set for a reason.  You'll need to talk to the sysadmin to get something worked out.

I'll throw this function out there as an example:

   function __sortOn( $metadata,$sort_flags,$reverse = FALSE ) {

      if( !isset($this->Listing[0][$metadata]) )
         return FALSE;

      $metakeys = array();
      foreach( $this->Listing as $key => $sorton )
         $metakeys[$key] = $sorton[$metadata];

      if( $reverse )
         arsort($metakeys,$sort_flags);
      else
         asort($metakeys,$sort_flags);

      $tmp = array();
      foreach( $metakeys as $key => $metakey )
         $tmp[] = $this->Listing[$key];

      $this->Listing = $tmp;

      return TRUE;
   }

I have no idea why, but I'd consider rethinking your data structures a bit  :)

Hundreds... or more.

Negative.  There's even a module to make working with large numbers of vhosts easier:

Oh yeah I got it BTW, at 4:00am

And rethinking my data structures is never an option; I'll just make it even
more complicated by doing so!  In fact, PHP is the saving grace behind the
idea of sorting data that is parsed from an XML file into a TCL
1-dimensional list.  Otherwise, it would never be done at all.

I have this data that consists of feedback information, when users enter
feedback from my site.  The feedback XML row will consist of:

firstname
lastname
email
url
categoryID (feedback category ID maps to feedbackCategories.xml which has
like 1 => "trivia" or 2 => "articles"...)
timeStamp
showEntry (a boolean switch to "delete" this entry upon choice)

I use TCL to parse the XML file (long story, trust me) and it converts it to
a 1-dimensional list.  However, I would need to sort this one-dimensional
list as follows:

1) sort first by ascending category_id
2) sort each separated category_id by descending timestamp order

So, long in short, this is what I came up with:

// FUNCTION TO BE USED IN uksort() TO RETURN A REVERSE-CASE-INSENSITIVE
BOOLEAN FOR REVERSE SORTING
  function strrevcasecmp($a, $b) {
   if (strcasecmp($a, $b) == 0) return 0;
   return (strcasecmp($a, $b) > 0) ? -1 : 1;
  }

...// reparse the original feedback.xml file instead of using the TCL list
(the TCL script will have updated the existing XML file if need be prior to
calling this PHP script)

// SORT THE OUTER ARRAY FIRST IN CATEGORY_ID ASC AND THEN EACH INNER ARRAY
BY TIME DESC
   // BE SURE TO SUPPRESS WARNINGS IF NO DATA IS FOUND IN fbArray
   @ksort($fbArray);
   if (sizeof($fbArray) > 0) {
    foreach ($fbArray as $key => $val) {
     @uksort($val, "strrevcasecmp");
     $fbArray[$key] = $val;
    }
   }

And there you have it, an overcomplicated solution, once again, possibly an
extremely simpler solution out there that I simply can't fathom. :(

Probably, although unified diffs are typically a little better because it'll provide some context.  Nothing that I'm aware would be any different from C source to PHP source, etc.  I'm always a fan of FreeBSD docs:

I'm pretty shocked, honestly, how well the html editor worked (tested in Mozilla).  Maybe we can get an installation at dev.  :)

I think you're on the right track.  Encrypting data for a designated user 
doesn't require a password.  Here's something I in a PHP shell script on 
my office computer to encrypt backups:

   exec('c:/progra~1/gnupg/gpg.exe -e -r usr at addr.com file.');

Such procedures use the public key ring, right?  As long as you set the
file permissions so only you can write to it... and you know how to
compose secure web applications -- meaning in this case scripts that don't
allow user input to pick the name of the files they're going to write to,
then everything is fine.

In regards to your last question, I don't believe the secret keyring has
to exist on the server.  So, if you want to tighten things up further, you
can make a separate public key file just for this purpose, chmod it to 444
and then use a flag in your gpg call (--keyring, I believe) to use that
special keyring.

Enjoy,

This is what I've been using for a while. It's probably dirty and unorthodox
but since I am the only user on the system, I'm not that worried about other
users snooping on the /tmp dir.

Feel free to clean this up, anyone...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] libxml in PHP 5
Message-ID: <20030811174918.GB5141@panix.com>

Hey Folks:

I'm starting to use PHP 5 on my development machine.  The primary XML
parser is changing from expat to libxml.  I was curious about the change,
so sought documentation of the new libxml stuff on the PHP site but
haven't been able to find any.

I know there are folks on this list involved with PHP 5's development.  
Perhaps someone can steer me toward such documentation and/or answer a
question.

I was thinking that the new XML parser would necessitate scripts use
different function calls.  Or will the main functions and behavior remain
the same, but only the library be changed?

If the functions will indeed be different, is there some place to find
docs about these new procedures?  They don't have to be great, just give
me an idea of how to start hacking something simple.

Thanks,

--Dan

To encrypt only, yes, you just need the public key of the recipient. To
encrypt and sign, you need the private key of the signer as well.

So if you're just encrypting the credit card data with a public key and
storing it in a place where the corresponding private key isn't, then you
should be protected against someone retrieving the encrypted data and then
decrypting it.

You aren't protected against someone injecting false data that's correctly
encrypted into the system (via a hole in your app). This may not be such a
big concern.

I have an apparently valid regular expression,
^.*<title>([^<]*)</title>.*$
that works well in one site, but causes the server hosting a different site
to grind its teeth to nubs on it - consistently exceeding max ex time...

the full line goes like this:
    $text_a_title =
eregi_replace("^.*<title>([^<]+)</title>.*$","\\1",$str);

if i bypass this line, everything else works swimmingly...


any suggestions?
(taking a title from an html file)


TIA

If you just want the title out of the document, try this:

if (preg_match('@<title>(.*?)</title>@i',$str, $matches)) {
    $title = $matches[1];
} else {
    print "There's no title";

That works nicely.

Any thoughts on what would make previous regex so nasty?

A few things make this nasty:

^.*<title>([^<]*)</title>.*$

With the anchors and the leading and trailing .*'s, you are matching against
the entire document. Plus, since * is greedy by default, the initial .* (I
think) has to match the entire document, then backtrack to the last <title>
tag in the doc. Then, the trailing .* has to do some matching after the
</title> tag is found, matching that doesn't affect what gets captured at
all.

If the box is well ventilated as a whole, probably not.  But, if the system was running hot to begin with, the upgrade may put it over the top.  That said, it's probably fine to let it ride with the current heat sink and fan, but just keep an eye on it.

Message-ID: <000c01c360d5$66f3f370$6501a8c0@EZDSDELL>

I have a specific subdirectory on my site where users can upload images
files associated with some text stored in a database. The question
concerns deleting those uploaded images. Deleting the record is the easy
part...even deleting the images and subdirectory is easy. However, my
concern is what precautions should I take to make sure that the wrong
subdir (or the whole site!!) doesn't get blown away. In the code below
I'm using file_exists to delete the images and subdir but is there
anything else that I should do to bullet proof the procedure? 

//Note: $sSubDir is the subdirectory path stored in the corresponding
MySQL record.

//Delete images
for($i=0;$i<5;$i++){
		$sImageName = $sSubDir . "image$i.jpg";
		if(file_exists($sImageName)){		
			unlink($sImageName);
		}	
	}
//Delete subdir

Where is $sSubDir set? If it's set by users, then before either call to
rmdir() you should canonicalize the pathname with realpath() and then make
sure that the canonicalized pathname has the correct prefix.

For example:

// The directory under which image-storage subdirectories can be created
$sImagePrefix = '/www/some/place/images';

$sSubDir = realpath($sSubDir);
if ($sSubDir && ($sImagePrefix == dirname($sImageName)) {
  for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    $sImageName = $sSubDir . "image$i.jpg";
    if (file_exists($sImageName)) { unlink($sImageName); }
  }
  unlink($sSubDir);
}

realpath() returns false if the canonicalized pathname doesn't exist.

It was not running hot to begin with, but the heatsink is very hot now. I
have the case of with an outside fan blowing on it in addition to the fan

is_dir()/is_file() is good for this, since it'll check the inode type and ensure a real path (which may, however, be relative to the current working dir).

for( $i = 0; $i < 5; ++$i ) {
   $sImageName = "{$sSubDir}image{$i}.jpg";
   if( is_file($sImageName) )
      unlink($sImageName);
}

if( is_dir($sSubDir) )
   rmdir($sSubDir);

Hans,

See my comment to David Sklar. I think this handles the
issue...especially since I'm not using relative dirs.

Just to expand a bit, I use a constant for the full path:

define('DEST_PATH','/var/www/html/car_images/') and then create $sSubDir
by concatenating this path with the value in the table which is simply
the subdirectory name, such as "b67783a0ceadaa20bdc17a513d113a42"

Where is $sSubDir set? If it's set by users, then before either call to
rmdir() you should canonicalize the pathname with realpath() and then
make
sure that the canonicalized pathname has the correct prefix.

For example:

// The directory under which image-storage subdirectories can be created
$sImagePrefix = '/www/some/place/images';

$sSubDir = realpath($sSubDir);
if ($sSubDir && ($sImagePrefix == dirname($sImageName)) {
  for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    $sImageName = $sSubDir . "image$i.jpg";
    if (file_exists($sImageName)) { unlink($sImageName); }
  }
  unlink($sSubDir);
}

realpath() returns false if the canonicalized pathname doesn't exist.

The subdirectory name should, theoretically, take care of uniqueness.
Here's how I generate the subdir name when someone is uploading pics for
the very first time:

$sTime = microtime();
$iDir = md5($sTime); 

At no time does the user touch the subdir name (that is...it is not
editable). It is generated automatically and stored in the database. The
only time it is visible, however, is on the "public" side of the site
when someone views the images and looks at the html source.

Good.

So, when you're allowing users to delete directories, what is the input
they're providing?  The name of a subdirectory of under the hash named
dir, which is itself a subdirectory of your graphics directory?  If so, 
great.  Then, as mentioned before, all you need to do is check the user 
input contains only letters and numbers.

Enjoy,

Dan,

The subdirectory only gets deleted when a user clicks on the "Delete"
link. The code handles the rest. At no time does the user know the name
of the image subdirectory. All they know is that they are deleting a
record. And as an added safety precaution, though I'm using $_GET to
pass values around (like record ID numbers), the url says something like
"http://mydomain.com/mypage.php?code=YToxOntzOjU6IkRMX0lEIjtzOjM6IjEzNCI
7fQ== with the latter being base 64 encoded and serialized.

Apparantly this entails accessing MSSQL datacube, which I do not have much of a clue, but I was wondering if anyone has ever done anything with MDX using PHP.   

Can you point me to the write place to read info on PHP and MDX?

A guy at work took a class and now they are convince that we should do this using ASP...OH NO!!!!!!  The teacher an MS cronie said that PHP would have problems using MDX.

Thanks,

The plan is to make the libxml switch seamless and not require any

PHP 5 will also have the SimpleXML extension. I believe the C code in
the CVS is also the documentation. (Source code: The ultimate documentation.)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Localizing Time Zones
Message-ID: <BAY2-F153WOo4SViZ8h0001ec11@hotmail.com>

We've been looking for a good way to customize a web-based work flow tool so 
that each user who logs in sees the time stamp of events in his own time 
zone, not that of the server.

For example, a developer in India who is given a task can see when it was 
assigned by the project manager in New York displayed in Bangalore time.  
Similarly the PM would see when the work was done relative to New York time. 
  Both users would see GMT as a frame of reference as well.

To implement this functionality, we've taken a look at Adam and David's PHP 
Cookbook where they address this very problem (Chapter 3, Calculating Time 
with Time Zones).

Their solution involves the temporary change of the TZ environment variable:

   "Calling putenv( ) before mktime( ) fools the system functions mktime( )
   uses into thinking they're in a different time zone. After the call to 
mktime( ),
   the correct time zone has to be restored."

   function pc_mktime($tz,$hr,$min,$sec,$mon,$day,$yr) {
       putenv("TZ=$tz");
       $a = mktime($hr,$min,$sec,$mon,$day,$yr);
       putenv('TZ=EST5EDT');   // change EST5EDT to your server's time zone!
       return $a;
   }

This seems to be the solution we're after, but we're concerned about whether 
this is thread safe, particularly in the context of a heavy load server with 
lots of users redefining the TZ environment variable simultaneously.

The documentation of putenv() says the the environment variable will revert 
to its original value after the request, and we understand that explicitly 
resetting it as in the function above will offer a little better protection, 
but should we still worry that one user's putenv will clash with another's?  
If so, what is a better solution to time zone localization?

Thanks in advance,
-Dan

My (Linux 2.4.20) "man putenv" says, in part:

      The  putenv()  function is not required to be reentrant, and the one
in
      libc4, libc5 and glibc2.0 is not, but the glibc2.1 version is.

(PHP's putenv() function calls the underlying putenv() system call.)

What OS and web server are you using?

I take a slightly different approach than what you mention. I can't say that
I've ever given it a lot of thought, but this is what I do. I begin with some
default variables for the application:

$date_format = 'D, d M Y H:i:s';
$gmt_offset = -4;

If the user logs in, these values are overwritten with the user's session, so
you can let your users choose their preferred date format and time zone.

Then I just do something like this to get a ready-to-display date into a
variable:

$curr_date = gmdate($date_format, time() + $gmt_offset * 3600);

Of course, this demonstrates a date relative to the current time, but this can
be applied to any timestamp.

Hope that helps.

Chris

This would work, but also remember that UNIX timestamps aren't timezone aware themselves.  Timezones only come into effect when you convert from the timestamp to a human readable date and time.

http://www.gnu.org/manual/glibc-2.2.5/html_node/Simple-Calendar-Time.html#Simple%20Calendar%20Time

in which case:

http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php
http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.setlocale.php

might come in handy at some point.

Anywho, do you really mean thread-safe?  Unless you're running PHP under a threaded MPM in Apache 2, or IIS or something else, you won't need to worry about threads.  Each Apache child is a full process, and thus has it's own environment (ie, it's own instance of the TZ environment variable) so you should be fine.

In this configuration, each apache child is a single-threaded process, so
you shouldn't have any threads-stepping-on-each-other problems. A given
child process (with its own environment) only handles one request at a time.

This works great most of the time, but it gets tripped up by Daylight Saving
Time because some users' GMT offsets change during DST. If you keep track of
the DST observance of a user, then you can adjust the GMT offset when
necessary. However, that "when necessary" can be tricky to figure out. If
you're just handling North American users, then you can switch users DST
status around the time when the server's DST status switches.

To be accurate around the time that DST status switches, however, you need
to adjust the user's DST status switch by the offset between the user's time
zone and the server's time zone. DST switches happen at a given hour in
local time, so at 2am PST, when things jump to 3am PDT (except, for example,
in Dawson Creek, BC, which doesn't observe DST) it's 6am EDT, because the
jump from 2am EST to 3am EDT happened three hours earlier, at 2am EST, which
is 11pm PST.

Other places in the world may switch between standard and summer time at
different times of the year. Some countries occasionally adjust their time
settings to make the Olympics run more smoothly. (see:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;257178).

The zoneinfo database knows about all these hinky time zone and DST issues,
which is what makes putenv() and strftime() a breeze. If you don't want to
use environment variables, though, I suppose you could store a zoneinfo zone
for a given user and then calculate the GMT offset for that user by parsing
the appropriate zoneinfo file and finding the DST setting and GMT offsets
that correspond to a particular UTC time. zdump(8) and tzfile(5) would be
helpful for that.

Message-ID: <E19mfzV-0008In-LW@rslrs1-server.com>


Sorry for the off-topic post, but this list is so full of knowledgeable
people, I couldn't resist...

pardon me while I first wipe off my nose ;)


I am have a "debate" with an external webmaster about the number of
click-thrus a banner on his site is generating to one of my sites.

He says his logs show over 5,000 click-thrus for a particular month.

My logs show a total of 20 references from his site (yes, I know, not
all browsers send the HTTP_REFERER).

The links on his site are nothing special. No link to a redirecting
script that may increment a counter or anything like that. Just plain
ol' http://www.foo.com (actually, it's a nasty double link, the href
points to an advertiser's site, and an onClick spawns a new window to my
site, but still nothing that I see that might register in his logs).

My suspicion is that his logs are displaying the number of times the
banner image was loaded, not the click-thru count. -OR- He also
mentioned the "Exit" pages statistic and is suggesting that every exit
page was a click-thru to my site.

In the case of the exit pages, I don't think he understands what an
"exit page" really is.

My question, at long last, Is there anything that would show in his logs
that a user clicked the banner to an external link?


Thanks much

Hi All,

Executive summary:
I'm wondering if anyone here has any recommendations for a solution to
creating database related code.

Background:
I'm currently writing some code for a project and I realize that %80 of my
time is spent on database related code.
This is bad. At the end of the day, manipulation of data in a database is
the same more or less for any project. It comes down to "CRUD" (Creation,
Reading, Updating, Deleting). There must be a better way.

I'm looking for something that will reduce my development time on database
related code.
I know there are several packages, classes, etc that will help with this,
but I don't have time to research all the possibilities and was hoping to
hear from nyphp members their experiences and recommendations (or
non-recommendations).
I'm looking for any solution, commercial or open source.

I looked into phplens which seems to be in the direction of what I'm looking
for.
We're already using smarty so that's an added plus.

Thanx
Ophir

Only if the click sends the browser to a redirection script on his site, 
or at the ad server site (which sends him logs).
There could also be some kind of javascript onclick event that tracks it.

But I think your hunch is right-- if you've only got 20 instances of an 
HTTP_REFERER from his site in your logs, there's probably only been 20 
clicks, and certainly not 5000.

I'm sure there are some great classes out there for this, but if you've 
already written the code so many times, why not write your own class or 
functions that duplicate what you already do? Even if you are still 
writing out the SQL for each query, you can consolidate a lot of the 
code around it and save an awful lot of time.

Thanks.

I'd love to see a snippet showing how user nobody encrypts data without
signing or requiring any secret key. That seems to be where I'm stuck. GPG
needs access to the public keyring containing the recipients public key,
right? If that's under my home directory then I have to open up the
permissions on it so 'nobody' can get in there, no?

To sign without encrypting, pass -e without -s to gpg: "gpg -er foo at bar.com"
encrypts for foo at bar.com (and requires only foo at bar.com's public key);
"gpg -ser foo at bar.com" encrypts for foo at bar.com and also signs with the
default local user (and requires that user's private key).

GPG does need access to the public keyring with the recipient's public key.
Since it's a public keyring, it doesn't really matter if the world can see
it. Put the keys in a separate keyring, make that file world-readable
(perhaps putting it outside your home directory), and tell gpg about it
with --keyring.

Thanks for all the tips.  I think the fact that the Apache child process

Hi there.

I've got a script that's calling another PHP script which creates a 
TAR archive of some files, then it copies it somewhere, and extracts 
it.

Simple enough.

The thing is, the TAR archive is around 178 MB, so it's kinda on the big side.

So, I have a simple question.

Currently, I am building the command to tar the files, and calling it 
like this:

$cmd = "php -q /some/other/directory/maketar,php &";
if( system($cmd) === false){
  die( "was not able to call the TAR building script");
}
else{
  // do other stuff, like copy it and extract it
}

So, my question is...is the above if then construct sufficient to 
make the calling script wait for the PHP script it is making use of 
before it goes on and attempts to copy the created file.

I'm asking this because, to me, it doesn't seem to be, and I want to 
figure out the "proper" way I can make the script wait for the 
completion of the other script.

Try removing the ampersand, &, in your $cmd string.

Yes, and kinda.  The SAX extension (ext/xml) will remain the same.

Code that uses the DOM extension will need to be rewritten.  The DOM
extension has always been experimental, and never really worked.  Now it
will, and it will be 100% DOM 2 (and mostly DOM 3) compliant.  The API
for the XSLT extension is also completely changed.

Yep, that's it.  SimpleXML is actually quite powerful.  For example, I
wrote a full WSDL parser using simplexml.  It supports Xpath, Schema and
the full XML infoset.

Hey Ophir,

One thing I've found that dramatically helps me deal with database 
issues is a good database design tool to help me visualize what's going 
on.  I found something recently that I really like, CaseStudio:

http://www.casestudio.com

After a couple of hours learning the demo Lite version, I bought it. 
The Pro version has a reverse engineering feature that logs into an 
RDBMS and creates a model from an existing database.  I demoed this as 
well and found a couple of things I should have been doing to optimize 
my digest archive.  Supports MySQL 4 and PosgreSQL 7.x too.

Looks sleek...  ...but regarding any documentation (full list of functions,
say) for the updated DOM, XSLT and XPATH functionality? 

And if I remember right... SAX, XSLT and DOM XML libs will all be installed
by default on both *nix and Windows?

I have been using DOMXML functions at this time and several web hosts would
not install the library, namely because it is marked as Experimental.

Yep, that's it.  SimpleXML is actually quite powerful.  For example, I wrote
a full WSDL parser using simplexml.  It supports Xpath, Schema and the full
XML infoset.

Hey Ophir,

One thing I've found that dramatically helps me deal with database 
issues is a good database design tool to help me visualize what's going 
on.  I found something recently that I really like, CaseStudio:

http://www.casestudio.com

After a couple of hours learning the demo Lite version, I bought it. 
The Pro version has a reverse engineering feature that logs into an 
RDBMS and creates a model from an existing database.  I demoed this as 
well and found a couple of things I should have been doing to optimize 
my digest archive.  Supports MySQL 4 and PosgreSQL 7.x too.

Okay. Yeah, the other response was just good  talk. 

But, here is response to your topic.

A php class that does every kind of db access (select, update, etc) (on
every db type: mysql, postgres, oracle) and has it all knocked down to a
couple of terse functions. Lots of documentation too:

These operations are handled by simple queries.  There's no way around 
programming that... until artificial intelligence, I guess.

If you want a class that simplifies connecting to, querying and displaying 
resulting output, I have one.  Maybe it'll help.

Alternatively, I found the EZSQL product I mentioned in my previous note to
be a bit "biggie-sized" for a quick job. So, I might suggest this from the
great people at Wrox.

In the book "Professional PHP 4", Chap 17, they build a q quickie class for
PHP to MySQL only. Then give you lots of sample PHP code to execute it with.
You can get the sample code for the entire book from their site Or you can
go to: http://www.pswebcode.com/downloads/ where the only the database class
and all the sample PHP files are zipped.

Message-ID: <025601c361bb$027f1f50$67a76244@philofsoa>

I am not sure if I have this correct, but if someone were to want registration verification handled through either a check or via PayPal, would that then mean I could still have it set up to send PayPal-related info to PayPal and then redirect to a "Thank for registering and giving us your money" page?

Is it just that simple or am I missing another layer here?  

"We are close.  Only difference is that they can not register themselves.  People will pay me via paypal or check and then I will register them for them.  They then log in and have access to the password protected pages."

Just want to be sure I have the right concept.  Here is a page I developed that does something similar to that:

I checked our your class and the ezsql class as well.
These are great classes and definitely big helpers but I already have code
that takes care of much of this "low level plumbing".

phplens gives you a web based interface that actually creates the php
necessary for the forms themselves.
It looks like I'll need to play around with it myself and I'll post a
mini-review.

I am unable to determine which version of mySQL is running on a remote server (and the client doesn't know either, and I can't reach the host.. oh what I'll do for $80)...

create table if not exists fs_usermetadata (
 fs_userid int not null,
 primary key(fs_userid),
 fs_username varchar(255) not null,
 fs_password varchar(255) not null,
 fs_user_category_id int not null,

Can any of you determine why the fs_record_entered column call continually produces a SQL error? I am trying to set it to default to now() and it fails every time. Augh!

from what i recall you only need to pass in NULL @ insert time to get the NOW() value ... have you tried that on the server?

Message-ID: <20030813233004.780.qmail@web14712.mail.yahoo.com>

I am planning an e-commerce site, to be developed either in PHP or Java (preferably the former), but I haven't made my final decision yet.  One of the key issues is the ability to scale the site onto a cluster of servers, as traffic grows.  
 
In Java, it seems that commercial application servers can handle this out of the box.  But I don't see how this can be done on PHP, and I'm wondering if anyone actually does this in a critical production environment.
 
How would you set up load balancing and failover on a PHP site? Is there any particular way you would design the application up front to make this easier?  I'm interesting in hearing your suggestions.

Can you use a query like 'select version()'  

 

On the datetime type - can you use a timestamp which would automatically be

Thanks for the link to the updated Yahoo/PHP presentation.  
 
What the presentation doesn't say is how difficult it was for them to get where they are.  How much effort, time and money was spent?  It's possible he had a team of programmers working all year writing custom code, experimenting, and optimizing PHP for the Yahoo environment.  
 
Just because PHP scales for Yahoo, one of the largest web companies with loads of in-house technical talent, doesn't mean it's necessarily easy or cost effective for other businesses.  
 
I'd like to hear other opinions on this.

wouldn't that really apply to *any* technology you decide to deploy?  + J2EE is not cost effective, app servers come @ a pretty cost in terms of scalability (ie WebLogic, WebSphere, etc).  From what I have *heard*, much can be said in regards to LAMP + things like mod_backhand (http://www.backhand.org/mod_backhand/) that can take you a long way ... (wishing i would have done it instead of being sucked into WebLogic/Oracle during my heyday).  i too am interested in hearing other deployment experiences.

I tried, that failed too:

select version() LIMIT 0, 30

MySQL said: 


You have an error in your SQL syntax near 'LIMIT 0, 30' at line 1

Back 

I didn't put "LIMIT 0, 30" in my query, that was somehow embedded

    I am unable to determine which version of mySQL is running on a remote server (and the client doesn't know either, and I can't reach the host.. oh what I'll do for $80)...

    create table if not exists fs_usermetadata (
     fs_userid int not null,
     primary key(fs_userid),
     fs_username varchar(255) not null,
     fs_password varchar(255) not null,
     fs_user_category_id int not null,
     fs_user_firstname varchar(255),
     fs_user_lastname varchar(255),
     fs_user_address1 varchar(255),
     fs_user_address2 varchar(50),
     fs_user_city varchar(255),
     fs_user_state_province varchar(3),
     fs_user_zip_postal varchar(20),
     fs_user_country varchar(3),
     fs_user_homephone varchar(50),
     fs_user_workphone varchar(50),
     fs_user_fax varchar(50),
     fs_user_isHome varchar(1) not null,
     fs_user_ip varchar(15),
     fs_record_entered datetime default NOW(),
     fs_payment_method varchar(10) not null
    );

    Can any of you determine why the fs_record_entered column call continually produces a SQL error? I am trying to set it to default to now() and it fails every time. Augh!

    Thanx

I'm no expert on massive deployments, but from what I understand, the load
balancing has to do with routers and other traffic management
software/hardware.  The scripting language on each server operates
independently, processing the requests that have been directed to it's
server.

It's not always the case that load balancing is independent of the scripting language.  Here's a specific example of something that's automatic in Java, but needs to be programmed into the application in PHP: 
 
In a load balanced setting, a user can be switched from one server to another as they use the site.  So the session needs to be available to all servers, and stored in the database.  Java application servers such as JBoss or Weblogic can take care of this automatically, making the session available to all servers without you having to do anything special.  But in PHP, we have to know in advance that this is a problem, so we can set up the session to work this way.
 
Another issue is deploying or upgrading the application on multiple servers, especially if several versions need to be kept around.  I can zip a Java application into a WAR file and send it to all the servers at once, and the configuration and security settings live nicely in a separate web.xml file.  The WAR file can even contain all the automated tasks that would be done by cron jobs.  But in PHP, you need to keep track of all the individual little files in the app, track changes to php.ini files and httpd.conf files, include files, include paths, .htaccess files, PEAR libraries, and cron jobs, all of which can get out of sync and mixed up very easily.  
 
Neither of these is a big deal in itself, but I'm wondering what other red flags there would be to make PHP work in a load balanced setting, so I can get an idea of the relative cost and effort versus Java.  If there are a lot of tricky little things like this, they can add up to a big job.  I'd like to do it in PHP if at all possible.

I heard that your company is one of the largest users of PHP.  It's good to know you have able to make this work.  I would like to use PHP for our site if it's possible to scale as easily as you described.
 
Is there anything special in the programming of the application that needs to be done to make it amenable to clustering, aside from keeping session state in the database?

I agree that Weblogic and Oracle are not cost effective.  What was your experience with Weblogic/Oracle like?

wouldn't that really apply to *any* technology you decide to deploy?  + J2EE is not cost effective, app servers come @ a pretty cost in terms of scalability (ie WebLogic, WebSphere, etc).  From what I have *heard*, much can be said in regards to LAMP + things like mod_backhand (http://www.backhand.org/mod_backhand/) that can take you a long way ... (wishing i would have done it instead of being sucked into WebLogic/Oracle during my heyday).  i too am interested in hearing other deployment experiences.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20030813222552.00b64008@mail.optonline.net>

A client has asked to use his website as a convenient access point for him 
and a partner to use for transferring very large (presumably too large for 
email) and sensitive (financial) files.

I am thinking that this can be done reasonably safely and very simply via 
ftp as follows:
1.  use the host's ftp password system to secure the connection, and use 
any common ftp program
2.  encrypt the file locally before uploading
3.  upload it, for convenience to a designated subdirectory but I can't see 
that it really matters
4.  then the other guy gets it, decrypts it, changes it, and puts it back, etc.
If anybody were somehow able to deduce the existence of this file and get 
it (which I know is easy; just point a browser at it and if it's not a 
standard type it will be downloaded), it would be incomprehensible.

An alternative would be to write a script using authentication which then 
uses fputs and fgets to move the file back and forth (but I may be 
*seriously* screwed up on this).  There would probably be some issue with 
write permissions on the host.

The first scheme seems much simpler and, as I said, reasonably safe.

Ideas, advice, warnings?

Use sftp, which forms an ssh connection, so the passwords and files don't 
go through in the clear.

All of the web servers I've been involved with have a user's home dir and 
the user's dir in the web document root.  Keep the stuff in the user dirs, 
not the web dirs.  This way they won't even be accessible via the web.

I would recommend Groove (If they use Windows desktops) - http://www.groove.net/ (free for limited use)
It is P2P so file size and firewalls are not an issue, it works offline and it was built with security in mind from the very

Hmmm.  Let me answer that with a "not especially".

>From an operations standpoint, you want to build to (at least semi-) automated standards.  By that I mean simply making sure that each machine is essentially a cookie-cutter replica of the next, which is fairly easy to accomplish on a large scale with a little thought.  It's worth noting that Apache/PHP has no built-in connection pooling, so if you have 10 webservers w/ 100 apache children each, you'll have 1000 connections open to your database.  You should also have a way to distribute content across multiple servers.  rsync works pretty nicely, to a point.

On the app side, as you noted, you have to keep any state in the db, and have to make sure no "webapp" server keeps any session data locally.  This is easy for a lot of people to forget in practice even if they recognize it in theory.  Generally, though, anything else is basically just following good programming habits - designing apps and database schemas so they minimize contention, so that they do as much caching as possible (most data doesn't need to be up-to-the-second dynamic; one of my favorite easy to recognize examples of this was from a company I worked at that used an SSI exec to run the unix command "date" on every page load just to print the date - not even time.  That's data that updates every 24 hours, so running it a few times a second was obviously stupid.), etc.  It's worth bearing in mind that a little extra planning time in the beginning can often make a huge difference in the end results.

Split apps up logically whenever possible.  Scaling is generally cheapest when done horizontally.  If your site(s) can be broken down into logical pieces, each with their own DB and web cluster, that'll help a bunch, since your DB will probably be your bottleneck.  The less you can hit the DB, obviously, the better.  Use separate clusters for purely static content - and consider using something like tux or thttpd or some other high-speed server to serve that content.  No sense in wasting open DB connections to serve that content.

Something you should think about early and address quickly (regardless of which platform) is shared uploaded content, if there will be any - for instance, if users can upload images, or documents, or music, or whatever, you need a way of mounting that upload repository to all of the servers.  The easiest way is just NFS mounting the fileserver across all of the clusters.

Oh, and use something like APC on your php servers.  ( http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?package=APC )  (How shameless can a plug be if it's open source?  ;)  )

I know nothing I said is especially specific, but it's late, I'm tired, and I'm not getting paid.  ;)

Nicholas

P.S.  I'm catching a plane in a few hours so I probably won't be sending any more replies for a while.  ;)

Actually, we don't maintain session state in the db.  We maintain very 
little session state other than the fact that the user has logged in and 
is known to the system.  This is carried from request to request in the 
user's encrypted cookie.  To further reduce database overhead, at login 
we load the cookie with most of the personal data the software wants to 
know about you so we don't have to hit the db for stuff like, "Hello, 
Lee".  One of the nice things about the clustering topography that 
Nicholas mentioned is that you can, if need be, maintain cookies 
specific to each named cluster.

As Nicholas said (and he's The Man when it comes to CCI's hardware 
infrastructure), in large scale applications the database is your choke 
point.  Anything you can do to reduce those requests in an environment 
where you might have tens of thousands of concurrent users is a definite 
win -- like for instance populating form pulldown data from web server 
cache rather than from the db.  You can always throw another inexpensive 
commodity web server, or ten, into the network but adding databases is 
more problematic.

pretty terrible ... 

granted it was a complex web app involving nuance and speechobjects it still was not a good thing to see java APIs floating around in limbo @ the time and when you need to hire additional oracle DBAs u go over budget quick (not saying that they are not worth it) but it would have helped to simplify to begin with.  alot of our load balancing was hardware based w/ cisco mnlb @ colo ... which i did not handle (+ by the looks of it very mindboggling process) ... my big *MAIN* issue was how licencing schemes/scams/whatever u want to call it works for multiprocessor systems when it came to app servers.  unfortunately i no longer possess the arch layout or else id gladly pass it along, probably makes a good "what not to do" poster.

a good method is to first secure apache allowing *only* viewing of .pgp
files and then setting up a vpn over an ftp connection (or sftp w/aes).
(the hosts ftp password is worth next to nothing, if the files are deemed
"sensitive" then a vpn is a good investment) and using openssl over apache.

simple automated ssh scripts w/ scp (secure copy) would also be an easy
method.  put the clients pub keys up on the box for quicker access.

Message-ID: <BAY2-F63lVRExYw0fMq00009721@hotmail.com>

I know Phil's problem has been solved, but just an FYI about 'timestamp' 
columns; they get set to system time not only when you INSERT the row, but 
anytime you UPDATE it.

It seems self-evident when you think about the purpose of the column type, 
but it's easy to forget to set the column's value to itself when you want to 
preserve the existing timestamp while doing unrelated administrative work on 
the table.

For that reason, I would recommend sticking with the 'datetime' column and 
manually updating it to NOW() when necessary.

Love ionCube (now called php_accelerator). Best ten minutes of code 
optimization I ever spent.

I've seen benchmark test of the various pre-compilers, and the 
conclusion I reached was that if you're really after tip-top performance 
you should do your own benchmarks. But it's definitely the way to go in 
general.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Cookies as session database [was php scalability]
Message-ID: <20030814132510.A3385@vtbear.com>

As an offshoot of this topic, what does anyone think of using
HTTP cookies as the session database?

	It seems to me the largest problem with the scalability
issue is allowing the large number of user sessions to persist
across the multiple hosts in the cluster.  So if this session
data came from the user, rather than a central backend database,
then the hosts could operate much more independently.

	Of course some clients (web browsers/users) do not
support HTTP cookies, for various reasons.  So in that case,
the server-side application could allow the conventional server-side
session-hosting.  Such a session mechanism would take effect
only if the client failed to pass a basic HTTP cookie test.

	Also, cookies have limitations, such as data size.  But,
for example, with a shopping cart application (like I am currently
building for high-availiability deployment), such session data could
easily fit within the 4096-byte limit of the latest HTTP Cookie
RFC (2965).

	Thanks for your thoughts.


Regards, George.

Just bear in mind that if you're going to use the Zend 
Encoder/Safeguard Suite, you're going to have to run Zend Optimizer 
which is incompatible with ionCube (which is so easy to install and 
use, I'd forgotten that I installed it on one of my servers).

On this last point, what if the user accepts some of your cookies, but
then gets sick of your intense use of cookies and just gives up.  While
this population is small, it is out there.

More importantly, if you go this route, remember, cookies can be
altered/forged.  Therefore, don't rely on cookies to tell you if the
person's session is valid and/or logged in.

Enjoy,

Use apc.  Its much faster than ionCube (which is closed source), and its
slowly being used everywhere at Yahoo! now.  Zend Accellerator has some
very cool features (like integrated content caching), but the price tag
is a bit high for most people

I've also heard good things about the Turck MMCache, unfortunately its
GPL, which precludes me from using it.

MySQL's default table handler, MyISAM, doesn't support foreign keys and so forth.  So, unless this is an InnoDB DB, it won't work.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] mysql_connect() doesn't affect mysql_error()?
Message-ID: <20030814174832.A1245@vtbear.com>

Hi.  I am calling @mysql_connect(...) with the leading '@' in order
to suppress the error messages.  But then if the connect fails, I
want to capture the exact error string of why the connect failed.
(I.e. send it to the admin, rather than to the user.)

	However, it seems that mysql_error() returns empty
after a failed mysql_connect()!  Is this normal?  Has it always
been this way?  I am using PHP 4.3.2.

	Is the only solution, then, to get rid of the leading '@' and
use the output buffering functions to grab the error message?  That
seems ugly.  Is there another way to re-route the error message after
mysql_connect()?

	Thanks!


Sincerely, George.

are you sure that your $ACTUAL_STARTPATH is a full filesystem path?
i.e.   /home/path/to/actual/start/path

the error seems to indicate that you're just trying to move up
relatively to the parent dir

Hopefully you figured it out as I believe that your 2 hour deadline is
long past due :)

If you have track_errors = on you can use an approach along the lines of 
what's done in my SQL Solution class:

    $this->SQLConnection = @mysql_connect($this->SQLHost,
            $this->SQLUser, $this->SQLPassword) or die
            ( $this->KillQuery($FileName, $FileLine, $php_errormsg) );

Yes and no, and I'd be hesitant to count on one of the mentioned app servers to take care of things automatically, or "automagically."  Regardless, PHP's session handler is module, so a change isn't catastrophic.  If well architected this should be a none issue.

As others have mentioned, rsync, or even CVS can be a solution here - or, regular tar files with a couple scripts (either shell or php itself).  While PHP doesn't have the pre-packaged feel and convienence of a J-based system, this is often good.  For one, I've found pre-packaged things never really do exactly what you need, and convienance is often an illusion which comes back to bite you later on.

It comes back to architecture; either system will fallpart in an environment that isn't well layed out and designed.  Granted, with the money poured into Java and the like, some of the work is done, and it can be helpful.  But it can also be illusive and inflexible, whereas PHP (and AMP in general) lends itself to a better designed and customized environment; and certainly a less expensive one.

Lastly, just to touch on Yahoo!'s use of PHP.  True, they do have a great team of talent, money and resources, and they'll be tweaking PHP (as they have FreeBSD, Apache, MySQL and even Oracle) for their environment to meet their needs.  While these "tweaks" are on a much bigger scale than tweaks needed by your typical site, they also have more traffic than your typical site :)

My apologies if my response is extremely late; I m just now able to catch up on
things.

I would just like to reiterate the points Dan made, specifically:

1. This approach is less secure.
2. This approach is less efficient.

To explain the first point, consider that you are suggesting storing client
data in cookies. This means that the risk of exposure is insanely high; this
data is being sent across the public Internet for every single transaction.

As for performance, you are adding a significant amount of overheard for every
single transaction. The same characteristic that makes this approach less
secure makes it less efficient. Rather than the client simply having to
identify itself, it is now sending you all session data in every request. In
addtion to this, you are sending back all session data you want to modify.

At any rate, I hope we've talked you out of this approach. :-)

Chris

Without compiling in mod_status support, which I will do in absence of a

Googlebot is using up 100% of my CPU, I'm curious to see what it is

By the way, I've tried lsof -p <pid of process> but it doesn't tell me
what file is being served, it just lists all the logs and the connection

Subject: [nycphp-talk] I need a function that will compare IP addresses
Message-ID: <022b01c362ee$3dd89b10$67a76244@philofsoa>

 have written a function that is supposed to compare the first three nodes of an IP address, but it is riddled with errors that I have given up trying to figure out.

Is there an existing function out there that can do this? I want to compare "127.0.0.1" with "127.0.0.100" and come with as a "match", or "127.0.0.1" with "127.0.0.1", but no "match if "127.0.0.1" and "127.255.0.0".

Here is what I have:

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This function will compare the first three instances of an IP address by splitting apart,
    gathering into a string the first three IP address nodes, and then returning strcmp of the
    two.  Will return a 1 if they are identical, otherwise, will return a 0.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
  function ip_isThreeNodeIdentical($ip1, $ip2) {
   if (!preg_match('/^([0-9]+\.)+[0-9]+$/i', $ip1) || !preg_match('/^([0-9]+\.)+[0-9]+$/i', $ip2)) {
    return 0;
   } else {
    $ip_array1 = explode('.', $ip1); $ip_array2 = explode('.', $ip2);
    foreach (array('1', '2') as $key => $val) {
     $ipArrayVal = 'ip_array' . $val; $ipCompareVal = 'ipCompare' . $val;
     for ($i = 0; $i < sizeof(${$ipArrayVal}) - 1; $i++) 
      ${ipCompareVal} .= ${ipArrayVal}[$i] . '.';
     ${ipCompareVal} = substr(${ipCompareVal}, 0, strrpos(${ipCompareVal), '.') - 1); 
    }
    return (strcmp($ipCompare1, $ipCompare2) == 0) ? 1 : 0;
   }
  }

I tried. :(

IPs are really just long ints.

This should take care of things:

Not that I know - at least not as complete as mod_status provides.  There is a scoreboard file, which I haven't played around with much, but might help.

Hmm, I think it should.  What about some of the other flags, like -d and so forth?  But I'd just go ahead load mod_status up :)

You can go into the http logs and grep for the process number.
That might give a clue.
Do something like a "tail -100 access_log | grep <pid that is hogging 
all cpu>"

This probably isn't the best solution, since it's just ad hoc email coding
(untested, etc.), but it seems a bit better than what you were trying:

$ip1 = '127.0.0.1';
$ip2 = '127.0.0.2';

$ip1_array = explode('.', $ip1);
$ip2_array = explode('.', $ip2);

$ip1_array['3'] = '';
$ip2_array['3'] = '';

$ip1 = implode('.', $ip1_array);
$ip2 = implode('.', $ip2_array);

if ($ip1 == $ip2)
{
     echo "First three octets are identical\n";
}

I'm sure there is a cooler way to compare the two using logical bitwise stuff,
but this might be easier to understand.

Hope that helps.

Chris

In general, it is good practice to return the Boolean evaluation in such
cases:

function compareip($ipa,$ipb) {
    return stristr(strrev($ipa),".")==stristr(strrev($ipb),".");
}

That was a lot of fun, and I missed the deadline by a good 6 hours.  It's
still buggy inasmuch as they can view documents without password protection,
but if I tighten the folder any, nobody can view any.

Suggestions are helpful, I've run out.

function is_identicalThreeNodeIP($ip1, $ip2) {
 return (substr($ip1, 0, strrpos($ip1, '.')) === substr($ip2, 0,

Try to rewrite it using absolute paths rather than relative, then check 
and recheck directory permissions. If PHP is moving a file somewhere, 
the target directory must be writeable by "nobody" or whomever the 
webserver runs as.

Whenever I need to do that kind of thing I set the group ownership of 
the target directory to nobody, then chmod 770. I figure it's a shade 
better than world-writeable, but not much.

Lately I've been trying to move files around with FTP instead so that 
they have the proper ownership, but that's a whole other ball of wax.

Run the script as a CGI.  Then the process and the files it creates will
run as your user id.  Therefore, you can set the permissions on the
directories and files to 700 so only the script and you can access them.

	PHP and viewing non-ASCII
Message-ID: <0b8401c365bb$7c135f80$67a76244@philofsoa>

This challenge is beyond me, as it seems to be the case.

I am having to set up a user-authentication script that is basic logon/registration process.  mySQL db captures username, password, and other important fields such as their payment category and isAdmin (if they are an admin on the site).  Once stored they will be able to login once payment category is '4' (which means 'PAID').  

Upon being able to login, one of the features any user, admin or not, can do is to view restricted files in the /web/contents folder.  They can view the list or click onto a link and view the file itself (assuming it's a url-friendly file like .txt or .doc or .pdf or something).

Here's where I am totally stuck.

The /web/contents folder must be locked down so that the outside world cannot view it; only authenticated users must view it.  Problem is, by doing that I force a double-login since that would involve using .htaccess on the folder.  (Note, I was told mySQL has a means of interfacing with .htacesss, however, that too would fail because the requirements for login involve username, password, isAdmin and payment_category all being set to certain values).

I thought of locking down the folder to 700 and each script uploaded to 600 (using TCL CGI instead of PHP to do the actual uploading), however, how would I be able to allow for users to VIEW non-ASCII files (like .doc or .pdf)?

Has anyone faced anything like that, if so, please let me know.

Thanx
Phil

Folks!

Try this:

<?php
function compareIPs($ip1,$ip2,$subnet='255.255.255.0') {
	$ip1quads = explode('.',$ip1);
	$ip2quads = explode('.',$ip2);
	$snquads = explode('.',$subnet);

	$identical = true;
	foreach( $snquads as $i => $mask) {
		$masked1 = (int) $ip1quads[$i] & (int) $mask;
		$masked2 = (int) $ip2quads[$i] & (int) $mask;
		$identical &= ($masked1 == $masked2 ? true:false);
	}

	return $identical;
}


echo '<li>'.compareIPs('192.168.0.3','192.168.0.4');
echo '<li>'.compareIPs('192.168.1.3','192.168.0.4');
echo '<li>'.compareIPs('192.168.1.3','192.168.0.4','255.255.0.0');
echo '<li>'.compareIPs('10.0.0.1','10.0.0.2','255.0.0.0');

?>


compareIPs will take 2 or 3 parameters; each is a dotted quad passed in as a
string.

The last parameter is the subnet mask (or netmask), and the default value is
'255.255.255.0' which ignores the last quad when comparing.

first I check to make sure the user has the right priviledges, if so,
then pass the file thru...

the link to the file might end up being something like

fileGetter.php?filename=word.doc

just remember to properly set the headers

One way to do it is to store the locked-down content outside of the 
document root, and then use a php script as a gatekeeper-- if a user 
requests a file, the script checks authentication, sends an appropriate 
Content-type header, and then outputs the file.

If you decide to go that route, you need to figure out how to call the 
gatekeeper script:

Easy way:
http://example.com/gatekeeper.php?file=realtive/path/to/file.pdf 

Harder, using Apache location directive (see below):
http://example.com/gatekeeper/path/to/file.pdf

For the second example to work, you'd need the following in httpd.conf 
(Location directives aren't allowed in htaccess):
<Location /gatekeeper>
    ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Location>

Warning-- make sure your gatekeeper script doesn't allow the user to 
access a file outside of the content directory. Always prepend a content 
root and reject any paths with .. in them, otherwise you may end up with 
someone asking for ../../../etc/passwd

I looked up fpassthru online and how to set the headers.  Your solution
sounds fine for hopefully viewing a single file, but how about producing a
list of files for display?

I have that already:

if (!($dirID = opendir($ACTUAL_STARTPATH . '/content/')) && $hasCookie) {
   $html .= $font . '<font color=cc0000><li>Could not open files in content
folder</li></font></font><p>';
  } else if ($hasCookie) {

   clearstatcache(); // CLEAR THE STATUS CACHE FOR is_file() TO PROPERLY
DETERMINE FILE STATUS
   $html .= $font . 'Contents: <p>';
   while (($file = readdir($dirID)) !== false) {
    if (is_file($file) || !preg_match('/^\./', $file)) {
     $html .= "\n<br><a href=/content/" . substr($file, strrpos('/', $file),
strlen($file)) .
              '>' . substr($file, strrpos('/', $file), strlen($file)) .
"</a><p>\n";
    }
   }
  }

However, this only works if the directory has permissions of at least 755
and each file at 777.  But that's not what the client wants, he wants it to
be set to permissions that the "outside world" can't view unless they log in
and are authenticated beforehand.

Hey Folks:

Last weeks lull has been more than made up by this weeks flood, including 
a vulnerability in PHP itself...

---------------------------
A PROBLEM IN PHP ITSELF !!!
---------------------------
PHP DLOpen Arbitrary Web Server Process Memory Vulnerability
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8405

A problem has been reported in the dlopen function of PHP when used with
the Apache web server.  Because of this, an attacker may be able to gain
unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information.

The problem is in the ability to access the memory of the calling process.
When a PHP script is executed by an Apache process, it is possible to
dump the contents of the Apache process memory to a text file.  This could
be used by an attacker to gain access to potentially sensitive information
which could include authentication credentials.  The function may also
permit other attacks, such as allowing an attacker to deliver different
content other than what the server is configured to serve.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] form posts, back button, IE page expired
Message-ID: <E19oqJ0-0001tR-6y@rslrs1-server.com>



How do you guys/gals deal with the IE Page Expired page which is
generated if you use the back button to return to a page which had form
POST information in it originally?

For example:
  formPage.php - Fill out a form and submit (method is POST) to
formResult.php
  formResult.php - Shows the result of the form submission/post; i.e.
"Your order has been placed" or "Thank you for contacting us" etc...

  from formResult.php the user clicks a link back to the homepage.
  from the homepage, the user hits the back button.

Netscape and Mozilla give the little popup window warning/notice and ask
if you want to resubmit/resend the information.

Internet Explorer shows the nasty "Warning Page Expired" page, which, if
you refresh, then brings up a prompt similar to Netscape/Mozilla.


The little prompt to resubmit info isn't ideal, either, but at least
it's not the Warning Page Expired page.

Short of not using POST (which would be unreasonable) or page redirects
(nearly as undesirable), has anyone figured out a good clean way to get
around this?

thanks

p.s. of course, assume that the pages have adequate navigation, etc, so
that users are REQUIRED to hit the back button. :)

Guess you didn't see my posting on this subject saying in situations like 
the one you're coding for, it's best to run the scripts as CGI's.

Sounds like you/your server is setting cache headers.  Don't.  Then your
problems will disappear.

True about the permissions -- the webserver user has to be able to read 
the files (though not necessarily write or execute them in this case).

But if the /content directory is outside of the webserver's document 
root, then someone would need another means of access to the server in 
order to read the files-- they couldn't get at them via http.

As was suggested before, some of these issues go away if you use PHP in 
CGI mode, because then PHP runs as your UID.
They also go away a little bit if you change the ownership on the 
content directory so that it is group nobody-- at least then only you 
and the webserver can get to the files, and not other users (unless 
they're in the webserver's group of course).

But if you're really concerned about other users on the server, you 
probably need your own box.

great.. thanks..

session_cache_limiter()

which setting do you recommend.. it looks like, from comments, to use
'private' or are you suggesting 'none' ?

To answer your immediate question, you can do either of the following:

1. Allow caching
2. Use an intermediate URL for processing

To explain why browsers seem to behave differently, read on...

If you will look at section 13.13 of RFC 2616
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt), you will see the following statement:

"In particular history mechanisms SHOULD NOT try to show a semantically
transparent view of the current state of a resource. Rather, a history
mechanism is meant to show exactly what the user saw at the time when the
resource was retrieved."

It sounds like whether you allow caching should make no difference, right? The
back button (history mechanism) should not ask the user to repost data, because
it should be displaying exactly what it did before. This is how lynx works, if
you're familiar with using it.

In most cases, your PHP applications are going to send a Cache-Control header
that includes the no-store directive (unless you are controlling your headers
more specifically than most developers). In section 14.9.2, the no-store
directive of the Cache-Control header is explained:

"If sent in a request, a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this request
or any response to it. If sent in a response, a cache MUST NOT store any part
of either this response or the request that elicited it."

Thus, depending on how your interpret these statements, it seems quite likely
that you might come to very different conclusions about how to implement a
history mechanism. This might account for the discrepancies in implementation.

Hope that helps.

Chris

thanks, Chris..

I used set_cache_limiter('private')... I think it is working the way I
want it to.

The history mechanism is fine, with no resubmission/post of data.

All I really about care in this case is getting my client off my back
about the Warning Page Expired page. :-D

your detailed information is still appreciated and will be helpful in
the future when I care more about the data's shelf-life

Depends on the behavior you want.  I'd guess as long as it's not 
"nocache," you'll be fine.  Do some hacking and let us know what works for 
you.

I am thinking of doing CGI as a good interim solution for the /content
problem, however, there is one area I cannot figure out.

Whereas I could use CGI to display a list of files, and CGI to view an
ASCII-based file (.txt, .html, .php, etc.) and display within the CGI
wrapper, what would I do about non-ASCII files such as .doc or .pdf  or even
.jpg?

Hmm... does this strike anyone else as an odd report?  The report must be referring to mod_php and since it's loaded directly into Apache, of course it can read the memory - as can any Apache module...  any thoughts from those with more Apache/PHP internal knowledge than I?

Seems like a "duh" report and a false-positive,

Well now that my DSL is finally back online (only as of about 4:30pm today) it seems fine.  Although, I've heard that Verizon is going through some tough times, so it may be related.

try using readdir() after making the same authentication checks

note: you would probably want to have the files and directory outside of
the httpd directories so that noone would be able to access them by
directly inputting the path and filename.

and, when returning the results of readdir(), exclude the parent dir
(..) so people won't have a way to work their way up the tree, etc...
(unless you want them to)

Message-ID: <E19orWZ-0000DV-Be@rslrs1-server.com>

you are probably going to have to do your own MIME typing and
appropriate setting of headers...

unless you want them all to force download, you can use
  header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");

at least that's what I use... there was a discussion about all of this a
while ago about forcing downloads, I can't remember what the final
consensus was

maybe you could even come up with some creative solution using a custom
404 error page which is actually a php page that looks for the file in
question, after checking user authentication (cookies, I assume), and if
it finds it initiates the download... and maybe that would then take
advantage of apache's MIME settings since you called the file as
domain.com/file.doc
I dunno if that would actually work... would have to be tried

Any reason why header("Content-type: image/jpeg") wouldn't work with CGI?

Thanks for these important observations.  Please allow me to
address them both:

	Security:  assuming that SSL is *not* in use, the cookie
data can be seen by third parties, as we all know.  But some data
does not need to be secure, like shopping cart contents.  Am I
mistaken in believing that the item(s) in a customers shopping
cart must be secured?  At least in the early stages of a shopping
experience, the only exposed data would be the URL's requested,
user's IP address, and the shopping cart contents.

	Later when a user enters their personal information
such as addresses, security seems to become more important.  And
when they enter their billing information (ie. credit card #)
obviously the connection *must* be secure.

	So my question is, for a shopping cart application, what
user data items really need to be secure?


	Efficiency:  as Chris knows since he wrote the book on
HTTP, the HTTP cookie specifications (both Netscape's as well as
the "version 2") allow for such cookie data to be transported among
only a subset of viewed pages on a web site.  Therefore, in this
same shopping cart example, the application can efficiently direct
the HTTP client (web browser) to send the cookie data to only the
URLs that will need to see it.  For example, the application could
set the "cart contents" cookie to have a "path" value of "/cart/"
and the "personal info" cookie to have a path value of "/cart/secure/"
and a secure flag of 1.  Such a setup seems like it would satisfy
both issues, don't you think?

	Another efficiency issue relates to the size of the HTTP
cookies.  To this end we could specially format and even compress
or pack the user data into a smaller byte-representation.  For example,
an uncompressed "cart contents" cookie with three line items might look
like this:

1|PJ00111|c:blue;s:small|1|PJ00103|c:orange;s=small|8|ACC00101|s:5|

The server can then do product lookup queries on each of these
three items to build a more readable or detailed list:

	Qty  SKU         Price    Description
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	1    PJ00111     49.95    Sweet Dreams Kimono
	                           Size: Small, Color: Blue
	1    PJ00103     75.95    Rose Garden Gown
	                           Size: Small, Color: Orange
	8    ACC00101    12.95    Pink Fleece Sleep Socks
	                            Size: 5/8

(Yes, this is for a pajama-selling site (pajamagram.com).)


	I would really like to make HTTP cookies do the work
that we normally impose on central databases, because then we
can scale a server cluster linearly, simply by adding more
hardware.  Thanks again for your comments.

Best, George.

Folks,

I have always thought that the underlying problem is that when a page is
requested via POST, most browsers will be (understandably) hesitant about
re-POSTING all the data that was sent to draw the page, hence the warning
messages.

I've restructured my apps, whereever applicable, to POST to a backend script
that NEVER prints to the browser, but at the end of its processing, redirects
to a 'landing' page:

[form page] -(SUBMITS TO)-> [backend page] -(REDIRECTS TO)-> [landing page]

1. formpage.php: page with form elements; user fills and submits to
backend.php
2. backend.php: does processing AND NEVER PRINTS ANYTHING TO BROWSER.
	a. Save the submitted data to a session var if you'd like (
unset($_SESSION['form']); $_SESSION['form'] = $_POST; )
	b. Process data (insert into db, etc.)
	c. Redirect to landing page ( header('Location: landingpage.php'); )
3. landingpage.php (or, formpage.php?mode=complete ) : Can use
$_SESSION['form'] if need be to echo user-supplied data.

No matter cache settings (which can be complex, and not all cache settings are
respected by all browsers AND there are both proxy caches and browser caches,
etc, etc....), this scheme has worked well for me -- I never have the 'expired
page' errors I used to have.

Please provide constructive criticism or comments about this!

Thanks,

Wellington

I thought you gave a nice explanation of the "redirect to another page" method
that was mentioned. It was one of the two methods brought up.

The only flaw that stood out to me was this:

> header('Location: landingpage.php');

While this actually works on most browsers, a Location header is supposed to
provide an absolute URL, not a relative one.

The only reason caching is worth mentioning as well is that it might possibly
be easier to implement, depending on how much of the application's architecture
is already developed. I don't think there is a clearly better method in terms
of doing the Right Thing, so it's good to point out all options (which is why I
enjoy the way mailing lists typically answer a question several times in as
many different ways).

Chris

Chris & List,

Thanks for the comments! Only after I posted did I notice that you had
mentioned the 'intermediate' page method earlier. Anyway, the list has an
elaboration on that.

Again, thanks! Its always a good idea to go back to the sources and read up on
the HTTP spec once in a while... BTW, on this point, I have almost always
passed in full URLs because browsers sometimes render the URL of the
intermediate page if you don't. Another reason to read, understand & implement
according to spec...

<snip>

Yes! Caching is VERY important and I suggest everyone reads
http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/ or something like it to understand the
different kinds of caching, implementation strangeness & strategies for
getting the results you want.

Why certainly:

<?php

DOCUMENT_ROOT

$filename= CONTENT_ROOT."/path/to/image.jpg";
if  ( file_exists($filename) )
{

Good point about SSL. That does indeed mitigate many security concerns.
However, it does not address concerns about browser vulnerabilities.

Because a simple flaw could cause a browser to send cookies to unauthorized
sites, there is still a risk. IE versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 have all had
major security flaws that allow anyone to read any cookie from any domain, and
often these flaws expose cookies with the "secure" directive set.

IE 4.0 and 5.0:
http://www.peacefire.org/security/iecookies/

IE 5.5 and 6.0:
http://www.solutions.fi/iebug/

> But some data does not need to be secure

Another excellent point. Sites such as Google use cookies to allow users to set
preferences without having to log in or establish any sort of account. So,
cookies can actually help to *improve* a user's privacy and/or anonymity,
despite their bad reputation. :-)

Right. So, at some point you're going to want to concern yourself with
security. Of course, cookies aren't inherently insecure, else any system which
uses them would be easily compromised. You just want to make cookie theft
useless for the attacker (methods of doing this are probably worthy of an
article of some sort).

True, and this is a good example of applying your creativity to make cookies
work for what you are trying to do. But, is it worth the effort, when there
might be a method you can use to diminish all unnecessary traffic as well as
allow yourself more flexibility on the server-side to access any of the
client's data at any time? That is up to you, but cookies were intended as a
state management mechanism and not really a session management mechanism.

When you do not actually need to maintain a session (Google's user preferences,
perhaps a user's shopping cart while they are still shopping, etc.), cookies
are probably fine.

This is similar to looking up a client's data based on the unique identifier.
It seems to be a similar problem with the exception that the client data is
more volatile.

There are many creative ideas out there for addressing this problem. You could
use different hostnames much like you mentioned using different cookies paths.
You could implement a more intelligent "sticky sessions" mechanism. Another
option might be to look into using msession, since it allows you to use
sessions in a cluster without a central database. In the end, whatever you're
most comfortable with is probably going to be what gets the job done.

Hope that helps.

	msession is a very interesting idea.

	Has anyone had any good or bad experiences with msession?  

	Chris, thanks for the other great suggestions too; I will
continue to ponder them....

Don't give up so easlily.  You've got to be a hacker to get things done!  

First off, you're saying that the PHP script ran as CGI and produced a PHP 
Warning saying something like "Permission denied ... on line x?"  So, 
please copy and paste the error message here.  It includes the path, which 
we'll need to diagnose the problem.

I bet the ownership, permissions and/or path of the dirs/files in
question is not set up correctly.

In your shell terminal do an "ls -la /path/to/secure/dir" of the directory
where those secured files are.  Also, do an "ls -la /path/to/web/dir"
where the script you're running is.  Send us the results for ., .. and the
script/file in question, including the exact command you typed in.

Hmmm...  You're just reading files, right?  Try this in your shell and let
us know what happens:  "whoami" and then
"cat /path/to/secue/dir/testfile.txt"

Also, some servers have path mappings that are different from the shell
than from a CGI executing on the web host.  Ask the system administrator
if there's something like that going on here.

Dan, out of fairness I completely DID give up on PHP using as CGI and
decided on TCL instead as CGI.  The results are quite positive, except now I
have no way of knowing exactly how to view non-ASCII (binary) files with
permissions of 0700.

So, more reserach until dawn!

Everything is working on the CGI scripts, turns out they were the
inevitable: SYNTAX ERRORS.  Some hacker I'll make :(  After quick fixing I
am able now to list all files, upload a file and delete a file.  I could not
do it in PHP and did not think I would ever come up with a timely solution
using PHP, whereas using TCL as CGI I was able to do so with few problems
(except, of course, the inability to view non-ASCII files at this time).

Yes, I thought so when I first read it, but I didn't feel like bothering 
with commentary when I posted.

First, it seemed more like an Apache issue.  Then, why would this one
function be a problem?  Doesn't everything go into memory?  So, I went to
php.net/dlopen to research what this function does.  Turns out it's not in
the manual.  Is this a function that's used by PHP internals or something?

My experience in the past has been with Vignette as a content management solution for use especially with sites that need to deliver "human translation" multilingual content.  Does PHPNuke offer the same solution?  I have some .txt files that illustrate the concept of what I'm hoping PHPNuke can do, or anything PHP-based.

As it turns out, yes it is something in PHP's source code.  I wrote 
Security Focus to have them clarify such in the database/webpage and to 
fix the broken links to the exploit code.  They responded accordingly.

dlopen is a c command used by php for opening a shared object.
similar to the php command dl().

As Max pointed out, dlopen() will load a shared object, akin to dl() in PHP-land (IIRC).  But I still don't see how this is a valid security hole.  When you load a shared object, its implied that it'll have access to the process.  It's like saying: my apartment's front door is a vulnerability because when I invite someone in, they can see my apartment.

It's quite possible I'm missing something, but I wish securityfocus.com would acknowledge this as erroneous.  Although I'm not holding my breath.

Hi,

I find this discussion very interesting, since redirecting is a subject that
comes up in just about every project I can remember. Also, I think I can
finally contribute my $0.02 to the list...

I'd like to point out that is usually safe practice to put an exit; line
after the header/Location call. I have been baffled by weird results more
than once, usually because something was echoed after the header call.

Best regards,
Mauricio

Subject: [nycphp-talk] form posts, back button, IE page expired
Message-ID: <E19pIzU-0002fh-TQ@rslrs1-server.com>

I'm going to have to do as you suggest and hack away at this.

While it solved my back button issue, setting it to 'private' completely
screwed up everything with the site having to do with cookies and
sessions, at least in IE on a PC. For now I've removed it while I work
it out.

As I've thought about it and what changing the session_cache_limiter is
doing, it makes sense that it would have these sort of repercussions.
Maybe it's my approach, I'm not sure yet.

My theory is revolving around the page being cached (which seemingly
allowed for using the back button to a POST result page) and thus not
redisplaying with new information contained in cookies/sessions when
that page is reloaded.

I know that sounds confusing... I will investigate and provide a report
of some sort.

The header("Location: ") approach does seem interesting.. I need to
re-read the thread, but what, if any, cross browser/platform issues with
this are there?


sigh... all this and my connection is super slow because "Verizon's
DSLAMs are still struggling with the msblast virus load" (so sayeth my ISP)

apparently it's the msblast worm overloading the DSLAMs.. at least that
is what my ISP told me... 

seems to have cleared up over the last 10 minutes... perhaps something
to do with midnight and a new day? I don't really know the details of
the virus since I wasn't personally concerned about it and how it
wouldn't affect me (RedHat, X Windows, Gnome).

I guess I was wrong and it had me by the cojones all day. That is, until
I decided it was too nice of a day outside to sit here and wait for web
pages to load. :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] compiling php with an external module?
Message-ID: <3F439BD7.8070007@datawhorehouse.com>

I'm trying to compile php-4.3.2 to include cybercash support.

In previous versions, there was a --enable-cybercash option,
but that seems to have been moved to something called PECL.

George Schlossnagle wrote a pear module which can be found
at http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?package=cybercash&version=1.18p1

I have downloaded and un-tgz'd it, however, I'm not sure
what to do with this file, where it should be placed, or what
role it plays in the compile process.

I first untargz'd it into the ext directory of the source tree, renamed
it cybercash then tried to compile with --with-cybercash
that did not work.

I also did a "pear install cybercash-1.18p1.tgz"
The pear installer responded with "success" but the cybercash
module will still not compile into binary.

Can someone please point me in the right direction here?

You don't need to compile items in PEAR.  In your scripts, just include
the relevant PEAR file and start using the package's methods.

sad to say, I think the pear module is only 1/2 the picture
in the source of the php modules, it says that php needs
to be compiled with cybercash support. I've tried different
combinations in attempt to compile the cybercash libaries
into php and none of them have succeeded. Google
searches for php and cybercash only lead to more
pleas from people begging for advice on how to compile it.

Cybercash had provided pre-compiled binaries with their
package "mck-3.3.1-i586-pc-linux-gnulibc2"

The old way with php was to simply ./configure 
--with-cybercash=../mck-3.3.1-i586-pc-linux-gnulibc2
but when I do that now... the results of the config show nothing.
It doesn't even try to detect it.

I think some of the stuff is outdated, as is the docs for PECL/PEAR.

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/pecl.apd.php has some good tips on getting modules to work in general, and I think there are some docs in PHP's CVS regarding these topics.

If you have items left over, you may want to donate the rest to one of the
non-profits here in NYC that are helping other non-profits use technology.
Check out npowerny.org... they are a good organizationa and always looking
for old machines for inner city labs.

And if you should throw any electronics away, be sure they don't go to the
landfill due to all the toxic contents.  Check department of sanitation
web site for proper disposal.

This'll work:

function ipmatch ( $ip1, $ip2 ) {
  if( ereg( "(([0-9]{1,3}\.){3})[0-9]{1,3}", $ip1, $match1 ) &&
      ereg( "(([0-9]{1,3}\.){3})[0-9]{1,3}", $ip2, $match2 ) ) {
    return( $match1[ 1 ] == $match2[ 1 ] );
  }
}

Perhaps I'm missing something here: what I'm trying to do is insert a new record and immediately obtain the id column field value from the new record.

Maybe you should output mysql_error() on failure. That will be far more
informative than any guess I can make. You could have too many connections or
any number of other errors that could cause sporadic behavior.

You should use the function for tht and save yourself a query:

http://www.php.net/mysql_insert_id

Hope that helps.

It does not "persist", meaning it will only show the latest error, according
to the manual, on page:

http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-error.php

They also mention that it will not be changed if the user does not have
permission to do what you intend or if the connection has been closed
already.

Good luck,
Mauricio

Re: [nycphp-talk] if mysql_query() produces an error....Then I'm confused.  Why is it then that mysql_select_db() will bomb after the user attempted to enter erroneous data into mysql_query()?  That is, the user enters bad data within mysql_query(); it throws mysql_error() and delivers the page to the user; the user attempts AGAIN to enter somethng and then mysql_select_db dies!  Why does that occur?

Difficult to say without knowing the page code, but I would var_dump the
variables (particularly the queries) prior to running them. Make sure to
test the connection state as well. I have a feeling you might be closing it
and not reopening. Maybe the call that opens the connection does not show up
in the second time you run the page...?

Best regards,

Re: [nycphp-talk] if mysql_query() produces an error....I think I might have found the problem.. again, proving my limited knowledge of PHP functions (can I switch brains with any of you guys?), I did not know about this:

mysql_free_result($query);

I was using

$query = ''; mysql_close($dbConn);

This, I thought, from my ASP days, would free the query resources, as it does in ASP, however, in PHP it's not the case.

This might have caused the latent issues involving mysql_select_db() failing.

You're right Matthew.  Dreamweaver does have the ability to build SQL
queries in a GUI-type environment (and also to view the pages in WYSIWYG
fashion with true data in the dynamic page).  I've fiddled around with that
part of the application while building some php pages.

IMHO, Dreamweaver does still favor ASP and CFM pages (that's where they
started from).  However the PHP support has increased dramatically in the
last couple of releases.

And you can always stay with "code only" views if you're more of a purist.
But the WYSIWYG option HAS allowed me to bring more graphic-centric staff
into the dynamic-coding environment by building queries or content
graphically and then review the code with them.  Of course this sometimes
becomes more of a "don't code this way" exercise... but helpful
none-the-less.

Just my Friday morning 2 cents worth....

If I am not mistaken, Dreamweaver might have this functionality. I know

build SQL Queries.

Be careful about relying too much on the code generated by DreamWeaver. It's gotten me in to TONS of trouble! I've rewritten the vast majority of the code it generates.

Very true!  It doesn't like some php stuff and will conveniently throw in
extra characters to suit its needs - resulting in a needle/haystack when the
compiler pukes.  I've found the Zend IDE much better (although it lacks the
DW HTML tools).

Be careful about relying too much on the code generated by DreamWeaver. It's
gotten me in to TONS of trouble! I've rewritten the vast majority of the
code it generates.

Has anyone have anything like this happen to them? How have you handled it, I'm out of ideas.

Thanks
Phil

Phil,

Unfortunately, this means that you were really not able to provide what I had asked for.  As was explained in my original bid request "The key to this will be that I would like to be able to add the pages in the password protected part of the site by either filling in a form OR using FrontPage 2002."  Since I am not able to do this with adding text and images in a way that people can read it, I am going to have to find another alternative.  I will be deleting your files from the web site and starting over and hopefully will still be able to have this finished by Sunday

OK, so if he is creating them in Word, he can output them straight to 
PDF from there.  All he needs is the full version of Acrobat.  Then he 
can just FTP them to the secure area and provide a link.

 From Word, outputting to PDF is very easy once Acrobat is installed.  
File > Print, choose the PDF writer as the printer.

1. You did, but you also said if he had Illustrator.  Maybe he is 
thinking he needs to buy Illustrator as well?

2.  Another option:
He can output them directly to html from Word.  Word creates the page 
and a folder to hold the images and an xml file.  If he FTP's the page 
and the folder to a directory it will work.  No renaming necessary.  I 
just did it, took me under a minute.

3. Of course, you could build him a form page that lets him type in 
some text and upload the image file and write the php which creates the 
html page upon submission...

  He has Illustrator and doesn't want to use that because he says it wants to "keep it simple" for his clients.

  He doesn't want to FTP either.  I suggested that and he refuses stating that it's more work than he wants.  He wants it so that the HTML file, images and all, go at once to the same server, embedded as if they were the original .doc file.

  3. Of course, you could build him a form page that lets him type in some text and upload the image file and write the php which creates the html page upon submission...

  Nixed that too.  He wants a single upload.  He doesn't want to do any more work because it's "out of scope" with what he wants.

While PDF is obviously the best solution here, I belive FrontPage has an FTP upload utility built into it that he could use to upload the pages directly to the server.  And I know that in Dreamweaver, there is an option to include dependant files during an ftp upload which will automatically upload any image files needed by the page and place them in the correct directories.  It makes uploading super easy for lazy users.  Im not terribly familiar with FrontPage, but I would assume it has something similar.

More on Pt 2, Aaron..

I know about how Word creates the subfolder for images and XML.  However, he is doing this on his own machine which has no network connection to the remote server where everything has to go.  In order for the stuff to be on the remote server he would have to FTP it, create appropriate folders, etc., populate them with images, on the remote box.  He won't do that.

Suggestion: Make an "upload" page. Something inside the pwd protected page
that would allow him to upload many files. They will all upload to the same
directory, so the images will be there. Tell him that he has to have the
images in the same directory in his computer when he creates the file, this
should not be a problem.

In the "upload" page, to avoid further discussion, you can even call one of
the upload fields "Word document" and the others images. You're just using
HTML input fields, really, and uploading them to a specific directory.

That should do it. If it does, 10% is my going rate, hehehe ;-)
 
Cheers,
Mauricio

Yep, and trust me I tried to convince him to go the PDF route but he not only refused, he deleted all of the PHP, TCL, XML and SQL scripts I wrote and scrapped everything I did claiming that I did not do as he "required".

  While PDF is obviously the best solution here, I belive FrontPage has an FTP upload utility built into it that he could use to upload the pages directly to the server.  And I know that in Dreamweaver, there is an option to include dependant files during an ftp upload which will automatically upload any image files needed by the page and place them in the correct directories.  It makes uploading super easy for lazy users.  Im not terribly familiar with FrontPage, but I would assume it has something similar.

      1. You did, but you also said if he had Illustrator. Maybe he is thinking he needs to buy Illustrator as well?

      He has Illustrator and doesn't want to use that because he says it wants to "keep it simple" for his clients.

      2. Another option:
      He can output them directly to html from Word. Word creates the page and a folder to hold the images and an xml file. If he FTP's the page and the folder to a directory it will work. No renaming necessary. I just did it, took me under a minute.

      He doesn't want to FTP either.  I suggested that and he refuses stating that it's more work than he wants.  He wants it so that the HTML file, images and all, go at once to the same server, embedded as if they were the original .doc file.

      3. Of course, you could build him a form page that lets him type in some text and upload the image file and write the php which creates the html page upon submission...

      Nixed that too.  He wants a single upload.  He doesn't want to do any more work because it's "out of scope" with what he wants.

I suggested that too, Mauricio.  He refused to do so, it was "more work than
what I expect from an upload page".  He has, or rather HAD an upload page
(he deleted what I did now) that uploads the file, but he wanted it to
upload only a SINGLE file, complete with images intact if need be.

WOW.

F&%$ him.  He's not worth your time.

I mean, what's the big difference in uploading ONE file vs. uploading 
ONE file and ONE folder?  It can be done in the same session on the 
same page.  Just have to brows on your computer for a file/folder TWICE 
instead of ONCE?!

He's really asking for the impossible as far as I can tell.  The only 
thing that creates a file with embedded images so it is all in one is 
Acrobat, as far as I know.  AND, if his users can work in Word, they 
can certainly print, and if they can print, they can change the little 
dialogue box from their printer to PDF distiller.

I can't think of any way that it could possibly be a SINGLE upload.

Even, as was mentioned in the origial post, FrontPage was used. There
would still be multiple files sent to the server.

You might want to look into a content management system.
Check out ewebeditpro by ektron. I believe
there is also a freeware alternative, but it might require
some hacking on your part to arrive at a polished solution.
That will allow him to add/update wysiwyg pages within the browser.
That includes uploading/using images.

Considering he removed me from the project, deleted all the files and
everything else, I couldn't give a rat's arse what he does at this point,
but that's good to know for the future.

I just wanted to know if I were the only one on earth that gets clients from
Hell.

actually, i take that back

you could base64_encode() the image file data into a single php file,

something like

right? Wouldn't this work? It's spastic and this is just a (more or
less) theoretical example that would need to be properly written.

Thoughts?

There's also Macromedia Contribute CMS which is $99 and I've heard good 
reviews although haven't had a chance to use yet.

I've got client from hell stories as well, but yours is a keeper!  Feel 
your pain...

The simplest solution for him was to convert to PDF.  He already has
Illustrator and I'm sure PageMaker along with it, import the .doc, export as
.PDF, everyone (even those without Word, on Mac or Linux OS!) can view it.
You'd think the simplest solution would have swayed him; he went off!

Wow... That's cold... I do believe you have a small courts case in your
hand, if the money he was paying is worth the trouble. Was there a contract?

Best regards,

Or you could tell him to buy a Mac. Any program on MacOS X can print preview
to PDF. Second thought, don't tell him to buy a Mac. Mac Users are usually
nice people ;-)

There was indeed a contract through rentacoder.com - but the hilarious part
of all of this is this:

1) He ALREADY paid me!
2) He already gave me a 10/10 excellent rating after closing the project
(and on rentacoder.com your rating upon a closed project CANNOT be changed!)
3) [no official comment on any backup copies of code]

Phil,

I'm sorry, but based on this new information, this no longer qualifies
as a "Project From Hell."

Oh CRAP I failed.. but hey, it was only $68.00 I got paid for this.

The part that really galled me was the incredible architecture I laid out
for his user registration process making it fully automated; he chucked that
last week because he wanted it "simple": people submit an email and he
enters them himself.

I was tempted to respond with "So why do you need a CMA? Use the service
provider's bloody administrative site and put them into mySQL yourself!"
but I needed that $68.00

Phil,

Based on this new information, your story has been re-instated with
"Project From Hell" status.

$68? I understand that you need it, but what sort of slave driver does
your (former) client think he is?

If you have a chance, for educational purposes, at least, try working
out that suggested solution I posted and let us know if you can get it
to work. Just in case Lawrence calls up any of us instead, then we can
tell him that it CAN be done. :)

  um, didn't you just spend $68.50 in time for all these emails?

The part that really galled me was the incredible architecture I laid out

last week because he wanted it "simple": people submit an email and he
enters them himself.

I was tempted to respond with "So why do you need a CMA? Use the service
provider's bloody administrative site and put them into mySQL yourself!"
but I needed that $68.00

  Phil,

I'm sorry, but based on this new information, this no longer qualifies
as a "Project From Hell."

:)



    There was indeed a contract through rentacoder.com - but the hilarious
      part
    of all of this is this:

1) He ALREADY paid me!
2) He already gave me a 10/10 excellent rating after closing the project
(and on rentacoder.com your rating upon a closed project CANNOT be
      changed!)
    3) [no official comment on any backup copies of code]

Wouldn't that be funny? Laurence calls one of us to do that. We tell him it
will cost him $134, "hey, you get what you pay for, right? (nudge, nudge)".
Then pass the project and the money to Phil. :-)

If he comes my way, that's what will happen, I guarantee it.

I come as an apparent bargain.  I am waiting for him to come crawling back
after realizing that his alternatives will cost him in the hundreds of
dollars (provided he gets either an out-of-the-box CMS package, PageMaker or
someone to code the multi-file upload against his wishes) and then I can
say, "Oh, no problem, but pro-rated costs for such an architecture will now
cost you $800!"

I think you need at least another 0 there ($1340), else it is Phil you are
hurting, not this Laurence guy.

I'm not saying I've ever done this , and I'm not saying it would
even be worth it given the overall situation, but just for the sake of
the idea...

A single upload of a word document would be possible if you could
manipulate it once you got it to the server. If it were a Windows
server, you'd be able to programmatically perform the save-as-html
operation by driving Word via vbscript. I'm not sure where the images folder would go. On
Linux, meanwhile, maybe you could script OpenOffice to achieve the same
result. Or possibly some other utility.

It's possible, theoretically, but also a lot of work.

I figured I'd double the original price but you are right. Phil, what were

Well at rentacoder they usually have fixed bid ceilings you have to adhere
to, so were I to suggest a fairer price than $80 (- rentacoder fees comes to
$68.00) it would not be acceptable by rentacoder themselves.

Then again, I am being considered for two PHP projects, one for $1000 and
the other for $3000! :) :)  And I have a 10/10 rating, thanx to our pal
Laurence.

Because I have too much actual work to do, I decided to put my theory to
the test and write it up myself.

I actually think I was pretty much spot on from the beginning. Damn, I'm
good.

Of course, it would still be a trick to get the base64_encode()d image
data into the single file in the first place... but that's another issue.

Phil, you owe me $34.25

hah. that is pretty funny.

Actually, you could probably use a procmail script to
forward an html email (chock full 'o images) to the
php script. So, the author of the pages could simply
use outlook or some other html-enabled mail client
to compose the pages, send them to some obscure adderss like
987awef9239823r9238r9823q at bladomain.com and
then the php script would split/decode the payload and
place things wherever they are supposed to go.

Phil, I want a water too.

This might work.. somehow. I did get the idea for embedding the base64
image data in the page from the way that emails work.

I don't use outlook, but would there be a way to get Outlook to convert
a word doc for you? Or could word do it itself?

I made the same exact switch, i.e., to the Zend IDE.

Very true!  It doesn't like some php stuff and will conveniently throw
in
extra characters to suit its needs - resulting in a needle/haystack when
the
compiler pukes.  I've found the Zend IDE much better (although it lacks
the
DW HTML tools).

Be careful about relying too much on the code generated by DreamWeaver.
It's
gotten me in to TONS of trouble! I've rewritten the vast majority of the

Well, the former client "solved" his problem.  He put .htaccess and
.htpasswd onto the root directory and so everyone has to send him $ and he
sends them username and password to enter.  He completely bypassed the
web-based CMA solution and everything else in favor of something that
low-level.

Looks like he THINKS he got the last laugh on me.

I had a guy whose website I had developed.  His office's DSL connection went down for a few days, causing his e-mail box was filling up with emails and spam, and it started bouncing emails.   He expected me to go into his email box and manually delete all the spam for him, and he refused to pay $10/month more to the ISP for a larger email box, because it was a "waste of money".
 
Needless to say I fired him as a client.

This RedHat novice is having trouble getting MySQL to autostart on boot.

Following instructions found in my MySQL book, I have put a symlink in
/etc/rc3.d as follows

[david at vernon0 rc3.d]$ ls -l S99mysql
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           16 Aug 25 12:02 S99mysql -> ../init.d/mysqld

and init.d/mysql looks like this

[david at vernon0 rc3.d]$ head ../init.d/mysqld
#!/bin/bash
#
# mysqld        This shell script takes care of starting and stopping
#               the MySQL subsystem (mysqld).
#
# chkconfig: - 78 12
# description:  MySQL database server.
# processname: mysqld
# config: /etc/my.cnf
# pidfile: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
# [ etc ]

and its permission are set thus

[david at vernon0 rc3.d]$ ls -l  ../init.d/mysqld
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         1772 Apr 30 13:31 ../init.d/mysqld


I'm told this mysqld script is the beast that's also known as
mysql.server. My understanding is that when Linux boots and gets to
runlevel 3, it invokes the S99mysql script with an argument of 'start'.

When I reboot, I don't get any mysql starting and I can't find any error
messages saying what went wrong -- maybe because I don't know where to
look. /var/log/mysqld.log is empty.

I can't watch the boot process on the console right now because I'm
accessing the machine via SSH, so I reboot it, then log back in and look
in /var/log/boot.log, and it is silent as far as mysql is concerned.

Suggestions?

TIA

David,

rename your symlink to "mysql" instead of "mysqld"... i.e. according to 
what you've written, the startup script in  /etc/init.d is "mysql"
and the symlink is "mysqld"... just make them match

John

Thanks for the reply. I've done that and now I have this:

Do you have it configured to start automatically?  (ntsysv at a terminal 
prompt as root on a RedHat system should work)

also, if you cd to /etc/init.d/
and enter   ./mysql start

you can start it manually... don't forget the "period slash" in front of 
the command (which I seem to do regularly :)

Hi All,

I was wondering what solutions any of you have used to created PDF files
(from a php script running on a unix server).
We're currently using HTML to PDF - http://www.rustyparts.com/pdf.php which
works ok, but we're finding it cifficult to get some of the fine tuning we
want.

Thanx
Ophir

--------------------
Slow Down Internet Worms With Tarpits
http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1723

IPtables handles this by allowing a tarpitted port to accept any incoming 
TCP connection. When data transfer begins to occur, the TCP window size is 
set to zero, so no data can be transferred within the session. The 
connection is then held open, and any requests by the remote side to close 
the session are ignored. This means that the attacker must wait for the 
connection to timeout in order to disconnect. This kind of behavior is bad 
news for automated scanning tools (like worms) because they rely on a 
quick turnaround from their potential victims.

just as a request ...

id like to see some demos of some security vulnerabilities that are
constantly listed in security focus alerts @ some of the meetings ... for
one @ the beginning of getting into php id dive into code that was part of
some of these apps to notice how certain things were accomplished and then
for the apps to be listed like this makes me a little nervous ... either
that or a good white paper on secure php coding practices would help ...

i mean can this be taken as a joke:

(keep in mind this has already been fixed in the product) but the patch for
the problem was not easily located to see what was done.  anyone have a link
for these issues?

I set up a client to use Contribute. Admittedly the site is straight
html (no php) but there are no problems with linked stylesheets. All
pages are based on a DreamWeaver template and Contribute will allow you
to choose whether to "lock down" sections of the template or to allow
changes even to template sections.

The client, I should add, is quite happy with Contribute.

That's a great idea Jon.  We could even start today! (ok by Sept. for sure :)

Unfortunately, I've found a lot of securityfocus's postings to be a little far fetched (like the vulnerability I pointed out the other week).

Maybe we should startup a "security corner" to complement the "newbie corner" at our meetings.  Akin to newbie topics, people could bring in security related patches, news and general topics.

Hey folks -

Anyone know of a PHP script/program to manipulate cron entries?  If not, I
may just look at the perl code in webmin for cron.

See you guys tonight at the meeting - the Long Island guy is heading to the

I had written something like this once, but the one here is probably better:

I haven't used it yet but plan to install for a client that I am 
working with.  I had a walkthrough demo by a Macromedia developer at 
Macworld.  Seemed very nice, easy to use.  There were some cool 
features that I didn't know about like being able to make specific 
parts of certain pages editable and prevent the user from screwing up 
other parts.

If the Macromedia of the future is going to be anything like the way 
Macromedia has been developing over the last five years, you're going 
to get locked into using a buggy, unstable application. Any future 
bug-fixes will be released as upgrades you must pay for loaded with new 
buggy features.

Ok, that works, and I'll probably borrow the interface from here:

http://www.mtsdev.com/opensource/phpcrontab.php

as when I click on the submit button, nothing seems to happen.

Thanks,

Tom

First, I believe there is no extra charge for the buggy features. ;)

Second, if your pages are based on a DreamWeaver template then you can
easily lock down aspects of the page(s). In addition, you can set
Contribute to only allow, say, text changes.

Third, the one "quirk" is that Contribute performs its "magic" by using
a very old trick, namely, placing a bunch of files on the webserver to
handle locking issues so that if the client is editing page X and you
try to edit Page X you'll get a message saying that it is being edited
by someone else. These "lock" files tell Contribute what is going on.
This works decently well but, depending on the particular host, it can
be a small problem, e.g., Contribute may have problems FTPing files back
and forth; problems checking on the "lock" files, etc. With one
particular ISP/webserver, I couldn't get Contribute to work at all.

If the Macromedia of the future is going to be anything like the way 
Macromedia has been developing over the last five years, you're going 
to get locked into using a buggy, unstable application. Any future 
bug-fixes will be released as upgrades you must pay for loaded with new 
buggy features.

It may have room for improvement but their stuff is still better then 
anything else that's out there.  Dreamweaver is the best wysiwig and 
Fireworks totally blew away Photoshop as far as creating graphics for 
the web and is still well ahead.

Aren't bugs and fixes/upgrades a symptom of most commercially produced

Pick your poison.  The solution is to hire high paid in house

I wish I could give you details (I think they're using Linux but don't
quote me on that) but the particular ISP was DirectNic.com. They have
some dirt cheap hosting ($30 per year for like 20mb of space...you can
only put up plain HTML...no scripts or stuff like that). When I last
attempted to use Contribute with DirectNic, it didn't work
well...Contribute kept timing out. One of my other clients is on XO.com
and Contribute works nicely.

Yeah this is the BIG problem here ... basically people want high end
graphical CMS stuff but don't want to pay inhouse staff to develop, before
you welcome me to the real world, id like to point out a pretty big security
issue with Contribute ...

As someone pointed out they could not get Contribute to work with an ISP,
after researching some more around for dev notes it seems magic directories
are created with some pretty important info on the server, something which
should have been pointed out during installation but was not ... they make
assumptions ...

http://www.macromedia.com/support/contribute/connections/webserver_contribut
e/webserver_contribute03.html

Im trying to check if there is a Nessus plugin for _contribute directories
but they should ask what ur setup is during installation before doing
anything (IIS vs. Apache) ...

Not sure about that one...since it didn't work we just dropped the
idea...it wasn't so important that we needed to research the problem.

Anyone have any good ideas about a safe and organized way to have these cron

Any thoughts?

There's an easy solution to that one...don't Google "index of _mm" ;)

I do wonder, however, if it's not possible to tinker with Apache
settings, to just drop an "index.html" file in there that redirects
someone to another page.

either that or they should make the .htaccess files for you as it would not

Needless to say, this is risky business.  You could use su/sudo to execute commands as other users, which would let you add/change/delete their cronjobs.  Or, you could su commands as root, which would let you inject cronjobs as other users, but then your webserver is doing stuff as root.  If we're talking Apache, which I'm sure we are :) there's suEXEC, which if setup properly can be pretty safe.  Also, maybe if you're running PHP as CGI, you could play with permissions and so forth like that.  I've also written local daemons that run as root and listen for requests from the webserver to execute a very limited set of commands - this is probably safe, but a pain in the neck to do.

There isn't really any nice way of doing, AFAIK, and I'd see if there's an architectural change possible, to avoid doing it at all.  Maybe just have one cronjob running as root that wakes up on a regular interval and queries a MySQL table or some /flat files/lock files/queue directory/ for what needs to be done?

Yup, we just talked about it here - and that's what we are going to do.

Thanks for the help, and see you in 3 1/2 hours (if I don't get lost). :-)

Needless to say, this is risky business.  You could use su/sudo to execute
commands as other users, which would let you add/change/delete their
cronjobs.  Or, you could su commands as root, which would let you inject
cronjobs as other users, but then your webserver is doing stuff as root.  If
we're talking Apache, which I'm sure we are :) there's suEXEC, which if
setup properly can be pretty safe.  Also, maybe if you're running PHP as
CGI, you could play with permissions and so forth like that.  I've also
written local daemons that run as root and listen for requests from the
webserver to execute a very limited set of commands - this is probably safe,
but a pain in the neck to do.

I know I always take a vulnerability more seriously if I can see an exploit
and/or a very detailed analysis of it. Vague desciptions do nothing for me.

Hello...

I would like to know if PHP and/or MySQL is the answer to my design 
problem. I have been told so, but I am a beginner to both, and need a 
good intro tutorial also.

Here it is: I am designing a website for a store, and want users to 
be able to search the merchandise by various criteria (price, style, 
manufacturer, etc). It's a fishing lure store, so the products will 
be similar - all will feature a photo and descriptive text.

Are PHP and MySQL the solution? I use a Mac G4 running OSX. I'm a 
designer, I know HTML, basic Javascript, and understand programming 
concepts, generally. How can I get started?

much thanks

I personally think so!  PHP is an extremely robust scripting language that I
have seen can easily be tailored for personalization and authentication
needs, which would address your store issues.

I in fact helped to built a "mall" of sorts (a portal leading to multiple
stores with their own personalization solutions), however, not in PHP, but
in TCL as CGI, but I can easily envision that being done in PHP with a mySQL
backend.

I've seen how mySQL is becoming very robust and data-resourceful as well.

I would get a few books on both PHP and mySQL and the people here are on top
of the programming food chain and would be able to answer anything
whatsoever you could possibly imagine, so you picked the right group!

Good luck!

I highly recommend using oscommerce for your store.  There's a great
community behind it and it does a fantastic job for ecommerce stores.  Best
of all, it's a free solution.

http://www.oscommerce.com/

Here's an example of one of my client's sites using it (getting about 15000
visits a month and handling beutifully) :

Good luck!!

I agree with Phil 100%!  PHP-MySQL is a perfect solution for this project.  Its a perfect platform for developing small projects like this that have a potential to grow into something large.  If you implement it right, its a very scalable solution.  I have personally built 2 or 3 sites similar in nature.

As far as advice, I would reccomend starting out by focusing on an Object Oriented approach, since PHP 5 will bring in many enahncements in that area and code maintainence will be made easier in the future.  Dont waste too much money on books though, you can usually find everything you need online via Google.

Good luck and enjoy :)

Hey folks,

Tonight is the 6th LIPHP meeting in Hauppauge - location and directions are
here:

http://www.liphp.org

Tonight's topic will be an review/discussion of the new Zend IDE, which is
currently in Beta now.  You can also download your own copy of the  Zend
Studio at:

http://www.zend.com/store/products/zend-studio-beta.php

In addition, we will be giving away a copy of the 5th edition of "Core PHP
Programming" by Atkinson and Suraski, which covers PHP5.  Plus, thanks to
the folks at NYPHP, we have 3 additional PHP books to give away.  The
general attendance at our meetings is always under 20 - so your odds of
walking away with some free stuff are pretty good (much better than lotto!)!


Of course, the Krispy Kremes will be plentiful (its not like you guys come
to see me)!

If you are looking for a book you can start with "PHP & MySQL for Dummies".
In the book, the author builds a web site of the type you describe you need.
Also, it includes a pretty good introduction to MySQL and PHP. In addition,
it comes with copies of php, mysql and apache and the installation is pretty
easy, especially on windows. I installed it on Windows 95 and 98 and it was
a breeze.

Here's my newbie preachment:

Learn from my newbie mistakes! I was in much the same boat when I decided
to learn PHP/MySQL by developing an ambitious scheduling and record
keeping system for ourselves, the court interpreters in the federal court
downtown.

* The urge to just do it is powerful, but time spent reading, planning
your design, and playing with and testing techniques, is well invested. (I
did my app in an improvisatory, ad hoc way that makes me marvel that it
works as well as it does.)

* While you might not do full-blown Test Driven Development, where you
literally write tests for your code before you write the code itself, you
should use an approach that is similar in spirit and strategy. Test the
hell out of little pieces and make them prove themselves under every
scenario you can think of.
(http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/reiersol20030126.php3)

* If some piece of code looks like it's getting too complicated, it
probably is too complicated. Step back and rethink.

* Consider using a templating system like Smarty. When HTML and PHP are
blended together indiscriminately, it is torture to read and maintain.
Torture! (http://smarty.php.net/)

* Think about security from Day One, not as an afterthought.

* Consider using classes and objects, like somebody just said. There are
different schools on this, but one nice thing about OOP is that the moment
you begin to think about a name for your classes, you are thinking about
what they are supposed to do and where they fit in with the rest of the
picture -- it automatically encourages you to think.

* Be pretty anal about following your own variable, class and method
naming conventions consistently. For example, will it be this_style or
thisStyle?

* Think about your database schema carefully before you commit to it, then
try to avoid the promiscuous hard-coding of things like table and column
names to the extent possible, so it doesn't cost hours of acute pain when
someone decides that a table needs to be altered. This will also make it
easier to re-use your code on future projects.

* Consider using version control, like CVS. Yes it's yet another tool to
learn, and it can drive you insane when you don't understand it, but
someday you will be grateful for it.(http://cvshome.org/)

* Comment abundantly

* Have fun!

Are there slides from last night?  I bet it was an excellent talk.

Message-ID: <007d01c36ca9$f09d9d80$6700a8c0@thinkpad>

i wanted to ask a quick question ...

does anyone here use an ids (like snort/dragon/etc) to lock down their web
apps + track anomalies?

it does not seem like a common scenerio but after writing a bunch of
signatures based on mysql error codes it seems like there are no papers on
it or any advise on the approach ...

a typical example would be as such tracking down bad login attempts over
time or bad variable string formatting or submission of a selection not in a
preformed array, etc.

i dont know if it make sense to go through all the trouble but just wanted
to see if anyone here already does this approach (w/
iptables/netfilter/etc).

I second that!

OSCommerce is excellent, the community is very helpful and extremely fond of
newbies, the code is easy to modify and expand and is well maintained. Did I
mention it's easy to setup? Well, it is.

Plus, if you intend to cater to an international public, OSCommerce cannot
be beat, with the multi-language support.

Not here.  I've used the packages for the common case, general network integrity, but not specific to the web application.  Strictly log analysis and alerts in the app logic for that.

There was an apache mod posted around these parts that did request verification, although I can't put my finger on it now.  Having an IDS be so deeply knowledgeable about an app, however, may be tricky and costly (in regards to performance and maintenance).

As I recall, nobody on the list had tried it yet, but it might do what 
you want.

Here's my newbie preachment:

Learn from my newbie mistakes! I was in much the same boat when I
decided
to learn PHP/MySQL by developing an ambitious scheduling and record
keeping system for ourselves, the court interpreters in the federal
court
downtown.

* The urge to just do it is powerful, but time spent reading, planning
your design, and playing with and testing techniques, is well invested.
(I
did my app in an improvisatory, ad hoc way that makes me marvel that it
works as well as it does.)

* While you might not do full-blown Test Driven Development, where you
literally write tests for your code before you write the code itself,
you
should use an approach that is similar in spirit and strategy. Test the
hell out of little pieces and make them prove themselves under every
scenario you can think of.
(http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/reiersol20030126.php3)

* If some piece of code looks like it's getting too complicated, it
probably is too complicated. Step back and rethink.

* Consider using a templating system like Smarty. When HTML and PHP are
blended together indiscriminately, it is torture to read and maintain.
Torture! (http://smarty.php.net/)

* Think about security from Day One, not as an afterthought.

* Consider using classes and objects, like somebody just said. There are
different schools on this, but one nice thing about OOP is that the
moment
you begin to think about a name for your classes, you are thinking about
what they are supposed to do and where they fit in with the rest of the
picture -- it automatically encourages you to think.

* Be pretty anal about following your own variable, class and method
naming conventions consistently. For example, will it be this_style or
thisStyle?

* Think about your database schema carefully before you commit to it,
then
try to avoid the promiscuous hard-coding of things like table and column
names to the extent possible, so it doesn't cost hours of acute pain
when
someone decides that a table needs to be altered. This will also make it
easier to re-use your code on future projects.

* Consider using version control, like CVS. Yes it's yet another tool to
learn, and it can drive you insane when you don't understand it, but
someday you will be grateful for it.(http://cvshome.org/)

* Comment abundantly

* Have fun!

I am performing 2 mysql_query statements in one program and the second doesn't return a

Are you suppose to reconnect to the database with each mysql query?

I never have to reconnect after each query, however, you might want to check in your program if you have done this statement prematurely:

mysql_free_result($query)

I had that statement prematurely and it caused db reconnection issues as well.

No, you can definitely use the same db connection for as many queries as 
you like.

Take a look at the mysql_error() function, you could use it to see what 
is going wrong if you don't get a result from mysql_query().

A line of code says this:
   if (!(${$foo})) do something if the value is empty

If $foo="bar" and $bar="something" then will ${$foo} evaluate to 
"something"--which I assume is the purpose of the curly brackets?  But it 
doesn't seem to work when the value is empty, though I would swear it used 
to.  or maybe there is something with an empty value evaluating true 
anyway, so I need to use =="" or ==="", or =='' or ==='' (single quotation 
marks)?  Is this tricky, or am I just ignorant?

Most definitely.

You could use =="" -- if ( ${$foo}=="" ) do something -- which is 
testing for an empty string instead of boolean false, which is what your 
sample is doing. If $bar=0 then the code you have would work.

the code that is triggering the warning is:

$row = mysql_fetch_array($result) or trigger_error("MySQL error nr
".mysql_errno().": ".mysql_error());

It is triggering the warning:
"Warning: Supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in
c:\program files\apache\htdocs\books\confirm.php on line 16

Notice: MySQL error nr 0: in c:\program
files\apache\htdocs\books\confirm.php on line 16"

The mysql_query function actually gives no warnings or errors. Sorry about
the confusion.

What?  Your code works as I expected it to.  Perhaps you have different 
expectations.

Code:
   $foo="bar";
   $bar="";
   if (!(${$foo})) echo 'something if the value is empty';

Results:
   something if the value is empty

But, if I set
   $bar="blah"; 
then no output is generated, just as the code requests.

In english, the code says if the variable variable "foo" -- which refers
in this case to the value of the real variable "bar" -- is empty, equals 
0 or equals false, then print the message out.

Is that what you thought it means?

By the way, the curleys aren't needed in this context, nor are the inner 
set of parentheses.  Personally, for clarity, I'd write it like this:

   $foo = 'bar';
   $bar = '';
   if (!$$foo) {
       echo 'something if the value is empty';
   }

Check the syntax of your query.  Usually when I see this it is because I don't have a value in quotes that needs to be or I am missing something.  It is saying that the nothing was returned by the query not that no results were found.  I hope that makes sense.

I'd like to make a small note regarding this topic. I think it's much more
readable (and correct) to use the empty() function, especially if that is what
you are wanting to check.

Consider this:

<?
$foo = 'bar';
$bar = 0;

if (!$$foo)
{
     echo '<p>$bar is empty</p>';
}
?>

That echo statement isn't exactly telling the whole truth, is it? $bar isn't
empty; it is the integer 0. Conditional statements are evaluated as boolean,
and 0 evaluates to false.

Consider this as an alternative:

<?
$foo = 'bar';
$bar = 0;

if (empty($$foo))
{
     echo '<p>$bar is empty</p>';
}
?>

To me, it is much easier to read, and it might be more valid, depending on
whether you are really wanting to test whether something is empty and not
whether it is false.

Hope that helps.

Chris

Yeah.  I was thinking of throwing that in in the mix of my explanation, 
but decided not to, since it might cloud the matter.

But, of course, folks must keep in mind that empty() returns true under 
all of the following circumstances:
    $bar = '';
    $bar = null;
    $bar = 0;
    $bar = false;
    or if $bar is not set at all

right, isn't !$$foo checking to see if whether the var is defined or
not? or if it's been explicitly set to untrue, as in $foo = false

in this case, it works out that it has been set, to 0 (zero), which is
not "empty" nor is it "false"

Brian,

The LIPHP Oracle Guru (Matt Surico) is currently on vacation, but he did a
demonstration with Oracle9i and PHP a few months back, so the two "do" work
together.  From what I remember, he used the oci8 functions (even though it
is 9i), not the ora functions.

Sorry I can't be more help.

Wait, I'm confused.  If a variable is set to 0, then it is also false as
well, am I right??

$foo = 'bar';
$bar = 0;

then !${$foo} would be true only if $bar is set to what can be considered
false, which can be 0.  If $bar were not set or set to something other than
0 then the statement itself would throw an error because it is not a boolean
check.

Hmm.. conundrum.. I defer this to higher brains than mine..

Tom,
thanks. That does help to know that it _does_ work. I am using the oci
functions, not ora.
I think I may need to recompile php, and maybe apache, too? still
researching.

any additional insight anyone has would be appreciated.

Or if you happen to have Matt's cell #. He did take his phone with him,
didn't he? :)

You're right. I think my comments were very misleading, after reading them over
again.

I prefer empty() for readability. The fact that it evaluates as false for the
integer 0 is a bit confusing, I agree.

My client is using Putty to log into the server (set for SSH2 only,

he uses his own user name and password. After entering his user name and

Is it possible that your client rejected the hostname key the first time 
s/he ever connected to this server?  It's possible that Putty won't connect 
again if you chose no to begin with.

Log is as yourself, then run 'su - clientname', supply the password,
and see if you get any errors.

Phil,

Pardon my ignorance on this matter, but... What does that mean? I'll tell
you how it's done in OSCommerce, you tell me if it qualifies as "human
translation" multilingual management. I believe it does but I want to make
sure I understand the term...

I had once started on a translation project in OSCommerce, but could not
finish because other projects took precedence and the money for it dried
out. The multilingual support on OSCommerce is implemented as follows:

- Most of the files (probably all of them by now) that have something that
can be viewed by a customer includes
./includes/languages/<user-currently-selected-language>/<page-used>. So, for
the main engine's page named account_history.php and with german selected as
the language, the include looks like this:

./includes/languages/german/account_history.php

The actual call is:

$include_file = DIR_WS_LANGUAGES . $language . '/' .
FILENAME_ACCOUNT_HISTORY;

- In the included file, there are defines like this:

define('TEXT_NO_PURCHASES', 'You have not yet made any purchases...');

- In the account_history.php page, you simply echo the definition, like so:

<? echo TEXT_NO_PURCHASES; ?>

- To add a language you need to copy the English.php file and the english
directory inside includes/languages and change the strings.  Also, you need
to add an option to the administration area to determine your new language
as one of the options, but that is easy as pie.

So, does it qualify?

Cheers,
Mauricio

Sounds like it, but what about customary phrases your site has that aren't
found in the included files? How are those implemented and subsequently
translated?

It's worth adding something about writing secure php code, about

_affordable_ scalability - i.e. anyone can scale with a million dollar
budget, but doing it on the cheap), and about accelerators/caches...
maybe also about the basics of Apache configuration, since almost all

oops.. I may also need to retract my last statement on this matter...

I started to investigate and was a bit surprised at the results.

I will post later, I get to go to the dentist now, instead.
Fun...


however, my $0.02 on this is limit the occassions where you have mixed
variable types.
if it's boolean, use a strict boolean test
    and stick to using either true/false or 0/1; don't mix up true/0 or
1/false
use strict string checking for strings

The way they chose to do was to define them originally as the English
version. So if it's not defined in the translation it showed up in English.

I'm using the past tense because I worked on a Release Candidate, prior to
version 2.2, so they might have changed that.

Okay folks, here's the scoop. Based on some extensive testing at
http://chxo.com/scripts/emptytest.php

To test for an empty string, you have to test that it is both empty AND 
a string.

if ( is_string($$foo) && empty($$foo) ) do empty string stuff here

Otherwise $$foo could be 0 or not set at all. I humbly take back any 
misinfo I spread earlier, Michael.

Do that the other way around.  Always do an empty() check first, just in
case the variable isn't set at all.  This prevents PHP from generating an
"undefined variable" Notice error.

Do be aware that...

   $bar = 0;    // is_string() will be false, empty() will be true
   $bar = '0';  // is_string() will be true,  empty() will be true

$var == '' can be the appropriate test in some circumstances.

Thanks Dan, I wasn't checking whether it was set or not.
And it seems like empty() is just misleading all around.

So what we really want, to test for an empty string -- I'm going to drop 
this $$foo business now, it's misleading -- is the following:

// check whether $foo is an empty string...
if ( isset($foo) ) {
    if ( is_string($foo) && $foo=='' ) do stuff here
    }

Wow. I updated http://chxo.com/scripts/emptytest.php to reflect this.

The is_string() test is unnecessary.  You can just do $foo === ''.

Back to the earlier stage of this discussion, if you're not concerned
about the 0, null or false, you can do this whole thing in one step with
an empty() test.

Again, your style is confusing.  Your bracket is under the second if, even
though it's closing the first if.  Let alone, I (and most style guides)
dislike single line if statements.

I just learned something interesting while confirming stuff:

    $bar = 0;
    if ($bar == '') {
        echo '<br />bar equals empty';
    }

This comparison will evaluate to true, so the message will be printed.

Weird,

Which was really the whole point of this exercise -- but you dropped 
another hint there with the strict comparison operator (===).
In "standard" style this time:

    if ( isset($foo) ) {
        if ( $foo==='' ) {
            print "foo is an empty string.";
        }
    }

And that's all we really needed: a fine lesson in strict vs loose 
comparison.

I had to run a quick test myself (not that I doubted anyone :)

quote " When one argument to a comparison operator is a number, the 
other argument is cast to a number."

so,

$foo = '';
$bar = (int) $foo;
echo $bar;  // displays zero

I'm 100% with this, Brian.  While loose-typing can be very handy (when used explicitly), I've found it's more trouble when you don't pay attention to it.  I use strict type equality checking (===) *always* and will only do a loose check (==) when I need to for a specific reason.  I've been burned too much by forgetting all the sublties covered in this thread.

It's also a performance boost.  empty() is quite an expensive operation; use isset() where possible, simple boolean checks, ie if( $var ),  and casting.  Explicit casting is fantastic; implicit casts can make your heart jump, which is why:

$bar = 0;
if ($bar == '') {
   echo '<br />bar equals empty';
}

makes output, and using  if( $bar === '' )   wouldn't.

Southwell, right on - this is certainly one for the fundamentals.

These types of links (and not to mention all the great info today) is why we need a list person to collect and compile list content for nyphp.org  :)

The oracle client for 8i will work against 9i IIRC - but this is the Oracle client itself, not the client libraries.  You'll almost certainly need to recompile PHP, and thusly Apache if it's not a DSO.

And Tom, how about Matt gives a PHP with Oracle presentation over this way, when he gets back from vacation?  :)

This is great... between this and Chris' examples I think I'm off the
hook from my pre-dentist post that I would look into this further.

thanks all :)

no cavities, woo hoo
If anyone needs a dentist, I really like this guy. Email me off list.

I have been bitten so many times by this that I 
prefer this in my code. I find that its more 
explicit.

$bar = 0;
if ( strlen ($bar) == 0 ) {
   echo '<br />bar equals empty or not set';
} else {
	echo '<br />bar not empty';
}

Output: '<br />bar not empty'

#$bar = 0;
if ( strlen ($bar) == 0 ) {
   echo '<br />bar equals empty or not set';
} else {
	echo '<br />bar not empty';
}

Output: '<br />bar equals empty or not set'

Cheers

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL table optimization
Message-ID: <002301c36d6f$488cf2a0$6401a8c0@EZDSDELL>

I have a particular table that has a very large number of deleted
records (and approx. 500 records are deleted and added each day). The
MySQL docs note that running an "Optimize" statement will clean up this
potentially fractured file. However, I believe I had read somewhere (of
course...don't ask me where "somewhere" is...I don't remember) that
there is the potential that the table itself can become corrupted after
running optimize. Is this true? And if it is true, how can I detect, via
code, that a table has become hosed?

You could also create your own:

your day to day "Life As A Coder" rants.
Check out the new http://www.typepad.com site, I think it's the best

Pretty much rocks.

There was a bug that "OPTIMIZE of locked and modified MyISAM table,
reported table corruption" before 3.23.53.

I run maintenance crons that include this optimization on fairly big
tables, with no issues reported so far.

You can check table status by running "analyze table <tablename>", check
"Msg_type" and "Msg_text" in your result set.

	Pricing methodologies, business practices and copyright
Message-ID: <004701c36d7c$ed597120$0300a8c0@dads>

Greetings...

I would like to start a discussion of pricing and protecting one's work. This would not apply to employees but rather free lance/independent work.

I believe that could be subject to many differing ideas but I'm sure that we will all benefit. To start the discussion, please advise regarding any of the following:

Pricing methodologies...
    hourly ... how to set rate
    perpage ... how to reconcile complexity
    royalty ... calculated as % of sale or other metric for right to use software
    value to customer's business
    other???

Protection ...
    Who will own  the software when it is complete. 
    Copyright ... are rights retained or is non-exclusive license given to customer.
     Is software encripted with product like Zend offers or do customers demand source.
     If source is provided, how can author protect interest when licensing software?
    

Trade groups ...
    Many trade groups have business standards... Is anyone aware of any group that has standards for either PHP or web programming?

Would this be a good start for NYPHP business guidelines codification that could enhance our businesses. 

John

Message-ID: <NFBBJNKBNKCIKGKJIFPJAEKAGJAA.sklar@sklar.com>

When I do consulting, I generally bill based on the time I spend on a
project. (Or I agree on a fixed fee with the client after estimating the
time the project will take.) One motivation for this is to emphasize that
what the client is paying for is my time and attention. Software I write or
recommendations I make for them are obviously a byproduct of that time and
attention, but what they are buying (well, renting, really) is me.

The language in the consulting agreement that I use (and in my professional
liability insurance) also reflects this. Except in extraordinary cases, if
something goes wrong and money has to be refunded (which has never happened
to me) the client is entitled to a refund of whatever they paid me, not
another amount calculated on the potential value of whatever software was to
have been developed, etc.

Within this framework, you have plenty of room to adjust fees based on
project complexity, how much available time you have, how badly the client
needs your services, what kind of business the client is (e.g. perhaps you
want to discount your rate for a non-profit whose mission you agree with),
and so forth.

As for copyright, I like to retain ownership of code and give the client a
perpetual, sublicenseable, whatever-they-want-to-do-with-it license. This is
primarily so I can re-use the code on other projects. Once you've spent some
time developing an web-based data maintenance interface, it saves everyone
time and money to be able to re-use it on future projects. If part of an
assignment involves developing something for a client that they want to own
and I can't re-use (because it's a core competitive advantage for them, they
want to keep it secret, or whatever), I try to adjust my fees to compensate
for that restriction.

If a potential client has a project in an area that I think is
extra-interesting, or I want to gain more experience in, then sometimes that
extra draw of a project is worth discounting my rate.

In general, I try to be as flexible as possible for a client. They pay me
some money to have my attention and skills focused on the problems they need
to solve. I advise them on how best to use my attention and skills, but
ultimately, the decision on how to deploy me is up to them and I try to
present a fee structure that reflects that decision.

Hope this helps,
David

So, even though php was originally compiled to use 8i, I need to
recompile it to work with 9i?

I need oracle 9i client libraries, then?

I'm not the dba on this project, and not overly familiar with Oracle
(why should I be, when mysql is so great), but I need to be able to at
least speak (pseudo-)intelligently with him.

Thanks,

Brian

Hi all,

I've been trying to learn CVS. My primary OS is windows and I'm having
trouble finding a good and easy to use CVS client for windows. I downloaded
WinCVS and smartCVS. However, WinCVS is confusing as hell and smartCVS is
giving errors (still waiting for a response from support at smartcvs.com).

Does anyone have a recommendation?

Thanks,

Thanks! What would be the msg type/text I would look for? Couldn't find
a list after some Googling and, quite honestly, it's not real obvious
from errmsg.txt. However, the only things that seemed "remotely"
possible in errmsg.txt are the following:

"Table '%-.64s' is marked as crashed and should be repaired",
"Table '%-.64s' is marked as crashed and last (automatic?) repair
failed",

There was a bug that "OPTIMIZE of locked and modified MyISAM table,
reported table corruption" before 3.23.53.

I run maintenance crons that include this optimization on fairly big
tables, with no issues reported so far.

You can check table status by running "analyze table <tablename>", check
"Msg_type" and "Msg_text" in your result set.

I have a particular table that has a very large number of deleted

potentially fractured file. However, I believe I had read somewhere (of
course...don't ask me where "somewhere" is...I don't remember) that
there is the potential that the table itself can become corrupted after
running optimize. Is this true? And if it is true, how can I detect, via
code, that a table has become hosed?

As Carlos points out, this used to be a problem.  On a 4.0.13 database, we delete/insert about 5000+ three times a day without issue.  The general progression we use:

-- LOCK TABLES as write (optional, but can't hurt if you can afford it)
-- DELETE QUICK the old rows
-- INSERT the new rows
-- ANALYZE, OPTIMIZE, FLUSH the table

Some of that is probably overkill, but it can't hurt, especially if you can afford the slight performance penalty.  With over 350,000 records in the table, we've had no problems doing this type of thing many times a day.

Don't quote me, but I think so.  Oracle's own clients will work, but from what I've heard 3rd party applications will need to be linked against the new libs.

Like I say, I may be wrong, so pseudo-intelligently is a good call :)

ok, well, we installed php-4.3.3 and it works now...

We didn't change anything with the oracle8 client or libraries on the
machine, at least that I know of. The DBA said that 9 is backwards
compatible with 8.

however, post-install I also noticed I had another location where the db
host was still looking to the wrong place. (The code is all hacked up. I
know, it should all be in one common place).

I guess it's possible that the re-install wasn't completely necessary,
but now I'll never know. oh well.. at least it works now. PHP needed to
be upgraded from 4.2 anyhow.


I did make 1 interesting discovery in all of this, but it's not related
to Oracle. I didn't know that GD was bundled into php as of 4.3.
I couldn't get it to install properly with it on Solaris 5.7 and I
didn't feel like taking the time to investigate it further.
If anyone has anything to say about this, probably best to put it into a
new thread.

Hans,

I'm using MySQL 3.23.56 (the ver with RH 7.3). Based on Carlos' message,
the known "bug" shouldn't be in this version.

The insert is done during the course of the day - not all at once - so I
can skip that step. This gives me a GREAT outline of steps (THANKS!!!).
I'll share some code once it's ready.

Jeff

I'm (tenuously) responsibile for looking at php in my company and thought it
isn't really approved for use yet, I was wondering if people could share any
light on this "vulnerability". It's been discussed before, but I really need
to know if this is something that is a threat: ie, could an external attacker
get apache to dump logins and passwords to whatever place, or to get it to
serve items not intended to be available?

PHP DLOpen Arbitrary Web Server Process Memory Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 8405
Remote: No
Date Published: Aug 13 2003 12:00A
Relevant URL: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/8405
Summary:
PHP is the Personal Home Page web application development suite.  It is
available for the Unix, Linux, and Microsoft platforms.

A problem has been reported in the dlopen function of PHP when used with
the Apache web server.  Because of this, an attacker may be able to gain
unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information.

The problem is in the ability to access the memory of the calling process.
 When a PHP script is executed by an Apache process, it is possible to dump
the contents of the Apache process memory to a text file.  This could be
used by an attacker to gain access to potentially sensitive information
which could include authentication credentials.  The function may also
permit other attacks, such as allowing an attacker to deliver different
content other than what the server is configured to serve.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] e-commerce application design
Message-ID: <3F4F7B53.1040101@nyc.yamaha.com>

Hi all,
I apologise if these questions are too broad in scope, but I'm working 
on redesigning a medium-sized e-commerce web application written in PHP 
with a Postgres database. I've already decided on the frame work 
(MVC-type model based on the Phrame project using smarty for the view, 
objects for my business model and a php file as the controller), but 
there are a lot of other pieces I'm still considering and the same 
question keeps coming up.. "Is this just overkill or will it help with 
maintainability, reusability, etc.?"

Some of these questions are as follows:
1. I'll be using Pear's DB abstraction layer, but am still wondering 
about a database class to encapsulate my sql, querying the db, and data 
retrieval.  I've seen libraries (like DB_DataObject) which create a 
class for each table (with that table's columns as its class attributes) 
that extend a base class which has functionality for building sql for 
simple selects updates and deletes. I like this idea, but it seems to 
get pretty squarely when it comes to joins and more complex queries. I'm 
wondering if any of you have had a good experience with DB_DataObject or 
similar libraries. My alternative is to have hard-coded sql and database 
calls within each script, which seems like a poor choice.

2. I've also seen "form" classes to handle form elements and data 
validation for all html forms (think oohforms, and others). This is a 
little bit more difficult to implement when using Smarty templates, but 
still possible. However, with only about 10-20 forms on the entire site, 
it seems like it's potential overkill. Does the group have any opinions 
about the best way to handle forms?

3. Lastly is a question that's specific to my frame work (the MVC 
model). The Phrame project includes a huge array used to map the user's 
request to an action. Although this provides a loose coupling between 
requests and actions, which would be good for extensibility, it seems 
like a pain to have to build and maintain this array. Alternatively, I 
could just assume a 1-to-1 relationship between requests and actions. Do 
any PHP/MVC gurus have an opinion about this?


Also, if anyone has any general tips for designing profesional-grade web 
applications that they'd like to share, please do so.

-Rob

I've looked through the list archives, and didn't see a close enough issue
to what I'm experiencing.

So, I've got this PHP function that sends a multipart email.  For a long
while I was having problems sending it to AOL (of course) and found that
using "\r\n" in the 4th argument caused it to choke and now I only use "\r".
But now one of my testers is reporting that her Outlook Express is showing
all the header and html code.. while my Outlook Express is seeing it just
fine.  I've had another OE user look at it and it looks good there, too.  It
also looks fine on Entourage (Mac), Netscape 7.1 (XP) (but not 7.0).

I feel like I'm just hacking.  Is there some help out there?

Here's a link to the resulting email file:

It looks like you're purposefully setting a second boundary
"=inner_boundary"

I've never tried or seen this, so I'm not sure if it's actually allowed.

But, I also don't think it's 100% necessary.

Did you try it just using "=this_is_the_boundary"

I believe your frustration with MIME multipart emails is widely shared.
I have something that I use, although I know it has certain (limited)
flaws. I finally decided that I just didn't care if Lotus Notes users
got the email exactly as it was intended.

Quite honestly, a LOT of email I get from various senders using various
email clients (including AOL and Outlook) as well as a lot of spam that
I get comes through all eff'ed up in one way or another. (I use only a
webmail client, but that should be a moot point).
Maybe this fact also helped me to come to ease with the fact that I
could never get 100% success rates with my own php email scripts.

Hi Stephen:

Without looking at your code, please note, this subject has been covered 
many times on the php.general mailing list.  See groups.google.com for the 
archive.  Also, there are several classes out there, including some in 
PEAR, I believe, that handle this stuff for you already.

A couple of points... for one, according to the RFCs, all line-endings should be \r\n 

And, the general form is a bit off; while the top level header's Content-type is correct, the empty Status: header field might throw some clients off.  And, if I remember correctly, ending boundaries need an trailing '--'.  But, as Dan said, PEAR and phpclasses.org have tons of fairly complete classes for this type of thing.

No.  dlopen() is a powerful feature of the language, and with power comes ability.  When you load an extension into Apache/PHP, you would hope it could read the memory of that process; otherwise, it'd be pretty useless.

It's a real shame that securityfocus blindly registers this as a vulnerability.  I've emailed them twice, questioning who it was that actually submitted this, and whether they reviewed this as a true security hole.  I haven't heard from them yet.  Furthermore, if you dig on the internet for the author's name (who, I might add, doesn't supply any valid contact information) it becomes quite clear that it's some kid who just wanted to get their name on securityfocus.com.

I'd continue to be wary of securityfocus.com's claims, as this type of behavior isn't an isolated incident.

In my opinion... yes  :)

I've never used DB_DataObject itself, but have played at writting similar structures on my own, and have seen code based heavily on this type of model.  For one, there's a great deal of overhead involved for all this abstraction.  Secondly, as you mention, things begin to fall apart with complex queries, joins, etc. and you will end up making many hacks to get things to work.  Thus, there's a good chance you'll end up with hackish code, that's slow.  If you're using PostgreSQL, take advantage of one of the better ideas in abstraction modeling since a bread slicing machine; stored procedures and views.

Abstraction with forms, and input from browsers in general, can be a good thing, although again being careful not to go too far.  For larger projects I use a "unified request processor" which is a single page, or set of included pages, that validates and aggregates input before handing it off to the real logic of the application.  As for rendering the form's HTML itself, PHP is a templating engine :)

Of all the places for abstraction, I've had the best luck adding it to "where the rubber meets the road."  Once you can easily manage the requests that come in, and either reject or cleanse them, your business logic becomes much simpler and abstracted, since there's isn't the need for pedantic validation, security, etc.

http://phrame.sourceforge.net/docs/guide/controller.php is maybe a little heavier than I've done a similer model, but fairly close IMHO.

All I can say is there's never a free lunch.  Abstracting things out tremendously may initially appear to reduce work and increase flexibility, but in the end there will always be workarounds needed.  And, if thing's are too far out, you'll end up with more pain than gain.  Somewhere in the code, the actual work has to happen and I haven't found that wrapping it in an onion of abstraction layers is that beneficial.

Hey Nasir,

Check out TortoiseCVS (http://www.tortoisecvs.org/), it's so easy to use and
well thought.

I have this mysterious file on my C:/ drive, qpmd8376.bin - contains a rather large integer value and nothing more.  I read up somewhere that .bin files are normally associated with email clients like Outlook and Outlook Express (I have Outlook Express).  Am I correct in assuming so, else, what the heck is this thing?

Thanx
