Happy new year, all...

My new yea started with WinXP (home) crashing hard. I had to reinstall Win
XP, and of course, now it's there, and I can see all of my documents, but
I can't get to any of them. I need someone who can either a) help me
migrate all my programs etc over to the new version, or b) help me fix the
old version. (the file that's corrupt is called "intoskrnl.exe)

I'll pay-  tell me your hourly rate, and if you can come over either
Wednesday night or anytime on Thursday, I'll hire you. I'm in serious need
of help here...

Thanks - peter at shankman.com

I follow an architectural forum and the situation there is even worse. They 
cannot get thir pronters & plotters to function. The best advice is to go out 
and buy Win 2000 Pro and download  XP and install Win 2000.

I say amen to that.

I personally haven't .. But I'd suggest going if you are in the tech
industry .. Even just at the chance of meeting a future biz client or
supplier.. Network yourself .. So to speak.. 
Esp. in NYC.. Ya know?

They're enjoyable. The last one was kind of under-represented (holiday
season and all), but the one before that drew about 25 people. It's a
fun opportunity to sit around, drink, and chat with technical people.

It's pretty low-key.

This is in reference to the standard memory limit for server PHP scripts,
which is 8MB.

My question is...
is there any function to query available free space in the memory pool?

I have searched through www.php.net and found nothing useful.

Hi,

There are two simple ways to have more free memory for your scripts :

1- You can increase memory limit from 8 Mb to any amount in php.ini file.
2- You can use 'unset()' function to unset unused variables right after you use them.

I've been working on a log parser to parse almost 1Gb web server logfile everyday. Using 'unset()'
helped me a lot.

Depending on what you are on .. It's based on when you configure make /
make install the software.. However It might be mod in my.ini of php.ini

Let me know if that helps (or doesn't)

err, that should only be php 3 specific, php4's reference counting mechanism releases all
variables the second they are no longer referenced in the script.

In this I'm wondering why you need more of a memory path for php..
I.e... What's the purpose.. Maybe some streamlining of the programs
you're using could be in order???

But in case it was missed ... 

Change the variable in php.ini

And restart php (or apache if it's complied into it)

New York PHP will be at LinuxWorld Expo 2003, January 21-24, and we need your
help! (http://linuxworldexpo.com)

Apparently, the .Org Pavilion booths were going like Krispy Kremes, and NYPHP
wasn't able to reserve one in time.  However, thanks to the due diligence of
Ron Guerin and NYLUG, we will be able to have a part in a booth.

If you?re able to help in any capacity (staff the booth, help setup/teardown,
generate NYPHP mementos, like buttons, pens, stickers or some other creative
items) it would be greatly appreciated by all groups involved, and of course
NYPHP.  And, please spread the word to others who may be interested also.

Please contact me (hans at nyphp.org) ASAP, since scheduling issues still need
to be addressed.

Thank You,

But how would they become unreferenced without unset()ing them?

Maybe getrusage() would be handy, and I've attached a cheesy example I've
used to quickly profile scripts, and the posix_* functions look good, too. 
Plus, you could always run the UNIX commands and parse the output for mem
usage, what's free, etc on a system wide basis.

Although the information everyone has replied with is useful I think he 
is looking for a way to check available memory in a script. 
Unfortunately I don't know of one, I am relatively new to PHP.

reference counting, that's how it works. :-)  once you no longer reference
a variable in your script it is destroyed.  Same applies for resources, like
filehandles. One they are no longer used, the files are closed.

http://www.zend.com/zend/art/ref-count.php

Now of course if you keep a lot of variables in one scope, then you should 
explicitly free them, but chances are, if you're code is good, it should be modularized.
If you really do need to deref a variable, the best way is by:

$var = NULL;

Hi,

I've been trying to find the correct code to show memory usage and 'unset' feature. I was using
Php cli version 4.1 and there was some sort of gc problem I guess. Here is a sample code, it
basically reads a file and once in a  5000 lines it prints usage status. You'll observe that
memory amount dedicated to script is increasing in time. If you comment 'unset()' functions in the
code below, memory consumption speed will going to increase. I'm using 300 Mb of access.log file
so you can observe memory increase after a while. I've checked same code on php cli 4.3 and there
seems to be a fixed but memory dedicated to the script is still increasing after some time. 

$fp = fopen("access.log", "r");
while ($row = fgets($fp, 10000)) :
	$text = $text.$row;
	$i++;
	if ($i > 5000) {
		print_r(getrusage());
		unset($text);
		$text = $row;
		unset($i);
		$i = 0;
		}
	unset($row);
endwhile;

Hi,

I'm sorry, I forgot the ps command to observe memory from the system. I'm actually using this
command to observe memory allocation for my script instead of php getrusage calls.

# ps -v -t pts/1


PS : my script runs on tty 'pts/1', so please set your terminal number over there.

Happy New Year all,

Is it possible to share this information about Windows XP home edition? I
also had this erratic crash in XP that locked up all my previous files from
my old user account. Any help or links would be much appreciated.

Thanks and have a great day,

I have $REQUEST_URI that will take two values:

"/event/login.php"

and

"/event/register.php"

What I need to do is so simple it's brainless!!! I need to look into $REQUEST_URI and find if it contains "register.php".  I tried this and it completely failed, the results were wrong every time:

if (strpos($REQUEST_URI, "register.php") !== 0) { // you're in login.php }

I don't know why I can't get this other than weekend stupidity, can someone help?

Thanx
Phil

Hey Phil, your message broke up a bit, so can't quite make out your code,
but I use this function to do what you're trying:

	function CheckURL($page_name)
	{
		if(strpos($GLOBALS["SCRIPT_NAME"], $page_name ) == false)
		{
			return false;
		}
		else
		{
			return true;
		}
	}

I'm not sure how this function is as far as security goes, and would be
curious if anyone can tell me...

Thanks,
C

Two possible problems:

-- The if() statement isn't doing the proper comparison.

if( strpos($REQUEST_URI,'register.php') === FALSE ) {
   echo 'Then by default we assume to have login.php!';
}

-- Check that $REQUEST_URI does in fact contain what you expect with a
trigger_error() or echo call.

Does:  $text .= $row;   make any difference?

Does this act any different as far as memory usage (or speed):

$fp = fopen("access.log", "r");
$i = 0;
$text = NULL;
while( $row = fgets($fp, 10000) ) :
   $text .= $row;
   $i++;
   if ($i > 5000) {
      print_r(getrusage());
      $text = $row;
      $i = 0;
   }
endwhile;

Maybe letting Zend/PHP take care of things implicitly shows an improvement? 
I suppose overall script memory usage will increase over time due to some
overhead, but I'm curious as to what/why the overhead is/exists, if there's a
limit, and if it can be totally skirted.  Or, hark, memory leaks?

Subject: Second (Bizarre) Question regarding PHP and ASP
Message-ID: <03f201c2b44b$163823c0$2aaf6244@scandinawa1bo6>

I don't know how to post this one so I'm sorry for such bizarre cross-posting, but honestly I don't know where to go for help on this one!

I have process.php that has to call a remote file called process.asp on another site.

Site 1 has the cookie domain I want (that's where process.php is housed)
Site 2 has the database I need (because I can't obtain a database for Site 1 - Site 2 is where process.asp is housed)

process.php has to do an fopen to process.asp to process username and password material.  process.asp needs security, obviously, to ensure that the user is "coming" from process.asp (but he's not because he's doing an fopen).

in other words, process.php opens up process.asp and returns the evaluation of process.asp onto process.php

I tried using REQUEST_URI but I didn't get the results I wanted.  How will process.asp know that process.php called it in order to do what it should do?

Thanx
Phil

  }

  foreach ($HTTP_POST_VARS as $key => $val) {
   if (!empty($HTTP_POST_VARS["$key"])) ${"$key"} = $HTTP_POST_VARS["$key"];
  }

Whenever the form variable is equal to 0, the value is not passed into the corresponding variable.

For example, if isLogin = 1, then $isLogin = 1
But if isRegistered = 0 then $isRegistered = {null}

I do not understand why this happens, someone enlighten me!

if you can get $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] or $HTTP_REMOTE_ADDR
and if you can trust it (not only that it's right, but also that there are no
man in the middle attacks or other scripts on the client that can pretend
to be your script) then you could just check that the request is coming
from the right IP.

alternatively, you could use hashes that change from one invocation
to the next (to avoid replay attacks).  the server and the client
should both have a secret passphrase (perhaps even a whole set
of them, one for each day, and generated every month or so).

on the client (process.php) randomly generate a string, e.g., $randstr.
create a hash based on the secret passphrase and the randstr, e.g,

$hash=makeMyHash($passphrase.$randstr); /* use whatever hash
   function you want: openssl, mhash, mcrypt or whatever you
   use */

send the randstr and the hash along with the rest of the data.  on the 
server side, process.asp takes the randstr, takes the hash as above,
and compares the hash generated with the hash passed in.
if they don't match, don't reply.  if they match, then the request comes
from process.php (unless you're really paranoid, in which case, add
some more hoops for process.php to jump through :).

empty() returns true if the variable is either not set or is zero.  Try 
using isset() instead.

I don't know how to post this one so I'm sorry for such bizarre
cross-posting, but honestly I don't know where to go for help on this
one!

I have process.php that has to call a remote file called process.asp on
another site.

Site 1 has the cookie domain I want (that's where process.php is housed)
Site 2 has the database I need (because I can't obtain a database for
Site 1 - Site 2 is where process.asp is housed)

process.php has to do an fopen to process.asp to process username and
password material.  process.asp needs security, obviously, to ensure
that the user is "coming" from process.asp (but he's not because he's
doing an fopen).

in other words, process.php opens up process.asp and returns the
evaluation of process.asp onto process.php

I tried using REQUEST_URI but I didn't get the results I wanted.  How
will process.asp know that process.php called it in order to do what it
should do?

Thanx
Phil

I doubt that the change you need to make is in the PHP.ini file, but I don't
use the Windows version of PHP... so, I might be wrong. Sorry that I can't

Message-ID: <200301051729.MAA12906@gw00.com>

Dear Tracy,

	Here is a basic suggestion:

	Build a test script that just displays
the configuration info:

>>>
<? phpinfo() ?>
<<<

	(It's a one-line script.)  This will allow
you to see if the GD extensions have actually been
loaded.  Of course you should run this script as
a CGI or whatever method you will be running your
real script.

	If the GD stuff is working, it will be listed
as "GD Support: enabled" or something like that in
this configuration listing.  There may be some furthe
options with GD that may also be (or not be) listed.

	If you don't see any references to GD in the
phpinfo page, I would suspect your extension DLLs are
not in the right place.  I have only installed Windows
PHP once or twice, but this was always an issue.
Perhaps someone else could explain exactly where what
needs to go.  For some reason, I think you should dump
all of the PHP DLL's into one of those Windows system
directories . . . which seems ugly, but I think that
was recommended and it worked for me.  Check the
installation documentation.

	However, did you know that as of PHP version 4.3,
GD is bundled with PHP?  If you haven't yet got it to
work, I would recommend getting up to date, and using
the bundled library, rather than getting committed to
obsolete GD and PHP versions -- which may cause you
trouble when upgrading in the future.

	You may still have to "install" the bundled
GD, but it may be more likely to work out-of-the-box,
since it all came from the same package.

	Oh yeah, once you know PHP is running GD (by
seeing "GD" in the phpinfo report, you can move on
to troubleshooting real GD-specific issues (if any).


Best, George.

Have you removed the ";" from the beginning of this line in your php.ini 
file?

   ;extension=php_gd.dll

In the distribution I've got, 4.2.3, this needs to be done in order for
things to work right.

Message-ID: <F9E832D44277A64EA6FB98FE9BD720FDB003E1@psle07.xchg.pwj.com>

I ran into this myself.  With checkboxes (and radio buttons, I think), the
form key and value are only passed to the following page if they are checked
off.  That is, if Checkbox is checked (and has 'value=1', you will see
$Checkbox=1.  If Checkbox is not checked, you will see nothing at all, as if
Checkbox doesn't exist on the submitted form.  So if you are passing
checkboxes or radio buttons to a processing page, you really have to check
for existence, as well as value.  isset(), which Steve pointed out, may
work... I go about it differently (I set all of my variables explicitly,
instead of in a loop, so I use 'if ($_GET['checkbox']){$checkData =
$_GET['checkbox'];}' and such.)

Whenever the form variable is equal to 0, the value is not passed into the

For example, if isLogin = 1, then $isLogin = 1

I had a similar problem a few years back (like 1996)
I remember doing something like this in my form code:

// this creates a "default" value for the variable
// it MUST come before the checkbox
<input type=hidden name=some_name value=0>

// this is the checkbox
<input type=checkbox name=some_name>

I wouldn't really recomend doing it this way since it's just a hack.
It depends on the variables being set in the order in which they appear in
the URL.
You could probably do something using the same idea, but with arrays that
would be much better.

Subject: Trouble with sockets
Message-ID: <20030106151255.GK12975@eye.surgam.net>

I'm working on a php class to post to livejournal programmatically
from my other sites, and running into some problems with the socket.

class source is below, but the basic problem is that I don't seem to
be connecting a valid socket to www.livejournal.com. I thought maybe
the post was the problem (the first symptom was I just didn't get
anything back), so I changed the request to a simple get of the
root. Still nothing. I changed the host to www.yahoo.com, and it
worked. I'm able to telnet to port 80 on www.livejournal.com (from the
server), and issue the exact same set of commands, and I get a
response, but no dice going through the socket from the script. I
tried increasing the timeout, but that's clearly not the problem. It
looks like it's establishing the socket okay, but then I get no
response back.

Any idea why this would behave this way?

----------------------------------------

class lj {
  var $user;
  var $pass;

  function lj ($user, $pass) {
    $this->user = $user;
    $this->pass = $pass;
  }

  function postevent ($msgtext, $subject) {
    $options = array('mode' => 'postevent',
                     'user' => $this->user,
                     'hpassword' => md5($this->pass),
                     'event' => $msgtext,
                     'year' => date('Y'),
                     'mon' => date('n'),

                     'min' => date('i'),
                     'subject' => $subject);

    foreach (array_keys($options) as $key) {
      $poststring .= $key . '=' . urlencode($options[$key]) . '&';
    }
    $poststring = substr($poststring, 0, strlen($poststring) - 1);

    $method = 'POST';
    $path = '/interface/flat';
    $host = 'www.livejournal.com';

    $fp = fsockopen($host, 80, $errno, $errstr, 600);
    if (!$fp) {
      die ('Unable to connect');
    }
    socket_set_timeout($fp, 600);

#    fputs($fp, "$method $path HTTP/1.0\

#    fputs($fp, "Content-length: " . strlen($poststring) . '\

#    fputs($fp, $poststring);

    # instead of the above post, try a simple get instead
    fputs($fp, "GET / HTTP/1.0\
\
");

    while (!feof ($fp)) {
      $response = fgets($fp, 128);
      print $response;
    }
    fclose ($fp);

    return $response;

I've been using mySQL in Windows2000 and WinXP without a hitch.  I'm hitting
the databases through PHP and Java ( Client/Server App ).  I even have
Apache & PHP running on these boxes so I can administer the mySQL through
phpMyAdmin.

Never mind - I figured it out. Their server needs \\r\
 instead of \
.

Hi Adam.  Two ideas:

	1/ try CRLF's instead of just LF's after the HTTP GET
	(i.e. \\r\
\\r\
)

	2/ use fopen() instead of fsockopen ... you can use
	a URL as the arg, and if you need username/password,
	you might be able to do 

	$fp = fopen ( 'http://joe:pass at example.org/path.cgi' );

	or something like that...?  


Best, George.

nice.  you might want to consider using the cURL library and php/curl 
extension to do this.  It'll cut down on the code size, and greatly improve
the speed of your code (php/curl is about 4-5x faster than a custom rolled
solution, in most cases).  At the least, it might be nice to provide cURL 
as an option, with the default being fsockopen().

Also, this class, were it slightly modified looks like a good addition to
the PEAR project, http://pear.php.net/, would you be interested in contributing?

Hi ed,

If you have budget, you should go with vBulletin. It is commercial, but
the best one out there. I manage three vB based communities and can't
say it wasn't worth it.

If you need a free one, you can either go with phpBB2 or Invision
Boards.

vBulletin: www.vbulletin.com
phpBB2: www.phpbb.com
Invision: http://www.invisionboard.com/

Nasir Zubair

Message-ID: <3E19E727.9020106@netscape.net>


I am using GBSurvey (http://www.geniusbug.com/) to create a survey for 
teachers at a school.  The application only allows for radio buttons in 
the surveys. The school wants some questions to have checkboxes so 
responders can select multiple answers for the question.  I rewrote the 
code to allow the admin to select if the answers to a survey question 
will be radio buttons or checkboxes.  That displays properly.  When I 
test it with multiple check boxes selected in one of the questions only 
the value of the last checkbox selected is entered into the database.  I 
confirmed this by printing the $_POST variables and only the last 
checkbox selected is being sent to the script.  If anyone can offer some 
help, I would be very appreciative.

Here is the code:

Explaination of VARS for this example
------------------
$survey_id = The id of the survey

DB Field Definitions
------------------
surveya_type = Radio or Checkbox
surveyq_id = The question id in the database
surveya_id = The answer id in the database
surveya_name = The answer itself
------------------

This is the code to create the questions:
------------------
function list_surveyq($survey_id) {
      echo "<b><i><a 
href=\\"".$GLOBALS["PHP_SELF"]."?survey_id=".$survey_id."&view_results=true\\">View 
results without taking the survey</a></i></b><P>\
";

      $strSQL = "SELECT * From bug_public_survey WHERE 
survey_id=".$survey_id;
      $query1 = mysql_query($strSQL,$GLOBALS["dbconn"]);
      $survey = mysql_fetch_array($query1);
      echo "<form method=\\"post\\" action=\\"".$GLOBALS["PHP_SELF"]."\\">\
";
      echo "<input type=\\"hidden\\" name=\\"votes\\" value=\\"1\\">\
";
      echo "<input type=\\"hidden\\" name=\\"survey_id\\" 
value=\\"".$survey_id."\\">\
";
//Get all the questions
      $strSQL = "SELECT * From bug_public_surveyq WHERE 
surveyq_surveyid=".$survey["survey_id"]." ORDER By surveyq_id";
      $query2 = mysql_query($strSQL,$GLOBALS["dbconn"]);
      while($surveyq = mysql_fetch_array($query2)) {
//Get all the answers
              echo "<b>".$surveyq["surveyq_name"]."</b><br>\
";
              $strSQL = "SELECT * From bug_public_surveya WHERE 
surveya_surveyqid=".$surveyq["surveyq_id"];
              $query3 = mysql_query($strSQL,$GLOBALS["dbconn"]);
              echo "<ul>\
";
              while($surveya = mysql_fetch_array($query3)) {

                      //
                      //THIS IS WHERE THE ANSWERS ARE PRINTED
                      //print radio button or checkbox and answer title 
for each question
                      //
echo "<input type=\\"".$surveya["surveya_type"]."\\" 
name=\\"answer[".$surveyq["surveyq_id"]."]\\" 
value=\\"".$surveya["surveya_id"]."\\"> ".$surveya["surveya_name"]."<br>\
";
//original code -> echo "<input type=\\"radio\\" 
name=\\"answer[".$surveyq["surveyq_id"]."]\\" 
value=\\"".$surveya["surveya_id"]."\\"> ".$surveya["surveya_name"]."<br>\
";
              }
              echo "<hr></ul>\
";
      }
      echo "<input type=\\"submit\\" value=\\"Submit\\">\
";
      echo "</form>\
";

------------------

When the form is submitted, this is the SQL that is executed.   The 
value of $votes is set to 1.  The page will reload and check to see if 
$votes is set.

-------------------

if (isset($votes)) {
      $strSQL = "SELECT * From bug_public_surveyq WHERE 
surveyq_surveyid=".$survey_id;
      $query = mysql_query($strSQL,$GLOBALS["dbconn"]);
      while($surveyq = mysql_fetch_array($query)) {
              $strSQL = "INSERT INTO bug_public_surveyr 
(surveyr_surveyid, surveyr_surveyaid, surveyr_surveyqid) VALUES 
(".$survey_id.", ".$answer[$surveyq["surveyq_id"]].", 
".$surveyq["surveyq_id"].")";
                            echo $strSQL;
              mysql_query($strSQL,$dbconn);
      }
      mysql_free_result($query);
}
-------------------

The name of each checkbox is the same answer[id#] but the values are 
different.  Do both the name and values have to be different?  When it 
is inserted into the DB it shouldn't matter since the record would not 
be a duplicate.

Thanks again!

Sure. Seems like the coding standards are pretty reasonable. Are you
involved in this, or is this just a suggestion?

A little, not much lately, but I can give you an account.

What I would do, is send your class proposal to pear-dev at lists.php.net, and apply 
for a PEAR account at http://pear.php.net/account-request.php.  Once you have your
class approved (it should be easy, mostly it will be deciding a namespace, and coding 
style), then you can upload it to PEAR.

Does anyone have live sites going that are using phpBB or vBulletin?  I
would love to take a look at them, as I am looking to set up discussion
boards as well.

Thanks!

I'm using PHPBB on one of the sites I run, but I'm taking it down soon due
to a new design.
I'm currently are working on a new project named LDU (Land Down Under). 
It is a slick piece of software.

Old site using PHPBB -> http://www.iqsquad.com
New site using LDU (not live/under construction) ->
http://www.iqsquad.com/index.php

http://perldesk.org/ is the defacto standard for small/medium hosting companies.

There's also Request Tracker which is much bigger and more feature rich. http://www.bestpractical.com/

Hi gang,

Got a new Mac X Serv and am installing MySQL and PHP.

I use the downloads and instructions from www.entropy.ch. Always had 
success with these, but I am having a problem I haven't had before.

I follow all of Marcs instructions then type the final command:

sudo apachectl graceful

I get an error

/usr/bin/apachectl graceful: configuration broken, ignoring restart
/usr/bin/apachectl graceful: (run 'apacectl configtest' for details)


when I run the configtest I get the message

syntax error on line 369 of /etc/httpd/httd.conf
Cannot add module via name 'mod.php4.c': not in list of loaded modules.


I will of course open up the config file and look at it, but I thought 
if someone had come across this problem before they could tell me what 
the fix is.

At the bottom of this post

It might have the answer to your problem in regard to httpd.conf.

Did you do this?

on Mac OS X: 

vi /etc/httpd/httpd.conf 

Find the following and make sure it is in this order: 

<IfModule mod_dir.c> 
DirectoryIndex default.php index.php index.htm index.html 
</IfModule>

Matt,
    I highly doubt that it is in the order matters... if apache is giving an
error because it can't load PHP it's probably something because you forgot
to do something, or something isn't in there right...
Check this step of the PHP installation with Apache out :
----------------------------------------------------------------------

14. Edit your httpd.conf or srm.conf file and check that these lines are
    present and not commented out:

   AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

   LoadModule php4_module        libexec/libphp4.so

  You can choose any extension you wish here.  .php is simply the one
  we suggest. You can even include .html, and .php3 can be added for
  backwards compatibility.

  The path on the right hand side of the LoadModule statement must point
  to the path of the PHP module on your system. The above statement is
  correct for the steps shown above.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Text: http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.apache.php

Hope that helps.
-Bradley

Yeah, I figure that too Bradely.

I replace the httpd.conf with the backup config  file and stared from  
scratch again, three times, and I keep getting the same error.

Like I said, I also go to Marc's site a lot and do the same exact thing  
and it always works so I cant' for life figure out what I did wrong.  
This is my first time doing it on OS X server though. I have just done  
it on OS X before. I know OS X server ships with PHP installed, but I  
wanted the full version.

Hi,

I am tring to sort the table that shows the contents in my user table. i haev been able to sort on the basis of age and gender. i have tried for name but if i use the persent syntax, i get only their first names meaning the title (MR. or MRS or MS) is chopped off. i want to know if its possible to arrange as: Mrs. A, Mr. B, Ms. C instead of wot i have now : just  A, B, C.

also i am unsure as to how i have the sorting functions called. i thought of including it as buttons in the table header and invoke onClick. but i dont know how to switch from php to javascript ie mix the two and exchange values. the second option was to try to use links to re-load the page ($php_self). 

which would be better, can any one suggest an optimum method to achive the desired results?

Regards,
Tracy

Good morning NYPHP Group!

An interesting iSeminar is being held by Zeev Suraski this morning:

This iSeminar gives an overview of the new language-level features developed
in the Zend Engine 2, and the way they address the limitations of Zend
Engine 1 in PHP 4 including:

? New object oriented model
? Integration with external object oriented models, such as COM and Java
? Exception handling
? Stack tracing

Hello All,

I have been using the following PHP code (found on the net somewhere) to
connect to the UPS site to calculate shipping.  The code now returns "error"
for the shipping quote.  When I assemble the string myself, I can see that
the program on the UPS site has in fact stopped working.  Does anyone have
any information about this (when did it stop working, did they 'move' the
program, new code to use, etc.)?

Also, has anyone tried intershipper (www.intershipper.net) with PHP?  What
are your experiences?

Thanks,

Tom

    Version: 0.06 (29 November, 1999)

    UPS Shipping calculator.  Much of this is re-organized stuff that was
    borrowed from shawnblue at radiotakeover.com.  I fixed a couple of bugs,
    and optimized much of the code for speed (ie switch(), rather than
    a bunch of if() statements, join(), rather than a lot of .=
    statements, etc..  I tested this using the sample code below (using
    various values for my paramaters), and it works pretty well.  Happy
    shipping.

    Sample usage:
    $rate = new Ups;
    $rate->upsProduct("1DM");    // See upsProduct() function for codes
    $rate->origin("08033", "US"); // Use ISO country codes!
    $rate->dest("90210", "US");      // Use ISO country codes!
    $rate->rate("RDP");        // See the rate() function for codes
    $rate->container("CP");    // See the container() function for codes
    $rate->weight("2");
    $rate->rescom("RES");    // See the rescom() function for codes
    $quote = $rate->getQuote();
    echo $quote;

We are a research group within CUNY's Graduate Center that studies things
like alternatives to jails, and the effects of gentrification on lifelong
residents of NYC via private and public grants (see, told you really great
things!)
However, our website is WILDLY out of date, and extremely static. The last
time it was touched was '99.
Like every non-profit, all of us are overworked and underpaid. I tried to
learn Dreamweaver (don't laugh) in order to rebuild the site, but I recently
realized that it's simply not realistic.
So, I come to you. I know what content is needed, and an idea about the
format. This is not terribly hard website for someone who has the
experience. I think we'd only have to meet once (maybe twice) over the whole
thing.
Please email me any examples of work.
We can pay $300-350.

You really only need to add the field to the database pull and then make
sure you use Sort ascending by FIELDNAME. The sort isn't the issue.. 
It's the way the sort is being displayed..

I'd love to help more.. But I'd really need to chat off list...
If you're on a instant messenger let me know which one and the times
you're online.. And I'll talk you through the fix

It was interesting and great being able to ask Zeev questions in real-time. 
I try to maintain a list of useful presentations at
http://nyphp.org/presentations/ and then click Other Presentations.  Zend's
stuff is the last section, and although today's material isn't up yet, it
looks like it will be shortly (and there are other talks, including audio,
there as well).

Sorry, I just caught up to this one, have you had any luck? I have it  
running quite happily on my machines here, all built (with various  
configurations) by me. I'm sure we can figure out what's going on.

First off, did you only build php, or did you do both php and apache?

Sorry, I just caught up to this one, have you had any luck? I have it  
running quite happily on my machines here, all built (with various  
configurations) by me. I'm sure we can figure out what's going on.

First off, did you only build php, or did you do both php and apache?

The best is always yours. Try writing one yourself...
If time is a big concern, however, I'm not sure what 3rd party script is the
best one... There are a lot out there though... try google =)

popular one, they're Perl, but whatever works, right?

I am making changes to an XML file (and the only way I can, unless anyone knows how in PHP I can write TO an XML file!!! is to use a TCL CGI script to write to the XML file), once changes have been made I need to reopen the file and read its contents, however, every time I do I am getting OLD file information and NOT my changes, every single time, unless I refresh my page... 

Does anyone know what I can do about this? I can't redirect them, that would be horribly inefficient.. what can I do?

Thanx

There might be couple of problems:
- your php script should read from the cgi script until EOF, so it 
continues after the other script finishes
- your cgi script should fflush the file before closing, and then close 
the connection
- use clearstatcache() before opening the file if the php script 
accesses the file before

Hello,

I have used Rodin for various blogs and sites: http://rodin.lot23.com
It is really small ( 5 to 10 k) and does a lot. It has some nifty 
plugins (referred to as 'toys') too.

I plan to release my branch of Rodin under the GPL with different 
modules (support real estate listings), international language support, 
and a built in HTML editor with live preview, in some time.

If you interested in  trying out the (as yet private) demo site of  my 
version, which uses Rodin, please let me know.

I am looking for a good name for my own branch. If anyone has any 
suggestions, please let me know.

Regards,

- Jay

-- Complete Details at http://nyphp.org --

I hope everyone had a great holiday and is hungry for an informative meeting;
with a bonus!  Good, because that's what we have in store for our January
Meeting.


New York PHP Presents...

"Building a Scalable Architecture with PHP"
"High Performance PHP"
PHP Job Opportunities

Presented by Community Connect's CTO Mike Montero and Chief Architect Dan
Cowgill, these talks are for those interested in PHP internals, performance
and enterprise PHP development.  Few know PHP like these guys, so you won't
want to miss their insight.

And then, join Community Connect Recruiter David Dankin to explore the PHP
job market and check out available positions at CC.  What a great way to
start a year!

One important note, however, is that NYPHP monthly meetings have been moved
to the 4th Tuesday of the month (1/28/03) so don't forget to update your
PDAs.

As always this meeting is free and open to the public, with complete meeting
and location details at http://nyphp.org

Thank you,

Message-ID: <LBEDJMJGLEPEKJAJMHBDEEDHDMAA.tom@supertom.com>

Just to follow up and document the fix, after scrutiny I found that UPS
changed the parameter from:

49_residential=2 (for commerical)

to

49_residential=NO

Having the '2' in there broke the whole thing.  I'd like to find a better
way to do this, but at least it now works.

Thanks,

Tom

I have been using the following PHP code (found on the net somewhere) to
connect to the UPS site to calculate shipping.  The code now returns "error"
for the shipping quote.  When I assemble the string myself, I can see that
the program on the UPS site has in fact stopped working.  Does anyone have
any information about this (when did it stop working, did they 'move' the
program, new code to use, etc.)?

Also, has anyone tried intershipper (www.intershipper.net) with PHP?  What
are your experiences?

Thanks,

Tom

    UPS Shipping calculator.  Much of this is re-organized stuff that was
    borrowed from shawnblue at radiotakeover.com.  I fixed a couple of bugs,
    and optimized much of the code for speed (ie switch(), rather than
    a bunch of if() statements, join(), rather than a lot of .=
    statements, etc..  I tested this using the sample code below (using
    various values for my paramaters), and it works pretty well.  Happy
    shipping.

    Sample usage:
    $rate = new Ups;
    $rate->upsProduct("1DM");    // See upsProduct() function for codes
    $rate->origin("08033", "US"); // Use ISO country codes!
    $rate->dest("90210", "US");      // Use ISO country codes!
    $rate->rate("RDP");        // See the rate() function for codes
    $rate->container("CP");    // See the container() function for codes

Hi Tom,

I don't know why it is, but when I go to the UPS website and enter in the
data for the sample I get a different value than what the class returns.

Best regards,
John Adair

Just to follow up and document the fix, after scrutiny I found that UPS
changed the parameter from:

49_residential=2 (for commerical)

to

49_residential=NO

Having the '2' in there broke the whole thing.  I'd like to find a better
way to do this, but at least it now works.

Thanks,

Tom

Good afternoon all,

The response for helping LWE has been great; thank you!  I have some more
details that I hope will clarify our next steps for getting to LWE, and how
you can help.

Take a look at http://nyphp.org/#lwe for updated information, and the links
to actually sign-up and scheduling.  It's also a good idea to get on their
mailing list (send a blank message to expo-subscribe at unilug.org), since most
action will be discussed there.

We have a great start already, but that doesn't mean you still can't help! 
There's a need for literature, brochure and/or take-card writting and design
(give me a shout at hans at nyphp.org).  And, since this IS a computer show,
anyone who can bring laptops, hubs, monitors, etc. would be welcomed with
open arms (sign-up at http://booth.unilug.org).

If you'd like to help, but just aren't sure where to start, drop me a note at
hans at nyphp.org; and ask any other questions as well.

Thank you,

hi all

I'm trying to pass a bunch of long urls to a script as a link tracker
but the urls contain ampersands. so, if I want to track the link
www.domain.com?state=ny&county=kings

my script stops at the ampersand - I assume I have to escape it somehow?

if (!isset($redir)) 
    die("Sorry, that link is bad. Please go back and try a different link.");

if (!isset($referrer)) {
    if (!isset($HTTP_REFERER)) {
        $referrer = "none";
    } else {
        $referrer = $HTTP_REFERER;
    };
};

if (!isset($REMOTE_ADDR)) {
    $remotehost = "no client address";
} else {
    $remotehost = $REMOTE_ADDR;
};

$timeused = date("Y-m-d H:i:s",time());

@mysql_db_query($db_data , "insert into $db_table values('$redir','$referrer',
    '$remotehost','$timeused')");

Header("Location: $redir");
exit;

thanks much,

Hi all,

I've run into another weird one.  I'm using PHP 4.1.2 to connect to SQL
Server 2000.  If I run the page from IIS, it connects to the DB just fine
and runs a stored procedure.  If I execute the same page via the command
line, it dies on the connection attempt (mssql_connect()).  Anyone run into
something like this?  I can't figure out why they'd behave differently.

Thanks in advance!

Hi everyone,

After struggling with Windows all these years, I'm finally learning PHP
and My SQL on Linux/Apache.  Unfortunately, I have some data that I need
to get to, that is in an MS Access database.  Is it possible to access
Access via PHP?  Alternatively, is there a way to transform Access to
MySQL instead?  Any links to additional info would be appreciated!

Thanks,

Use urlencode() to encode the URLs being passed to the link tracker.

E.g. do this:

$redir = 'http://www.domain.com?state=ny&county=kings';
print '<a href="'.urlencode($redir).'">click here</a>.';

Instead of this:

$redir = 'http://www.domain.com?state=ny&county=kings';
print '<a href="'.$redir.'">click here</a>.';

Nevermind, I was dumb and didn't check to make sure the database was defined
as a System DSN.  It seems IIS automagically resolves the database name,
whereas PHP counts on the data source being registered with the system.

Thanks anyway! :-)

Hi all,

I've run into another weird one.  I'm using PHP 4.1.2 to connect to SQL
Server 2000.  If I run the page from IIS, it connects to the DB just fine
and runs a stored procedure.  If I execute the same page via the command
line, it dies on the connection attempt (mssql_connect()).  Anyone run into
something like this?  I can't figure out why they'd behave differently.

Thanks in advance!

I get an error, "The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be
found" when I attempt to run the sample code pdfclock provided with PDFlib.

Does anyone know what I need to do to correct this?  I do believe that the
PDF is being built because I do get prompted to save pdf_clock with a
Filetype of Adobe Acrobat Control for ActiveX.

System: Win2000 Pro, Apache 1.3.27, PHP 4.4.0-dev.

Subject: email handling with php
Message-ID: <00c401c2b81d$29fe01b0$5e06fea9@brother>

hi

I am working on a web email client and i like to know how if anyone went about handling the protocols such as pop3,imap,smtp

My alternatives as i see them are as follows
A: roll my own code.  ( I dont favor this and like to use reusable components)
B: user Pear Mail and Net classes ( there is a pop3 implementation, there is also a general interface for sending mail , lacking imap)
C: use the imap extentions (It can do other things then just imap,  not sure if it can do pop3, but in any case i cant put a requirment that this extention bve installed)
D: use the php own mail command (this may not be configured ? and its only for sending mail)

Right now my plan is to create an abstract interface for receiving mail.
I would use the imap extention if its available but fall back on pear classes if its not

Anyone have any suggestions ?

Bill,

I've done it on Windows... All you have to do is define the Access database
as an ODBC data source, then use the ODBC functions
(http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.odbc.php) to connect to it and access the
data.

Hi everyone,

After struggling with Windows all these years, I'm finally learning PHP
and My SQL on Linux/Apache.  Unfortunately, I have some data that I need
to get to, that is in an MS Access database.  Is it possible to access
Access via PHP?  Alternatively, is there a way to transform Access to
MySQL instead?  Any links to additional info would be appreciated!

Thanks,

Message-ID: <se1d94fc.099@mail.ipro.org>

So right now I have to point to dozens of pages like thi sone:
http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Search/HomeSelect.asp?State=NY1%7CNew+York+-+Upstate&Type=County&County=33060%7CChautauqua

So I use

href="http://www.ipro.org/redirect.php?redir=http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Search/HomeSelect.asp?State=NY1%7CNew+York+-+Upstate&Type=County&County=33060%7CChautauqua"

which counts the click and forwards the user (except for stopping at "&Upstate")

but you're saying now I would need
<?
$redir = 'http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Search/HomeSelect.asp?State=NY1%7CNew+York+-+Upstate&Type=County&County=33060%7CChautauqua'
?>
...
href="http://www.ipro.org/redirect.php?redir=<?= urlencode($redir) ?>"
...

for each link?


>>> sklar at sklar.com 01/09/03 03:02PM >>>
Use urlencode() to encode the URLs being passed to the link tracker.

E.g. do this:

$redir = 'http://www.domain.com?state=ny&county=kings';
print '<a href="'.urlencode($redir).'">click here</a>.';

Instead of this:

$redir = 'http://www.domain.com?state=ny&county=kings';
print '<a href="'.$redir.'">click here</a>.';

Yes.

Although I suppose if you had your content in a difficult-to-edit format, or
had thousands and thousands of links, you could do something like:

<?php

ob_start();

/* print out giant page */

$page = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();

$page =
preg_replace('/?redir=([^"])+?"/e',"'?redir='.urlencode('\\\\1').'"',$page);

print $page;

?>

This captures the page into $page using output buffering and then encodes
the URLs with preg_replace() and urlencode. It assumes that there are no
single or double quotes in the URLs that need to be encoding. You should
doublecheck my preg_replace() regex syntax -- I haven't tested this code.

It's my understanding that Moveable Type took 2 full-time programmers 
about a year to get online. I guess you can write your own as a php 
learning
  experience, on the other hand, you may want to just take theirs and 
and use that time to master Linux internals, or some other way out 
thing.  :-)

  I believe this dialog (roll your own, or use what's out there) came up 
on slashdot awhile back, my favorite response was:  "Dude, real 
programmers write their own OS'es"  :-)

I have a feeling that your query isn't being executed properly.
add an "or die"... example :

$sql = 'SELECT * FROM blah';
$result = mysql_query($sql)
    or die(mysql_error());

...rest of code...

Install myodbc for windows and export the tables and data to
a mysql db...

MyODBC http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc-2.50.html

A better way would be to port your access schema to mysql
and use myodbc to link to the mysql tables and create
queries in access to move data.

I answer this one before.  I think you need to put

AddModule mod_php4.c

to the AddModule section on httpd.conf

Yeah, I figure that too Bradely.

I replace the httpd.conf with the backup config  file and stared from
scratch again, three times, and I keep getting the same error.

Like I said, I also go to Marc's site a lot and do the same exact thing
and it always works so I cant' for life figure out what I did wrong.
This is my first time doing it on OS X server though. I have just done
it on OS X before. I know OS X server ships with PHP installed, but I
wanted the full version.

MyODBC http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc-2.50.html

A better way would be to port your access schema to mysql
and use myodbc to link to the mysql tables and create
queries in access to move data.

You can exchange from PHP to Javascript but not vice-versa.

If that is what you want, by all means do it.

Otherwise, you have to try something else.

I have a question about the usage of fsockopen() to open and "scrape" the contents of a remote URL: if the contents take a very long time to load on the remote URL either due to server or coding issues, is there a way for the socket on the PHP end to time out, that is, quit trying to "scrape" contents from the remote site and post a default message instead?

Just wondering

Yes, it is the last parameter of the fsockopen() function. Normally, it
will be set to something like 30 seconds, you might adjust it to
whatever you like. After that time you will get error 110 which means
"Connection timed out". Additionally, if you set anything over 30
seconds, you might also consider altering the execution time limit for
the php script itself.

There are two ways to do this. You can specify a timeout value as the
fifth arg to fsockopen. This is the timeout for the connection
itself. You can also use stream_set_timeout once the socket is open.

While the fsockopen / scrape issue is hot...

I have a Newsletter mailing script that uses fsockopen to do just as you say:
Scrape a url and mail the contents to a list of recipients.

The only problem is that if I mail this to a user that doesn't have access to the original url, the resultant email will contain only text with errant referances to the images.  This is because the
email merely contains hrefs and src's back to the original server.

Is anyone aware of how to scrape and grab content and mail it so that the email is wholey contained and independent of the original url/server?

Mike

I'm not sure how you would include the images as attachments for use in HTML in
the email.  You could drop them on a server that the user does have access to
and refer to them in the email. Here are a few ideas to get you on your way
in either case.. 

A. Parse the HTML and retrieve the files yourself.

B. Using lynx: If you exec lynx on a page with the -dump and -image_links
options, it will render the HTML to plain text for you, and at the end list all
URLs and images referred to in the document.  You could parse this list and use
to retrieve each image required.  (Much simpler parsing than in A)

C. Using wget: Using the --page-requisites will cause wget to grab all other
files required to render the page locally.  (No parsing!)

So once you've got your required files, then you have to get them to the email
recipient.  You could drop them on a server they do have access to. Or figure
out how to attach them in an email and refer to them in an HTML email. I know
the latter is possible, although I have not done it myself.

Hope that helps.

Regards,
Andrew

In need of an osCommerce guru ASAP.  Candidate will need to be
well-versed in osCommerce (through past experience and/or through the
oscdox.com documentation), PHP, SSL, and the installing of certificates
on a remote server; and have managed and/or completed at least one
install/mod of osCommerce on a remote server.

This is obviously a paying gig.  Email your links/creds/rate to
matt at reconstukt.com, and if you're the person we're looking for, I'll
send you everything else you need to know - including the design
mockups, the mod requirements/writeups/code snippets, and SSL
requirements for the osC install.

Thanks!

This sounded like because the page was cached.  Maybe try using socket and 
read in that way if you are not using a proxy server.

I am making changes to an XML file (and the only way I can, unless anyone 
knows how in PHP I can write TO an XML file!!! is to use a TCL CGI script to 
write to the XML file), once changes have been made I need to reopen the 
file and read its contents, however, every time I do I am getting OLD file 
information and NOT my changes, every single time, unless I refresh my 
page...

Does anyone know what I can do about this? I can't redirect them, that would 
be horribly inefficient.. what can I do?

Thanx
Phil

hi all

I'm trying to pass a bunch of long urls to a script as a link tracker
but the urls contain ampersands. so, if I want to track the link
www.domain.com?state=ny&county=kings

my script stops at the ampersand - I assume I have to escape it somehow?

if (!isset($redir))
     die("Sorry, that link is bad. Please go back and try a different 
link.");

if (!isset($referrer)) {
     if (!isset($HTTP_REFERER)) {
         $referrer = "none";
     } else {
         $referrer = $HTTP_REFERER;
     };
};

if (!isset($REMOTE_ADDR)) {
     $remotehost = "no client address";
} else {
     $remotehost = $REMOTE_ADDR;
};

$timeused = date("Y-m-d H:i:s",time());

@mysql_db_query($db_data , "insert into $db_table 
values('$redir','$referrer',
     '$remotehost','$timeused')");

Header("Location: $redir");
exit;

thanks much,
jaz

Sounds like you are using 2 different PHP.  One to run on the web server and 
the other run on the command line.  If this is the case, you might have to 
change the setting for the command line PHP.

Hi all,

I've run into another weird one.  I'm using PHP 4.1.2 to connect to SQL
Server 2000.  If I run the page from IIS, it connects to the DB just fine
and runs a stored procedure.  If I execute the same page via the command
line, it dies on the connection attempt (mssql_connect()).  Anyone run into
something like this?  I can't figure out why they'd behave differently.

Thanks in advance!
Tom

Hi everyone,

After struggling with Windows all these years, I'm finally learning PHP
and My SQL on Linux/Apache.  Unfortunately, I have some data that I need
to get to, that is in an MS Access database.  Is it possible to access
Access via PHP?  Alternatively, is there a way to transform Access to
MySQL instead?  Any links to additional info would be appreciated!

Thanks,

Bill

In the links you would want to wrap them around the htmlentities() function
that returns an HTML-escaped string.  I'm not sure about htmlspecialchars()
though..

Why not read it in to a buffer, and then parse the href or src to add the

While the fsockopen / scrape issue is hot...

I have a Newsletter mailing script that uses fsockopen to do just as you 
say:
Scrape a url and mail the contents to a list of recipients.

The only problem is that if I mail this to a user that doesn't have access 
to the original url, the resultant email will contain only text with errant 
referances to the images.  This is because the
email merely contains hrefs and src's back to the original server.

Is anyone aware of how to scrape and grab content and mail it so that the 
email is wholey contained and independent of the original url/server?

Mike

In the links you would want to wrap them around the htmlentities() function
that returns an HTML-escaped string.  I'm not sure about htmlspecialchars()
though..

Michael/Andrew,
It's possible to create a self-contained HTML e-mail message with images.
I've done this many times.  You need to compile a multipart/related MIME
document. The images have to be base64 encoded, each as a separate MIME
content part.
In multipart/related MIME messages each part has it's own unique id
specified in the part's MIME headers:
Content-ID: <part1.message.id at not_important.com>

Those id's would be used instead of image URI's in the HTML part of the
message:
<IMG mailto:SRC="cid:part1.message.id at not_important.com>

It's also a good idea to include this header for each part that should be
'embedded' rater than treated as an attachment:
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="image.jpeg"

... and of course:
Content-Type: image/jpeg
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

You should find more info in this rfc doc:
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1872.html

Good luck,
Jerry

Why not read it in to a buffer, and then parse the href or src to add the 
server doc root url in front?  What do you think?

Message-ID: <200301111008.54124.brian@preston-campbell.com>

Anyone have any experience with PHP's FTP functions?  I am working on a 
specialized FTP client that will update flash rom in an embedded system.  On 
an AMP system, I want to be able to basically automate the process since the 
current method is from the command line.

The only problem I am facing, since I have taken care of making the connection 
and issuing the commands to the server, is parsing the response from the 
server.  In this case, outputting the response to the browser is essential.

To go into more detail, at the command line, once the connection has been made 
the 'hash' function is called.  The server shows the progress of the file 
transfer in '#' hash marks and proceeds with the update, also outputting any 
further response from the server.  I want to emulate this process in the PHP 
script.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Brian

Hi,

I guess you may want to have a look at source code of Http2Ftp
(http://obua.org/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=9) This script basically creating a web based
full featured ftp client and allows everyone upload&download files using simple browser interface.

But as an answer to your more detailed question I can say that you may not be able to show process
indication on Php if you are trying to create HTML output. But try to use "<pre>" tag and echo any
content after this HTML tag, this may provide you to show some sort of process indication. If you
use Php Cli interface you can send output to stdout and this can help you to show process
(upload/download) status.

http2ftp was one of about 10 clients I have mulled through over the past week.  
If I recall correctly, this script merely echos a canned response upon the 
completion of a file transfer and not the actual response of the FTP server.  
I may have to find another solution, as there it appears there is no simple 
way to do this.  pfsockopen() looked promising and I am working on a test 
script right now, but I am sceptical as this function involves actual files 
being read.

I will be looking at the source of some C FTP clients to get an idea of how to 
receive the requisite data and how those programs handle output.  We'll see.  
The command line may be the only option since the product vendor has never 
even bothered to produce an alternative means of firmware upgrade.

Hello List,

I think you *might* be able to show a progress bar by using print() &
flush():

<?php
$imgsrc = '<img src="/images/status.gif" width="1" height="15" alt=""
hspace="0" vspace="2">';

for($i=0; $i < 1000000; $i++) {
	print ($imgsrc);
	flush();
}
?>

Where status.gif is a thin little slice of a progress bar. I tested the
above code and it seems to work.

That moves me in the right direction.  I will try it out, the transfer status 
is the last piece of the puzzle for this project.  For the FTP connection, it 
was a simple matter of using exec("/usr/bin/ftp -v $server $port < $ftpfile", 
$ftpreply) where $ftpfile contains my ftp commands and $ftpreply is an array 
of output from the FTP program.

Hi,

Just got a new server with Redhat 8.0 which as Apache 2.0.40

I need to upgrade to 2.0.43.

Is it difficult to do?

I went to apache's web site, download, compiled, and installed and it 
seemed to go ok, but when I checked to see what version of Apache was 
running it was still 2.0.40. I gather it is because the default 
location for files on the install were different the 2.0.40 install.

I did specify to install in /usr/sbin, which seems to be where Red Hat 
has apache installed.

Obviously I don't expect to get step by step instructions from anyone 
on here about how to upgrade Apache, but I just want to see if I am 
over my head. I am not a hard-core hacker.

Is there a simple way to uninstall the older version?

Matt

Matt,

Check to see if the older Apache isn't still up and listening on port 80.

If 2.0.40 is up, kill it or change it's default port in the configuration 
file.

thanks Dan! duh... so I can just install 2.0.43 to a default location 
and kill the older version of Apache?

I never claimed to be smart. I really like that this lists takes 
questions from people of any skill level!

Thanks

Since you're running the RH 8,here are the commands you need

See what version is now installed in /usr/sbin
/usr/sbin/httpd -v
(should give you output similar to)
Server version: Apache/1.3.27 (Darwin)
Server built:   10/16/02 21:48:47

restart apache with (as root)
/etc/init.d/httpd restart

and look in the apache error log for a line that looks like
[root at borgcube gautamg]# tail /var/log/httpd/error_log
[Fri Jan  3 17:39:45 2003] [notice] 
Apache-AdvancedExtranetServer/1.3.23 (Mandrake Linux/4mdk) PHP/4.2.2 
configured -- resuming normal operations

this tells you what version of apache you just started.

Hope this helps,
Gautam

Subject: Super Bowl Sunday: Party!
Message-ID: <3E236A67.9D320412@alum.rpi.edu>

Hi:

I would like to know if anyone is interested in a
super bowl sunday party? I have space for about 20
or so people (we can push it to 30) in my
apartment so I was thinking lets have a party. I
have plenty of beer left from new years (about 50
cans) and if people want to bring stuff it would
be cool. As far as TV goes there's a 36" +
surround sound so I hope that can suffice. Anyhow,
if your interested, email me and let me know.
Thanks

-Evan

BTW, this would be in Park Slope, Brooklyn off the
Bergen St. 2/3 . Also accessible from the Atlantic
Avenue, 4,5,2,3,N,R,B,D,M,Q,W or the 7th Avenue Q
line.

Message-ID: <3E236B90.F3ECFDA4@alum.rpi.edu>

Ok, I have a doozer of a question so here it goes:

I would like to integrate apache 2.0 and tomcat in
such a way that each virtual domain in apache can
be a webapp from tomcat. I would also like to
hotdeploy these webapps without using the default
\\webapps directory structure that tomcat uses.
What do I edit and how do I edit it? I'm assuming
changes to the server.xml file and http.conf are
needed. I have been able to map a webapp to a
virtual directory in apache so
www.mydomain.com/myapp loads up the myapp webapp
from tomcat. But I would like the www.mydomain.com
to load up the app directly. Any takers?

I am developing a site off my laptop (Win98) w/ LAMP installed on a desktop
(WinXP) and no matter what I do I keep getting a blank page coming from the

Just a guess but it could be a permissions issue.  Not too familiar with 
Apache on Windoze but the incoming request is across the LAN is probably a 
different user than if you were accessing the file locally.

Uh, then it's not _L_AMP, eh?

Hmm...  Odd...  I'm guessing it's not an Apache misconfiguration because
you'd generally get some sort of browser output explaining the problem to
some degree or another or a browser message prompting a download.

So, are you sure your scripts are correct?  Does even a simple Hello 
world script produce nothing?

What comes up in your apache logs and error logs?

Do you have some sort of firewall or filtering software somewhere in the 
loop?  What happens if you examine the site via a browser on the XP box?

Jon, when you get a blank page in your browser, that doesn't necessarily
mean that nothing was returned.  View the html source being returned to
see if there was something there.  Maybe you have some tags, but no
data?  That may help debug it.

Hey Jon,

How are you doing? :)

Do you have all the error and warning messages turned on? They could be
helpful, more than me anyway!

Perhaps this will be a clue...  I get that kind of output when there's
a require statement which is failing but I have the failure hidden by
an @.

Perhaps there's some error that's not being reported.  Turn your error
reporting level all the way up in your php.ini file.  If you run PHP as
an Apache module, restart Apache.

Did you add "AddType" for php in the httpd.conf?  If so, check your "hosts"

Following is the code that will do a remote scrape of http://www3.brinkster.com/soa/val/profile/display.asp (which sometimes goes down), however, it should time out and produce an error after 5 seconds; instead, sometimes, the entire page (http://valsignalandet.com) which includes this script below, takes up to 90 seconds to load because of the ASP script locking, in spite of my safeguards.  Can anyone please help; I'm out of ideas.

Everything is there ... I understand the "hosts" under Linux but what would

Hi All,

I'm currently thinking of moving to a "real" IDE for PHP development.
Until now I've only been using "text editors" for my PHP development (namely
emacs and textpad).

The only "requirement" is that I can trace through my PHP code (preferably
running on a Linux based server and not just my PC)
Until now the development cycle has always been code -> copy to server ->
run PHP script -> see what happens.

1. I know that Zend Studio and NuSphere PHPEd support this. Are there any
others ?
2. Can anyone who uses and IDE give a short review ?
3. Are there any links to "professional" reviews out there ?

Thanx
Ophir

I believe so, but I don't know why you would others - if you are set on
purchasing an ide.

I'm a big fan of the Zend IDE, 2.5 beats NuSphere hands down.  With that
said, Zend IDE 2.6 should come out soon, and that's even better than
2.5, with support for cvs project management.

Those are links to external reviews of the product.

PS: I have no professional affiliation with Zend.  Although, it must be
said, I like them, and I find NuSphere's behaviour with MySQL
repugnant...

Is anyone from nyphp planning to go, or know more about it than what's

You can have it all actualy for free if you using windows.
PHPEdit at www.phpedit.net
Get the latest dev version and download the latest dgb debuger with latest
php version.
The installation can be a bit confusing but its worth it anyway cause its
free.
I found the debuger is pretty stable now.
You can put
DebugBreak() calls into your code and it works as just in time debuging were
anytime execution gets to that part of the code it will break into the IDE.

I just ssh in to my server and use emacs in c++ mode, I'd say it works 
wonderfully, especially using exceed as an X server to bring everything 
locally. I'm not sure what exactly you are looking for in an IDE, I'm 
suprised no one has written a really nice lisp interface for php and 
emacs, but, it's flexible enough to make a fairly good ide.

Well Ive edited the "hosts" ... what is even worse and more confusing about
the problem is that a telnet to 192.168.0.101:80 will actually give me the
info.php page and everything is fine, yet in IE or Netscape I still get
<html><body></body></html> ...

Does this problem sound remotely familiar to anybody?

I think it goes without saying that you get what you pay for :-)

The only editor I live by for the past few years has been JPadPro for pretty
much everything ... the scriptability of the editor is pretty much
unmatched, you can do anything you want PHP Source | PHP View panes, etc.

It is also a RAD environment with support for extensions like this one for

I've been using DW MX for my PHP projects for some time already, so feel

Well for those following my problem, I ended up giving in and mapping a
network location ("//desktop/") for my DocumentRoot in httpd.conf, which
works for now.  Its still the wierd problem I have encountered, the fact
that I could telnet and read the HTTP request but the browsers would spit
out blank pages when interpretting PHP ... Im still thinking it has
something to do with executing processes from other hosts on a local network
since XP comes with this Local Security Manager BS (and ICF).

Anways, thanks for all the ideas and trying to help :-)

Message-ID: <200301152317.SAA24627@gw00.com>

Hi.  Would anyone suggest a (quick & easy?) solution for
integrating an existing PHP application with FedEx shipping?
The task is to feed this "solution" some typical FedEx
shipping fields (ship name, recipient name, service type, etc.)
and return a shipping label, complete with barcode and tracking #.

	I wrote a PHP/curl script to do this simply by posting
form data (via curl/HTTPS) to the FedEx web site (exactly as a
typical customer would do), but suddenly, on Monday, they
re-did their site, and I can't figure out all the new form
fields to POST...!

	FedEx has a "Ship Manager API" solution, but then a
PHP extension would have to be written, and I don't know C
too well.

	Thanks for any comments or suggestions!!!

Best, George.

While it may not hurt to ask, one solution would be to write to the dev
people responsible for the Ship Manager API and ask if they have a SOAP
interface ... I did the same thing w/ PayPal and got a quick response back
(since they were already looking for testers) ... and Im sure FedEx has it
already or its in the works.

Which reminds me to ask ... does anyone know if any automatic form tools
exist in PHP that can create forms + SOAP requests @ the same time (via POST
and SOAP-Action headers).

Everything is there ... I understand the "hosts" under Linux but what would

Subject: Problems with require() and variables
Message-ID: <015c01c2bd18$50dbebd0$2aaf6244@scandinawa1bo6>

Consider this:

I have display.php, a script that will do XML parsing into an array and display its contents.

I have view.php, a script that will include display.php and have to manipulate the variables within display.php for itself.

So in view.php I have:

require('/.../.../display.php');

However, when display.php finishes being "required", I lose all of my variables that I need for view.php.  How do I retain them?? How can I ensure that these variables in display.php will also exist in view.php?

Thanx
Phil

Once it's required, everything that's happened is still there.  It's as if 
you had one big file rather than multiple smaller files.

Chances are you are trying to use those variables in functions in which 
you didn't global the array.

$data = addslashes(fread(fopen($form_data, "r"), filesize($form_data)));
echo $data;

why is it so?
is there some way where i can save the path of the image in the mysql database? i mean, i upload a pict from the desktop and have the path to the directory where i want to save the image. is there a way where i can have the field in the mysql table as :

-----------
"the upload dir path i have specified " + "the image name"
so that i can use this as a link to display the image.

Hi Tracy

Not sure what you are trying to do but when a file is uploaded to a PHP
script by a form then the details are stored in the $_FILES array as
below...

$_FILES['userfile']['name']
The original name of the file on the client machine.

$_FILES['userfile']['type']
The mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An
example would be "image/gif".

$_FILES['userfile']['size']
The size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.

$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']
The temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on
the server.

$_FILES['userfile']['error']
The error code associated with this file upload. ['error'] was added in PHP
4.2.0

Check the section on handling file uploads in the PHP manual and the
functions is_uploaded_file() and move_uploaded_file()
HTH
Rich

Use the FedEx "Ship Manager Direct" product, which lets you connect directly
to an SSL web server to send your transactions and receive replies. It works
great with cURL. It's listed here:

I agree with Jerry. I use Dreamweaver MX also. It has built in 
highlights for php and I like the integration of file management both on 
the local machine and remote machine. Another nice feature is the code 
snippets. I try to reuse code as much as possible (as I'm sure most 
programmers do) and this makes it a little easier.

Subject: New York PHP become the Official Zend Beta Tester Gang!!
Message-ID: <OKEHLLMAFAOHECBMOGEPMELKDLAA.nyphp@websapp.com>

Dear New York PHP Group,

Please keep the information and links information private. This is not a
public beta release and is only available for NYPHP and selected Zend
customers.

Thank you,
Daniel Kushner
Vice President
New York PHP
http://nyphp.org/

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We are happy to inform you that a beta release of Zend Studio 2.6 is now
available. This beta release is available to all existing Zend Studio
customers for evaluation.

You can access the beta package at:  http://nyphp.org/zendbeta.php

This release will be available up until the upcoming official Studio 2.6
launch, in early February.


What's New
**********
We hope that you'll enjoy taking advantage of the new features available,
including:
 - CVS Integration: Perform all your CVS operations, directly from within
the Zend Development Environment
 - Advanced project management capabilities
 - Additional advanced usability features: cross-file searching and bookmark
management, regular expression searching, window cloning, customizable
shortcuts, conditional breakpoints, deeper ftp integration, mousewheel
support
 - Tighter Windows integration, including file system view
 - Improved performance on all platforms
 - Java Runtime v1.41 integration
 - Mousewheel support
 - Many bug fixes (including the infamous flashing window pane bug!)


Feedback
********
Please send all comments and feedback to mailto:beta at zend.com. We want to
hear from you.



System Requirements
*******************
System Requirements for Studio 2.6 remain the same as Studio 2.5
requirements, with the following exceptions:
 - Windows 98 is no longer supported.
 - For Windows 2000 users, it is strongly recommended to install Microsoft's
Service Pack 3.
 - Mac OSX is not yet supported for Studio 2.6. Support will be made
available in the future, in parallel with Apple support for Java JRE 1.4.1.

 - NOTE: Zend Studio 2.6 will support PHP 4.3.  However, the current beta
release is not yet fully compatible with 4.3.

I'm also a fan of DW MX.  Although, regarding highlighting, I haven't found a way to indicate to DW that files with no extension should be treated as PHP.  Anyone done this?

Just a note, that the Zend IDE has all these features, and includes
extensive debugging capabilities.  Breakpoints, watches, everything.

Is there any reference information we should be using when  
communicating with the beta folks at Zend? I'd love to be testing this  
under OS X, and just want to clear up a couple questions with them.  
Should I just mention that I am a nyphp member?

Cheers,

Maybe I'm missing something here, but why exactly are there Cold Fusion jobs
on the NYPHP job board? Especially when the ad says things like "No
Perl/PHP/cgis - strictly Coldfusion"?

There might be PHP people on the list who are in dire need of a job and also happen to know ColdFusion. I think any job is good in this economy. :)

Has anyone been to any of the previous PHP Conferences? More importantly, 
does anyone know how much admission ought to cost? Anyone else thinking of 
going (it's in Amsterdam, May 8th and 9th).

Then maybe they should join a ColdFusion list and look on a ColdFusion job
board. :)

I don't mean to be too snooty about this -- the job board should have
maximum utility for NYPHP members. But if the ads become so general that
there's no difference between the NYPHP job board and searching on
monster.com for web development jobs in NYC, then I don't think that's
maximum utility.

What platform?  It was an easy install on Linux, but then again I chose to 
leave the server form blank as I am not connecting to a Zend server.

Message-ID: <200301162207.RAA25649@gw00.com>

Hi PHP Crew!  

	I wish this job were more an entirely "PHP Job", but
it isn't.  It is probably more of an "HTML job," so some graphics
experience is required.  But PHP is definitely "on the rise" at VTB 
(and its affiliated companies), and this department, the "Internet 
Department," would like to become more technologically independent 
of the I.T. department (or outsourcers), which usually has to do 
even their most basic programming.

	I myself am in the I.T. department at this company, as the 
"web programmer," and I would definitely recommend that the Internet 
department become more independent of I.T.  Maybe someone on this 
list would be both capable and interested.

	Yes, this permanent position is in Shelburne, VT, which
is right next to Burlington.

	So far the applicants have all been over-qualified, which
may not be that surprising.  The best candidate will probably
show speed of producing web pages and associated components
(images, stylesheets, etc.) and will be able to work with some
databases (Access, MySQL) and e-commerce solutions (Yahoo Store,
InterShop, etc.).  Perl and PHP abilities would be the next
priority, I would suppose.

Must be able to manage workload independently and with attention to detail,

 Is Zend IDE also a RAD (Rapid Aplication Development) environment like DM
MX?  It can generate some code for you using what Macromedia calls
exstensions or 'server behaviors'.  This is much more than code snippets.
To gat a better idea take a look at this tutorial:
http://www.macromedia.com/desdev/mx/dreamweaver/articles/record_store.html
You can also write your own DW extensions:
http://www.macromedia.com/desdev/mx/dreamweaver/articles/breadcrumbs.html

I havn't really used much of the RAD functionality of DW MX, since I like to
write all my code by hand, but I can see how much it can speed up web app
development in general. One feature I really like is how DW manages db
connections and dynamic datasets.

Subject: Why doesn't this work: chained ?: expressions
Message-ID: <200301170149.UAA25845@gw00.com>

Hi PHP Team!

	I'm sure "associativity" is the answer to why doesn't this work
as desired, but perhaps someone could suggest how to get this sexy expression
chain to work, and still look sexy:


-----
$input = $argv[1];

$output = preg_match ( '/one/i', $input ) ? '01'
        : preg_match ( '/two/i', $input ) ? '02'
        : preg_match ( '/three/i', $input ) ? '03'
        : preg_match ( '/four/i', $input ) ? '04'
        : '00';

echo "$input => $output\
";
-----


Here is some sample output:
	
one => 04
two => 04
three => 04
four => 04
five => 00

	Obviously this is not the desired result.  Must we fix this
with parentheses, and if so how?  Will it become ugly?  Should I just
use a bunch of "if" statements?

	Thanks for your thoughts!

Consider this:

I have display.php, a script that will do XML parsing into an array and 
display its contents.

I have view.php, a script that will include display.php and have to 
manipulate the variables within display.php for itself.

So in view.php I have:

require('/.../.../display.php');

However, when display.php finishes being "required", I lose all of my 
variables that I need for view.php.  How do I retain them?? How can I ensure 
that these variables in display.php will also exist in view.php?

Thanx
Phil

HI,
I cant understand this:
in a script that is suposed to upload image, i have,
$data = addslashes(fread(fopen($form_data, "r"), filesize($form_data)));
echo $data;
for this i get the following 'echoed':
GIF89a?X?\\0\\0??y`??!?\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0,\\0\\0\\0\\0?X\\0?????????????????H???????? 
??L???????? ?????L*???? ?J??????j???? ??????N????? 
?????????????,(8HXhx????????)9IYiy??????
why is it so?
is there some way where i can save the path of the image in the mysql 
database? i mean, i upload a pict from the desktop and have the path to the 
directory where i want to save the image. is there a way where i can have 
the field in the mysql table as :
image_path
-----------
"the upload dir path i have specified " + "the image name"
so that i can use this as a link to display the image.
if there is a better way to achieve this, plz help me with it.
Thanks

"Q&A with Doron Gerstel, CEO, Co-Founder, Zend Technologies"

Doron has kindly taken time from his busy schedule to address NY's questions
on PHP, Zend, and the community's direction.  Join us and get your questions
answered by Zend's leading man.


January 22,23,24, 2003 @ 3:30pm, NYPHP Booth #16

I have this flyer at work, and try to check the details. I think it is Free,
and, I remember correctly, is a general ongoing pow-wow type of event at
their booth (I may be wrong, though).

Subject: Apache/PHP Authentication
Message-ID: <OF9B5C3590.226DC5FD-ON85256CB1.00546718@un.org>

I would like to use Apache authentication to password protect certain
directories that contain mostly binary files. With 1600+ users, I don't
want to authenticate against a text file, especially as there is already a
mysql database available for the purpose. The webhosting provider doesn't
provide mod_auth.

I'm thinking of using a PHP page to authenticate against the mysql database
and, once a user is authenticated, have the PHP page send the server an
.htaccess user name and password. The latter would be changed from time to
time, but would be the same for all users. High security is not required
here.

I've spent many hours reading around on the web on the subject, but don't
find anything along these lines, and being a rank beginner in PHP, I don't
want to spend time trying to implement this idea if it is unworkable.

Does anybody know of an implementation, or have an idea of whether or not
this could be made to work? Thanks!

Hi,

I'm certainly not an authority on the subject, but it
feels like you need to be at a lower level within
Apache then PHP will get you to.

I would try to use mod_perl to do this, in effect
writing an Apache module in perl.  

good luck,

Paul

Message-ID: <F54XLsxpTljBOh8s4KW0001fc25@hotmail.com>

Greetings all,

The planning for NYPHP's presence at the LinuxWorld Expo is rapidly 
progressing.  The best way to keep tabs on our preparation is to sign up for 
the relatively low traffic NYPHP Development list and the UniLUG Expo 
mailing list: [http://nyphp.org/list/] and 
[http://unilug.org/mailinglists.html]

We're currently looking for volunteers to provide a digital camera or video 
recording equipment so that we can record the Q & A session with Zend 
Technologies CEO Doron Gerstel on Wednesday the 22nd.

If anybody is willing to help record the event or just to provide the 
necessary equipment for the afternoon, please get in touch with Hans or I as 
soon as possible.

Thanks,
Dan

I have an Axis 2120 Network Video Camera (http://www.axis.com) if you have the

as I can bring it with me.

I use PHP to authenticate against mySQL and then store login info in the
session.  Then it's a simple affair to check at the top of each page if the
login info is good, if not divert to login.  I have the code that checks the
login state as a seperate file that I include in all my pages that need to
be secured.

You don't have to add many parenthesis to get it to work right:

$output = preg_match ( '/one/i', $input ) ? '01'
        : (preg_match ( '/two/i', $input ) ? '02'
        : (preg_match ( '/three/i', $input ) ? '03'
        : (preg_match ( '/four/i', $input ) ? '04': '00')));


You could do it with less calls to preg_match() like this:

$map = array ('one' => '01', 'two' => '02',
              'three' => '03', 'four' => '04');
$output = preg_match('/'.join('|',array_keys($map)).'/',$input,$matches)) ?
          $map[$matches[0]] : '00';

You might also want to put some anchors around the "one" "two" "three", etc.
or when $input is "none", $output will be "01".

Brian,

The specs on that look fantastic (embedded Linux OS, direct ethernet output, 
25/10fps), and it looks like it would be great for our needs.

So it basically needs a Windows, Linux, or Mac laptop to be hooked up to?  
Do you have the software to connect it to all of those or just a PC?

I just realized that I don't have the audio module for this Axis camera right 
now, so given that audio would probably be desireable, please disregard my 
last post.

Message-ID: <OKEHLLMAFAOHECBMOGEPEEABDMAA.nyphp@websapp.com>

Good Morning!

As most have seen, we have set up a NYPHP Job Board (http://jobs.nyphp.org).
I would like to thank David Sklar (http://sklar.com for donating his time to
administer the project.

I believe that this board will become an important asset to NYPHP's members
and the PHP job market in general.  I am asking you, as a member of NYPHP,
to
send any jobs either directly to David at sklar at sklar.com or to post them on
the board.  If you think that you can send David 2-3 jobs a day, and would
like recognition as a NYPHP Job Board member at
http://nyphp.org/principals.php please send me an email (daniel at nyphp.org)
and we'll take it from there.


Best regards,

Daniel Kushner

They are great devices, the video quality is decent and they have FTP, SMTP 
and a lot of other features.  The video servers allow custom scripts in PHP3 
which is how I got involved with the company I now work for, one of the 
largest resellers in the Northeast.

If anyone is interested, you can hit my camera from the web and see my street 
in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.  Take it easy on the server, however, they have 
trouble with more than 10 concurrent connections.  Higher traffic sites 
require constant FTPing of images to a refreshed image on a web page.
http://141.155.36.87:69

The capture would be written directly to a hard drive simply by saving the 
image file.  It creates a motion jpeg that can then be converted to AVI, 
mpeg, or whatever format is needed.  Obviously an event like this Q&A session 
could also be webcast from the same camera.

WRT your problems chaining ?: statements, PHP has ** a different

backwards compatibility. It certainly does lead to a high WTF factor,
however.

That's wierd.  I have a P3 700 Mhz compaq armada with 320 MB of ram, and
Zend Studio 2.6 b runs fast on my system, and I average around 50-60 gui
apps per session: at least 3 emacs windows, divided again into multiple
buffers, 10-12 aterms, evolution, mozilla (5-6 copies), gaim, xchat,
openoffice (3-4 copies), straw, and then any non-standard programs on
top of that.  I'm not even counting the shell programs I run regularly,
vi, ssh, gcc, autoconf, find, apt-get.  Any operating system that can't
handle Zend Studio with those specs, should be taken out and shot.

As for os independence, it supports FreeBSD, OSX, Linux and Windows
flawlessly; I don't know what you define as platform independent, but
that combination works for me :-)

Hi,
You may use $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] and $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'] to simulate HTTP authentication
similar to Apache's own internal one. You need to ask for these variables using :

if(!isset($PHP_AUTH_USER)) {
	Header("WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\\"Security Checking!!!\\"");
	Header("HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized");
	echo  "Authentication Problem...\
";
	exit;
	}

or similar code. After this step $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] and $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'] will be
defined by Apache and stored to the session (I'm not talking about Php sessions) for future
references. You need to put above code to the 'index.php' (and may be to the others also) and need
to check those two variables on all other secured pages (from database off course) to ensure
security.

I hope this helps

Best

Hi,

I'm certainly not an authority on the subject, but it
feels like you need to be at a lower level within
Apache then PHP will get you to.

I would try to use mod_perl to do this, in effect
writing an Apache module in perl.

good luck,

Paul

Hi All,

After custom coding my video game site for the past 3 years, I've decided to
rewrite the whole thing from scratch.

Instead of re-inventing the wheel, I'm looking for good PHP "packages" that
I'll be able to use.

I am NOT looking for a portal in a box.

I AM looking for packages that provide "building blocks" that will allow me
to create a site.

Can any one recommend anything ?

Thanx
Ophir

In an earlier incarnation I was a Professor of English, and I will be happy 
to check over any proposed language for future materials to make sure it's 
clear, correct, and clean.  Sorry that I haven't been able to offer this 
for the LWE materials, but in the future I should be able to help in this

Along these same lines, preg_replace() can be called with arrays.  See the 
manual for more info.

Good morning,

I've made some long deserved mailing list tweaks, that should have improved
performance and stability.

I also did an audit of user accounts and email addresses.  It seems that
there were several registered accounts, but without a related email address. 
This problem has been corrected, and everyone's account should be inline with
the correct email addresses.

I urge everyone to login and check that their account info is correct
(especially the email addresses), and that they are subscribed to the proper
lists (and don't forget the two new lists!).

If anything looks off, or you can't login, please don't hesitate to contact
me at hans at nyphp.org

Thank you,

Something like this would be great.  It'd be invaluable to have experienced
eyes look over our text and help us get it proper.  Give me a shout, Michael,
and hopefully I'll see you at LWE or our meeting next week.

Hi,

  I was just wondering what the going rate for freelance (NYC) PHP 
programmers was? I have a client that says she is getting scores of 
resumes where guys are charging less then $20 an hour. I had assumed it 
was about $40 - $50 these days.

thanks

I think there's some major league low balling going on. I bid for a project and was told by the company about the competing bids. People are looking for anything they can get, and don't want to risk overbidding. I think you'd need an impressive history, good sales pitch and good clients to get $40-$50 with consistency these days.

I think you're both right. There are a lot of people who'll work for even $10/hour (even for free). But there are also others that get paid well over $40/hr. 

If it's a question of fairness, i think the latter is more like it. However, you can't completely ignore something called 'supply and demand'. I would try to let them know that you probably have more experience than those people and can get the job done faster and better. If you can differentiate yourself and build a trust relationship with the people involved, I am willing to believe that they'd still pay you the fair rate.

Ed,

    I charge anywhere from 80-120+ an hour. Completely depends on the job,
and the company.
    Someone wanted me to do a job at 3am once, to save their company because
their huge ecommerce site was launching the same day, and it wasn't working.
Obviously, I'd take this into consideration, too. I charged ~250/hr.
    Honestly, I think charging 40-50/hr isn't professional ($10/hr is almost
childish -- Babysitters charge more.). If you're a beginner just trying to
get some money, perhaps that fee is appropriate -- but if you're a
professional who knows your stuff and know you can get the job done faster
then most others, I defiantly believe that a higher price is more than
acceptable.

Food for thought.
-Bradley Baumann

Hi Edward,

This is a tricky question, and the current economic situation doesn't help.
First and foremost, you get what you pay for - in most cases. Programmers
working at a rate of $20/hour could not be considered professional. Sure
their code will (might) work, but is it optimized? Is it secure? Will it
work under high loads?
I have consulted companies, where 'cheap' programmers where hired to do the
job. After one hour of looking at the code, I found countless security flaws
and no optimization what so ever. When you ask why there is only one
function in the whole application and the answer is: "Well, I only found out
last week that there are functions in PHP", you can fully understand where
the $20/hour comes from.
It's true that we all need to start somewhere, and that's where you'll find
those guys. The fact that companies are hiring them to build major
applications is wrong, but in most cases, they either find this out later on
in life, or their application never gets launched, so the faults are never
found.
What can we do about it? Try to explain this to the hiring company.
Sometimes it work!

I've got a sliding scale.  For friends and non-profit's I'm friendly with,
I charge $45/hr.  For small to medium companies, it goes up to $60-75.  
This last category, if there's an emergency not of my making, I'll bill 
$120.  If I landed a large corporate gig, I'd want $90.

Just to be clear, these rates involve working from my office as a
contractor, not from a client's location.

Of course, a kid out of college generally couldn't charge this.  I feel
comfortable with these rates due to several years of experience, am
meticulous and innovative plus write code that's efficient, readable and
documented.

I've got several ideas in the works to revamp my website to better put 
these points forth.

Enjoy,

--Dan

While I charge around the same, I don't think "unprofessional" is the
right word for charging less.  I'm as busy as I'd like to be at this
point (although I'll always consider new projects :-), so my rate works
for my experience and contacts.  But, if I needed work, given my current
experience, and someone offered me a job for $10, I'd jump.  Jobs lead
to experience and contacts, and you can always renegotiate for further
work. Professional or unprofessional, your rate is what you can get,
when the offers start pouring in, then you can charge at your liking.
:-)

With that said, I think the original poster should hold out for more. 
$20 a hour is low.  State your advantages over a programmer that charges
$20.  But if you can't get them up, then you need to decide: do you have
a better offer?  Evaluate the opportunity cost and don't let pride get
in the way.

Jumping at a low rate has a tendency to put you in a low pay bracket for any 
future work that may come out of it.  People start passing out your name as 
'the cheap guy' and that type of pigeon-holing is a trend that is difficult 
to change. 

That may be easy for me to say, since I am not at a loss for projects at the 
moment either.  I will say that it was necessary for me to cut some of the 
cheap ties lately and make contacts in bigger companies with bigger budgets 
and with a better understanding of quality work.

Sterling,

    I think that "unprofessional" was a bad word to have chosen, I believe
that the phrase I was looking for was "the amount you charge is a direct
reflection of your working skill / ability."
    If you're hiring a big-shot that knows his/her stuff, doesn't screw
around, and write innovative, well commented and well thought-out code --
They're going to charge you for it. You will -not- find one of those people
charging $10/hr. You're going to find them charging you $90+/hr. It's common
sense in the business-world (and any other world you're living in) to charge
more for better services.
    If someone charges you $10/hr -- it's a job you want to turn down
(unless you're a beginner). If you know the people, and want to help them
out or be friendly, that's a -completely- different story. If it's a
professional relationship, and they are offering you an obscenely low
amount, I would deny it. It's almost insulting. If I were to take the job, I
would not give them everything that a client giving me $90+/hr would be
getting.

Of course, and when that time comes you can say, "I'm sorry, but my rate
is no longer XXX an hour.  Because of the quality of my work, I'm very
busy and my rate is UUU.  Since you're an old client, I'll only charge
you ZZZ."

XXX == cheap rate
ZZZ == exorbinant rate minus a little
UUU == exorbinant rate

If they don't want to pay you, then you can move onto your other
clients, and they will probably still have a good taste in their mouth
because you tried to accomodate them, and hopefully give you more
expensive work when they find it.  If they are willing to pay you, then
great, you're only giving them a small discount for one project, and it
may lead to a continuing relationship at the rate you're currently
charging.

This is a good point ... but recently the whole hiring process has made me
sick, including a recent "would you work for back pay?" ... Im thinking of
leaving the entire software area for a long time till things get ironed out,
you have people trying to hire you not even knowing what *they* want, you
have software platforms that sometimes change from one release to another
literally overnight ... on top your work can't even be "creative" and "fun"
anymore, you have to adhere to strict guidelines which are barely ever
taught, you have 100 different books by 100 different programmers on the
same subject using 100 different methods to do 1 single thing and then you
have this term "freelance" in which people think the word "free" in there
actually has a different term besides "free to do other things @ the same
time" ...

I was fortunate to land a 3 month LAMP project to keep things afloat but I
can't see beyond it and will probably move to hardware/reselling/training or
selling.  Id also recommend the individual hold out for more money despite
the economy but there could be other factors, question is how much you can
live for to decide on whether the job (and probably headaches) are worth.

A great story about the cost/value question.  I started my business almost 2
years ago.  I have 19 years in the business so knew that my experience
should allow for high rates, but my lack of name recognition as an
independent would work against me.  Rather than start my rates at the $90 I
felt I should be able to get, I started at $70.  I also factored my cost of
living, extra cost for running the business, and an expectation of 20
billable hours per week and came up with $60 would be the minimum I would
need to live on if I obtained the 20 billable per week.  I had no bites.  I
finally had a great lead which would lead to the potential for much future
work, but they didn't want to pay over $50, this was with me stating the $70
hr. rate.  Since the potential was great, we settled on $55 hr for the first
project, each project thereafter would be a new negotiation with the
understanding that I would over time attempt to get the rate up to my $70.

Well experience pays off, my next couple projects were at $60, then $65, now
at $70.  On top of all that, they have lots of other projects ongoing with
other consultants.  They even have one project billing out at $10 an hour.
Wouldn't you know that many of their lowball projects have encountered many
problems at delivery time with no end in sight as to when the problems would
be corrected.  They have pulled me in to correct the problems fully
understanding that my corrections would take more time because I would need
to familurize myself with what was done by the other programmer.  They now
rarely contract any real projects for the person willing to lowball because
they finally understand the concept of getting what you pay for and don't
want to have to pay me to correct the problems caused by the low ballers.

Well ... I beleive with a good PKI in place, online voting will eventually
take place despite what the article says :-)

I read once a good paper on a voting example with SOAP and PGP (secure SOAP
ballots) that seemed to make sense but never went anywhere (the model was
similar to micropayments and the XML model for that).

Good simple effective idea :-)

Does anyone know of a good Apache logfile analysis program that recognizes 
the difference between GET query pages (like "page.php?section=about" and 
"page.php?section=news")? I have a large site we're about to launch, and we 
need to be able to distinguish between template-driven pages. Hopefully, I 
won't have to write my own grep-based solution!

I've never noted which analyzers do what you speak of, but my favorite is
Webalizer (http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/) and I've worked with Analog a
bit (http://www.analog.cx/).  Some other possibly useful links:

Subject: Cannot show reuploaded image file on page unless manual refresh
Message-ID: <03e701c2c0cd$cb833ec0$2aaf6244@scandinawa1bo6>

I am using the following header() functions to force view.php to not cache:

header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT");    // Date in the past
header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT"); 
                                                     // always modified
header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate");  // HTTP/1.1
header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false);
header("Pragma: no-cache");                          // HTTP/1.0


However, when a user reuploads a file in manage.php, it does a form post onto manage.php and reuploads the file (which I verified works).  However, when redirected via header() to view.php, they still see their OLD image file, NOT the new one!  Unless I manually refresh the page, they never see it, until they manually refresh the page, then the new image file appears!  

I am handling file uploading this way:  If they select another file to upload, the old file is deleted and the new file uploaded.

Any suggestions?

Thanx
Phil

I think you killed it.

Right.

I think you are forgetting that the image is not really
part of the PHP resource. Meaning, this is the series of
events for a PHP script that refernces a single image
called bar.jpg using the <img> tag:

1. HTTP request sent for foo.php (Web client -> Web server)
2. HTTP response sent that includes the output of foo.php
   (Web server -> Web client)
3. Web client (browser) notices <img> tag referenced in
   the HTML.
4. HTTP request sent for bar.jpg (Web client -> Web server)
5. HTTP response sent that includes bar.jpg

So, the headers that you are setting only matter for the
resource returned in step 2. Meaning, the HTML output of
foo.php is not cached. The image, since it is returned by
the Web server and not your PHP script, is cached.

Chris

I'm having a day, gang!

I have done nothing to my code and now is_uploaded_file is constantly false, even when uploading a file every time.  I dunno what to do, would someone want to look at my code and tell me what I did wrong; I'm out of ideas.

I probably explained this poorly. The main point I was
trying to make is that images are completely separate
resources. They are not part of a page as you seem to be
thinking, even though they appear to be once rendered in
your browser.

While a request for view.php results in a response that
includes all of those headers you explicitly set, a request
for blah.jpg gets returned by the Web server directly. It
is probably being cached by the browser.

However, the Web client usually includes an
If-Modified-Since header that will cause the Web server to
return a fresh resource if it has in fact been modified.

Is there a way you can show us the HTTP transactions for
the image in question both before and after it has been
modified?

 Aha! Something I can chime in on. I happened across the same scenario a
few months back. The list helped me then so I'll give back.

 Call the image using a random identifier.

$rand = rand(1000, 9999);

echo "<img src="http://someurl.com/image.jpg?$rand";

Since the browser will more than likely not have the image file identified
by the random number it must request it again from the server. Works
great where I need it!

Just a thought: maybe you moved some files around so your server
is 301/302 Redirecting to your script.  If you post to one URL,
I don't think the posted data will actually get posted to the
redirected URL.

Or, are you sure the script you're editing (or as you said, you're
*not* editing) is the script which the server is serving?  As a
check, you could thrown some fatal syntax error in to see if that
crashes your script via HTTP.  If your script still runs, you're
editing the wrong script.  This happens to me often in a multi-server
environment when I'm editing the file on the wrong server.

I'm all about the idiot checks.  Or more accurately, I should be!


Best, George.

Phil, I'm sure we can see the problem by looking just at the client-side,
since it sounds like an HTTP issue.  But could you show us the rest of
the source for view.php?

	Specifically, does view.php actually print out an image, i.e.
does it set Header ( 'Content-type: image/jpeg' ) or other image type?

	Or does it then do another redirect (e.g. 
Header ( 'Location: /other/path/imageNNN.jpg' )?

	If it's the latter, your no-cache magic won't apply.  You have
to do the former, or find some other way to set the no-cache stuff
for the images.  (In that case I think Apache has a directive or two
you can use to force no-cache.)

	Of course, if these images are to get repeatedly hit by the
same client, you waste bandwidth and CPU time if you keep sending the
same image (i.e. defeating the cache).  So you should harness the HTTP
caching protocol prudently.


Best, George.

HTTP protocol is far beyond me, I'm sorry.

What I did in view.php is simple: I am now generating a random string inside
the image URL, so that when you upload an image you get something like this:

Kd0SLDSdslasdfasdOWKDC_60.jpg

the first part of the URL is a random string that causes a fresh new URL to
appear everytime you upload a new image and then go to view.php.  I figured
that was the best way of handling the image URL caching issue, since HTTP
protocols are honestly out of my league.

I would add the modification time of the file in question with

filetime($filename);

that way you will be sure to get a unique argurment.

You can buy HTTP Developer's Handbook. It introduces HTTP
from a Web developer's perspective and uses PHP as the
primary language for examples. It is not being printed
until the end of February, but you can order it from Amazon
at http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672324547/.

And this works, correct? I feel certain that we could have
solved your earlier problem a better way, but if this works
for you, don't look back. :-)

> HTTP protocols are honestly out of my league.

A little knowledge of HTTP can go a long way in terms of
developing applications for the Web. It's not nearly as
advanced as it may seem, and it can help you resolve some
otherwise difficult problems. Even a small overview can
give you an enlightened perspective about the way the Web
works.

O'Reilly has a pocket reference for less than $10.

Have you considered going to a .htaccess & $path_info driven approach for
your variables?
can do things like

/section/news/ instead of /page.php?section=news
and
/whatever/about/staff/joebob/ instead of
/page.php?section=about&subsect=staff&person=joebob

when done properly, even Apache can't tell it's not butter, and all log
analyzers treat your urls as legitimate files. and it all looks a lot more
elegant.

would be pretty easy to implement on an existing site - would just need to
control link generation and add some parsing near the top...

i forget the url that got me going on  this, but poke around on google for
path_info, htaccess and search engine friendly URLs

PS - webalizer is -good-, but clueless about query strings. works like a
charm in a setup with path_info tho

Tracy,

    I think your goal needs some clarification. I have no idea what it is
that you're trying to do. Chances are PHP can do whatever it is you need,
but with this, I really don't know.

Explain yourself.

I think this could be a start for command line I/O with PHP

Analog can do this and MUCH more.
It even breaks it down to something like:

500 requests total for page.php
200 for page.php?section=a
100 for page.php?something=blah
etc.

It's also probably the fastest logfile analysis program out there.

Only two downsides:
1. The output isn't as pretty as some other packages, but there's even a
program called report magic which ads nice graphs to the output.
2. It's not as user friendly as it could be. (you'll need to read the docs
if you want to change anything).

For more info, see http://www.analog.cx/

Hi All,

After custom coding my video game site for the past 3 years, I've decided to
rewrite the whole thing from scratch.

Instead of re-inventing the wheel, I'm looking for good PHP "packages" that
I'll be able to use.

I am NOT looking for a portal in a box.

I AM looking for packages that provide "building blocks" that will allow me
to create a site.

Can any one recommend anything ?

Thanx

Subject: [nycphp-talk] NYC Freelance rates
Message-ID: <se2d2836.043@mail.ipro.org>

I was gone all weekend so I'm late to the rate party, but after 6 years in NYC I have a few notes:

If the job pays less than $50 an hour and you want it for referral purposes, do it for free.
If you want to compete with similar skilled peers, you have to charge similar rates.
Small businesses pay plumbers $50 an hour. They should be paying you at least that.
$80 seems to be a rule of thumb, economy schmonomy. Just because there's a bad economy, it doesn't deflate your rate, it just deflates your chance of getting the job. PLENTY of people are getting full rate work.
Customers who want it cheap can never handle project creep. You'll end up making enemies.

For the record: my base rate is $125 with a month lead time, scales up depending on how much notice and what kind of emergency it is. My major selling point is I can work twice as fast and twice as efficiently as any 40-50 an hour guy. Sell your experience and skills, if it's too expensive for them you probably shouldn't take the job. At worst, find someone who does want the job and reap a 10% commission.

I think there's some major league low balling going on. I bid for a project and was told by the company about the competing bids. People are looking for anything they can get, and don't want to risk overbidding. I think you'd need an impressive history, good sales pitch and good clients to get $40-$50 with consistency these days.

"Join the MySQL Founders and Architects for an informal "Birds-of-a-Feather"

the oermissions system's lowest rung is member, they have no access to the cms but they can view pages assigned a "member" status - there are groups and users, but it's just the architecture, you'll need to make the various modules. maybe some already done in dev, check the group in yahoo.

comments / personalization isn't built-in, but it's easy enough to add.

I picked sitellite out of about 10 packages for a few vaguely remembered reasons: here's what I can drag out ofmemory

most cms I use make it impossible to refine the layout beyond three columns lots of boxes, this one is way more open
no redundant code (that I could find)
the site was federal money, so needed to be section 508 compliant, this one seemd to be the most 508 capable
code was extremely well documented within the code, well laid out, obvious attention to detail within
the product seemed young enough to not yet have a bunch of feature creep and code bloat all over it (which was true)
not free, but not expensive - I wanted to pay *something*. I haven't yet, though, no matter how hard I try.
xhtml / css ready

thats what I can remember at least

It looks pretty good for cms stuff.
My biggest concern is that the site I'm making is very user centric.
Users will be able to register / add comments / vote / etc.
Does sitellite already have user authentication / group management stuff it
in ? (not the site editors themselves).
If not do u think it would be hard to add it ?

Also - I'm wondering why u picked sitellite (and not the tons of other
packages).

Again, thanx for your time,

Absolutely, been using it for over a year now. www.ipro.org runs it - 20k
uniques a month, as does my test site mynameismonkey.com - one word of
advice, php accelerator. w/o it I'd be effed.

It's a breeze to work with, doesn't take control of your content or layout,
and is easily extended.

Support is iffy, there's a yahoo dev group but the project is still pretty
small user wise IMO. Documentation is lacking, mostly due to the fact that
it's mostly one guy and he releases faster than he can document :o)

We'd like to start tracking visitors to our sites based on cookies in order
to compare the results with our traditional apache log crunching method,
Analog.

As I'm searching the web for packages and other info, can anyone here
comment on their experience doing something like this?

You could also correct, if necessary, my assumption that the best way to
track visitors is to use a combination of log examination and cookie storage
since both have faults.

Thanks!

Hmm... are you looking for clickstream analysis (watching users' paths through
the site)?  If that is your goal then this bit might help...

What I've done is added the storage of cookies in the apache log format.  This
in conjunction with cookie-based php sessions (or your own custom cookie based
sessions) will allow you to do clickstream analysis.  If you don't use sessions,
I believe the Apache mod_usertrack module will give you a similar result.

Here's an example from my httpd.conf file for the log format that includes
cookies:
    LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \\"%r\\" %>s %b \\"%{Referer}i\\" \\"%{User-Agent}i\\" \\"%{Cookie}i\\"" combinedcookie
...which adds \\"%{Cookie}i\\" to log the stock combined log format.

Then you need a log analysis tool that knows how to use that cookie data to
track the user's path through your site, and that is where my experience ends,
as I've only done the setup and left the rest up to clients.  I believe
WebTrends does such things, but costs $$$ ...

Regards,
Andrew

Cowgill, these talks are for those interested in PHP internals, performance
and enterprise PHP development.  Few know PHP like these guys, so you won't
want to miss their insight.

And then, join Community Connect Recruiter David Dankin to explore the PHP
job market and check out available positions at CC.  What a great way to
start a year!

One important note, however, is that NYPHP monthly meetings have been moved
to the 4th Tuesday of the month (1/28/03).

As always this meeting is free and open to the public, with complete meeting
and location details at http://nyphp.org

I'd also like to point out NYPHP's new job board.  It's still developing, but
going strong.  Check it out at http://jobs.nyphp.org and send your available
positions to jobs-submit at nyphp.org.

Thank you,

That page links to two EXEs (self-extracting zip files with sample 
IIFs).  I'll email you the HTML plus the two EXEs separately 
(off-list).

I know lots about bookkeeping and using IIF files for entering 
transactions into QuickBooks Pro, so feel free to ask me any followup 
questions.

Subject: How do I find email patterns in a query string in a text and urlescape them?
Message-ID: <010701c2c1b6$a0dcf8c0$2aaf6244@scandinawa1bo6>

If I have a text of string like this:

$stuff = "Hi my name is Phil, my email is xx at yy.com and you can find me at http://www.xx.yy?username=xx at yy.com";

What I want to do is to "validate" all patterns resembling an email address EXCEPT those found within the query string of a URL.  I would want to to urlencode(\\\\1) somehow onto the email address pattern found within the query string of the URL to ensure that it is not "validated" like any other email address (validate means to convert xx at yy.com to <a href=mailto:xx at yy.com>xx at yy.com</a>).

Can anyone figure this out for me? I tried using pattern matching and eval() but the results were completely wrong:

function VALIDATE_URL($stuff) {
   $stuff = preg_replace('/[\
\\r]/', '<br>', $stuff);
   $stuff = preg_replace('/\\.\\./', ' . .', $stuff);
   // URL ESCAPE ALL EMAIL ADDRESSES FOUND WITHIN QUERY STRINGS TO ENSURE PROPER VALIDATION
   // IF USING VALIDATE_EMAIL
   $stuff = preg_replace('/([\\?&][a-zA-Z0-9]+=)([a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.]+@([a-zA-Z0-9_\\-]+\\.)+[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-]+)/', '\\\\1' . '<? $stuff = urlencode("\\\\2"); echo $stuff; ?>', $stuff);
   $stuff = eval('?>' . $stuff);
   $stuff = preg_replace('/(http[s]?:\\/\\/([a-zA-Z0-9_\\-]+\\.)+(\\/[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.\\~\\^,%\\+]+)*[^<\\(\\)> ]+)/', '<a href=\\\\1 target=_new>\\\\1</a>', $stuff);
   return preg_replace('/ \\. \\./', '..', $stuff);
  }

Thanx
Phil

Hi,
I was able to get to the link and attached a couple of the
files..

It should be easy to create these file on the fly...
e.g.

if(!$iif_file = fopen("test.iif","w")) {
  print "Couldn't open file";
} else {
fputs($iif_file,"!SPL\	TRNSID\	TRNSTYPE\	DATE\	ACCNT\	NAME\	
AMOUNT\	DOCNUM\	MEMO\	CLEAR\
");
fputs($iif_file,"!TRNS\	TRNSID\	TRNSTYPE\	DATE\	ACCNT\	NAME\\
tAMOUNT\	DOCNUM\	MEMO\	CLEAR\
");

snip ....

fclose($iif_file);
}

I just noticed that too.  I had *heard* that it was going to be free even for
onsite registering, however the site obviously states otherwise.  You might
want check on the unilug.org or nylug.org mailing lists, as they may know
more.

Best,

Hans

Hi Phil:

Before I get started, in the future, please fix your email software so it
wraps lines at around 77 characters.  That'll save everyone who wants to
help you some time not having to reformat your emails.

So, why not just skip over whatever's a URI and then do the validate
whatever's left?  Before we start giving you code, I just wanted to check
that this direction is acceptable.

You've gotten a lot of could advice on this tough question. There are a 
lot of people with poor programming practices who are very confident and 
charge very little. I can't tell you how many MS Access based systems 
I've replaced. Not that Access is bad, it just seems the wizards were 
used to create the systems.

What I tend to do is put a cap on the hours I will charge or even offer 
a flat fee. Most of the $20 hour people aren't willing to do that, or if 
they do, will hit the cap and drop the project. Of course, this requires 
a well defined project scope which can be tough to do when people don't 
know what they want. But if you can strictly define the scope, you can 
also provide a completion date up front. The client needs to be able to 
compare the proposals and see that yours is much more complete than the 
low baller's.

I always make sure I "give" them something. Initial analysis is free is 
they grant the project to me, otherwise I charge them an analysis rate. 
I submit $0.00 invoices for things I do outside the scope of the 
project, like troubleshooting a printing problem for a user. If this 
happens a lot, you can start charging them. At the very least you show 
them your other talents.

I picked up a number of clients who have me come in on a regular basis 
for preventive maintenance. In one sense I am one of those $20/hour 
people, but that's what I charge for updating virus definitions.

There has been a lot of useful info in this thread.  One thing that I 
didn't see mentioned (besides the hordes of unemployed programmers who 
are willing to work quite cheaply) is that you are also competing 
against overseas people - India, Russia, etc.

I know of one company in NYC who is employing a Bulgarian firm.  They 
have skilled, competent programmers, and the rate is $10/hour - $10/hour 
that the U.S. firm is paying out, so who knows what the Bulgarians are 
getting individually for a salary, but it isn't much.

There are lots of situations where foreign outsourcing isn't really an 
option, and in those cases contract programmers can expect to continue 
to demand decent wages.  But if we invented teleportation tomorrow, 
plumbers wouldn't command $80/hour any more, because you could teleport 
in skilled plumbers from Bulgaria who would work for a tenner and then 
teleport them right back home.  That is happening now with any project 
that can be outsourced overseas.  So watch out, and really cunning 
programmers will look for market segments where they *aren't* competing 
against overseas labor.

greetings folks,


well, i work for NYC company for 6 months free,
on some projects,
doing more than just PHP(,net\\vb\\perl), just to get my H1 visa,
i think, you should charge per project, not  Per hour,
that what i do, after you got the project done, you charge BTH.
for service.
give a fair price for the project,
and keep everyone happy.

funny story, the only company that wanted to 
give me a full time job,
and pay for my H1 had an openning
for A+ and networking shit.
i remember saying the hell with it, why not?!,
the very next day, 
i got my first call 
it was a man with window XP,
the problem? my mouse want move.
i shake it, i tilt it, nothin', he sad.
i put him on hold, 
and quit, work as bus boy for 2 months,
until i got the other gig.   ^_^

just a personal story,
and i know alot of people that tryed
to get H1 via companies just to relocate from other countries,
guess some of them here


best regards,
louie.

While this is all true, I know of companies contracting overseas firms for
cheap only to end up with undocumented code or documentation in the language
of the country...so this can be just another strong selling point for a
higher rate...

Today was the first day of exhibits at LinuxWorld Expo 2003, and although
they say the economy is weak, you wouldn't know it by attending the show. 
The floor was packed with all the major IT companies (yes, even Microsoft),
and the crowd was thick from 10:00-5:00.

The UNILUG booth was a buzz of activity, and NYPHP was right in the middle of
things.  Thanks to all who stopped by today, and especially the staffers
behind the booth.  And of course a big thanks to Doron Gerstel, CEO, Zend
Technologies for fielding questions, and Sterling Hughes for the book raffle.

Tomorrow the show continues, and those who didn't get a chance to stop by
today are encouraged to do so tomorrow or Friday.  If you're interested in
staffing the UNILUG/NYPHP booth tomorrow, please contact me at
hans at nyphp.org.  I will also be in and around the booth throughout the day
and Friday afternoon.

Thanks to Michael, Adam and Kayra for pictures.  If there are any other
pictures out there, let me know and we'll include them in the photo gallery
after the expo.

Special thanks to UNILUG for reserving the booth and letting NYPHP be a part
of it.

Subject: mysql_pconnect() problems with PHP 4.3.0 anyone?
Message-ID: <200301230624.BAA02652@gw00.com>

Hi NYPHPeeps... I am jealous to be out of the area during the LWE...
I hope you are loving it.

	Has anyone noticed any occasional failures with mysql_pconnect()
failing to reconnect using PHP version 4.3.0?  I would assume the
desired operation would be for PHP to silently reconnect any persistent
connection which seems to have died.  However the following fatal error
(it's hardly a "warning!") occurs somewhat frequently now, with PHP
4.3.0 (Apache module sapi) and MySQL 3.23.54 on RH Linux 7.1/Apache 1.3.27.
Also, the MySQL server is on a remote machine, so mysql_pconnect() is using
TCP/IP.

	I suppose that dropped connections is not the problem;
rather, the problem is that mysql_pconnect() fails to *reconnect*.

	Of course I don't see why the connection would have dropped;
the server was not restarted and there are no networking failures.

	If I can't figure it out, I guess we'll go back to using
mysql_connect(), wouldn't you agree?  Has anyone else noticed anything 
similar?  The PHP.net manual entry for mysql_pconnect() 
( http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-pconnect.php )
shows a user comment suggesting that 4.3.0 might be the problem.

	Below is the phpinfo() mysql section.  Thanks for your thoughts.

But Hans looks so debonair!

Generally, the light in there was somewhat confusing for my camera. It

It's a DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) pad. The game flashes directions
at you and you have to tap the right key with your feet. Rule #1 of
demoing a DDR pad at a linux show: get some women to do it for you.

At one time I was looking for webcam portals and general cam programs and I 
could not find many.  Hotscripts yielded one webcam portal program -- 
http://www.hotscripts.com/Detailed/18858.html -- as well as a PHP-Nuke 
module.  There were a couple on Sourceforge but if I recall correctly they 
were in Perl.  It could be an interesting project if anyone would be willing 
to take it on.

What's the fatal error?  Is it something like what's at:

Sometimes it's a timeout issue.  Take a look at the user comments at
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-pconnect.php

Oh, you already did look at the user comments  :)  I've had pconnects working
in production for over a year with  no problems, albeit 4.0.6 for the most
part.  However, I have heard a slight buzz about problems with 4.3.0's
pconnect, although I can't say what they are.  Unless you have very high
traffic, I'd go with mysql_connect() anyway.

understanding we are in a tough economy, i still bill at least $80/
hour.
you get what you pay for and someone charging $20/per hour might
just be worth $20/per hour. one thing to remember, php is a great
language, and can allow someone with little experience to write crappy
code that that will still work. what i also find just wheeling and
dealing
in business is that people trying to get work cheap will say will say
much
more then , "she is getting scores of resumes where guys are charging
less then $20 an hour". it's all a game and if a potential client is
going
to
try to pull that one i often will not even bother with them. i don't
need to
stress myself out dealing with people who want something for nothing.
those types of clients are also the ones who will call you every 5
minutes
wanting to change something. my suggestion is to leave that work for the
script kiddies because they still have to pay there dues.

there was an artical about this topic in New Architect this month. Maybe
that is where you got that from? basically if someone wants to deal with
an
international firm they'll find out that there getting more than they
bargined for.
In reverse trywriting for someone india (wrox) if they can get the work
done
so cheap in there country why are they contracting american programmers.

Hi,

Does anyone know of a list of download sites that cater mainly for PHP
authors. I have just released a PHP image utility as shareware, and would
like to upload it to the most appropriate sites.

This is my first post to this list - been lurking for a week or so; hi to
all - hope this isn't an inappropriate post?

All the best,

Hope to see you and everyone else there.  It should be a very interesting

Message-ID: <20030125023440.21094.qmail@web12801.mail.yahoo.com>


Good evening,

I'd like to thank everyone who stopped by the UNILUG/NYPHP booth.  It was
great meeting all of you, some old, many new.  If our booth at LWE is any
indication, PHPCon should be fantastic.  After a couple of weeks, we plan to
get PHPCon planning underway.  There's a lot to be done, but I think with the
support we've seen so far, there should be no problem, and if anyone wants to
lend a hand, there's tons to be done.

And of course a big thanks to Daniel, Daniel, Michael, Adam and Fil for
helping out with everything over the last couple of days.

We have three book raffle winners:

-- David Chan
-- Peter Lehrer
-- Carl Romano

We will bring the books to our next meeting, this Tuesday, 1/28/03 at 6:30pm.
 If you can't make it Tuesday, please let me know, and we can try to work
something out.

Best Regards,

Message-ID: <20030125211846.37663.qmail@web12805.mail.yahoo.com>


Hi folks,

I'm playing with some daemonized scripts (fork(),setsid(),fork()) and could
use the functionality of setitimer()/getitimer() system calls.  This is
[obviously] for CLI scripts.

I haven't seen any indication of this functionality in php.net's function
list, and am wondering if I've just missed this, or if anyone has any ideas
on implementing this another way.

Thanks,

Subject: Regular Expressions + URL
Message-ID: <003301c2c511$681de220$de01a8c0@duron.lan.newageweb.com>

I'm trying to get rid of a specific name=value pair from a URL (query
string).
In this case it's baked=any_value. Note that it may appear in different
context and removing additional preceding or trailing characters (& and/or
?) may be required.  Here are the 4 different cases:
...?baked=any_value&...   (as the first but not only name=value pair)
...?baked=any_value    (as the only name=value pair)
...&baked=any_value&...   (between other name=value pairs)
...&baked=any_value   (as the last of many name=value pairs)

I solved this with these 3 lines of code:

   $uri = ereg_replace('&?baked=[^&]*','',$uri);     // ? == {,1}
   $uri = ereg_replace('\\?&','?',$uri);
   $uri = ereg_replace('\\?$','',$uri);

I was just wondering wether there is a shorter way (one preg_replace()
perhaps?).

thanks,
Jerry

Yup, there sure is...

$uri = preg_replace("/[?&]baked=[^&]+/", '', $uri);

And you are good to go.

Ray,
This wouldn't work.  Note that if baked=any_value was the first of many
name=value pairs in a query string, your preg_replace() would remove the '?'
(that's not good).

I've never noted which analyzers do what you speak of, but my favorite is
Webalizer (http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/) and I've worked with Analog a
bit (http://www.analog.cx/).  Some other possibly useful links:

I believe my computer is infected with some worm, do NOT open that email or
run the attachment - I'm working on removing whatever it is that is sending
the emails right now.

Thank you, and I apologize for the incontinence.

Just to clarify...

The virus was rejected by the list, and hasn't been distributed to list
subscribers.  However, if you were in Bradley's address book (as I was) you
were sent the message.  Then again, I hope people don't run .exe files from
mail attachments anyway.

It appears to me that I received it from the list, I highly doubt that I was 
in Bradley's address book.  No fear, though, Linux will protect me from .exe 
viruses -- for now at least.

I received the mail with the [nycphp-talk] signature as well, however it
didn't pass thru NYPHP.org's mail servers.  Often, email clients will collect
addresses that have been sent to or recieved from.  This, I guess, is where
the virus would get most of it's addresses.

Bradley:  No harm done.

Have you considered implementing these using shared memory and semaphores -
or at least offering that as an option during initialization?  I've written
some PHP (http://phpnow.net/src/pVar.inc.phps) to implement application
variables via shared memory, but it really needs to be redone in C, since
PHP's SHM/SEM functionality isn't all there.  But with the assortment of data
types ADT offers, if it was in shared memory, it'd be great.

Pleasure meeting you at LWE by the way.

Just be careful with cleaning any user data that you pass to the shell -
people can do some real nasty things, and in fact, I never pass things
directly to a command line, even with proper escaping.  I generally push it
through some strcmp() or switch() statements, so I know exactly what's up.

Sure.. just like you would in Perl or anything else.  Compile PHP with
--enable-cgi (although you should double-check ./configure --help that I'm
correct) and off you go.  There's loads of documentation on the web
concerning CGI techniques, etc., of which I'm not familiar with.  I always
use mod_php, which I recommend if the environment permits.

Whew, no idea.  Icky regular expressions, but see link above for external

I'm planning on implementing a method of node (element) proxying, so you
initialize a structure and specify handlers, which get called when you
access elements.  This will allow for SHM, DB or whatever, storage.

Has anyone ever tried connecting to an IBM AS400 (running OS400, not AIX)
with PHP? I know PHP has DB2 support, but my network administrator is
skeptical of success. We're stuck with this dinosaur (the IBM, not the
network admin - he's a life saver) for another couple of years, so we need
to find a way to work with it.

Thanks in advance for any advice or ideas,

Winston

Wow, that'll be exactly what I need  :)  I'll be anxious to work on it when I

Based on your response, I went to the IBM site, found the information and a
link to download a free Linux driver. Thanks to your advice we now have a
PHP test page on our Linux server making successful queries to our AS400.

As my knowledge and experience increases, I hope to give back to this list
as much as I get from it.

Thanks again,

Can someone point me in the right direction?  I am writing what I think 
is a fairly simple session authentication script, but I keep getting 
the following error:

Warning :  Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already sent 
(output started at /Library/WebServer/Documents/DSMetro/header.php:16) 
in /Library/WebServer/Documents/DSMetro/frontpage.php on line 111

It sounds to me like the problem is due to the http headers at the top 
of the page, but I don't know how best to handle this.  I don't want to 
leave out the headers, right?

Your friendly neighborhood newbie.

Let's try that one more time, in plain text.

Basically, session info is sent in the header of the page, which must
be sent prior to any content. Normally, this is done by the server,
transparently to you. If you're mucking with any of the header info
using PHP commands, those commands must appear before anything that

OK, but all I did was enter the usual  META TAG info.  So I take it you 
might be talking about something else.

What is happening is that on the page "frontpage.php" one enters their 
user name and password.
Then the same page is called to verify the user and create a session 
with the user's info.
Now using the header() function, frontpage.php is called once more with 
the session id on the end of the URL.  And when I try to access the 
user's info such as
if (isset($HTTP_SESSION_VARS['userID'])){
	echo $HTTP_SESSION_VARS['userName'];
}
  I get nothing unless I say start_session() before the if statement.  
However doing that triggers the error I mentioned earlier.

Send the text of the page up until the if statement above.

Howdy e.Dave -

probably not the right place for this question, but what this likely means
is that you're trying to start your session after you've already output
something to the browser.  session_start() should be the first function you
call in your code - and should be before any HTML.

contact me directly if you need more help.  C

Let's try that one more time, in plain text.

Can someone point me in the right direction?  I am writing what I think
is a fairly simple session authentication script, but I keep getting
the following error:

Warning :  Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already sent
(output started at /Library/WebServer/Documents/DSMetro/header.php:16)

It sounds to me like the problem is due to the http headers at the top
of the page, but I don't know how best to handle this.  I don't want to
leave out the headers, right?

Your friendly neighborhood newbie.

Subject: Remembering which option in a SELECT the user picked.
Message-ID: <3E375EF9.1000502@onemain.com>

Hello NYPHP group,
I'm searching for an answer to this, that I don't find in the usual 
resources (i.e. PHP cookbook, www.php.net).  My PHP skill is novice at 
best, so I could use some help.


I have a SELECT on a web form.

<select name="TimeChoice">
<option value="Friday August 22, 04:00 PM - 06:00 PM">Friday August 22, 
04:00 PM - 06:00 PM</option>
<option value="Friday August 22, 06:00 PM - 08:00 PM">Friday August 22, 
06:00 PM - 08:00 PM</option>
<option value="Friday August 22, 08:00 PM - 10:00 PM">Friday August 22, 
08:00 PM - 10:00 PM</option>
<option value="Friday August 22, 10:00 PM - 12:00 AM">Friday August 22, 
10:00 PM - 12:00 AM</option>
<option value="Saturday August 23, 12:00 AM - 02:00 AM">Saturday August 
23, 12:00 AM - 02:00 AM</option>
<option value="Saturday August 23, 12:00 PM - 02:00 PM">Saturday August 
23, 12:00 PM - 02:00 PM</option>
<option value="Saturday August 23, 02:00 PM - 04:00 PM">Saturday August 
23, 02:00 PM - 04:00 PM</option>
<option value="Saturday August 23, 04:00 PM - 06:00 PM">Saturday August 
23, 04:00 PM - 06:00 PM</option>
<option value="Saturday August 23, 06:00 PM - 08:00 PM">Saturday August 
23, 06:00 PM - 08:00 PM</option>
<option value="Saturday August 23, 08:00 PM - 10:00 PM">Saturday August 
23, 08:00 PM - 10:00 PM</option>
<option value="Saturday August 23, 10:00 PM - 12:00 AM">Saturday August 
23, 10:00 PM - 12:00 AM</option>
<option value="Sunday August 24, 12:00 AM - 02:00 AM">Sunday August 24, 
12:00 AM - 02:00 AM</option>
<option value="Sunday August 24, 12:00 PM - 02:00 PM">Sunday August 24, 
12:00 PM - 02:00 PM</option>
<option value="Sunday August 24, 02:00 PM - 04:00 PM">Sunday August 24, 
02:00 PM - 04:00 PM</option>
</select>

Only one option may be chosen.

When I submit this form, there could be errors.  When I have errors, I 
wish to reprint the form with the user's values remembered.  In the 
reprinted SELECT tag, one of the OPTION tags will now have a SELECTED 
attribute.  Is there any elegant way to insert the SELECTED attribute on 
the right option?

I've been running into this situation a lot.

Thank you for your time and help.

--Stephen

this is how i start every web page...and the $tid value is maintained
flawlessly for tracking the user.

***********
<?php
session_start();
$tid = $_COOKIE["PHPSESSID"];
************
I, for one, am completely blown away with how easy sessions are to manage
with php. i never it expected it to be so simple, so transparent and so
reliable...at least, at my host, it works that way.

I am truly a novice. haha.  This is so elegant.  

I don't have access to a database, so I'll go with your array structure.
The PHP server is < 4.1.  I have to go with 
$HTTP_POST_VARS["timeChoice"] (Explicit reference)

I was originally doing this using #3 of your notes 9type out each if 
statement), but that was so inefficient that there had to be another way.
I can load the date values in an array and cycle through that.

Thank you Justin for the tip.  Let me attempt to work along the idea you 
provided.

Hi Stephen,

You might consider offloading the creating of the select to a function call:


function generate_select($name,$option,$sel=0) {
      $str = "\
<select name=\\"$name\\">\
";
      $str .= "<option value=\\"0\\">- None -</option>\
";
      foreach ($option as $key=>$val) {
        if ($sel == $val) {
           $str .="<option value=\\"$val\\" selected>$key</option>\
";
       } else {
          $str .= "<option value=\\"$val\\">$key</option>\
";
      }
    }
     $str .= "</select>\
";
     return $str;
  }

Then, you can just create an array of the values you want in select:
/*  I used a numerical representation of the date time to avoid 
confusion between the key and value */
$arr_times = array(    "Friday August 22, 04:00 PM - 06:00 PM"=> 
"082203_1600_1800",    "Friday August 22, 06:00 PM - 08:00 PM"=> 
"082203_1800_2000");

and run the function like this:

$display_select = generate_select("TimeChoice",$arr_times);
if ($error) {
  $display_select = 
generate_select("TimeChoice",$arr_times,$_POST['TimeChoice']);
}

If you get an error, you will retain the HTTP_POST_VARS for your select 
value, and you should be in business.  Bear in mind I haven't tested 
this out, but I think it will work; anyone see problems with this?

         $str .= "<option value=\\"$val\\">$key</option>\
";
     }
   }
    $str .= "</select>\
";
    return $str;
 }

Then, you can just create an array of the values you want in select:
/*  I used a numerical representation of the date time to avoid confusion between the key and value */
$arr_times = array(    "Friday August 22, 04:00 PM - 06:00 PM"=> "082203_1600_1800",    "Friday August 22, 06:00 PM - 08:00 PM"=> "082203_1800_2000");

and run the function like this:

$display_select = generate_select("TimeChoice",$arr_times);
if ($error) {
 $display_select = generate_select("TimeChoice",$arr_times,$_POST['TimeChoice']);
}

If you get an error, you will retain the HTTP_POST_VARS for your select value, and you should be in business.  Bear in mind I haven't tested this out, but I think it will work; anyone see problems with this?

Your scripts got to remember the entry the user made.  And then the 
"<select name=>" tag has to be placed at that entry instead of the top.

There has been considerable discussion on hourly rates and the like, but not
a formal tally.  This would make a nice poll and/or writeup on nyphp.org if
anyone would like to do it (it would be pretty easy, too).

Something along the lines of, but more granular, than salary.com. Maybe hourly and salary with some idea on responsibilities.

Hi,
I received some possible solutions for this from the mailing group.
I'm going to store the option values in an array and use a function to 
dynamically generate the dropdown.

Thanks,

First create an array with all your options for the <select> menu:

$TimeChoice_options = array(
    'Friday August 22, 04:00 PM - 06:00 PM',
    'Friday August 22, 06:00 PM - 08:00 PM',
    'Friday August 22, 08:00 PM - 10:00 PM',
    ...
);


Next define this function:

function make_select($source, $field_name, $selected_id = "")
{
 echo '<select name="'.$field_name.'" id="'.$field_name."\\">\
";
 foreach($source as $element)
 {
  if(is_array($element)
  {
   $id = $element[0];
   $label = $element[1];
  }
  else
  {
   $id = $element;
   $label = $element;
  }
  $sel = ($selected_id == $id)?' selected':'';
  echo '<option value="'.$id.'"'.$sel.'>'.$label."</option>\
";
 }
 echo "</select>\
";
}


Now place this function call where you would like to have your <select> menu
built:
make_select($TimeChoice_options, 'TimeChoice',
$HTTP_GET_VARS['TimeChoice']);

Change $HTTP_GET_VARS to $HTTP_POST_VARS if you use method="POST" in your
form tag:
make_select($TimeChoice_options, 'TimeChoice',
$HTTP_POST_VARS['TimeChoice']);


In the future if your values and labels are different for your <select>
options:
<option value="1">Monday</option>
<option value="2">Tuesday</option>
<option value="3">Wednesday</option>
<option value="4">Thursday</option>
...

... just build a two-dimentional array instead (the above function is ready
for it):

$TimeChoice_options = array(
    array( '1', 'Monday'),
    array( '2', 'Tuesday' ),
    array( '3', 'Wednesday'),
    array( '3', 'Thursday'),
    ...
);

Good Luck,

Jerry

Hi,
I need to write a function that given a URL, will open it and "rip it" to
my local server, (i.e. save the page's code to a specific directory, queue
all of the page's assets -images, css, js, etc- save them to that directory
as well and fix all paths to make it available for local browsing).

Not really a big one, but if somebody already knows about a script that
does this, I wouldn't mind the head start.

Lastly, it was great to have meet some of you last night... great meeting.

You could try to figure out copy(), which didn't work too well for me, or use fopen() and fwrite()

I don't have a script, but start with http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php and you can have a quick and dirty page grab function going in no time. 

-----Original Message----- 

Hi, 
I need to write a function that given a URL, will open it and "rip it" to 
my local server, (i.e. save the page's code to a specific directory, queue 
all of the page's assets -images, css, js, etc- save them to that directory 
as well and fix all paths to make it available for local browsing). 

Not really a big one, but if somebody already knows about a script that 
does this, I wouldn't mind the head start. 

Lastly, it was great to have meet some of you last night... great meeting.

I don't know if this is the type of function you migh be looking for, 
either, but the PHP cURL stuff is pretty sweet (check 
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.curl.php).  You might be able to 
leverage this with some clever use of the string functions once you get 
the data to your script.

Message-ID: <01ce01c2c7d3$38f67ce0$96721d18@enobrev>

To start, I'm new to the list, so hello all.
 
I'm working on a script that requires cURL, but I'd rather surpass the
need for cURL as it isn't usually installed by default on servers
(namely mine - but other servers I've been on hadn't had it installed
either).  I realize I could try to use the command line cURL, but it's
my understanding that that can be a security issue, and I would just
like to handle it all within the script.
 
I want to mimic this :
------------------------------
 
  $curl_holder = curl_init();
  curl_setopt ($curl_holder , CURLOPT_URL, <https://k> '
<https://www.url.com/script/> https://www.url.com/');
  curl_setopt ($curl_holder , CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
  curl_setopt ($curl_holder , CURLOPT_POST, 1);
  curl_setopt ($curl_holder , CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $vars);
  curl_setopt ($curl_holder , CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

  $server_response = curl_exec ($curl_holder );
  curl_close ($curl_holder );
 
  print $server_response;
 
I've tried this:
-----------------
  
   $vars = 'name=mark&user=enobrev'
 
   $header = 'POST /track HTTP/1.0' . "\\r\
";
   $header .= 'Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' .
"\\r\
";
   $header .= 'Content-length: ' . strlen($vars) . "\\r\
\\r\
";
 
   $fp = fsockopen('www.url.com/script/', 443, $error_number,
$error_sting);
   
   if ($fp) {
     fputs($fp, $header . $vars);
     
    while (!feof($fp)) {
      $response .= fgets($fp, 128);
      fclose($fp);
    }
    
    print htmlspecialchars($response);
   } else {
    print $error_number . ': ' . $error_sting . ' - could not connect to
' . $url);
   }
 
And i get a whole bunch of these (which refers to the while line and the
lines within the loop):
--------------------
 
Warning: feof(): 2 is not a valid File-Handle resource
 
The Question
-------------------
 
Am I going the right way about this, or is there a better way?  And what
exactly is that error referring to?
 
 
Thank you in advance.

Sorry, the CURLOPT_URL line got screwy:

  curl_setopt ($curl_holder , CURLOPT_URL, 'https://www.url.com/');

I use a self-modified version of a script called PostIt which I think uses
sockets.

I don't think you can (easily) use sockets to communicate with the HTTPS
protocol. Everything you send would need to be encrypted and everything you
receive would need to be decrypted.

This is a real pain.

There's no absolute need for cURL, but considerable complexity is added
without it, especially since it looks like you need to speak HTTPS, and not
just HTTP.

If you're careful, there shouldn't be any problems.  Try to limit user input
from getting into system() and related calls as much as possible, and you'll
be ok.

fsockopen() failed to open because 'www.url.com/script/' is not a valid
address (fsockopen() takes only a hostname [and protocol]).

$fp = fsockopen('www.url.com', 443, $error_number, $error_sting);

or

$fp = fsockopen('udp://www.url.com', 443, $error_number, $error_sting);

Plus, you're connecting to an encrypted service, which means you'll probably
have to have some handshaking done before you can begin to talk.  I don't
speak HTTPS, but it's probably not too fun.

This is the right way; aside from using cURL :)  Or you could use real
sockets (as opposed to streams, of which fsockopen() is) if you have a lot of
time to kill.

Connecting and ripping pages isn't a big deal, but there may be some added
complexity to consider:

-- Are cookies involved?  Will the remote server give you the content you
expect?

-- Parsing through the code for all required assets I think would be horrible
(especially trying to deal with JS, etc. in real complex pages).  Same goes
for fixing paths and the like.  Then again, I despise client-side code, so
I'm probably biased.

I'm sure something at least to start with exists; try
http://phpclasses.mirrors.nyphp.org maybe?  or hotscripts.com?

Also, maybe the good old wget command-line tool would come in handy.

three notes:

1) Use cURL, any PHP solution you create will be 1/5 the speed, at best.
2) You can't do ssl handshakes, etc. in PHP
3) cURL and the cURL extension will be bundled as of php5

How exactly does PHP "open a socket"?  Is it using something that is part of
the PHP engine? or is it using some other system call?

For instance, how close are the following operations?

1.  Using fsockopen() to connect to port 80 on a remote server.

AND

2.  Using the shell command telnet to connect to PORT 80 on a remote server.


The reason I ask is both are moving very slowly on one of our Linux servers.
I'm suspicious of xinetd because I had a previous problem with FTP'ing that
was solved through xinetd's conf files.

Just my opinion, but to reduce processing and possible error, you may want to
consider making the value= some sort of shorter representation of the value
you're after.  This is really pedantic, though.

Same here, so I wrote a silly little function:


function is_selected( $val,$val1 ) {
   if( $val == $val1 )
      return " SELECTED value=\\"$val1\\" ";
   else
      return " value=\\"$val1\\" ";
}

which I use along these lines:

<select name=respon>
  <option <?=is_selected($_POST['respon'],'one')?> One! </option>
  <option <?=is_selected($_POST['respon'],'two'> Two! </option>
  <option <?=is_selected($_POST['respon'],'three')?> Three! </option>
  <option <?=is_selected($_POST['respon'],'four')?> Four! </option>
</select>

I know very little of what's involved with the SSL process, but out of
curiosity, why can't you do homegrown SSL in PHP yourself?  Binary safety
issues and immature sockets?

At the OS level, the same as anything else (ie telnet).

> Is it using something that is part of the PHP engine?

Partially; the nicety of being able to do fsockopen("udp://somewhere.com") or
fsockopen("tcp://somewhere.com") is a PHPism.  I think how PHP does this has
changed and/or improved to a certain extent recently, but I know little more
of the details.

http://www.php.net/manual/en/streams.php
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.stream.php

> or is it using some other system call?

Streams, whether stdio or PHP, all use the same system calls at one point;
they are just various wrappers.

As far as Linux, the OS, is concerned, identical.

I stay away from super-servers so maybe I've lost track of what it does, but
xinetd should only be involved with incoming connections (which, I suppose
*could* affect FTP).  But doing just a telnet should have no difference. 
Check DNS latency, network congestion, kernel/hardware errors, etc.

The thought of user input going anywhere near system calls makes my
teeth chatter.

Here's what I'm running instead of the fsock-- solution:
exec('curl ' . '-d ' . $post_vars . ' ' . $this->url, $data);

And then when I ran it via ssh, I found out that ssl support hasn't been
complied into my server's curl.  Thankfully my host is always helpful
and will solve that one for me.

Thank you.



Well, I suppose I'm at my host's mercy waiting for them to get curl
going with ssl support.  I was really hoping to make something that
could run without having to bother them, but oh well.

The following is a piece of code that demonstrates one way to do what you
are trying to do.

<?php

$arr = array (
    '0' => 'Please Select',
    'Weekly Rental' =>  'Weekly Rental',
    'Monthly Rental' => 'Monthly Rental',
    'Daily Rental' =>   'Daily Rental',
    'Annual Rental' =>  'Annual Rental',
    'Year Round Living' => 'Year Round Living',
    'other' => 'Other'
    );

    echo"<select name=\\"looking_for\\" class=\\"smalltext\\">\
";
    foreach($arr as $key=>$val) {
        if($looking_for == $key) {
            echo"\	<option value=\\"$key\\" SELECTED>$val</option>\
";
        } else {
            echo"\	<option value=\\"$key\\">$val</option>\
";

?>

I did this too-- I've profiled a number of scripts and seen a 30%-50% 
speed increase. Seems to work as advertised.

Now if only gewtimagesize() calls didn't bog things down so much...

Thanks for a very informative session!

Based on recent feedback, I created this snippet of code to generate the

/* Generate the SELECT tag with options.

function the value

 */
function generateHtmlSelectTag($selectName, $optionValues, $selectedValue) {
    $str = "<select name=\\"$selectName\\">\
";
    foreach ($optionValues as $key => $value) {
        if ($selectedValue == $value) {
            $str .="<option value=\\"$value\\" selected>$key</option>\
";
        } else {
            $str .= "<option value=\\"$value\\">$key</option>\
";
        }    // End if-else
    }    // End foreach
    $str .= "</select>\
";
    return $str;
}    // End function


// This is called in the PHP file elsewhere to generate the SELECT tag 
with options

<?php $displaySelectTag = generateHtmlSelectTag("requestTime", 
$clubhouseDates, 0);
echo $displaySelectTag; ?>


But every OPTION tag has the selected attribute...
It appears this condition turns out true.
if ($selectedValue == $value) {

Printing out the value gives me 0 (integer) and Friday August 22, 04:00 
PM - 06:00 PM (string), but how can the equality be true?

What do I not understand?

Thanks.

Hans,

I'd love to help out with some volunteer work, but since the schedule is
during the week, I have classes (last semester before I graduate) to
attend to. If there is anything I can help with from here (Baltimore)
then I'd be glad to lend a hand. Otherwise, if the semester ends up with
me having free time on that week, then I will be up to volunteer to help
with any background work that needs to be done.

This email list has been great to me, and I hope to be able to help out
in the future.

Subject: Problem with xml_parse_into_struct
Message-ID: <01c301c2c82c$7c3f88d0$2aaf6244@scandinawa1bo6>

I have various XML files that might contain <> tags inside the element body, for example:

<news id="1" shortDescription="Stuff Happened Today">Today on <b>1/29/03</b>, stuff happened</news>

Because of this I can't use xml_parse_into_struct; when I do this happens:

array (
  ...
  [attributes] => array (
                                   [ID] = "1"
                                   [SHORTDESCRIPTION] = "Stuff Happened Today"
                               )
 [values]  = "Today on"
)

and it stops right there on the <b> tag.

What I need to do is this: Clean out ALL occurrences of <tags> that are NOT part of the original XML structure from the contents read from the XML file:

$fileID = fopen('/phil/xml/news.xml', 'r') or die('Could not open XML');
$stuff = fread($fileID, filesize('/phil/xml/news.xml'));
fclose($fileID);

$stuff contains the contents of news.xml, so I would have to do my cleanup in $stuff, BUT.. I can't use preg_replace for tags because then ALL of my tags would be altered and xml_parse_into_struct would fail altogether.

How then do I make sure to ONLY remove the <trash tags> from each XML row body and nowhere else???

Thanx
Phil

Well, I realize this isn't the most elegant solution, but it worked for
me:

$tags = array('b', 'br', 'i', 'p');

$ok_tags = array();
$ok_replaced = array();
foreach($tags as $tag) {
  $ok_tags[] 	= '<' . $tag . '>';
  $ok_tags[] 	= '</' . $tag . '>';
  $ok_replaced[] 	= '&lt;' . $tag . '&gt;';
  $ok_replaced[] 	= '&lt;/' . $tag . '&gt;';
}
		
$data = str_replace($ok_tags, $ok_replaced, $data);

$parser = xml_parser_create('ISO-8859-1');
xml_parse_into_struct($parser , $data, $values, $index);
// etc, etc...

I know it doesn't help for xhtml style tags (<br />, etc) nor does it do
much for tags with attributes (img, etc), but if it's just the basics,
it does the trick...

Yes, I solved it.  Before I was passing 0 for $v.  I had not know about 
the automatic type conversion, so every OPTION tag had the selected 
attribute in it.
I switched over to === in that comparison.

if there is just a limited number of different ones, do it by brute 
force:  clean out each one globally in turn.  This would be easiest and 
probably quickest, again assuming that there are not many many different ones.

Where are you getting the XML source from?  Can that person URL encode
tags such as <b>, so that you can decode them later?  That way, they
wouldn't interfere with your parsing.

I've been wondering about this, too. I've been parsing RSS newsfeeds 
(which sounds like the format you might want to try to get your data in 
if you have any control over it-- http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/ ). 
The RSS spec declares that html entities must be escaped, which makes it 
easy to parse.

But then I decided to try building templates using XML and ran into 
exactly this problem-- I'm not an XML expert, but I wonder two things:

1) Can I wrap blocks of HTML with CDATA tags to cause the parser to 
ignore the tags?
2) Should there be a parser function created (as part of PHP) that flags 
certain tags as containing unparseable data?

I didn't have time to try 1 yet and 2 is a little out of my league. Is 
there another way besides brute-force tag rewriting?

I just performed some benchmarking and noticed that the default file session
handler is about 3.5 times faster than one using mySQL on localhost.  I need
a shared session data storage for multiple web servers, but did not expect
mySQL session handling to be that much slower than files.  I'm wondering if
anyone on the list have done anything like that  and would like to share
their experience.

This makes sense, especially if you don't have a persistent MySQL 
connection.  MySQL has to verify the connection, process the query, hit the 
index, fetch the data and return it to the API.  A 'files' approach just 
needs to open the session file, the data for which is probably already 
cached by the OS.  If you want even more speed, put those session files on 
a RAM disk.

As you said, a MySQL session solution comes into its own when you're 
dealing with multiple web servers, although you could also do it over NFS 
(but NFS is pretty slow too).  Also, the 'files' solution doesn't do a very 
good job of cleaning up after itself.  Thousands of stale session files are 
going to slow down directory search times.

You could build a custom session server which serves session data from a 
memory-bound hash over a socket.

Subject: Apache/PHP Authentication - Again
Message-ID: <OFBF759C69.EB4B7362-ON85256CBF.004670F1@un.org>

Thanks to those who replied to my earlier post (below). It's taken me a
while to get on with this.

The files I need to protect are mostly binary, so I can't use a solution
that involves inserting authentication code at the top of PHP pages.

The approach suggested in
http://www.zend.com/zend/trick/tricks-august-2001.php (put the files
outside the document root and use PHP to read them, supply headers, and
forward) will work, but it would be much simpler to be able to password
protect all files in any specified set of directories using Apache
.htaccess. The problem with this is updating the user list, which is large
and in MySQL. The web hosting service doesn't support mod_auth_mysql.

What I would like to do is

1 set up .htaccess protected directories with a single user name and
password,

2 use a PHP page to authenticate users (user by user) against a MySQL
database, and

3 have the PHP page send requests from authenticated users to the server
with the basic authentication header, so that the Apache authentication
window does *not* pop-up, the server having already received basic
authentication credentials.

This last step is not possible directly, but I thought that it might be
accomplished indirectly using a redirect header, like this.

<?php header('Location:
http://www.domainname.com/members/membershome.php');
      header('Authorization: base64_encode("abc:123")');
?>

This doesn't work. Is there any way to make this idea work?

This is probably off-topic since it sounds like you've decided on an 
.htaccess solution, but I have a project called Fiatlux 
(http://chxo.com/berylium/software/fiatlux/ ) that creates 
password-protected fileshares using PHP.

It currently uses a flat file user database, but could easily be 
extended to incorporate MySQL.

OK, here is a silly idea:

After you authenticate in your code, you make an HTTP
request to yourself to get the file.  That should go
through Apache again.  You have to supply the
authentication headers.  You then just stream the byes
back to the client.

NOTE:  There ia deadlock potential if the number of
Apache children is set too low.

BTW, there is always mod_perl :)

Check out msession (http://www.php.net/msession). Unfortunately, I

Subject: Output name of Variable
Message-ID: <BA601E88.C6B7%jim@nettmedia.com>


It seems like it would be helpful if there were a way to grab the name
assigned to a variable and output it. Is there already a function like this?

I would use this mainly for tracing and reporting. So, if I had a simple
function show_variable($var), it would not only output the value assigned to
the variable, but would also show the name of the variable itself.

Am I missing it?

I have never used it, so I may be wrong, but I think what you need is

$$variable

I don't think so. I think this would allow the name of a variable to be
dynamic.

eg:

$foo = "bar";
$bar = "This is the value of my variable";

...

echo $$foo;

... will output "This is the value of my variable"

I was kinda wondering how that worked.  Doesn't really apply to the original 
question then.  Answered one for me then, thanks.

I think it's simpler then that:

$foo="bar";

then:

echo $foo;
   will output the value of the variable

Right. But I want it to output the NAME of the variable, not the VALUE...

So use the $$var construct but pass the name to the function. E.g.

function display_var($varname) {
    print $varname;
    var_dump($$varname); // or print_r($$varname);
}

function display_var($varname) {

I was recently trying to solve the same problem myself.
I asked around at work and the consensus seems to be that it's impossible
for plain variables.

My solution ended up being passing the name of the variable to the function
and not the variable itself.
Then you can just use $$name to get the value.

Please let me know if you manage to pull it off some other way.

I can't seem to find much about finding the name of a variable, as I can
see how it would be helpful.  I suppose, if you wanted to change your
coding methods, you could have a vars array.  Where you could:

$vars = array();

... In the beginning of every script (or in your config file).  The rest
of your page using $vars['name'] throughout in place of variables and
then for debugging something like:

foreach($vars as $name => $value) {
	print $name . ': ' . $value . '<br />';
}

Come to think of it, I kinda like the idea (could probably make some
great variable management functions this way).

I suppose that would work for an overall means of debugging without
inserting debug variable display functions throughout the script.
Otherwise, I like David's solution.

Anyways... if you find a way, please pass it on...

It seems like it would be helpful if there were a way to grab the name
assigned to a variable and output it. Is there already a function like
this?

I would use this mainly for tracing and reporting. So, if I had a simple
function show_variable($var), it would not only output the value
assigned to the variable, but would also show the name of the variable
itself.

Am I missing it?

The name of the variable is what value you initially gave it ...

Example:

$var = "Hello";
$$var = "World";
echo "Hello $$var"; // produces $Hello

That only seems to work with double quotation marks. ( Which doesn't mean
it's not the solution... )

$var = "Hello";
$$var = "World";

echo "$$var"; // Produces $Hello

echo '<p>';

echo $$var; // Produces World

This is kind of a different tack - I don't know if it could help you or 
not.  It uses a function call, so you have to be careful of the variable 
scope.

Function is something like:

function show_variable($arr,$var) {
    foreach ($arr as $key=>$val) {
        if ($key == $var) {
            $str = "$$key = $val";
            return $str;
        }
    }
}

/* Then, you can call it like this: */
$test = "Test me!";
echo show_variable(get_defined_vars(),"test");
/*  result is $test = Test me!  */

Since get_defined_vars() has all the variables in your current scope, it 
needs to be passed to the function.   The need to pass the name of the 
variable in quotes might be might be suboptimal for you, but I can 
confirm that this works, kicking out the appropriate string.

Hi,
Upon a successful submission of the form on my PHP page, I use the 
header("Location: ") function to redirect to another page.  I'd like to 
carry over some form values over to the redirected page to use.  Is this 
possible?  Or is there another way to do this?  I don't think it's a 
good idea to embed the second page into the main PHP page as the main 
PHP page will be very long.

Thanks.

the easiest way is to just:

Location:  http://url.com/?name=value&name1=value1

then on the corresponding grab the values in the $_GET hash.

I think the answer is yes, but you have to encode your the all your Form 
variables including the any equal signs.

I think the easiest way to accomplish this would be instead of assigning to
a variable, assign it to an associative array. This way you can name the
array whatever you'd like and cycle through the name using a foreach loop.

Ok, this is an easy way, no doubt.

How would I do this via POST?  Some form fields may not be presentable 
to the screen.

how about calling a javascript function to populate a second form (with the
action= your redirected page and method=post) with your required data and
then submitting it?

hmmm....

off the top of my head, i would say you can't.  you could cookie the info,
pass a tag in the query string to the next page, and then grab the info
from the cookie.  alternatively, you could write the sensitive data to a
file on disk, pass a tag, pull the file, read the data and delete the
file.

this is just off the top of my head, and not completely secure.  i know.

This is a simplified version of what I do to pass POST data:

These two functions are included in all my scripts:

function post_save() {
        if(count($_POST))

              $_SESSION['post_around'] = $_POST;
       }
}


function post_read() {
       if(!count($_POST) && isset($_SESSION['post_around']) ) {
              $_POST = $_SESSION['post_around'];
              unset($_SESSION['post_around']);
       }
}


I place this code near the top of each script:

session_start();
post_read();

and this right before each header( 'Location: ...') call:

post_save();

Hope this helps,
Jerry]
