It ended up, for now at least, not having anything to do with the SQL
queries. After working from the end of the process back to the very
beginning, I found that the error was happening in the model file for
the District. In that file, there is a $hasMany variable that looked
like this:

var $hasMany = array('User'=>array(),'book=>array());//I removed all
of the values from the arrays

I changed it to:

var $hasMany = array('user'=>array(),'book=>array());

And it started working.

It still does not explain why some records were displayed and others
weren't, but at least it's working now. So I know when something
similar happens again, it's likely a case sensitivity issue.

Hi Randall,

This may or may not fix your problem, but your query syntax is wrong.   
Depending on your Cake version, you'll either want this:

$district = $this->District->find(array("District.id" => $this- 
 >passedArgs[0]));
- or -
$district = $this->District->find('first', array('conditions' =>  
array("District.id" => $this->passedArgs[0])));

However, using findById should do effectively the same thing, so why  
not use that?

Also, since whatever's in $passedArgs gets passed as parameters to the  
action, you could really just do this (assuming this code is called in  
an action:

function view($id = null) {
	// ...
	$district = $this->District->findById($id);
	$this->set(compact('district'));
}


Hope that helps,

- Nate Abele

Thanks, Nate. Yes, after really digging around, including an attempt
to upgrade, I figured out there was a syntax issue. I was able to get
it working for now, but at least I am aware of yet another potential
issue.

> ?Depending on your Cake version:

This app is using version 1.1.19.6305, running PHP5, so I think the
following will work, right?

Yeah, I tried that and it kept giving me an error. Which is what clued
me in to the idea that the version I was working with was not the same
as what the Cookbook is written for. That was a pretty dumb assumption
on my part, thinking I was working with the current release.

The application runs fine on the current production server, which is
part of the reason the errors were so perplexing. Anyway, I am on to
the next step in the process -- moving to the new test server. We'll
see how that goes.

Message-ID: <003401c9ca78$0fb02c60$2f108520$@com>

I was wondering if anyone on the list has a favorite, most-bulletproof
"User-Agent, CSS, browser sensing" strategy for sensing mobile phones
and/or individual carrier mobile phone environments. 

I am interested in a combined JavaScript / CSS @media or even a PHP
route.

Also, has anyone used WURFL? 

I see that by looking at the User-Agent, Symfony has a CSS/template
switching feature that allows you to deliver alternative web site output
to iPhone users, but this is too specific for me at this time. 

Any thoughts?

I think sensing mobile in general and at least about a Top 5 individual
phone types would be good.

A lot of really old info online on this topic. 
Here are a couple of 2009 article references for this topic.

Javascript won't work because so many mobile browsers don't turn js on
by default.
CSS - '@media handheld' doesn't work very well either.

Regex'ing the useragent string from php is the only method I found
that was reliable.

OK, so I'm almost done with getting the basics of this site done so
that we can switch to the new server next week, but I have one
pressing issue.

I have PHPMyAdmin installed on the server at this address:
http://www.example.com/phpmyadmin/

When I try to access it, I get this:

===============================

You are seeing this error because controller PhpmyadminController
could not be found.
Notice: If you want to customize this error message, create
app/views/errors/missing_controller.thtml.
Fatal: Create the class below in file :
app/controllers/phpmyadmin_controller.php

<?php
class PhpmyadminController extends AppController {
   var $name = 'Phpmyadmin';
}
?>

===============================

So how do I tell Cake to ignore requests for the phpmyadmin directory?
I added this to the .htaccess, but to no avail:

RewriteRule ^phpmyadmin/(.+)?$ phpmyadmin/$1 [L]

and you can ignore my request about the routing. i figured it out. i
had updated the .htaccess under the /app/ folder, not the root of the
directory.

Most PHP developers run-it-in-production-and-see-what-happens, so you
are already one step ahead of the usual suspects.

Yes, installed and tried it out and was astonished. That's some pretty cool
magic there. But I haven't done much else with it so far.

I tend to use associative arrays a lot, and I'm amazed at how productive 
you can be just shooting a few out to the browser with FirePHP and 
digging through them.

That's how I do my majority of debugging, just shooting array's to the
browser with print_r.  Sometimes though digging through them can be a pain
especially if they contain over a thousand indexes.

I can see messages and traces, but when I call dump nothing happens.
Just me? What is dump supposed to do, exactly?

<?php
include_once( 'FirePHPCore/FirePHP.class.php' );
function debug() {
  $args = func_get_args();
  $firephp = FirePHP::getInstance(true);
  $firephp->log( $args );
  $firephp->dump( 'args', $args );
  $firephp->trace( "Trace" );
  exit();

You do know that FirePHP is supposed to be used with FireBug right?

As per the documentation:

"You can dump a variable to the Server tab of the Firebug Request
Inspector. To get to the Request Inspector expand a request in the
Console or Net panels."

In firebug go to the "net" tab and look at the response headers for a
given request.

Ahhh, the *server* tab. Thanks.

Dump() provides much more info on objects and arrays, but getting to
that tab is at least two clicks.

I get the impression that most developers report that they do automated
testing or they are trying to learn. Only a minority seem to be answering
flat-out no.

imho one of the major differences between a polished professional and a
hobbyist is responsible testing. That's why I still kick myself, as sort of
an eternal wannabe whose day-job description has zero to do with IT, but who
aspires nevertheless to write code that can be judged competent by any
standard:  I still haven't gotten the hang of unit testing, though I have
made some attempts to get religion and vow to keep trying.

It seems that I am not alone. So the question is, why is it hard for some to
adopt the practice? One thing that occurs to me is that maybe it isn't
really that easy to write good tests. We've all seen examples of how to test
a function that returns the sum of x + y -- thanks a lot. It's a little
harder to create simulated http environments complete with cookies and
sessions -- though people (e.g., the ZF team) have done wonderful things to
make it easier -- and forsee all the use cases in a complex app. Evidence
for the proposition that it's hard to write an exhaustive set of tests is
that you have products like the Zend Framework which is unit-tested to death
before release, and then the next release brags that 171 bugs were fixed.

I have a file_get_contents working on my laptop/dev box, but when I put 
it on the hosting server it comes back with an error.

	URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration

My guess is that there's a way to ini_set this to allow it, but the 
closest thing I found was allow_url_fopen which doesn't seem to work. Or 
I just don't know how to use it.

Any pointers to docs that will enlighten me?

You probably want to do this in your php.ini file, if this is on your
laptop.  I'm not sure if this particular setting can be changed via
ini_set, you'll have to look.

Here is Ken's personal theory as to why it is tough.  I come to this 
theory by examining my own weaknesses and seeing where I seem to have 
things in common with other programmers.

Programmers love to code.  Especially the talented ones, who get "in the 
zone" and can code for hours in a state of deep concentration.  When the 
muse is singing, and code is writing itself, nobody ever wants to 
stop.   Sometimes the results are amazing, sometimes they are not.

The zone is a thrilling and seductive place, but it does not tolerate 
discipline or interruptions.  Stopping every 10 minutes to craft a unit 
test is just plain no fun.  So it doesn't get done.

This is not the entire explanation, but I think it is true part of the time.

Another explanation is the basic human inability to see the limitations 
of our own efforts.  Software is by its nature complex and pieces 
interract in ways we do not predict or intend.  Unit tests and 
integration tests allow a programmer to nail these down and make the 
software very robust, but when you're doing the testing you're not 
coding the next feature, and I think we just love to code the next feature.

This is probably more value to the x+y example than meets the eye.  The 
x+y example is easy to illustrate because you have a function that 
returns a value.  You can make a series of tests that codify what should 
happen for all manner of good and bad inputs, and you're done.

The trick to the other more difficult situations is to learn to cast 
them in x+y terms.  If I have trouble with a cookie-browser situation, 
how can I make it simple enough to test as an x+y situation?  If I 
cannot make it simple enough to test /then I probably cannot get it to 
work right!/ 

Consider a web server.  A page request is the input, and the returned 
HTML is the output.  If your application is well designed, it must be 
possible to craft query requests and measure the returned HTML against 
an expected value.  If the page is too complicated to do this, then comp 
sci 101 is our friend: we break it down into pieces that can be tested 
individually.  This can be as simple as inserting HTML comments that 
mark certain areas so they can parsed out and compared against expected 
values.

Another example would be databases and calculated values.  How do you 
test that as if it were an x+y situation?  It's pretty simple actually.  
Craft a test system that makes inserts, updates, deletes, and then 
retrieves rows and compares them to the desired output.  If the rows 
come back ok, the test passes.

So I would say in conclusion it is all about learning to break the whole 
thing down into pieces that can be tested like the toy examples in the 
books.

I'll agree with the sub-thread on how to write good tests. It's really 
tricky. But I figure if I start with writing any tests at least that's 
progress. It's helped me clean up my code a lot.

Automated testing is the most overhyped tool in the QA world. I am in software 
QA for a decade now and automated QA makes sense for regression and load 
testing, but not for any new development. Test scripts are nothing else than 
new code, which again needs to be tested.
Ideally, the developer writes the test script for the code he or she is 
working on. Both application code and test script are only as good as the 
functional requirements and technical specifications. The better the 
expectations are definied (including what the feature is supposed to do and 
what it is NOT supposed to do, which is the part most commonly omitted), the 
better the outcome is. Crappy specs make crappy code and no matter how much 
automated testing is thrown against it will uncrappify the code. There is also 
often a general disconnect between developers and end-users, but that is 
fostered by the unsuitable management structure of most software companies. 
Support needs to be at the top with the biggest weight, below that are product 
management, then QA, and development is really at the bottom. I know it will 
come across as provocative, but developers are overrated and overpaid. They 
tend to get the nice cubes, the latest technology, and if the project plan is 
done right have a 9 to 5 job. Support, QA, and thus the customer have to 
suffer from whatever the devs crank out. Automated testing doesn?t do a thing 
for that.
BUT, devs can put themselves, their coworkers, and the customers in a position 
where nobody has to deal with crappy code. Follow coding guidelines, code 
modular, reuse known good code (which is only a small fraction of all code), 
and document the hell out of it. The next guy or yourself six months later 
will be happy. And always keep the end-user in mind. Way too many technology 
decisions are made so that the developers have it easier to code stuff, even 
if that means that implementing and maintaining it will be more difficult. So 
code in a way that verbose logs can be pulled upon request, that the data is 
easily transitioned, that apps are cross-platform, and then installation and 
maintenance are as easy as possible. And those are things where being smart 
helps way more than some automated test suite.

That has nothing to do with professional or hobbyist, but with good and bad 
developers. Good developers make very sure that anything they hand out is 
definitely going to work. And if it fails they put the means in to find out why.

Unit testing is really a bad name, since it is not part of the testing task, 
but part of coding. I have seen plenty of code that all it did was compile. It 
was obvious that the dev didn?t even try it out once. Where I work we have the 
devs detail in the tech specs which things need to be tested and how. That 
isn?t in as much detail as the test plans, but it makes the developers try 
things out first. The task of a developer is way broader than just writing code.

Testing and with that bug fixing is a tedious, frustrating, time consuming 
task that adds no new functionality to the application. Fixing bugs is 
probably the least favourite things for a developer to do, comes right after 
writing decent documentation (and tech writing should be a mandatory class in 
CS programs). It is less annoying when testability, fixability, and 
maintainability is designed and coded into an app right from the start. This 
is why it is so utterly important to design quality into the app way at the 
beginning. Unfortunately, it is often only an afterthought. See, I dabble once 
in a while in PHP and fixing things is really not as much fun as writing new 
stuff. So when writing new stuff taking effort to make the bug fixing to be a 
non-issue will make everyone happy.

Why simulate? You can grab about any PC and make it a (miniature) version of 
the production environment. Sure, if you decide to use for-pay only platforms 
it might cost you. And with ESXi being free to download and refurbished Dell 
servers selling for a few hundred bucks setting up VMs for testing is almost 
an option for the hobbyist. And PHP really helps a lot here compared to 
ASP.NET for example. Sure, VisualStudio is an awesome IDE, but you and your 
users will pay dearly for it for time to come. This shows how much rides on 
technology decisions, because they determine how the end product pans out even 
before a single line of code was written.

The QA analyst speaking here: you cannot test everything. As soon as you allow 
for combinations of things and free form user entries you can be very sure 
that someone out there will make your app blow up. And I don?t think that is a 
problem per s?, the problem comes when the bug isn?t dealt with the right way. 
There are only a handful of programs that are generally considered reasonably 
bug free. So if the Zend folks fix 171 bugs and got it right the second time 
around, then it for sure is something to brag about. I?d stop celebrating when 
the 171 bug fixes caused 271 other things to break or worse now break 371 
applications based on that platform. Still, it also gives 171 very good clues 
where the QA process failed and should result in at least 171 more test cases 
added to the test plans.


And if you think my emails are long you should see the test plans that I 
write.... ;)

You should file_get_contents to retrieve URLs, which is what you seem
to be trying to do. It doesn't handle failures (i.e. timeout,
redirects) very well at all. You should use curl if you need to
retrieve a remote file.
	$url = 'http://yourfile.com';
	$ch = curl_init();
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
	$result = curl_exec($ch);
	if ( $result===false ) {
		echo curl_errno($ch).' '.curl_error($ch);
	}
	curl_close($ch);

Obviously you would want to do something different in the event there
is an error. Hopefully curl is enabled on your hosting server.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] htaccess question - deafult behavior in one folder
Message-ID: <1241639160.9201.1314154115@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I have a site that uses the Zend framework. I want to run a blog at
/blog. I tried installing wordpress in an actual folder at /blog but my
htaccess is set to have anything that doesn't point to an actual file
redirect to index.php for zend. wordpress relies on blog/ directing to
blog/index.php. Here's what I've got:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule .* index.php

So I need a rule that says, 'anything in /blog, just do what you
normally do' but I'm not sure how to go about that. I've dug thru
htaccess tutorials but I'm not finding anything.

Thanks,

Corey

Here's how I accomplish that same thing for Trac instead of WordPress.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteBase /
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/trac
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	RewriteRule . index.php [L]
</IfModule>

This filters out any URIs that start with /trac or point to a file or
directory.

IIRC, you can use RewriteEngine Off to cancel rewrite rules in a parent 
.htaccess file.

Ooh, great! I actually combined the two responses. Adding:
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/blog
worked for /blog, but anything after blog (/blog/2009/my-post) still
gave me a 404. So then I added an .htaccess to /blog/ to redirect to
it's root and it worked. Thanks!

Hey Corey,

Try  !^/blog.*$ if you end up installing Drupal under Wordpress...
just kidding. But the fewer passes to mod_rewrite the happier everyone
is. That pattern ought to tell it to ignore anything after /blog in
the URL without any further rules.

mod_rewrite is mind blowing sometimes... Try the logging options to
see all the insanity behind the scenes.

I think the idea is that MySQL had a decent business model and was
doing quite well. If Oracle does decide to shitcan it, it's GPL'd
anyway and will live on kinda like CentOS does.

Besides that MySQL forked already and while I do like and use MySQL, there is 
still PostgreSQL (did I write that correctly, people always go bonkers when I 
write it wrong) and plenty of other options. Unless one has MySQL specific 
code (which would be a bad thing anyway) swapping out database engines should 
be fairly easy. Nice thing is that PHP supports pretty much any database 
engine out there.

We use PostgreSQL for our environments.  Although it is quite powerful there
are some ease of use issues with tuning and getting it to perform at its
maximum.  But the great thing about PostgreSQL is transactions right out of
the box, that has been the most useful feature so far.

I haven't had a chance to play with Oracle but I don't see them GPL'ing that
DB any time soon.  Clients pay too much to use it.

I've been experimenting with some cross-platform features in the past 
few weeks, and I found myself surprised that PostgreSQL is a lot more 
powerful and flexible than I had realized, even though I've used it 
almost exclusively for the past 4-5 years.

I was digging through the specs for MS SQL Server, and was surprised to 
find out how limited their triggers still are.  I sort of figured they 
would have rocketed forward since last I used the product.

Oracle seems to be the only contender for Postgres's overall power and 
flexibility (and here come the flames from those who say I put that 
backwards).

MySQL still has a lot of growing up to do:

1) Triggers cannot see the value of auto_increment columns
2) Triggers cannot write to the tables being affected
3) Triggers do not fire on delete cascade ???!!!?? WTF??
4) Insert undiscovered limitation here :)

But to their credit, they do have "INSTEAD OF" triggers on views, a very 
grown up feature.

There is still a soft spot in my heart for DB/2, since I got to code for 
it on the AS/400 years ago, it is also quite powerful and can be bent to 
your will with a little patience.

Same here, I am still a "noob" to the SQL game but I prefer PostgreSQL over
MySQL.  The one thing I do find rewarding is that at the end of the day I
can watch PostgreSQL run circles around MySQL in regards to performance.
But those nice to haves are missed that make MySQL user friendly for the
majority of the community (example: multiple inserts in one SQL statement,
for Postgres you would have to loop to process all your inserts).

Here is an example of a convenience that is not yet built into PostgreSQL
(and if it is please correct me as I am using 8.1.1).

INSERT INTO x (a,b)
VALUES
 ('1', 'one'),
 ('2', 'two'),
 ('3', 'three')

It seems like this was added in 8.2, it's been a while since I messed
around with PostgreSQL.

I think the biggest pain most of us face is that web development is
always of the oh-my-god-we-are-all-going-to-die-if-we-dont-launch-freaking-TOMORROW
variety of projects. If a client ever came to me and said "You know
Mitch, take your time on this one, I'd really like to see it done
right" I would die of a heart attack right on the spot. That or
immediately search for the hidden cameras, fully expecting to be on
Punked or something like that.

Regardless, one thing I've been into for a while is test driven
development, which although does slow down the development process
somewhat, also accelerates the test and debugging process:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development

It *is* possible to incorporate some sort of testing into the
development cycle, which is required when you start working on bigger,
more complex systems. Plus taking the TDD approach really forces you
(and your client) to fully understand just what it is that you need to
code, before you start coding. Project killing things like scope creep
then becomes a conscious act instead of a forced, constant and
unavoidable burden.

 hello mitch,
nicely put man and i totally know where you're coming from.? i to hate those type of projects where you're expected to create miracles to get a site up and running in a short amount of time.? not only perform the miracle, but brunt the pressures while developing with this tight deadline; not an easy task at all.

thanks for your post and hang in there :)

*group hug!!!

Well, let's hope you don't have any heart attacks soon! however, I do 
wonder how you *real* developers get specs and requirements? Are they 
that loose until you build and the client says "that's not what I wanted"?

Is there room or time for better requirements gathering up front so you 
save time down the road? That seems to be part of the TDD process; your 
requirements specify the tests. Or do I not get it?

Brent, you are a wonderful person! No matter what Hans, Mitch, David, 
and maybe a few others say...    :)

Wasn't able to change anything that would allow file_get_contents but 
the curl code you provided works like a charm! This is a growth point 
for me so it's nice to be successful for a change.

Thanks!

My usual answer: it depends :-)

Some PHP frameworks, as well supporting unit tests, go a little further 
and provide functional testing which simulates almost a full browsing 
session, 

e.g. in symfony:

// Create a new test browser
$browser = new sfTestBrowser();
 
$browser->
  get('/foobar/index')->
  isStatusCode(200)->
  isRequestParameter('module', 'foobar')->
  isRequestParameter('action', 'index')->
  checkResponseElement('body', '!/This is a temporary page/');


To test for cookies:

$b->test()->is($request->getCookie('foo'), 'bar');     // Incoming cookie
$cookies = $response->getCookies();
$b->test()->is($cookies['foo'], 'foo=bar');            // Outgoing cookie


To test redirects:

$b->
    get('/foobar/edit/id/1')->
    click('go', array('name' => 'dummy'))->
    isStatusCode(200)->
    isRequestParameter('module', 'foobar')->
    isRequestParameter('action', 'update')->
 
    isRedirected()->      // Check that the response is a redirect
    followRedirect()->    // Manually follow the redirection
 
    isStatusCode(200)->
    isRequestParameter('module', 'foobar')->
    isRequestParameter('action', 'show');


To check for certain elements in the DOM:

b->get('/foobar/edit/id/1');
$dom = $b->getResponseDom();
$b->test()->is($dom->getElementsByTagName('input')->item(1)->getAttribute('type'),'text');



I dont know about the Zend Library but symfony has had this for years 
which goes a long way towards encouraging TDD.

It's cheeky, but you can demand these things if you work for yourself.
If you can to calm the inner 'freakout' voice, you can usually convince
a client that doing it the right way is worth the little extra time
(money is another matter :-P ). When I was full-time freelance a few
years ago I had this epiphany. I had the luxury of a few regular clients
that I worked well with, so when a new client came thru my door, I set
high expectations. Sort of the other side of 'firing clients' is 'hiring
clients'. If yre not going to work well together, don't work with them.
But again you need to be in a position to not desperately need the work.

Although I work in a software company I?d guess the same mechanisms apply. 
Here our executive team has to sign off on a statement of scope, then a 
Business Analyst (could be a developer) writes a Functional Requirements 
document that details the expectations, how the UI is supposed to look like, 
and what happens when this or that button or so is clicked, when things are to 
be enabled or disabled, and so on. From that both test plans and tech spec s 
are created. The functional requirements, the tech spec, and the test plan are 
reviewed and signed off on. Next step is coding and showing the outcome in a 
peer review, but for more complex things it is recommended to add a "proof of 
concept" demo. The app doesn?t do much, but the requester gets an idea as to 
how things will look like and work. That point is the last point to make any 
changes. Often enough the requesters are not that technical and need something 
to look at and play around with to get an idea as to what they want. After 
such a proof of concept demo the project plan gets reviewed as well to include 
any time needed.
The developers need to be very sure about the requester being knowledgeable 
and educated enough to clearly state what they want. That includes asking more 
questions and IMHO also saying "No" to things.

Yes, yes, yes...anything you do not do in the beginning you will do later, 
just that it takes three times as much time and is three times as annoying. We 
had a few requests that sounded good at the beginning, but after several 
meetings we were neither on the same page nor did we have a good solution that 
everyone liked. We didn?t do that project and sent it back to the requestor. 
He came back with a much better request and with a lot of KISS we crafted an 
awesome feature. The users love it and it is even more than they needed and 
hoped for. The original approach would have taken twice as long overall and 
created a feature so intimidating and complicated nobody would have used it.
Spend a lot of time in the beginning to really hammer things out and to 
document everything, especially what the new foobar is not supposed to do. 
That way no one can come by and request that it does do that.
Process is hard and sticking to it even harder. And the first thing to go in a 
time crunch is communication, the second thing close behind is quality. So, 
yea, dear requester, you can have the new gadget in two months, but it will be 
crappy.

One nice thing about MySQL, however, is that replication is pretty easy. I
have no experience with PostgreSQL but after doing a little research it
looks like replication in PostgreSQL is a comparative PITA.

It can be a PITA sometimes.  The typical usage is the master-slave
replication.  Even with this type of replication there can be some data loss
too.

MySQL replication is great when it works.
With 5.1 they've introduced row-level replication (as opposed to 
statement-level replication) which can help in many cases (where you're 
using MySQL to do heavy processing, like their internal GIS functions).

MySQL replication can also fail silently in the presence of brief 
network disconnections.

It's not REAL redundancy (like Oracle RAC) but you get what you pay for, 
and having a slave for backup purposes is handy.

Yeah at my current company we are thinking of a master-slave implementation
and we can speed up the website by making read only requests head to the
slave server.  When working with MySQL is there a stop gap to prevent
requesting data from the slave that is currently in transit from the master
server? (I guess a check to see if it is in transit and if so it has to wait
for the slave to be updated.)

I liked the warm thanks, made my morning.
curl is very powerfull and it is a tool to have in your arsenal. The problem
is that many hosts have it disabled.

Does anyone know how the PHP Interpreter pulls switch/case statements
together?  Does it emulate a C compiler and, for larger case sets, build a
huge if/else cascade? Does it do this always?  Is there any way to know when
it builds a jump table (like a s/c is supposed to)?  I've got a slow script
(it's eating ~85% of execution time) that I can't work around and one of the
slower parts is a switch case (which is slightly faster than manually
building an if/else cascade) and was wondering if anyone had any performance
tips for cases like these.

If I remember correctly, if/else if/else statements are faster than Switch-Case. 

I would suggest converting them and see if you get a performance increase.

Hello,

How do you know the switch statement is your performance bottleneck? Did 
you profile the application?
Care to share the code?

Since PHP isn't really compiled, there are some inefficiencies when compared
with something like C.  I don't remember the exact mechanics, but switch is
generally slower than if/else and less optimizable (word?) when it comes to
opcode caching/etc..

How many cases do you have?  Could you refactor into a loop?  Are you doing
string comparisons, or can they be converted to numeric tests?  Could some
of the logic be reduced/spread out into a database or some other process?

Would this be a case where APC would decrease execution time of the script?

PHP should run ~1M switch tests per second on decent hardware.  Either
you are misinterpreting you profiling data, or running a switch
statement a hell of a lot of time.  I can't imagine any sort of
if/else vs switch vs. jump table is going to make much of a
difference.  At best you will see a speedup of 30% or so, but that
won't really fix the underlying problem.

I heard that the other way around, but that doesn't mean anything. I googled 
switch versus if else and looked at various speed tests that people did. I 
found a few articles discussing PHP specifically, such as this one: 
http://rob.sun3.org/php-code/switch-vs-if/
There it states: "The switch construct is generally more than twice as fast at 
matching a simple integer within a single large set of conditions."
In the end I think it matters only when that part of code gets hit many times 
so that half a second difference in execution really starts to hurt badly.

Contrary to that is the opinion demonstrated on this page: 
http://www.php.lt/benchmark/phpbench.php
Maybe the difference doesn't come out enough with only 1,000 iterations.

> I would suggest converting them and see if you get a performance increase.

Depending on how many switch cases there are that may be quite some effort. 
Switch takes the condition and tests against each case until it finds a match 
or gets to the end of the entire switch block. So if it has to go through many 
cases I could think of two less invasive changes:
- rearrange the order of the cases so that the most likely ones are at the top
- split the switch into multiple switches, but that depends on being able to 
organize the cases into groups

One other thought that comes to mind is that maybe not the switch statement 
itself is slow, but the code that gets executed once a case match is found. 
The comparison on the benchmark page mentioned above makes me believe that 
this might be an option.
Others already hinted to using a profiler, which is likely to be the quickest 
way to find the real bottleneck. What all pages I looked at suggested was 
using === instead of == for the comparison.

How about this for an idea:
Write the code so that the switch returns the content of the case as a 
function, this way, you can hopefully avoid having to do all those 
comparisons. (obviously you would then be able to use this anonymous 
function in place of the switch)

Not sure if your code would allow it tho.

I didn't think anonymous functions were ireleased until the 5.3 branch,  
which isn't near stable enough for production yet?

Has anyone had success implementing the Amazon API for both order entry to

having some issues and I was hoping to find a decent road map as Amazon is
not very helpful.  Thanks.

Anybody using Verizon's FIOS and have any comments? I am moving next week
(from Maplewood NJ to South Orange NJ) and considering ordering. I want to
make sure they don't do block you from connecting to your own machine via
http or ssh from outside your home. That would be a dealbreaker.

The other broadband alternative in this area is Cablevision. Any comments?
Thanks.

Cablevision isn't bad.. it depends on the density of "high use" 
customers in your area. I noticed several times this winter, when the 
neighborhood was snowed in, the throughput went to crap. All other times 
my downstream is about 13Mbps, upstream 1.5Mbps.  They block port 80, 
443, 1080 and 25, but you can still run your ssh on 22 and http on a 
different port.

I have a friend who has FiOS Internet service (in Garden City, NY), ordered
their TV service when his satellite contract expired, and then paid the
unreasonable cancellation fee to go back to satellite TV.  Apparently there
isn't enough bandwidth for both TV and Internet, and heavy Internet traffic
would screw up the TV signal.  I have no direct knowledge, so take this
story for what it's worth.

> Thanks.


I am no huge fan of Cablevision, but I have been a subscriber for going on 7
years now (much longer than that if you count living with my parents and
various roommates), and I have had virtually no significant trouble with
them.  It's pricey, and the DVR is no Tivo, but it works, and the HD looks
really nice.  (Especially the Mets and Giants, which is what matters to me
the most.)  I thought about switching to FiOS when Cablevision announced
Optimum WiFi, which I have used quite a bit more frequently than I expected
I would; for instance, standing on line at the deli or something, reading
e-mail on my iPhone.

Cablevision will probably wind up keeping me for life if they figure out
some way I can set the DVR over the Internet, like other providers do.

AFAIK Verizon blocks port 80. I used a webhop from DynDNS to make it easier 
for people. You can find out a lot from dslreports forums.

I have TimeWarner, which is awesome....if it works. And all ports wide openon 
their end.

Yeah, I should have mentioned that part.  I don't use a thumbdrive, because
I can just ssh into my home machine from school (or Panera or wherever) and
access whatever files I need.

PS Are there any ISPs left that don't block port 80?

BTW, something else I just thought of, which might matter.  Even though my
Cablevision IP is assigned by DHCP, in practice it never changes, because
the router is always on to renew the lease.  The last time my IP address
changed was when I moved to my current apartment, which will be three years
ago in a couple of weeks.  And since I already own a domain name (for my
band), I assigned a subdomain of it to my Cablevision IP address, so that
now I don't even have to remember the IP address to log in to home; I just
have to remember the name of my band.

Over the yearsI have been through several DSL providers that went belly up
or otherwise became unacceptable (i.e., Speakeasy after it got bought), and
I have more recently been with Comcast, and with all those that were dynamic
IP I have never had any trouble thanks to dyndns.org. Now the Linksys router
I use has a whats-its, dynamic ip updater client built right in, and it's
been flawless. Interestingly, none of these ISPs has blocked port 80 on me.

btw you said "I thought about switching to FiOS when Cablevision announced
Optimum WiFi..." I take it you mean you were considering switching and then
did not? So Optimum Wifi has been good for you? That's interesting. I might
be nice to take advantage of it on NJ Transit trains which I ride every day
and I've been seeing those billboard ads for it in the train stations.

Since we're OT here, I'll throw in that if your IP does change, but
doesn't change often, dyndns gets mad and cancels your account for not
updating enough. What I did to get around that is write a shell script
that checks whatismyip.com (via it's automation specific page) and if
the IP of the machine has changed, my script emails me to tell me.

Hello,

Woah - I've never heard of such a thing. I've been using dydns for 
almost 4 years now, my IP rarely changes,
and I've never had an interruption of service.

Did they specifically say they canceled your account due to "lack of 
dynamicness" heh?

First they emailed to say "we've noticed your IP address hasn't changed
in a while". Then they emailed to say "sorry buddy, sign up for another
free account when your IP is more dynamic". Then a few days later, my IP
changed finally, and I was stuck.

Might just be a term of service for free accounts? Who knows? But at
least it gave me an excuse to learn about whatismyip.com's web
service :)

Hey,

Oh, free account. Ok - I just pay the $15/year and be done with it.
Well worth it for their service.

Many many providers now routinely block SMTP (port 25) though.

Last I checked, Time Warner definitely blocks port 25 in Brooklyn (I'd
imagine everywhere).  Everything not mail-related seems to be wide open
though.

I've been using Cablevision's Optimum Boost service in CT for about 2 and 
a half years.   The Boost package lets you use ports 25 and 80 (only those 
2 officially, but you can use others), so I've been hosting my mail and 
Web server at home with an IP address that's been de facto static this 
whole time (though they don't officially call it static).

http://www.optimum.com/order/boost/
 
One caveat, they recently changed the frequency on which Boost customers 
get Internet service in order to prepare for the 101Mbps service later 
this year (
http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/cablevision-101mbps-for-9995-102133?nocomment=1
).  This new frequency is less tolerant of bad wiring in your place but 
also your neighbors who might feed interference back on the line.   So ask 
them if there have been reports of problems in your new neighborhood.



Thanks,
-Dan

As someone that lived in South Orange (Seton Hall Alumni) you are going to
be disappointed with Cablevision and their support.

Best of luck.

There are plenty of clients that send an update once a month to keep dyndns 
happy. But sure, you can write your own.

Basically, yeah, any SIGs are welcome.  What are you thinking?  We just want
to make sure there isn't too much overlap with existing SIGs, and that we
don't dilute the lists too much so level of organization is important.

Let me know what you're thinking and we can also continue this discussion on
the NYPHP-Org list.

I have had FIOS for the last year 20/20 for the first few months and  
then I dropped down to 20/5 because 20/20 was more than I needed.
I have loved it and dreaded ever relocating to an area where FIOS is  
not available.  I have had almost 0 downtime.

The only problem I have faced with FIOS has to do with the phone  
service and I can only speak for my area.  It seems like evertime a  
snowflake hit the ground
my phone would not work.  It would just say "Due to phone company  
issues we are unable to complete your call"

If you hit redial about 20 times generally it goes through at some  
point :)

Subscribe and check the archives.  I'll also be posting another note
tomorrow, but basically just a laptop that you're comfortable working on for
coding is required.

Probably because not many people can get it. Not widely available in 
Manhattan yet...

BTW, several years ago the rules changed so that local telco's dont have 
to share fiber like they do for copper (very monopoly-friendly). But it 
seems Verizon has made a deal with DSL Extreme for wholesale fiber, so 
they are the first company to offer second-tier fiber.

Don't know if they have any facilities in NYC though.

Hi,

 

The London PHP User group recently held a Test Fest at IBM in the London on
the 9th of May and one of the organisers was Zoe of IBM (UK).You could take
a peek at her blog
http://zoomsplatter.blogspot.com/2009/02/php-testfest-2009.html  and maybe
ask her advice on what you should/need to take to your test fest

 

Cheers

 

Paul

Was getting a ride from a guy who owned a communications services
company, and we discussed megabit services in Brooklyn. He mentioned
that Brooklyn was notorious for having totally substandard wiring
running down poles between all the houses and buildings, and that it
was a logistics nightmare for Verizon to manage making upgrades nearly
impossible - and the result is that pretty much nobody in the city can
get more than typical 1.5MBps DSL. Better chances for faster service
in Cambodia.

Add that I constantly lose my DSL link and Verizon has failed to
figure this out for A YEAR AND A HALF, the time is right.

I'm ordering a cable modem today. This pain must stop.

That is the part that I still don't get as a foreigner. Why is most of the 
infrastructure here in the US in such a bad state? I can see nailing wires to 
poles like Edison did it in the remote, rural areas, but in Brooklyn?? Why 
isn't all wiring underground where it won't come down during the slightest 
storm? And why do all the streets have more potholes than markings when the 
entire US economy is built around individual traffic and trucking everything 
across the country, although using rail is so much more efficient....but the 
rail lines are in horrible shape as well. Last week I heard that one third of 
the NYC sewer system is from the 1850s, while the rest is mainly from the 
1930s, and all parts are crumbling. And why do US schools spend more than 
twice per student compared to schools in Europe, but get results that are 
noticably worse? I don't say there is no (good) reason for all that, I just 
can't figure out which one that could be.
UTP doesn't have the bandwith like coax does, but in the biggest economy in 
the world (maybe second by now behind China) the question should be from which 
of the five competitors do I buy fiber service. I agree that chances for 
faster service may be better in Cambodia, but it shows that deregulating the 
markets for the benefit of the consumers just turned out to be a whole bunch 
of blahblah.

That said, I like what TWC has to offer...if it works. I do need to point out 
that their support just plain sucks, yet it is still better than Verizon's.

Enough of the mid day rant.... ;)

    Heck,  even rural areas are catching up.  Here's a photo of how we 
get DSL in our neck of the woods:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/paul_houle/3340856649/

    The architecture is that they have 2 DSL lines:  one that goes from 
the box to the CO,  and another that goes to your house.  These work 
pretty well,  though it would be better if they sent fiber to the 
repeaters.  Service is reasonably reliable,  though it sometimes seems 
to go down on the weekend.  Cable is available about a mile and a half 
down the road.  Time Warner has considered running cable down my valley 
but there's not that much demand:  anybody who wants TV already has 
satellite.

    My main beef with the service is with their DNS.  The default DNS is 
(i) slow,  and (ii) points you to a bogus web site for names that don't 
resolve.  Running a local djbdns server makes it feel like I added a turbo.

That is the price we pay for things getting invented over here. Radio
is another example. First time I saw a car radio in Switzerland and
the name of the song was displaying I almost had a heart attack. Then
I used something called TeleText to check the news on a TV, without
internet access.

Simple things to a European, but totally tomorrow-land stuff to an
American. We may have invented TV and radio over here, but we also are
stuck supporting the caveman-era technologies that were rolled out
when they were first invented.

The Europeans sat back, and watched us blow our fingers off with our
experiments; and when the pain stopped and things started looking
really good, they said "Hey, this whole radio thing is a brilliant
idea, and we can include text in our broadcast as well."

For Brooklyn, the problem is that the original cabling was hung from
poles going behind all the houses. Say you are Verizon, and you want
to do the Right Thing by putting in modern facilities. You are going
to have to contact every tenant for every residence to get permission
to go out back and replace that cabling. Let me know when you are
done, assuming I live that long.

it belonged

Ok, that was qmail, not his dns daemon, but it was funny to me at least.

I think this is very true - the exact same can be said for why the roads
suck in the Northeast while in other parts of the country you get the
sprawling highways of tomorrow (and yet everyone still drives 50 MPH there).

Anyway, I read this a while back and it's an interesting series:

http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/the-broadband-gap-why-is-theirs-fas
ter/

And for the record, I have FIOS and really can't complain - I switched from
TWC and haven't looked back.  The only slightly annoying thing is that the
first-hop latency is about 20ms which they won't do anything about.  It's
hard to notice but just sort of annoying.

That said, I don't have any servers at home anymore (amazing!) so I haven't
really checked out any ports.  I suppose I could move nyphp.org back to my
home connection and see if it still works :)

Mitch,

I do believe that when you start service with a company such as the  
electric or cable, etc. they have right of passage to the phone polls  
at anytime.  I recall reading about this online a while back when one  
got caught in a womans back yard and she threw a fit.  However it  
stated they were not at fault and had all rights to access the utility  
equipment.  I'm sure this would not work at 3am or anything unless  
there was an emergency but you get the idea.

Uhm, TV in the sense we'd consider it today was invented by Paul Nipkow, at 
least the technology for serializing images with an electromechanical camera 
(the serialization of images in dots was invented by Bain, which makes fax to 
predate the phone). The first full electronic camera was invented and built by 
Manfred von Ardenne. The cathode ray tube was already known by then as 
Ferdinand Braun invented it in 1897. Also, the Reichspostministerium installed 
the first cable TV network for the 1936 Olympic Games, which also was the 
first sporting event to be broadcast live (albeit entirely for propaganda 
reasons). So TV wasn't invented here, but in Germany. Nevertheless, here 
(meaning explicitly the Electric City) had the first commercial TV station 
(still exists as WRGB CBS6 in Niskayuna) and among the first TV broadcasts, 
namely a conductor at the GE plant directing an orchestra at Proctor's via TV 
link.
Radio was mainly invented by Nicola Tesla, a Croatian who was brought to the 
US by Edison. After inventing all kinds of stuff for Edison Tesla asked for 
the promised payment and Edison laughed at him saying "Welcome to America!". 
Tesla then went on to work for Edison's arch rival Westinghouse who pulled the 
same scam.
And phone was invented by Johann Philip Reis, who demoed it as a geek's gadget 
where Bell saw it and eventually copied the idea making money with it. The 
first sentence spoken over telephone was "Das Pferd i?t keinen Gurkensalat." 
(The horse does not eat cucumber salad).

The Teletext was invented by the BBC and is one of the most awesome additions 
to TV. I have no clue why it never ever even got introduced in the US market. 
Probably someone bought the patent rights and wanted wayyyy too much money for 
it to make it viable for TV makers and stations.

RDS (Radio Data System) was thought out by ARI in Germany. It was available, 
but it never became that popular, mainly because the displays on radios aren't 
that big.

Ah, that explains it...and then again it doesn't. Apparently, they were able 
to pull that off at some point, because otherwise they wouldn't have had the 
cable where it is now. It should be possible to keep the UTP for the short 
haul and still get decent bandwidth, at least for phone and internet service. 
If it fits 500 HDTV channels is something I don't know. I just wonder how 
other countries manage to do that. I recall when Schwarz-Schilling rolled out 
broadband cable across Germany the folks from the phone company dug up 
people's front yards and screwed the access box on the outside of the house 
and if possible they even drilled through the foundation and put it straight 
into the basement. It was an act of congress to do that and the funding came 
from the government. I have to point out that at that time the phone and cable 
service was provided by a federal telecom agency, similar to how USPS is 
operating here.

Seems to be more that Verizon just doesn't want to put the effort in and still 
makes enough money with the POTS and less so with the PANS.

This is plain crazy. Folks manage to fix a minivan sized space telescope in 
orbit, but putting fiber into Brooklyn is impossible?

Sorry, but having an apprenticeship as radio- and TV technician, having 
studied communication technology, and having worked as broadcasting engineer 
for TV stations makes me get so passionate about this stuff.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP 5.3 add_x_header Broken
Message-ID: <000901c9da62$ccb73a20$6625ae60$@com>

Hello,

I wanted to check to see if anyone else had been seeing this issue before
reporting a bug.

In PHP 5.3, there's the mail.add_x_header configuration setting.  When On,
which is the default with the preferred/production php.ini, it adds the
X-PHP-Originating-Script email header for tracking purposes of email.

However, when the X-PHP-Originating-Script header is added, it's prefixed
with a \r\n.  This thus breaks some email clients, especially when sending
from a Unix host where all the other headers are separated by only a \n.

When mail.add_x_header is set to off the emails are sent correctly.

There appears to be no workaround, especially since there are so many email
clients, each with their own behavior.  End of the day, the email header
line breaks should be consistent.

Has anyone else ran into this or any other thoughts?

H

Well, last I looked, the mail format RFC says the headers are supposed to 
be \r\n.  But it sounds like the rest of the headers generated by PHP are 
using \n.  Fun.

Let's take a look at mail.c...
http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/standard/mail.c?view=log

Yep, the rest of the headers use \n.

Make a patch to line 244 changing \r\n to \n (Or change them all to \r\n 
like the RFC says. :) and open up a bug report.

I have in my W2K3 with IIS 6 (port 80) + php5.1.2 + mysql5.5.1.a  and it
works.

I want to be able to use Apache with port 3333 with the same mysql so
I tried to set up a W2K3 + apache2.2 + php5.29 + mysql 5.5.1.a and
everything
works except that I am not able to access mysql.  Is there something that I
might
have skip.

Thanks,

Well, you definitely skipped telling us exactly how it doesn't work.  :)
What's the error message you get and what do you do to get it?

So uncomment the mysql extension (eg "extension=php_mysqli.dll") line in 
the php.ini file specified in the "Loaded Configuration File" section of 
your phpinfo() output.

I have all of the extensions that I want uncommented. I have other set
ups running php + mysql, but this is the first time that I tried running it
in a W2K3 and using the same mysql for IIS and Apache and different php's.
PHP can see other extensions but it is not able to  see mysql.  That is what
I am trying to find out.

The Apache error log says:
PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library
'D:/php5/ext\\php_mysql.dll' - The specified procedure could not be
found.\r\n in Unknown on line 0 PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load
dynamic library 'D:/php5/ext\\php_mysqli.dll' - The specified procedure
could not be found.\r\n in Unknown on line 0

The directory "D:\php5\ext\" is the directory where I have my files.  I just
do  not know why it is unable to load the dynamic libraries?

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

Are the files actually there?  Does the Apache service have permission to 
read those files?

Yes to all your questions.

I think the difference might be that this is the first time that I did a PHP
automatic install instead of a manual.  I am removing PHP and I will do a
manual install, to see if it makes a difference.

I will find soon is the automatic PHP install is the problem.

Thanks,

I'd like to build a feature that will allow someone to enter a zip and  
a radius and have the page display all the contacts that are within  
the specified radius of that location.  (I have a db table to query  
that has contacts and their address information, including zips.)

Has anyone found a class or code that they like that will do this?

Displaying results on a map would be a sweet bonus but is not required.

Aaron:

I have one...but need to dig it up...ping me off list if you are interested.

BTW...does your db table include geo-codes for the addresses...this is key
for both parts of what you would like to do.

I used to do a bit of GIS stuff.

Here is what you need to do.

1) Import a list of zip codes & lat/lng centroids into your database.
The data is here:
http://www.census.gov/tiger/tms/gazetteer/zips.txt

2) Geocode all of your contacts, and store the lat/lng coordinates
with the contacts. Google has a free geocoding service.  You need a
google api key, and they only allow 10,000 queries per day per IP.
Depending on how many contacts you have, this may take several days to
get all of the coordinates.
The docs are here:
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/index.html

3) Read up on the Haversine formula.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula

Once you have these three pieces, you will be able to calculate the
distance between contacts and any zip code.

Regards,
John Campbell

Paul,

I would be interested in looking at the code of the class too, just to
see how something like that works.

Thanks

Great stuff, thanks John!

I got my Google API Key and am reading up on geocoding now  Never  
tried something like this before so it looks like I've got some  
learning to do.

There is actually a class available google it in includes basic script  
and database with zipcodes and long and lat points.  I think it even  
factors in for the curvature of the earth.  Used it a way back.

Yep, Geocode a list of addresses, export lat, lng file. Suck into the  
iPhone, parse the file, build a store locator that knows where I am,  
link those pins to a mysql db, spit out some more xml soup.   Fun stuff.

Mapkit 3.0 is wild. ;-)

Search google + php + map + geocode

What a nightmare. Can you possibly use the same php version and files
for both? Go with CGI and the latest stable php windows installer all
around and you might have an easier time at it.

Cleverly sending data during the blank interval, Teletext is great. They 
had a similar thing here but it never caught on. Seems its cheaper to have 
500 channels for info than using something like Teletext perhaps? Or maybe 
the not-invented-here symdrome kicked in...

Sure, but I could also argue a lot of important inventions weren't 
invented here (radar, jet engines, web browsers, etc), but I think a lot 
of American either dont know or forget.

There are a lot of other forces at play here. Verizon for years had to 
share and the cable companies did not. So there's no incentive for Verizon 
to improve facilties. Now that they dont *have* to share their network, 
they can just sit back and wait for the fiber rollout (effectively locking 
out any competition from anyone else). Ive seen whole building where the 
copper has been replaced by fiber. So noone else can sell services into 
that building. Pretty neat strategy.

I had a friend who signed up for Verizon FiOS TV. They showed up and 
replaced ALL of his copper with fiber, including his phone. Unfortunately, 
he has DSL on the phoneline so he lost Internet access - took them two 
weeks to 'fix' it.

Why do I know a lot about this crap? Well, I used to work for a local ISP 
- we've seen all the BS, tricks and games from Verizon...

Without competition, be prepared for things to be crappy for a long long 
time.

Exactly what I thought when I moved to the US - it seems Im not weird for

Precisely why I was reluctant to get involved with Verizon -- that, and the
fact that they have jerked me around in the past.

But -- by way of update -- we got our FIOS installation last week and the
Internet service is outstanding, I have to admit. The web interface to their
router lets you do any damn thing you can think of, as though you were a
small business rather than a home user (same interface for both, maybe?).
And we've no complaints about speed.

TV is another story. We discovered too late that my wife's old Series 2 Tivo
box won't record the channel you want unless you manually tune the box
yourself -- hard to do when you aren't home to attend to it. And one of our
two Verizon boxes evidently does not work although I am not quite finished
fiddling and troubleshooting. The other day I spent more hours than I care
to think about screwing around and talking to tech support. I will say to
Verizon's credit that they answer the phones and their people seem to have a
basic working knowledge of what they are talking about.

Main reason? Corruption built on a political machine that is still
alive (if not as well as it used to be).

Kings (Brooklyn) was last county in the US to get cable television, in
like the late 80s. You have to hire the right people if you want to
tear up the streets, you know what I mean?

Well, if they would at least tear up the streets. Another thing I don't get is 
the notoriously unreliable installation of infrastructure on what amounts 
sturdy bean poles. The whole shebang is down in a moderate storm and becomes 
flaky as soon as it rains. Besides that, one of the top reasons for phone 
outages are trash trucks who back into the phone poles. I don't even go into 
detail about phone poles and traffic safety....

Well, way back in the late 80s I visited friends in East Germany. Two things 
really struck me odd: getting a table assigned in an ordinary restaurant and 
the "Employee of the Month" displays with picture in grocery stores.
Fast forward 10 years, my first visit to the US: I get a table assigned at 
Friendly's and the "Employee of the Month" displays in the stores were 
identical in make and design like those in communist East Germany. Seems as if 
there isn't much difference after all.
And Karl Marx intended his ideas to be implemented in highly industrialized 
countries, like England. Not in farm-based economies like Russia. I am sure 
he'd still rotate in his grave if he could. But communism isn't bad, only the 
first 500 years are tough.

Guys in the past I have used interfaces and have do not recall hitting  
this issue.

I have the following interface

<?php

interface Pagable
{
	private function getPreviousPage();
	private function getNextPage();
	private function getCurrentPage();
	private function getStartPage();
	private function getLastPage();
	private function getTotalPages();
	
	public function getPageString();
	public function getTotalResults();
}

class YP_Listing_Handler implements Pagable
{

	...
	private function getPreviousPage()
	{
		return $this->getCurrentPage() - 1;
	}
	...
}

I keep getting this error.

Fatal error: Access type for interface method  
Pagable::getPreviousPage() must be omitted in /Applications/MAMP/ 
htdocs/yp/inc/Pagable.php on line 5


I am not sure what is causing it but if I remove the private keyword  
then it complains that it must be declared public in the class.

Is there a reason I cannot declare a method as being private in the  
interface?

Thanks,
Joseph Crawford

Interfaces are, by design, intended to have public methods that are
supposed to be implemented by classes that implement the interface with
the implements keyword. At least thats the way the books I've read
explain it.

THanks for pointing that out, I guess I am a bit confused as to why  
they are restricted to public but it answers my question :)

Thanks Again.

The general idea is that everything behind the interface is a black
box, so that a class which implements interface foo can be replaced
with any other class which implements interface foo.

Private methods, being private, are inside of that black box. They
literally don't matter as far as the interface is concerned, because
they can not be called from outside the class.

If you're asking, "Why should I use interfaces?" the answer is
probably only "Because you want to be rigorous and/or satisfy an
externally imposed requirement that you implement particular
interfaces." Most PHP projects are going to be to small and too fluid
to really take advantage of them.

You can get all the benefits of interfaces without actually writing
them out formally by only relying on well-documented public methods
and not accessing properties directly.

The main purpose of interface is to have a well defined and correctly
implemented fluent interface between 2 code pieces.

If you want to have a particular method as invisible to other classes,
I'd suggest you to create an abstract class that trigger errors on
each protected function. Remember that protected functions when
overloaded can continue as protected OR as public.


Cheers,

I think the idea is that by defining and interface you are planning to
implement common methods across multiple classes. If you were going to
make the methods private, you'd probably design your classes in such a
way that the abstract base class contained a protected method that you
could redefine in child classes? Or maybe a private method in a
non-abstract parent class (since a private method in an abstract class
would make no sense, considering you cannot instantiate an abstract
class there'd be no way to call that method).

If you're using an interface at all, it seems that you are doing so
because you want to take advantage of the ability to share common
methods among several classes, or take advantage of PHP's only form of
multiple inheritance, since you cannot extend a class from multiple
parents but you can implement multiple interfaces. If something is
intended to be private, putting it in an interface (which is sort of
designed to be shared) wouldn't really make sense.

I tend to think of an interface in a physical sense, for example the
interface to a door. Every door has some means to open it and close it,
and thus implements a common interface. It's something all doors share.
We couldn't really define how to open every door because some have a
door-knob, some might have a handle, some might use a motion sensor,
some you just push. Same goes for close() - with some doors you push the
door the other way, or turn the handle the other way, or you might even
just let the door go and it will close by itself. Either way, this is
something that all the doors would share(the ability to be opened and
closed), and the knobs or handles or what-have-you, are all intended to
be used by another class (a person?). Having a private method in the
interface that would be shared among all doors wouldn't make much sense.
On the other hand, a magnetic door might have a private
unlockMagnetSensorThing() method, a door with a knob might have private
methods that deal with the knob's internals?

That's how I think of it anyway, I'm not an expert but I hope it might
help!

Did you use a direct connection or an IR blaster from Tivo->cable box? I 
also have a Tivo S2, and use the IR blaster stuck to the front of the 
cable box...

The best TV service Ive seen is AT&T Uverse which uses some clever 
multicasting. But its not available anywhere around New York City.

Here we go, way off topic :)

As an amateur historian, I'd say socialism cannot be attempted yet 
because Marx's historical antecedents are not yet in place.  Marx said 
capitalism would have to make over the entire world, and that process 
was stunted severely in the 20th century by Leninist regimes, which 
really did nothing more than invent industrial feudalism.  As a reaction 
against those regimes, capitalist regimes were more lenient towards 
things like trade unions than they might have been, allowing substantial 
industrial middle classes to grow up (which now of course are disappearing).

Now that the regimes are largely gone, and even China is going 
capitalist, the process of having capitalism dominate the globe is now 
in full swing.  For us amateur historians, the thing to watch is 
separation between rich and poor.  A dramatic separation is required in 
order for the proletariat to become class conscious. 

But like many, I don't really believe the proles would suddenly become 
class conscious if capitalism somehow "won" and we all became slaves to 
the owners of the means of production.  That type of thing borders on 
science fiction a la Clark's "Childhood's End" or Vinge's "singularity" 
concept.

End of totally off-topic comments.

Oh yeah, PHP is great.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I've been asked to brief the group about the PHP TestFest held this past 
Saturday.

Most importantly, the six of us had fun.  It took a while for me to to 
get everyone up to speed with the whole phpt thing, but once we got 
going, it was rewarding.

We focused on ext/dom/document.c, which should now have nearly everything
covered with basic tests, plus there are some variations.  I'm looking
forward to seeing the new code coverage output. :)

There's talk of NYPHP hosting testing activities on a more regular basis.  
We'll keep you posted.

Thanks,

--Dan

I tried, but could not for the life of me locate the IR sensor on the
Verizon box. Wait... you say IR emitters attached to the front of the
*cable* box?  I thought it was the other way around, i.e., that the Tivo box
had to send commands to the cable box and therefore the emitters went on the
tivo.

They plug in to the TiVo, and the IR LEDs should be pointed at the
cable box's IR sensor.

Hmm... here is from 2000?

Sort of funny to look back through the ages - some things never change, like

Good Day All:

 

Would anyone support a new SIG called maybe "NYPHP Tech" or "NYPHP
Techcetera".

 

In this SIG we could all post w/o guilt all our tech and tech-related
questions, things such as:

1) best laptop

2) best linux distro

3) best google map mashup

4) best wireless hotspot provider

5) best computer store online

6) most tech friendly airline

7) best hi-energy drink for computer work

8) SEO questions

9) best city for tech jobs

10) best smart phone(s)

11) best? 

 

I personally would love this. Because I really respect the people on
this list and I know 

they know technology real well not just PHP.

 

What do you think?

 

 

Warmest regards,

Right, just as I thought. Which is why I am thwarted b/c i cannot find the
damn IR sensor on the cable box.

work but on an MS OS
just re-start afterwards to play it safe.

Hmm.......  I just typed up the following response and realized you want the
other side of the equation.   Dur...  Here is my response anyway.
 
I have not done it for PHP work, but I have for .NET.  I ended up sub-ing a
bunch of work out to people in Malaysia using http://www.rentacoder.com.  I
thought the interface was intuitive and effective.  I had no problems using
the escrow system and the transactions went smoothly.
 
I sought out the coders with the HIGHEST feedback and then gave them work in
progressive amounts.  I made sure their communication, English, skills were
sufficient to communicate and that they delivered work on time and feature
complete.  This of course was dependent on me delivering complete
specifications with reasonable and clear expectations assigned.
 
I had a lot of luck this way and would do it again for .NET work and if I
got desperate, I might do it for PHP.  Though because we have a pretty deep
talent pool here, I shouldn't be forced into that position.
 
On a separate but related note, if you are interested in sub-ing PHP jobs,
drop me an email off-list and I will take a look at your work and add you to
the pool.

Hi Folks:

> www.rentacoder.com

Someone I respect mentioned that site worked well for them.  I then went 
and looked at it and was turned off by it.

15% is a big cut.

More importantly, their FAQ says you can not use third party code (see 
the "What is third party code?" section) or reuse code (in the "Why can I 
not re-use my own code?" section) and that your product is a work for 
hire (a la the "What does .Work made for hire. mean??" section).

As it turns out, I have ended up specializing in helping businesses
greatly improve their 

presence on the web with a modern, well-designed website that really
speaks well for 

the business entity. My new sites will freshly amplify the best aspects
of the business entity 

and often revitalizes how the staff, clients and vendors view the
business. 

This site, though, does or does not need to be dynamic PHP. 

 

Joomla In Every Job 

But I am considering initiating a plan to build all my website projects
on top of Joomla 

even if the client has only a few or no dynamic PHP needs. But this will
allow me to 

introduce the most common dynamic PHP tools at any time if needed.

 

Does anyone have any thoughts on such a move? Is it worth the hassle of
customizing a CMS like 

Joomla even if I may not be using the structure right now?

I wish to point out that the SEO section Ch. 8 in this book is one of
the best info-filled fastest reads 

that acts as a strong fairly techie intro to practical, on the web page
SEO concepts. Once a coder /designer digests 

the technical details discussed here it would potentially allow a
coder/designer to design and write some good 

SEO technique into a web job right from scratch.

I'd say that all web projects would start off with either a CMS (like
Joomla or Drupal); or a framework.  I'd think the vast majority of
websites can be handled with a CMS while in rarer cases where you are
building custom functionality (i.e. an application) you'd use a
framework.   I don't know how a client would not need "dynamic PHP".
All clients need to update or add content and need to accept some
forms (e.g. contact).

No client wants to learn HTML, and they usually don't have those
skills on staff.

Maybe some clients would be happy to outsource content management - in
which case you could use an old-fashioned approach of editing HTML for
content.   Still, in those cases (e.g. dog groomer wants a brochure
site), I'd think the low hanging fruit would be solved with services
like Google sites, while slightly more expensive projects would be
served by implementing your "stock" Joomla.  By "stock" I mean the
specific configuration of the system that you've come to know and
deploy to serve as a base.

One key issue for sites based on a CMS is that the client should
understand that periodic patching must occur to keep the underlying
application up-to-date.  This is both a business opportunity for the
developer/consultant and also an argument for using hosted services
whether that service is Google Sites, or a hosting provider who
maintains the Joomla install.

In my experience (building sites since 1996), a lot of sites can be 
implemented on top of Joomla / Drupal / etc., especially if they are 
essentially brochure sites.

But some sites need additional functionality. If you're lucky, that 
functionality will be available in a plugin. If you're not lucky, you'll 
have to write that plugin yourself or modify an existing one. Which also 
means you will have to manage that plugin yourself when it comes time to 
upgrade and/or patch some bug. Sometimes a client will want additional 
functionality maybe some time after a site has launched, forcing you to 
again find a plugin or write one. Again, your maintenance burden is 
raised.

At a certain point, you will find that the amount of work required to 
customize and maintain Joomla and any associated plugins is the same 
amount of work (or more), as writing the site yourself with a modern 
framework. After working with Joomla for a few years, Ive mostly abandoned 
using it for sites I build - I now just use a framework. A lot of 
frameworks now come with a backend, or a way to generate a backend, or a 
plugin that adds the backend for you. Its easier and more flexible to work 
with than using Joomla IMHO.

I tend to see good reason for doing exactly this,

It can allow your development lifecycle to be enhanced

 

I personally have two system cores that I use for clients who aren?t using
our proprietary tech, Joomla (with a few mods that I?m working on a document
to describe which will be placed on my personal site soon) and Drupal
(either my own breed - or acquia if enterprise level).

 

Doing this has allowed me to lower prices for clients without losing out on
the needed income levels. Primarily I find that having a detailed setup plan
in writing for the core and module configs makes life very simple. One of
the key reasons is I?ve invested in memberships for a few theme template
sites, a ton of different modules such that I can install a site quickly to
meet nearly any need. Need content versioning, multiple roles, non-profit
group tracking (donations, groups, mailing lists, tracking), event
management. But most of all I personally like the ability for smaller
clients to self update sites without needing a huge degree of
?html/css/etc?? know-how. I?ve given local restaurants the ability to update
sites that they normally would have to have someone else update - taking the
delay out of the potential issues caused by a client sending an email or
phone dictation, and giving you time to work with newer clients or just
simply to get a larger clientele.

 

So in short yeah - I would strongly suggest this.

 

(my last and more internal reason is simply that if for some reason we?re to
disappear off the planet my client could still run their own site without my
existence)
