I like this stuff as well. It is very useful when editing some data that 
comes from DB, and while updating it when some conditions fails, values 
came from DB and values changed by users both can be checked and 
retained in form. Like below.

$phoneVal=isset($_POST['phone']) ? $_POST['phone'] : $someRow->phone;

However there are many use of these operators. One can use in their 
preferred way as he/she likes.

Thanks,

How is this possible? I have a site hosted at Yahoo and am using the 
following code to display the date/time at the top of the page. Works 
fine, except-- every once in a while, the date is one full day off. 
For example, on the 28th of this month at about 10pm, the page said 
it was the 29th at 10pm. Later on, it was fine and said the right 
date. Yahoo, of course, says it's not them, but what else could it 
be? Thanks in advance.

$hourdiff = "-4";
$timeadjust = ($hourdiff * 60 * 60);
echo date("l") . "<br>" . date("F jS, Y") . "<br>" . date("g:i:s a", 
time() + $timeadjust) . "&nbsp;NYC";

There is an error in your code.
You will always have the correctly adjusted hour because of

 date("g:i:s a", 
time() + $timeadjust) 


But your date will be wrong for 4 hours every day because of

echo date("l") . "<br>" . date("F jS, Y")


You need to add your time adjust to each of those dates.
Try
$adjusted_time = time() + $timeadjust;

echo date("l",$adjusted_time) . "<br>" . date("F jS, Y",$adjusted_time);
date("g:i:s a", $adjusted_time) ;

I prefer to use mktime for converting dates, but I guess that's just a
preference.

$dateConversion = date('Y-m-d', mktime(date('H')-4, date('i'), date('s'),
date('m'), date('d'), date('Y')));

The blacklist in PHP Input Filter doesn't include the style attribute,
which can be used in a whole class of XSS attacks that involve
obscuring a page's real content with content of an attacker's
choosing.

Of course, stripping the style attribute will also break some of the
markup generated by most WYSIWYG html editors, so perhaps that's a
necessary compromise? It seems easy enough to ask it to strip style
attributes on demand.

I'm the one that linked to it from the PHPSC Library, but I don't use 
it. It has a strong reputation, and I like the general approach - as a 
developer, you get to choose exactly what behavior you want.

I always write my own filtering logic, and I use the conventions that I 
described in the talk (simple naming convention, variable 
initialization, etc.).

You might be confusing this with something else. You get to specify 
exactly what your blacklist (or whitelist) of tags and attributes is.

Hope that helps.

You mention hash keys and random factors, but remember that a bot will
necessarily have access to any secrets that you send to its human
owner. You can make scripting difficult, but you will never be able to
make it impossible. If the incentive to cheat is high enough, your
valued users will find ways around javascript voodoo, captchas,
rate-limiting, IP-address limitations and any other barriers you put
in their way.

As Billy Reisinger already pointed out, it is a much better idea to
concentrate on detecting and dealing with fraud rather than preventing
it outright. In other words, the solution to this problem is social
rather than technological.

First, define the acceptable-use envelope: how fast can a user
accumulate points? Are users allowed to team up? Are users allowed to
log in from multiple locations? Are users allowed to sell their points
on e-Bay? Write a plain-language Terms of Service that explains what
is acceptable, what is not, and how you intend to deal with attempts
at defrauding the system.

Then find or build tools to identify marathon sessions, speed-surfing,
repeated access patterns, and other obvious robot-like behavior or
cheating. Keep an eye on the top performers (total points) and the
fastest climbers (points earned in the last 24 hours).

Never underestimate the value of direct contact. If something looks
suspicious, contact the user -- in my experience, most cheaters will
cave in immediately when caught, and describe how they rigged your
system if you promise to fix it so that no one else can get away with
a similar hack.

It's not that rate-limiting and careful session handling are a waste
of time -- they aren't, and they are important for other reasons. They
just aren't particularly effective at preventing the kind of abuse you
are concerned about.

It is only an issue if you are trying to use the GPL and also have
non-GPL releases. If you are buying totally into the GPL, then by all
means go whole hog.

However, if you are trying to have a dual-licensed release, using the
GPL means you can pretty much forget about including any external GPL
libraries. That is where we are with both Mambo and Joomla! at
present, and isn't really all that bad.

Well, other than the fact that the first major commercial product from
JamboWorks is now going to be released under the GPL.

If you're using GPL version 2 licensed software and you're happy 
with it, you have nothing to worry. GPL version 3 cannot change how 
old software has been licensed. If you comply with the GPL version 2 
now, you'll automaticaly comply with the GPL version 2 in the future 
too.

What could change, is that you cannot upgrade your GPL software if 
the latest release is distributed under *different* licence (e.g. 
GPL version 3 instead of GPL version 2). You need to review the 
license of any piece of software every time the license changes 
anyway, so this is nothing new.

It would be worth to mention that most software licensed under GPL 
version 2 have clause in their license that says:
"This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or 
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as 
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the 
License, or (at your option) any later version."

Note that it's up to the *end user* to decide which license he wants 
to accept. If version 3 allows something that version 2 didn't 
allow, then he clearly wants to select version 3. If version 2 suits 
you better, select that. Obviously, you cannot mix clauses from 
version 2 and version 3.

Listies,

I will need to use a PHP/Java bridge soon and am looking for stories of
horror and delight. Anyone have any experiences?

I've heard some differing reports: it seems that there is some confusion
regarding the version of PHP required. I've heard that you *must* have 5,
and elsewhere it seems people are using 4.3.x with no problems.

The PHP/Java bridge lives at:
http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/


And a mention that it works with PHP 4.3.2:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.java.php#53184


Thanks all!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Bug in PHundamentals function?
Message-ID: <43419B00.8030107@email.smith.edu>

I've been thinking of implementing the PHundamentals function for fixing 
magic quotes when on a shared server:
(http://www.nyphp.org/phundamentals/storingretrieving.php)

The line in question:
return $sybase ? str_replace ('\'\'', '\'', $var) : stripslashes ($var);

I broke the str_replace and stripslashes out into separate code to test 
and make sure I understand what was going on.

When testing, the str_replace wasn't working as is with the search and 
replace string surrounded by single quotes.  After checking the php 
manual , I changed the search and replace text to be surrounded by 
double quotes and it worked correctly.

Should the PHundamentals function be changed to have double quotes? 

Here's the code I used to test:

    // test sybase str_replace with single quotes - doesn't appear to 
produce desired result
    echo '<br /><br />';
    $sb_string = "I\'\'m heading out on the road";
    $sb_string_new = str_replace('\'\'', '\'', $sb_string);
    echo 'Sybase string is ' . $sb_string . '<br />';
    echo 'String replace produces ' . $sb_string_new . '<br />';
   
    // test sybase str_replace with double quotes - appears to produce 
desired result
    echo '<br />';
    $sb_string_new = str_replace("\'\'", "\'", $sb_string);
    echo 'Sybase string is ' . $sb_string . '<br />';
    echo 'String replace produces ' . $sb_string_new . '<br />';

And the output:
Sybase string is I\'\'m heading out on the road
String replace produces I\'\'m heading out on the road

Sybase string is I\'\'m heading out on the road
String replace produces I\'m heading out on the road

Thoughts?

Aaron,

As it happens I wrote the line in question, so I'll try and explain 
what's going on ;)

I think that you're confused about the effect of the magic_quotes_sybase 
php.ini directive.

Say you had the string:

I'm heading out on the road

With magic_quotes_gpc=On and magic_quotes_sybase=Off, the string coming 
in would look like:

I\'m heading out on the road

With magic_quotes_gpc and magic_quotes_sybase both On, the string coming 
in would look like:

I''m heading out on the road

So, in php/english the idea of that line is:

if (magic_quotes_sybase = On) {
   // replace '' with '
   return str_replace ('\'\'', '\'', $var)
} else {
   // use regular stripslashes
   return stripslashes ($var)
}

You could also write the line as:

return $sybase ? str_replace ("''", "'", $var) : stripslashes ($var);

to have the same effect, but I tend to prefer using single-quoted 
strings unless I'm actually embedding \n line breaks or variables, so I 
went with the single-quotes-and-slashes encoding.

Stephen,

I am currently the data-migration lead on a massive project covering just over 5,000 tables. I found the most effective tools to be Access, for getting a handle and feel on the data..
Visio, for setting up the normalized state of the 'new' DBs... Great DDL export features and options.
Query Analyzer, for actually scrubbing and working with the 'to-be moved' data.  

I'm fortunate enough to have an employer who provides me with this tools, however I have heard some really good things about DDT which can be found here amongst others:

Gotcha.  I was thrown off by misinterpreting the search and replace strings.

Thanks, that's very helpful!

You don't have to escape single quotes when you enclose the string with 
double quotes. I wrote a bit more on quoting strings here:

Dan Cech wrote:

I prefer this approach when it helps me avoid escaping. In this case, I 
think both look confusing, but the escaping makes it worse.

Nice page...

Myself a others are currently engaged in a large financial project and we've
been using Enterprise Architect.  Quite nice, with remote repository
management (via MySQL), project sharing, including straight forward
interface and UML.  We're using all facets of it, from business processes,
to state diagrams, to database reverse engineering from AS400/RPG.  Fun
stuff!

Right, I know that.  In this case I was attempting to recreate a string 
that would represent, say, a POST['var'] on a server that had 
magic_quotes_gpc turned on.   So I wanted the escape slash to be a part 
of the string so I could then test stripslashes on it.

It string var was actually supposed to be:
$sb_string = "I\'m heading out on the road";

Then:
$sb_string_new = stripslashes($sb_string);
// escape slash should be removed

Yes, the double-quoted syntax is probably easier to understand in this 
case.  Honestly I never thought about it because single-quoted is what I 
usually use.

That said there may also be a (very slight) performance advantage to 
using the single-quoted version, given the fact that it's executed for 
every member (recursively) of every array affected by magic_quotes_gpc, 
for every page load.

What interest me here is the writer's understanding that when I'm 
programming an actual application it's in my best interest to 
de-normalize the data model, aiming for fewer tables than my data model 
would have indicated.  I'm assuming this person has good reason for what 
he's saying, but it's something I've never thought of or heard before?

Can anyone suggest reasons why it's better to have fewer tables, or to 
try and combine different types of objects into the same table?  Surely 
it's something to do with better performance (fewer joins, simpler 
queries), right?  Is this a common principle of design that I haven't 
learned yet?

The rule I used in the development of a framework was (1) model the real
world first, and (2) de-normalize only when it is obviously necessary for
performance reasons.  I can't say that I ever read that anywhere, but I am
sure it is not original.

The framework was the foundation for large, complex applications with high
transaction volumes.  Performance was appropriate and de-normalization was
rare.

An ER tool I have heard good things about but have not played with  
much is  SQL 4X Manager J 3. If you got the time, check it out and

Big tables (may) have big full table scans while multiple small tables (may) impact IO.

There is an impact with regard to full table scans depending on how many blocks your max row takes up. Of course, this will depend on how the columns are defined. Its easy to imagine a table with three column of BLOBS taking longer to scan then a table with 20 columns of single bytes.

There is also some simple math to estimate the impact of splitting the table out into multiple tables. You'll have 1+x primary keys (K) to maintain instead of just one. The height of your index (H) will also have an impact on IO. So, for every row retrieved, you can compare your baseline IO for a single table to K(H+1). Of course, this assumes that you are making this join frequently.

So, if you know that to actually describe the entity you will always need x attributes, and you split these x attributes into n tables where n > 1, you will likely suffer an unnecessary performance penalty. However, if to typically describe an entity you just need a subset of x (for example, employee contact info) and there is another subset y that is rarely accessed and would make for a large table scan (employee image), I might consider splitting them up.

This is an interesting topic because I'm approaching a question based 
upon this principal.  There is an application that I am building where 
the User record can have 5 addresses (home address, work address, 
permanent address, international address, etc, etc).  I'm considering 
making a table called UserAddress and then linking it to address ID 
fields in the User table.  I'm on the fence about it because while I 
don't want a monstrous User table with tons of columns, I also don't 
want to over normalize.

Thanks,

Stephen

It just dawned on me, that I need to chime in here in a more thoughtful 
way.  Like Hans said, we are using Enterprise Architect, the short 
coming is that it does not run natively on OS X.  You will need virtual 
PC with Windows running on your OS X machine.  This will incur a 
performance hit.  I am currently using EA on OSX through Virtual PC with 
Windows XP Home.  It is not a terrible situation.  We standardized on EA 
even though a part of the team is on OS X becuase it is a very useful 
piece of software and the benefit of EA out weighs the cost of Virtual 
PC.  Just to be clear I have a 12" Power Book G4 1.33 with 1.2 GB of RAM.

Here's a great working example to explore the issue.  I would let the 
User table contain no address info, and then let the UserAddress table 
contain one address per row with an extra column for UserID.  This seems 
like a clear one-to-many relationship between a person and his/her many 
addresses (also assuming it could be any number between 0 and 5, 
right?), so adding 5 sets of columns to the User table doesn't seem 
right...  

Honestly, the only reason I'm writing here is so someone can correct me 
if I'm wrong (and if I'm right then this might actually helping somebody 
-- neat-o ...).

I was going to say the same thing, although you would probably want the 
address table to contain the user id, address type and address columns.

It seems to make sense from pretty much every angle, and of course will 
work for any number of different addresses.  If you're interested in 
doing any queries that would match against more than 1 address then this 
will also be much easier, like:

SELECT user_id FROM addresses WHERE address_type IN (1,2,3) AND 
country='USA'

If you do go this way there is definitely no need to have any address 
columns in the user table, which is also a boon for any query where 
you're not pulling address information (which in my (limited) experience 
tends to be most of them).

Another consideration is how you are using the addresses and the  
users. For example if you are going to be joining users with other  
tables then trying to determine which of those users also  have an  
address in  NY the queries can beat on your server. How many users  
will you have? What with the addresses be used for? Will you need to  
search all addresses for each user related to other tables?

 From a data point of view you would normalize it all and I would  
suggest a states and countries table to be linked to addresses as a  
well as address type. But when you are trying to come up with all the  
users with a address in NY who are related to other tables, i.e.  
groups, you may wish you have it all in one table.

If you get really "normal" you could have a "user_addresses" table  
which would contain the address_type field so if you have 2 users at  
the same address the address would only be in the address table once  
but related to both users. :)

Don't get me started if you need to track history. "Where did user X  
live at home 2 years ago?". Then you have a start_date and end_date  
in the user_addresses.

I have done it both ways and there really is not a clear winner,  
depends on the situation. I am glad I am not tracking user address  
history any more,

Good luck

I'm actually running into the point of an application where my completely
normalized database design is just killing my database server. It was fine
during the first few months of my site being up but as my traffic grew, it
really began to take a toll. The first thing I had to do was move from
MyISAM to InnoDB, due to the huge number of locks causing the site to just
screech to a halt. On average I am getting around 5000 hits per minute to
the PHP pages that connect to the database. During the "slow" time at 7am, I
get around 2500. I've managed to lower my average queries per second from
300 to 220, but normalization is still killing me.

This makes doing any sort of database maintenance fairly difficult. InnoDB
has helped a lot, I have a dedicated DB server, but one query that has to
copy to a temp table on each page view means almost certain death. My
temporary solution to this has been to create "digest" tables which are more
or less 5-10 table joins that get refreshed every X minutes via cron. This
obviously causes caching problems as data isn't up to the second, and it
seems like a pain to write code around using this "hack" to make my
application work as it should.

I've considered using InnoDB's cascading update/delete function to keep my
digest tables up to date without a cron job, but I want to play with it more
before I just launch into it. I am starting to wonder how much of this is
just my lack of expertise in database administration and how much is just a
fundamental flaw with normalized database design. Is it possible to have a
large scale production database with a fully normalized design without
extremely expensive hardware?

It seems like it would be worth the extra overhead to keep behind-the-scenes
digest tables of commonly joined tables, is this something that higher end
databases (ie. oracle) do?

In my opinion, you are exactly correct.  We went down this road with our
Zephyr System and specifically its Industry-neutral Core
(http://www.eleccott.com/indneutl.htm ).  We also established an Address
Type table and coded each address by type, e.g., Legal Address, Billing
Address, Remittance Address.  One of the attributes of the Address Type
table was a Single-Address-of-Type flag such that only one Legal Address
could be entered, but multiple Vacation Addresses could be entered.

I also believe that creating a database with a specified number of 5 or any
other number of addresses brings unnecessary rigidity, and perhaps
complexity, to a system.

BTW, in the world of business objects, even the concept of a User needs to
be rethought.  I would do away with Users as a fundamental business object
and replace it with the more generic Person, and identify system Users as a
subset of the Person universe.  Users then become Persons who play the Role,
System User, in which additional sets of information are required such as
username, password, permissions, et cetera.

We found FIPS Pub 55-3 ( http://www.census.gov/geo/www/fips/fips.html ) to
be helpful for creating the geographical sub-division structure within a
country and FIPS 10-4 (http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/fips10-4.html ) to
be useful for country coding and the first level of country sub-division.
The latter introduces the issues of multiple sub-division types within a
country (US has states and a district, Canada has provinces and territories,
and Argentina has districts, national territories and provinces).  FIPS 10-4
also reveals the native names for these sub-divisions, e.g., distrito,
territorio nacional and provincia for Argentina and velayats for
Afghanistan.

You may have an issue with postal codes since these vary by country.  We
addressed that by establishing different format masks such that multiple
countries could share the same postal code mask for editing.  Canada, UK and
the US all used different postal code masks, which were attributes of the
country table.

Absolutely.  When the oldest daughter in a 12-child family moves out, only
her association with the address is changed.  This can be a real issue in
medical information systems in which the caregivers are responsible for
multiple family members.

It's not so much the higher-end databases do it, but that they can do it,
whereas I'm not sure mySQL can.

One method is to use triggers to update the digest tables when detail
tables are updated.

Another method is to use "materialized views", where you create a view
that is kept updated by the system.  In method 1 you do the work, in
method 2 the system does the work.

barring these, you would update the digest tables yourself whenever the
detail tables are updated.

One danger of course is that you introduce contention on the writes if
everybody is trying to hit the digest tables.  If you mave many more reads
than writes this may not be an issue.

DB2 uses a technology called Materialized Query Tables (MQTs) that are 
intended for this type of work.  They were introduced in version 8 but 
were known in a limited form as summary tables (ASTs) in version 7.

As described above, there are two ways to keep these "perma-views" in 
synch with the base tables, either user refreshed or system refreshed:

Since the Zend Core for IBM is based on PHP/DB2, these might be available 
to play around with.

Greetings,

I have a manual process that I would like to make happen automatically 
(on a scheduled basis).

The process:
1)  In MS Access on a local computer, run a query on a table, then 
export the query as a text file.
2)  From same local computer, append the text file data to a MySQL table 
on my web server.

I would appreciate any tips or suggestions on how to make this happen. 

Thanks,

Rather than take the Virtual PC performance hit, you should probably
run a copy on a spare Windows box somewhere and use Remote Desktop to
bring it up on your Mac.

I assume you mean export the data resulting from the query.

I haven't done much windows for a while and don't know the counterpart of
cron, but there must be one. But that's the last step.

You should be able to create an ODBC data source, then access it
programmatically -- e.g., with the PHP ODBC API
(http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.uodbc.php)

With your data in hand, it seems you can either

(1) connect to your hosts MySQL database directly across the network from
your machine and run the insert queries, or, if they don't let you do
that,

(2) do your own export-as-text (e.g., to tab-delimited), then upload it
via POST (cURL might be helpful) to another PHP script on your server that
accepts the upload and knows what to do with it -- break it back down and
run the queries with it. You will no doubt want to add user authentication
to the mix and possibly SSL.

There's probably a simpler/better solution about to be posted any second.

I second the opinion that the simplest is to interconnect both databases
with php.

Another solution I had to implement once was to have an asp dump an XML,
using scheduled tasks on Win2K, to a certain network folder, and have a php
get it using getElementByID and dump it to MySQL.
It worked fine, though I had to get someone to do me the asp, hehe.

I stayed out of this but am glad Dan added his comments. The developer 
needs to develop code for the app, and in this case the app is no longer 
trying to query the database as was designed -- it's querying summary 
tables as it is now required to do.

Who made that decision? based on data models? Database design? App 
design? All of the above.

Once the *already designed* app (with *already designed* database) was 
analyzed, the system imposed requirements BASED ON THOSE DESIGNS. There 
is more than one way to achieve normalization, but it was irrelevant if 
the database had to be redesigned for performance for this application. 
This recursive design process is at the heart of successful development 
IMHO.

I guess I am just underlining that the initial question of modeling data 
vs. modeling system or application requirements does not always 
encompass database design. In my experience, one must always consider 
the platform and the application from the start, and almost always 
re-design the database around platform factors known later. Yeah, lots 
of "extra work".

One plus for agile software development http://agilemanifesto.org/ and 
an underline of the value of "ben there, done that".

Normalization can have a huge impact on your apps -- it can reduce many
data entry errors and eliminate others entirely.  That is its purpose. 
Without normalization all of the time you spend supporting a slow app will
be spent fixing errors in bad data.

But querying data is a different thing.  If you have known common queries
that aggregate and join data, then by all means create some summary system
that is, hopefully, automatic and guaranteed to be right.  This is not
really denormalization, though the relational theorist will argue it is. 
What it is in fact is the creation of derived tables based on normalized
tables.

But anyway, normalize the tables users can directly modify, and use
summaries derived from those normalized tables.  Then you get accurate
data coming in and that makes for accurate summaries.

Have a look at:
'The Dangerous Illusion: Denormalization, Performance and Integrity'

http://dmreview.com/article_sub.cfm?articleId=5251

Read the part that starts off with: "a fully normalized relational 
database consists of R-tables. Each represents just one entity type..."

It strikes me that normalization of data follows a strict path --
first normal, second normal, and so on.

That is, there is not such a thing as  "more than one
'right way' " to normalize data -- not even with Perl packages.

"... conceptual modeling is inherently an informal endeavor, logical 
modeling?which is where normalization applies?is based on formal theory. 
Otherwise put, while business modeling is all art, logical database 
design is, at least in part, science. And the theory is there not for 
its own sake, but to guarantee consistency and avoid the practical 
problems...

Excellent point Kenneth,

This is the very thing Craig S. Mullins envisions in his "Death of 
Denormalization" articles. [1][2]   "With MQTs, you can achieve the best 
of both worlds: fully normalized tables to ensure data integrity during 
modification and MQTs for efficient querying." [2]   In essense, you don't 
have to change your data model just your hardware or software.

But Fabian Pascal says the solution isn't that denormalization will be 
rendered obsolete by faster physical resources, it's rethinking those 
software systems in the first place to support true high-form 
normalization that should eliminate performance issues.   "Hardware, 
product and optimization improvements are, of, course, always desirable 
and welcome, but they are only add-ons, not substitutes for the real and 
fundamental solution: well implemented TRDBMSs, whose performance is not 
hindered, but actually enhanced with fully normalized databases." [3].

Interesting reading, and nice affirmations to normalize. :)

This is one of the main reasons I look for support for Stored
Procedures and Triggers. With those two available, versioning can be
automated and absolutely zero hassle to the programmer.

For example, you could add begin_date and end_date in the user_address
table, and then create a trigger that fired on INSERT statements that
setup the proper values for each (as well as an UPDATE trigger that
also updates the values). You could also add address_status instead,
if you wanted to track without dates if that direction suits your
purposes better.

In the end, you can put that work in the database, where IMHO it belongs.

Without knowing your datamodel, I cannot really tell you much. My
experience tells me that the more you normalize, the less you will
encounter the locks that MySQL ISAM tables are prone to.
Denormalization will make your problems worse for sure.

See below for my comments, but I have personally worked on sites using
both MySQL and PostgreSQL that had daily page views well into the
millions. The PostgreSQL sites usually have no problems, and the one
really huge MySQL site had major ones - but remember that this was
almost ten years ago when MySQL was just a little punk ;-)

I would wager that moving to a more recent version of MySQL would
alleviate some of your pain, but I have no idea what version you are
using at the moment.

I worked on a site with over 7.5 million page views daily, and ran on
two dual-xeon servers with PHP and PostgreSQL. The MySQL version of
the app had the exact same problems you had, and I also had to switch
to InnoDB tables to keep indexes from getting blown away on very
active tables. Interestingly enough, PostgreSQL handled the normalized
design without a burp. The switcheroo also included the implementation
of a lot more functionality, like foreign keys, stored procedures and
triggers. I expected a wash in performance, but it was just a tad
faster under heavy load.

I know of a financial application that was using SQL Server, and when
you get to like 20 joins or whatever the query just fails. A quick
port to PostgreSQL and all those joins run just fine.

I spend most of my time in PostgreSQL - but I can say that if you have
a sophisticated data model with a lot of foreign constraints,
PostgreSQL's MVCC model takes care of a lot of the pain that other
databases often experience when doing lots of JOIN operations.

Time to take a look at the impending MySQL 5.0 (it *is* going stable
sometime right? hehe) as I am not really up to speed with what MySQL
has to offer with the latest versions.

But in the end you can definitely run high-traffic, data-intensive
websites with open source databases, and I would only consider a big
commercial RDBMS if you hired someone with that particular skillset;
and even then it would be more of a business decision than a technical
one.

His point is subcategory of the entire concept of automation and how it is

What's not working?  Does ./configure break?  Does the compile fail?  You
need to tell us where it breaks, and what the pertinent error message is.

I agree. I also go one step more extreme, and have an address_type table that
has the address_type_id and the char user-friendly 'address type'. This way
(for the benefit of people that haven't done this type of thing before) you
simply add another row to the address_tpe table to add another type of address,
and to use in your contraints. If you're not using DB enforced constraints (ie
foreign keys), be careful to not delete an address type from the table and
leave orphaned records in the address table.

I just read about normalizing to 3NF and as an example, the book showed how 
in an extreme case of obsessive 3NF compliance city and state address fields 
could really be separate tables since city depends on state, state depends 
on country, etc. A bit extreme to me, but food for thought.

Regarding another point previously made in this thread: MySQL versus 
Postgres. MySQL seems to have all the momentum, yet a previous poster gave 
the impression that Postgres is more advanced. Should we be looking at 
Postgres more seriously despite the MySQL onslaught? Why does it seem like 
PHP/MySQL has become one word -- like Wintel -- instead of PHP/Postgres?

I suspect there are two issues here: (1) storage of codes for address fields
and (2) the overall design requirements of the system.

Typically codes are stored and are in general use outside of systems for
states, e.g., NY for New York and PA for Pennsylvania.  So the question
comes down to the use of codes for further political sub-divisions
(particularly municipalities in the US where counties do not appear in the
typical address).  So it would seem to be obsessive to store the
municipality as a code as opposed to the string, because that would double
the number of disk accesses (one for all the other elements of the address
and one for the municipal code lookup).

The second issue is concerned with the requirements of the system.  I would
make a distinction between 'application' requirements and 'system'
requirements, but I would acknowledge that others could make the case they
are the same.  To me an application tends to be a broad set of functions
accessing a database that address a specified need, such as an airline's
reservation application or an inventory control application.  The
immediately perceived needs define the application.  The system, on the
other hand, tends to be something quite different, what evolves over time,
particularly when the initial application has been successful.

The challenge of the system designer is to discern the future direction of
the system and make no mistakes in the design that would be prohibitive to
reverse.  Application programs are typically not nearly as disastrous as
databases in this regard.

All things being equal, it is probably better to err on the side of
obsession when designing a database.  For example, one approach might be to
use municipal tables to assure that the municipality is a valid entity, but
then store the string.  In that way the database design is normalized at the
foundation level, but has a thin veneer of de-normalization over the top for
operational efficiency.

At least that seems to have worked for me.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] fun with proc_open
Message-ID: <43444122.5000108@phpwerx.net>

Hi all,

Firstly, apologies for the long email, I couldn't think of a less 
verbose way to describe the issues I'm experiencing.

I'm in the midst of writing a little program for executing long-running 
processes in the background from php and monitoring their output as they 
run.

The problem I'm running into is that when I execute a process using 
proc_open and try to read any output from stdout and stderr I am running 
into some odd behavior.

This only seems to happen under windows, running the same script on my 
debian server works as expected.

The first read from stdout is fine, but then it doesn't get any more 
output from stdout until the end of the script.

Is there some issue with using stdout and stderr together in this way 
that I don't know about?

My test code looks like this:

<?php

// allow script to run for 5 minutes
set_time_limit(300);

// maximum length of blocks to read from process
define('FREAD_LENGTH',1024*10);

$cmd = 'php '.dirname(__FILE__).DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'sleep.php';

$descriptorspec = array(
   1 => array('pipe','w'), // stdout
   2 => array('pipe','w'), // stderr
);

$process = proc_open($cmd,$descriptorspec,$pipes);

if (!is_resource($process)) {
   echo 'failed'."\n";
   exit(1);
}

// don't block process stdout or stderr
stream_set_blocking($pipes[1],0);
stream_set_blocking($pipes[2],0);

// don't buffer stdout or stderr
stream_set_write_buffer($pipes[1],0);
stream_set_write_buffer($pipes[2],0);

while (true) {
   // read process stdout
   $stdout = fread($pipes[1],FREAD_LENGTH);
   if (strlen($stdout) > 0) {
     echo 'stdout:'. $stdout;
     flush();
   }

   // read process stderr
   $stderr = fread($pipes[2],FREAD_LENGTH);
   if (strlen($stderr) > 0) {
     echo 'stderr:'. $stderr;
     flush();
   }

   // end when both pipes are closed
   if (feof($pipes[1]) && feof($pipes[2])) {
     break;
   }

   // wait for more output
   sleep(1);
}

// close process stdout and stderr
fclose($pipes[1]);
fclose($pipes[2]);

// grab exit code
$exitcode = proc_close($process);

echo 'exitcode:'. $exitcode ."\n";

// end of script

sleep.php is a simple script that outputs some data:

<?php

ob_implicit_flush();

echo('started'."\n");

for ($i = 1;$i <= 10;$i++) {
	sleep(1);
	echo($i."\n");
}

fwrite(STDERR,'done'."\n");

// end of script

Running the first script from command line or web browser should output:

stdout:started
stdout:1
stdout:2
stdout:3
stdout:4
stdout:5
stdout:6
stdout:7
stdout:8
stdout:9
stdout:10
stderr:done
exitcode:0

On windows I'm seeing:

stdout:started
stderr:done
stdout:1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
exitcode:0

I've managed to get the same functionality using popen and redirecting 
stderr to a fifo or tempfile, but proc_open seems like the cleaner 
solution if I can get it to work the way I want.

Any ideas?

Dan

In a nutshell, PostgreSQL started out with one primary goal, SQL
compliance (and that means features). MySQL however started out with
only three goals - speed, speed, and more speed.

While PostgreSQL found that so many features required a tremendous
amount of refactoring and tuning to get performance and stability up
to a reasonable level, MySQL was under constant pressure to add
features that every other database had. (I remember joking, and not
that long ago, that the only database that has as few features as
MySQL was Access, and at the time Access had more features LOL)

So PostgreSQL started out really fat, with a ton of features, and had
major speed and stability issues. We are talking *major* speed and
stability issues. And MySQL started out really fast, unbelievably
fast, but had almost no capabilities, and no way to ensure clean,
consistent data - like spreadsheets for linux webservers.

Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum!

I think that they are now basically meeting in the middle, with
PostgreSQL is just as fast as any other database out there, and I have
seen PostgreSQL perform better than most for very sophisticated
designs; and MySQL has lost all of that legendary speed in order to
implement features that keep it competitive with other database
offerings.

My philosophical choice of PostgreSQL over MySQL has really only one
important point:

1) They are meeting in the middle, but PostgreSQL has had most of this
functionality for *years*. Maybe MySQL is finally getting around to
adding the stuff I require, but PostgreSQL has had it for a loooong
time, and it is absolutely bazooka proof at this point.

It's there, it's free (BSD license), why the heck not? ;-)

Perhaps most importantly, the decision for you (the web developer)
should really boil down to this one question: Where are you planning
on implementing the "business rules" of your application?

If you want to put logic in your database, you should look at
PostgreSQL, and if you want to put that logic in your code then MySQL
or PostgreSQL would most likely suffice. There are some very emotional
people out there on this topic (me included!) but perhaps this is more
of a personal preference than scientific conclusion. Would love to
hear other thoughts on this!

As for the popularity comparison...

MySQL has always had a better press relationship than PostgreSQL. Also
consider that MySQL was easy for folks to learn, because it really
could not do much more than store data anyway. With a commercial
entity behind MySQL, there was a budget for advertising, and
evangelism was a priority for them - whereas PostgreSQL has had many
supporters that had absolutely no interest in the market, and made no
effort to spread the word.

Another thing is that now as both PHP and MySQL gain complexity as
they mature, PostgreSQL will most likely not be perceived as such a
complex beast anymore.

For me, PostgreSQL is always the default, regardless of the
application, unless the client demands a commercial database.

Here is an interesting read, on what the databases do incorrectly or poorly:

Show me a "fully normalized" database supporting a web app, done close 
to schedule and budget. I double dog dare ya.

I do NOT recommend de-normalizing. Dan's commments were on summary table 
built and managed by the dbms... and the coder now had to code to those 
instead of the db tables. That's great, IMHO, because it guarantees 
interity to the degree that the dbms can maintain it (presumably better 
than the developer can). I do believe there are multiple ways to 
normalize, because you have to select a base data unit around which you 
build your app (and normalize your database). Some hard-core database 
guys fallback on semantics here -- they assume there is no data except 
what is specified in the data model. Sure.. in that case, full norm is 
the only option. But I don't think it's a realistic (nor particularly 
helpful) perspective.

For a real estate application, is the base unit of location state, city, 
market area, zip code, GIS coordinates, zone, or what? Practically GIS 
coordinates represent the fnest granularity available and are actually 
required for some mapping applications. But are placename databases 
available by GIS coordinates? No, and they wouldn't be to useful 
anyway.  Somebody will have to pick a basis and it will be based on 
real-world application requirements. Yes, they are thusly translated 
into RESTRICTIONS and theoretically will hinder scalability.When and if 
additional data elements are needed (perhaps increased granularity for 
location parameters in the zip code example) the system will be revealed 
to be not normal and will need to be fixed.  In the context of this 
discussion, data types were being examined as they relate to 
normalization in the database design.

In my view, you need to base that on experience, choosing data 
structures that permit the application to accomplish it's goals, while 
being normalized. You cannot have your cake and eat it, too. In other 
words, I prefer to keep the database theorists out of the kitchen.

There is more than one way to normalize, because there are multiple ways 
to define the data set. That's my point. In addressing the developers' 
needs, the database design seems to come later. But of course we need a 
solid database design to start; it has to be done first... hence the 
recursive puzzle.But should we start with full normalized form? We would 
never get development started.

I love database guys... as much as I love graphic designers. But I won't 
let either one tell me how to code ;-)

I don't know if you're only looking at OSS solutions, but you may want to
look at Copper [http://www.copperproject.com/index.php]. It's not that
expensive, but it does have some features (like task dependencies) that some
of the tools in your list are lacking.

I've also played quite a bit w/ phpCollab & NetOffice, both of which are
pretty good, but I decided in the end to purchase Copper.

Hope this helps ...

Or MySQL.  Excellent thumbnail summary of MySQL's and PostgreSQL's 
respective childhoods, BTW.

I'm the same: PostgreSQL is my default RDBMS and has been since 7.2.  We 
used it when we built Trafficmac and damned if that PG server hasn't 
been rebooted or PG restarted in... lemme check... yikes... 599 days! 
And because it's an adserver reporting aggregator/ad ops workflow tool 
for WSJ, Foxnews, CBSMW and Cars.com, we hammer hard it every day.

I was a big MySQL guy until I got hired into an Oracle shop (CCI) where 
I got spoiled on Oracle's unbelievably rich feature set... foreign keys, 
procs, triggers, dblinks, AQ.  Oracle isn't just a database hanging off 
an application; it's an operating system.  When I returned to consulting 
my philosophy for how to build data-driven sites had taken a quantum 
leap and MySQL couldn't oblige.

MySQL4 provided a couple of those features and MySQL5 offers even more. 
  That's great to see but it's going to be a while before it catches up 
to PG8's feature set.  Meanwhile, PG's got a lot on its TODO plate so I 
don't think it will be sleeping either:

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Loop next/previous offset boundaries in Arrays
Message-ID: <000a01c5ca6c$a2b7cb40$0ba8a8c0@cliff>

In a loop, a common function seems to be comparing a current array value
with the next or prior array value. Seems easy, except for the first and
last loops, which generate undefined offset errors. Is there a "clean"
way to get around this other than testing for the first or last loop
value, which generates a lot of extra code.

Cliff,

I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do, but you may find the 
following useful:

$myarray = array();
unset($prev);

foreach ($myarray as $curr) {
   if (isset($prev)) {
     // compare $prev and $curr
   }
   $prev = $curr;
}


$myarray = array();
unset($curr);

foreach ($myarray as $next) {
   if (isset($curr)) {
     // compare $curr and $next
   }
   $curr = $next;
}

These won't work properly if the arrays contain null values, though I'm 
sure someone on the list will have an idea on that one.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [OT] Apache htaccess auth
Message-ID: <43452C8E.5060900@cyberxdesigns.com>

I know this might be off topic a bit but I can't figure it out and I am 
confident NYPHP is the place for AMP answers.

I am developing an application that needs to receive http responses from 
a remote system.  Currently, the entire application lives behind 
.htaccess Auth.  Don't want the whole world to see it.  The problem is 
that to continue to develop/test I need to receive the responses from 
the remote system and the remote system won't change to do the auth.

So what I would like to do is continue to protect all the files in 
/webroot behind Auth except for one subdirectory, or I would like all 
users from www.foo.com to access all the file in /webroot/ and make 
everyone else authenticate.

I have been looking at the apache .htaccess stuff and haven't figured it 
out.  Please help.

Thanks,
Hans

Hans,

If all you need is access to one subdirectory, you can add an .htaccess 
file to that subdirectory with the following lines:

Allow from 'remote system ip'
Satisfy any

This will allow the remote system to access that subdirectory without 
auth, but still require auth for every other host, and for the rest of 
the site.

You may find these links helpful:

Then developers need to get off the minimalist caveman approach to

To quote csnyder.. "Preach it brother!"

On smaller application development, the web app guy is probably the data
guy too.  When things grow out of hand, edumacation is vital.

Realistic normalization has been proven effective throughout the ages.  
If a developer has a problem writing SQL queries, ask the DBA for data
diagrams and meta-data.  Heck, they "may" even help you. Views and
stored procedures can be really helpful here.

If the app is for summary reporting (vs transactions), then decide on
some standard element and time dimensions and build a 'warehouse' or
'data mart' style denormalized database.  Again, the DBA can be helpful.

Maybe, if the NYPHP gods are listening.. this would be a good talk
topic.  That is, unless a local database user group gets there first
<grin>.

Great thread, BTW.

Message-ID: <200510061208.38270.jellicle@gmail.com>


Does anyone have a function handy for converting numerals to the 
fully-alphabetic ordinal equivalent?

f(1) = "First"
f(2) = "Second"
f(3) = "Third"
f(24) = "Twenty-fourth"
etc.

It's easier to convert to the numeric ordinal (1st, 2nd, 3rd) but I prefer 
the all-alphabetic, especially if I don't have to write it myself.  :)

I know of two -- but they were conversions of existing databases,
which were already in pretty good shape. So maybe they don't count,
if you meant designed 'from scratch' for a web app.

To address the developers' needs, the (physical) design typically does 
come (later) after the logical model is created. But, I don't know of 
anyone who advocates less than 3rd normal for a logical database design
(to be used in a relational DBMS).

After a few iterations the physical design can (and often is) 
denormalized from the logical model.

You can get your development started after your first 'cut' of a
physical design -- not "We would never get started."

"... should we start with a full normalized form?"

Yes.

How about ahead of schedule?  That's how ours go.  The trick is to know
well the disparate nature of both web and data, and have a tool that gives
each its due and creates the proper interface between them.  Using heavily
Object-Oriented techniques will not get you there, and may hold you back.

Not sure what you mean here.

I've found it easier to use a handful of plain-English terms. So when
talking to customers I don't talk about "models", it's more like "What do
you want to keep track of?"  Then its questions like, "will one price go
for all products in the category, or do separate items get separate
prices?"  These questions lead directly to table design and table design
drives the rest of the process.

You choose data structures that accurately record what needs to be
recorded, the application is simply an interface to that data.

Dare I say that's why you are not delivering on time or budget? (ducking)

It is true that you must determine who is "master" of the app, is it all
about the code, or all about the data?  If it is all about getting the
record-keeping down accurately, then you must insist on a proper database
design, then the application fits over the table structure like latex. 
Those who are more coder than db dude don't like this idea and want to
shape the database to the code -- bad idea.

Let me ask about cost.  Is the recursive puzzle a problem because it is
expensive?  Does it yield the correct result?  Could it be that it would
not be a problem if it were cheaper?

The better question would be, if you find nothing there, why do you
continue to click? ;-)

As for the discussion, we all seem to agree the project needs multiple
experts and due diligence to db design etc. I don't find much to disagree
with in the comments, except the practicality of it all. 

I am usually one of the sticklers for solid normalization on projects.
HOWEVER, I find most of the work for me is in getting the application's
future defined enough to be able to discuss that, while collaborators
(dba's included) want to lock n load. 

Of course an architect would make all the difference... that is the missing
piece. How many projects have an IA role assigned early on? 

From what I have seen this has been a helpful discussion for everyone
struggling with normalizing a db that supports a developing app. Valuable
contribution.

A-ha!  Even more normalization.  This is the way I have done it my 
system, btw.  There are "staff" users ... err PEOPLE".. and 
"participants" which have their own tables and then the USER table 
handles data that is required for those people to use the application.

Breaking up People into separate tables makes me think of a problem I am
struggling with and that's probably all too common. A product has a
price, right -- simple. Maybe not. The price could be fixed. It might be
x dollars per pound or some other unit. Maybe the price is even
non-linear.

So it seems like each price model should be a separate object and thus a
separate table. Right? And if so, it seems like it would be impossible
to get all product info in one query efficiently. Do I query the product
table to see what price model that product uses and then perform a 2nd
query? Do I join everything and see what price model "pops up?"

THis is not as hard as it looks.  Just use units-of-measure.  We don't
think about it most of the time because it is simply "item", like "5
widgets".  But the UOM could be pounds, acres, whatever you want.

The trick is to use a series of exceptions, and a "resolution" view.

You start out with prices in the PRODUCT_CATEGORIES table.  You override
at the ITEMS table level.  Then you override at the SPECIALS table for
that item during a particular period in time.   Make up any other levels
that are appropriate.

The resolution uses the magic of NULLs and COALESCE to join the tables
together and pull out the price.

select coalesce(special.price,item.price,cat.price)
  from SPECIALS special
  JOIN ITEMS item
  JOIN CATEGORIES cat  blah blah blah

Yes, this combined with the idea of multiple tables below would allow 
you to put together almost any pricing structure you wanted.

Recurring products are a whole 'nother kettle of fish though.

Good idea, though shouldn't the SQL be something more like:

SELECT coalesce(special.price,item.price,cat.price)
FROM CATEGORIES cat
LEFT JOIN ITEMS item ON item.cat_id=cat.cat_id
LEFT JOIN SPECIALS special ON special.item_id=item.item_id
WHERE blah blah blah

Perhaps I have misunderstood this question, but to me a price is normally
not an entity but an attribute of an entity such as a product/service.  The
latter would have a table established, and the price might represent one
column in the table.

"Might" is the keyword for the price attribute, because pricing can get
quite complex.  In the simplest case, price would be applied to a constant
unit over the entire product/service table.  It gets a bit more complicated
when different pricing units apply against different products/services,
e.g., units for some products, pounds for others.  It then becomes necessary
to store the pricing unit as an attribute as well as the price.  Another
dimension of complexity is a pricing schedule, in which the price is
dependent upon the amount, for example, or upon the location of the buyer.
Then a reference to the price schedule might be stored in the
product/service table as well as information about the pricing unit.
Obviously the above does not exhaust pricing schemes, which are limited only
by the imagination of marketing people.

It seems to me that pricing schedules, as opposed to prices, would be
considered entities since they have their own attributes.

It would then depend upon the goal of the query which route was taken, but
for applying prices to products/services sold, the first table access would
be to the product/service table and the subsequent access to the specific
price schedule, and perhaps to the specific row in that schedule that
applies to the product/service sold.

Incidentally, be careful about the identification of the entity.  Are you
dealing with pure products, pure services or a hybrid (and does it really
matter)?  Software vendors, for example, sell licenses (theoretically a
service?) and support (a pure service).  Automobile dealers sell a physical
product, but also maintenance service.  Do you mix products and services in
the same table (generally my preference although I would distinguish the
product from the service) or create separate tables?  Typically the pricing
algorithms can cover both so there is a simplification reason for combining
them into one table.

HTH.

Coalesce is a great function and the solutions proposed are really

I think Phil hit the nail on the head with the statement, "which are

imagination that causes me angst -- ok, a bit. Its what curveball I'll
be hit with in six months that my architecture didn't anticipate.

I searched the web and was shocked not to find the answer to this.... 
so I bring it to "the list".

I am building content management tool, within which I want people to be 
able to search for content.  I want to use the same query string rules 
as Google does - specifically the quote to group words into a unified 
string.

For example:

"the color purple" movie soundtrack

"the color purple" would need to be an exact match, ignoring the spaces 
as OR characters.  The spaces outside the quotes would still be treated 
like an OR character.

I am using this code so far:

$search_string = $_REQUEST['search_string'];
$search_terms = array();
$search_terms = preg_split('/"/', $search_string, -1, 
PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);

And it results in:

Array ( [0] => the color purple [1] => movie soundtrack )

But I want it to result in:

Array ( [0] => the color purple [1] => movie [2] => soundtrack )

I feel like I'm a couple keystrokes away... any help is much 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Stephen

Stephen,

For this kind of a problem it may be simpler (and possibly more 
efficient considering the small size of the strings) to write a simple 
parser that goes through the string and builds up the query that way, 
detecting whether you are inside a quoted string or not and behaving 
appropriately as well as potentially processing AND OR NOT - (a,b,c), 
etc constructs.

It seems like this could be a very worthwhile project, and more than 
likely there is already something out there I'm not aware of to solve 
this common problem.

You might also want to try digging into the source of some of the more 
mature wiki or cms applications for inspiration.

When I need to do non-trivial tasks in a loop, I typically use a for loop,
rather than a foreach().  It often has some key advantages.  Granted,
there's an added step for associative arrays, but if I know that an array
needs some complex processing, I always try to use an numericly indexed
array.

Anyway, I do things like this, for example:

$ArrayCount = count($somearray);
for( $i = 0; $i < $ArrayCount; ++$i )
{
  if( $i === 0 )
    echo 'The first element';

  if( $i === ($ArrayCount-1) )
    echo 'The last element'
}

By using the numeric index, it makes determining where you are in the array
fast and straightforward.

Normalization is often one of the most misunderstood aspects of relational
databases.  Of course, it's what makes a relational database relational, and
we're all taught that you're not worth a cent unless you only work in the
5th normalized form.

Well, perhaps if you're a mathematician, then that's correct.  The reality
is that over-normalization can kill a project just as much as
under-normalization.  Don't forget - at least from the old SQL books I
learned from - why normalization was being preached.  "Don't have duplicate
data!" was often the mantra.  If you had more than one guy named "John",
then you need to have a table of first names, with a lookup table relating
first names with the other data you're storing.  Seems rediculous, right?

The practice of heavy normalization was based on some old, bygone, concerns,
namely "storage is expensive."  Add in academic chest-beating, and pretty
soon you have a table for every letter of the alphabet and look-up tables to
match.

As I think we generally find, with the abundance of hardware resources,
normalization is reduced to only an element of good design.  Sure,
performance can still be a factor, but let's consider the performance of an
entire system, and not just what's happening in the database.

Not considering the overhead involved in joining tables (and thus resolving
disparate blocks across the drive(s)), there's overhead in the application,
and in a big way.  First is the performance of dealing with duplicate rows -
you know, the throwing out of wasted rows from a one-many relationships.
That not only incurs network traffic - which is often the slowest part of a
modern internet system - it also incurs processing and memory waste on the
application server.

And what about the overhead of development itself?  Large complex queries,
sub-queries, joins, and SQL query management in any language can make for
unmaintable and tedious code.

So it's a balancing act - as always.  The degree of normalization is
generally more of an art than a science, and the "correct" amount is
different for every project, and for every database architect.  Get three
database architects, and you'll get four recommendations for the correct
schema.

That is too bad.  I stop being a php programmer about 5 month ago and
I am back doing C programming but I miss working with PHP.  AT $900 I
do not think I will be going to this conference.  You guys have fun in
sunny southern cal.

Since it works under Linux, it's probably a subtle difference in the
buffering behavior on Windows.  Changing the fread() calls to fgets() seems
to work, but unfortunately I can't say what's different on Windows that
makes this a factor.  It's likely blocking/buffering behavior.

Yea. I forgot about the NYPHP discount. This will be a very
interesting PHP conference, as there are lots of people talking on
more than the usual set of topics.

I haven't worked with this in a long time, so I'd be interested to hear your
experiences.  Just as an educated guess, I'd think that PHP 5 would be
better, considering the fundamental OO architecture changes.  While it may
work in PHP 4, you'll probably see more memory usage, which of course may or
may not be important, depending on your application.

Hi there:

I searched around, and did not find an answer.

In particular, I was looking at 
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#control-name

...and also just general Google searching.

So my question is this:

How long can the name of a form element be?  Is there a limit?

I have a script which is a few layers deep into auto-generating forms 
based on information in a CSS file, and it's inserting some arcane 
codes in that are adding up to make really long form elements.

Nothing's breaking, but I'm concerned that there might be a problem 
in the future, since it could conceivably construct some pretty long 
form field names.

Cheers,

Marc

It would seem that you should be able to count the
most common degrees of normalization on one hand...
( very few people take things past 5th normal)

Normalization is basically simplifying, if you are
to believe E.F. Codd:

"For this reason (and others to be cited below) the possibility of 
eliminating nonsimple domains appears worth investigating. [see note 4] 
There is, in fact, a very simple elimination procedure, which we shall 
call normalization."

http://www.acm.org/classics/nov95/s1p4.html

There may be a number of ways to simplify a certain schema, and
there may be many opinions about what constitutes a 'good' schema --
but normalization itself is pretty much 'cut and dried'.

Further, if you define the degree of normalization needed as that
degree which will protect the data from (unexpected) anomalies, the
degree of normalization needed is not a matter of opinion either.

A useful guide for the steps involved in normalizing data can be
found at:

I can't say I've run into a limit, nor do I know of one on the _name_ of
a form element.   But there are limits to the length of URLs.  I believe
the documented limit is 1024 chars, but most browsers will do much more.
Anyway, my point is if you have lots of long form element names in one
form, don't use a GET for sure!  Use a POST.

HTH,

<snip>

Hans,

While I agree with your general message, I have a reservation about the
"storage is expensive" specific example.  Having been around since before
Boole and Babbage, I can't even recall in the "old days" when developers
were slavish about "storage is expensive".  We sought opportunities to
reduce storage, when that was practical, but only in very specialized
applications did we go out of our way to conserve disk storage.  The primary
issue was data consistency and software maintainability.  Lack of
normalization created situations which encouraged users to create
inconsistent data.  For example, consider a pre-relational system in
healthcare that recognized two 'pseudo-entities', physicians and patients
(pseudo in the sense we now recognize these as roles as opposed to
fundamental entities).  Each pseudo-entity had its own basic record to
contain address, telephone number and other attributes.  That worked as long
as the physician never became a patient.  However, a change to a
physician/patient's record created an inconsistency in the changed
attribute, e.g., the address.

The second issue was software maintenance.  There were situations where one
record's structure might be modified while the other was not.

I believe it was a natural progression from normalization of databases to
object-oriented design, because the latter encouraged all interactions with
the database to be performed in a single module.  I know of at least one
situation in healthcare where that limitation in the existing systems nearly
killed a patient.

But your principle point is that database design (and object design by
extension in my opinion) is still an art form.  Both database and object
design should look upon the 'rules' as significant guidelines.  Understand
when to bypass these rules, and document those reasons (conditions may
change in the future and others will probably have to clean up the
situation).

I liked your example of normalizing the string 'John', which underlines the
absurdity of over-normalization.  For me, appropriate normalization begins
with the recognition of the fundamental entities in a system and a
distinction between real world-modeled entities (e.g., a Person) as opposed
to system-internal entities (e.g., a web page).  If I come to a branch in
the road at which normalization or de-normalization both offer advantages, I
am most likely to take the normalization branch, make a mental note and if I
later discover that creates a significant performance issue that can't be
otherwise corrected, I would de-normalize that area of the system
intentionally (documenting my reasons and the implementation).

It would be interesting to see if others have approached normalization
guidelines differently.  I won't claim the above is the only way to do
database design - it is still an art form after all.

Phil

Good points, and I think you raise an important issue, namely, normalization
as a mechanism for separation and isolation.

Ah hah!  Separation and isolation.  There is always the consideration of
what perspective we're looking at, and at the end, who is saying
normalization.  I think the storage reasoning has come from - at least in my
experience when browsing academic SQL references - a largely idealistic way
of storing data.  Perhaps storage was or wasn't really expensive, but it was
neat to not store redundant data, as the first few normal-forms try to
address:

http://www.datamodel.org/NormalizationRules.html

That's from the data-structures-are-cool-and-I'm-not-an-implementer
department, which begins down the road of:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Sixth_normal_form
http://www.bkent.net/Doc/simple5.htm

and eventually to:

http://www.nerdbooks.com/item.php?id=1558608559

Not a bad thing, but not something I'd be ready to recommend to a customer
:)

>From a developer's perspective, however, the more important issue, as you
point out, is a good, clean, representation of data.  And, as hardware
resources become cheaper, that might mean that it's OK to have
redundant/repeating data, and still be correctly normalized and
architectured.

Exactly - it's a balance between what works in a sensible way, and how
you're supposed to do it.  As some of the links above mention, they're
discussing "relational database theory."  A lot of the work these guys do is
great, and the basis for much of the technology we have today.  But as
architects and implementers on the front-lines, it's our job to find that
happy place between the theory and practical, cost effective software.

I approach it in much the same way, however often take de-normalization if
all other things are equal.  Recognition of fundamental entities is really
the driver behind normalization in most environments I come across, and
without it, the total system, in terms of code/DB writing, style, and
maintainability, system performance, and future system changes by external
developers, is usually happier with a bit more data consolidation.

There seems to be enough interest in this thread, perhaps we should hash 
out a real-world example, using it to make points in the discussion?

My first suggestion would be a retail system for a shopping cart, with 
qty, prices, and taxes. I think that an open discussion of the proper 
database design, inlight of an eventual application, might be 
very....educational?

I would be happy to volunteer time to re-post some of the more technical

I googled for "rfc url length" and got RFC 2397 as an answer 
(http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2397.html). It says that HTML 2.0 has 
following limits:

maximum length of literal attribute value (for href of a or action 
of post or value of input type hidden) is 1024 bytes (LITLEN)

maximum combined length of all attribute values of a single tag is 
2100 bytes (ATTSPLEN)

maximum length for a single tag in source code is 2100 bytes (TAGLEN)

[as a side note, limit of 2100 bytes for a tag limits maximum 
combined attribute length to less than 2100 bytes in real life.]

**

Fortunately, no current user agent has such a low limits. HTML 4.01 
says (http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/conform.html#conformance):

"A user agent should avoid imposing arbitrary length limits on 
attribute value literals (see the section on capacities in the SGML 
Declaration). For introductory information on SGML attributes, 
please consult the section on attribute definitions."

HTML 4.01 SGML Declaration 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/sgmldecl.html#h-20.1) has 
following part:

   ATTCNT   60      -- increased --
   ATTSPLEN 65536   -- These are the largest values --
   LITLEN   65536   -- permitted in the declaration --
   NAMELEN  65536   -- Avoid fixed limits in actual --
   TAGLEN   65536

and the declaration includes a message that says
"These are the largest values permitted in the declaration. Avoid 
fixed limits in actual implementations of HTML UA's."

RFC 2616 doesn't set any limits for the lenght of URL.

As for the real world limits,

"Internet Explorer has a maximum uniform resource locator (URL) 
length of 2,083 characters [...] If you are using the GET method, 
you are limited to a maximum of 2,048 characters (minus the number 
of characters in the actual path, of course)." 
(http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;q208427).

John,

Good suggestion.  I'll be glad to redo my comments so they fit within a
format accepted by the group.  Perhaps one way to start something like this
would be to outline 'chapters' of the discussion, particularly if we would
be dealing with practical examples.  I think it is wise to limit the
examples to an application such as a shopping cart because the subject would
be immense otherwise.

I'll buy him a round of whatever he's drinking.

This has been one of the most interesting (read: exquisitely geeky) NYPHP
threads of 2005, imho.

Is there a way to set a timeout value for a system("ls -l") call?  If  
the ls command hangs for at least 5 secs I want to term the call and  
have some return value that indicates the process has termed.

Not that I've found. I've been using the $dirhandle=opendir('xx');
$filename=readdir($dirhandle); method of picking out files.

Did you try ' set_time_limit()' ?

oh I see that:

"Any time spent on activity that happens outside the execution of the 
script such as system calls using system(), stream operations, database 
queries, etc. is not included when determining the maximum time that the 
script has been running."

I'm more trying to know when that exact command fails rather than any  
output from the command itself.

I've never tried it with PHP but I used external process timers in C 
programs by setting a function on the SIG_ALRM signal.  The function 
would send a kill to the PID of the child process when alarm() timed out.

Try prefacing it with the "time" command:

But if the command hangs, the only thing that the time command will  
do is record how long the program is 'executing' or not for that  
matter.  I need to term the offensive command and return a code that  
this has happened.  The reason being I don't want to wait for the  
system to time out the command as it takes too long to time out.  I  
would know in a matter of seconds rather than the systems minutes  
whether the command is hung or not.

Gotcha.

One method might be to use the pcntl_* functions to fork a child, exec the "ls
-la" and wait for the child to exit using a non-blocking waitpid in a loop,
killing the proc if it takes to long or moving on to other business when it
returns.

Fork a child ?  pcntl function calls ??  what if you're running on a webserver,
you're going to fork a huge application just to do a "ls -l" ???

It's always good to have this knowledge on hand but ask yourself do I
really need a bazooka to kill a mouse?

supercool NYPHP discount, I just might make the plunge. Thanks for

Very good point. You should know what is really doing behind the scenes.

However, I *suspect* Jeffrey was not really finding that "ls -l" was
timing out, but rather something proprietary for which he substituted
something common for public conumption.  If it is really "ls" then,
there is more to the problem then he is stating.

I've never tested this for this type of use, but perhaps proc_open() or
popen() could help.  You'd get some streams, which you could then set
timeouts on for reading.  It might be a little tricky to code, and may not
even work, but could be worth a shot.

The real question, however, is why an ls is taking so long.  If the same ls
doesn't take long in the shell, then it's likely some other issue in the PHP
application.

The site is run by Harry Fuecks.  I don't know Harry personally, so I
can't tell you what he is up to now, but it may be a case of 'RL'.[1] 
I too would like to see it come back.

As luck would have it, at about the same time that phppatterns.com
went off-air, Sourceforge made changes to their system which killed
his (docuwiki) website for the popular JPSpan (AJAX) project[2]

I was at a meeting of NYPHPers a long time ago when some stuff was 
discussed that has since become part of "AJAX". I consider everyone at 
that dinner table to be a primo technologist, but some of them are truly 
outstanding programmers too :-)

When some clever new JS cross-server stuff was dissected in discussion, 
and it appeared that it was a "feature" made from what everybody 
recognized to be an XSS hole, some of the faces were really interesting. 
Kinda like "well, you really don't want to leave that open, but if it's 
open, yeah, I guess you could do that".

Since then we have AJAX everywhere. And now we have a hack that's being 
called a new "level 3" exploit. See http://e-scribe.com/news/103 and 
http://namb.la/popular/tech.html

I guess we all knew THAT would happen, right? ;-)

Hmm, you can chase the buzzword and call this an AJAX hack, but it is
really plain old cross-site scripting vulnerability. MySpace wasn't
properly sanitizing user-submitted markup, and these guys were able to
sneak some JavaScript in.

It's a pretty great hack nonetheless. They used XMLHTTPRequest to make
requests in the background that a user would never notice, which is
what makes it AJAXy.

Two lessons learned:

1) If you allow markup, use a serious sanitizer ... something like
http://chxo.com/scripts/safe_html/ or one of the others discussed
previously on this list

2) Take steps to prevent forged form submissions ... for an excellent
tutorial, see http://shiflett.org/articles/security-corner-dec2004.

But further to number 2, if you don't have protection against
JavaScript there isn't much you can do to secure your forms. Even the
random token method that Chris describes can be foiled if the attacker
is scripting XMLHTTPRequests, because the script can request and then
POST a valid form, without the user ever knowing it.

Neato.

Back in the glory days of Big-6 consulting, that was called the
T.H.U.D. Factor(TM).

In order to bill a client excessive amounts of cash for a
quickly-written paper, you needed to ensure an adequate T.H.U.D.
Factor for proper justification of funds appropriation to suit your
needs.

Analysis of T.H.U.D. is simple - pick up the tome, drop it on your
desk, and measure the sound in decibels.

I can tell you this book makes a pretty good T.H.U.D. when it hits the 
desk.  The cover even looks nice.  All kidding aside, when I have a 
chance to read through it, I will let you guys know if the substance 
makes as much a thud as the volume.

Yep, and this is exactly what happened.

This is primarily a CSRF attack, and it uses a XSS vulnerability as a 
platform. Apparently Myspace had CSRF protection, but because the XSS 
vulnerability allowed the attacker to inject some XMLHttpRequest stuff 
into people's profiles, that could be used to first request the form 
(victim's token included) and then send the CSRF attack along with the 
valid token. The clever part is that the CSRF payload exploited the XSS 
vulnerability again, proliferating itself through other people's profiles.

CSRF and XSS have been a deadly combination for years, and I'm hoping 
this recent incident helps raise awareness further.

The technical details are interesting, but the personal account is worth 
reading just for the laughs:

I got it from the publisher, too. I had the manuscript (which is 
gigantic) and managed to read through some of it. The stuff on OO 
programming with PHP makes it pretty easy to understand, the explanation 
of variable functions was very nice, and there's thankfully not a great 
deal of "PHP works this way, while C does..." which I never really get a 
great deal of value from.

I'll let you know as I get through more of it.

Message-ID: <dc1507df0510141110t3d644eddufddb778d54ceeaf5@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a php function to get all the parameters in a user function in an
array?

For example, I have several strings in a function, and I'd like to do the
same thing to all of them before I deal with them individually:

function my_function($a, $b, $c, $d){
foreach ($array_of_parameters as $p){
$p = trim($p);
}
}

Thanks for your help.

Message-ID: <dc1507df0510141109j3d4c663am23aad2df534943de@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a php function to get all the parameters in a user function in an
array?

For example, I have several strings in a function, and I'd like to do the
same thing to all of them before I deal with them individually:

function my_function($a, $b, $c, $d){
foreach ($array_of_parameters as $p){
$p = trim($p);
}
}

Thanks for your help.

A few notes:
--see the func_get_arg() and func_get_args() functions
--see the array_map() function
--remember a function can take an array as a parameter (which isn't 
necessary, given the above functions I noted, but may be easier)

Hi Robyn,

This sounds like a job for func_get_args:

i think func_get_args() is what i need -- thank you.

(i don't want pass an array into the function in this case, because i want
to deal with each item separately later in the function.)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] bounced email and Mail::send()
Message-ID: <43500B6F.7060509@polymerdb.org>

Hi All,

I would expect mail sent to bad addresses to bounce, but maybe I'm 
missing something.  The following code snippet does send mail to good 
addresses, but mail to bad addresses don't seem to bounce back to me.  I 
suppose I'm missing some header, but I don't know what it would be.  Any 
ideas?

<?php
        include_once('Mail.php');
        include_once('Mail/mime.php');

        $hdrs = array(
                      'From'    => 'me at mydomain.com',
                      'Subject' => 'email subject',
                      'Return-Path' => 'me at mydomain.com',
                      'Reply-To' => 'me at mydomain.com',
                      'Return-Receipt-To' => 'me at mydomain.com'
                      );
        $mime = new Mail_mime("\n");
        $mime->setTXTBody("sample text");
        $mime->addAttachment('/tmp/sample.pdf', 'application/pdf');

        $body = $mime->get();
        $hdrs = $mime->headers($hdrs);

        $mail =& Mail::factory('mail');
        $mail->send('nonExistentUser at mydomain.com', $hdrs, $body);
?>

BTW, I checked, and the mail is not falling into a failover or other 
black hole that I know of.  For example sending to 
"nonExistentUser at mydomain.com" from my desktop mail client gets me a 
bounce within a few minutes.  Any thoughts?

Robyn,

Why not array_walk() BEFORE you pass them into the function, or is there some specific reason it needs to be done in the function itself?

You already have paramater "Return-path" in your header so it should 
work. Do you use proper syntex in writing your all headers? Moreover try 
to add 1 more parameter "Errors-To" to your header string and then check 
whether it works or not. I have not tested it, but normally it works.

Thanks

Well, after further review, it appears it *did* work after all, but not 
in the way I expected.  Bounced mail came back into my CLI user's 
mailbox (let's call it "shell_PHP_user at example.com"), not the one marked 
in the headers ("me at example.com"). In fact, the headers on most of this 
bounced mail show the original message as coming from 
"shell_PHP_user at localhost".

I'm guessing there's some sendmail tweaking to be done here. But still, 
shouldn't the headers I pass to Mail::send() be the same headers that 
get attached to the mail?

For the sake of detail, here are the first few header lines of the email 
that's being sent -- notice that 'shell_PHP_user' is being used on the 
lines above, while 'me' is being used on the lower lines:

That's when I run the script from the command line.  If I run it through 
the Web, it's all the same except 'apache' is used instead of 
'shell_PHP_user'.  In any case, somehow the user name is being used 
instead of the values passed to $mime->headers().  Odd, right?

At this point it's academic, as I've found the bounced mail and know 
where it's going, but why the heck isn't this mail using the headers I 
give it?

I'll keep looking and post any answers here as a follow-up.

Message-ID: <8d9a42800510150748v64ea7131hdf0ae5893dfffffe@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

I have started to create an object oriented approach at form handling with
PHP 5, can i get some constructive criticism on the code if you have time. I
have also attempted to implement the Decorator Pattern.

http://codebowl.dontexist.net/codebowl.zip

currently i have a TextInput, TextValidator that are working, when you add
the widget to the form you say if the item is required or not, if it is then
a * is shown next to the input field, and it's validated upon post, if not
well then there's nothing to validate.

If someone could look this over for me i would appreciate it ;) I think the
code is a bit of a mess as to see if the item is required i have to pass
through about 3 classes.

Thanks,

Or you can pass the arguments as an array, and
then decompose them for use inside the function:

function my_function($args)  {
  foreach ($args as $arg) trim($arg);
  list($arg1, $arg2, $arg3) = $args;
}

Or pass an associative array to the function with
the keys being the names of the individual arguments
and decompose them as variable variables:

foreach ($args as $name => $value) $$name = trim($value);

This would also be useful if you want the function to
process a variable number of arguments

There are countless ways of doing this sort of thing,
it might help if you explained in more detail what the
data and the function is trying to accomplish. --doug

Normally you do not require to set header "Return-path" because return 
path address is automatically taken by Sendmail as the user who sends 
emails. Hence in your case it is "apache" when when sending mail from 
web and "shell user" while sending mail from shell.

Hence now you have only 2 options. To set above header in desired way, 
do not pass "Return-path" header while sending email. Instead in mail 
function use 5th arguments like below.

mail('To mail', 'Subject', 'Message', 'All required header', '-f 
bounce at someone.some');

This fifth parameter (was added in PHP 4.0.5) is your Return-Path. Here 
"bounce at someone.some" is your bounce mail address. Alternatively you can 
set permanent address in your php.ini or httpd.conf like below.

/usr/sbin/sendmail -f 'bounce at someone.some'

Please note that I have not tested above, so you have to try. But it 
will work most probably or you may have to change syntax according to 
php.ini or httpd.conf.

And sending mail from shell, invoke sendail command by using "-f" option 
and specify bounced email adress. See below.

[...]# /usr/sbin/sendmail -f 'bounce at someone.some' REST OF ARGUMENTS

Hello all,

we are a funded arts organisation. im not 100% sure if i'm posting to 
the right list.
i have been trying to adapt php gallery scripts to fit my needs and have 
realized i dont really know what im doing!

_brief introduction to 'us'_

Walkingtheland is a long-term initiative led by three Stroud based 
artists, landscape enthusiasts and educators.
our work has two threads:
1. to develop and produce our own work in response to walking through 
the landscape as a group.
2. the artists show this work as a catalyst for working with local 
people, artists and others with a keen interest in the landscape.
Participants are supported in developing their own work in response to 
the walks and this work is then curated on a web-based /e/Gallery. Over 
time this will develop into an archive of responses to local landscape.

we have arts funding to develop the second thread

_what we need.
_
a dynamic and efficient way of storing and displaying images (and 
eventually movie and sound)

we are currently using iframes (created by photoshop and simplifying the 
html a little) but its obviously becomes a bit longwinded the more 
images we have the more pages 
http://www.walkingtheland.org.uk/walkingthelandgallery/ (and click on 
the names on the right to see the gallerys)

at the moment we badly need to start storing images and displaying them 
well. but we have a vision to develop the way the images are displayed 
in the future.
we want to create 'online' maps of images sounds movies and journeys 
incorporating GIS.

_any ideas?_

if anyone has any ideas or can offer any help it would be greatly apreciated

if i hear from anyone then i can be far more specific

regards tom

Thanks, Anirudh.  I'll look into this some more.  To pass the -f flag to 
the PHP mail() function might work, but also I am trying to do this with 
PEAR Mail::send(), so I will dig deeper into that codebase to look for 
clues.

Still mystified,

Hi Tom,

Instead of starting from scratch, try looking into existing gallery
scripts/applications. My favorite one is "Gallery"
http://gallery.menalto.com/ It's an open source application, so you will be
able to customize it for the functionality that you need. (Unless of course,
you really want to roll out your own package).

I went nuts with this until I gave up on shell emails and used TCP.  The
TCP option requires you to have your email server running, but on the
other hand, the shell method made it impossible to get the Return path
right, and that was a deal-breaker.  Using the PEAR package the code is
this:

// Assume an array $em() that has some stuff in it
include_once('Mail.php');
$recipients =$em["email_to"];
$headers['From']    = $from_name. "<".$from_addr.">";
$headers['To']      = $em["email_to"];
$headers['Subject'] = $em["email_subject"];
$headers['Date']    = date("D, j M Y H:i:s O",time());
$body = $em["email_message"];
$mail_object = Mail::factory('smtp', $params);
$mail_object->send($recipients, $headers, $body);

Once I got this running I've never looked back.

Now *this* works.  I didn't realize that the Mail::factory() docs 
mentioned a $backend argument, and even those docs wouldn't have lead me 
to believe I'd get better results by changing it, but just switching to 
'smtp' instead of 'mail' seems to have solved the problem entirely. 
Good call.

Thanks,
Allen

This "-f " switch has 2 drawback as well. Sometimes web based email 
treats it as span because, you forcibly mention different Return-path 
than it should be. Check all headers of your mail. You may find 1 header 
in your mail like "X-Authentication-Warning: SERVER NAME: apache set 
sender to bounce at SOMETHING.SOME using -f"

So you should use authenticated user account like root, admin etc. so 
above header will not added with your messages. Please note that you can 
not set return path using headers. so header "Return-path" will not 
yield anything.

Thanks,

I have been playing around with the new PDO objects in PHP 5.1 and for 
some reason I cannot get any of the constants to work.  I have followed 
the examples to the wire but no matter what I try, I keep getting an 
error telling me that the constants are undefined. Anyone else have this 
problem so far? Any sugestions?

Statements such as: $sth->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);  will always yield a 
simular error:

*Fatal error*: Undefined class constant 'FETCH_ASSOC'

My test code follows what you will find at:

Find out what class defines the constant (by searching for the
'FETCH_ASSOC' string, or otherwise).  Find out if that class file is
included, or if that class is defined using 'class_exists()'
http://us2.php.net/class_exists.  Given the error, it is likely that
your code is not including the required class file.  It could also be
possible that the class defines the constant incorrectly, but that is
less likely.

Hi,

My company has been using its own PHP framework, called Lampshade, when 
building products for our clients for a long time. As of today, we've 
made it open-source. Feel free to download and take it for a test drive.

Here's a link to the press release, which links to the download page:

Let me know if you have any questions, too.

Thanks,

A while back, I wrote up a small script that fetched and cached (mysql) 
historical stock prices from Yahoo!Finance, then plotted it with the GD 
library.
It also scraped Yahoo for the analyst ratings and can optionally plot 
them too (I was toying around with some ideas about automated prediction 
of stock movement based on weighted analyst ratings). Anyway, feel free 
to give it a try http://www.datawhorehouse.com/stock/prolookup.php
It is "work safe" unless you check off the "XXX" option.

hmmm, a long, long time ago, I had grabbed a GREAT little snippet
database to dump my PHP code snippets into. Alas, that Mac melted on
me (well actually I drowned it, but that's another story all
together!)

Yes, I know I should write it myself, but I'm swamped with college
classes, and the one I had before was excellent. I was wondering if
anyone has seen one around, or how do you efficiently manage your code
hacks, tips, snippets etc?

thanks, ed  :-)

You can modify the routines to generate charts of any size. I'll make 
the source available after I clean up the big security holes. :o

This is a pretty decent stock parser, i had to use curl instead of
fopen, but same principals apply. I'm actually integrating it with a
flash application that pulls quotes from php then does some glowing
cubes in flash based on % changes in price.  It's not xml based, but
does the job.

Should get you started:

I'm truly embarrassed to publish this code. It was just a 
hacked-together thing to test some ideas. Really not anything of 
presentable quality.
You can glance over it and maybe get some ideas though.
I added some comments at the start of getquote.php which describes the 
database structure.

http://www.datawhorehouse.com/stock/prolookup.phps - main script which 
users access
    getquote.phps - fetches the quote(s) from the database or web. If 
via web, then cache in the database
    backgroundgetquote.phps - launches a unix background process to 
fetch and cache quotes (so user does not have to wait)
    getratings.phps -  fetches analyst ratings for a given stock
    graph.phps - plots a graph given many parameters
    prepend.phps - database setup and query wrapper.

I've set up a static site for my client while I work on the shopping cart. The html files include double quotes which come across on his browser and mine as odd characters. I figured out how to set the encoding on my Mozilla to universal but the client and customers are not likely as computer literate.

Is there a way to force the browser to see the double quotes properly? As always, if there's something you can point me to that i missed, lemme know.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] [OT]Forcing charset on a shared webhost?


I've set up a static site for my client while I work on the shopping cart.
The html files include double quotes which come across on his browser and
mine as odd characters. I figured out how to set the encoding on my Mozilla
to universal but the client and customers are not likely as computer
literate.

Is there a way to force the browser to see the double quotes properly? As
always, if there's something you can point me to that i missed, lemme know.

ciao!

Subject: [nycphp-talk] File Download Question
In-Reply-To: <48615.38.117.147.25.1130124079.squirrel@38.117.147.25>
Message-ID: <BF7D4AD4.10E39%php@haberco.com>

I have a file download area on my site. Users click a link, a JS pop-up
window pops with a meta-refresh tag that refreshes to the file to be
downloaded. The pop-up window also refreshes (reloads) the opener page.

Everything works great, except one problem. I am using a PHP script as a
gatekeeper/passthru for the file to be downloaded. Once the file download
begins, no other links on the browser (parent or pop-up) will resolve until
the download is over or is stopped. The second the download stops, any
clicked on link resolves.

The odd part is: If the meta-refresh in the pop-up goes directly to the zip
file, the browser can link away without problem. But if meta-refresh links
to the php script that dispenses the file, the links won't resolve during
download. Script is below.

Much appreciated! Thank you,
Eddie

Eddie,

It sounds to me like you may have an issue with your sessions, as 
presumably the php download script is blocking your other pages from 
accessing the session.

If you put a call to session_write_close 
(http://www.php.net/session_write_close) after anything that needs 
access to the session but before the portion of the script that takes a 
long time, it should fix your problem.

Message-ID: <94debb045c6ace0fcc3bb63cdcecbdd1@mac.com>

hello,

i'm new to the list.

i was reading some of the posts about database performance,
and have an idea to help speed up certain queries.

given a one to many relationship between
parent_table and child_table_a...

parent_table
-------------
parent_id (unique key) indexed
child_table_a_count
more_cols
...
-------------

child_table_a
-------------
parent_id
child_id
more_cols
...
--------------

the idea is to keep a record of how many children a parent record
has, then use limit, so the query doesn't have to search the entire
child table looking for rows that match parent_id. it will quit
when it's found the correct number of rows.

both tables are innodb

in the application, (or with a trigger?)
set up a transaction where;

whenever rows are added to or deleted from
child_table_a, child_table_a_count in parent_table
is updated to the number of child rows.

to look up child rows in child_table_a for parent_id,

1. query parent_table for child_table_a_count for parent_id.

2. construct the next query, using the value of
    child_table_a_count as the value for limit.

maybe this is way too much work, or maybe limit doesn't
actually stop searching the table when it reaches the
limit_num.

could this be useful?

thanks,
glenn

You can also use nested set theory.  This makes retrieval of parents, 
children, siblings, etc. extremely fast and efficient.  This also allows 
for an unlimited hierarchy.  The math is a bit more confusing at first, 
but quite trivial once you get it. The adjacency list model is 
significantly slower but much easier to understand.  A good link to help 
understand this is 
http://www.intelligententerprise.com/001020/celko.jhtml?_requestid=1266295.  
Also note, that in Oracle, there is a specific function to deal with 
this ... postgres, mysql, sql server and others do not deal with 
hierarchical structures in flat format.  Hope this helps, although I am 
not sure what the question was in the first place.

You're on the right track.

The character(s) in question are probably inserted by a Microsoft
application that is configured (by default) to insert 'smart quotes',
em dash, trademark symbol etc in place of the actual ASCII characters
you type at the keyboard.  These bad characters (like the 'smart
quote') that are part of the Windows-1250 character set
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1250) that is incompatible with
simple ASCII or UTF-8.  There are many reasons why this is a 'dumb'
idea.  The main one is that not all user agents will be able to render
such characters, because the character is NOT present in the font
available on the client system - even IF the appropriate character set
is specified in the document header.  Even a user on a Microsoft
platform (using a non-Microsoft font) could see incorrect or missing
characters.

The best solution would be to avoid these non-standard characters.

The second best solution would be to replace these troublesome
characters with their unicode equivalent and then specify that
character set in BOTH the HTTP header like this
    header("Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8");
(assuming you're using PHP -- there are many variations depending on
the http server and scripting language in use)
and your document using a tag like this for HTML:
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
or this for XML
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
Text is said to be in a Unicode encoding form if it is encoded in
UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32  If you want to use a character that is not in
UTF-8, then you can always use a numeric or character entity
reference.  There is a great FAQ at the unicode website here
http://www.unicode.org/faq/unicode_web.html

There is also a 'demoroniser' script
(http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/demoroniser/) that will clean your
documents if you have lots of cleanup to do.

A great tutorial can be found at
http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/chars.html, with additional information
at http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html/chars.html, which might lead
you to think "this guy knows his stuff" (Korpela, not me)  Where can I
read more? http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/www.html

Then there is the wikipedia set of articles on the topic:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding

Setting the HTTP header http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-charset.html

No list of references would be complete without a link to the W3C spec

Um, not sure what you mean. I have an html file with the error that web browsers don't know how to read the character. There's no php in it.

ciao!

You should read some of the references/FAQs I posted, but the short
answer is replace the fancy quotes that are in your document with
regular " from your keyboard (using a plain text editor or capable web
editor like Quanta Plus).

If you didn't create the original file, then you /might/ be in the
position where you can't actually see the offending characters.  In
that case, use a tool like Tidy or the demoroniser to do the work for
you.

Utterly cool. Now, if only they would add a Flash animation that shows the

You are correct, using LIMIT will often be faster than the same query 
without LIMIT:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/limit-optimization.html

However, the problem of keeping the parent_table updated with how many 
child rows apply may kill those gains.  It depends whether the child data 
changes often or rarely.  If the child data changes ten times for every 
one time you SELECT it, you will lose more than you gain.  If the child 
data changes twice yearly and is SELECTED ten times per second, this 
denormalization will clearly benefit performance.

It's all in how the data is actually being used.

Sorry if my reply seemed off, I read the one answer before getting to yours. The complication is that i looked at the file on the server with "more" and it looked fine. Then I used "vi" to look at it and saw that indeed the odd characters were there.

So I'll read through your suggestions and put them to work. Thanks!

I have implemented this structure, but have added several fields. For
starters, I keep the id, parent id relationship because it seems handy
at times, and then add a tree level/depth field. This makes updates a
bit more complex, but if you are mainly performing various sorts of
reads, I think it makes things faster and presentation a bit easier.

I wrote a hybrid system based off a nested set idea but also storing the 
parent_id for phpGACL (http://phpgacl.sourceforge.net/).  It works very 
well, scales great and can easily be rebuilt if there is an error in the 
lft,rgt pairs.

The same idea powered this little demo, which some of you may remember.

thanks everyone,

there are far more reads than writes in the data situation I was 
thinking of.

glad to know that the concept is acceptable, at least in certain 
situations.

i was not familiar with nested sets. what a great idea. i'll be checking
that concept out further.

thanks for all the links.

sorry about the rtfm error about how mysql optimizes limit. i had 
checked my
local mysql docs, but didn't check the dev.mysql site.

i'm new to php and mysql (and sql in general), but have a few years
experience with databases and programming. mostly shell and perl using
relational (normalized) sequential plain text files, and isam with 
cobol.

anyway, i'm glad to be here.  hope i can contribute something useful in
the future.

glenn

I just heard about it today and was wondering if it is better than OOP?

any thoughts?

Chris, I think Joseph means Aspect Oriented Programming.

This is an area I've been wanting to explore but haven't yet gotten into. 
There seems to be a lot of new technologies and articles on it recently.

The tutorial below might be of some use as an overview (at least in 
Java/OOP terms).  But you'd probably best be served on how it could be 
applied in PHP terms by looking for an implementation or port of the 
Spring framework (http://springframework.org/).   Maybe 
http://www.aophp.net/ (linked from that wikipedia article).


An introduction to AOP
https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-aopintro/j-aopintro-ltr.pdf

"AOP does not contradict or displace object-oriented design and 
programming, which
all Java developers practice. Instead, it complements them. AOP can be 
viewed as
the next natural adaptive step beyond object-oriented programming (OOP) in
software engineering for developers and research communities."

Yes, Aspect-Oriented Programming, which takes OOP and adds the notion
of "aspects", interfaces that cut across multiple classes.

See http://jroller.com/page/colyer/20040531 for concept, and

PHP was nowhere near as popular as Java in the 90s. :-)

Marc said a lot that we already know, but keep in mind that his words 
carry a lot of weight in the business community, and they're not as 
close to the technology as we are. If this stuff wasn't news to them, it 
wouldn't be getting this much attention.

His statement was that more web applications will be built in the next 5 
years than exist now. Thus, whatever technology dominates over the next 
5 years is going to be firmly in the top spot, and PHP is poised to do 
exactly that. That's what I heard.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Long MySQL processes, connections
Message-ID: <6C52C4A2-D964-4A7A-A388-CE794EFFFFDF@matt-roberts.net>


I'm using mysql_connect() to access a MySQL database at the beginning  
of a PHP script.

This script does long process of a large recordset, and generally  
takes 30-40 minutes to process all records.

My question: what's the best way to handle this long connection?  
Could someone please explain the behind the scenes / best practice  
around MySQL var "wait_timeout" ?  Sometimes the process hangs -  
could it be related to this timeout variable?  As a workaround I  
connect and disconnect at the top and bottom of the processing loop -  
is this a bad idea?

Thanks!
Matt

$recipients = 'dmintz at davidmintz.org';
$headers['From']    = 'vernon at vernontbludgeon.com';
$headers['To']      = '"David Mintz" <dmintz at davidmintz.org>';

true === $result = $mailer->send($recipients, $headers, $body)
	or exit($result->getMessage());
echo "ok\n" ;
?>

When this message reaches my inbox and I read it with the pine email
client, the To field says

To: dmintz at davidmintz.org, David Mintz <dmintz at davidmintz.org>

that is, listing my email address twice. Though I in fact get just one
copy of the message, it's ugly.

But when I send mail to myself through any other means I don't get this
behavior. And when I read this same message via my hosting service's web
interface, the To header displays thus


To:   	"David Mintz" <dmintz at davidmintz.org>

which is what I want/expect.

Comments?

David,

It looks like you're already setting the To: header when you set recipients 
and use it as the first argument to 'send'.  Leave out the $headers['To'] 
and that should fix it.  I'm not familiar with this class, but there might 
be another association to set Name.

Sorry for the onslaught.  I've been busy with loads of other things and 
just got a moment to (write a script that automatically generates the 
text, helping me to...) catch up.

By the way, you can also catch these things in other formats:
RSS:  http://phpsec.org/projects/vulnerabilities/securityfocus.xml
HTML: http://phpsec.org/projects/vulnerabilities/securityfocus.html

See you,

Bingo.

Of course, the solution you suggest occurred to me as soon as I got into
the shower and adjusted the water temperature to my liking. You know:
step away from the machine, sir.

Thanks.

Also, I tried it myself and found you can get the formatting you want by 
setting $recipients as follows, leaving out the $headers['To'] again.


$recipients = "John Daly <jdaly at panix.com>";
$headers['From']    = 'foo at bar.com';
//$headers['To']      = "John Daly <jdaly at panix.com>";

Its great that he is championing PHP.

But in terms of what the 'business community' thinks of him,
take a look at a weekly stock chart of OPSW (Opsware Inc) since
Jan of '04.

Jan 04  --  9.00
Jan 05  --  7.00
Recently -  5.00

'HAhahahahahahaha' sort of captures the spirit of it...

Exactly what I did. Seems that's the "right" way to do it, and all the
mail readers I worked with ~except~ pine were flexible enough to work with
me doing it "wrong."

One thing I'm not clear on (said he, modulating into another topic) is
whether we are supposed to put double-quotes around "John Daly," to use
your example. It appears that we are.

Thanks again.

Speaking of, one of the core developers was at a conference in Europe
where they ran an analysis on Joomla! and gave up after about a half
hour, with no major XSS issues found.

Not to say that we have all holes plugged, but we difinitely could be
doing worse ;-)

Right, me too, though it seems to me that rfc 2822 
(http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt) makes no mention of quoting 
the display-name.

However, it is true that if your display-name has any special characters 
in it (this includes the "period" character ".", among other things) and 
you don't double-quote it, PEAR Mail is going to refuse to send it, 
saying "validation failed for W. Allen Shaw <ashaw at polymerdb.org>"

Note this interesting snippet from RFC 2822:
>    Note: The "period" (or "full stop") character (".") in obs-phrase is

Apparently current email implementations are handling special characters 
in display-name on their own terms; I would think it's wise to use 
double-quotes around the display-name unless you know for sure they 
won't use special characters.

BTW, I'm glad you asked, as it gave me finally the extra curiosity to 
learn more.  Hopefully somebody will correct me if I'm wrong here.

Take care,
Allen

If you are using a database-centric design, you can do something like this:

Table of groups (roles)

Table of modules
Table of tables
Xref groups to modules
Xref groups to tables

A group has default priveleges of ins, upd, del, sel.  The "Xref groups to
modules" overrides group settings for a module.  the "Xref groups to
tables" further overrides at the table level.

If you want to start off a little simpler, just to a table of roles and a
table of tables.

Easily the best session at the conference. It only works with MySQL right
now but creating additional db sources doesn't look too bad.

I'm revisitting this thread.  

While the above mentioned http analyzers are java based, I like their
functionality.  I've been poking around freshmeat searching for 'http'
or 'proxy' but nothing is jumping out at me. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for non-java solutions.. aside from telnet?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] phpMyAdmin 2.6.4-pl3 problem
Message-ID: <435CEFE8.7000309@neuropunks.org>

Hello,
I am having an authentication issue with phpmyadmin 2.6.4-pl3.
The auth mechanism is set to 'cookie', but I cannot get any users to login.
I get

051024  9:19:53   31443 Connect pmacontrol at xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx on
31443 Query       SELECT VERSION() AS version
31444 Connect Access denied for user: 'user at xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' (Using
password: YES)

in the log file.
MySQL stores all user passwords using its internal password('password')
function. Proper access lists are defined for both pmacontrol at ip and for
user at ip
I ran all GRANT statements from documentation.
pmacontrol user, as well as the user Im trying to use, are able to login
from the host with mysql -h db -u user -p command, I tested it, and I
can do select's on mysql database.

config.inc.php for phpmyadmin:

$cfg['PmaAbsoluteUri'] = 'https://mysql.xxx.com/';
$cfg['blowfish_secret'] = 'bw_password';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']          = 'db';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser']   = 'pmacontroluser';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass']   = 'password';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']     = 'cookie';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']          = '';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']      = '';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['pmadb']         = 'phpmyadmin';

Everything else is default, database phpmyadmin exists (not really
relevant for this it seems), my browser works fine with cookies.
I followed all the instructions from documentation, did a bunch of flush
privileges; from mysql, but still nothing works.
Can anyone shed some light on this?

Thank you very much!
max

Seems like few hosts do support it. But a BIG part of the conference,
heard time and time again from many presenters, was how wonderful PHP 5
is -- and for that matter, the new MySQL 5. Seems to me that if you have
enough clients, managing a dedicated server might be a good alternative.
Or even talk them into it. For a business -- a few hundred bucks a month
doesn't seem to bad.

today. Lukas Smith wrote a good article for PHP Magazine explaining

I had a similar problem. The mysql client was not the same version as

It is not necessary to upgrade the mysql client, but you do have to jump 
through an extra hoop to get it working.

do an
update user set password=old_password('yourpassword') where 
user='user at xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx';
to the "mysql" database as the root/admin user.

An alternative way is to add "old_passwords" to your my.cnf file then 
restart mysql.

It gets even as cheap as $30/month at Serverpronto.com whom I use.

However, don't forget all the administration time. Managing a server
is also a full time job, especially when you're managing mail and all
its associated problems, and not to mention customer support. I've
been bitten in the ass by this problem before.

Just tried this.
Still no effect after running this SQL query, and more, when i put
old_passwords into my.cnf or run mysql with --old-passwords and try to
shutdown and then start mysql, it fails to start, with no errors in any
log files, but once I remove that, it starts fine.
Also, at that link it talks about PHP's incompatibility with MySQL's 4.1
and up passwords, but this is PHP5 with MySQL 4.0.18, and I know
password authentication works for other applications on that host
written in PHP and using that database..
Russ, both client and server are same version..
I am upgrading MySQL to 5, its a shot in the dark, but maybe that will
solve this issue.
Other than that, I am totally stumped..

It depends on your setup, of course. If you use a stable OS and
outsource your email you can reduce your system administration
overhead to 1-2 hours per month. It's only a full time job when you
are setting up a new client or something goes wrong.

Anybody tried it, Qcodo?

I've just installed it and it keeps saying:

Fatal error: Class 'MySqli' not found in
F:\projectos\qCodo\includes\qcodo\database_adapters\MySqliDatabase.inc
on line 113

Now, everything is as it should be, acording to the readme file.

Clues, anyone?

I'm using the latest xampp, apache2 php5, and so on and so forth.

Demo looks great, though, hehe.

Thanks.

Have you looked at LiveHTTPHeaders? It's a Firefox plugin rather than a 
proxy, but it's good enough for most situations. I find it a tad 
frustrating when I need to view the content, and there are some other 
things that annoy me, but it's worth checking out.

There's also this: http://sourceforge.net/projects/protoscope/

I wrote it back in the late 90s and reworked it a bit a few years later. 
It's nothing great, but it works most of the time. :-)

Hope that helps.

Sounds to me like you need mysqli or need to choose another database 
adapter. :-)

oops. I forgot to mention, after making changes you have to do a "flush

I'd need more details to truly diagnose this (or even determine if there's
something wrong).  That said, wait_timeout isn't likely playing a role here.
It controls the timeout for inactive/idle connections.

The process hangs could be from a number of things, including hardware
limitations, large tasks during the course of normal processing, contension,
etc.  Again, without knowing what type of processing is being done, it's not
easy to determine what the problem is, and frankly, if there is even a
problem at all.  Depending on how many rows you're dealing with, the
timeframe might be ok.

Message-ID: <009f01c5d8c7$acdddd80$0ba8a8c0@cliff>

Now that you're all having fun with Qcodo, you really need to take a
look at this. Ok, so it will cost a bit more than a $30 cheapo dedicated
server.
 
John Allspaw of Yahoo/Flicker gave a great presentation on serious LAMP
scaling infrastructure, starting with a single server and growing to
multiple servers, MySQL farms, load balancers and such, along with the
problems incurred along the way.

Thanks Hans,

I did some performance tuning around my queries based on advice from this:
http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/article.php/1382791

It seems to have sped up the routine significantly.

To boil it down to a "best practice" question: of the following two
routines, what is preferable in the general case?


Process A:
---------------------
Connect to mysql
for (~ 10k iterations){
    Query larger (500k rows) table in mysql
    Insert into same mysql
}
Disconnect from mysql
---------------------

Process B
---------------------
for (~ 10k iterations){
    Connect to mysql
    Query larger (500k rows) table in mysql
    Insert into same mysql
    Disconnect to mysql
}
----------------------



I've generally seen process A in all books I've read, but in my particular
example process B *seems* less error prone (but as you say Hans, it may
depend on many other details I'm leaving out here)

However, B looks kind of dumb and expensive to me - how costly is the
connect / disconnect operation?

The online manual is great for keyword searches.  There are plenty of
functions to manipulate images, so you may also find something to do
snapshots out of vids.

This is a big can of worms, due to the very large number of different
video codecs out there. Within the separate universes of QuickTime and
Windows Media, there are mpeg, mpeg2, mpeg4, motion-jpeg, DivX, h264,
Indio, Sorenson, etc etc etc.

Additionally, which frame do you choose to make the thumbnail from?
The first? It's often black. QuickTime files sometimes have a set
"poster frame" that the author has designated as a representative
still image. The same may be true of Windows Media files, I don't
know.

Google has obviously managed to solve this problem, though, see
http://video.google.com/

It's probably only a small can of worms though. There are only a handful 
of popular codec's to tackle. I don't think it's exculsively a php job 
though. There are a few windows and linux video "rippers" which will 
convert video to frames. Usenet binaries has been doing it for a long 
time now. Check out an example at:  
http://www.usenetbinaries.com/groups/alt.binaries.mpeg.videos/2005/10/24/h/1v.html

Another video.google.com example would be www.youtube.com

Message-ID: <002a01c5d9a7$34f16bd0$0ba8a8c0@cliff>

I am trying to implode one column of a multidimensional array:
 
$array = array[]['name'];                   
implode("string", $array[]['name']); 
 
Is there a simple function for extracting a single column of a
multidimensional array other than using a foreach statement?

You would think there'd be a PHP class or script does does this...

I looked thru the manual but doesn't seem like a function that does it
out of the "starting gate"...

This is not trivial and requires you to either manually learn some of 
the codecs or use plugin libraries.  I don't really think this is 
something php is well suited for a believe writing an app in something 
like C with some of the standard libraries compiled in would be best..

Well don't forget though that PHP is a wonderful glue language, using
backtick and exec you can run any existing CLI interface to any known
library.

...if you're on linux of course.

great point ... if you can find apps that take care of this for you then 
use php to call, log, manage and run everytyhing.  If you plan on 
building from scratch ... well ... that might be a but difficult.

According to the Internet Traffic Report, there may be some problem here in
North America. We're usally in the high 80's to mid 90's but it seems right
now we're in the mid 70's. Looks like Qwest and UU.net are having some MAJOR
problems (qwest is totally down right now).

I'm not 100% clear on what you're looking to do, but this might be an
alternative to a foreach if your intention is to get the value of every
"name" for each index:

    $records =  array(
        array ('name'=>'foo', 'junk'=>'asdf'),
        array ('name'=>'bar', 'junk'=>'asdf'),
        );
    function get_name($array) { return $array['name']; }
    $names = implode(', ', array_map('get_name', $records));
    // $names is 'foo, bar'

Interesting solution. array_map with a callback makes my head spin a
bit! I'll try to benchmark this solution versus foreach to see which is
faster and will report back.

I use xampp locally on my pc for php development.

For a server open to the public is the patching strategy exactly the
same if the all the components were individually installed?

I asumme the default install would have to be hardened - any Xampp docs
on this vs. separate docs for each component?

What is the stratagy to take?

For public reference, there has been a group started in DC.

http://www.dcphp.com

I haven't spoke to the founding member in some time, but things were off to
a good start, and fed open source involvement was mentioned.  As things
evolve in DC, NYPHP would also be interested in partnering to see what PHP
interest there is in the fed.

'A' is the way it should be done.  If things are slowing down as the process
goes on, then there's likely some type of memory/resource leak somewhere.
When implementing process A it'll be important to close/free the various
resources and handles that get created.  While PHP does do automatic garbage
collection, I've found that when doing intensive long running operations,
the best-practice of freeing resources is more important.

It is.  Connection buildup/tear-down with MySQL is probably the lightest of
any RDBMS, however there is overhead of course.  If you were using Oracle,
for example, you'd see a considerable delay during connect/disconnect; so
much so, that you'd likely not even consider it an option.

Hello,

I will submit that am really just not smart enough to figure this out.
My logic sucks. Why am I a programmer? I don't know. Someone must have
drugged me the day I picked my career. But I have records in a
database that look like this..

array(
  'id',
  'name' ,
  'parent_id'
)

I want to build a tree.

So far I have..

while ($record->fetch()) {
  $tree[$record->parent_id][$record->id] = $record->name;
}

That produces something like this.

Array
(
    [] => Array
        (
            [1] => General
        )

    [1] => Array
        (
            [2] => Diseases
            [5] => Technologies
            [6] => Financial Data
        )

    [2] => Array
        (
            [3] => Eg 1
            [4] => Eg 2
        )

    [6] => Array
        (
            [7] => Articles
            [8] => Models
            [9] => Comps
        )

)

Now how can I go about appending each node to its matching parent? Or
is there a completely better way?

Have I made any sense? ;-)

maybe cooking up something with manual locks and handler
would help?

One solution is to change your DB design, but I imagine that is not an 
option.
That being said, if you are using balanced trees, you can implement a 
b-tree algorithm.
If you are using unbalanced trees (meaning, nodes can be any number, any 
depth, etc.) you could opt for a binary tree.

I agree completely (also called nested sets).  This can be implemented 
in both php and the DB for excellent performance, truly unbalanced trees 
and unlimited depth of parent-child.
You would end up with your object (id, name) and a left and right side 
numeric value.  A child is something where its left side > parents left 
and its right side < parents right
here is a poor textual representation (left side, right side):

            (1 ,10)
               |
         --------------
         |            |
      (2,7)        ( 8,9)
        |
    ----------
    |        |
(3,4)       (5,6)

All you need is a record number for each element and an "up" pointer in 
each child record pointing to its parent's record number.

What is the going rate/range for PHP programmers? At the Zend conference, 
one presenter said he paid $40-$50K. However, he did admit that his talent 
pool wasn't that skilled (we're not talking computer scientists). And he was 
located in a depressed, middle-of-nowhere town and his company was the only 
game around.

Ahh, good old NSM...

New York PHP developed an implementation of NSM, pNSM, as part of the clew
project.

There is endless discussion on the NYPHP-Org mailing list, including
presentations and code here:

Then let's start that discussion over here, about the performance
benefits that turn into performance hits when your one table has 300
million rows...

Seriously, this concept makes lots of things seem easier, but next
thing you know, you got a really looooooong table on your hands and
only Oracle (IIRC) can partition across tablespaces at the table
level.

What to do when your nested table becomes more than you can manage? Is
it time then to go back to a more normalized model, or is this an
indication that - before you even implement - you have to take the
eventual number of rows that your nested table might have to manage?

We were having just this discussion at Friday's after yiou left,
Mitch, only my number was much lower than 300 million. The overhead of
inserting new nodes into the tree becomes unbearable much more quickly
than I expected. On commodity hardware with a stock MySQL binary, it
can take four seconds to insert a new node in a tree of 50,000.

Then again, for many projects the convenience more than makes up for
the insertion overhead, and the read performance on the NSM tree
certainly scales as advertised.

But what's the answer? You can finesse the problem a bit, depending on
your data model, by using sub-trees in their own tables. Or you can
use Oracle. Or... ?

That is a very valid point, ...however (there has to be some sort of 
argument) ... if you have a table with N-million rows, chances are your 
DB design isn't very good.  No hierarchical algorithm will perform well 
under conditions like that.  Nested sets will at least give you great 
retrieval times and tons of flexibility with the hierarchy nodes, 
whereas adjacency lists are very stringent and slow and will still end 
up giving you 3 bazillion rows.  Furthermore, if you are in fact dealing 
with that many rows, go buy Oracle or use PostGres (which can also 
partition across tablespaces and allow for OO design).  In my opinion, 
MySQL just falls short when you get into real complicated database 
design (I am ducking under my desk right now, fearing the MySQL fan-base 
may come over my house and shoot me).

In my experience, the only place I've implemented this was where I  
could do batched inserts via rebuilds.  Why inserting individual  
nodes can be a pain, it's on the same order of complexity as  
rebuilding the entire table.

That claim reads to me like 'no data set reasonably has 3 million  
distinct members in it', which is kinda obviously bogus.

I manage a number of ~1T sized databases.  I can guarantee you that  
there are a number of tables in them that have N-million rows, where  
N is not small.  Data points on customer behavior spanning a couple  
years, things like that.

Flat data no problem, but hierarchies of that size?  Better ways to do 
that outside of a DB.

Hi fellow NYPHP'ers,

I work with the Freelancers Union / Working Today, which is a national
non-profit that represents the needs and concerns of the independent
workforce through advocacy, information, and service. We rely on PHP
and open source software extensively for our technology needs.

We are currently looking for freelancer respondents to help us
determine which companies in New York City are the best (and worst)
to freelance for.

Since many NYPHP members are freelancers / consultants, and since the
aggregated information that all of you could provide through this
survey could be valuable, I thought I would post this here.

Take the survey:

Email it to your friends:

Thanks,

- Jay

In the filesystem? Using IMAP for searching and sorting? :-)

My lack of imagination is holding me back here, I know, but a large
hierarchy seems much *less* useful when outside of a DB.

Message-ID: <007f01c5dbd1$4b7c43d0$6401a8c0@GUITAR>


All,

I'm using the Pear HTML_Quickform package to create forms for the latest 
project I'm working on, and I'm running up against something that I can't 
yet figure out:  For complex templated forms, how can I get the form 
elements to display in place, and not only where I explicitly call 
form->display() ?   Let's say I have a table two columns wide, and six rows 
long, and I want to spread form elements over all rows of the first column 
and have them display where they are added.  Can this be done?

Thanks,

John

This is only partly true -- you can queue new nodes and batch-insert
them, provided they are all going to the same place. But if the append
points are scattered throughout the tree, batching doesn't give you
anything.

"Walking the tree" to rebuild the table takes much much longer than
simply appending a node.

One strategy I considered was inserting two or more "unattached" nodes
on any append, to provide spare capacity in the tree with no extra
cost (adding 4 to each left and right value is the same as adding 2).
But this just seems like madness since it will inflate the tree to
twice its optimal size, and end up compounding the problem.

Grrrrr.

Creating a loosely-connected hierarchy, some means of distributing the
tree across multiple tables (or even multiple databases) seems like
the only sustainable solution. Hans Z. has been musing about
multi-dimensional NSM, whereas I keep coming back to namespaces. But I
still don't know what either of those solutions really looks like...

Hi John,

If understand your question correctly, it sounds like you need to look 
at Renders (they let you format the HTML that the element sits in) and 
perhaps the createElement method.  Also, you may use the html parameter 
to addElement to force HTML into your forms.

You may also choose to use HTML_Quickform with one of the template 
engines, for maximum flexibility.

Good Luck!

Greetings listers,

A basic question I'm sure...  (I have checked PHundamentals and did some 
googling and manual searching and book skimming but haven't come up with 
the answers I'm looking for.)

I have currently been setting variable like so:
Version A:
$print_first_name = "You said your first name is 
{$_SESSION['first_name']}.";

At one time I think I had something like:
Version B:
$print_first_name = "You said your first_name is $_SESSION[first_name].";

This would yield the same result on my server, but I think version B is 
incorrect and version A is correct.  I am thinking that Version B is 
incorrect as it is missing the single quotes around the var name, even 
though it does render OK on my server, perhaps it would not in another 
environment?

Then I also had something like:
Version C:
$print_first_name = "You said your first_name is " . 
$_SESSION['first_name'] . ".";

Now I think Version C is technically correct, and the decision to use A 
or C is based on personal preference. 

Basically I'd like to establish a standard for myself and want to make 
sure I'm understanding the usage and scenario's which can arise.

Is there a better alternative method?

Comments, thoughts, suggestions?

Thanks!

-Aaron

It's all based on your coding preference.

Version A works because of the {} it evaluates the variable, however version
A would work even without the {}

The reason being is because when using double quotes variables are evaluated
before being printed.

Version C is the same type i use because from my understanding using double
quotes is bad because it takes longer processing to evaluate the variables
when they are injected into a string in that manner, maybe i am wrong and
just typing more than i have to.

It all boils down to your coding style, preference.

AFAIK:  there is absolutely nothing unkosher about the

	"this is a $array[key]"

syntax because PHP does not try to evaluate constants within double-quoted
strings (which makes sense, if you think about it -- it would have to
check every word). That's why you don't get a warning as you do if you
simply say

echo $array[key]

On my server, version A without {} produces errors when the script runs:

Parse error: parse error, unexpected T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE, 
expecting T_STRING or T_VARIABLE or T_NUM_STRING in 
(home/filepath/filename.php) on line 45

To confirm, Version A is when the var is inside a double quoted string, 
with single quotes around the array['varname']

Interesting.  I hadn't seen mention of that in my books.  It's just 
further confirmation that I need more books!  =)

Not sure I agree that Version C will give you a speed improvement.    
I think gluing strings together is more expensive than expanding a  
double quoted string.   Take the following two scripts:


<?
//  test_a.php  - using single quotes
$string='a';
for($i=0; $i<100000; $i++)    $string='A' . $string .  'B';
echo strlen($string);
?>


<?
// test_b.php - using double quotes
$string='a';
for($i=0; $i<100000; $i++)    $string="A{$string}B";
echo strlen($string);
?>


Using AB  produces the following:

ab -n 10 http://localhost/test_a.php
...
Time per request:       28574.142 [ms] (mean)
...

ab -n 10 http://localhost/test_b.php
...
Time per request:       14057.574 [ms] (mean)
...

Seems like the concatenate operation is 2x slower?  So I would vote  
for Version A being the "best practice."

I too have heard the argument that you should use single quotes  
(especially for array element keys) because your code will preform  
better.  Has anyone done any benchmarking on this?  Does using $row 
['column']  really perform that much better than $row["column"]?

I tend to go with version D:

$print_first_name = 'You said your first_name is '. 
$_SESSION['first_name'] .'.';

As you can see I use single-quotes around the 'string' portions and I 
have modified the spacing rule a little so that I don't leave a space 
between the 'string' portions and the . concatenation operator.

There are a few reasons I use this approach, but chief among them is 
that it makes child's play of spotting variables, especially in a 
syntax-highlighting editor.  If they're embedded within a string they're 
much harder to spot (for me at least).

In the end it comes down to personal preference, my testing indicates 
that the performance difference between single-quotes, double-quotes or 
double-quotes with complex (curly) braces is not large enough to really 
be worth considering unless you are talking about a LOT (> 100,000) 
embedded variables.  I would suggest  going with whatever makes your 
code the most consistent and easiest to maintain.

That is indeed one of the drawbacks I have noticed as well, if I embed 
the var within the string I lose the syntax highlighting which make the 
variables much harder to spot (for me as well).

Benchmark testing is something I have on my list of "to learn about" 
stuff.  It hasn't been mentioned in the books that I have (again, I 
suppose that's further justification for more books).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] getting my head around heirarchical structures
Message-ID: <4362A6A0.8090504@polymerdb.org>

All this heirarchical structure talk happens to come up as I'm trying to 
implement a data filtering scheme for an ad-hoc querying interface.  
Basically I want to allow queries as complex as the user wants -- not 
just on one or two fields at a time -- so this has to be open-ended, and 
it seems to be pointing me to a heirarchical structure.  I think I've 
found something that will work, but I wonder a) if I'm just reinventing 
the wheel somehow, and b) if I should go with this, am I doing it right?

Here goes (in English as simple as my gabby self can make it):

We store all the filters using a table with these fields:
CREATE TABLE `filters` (
  `filterid` int(11),
  `parentid` int(11), -- keys to filterid
  `booltype` enum('and','or'),
  `criteria` varchar(255),
  PRIMARY KEY  (`filterid`)
);
And then we start filling it with filters. Any 'parent' filter doesn't 
store a `criteria` for itself, just the `booltype` value for all its 
children.

INSERT INTO `filters` (`filterid`, `parentid`, `booltype`, `criteria`) 
VALUES (1, NULL, 'and', NULL);
INSERT INTO `filters` (`filterid`, `parentid`, `booltype`, `criteria`) 
VALUES (2, 1, NULL, 'hair=''brown''');
INSERT INTO `filters` (`filterid`, `parentid`, `booltype`, `criteria`) 
VALUES (3, 1, NULL, 'age=''32''');
INSERT INTO `filters` (`filterid`, `parentid`, `booltype`, `criteria`) 
VALUES (4, 1, 'or', NULL);
INSERT INTO `filters` (`filterid`, `parentid`, `booltype`, `criteria`) 
VALUES (5, 4, NULL, 'city=''boston''');
INSERT INTO `filters` (`filterid`, `parentid`, `booltype`, `criteria`) 
VALUES (6, 4, NULL, 'city=''houston''');

So this way I get parent filter 1 joining its children 2, 3 and 4 with 
an 'and' operator; 4 itself also is a parent of 5 and 6, which it joins 
with an 'or' operator.  The result is a filter that says:    hair = 
'brown' and age='32' and (city='boston' or city='houston')

This seems open-ended enough to be very flexible, and it makes sense to 
my feeble brain, but is there a better way to do it?

(sort of like saved queries a user can bring back)?  If not, you can do 
this with sessions.  I am actually implementing something very similar 
right now with open ended queries where we simply give the user a 
buttload of fields to choose from including boolean options.  Since I 
don't care about the query once it returns a result, I assemble it on 
the fly and use DOM/DHTML and a bit of ajax to deal with the 
addition/subtraction of query fields.  Not sure if this helps.

Yeah, this is going to be saved in the database to have on hand for 
later, part of a saved query setup.  And although the "buttload of 
fields" idea occurred to me, the idea here is that I have to design this 
to work even for tables that don't even exist yet.  Once a table or 
relational set of tables is offered for querying, the admin has to mark 
which columns are available, and then the user should be able to pick 
any of those columns to display in the query *and* define filters based 
on any combination of those available columns.

The more I think about this the more it seems like I'm on the right 
track with the recursive parent/child structure, but one thing that's 
giving me pause is that a parent record has no criteria of its own, and 
a child record has no boolean-type of its own; meaning I wind up with 
basically two types of records in this one table.  Still, normalizing 
beyond this point and trying to put those two types of records in two 
different tables seems just insanely and unnecessarily complicated. 
Um... right?

It looks to me as if you are trying to implement views.

Is going to MySQL 5 (or a DBMS that supports views)
an option?

I am not sure how flexible you are making this (can users do inner/outer 
joins, group by, etc.) but the way you set up the system seems a bit 
over complicated.  Based on what you said, there seems to be 2 rather 
simple options:
1) create a view with the parameters the user specifies.  I am not sure 
what db you are using, but if this option is available it is rather 
helpful and simple.
2) construct the query in php and save the query in the db with a name 
or something valid the user remembers.  If you allow users to name the 
query they construct, then you can save it to a table like this:
table: user_query
    query_id: 1
    name: 'Customer Report'
    query: 'select customer_id, customer_name from customer'
This will also allow for some nasty queries, joins, etc., where the 
hierarchical thing might get a bit on the insane side with a large 
complex query.

It is not so much implementing views as giving users a way to specify
views.  Since a view is just a stored query, it is just as well to
generate the query at run-time if doing so gives more flexibility to the
user.  A view on the other hand must be defined by an administrator and so
is outside normal user activity.

Allen,

This is an interesting thread you have started.  I have some suggestions
to add to the thoughts already expressed.

A very big design decision at the start is whether you will support the
validation of the "criteria" values before attempting to execute the
query.  Leaving out the validation makes it simpler to handle the overall
organization, but then the error messages given to users will be SQL
messages that they may or may not be able to figure out.  If you make it
possible to validate the expressions yourself then you can control the
error messages.

One suggestion I would make is that each filter be given a name instead of
an ID, and possibly let the user choose the name.  Then the filters behave
like functions.  This makes nesting more intuitive.  So I can put two
filters into your table:

OVER18 => 'Age >= 18'
NATIVE => 'State_where_born = State_where_lives'

Then build up complex functions through composition, so that I can have
this function:

NAT_18 => OVER18 && NATIVE

This requires your table to be set up a little differently, but will give
you complete expressive power.

A query is then really a separate thing, not stored in the same table as
the filters.  A query needs to know a table, a list of columns, and a list
of functions.  If your queries can also pull from other queries in JOIN
and UNION then you have a generalized report writer.  If you have a very
sophisticated data dictionary then your report writer can even figure out
when to JOIN and when to UNION.

Creating views is not outside user activity:
Create_view_priv has been available since MySQL 5.0.1.

Originally Allen asked am I just reinventing
the wheel.

I would say he is not *just* reinventing views --
this approach could be quite valuable to
people with a dbms that doesn't implement views.

The tree he described is reminiscent of a syntax tree.

So, taking a look at:
http://www.dbs.ethz.ch/education/isk/WS_97/syntax_diagramme/sld004.html

might spark some ideas.

Perhaps I should phrase it differently.  When a user is specifying search
criteria, they are not interested in whether they are creating some
server-side object, they just want the result.  So while it may or may not
be a programmer's decision to implement the result as a view, the design
decisions in the original post should focus more on how to lay out tables
that will allow the user to specify criteria.

Also, there are other databases in the world besides MySQL.

Hi All,

Wow, I see a lot of discussion has happened since I read my mail last 
night.  (Shame on me for starting a thread at 6 PM on a Friday, anyway...)

Without backing up too much, I guess I should clarify a little bit more. 
  What I'm looking for here is a way to store and retrieve an unlimited 
combination of boolean filters against a flat table of information.  To 
get a little more real-world, I should tell you the idea is that this 
interface will offer users a choice of several pre-defined views (which 
are created using whatever/however in a backend that's not known), so 
the user picks one of those and effectively has access to one flattened 
summary set of data.  So we're not going to have this user making joins 
or creating table relationships or whatever, just looking at a flat 
view, and allowing them to filter it if they want.

I want to make sure the user can filter that data in as simple or 
complex a manner as he or she needs.  A system like this needs to be 
able to store criteria in boolean relationships with precedence 
grouping, so it could record structures like "(criteria_A and 
criteria_B) or (criteria_C and criteria_D)", etc.  As long as we can 
track simple boolean operators (basically and|or) and record correct 
precedence groupings for combinations of those operators (basically, 
putting the parentheses in the right places), then we can create filters 
of unlimitted complexity.

You can see this is a kind of generic discussion. By that I mean that 
the format or content of "criteria_A" or "criteria_B" would depend 
heavily on the backend system, whether it's a particular database server 
product or some custom parser that applies criteria agains flat-file 
data or XML files or whatever.  (For example, if we're talking PHP/SQL 
here, the filter described above would amount to something like "where 
($criteria_A and $criteria_B) or ($criteria_C and $criteria_D)".)

The application of course has to figure out whether the criteria are 
valid, help the user enter valid criteria, etc., and it also has to be 
responsible for creating the views in the first place, and applying that 
filter, etc.  But I think the actual process of tracking these nested 
filter criteria will 1) be a good context for discussion of heirarchical 
data structures, and 2) result in a reusable structure that could be 
applied in any filtering system, regardless of the data backend or type 
of data.

This is not such a bad idea, but it requires me (or whatever admin) to 
create the filters ahead of time and offer them to the user.  Hopefully 
I can come up with a structure that allows for recording whatever 
filters the user can come up with based on the existing columns in the 
flat data view.

Sorry if I didn't explain myself well in the beginning. I think right 
now it's really just about defining the best structure for storing 
filter criteria and the criteria's relationships to each other.  If we 
can do that we have a method that could be useful in numerous different 
systems.  Isn't that right?

"inappropriate"?? I think you NEED to Re-Read the posters original post... Scroll down and read the 'advertisement' at the bottom of this persons spam post.

My questioning of it's validaty was based on the fact that at the end of it it said something about "Stitch & Bitch", which I believe to be derragatory, hence I thought the post to be spam. Get your facts straight before you start gender wars on the php list. No one is out to get you.

I think it might be a good idea to let sewfastseweasy know of the 
misunderstanding since you took it upon yourself to speak for the 
rest of the list and  basically tell sewfastseweasty they were not 
welcome here.

Not at all.  You can provide pre-defined filters if you like, or fall back
to system-generated pseudo-names when the user is just typing in criteria.

To validate the criteria, you need a data dictionary.  To make the
validation completely simple, you need to specify the criteria entirely in
atomic values, and not allow parsable expressions.

Actually, your comment is inappropriate:

1. What you found offensive in Edward's post is exactly what he is 
questioning. In other words, he also found the phrase alarming and is 
asking whether the post is legitimate. Because he had the same reaction 
as you, you've chosen to personally attack him. Personal attacks are not 
tolerated here.

2. Your generalization is exactly the type of offensive remark that you 
mistakenly thought Edward had made. This is blatant hypocrisy and a step 
(or several steps) in the wrong direction.

For the record, "Stitch and Bitch" seems legitimate:

http://www.sewfastseweasy.com/stitch.html

Most of the people there (mostly women) seem to "get it" and realize 
that it's an informal, funny reference to sewing and chatting.

No, you've come to the right place, although you might want to try to

Susan misunderstood the purpose of the phrase "Stitch and Bitch" in your

Hope that helps.

Sure - the more rows, the more time it takes to do updates.  Keep in mind,
however, that while a lot of rows may need to be touched, it's lightweight.
The only operation is an update of an integer - based on an integer
constraint.

As Snyder mentioned, we were just discussing this after last week's meeting.
Partitioning can help dramatically, but what if those types of features
aren't available?  Well, while the update of many rows may seem to be a big
hit, I'd much rather do that than recursive queries, especially in deep
trees.

As Roland points out, for huge tree structures, it's better done outside of
SQL.  SQL isn't well suited for describing complex tree structures, but NSM
has been the most versatile, robust and fastest implementation I've seen.
I've had test trees with well over 100k rows and no problems.

The 80/20 rule applies here - for the majority of tree implementations in
SQL, NSM is the elegant solution.  If you're maintaining giant structures,
however, then a relational database probably isn't the right choice anyway.
But NSM solves the common problem of trees in your typical php/mysql/web
environment.

Absolutely - it's bad and sloppy.  Version B is creating notices (because
PHP first would try to interpret first_name as a constant) but you won't see
them unless you have E_ALL as your error reporting level.  This is an
instance of PHP being "nice" by second guessing what the code actually
means.

Agreed, it's a matter of preference.  There was a time in PHP when using
double quotes resulted in extra overhead because of some bug.  I don't
remember all the details, but as I remember this has been long corrected (I
believe by Andi).

Personally, I prefer Version A because it's easier to read.  I've never been
a fan of breaking strings up into a lot of concatenations with the period.

Never sure but this smells like spam.... I just turned down a request to 
"ninja market" a web service doing this. The client spec was a perfect 
fit (although it was a different product):

- locate up to 100 mailing lists of open source programers or hackers
- post an inquiry looking for "anything similar" to our product, and use 
the URL provided
- make an "in search of" post looking for anything better than our 
product. Use URL below.
- be sure to mention the features marked "A" and optionally those marked "B"
- you may deviate of course from the suggestions but do not mention 
items D or E
- save initial post and subsequent posts to same thread, or parallel 
threads if datestamped after initial post and discussing our product. 
You get credit for them all.


I wish people would understand than SEO is not "spamming" because I seem 
to get 10 requests to spam for every request for optimization. With the 
latest Google update it seems things will only get worse.

My apologies if Josh was *not* spamming the list... I tried to make this 
post demonstrative, because it is so much like list spam.

Actually, your comment is inappropriate:

1. What you found offensive in Edward's post is exactly what he is
questioning. In other words, he also found the phrase alarming and is
asking whether the post is legitimate. Because he had the same reaction
as you, you've chosen to personally attack him. Personal attacks are not
tolerated here.

2. Your generalization is exactly the type of offensive remark that you
mistakenly thought Edward had made. This is blatant hypocrisy and a step
(or several steps) in the wrong direction.

For the record, "Stitch and Bitch" seems legitimate:

http://www.sewfastseweasy.com/stitch.html

Most of the people there (mostly women) seem to "get it" and realize
that it's an informal, funny reference to sewing and chatting.

I wrote it with my own little spam free fingers. I have a pro

but it seemed like there must be something similar in the open source 
world. And if not a perfect fit, I'd happily contribute time/money to 
bring it along.

Hey Folks:

I've installed FreeBSD on my laptop.  I've compiled Apache with mod_ssl.  
When I go to http://localhost/, we're good.  But when I try to do 
https://localhost/, I get a connection refused error.

I set up the test cert using "localhost" as the domain name.

The only change I made to httpd.conf is setting ServerName to "localhost".

The logs are below:

Dan,

This could be a lot of things, but since you say you didn't make any 
modifications to httpd.conf this would be my first guess... do you have 
this in there?

<IfDefine SSL>
Listen 80
Listen 443
</IfDefine>

And started w/ apachectl startssl ?

Your SSL config might be in an <IfDefine SSL> block...  If so, make sure
you start it with the "-D SSL" options to define that var at startup.
Some apache init scripts have a "start" (w/o -D SSL) and a "startssl"
(w/ -D SSL) if you're using one... I can't say what the FreeBSD default
setup is though.

HTH,
Andrew

Hans (or anyone) you can contact me off-list if this is too basic a
question, but what are the other ways to store tree structures outside
of SQL?

Okay, this is not a direct answer to 'ways to store trees'
But this page:
http://www.nist.gov/dads/terms2.html
has information about ways to do lots of things...

There you go. Spammers are achieving perfection; mimicking you. Take it 
as a compliment ;-)

As for galleries, I can't stop and look at the one you posted, but 
ZenPhoto is in beta (that's Photostack revisited). http://www.zenphoto.org/

I've worked with http://pixelpost.org/ Pixelpost and minigal 
http://www.minigal.dk with good results.

Hey guys,

I came accross a script called handshake it is a social networking
application, once i registered i noticed they had the ability for you to
import your gmail contacts so that you could easilly invite people to the
site by using your gmail contacts. Has anyone see how to read a list from
your contacts on gmail? This site asked for your gmail username/password
then would reach out and grab your lost of contacts for use on the site. Has
anyone seen anything pre-made that will do this or is this something i will
have to make myself ;)

Grab an RSS parser and a Gmail account and get to it.

On the whole, GMail is RSS enabled throughout, so you can grab feeds
of current messages, contacts, label contents, etc.

There is also a handy export function within the GMail Contacts
interface (upper right). From the GUI:

"Export Contacts
Export your contacts so you can transfer them to other accounts or
save them offline.
We will export all of your contacts in the CSV file format (Comma
Separated Values).   Learn more
Gmail CSV (for import into another Gmail account)
Outlook CSV (for import into Outlook clients)"

What more would you need?

Maybe it's just me, but on my gmail I don't see any "export"
feature... not anywhere... though I'd like too, .-)

i do see the export feature however trying to figure out how to link
directly so that it returned the csv i have been unable to figure out.

as for the RSS i have not looked into that yet. Although using php on my
site to remotely grab a csv file would be perfect.

I am not looking to export from within my browser while looking at my gmail
account, i am trying to do this behind the scenes from my website.

Hmmm.

I click Contacts, and in the upper right above my List of Contacts I
see Import and Export links. Granted, the Export link is marked "New!"
so maybe this isn't rolled out completely.

i have found libgmailer and gmail-lite, libgmailer allows me to grab my
contacts, it shows exactly how to grab them, must use cookies etc.. and curl
to fetch them ;) Maybe i will write my own maybe i will just use this
library ;)

Just as a follow-up: I think this discussion and the few days it's taken 
to transpire have led me to believe that, on the original question of 
data structure for nested filter criteria, my basic idea in the 
beginning was right: this is clearly a heirarchical relationship. But 
after digging more on the nested set model (reference recent thread 
"database performance"), I think I should be using that model rather 
than trying to tie records back to their parent nodes with a "parentID" 
column.  Thanks to Ken and others for ideas on the interface and 
management of those filters.

In Gentoo Linux we have to activate SSL by using the parameter "-D SSL"
which is set in /etc/conf.d/apache2.  I would think it would be close if
not the same in BSD, since it is an apache configuration issue.

If there is a place where you turned on PHP, that is where you turn on
SSL, so that in my /ect/conf.d/apache2 I also have to set "-D PHP5"

Subject: [nycphp-talk] htaccess/php question
Message-ID: <s366216b.060@webmail.sussex.edu>

Hi All,

Trying to get a single .htm file in one directory parsed by PHP using htaccess in the directory. Powers that be won't let me use a .php extension. Can't seem to get it going. Don't want it parsing in lower directories.  This is what I have in the htaccess file in the folder I want the file to be parsed:

<Files "C:/apache/Apache/blablabla/test.htm">
AddType application/x-httpd-php .htm .html 
</Files>

This is what I have in the httpd.conf file:

<Directory C:/apache/Apache/blablabla/test.htm">
     Options All
     AllowOverride All
</Directory>

Been googling & reading the htaccess manual but at a loss.

TIA,

Jessica

Jessica,

Unfortunately the Files directive only operates on the basename of the 
file, so in your case the directive would be:

<Files "test.htm">
   AddType application/x-httpd-php .htm
</Files>

You could also use the ForceType directive instead of AddType, like so:

<Files "test.htm">
   ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Files>

This is probably the best way to do what you're after.

Hi there:

Honestly, I'm posting this before I've completely exhausted my 
troubleshooting options, but I figured someone might be bored enough 
to beat me to it.

I have a select element for which I need to return multiply selected 
items to PHP.  In other words, I guess it has to have the name 
'something[]', with brackets.

However, I also need to add options to the select list via 
javascript, but it seems like the addition of the brackets makes the 
form element name invalid, by javascript's standards, since you 
access attributes of objects with brackets (i.e., JavaScript can't 
see an element named 'something[]').

It looks like I'm going to have to use the select list to just 
display the options to the user, but really use DOM to dynamically 
add hidden form elements to the form which hold the values I need, as 
a nasty workaround, but I was wondering if anyone else had any silver 
bullet for this.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] pretty-print / parse sql
Message-ID: <43669763.9070006@polymerdb.org>

Hi All,

Does anyone know of an existing (open-source) PHP library that will
pretty-print sql statements?  I'm looking into phpMyAdmin code, and it
doesn't seem such a mess as I might make myself, but if there's
something that could work for this out-of-th-box, I'd much rather use it
than decipher and re-assemble phpMyAdmin for my own use.

I googled around for and found several programs to parse sql statements,
but none in PHP.  Seems like this is something people would use...

Thanks,
Allen

Maybe getElementById() can help.

I've had success with PEAR::Text_Highlighter in the past, it has a 
pretty robust parsing engine and plenty of flexibility.

There are a couple of ways I know of to work around this problem.

1. Set your form up like:

<select name="myselect[]" id="myselect" multiple="multiple">
   <option ...
</select>

The you can access it in javascript via:

document.getElementById('myselect')

2. Use javascript on the onsubmit action of the form to dynamically 
rewrite the names of multiple select boxes.

Personally I tend to use 1, and it seems to work ok.

just an FYI to anyone this has driven crazy ... as it did me for quite some time.

you can pass it to a javascript function this way (where elementname is the name of the select list)
this.form['elementname[]']

you HAVE to select all the items on the submit() if you want them to come across in the POST, otherwise you will end up without that post element, which becomes phase 2 of driving yourself crazy.

Hey, thanks much, y'all.

I thought I had properly tried accessing them in quotes, but there 
was one place I had missed it.

And, getElementByID is probably a better way, anyway.  I need to get 
my mind into the new 'DOM' way of thinking; I learned JavaScript back 
in the - eeek - '90s.

Cheers,

Yes, It looks pretty robust and quite flexible.  Will look into it more.

I've been known to get quite carried away with naming form elements as
nested arrays, often dynamically generated, and have found that using the
elements[] property of the form object works best for me. To access the
elements of the form named 'example_form'

<form action='x.php' name='example_form' method='post'>
<input type='hidden' name='userdata[hidden_group_1][first]' value='one'>
<input type='hidden' name='userdata[hidden_group_1][second]' value='two'>
<input type='hidden' name='userdata[hidden_group_2][third]' value='three'>
<input type='hidden' name='userdata[hidden_group_2][fourth]' value='four'>
</form>

use a javascript like

document.example_form.elements['userdata[hidden_group_2][third]'].value

How many times did you run your test?  Things vary between requests.
