David:

Nothing enhances clarity better than familiarity.

True, the answer was noted in the PHP Cookbook on page 120, but the 
point was that I remembered it. I have literally scores of different 
programming books which I read time and time again. Each time, I 
learn and remember something new -- AND where I read it. My books are 
filled with sticky notes sticking out of the pages with dozens of 
things I want to remember.

Even with this list -- every time someone post a routine or a snip-it 
of code to solve a problem, I copy, make an index for it, catalog it, 
list who said it (that's important), and sometimes even make a 
working example so I can reference it later when I run into the same 
problem. I have hundred's or working examples as my reference.

Sure, it's a lot of hard work, but it's necessary if you're going to 
be good at what you do. No profession is easy and what you know, is 
what you sell.

Like the old mechanic who was brought a car that didn't run right. He 
listened to the engine and took a hammer and hit it. Suddenly the 
engine ran like it was new. The customer asked &quot;How much do I owe 
you?&quot; To which the mechanic said &quot;A hundred bucks!&quot; The customer 
replied &quot;That's a lot of money just to hit an engine with a hammer.&quot; 
The mechanic replied &quot;No, that only cost a buck -- it was knowing 
where to hit it that cost the most.&quot;

Cheers,

tedd
