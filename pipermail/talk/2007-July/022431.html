Yes, I took it as a playful response to my mistake, I laughed :)

Thanks to everyone who has responded so far, I was thinking of looking at
CakePHP already so this is just more reason to do so.

I think more of my problem is when I see potential objects, I see more code,
and more work to accomplish the same goal.

I think when I said PHP5 in my previous post, I really meant OOP.  I can
switch to PHP5 without using OOP, which isn't my problem.  It's more
migrating toward the OOP approach to web development.  My problem is as of
now, when I see a task, and I think of how to do it with objects, I see more
code and more obstacles than just placing it in the file (not even
necessarily a function), and more work, for nice, but not essential
benefits.

Someone I develop with created a good User class that I've been looking at,
and I feel that's a good example of something to use an object for.  Other
examples that I could look into would be very helpful.

</I>&gt;<i> You're getting good advice from others already on the OOP questions.
</I>&gt;<i> It's time to move on from PHP4, and rebuilding a site sounds like the
