So you want to make a user interface using PHP that creates an account 
on your mail server. Right? In that case, I wonder why you need MySQL...

OK, so for which mail server do you want to create the user interface? 
Or do I still not get it?


&gt;<i> Also Mr. David suspected that is this a minor project and wondered why 
</I>&gt;<i> not its  a major project !!
</I>&gt;<i> So well, this is really a minor project as there is nothing special

</I>
So, if it is nothing special, why do you ask for help?

&gt;<i> Also someone asked to share the degree i will be getting upon completing 
</I>&gt;<i> my graduation !!
</I>&gt;<i> So well, i would always like to share it with NYPHP ....
</I>&gt;<i> I would awarded the degree of ------  Bachelor of technology  (B.Tech)

I think that was just a clever way of telling you that if it is your 
study project you are expected to figure it out / learn about it 
yourself rather than to ask others for the solution. So, is it really 
the same like a BS from a US university? 3/4th of the courses are like 
history, language, and sports and only 1/4th is about your major? 
&lt;/exaggeration&gt;

Regardless of that, I for my part don't have any reservations against 
helping you out. I don't even want half or your degree or such. But, 
before I speculate any longer, first create clear specifications.
1. What is this gizmo supposed to do in general?*
2. Which tools do you want / have to use?
3. What are all the other prerequisits and limitations?
4. What are the individual functions you need to implement?
5. How are the individual functions supposed to work?
6. What is the required input and expected output of each of these 
functions?

* Describe this without stating &quot;has to work like GMail&quot; or similar 
comparisons that are not nutritious at all. I have no clue how GMail 
works, I only know that it works.

If you have written detailed and revised answers to all these questions 
80% of your work is done. The remaining 20% are 10% for coding and 10% 
for documenting your code. I have no problem in helping you with the 10% 
of the coding to the best of my abilities (which aren't that great, 
sorry), the rest of it is your task.

So, and with that I already did 5% of the first 80% for you. Here is 
your plan of action, get working...at least this is how I got my 
technician certification as well as my BSEE and MSTM degrees.

David
