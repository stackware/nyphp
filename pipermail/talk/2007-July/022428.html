<PRE>I think the announcement of end of life for PHP4 should be enough to  
move on to PHP5.

As per why OO is beneficial I think it would be best to @ least look  
at one of the major frameworks out there, either CakePHP, Symfony,  
Joolma, etc and see how they are built since it is a good case of how  
code reuse and not just using OO but extending OO is extremely time  
saving.  Personally it sounds like you would benefit from learning  
MVC and just running with it.  Also most of today's frameworks  
already have structures in place for where to place items like models  
(Article, CodeSnippet, etc) and other content, another benefit I think.

Another good part ... people are sharing much of what they write w/  
them (<A HREF="http://bakery.cakephp.org">http://bakery.cakephp.org</A>).  I also think PHP5 is better for  
test driven and behavior driven development which I think will become  
another must have.

</I>&gt;<i> Here's my problem : I don't see how using php5 and oop would really

</I>&gt;<i> and all
</I>&gt;<i> that.  So I'm going to put the areas of my site here, and see how  
</I>&gt;<i> you guys
</I>&gt;<i> would build objects for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have these sections:

</I>&gt;<i> Tutorials

</I>&gt;<i> About Me
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At first glance, I thought to object-ify the portfolio section,  
</I>&gt;<i> where each
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;project&quot; would be an object.  But other than that, I don't see  
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere on
</I>&gt;<i> the site to use objects, and I could easily do that without objects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to expand my resume by being able to say that I have done  
</I>&gt;<i> OOP in
</I>&gt;<i> php5, as I see on the jobs list that that is what employers are  
</I>&gt;<i> looking for
</I>&gt;<i> (at least quite a few are).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, I was wondering what your suggestions are for php5 and  
</I>&gt;<i> oop, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't need an oop introduction or anything like that, I'd just like  
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> examples of how using objects would make the site better and how to
</I>&gt;<i> structure them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance,
