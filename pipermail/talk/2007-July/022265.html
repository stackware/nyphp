<PRE>&gt;<i> I am in no position to correct you, but isn't it that PHP talks to MySQL 
</I>&gt;<i> rather then the HTTP client? As far as MySQL is concerned, the 
</I>&gt;<i> connection comes from where the PHP interpreter is located. And since 
</I>&gt;<i> each connection from PHP to MySQL gets named sufficiently uniquely I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess that PHP can keep multiple clients apart. Normally one opens a 
</I>&gt;<i> connection, runs the queries, and then closes it. I always make sure 
</I>&gt;<i> that I explicitly close the connection, but after reading the 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation a script end will close the connection as well. Seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> be quite different from opening files, which stay open and locked even 
</I>&gt;<i> after the script is done.
</I>&gt;<i> It may just be that PHP uses only one persistent connection and feeds 
</I>&gt;<i> all the queries through that one regardless of client (but returns the 
</I>&gt;<i> values back to the script instance from where the query came), which is 
</I>&gt;<i> what you suspect. Unless someone who really knows what is going on comes 
</I>&gt;<i> forward we can only resort to speculation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will give it a try and see what happens. It's only adding a &quot;p&quot;. Since 
</I>&gt;<i> the mysql_close doesn't do any thing on persistent connections there is 
</I>&gt;<i> no harm in leaving it in - or so the theory goes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see a problem with my current project as this one will never be 
</I>&gt;<i> used by more than a few dozen clients at a time, but I have other 
</I>&gt;<i> projects where some optimization may be more than just OK.
</I>&gt;<i>

Exactly that's what I tried telling you :-D. Of course the HTTP Client 
(=user) does not connect to mysql it's the PHP script, but the PHP 
script gets executed when the client makes a request and regardless how 
many requests he makes the PHP Script/Mysql does not know that this user 
has already been here. That's what I wanted to tell you as I thought 
that you thought that persistent connections mean that for every user a 
new connection is opened and that each connection corresponds to a user 
and is kept open for e.g. 30 minutes, but that's not true.

Anyway, it seems to mean that you got it now and that's actually 
everything that counts.
