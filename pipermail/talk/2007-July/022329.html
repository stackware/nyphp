<PRE>Hey Again,

There's been a ton of great comments...I realize that the questions and 
tactics
I used in this interview session may not have been the best, but I have 
learned
a lot through this process, and look forward to doing it again in the 
future.

Someone mentioned asking the candidate to write a solution to a problem
then walk me through their code ... I like this, and I've had to do it in 
the past.
Actually, they just took the source code and told me they would get back to 
me.

I guess I wasn't 100% sure what types of questions would be appropriate, 
since
this is an intern position, and I don't except too much language specific 
knowledge.

I do expect..er want, a smart, hard working person.

&quot;My books are filled with sticky notes sticking out of the pages with dozens 
of
things I want to remember.&quot;
heh, mine too!

&quot;Someone who aces a programming test because they have memorized a manual is 
non necessarily a good problem solver.&quot;

Very true.

&quot;Write an algorithm (not language specific code) to do the following:&quot;

That's a good idea ... I may give more thought as too what I will ask as a 
problem
solving question in the future. I'll probably do a bit of googling to see 
what
others have asked, and been asked.

&quot;BTW, I personally think swapping the contents of two variables without a
temporary variables proves nothing.&quot;

True, I guess I just like to see how quickly, and what way, they solve the 
problem.
*Any* problem will do I suppose.

Thanks again for all the feedback, its been a pleasure reading the replies.

- Ben

&gt;&gt;<i> Your first instinct, make a copy and then reassign the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> values, is a straightforward way to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that using xor isn't a very straightforward solution, but I do
</I>&gt;<i> like to look for creative, clever solutions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $foo = $foo + $bar;
</I>&gt;<i> $bar = $foo - $bar;
</I>&gt;<i> $foo = $foo - $bar;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I'm hiring. :-)
