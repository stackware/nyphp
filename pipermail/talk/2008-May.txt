David,

I'm sorry I had only given you an enterprise resource (although you can 
run BlueDragon with localhost access only for free). Here is a fantastic 
community resource, that will allow you to really stress test that CF 
app: http://www.railo-technologies.com/en/index.cfm?treeID=149
Some Javaheads like me think that this is even better than BlueDragon.

Although I'm still a huge fan of CF8, as it has introduced inherent PHP 
and Ruby support:

Fascinating. You thought tag soup was fun, now you can have multi-lingual

Pardon me for saying this, but there must be a reason why PHP has so 
much more of a "market share", when it comes to picking a 
platform/language for web development, than does Cold Fusion?  ... 

Not sure what the exact percentages are or why PHP is so much more 
widely used, but the situation is what it is.

I don't know anything about CF but I know it's still considered to be
a good product. So if there's no overwhelming technical reason to
choose one language over the other, I'm partial to the idea that you
should use what your personnel are good at. So if you think one team
has better cred and skills, I would go with them. Just make sure you
ask some technical questions and don't get duped if their skills are
going to be the tie breaker. There area lot of smooth talkers out
there.

Message-ID: <BLU126-W4449AF472CB0C06E24C438E8DB0@phx.gbl>


I need to run php to get street from mysql database.Then test the street variable in javascriptif street is emty,javascript will pop up alert window
 
Here are my thoughts:
 
<?php
//connection to server,database
$q = "select street from apt where username = '$user'";$result = mysql_query($q) or die(mysql_error());while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){  $street=$row['street']; }?>
<script LANGUAGE="JavaScript">st=<?=$street?>;if(st) alert("miss street");
</script>
 
Can I run st=<?=street?> in javascript?I'm not sure here.
 
Thanks!

Kristina,

If you're not sure what the market share is, why even comment; again, 
I'm concerned by your lack of scholarship; but you're pardoned.

http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html

http://lui.arbingersys.com/index.html

Keep in mind that the TIOBE index is based on several assumptions, which 
i think are erroneous:
http://blog.timbunce.org/2008/04/12/tiobe-or-not-tiobe-lies-damned-lies-and-statistics/

Keep in mind that Coldfusion is JAVA, and results from the above indexes 
could very well be overlapping. Whatever-the-case, there is no real 
measure of current 'market share' done in a formalized (going to each 
shop, in a standard way, and asking what they use) and complete (not 
leaving-out Government and Healthcare facilities) fashion.

Although it seems there is more 'content' and information revolving 
around the string 'PHP' (and/or 'PHP Programming')
It's most likely due to the fact that PHP is OpenSource. So the 'market 
share' you may be personally perceiving is most likely rooted to an 
abundance of documentation/information, and not actual lines of 
code/real-world usage; hence not an actual measure of true market share.

If you're grouping results from MySQL, you should definitely look into using
the built in MySQL date/time functions first. The database will pretty much
always be better at grouping, filtering and organizing your data than code
would be.

The date function page is here:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/date-and-time-functions.html

But since you're not grouping by hours on the hour, but hours on the half
hour, I'd suggest writing a MySQL function to do that grouping for you, then
call that in your query. More info on functions:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-procedure.html

You might actually be able to search out some functions that others have
written that do similar things, since it doesn't seem like you're trying to
do something that nobody else has ever done.

Almost... that will produce the following:

st=123 abcd ave;

what you want is

var st = '123 abcd ave';
if(st === '') alert("miss street");

You also need to take care of escaping issues: what if the street name
is O'henry st?
then you would have
var st = '123 O'henry st'; // invalid javascript.

I  always use JSON to send data to javascript because it automatically
handles escaping and is much more flexible.  If you are not familiar
with JSON, it'll be worth your while to do a bit of reading.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ColdFusion vs PHP (Ruby, Perl....)
Message-ID: <1209662956.30403@coral.he.net>

Ed --

My comment was solely intended to offer the theory that there is a 
reason why PHP has so much more of a market share overall than does 
Cold Fusion -- whatever that reason might be, and to solicit comments 
therein from the other people who post to this list as to what that 
reason may be.  


My impression on the much larger market share is primarily based on the 
fact that there are a lot more people looking to hire PHP programmers 
than there people looking to hire Cold Fusion programmers.  Therefore, 
more companies must be using PHP.

[Not only do I have 12 years as a consultant (with the concommitant 
huge volume of time perusing job postings and answering RFPs), but I 
have 3 years as a recruiter/account manager in the tech field and an 
abundant knowledge of the job market in tech, and who is looking for 
what, what companies are using what platforms, and etc. -- is this data 
not "relevant" or "scholarly" enough for your taste?]  

With all due respect,

Kristina

But you  are assuming your conclusion in your premise Kristina.

"PHP has so much more of a market share overall than does Cold Fusion"

You need to prove that before anyone, including members of this list, 
can even begin to look for 'the reason'.
In other words you can't ask:
"Why does PHP have a larger market share than Coldfusion?"
Unless you can demonstrate that it does.
You may 'feel' that is true, or even 'think' that it is, but that is 
poor (and emotional) scholarship.
Show us some links. Give us some data. Prove that PHP "has so much more 
of a market share overall", don't just declare it.

Now that's getting better, but what is your 'impression' based on.
It's my impression that I see as many Coldfusion offers floating around 
as I do PHP.
I believe that is most likely because I subscribe to both a PHP and a 
Coldfusion jobs-list.however, I wouldn't say that I can deduce from that 
information which language is being used more, and actually holding more 
of the market.
How do you know "there are a lot more people looking to hire PHP 
programmers"?
And what if "a lot more people looking to hire PHP programmers", are 
doing so because they are migrating FROM it, or translating it?

As long as the PHP occurs before the script it should be just fine. 
Just got doing a tie in of PHP and Javascript for Google Maps that way.

I ran into this issue too, what I ended up doing was using the  
XMLHttpRequest in JavaScript to call my PHP script, which after  
getting the data from the database, it caches the data in an array.  
so on subsequent call, used in a mouseOver(), it grabs the info from  
the array.

So First my JavaScript runs on mouseOver.
It checks the array, if defined then it uses that value, if not then  
I hit the php code.
After that it sets the value of the array to the data I just got and  
then it's local until they user goes to another page anyway.

Ed, I agree, it would be great if we could find some methodology that 
could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt on an empirical basis that PHP 
is a more popular platform than Cold Fusion.  I can't adequately defend 
my contention to your exacting standards at the present moment, because 
you're right, I don't have the data.  But I believe that the data is 
gatherable and that my theory is valid. 

So anyone have any ideas how to do that, links, information, empirical 
studies, etc. etc & etc ... bring 'em on.

We could do an empirical analysis of job postings on 10 or so general 
tech job boards over a time period of a year...?

PS Ed, your own link to the TIOBE website showed that they listed Cold 
Fusion at the bottom of the popularity grid...and PHP was in the top 
half.  But you're saying that you have "problems with their 
methodology", OK.  But you can have problems with any methodology or  
means of proof, and that in and of itself is an emotional 
response...based on your beliefs and temperament...and btw there's 
nothing wrong with that! :=]

I mean let's face it, people have "proved beyond doubt" all sorts of 
things which flat out ain't so, right?

I do too. But I would like it quantified as well.

I believe this to be a straw man.
I never said I had "problems with their methodology". I said "which i 
think are erroneous", and logically so.
I posted a link to the 2 illogical assumptions that support the TIOBE

I will clearly list them here, as it seems you didn't follow that link 
(poor scholarship):
# that the number of search engine hits for the phrase ?/foo/ programming? 
is proportional to the ?popularity? of that language.
# that the proportionality /is the same for different languages/.
It is therefore logically unsound to deduce that the TIOBE indexes are 
correct in a truly accurate esteem.
All they are graphing reduces to search engine results, and nothing more.

I'm not sure what you are looking to express with that (perhaps 
rhetorical?) question.

What would be an example of something "proved beyond doubt" that "flat 
out ain't so"?
(Please refrain from listing some historic event of ignorance, such as 
meat becoming maggots or the Earth being flat. We are discussing a 
comparison of actual market holding betwixt two modern programming 
languages. Feel free to respond off list.)
<XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX>

In fact, there is not a clearly quantified amount of conclusive 
information to accurately deduce that PHP (or any other language) holds 
this or that particular portion of the 'market'. Therefore, to propose 
we find a 'reason' for PHP holding the majority of the 'market share', 
is pure nonsense, as we do not know that PHP holds such a portion. We 
may as well propose to find a reason for which Coldfusion holds the 
largest share of the market, or Python, or Flex, or Java, or COBOL...

Perhaps this thread may be a catalyst to develop a better means of 
accurately surveying language utilization in a granular fashion.

Would this work for quantifying PHP usage:

http://www.php.net/usage.php

Now find that CF usage link and compare the two.

Ed,

Hi again.  Let me try to clarify what I was trying to say.  I'm 
enjoying this stimulating discussion on a lovely spring day when, let's 
face it, it's hard to keep focused on work.

By saying that things can be proven that "ain't so" ... I was referring 
not specifically to CS/IT related things but to so many cases 
of "research" that are designed to support a contention that may not be 
true but that certain people have an interest in "proving"...which may 
not be relevant to what we are discussing, granted.  (As an example, 
many studies that "proved" during the 40s and 50s that smoking and 
radiation were not bad for your health!)  By which I meant to point out 
that the methodology used to "prove" something is what is important, 
that that methodology needs to be correct and accurate, or we 
haven't "proven" anything -- GIGO in other words.  

And I completely 100% agree that "search engine results" are not an 
accurate measurement of language/platform popularity (and agree that 
the TIOBE indexes, if based on that alone, are not accurate).  It seems 
to me that the only way to measure this is to get some kind of 
adequately sized sampling of what companies are actually using for 
their development.

Ed,

I think you are being a bit harsh.  Kristina's initial comment was
along the lines of "PHP is more popular than cold fusion, and that
should count for something in weighing the decision".  You then
replied to a casual comment with a grating and largely ad hominem
response.

It appears you have a lot to add to this discussion, but I would
prefer to read it minus the remarks on others' "scholarship".

-John C.

This looks really interesting, but they say that

"In the April 2008 survey we received responses from 165,719,150 sites. 
Most of this month's growth of 3.1 million sites is seen in the US, 
with Google's Blogger service alone adding 1.1 million extra sites."

But the graph below says that total active sites (red line) number 
slightly more than 66,400,000 ...?

Are they including inactive sites in their number of +/- 20 million 
sites using PHP?  If so how would that affect the accuracy of this 
survey? (i.e. if someone goes out and buys a domain, then replies to 
this survey saying "we are going to use PHP" but never actually does 
so...?)

John -- 

I do believe that the popularity of PHP should be a factor in a 
decision making process.  Not to say that someone should choose a 
language or platform just because everyone else is...but if everyone is 
choosing it, there might be a really good reason or two why.

What I wanted to do was get a discussion going on why it's so 
popular...i.e. it's free, it has a great developer community, it's got 
powerful features for developing web applications, it's well documented 
and flexible, it's FREE...and etc.   

That way someone looking into using it can see the benefits, and make 
up their own mind.

Yours in empirical correctness, 

Kristina :)

I can't seem to locate enough detailed information on the basis for that 
PHP usage graph to comment.
But I would think it silly, were there to be a Graph showing PHP 
declining steadily, on the PHP site. =D

That would be a good laugh in itself right there.  Woe, look at our

Well, that's very big of you -- Webmaster.

She at least admitted that she didn't know. What did you do other 
than to cite references you don't agree with, provide no answer to 
the question, and insult another programmer?

If I cared, I would be concerned by your lack of professionalism.

Cheers,

Tedd,

If you don't care, then why even give your two cents?
I think you're baiting me into some sort of pointless "I'm more 
professional than you" argument, and I'm not going to bite.

Maybe you should ask Kristina if she feels insulted, instead of 
chauvinistically projecting your perception unto her.

-Ed

You may "bite" or not, I don't care. But I do care about how we 
(professional programmers) treat each other. Take my comments to 
heart, or don't. Typically, people who help others do so with grace. 
Those who don't usually have issues of their own to deal with. You 
project the persona you want.

I did and then I responded to you -- so your assumption otherwise is 
as wrong as the rest of the comments you've made.

Look, I'm not trying to start anything -- I'm just saying insults 
accomplish nothing and are certainly not professional.

Cheers,

tedd

What's the topic, Hans? How to build your own Twitter or how to blame
your embarrassing outages on a framework?

Either one would be interesting and of potential use to our members.

I vote for how to blame. Framework.  Definitely the most useful for my customers.

Or how RoR is a fad? *duck*  :)

Apparently, this might actually all be a rumor:

Although in either case, there is apparently some confusion over at twitter as to what technology they'd like to use.

I think it's been confirmed as a rumor at this point.

Still, was interesting to talk about. I was at Jelly NYC (a co-working
group) this morning and the news item was inspiring a little
discussion. Rails is definitely popular here in NYC with the startup
crowd, but I still believe it's something of a fad.

I have serious doubts that the ActiveRecord idea can ever be made to 
scale or perform.

ActiveRecord?

As in selecting all fields and updating all fields no matter what you 
need/what has changed?

scale if you can't easily do set-based operations as well.&nbsp; But as I
said, I am going by what other people say about it, I saw enough to know I
wasn't interested.Also in the second-hand info category, I've heard it said
that Rails is heavily into putting logic into Ruby layer.&nbsp; This leads to
far more round trips to the server than are necessary, and if it is true it be
my first path of investigation if I worked at &quot;Rails Inc&quot; (if you
know what I mean) and were asked to speed it up.Finally, the ActiveRecord
concept is suspicious overall because it attempts to view the database as
objects, and a database plain and simple is not objects, it is organized as
sets.&nbsp; You can only make optimal use of a database if you work with in it
its own terms. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; On Fri, 2 May 2008, Kenneth Downs wrote: &gt;

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Abstracting CSS: Reusable HTML UI Components
Message-ID: <78c6bd860805031857l4f7452f9k67bad7024633dc5a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm exploring the idea of using some PHP classes to emitting reusable
HTML UI elements like postal addresses, login forms, linked images
and in turn more sophisticated elements such as invoices, forum posts,
etc. Because these elements are supposed to be reusable I do not want
to force style information on the user and yet I need to maximize the
ease with which the user can apply their own style to each element.

For example, let's say one of these classes emits some HTML like the
following:

  <table>
  <tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Account Information</h3></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Username:</td><td>abaker</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Email Address:</td><td>abaker at example.com</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Full Name:</td><td>abaker</td></tr>
  </table>

Now let's say I want to change the style of h3 and the field labels but
within this table only. This is basically impossible through CSS alone.

One possibility would be to allow the user to supply a class name that
will be strategically set on some elements like:

  <div class="myapp">
  <table>
  <tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Account Information</h3></td></tr>
  <tr><td class="fieldlabel">Username:</td><td>abaker</td></tr>

Then the user can supply their own CSS like:

  div.myapp h3 {
      color: #000080;
      border-bottom: 2px #808080 solid;

This seems a little clumsy to me but it's the best I can come up with.

If you were given some HTML to be styled with CSS, how would you prefer
the elements be organized?

Secondarily, would you expect a professional library of this type to use
tableless forms? Personally I have never been able to create tableless
forms and have things line up into columns. So for now I'm going to use
tables but I would be very interested in hearing someone make a case
for tableless forms.

Tableless forms are all about the fieldsets and labels.

One sidebar - make sure your id's and field names are different as IE 
tends to confuse the two and reacts strangely.

Google  for "css forms" (sans quotes) and you'll find quite a few 
helpful examples.

As for making a case for css forms, I think the above example speaks for 
itself.  Very easy to see what's going on here without even testing in a 
browser.  Even though I'd coded in tables for years (around 1997 - 
2001), trying to read around table tags these days makes me feel 
completely illiterate when it comes to figuring out what a page is 
supposed to look like.

Good Luck!

As in good or bad? Your label width is fixed at 70px. If I lengthen
the text of one of those labels the form element is displayed right
over the top of it.

Well, the caveat is that the labels won't auto-fit for the whole 
'column', but it's simple to fix by increasing the label width.  I think 
the benefit of cleaner code trumps the auto-resizing the labels.  
Otherwise, you could write a js function that checks the label text and 
resizes them accordingly.  In the end it's a matter of personal style / 
choice, but I'd much rather maintain a tableless layout by adjusting a 
single css file than try to dance around table tags - even if they are 
auto-generated - especially if they're auto-generated since that means 
you have less html to maintain within your php code that generates the html.

This isn't clumsy.  It's exactly what CSS is for.  I'd put the class 
inside the table element, but that's me.

Michael:

It's not clumsy to identify a table -- that part of separating 
content from presentation. It's just another variable to use.

However, if I were creating tables for different things, I might be 
more semantic and use ID's, such as id = "logInForm" rather than 
class="myapp" (whatever that means).

Cheers,

tedd

At this point of uncertainty I've been in the habit of applying style
through divs because they can quietly affect groups of any type of
element without changing the css (e.g. in the above example, the div
applies style to h3 regardless of whether or not it's in a table). If
that style info turns out to be specific to tables of that type then
yes, I agree that it should be on the table. In fact it is very likely
that I will need table classes since tables are frequently used for a
wide range of purposes including page layout, form structure and data
display of different types.

Mike:

Tables should not be used for anything except column data. Using 
tables for layouts is just bad practice and demonstrates a disregard 
for, or ignorance of, accessibility issues.

To style a h3 within a table without a class or id is easy enough by 
simply using

table h3	{style}

Or, don't use h3 at all and use the <th> tag -- after all, it's a 
heading, right? And, it's easy enough to style via

th [style]

Cheers,

tedd

I see. So how does one do layouts without tables? Do you have a simple
example on the web somewhere? Is there a good tutorial I can look at?

Hi everyone --

I'm trying to build out a validation routine for my input forms and 
found something that I like/find easy to extend.  I added it as an 
external script to my test page.  I tested to make sure all the 
subfunctions were being called by inserting alert boxes and they are 
being called.  Unfortunately, the routine is not picking up my 
empty/non valid fields and instead appears to be just returning "true" 
and submitting the form.

It's hard for me to trap the errors because of the fact the function is 
called on submit.  Anyone have any tips or tricks to help me figure out 
why this isn't working?  I'm ashamed to admit it's been awhile since 
I've really done anything serious with JavaScript, and seem to be a bit 
rusty here.


Also just wanted to let everyone know that our migration to Linux 
server was successful and we have finally gotten the mail() function 
working reliably -- apparently this hosting co has some special 
requirements for syntax which they finally shared with us.

My guess is that your javascript has errors which prevents the submit
handler from returning false.  This makes it really hard for
debugging...

Try the following when developing:
<form onsubmit="validate(this);return false;">
instead of
<form onsubmit="return validate(this)">

This way when "validate" errors out, the submission will still be
trapped and you can see the errors in the console.

HTH,

Also: Firebug is your friend.  Just set a breakpoint on the first  
line of your function, and step through.

Rolan,

I found this one that looked very easy to expand at

http://www.webcheatsheet.com/javascript/form_validation.php

However it is not picking up the blank fields...

I can try yours if you point me to it!

I need something that is extensible to handle the various types of 
input like emails, phone numbers, etc.

I thought it used to be fld.length or fld.text.length...??

That's correct Javascript, assuming that fld = 
document.getElementById('the element you are referencing')

it's implicitly referenced, i.e. the name of the element is being 
passed in as an enumerated value assigned to the type of validation 
subroutine I want to call for that element.

But by "by id" i guess that there needs to be an id="sameasname" in 
each form element...?? That could be the issue?

blank fields ?

I must not be understanding this -- doesn't validateEmpty() do that?

Well that's different... if the Javascript is 'looping' over the form 
array as so:

<script language="javascript">
function check(){
fld = document.getElementById('test').value.length ;
alert(fld);
}
function loopForms(){
var frms = document.forms ;
for(a=0;a<frms.length;a++){
alert(frms.item(a).name);
    for(b=0;b<frms.item(a).elements.length;b++){
        frm = frms.item(a);
        alert(frm.elements.item(b).value);       
    }
}
}
</script>

And there isn't a check for the type, then the 'blanks' you're seeing 
are buttons.

ed,

it calls the subfunctions like so:
  reason += validateUsername(theForm.user_name);
  reason += validatePassword(theForm.pwd);
  reason += validateEmail(theForm.email1);
  reason += validatePhone(theForm.phone1);
  reason += validateEmpty(theForm.first_name);

which appears to be OK

Hi everyone -- thanks again for help and just wanted to let you know 
what the issue ended up being.

If a label tag with for= is not used, then name= & id= must both be 
used inside the <INPUT> tag, as Javascript uses id & PHP uses name.

PS special thanks to Tedd for testing the script for me.

Also, I've forwarded this thread to the person who designed the HTML 
forms for this project.

Is there any reason to prefer label tags over using id, or is either 
one fine going forward?

Kristina:

Labels are good for accessibility.

Also, please review:

http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#forms-labels

and if you will note, the W3C uses both label and id in their example.

Can't go too wrong following their lead.

Cheers,

tedd

Amen to that -- Firebug is an immense help. Indispensable, even, if you are
doing Ajax and need to inspect the stuff coming back at you. Too bad FF 2.x
is such a prolifigate hog and waster of memory -- it's really killing me
here on Fedora 7.

My guess is that your javascript has errors which prevents the submit

handler from returning false. ?This makes it really hard for

debugging...



Try the following when developing:

<form onsubmit="validate(this);return false;">

instead of

<form onsubmit="return validate(this)">



This way when "validate" errors out, the submission will still be

trapped and you can see the errors in the console.

Hello,

The ever fashionable mod_rewrite is throwing me for a loop.  Here's the
scenario:

http://something.domain.com -> rewrite -> http://www.domain.com/something

Any pointers/examples on how to do this with mod_rewrite?

Thanks much,

Wouldn't you need to set this up in your virtual hosts file?

Something like this:

I should actually read what you write eh Hans? lol

Try replacing HTTP_REFERER with:
HTTP_HOST or SERVER_ADDRESS

You may want to try something like:

RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} ^(something)\.domain\.com
RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://www.domain.com/%1/$1 [R]

You will also want
[R=301]  instead of [R]

...assuming you care about search engines and want the reputation of
the "something" subdomain to transfer to the "www" domain.

Hello,

My name is Justin Dearing and I am new to this list.

I was told that there was some interest in forming a NYC Postgresql
group. That would be something I would be interested in participating
in. If there is a more appropriate forum for discussing this feel free
to contact me either on or off list.

We have decided to use PgSQL as our main database for our Drupal  
environment.  This group might be of use to me and others on here.  I  
haven't done any research to see what NYC PgSQL groups there are but I  
would cross reference your search with meetup.com.

I've created a mailing list for PostgreSQL.  We've got one for MySQL, so it
actually only seems fair :)

http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/pgsql

If anyone spots any issues, please let me know.

As for meetings, I could help setup some space, however I wouldn't have time
to organize it.  If anyone is interested, though, step up to the plate.
This is how our other SIGs, like Joomla!, has really taken off.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Schema Validation
Message-ID: <4829A7FD.4020207@projectskyline.com>

Hello,

I'm having a lot of trouble getting the dom object schema validation to 
work. After looking on google, it seems there isn't a straight forward 
way to handle
complex schemas.

Take the following code:

        if (is_file($schemaFile))
        {
            $domObj->load($requestXml);
            if (!$domObj->schemaValidate($schemaFile))
            {


load() is throwing a warning:
<b>Warning</b>:  DOMDocument::load() [<a 
href='function.DOMDocument-load'>function.DOMDocument-load</a>]: I/O 
warning : failed to load external entity

And so is the call to schemaValidate()
<b>Warning</b>:  DOMDocument::schemaValidate() [<a 
href='function.DOMDocument-schemaValidate'>function.DOMDocument-schemaValidate</a>]: 
The document has no document element.

My XML struct:

<Template archived="0" id="2" label="Millenium PredictR Template" 
version="1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Meta />
  <Phases>

We have decided to use PgSQL as our main database for our Drupal environment.  This group might be of use to me and others on here.  I haven't done any research to see what NYC PgSQL groups there are but I would cross reference your search with meetup.com.

I've created a mailing list for PostgreSQL.  We've got one for MySQL, so it actually only seems fair :)

http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/pgsql

If anyone spots any issues, please let me know.

As for meetings, I could help setup some space, however I wouldn't have time to organize it.  If anyone is interested, though, step up to the plate.
This is how our other SIGs, like Joomla!, has really taken off.

Hello,

I'm having a lot of trouble getting the dom object schema validation to work. After looking on google, it seems there isn't a straight forward way to handle complex schemas.

Take the following code:

        if (is_file($schemaFile))
        {
            $domObj->load($requestXml);
            if (!$domObj->schemaValidate($schemaFile))
            {


load() is throwing a warning:
<b>Warning</b>:  DOMDocument::load() [<a
href='function.DOMDocument-load'>function.DOMDocument-load</a>]: I/O warning : failed to load external entity

And so is the call to schemaValidate()
<b>Warning</b>:  DOMDocument::schemaValidate() [<a
href='function.DOMDocument-schemaValidate'>function.DOMDocument-schemaValidate</a>]: 
The document has no document element.

My XML struct:

<Template archived="0" id="2" label="Millenium PredictR Template" 
version="1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Meta />
  <Phases>
    <Phase state="development" />
    <Phase state="testing" />
    <Phase state="published">

          <DataPoint name="prepredictr" />
        </DataPointGroup>

This looks to me like its not getting a stream going, or if its local 
acccess  it might be a file permission problem.

You may not not only not have a document element -- you may not have any 
document at all.

Please inform me if this query is mis-directed.

After a year of being away from PHP development I am trying to re-establish
an environment which combines Apache 2.2, Zend Studio 5.5 (including PHP 5)
and the upgraded version of Seagull framework on Windows XP.  I know the
Apache 2.2 layer is working, but something is wrong at the PHP level.  It
appears to be independent of Seagull, because it also affects phpMyAdmin in
the same way (both applications are subs under C:\Program Files\Apache
Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs).  I also know that it is browser
independent having tried it in both Firefox and IE.

An address of localhost/seagull/www brings up the Index of seagull/www which
includes index.php.  However, localhost/seagull/www/index.php does not
execute and display the Seagull entry screen.  The behavior is identical if
I attempt to address phpMyAdmin.

It seems to me that I have a basic setting that is incorrect.  Can anyone
point me toward that?

Phil

Sounds like mod_php isn't installed / configured.  You need to install
and configure the apache php module.  I am not familiar with windows,
but you should be able to figure it out with some googling.  I suspect
it involves moving something like "mod_php5.dll" into an apache
modules folder, editing the apache .conf file to load the module, then
restarting apache.

also make sure that index.php is included in the list of files to serve 
under the DirectoryIndex heading in httpd.conf

The Apache error log, Windows system and application error logs and 
when PHP is running the PHP error log are very helpful in getting a clue
on this type of issue. P

Subject: RE: [nycphp-talk] Potential Setting Problem


Please inform me if this query is mis-directed.

After a year of being away from PHP development I am trying to
re-establish
an environment which combines Apache 2.2, Zend Studio 5.5 (including PHP
5)
and the upgraded version of Seagull framework on Windows XP.  I know the
Apache 2.2 layer is working, but something is wrong at the PHP level.
It
appears to be independent of Seagull, because it also affects phpMyAdmin
in
the same way (both applications are subs under C:\Program Files\Apache
Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs).  I also know that it is browser
independent having tried it in both Firefox and IE.

An address of localhost/seagull/www brings up the Index of seagull/www
which
includes index.php.  However, localhost/seagull/www/index.php does not
execute and display the Seagull entry screen.  The behavior is identical
if
I attempt to address phpMyAdmin.

It seems to me that I have a basic setting that is incorrect.  Can
anyone
point me toward that?

Phil

HI everyone, i know this isn't PHP related, but I've been searching
everywhere:
I'm in dire need of a flash based image recognition software/app ASAP. This
company (nameless) is NOT pulling through and we're at a function right now.
I don't care if we need to buy it. It's really embarrassing that this
company has left us looking like this.
Does anyone know of a chat room, email or someone's ph# who wouldn't mind me
ringing, that knows about this?
Or someone who is a champ flash developer?
Thanks so much, so desperate.

What does that mean?  That sounds a bit like "I am in dire need of a
rocket ship to travel to mars, and it needs to be made with legos."
The current crop of production ready image recognition software is
pretty much limited to recognizing faces, OCR, and a few other trivial
things.

Yes and for this analogy legos == flash.

Now assuming you need your image recognition software to travel to do
something like recognize faces, and you need to be able to display
results through a flash applet, I'm sure you can fiund something
written in C++ or maybe .NET that has a API that you can expose via a
web service. You can then write a flash applet to interface with it.
If you can write the code fast enough you might be able to save face,
and you also have a story that matches Turbo Pascal being written in a
weekend in a motel room.

The May meeting of Unigroup (next Thursday May 22) will be a presentation on
web performance, at least one-third of which will be spent on speeing up PHP
in Apache and faster lighter web servers.

This should be a great meeting, and hoping to see many NYPHP'ers there!

  MAIN PRESENTATION
  -----------------

  Topic: Serving High Performance Web Sites - Where Apache Fails

  For nearly a decade, Apache has been seen as the only practical
  choice for serving static and dynamic content.  To this day, it
  powers the majority of all web sites.  However, Apache has several
  limitations and forthcomings (especially in the area of
  performance).  Nearly a decade of experience has many people
  believing that these limitations are inherent in serving content
  (An entire industry has even been created to deal with these
  limitations).  In reality, none of these limitations exist.
  We'll look into some of these shortcomings, and alternative
  technologies which exist that do not suffer from them.

  This talk will focus on technical and theoretical limitations
  inherent to the design of Apache.  There will be at least a few
  benchmark results shown and explained.  A big part of the talk
  will focus on why mod_php fails, and why FastCGI is superior.

  The following alternative web servers will be discussed:
    - FastCGI over mod_{php,perl,ruby,etc}
    - Lighttpd Web Server
    - Nginx  (if there is time to finish the benchmarks)
    - TUX webserver  (discussed briefly, including some
        system layouts possible with it)

Hi!

After building a dedicated development system I now managed to get all the

the php.ini to load the desired dlls and that appears to work fine for all 
dlls except for php_mbstring.dll. I checked many times and the line in the 
php.ini is uncommented and the dll is in the designated extension directory. I 
also verified that the file names in the extension directory and the php.ini 
match. It still will not load php_mbstring.dll.
Uhm, anyone has an idea what else to do?

try putting another copy of it in the same directory as php.ini and 
php.exe. And you're sure that php is using the php.ini you're modifying, 
right?

Yes, I know it is the right php.ini. I copied the php_mbstring.dll into the 
folder that contains the .exe and .ini and the problem is solved. Thank you 
very much for the help. Any idea why that works and having it in the specified 
extension directory doesn't?

Again, thank you so very much!

It has to do with the 'dll search order' Windows uses.
Typically the order is:
     1) the same directory as the executable.
     2)  the  system  directory
     3) directories found in the 'path' environment variable

see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586.aspx
for the complete 'run down' on 'start up' order
(in Windows you click 'Start' to say you're finished and want to shut down)

But why then do I need to specify an extension directory in php.ini if it is 
not used by php.exe as the primary source for extensions? Just asking, maybe I 
shouldn't worry so much about problems that are already solved.

Especially since new problems come about, such as that the php-cgi.exe crashes 
often. Anyone knows if running PHP on 64bit Windows is not a good idea?

try reading:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39316

I would suggest that you add your extension directory to your path
and move any dll's that start with 'php_' to the extension directory.
(at least don't put php_*.dll's in the system directory to solve a
dll search order problem)

You might want to download 'Dependency Walker' from 
http://www.dependencywalker.com/

Open up php-cgi.exe with 'Dependency Walker' and look for unresolved 
symbols.
(trying to run anything with unresolved symbols is 'not a good idea')

Happy hunting...

Found a suspect. After fixing the most obvious DLL issues I came across the 
dwmapi.dll not existing on non-Vista systems. Since that is related to IE7 I 
switched browsers for development (forgot to do that anyway), but even after 
firefoxerizing the whole thing php-cgi.exe still crashes and blames it on 
php5ts.dll, which apparently doesn't work right on x86_64 systems. Since there 
is no fix for this yet as it seems using PHP on 64 bit Windows systems is a no 
go. Very disappointing!

I will check if that is really 64 bit related by running a 32 bit version in a 
VM, but that doesn't really help since I run 64bit Windows on my "production" 
server, which may also be the reason why the system is so flaky.

Maybe that is a reason to switch to Linux, but at the moment there is not a 
single distro that I think is fit for general consumption. Also disappointing.

I'll post my findings when available. So far, thanks for all the help.

Message-ID: <e7f5666b0805201458h3aba5ab0r7e0bf2377b5aea7a@mail.gmail.com>

So I'm trying to build a form using Zend_Form and building it with a
config file as in:

http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.elements.html#zend.form.elements.config

I'm trying to use custom validator class by adding the prefix path as
I would with
$element->addPrefixPath('My_Validator', 'My/Validator/', 'validate');

My translation of how that should be is something like this:

elements.myField.prefixPaths.validator.prefix = "My_Validate"
elements.myField.prefixPaths.validator.path = "My/Validate/"
elements.myField.prefixPaths.validator.type = "validate"

elements.myField.options.validators.Example.validator = "Example"

but it throws a "Plugin by name Example was not found in the registry"
error. "My/Validate/Example.php" does exist in the path, and works
when built as a class.

Is anyone familiar enough with this crap to point out the error in my
config syntax?

El Jeffe,

Try this:

;Validator must be added before any elements to be used with all 
elements.  I put mine right after the action and method.
action = "Foo"
method="post"
elementPrefixPath.validate.prefix = "My_Validate"
elementPrefixPath.validate.path = "My/Validate/"

; Stuff for the element
elements.MyField.options.validators.validatoralias.validator = 
"ExampleValidator"
elements.MyField.options.validators.validatoralias.options.ExtraArugemnentsPassedToValidator 
= "foobar"

Have fun with this stuff!  Ug!

That did the trick, thanks. I was a troubled by applying what seemed
more global to individual elements, but every example I found did it
that way. I certainly never would've stumbled on "elementPrefixPath"
myself.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] need help with simple ajax demo project
Message-ID: <4834C488.9070501@nyphp.com>

My brain is fried; I need help with a simple AJAX demo. The intent is to 
show the color of some wines upon mousing over their names.

This correctly creates table rows with a name in the first cell and
the second cell blank with an id of "color1", "color2", etc. where the
color will (theoretically) be shown.
============
.....
$tableCounter = 1;
foreach ( $wines as $name ) {
   echo '<tr>
     <td style="border:thin solid"
       onMouseOver="showColor( ' . $tableCounter . ' )"
       onMouseOut="showColor( false )">' . $name . '</td>
     <td style="border:thin solid" id="color' . $tableCounter . '"></td>
     </tr>';
   $tableCounter ++;
}
......
================

This JS has two problems:
1. onMouseOver returns the correct value (according to Firebug) but
doesn't load the inner html, whether I use a hardcoded or variable
getElementById
2. onMouseOut does load the inner html if I hardcode the id, but
throws an error "has no properties" if I try to use a variable
So actually the behavior is (apparently) inconsistent between them.
============
function showColor ( i ) {
   // create variable identifying current id
   var where = 'color' + i
   if ( i == false ) {
     // hardcoding works for testing
     document.getElementById( 'color2' ).innerHTML = 'xxx'
     // variable throws error: has no properties
//    document.getElementById( where ).innerHTML = 'xxx'
     return
   }
   xmlHttp = getXmlHttpObject()
   var uri = 'getColor.php?where=' + where
   uri = uri + '&sid=' + Math.random()
   xmlHttp.onreadystatechange = stateChanged( where )
   xmlHttp.open( 'GET', uri, true )
   xmlHttp.send( null )
}

function stateChanged( where ) {
   if ( xmlHttp.readyState == 4 || xmlHttp.readyState == "complete" ) {
// these both get the correct response but neither loads the innerHTML
     document.getElementById( 'color1' ).innerHTML = xmlHttp.responseText
//    document.getElementById( where ).innerHTML = xmlHttp.responseText
   }
}
===========

What is wrong here?

I would highly recommend you take a look at jQuery.

The problem with Ajax is one quote out of place and you're dead in the
water - you can spend way too much time debugging. Ajax kind of
operates in stealth mode, making it tricky to follow what's really
going on behind the scenes.

Well, one more example of "asking for help reveals the answer",
in this case partially.

This revised code shows that the blanking out upon mouseout, where
I am using a variable id, works, but I'm still not getting the color
upon mouseover, whether I use a hardcoded id or a variable
=======
....
<td style="border:thin solid"
onMouseOver="showColor( ' . $tableCounter . ' )"
onMouseOut="blankOut( ' . $tableCounter . ' )">' . $name . '</td>
....

function showColor ( i ) {
   var where = 'color' + i
   xmlHttp = getXmlHttpObject()
   var uri = 'getColor.php?where=' + where
   uri = uri + '&sid=' + Math.random()
   xmlHttp.onreadystatechange = stateChanged( where )
   xmlHttp.open( 'GET', uri, true )
   xmlHttp.send( null )
}

function blankOut ( i ) {
   var where = 'color' + i
   // this works (using a testing value instead of '' for visibility)
   document.getElementById( where ).innerHTML = 'x'
}

function stateChanged( where ) {
   if ( xmlHttp.readyState == 4 || xmlHttp.readyState == "complete" ) {
     // these both get the correct response
     // but neither loads the innerHTML
     document.getElementById( 'color1' ).innerHTML = xmlHttp.responseText

this may have no relevance at all, but don't u need the semi-colon for
the inline style declaration?

style="border:thin solid;"  vs style="border:thin solid"

You could probably accomplish the same task without the use of AJAX, by 
embedding the answer in the same page and using a rollover javascript to 
swap out the image or text. Or you might even be able to avoid 
javascript by using :hover and :active in css.

Sure; but this is an instructional exercise, the point of which is 
precisely to do it with AJAX (if I can ever figure out why this one 
doesn't work).

Doesn't this entire discussion belong on the Front-End list?  It would 
be nice if the PHP list actually had PHP based discussion.

You could store the time of the last request in the session (or a
cookie) then check it during the next request. If you store it in a
cookie you'll want some way to validate they actually sent back the
correct value.

Now that you asked, you're using a complex solution to solve a very 
simple problem.

Look at the Image Replacement techniques here:

http://webbytedd.com/a.php

They are all css and no javascript is needed.

Why complicate a very simple process?

Cheers,

tedd

Use a META tag to refresh & redirect to logout page. That's the way my bank  does it.

If you are doing Ajaxy stuff, though, could you not get auto-logged-out
prematurely with this approach? That is, of course, unless you are relying
on some client side stuff to reset the inactivity timer with each http
request, ajax or otherwise.

Set a cookie every time your user interacts with the server/site. You  
could use PHP or Javascript for that. Just update the expire time but  
only after you check for the existence of that cookie.

Message-ID: <48358045.2090007@nopersonal.info>

Hi Everyone,

My apologies in advance if I shouldn't be posting this here, but since 
it's not regarding a job opening in the traditional sense, I figured it 
didn't belong on the jobs list.

We have a client that's looking to do an online marketing campaign for 
an upcoming e-commerce site, primarily via AdWords & such. They'd like 
to work with a company in the NYC area that has a proven track record 
with that type of thing.

I don't have any contacts in the SEO/SEM industry, so if any of you can 
recommend someone I'd really appreciate it. Please feel free to email me 
off-list as I don't want to annoy the group with more OT posts.

Thanks,
Bev

Subject: [nycphp-talk] submitting two forms with one button - possible?
Message-ID: <1211470030.8311@coral.he.net>

I have a PHP page with two forms.  One form posts the form data and 
inserts it into the database.  The second form contains Paypal hidden 
variables and passes the transaction to the Paypal site.  This has to 
happen seamlessly with one button and I can't combine the two forms as 
Paypal form has standard format for their form...

How to do this?  Can I call the second form submit programmatically at 
the end of the first form submit in PHP?  Or with Javascript on the 
second form submit call the first form to be submitted?

One way would be to do an ajax call to submit the form #1 data to your 
database, then upon acknowledgment of success, do a regular form submit 
to payal (I'm guessing the user is supposed to be redirected to paypal 
to complete the transaction).

The other way would be to do a regular submit, pass all the info (paypal 
also) to a second php page, which processes the form #1 data then does a 
redirect to paypal. You could add the paypal info in the url (not so 
nice) or paste it into a form as hidden variables, then do a javascript  
<body onLoad="document.mypaypalform.submit()"> so that the form is 
automatically submitted on page load. For maximum non-javascript 
compatibility, you should include a <input type="submit" value="Click 
here to continue"> in the form.

How hard is #1?  I have two situations that I have to handle in this 
manner (one with two forms and one with two submits of the same form 
and then the second form, to check if user account exists). Can you 
point me to some examples?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] installing xdebug on Fedora 7: where is php5-dev?
Message-ID: <721f1cc50805220842u6c0efd5k9f7f30a08970e6@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings

php5-dev seems to be prerequisite to installing xdebug via pecl. Anybody
know what the magic words are to install the php5-dev package on Fedora 7?
yum install php5-dev doesn't do it: "No package php5-dev available" I assume
there's a repository or something that I have to enable in a config but for
all my googling I haven't found the answer.

Thanks,

Not that hard. It's actually something I would use also. (I've resorted 
to option #2 in the past because I wanted payment related stuff to be 
bulletproof - operable without javascript).

If I have time tomorrow, I'll hack up an example. If you discover 
something before then, post the link up here for us.

I would recommend the former, because that is the only way it will work if 
Javascript is disabled. Even if it is enabled, one should never "trust" the 
client browser to do the right thing (or to not be maliciously tampered 
with) - so in the JS scenario, could an attacker submit an order to your 
server without actually providing payment to Paypal? seems quite possible.

Using PEAR HTTP_Request it is quite easy to submit a form from PHP. So you 
could pass along the data from the form to Paypal after you validate the 
order, and then make sure Paypal returns an OK before confirming the order. 
Paypal even has an API for this.

Michael,

Are you subscribed to Front-End?  A couple of people have responded to

This AJAX stuff is a little hairy, I'm going to play with it in the 
near future when I have time so that for future projects, I can do it 
like this.  It's clearly a timesaver in the long run as it eliminates 
probably one of my LEAST favorite programming tasks, which is passing 
variables from page to page to page......

As an added protection, you should verify the Paypal payment with IPN 
(https://www.paypal.com/ipn) before sending off any products or 
authorizing memberships.

David,

In the time it usually takes me to get upset about missing
ports/packages and wonder where they have all gone or why I can't
install my desired extensions, I could have usually finished compiling
apache, php, mysql in that time. :-)

Regards,
jeff

Kristina:

Another consideration is that PayPal provides a link back to your 
"Thank You page" -- so why not send your variables through PayPal via 
a GET, such as:

thankyou.php?<your variables>

 From there you can pick them up and put them in your database.

Cheers,

tedd

Nice! The IPN api allows an "other" field which can pass up to 255 
characters, but that is likely not enough for large forms. Your method 
looks like it could allow a lot more. Any idea of the limitations?

Rolan:

As I answered to someone else privately:

I use two different methods to handle PayPal purchases:

[1.] One is to use their code and my product ID for simple 
transactions, as seen here:

http://ancientstones.com/pic.php?pageNum=93

The item number and buyer specifics is provide back from PayPal so I 
know what was purchased and who purchased it.

[2.] The other is where my code determines the amount; sends a 
request for authorization to PayPal with the users name, cc#, CIV, 
and amount; waits for an authorization back from PayPal; and when 
that happens, it records the purchase and the transaction 
authorization in the database.

[1] is simple -- you use PayPal to collect all the sensitive data.

[2] is involved -- you need a merchant account with PayPal and there 
are liabilities and responsibilities to consider.

Cheers,

tedd

While it is laudable to dive in and start creating your ini files on your own 
and using the individual packages, it might just be a bit too tricky for the 
beginner. That depends on which skills you are focusing, if you want to get 
experienced in administrating Apache and MySQL then there is no way around 
what you are doing now. If - and I assume that to be the case - you want to 
learn about PHP I'd sidestep the nitty gritty configuration and setup of 
Apache and MySQL and go with one of the already configured packages. I can 
highly recommend the XAMPP from Apachefriends.org. It never failed me and I 
even used it for production servers (they say not to do that, but I never had 
any issues). And it just works. You install it, type localhost in the address 
field of a browser on your system and you will see the main page coming up. It 
comes with PHPMyAdmin installed and the demo pages show some nice stuff, butr 
I usually rename the htdocs folder and create a new htdocs folder, in which I 
put my own files.
For MySQL I use the GUI tools from the mysql.com website. I find that they now 
work quite well and are a refreshingly helpful and fast set of tools after 
working during the week with garbage like MSSQL Management Studio. There are 
other and somewhat better MySQL administration clients, but the MySQL tools 
work fine and are easy to use.

What url are you typing to get this error page? 

This does not look like the default apache page.

What OS are you operating? 

Is this a stand alone server/development system? 

Do you have another http server running? 

It's hard to help without knowing details.

I'm sure more info is needed - just hard for a newbie to know what info you

 want to create a website that's database driven at www.WorshipMV.com 
(recently moved files so need to fix blips in code that are there, there is 
a sample page at http://www.worshipmv.com/site_flash/mzm.html - I have a 
list of over 200 houses of worship and the only thing that's stopping me 
from getting this running and selling ads and such is that I want to make it 
searchable so if someone wanted to find a spiritual home that has childcare 
specifically for autistic kids they could do a search and find it - or say a 
Methodist church within 25 miles of their home... that kind of thing - any 
assistance is greatly appreciated.

  What url are you typing to get this error page?

  This does not look like the default apache page.

  What OS are you operating?

  Is this a stand alone server/development system?

  Do you have another http server running?

  It's hard to help without knowing details.

  Hi,

  I'm very new at this and am following at TechnicalLead tutorial; have 
installed mysql, apache and php, have set up a data test folder, a my.ini

  Can I assume if the apache server is running that I should not change the

  Kind of frustrated that I'm following the tutorial and that the last 10

Ah yes. Well the PHP team made it easy for me to install that shit on

I'm ready for stage two of the tutorial tomorrow!

YES! I'm starting to feel better now, I'm sure I'll have more questions but 
at least that is done...

Chad,

You could cron us a job email that sends picture daily via.

That'd be my best guess.

This is not a question about PHP but rather a question about 
programming, that is, the logic of making things happen. It is therefore 
solvable not by syntax but rather by thought. I wonder whether such 
questions are appropriate for this list. Although I have an opinion on 
this issue, I refrain from expressing it here, in the interest of 
letting list members in general answer it either explicitly or 
implicitly, by either giving or not giving possible answers.

I dunno, it seems overly general but not actually off topic.

On a unix (Linux, BSD, Unix) system you would set up a cron job that
executes a php script every night to that loops through each account
and emails the next picture.

I'm not sure how you would do this on Windows but there must be a way.

It gets much more interesting if you have > 10,000 accounts or a
limited time window in which to send the pictures, at which point you
need to create a more sophisticated architecture with multiple
processes each sending to their own segment of the user base.

I gotta agree here. From my point of view its off topic, but only
because I have sent emails in several languages and run scheduled
tasks on windows and cron jobs on unix.

Assuming this person never sent an email via a script or set a cron
job on unix, he probably has no idea that the basic methodology.
Pointing him in the direction of running a scriopt from a cron job,
instead of through the web server might be what he needs to know. If
he can't figure out cron, then he finds a unix mailing list. If he
can't get his mail script to work he posts the source and error on
this list.

If he doesn't know enough to know that he didn't ask a PHP question,
we should point him in that direction. There was a point where
everyone on this list didn't know their was a mechanism for running
jobs at a scheduled task on their operating system of choice. I
happened to be well versed in cron before ever hearing of PHP. Others
have opposite experiences.

Justin Dearing

Subject: [nycphp-talk] protecting download directory in PHP app on Unix box?
Message-ID: <1211988321.10102@coral.he.net>

This might be off topic as well...but I have a PHP app that submits to 
Paypal and then on the "thank you" page, I provide a link to a PDF that 
they bought.

The server is Unix based, and before submitting the sale, I collect 
various information about the user, and then when the transaction is 
complete, I get a unique transaction ID from Paypal.

What's the easiest, quickest way to provide some level of complexity to 
the downloads so that people can't just go back into the directory and 
download every PDF without paying?  It doesn't have to be 100% secure 
but should be secure enough to keep out "most" people.

I've been looking into .htaccess but wondering if that's overkill and 
there isn't some way to authenticate against my DB information before 
allowing the download?

Hello Kristina,

First off, don't have the PDF's "serveable" from Apache.
Have them OUT of the web root.

Second, after they pay, and get the IPN feedback to validate the sale,
you could copy the pdf from your safe directory (outside of apache)
to the webroot and rename it something unique.

You could go so far as creating a maze of unique directories:

ie: /ra123/poo/fluff/uuid123123123123.pdf

Then remove it after 24 hours or something.

Or just email the purchasers email address (obtained through paypal) the 
.pdf.

Hi Kristina,

I would say don't provide a link directly to the file (e.g., 
http://example.com/protected/file.pdf).  Instead, provide them a unique 
key embedded in a link to a script, which script would then download the 
file for them (e.g., 
http://example.com/getfile.php?key=secretstuff&file=file.pdf).  This way 
the script controls who gets what.  (And if you really want to clamp 
down, it would even allow you to make keys valid for only one use, etc.)

Kristina,

A proxy is the best way to go.

1) Create a table that has userid, pdfid (or jsut pdf filename)  and
transactionid (from paypal). You don't need the transactionid fro
this, but its good for auditing

2) Creat a simple php prody for serving the pdfs. It will take a
pdfid, or file name as a parameter. Have it set the mime type, open
the file and write the file contents to the web client. This allows
you to move the pdfs out of the web readable directory. Of course you
have no added security, yet.

3) At the top of the file make sure of 2 things
   1 - The user is logged in
   2 - There is an entry in that table where userid and pdfid(or pdf
filename) matches.

People can then download as much as they want but only the files they
bought. You can add a timestamp to the above table and allow them
downloads for a limited amount of time.

We did it this way:

1) when the paypal IPN comes back make an entry a database table that 
lists customers and pdf's.

2) Point the download link to a php program, like 
download.php?file=x.pdf.  There are tricks here with doing it like 
/downloads/filename.pdf, but that can easily be added once you get the 
download.php program working.

3) The download.php checks the database table to see if they are 
allowed.  If not, return some kind of error.

4) If the user is clear, run code like this below, be sure not to send 
anything at all to the browser before this code runs, not even a blank line:

    $path = '....';
    $filename = '....';
   header('Content-Type: application/x-pdf');
   header('Content-Disposition: attachment; 
filename="'.strtolower($filename).'"');
   header('Content-Length: '.(string)(filesize($path.$filename)));
   readfile($path.$filename);

Hmm... I like this... if I copy the file to the web server I can name 
the directory after their transaction ID....make unique directory for 
each customer...then delete them after a day or so...we have lots of 
room..is this doable on a shared host?  ...outside "public_html" is 
outside the root, or no?

Hmm...seems quick and easy.  

I'm not sure how to do that in PHP though, any links to sample code?

I could use the transaction ID for that, which is what I really want to 
use somehow, as they are guaranteed unique.

As someone else pointed out, you probably should NOT have Apache serve the 
PDF directly. Much better to generate a token that gets emailed to them 
when they checkout. During the checkout, you would need to make a record 
of the transaction and token. You will need to write a download script 
that takes the token, does some checks in your database and then returns 
the PDF directly with the correct MIME type.

my question is do you really need to custom roll this out - there are a
few apps (which are slipping my mind atm) that do exactly this out of
the box..... ?

1) customer order is directed to paypal
2) on payment complete paypal notifies your script
3) customer receives download link via email
4) customer has X times to download the file within Y time
5) Admins can reactivate the order allowing X more times or Y time to
download
6) works with any number of download products

and that's just the framework method... you could use a zencart /
freeway /x-cart if you needed a more robust solution

Hi Kristina,

Kenneth's reply is more detailed than mine, with the same idea in mind.  
His #4 shows sample code for downloading files through PHP.  It's up to 
you of course how you organize your data tables to store the paid 
transactions and validate new download requests against them.

Dan Horning also makes a good point in this thread about using a 
pre-existing framework (though I can't think of any by name, and I'm not 
sure what you'd Google for other than php download framework, which 
seems terribly broad...)  When I was starting out with things like this, 
a framework did not seem near as fun as rolling my own, and it had the 
added drawback of seeming like overkill, but I bet it would have exposed 
me to projects and code of far higher quality than I was getting on the 
tutorial sites, which probably would have helped me as a developer in 
general.  Maybe worthwhile in the long run.

Hi Kristina,

If you want to allow static downloads (meaning the user directly links
to the file) then your options are fairly limited. Apache might offer
some kind of connection based controls but I'm not aware of anything
that would be applicable. If you allow user's static access to files,
in general, anyone can access any files. About the only thing you
could do with static downloads is make the filename or part of the
path name unique to the user or their session. Meaning you could
create a subdirectory based on the user's username or the session ID
and then place the file or a link to the file in that directory. Then
you could have a cron that deletes directories older than a certain
time.

If you can do scripted downloads (meaning PHP is interpreting the
request and writing the file contents to the client) then your access
control options increase significantly. With script level access
control you can of course check the user's information in the database
to determine definitively if they are permitted access to the
particular file.

Or you could use a combination of both static and scripted access. For
example, you could scramble your filenames using a reversible
transformation such as using mcrypt_{encrypt,decrypt}. Store your
files using the scrambled names. Send the user a link with the
scrambled name. Then when they request the file, de-scramble the name
so that you can send a Content-Disposition header with the friendly
filename.

Of course there are many permutations of this. It really depends on
your specific needs and constraints.

ah, yes,forgot to mention that.  You can generate your own order # for 
the transaction and give it to paypal, and they will give it back to you. 

You can follow this chain:

1) Insert a row into your customer-pdf table, with a flag indicating it 
is not complete
2) Pull the id from the row and hand it to Paypal as the order #
3) When the IPN comes back you use the ID # to know what customer and 
pdf are involved, and you can get any customer information from your 
customer file.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] protecting download directory in PHP app on Unix box?
Message-ID: <1211996974.22458@coral.he.net>

The entire app is written except for this part of it, and I am 
expecting to be able to implement something with medium security in a 
reasonable period of time, like, today :)

And the client has stated they do not want any solution where the 
customer has to be emailed, they want a direct link for the download 
right after payment.

I like the idea of using the transaction id/PDF id pair in a lookup 
table to authenticate the redirect to a file download URL...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Remove folder from document root....
Message-ID: <8f0676b40805281054q58c7351budef1fcf8e0623e73@mail.gmail.com>

I have a site that has a bunch of stuff that shouldn't be within the
document root (cron scripts, class files, etc.).  I could move the
files, but fixing all of the include statements is more trouble than
it's worth.

What is the best way to tell Apache ignore a folder that resides in
the document root?
I could just rewrite/redirect requests into oblivion, but that seems
like a kludge.  I feel like there should be a one line apache command
to do this, but I can't find it in the docs.


Regards,
John Campbell

Try this in a .htaccess:

Order Allow,Deny
Deny from all

This is similar to what I was planning on doing...

http://www.proofmagazine.com/getfile.php?
tx=funkypaypaltransid&PDFid=1234&file=file.pdf

authenticates against the transaction id / pdf id pair and then serves 
up a file...but where does the file live and how does this page know 
where to find it and etc...that's what I'm not clear on, can anyone 
further explain this file=file.pdf aspect?

Have the files lie in a folder outside of public_html and reference
the files via  ../pdf_folder/$filename.

OK so something in the script like $filepath = ../pdf_folder/$filename

this is what I was asking about...how to reference that 
specifically...is there a specific function I need to call that uses 
this filepath or...?

readfile() is what your looking for. See Ken's original example.

MD5.  Here's a function I use in a file_store class to generate a munged 
directory file path given (for instance) a user's unique ID.

     public function generate_upload_path($id)
     {
         $hash  = md5($id);
         $p1 = substr($hash, 0, 3);
         $p2 = substr($hash, 3, 3);

         return $this->attachments_dir . "/$p1/$p2/$id";
     }

SHA1 is better.

That's something YOU would decide/design.

If the PDFs are custom per user then you should probably create a unique 
path with their user ID embedded in it. If not, then you can decide how to 
organize the tree of PDFs. BUT the user will not see the pathname, only 
your download script, so you decide.

Thanks Ajai -- I was wondering how to pass the filepath into the 
function and call the download...but as usual my questions have been 
answered here on our wonderful list!

Basically I'm having the web host recommend the most secure location 
for our directory and then just name the PDFs by ID#...they're not 
custom by user but will be for sale to anyone for 99 cents...URL to be 
posted ASAP! :)

For this purpose, the level of encryption security is academic.

What is the point of this?  It offers no security -- if one knows the
id, then then they know $p1 and $p2.   Why not just put it in a folder
of the id?

If you want to make $p1 and $p2 harder to guess, you will need to do
something like:
$hash = md5(md5("a secret long enough that it can't be rainbowed") . $id);

Generally, I dont like to pass actual filenames - much better to generate 
a token and use that to reference a database table that maps it to the 
transaction.

John -- as long as 

1.  The actual filepath is not exposed to the user at any point; and

2.  The download is authenticated against their unique Paypal 
transaction ID beforehand (certifying payment received); and

3.  The directory storing the files is outside the web root in some 
secure location  --

I think I am fully covered...yes?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL Syntax questions
Message-ID: <1212014564.26527@coral.he.net>

I have two questions regarding syntax for MySQL queries.

1.  I have complex queries where there are lots of conditional 
statements, i.e. SELECT * FROM table WHERE this=this AND that=that OR 
thing=thing OR blah=blah OR foo=foo AND bar=bar OR etc=etc OR 
thing2=thing2...


They are not erroring out but they aren't narrowing the resultset 
sufficiently...do I need parentheses or is there something else I need?

2.  How can I select the last row inserted from a table WHERE 
field1=somethingineed and field2 is NULL?

Thanks in advance...full of questions today I am!

Because stashing potentially tens of thousands of files into a single 
directory is an SA nightmare even if you have a filesystem that supports 
that many nodes in a directory.

The question wasn't about security.  It was about how to break up an ID 
into something that could point to file inside a directory hierarchy. 
It's not a URL but a file path that the application generates from the 
user's ID.  Making it harder for the user to guess isn't an issue 
because the directory would presumably (hopefully) live outside web root.

For #1, if you had parentheses around what you want together, MySQL will understand what to return.? For example (no logic here, just example):
SELECT * FROM table WHERE ( this=this )?AND (?( that=that OR 
thing=thing )?OR ( ( blah=blah OR foo=foo )?AND ( bar=bar OR etc=etc ) ) )

In short: you have to be careful of how expressions are evaluated.   
More parenthesis are likely the solution.

If you've got an auto_increment field (named "id", perhaps):

SELECT max(id) as lastId FROM table where feld1='foo' and field2 is null

In the case of this project, there will potentially be several hundred 
PDFs but no more than that, at least for the foreseeable future...there 
are about 30 articles or less published per year by this magazine.

So I think one static directory can work for us.

Tim, with regard to the second query, I wanted the entire row not just

Or a subquery:

There are some new ways to show your involvement in the New York PHP Community!

LinkedIn Group -
If you're on LinkedIn joining the NYPHP Community group will allow you
to contact other NYPHP Community members and view their profiles. You
can join the group by following the link below:

http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/110439/53F044687FCA

Flickr NYPHP Group -
I've been adding pictures to this group for a few months now, but it
doesn't have to just be pictures of New York PHP meetings. If any of
you NYPHPers went to PHP|tek or any of the other conventions, feel
free to add your pictures to the group.

Always plan to make it future-proof as much as you can. If that becomes 
100 per year, then what?

Then in the year 2108, she will have to make changes to the code.

In my experience, this type of future proofing buys you nothing.   I
have found that tons of other problems arise before overflow issues
start to be a problem.  I did a similar thing and I just put the files
in a folder with the id.  Bandwidth and diskspace became a problem
long before a too many folder problem.  The solution was to move
everything to Amazon S3.  S3 doesn't have folders and supports and
unlimited number of objects. It turned out to be a blessing that I
didn't do something fancy with the folder naming.

Message-ID: <799abcd40805291103k7966126ejdceac5b621d169c3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am hoping someone can help me with a solution. I have a main website that
is also acting as a reverse proxy. Thes proxy is a frontend to a few other
web servers on the backend. All is working o.k... What I'm looking to do now
is to put in place some kind of access control so that the proxy will ONLY
serve web pages from those who are authenticate from the main site. Again,
the main site in on the same server as the proxy.

Here's the setup:

www.mainsite.com  (Proxy)
server1.mainsite.com
server2.mainsite.com
server3.mainsite.com

The www.mainsite.com has my drupal users where they can sign-up and
authenticate. What I want is: If users enter url server1.mainsite.com then
the proxy would somehow prompt users to first login. But, I'm not sure how
this can be done/achieved. I would appreciate any comments/suggestions to
accomplish this.

Regards,
Joe

and One entitled "NYPHP Community"

This is the one that Brian just created after talking to me.

Webmaster, can you merge your group into the NYPHP Community one Brian just
announced?

It sounds tough, because the browser isn't going to send the
www.mainsite.com cookie to server1.mainsite.com.

But wait, you said www was acting as a reverse proxy, so why would
someone go directly to server1?

If all the connections go through www, you can use mod_rewrite to
check for existence of drupal's session cookie, and redirect to login
if not found.

If someone knew the setup, they could fake the drupal cookie, so if
you're trying to protect something valuable using this scheme you may
need to consider a different mechanism, such as an auto-prepend script
that checks if the session is valid.

Chis, thanks for your reply/comments...

> But wait, you said www was acting as a reverse proxy, so why would
> someone go directly to server1?
>

To answer your question above, typically, users will visit main site which
has webpage links that would take user to inside server via the proxy.
However, that URL is shown/known when user mouse over the links. So, it can
easily be used for future visits to server-x.mainsite.com.... And, I
suspect, web engines will pick those links up as well.

And, even if users that access site via main site they may not have
authenticated before clicking on the link that would take them to the
backend server.

So, you are right, it seems that I would need something like mod_rewrite
and/or the prepend script you mentioned. I've struggled to get my proxy
working and have not yet played around with mod_rewrite. Also, the pre-pend
script you refered to - Can you give me more info on this?

Is there a sample of this script you can share and how it would work? Would
really appreciate any help on this!

Joe

I will go further and say it is worse than nothing.  You end up with 
code you need to test against a case that receives no real-world 
pressure.  Then when you have to make real changes in response to actual 
(as opposed to hypothetical) needs you have tip-toe around this code and 
avoid breaking it -- even though it is not necessary!

I eventually wrote in my little book: Do not abstract against 
non-existent cases.

Chris,

Wanted to see if you can help me implement the mod-rewrite and/or the
pre-pend script you mentioned below. I'm starting to read up on using
mod-rewrite and it seems it could take a bit of time to master it. I am
hoping to get a sample setup that would work for me. Thanks!

Joe

Your situation isn't something that I've done before, so I can't
really help you other than pointing you in the (hopefully) right
direction. Don't be scared of mod_rewrite, there are plenty of people
on this list and elsewhere that can answer questions.

I forgot that Apache's mod_proxy is too dumb to rewrite the links.
There is a Free module called mod_proxy_html that will:
http://apache.webthing.com/mod_proxy_html/

If you can use that instead of the default mod_proxy it will make
things much easier, because then the internal servers can stay hidden.
At that point, you could even configure them to only answer to www.

This kind of thinking is so prevalent it even has its own acronym: 
YAGNI. (You Ain't Gonna Need It.)
It's at the core of just about all the agile little-m methodologies.
