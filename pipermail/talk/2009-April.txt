I have a fun project that I need to build which revolves around php
resizing photos. There's no money involved, but you never know what will
come of it... I've used php for basic resizing, but don't really want to
get into it right now. Anyone interested? I will be building the
front-end and you will do the script. i don't image it will be much more
than a single script.

Hit me up!

Hadn't thought about it. No, I don't think so, because I don't think
we're doing anything new and different. If we end up doing something
really amazing then maybe.

    The site I'm thinking about most at the moment has it's own routing 
framework that's got some influence from symfony,  but it's got a little 
more interaction between the "master controller" and the 
"subcontrollers" that allows it to manage it's relationship with web 
browsers,  crawlers and semweb clients.  For instance,  I can move stuff 
around in crazy ways and everything will redirect correctly.  Just 
launched it at

http://carpictures.cc/

    For a number of practical reasons,  I'm obsessive about URL 
canonicalization for this site,  so don't want to see //'s in URLs,  not 
like the //'s that GNU autoconf codes into applications when people 
aren't careful about specifying the --prefix.

    There's a lot of things I like about symfony:  overall I think the 
routing is OK for content-oriented sites,  even tolerable for webapps 
(though I sometimes like to route based on POST variables there) but 
I've got enough differences to roll my own.  The framework for that site 
is designed to enable extreme reuse of schemas,  templates and such for 
similar sorts of sites:  it's kind of a CMS built for machines instead 
of people.

    Chris and Brent had practical solutions and I'll probably built a 
simple library for path wrangling.

    Overall I don't agree w/ Dan's idea that this is a training and 
documentation issue.  Car Pictures is a pilot project for something 
that's going to be at least 100 times bigger:  it's going to involve 
getting more people in,  and controlling costs is going to be an 
important part of making the vision work.  I think it's cheaper to build 
a system that can't be screwed up than it is to (i) spend time writing 
documentation,  (ii) expect people to spend time reading it,  (iii) 
looking over people's shoulders to make sure that they read the docs and 
that they follow it,  and (iv) dealing with the downstream consequences 
of people not complying.  See

You disregard Postel's Advice at your peril.

Be liberal in what you expect, and use every technical solution at
your disposal to convert it into what the system actually needs.

Depends on the context.  When it comes to user input, absolutely.  When 
it comes to people writing the code, I expect good work.  Though when 
things turn into a huge project, that gets harder and harder.

I don't know what 100 times bigger turns out to be in terms of
users/traffic, but I would recommend not investing a lot of time
investing in the FE handling this.  When you get to the point where
you're partitioning users based on shards of data, or just site
functions, you'll probably want a proxy cluster (and caching I'm sure)
in front of your FEs.  Most of your routing would need to happen at
level then.

Thanks,

    The system I'm planning is going to be essentially sharded into 
silos,  though there will be some stuff shared between shards.  It's 
really going to be a network of sites on specific topics that,  
together,  cover very wide subject areas.  From a business standpoint 
it's easier to make things work for a site that's about a topic than it 
is a site that's about "everything".

    In the short term I'm planning on introducing something like 
WP-Supercache to handle most of the HTML and RDF traffic without hitting 
PHP at all,  particularly when the site has social media spikes.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Why - Safari?
Message-ID: <20090403191038.YUAQ21082.hrndva-omta04.mail.rr.com@DeJaVu>

I have a setenvif which works when using ie and ff, but not safari.  Since
it's on the server-side, I figured it should always work just as long as the
browser sets the HTTP Headers correctly.

 

SetEnvIf Cookie "logged_out=1" logged_out_env=1

Order Allow,Deny

Deny from env=logged_out_env

 

SetEnvIf Authorization "realm=\"account\"" logged_in_env=1

Order Allow,Deny

Allow from env=logged_in_env

 

I set the realm with htaccess digest and the cookie with php.

 

I've tried things like "^(.*)?logged_out=1(.*)?$", etc.  Both of these
statements deny access.

 

For some reason neither of these statements allow the user access when using
Safari, but if I turn the orders off and look at phpinfo, the headers look
like:

 

Cookie
__utmz=125407186.1238772749.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)|utmccn=(direct)|utmcmd=(none
); PHPSESSID=sqh58tnkrkmb46o6bd1e60srq7; logged_out=0;
__utma=125407186.2910789677633345500.1238772749.1238783965.1238784122.7;
__utmc=125407186; __utmb=125407186.42.10.1238784122

Authorization     Digest username="auser", realm="account",
nonce="jpCKC6tmBAA=d6657424b87e5916af57b6184e62949d9638d4c6",
uri="/account/", response="b52f484b12096ec8b376349366616b95",
algorithm="MD5", cnonce="e3545cc852130483f1cc536f40f9c6ff", nc=00000001,
qop="auth"

 

Does anyone know why this wouldn't work?  It's throwing me for a loop.  What
is Safari doing?

 

Thanks,

 

Michele

Subject: [nycphp-talk] php script timeout not working
Message-ID: <1238963300.32520.1309079819@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hey, folks. I've got a script that uploads a file from my server to
Amazon's S3. It works fine, and I'm using ignore_user_abort(true) so
that I can call it, but don't have to wait for the response. Great. Now
I am trying to create the file that will call the uploader and then die.
It basically looks like this:

set_time_limit(1);
    	
$handle = fopen("http://localhost/s3uploader.php", "r");
stream_set_timeout($handle, 1);

But neither timeout is working - it sits and spins while the upload
takes place. Any ideas?

Thanks,

Corey

set_time_limit(1);
in that line you are setting the time limit to one second. You should
make this number a  lot higher. set_time_limit(60) if you want to set
the time limit to 60 seconds.


Also, you just might be running out of memory so try increasing your
script's memory usage. ini_set(?memory_limit?,?16M?);

I want it to call the other script (the uploader) and then stop. So I'm
setting it to timeout after one second on purpose to make sure it won't
keep running.

Unless you're running it in a separate thread, won't the script die when 
the launcher exits?

Nope - by specifying ignore_user_abort(true); in the uploader script,
the uploader script will continue after the launcher exits.

set_time_limit() works for your PHP code.  Streams, in a way, are outside 
your PHP code.

That's not working because you're opening and reading the file directly.  
The timeout setting has no effect because you haven't gotten to that line 
yet

Two options.  Use fsockopen() instead of fopen(), see the 
stream_set_timeout() documentation for examples.  Or use 
ini_set('default_socket_timeout', 1) before you call fopen().

Corey,
Are you on a unix based machine?  Is that script really local?

Try
shell_exec('/path/to/s3uploader.php &');
instead of fopen.

The ampersand will get it to return without waiting for the upload  
script to finish.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Is it safe to log unsanitized,

Message-ID: <865a7acf0904051756x1bd04be1l1c1bdecc88007da2@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

I have a question about logging messages.

Is it safe to log unsanitized, unvalidated user-inputted data into a logfile?

For example, if I have a function called check_username(), which
checks that the username only consists of A-Za-z0-9, is it safe to
have check_username() write to a logfile that it was called on the
particaular user-inputted string, like so:

Function definition:
function check_username($username, &$error)
{
  .. set $log_file...

  /* print out informational message. */
  error_log(__FUNCTION__ . '(' . $username . '): called.', 3, $log_file);

  ..check the username for correctness..
}

Function called like so:
check_username('$_POST['username'], $error);

Output to logfile:
check_username(user1): called.


Is it possible for an attacker to submit  a specific string as the
$username to somehow "escape" out of the error_log() function and have
code executed instead (like calling phpinfo())?



thanks,
Konstantin

in case it wasn't - backticks are basically the short cut to get PHP to
execute something on the command line.

*always *check incoming user data.

    It all depends on how paranoid you are.

    Strange text can be toxic to any of the software that processes your 
logfiles.  For instance,  there are some character sequences that can 
cause some terminal programs to capture some characters from the screen 
and send them back to the command line.  Any software that looks at your 
log files can potentially have buffer overflows that could be triggered 
by them.

I don't understand how this has any impact on the OP's code. The
backticks would simply be written to the log file. If you are careless
enough to try to execute a log file as a shell script then you might
as well erase your disk.

> always check incoming user data.

Actually I do not validate incoming data. At least not when it is
first received. I assume everything is tainted until it gets to the
point of where it really matters and then I validate it there. If I'm
writing some field to a database, I always escape the data just before
it's inserted so if someone supplies total garbage it doesn't matter.
As long as it's escaped it's completely benign (to the database).

In fact I would go so far as to say that validating data at the
point-of-entry is a coding error. For example, Joomla! validates
usernames before it passes them to authentication plugins. This is an
error because Joomla! does not know what a valid username is in the
context of the external authority. At one point Joomla! would not work
with OpenID or Windows Active Directory because it explicitly excluded
certain characters that were valid for those external authorities. The
proper solution is to allow the authentication plugin to define
username validation and provide a default implementation that can
easily be overridden.

Note that even though validating data when it is first received is not
critical to security, escaping output /is/ critical to security. So
it's ok to receive garbage. Just don't send garbage. This leads me
back to the OP's question of "do I need to validate user input that is
written to a log file?". The answer is no but you do need to escape
(or rather remove, truncate or flatten) anything that you don't want
to end up being read by a program that reads log files like passwords
and excessively long messages that might fill up the disk or prevent
someone from viewing the log.

Don't be absurd.

You are long-windedly saying that you validate user-input just like everyone
else -- before you put it in the database and before you present it back to
the user.  All of that *typically* happens in short order.

You can't test the database for a username existance if you haven't
completely escaped it beforehand.

This is overly complicating the matter because the OP never mentioned
Joomla! or any other specific instances of using said data outside of
inserting into the log file.

if his code had read:

error_log(__FUNCTION__ . "($username): called.", 3, $log_file);

I wouldn't have made any comment at all.

If the backticked code were not in double quotes it would be executed and
the resulting output of the backticked code would be recorded to the log.

are you joking?  how do you test for "garbage" without having tested the
input?  how do you tell your php script what garbage is?  You can't, at best
you can only program the script to test for what *isn't* garbage - i.e. a
regex. and then proceed to allow the function to work safely.

i admit, yes, you have to escape stuff before it gets recorded (which is
obvious)... but you also have to make sure that by contatenating text to
anything that the text does not actually *do* something if the text is
referenced without double quotes.

throw <?php echo "this is a test of `ls -al ./`" . `ls -al ./`;?> into a
file and see what happens.

Backticks must be interpreted as part of the script or using eval. So
because user input would be in the form of a string, the backticks
will not be interpreted.

No. I'm not joking. By "garbage" I mean anything so you don't need to
"test" it. You can safely put totally unvalidated "garbage" into a
database. It just needs to be escaped. Validating and escaping are two
completely different things.

That's not what the OP's code does. The OP code does the equivalent of this:

<?php
$user_input = '`ls`';
echo "this is a test of `ls -al ./`" . $user_input;

User supplied data will be in the form of a string and therefore the
backticks will not be evaluated.

The OP code is totally harmless.

The text isn't ever passed with double quotes. It's passed as a string. 
Double quotes are just a mechanism used *inside a PHP file* to clump a 
bunch of characters into a string. The real contents of the variable is 
what's between the double quotes. That's why the following are all 
equivalent:

$bar = 'test';

$foo = "test";

$baz = <<<EOT
test
EOT;

$qux = <<<'EOT'
test
EOT;


Since user input comes from GET, POST or FILES, it will *always* be a 
string. For example, if a user visits the following url:

http://example.com/index.php?foo=test

the user input $_GET['foo'] is strictly equal to all four of those 
strings above:

assert($_GET['foo'] === 'test');

assert($_GET['foo'] === <<<EOT
test
EOT
);

etc.


The contents of that GET variable (or a POST variable, or the contents 
of a file) is a string. A string will never hurt you unless you evaluate 
it as code--either through a call to eval(), or a DB query (yep, that's 
evaluating a string), or some other way.

For everything outside of those uses, worrying about sanitizing things 
inside a string is about as useful as worrying about PHP function names 
and keywords inside a string. Can you imagine how much of a pain it 
would be to escape every instance of 'die' or 'exit' or 'print' from PHP 
strings?

Thanks, Rob. I looked at that for a minute cos it seems like the best
option, but I'm using the Zend framework, where it would be a pain to
break the code out to be an executable script. Plus I want to be able to
call it from a URL.

It's fairly easy to convert a PHP script to an executable script under
Unix. Just make it executable. Most things work without changes,
although you will be missing any URL parameters and web specific
directives. I've used parts of the Zend framework in command line
scripts without changes.
But if you really need to keep it as a web page, use wget as the exec
script. It's round about, but you are running and releasing the script
while keeping it web based.
Although for php to call the script and not wait for it to complete, I
think you need to do more than just put it in the background. You have
to make sure PHP has no return values to wait for (>/dev/null 2>&1)
and "gives up" control of it (nohup)
shell_exec('nohup wget ... > /dev/null 2>&1)

Interesting. I'll take a look at wget. I do need to pass a param so I do
need to run it as a URL I think.

wget or curl basically hit a web page. One of the parameters is a URL
to hit, you're just not using a browser. Although you could tell the
server you are a browser of your choice.

Okay, awesome. I was looking at curl too at one point. I'll try it with:
CURLOPT_TIMEOUT - The maximum number of seconds to allow cURL functions
to execute.

Okay, trying curl. Using:

$curl_handle=curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl_handle,CURLOPT_URL,'http://localhost/uploader');
curl_setopt($curl_handle,CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT,2);
curl_exec($curl_handle);
curl_close($curl_handle);

But it doesn't timeout. Any ideas?

Thanks,

Corey

Ooh, this worked:

ini_set('default_socket_timeout', 1);
@fopen("http://dubfiler/upload/tos3/Id/11", "r");

Had to use @ to suppress the warning that I was exceeding the timeout,
but otherwise. Thanks!

Brian,

This is not true.  I tested what was discussed in this thread and here
are the results.

(1)
If an attacker submits the following as the $username: `touch /tmp/fooooo`
This will be outputted to the logfile: check_username(`touch
/tmp/fooooo`): called.
The attacker's input is not executed.  It is treated as a string.

(2)
If an attacker submits the following as the $username: <?php `touch
/tmp/fooooo` ?>
This will be outputted to the logfile: check_username(<?php `touch
/tmp/fooooo` ?>): called.
The attacker's input is not executed.  It is treated as a string.

Only if I process the logfile with php -f <logfile> will the code in
(2) actually execute.
The code in (1) won't even run since it's outside the <?php ?> tags,
but that's a minor point.

Paul raises a good question about log processing software that might
interpret and run the code....it seems that's where the real problem
lies.

Ok, after bad examples, and all the hulabaloo, and being proven wrong about
said bad examples... what I say still stands:

Always check the data the user sent you - just check it in such a way that
is appropriate for your situation.

If you don't believe in that then stop checking the data any user enters on
any of your forms, and don't worry about XSS or SQL injections because
that's basically what Michael is saying, only escape user data before
inserting into the database.

I guess that would make form processing easier.

Insanity.

Mike brings up a good point about truncating excessively long
user-inputted strings when logging them.

I'm currently using something like this:

if (strlen($msg) > ProjectConstants::LOG_MESSAGE_MAX_LENGTH)
{
   $msg = substr($msg, 0, ProjectConstants::LOG_MESSAGE_MAX_LENGTH);
   $msg .= '...';
}

Any suggestions or ideas?

thanks,
Konstantin

FYI...

CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT just works on the connection attempt.  So once 
you're connected, this option doesn't mean anything.

CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, on the other hand, works on the whole process, I 
believe.

I generally use this method for truncating strings (breaks on word 
boundaries): http://tr.im/itax

Greetings,

 

Before we build a new wheel
 has anyone had success leveraging the Amazon
FPS API with PHP?

 

I?m not referring to the COBUI (Co-Branded User Interface) pipeline. I want
to use the Gatekeeper API with installed tokens ? preferably API version
2008-09-17, though experience with the prior 2007 version could be useful.

Learn the info, take the practice exams, and then move on to learning
from every other site, too. I can't imagine a 'certification' from an
automated test by an unofficiated company (w3 is a company, not an
organization) would help you get hired. Either yre a rockstar or yre
not. Don't get my wrong - I love the w3schools. I use them daily. I just
don't think their certs are worth a lot.

Interesting presentation:

A lot of valid pros/cons in my opinion.  If the cons can be dealt with, I
see PHP remaining and growing as the dominant language on the web, both for
larger and smaller sites.

What always got me in the door was a Computer Science degree from
UC-Berkeley.

That seemed to help.  As an employer, I'd be looking for a combination of
education and number of years of direct experience.  Five years is
considered an even exchange for an education by some employers.

There was a different website and no one I either met or heard about had
used their test results as a way to document their knowledge.  I may have
heard this from a headhunter.  From what I understood, it actually worked.

As an employer, I would put much stock in it.

But, if I can remember the website, I'll forward the link.

This was a website that I was told was being recognized by some employers as
verifying experience.

I don't know how much stock I'd put in it though.

Hello,

Typically, I've seen this website used by large corporations to sift 
through candidates - I've had HR or a HH
require a test from this website be taken to progress to the next stage 
of the interview. I always felt it was
a bit *silly* - The type of organization that includes this as part of 
their metrics is typically NOT the
type of place I want to work.

A search of PHP from brainbench returned:
CGI Scripting    Available    Plan    Learn    Test    $49.95
MySQL 3.23 Administration    Available    Plan    Learn    Test    $49.95
PHP 4    Available    Plan    Learn    Test    $49.95
PHP 5    Available    Plan    Learn    Test    $49.95

Personally, I'd focus on a Zend test, or a college course. I obviously 
cannot comment on the quality of this test since
I dont know if its the same as the ones I've taken or not.

Both sites look similar:
http://www.brainbench.com/xml/bb/common/testcenter/taketest.xml?testId=2523
http://www.w3schools.com/cert/cert_php.asp


Anyways, to the point, if your looking for a job at one of the companies 
that may employ this test,
great - that might look good for you.

I don't think it can hurt you - good luck w/whatever you decide to do! 
It always a good idea to be
sharpening your skill set.

- Ben

My $2*10^-2,
Zend PHP5 certification is $125. For $165 you get the self study lit that
comes with a PDF, 10 online practice tests, and a voucher for the exam.
Passing the exam gets you listed in the zend yellow pages, and you can join
an exclusive group on linked in.

I took and passed the test on Monday with minimal preparation. I have not
written PHP regularly since 2007, but wrote an entire media sharing portal
in PHP for a site that never launched before then. Since then all my PHP
hacking has been for writing sample applications for talks I gave at LIPHP
and a little bit of hacking on an open source project called
http://www.andromeda-project.org/. I've been a full time .NET developer
since then, and thats all been back end ETL coding. So I am by no means a
PHP expert, and I'm a bit rusty.

On the brainbench side of things, I took the unix and apache brainbench when
I got hired as a junior unix and as/400 operator a few years back, I passed
both without special preparation.

Overall I think the problem with PHP certification is there is no advanced
certification. Cisco has the CCIE. Microsoft has the MSCE and MCPD. Netware
has (and I assume still has) the CNE. Redhat has advanced certification
beyond the RHCE. I have something to show companies that I've mastered the
PHP basics. There's no formal certification I can obtain to say I have
advanced knowledge of PHP.

Fellow PHPers,

I seen email that speople send that includes a button to add the
a specific email event to your outlook.

You can see something similar if you have gmail.  whe you compose a message
there is a button that says add event.

How is this done?

Can this be done using php?

Thanks,

Nestor :-)

Basically you add a .ics attachment to the email with MIME type 
text/calendar. The attached file should be in VCALENDAR format.

Ajai,

thanks for the info.  I read somthing about this but I figured that most be
another way.
I guess is not completly automatically.  The user still has to open the
attachment and click save .

Thanks again,

Depends on the client. Entourage and Outlook will show a link or a button 
to add, refuse or tentatively add the event to its calendar. Im assuming 
Apple Mail does something similar? I think Thunderbird will also do this 
if you have the calendar extension installed.

Try lime exchange. It has some escrow feature, not sure if that helps or what.

Code escrow is something that has been nagging me from multiple angles lately.

In fact I have one customer right now who wants an escrow clause in
their agreement that they can invoke on demand. They agree to pay the
annual fee of course and they have very limited rights to the source.

Unfortunately professional code escrow services seem unfairly
expensive to me. It's at least $500 USD per year.

But I'm wondering if there's a way to do this on-the-cheap. For
example, I would have no problem supplying customers with source
packages encrypted with something ridiculously hard to crack. Then all
I would need is a document that lists beneficiaries, the encryption
key, how to decrypt a package, do a Will, get it notarized and put it
all in a safe deposit box. There ya go - poor man's code escrow.

It's also serves as an extra offsite backup since presumably the
source packages would be pushed around to (or pulled by) different
customers on a regular basis.

Actually are you asking about code escrow or escrow of payment for services?

I know I'm late on this, but I finally got around to watching it and
found it pretty fascinating.

Agarwal mentions how including PHP files has a linear effect on
execution time. He also mentioned that PHP tends to become difficult
to manage when a project becomes really large. One of the ways that
developers tend to organize things would be distributing logic into
different files (most major frameworks are a good example of this) and
when you do that you start to take a performance hit. I wonder how
developers usually overcome that conundrum.

Interesting video, though, thanks for sharing.

I think this may have been mentioned in the presentation, but one way to
improve performance is to use an opcode cache like APC (with the stat check
turned off) so that the included files don't have to be recompiled every
single time.  The compilation of and the *stat() calls for the included
files are what takes the longest time.

Message-ID: <78c6bd860904221748t65c2f6d4m3b990a0bc777aadc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

A young family member has a domain that I used to host until I started
doing real business with credit cards and such at which point I had to
shut her down. So now I'm wondering if I can find somewhere cheap to
host her site where she can mess around with PHP and web design.

What do you recommend for cheap PHP hosting?

Also, what is the standard tool-chain for developing your HTML, PHP,
JavaScript and then uploading it to your site? I use vim, tar and scp
glued together with shell scripts but for her I'm hoping for a really
simple point-n-click experience.

She uses a Macbook.

Mike

A very plausible beginner production style: 

1) Photoshop. 
Design original site in Photoshop.
a) Photoshop has a learning curve, but once mastered sites that start in
Photoshop and use all the great styling and layering tools come out
looking more custom, unique and artistic. Plus, once Photoshop knowledge
is gained, those skills overflow into the ability to handle all digital
imagery manipulation needs both for personal and professional use.
b) Photoshop has Save for Web feature that can be set to a custom output
that includes XHTML, images, divs and layers positioned with CSS.

2) Dreamweaver. 
Handle site updates in Dreamweaver.
a) Dreamweaver has very sophisticated point and click interface,
excellent autocompletion, properties inspector, and code hints. Plus,
one can set up "websites" to catalog assets and have site updating,
where Dreamweaver automatically sends all new changes and needed assets
via FTP up to the actual site.

http://www.academicsuperstore.com
This site allows you to buy very deeply discounted fully licensed
software as long as you or someone in your family can prove you are in
any kind of school. 
Excellent academic pricing, as far as I have experienced. Go look at
Adobe Suite prices there.

http://www.lynda.com
See this site for a ton of free online video tutorials that will be
especially useful to a newbie. 
(You need to look hard for the freebies but they are there.)

For some lowest price web hosting on a shoestring with decent 24 hr.
tech support and plenty of online admin tools that will especially
educate and challenge the novice, you can just try GoDaddy. $4.99 per
mo. gets Linux, MySQL (4 or 5), and PHP (4 or 5), plus a ton of very
popular opensource projects (blog, photo gallery, etc.) that one can
"turn on and install" from the admin interface and then explore those
too.

I know there are plenty of alternatives, but these suggestions will do
in a pinch.

Warmest regards,

Hi,

A young family member has a domain that I used to host until I started
doing real business with credit cards and such at which point I had to
shut her down. So now I'm wondering if I can find somewhere cheap to
host her site where she can mess around with PHP and web design.

What do you recommend for cheap PHP hosting?

Also, what is the standard tool-chain for developing your HTML, PHP,
JavaScript and then uploading it to your site? I use vim, tar and scp
glued together with shell scripts but for her I'm hoping for a really
simple point-n-click experience.

She uses a Macbook.

Mike

PHP is just the server-side programming language that consumes and produces
XML.  This is akin to a web service in Java, .NET, etc.  This is a very
broad topic so you'd need to start investigating what your project requires
and ask specific questions, but you can start by looking at the various XML
support available in PHP:

I've been helping my mother's friend, who uses iWeb... it's total junk.  You
can even upload files to the right directory on the server (it always tries
to create a sub-directory, apparently).

I've been pretty happy with Media Temple (mt) -- they're grid service
is reasonably priced and seems compatible with visually-oriented
Mac-type people. It may be overkill for what you want to do, but it
will give her plenty of room to grow. Comes with snap-in WordPress and
other apps.

iWeb is great for point-click page composition, and of course it's
integreated with iPhoto, iMovie, and Garage Band. Like MySpace on
steroids!

Transmit is the best Mac SFTP/FTPS client for Mac if your hosting
provider doesn't support the WebDAV scheme that iWeb uses.

It also falls down when you want to move away from the built-in templates.

But come on, Dreamweaver is junky, too. If you want point-and-click
page creation, you're stuck with what any of us would consider a toy.
The pros design in Photoshop and then code templates by hand for some
CMS or another.

Yeah, but it's not really always a good solution either.

So way back, when Rasmus joined Yahoo, some of the big improvements that
came from their work on performance was improving and caching the various
stat types of calls.  This included lessening usage of things like
require_once() in favor of things like require().

APC takes it further (with the stat check turned off) by removing the disk
seeks, but there's still an execution path for including the actual file
(pulling in the code, checking to see if it's been included, etc).

What I'd really like is a way to "statically link" a PHP application.  While
this is somewhat possible today, PHP's dynamic nature makes this difficult
to fully realize.  For example, it can be cumbersome on the developer to
check in multiple places if APC is available, what files are cached, what
should be included, etc.

Rather, it'd be great if APC could set a flag that says all files are
included, and we can skip the big chunk of code that includes the other
source files.  Granted, it's more complicated than this, but hopefully it's
somewhat clear as to the overall concept.

You could take a page out of the javascript book and write a
pre-compiler that creates one big script using concatenation.

True - but then don't you get into a bootstrapping problem?  I suppose it could be managed to the point that you're only really reading one script off the disk (something that is auto_prepend, perhaps).  You would need some type of deployment script too I'd imagine.

It just seems that once APC has cached something in RAM, there should be a more straightforward way to know that, and thus get usage of it, rather than doing a standard include/require call.  But I do realize that the dynamic of PHP makes this difficult.

She's not looking to be a career developer. She's just doing this for
kicks at this point so I really need something free.

Is there a standard "Free" and "free" tool-chain?

Perfect. That definitely fits my budget.

How does GoDaddy compare to HostGator?

Actually I when I said "point and click" I did not mean to imply that
the actual code would be generated by point and click. I just meant
the save, upload and view cycle would ideally be a mostly point and
click experience as opposed to running things on the command line like
scp.

Again, since I use vim and ssh I'm not familiar with the standard
"Free" tool-chain so I'm trying to figure that out. What I'm thinking
should exist is something like the following:

1. An editor to write .php, .html, .css, .js files. I have no idea
what people use for an editor on Mac. What's the Mac equivalent of
Notepad? Is Eclipse good for this?

2. A way to upload / sync files. It would be great if this was built
into the editor so that she could just make some changes, hit "Upload"
and it would automatically sync the server with whatever files she
modified locally. If such a thing does not exist I suppose an sftp
with UI style program would do. I know there's something like that for
Windows but what is the Mac equivalent?

3. Debugging tools. Firebug, Burp proxy, ...?

If you're not married to point-and-click/WYSIWYG HTML authoring, I've  
recently become a pretty big fan of Coda, another product from the  
makers of Transmit:

http://www.panic.com/coda/

I pretty slick editor, with well-thought-out bells and whistles.  Nice  
preview mode via WebKit.  Built-in FTP/SFTP/WebDAV works fine.   
Integrates nicely with subversion.  Nice CSS editing facilities...  
Overall pretty nice.  I ponied up my $99 recently after using  
TextWrangler/CyberDuck or emacs for years and years.

For a stand-alone FTP client, Transmit seems to be the gold standard.   
I've never used it, myself, instead relying on the free, and adequate,  
CyberDuck: http://cyberduck.ch/

For someone young, it's probably not a bad idea to encourage writing  
markup by hand.

Coda is nice, also is easy to publish the sites with.  It does however  
require knowledge of hand coding sites, it's not a what you see is  
what you get.

Nice CSS editor also :)

Eclipse is probably overkill.

If you're looking for "Free" TextWrangler is the little brother of the  
venerable BBEdit:

http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/

No built-in preview, but command-tab/command-R to Safari or Firefox  
works just fine.

TextWrangler supports Open/Save to FTP/SFTP very well.

Coda (mentioned in my last email) supports that syncing stuff, I  
think.  I personally never use that kind of functionality.  I either  
develop locally and move changes to a server via subversion, or  
develop "directly" on a remote machine via sftp.

> 3. Debugging tools. Firebug, Burp proxy, ...?

Firebug pretty much does nearly everything one might need, in my  
experience.

Couldn't you could write a shell script that runs the various commands 
needed (rsync, scp, etc).  Put that shell script on the desktop (or 
wherever) that the user can then click on.  Voila!  Point and click 
uploading!  Plus your daughter will get to know the wonders of shell 
scripting.

Bear in mind I have a free open source mind bent.

A lot of developers on Mac use TextMate (especially the Ruby crowd) but 
its not free. Ive also tried TextWrangler which is similar to BBEdit. Im a 
vi guy and MacVim is pretty good. (Advantage of learning vi/vim is that's 
available on practially every platform known to man and damn useful when 
you need to ssh into a server and fix something fast).

For visual editing, you might want to look at Kompozer (I dont know if Nvu 
is still around - anyone?). Hopefully, in the future something like the 
BeSpin project from Mozilla will bear fruit...

Someone mentioned Transmit (I agree, its pretty good). Im happy with 
Cyberduck (free).

> 3. Debugging tools. Firebug, Burp proxy, ...?

I use Firefox with Firebug and FirePHP. The Web Developer toolbar is a 
must-install too. And I love Mozilla's Ubiquity - Ive written my own 
commands for it.

This list tends to beat up on Dreamweaver all the time. But, note I am
not suggesting that Dreamweaver is to be used to code or manage complex
PHP web applications. 

But for creating web sites / web pages, I have not come across a better
turned out user interface than Dreamweaver.

I go and look at all the free/shareware/opensource/commercial
(semi-graphical interface) products every year or so. I download,
install with all my wits and calculating nerve, then grippingly study
the vast overload of poorly documented competitive plugins that all do
some of this or some of that, then I install the plugins and then I go
and get the dependencies for the plugins (and discover the odd bit of
code has not been updated since '05 and was never made for my operating
system and was unstable the whole time anyway); then I install all the
exotic stuff -  which you will need to do - don?t think you won't - to
really shape up the product's user experience and then it still isn't as
singularly cohesive and organized as Dreamweaver. And now you have to
study forums and foreign language blogs deep into the night and the next
morning to look for answers that only obliquely address the yet
unsolved, undocumented quirk that stops you now. 

I have sampled the dedicated XML tools, specialized CSS editors (which
you will rarely - almost never - need if you know your CSS yourself).
Yep, Tidy is great but frankly I only needed it one time 5 years ago. 

Don?t get me wrong I can hand code and yes I can perform at the command
prompt too with a little UNIX cheat book at my elbow. 

But, dude, I am telling you that other than in this narrow very vertical
world of hard corps programmers; I have never been in an agency or
studio or talked to another contemporary web slinger (and by a web
slinger I mean someone who also actually uses and programs Flash, let's
say) where I ever heard the word Eclipse or BBEdit or, OMG, Notepad get
mentioned as a serious tool of the trade. Not even in the most dark back
room data center with dust clogged cables running in and out of routers
and across coffee stained carpet, nope not even there.

Dreamweaver is the de facto web design product used out there everywhere
in the cold free world. 

And one should learn it first and then decide personally and only when
knocking out a job (under pressure and while commuting) on your PDA
souped up with a web server and MySQL database. Then maybe you gotta
program in Notepad. 

Viva Adobe mis amigos who went from a great company to a cool great
company when they bought Macromedia out from under Microsoft.

Perfect. That definitely fits my budget.

How does GoDaddy compare to HostGator?

Based on the nvu website the *nix version of Nvu is KompoZer, so thez appear 
to be about the same. And yes, Nvu is a nice tool as well.

I would agree, but add that that's true for web DESIGNERs. No serious PHP 
/ Ruby / Java guys use Dreamweaver for writing CODE and web apps are more 
than just design.

Mozilla Composer was my personal favorite. All of the editing features
and a clean professional GUI, for free. Wrote beautiful code, too.

I'm currently converting a site with ~400 obsessively Dreamweavered
pages, and I'm seeing spaghetti code that makes MSHTML look
well-formed. We're talking <font><b><br></b><font></font></font> here,
in every possible nesting combination. And I can't just tidy out the
font tags, because font size was used instead of <h2> and <h3> for
headings.

Dreamweaver's main strength, to me, was its ftp client. Much easier to
use than WS_FTP or Fetch or even modern clients like WinSCP or
Transmit. But as an editor for markup? Harmful.

I totally agree. But I think at least with CS3 (maybe a little earlier),
Dreamweaver has become more respectful of your existing indenting and
spaces. But alas it will go and format to old world HTML indenting style
if you give it a chance.

I would agree, but add that that's true for web DESIGNERs. No serious
PHP 
/ Ruby / Java guys use Dreamweaver for writing CODE and web apps are
more 
than just design.

That is absolutely true, mostly. If the user does a lot of selecting of
text in Design mode and then applies numerous styles one can get back
mixed up overformatted output from Dreamweaver. But, I've noted that the
application has gotten pretty smart about consolidating redundant
overlapped styles. And, yes, if you let Dreamweaver write code for you
(like rotating divs or a menu), it will dish out some indecipherable
clogged up language. I never use that stuff myself. But, I feel that
every time I have seen a project with the automatic MM code snippets,
they are good, solid, and cross platform.

Meanwhile, I'd like to take a moment to thank all the fine people who
brought us "jquery". As of late I am trying to use jquery for
everything. And the cross platform, browser independent nature of it
seems awesome. 

Seems over the last two years that client side scripting has just broken
out into fresh new heights and every cool, gee-whiz gimmick (slideshows,
dissolves, zoom, drag and drop, sort, mapping) that used to take days or
weeks to painstakingly sculpt can be knocked out in 15 min. and work
just excellently.

I have seen some mac people use software that mounts a remote folder
over ssh/sftp as a drive.  I personally just use the command line, but
does anyone know of a good free tool to mount remote file systems?  I
did a quick search and found MacFuse, but that looks like overkill.

Standalone FTP programs seem ridiculous these days.

OS X Finder will mount WebDAV and SMB/CIFS (Windows) shares. maybe some others.

MacFUSE is indeed the tool to use if you want to mount filesystems via
ssh, it's pretty handy but not 100% stable. Then again, nothing in
Finder is 100% stable...

Hans, can you give more detail  what you mean by statically link a PHP
application and how it's possible to do it?  I'm interested in hearing about
that.

Nick, not to make you repost, but we do have a Zend Framework list that
would be best suited for this type of discussion (and in the interest of
getting some traffic going over there).

http://lists.nyphp.org/mailman/listinfo/zendframework

Subscribe there if you could and repost - I know personally some folks on
that list are experts in this specific arena.

Its popular but that's because its Zend. Personally, I call it an 
unframework because to me its just a library of components...

I'm not sure if you're casting ZF in a negative light but personally I
much prefer a library of independent components over a framework. Some
Zend Framework components are crap but I can choose not to use those
components whereas with a framework I'm committed to using the crap
even if the rest of it is great.

Depends on the framework doesn't it. Some allow you to replace parts with 
your own layers if you want. But as you confirm, 'Zend Framework' is thus 
a misnomer.

I totally agree. Every week there's some new plugin or effect for it. 
Definately nicer than Scriptaculous and more actively developed.

Now that we've gotten nice and OT here, I might add that the number of
JQuery plugins that do x is a little overwhelming. Want a tooltip thingy? 25

The Protype vs JQuery debate strikes me as religious. Both are class acts,

...and some of them don't work so good.

I found myself settling on jQuery UI and then trying to do minimal 
additions, this gave some sense of stability.

Well the tool-chain I ended up using was:

1. GoDaddy.com for hosting for $4.75/mo with a 1yr payment.
2. TextWrangler for editing files directly on the server or locally
3. Transmit for uploading, downloading, renaming and deleting files and so on

She hasn't tried it yet but I was able to do everything that I think
someone would need to do.

Thanks,
Mike

Or MochiKit, which has been making JavaScript suck less since 2005.

They all do almost the same thing, in mostly the same way, but
everyone gets to find their favorite flavor. The main thing is that if
you're still writing js without a framework, you're working way too
hard.

Oh -- Javascript is inherently suckish! Now I understand why it gives me
trouble sometimes. I still don't understand how the hell to write class
definitions. Seems there's more than one way and they're all odd.

But that's ok, don't even try to teach me. Lest we digress from the
digression.

I hadn't heard about TextWrangler before now. What (besides the low
low price) made that the one to use?

Also, I can't believe no one mentioned Apple's Developer Tools. XCode
is actually quite a nice free editor for markup and css.

Just because someone mentioned it and it worked.

I must admit I've never actually used Transmit, but what made you  
choose it over the free CyberDuck?

I know I gravitated towards it when I first went back to using a Mac  
because I had fond memories of using BBEdit years ago.

BBEdit has a great slogan, btw: "It doesn't suck."  Once upon a time,  
it was the only decent programmer's editor on the mac platform.

So when I first picked up a MacBook Pro a few years back, I went  
looking for BBEdit, noticed there was this free TextWrangler thing,  
and gave it a shot.  It's got a nice feature set, while remaining  
fairly lightweight, and it just works.

I tried going to Eclipse a few times, but i always found myself  
fighting over one thing or another (managing remote files was a big  
one).  So I went back to TextWrangler.

These days, I still use TextWrangler daily for quick changes via SFTP  
to remote systems.

For real development work, running on my local AMP stack, it's usually  
Coda (for the past few weeks)

Javascript gave me fits until I dug through some of the younger tikes' 
code, and ended up writing this blog entry on "Javascript as a foreign

The fact that JQuery doesn't have JSON encoding/decoding built in makes 
me think Prototype has their act together a bit more.

While there are a lot of library components in ZF, there really is a

Subject: [nycphp-talk] LEMP?
Message-ID: <0016e6476e622bc27504685af84f@google.com>

Hey, all, new to the mailing list (really, the first email I've sent :D).

I was wondering if anyone had any experience using the EMP (nginx, mysql,  
php) instead of the AMP stack, specifically using php-fpm as a process  
manager?

I've read some pretty impressive benchmarks:  
http://www.yawn.it/2008/04/30/nginx-php-php-fpm-on-debian-etch-40/ and  
recently got it compiled and have been playing with it. It seems great, but  
I was wondering if there were any suggestions, warnings, weird behaviors,  
etc. that I should be aware of. To date, I've only noticed one thing,  
namely that $_SERVER['HTTPS'] isn't set when using SSL (easy enough to  
workaround) but do I need to keep my eye out for anything else?

A customer asked for a project quotation while we are making the deal (for
accurate quotation)

and thanks Mr David I did it before and it didn't return me any good
results.

And I found now that Microsoft dynamics AX do this and I decided to give it
a try.

Thank you all for your interest

Thanks, point taken, but wouldn't one need some more info to give a reasonable 
response other than RTFM...or lmgtfy. I guess the issue is resolved by now. 
Keep in mind, I am German and need context, not just bullet points. ;)

Thanks for the responses.  I am looking at Zend Framework since it supports
i5/OS.  But what I really want is to easily handle multiple forms on one
page.  Any examples of this would be much appreciated.  BTW Hans, I have
posted to the zendframework forum but I think I'm the only one there.

Well, honestly, I'm not 100% sure either :)  It's not an easily solvable
problem.

>From the Facebook talk, and other comments I've heard in general, PHP's
highly dynamic nature is a good thing and a bad thing.  While flexible,
there is the overhead, both from a I/O perspective and from a internals
perspective.  As applications become large, as the gentlemen from Facebook
pointed out, it gets increasingly difficult to manage and optimize all those
PHP files.

I suppose fundamentally, each PHP source file is its own program in a sense.
It could be executed (with whatever result) as its own script, ie, the
classic .php vs .inc problem in the document root.  As a result, it's the
responsibility of the programmer - or framework in some cases - to ensure
these code files are put together in the correct way - and for EVERY
request.  This is tedious.

The flip side, of course, is a compiled language, where this assembly of the
program is done beforehand.  It seems as though (and again, this is very
ballpark), that some happy medium could be done.

For example, let's look at a APC use case.
  -- the first request of an application is performed after a server restart

  -- the APC cache is empty, so the application realizes this and
requires/includes files as needed to fulfill the request

  -- in a well written application, there will always be some of the same
set of assembly required

  -- on subsequent requests, this assembly, however, is still always
performed.  Granted, it's improved because the source files are being read
from memory and cached, but the legwork is there still.

What might be useful, would be the ability to store the block of cached code
as a single entity - let's call it a "library" for example.  Upon subsequent
requests, the application would already have this core already available
with a single "link" statement, rather than having to do the legwork each
time of assembling all the blocks.

Perhaps, afterall, it's more of a dynamic link model? :)  Hopefully, though,
this makes some sense.  At the end of the day, as applications get larger
and more complex, there's always a common set of code that's needed.  While
some things in the PHP world have attempted to help manage this, I guess it
comes down to - maybe compiling PHP isn't such a bad thing :)

There's a learning curve, no doubt, but they've got the active development

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Best practices for naming conventions & coding style?
Message-ID: <49F61AE1.2080708@nopersonal.info>

Hi everyone,

I've been making steady (if slow) progress with my understanding of
PHP/MySQL, but now that I'm finally starting to do more complex things,
I find that I really need to figure out a consistent naming convention &
coding style. I've read several articles on the subject and they all
seem to be different.

Is there a de facto professional standard, or is it just whatever you
personally prefer (provided that you're not part of a larger team with
specific guidelines)? So far I'm doing the following:

-Functions are all lower case, no numbers, underscores used to separate
words
-Variables (same as functions--should they be different?)
-Constants and MySQL reserved words & functions are all upper case
-Classes... I'm not that advanced yet!
-Plenty of comments to help me remember what the code was for
-Tabs for indentation
-No echoing HTML code except where moving between it and PHP is too messy
-Stick with single quotes for string literals where there are no
variable substitutions and/or where there ARE variable substitutions,
but where using double quotes would necessitate lots of escaping

Two things I've read about that I don't do are 1.) put spaces before &
after the string concatenator, and 2.) keep my opening/closing braces on
their own lines.


//I find it much easier to read:

if ($foo == '') {
    echo '<p id="message" class="error">'.$message.'</p>';
} else {
    echo '<p id="message" class="success">'.$message.'</p>';
}

//Than:

if ($foo == '')
{
    echo '<p id="message" class="error">' . $message . '</p>';
}
else
{
    echo '<p id="message" class="success">' . $message . '</p>';
}

Are any of the things I'm doing/not doing a major no-no? It's not too
late for me to unlearn bad habits, so I'd really appreciate any advice
you could give.

Thanks,

Bev

I think this is more of a comfort issue then an issue with standards.  If
you work for a company that you would fall back to the company's best
practice's.  If you are doing freelance/consulting work then you fallback to
your own CONSISTENT practices.

I emphasize consistent because when you open up a file in VIM that was
edited with tabs one week vs. two spaces for indents another week it becomes
a real nightmare.

For your own work, find one that works for you and stick with it.

If you're looking for suggestions, I tend to use a modified PEAR coding 
style--with a just a handful of exceptions where they got stupid--when I 
write PHP. It's a lot like K&R/1TBS, so it's comfortable to me... And it 
helps that several of the projects I work on have compatible coding 
standards.

See:

Often if you're using a framework, you might have to use the framework's 
naming conventions.

Apart from that, stick with consistently with whatever you're comfortable 
with.

Because in that regards, if you ask five people you will get seven opinions. 
Just watch the responses. ;)
It is good that you realized that and took action. That is the biggest step 
forward.

Not that I know of, unless you are in a particular camp. That means the DotNet 
folks use the Microsoft bible of coding and often enough violate their own rules.

Yep, I'd handle them the same way. As important is that you give them 
meaningful names. I once had a coworker who used his first and last name as 
variable names for everything. He'd even write code to change the type from 
string to integer. Don't do crap like that. Modern IDEs have 
autocomplete/intellisense and there is really no reason to be that 
self-centered. Also, I find a $counter to be way clearer than a $i, although 
the $i, $j, $k, $l ... approach is very common.

With MySQL reserved words you mean SQL? Yep, I do the same.

Same here...also applies to objects. I do use some for handling zip files, but 
that is limited to copying sample code.

Exactly! What I do is write the comments first and ideally do it as detailed 
as possible. Then I fill in the code, which for me is the easiest way.

Yep!

See, here I differ, but that is just me. I rather echo HTML than deal with the 
opening and closing tags, which I find confusing in a sense that I have a 
tought time finding where PHP is and where HTML is. Again, this is purely 
personal preference and if you are OK with the way you do it, stick with it, 
it is faster.
Also, keep in mind that you should separate display from process. So first do 
all the PHP magic and stick everything ready to go into variables, then make a 
big line and below that start the output. On very rare occasions I had to 
divert from that, but I am sure that is simply because I'm inexperienced and 
that there is a better way.

Uhhh, you may want to dig through the archives of this list. Some time ago we 
had a very passionate discussion about it and if I recall correctly, everyone 
was right a bit and wrong a little.

I do it the same way, but I can see that it adds more white space and thus 
makes things easier to read. It also separates "code" lines from "control 
characters", if you know what I mean. Again, do what works best for you, the 
PHP interpretor doesn't care either way.

I know it is just an example, but I'd double or triple the commentary in the 
code above. A one liner may be OK for you, but others will appreciate the 
detail and what is clear to you today may not be that clear in six months from 
now.

I think with writing this all up you did yourself the best favor. Now stick to 
your own coding guidelines and add lots of commentary. Again, modern IDEs help 
out with that, because you can craft templates for if..else or switch 
statements or new files and already have the basic commentary lines in place. 
You are definitely on the right track.

Suggest pear style for your code.  I stick with Ruby'ish style for naming my
sql stuff.

table : locations
field: location

Sticking with something that simple can save you DAYS of headaches~!


seems to work out well.

Plural-names for tables are a pain...

field: person
table: ???

Is it persons or people or something else?

Yep.  Plus it makes consistency very easy and makes life easier by 
allowing the use of USING.

person
------
person_id
first_name
last_name
company_id
...

company
-------
company_id
company_name

etc

Very interesting topic.

My thoughts.

Name functions and variables meaningfully so that you enhance readability.  Don't be afraid 
of "too long" names, within reason.

Indenting is important but not worth going insane over.
Camelcase leads to frustrating typing errors and is just silly in most cases.  Use all lower, or 
even underscores are less annoying.  But be consistent.  Or try to be.

Lastly anyone who tries to impose THEIR conventions on you is to be ignored.  This is all 
about you, and what widget YOU think is easiest to use.  Worrying about where to put a 
curly bracket is not worth it -- put it where you like it!  As long as the code works you are 
golden.

Happy coding!! :)

Absolutely right. Ignore everyone who tries to impose their conventions

Unless, of course, they're telling you to use the One True Brace Style :)

If you're working on your own, sure.  But if you're on a team, then 
everyone on the team needs to follow the same convention.

A quick google search for "windows run process in background" yielded:

"In case anyone has this problem in future, I finally found out the
solution. The START command in Windows command line allows you to
start another command window running any command; and the /B option
can start the command without the extra command window, so you get
similar behavior to Unix's background processes. Look it up for more
details."

I don't use windows, but I trigger background processes with and "&"
in *nix, and it looks like windows offers the same functionality with
"start /b"

John Campbell

But in that scheme, in order to join tables, you have to use an ON syntax
   JOIN companies ON (companies.id = employees.company_id)
rather than the more elegant USING syntax
   JOIN companies USING (company_id)

Plus it causes the use of different words for table vs field names, 
making it harder to guess/remember what a given identifier's name is and 
results in hacks when implementing automated schema tools.

I just kind of like:  delete from companies where id = 1;

I think this is more of a rails syntax.  just so zen simple!  but everyone
comes up with their best naming. we are all different, as long as it's
consistent.

I never use person as a field name.   Leads to confusion. I think you can be
a bit more specific then that.

I look at source code for naming conventions, how does mediawiki do it
(wikipedia)?  pear things, oracle code. CSS for major sites (NYTs), etc.
Yes, even google, but they are a bit looser in naming conventions, which may
be ok. too rigid and u can shoot yourself.

I'm really an ObjC guy (iPhone), where u really have monster long names, a
smalltalk feature grafted onto c++.

:-)

Yeah, ObjC is just one step away from obfuscated Perl :-)

The only problem with this is when in a team and different members work on 
the same bits of code. Can you imagine a class written in two or three 
different bracing styles is like?! Your team HAS to agree on some 
standards and stick to them. Some of these might go against your own 
personal grain but such is the price of teamwork and consistent code.

So no, a free-for-all is not always good advice.

To be fair, despite the talk about what's best or what isn't, in the end it
really doesn't matter what the code looks like, given two things. One, most
importantly, it works (well).  And two, it's consistent.  It doesn't matter
if your variables are named $like_this or $likeThis as long as it's one and
not both :)

Doctrine_View is able to handle views in any DBMS.

Also, you can manually map the view if you want to work on updatable
views, just like Oracle supports.

Stored procedures works on the fly, just like a common function call.
Doctrine does something like that:
In case DQL can interpret it, apply the custom workarounds, otherwise,
just bypass it to DBMS driver.

If not enough, you can use Doctrine_RawSql to create your custom DBMS
specific call, when DQL is not smart enough to handle the query
(something like UNIONS or SELECT of a selected query table: SELECT *
FROM (SELECT ...))

If you need more guidance on it, feel free to subscribe to
doctrine-user or doctrine-dev mailing lists.
We also have IRC channel at freenode #doctrine and a forum in the website.

Finally... manual have been updated a lot recently. We're releasing a
printed version in the next couple of weeks.

Re your friend, yikes! I know what you mean about using $counter. I
figured out that $i or $n stands for an integer, but it still throws me
off sometimes when I see something like $l in someone's example code
(below)... what is the "l" supposed to stand for? Or does it depend on
the context? I still have to "translate" code by reading out loud to
myself line-by-line and noting what it does in a comment. Here's a
snippet of some example code I got somewhere for exporting to a CSV file
where I added my own translation:

<snip>
//get results form db
$results = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM foo") or die(mysql_error());
//$out?? Maybe $output?
$out = '';
//retrieve field info from table--mysql_list_fields() appears to be
deprecated?
$fields = mysql_list_fields('db_name','table_name',$conn);
//get the number of MySQL fields in the table and assign that value to
$columns
$columns = mysql_num_fields($fields);
//set counter to 0, as long as it is less than the number of $columns,
increment it by 1
for ($i = 0; $i < $columns; $i++) {
//name each field--why $l?
$l = mysql_field_name($fields, $i);
//huh?
$out .= '"'.$l.'",';
}
<snip>

Obviously I didn't quite get what every line did, but I usually figure
it out on my own (eventually).

Yep, I meant SQL. I understand the distinction, but I guess in my head
the two are interchangeable since MySQL the only thing I'm remotely
familiar with. :)

Oh man, speaking of reserved words, a couple of weeks ago I was stuck
for almost half a day trying to figure out why one of my queries kept
throwing errors (it doesn't help that the error messages are so darned
enigmatic). Anyway, after about 6 hours of picking at the query trying
to figure out why it refused to work when others with the same syntax
worked fine, something that had been nibbling at the edge of my
consciousness finally rose to the surface--I had named one of the fields
in my table "desc" (for description). I was like, "Wait a minute...
desc... DESC... OMG, that's a reserved word--what a stupid newbie
mistake!!" *headdesk, headdesk, headdesk* Suffice it to say that I won't
be making THAT mistake again.

I'm (somewhat) embarrassed to admit in present company that I do most of
my PHP in Dreamweaver as I know most of you probably think that's pretty
lame. But I'm comfortable with DW, you know? Most of the PHP I do
involves working around the HTML in web pages, and I have my own
snippets for stuff I use frequently. I know how to hand code, but seeing
as how may keyboarding skills have always been deplorable, I find it
much easier to use DW's split mode (code on one side, wysiwyg on the
other) to navigate through the code. Not only that, but CS4 has some
nice new features for working with code. Aside from code completion, I
don't use any of the PHP stuff that DW provides (server behaviors,
bindings. etc.)  as the code it creates confuses me and puts stuff where
I'd rather not have it (I'm a control freak when it comes to
understanding what's going on). IOW, I basically use DW as a glorified
text editor.

I have a copy of phpDesigner, but I don't use it as much as I probably
should. I guess I should explore it more as it might have features I'm
unaware of that'll save me time (especially where debugging is
concerned). I tried a couple of open source IDEs, but didn't stick with
any of them. I hate anything Java-based because of the system resources
it eats up, so Eclipse was out (though I have a strong front-end coding
background, my primary job function is that of graphic designer, so I
tend have a ton of other resource hogging things  running in the
background most of the time). Komodo Edit was nice, but missing many
features of the IDE version...Since  I'm still not experienced enough to
be able to take on the heavy-duty back-end stuff, I don't really feel
comfortable trying to justify the purchase price of something like that
to my employer.

Okay, I've prattled on far too long! Thanks for the advice.

 i've heard about doctrine and i am not working with it, and i love and hate it.? i think once you spend the time to set it up (minus certain quirks with doctrine migrations),? it will do a pretty decent job, but if you have a large (and i mean large) database, you'll can spend a good amount of time creating your models before you start doing actual php coding.

the point being, is if i were to start a project and if i deemed it worthy to use doctrine as the model in an mvc style project, then it's great (esp for migrations), but if i had an existing huge database and you wanted to refactor the project and wanted minimal development time with great results, i would lean more towards using a framework like codeigniter.? minimal model defining and rapid development with fairly great retrieval of data, and method chaining.

it all depends on the situation

Doctrine_View is able to handle views in any DBMS.

Also, you can manually map the view if you want to work on updatable
views, just like Oracle supports.

Stored procedures works on the fly, just like a common function call.
Doctrine does something like that:
In case DQL can interpret it, apply the custom workarounds, otherwise,
just 
bypass it to DBMS driver.

If not enough, you can use Doctrine_RawSql to create your custom DBMS
specific call, when DQL is not smart enough to handle the query
(something like UNIONS or SELECT of a selected query table: SELECT *
FROM (SELECT ...))

If you need more guidance on it, feel free to subscribe to
doctrine-user or doctrine-dev mailing lists.
We also have IRC channel at freenode #doctrine and a forum in the website.

Finally... manual have been updated a lot recently. We're releasing a
printed version in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks, Edward (and Dan & Daniel as well).

I recently discovered the hard way how easily field names can give you

Specially for people like you, Doctrine provide a couple of CLI tasks
that can do a lot of things.

For example... you can define your models into an YAML file, and simply call:

php ./doctrine.php generate-models-yaml

It'll generate all models based on the YAML schema.
Then, simply do:

php ./doctrine.php generate-sql

And you'll have an optimized SQL file in the specified folder... or,
if you want to automatically apply the SQLs in DB...

php ./doctrine.php build-all-reload

This task will create models from YAML, execute the SQLs in DB and
also import any basic import data that is defined through fixtures. To
import only the fixtures:

php ./doctrine.php load-data


There're some people that already have some legacy code (like you) and
wants to migrate to Doctrine. The CLI command of Doctrine provide one
specific command to grab everything from your DB and generate the
models automatically.

php ./doctrine.php generate-models-db

The only issue with this command is the relations between each table,
which cannot be built automatically, since the DESC TABLE XXX may
different between all supported DBMS, aswell in the same DBMS, each
version may be different. We could not make it be built automatically.


Currently Doctrine is in version 1.1.0, we're about to release 1.1.1.
Also we'll release 1.0.9, which is our LTS (Long Term/Time Support)
version.

Manual is full of details about CLI tasks... to configure the CLI task
is quite trivial... a 15 lines scripts and you have all the power of
Doctrine at the palm of your hands.


BTW... I'm one of the core developers of Doctrine if you didn't notice! =D

Would love to know what everyone's experiences were with
nginx-vs-lighttpd, as both seem to basically achieve the same exact
thing while being separate projects. Is there a reason you chose nginx
over lighttpd?

Im using symfony and I know a lot of these tasks are available through the 
symfony CLI tool. But Im new to Doctrine in symfony (still learning it).

Are there any examples of using MySQL views and stored procedures from 
within symfony?

Love migrations but I think the Jobeet tutorial doesn't talk about that.

Subject: Re: [nycphp-talk] ORM that uses more advanced MySQL features










Specially for people like you, Doctrine provide a couple of CLI tasks
that can do a lot of things.

For example... you can define your models into an YAML file, and simply call:

php ./doctrine.php generate-models-yaml

It'll generate all models based on the YAML schema.
Then, simply do:

php ./doctrine.php generate-sql

And you'll have an optimized SQL file in the specified folder... or,
if you want to automatically apply the SQLs in DB...

php ./doctrine.php build-all-reload

This task will create models from YAML, execute the SQLs in DB and
also import any basic import data that is defined through fixtures. To
import only the fixtures:

php ./doctrine.php load-data


There're some people that already have some legacy code (like you) and
wants to migrate to Doctrine. The CLI command of Doctrine provide one
specific command to grab everything from your DB and generate the
models automatically.

php ./doctrine.php generate-models-db

The only issue with this command is the relations between each table,
which cannot be built automatically, since the DESC TABLE XXX=2
0may
different between all supported DBMS, aswell in the same DBMS, each
version may be different. We could not make it be built automatically.


Currently Doctrine is in version 1.1.0, we're about to release 1.1.1.
Also we'll release 1.0.9, which is our LTS (Long Term/Time Support)
version.

Manual is full of details about CLI tasks... to configure the CLI task
is quite trivial... a 15 lines scripts and you have all the power of
Doctrine at the palm of your hands.


BTW... I'm one of the core developers of Doctrine if you didn't notice! =D

The usage of Doctrine will never be found on Symfony tutorials... you
can probably find a couple of examples in the Doctrine manual.

Nice to meet you too!!!

I just can't remember why I joined the mailing list... I'm from S?o
Paulo, Brazil! =) IIRC, it was due to good discussions on this list.

I had a view reasons, not really anything ground shaking.

1.) nginx is much more actively developed than lightty.
2.) One of the people that recommended it to me was/is a blackhat and I tend
to take security advice from blackhats very, very seriously.
3.) nginx is growing more and more popular, lightty less and less, and this
matters a lot in FOSS software (more users = more contributors) :
http://survey.netcraft.com/Reports/200901/
http://survey.netcraft.com/Reports/200902/
http://survey.netcraft.com/Reports/200903/
http://survey.netcraft.com/Reports/200904/
4.) There's a ton of colloquial evidence of lightty's memleak issues.
5.) One of the things I hated most about Apache was writing and maintaining
server configuration (were it not for the semi-decent default configurations
that ship with most distributions, I don't know if anyone could ever figure
out how to write one.  Lightty's configuration isn't much better, but
nginx's is ridiculously easy and I loved that immediately.

Nothing really major, but enough to pull me over to the nginx side.

Its mainly a historical thing. The same way every first program says 
'Hello World'. Even when I was a kid learning BASIC, popular programming 
books still used i, j and k (or I%, J% and K% in BBC BASIC :-)

I've had luck in the past with:

$shell = new COM('WScript.Shell');
$shell->Run('php.exe -f child.php',0,false);

The additional parameters basically tell it to skip creating a window
and not wait for the command to return.

Hope this helps,

Michael,
I don't know how much control you have over the webserver, but have you 
looked at the PCNTL extension? I've played around with it a while ago, 
and it works very nicely. I've only used it in a LAMP environment, but 
it should do the same in a WAMP environment.

Sadly, the PCNTL extension is not available for Windows.

When I try to include a php from a remote server, I get the following error:

 

URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration.

 

Does anyone know how to configure the server to allow remote access?

 

Thank you,

I generally in my code do not access an external server for include and
include_once or require_once functions.  But I believe
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/features.remote-files.php can steer you in the
right direction.

Well the fact that jQuery plays nice with the namespace compared to 
scriptaculous drew me to it...

There is never a valid reason to include remote files, but if you
really want to do it, just enable allow_url_fopen and
allow_url_include

I always get this warning message on one php page:

"

Warning: Unknown: Your script possibly relies on a session side-effect which existed until PHP 4.2.3. Please be advised that the session extension does not consider global variables as a source of data, unless register_globals is enabled.

How to fix this issue?php problem or apache web server problem?I have no clue.

 

Thanks in advance!

Found this from googling the first sentance:
http://www.spiration.co.uk/post/1231/Your%20script%20possibly%20relies%20on%20a%20session%20side-effect

Apparently you're trying to assign a global variable into the session
directly. Of course, if you could provide some sort of code, we could
help out a bit more.

You say you've got this isolated down to one PHP page... have you
tried working down the code line-by-line to see what ends up throwing
the error?

That's almost always right.

Aside from some very, very narrow circumstances, this is a bad, bad,  
bad, idea.

Even when it's not an awful idea, it should still make you very nervous.

Hmm, this is a good question.  I know this can happen on Linux/Apache as
well.  Basically there's always a problem forking from apache because of
various file descriptors/etc. which are held onto within the forked PHP
process.  If you do decide to fork, read:

http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=107247844327956&w=2

And specifically the code around "Need to fork so apache doesn't kill us".
Effectively, you need to close down and reopen all filedes that are
inherited into the PHP process, otherwise you get the hang problem you
describe.  Search around also for forking from an apache module as there are
other resources on this.

The other option would be to simply execute a batch file which queues and
returns immediately.  Another independent process could be the queue runner.
This is more of an "async" way doing this type of thing, and actually may be
preferred for scalability and flexibility reasons.

This was one of the narrow circumstances where it might be a very practical
idea because we're dealing with over 800 portals.  There was some
nervousness over the decision.  But, it would have made maintenance
practical.

But, some of the code contained ajax, so we couldn't do it, anyway, which
sucks for the person maintaining the portals.

Well not to beat on a dead horse but has anyone ever found a good use for
this (Other than Michele's need for this.)?  I have never designed/developed
any piece of software in PHP to access its code base via an external server.

Amen to that. I left prototype/scriptaculous for the same reason:
rather than provide an enhanced calls in their own namespace, it
redefines javascript itself. When mixed with legacy code, unintended
results ensue.

Also, I couldn't stand to type scriptaculous any more. Meh.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Help with a CakePHP View
Message-ID: <a9caffe50904300810m614bd4bcxb102396671e2181@mail.gmail.com>

We have inherited a Cake app that needs to be up and running by the
end of next week. I downloaded the application and installed it
locally. While running through testing, I discovered that some things
work, and some don't. The particular piece of code that is being
troublesome is this:

$whereClause = '`District`.`id` = "' .
$this->mrClean->sql($this->passedArgs[0]) . '"';
$this->set('district', $this->District->find($whereClause));

$this->passedArgs[0] is an integer, the ID of the record.

If I remove $whereClause from the second line, the view works. But I
get the first record from the database. If I leave it in there, I get
a blank page. I have set debugging to 3, so that if the view works, I
see the SQL query, but that doesn't do me a bit of good if I can't see
why the query seems to fail when an ID is passed.

Any ideas? This should not be this difficult, which only adds to the
frustration. The exact same structure works on other data models, but
not this District model.

DRY! DRY! DRY!

Try something like this:

$cart_keys = array(
'mouse_choice','monitor_choice','wifi_choice','subtotal','offsets','amount','desc','first_name','last_name','address','city','state','zip','phone','billeve','email','ship_to_first_name','ship_to_last_name','ship_to_address','ship_to_city','ship_to_state','ship_to_zip','shipday','card_num','exp_date','card_code');

foreach($cart_keys as $key) {
  if($_POST[$key])
    $_SESSION[$key] = $_POST[$key];
}

// load the keys as variables, not really needed because the values
already exist in  _SESSION.
extract(array_intersect_key($_SESSION,array_flip($cart_keys)));

I'll bet you a beer that it's because there's no record in the database 
with a matching record.  So that means either $this->passedArgs[0] isn't 
being set or is set to a value that doesn't equal a value in the 
District.id column of the table.

You owe me a beer:)

I've checked all of that. What's even more strange is that I found out
that for 3 of the 20 records the view will actually work. The others,
no luck. I have tried all sorts of options on this and simply cannot
discover why the view fails in most cases. I even tried this:

$this->District->findById(35); //which works
$this->District->findById(141); //which fails

However, if I do this:

$this->District->query("select * from districts as District where id='35'");

or:

$this->District->query("select * from districts as District where id='141'");

Both of those work, but it gives me the data in an array that doesn't
work with the data structure that has been set up.

So chances are the data inside the table is the problem, not the query.  
Do a very careful comparison of a record that works vs one that doesn't.

A possibility is that the query is doing an (inner) JOIN rather than a 
(outer) LEFT JOIN and there's no matching record in the joined table?

Have you put a debug statement inside the framework at the point just 
before the query is actually sent to the database (you know, like a 
mysqli_query() call)?  That way you can see the SQL the framework has 
composed.  Then you can run that SQL manually and see what comes up.

If that doesn't reveal anything, you'll need to break out a debugger and 
step through the code of a working district id and a non-working district 
id to see what the difference is.

Yeah, already did that too. I even modified the *broken* record to see
if I could get it to work. No luck.

That is what I thought as well, but I haven't been able to find any such issue.

That's what I need, but I've had a heck of a time figuring out just
where that is.

The big problem here is that the person that wrote it didn't break out
the models for the data appropriately. There is one Admin model that
handles several different types of data, and I'm fairly certain
something is getting crossed up because of this approach.

The truth is, I could rebuild this thing in my own CMS in about a day,
but I wanted to keep it as is if possible. Again, this should not be
that hard to figure out.

But what's the difference between the two types of records?

Until you see the actual SQL, you can't really say that.

grep -r mysqli_query .

Of course, adjust "mysqli_query" as needed for your given context.
