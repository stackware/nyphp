I'd read somewhere that scripts launched from the GUI don't necessarily
have HOME set in the environment.   Perhaps that's not true, but I'll go
with one of the suggestions you or Federico made in the event I don't
find HOME.

My thanks to both of you!

PHP 5.4 is finally ready for the show. Have you used it? Any gotchas?
http://php.net/releases/5_4_0.php

It's a little thing, but I'm looking forward to being able to declare
arrays using the short syntax:

$items = [];

No more register globals, no more magic quotes, and no more safe mode.
Our little hypertext preprocessor is all grown up!

I am looking forward to array dereferencing from function return statements.

function foo() {

}

echo foo()['awesomeness'];

Me too.  There was an RFC for javascript-style object literals which I was really excited about, but it was pretty much shot down.  I was going to try to make a patch for it, but never found enough time to dig into how the parser works.
https://wiki.php.net/rfc/objectarrayliterals

I'm excited about Traits.  http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php  It removes the need for multiple levels of subclassing in some cases.

Short code, is cool
$name = (new DB)->get_row()["name"];

Short array is nice
[ "user" => [ "name" => "Neytiri", "color" => "blue", "language" => "Na-vi"
] ];

<?= is now always available regardless of the short_open_tag setting,
finally!

I just don't get the syntax of traits, why not a simpler syntax, class C
extends A, B?



Here is the complete ChangeLog:

I've to correct what I wrote before about traits.

PHP 5.4 implements traits instead of multiple inheritance, because the
multiple inheritance can cause the "diamond problem"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_problem

That article explains in detail how the problem is handled in other
languages. And traits can still result in conflicts that look pretty
darned similar to the diamond problem, which result in a fatal error.

So I think your question is still a good one. Nevertheless, I'm glad
we've got another way to reduce the amount of boilerplate in our
classes.

Paul,

Is this still a problem? Are you running PHP on windows or on linux?

If you are running it on windows, you should really use the Sql Server
Driver for PHP  http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20098.

If you are running PHP on ubuntu, the mssql driver is not available from
the default repositories. I think you will have to build it yourself.


Cheers,

Justin

Hi,
I am trying to get the php mail function to work. I have a website
running Apache2 and PHP Version 5.3.3-7+squeeze8 on Debian. I tried to
get a test email message working. Here is my code:

<?php
$to = "plehrer at gmail.com";
$subject = "Test mail";
$message = "Hello! This is a simple email message.";
$from = "plehrer at me.outlook.com";
$headers = "From:" . $from;
mail($to,$subject,$message,$headers);
echo "Mail Sent.";
?>

Can anybody help me?

Regards,.
Peter Lehrer

Best way to debug mailing issues is to view the mail log and see if
there are any clues as to what went wrong. On Debian, it is at
/var/log/mail.log

Very often mail problems have to do with anti-spam controls in
receiving systems. Most big email companies will only accept mail from
servers with a reverse-DNS record that maps the IP address to a real
name. Also, you may be running up against SPF records created by
outlook.com that prevent forging mail from that address.

One thing I notice in your script is a missing space after the colon in "From:".

Exactly. It's easy:

As alternative you can use dedicated SMTP servers, which often are more
reliable than shared hosting server, although way slower.

OK, Thanks. I installed sendmail on my local machine and got it to
work. However, when I send it to my gmail account, it goes into spam.
This is probably due to the reason Chris enumerated.

Yup, also shared hosting often are hacked used to send mass email, and
obviously black listed, so it depends by the security level of the receiver
of the email if the email go into inbox or spam!

I did a few mass mail using SMTP, they are slow, like one email every 1-3
seconds, and PHP wait for the email to be sent,  so to avoid users waiting
for the email sending, you want to setup a mail pipeline and a chron job,
or, using some trick like opening the script the send the email into an
iframe.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Are Singletons Really Evil?
Message-ID: <4F6752DD.3020601@gmail.com>

Yay...  Spring is here, blood starts flowing, mind starts stuttering.   
So I figured I'd ask others opinions on if singleton's really are 
"evil".  It seems to me that "singletons are evil" is part of the a 
classic programmer pattern: a lot of programmers get burned by 
something, they declare it evil and propose something 'new'[I beleive 
the evolution is towards 'dependency injection'], and a new paradigm 
takes control for a while..

The issue I see though is that in the end, all that is really being done 
is a new methodology is being created to solve two age old issues: 
globals and configuration information.  At the end of the day, it's not 
the method that is in itself "evil", but rather the lack of unified 
programming discipline and initial failures discovered.

Back when I started programming[30 years ago] and as I progressed, 
'object oriented' code wasn't a system and everyone used globals.  
Venerable good coding practices were to document your functions - to 
specify what these functions required, what global variables they might 
need, what variables they set, etc.

Yet time after time, coders do not follow this practice.  They do not 
document these things.  And so we get "globals are evil"...instead of 
"programmers are lazy"...  This leads to new methodology's..and these 
new methods "work" for a while, not because they are great, but because 
they are "new" so everyone follows the same rules.  And then over time, 
"programmers are lazy" and these new systems fall down.  At which point 
a "new, better" system is made.  And of course, over time problems are 
encountered, and another "new system" is created.

In the end, we have a bunch of competing methodologies and the strongest 
argument for any one of them is that the others are "evil"...or more 
precisely, the programmer making the argument has gotten burned and 
doesn't want to be burned again.

So that bring us to "why are singleton's evil?"...and the only reason I 
see come up over and over is "dependency injection"..  but when I view 
examples of dependency injection "failure" I find that the failure is a 
failure of implementation, not a failure in the concept of Singleton's.

The classic example of singleton failure goes something like this:
Given a singleton object[say a database object: $db = 
MyDBClass::getInstance();] you are 'stuck' with a single database 
connection.  If you want to have multiple database connections[say for 
an order database and a data warehouse - you can't simply call $db = 
MyDBClass:getInstance(); and $dw = MyDBCLass::getInstance();  and 
magically get 2 different database connections.  Even worse is that you 
can't 'unit test' classes which use the database object because you 
can't have a test/mock database object.

Now, this may well have been true for PHP when people first started 
using singleton's.  But today there are at least 3 ways, without using 
dependency injection, that I can think of off the top of my head to 
solve this problem.

For unit testing:
----
class MockDB extends DB {
// implement DB functions as mock functions
}

// create the testing database
$testDB = new MockDB();

// use the reflection class to change the instance
$changeDB = new ReflectionClass('DB');
$changeDB->setStatisPropertyValue('instance',$changeDB);
----

To override the instance in live code, one could also use the reflection 
class - or one can create a subclass just to change the instance:

Class datawarehouseDB extends DB {

public static getInstance() {
   if (get_class(self::$instance) != *|__CLASS__) {
    $datawarehouseDB = new datawarehouseDB();
    self::$instance = $datawarehouseDB;
|* }
   return parent::getInstance();
}
}

The above code will make sure that the current default db instance is a 
datawarehouseDB object.

You can also change your getInstance code to allow passing in an override:
public static getInstance($instance = null, $force = false) {
// only allow overriding instance if the instance class is ourself or 
one of children
   if (is_a($instance, __CLASS__*|) {
    // as added protection, use a force flag so that if the instance
    // has already been set, the new code must explicitly FORCE override
   // ie: make the coder think about what they are doing
   if ((self::$instance === null) || ($force === true)) {
     self:$instance = $instance;
|* }
  }
// now back to our traditional getInstance code
   if (self::$instance == null) {
     self::$instance = new DB();
}
   return self::$instance;
}

I've also seen from time to time where instance can also be used to 
refer to an array of instances.  IE
public static getInstance($keyword = 'default') {
// now back to our traditional getInstance code
   if (!(isset(self::$instances[$keyword]))) {
     self::$instances[$keyword] = new DB();
}
   return self::$instances[$keyword];
}

}


Now, my point with the above is not to say this is "the way" one should 
do things - it is just to point out that with the state of PHP 5.3 
today, many of the "singleton's are evil" arguments no longer hold 
water.  As such, when you inherit a codebase using singleton's which is 
having all these traditional problems[unit testing, the need for 
multiple objects at times, etc] - I don't see any reason to rush to 
replace all the existing calls to getInstance with some new 
methodology.  Instead you can use the ReflectionClass or any one of a 
number of different changes in order to setup unit tests without making 
lengthy, invasive code changes.

At the end of the day, I can't think of any decently sized application 
which will not at some point need to store/retrieve configuration data 
from somewhere and have objects which inter-operate with each other.  
The main thing to keep in mind is not the '_____ method is evil' - but 
rather to be consistent in using some methodology.

So my question is....what is it I'm missing?  What massively obvious 
reason is there that makes Singleton's "evil"?  Or is it just part of 
the 30+ year pattern in programming I've noticed that "newer is better" 
where there is reason for change "in general" - but that instead it 
depends on the situation/case what the best solution is?

I think the "evil" association comes from exactly what you said, people 
getting burned.  However I feel that singleton's do have use.  For 
example a log file, you only really need one instance for example.  
However there are a couple of reasons why I would argue against 
implementing a singleton:

1.) resource usage for the life of the application
2.) thread issues (not really an issue in PHP)
3.) is this the only way, how about exposure via an interface?

Here are reasons why I argue for implementing a singleton:

1.) they describe a unique resource of the application
2.) global data is sometimes necessary
3.) limit abuse of finite system resources

I could go on all day about this but I would like to hear other arguments.

Speaking as less advanced developer than most of you, in my genuinely
humble opinion:  I hope this isn't off-topic, but I've been working with
Zend Framework 1 since it was in diapers. It had a learning curve and
seemed a bit heavy but I felt it was worth it in my situation. Now comes
ZF2, and as I start reading and learning about it, I can't help but wonder
if I really need Dependency Injection. I hadn't noticed that I was having
any problem managing my dependencies, thanks. There has been one case in my
project where different classes needed access to a model instance, and I
scratched my head for a while before deciding to use a singleton. This is
the first I've heard that the pattern is considered evil by anyone. As I
look at the ZF2 documentation, I'm like, wait a second. Is this not really,
really complicated? Worse, perhaps, than the disease it's intended to cure?

Well, I've been using singleton for years, they do what they're supposed to
do, make a class object "global", so that you save memory and make the call
faster. Singleton/Multiton are not the best solution to make unit testable
code and extendible. Dependency Injection dolce this problem, also creatina
a standard container class ZF2 and Symfony, are creating a sorta of plugin
interface, so that you can easily interchange the classes between the 2
framework. They're thought to standardize the coding to improve the  team
work. About performance, they're obviously slower, I spoke with Fabien
Potencier and he's convinced about improving performance at the application
layer with Varnish, Amazon etc., which I agree partially, because that is
the right way for big project, definitely not for small one, like a CMS for
everyone! So consider  to keep using Singleton/Multiton and even Static
Class when you need to!

ZF2, and as I start reading and learning about it, I can't help but wonder
if I really need Dependency Injection. I hadn't noticed that I was having
any problem managing my dependencies, thanks. There has been one case in my
project where different classes needed access to a model instance, and I
scratched my head for a while before deciding to use a singleton. This is
the first I've heard that the pattern is considered evil by anyone. As I
look at the ZF2 documentation, I'm like, wait a second. Is this not really,
really complicated? Worse, perhaps, than the disease it's intended to cure?

Hi David:

Sorry.  Alas, injecting code into legitimate sites is the #1 source
these days of infecting end user computers.  So securing our rinky-dink
personal websites has become quite important.

I recently picked WordPress for a site and then looked for security
plugins for it.  The eventually lead me to write my own plugin, which
somehow wound up taking about six weeks of intense work.  I've passed it
around for testing and code review.  I'd love to hear the thoughts of
the people here on it from a code level and user interface level.

>        egrep -lr '<\?php.+eval\(base64_decode\("[^"]+"\)\);\?>'  *| xargs

I'd have just grep'ed for "eval", since that should never be in any code
I want to use.  Your regex would miss code that doesn't have double
quotes, doesn't use base64_decode, has spacing in it, etc.

Oh, and lock down your file permissions.  The web server shouldn't be
allowed to write to any files or directories.

Thanks,

Dan, I haven't tried it yet but from reading about the features, OMG! It's
great. I will install it.

Yeah, I assembled the regex based specifically on the malicious code that I
was looking at in all my files. I suppose the trick is to fashion a regex
that catches an actual eval call inside php tags -- there's  always a
chance that the string "eval" is is somehow legitimately contained inside
some php tags.

Except when it really needs to, like for writing data to a file-based
cache, or accepting file uploads. How do you recommend handling those cases?

I have been wondering, why not chmod ALL your php files to 400? Indeed I
did this with one site after my infection, but not the several others. Then
I got hit again, but the site whose php files were 400 was not affected --
probably not a coincidence. It's perhaps a bit of an inconvenience when you
need to update/overwrite, but I see no reason we can't relax permissions
temporarily for code deployments and reset them back when we're done.

On a shared host? Don't use files for those things, use your database instead.

For cache you can use SQLite if you really feel like staying in the
filesystem. For uploaded files, store them in a table in MySQL.

As a bonus, this makes backups easier. All you have to do is back up
the database and you're done.

Thanks to all. Maybe also I should consider leaving shared hosting
altogether, and moving to Rackspace or similar. It looks like prices have
come way down.

If you use RackSpace, I encourage NOT to use their cloud service.  I was
billed over 4 grand in one month for minimal and hard to track usage by the
'hour'.

I hate to say this but I'd recommend Linode over RackSoace if you want a
VPS.

On Amazon you can run an EC2 micro instance 24x7 for free.  Probably
as much oomph there as on your current shared host.

Yeah SoftLayer is a good host.  What was the other dedicated host also,
that was owned by ex-RackSpace, for dedicated?

Sure, that's why you identify the files using grep, then do targeted
editing.  If all uses found need to be blown away, then you can use your
regex search and replace.  Otherwise handle the "good" files manually and
direct your regex search and replace handle the rest.

Oh, and <?php tags should not even be part of the regex.  There can be
other code between the opening tag and the injected code.

Specific directories can be left writable.

Probably?  Certainly!

That's why you automate your deploy process.  Easiest way is via shell
scripts.  chmod writable; update files; chmod readable.
