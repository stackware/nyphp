Message-ID: <20021102012613.GA743@eye.surgam.net>

Anyone know of a unix command-line (text only - no X) program or
script that will take a word document and output the text of it?
Essentially, I'm looking for a more-like tool that will read word
documents.

Hi, 

I have apache 2.0 working with the latest version
of php-stable module on windows 2000 server. I was
wondering what could be causing images that are
uploaded to become corrupted. For some reason, I
noticed that when an image is uploaded gif or jpeg
or just about anything, php seems to be receiving
a  larger file than the one being sent. Its almost
as if the files are being padded. Anyhow I've
tried a bunch of things using a combination of
safe_mode / open_basedir and upload_tmp_dir being
changed around and nothing seems to fix this. 

Does anyone have an idea on what to do to start to
fix this?

Drat... yeah, it is today, 11/5.

Linux Meetups are informal, with people just getting together with
common interests and talking about whatever comes up.  It's a nice
change from the normal user group presentation setting.

This sounds like the classic binary vs text file format problem in
Windows.  UNIX makes no distinction, but Windows will try to add \\r\

at erroneous intervals (thus the large file and corruption).

Depending on the functions you are using in PHP, make sure that you're
in binary mode where possible, for instance:

fopen('c:\\something','rb');

Hope this helps,

Hello,

Anyone that have experience with eZ Publish care to comment on this 
PHP CMS. It look like a very interesting framework.
<http://shop.ez.no/article/articlestatic/7/1/42/>

What I'd like to hear is how easy it is to change the design and to 
do a multilingual site with it. Also, if the shop module is worth it.

Also, if you can do multiple eZ Publish websites with one 
installation, i.e. have eZ Publish manage www.mywebsite.com and 
www.myotherwebsite.com on the same machine.

There is a review os eZ Publish but it doesn't cover these questions yet.

Try using FTP to transfer the file between Unix & NT.  Make sure you use the bin option.  the file is probably getting padded with ^M or something.

Hello Hans,

Is the "dba" pub you mentioned the same one as the one listed below?
---
d.b.a. 41 1st Avenue (between 2nd and 3rd streets), Tel: 212.475-5097
Our favorite place. 12 taps; over 60 bottled beers (strong on Belgian 
and British). Now, authentic hand pumps! Very highly recommended. They 
don't serve food, but you can bring in take-out. We suggest Katz's Deli 
on Houston St., or Boca Chica on 1st Ave. near 1st St.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <3DC8904B.33FAFB2B@alum.rpi.edu>

Well,

I'm not using fopen on the machine, rather I'm
using $_FILES from a multipart form that was
submitted. Now, I can test this with the Xitami
webserver and php and it works fine. However when
using apache it blows up. Its like apache is the
one that's corrupting the data stream.

Any ideas on where I might look for solutions?
This needs to be web-based uploads as many clients
need this feature for their php administration
systems.

There's a great paper by The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) at http://www.owasp.org/. It's called the OWASP Guide. It is not specific to any programming language but it contains some very valuable information.

Hi everyone, 

I have a question for those of you who have involved in COM-DCOM with PHP:

Could it be possible to call and interact with COM objects available on a Win2K box from PHP running on linux?

Any help, pointer to docs are appreciated.

Thanks

Thanks - forgot about that.

While there is lots of good stuff in there, I was more looking for
what they're intending to include in a future version - a
platform-specific cheatsheet for particularl techniques.

Hello all,

I'm a newbie to this group, so please forgive me in advance, if I'm asking a
dumb question: Is there any PHP training available in our area? I've been
doing a fair amount of searching in vain so far, for any professional
training in PHP in the NY metro area.

At last year's LinuxWorld Expo, Rasmus Lehrdorf did a 3 hour seminar on PHP
which was a definite eye opener, but that's really all I've found.

I work with PHP every day on our 1500+ page site and I've spent the last
year converting our entire site over to PHP. Coming from an HTML background
with no real programming experience, I've had to scramble to pick up
programming concepts and good practices along the way and what I'm really
looking for now is a chance to build on what I know and fill in the huge
gaps of knowledge that I still struggle with.

I'm probably dreaming, but I figure it doesn't hurt to ask. Thanks for any
advice you have to give.

Hi Winston,

In coorporation with NYPHP, I used to give PHP courses here in
Manhattan (http://websapp.com/training.php). Due to my busy schedule, I
wasn't
able to do this on a monthly bases. However, if you, and another 5-6 people
are interested, I could put together a "special edition" this or next
month!

If you can't find a class on PHP try taking any intro to programming
class.  What I find is that the important part is the thought process. 
Once you understand different thought processes, whether it be control
structures or OO design or security, or whatever, although different
languages or operating systems do things differently, if you have a good
foundation, than you will be in a good position to pick up a book for the
specific language and find out the exact syntax.

Sure, there is a huge difference between MS Access and Oracle, but they
are both relational databases.  If you don't understand how a RDBS works
then you will have difficulty using both.  If you understand and know
standard SQL, then using either of these or MS Sequel Server of MySQL will
be quite simple with the addition of a book detailing the specifics of the
syntax for that system.  As with databases, same with server side and
client side scripting langauges.

If you can't find a class on PHP try taking any intro to programming
class.  What I find is that the important part is the thought process. 
Once you understand different thought processes, whether it be control
structures or OO design or security, or whatever, although different
languages or operating systems do things differently, if you have a good
foundation, than you will be in a good position to pick up a book for the
specific language and find out the exact syntax.

New York Linux Scene has some Perl (and maybe C?) classes. I would recommend them even if you want to program in PHP later. 

see the nylug-talk archives (nylug.org) or http://www.nylxs.com/ for more info.

PS: I'm not saying Perl is better or anything. Just that you won't be able to find many PHP classes and knowing Perl will help a lot more than you think with PHP.

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for responding - I'm very interested. Unfortunately, I don't
personally know anyone else who shares my eagerness to learn more about PHP.
So, anyone else out there up for participating?

Info can be found here: http://websapp.com/training.php

Thanks,

Hi PHPers,

It is very exciting to see such an interest in a PHP course. I have
decided to re-open my PHP training session and am aiming for the end of
November. This course, is perfect for beginners and for those who have
been using PHP but without getting a good and solid programming
background. The slides (which will definitely be updated for the next
course) can be found at:
http://www.websapp.com/courses/php/level1/ppt/index.php

The course is designed for 16 hours (4 sessions @ 4 hours/session) . The
last few were 2 full days and that seemed to be fine.

I suggest that the course be either Thursday-Friday, Saturday-Sunday,
Friday-Friday or Saturday-Saturday. The classroom is in a professional
facility in midtown Manhattan (i.e.: every student has his/her own
computer and their hard drives are saved between days).

The price for this course is $780.

For those that are interesting, please send an email to
training at nyphp.org with your preferred days and we'll see what can be
arranged.

You are advised to ask NYPHP members that took the course for their
opinion, and I am sure (if they are still around) that they'll be happy
to respond to the group.


Best regards,
Daniel Kushner

But I've also seen some (few) headlines about the "portal giant embracing

Anybody has an idea of what's happening with yahoo and php?

Hi,

I'm the Program Chair for PHPCon so I might know a little bit.

Some of the CNET headlines may have been a bit leading, but Yahoo! is
indeed actively using PHP for some of its community applications. While
Michael gave more of the Yahoo! business case for PHP session, Jeremy
Zawodny (http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/cat_php.html) gave a
talk on the rollout of one of Yahoo!'s first large-scale PHP-based apps
-- a 9/11 tribute -- and some of the pros and cons associated with PHP
applications and needing to serve an absurd amount of pages.

We had a number of Yahoo! engineers attend the conference and the
general feeling I got was that PHP is something that has proved itself
at Yahoo! and will be used in future projects. 

/begin plug

And, as PHPCon will be in New York in the Spring, if anyone has any
questions on the conference, I would be more than happy to answer them.
I know I certainly have a few for this group. ;-)

/end plug

Nice to see you here.

I'll keep my opinions of/about CNET to only spoken word. I will say that 
CNET is not what I would call a good source of news (Only *slightly* better 
than /.) but I digress...

This really speaks more to his experience with MySQL than PHP (Jeremy *is* 
Mr MySQL for Y!) but it does speak well of PHP. He also has an excellent 
blog entry on Linux vs FreeBSD for running MySQL.

Considering that Y! hired Rasums last month... one can make the assumption 
that Y! is going to be making a serious commitment to PHP.

Hi Jon,

Last week in April is the current target. 

We should be able to establish a final date in the coming weeks but we
are running the hotel availability gauntlet at the moment. 

We are still in the planning stages, which I would very much like NYPHP
to be a part of, but I am working from the idea of a three-day event: 1
day of tutorials and 2 days of sessions/keynotes.

By all means; that's what we do  :)

This sounds like it'll be a rich conference and I'm sure many of us
here are looking forward to it.

Short of speaking for everyone in NYPHP, many of us would like to be
involved with the planning and development of PHP-Con.  Although we
will not be having a November or December meeting because of Holiday
conflicts, a holiday networking party in December is being developed,
with additional meetings not out of the question.  Our normative
monthly meeting schedule will resume in January.

Congratulations on a successful PHP-Con, and together we look forward
to bringing it to NY.

Best,

As Bryan pointed out, some headlines have been misleading, but Yahoo!,
as a company, is in-fact adopting PHP.

I've been in contact with M. Radwin, and to the best of my knowledge,
Yahoo! is based primarily on yScript and additional technologies,
developed inhouse and in C/C++.  They are looking to use PHP's
extensibility by C, and integrate yScript with PHP as a framework for
daemon, OS and external communication.  As Yahoo! engineers often do,
they know a good thing when they see it, and see that PHP's nativity to
C, manageable syntax, flexibility and a great development community,
offer a lot of value.

Subject: PHP include() and isset()
Message-ID: <006001c28b4a$35fd2ae0$77a19980@pentiumii333m>

Hello, in an Windows environment using PHP 4.2 I would like to point out that even if the allow_url flag is turned on you still cannot use

include("http://www.what.com/what.inc");

It does not work. I get an error stating that the include cannot be found.

Also, the isset() function does not work on a windows server. You can click submit and it just refreshed the page. I have also tried using !empty() and it does not work either. These are important functions to my school work and I would like to know if there is a fix to correct this problem.

Thank you,

Fantastic.

Perhaps we can block out some general questions to hash out on the list
and provide a topic for discussion in future NYPHP meetings.

Tracks. Currently we are blocking out three tracks with the option for a
fourth if the need arises. Current proposals for tracks are:

- Enterprise
- Application Development
- XML
- Education (PHP in an academic setting)
- CMS
- Web Services

Additional suggestions? Comments on those listed?

General Theme. What are the problems that you are looking to solve? What
are you looking to take away from the conference? Why will you be
attending PHPCon East 2003? 

Sessions and Speakers. Are there specific sessions or speakers you would
like to see at PHPCon East 2003? Judging from what you have seen of the
sessions from PHPCon (http://www.php-con.com/2002/agenda.php), where do
we need to improve?

Keynotes. Rasmus has penciled us into calendar and will likely be
delivering one of the keynotes. I have some ideas for a second but I
would like to hear suggestions. 

Tutorials. We did not provide hands-on tutorials for the first PHPCon
but feel it is a necessary addition. What topics are would you be
interested in seeing offered? Are you more interested in 3 or 6 hour
tutorials? What are your requirements for attending (material to take
away, PC provided vs. bring your own laptop, &c.)?

I would like to encourage everyone on this list to participate either in
the discussion, at the actual conference, or as a media sponsor (banner
exchange, email promotion, &c.). We had wonderful support from the Bay
Area with the first PHPCon and I suspect, by what I've already seen on
both on and off the list, that the local NY PHP community will be just
as active. 

We will be making an open call for papers if anyone is interested in
participating as a speaker. 

And, as before, we will be accepting Birds-of-a-Feather (BoFs) and
Works-in-Progress (WiPs) up to the day of the event.

I realize there are quite a few questions above, and I don't expect
answers on everything, but any feedback I can take in will make for a
better conference experience.

I think we set a good tone with the first PHPCon and generated some
positive press for PHP and its community. Our goal is to make this a
very important event for PHP developers and I think we heading in that
direction. Thanks to everyone for their help.

Spoiler: it all boils down to using the pgp binary on the system, there's no native support for PGP (as far as I am aware)

My PHP/PGP bookmarks:

My phpbuilder link seems dead.. Search for 'PHP PGP' or 'PHP GPG' in their forums.

PS: we ended up not doing anything with it.. which is a shame.

This was announced some time ago, but I just want to make sure everyone

anyone.

Sounds good.  By no means do I want speak for others on the list, but I'll
try to get the ball rolling by voicing my opinions.  I encourage everyone to
do the same, as we have a rare opportunity to forge a national conference to
be as informative and useful as possible.

This is always a hot topic, and may include performance tweaking and proper
programing techniques.

Very broad.

> - XML
Same with this.

> - Education (PHP in an academic setting)
This is interesting to me.  I work at NYU, and depending on the details of
what this track entails, may be able to help out.  There must be others who
work in an academic (non-profit?) setting and are using PHP.

> - CMS

Hand in hand with XML IMHO.

> Additional suggestions? Comments on those listed?

I always feel that a large part of PHP is left out, that being local
scripting and CLI.  We use PHP through crons to mine data from Oracle/MySQL
and couldn't be happier.  Considering the other language choices and the
various DB support, PHP really is the only answer.

> General Theme. What are the problems that you are looking to solve?

PHP recognized as more than just an "HTML embedded scripting language"

> What are you looking to take away from the conference?

This is a toughy.  Offhand, probably the satisfaction of feeling that PHP has
been launched into the eastern seaboard, and has a strong development
community.  Also, possibly, the continued support of companies, following
suit of Yahoo!.

In general terms, more of the same.  Sessions concerning
enterprise/scalability/XML/design/etc are always useful, and always something
that could use reinforcement.

Very much so.

> What topics are would you be interested in seeing offered?

I'd like to have some of the core PHP developers give an indepth/"hands
dirty" look at performance tweaking, from PHP land and Zend land.  Of course,
a technical look at the session topics mentioed above would be valuable, as
well.

> Are you more interested in 3 or 6 hour tutorials?
The more I can pick their brains, the better  :)

Reference material to take away would be useful, but obviously speakers that
I know know the source.

Thank you, and I look forward to working together in a large and diverse

Thank you Bryan.  I'm sure PHP-Con 2003 East will be great and NYPHP is here
to help, allowing you to put your ear to the ground, here in the East.

I'm using the LOAD DATA query to load a file into a table, which is working
OK.  I would like to know if anyone has figured out a way to receive
statistics about this query, mainly how many and which rows where skipped.
According to this page:

http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/LOAD_DATA.html

there doesn't seem to be a way to do this easily.  I guess I can count the
number of records in my file, and compare against the database to obtain the
number of records skipped, and I could probably do a SELECT OUTFILE and
compare that file with my original file to see which records were not
loaded, but this seems like alot of work for what I'm asking for.

Does anyone have any tips on how to do this without going through what I
mentioned above?

I know this is a MySQL question, but I'm using it with PHP, so I feel
posting it here is justified.

Thanks,

Tom

They speak of mysql_info() which is available in PHP.  It was requested by
yours truly months ago, however it still doesn't look like it'll be available
until 4.3.

There are a couple built-in MySQL variables (which escape me at the moment)
that might help, but essentially, yes, you'd probably be best off doing it
the hard way (or use a CVS of PHP).  This is why I requested mysql_info() be
available  :)

Yeah, I figured that I was going to have to do this.  I did get excited when
I saw the mysql_info() function in the docs, but lost hope when I saw it was
only available in CVS (going to CVS is not an option for me).  Your
suggestion of adding that func is a great one - lets up 4.3 comes out soon!

Thanks!

New York PHP is has a dedicated server online (http://projects.nyphp.org) for
just such a purpose.  Although not completely implemented, we have at least
two projects that will be hosted there, which should start early this week.

In addition, NYPHP is always trying to improve the mailing list software, web
site in general, and develop interesting new software (like a fully
integrated, threaded web-forum/mailing list).  I also have about three new
web pages and tutorials that need to go online, so any help would certainly
be appreciated  :)

The current size of the conference probably won't allow us to be too
granular with an Application Development track. One of the most well
attended sessions at the first PHPCon was the PDFlif talk, which if a
tough one to pigeonhole in anything other than a broad category track. 

One thing we could do is focus on a given technology for each day of the
conference. Day One: Application Development with MySQL, Day Two:
Application Development with XML and Web Services. This would also have
the benefit of freeing up a track for, possibly, Education. The drawback
is that topics like CLI or GD, or Rasmus' Tips & Tricks talk might get
overlooked if we try to type the track to strong.

I've very interested in doing an Education track and we had a number of
Educators, students, and University IT folk at the first PHPCon.
Depending on how it is structured, the appeal of an Education track
might not pull Enterprise or your typical Application Dev attendees so
we would obviously need to see a good showing from the Universities
outlining the track, giving sessions, and attending.

I think we are seeing this arise out of the Enterprise track. By and
large, PHPCon's focus is the Web, but we certainly don't want anyone
leaving thinking PHP is only a tool for your Geocities page. We didn't
officially state a tag line for the first conference but I can see the
need for something along these lines for the next. I believe PHP Journal
was considering printing up shirts that made reference to Perl and Camel
butts, but I don't know if we want to go that far. ;)

Yahoo! will most certainly be there and we are talking to other
companies that are developing enterprise PHP applications. I think
having the name of a major University or two that has adopted PHP
internally would certainly add to the conference. And, as always, if
anyone has any suggestions of companies that have adopted PHP, please

I've never seen that but would try to kill the process if it is still
running (it shouldn't be but it helps to check) and then edit the
php.ini file to remove the reference to mm module.

While this seems like a pretty cool course:

I don't see it coming to NYC soon which is sad :-(  In recent months 
seems like nothing in the way of PHP certification or MySQL 
certification has been made, or has there?  I have been unemployed for a 
while and going for wireless security certifications to see if that can 
spruce up my resume but Id like to do Linux+ as well but is there 
anything yet for LAMP?  

What is Sair Linux/GNU certifications consist of?  And as an employer is 
it something you would look for?  (For example if someone was certified 
as a PHP+ or MySQL+ or Certified MySQL 4 Professional, etc.)

Any feedback appreciated (before blowing the piggy bank :-)

Looks like a great course, but hopefully as the East's visibility increases
with PHP-Con and such, more will be offered here (*hint* *hint* :).

I had looked into Sair a year or so ago, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I
think it's pretty well died out.  RedHat is the money maker for Linux these
days, especially since the partnership with Oracle/Dell.

True; we wouldn't want things to get squeezed out the sides because they
don't fit nicely into a track's topic.  PHP is probably still young enough
that covering broad subject matter is important.

I've discussed this with our director at NYUCD if some of my software could
be used for presentation.  And while there is some official legalise to wade
through, I'm sure it'll be fine.  I'm not sure how to move forward with this,
but a large part of NYUCD's internal software (if not all of inhouse
development) is PHP.

Well we can certainly put NYU in there, and I will continue to look at other
colleges/departments for further use of PHP.  Also, I have some relatives at
Columbia that may be able to point me in the right direction.  And as another
poster did, if anyone is using PHP in an educational setting (or any large
deployment for that matter), be heard!

Well I'm assuming you'd be most interested in pure PHP coding (which is a
shame, because there's a couple web pages, large forms, and a Word document
to work on - any takers? :)

It pretty much falls into this:

-- The NYPHP mailing list is written inhouse and is composed entirely of a
CLI PHP script.  While it's worked fairly well, there has been problems with
it and it needs a revision, plus new features, including:
   -- Vast performance improvements (50% complete - know sendmail/qmail?)
   -- MIME parsing and attachment processing
      (95% complete, but testing need)
   -- Foolproof threading, regardless of email client, user, etc.
      (75% complete)
   -- Additional bells-and-whistles, including tip and URL scraping and
      compilation, building a "FAQ-ON-DEMAND" of sorts.
      (5% complete, if that)
   -- Full integration of all this with a web based forum.
      (not very difficult, but the above 3 need to be in production first)

The user authentication/authorization for all this is already written as a
RPC, and would just need be properly hooked into the above.

-- Redesign of NYPHP.org, from a layout/aesthetic standpoint.
   (25% complete)
-- Then, improved CMS system, to allow maintenance of articles, news, etc.
   (10%-15% complete)
(Yeah, I know the Nukes do some of this, but it wouldn't be worth dropping
boilerplate software into such a dynamic/different environment, unless you
know a Nuke so well as to make a nice hack).

If you, and/or others, find something interesting, please let me know.  I
might be leaving something out, but the above is the main development push
for NYPHP.org, and any other recommendations/projets are welcome, as we have
the system resources to support them (just not the time to write them).

Does anybody know to to use apache to do the

redirect all requests for

http://mydomain.com:8001/

Here's the problem, since I can do this at the dns

linux (yes, I'm a windows user) I figured maybe
the virtual hosting or url-rewriting features of
apache could do it for me. Any suggestions?

I can't speak for others but when I'm hiring the mention of a certification
makes an small impact. It tells me that the candidate was serious enough to
go thru the rigor of obtaining a certification. It also tells me that the
candidate is aware of the breadth of the field. It doesn't tell me much
about the depth of knowledge the candidate possesses.

It does not remove the need to give the candidate a thorough technical
interview. In fact, candidates with certification are often given a tougher
interview because they are expected to meet a higher standard.

It also matters which certification is it. Most open source certifications
are not taken seriously. Often certifications focus on requiring a candidate
to have cursory knowledge of every area and don't focus on in-depth
knowledge in specific areas.

for NYPHP.org, and any other recommendations/projets are welcome, as we have
the system resources to support them (just not the time to write them).

If you have mod_rewrite, put this in the <VirtualHost> config for
webmail.mydomain.com:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^.*$ http://mydomain.com:8001/ [L,R]

Yeah, you should be able to do this with something like:

<VirtualHost webmail.mydomain.com>
Redirect / http://mydomain.com:8001/
</VirtualHost>

There's a good description here:

Are you on Windows or Unix? If the latter, check in /tmp for a file that
looks like "session_mm.sem" and delete it (as root). It was created by
another PHP process that was using session support (the web server?) and you
as a command line user don't have permission to write to that file.

Actually now I have one more question:


I'm currently running multiple virtual hosts using
the <VirtualHost *> directive
So, if I would like to redirect all
http://webmail.* to mydomain.com:8001 how would I
do this?
Like so?

<VirtualHost *>
ServerAlias webmail.*
Redirect / http://mydomain.com:8001/
</VirtualHost>

I don't believe you can use a wildcard in the ServerAlias directive,
but I've never tried. I think you have to name the aliases explicitly,
and I don't know if you can specify just aliases without a ServerName.

if the domain contains webmail.*
the redirect to mydomain.com:8001

and will this work universally?

David's solution was close to this.
Here is the solution

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^webmail\\..*$ http://mydomain.com:8001/ [L,R]

Strictly speaking it redirects domains *beginning* with webmail
Which is what I think you want anyway.
If you really want domains *containing* webmail then

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule webmail\\..*$ http://mydomain.com:8001/ [L,R]

      In  fact,  I'm  so enthusiastic about Governor Dean I've put up a
      website in support of his candidacy www.americafordean.com

      Take a look and if you like what you see, pass the link along,

I haven't used this function myself, but consider a couple things:

-- what kind of line termination are you using?  I think these functions may
have had some issues with \\r\
 vs \
 vs \
\\r

-- Try a *very* simple header, ie:
$test_header = "From: blah at hah.com\\r\
To:to at woo.com\\r\
\\r\
";

-- do other functions from this extension work?  Check that they're
configured properly, and it can find the c-client libs.

Thanks a lot Hans, 

Now I manage to use this function , you need to replace all \
 by \\r\

before sending the string to the function, but now it appears that there
are some limitation to this function... 
With php 2.2.3 the number of address in the field "to" is forced to a
max of 140... If nore than 140 the function crashes badly... 
But it works fine wit php 2.2.2 !!! 
Gotta go in the C code of 2.2.3 to clear this up :( ...
If anybody know why this is so bad let me know please ....
Thanks 

JB

Ahh, yeah, damn email standards  :)  The RFCs say only \\r\
 are allowed, but
most MTAs etc do only \
 - a real mess <rant>and RFCs don't help much!</rant>

Good luck.. from what I've seen, parts of this extension are a bit rough. 
Mailparse, which should be stable in 4.3 (and has been moved to PECL) looks
promising.

As I've been rewriting the mailing list software for NYPHP, I wrote a fairly
robust class and set of functions for parsing emails.  It's still a little
rough and lacks some features, but has worked well in testing.  I've attached
it, and feel free to rip what you want from it, and better yet, see where it
flops and let me know :)

Best,

Hans

Looks like we'll need to recompile PHP (among other things) to give this a shot. :) Looks like it might be worth the effort though.

Greetings!

This isn't entirely PHP related but I thought it might be worth asking since
it does fall into a similar realm. What I am looking to do is design and
implement a scripting language that would be embedded in HTML. The first
step I've decided on for this is to try to get a hold on is information
about how one goes about getting a compiled binary and Apache to coexist
happily. Obviously PHP is a great example of this and looking at the source
will be a good way to start but I was wondering if anyone knows of any books
that specifically deal with this issue; not neccescarily a book on this
specific problem but more a reference on dealing with Apache (it's the only
web server I'll be supporting for the time being - think small, right?) and
the issues that come with that. Any suggestions would be a great help so
thanks.

Jonathan

We don't have any relationship with osCommerce or Nola.  We use an older
version of their software, integrate them together, add new features, and
release OSSuite under the original license.

I think it would make sense to start with information on "writing apache modules"

Similar? I'd say so! :)  Out of curiosity, what features don't you find in
PHP that is cause for another language?  Or is this just a project for fun?

Strictly speaking, that's CGI, and could be incorpated with any HTTPD.

> Obviously PHP is a great example of this

Yes and no.  PHP's strength often comes as a module of Apache, which is
different than a CGI.

I think you probably want to know about writing an Apache module.  There is
an O'Reilly book on the subject, although probably dated; certainly since
Apache 2.  The book, however, gives a good overview of the Apache request
stages, etc and architecture.  There's also apache_hooks, which is a PHP
SAPI, although looking at the code would give an excellent idea on
interacting with Apache at a lower level.

And of course, probably the best source:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/API.html
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/developer/API.html
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/developer/

and http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/ as an overview of how A2 does things.

Best,

But honestly, this is just a little project I'm thinking about for my own
personal amusement. PHP will always be near and dear to my heart.

Yes, I'm looking to create a module.

Just ordered the O'Reilly book today! I found it on Amazon.com for $3.10
through one of their third-party sellers! As for the book being dated, we'll
have to see. Since this isn't a project that's about creating something for
enterprise use, I won't mind using an Apache < 2.0. [I'm still using 1.3 as
my webserver anyway.]

Thanks for the links. I've got a bit of reading to do before I start
considering how I'm going to do all of this. Thanks for the help and
thoughts

Bah... being able to understand the weaknesses is a strength.  There's things
I don't like about PHP, but I'm going to write my own language.  But it is a
fairly complete language, and so I'm curious what you'd like to add, as I'm
sure it wouldn't be trivial.

Damn, I bought it years back for $50.

Most production (enterprise?) environments still use 1.3.x.  However, A2 is
stable (I'm running A2/PHP4/MySQL4 and although a little flakey on FreeBSD,
fine on Linux).  And, A2 has *a lot* more flexibilty in it's API and
architecture than A1, so while it may be good to get some background with A1,
I'd certainly strive for writing for A2.

A,

After making sure your PHP configuration has support for everything necessary installing OSSUITE was pretty much straightforward. ( I had tried OScommerce alone before with less luck).

Oktay,

I'm glad everything went well for you.  Our goal is to make an open-source
business application more intuitive and productive for businesses.
Hopefully, we'll gain support from members of NYPHP to take OSSuite a step
further.  We look forward to work with all of you at any capacity.

I'm sure you have what you need Larry, but should you need a virtual private
server (meaning root and whatever specially configured daemons/etc), the
NYPHP projects server is online with capacity to spare.  Just say the word
and I'll set an instance up for you.

Thanks a bunch, Hans, for the offer.  I take a ring check for now since we
have all the required hardware already.   Right now, we just need more
programmers or scripters, whichever suite you better.  We have no problem

Hi Larry,

I'm using Smarty as template engine in our applications. It's much more than
a simple template engine since it also has caching capability. If you check
different sources on the net you'll find out that it's caching engine really
works and makes the difference(I would say it adds at least 40-50% speed
when compared to other template engines). Besides it's pretty easy to learn
and to use. It also has some complex scripting capabilities like generating
date drop downs, or listing data arrays in the templates, etc but I really
don't use them in order to keep all of the code on the php side.

It can also use embedded php blocks in templates but as I already explained,
I don't really like the idea of putting code everywhere in a framework. It
has a perl template engine's flavor; at the beginning this was the point
that made me pick Smarty among its competitors but I then realized
that -after reading some ( :o) in fact, lots of) critiques and benchmarks
about different template engines- Smarty was really the best choice.

So take some time to go over its reference documentation, I'm pretty sure
that you'll love it.

Good Luck

Kerem

I have just recently started experimenting with Smarty too. I started by reading almost all of the documentation on smarty.php.net (this url is one of the reasons I picked smarty.. there aren't many other reasons really.. i just wanted to try a template system. i'd try another if I didn't like it)


Pros: 

- good docs
- very easy to install ( should be a part of PEAR if  you ask me )
- html designer friendly syntax (if you are lucky enough to have somebody who does design only)
- provides template functions for stuff that you can't really handle in your PHP file but that still require some kind of programming logic.
(i.e: you pass an array in form of ('1' => "option 1 text", '2' => "option 2 text") and it draws the dropdown <OPTION> tags for you including marking the right one as SELECTED )

Cons:
- yet another syntax to learn for the templates
- i haven't done anything complicated yet.. but I can see how you might need to embed some PHP in the template

These are not necessaryly particular to smarty but I haven't used another template engine.

There is a GPL CRM written in PHP called Relata
http://www.relata.org/

I've used relatamail (which is a close cousin).
It uses FastTemplate and supports mysql and postgres.
It may save you the trouble of building the CRM from scratch.

Just my $0.03 worth (yes that's three cents! :)

Hi Gautam,

One of our members evaluated Relata extensively.  We concluded that it only
has about 20% of what we need.  Therefore, we'll build one from scratch
ourselves.  It'll take just as long to read other people's code and try to
make some senses out of it.  Thanks for the suggestion.  

By the way, PHPList is a lot better than relata mail in my opinion.  We'll
definitely reuse some of their codes to save time.  That's the beauty of OO
and OSS.

Larry

There is a GPL CRM written in PHP called Relata
http://www.relata.org/

I've used relatamail (which is a close cousin).
It uses FastTemplate and supports mysql and postgres.
It may save you the trouble of building the CRM from scratch.

Just my $0.03 worth (yes that's three cents! :)

Mark,

We'll put something up as soon as we are done with ossuite.org website.  For
the time being, we'll try to utilize sourceforge.net to meet our agenda.  

If you would like to participate, we would love to talk to you in person so
that you have a clear view of what is going on and the technical directive.
We meet twice a week: Wednesday evening with dinner served for active
members only and Sunday afternoon.  Drop me a line if you want to come by.
Thanks.

Larry

I'm sure you have what you need Larry, but should you need a virtual private
server (meaning root and whatever specially configured daemons/etc), the
NYPHP projects server is online with capacity to spare. Just say the word
and I'll set an instance up for you.

Subject: File Write Permission Errors - HELP! URGENT!!!
Message-ID: <0ca201c2947e$44690a80$dcbe6444@scandinawa1bo6>

Hi I have the following code that breaks:

// PLACE NICK INTO NICKNAMES.TXT AND START OFF MESSAGES.TXT
   $fileID = fopen($path . "/nicknames.txt", "a") or die("Could not open " . $path . "/nicknames.txt");
   chmod($path . "/nicknames.txt", 0755);
   fputs($fileID, $nickname . "\
"); fflush($fileID); fclose($fileID);
   $fileID = fopen($path . "/messages.txt", "a") or die("Could not open " . $path . "/messages.txt");
   fputs($fileID, "*** WELCOME \\"" . $nickname . "\\" TO THE ROOM ***"); fflush($fileID); fclose($fileID);
   

I am getting the following error:
Warning: fopen("/users/ppowell/web/chat/nicknames.txt", "a") - Permission denied in /users/ppowell/web/chat/chat.php on line 163

I am attempting to write onto the files if they exist, if not, create them on the fly.  I need the solution in the next 5 minutes - sorry, kind of an emergency! 

If anyone can help, please tell me what to do, the PHP manuals are not giving me a clear solution as to how to write to a file that does not yet exist that has to have the permissions of 0755 for both files.

Thanx
Phil

Just a shot, but try this:

$file = 'C:\\vbTest\\msrg.ppp';
$fp = fopen(  $file, 'a' );
fwrite( $fp, $text  );

You need write permissions on the directory in order to be able to create 
files in it.  Remember, the user that PHP is running as is the one you 
need to give the permissions to.

If you have root access to your server do this

su -
cd to the root of that particualar php section
 ( such as /home/sites/siteX/ with the web forlder within)

chown httpd -R /web
(doing this assumes your apache server runs under the user httpd ) 
This will handle php permissions for most of the cases
The only disadvantage is you have to "su" to make changes to that
particular system

Message-ID: <1038257908.3de28ef46013a@webmail3.namezero.com>



Hey guys, is there a way to stop an instance of PHP from the script. My problem 
is this. I'm using PHP to query some oracle databases over my local network. I 
log off the databases I'm using when I'm finished. But the progress indicator 
at the bottom of my web browser keeps running. Unti I get a CGI timeout error. 
At the end of my script, is there a function or command I can use to end the 
instnace I have created with the webserver. Thanks

Gregg Boyle

Why not just write the files to that directory, and have your script where they
want it?

Good evening,

Just so we're all on the same page, I want to remind everyone that there will
not be a monthly meeting this Wednesday due to the Thanksgiving Holiday.

The December meeting has also been postponed because of Christmas, although
we would like to have a December Holiday Party.  Any ideas or help would be
appreciated, so please contact me at hans at nyphp.org.

We will be starting the monthly meetings again in January, however on a
different schedule (4th Tuesday of the month is tentative).

Some additional details are at http://nyphp.org so please take a look, and
have a good Holiday!

Hi,

Do you have any idea when are they planning to release Php 5? At least beta? I'm really excited
about having full OO support with Php.

Basically when its ready, PHP5 is a Zend engine overhaul almost the size of Zend Engine 1
(for example, a completely new OP execution architecture), it should be really cool, but
it will require a lot of testing (and the feature set isn't even that stable as of yet).

An optimistic estimate would be EOS (end of summer) next year, but I'm guessing it'll be 
another 6 months after that, it really depends if we have PHP 4.4 or start developing 
seriously on the php5 tree (which hasn't even been created yet).  One of the things to 
keep in mind is that the php portion of v5 (ie, not the engine), will also have some 
major changes, most notably harald radi's rpc extension, and hopefully my adt extension, 
also a lot of the current core stuff stripped out into PEAR/PECL.  Also, if I get the time, 
XML support should be overhauled, but that's a matter of what I'm doing from January on :)

Subject: How to override header info in mail()
Message-ID: <019101c2989a$0aeaa2d0$dcbe6444@scandinawa1bo6>

I am using this line:

if (!mail($to, $subject, $body, "From: " . $from . ";" . header("Content-type " . $contentType))) {..}

to use the mail() function in PHP to send simple text/plain or text/html email.  However, upon attempting to send I get a warning message indicating that header information has already been set prior to emailing.  

Is there a way to overwrite only certain header information prior to emailing to ensure the content-type of the email being either text/plain or text/html?

Just wondering
Thanx

Hey,
The correct way of doing that is:
if (!mail($to, $subject, $body, "From: ". $from ."\\r\
Content-type". $contentType)) {..}

you shouldn't be calling the header function - header() is meant to 
set HTTP Headers (also, mail headers are not delimited by a semi-colon, 
but by carriage return, newline).

You are combining two completely different functions.  mail() is to send
email.  header() is for HTTP headers while serving/viewing pages on a
webserver.

If you want to put content type headers in your email, you just type them 
in, don't use the header() function.

Ok, taking out the header() part and doing this:

if (!mail($to, $subject, $body, "From: " . $from . "\\r\
Content-type " .
$contentType)) {..}

Did not produce an error, however, the email format remained unchanged when
I tested it by changing "HTML" to "Plain Text" in my form.. sorry, that did
nothing.

What I'm trying to do is to ensure that if you click onto the "Plain Text"
radio button that the email that is sent will be plain text, not HTML.

the top if you want to see it in action

I'd say this is a logic error in your script, the form is properly setting the
content-type header, check to make sure that you've properly set $contentType.

my whole objective with my server was to not only have a for/non profit
developement enviroment but also to gain the experience needed to facilitate
my/others needs. what do you mean nyphp could provide space? i wouldn' t
mind also providing space for this group, since i do plan, when i have more
time, to become deeply involved in this local community. does nyphp.org site
need a mirror? oh and also i haven't been able to get on dal.net today does
any one know why and is there a dal.net server provided through anyone in
this group. i used to spend a great deal of time in #php under the nick
natural178.

Morning All,
i agree with what was said below about being a developer or a sysadmin, it's
the same comparison with being a graphics designer or a developer. what you
may be over looking is the benefit of at least knowning the tools the
designer(s) use, because you will then understand the needs of the
designers, and how to comunicate with people who often have so idea what you
are saying. you see i'm not trying be as sysadmin because i am a programmer,
i just need to be able to have more control over the enviroment then i have
with a shared hosting account. i care nothing about many sectors of being a
sysadmin, security being the one issue i have no time to deal with. as i say
do what you're good at and the rest will follow.

Hi All,

Fyi, I called Peter this morning at around 9:00am. he apparently spent many
hours on the phone w/microsoft. It was to my understanding that his problem
has for the most part been taken care of. He also was very thankful for the
call.

I had no issues with Zend studio. I said this many times before, it's my
editor of choice for php. the only part I have a problem with is the
language it's written in. I'm all for java but, not on a full scale dev
studio
like this. it's starts, runs and closes slower than any other dev studio
I've
ever used and uses up so many resources on my puter,so even with 512
on a P3 1.2ghz I can't run and do as many things as I like at once without
drastically slowing down ZS. now like I said it's a good program and it's
not Zend's fault that my computer isn't fast enough to run ZS efficiently,
but
I think there whole way of doing it is wrong. what's even funnier, the only
reason I could see using java for this would be cross platform usage but
if that was the case it's would be a all java.swing even thought's uses
some classes form java.lang. so my whole point is why use an os
independent language if you're going to write os dependant code.

notepad,
IE, and Norton AV on winxp pro. regardless of what you are telling me and

understanding we are in a tough economy, i still bill at least $80/ hour.
you get what you pay for and someone charging $20/per hour might
just be worth $20/per hour. one thing to remember, php is a great
language, and can allow someone with little experience to write crappy
code that that will still work. what i also find just wheeling and dealing
in business is that people trying to get work cheap will say will say much
more then , "she is getting scores of resumes where guys are charging
less then $20 an hour". it's all a game and if a potential client is going
to
try to pull that one i often will not even bother with them. i don't need to
stress myself out dealing with people who want something for nothing.
those types of clients are also the ones who will call you every 5 minutes
wanting to change something. my suggestion is to leave that work for the
script kiddies because they still have to pay there dues.

there was an artical about this topic in New Architect this month. Maybe
that is where you got that from? basically if someone wants to deal with an
international firm they'll find out that there getting more than they
bargined for.
In reverse trywriting for someone india (wrox) if they can get the work done
so cheap in there country why are they contracting american programmers.
