<PRE>&gt;<i> Nothing since I left. But when I was on them my box was being super
</I>&gt;<i> slow. My cursor would take forever to blink every now and then when I
</I>&gt;<i> was coding in VIM. I called RS customer support and nobody had a solid
</I>&gt;<i> answer for me or explanation. I just had to wait it out. After three
</I>&gt;<i> times of that happening within the first month I left Rackspace.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I manage over a hundred cloud instances with Rackspace without a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem. What are you encountering?
</I>
I'm going through a preliminary comparison of Amazon and Rackspace clouds
myself.  I've been with EC2 and they've been ok, however, the problems arise
on the lower-end instances.

Medium/large work well (I use mostly large) but they're not very cheap, yet
they're very often much more power than is needed for your average site.
So, I've been trying out a couple of micro instances, but they are basically
useless - think along the lines of entering single user mode in Linux and
still not having enough CPU resources.  Even compiling PHP can be a very
long undertaking.

So I've been in search for that sweet spot - somewhere in the middle, that's
cheap, yet functional.  I've been playing with Rackspace instances (the
smallest one) and while the storage and RAM is of course small, the CPU
doesn't seem as cut-down as with EC2 micro.  I can compile normally, etc.

So while the jury is still out, I'm liking Rackspace so far for these
low-end sites/instances.  Anyone have similar experiences or thoughts?
