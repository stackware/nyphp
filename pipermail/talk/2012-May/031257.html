<PRE>Federico, thats a long term trend. Although I have to say the spread of  
-moz-drop-shadow type browser specific CSS has felt like its getting a bit  
out if hand....

Within the past few months I think performance and bloat have been hitting  
Firefox and Chrome. Does anyone know if Opera is still holding strong or  
does nobody even bother with them anymore?

Really guys, what are you talking about? Now you code once and it
works in all browser, I wish things where this easy 10 years ago!
Browser improved a lot if you consider standards, compatibility,
performances and security (less virus, adware)!

</I>&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During the past few months? It is like that for quite longer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FF 4 and higher just sucks, the UI is horrible and the switch from 3.6 to  
</I>4 broke a lot of things that are still not fixed....unless you happen to  
know the add-on that unfixes the 'fixes'. I also get the impression that the  
Mozilla folks got way more arrogant. They use to be thankful for  
constructive criticism or had at least a good reason for why things are the  
way they are. Now they ignore any user input and if a response comes along  
it is typically along the lines of &quot;Go away!&quot;
&gt;<i> You can escape the rapid updating (which Google started with for no  
</I>reason) by installing the FF10 ESR build. That branch is back to the old,  
reasonable update schedule.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Chrome is IMHO crap from the start and it did not get any better. Yes, it  
</I>loads pages faster and uses less memory, but it also doesn't do anything  
other than that. I also like some UI with my fat client.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IE is very dependent on the local settings, when they are a bit harsher  
</I>than mildly restrictive a lot of things just stop working. It also get the  
impression as if we are back to being forced to IE-only development dragging  
around different code for IE while the typical code works just fine  
everywhere else.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Opera is technically nice and can do a lot of things, but I find it  
</I>utterly kludgy to use. Safari is like Chrome, a lot of sauce with not much  
meat.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as getting things to work the way I want I still have most success  
</I>with FF followed by Chrome. I tend to not try it with Opera and IE and  
Safari are not even considered. I have the luxury to consider it the other's  
loss when they use these browsers and things don't come out right. Not  
everyone is as lucky.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, I agree, browsers are heading back to the stone age, especially  
</I>with Flash getting thrown out all over the place. HTML5 isn't properly  
implemented in most browsers and the pieces that are included are working  
differently. The problem is that HTML always only specified the markup, but  
not the display or functionality. It suggests an option, but really leaves a  
lot to interpretation.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2 ct.
