Subject: [nycphp-talk] PHP 5 guru: help fix simple PEAR DB problem
Message-ID: <20040202000719.GB18625@panix.com>

Hi Folks:

I just uploaded the latest release of PEAR DB, 1.6.0RC3.

Can someone who's more familliar with PHP 5 than I please help fix the 
following problem?

The DB_common::getAssoc() method works fine in PHP 4 but is producing
really weird results under PHP 5.  If you're wondering, PHP 5 is a windows
snapshot from today.

Attached are three files:

1)  getassoc.out.diff is a side-by-side diff of the tests run under PHP 4
and PHP 5. See the "ABOUT TO BE RETURNED" section at the bottom for the 
diff.

2)  common.php.getassoc.diff is a unified diff for patching the current 
DB/common.php file to provide the debugging info.

3)  getassoc.phpt is a test file.

Thanks so much,

--Dan

Hmm, I don't use PEAR DB myself, but looking at the relevant lines from 
common.php:

             if ($fetchmode == DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC) {
                 while (is_array($row = 
$res->fetchRow(DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC))) {
                     reset($row);
                     $key = current($row);
                     unset($row[key($row)]);
                     if ($group) {
                         $results[$key][] = $row;
                     } else {
                         $results[$key] = $row;
                     }
                 }
             } elseif ($fetchmode == DB_FETCHMODE_OBJECT) {
                 while ($row = $res->fetchRow(DB_FETCHMODE_OBJECT)) {
                     $arr = get_object_vars($row);
                     $key = current($arr);
                     if ($group) {
                         $results[$key][] = $row;
                     } else {
                         $results[$key] = $row;
                     }
                 }
             } else {

It appears the code is not resetting the internal pointer of the array 
returned by get_object_vars ($row), which may be causing the odd 
behaviour....

I would suggest changing both $key = current($row); lines in the above 
code to $key = reset($row); and removing the existing call in the 
FETCHMODE_ASSOC section.

Just my thoughts....

Ok, looking again the issue I mentioned is not going to cause your 
problem...it's definitely a tricky one...

My guess would be that it is somehow related to the PHP5 behaviour of 
returning objects by reference rather than by value...it is possible 
that you have some odd reference problem happening, which would explain 
why the initial print_r debugging works but once the second loop goes 
through there are problems.

I would be tempted to put an unset($row); at the end of your while loop 
just to make sure that you are not unwittingly overwriting any references...

It took me a while to get the whole testing framework up and running,
but now that I have, your script seems to cause a core dump.

I have a backtrace, but it would be nicer to see if we can get this
down to a shorter script that doesn't involve lots of includes and
database accesses. FWIW, I'm using the SQLite driver because it
required the least amount of set up on my machine.

It appears to me that "perl-style" is the outcome of a sort of "parallel
evolution" in any language using the "." as something other than the member
operator. Especially when it's OO in even the vaguest sense :)

I mean, you've got to get there somehow when you can't say
"object.member()", right?

Interesting.

Done.  I've pared down the PEAR.  Still produces weird output, but not the 
same weird output.  Also, the output changes if the SQLite file is 
unlinked at the end!  Wacky!

THANKS!

Here is the shortest script I can come up with that still causes a
crash:

$array = array(1);
$element = (object) array('a' => 1);
get_object_vars($element);
$array[] = $element;
print_r($array);

It's super subtle, you need to:

1) Use an array with a string key: array('a' => 1)
2) Cast it to an object and call get_object_vars() on the result.
3) Assign this cast object to an array with multiple elements.
4) Call print_r() on the resulting array.

If I remove any of these, the crash goes away. I can generate a
backtrace if you can't reproduce this on your machine.

Nice job.  The thing is even more subtle than that, because your script 
runs fine on my machine...

Array
(
    [0] => 1
    [1] => stdClass Object
        (
            [a] => 1
        )

)

I hate these kinds of bugs.  There's something similar to this happening 
with the Interbase extension in PHP 4.  Total pain.

I've tried to tweak things to make it act up on my machine, but no luck so 
far.  Yeah, can you send me a backtrace and the details of your OS/PHP 
config please?  I'll open up a bug report combining our issues.

Thanks,

DOH!  I was running PHP when I executed your example.  The output is wacky
under PHP 5 on Win2k.

Again, thanks so much Adam.

Folks.. is there a simple effective way to do this *without* using mySQL?

if there is a tutorial/link, i'd appreciate it..

example: there are 25 visitors online and 3,000,000 visitors since
yesterday.

Jeff,

Is this on a shared server or a box you built yourself?  If it is a box you
built yourself, you can probably put the mail server of your upstream
provider in php.ini to get around the problem, assuming the box is going to
stay where it is for now.

If the server really needs authenication, you may have to use sockets to
send mail, but lets hope that's not the case!

I have very limited experience in this, just thought I'd try to help.

Good Luck,

Tom

What is this?!?!  A secured Exchange server?!?!

(scratches forehead)

It simply cannot be.  ;^P

Seriously, what is the server running for SMTP services, Exchange?

If you pointed all of your session tempfiles to the same directory (like 
'/tmp/phpsess' or some such) then I suppose you could parse all the 
files in that directory to get a count.  But I don't know a logical way 
to track the number of sessions and such, unless you wanted to write to 
a text file on the filesystem...

It is definitely easier to use a database (PostgreSQL!), as with a 
decent database (PostgreSQL!) you can generate all the statistics that 
you need.  Yes, the database (PostgreSQL!) is the best route to go.

Did i mention PostgreSQL?

Another question on this topic, is there a best-practice for 
LAMP^D^D^D^D LAPP community websites where you need to track online- and 
recent-logins and such?  I'd love to hear any working knowledge that 
dictates a superior approach...

For example, I'm thinking about a high-traffic website that would use 
pound up front, racks of apaches for httpd, sql relay in front of the 
database groups, and clusters of slaves for reads (and some homegrown 
goofiness for CRUD operations).  Where would you put session data for 
this, and how would you get your 'XXX online, XXX this week' type of 
information?

It's using MailEnable. I think it needs to be configured to allow local 
IP address (127.0.0.1) to send mail.

Tom,

It's on a shared box using Win 2003 and mailenable which, I believe, 
handles SMTP services.
I think I may have a solution.

Oh yeah...we both looked at this some time ago.
However, I did discover that MailEnable needs to be configured to allow 
local applications to send mail 
(http://www.mailenable.com/kb/Content/Article.asp?ID=ME020044) so...I'll 
see what the sysadmin says.

I'm making the assumption here that you don't want to use any database
and that you're just not philosophically opposed to MySQL. If that's
the case, consider SQLite.

It's a database library that uses flat files instead of a separate
application, so there's less administrative hassle. SQLite is bundled
with PHP 5 and available under 4.x from PECL. (http://pecl.php.net)

There's also a bundled session handler that works with PHP's session
code. To enable it, set session.save_handler to sqlite in your php.ini
file.

Note: Using SQLite is slower than just using files; however, if you're
not a high traffic web site, this should not be a problem. (Which I'm
guessing you are, since you don't want to use MySQL.)

Hiya,

A fellow wwwacie is trying to do something that seems
to me to be perfectly straightforward, but either I'm still
far more ignorant of PHP than I thought (I've *been*
reading, nearly every day!! Geez, there's enough docs
on that site to make me go blind!!) or this just can't be
done. Below is his post / request - he's cc'd on this note
so please cc him on replies.

In an off-list continuation, he noted, that the
$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS array is just an array of
cookies, not an array of values for *a* cookie. Is he
right? :-( Really? :-(((( bahhhh....so how do we get
the other stuff besides name and value? now *I*
want to know!

Cookies do not return the information that you're looking for. They
only return the cookie's name and value. (And maybe the path and
domain.)

See RFC 2109 for more information:

The answer might very likely be an arg string not unlike a GET string,
buried in the "value" value. I'll scope the RFC again, but I can't think of
anything preventing your cookie storing
name="mycookie" value="expiry=<date-time>&foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2..."

This will allow for a handy parsing (since hey!! it's a URI!!)

You're right - just the name and value.

I think this is one of the cases where industry implementation and RFC
2109 differ. I have found Netscape's original specification to be more
accurate in terms of what actually happens:

http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html

Hope that helps.

Assuming your PHP is greater than 4.1.0 this may 
interest you:

"HTTP Cookies: $_COOKIE
Note: Introduced in 4.1.0. In earlier versions, 
use $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS."

and 

"$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS contains the same initial information, 
but is not an autoglobal
(Note that HTTP_COOKIE_VARS and $_COOKIE are different 
variables and that PHP handles them as such)"

****END OF TRANSCRIPT OF ORIGINAL MESSAGE***

I'm not sure about the error code message numbers. But it sounds like that
the server wishes to establish that the sender is authorized to send by
forcing you to check for new mail first before sending. I had this problem
once. Did not find any solution (maybe beacuse I use the Chinese program
Foxmail) Nevertheless a quick fix was just changing the SMTP server to
another one not requiring this. Hope this helps.

This feauture is a anti-SPAM configuration apperently.

Turned out that MailEnable was not set to accept mail from the web app. 
Once it was set to accept mail generated by IP address, specifically 
127.0.0.1, the problem was solved.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PEAR DB 1.6.0RC4 was just released
Message-ID: <20040204072340.GA4362@panix.com>

Hi Folks:

I just released version 1.6.0RC4 of PEAR DB.  Several things have been
fixed since I mentioned RC2 at the meeting.  Also, if you're using 1.5.0
variants or earlier, definitely check out the new version for loads of
enhancements and way fewer bugs.

I've also spent a bunch of time documenting the new functionality and 
fixing the old docs.  Most of the changes are already viewable on the PEAR
website and most of the remaining improvements should be in place when the 
docs get rebuilt Sunday around 1am EST.

So, please download the package and test it out as well as read the
documentation.  Please file bug reports if stuff doesn't work or is
unclear.

Download:    http://pear.php.net/get/DB-1.6.0RC4.tgz

thought this might be of interest to the list (sorry to anyone whose
bandwidth gets eaten up) ... then again im sure we all use linux and have
nothing to fear to begin with :-)

the interesting part of course is that MS will discontinue their non
standard(?) use of the url form:

http://user:pass at site.com:port/foo/bar.html

making anything using parse_url($url) possibly break, but then again if ur
using this scheme to begin with you should be spanked :-) ...

Speaking of which, how many of you use linux as your primary desktop?  Now
that I don't do much design, it's more and more tempting every day, but I
still feel I'll suffer some windows withdrawal... Outlook and photoshop for
instance.

Definitely good news.

I do, but I'm fairly non-graphically inclined. You may want to check out 
OS X if you want the power of unix and the looks of Windows. My wife 
switched over and she likes it.

i was in the same boat until i realized KDE/QT was one of the most powerful
things ever programmed :-)  although i will probably still be dual booting
my thinkpad between xp and redhat 9 for the next 10 years ... i was very
happy to see alot of new "import" features on linux, so i end up mounting
the xp partition as a drive and import all my messages between outlook +
kmail.

the design is what kills it, id have to take a 3 month class on gimp to get
up to speed on doing the same work w/ photoshop :-(  i think thats the
*only* thing keeping it as a primary desktop for me.

I have been considering this, but I have a hard time justifying the high
price of mac hardware.  OSX is REALLY interesting overall.  Would LOVE to
see OSX for the PC.

Interesting, and a damned good reason to give it a shot.  Think I might have
to give it a shot.  Regarding using gimp, I absolutely agree.  Admittedly, I
haven't given gimp much of a chance in my short trials of it, but being an
adobe junkie for 10 years is just a hard thing to break away from.  Wouldn't
mind seeing the flash ide on linux as well.  Then I'd have about no use for
xp, besides maybe for a couple games I never really have time to play.

I do, both on my desktop and laptop -- the latter gets me in trouble on 
occasion, like when I get stuck in the field with Windows only hardware (only 
happened once).  On my desktop I have Win4Lin for the purpose of running 
Photoshop and checking sites in IE (although I heard CrossOver Office can do 
this as well and is slightly less expensive -- $89 for Win4Lin, COO is $59). 
I can live without Outlook thanks to KMail.  For emergencies, I do have one 
W2K box however.

Linux is not yet for everyone, but every day the gap closes a little more.  
Aside from that, you don't have to reboot every two days or get the blue 
screen of death when in the middle of something important.

that is actually a good point ... a few months ago I ran VMware and was
completely blown away, unfortunatly I was doing networking testing and could
not run multiple adapters but beyond that I felt it was amazing stuff (the
$300 price was a little steep, but for professionals well worth it) ...

screenies:

http://www.vmware.com/products/desktop/ws_screens.html

i never got to the point of running the client on linux + photoshop of
windows but im sure its doable.

i think this is how i came across the bluefish editor ...

Last week on a managers computer. Oddly, he had been off for a couple
days and it had died without him even there. The week before it was
another co-workers.
 
Blue is a pretty color, though....

I do. And I have even taught myself to use The Gimp!! It could still help
me to learn how to script-fu it, but otherwise, it works fine for me.

TRYING to rebuild a new desktop using something other than RedHat now.

Which other distro has a nice point-and-click, make-the-hard-decisions for
you install GUI like RedHat?
I tried Debian and couldn't get it to bring up X.
Tring Gentoo now, but it's taking forever, and I'm starting to get
confused and will probably have to do it a second time to correct my
mistakes from the first pass.

Opinions? Advice?

thanks

You can use Knoppix as a Debian installer. Gentoo takes a considerable amount of tweaking and patience for compiling. I think it has it's place, but wouldn't recommend it as a desktop you'll make your living off ofunless you really, really know what you're doing.

I did and I shouted out loud "YEAH!!!" at full volume when it was over.
Kinda got me where I live. The kid is about the age I was when Muhammed
Ali was the age he was in the clip, and I've always been a huge admirer,
and of course I love the Penguin too. My, those marketers are clever, they
know how to get to this forty-something male.

Continuing the desktop OS thread:  I'm a RedHat 9 dude on my home desktop
machine, and a Win2K dude at work where I have less choice in the matter.

Hi all,

I need to profile some code and I'm using Zend Studio under Windows XP.
The code, however, speaks to an Oracle database via OCI8 and I'm finding
that Zend Studio's included PHP version doesn't have the OCI8 extension
installed.  Any clues on getting Studio's PHP to include OCI8, or to
have Studio use another PHP that I supply?  I'm aware of the extensions
to the server side (which is Linux in this case) but it's a production
box and I'd rather not muck with it.

Thanks,

Hans

Hi all. I use **ONLY** Linux for work and desktop-related tasks.
My distro is Slackware 9.1 - also very very good for development - provides
Apache 1.3.29 (updated package from 1.3.28), MySQL 4.0.15a, PHP 4.3.3 ready
and working, Quanta Plus and EMACS for PHP development, Mozilla 1.4 and/or
Netscape 7.1 .

> Speaking of which, how many of you use linux as your primary desktop?

Linux is my primary desktop at home for personal use, on my laptop for development work and also as my personal business computer for securities. At my current contract job, their environment is Windows 2K, but I use as many FLOSS applications as I can.

There is give and take with some of these scenarios. At work, for instance, people see me using Mozilla and just can't get enough of tabbed browsing. I find it very difficult to use IE at this point. As far as OpenOffice goes, I send out finished documents in PDF. Managers love this. Also, I save slideshows to Flash and then save it to a flash key drive (or whatever those USB devices are called), and they fall all over themselves. I told the sales guys about a web site that brands them with your corporate logo and they all want Open Office now. I code with Emacs on Windows.

However, I really can't live without Pivot Tables. I know not everyone uses them, but for those who do, you can't live without them. Same goes for its interoperability with SQL Server. Its also the same reason why I use Access. Its not sufficiently powerful for what I do as a database engine, but its a nice front end to SQL Server. Its just quicker than typing SQL into Query Analyzer. So at this stage, I really need both packages for some tasks.

For personal business, OpenOffice and Evolution, combined with GNUPG, give me all the security I need in transacting business. And I use GNUCash, because of its integration with QuickBooks. Just because you accountant wants QuickBook files doesn't mean you really have to use QuickBooks. And I don't download my bank statement bcs Citibank's fee for doing so is higher than the cost of just doing it myself.

Here's a LinuxWorld article on it:

And I think there are a bunch of other write ups if you search around (Debian installer Knoppix).

Reason number #45758-20/a to use Mozilla over Internet Explorer:
HTTP PUT publishing from Composer.

If you script it right on the server, you can do the following:

1) View page in Mozilla Browser
2) Ctrl-E to edit the page full WYSIWYG in Composer
3) Ctrl-Shit-S to publish it back to the server
4) Refresh the page in the Browser, all done

Mozilla is truly the killer dinosaur, er, app.

I sometimes use Zend Studio to analyze PEAR DB, which uses the oci8 
functions.  Didn't have any problem.  I'm using my own PHP version 
(4.3.5 dev) and have the oci8 dll uncommented in my php.ini.

You may just need to uncomment it in the given php.ini file since the oci8 
functions have been around for a while so should even exist in the old 
version of PHP (what is it, 4.2.0?) Zend bundles with Studio.

Good luck,

I have a version of PHP on WindowsXP with everything I need (which I do
actually use occasionally) but I can't get Studio to use it.  It wants
to use it's bundled PHP.

All this talk about BSOD's has me terrified, wondering when it is going 
to happen to me.  I'm an old (OLD!) *nix user from 1984, Windows-free 
since 1996.  And Macromedia's tools have forced me to start living the 
dual-boot dream in order to quickly create layouts, templates and Flash.

But I tell you something - this thing NEVER crashes.  Really, and I am 
the last person to figure out how to manage an XP box.  I download 
patches (some of them, at least!) and that's about it.  Then again, no 
Kazaa, no video games, no fun...  Maybe I'm on to something here.

My only complaint is the lousy driver support for my el'cheapo AC97 
onboard sound, which consequently sounds GREAT through ALSA.  :(

I know the java launcher thing 
uses its own zend1 engine.

Still you could phpinfo (in 
the ide) and determine where 
exactly the ini file exists and then 
edit it.

If you got the oci dll from 
the zend install you should use 
that one.


good luck

I know the option to use the bundled PHP version or not is handled during
the install.  Perhaps there's a preference somewhere you can set?  Or you
could reinstall.  Or, you could overwrite the PHP version the IDE is
using.  Or...

Subject: [nycphp-talk] user authentication security structure
Message-ID: <402135DE.8060004@next-online.net>

All,
Thanks for all your suggestions and feedback to date.  The following is 
a description of the login and user-authentication mechanism I'm 
planning to implement in our application, based on the discussion here 
and other research I've done.  If you've got ways to improve it, please 
make suggestions.

Assumptions:
* all client browsers will have cookies enabled.  If they don't they get 
redirected to a page that tells them to enable cookies before they have 
the chance to log in.
* all pages (especially login) will be within SSL
* will be using custom session handlers (aka Sean's article in php|arch)

Requirements:
* users can bookmark any page in the application.  When the user tries 
to return to a bookmarked page after the session has expired, then they 
are presented with the login page.  after a successful login they're 
redirected to the bookmarked page.

Flow:
* user enters their username and password and submits the form
* code makes sure the data submitted is "clean"
* code checks username and password against values in db
* if they match create a cookie that will expire in 10 (or so) seconds
* create a session
* redirect to home page or bookmarked page.
* at home page read the temp cookie and the session data, if they 
correspond create a new cookie that will expire in N minutes.
* when user clicks "log out" destroy the session and either empty the 
cookie or fill it with garbage.

Thoughts:
I'm thinking of putting a timestamp into the login cookie, so if it's 
presented and it's too old, I can redirect to the login page
I may add a counter to the login cookie, if you don't get in after 3 or 
N attempts you get redirected to some (random) web address.
I've been thinking about using the cookie ID to sign and encrypt the 
session ID and then using the session ID to sign and encrypt the cookie 
ID but that might be overkill.
I may put the login page into it's own folder ./login/login.php, and 
have the login cookie be specific to that folder.

Once I get this flat I'll make the pattern publicly available with 
diagrams and documentation.  I'm not sure whether it makes sense to 
include the code (we use Oracle with some internal classes), so probably 
won't include complete code.

Thoughts, comments, suggestions?

Maybe an example will help

Let's say phpinfo (from inside the ide) 
says something like this:

System  Windows XP build 2600  
Build Date  May 28 2003 15:06:05  
Server API  CGI/FastCGI  
Virtual Directory Support  enabled  
Configuration File (php.ini) Path  c:\zend\bin\php.ini  
PHP API  20020918  
PHP Extension  20020429  
Zend Extension  20021010  
Debug Build  no  
Thread Safety  enabled  
Registered PHP Streams  php, http, ftp, compress.zlib 

okay you open up the c:\zend\bin\php.ini
and you add somethng like: 

zend_extension_ts=C:\zend\lib\ZendDebuggerLocal.dll
zend_debugger.allow_hosts=127.0.0.1/32
session.save_path=C:\zend\tmp
;; stuff added
include_path = ".\;C:\php\includes;C:\php\PEAR\pear;C:\php\PEAR;include
extension_dir = ".\;C:\php\extensions"
extension=php_oci8.dll
;; 
error_reporting  =  E_ALL
log_errors = On
track_errors=1 
error_log = php4_errrors.log

display_errors=Off
register_argc_argv = on

=============

this assumes your php_oci8.dll
can work with php 4.3.2

Warning: I never tried this -- 
but it seems like it should work...

I've used Linux as my only OS since about '96 or so, which is how old my
computer is. :-) I recently got a PowerBook, but that decision was
hardware-based and not because of the OS.

The only thing I could see using Windows for is UltraEdit. I'm just not as
good with vi as I am with UltraEdit, and I really wish Linux had something
comparable. That's one sweet editor.

Hi Y'all:

Working on a new method for PEAR DB that would quote identifiers.  The SQL 
standard, and Oracle supports, delimiting identifiers using double quotes:

   create table "name w space" (...

This works fine in Oracle.  The SQL standard also says if one wants to use
quotes inside the name, escape them with double quotes:

   create table "name w ""quote and space" (...

But, when I do this under Oracle, it chokes saying "ORA-03001:  
unimplemented feature."  So, in Oracle, are quotes inside delimited
identifiers verboten or is there some other escaping method?

Tried finding it in the docs and oracle news group archives but couldn't 
locate an answer in a reasonable amount of time.

Thanks,

I'm been working with Oracle a long time.  I have been trying to avoid
using double quotes for strings.  Single quotes (') works best.
And, yes, doubling up on the quotes acts as an escape character for them
in strings.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] text: PEAR::DB Oracle BLOBs
Message-ID: <402144B7.8010102@next-online.net>

  All,
text version
Has anyone used PEAR::DB to read and write BLOBs into Oracle?

I've got an application that writes incoming email attachments 
(typically pdf and jpg) to a blob field in oracle.  And I want to write 
the blob not from a file, but from a string.

I haven't found the mechanism in PEAR to do this.

Here's the code I'm using (it doesn't work):
    $sql = "INSERT INTO communication_content (id, id_communication, 
is_body_part, compression_method, content_type, content, 
date_record_added) VALUES
    (comm_content_id_seq.NEXTVAL, '". $a["id_communication"] ."', '". 
$a["is_body_part"] ."', '". $a["compression_method"] ."', '". 
$a["content_type"] ."', :the_blob, sysdate)";
    $stmt = OCIParse($conn,$sql);
    OCIBindByName($stmt, ':the_blob', $lob, -1, OCI_B_BLOB);
    $lob->WriteTemporary($a["content"]);
    OCIExecute($stmt, OCI_DEFAULT);
    $lob->close();
    $lob->free();
    OCICommit($conn);

Here's the error:
*Warning*: ociexecute(): OCIStmtExecute: ORA-02019: connection 
description for remote database not found ORA-02063: preceding line from 
DOCS in */Users/chubbard/Sites/imap/email_parser.php* on line *309*
INSERT INTO communication_content (id, id_communication, is_body_part, 
compression_method, content_type, content, date_record_added) VALUES 
(comm_content_id_seq.NEXTVAL, '332', '1', 'application/x-gzip', 
'application/pdf', :the_blob, sysdate)

*Warning*: ociexecute(): OCIStmtExecute: ORA-02019: connection 
description for remote database not found ORA-02063: preceding line from 
DOCS in */Users/chubbard/Sites/imap/email_parser.php* on line *309

*Thanks in advance.
Chris

I'm talking about delimiting table and column names.  Double quotes are
needed for that.  As far as literals (such as strings you're going to
insert into a field), you're right, single quotes are the way to go.

I've dabbled in RH since 4, and have used 7.x extensively.  I've 
worked with 8 and 9 and have recently loaded Fedora, but Linux has 
never been my primary desktop except when I run it on top of VMWare -- 
which is nice for developing/testing.  I also use SNAGIT to capture 
installation screenshots when loading Linux on XP via VMware.

I use my Wacom Intuos tablet with the GIMP and am now writing all my 
Open Source courseware using OOo -- works great.  And Mozilla 1.6 
rawks.  It's my email client too.  Firebird and Thurderbird are also nice.

Mandrake setup looks pretty friendly, but I've never actually used it 
once I got it installed.  I have had several distros on VMware and 
it's a great tool to show people all the common flavors with little 
more than a mouseclick.


Knoppix is too cool for words, and I've actually used it to recover a 
win98 product ID for a friend who bought a used computer.  If pressed, 
I think I could teach an entire LAMP course using Knoppix.  They're 
supposed to be coming out with ver. 3.4 in a coupla weeks that I 
believe will have kernel 2.6 and other goodies.

btw, I'm on a dialup and downloading an ISO is out of the question, so 
I buy all my stuff from:

That's what Tidy is for. :-)

At least it sends back HTML 4.0 compliant code, and it will apply styles 
instead of font tags (a default? user preference). All in all, none too 
shabby.

Power of Unix yes, looks of Windows, very very loosely, and in fact its 
the other way around. And it seems much richer to me.

Hi Folks:

Chris Hubbard passed my question onto a friend who says:

Actually, you can't have double quotes in an object name in Oracle. This
is from the SQL Reference Manual:

Quoted identifiers can contain any characters and punctuations marks as
well as spaces. However, neither quoted nor nonquoted identifiers can
contain double quotation marks.


So, thank you Chris!

I haven't tried BLOBS, but I've used CLOBS via Prepare/Execute.  See this
test include file for examples:  DB/tests/prepexe.inc.  For those out 
there that are curious, the Prepare/Execute documentation is at
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-execute.php

But does it work from a file?  Have you tried it as a string in DB?  Have 
you tried it as a file in DB?

Dealing with binaries is something on my agenda for DB, but getting out a
bug free (okay, so significantly bug reduced) release in the near future
is even higher. :)

Anyway, if you're doing further testing of how to do this with PEAR DB, do 
make sure to obtain the latest release so we can be on the same page.

I can't really comment on the approach in your code because I haven't 
messed around with BLOBS.

Good luck!

Hi,

If I have to ask any questions about PHP, do I send them to this address, 
that is: talk at lists.nyphp.org or is there any other procedure to get into 
this discussion forum.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <4021965A.7000306@spacemonkeylabs.com>

Hey listolas,

Forced to be thinking in PHP4-based classes, I'm wondering where others 
on the list have found their most helpful resources on the 'Net.  The 
PHP documentation is correct, but I'm looking for something a little 
more verbose.

For example, it is commonly stated that PHP4 classes are clearly 
'stapled on'. Where is a good resource for insight into how to overcome 
these, ah, 'features'?

I'm about to jump into a huge project that is totally PHP4-meets-OOP and 
want to know just how unhappy I will become after all these years in c 
and python :^P

I am a big fan of O'Reilly's Safari.
You can read the book and make sure its
what you want before you plunk 
down any cash.

A good resource is 
Chapter 7.  Classes and Objects 
from 

PHP Cookbook 
By David Sklar, Adam Trachtenberg

which you can find at Safari.

Both the authors are on this list -- 
so you could ask them questions here.

In the article the author highlights the advantages

The article is from November of last year and so

Gotta pick that issue up.  Been looking at a combination of pound and 
msessions for my next biggie, wondering if there's any collective wisdom 
on this list that I could gain insight from.

Make sure you redirect them and pass the original page's location as a 
parameter - I did this for one customer, and they were counting on their 
browser 'remembering' their login information...  But this doesn't work 
if you login from a different URL every time!  I thought I was being 
shifty, but in effect was making them crazy.

Use the timestamp stored with the session - I've never seen anyone hit 
the 'logout' button, ever.

Bingo.  The question I have is where are you storing the session data? 
What kind of performance requirements do you have?

thanks Tim... PHP5 info seems pretty sparse so far.  The two things 
I've been using are the php5/ze2 [php.net] official changes page and a 
pdf of a slide presentation that I found by Derrick Rethans from Linux 
Tag 2003.  I'm wanting to include php5 info for my next series of courses

J

btw, after several ppl gave it high marks on here, I bought a copy of 
ultraedit... very good stuff so far  -- reminds me a little of 'Brief' 
(by UnderWare believe it or not :) from my software engineering days

Good PHP 5 information is hard to find. If you have a particular area
you're looking for, I can probably give you some pointers. (This offer
extends to others, too, of course.)

For basic information, start at http://talks.php.net and look at the
recent presentations. Quality, however, varies from talk to talk and
presentations are not updated when material changes, so take
everything with a grain of salt.

There are no great resources that I know of that discuss PHP 4 and
OO. I would say the site that does the best job is probably PHP
Patterns (http://www.phppatterns.com/), if you're in to that kind of
thing.

Objects in PHP 4 are really structs with functions. You will probably
hate it. Objects are passed by value and everything is public.

If you're truly looking for a good PHP meets OOP platform, I would
suggest PHP 5. PHP 5 implements most of the Java OO
model. (Constructors, destructors, PPP, final, interfaces, abstract
classes, static, accessors, etc.)

While I wouldn't call PHP 5 production quality today, it works
perfectly well for development. I would say that crashing is less than
a problem than memory leaking, so worse comes to worse you restart
Apache. :)

Depending upon your time frame, PHP 5 will be released before you
launch and you'll be a much happier camper during development. (And
you won't need to port your application to PHP 5 in 4 months.)

Any book (or CD) today that claims to "cover PHP 5" is lying. There
have been many significant changes to PHP 5 in the last few months and
while a book may be mostly correct, they will omit some features,
cover some features were dropped from PHP 5, and document other
features incorrectly.

For instance, just this week way you clone objects went from $new =
$old->__clone() to $new = clone $old. Not a big deal, except that you
don't want your reference guide to show you the old syntax.

There's also a book on the market that discusses PHP 5 and
namespaces. Namespaces were dropped from PHP 5 months ago, but this
book is out there saying they're in. If you don't know better, you'll
end up very confused.

PHP 5 is exciting, but we probably need the rest of February for PHP 5
to settle down completely and give developers time to see if the
features in PHP 5 are both designed and implemented correctly.

On a positive note, it looks like a SOAP extension written in C will
be bundled with PHP 5. Previously, you needed to install a SOAP
package written in PHP, which meant that SOAP was slowish and you
couldn't count on SOAP being installed on your machine. (Actually, you
could usually count on it not being installed.)

This extension will provide developers with a significant speed
increase (I would never claim SOAP is fast) and (depending upon how
solid the extension shapes up to be) it will be enabled by default.

Unfortunately, like most things PHP 5, documentation is
non-existent. :)

I found another site advertising php5 learning packages, but at over 
$50, I was a little suspicious because I haven't found much on the 
web, and secondly, I've noticed a coupla posts on here about 
forthcoming php5 books and they're still months off.  I'm looking 
forward to their release.

I've had pretty good luck buying used books on amazon.  A while back 
Dan Convissor was looking at the SQL99 Complete book ($70) and amazon 
had it 'used' for $12 and change -- and it was like new when I bought 
my copy.

As far as style?  Many basic OO techniques for C++/Java (for example)
can be applied in PHP, even under PHP 4.  Of course, you can't get
overly academic since PHP's OO implementation is sparse - but that's
probably a good thing anyway :)

Develop under PHP 5 :)

It's not that bad.  With PHP 5 on the horizon now, I generaly program
*without* attempting all the little hackish OO techniques that were
common with PHP 4.  Soon enough, my code will run under PHP 5 and to me
it's worth a little performance hit now, vs the porting issues later on.

OO is a concept and style of application architecture - you can do OO in
C  :)

Maybe.. I'd personally sign things with a value that never goes out

I'm not sure I see the value in this - especially since cookies could be
forged anyway - but I might easily be missing something else.

That'd be great.  Patterns/diagrams are 75% of the work :)

Agreed.  Delimited identifiers in general are one of those things in the
category of:  just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD do
something.

Hey all.

I've been playing with DB_Cache and encountered a behavior in fetchRow()
that seems weird -- or I'm doing something stupid, always a leading
theory.

The version of my Cache package is 1.5.3 and the file (Cache/DB.php)
containing the class (Cache_DB_Result) containing the method says revision
1.7 I think it will save words to just show it to you:

http://177coles.dyndns.org/test/

It seems that the internal cursor starts one too high and overruns the end
of the array. You get a row missing at the beginning and a "undefined
offest" warning at the end of the loop. I hacked up a crude fix that makes
the problem ~apparently~ go away and I can show ya that too if anyone's
interested.

Even more interesting, if you call fetchRow with arguments
DB_FETCHMODE_XXX and a $rownum, you go into an infinite loop. I didn't try
to fix that.

It's hard to imagine nobody else noticing these problems, but I found
nothing either in the PEAR bug reports or by doing some Googling. (Hence
my alternative theory, that I'm missing something.)

Does anyone know if this is still being maintained, or is it the end of
the line?

How can a person keep informed of changes like the way clone is
implemented in PHP5?  Is there a mailing list dedicated to this kind of
information?

There is no list that specifically just mentions PHP 5 changes like
this. There is, however, the "Internals" list which is where core
developers (and others) discuss changes to PHP. This is a somewhat
technical list, as PHP development is done in C, not PHP.

You can subscribe to the list or review the archives at:

http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php

As an aside, this is a no-nonsense list and you're expected to know
what you're talking about when you make a post. Also, watching people
write programming languages is similar to watching people make sausage
or write legislation. You may prefer not to know how it's done. :)

I'm being lazy - in Pascal/Delphi you can assign a range as a case in a
switch statement. for example... case(0..255) or case('A'..'Z').

Does PHP have a facility to do this? I note that the above doesn't like me
very much ;)

No. Switch to an if()...elseif()...else() and use a regular expression
character class or something similar inside the if().

There was a brief talk of adding this to PHP, but it was rejected.

No.  But your cases can flow into each other:

switch () {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
        // do something
        break;
    default:
        // do something else
}

Cool, just wanted a definitive 'no' :) As it is, I don't really care if the
user manages to jam some odd value in there since it's building a SELECT
statement and nothing "dangerous".

Hooray for 'default' case!! :P

Hi David,

I never used pear's cache libs before, but have been thinking of using 
something like it.
I just checked your code on my machine and am getting the same results:
http://www.stationplay.com/dev/cache_test.php

Seems like a bug to me.

I'm curious to know what other similar solutions you've looked at.
I saw PEAR has a cache lite as well.

I might have a look. Thanks.

I guess I should have mentioned that I ran my code with PHP 4.3.4/Win2K
and 4.3.2/Linux and Mysql 4.0.something, same results. I did this to lines
325-338 and the problem apparently goes away (not thoroughly tested):

   if ($rownum === null) {
//           $this->cursor++;
    } else {
    	die ("If you pass us a \$rownum we go into an infinite loop.");
//            $this->cursor = $rownum;
        }

//  if ($rownum < sizeof($this->rows)) {
    if ($this->cursor < sizeof($this->rows)) {
//        $row = $this->rows[$this->cursor];
        $row = $this->rows[$this->cursor++];
    } else {
        return false;
    }

If you really want to use switch, you can use use switch (TRUE) and in 
the case something like ($a < 10 && $a > 100).
It's not really any better than if / elseif, but it looks cool :)

Yeah, that's true, but any control structure that needs (TRUE) as a running

hey - here is an example (but i just ran this as a test and my result for 0 was not what i expected, hmm - seems it automatically cast the 0 into a FALSE im guessing):

<?php
 
 for ($x = 0; $x < 10; $x++) {
   switch ($x) {
   
  case ($x < 3 || $x > 6):
   echo "x = $x: yes!\n";
   continue;
  default:
   echo "x = $x: no!\n";
   break;
   
  }
  
 }
 
?>

Result:

Jon Baer at thinkpad /mnt/desktop
$ php test.php
x = 0: no!
x = 1: yes!
x = 2: yes!
x = 3: no!
x = 4: no!
x = 5: no!
x = 6: no!
x = 7: yes!
x = 8: yes!
x = 9: yes!

The syntax should be:

for ($x = 0; $x < 10; $x++) {
   switch (TRUE) {
     case ($x < 3 || $x > 6):
       echo "x = $x: yes!\n";
       break;
     default:
       echo "x = $x: no!\n";
   }
}

I was wondering how you guys handle your errors from project to project.  I
consitently have an error handling class at the back of my mind which would
handle all errors and report them correctly, whether it be to an external
bug tracking app or customer support app, a log file, etc.  But the bridge
between ideas and writing code for such a thing is of yet unbuilt.
Currently, I end up adding seperate error reporting per project and per
class depending on the needs of the application.  So I was wondering what
methods you use.

The bit about the infinite loop is nonsense, I now realize. The rest still
stands.

In most cases I take the easy/minimal approach.  That is, to show a
generic page with little information about the actual error, but then
use trigger_error() to log details.  This could easily be extended to
page/email someone, but having reports to a bug tracking app would take
a little more work (ie, custom handler for whatever app you're
interfacing with).

At one point, I was an avid user of setting a custom function to handle
errors, but I've shyed away from that lately.  Generally,
trigger_error() and then a redirect or include of an error page handles
all that I need, without the overhead of building a function (which must
always include the default php error handling) for each site.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] ODBC - DBF files
Message-ID: <4023CDA2.2040104@optonline.net>

I'm connecting to a local dbf file (ACT database, to be exact). The code 
below seems to work correctly. However, it some records are not getting 
picked up. I ran SQL Trace to see if the SQL fetch calls failed but 
there were no indications of failure. Just wondering if there is 
something else I might try. I'm using PHP 4.3.3 on Win XP and the Dbase 
ODBC drivers that are bundled with WinXP.

$link = odbc_connect('act','jeffrey siegel','') or die(odbc_error());

$query = "SELECT UNIQUE_ID, FNAME, LNAME, COMPANY, PHONE FROM 
Contacts.dbf ORDER BY COMPANY";
$result = odbc_exec($link,$query);

while(odbc_fetch_row($result)){
	$ary[] = odbc_fetch_array($result);
}
print_r($ary);

ODBC has a trace you can set in its configuration.
You might give that a shot...

Tried that...but the problem may lie elsewhere. Just did some more 
searching and found that "ACT! 6.0/5.0/2000/4.0 is not fully ODBC 
compliant."

doesn't have some of the required binaries such as NETPBM.  All I can find

I'd say either ask your host if they'd install it or if they have it
somewhere...or get another gallery.

Or, if you're feeling crazy, try to replicate their environment locally and
build it from source and then try to run it locally on your host.   Does
NETPBM have any dependencies...dunno.

Probably another gallery.  :)

Most hosts I've worked with had little issue installing netpbm for me in the
past, so definitely give your hosting customer service rep a shot.

I think Gallery also works with imagemagick which is usually a more
common tool and usually most hosts have it.

Okay, noob here.

I am using a textarea for a form that will get put into a MySQL text

terminated by newlines.

How do I pull out newlines in the text area and make then "<p>" type

$newtext = str_replace("\n","<p>",$oldtext);

that would replace any newlines with new paragraph tags in html. You could
also use <br> for the newline.

If you want to generate 'proper' closed tags you should use:

$newtext = '<p>' . str_replace ("\n",'</p><p>',trim ($oldtext)) . '</p>';

or for '<br />' tags:

$newtext = str_replace ("\n", '<br />', trim ($oldtext));

The trim is used to prevent extra tags being appended if there are any 
trailing or leading newlines.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] PEAR DB 1.6.0RC5 released, please test it
Message-ID: <20040207175811.GB11991@panix.com>

Hello Again:

Another release of PEAR DB was made yesterday, 1.6.0RC5.

The most important change was fixing the bug for people who use
arrays for the DSN information when connecting.

It also adds a new method called quoteIdentifier(), which is used
for delimiting identifiers (such as field names and table names).

I'm planning to issue the stable 1.6.0 release on Tuesday.  So,
please download the package and test it out.  File bug reports
if stuff doesn't work or is unclear.

Download:    http://pear.php.net/get/DB
Manual:      http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.php
Report Bugs: http://pear.php.net/bugs/report.php?package=DB
Home Page:   http://pear.php.net/package/DB

Oh, and if you like the new features, the fixing of over 40 bugs,
and/or the documentation improvements that have happened since
1.5.0RC2, take note of my "Wishlist" page at
http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/donate/donate.htm
The Financial Donations secition is now working again, too.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] knoppix as debian installer
Message-ID: <.38.117.145.89.1076188733.squirrel@www.bpang.com>

I wanted to report back that I tried this and it's pretty great.

For starters, the idea of using the knoppix CD to boot up a system
straight into linux (running off the CD) is brilliant.
I was trying it on an already wiped system, so I don't know if it would
mount windows volumes from the CD boot-up.

The install was as easy as the article makes it out to be... although the
apt-get upgrade process is taking a little longer than advertised, it's
still very easy.

I have it running KDE (default), tho' I have only used Gnome before. KDE
seems a little more fancy-schmancy which may be desireable to some, or end
up being just so much extra fluff (How do I get this mouse shadow and
transparency to go away? Is such an effect really necessary or just using
up precious resources?).
Any opinions on which is better?? KDE or Gnome? (Who am I kidding, of
course there are!)

I just ran the install, and didn't research if there are arguments to
control it (like, don't install certain packages, etc), but it's usually
easy enough to remove stuff later.

Thanks, Josh, for posting this article.

Here's a LinuxWorld article on it:

And I think there are a bunch of other write ups if you search around
(Debian installer Knoppix).

one thing i always thought would have been cool would be a PHP compilation
demo CD which @ boot would start mysql + apache off the bat and either
showcase tons of PHP apps or give a good real live source->feature examples.

knoppix is top notch but i wish it was alot easier to recompile + burn.

also for "security-minded" folks there is also a great version of knoppix at
http://www.knoppix-std.org, it gives a good example of what i mean to have
like a knoppix-php cd.

Message-ID: <C0CDB9F5E81C234FBB42D84E7853125DC1B8AF@intamail1.inta>

I've been tasked with looking at the prospect of using OpenOffice to tie
into MySQL as an Access-like application. The premise being that we could
use OpenOffice to do design and data-capture on the front end, and on the
back end, use it to administer and run reports.

I'd like to knwo if anyone could share their experiences of doing this or
something like it with OpenOffice, and I'd really appreciate if I could get
any resources you people may have found useful in researching or
implementing this process.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] upload file to remote server via form
Message-ID: <BC4D13A7.174CB%stephen@musgrave.org>


hello LIST >>

i currently have a functioning script that allows the visitor to the web
site to fill out a form, select a file and upload all of the contents to the
server.  the text goes into a database and the file to the file system.

now the script needs to have the ability to send that file to not just the
local file system but remote file systems as well.

it doesn't look like move_uploaded_file() can get the job done, only
allowing you to move the file out of the tmp directory and to the local file
system.

then there's the idea of first using move_uploaded_file() and then using
ftp_put() to get it over to the other server.  but that doesn't seem too
elegant and i'm wondering if there's a slicker way.

i looked at the PEAR package page for HTTP_Upload and it doesn't seem to
offer this kind of support.  I did a quick search on PHP Classes as well and
it doesn't seem to offer a solution either.

any ideas?  approaches?

thanks:  STEPHEN.

It depends... how is the remote file system accessible?  If SSH is
present, you could do the following in PHP:

`scp /local/file username at host.com:/remote/directory`;

This assumes you would have a shared key between the local server and
the remote server (so you don't have to enter the password).  If this is
not the case, you could use popen() instead of the backs, which would
allow you to write the password to scp stdin.

If ssh is not available, then there's FTP of course (which isn't nearly
as secure as scp, obviously).  If the remote box has HTTP, you could
post the file to it, with a script to handle it on the remote end.  If
there's NFS...  rsync... cvs...  all depends what services are available
:)

mysqlcc likes to give me this error -- or perhaps, a mere warning -- thus:

Could not load Syntax File: 'C:/Documents and
Settings/mintzd.MINTZD/Desktop/syntax.txt'

I've googled and browsed mysql.com/doc and come up empty. It ain't the end
of the world -- the tool keeps on working -- but it would be nice to solve
this.

Any clues?

C:\Program Files\mysqlcc

I was surprised to find out this weekend that MySQL 4.x has a built-in 
query cache.
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Query_Cache_Configuration.html

In order to turn it on you either need to add a command line flag to 
mysqld_safe when you start the server, or add it to a my.cnf 
configuration (under [mysqld]). The cache size is specified in bytes.

The following are roughly equivalent ways to create a 20MB query cache...

Command line:
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql --skip-networking 
--query-cache-size=20971520

--or --

Using /etc/my.cnf:

[mysqld]
user=mysql
skip-networking
query-cache-size=20971520

As a PostgreSQL bigot, I get similar functionality through the use of 
adodb; but the big difference with MySQL's caching is that MySQL is 
smart enough to know a cache has been affected by data updates, and 
rebuilds the cache - adodb is strictly time-based, but requires no 
round-trips to the db box.

Out of curiosity, anyone here with strong opinions on either, and want 
to share?  I'm strictly on the fence, as I love adodb's independence and 
network-friendly approach, but also love MySQL's 'refreshing' capability...

You nailed it bro. Turns out that when I was launching MysqlCC from a
shortcut on the windoze desktop, the working directory was the desktop so
it was bitching about no syntax file. I adjusted the shortcut's "Start in"
property and now mysqlcc is happy. Thanks.

I've used MySQL query cache and it's great.  I generally have it off by
default, but then specify SQL_CACHE in SELECT statements that are
intensive.  This has given me the best of both worlds.

Lastly, I'm anti /database abstraction/client side query cache (which is
an oxymoron)/ so I won't touch on that much more :)

Message-ID: <20040209233710.GA558@ncc.edu>

Folks:
I'm running a query that has a count( column_name ) statement in it.
The query only returns a row if the count is positive.  Is there any
way to force MySQL to also generate a row if the count is zero?
MySQL's docs on the subject don't seem to say anything (probably
because this is a weird request, and I need to rethink my query).
TIA.

You might try adding a 'sentinel' record.
e.g. if you have a table of phone numbers 
with area_code , exchange, and number
you can have a 'sentinel' record at the 
end with an area code of '999'
(that way if you get a count of 1 it means there 
aren't any valid records)

Your processing then has to specifically 
skip the special area code of 999
(not too clean)

you were probably on the right 
track when you said it might be 
time to think things over again.

Well, the table where the zero counts should occur is a table of
students' attendance records.  Each row has a date, student ID, and in
column "attended", a value of 1, 2, or 3.  1 = present, 2 = absent, 3
= excused.

The query basically looks like this:
select id, first, last, etc., count( attended )
from login, attendance
where id = student /* where login.id = attendance.student */
and attended = 2
group by...

Basically, I want to select every student, and the amount of times
he/she was absent (including never).  But I only get the students who
were absent at least once.  I can't think of another way to get that,
other than what feels like it would be a severe kludge.

Would that kludge include the use of mysql_num_rows?  You could just add 
that to your processing, or perhaps play about with SUM() and GROUP BY...

Yeah, essentially a second query within the foreach of the first
query.  I suppose it'll work, but then I won't be able to sort the
first query by amount of absences.  If that's the best solution, then
so be it.

I've been reading ppl's advice on devshed and dbforums about using a
left join instead of just "from login, attendace".  I think I'm
following their advice, and it's not working.  This query:

mysql> select l.first, l.last, count( a.attended )
    -> from attendance as a left join login as l
    -> on ( l.id = a.student )
    -> where a.attended = 2 and l.section = 1
    -> group by l.id
    -> ;

still only gives me the rows where the count > 0.  I've also switched
the order of the tables in the from line without success.

Chris,

Since sub-selects I think are not really available, perhaps you could do
this in two steps? select your records into a temp table and then report
from there.  Inner joins will definitely drop rows when one of the tables
returns no rows.

get everyone who has been absent more than one time

select id, first, last,count(*) absences
into temp from login
inner join attendance on login.id = attendance.student and attendance=2
group by id, first, last,attended 


get everyone who has never been absent

select id, first, last, 0 absences
into temp from login
left outer join attendance on login.id = attendance.student and attendance
not in (1,2,3)


select id, first, last, absences from temp order by absences

drop table temp

Hope this helps

Mike

Hey Folks:

I haven't been following the thread closely, so forgive me if this was 
mentioned.  Two options:

1) Run the query then check the row count via mysql_num_rows().  No rows 
means no records.

2) Add a bogus column to the query:
   select count(*), '' as x from user where user='y';

The name of the column attended suggest it should 
have only two values.

If you only had two possible values, you would technically 
be doing 'two valued first order predicate calculus' -- 
the fancy name for Boolean algebra -- something that data-
bases are well geared for (well they can handle anyway)

(since there is a difference between theory and practice 
I 'll skip the math and give you a suggestion)

alter the table and add a column absent (which could 
be excused or unexcused).

you can see that there is a parallel between two columns 
which could have a 0 or 1 and the binary representation of
three values with  01 10 and 11. 

(you're sort of synthesizing four-valued first order 
predicate algebra -- yes four -- '00' represents that pesky null)

Let me know if you can make heads or tails
of this post.

I think there are two issues here.  For one, using COUNT() will return a row, containing a count of zero.

select count(user) from user where user='not.a.user'

+-------------+
| count(user) |
+-------------+
|           0 |
+-------------+

But from seeing your query in followup posts, I think you might want something like:

SELECT id,first,last,COUNT(attended)
FROM login
   LEFT JOIN attendance ON attendance.student=login.id AND attendance.attended=2
GROUP BY id

This is one of the finer, and more annoying "features" of mysql (and I'm still not sure that'll work).

But, if my memory serves me correclty, in PHP, that "row" doesn't show up 
if the count is 0.

Hmm...

<?php

Thanks.

Serves me right for shooting off my fingers before testing...  Wondering 
what along these lines I AM remembering. :)

Almost every website has an HTML form for visitors to complete. But how 
do you know that the person who completed the form did so through your 
website? The question for this month's PHundamentals article is: What 
method(s) do you use to assure that no one has 'spoofed', i.e., 
'forged', a form submission?"

the security code confirmation / dynamic image input is pretty much like
visually signing a form + preventing 3rd party dumping.  as per for
accounting to the real valid information that was sent in, id like to see
that code :-)

That's one method that's growing in popularity.
Prior to using this method, was there another method that you've used?

the last method was session hashing for the page to create a unique entry
token and then hiding it ...

<input type="hidden" name="priv_key" value="32-bit/md5">

if the sessions + keys didnt match you would know they came from somewhere
else.  i think the real key is just to have something unique in your POST as
to distinguish it from something else.  this method is actually pretty
similar to using the graphic except the server does the work.  one time keys
work for pretty much anything.

im guessing cookie dropping can work as well since the would have to come
from @ least one entry page on your website before spotting the
registration.  would be interested in what the php security cookbook has to
say about this :-)

The reason you are only getting results for students who were absent at 
least once is that your WHERE a.attended = 2 is cutting the result set 
down to only those students who missed at least one class.

To retrieve a list of students and the number of classes attended, 
missed and excused you should use:

SELECT		l.first, l.last,
		count(a.attended) AS attended,
		count(b.attended) AS missed,
		count(c.attended) AS excused
FROM		login l
LEFT JOIN	attendance a ON a.student=l.id AND a.attended=1
LEFT JOIN	attendance b ON b.student=l.id AND b.attended=2
LEFT JOIN	attendance c ON c.student=l.id AND c.attended=3
WHERE		l.section=1
GROUP BY	l.id

That will give you a result showing the number of classes attended, 
missed and excused for each student in section 1.

I think it's key to remember that a browser is only skin deep... so to =
speak.  For instance, consider someone telnets to port 80 and issues raw =
HTTP requests.  How can this be handled?  Or even easier, suppose =
someone is using LiveHTTPHeaders (the Mozilla plugin).  It makes forging =
HTTP requests and replay attacks trivial.

I'm not ready to make any recommendations yet... just wanted to throw =
some things on the table :)

I'm with Jon on this one.

One-time only tokens tied to the session and with an expiry date are 
wonderful pieces of gear.

I leave securing the session as an exercise for the user, at present I 
use a system which links each session to a single IP, making it somewhat 
more difficult to implement CSRF type attacks...though as with any 
system a determined attacker could manage to get around it.

I guess the real question here is what you are trying to guard against.

One attack against forms is for a script to simulate multiple users, 
causing the system to potentially crash under the load.

The only defense I know of against this is the dynamic image, which 
essentially requires a human operator to be able to decipher the image.

The second attack you are trying to protect against is that a user may 
maliciously submit a form in an attempt to 'spoof' or 'forge' a 
submission by another user.  For this type of attack I would recommend a 
one time token system backed up by a fairly secure session management 
system to tie each form to a session (and time) and then protect that 
session.

i guess it really depends on how secure you want to be + what u r
protecting, providing we are talking about the fact that you might not be
ssl/tls/ssht your stuff to begin with, if you are id say no, not really
anything to worry, if you are say sitting @ a cafe - browsing in the wide
open and going to access/submit this page you are most likely giving the
hacker a harder challenge to pickoff the raw image data vs. the key string
itself.  in which constructing a string back is easier (although tools do
exist for picking off images, etherape i think can) ...

i dunno, i think if ur super paranoid about who is going to
register/enter/submit for something you probably shouldnt have a public form
in the first place :-)

i dont see many tools besides the searchengine submit ones that pose a
threat to automating entries, oh and maybe the sql injection test toolkits
which seem to be popping up.

I should probably preface this by mentioning that my site isn't
exactly at the top of anyone's bookmark list.  Also, my primary
concern is that a student types his/her e-mail address correctly,
because I use e-mail as the primary method of communication outside of
the classroom and office hours.

What I do is ask the student to enter first and last names and an
e-mail address, and choose his/her course from a drop-down.  I then
generate a random string of 16 letters and digits, and throw it into a
table with the student's name and address.  I send this 16-byte code
in an e-mail, attached to the end of a URL, as so:

"Please click here: http://turing.../new.php?random-string-here"

new.php then looks up that $_GET string in the DB.  If it's there, the
e-mail address is obviously valid, and the student can continue
creating an account.  This record is deleted from the table when
account creation is done.  If the address wasn't valid, for whatever
reason (lots of AOL users forget the '@aol.com'), the mail never gets
there, and I delete that record at the end of the semester.

Maybe not the most secure thing in the world, but it ain't
britneyspears.com, either.

Nice question. :-)

First, we must realize that a forged form submission really means a forged
HTTP request, either GET or POST. If your script differentiates between
the two (e.g., you don't use register_globals and rely on $_GET and $_POST
instead), a forged request must reproduce the request method expected.
Otherwise, either method will do. This can be important, depending on the
type of attack.

I briefly read through the replies so far, and here are some comments:

1. Captchas. As Jon mentioned, these are pretty popular, and they're quite
effective. But, it's also unrealistic to use a captcha for every form.
Your users will get annoyed. Also, as Adam mentioned, they're not
foolproof. I assume the link he gave describes using porn sites to help
provide answers to captchas. This is a very creative attack, and to be
honest, it could be used to subvert many safeguards.

2. Shared secrets. Whether you call these one-time tokens, hashes, or
whatever, the idea is typically the same. You create a secret that is
intended to only be known by the server and the legitimate user.
Implementations vary widely, but these methods are my favorite. They're
transparent to your users, and they're difficult enough to exploit that
they protect against a number of different attacks, some you may not even
be familiar with.

One implementation would be to store the secret in the user's session:

$secret = md5(time());
$_SESSION['secret'] = $secret;

And then use it as a hidden form variable in the form:

<input type="hidden" name="secret" value="<? echo $secret; ?>" />

(Every time you display the form, you would regenerate this secret, so
that the user always has a current, fresh, and correct secret).

The receiving page can check this. You can improve the security of this
method by restricting the timeout window (rather than relying on the
session timeout, which might be too large for your needs), or you can
allow more user flexibility by keeping a short history of valid tokens
(which might help avoid potential problems with the user's frequent use of
the back button, although there really shouldn't be any). As with most
things, the best solutions depends on your application, but something is
better than nothing.

3. HTTP Referer. Do not use this for anything except taking statistics or
for your own curiosity.

4. IP address. See 3.

Also, I saw a comment about IP address checking and how it helps to
prevent CSRF. IP address checking adversely affects legitimate users and
does nothing to prevent a CSRF attack (because the request is coming from
the legitimate user). See here for a diagram that may better illustrate
this:

http://shiflett.org/talks/apachecon2003/19

As Hans mentioned, this is all about forging requests. It is important to
understand what this means. Let's assume this HTML form, that is located
(hypothetically speaking) at http://example.org/form.php:

<form action="/submit.php" method="post">
<select name="myvar">
     <option value="foo">foo</option>
     <option value="bar">bar</option>
</select>
<input type="submit">
</form>

It would seem safe to assume that we will be able to reference
$_POST['myvar'] and have it be either foo or bar. Assuming the user
selects foo, the request will look something like this:

POST /submit.php HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 9

myvar=foo

That seems simple enough, right? Consider someone from sco.com who writes
a similar script, only it looks like this:

<form action="http://example.org/submit.php" method="post">
<textarea name="myvar"></textarea>
<input type="submit">
</form>

With this simple form, this evil person (Darl?) can now submit anything as
the value of $_POST['myvar']. In fact, there was nothing to prevent the
creator of the form from including unexpected form variables or anything
that can be achieved with an HTML form.

More sophisticated attacks might just use raw HTTP rather than bothering
to generate a form for every desired type of attack. You can telnet to
port 80 and type in one of the requests I listed above. In fact, try this
one to log into the NYPHP forums:

POST /index.php?act=Login&CODE=01&CookieDate=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: forums.nyphp.org
Connection: close
Referer: http://forums.nyphp.org/
Cookie: session_id=12345
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 44

UserName=myname&PassWord=mypass&CookieDate=1

Just change myname to be your username, mypass to be your password, and
the content length to be the new length of the POST data. Of course,
you'll also want to change the value being sent as the session_id, else
you'll become a victim of my session fixation attack. :-)

Even more advanced attacks leave out the typing and use specific software
written to automate attacks. Literally anything sent from the client is
suspect, and this is why you should at least hide behind a mature Web
server such as Apache rather than trust something like IIS to handle all
of the crazy stuff that people try. I'm not kidding about this or bashing
Microsoft either; it's seriously a bad idea, and hopefully you now
understand why.

Hope that helps.

Chris

That wasn't OCR. It's actually a very creative technique. As far as I'm
aware, Yahoo was the first one that was attacked with this method. Rasmus
was talking about it at ApacheCon.

Maybe this would make a nice NYPHP demo? :-) Complete with porn?

I should also have mentioned that these were designed to prevent
automation, not to prevent spoofing. That's why they're not very realistic
for solving this specific problem, even though they do provide some
protection.

excellent points ... on a small note a group of us actually 'bombed' a
database example once on a friend who asked me to review some of his work,
the tool of choice was nemesis by jeff nathan
(http://nemesis.sourceforge.net/), he had designed a simple php web tool
relying on IP addresses, the point I tried to make w/ tools like
winpcap/nemesis was the fact that you could forge the request all the way

Yeah, it was me who (incorrectly) mentioned CSRF, what I meant was that 
IP address checking helps to avoid the most common session hijacking 
attacks, and also (if session IDs are being passed in urls) sessions 
being unwittingly exposed by users.

Chris mentioned that it is inconvenient for users, I understand that IP 
address checking would be wildly inconvenient for dialup users, etc on a 
long term basis, but can't think of anyone whose IP address would 
regularly change during a session.

The porn attacks on captchas is definitely inventive and no doubt very 
effective, harnessing the power of 15 year olds everywhere....I love it. 
Jon has a good point about not actually requiring a response to do 
damage.  The mechanism to generate the captchas had better be efficient 
or you're opening yourself up for a DOS attack from anyone who can flood 
the form with GET requests...

MessageI agree, you are not alone.  We have been following its progress and
are now starting to look at it again for serious use.  What prompted the
change in opinion for us was an installation of a piece of software (which
believe it or not I am forgetting) that we chose to install required it.
Plus, we had been developing in PHP long before PEAR, so we had (and still
have) lots of homegrown code that we rely upon, and really weren't in a
position to change it "just because".

<plug>Coincidently, this month at the LIPHP meeting (www.liphp.org), we will
be having a general discussion on PEAR, going over the various tools

I was the same way until a couple years ago - around the time they got 
the installer working ;^)

Now I use DB, Auth, HTML_QuickForm, Text_Password, and thanks to this 
very list I am using Math_Stats for calculating standard deviation.......

If it's been written already, then I'm gonna use it!  Why do we always 
gotta reinvent the wheel?  (slaps forehead)

hiya folks. was up late last night and wonderd if this could be done.
Dynamic Titles based on page view

new_york.php
new_jersey.php
north_dakota.php

title = nyc, wtc, city
title = atlantic city, beach
title = blah, blah, blah

Could someone please explain how to generate a title based on page view, and
can it be done..an example would be great.

I can think of several ways to do that starting with looking at
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], or in the URL. Unfortunately, it would be necessary to
get more details on what you're trying to accomplish - this information opn
the problem is awfully vague. Tell us more!

nope...
I have all this stuff that I wrote that works for me.

Perhaps if it is going to be bundled I will consider converting.

Chris hrmm I guess I'm still 1/2 asleep. I'd like to help some pages get
relevant titles based on which page is displayed. So the example is like so:

i have 51 pages - each page is a state name : state.php

i'd like to have 51 titles that have a few of the major cities from that
state.

I'd like the title to be displayed based on the state.php page.. I guess i
could do a huge swtich/case, but was wondering if there is a smart/simple
way..

hope this made more sense :)

yury

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Include file questions
Message-ID: <E1AqZKV-00086B-FJ@host2.yougoweb.com>

Noob here again, wondering about include files.

1. Where is a good place to put them so that they are outside the
docroot yet centrally located for the apache/mysql/php instance?

2. Do you tend to have uniquely configured include files or just a few
for overall use? For example, if you had two different instances of
MySQL running, would you have seperate include files for the pages that
referenced each or would you use one with differnet variable names?

3. What are some things you usually use for include files? What are some
things you*could* put in that you don't?

Thanks!

Ahhh much more digestible - a huge case statement won't be necessary, but to
get it done fast, I'd probably encode all of the pagenames and titles into
an array where $key => $value is equivalent to 'page_name.php' => 'title
text'

$titles = array('new_york.php'=> 'nyc, new york, wtc',
		'new_jersey.php' => 'newark, atlantic city, garden state',
		...);

I'd write it as a separate module and include it, for clarity's sake.

About a year ago I looked at both PEAR::DB and ADOdb, and chose ADOdb. 
I don't remember exactly why, I think at the time ADOdb had a larger 
feature set and was under more active development.

I have had no complaints whatsoever about the speed or reliability of 
the system, and have become somewhat involved in development.

I know that Hans is vehemently against the idea of a database 
abstraction layer, but I am very much for it.  The overhead involved is 
minimal, and the gains are potentially huge.

I am currently working on a project (phpGACL 
<http://phpgacl.sourceforge.net>) which uses ADOdb and we have users 
using MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, MSSQL, and IIRC Sybase.  Without 
something like ADOdb or PEAR::DB we would have no chance at being able 
to support these users.

<ShamelessPlug>ADOdb (I'm not sure if PEAR::DB has similar 
functionality) also supports a system for platform-independent data 
definitions through the ADOdb DataDictionary and adodb-xmlschema.  I'm 
doing a lot of work on both of these tools and a major release is 
scheduled to coincide with the release of ADOdb 4.12.</ShamelessPlug>

I'm not really sure why captcha generation would be the weak link that
someone would use to DOS the box. Wouldn't it be easier to write a
Windows virus to just flood the box with requests?

However, if you were really worried about the extra load, it would
trivial pre-generate 1,000,000 captchas and serve the images up
randomly upon request. If you were super concerned, you could even
offload this task to a separate server optimized for serving static
content.

"The ingenious crack is to offer a free porn site which requires that
you key in the solution to a captcha -- which has been inlined from
Yahoo or Hotmail -- before you can gain access. Free porn sites attract
lots of users around the clock, and the spammers were able to generate
captcha solutions fast enough to create as many throw-away email
accounts as they wanted."

Really, that is genius.  Almost kind of makes me to join force with
spammers... *duck* - it's certainly more clever than anything Norton or
McAfee have come up with  :) =20

Are you saying you have 51 distinct physical pages (new_york.php,
connecticut.php, etc.) and want to write a PHP function that looks at
the file name and can generate the correct HTML title? Or that you
have 1 physical page (state.php) and 51 "virtual" pages?

If you have the first, try placing something like this in a file
that's included in all pages:

$titles = array('new_york.php' => 'New York Title',
                'connecticut.php' => 'Connecticut Title',
                ...);

$path_parts = pathinfo($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);
$title = $titles[$path_parts['basename']];

...

print "<title>$title</title>";

However, what you should really do is switch to the second setup and
pull all content, including the title, out of a database based on a
passed in page name. That solve the title problem and generalizes the solution.

The classic example is AOL, which uses round-robin proxies to let its
users out onto the real Internet. With an AOL user, you may observe a
user's IP address changing for every single request.

I'm not a big networking expert, but I assume there are other situations
that can cause problems with this approach as well. I assume most of these
fit into one of two categories:

1. One user can have many IPs.
2. Many users can have one IP.

Because of this, and because I'm not a TCP/IP expert, I focus on HTTP and
up.

Yes, I thought this was genius. :-)

This is definitely true if you generate them on the fly or something, but
I don't think that's the way to go. With pre-generated images, this
shouldn't really be an issue.

Also, if anyone is a captcha expert, I think this would make a great
presentation of some sort. I know Yahoo uses ez-gimpy (you can find it
from http://www.captcha.net/), and I've gotten that to work, but I
couldn't figure out how to generate images without having Gimp running
under X. I've only played with it out of curiosity, though. Anyone have
any experience they can share at a more professional level?

Agreed, a DB-based solution is much better overall :) I spat out the quick

Message-ID: <200402101714.i1AHEGZa006094@nycsmtp3out.rdc-nyc.rr.com>

I have a question about populating a table with values from a query that
sometimes are null.

When the table's drawn, no border is drawn around those <td> elements which
looks awkward.  I've tried doing some things where I force in "&nbsp;" into
the query results but it doesn't seem to take take.  Suggestions?  



$result = mysql_query("select show_id, month, day, year, location, details ,
venue 
                      from $database_table order by year, month, day",$db) 
                      or die_now("<h2>Could not select shows</h2>" );
...
   
    while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
       $the_id = $row["show_id"];
       $the_month = $row["month"];
       $the_day = $row["day"];
       $the_year = $row["year"];
       $the_location = $row["location"];
       $the_details = $row["details"];
       $the_venue = $row["venue"];

Yeah, although I probably got the idea from you guys, and just didn't
realize it.

But I digress - these are both two great groups.

This is the one-year anniversary for LIPHP - we are having a party, PEAR
talk and book giveway (thanks O'reilly!) - fun for all!

I'll make the official announcement next week.

As Jeff already pointed out, http://phundamentals.nyphp.org is the
source for this.

I generally setup a hierarchy of include files.  That is to say, a top
level, which creates DB connections, each with different variable names.
The only consideration is if you won't need a particular DB connection
on every request, and performance is that important.  If both of these
are issues, then I'll do the DB connection in a specific include file
(generally where the class/functions that will use it are) or in a
class/function itself.

> 3. What are some things you usually use for include files? What are
some

Organizing code :)  Include files are generally libraries of code,
whether it be procedural or object orientated.  Commonly, people have
executeable code in include files, which I never like doing.  This
means, that IMO at least, include files should only ever contain
functions and classes.

There is one exception to this.  The top level include for your
application can contain DB connection code, setting up constants, and
other application environment settings.  This isn't to say it *has to*
(for instance, people put this type of stuff in a function or class) but
it can.

If you want the borders to show for all cells you need to set it up in 
the table tag.  Try something like this:

<table style="border: 1px black solid" rules="all">

Another option is popping in an <img> tag pointing to your 1x1 
transparent spacer image instead of the &nbsp;.  This is also a good 
question to post to the front end mailing list 
<front-end at lists.nyphp.org>.

Hmm, email program is acting funky, apologies if this is a duplicate

Keep in mind DB is nearing a stable/official 1.6.0 release and it will be
out well before your meeting.  See the change log
http://pear.php.net/package-changelog.php?package=DB for a huge list of
improvements.  Also, check out the improved docs at
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.php

Bummer, I'm out-of-the country that week (usually in Boston so I'm always
out-of-town). Would've made this one my first meeting too.  Anyone know a
good PEAR primer that I can buy (I realize it's probably on line for free,
but I've got lots of time to kill in an airplane).  I'd like to try and get
a better handle on all this PEAR stuff.

Take your (linux?)laptop, and while connected to the 'Net do the folowing:

pear list-updates	// shows updates
pear upgrade-all	// upgrades all installed packages
pear install DB		// excellent DB class :)
pear install HTML_QuickForm	// interesting HTML/Javascript forms

Now on the airplane you have examples and documentation in 
/usr/share/pear (or wherever your PEAR is installed).  Really.  I've 
seen the new DB documentation online (and it is a huge improvement), but 
the examples are also excellent.

That is how I learned PEAR, at least (and it was on planes AND trains) :)

*** Blatent Plug Alert ***

"PHP Cookbook" (O'Reilly 2003) has a section on PEAR and also covers
PEAR DB.

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565926811/trachtenberg-20/ref=nosim

However, I would be remiss if I didn't plug David's new book:
"Essential PHP Tools: Modules, Extensions, and Accelerators." (Apress
2004)

In addition to being completely up-to-date, it has an extensive set of
documentation on many PEAR (and non-PEAR) modules, including: PEAR DB,
ADODB, HTML_QuickForm, Smarty, XML_Parser, SimpleXML, PEAR XML_RPC,
PEAR SOAP, PEAR Mail and Mail_mime, PEAR Auth and Auth_HTTP, XDebug,
APC, PHPA, and MMCache. (Whew!)

While many of these packages have some form of online documentation,
much of it is out-of-date, poorly written, or missing major
portions. In particular, the PEAR SOAP chapter is *far and away* the
best documentation I have seen on PHP and SOAP. The other chapters are
good too, particularly if you like ice cream.

Unfortunately, it's coming out new month. :( But you should buy it
anyway. :)

Of course, "new" should be "next," as in March.

I'll second the plug(s) since I have "every book" :) the contributors 
on this list have written and they're quite good, if I'm allowed an 
understatment.  Having co-authored and technically edited 8 or so 
networking-related books (LANs, WANs, protocols, blah...) I appreciate 
the difficulty of putting together something that speaks to people who 
are trying to learn.

I'm eagerly awaiting the coming titles.

No TCP/IP required... that sums it up perfectly.  I've been told, as a
rule of thumb, not to EVER depend on IPs for proof of anything,
especially on the web.

Agreed... this is a very interesting subject.  Heck, CMU isn't too
far... who's interested in contacting them to see if they'd take a trip
here?

Since we're doing PEAR::DB this month, maybe next month is set for
ADOdb?  Maybe even a face off at the next meeting? :)

Always being someone to volunteer another, David might be a good
referee for that match because he covers both PEAR DB and ADOdb in his
new book.

I'm sure that he'd have already jumped in here, but he's out in
California speaking at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference. :)

There are none.

Well ok, maybe that's a bit harsh.

I think it's important to look at this from a strictly protocol
perspective.  If I'm a fast typer, or have written a program to help me,
I can talk to any web server without them having a clue whether I'm a
"real" user or not.  This may seem obvious, but it warrants another
look.

To pick apart the original question:  "how do you know that the person
who completed the form did so through your website?"  Let's even assume
the site uses tokens to identify and track forms.

1) A malicious user browses around (using a regular browser) to the form
he's looking to attack.

2) Upon arrival at the form, the site gladly generates a one time token
and sends it to the browser.

3) Instead of submitting the form, however, the attacker loads up his
own program, which can send custom HTTP requests.  The attacker has his
one time code, yet can inject any data through a form submission... and
the server never knows that the form submission is actually happening
"through the site" - which I read as "through a browser."

So, there's a second part: "What method(s) do you use to assure that no
one has 'spoofed', i.e., 'forged', a form submission?"

Since preventing spoofing and forgery is impossible (even with SSL) it
really becomes a matter of data integrity.  Assuming important and
highly sensitive information (since if it wasn't an important site, why
would you care about form submittals anyway?), these items can help
prevent problems:

-- know what you send out.  Keep track of forms you've put out on the
wire, and develop a policy for accepting form submittals (for instance
time outs, multiple forms per user id, multiple submissions, not
accepting forms you don't expect, etc).  This can be implemented using
tokens.

-- know what you want back.  This is really the crucial part.  Just
because a <select> field contains certain values, don't think you can't
get something *totally* different (and I mean totally, as PHP code, SQL,
binary, etc).
   -- know the fields you need to have back to accept the form as valid
   -- restrict exactly what the values you'd accept as input
   -- and always/always minimize taking data from forms (or any external
source) and using it directly in database queries, or other inner and
intimate parts of your application

Lastly, with talk of forging HTTP requests and so forth, I've found one
defense against this, albeit certainly not 100% - in fact, this is more
in the "stupid tricks department."  They are Javascript and VB Script.
Why?  If anyone has ever "played" around with client-side intensive
pages, it quickly becomes clear that forging and sending requests are
often not good enough.  Since the page is so dynamic, a runtime
environment becomes needed (to parse and execute the JS, for example),
which can then in turn change what the resulting request will be.
Obviously, this can be circumvented, and is not means to protect your
site necessary, but something I've founded interestingly ironic.

Maybe -- I stress maybe -- you're thinking of the Perl DBI where you can
get a return value of "zero but true" under certain circumstances. Of
course I forget what those circumstances are, and I'm too lazy to research
it. (-:

I agree with Aaron!
If you just put this <img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0"
/>
in place of the null fields it'll solve your problem. An image with height
or width of 1 won't show
any errors on the page if the image isn't where you specify so this way ends
up being pretty portable.
For a small hack it works for me.

> what's a Captcha?

Captcha is an image verification.
it is supposed to stop bots, but there are quite a few people who write
anti-captcha programs (I have had to do some for my work to get around
images)
Here is one I made for my email whitelist that is very effective in
keeping spam out of my inbox
http://lucifer.intercosmos.net/mail/

The source is on the main site for creating them in php.

to get around them you can utilize a program called gocr
(gocr.sourceforge.net) which is a very easily trainable commandline
program that output the OCR chars from an image. You can get around
colors using imagemagik 'convert' and lines are easily removed be
converting an image to black and white, then placing into a
multi-dimensional array in php and identifying vertical and horizontal
lines and removing them.

it is pretty easy, here are some functions for doing it.

<?
// just get and image
function getimage($img){
        global $width, $height;
        $im = ImageCreateFromJPEG($img);
        $width = imagesx($im);
        $height = imagesy($im);
   return $im;
}

// gets a greyscale image into an array
function getimarr($im){
        $width = imagesx($im);
        $height = imagesy($im);
        for ($y=0;$y<$height;$y++) {
                for ($x=0;$x<$width;$x++) {
                        $rgb = ImageColorAt($im, $x, $y);
                        $col = imagecolorsforindex($im, $rgb);
                        $cols = $col["red"]+$col["green"]+$col["blue"];
                        if($cols < 200){ $out = 0; }else{ $out = 1; }
                        $imagearr[$y][$x] = $out;
                }//rof
        }//rof
   return $imagearr;
}

// remove horizontal lines (vertical is an easy change to this)
function dehorz($imarr){
        for ($y=0;$y<count($imarr);$y++) {
                $isaline = true;

This is a good site to check out:

http://www.captcha.net/

Although I can't find it anywhere on that site anymore, the term
originated as an acronym for:

Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart

Hope that helps.

It's a yin-yang balance one must find when deciding on whether to 
include a file for re-use purposes, realizing that there will be  a 
performance hit. Those are two things I think about.

I'd be happy to help out. I don't know if I would be the best ADOdb
advocate but I could certainly keep things moving as a ref.

I am indeed in San Diego now at the etech conference now. Lots of neat
stuff and while not many of the talks involve PHP directly or
explicitly,
many of the random conversations I've had with people result in them
telling me about the projects they're working on that use PHP.

And, in an unrelated note/plug. The chapter in "Essential PHP Tools"
about Mail talks a little bit about CAPTCHAs.

im thinking of creating some simple dynamic hdml/wml pages for a site and

That is exactly what is going on.
Everytime yahoo introduces a new captcha, someone releases a new
"work-around" ..  all the major sites are dealing with captcha work
around programs. Small sites and personal sites are obviously not
targets, but a 'good' captcha combined with email verification is a
formidable foe.
There are a lot of other ways around the captcha's and a lot of other
ways to deal with them.
Font captchas are super easy, training gocr to identify a new font only
requires that you reload a page a few hundred times at most and then
train gocr. (easy to get around those crazy fonts). Captcha's that use
rotated text are the same, except that you re-rotate and pick the one
that matches.. It sounds more difficult than it is.. etc.. etc..
There are also a lot of C programs that can identify points, you can
have those programs output images of just the points and train gocr to
work with those also. (the 'database' option in the newer gocr is what I
am talking about).
There are ones that have you pick three words from an image that has
multiple words overlapping using alphablending. That has been broken
with accuracy of 80%.
The basic idea is, accuracy of greater than 0% allows bots in the door,
they don't care, they can reload all day long.
Some sites you just need to pull legit info, bank sites, advertising
sites etc..
With sites like yahoo that are fighting automated spam-drops, any
percentage is a huge issue.. 

Anyway, yea.. more info than you needed to know.. The whole dark
underbelly of what captcha's are and why you would want to automate them
and why people don't want them automated..

I just finished a project for bypassing one of our partners captchas so
we could automate using curl to snag some pages we needed..  So you say
"captcha?" and you got that... :)

Subject: [nycphp-talk] please test PEAR DB 1.6.0RC6
Message-ID: <20040211080411.GB13226@panix.com>

Hello Yet Again:

Sorry to be crying wolf so many times over the past week, but another
release of PEAR DB was made yesterday, 1.6.0RC6.

The biggest improvement in this release is better mapping of error
codes.  Several DBMS's now properly report duplicate key constraint
violations as DB_ERROR_CONSTRAINT.  The DB_PORTABILITY_ERRORS
portability option was added to ensure consistent codes between
different database systems.

Several bugs related to limitQuery() were found and quashed.

tableInfo() was added for Informix and bugs fixed for InterBase.  Plus, I
eliminated bug I introduced in 1.6.0RC5 that caused 'undefined function'
errors when lowercasing portability was off.

Please download the package and test it out.  File bug reports
if stuff doesn't work or is unclear.

Download:    http://pear.php.net/get/DB
Change Log:  http://pear.php.net/package-changelog.php?package=DB
Manual:      http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.php
Report Bugs: http://pear.php.net/bugs/report.php?package=DB
Home Page:   http://pear.php.net/package/DB

Oh, and if you like the new features, the tons of bug fixes,
and/or the documentation improvements that have happened since
1.5.0RC2, share your happiness via my "Wishlist" page at
http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/donate/donate.htm

If you're curious why there have been so many release candidates, it's
because the initial RC was pushed out ahead of schedule in order to
get something into PHP 4.3.5RC2 so more people could test it.

Thanks,

--Dan

i noticed in projects lately that the "mods" are coming in the form of
something as such:

(3 lines of code)
--- ADD ---
(code)

--- AFTER ---
(3 lines of code)
--- ADD ---
(code)

--- REPLACE ---
(5 lines of code)
--- WITH ---

some have plenty of mod changes so it looks automated, is there a tool for
this?  i mean a diff > patch < diff would do the same thing but it seems
made for those people who just have to open a text editor + do the work
themselves and looks cleaner ...

What do you do on the "receiving" end, so to speak, to verify that the 
key you receive is the one that you generated?

well it's stored w/ the session id so its compared ...

i actually ended up using it in a publishing CMS for players on a hockey
team that wanted to be interviewed and to rate other players, they would
enter their email address + a key was generated w/ the link, and the table
was something like:

id int, session varchar(32), email varchar(50), priv_key varchar(32),
completed tinyint(1) default 0

so there were some comparisons to make sure the player was the actual player
taking the interview.

is this overkill?

I figured you stored it but I didn't want to put words in your mouth.

I use it to detect if someone has a recent version of =
Mozilla/Netscape/IE.  People download reports from the site, and if it's =
4.7 (which is still very common at the university) the reports don't =
work correctly.

Browsecap works very nicely, though.

No! Why create all of those extra requests when the solution is part of 
the HTML standard.  You don't need any hacks or work around you just 
need to set up your table properly. From w3.org 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/struct/tables.html#adef-rules)

rules = none|groups|rows|cols|all [CI]
     This attribute specifies which rules will appear between cells 
within a table. The rendering of rules is user agent dependent. Possible 
values:

         * none: No rules. This is the default value.
         * groups: Rules will appear between row groups (see THEAD, 
TFOOT, and TBODY) and column groups (see COLGROUP and COL) only.
         * rows: Rules will appear between rows only.
         * cols: Rules will appear between columns only.
         * all: Rules will appear between all rows and columns.

Jon,
As far as I have heard, no. There is no intention of using captcha's.
Mostly it is using a unique key sent to each person (much like a key for
a video game or software registration).
If you want some excellent articles and opionions from an expert, I
would suggest looking through the Crypto-gram reprints (available here:
http://www.schneier.com./crypto-gram.html ) It is a good newletter and
has the latest info on e-voting just about every month. And, Bruce is a
cool guy who can drink a lot of beer and still chat you up about crypto
(defcon 5 experience there..)

Hi all,

I just joined this list and just began writing php. I have a problem  
with my session variable and I have no doubt it's something dumb so you  
should be able to help me out pretty quickly. And I thank you all for  
your aid.

Here's the situation:
I have a login script, a registration script and a "members only"-type  
script.
Let's start at the login page: if you are a member you enter your  
username and password and you are logged in and get a message like  
"logged in as George".
If you aren't a member you must register. Once you register  
successfully, you can go to the members only page [here's my problem]  
but it says "logged in as " and then nothing. My session variable is  
obviously registered because the script gets a true result from  
session_is_registered() but the session variable contains nothing. I  
think the issue might be in the check_valid_user() function...

thanks, Greg

Here's some script excerpts:

// registered.php

require_once("images_fns.php");
session_start();
$username = $_POST["username"];
$password = $_POST["passwd"];
$valid_user = $_SESSION["valid_user"];
if ($username && $password)
// they have just tried logging in
{
     if (login($username, $password))
     {
       // if they are in the database register the user id
       $valid_user = $username;
       session_register("valid_user");
     }
     else
     {
       // unsuccessful login
       do_html_header("Problem:");
       echo "You could not be logged in.
             You must be logged in to view this page.";
       do_html_url("login.php", "Login");
       do_html_footer();
       exit;
     }
}

do_html_header("Home");
check_valid_user();
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
--------
//part of register_new.php

    $reg_result = register($username, $email, $passwd);
    if ($reg_result == "true")
    {
      // register session variable

      session_register('valid_user');
      $valid_user = $username;

      // provide link to members page
      do_html_header("Registration successful");
      echo "Your registration was successful.  Go to the users page to  
start uploading your files!";
      do_HTML_URL("registered.php", "Go to users page");
    }
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
-----

// check_valid_user() function used in the registered.php script
function check_valid_user()
// see if somebody is logged in and notify them if not
{

   global $valid_user;

   if (session_is_registered("valid_user"))
   {
       echo "Logged in as $valid_user";
       echo "<br>";
   }
   else
   {
      // they are not logged in
      do_html_heading("Problem:");
      echo "You are not logged in.<br>";
      do_html_url("login.php", "Login");

Greg,
Couple things.
make sure session_start(); or ob_start(); is at the top of your file, 
either right after the <?php tag or after the comments at the top of the 
file (you have comments right?).
Depending on the version of PHP you've got installed and how you've got 
it configured there are multiple answers to your problem.
I'm going assume you've got a recent version of PHP and you've got it 
configured the "right" way.

at the top of every page, start with:
<?php
sesssion_start();

If you want to put some data into a session do this:
$_SESSION["key"] = "some value"; or
$_SESSION["key"] = $value;

In your case looks like you want to have:
$_SESSION["key"] = $username;
(that's assuming you've cleaned and validated $username ( - which you 
haven't in your code..)).

Then when you want to display the username:
echo "Logged in as: ". $_SESSION["username"] ."<br>";

Rather than having a "valid_user" type:  If the user is not valid, don't 
add the username to the session.  It's easier than juggling multiple 
variables that contain similar information.

I also recommend that you turn on error reporting while you code:
error_reporting("E_ALL");

Are the slides from the meeting presentations available anywhere for 
download so that I can take it with me when I am not connected to the 
internet?  The specific one that I wanted was Parsing, Validating and 
Saving Data from Complex XML Streams.

Thanks,

Not per se, that I know of.  You can, of course, download each of the 
pages before going off line -- they're all just plain old HTML pages.

Yes. unpack() doesn't buy you anything here that substr() doesn't. If
$_POST['id'] is "'" or ";'" then $id becomes "'" or ";'" -- there's no
encoding of special SQL chars.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Translating XML to SQL
Message-ID: <00d001c3f0cc$06229470$8b01a8c0@DB>

I'm working on a PHP app that will translate XML to SQL based on a configuration file with rules, and as I'm getting to the end of this project, all the quirks and airbubbles (yes, ok, they're BUGS) are getting squeezed out. And man, it's no fun. So now I'm looking for solutions that may have been created before me.

Specifically, the xml contains information from articles in a newspaper. Author, issue, volumne, section, category, headline, story, etc. This xml we get from an export from QuarkXPress (which is its own nightmare)

I'm trying to take this xml structure that contains NO database specific information and place it into a MySQL database with about a dozen related tables. The trick is that in going through an xml file, there are a lot of contigencies to cover before finally reaching the database. For example, some INSERT statements require the inserted id of a previous insert statement in order to make the records relational (eg. we need to insert the 'story' info into the 'article' table to get the inserted id for the article, which then gets inserted into the 'photos' table in the 'articleID' column.). Some insert statements might not need to happen because the information already exists (eg. an author that already exists in the database). You get the idea.

Anyone have experience doing this? Is there an open source project out there that's working on this? Third party software even?

Thanks for your help,

Eric Rank

Message-ID: <C0CDB9F5E81C234FBB42D84E7853125DC1B8C6@intamail1.inta>

Hey List,
There is a curiosity about the use of the header() function that the
documentation cannot satisfy. I'm trying to find out if there is any way to
trick the func into redirecting to a page a la:

header("Location: xyz.php?arg1=foo&arg2=bar");

But all my fiddling around seems to be fruitless. If header will not work
for this operation - simple redirect with GET args - then what have you guys
found to work for this? A 300-series response, maybe? My next immediate
thought was to output a META tag to redirect. But this is not as universal
as I had thought.

Hello, everyone,

I am working on some pages to create an image
dynamically. I need pass information among different
pages. so I use session strategy. 
But I get wrong data from some sessions at last page.
Most data are correct, only few are wrong. 
Like, I define an array of color. 
$color = array(0=>"Black", 1=>"White", 2=>"Tan");
A text color id should be less than 2, but i get its
id as 16777215, so I can't get text color name from
above array according to the id. But I use same way to
define the background color, it works well.

I am using Windows XP OS.

Does anybody know what's wrong with it? Thanks in
advance.

Trick the function? The function simply sends a header to the Web client.
There is no trickery. It's up to you to make sure the header is formatted
correctly, so that the Web client will interpret it as you desire. An an
example, the Location header requires an absolute URL, so your example is
improper.

These "GET args" are simply part of the URL. The Location header only
requires an absolute URL - any valid one will do.

Hope that helps.

I'm close to finishing an overhaul of a large application and will soon
need to start up the testing, bug fixing, and "oops I forgot about that"
phase. In the past, testing and qa have been handled pretty informally.
They've also been pretty ineffective. Does anyone have suggestions or
how-to stories for how to come up with test plans and procedures without
having the luxury of a dedicated QA department? I'm not so much looking
at things like unit testing as I am more user-related issues, like
making sure an error message appears when it should or confirming that
when a user deletes a database record, it really gets deleted.

 From the work I've done on adodb-xmlschema, I would advise an object 
oriented approach, it really helps to break up the logic.

I would create a class to hold the methods for parsing a document, etc, 
and another class to represent an article.

Once you have a class for the article you can build up all the article 
details from the xml, and finally generate and run the SQL to insert all 
the required records.  You could also use the class for accessing the 
data once it is in the database....

You may also want to create classes for author, etc which could handle 
the logic for updating/inserting the relevant details into those tables.

Anyway, it appears you are looking at a procedural solution right now, 
which will work too....honestly I'd have to have more details about the 
specific issues you are working around in order to give you any concrete 
advice.

I find myself testing arrays for certain values all the time (of course) -

Thanks for your suggestions Dan (other Dan too). I should apologize for
being a little vague in my previous post about the details of the project
I'm working on. I mainly wanted to see if any of y'all had faced similar
XML->SQL challenges and if there might be packaged solution was out there to
solve it.

Parsing the XML and encapsulating it into objects is the easy part in this
project. It's trying to unpack it all that gets a little screwy.

My solution is to do the following:

1. First parse the XML content into a multidimensional array that reflects
the xml structure (After thinking about it, this should probably be a more
structured object)
2. Create a database object to encapsulate the database structure
3. parse an xml formatted ruleset file into an object that will determine
how to execute sql statements.

This ruleset object is the key to making the whole thing come together.
Essentially, it does the same thing as a stored procedure would. The
likeness is obvious now that you bring up the topic. I hadn't thought of
that before. Basically, this creates a 'rule' for each table, and
contigencies for the columns and tables as needed. This also serves as a
place to map out the relationship between an xml file and a database
structure. The cool thing is that I should be able to take just about any
database & XML pair, create a ruleset file defining the relationships &
contigencies, and it should all work. Although a new xml parser would need
to be created for the xml file holding the data in order to create the
multidimensional struct the translator object expects.

Right now, I'm to the point where:
1. I'm looping through the list of tables from the database object
    1.1 checking the rules for that table
        1.1.1 if the rule passes, the insert query happens and returns
                success
        1.1.2 if the rule does NOT pass, i need to look at a different table
                so i go through the process recursively. checking table
rules,
                inserting where possible until all records have been saved,
                or, at this point, ad infinitum

I can insert data, and to a certain degree it gets inserted correctly, but
I'm winding up with some corruption of data, which I'm trying to pin down.
Infinite loops are happening right now... Recursion is cool when it works. I
kind of feel like I'm working magic when it happens, but until that magical
point, it's fairly hair raising.

How are you passing the session data around?  Maybe a couple lines of =

This might sound silly, even demeaning, but have the users use it.  =
Seriously though, go through a beta phase, where real users can begin to =

it (ironic as it sounds).

That would have been nice, but they declined to offer us that or to
provide it due to some policy about that particular data. So in response
we just automated going through their captcha. :)

Some simple function?  isset()   :)  That's the way to do it.

HA! Kind of proves the point that they might as well change their
policy...  but then where'd the fun and the challenge be for you?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Failure to write session data
Message-ID: <402AC886.1040908@optonline.net>

I had encountered an intermittent bug where it seems PHP suddenly is 
unable to write session files. (I had posted this issue in the 
past...here's one of the early postings:
http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2003-November/006397.html)

As an FYI to all, I found the following bug report concerning this issue.

See: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=19022

It turns out, based on what others have posted, that it's a combination 
of factors and sequences of events with no seemingly consistent pattern 
thereby making the bug difficult to consistently reproduce.

Just wondering if anyone else encountered this issue or do I remain part 
of the "lucky few." ;)

Hello, Hans Zaunere,

Thank you very much for reply my message.

Let me tell you more detail about my pages. In my main
page called dealerorder.php, there is a link to
createTireImage.php (<a href="createTireImg.php">Click
here to create your own cover</a><br><p>). 
In createTireImg.php, code like following:
-------
<?php
include ("img_text_config.inc.php");
include ("tbContent.php");
   session_start( );
?>

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>

<form name="detail" method="post"
action="<?=$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];?>">

<table>
<tr><td>
   <table border="1" BORDERCOLOR="blue">
      <tr><td>
      backgroud color: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <select name="t_color">
      <?php
         if (isSet($_POST['t_color']))
            $t_color_def = ($_POST['t_color']);
         $_SESSION['t_color'] = $t_color_def;
            for ($i=0; $i <= 2; $i++)
            {
               if ($t_color_def == $i)
                  echo ("<option value=\"$i\"
selected>$color[$i]</option>");
               else
                  echo ("<option

            }
      ?>
      </select>
      </td></tr>

      <tr><td>
      Text color: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <select name="tt_color">
      <?php
         if (isSet($_POST['tt_color']))
         {
            $tt_color_def = ($_POST['tt_color']);

         }
            $_SESSION['tt_color'] =
$_POST['tt_color'];

            for ($j=0; $j <= 1; $j++)  // only need
first 2 colors
            {
               if ($tt_color_def == $j)
                  echo ("<option value=\"$j\"

               else
                  echo ("<option

            }
      ?>
      </select>
      </td></tr>

      <tr><td>
      <input type="submit" value='Create image'
name='submit'>
      <input name="send" type="hidden" value="true">
      </td>
      </tr>
      
   </table>
</td>
</tr>

</table>
</form>

<a href="dealerOrder.php?backtoindex=true">Back To
Main Page</a>

</body>
</html>

-------

In img_text_config.inc.php, I defined an array:
 $color = array(0=>"Black", 1=>"White", 2=>"Tan");

After create an image, (it will show up in
dealerorder.php page), I need to describe the new
image's content including background color and text
color. You can see it in the code, i use same way to
set these two colors;
$_SESSION['t_color'] = $_POST['t_color'];
$_SESSION['tt_color'] = $_POST['tt_color'];
In dealerorder.php, i have code like below:
$message = "Image Detail:\n";
$message .= "Backgroud
color:".$color[$_SESSION['t_color']]."\n";
$message .= "Text
color:".$color[$_SESSION['tt_color']]."\n";

The error happens here. $_SESSION['t_color'] is right
(always between 0 and 2), but $_SESSION['tt_color'] is
wrong. $_SESSION['tt_color'] shows 16777215. I have
looked at $_SESSION['tt_color']'s value in
createTireImg.php before I go back to dealerOrder.php,
it was right there. After i click the click in
createTireImg.php, it changed. 

Can you figure out what's wrong with it?

Thanks again.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Translating XML to SQL
References: <41EE526EC2D3C74286415780D3BA9F877729B1@ehost011-1.exch011.intermedia.net>
Message-ID: <001f01c3f17d$c620cbf0$8b01a8c0@DB>

After I went home last night my wheels were still spinning about this idea,
and I started re-thinking the design from the ground up, using what I've
learned from this project so far. Currently the use of rulesets makes the
design a little bit too complex. The ruleset itself consists of a list of
tables in the database, within it are children tags containing <if> and
<else> tags. Within those condition tags are statements that would need to
occur to get the value for a specific column. This gets extremely messy and
confusing. Not only do you have to figure out what column relies on the
inserted id from another, but you also have to know what kind of SQL
statements to make. Confused? yeah, me too.

After thinking about it, all this ruleset is, is a combination of
XML-to-table.column mappings and primary key-foreign key pairs. Combining
them gets sloppy, but seperating them seems the way to go. It's much easier
to write 2 seperate files. 1. an xml file with Primary key - Foreign key
pairs and 2. an xml-to-table.column map xml file. I can also say that it'd
be much easier to write a parser for those files. Right now, parsing through
a ruleset xml file with pseudo logic embedded is ugly. Parsing this
psuedo-logic xml is half the battle. Once it has been incorporated into the
rule object, that rule object has to follow that logic. Yuck.

So, since I was off the clock, I cracked open a beer and started putting
together a new design for this project (beer, I find, is the only way to
really justify thinking about work stuff when I'm at home). A rough UML
diagram is here:

http://lo-fi.net/~eric/default.gif

All the objects are there, all the methods and properties are not.

The idea is this, the xml translator has a database property which holds
regular database stuff, but also an xml-to-table.column map and a primary
key to foreign key map. The tables hold record objects. the record objects
are created when the data file gets parsed by the data xml parser. When the
parser gets to an element that holds data, it looks at the xml-db map on the
database object, and knows what table to create a record for. After the data
has all been parsed into record objects for the tables, it's time to insert
the records. At that point, the translator goes through all the tables,
making inserts for records that have not yet been saved, ignoring those that
already exist. If an incomplete record is found during this process, where
an id is needed from a different record insertion, the translator->database
object knows where look by virtue of it's Primary Key - Foreign Key map. If
the id that we need is there, great, grab it and put it in the record. If
not, try to insert the record (or SELECT the record ID if it already exists,
eg. an authors name) for the table that we need the id from. Then you can go
back and save the first record. This process would need to be a recursive
one.

What kind of problems do you think I might run into using a design like
this? Is anything missing?

I'll consider the article idea. At this point, I've done enough head
scratching that I think it'd be nice to save anyone else the grief. I'll
work on collecting and writing up my experiences.

Are you also doing a session_start(); in the other pages?
session_start() has to be called at every page, or in a file that is
included by all your pages.

Keep in mind, that even if $_POST['tt_color'] is not set, you are
assigning it to $_SESSION['tt_color'];

You might want to add a else in there.

Hi Eric,

It sounds as though you've gone through a few beers on this one...though 
that may explain your eloquence ;)

The idea sounds great to me, reducing your problem down to the 
essentials, inserting a bunch of records into a table while maintaining 
foreign key integrity.

My observation would be as follows:

As far as I can tell you have one table which has foreign keys into a 
bunch of other tables, which then may have foreign keys into further tables.

I think the toughest part is going to be the logic which converts an 
<author>somebody</author> tag into a row in the author table and a 
column in the article table...though thinking about it there are a few 
ways it could be done.

I would also be tempted to do the foreign key integrity checks and 
insertion as you parse the document, rather than trying to figure it out 
at the end.  The reasoning for this is that each record is atomic, 
containing all the necessary information for inserting it into the 
database, so it makes sense to treat it as such.  Also, if you update 
all the tables then when parsing the second (or third, etc) record you 
do not have to worry about whether the foreign key was inserted by the 
first, because if it had been it would already be in the database.

I'm looking forward to seeing some code so I can get a better idea of 
exactly how the system works, but it sounds very interesting.  I am 
especially interested because I am involved in a project which uses XML 
to produce DDL queries (adodb-xmlschema) and it sounds as though they 
would complement each other nicely.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] How to create a singleton class in PHP
Message-ID: <402BB1A4.5020602@adnet-sys.com>

Sorry I cannot seem to cut and paste the code from my .txt file to the 
body text using GEdit + Mozilla for Red Hat 7.3, so that was literally 
ALL I could do to get it to you (6K of text was not going to be typed 
over by hand again).

I need to know how to create a singleton class in PHP.  Every example I 
read online does NOT produce a valid singleton; the static variable 
$errorArray's value is lost the moment you go from one class to another.

I'm just plain stuck.  I need a PHP expert who also understands Java 
real well to know what I mean.

Phil

has anyone here gone for the official mysql certification?

any feedback on the tests themselves?  i checked the website and they had
advanced training coming to nyc in march and now its not there, i find it
kinda odd that there would be no interest in nyc ... anyone here thought
about teaching/giving advanced mysql class?  there is no ramp on it, had it
been suggested?

i have not had to use it much but this is the function i have played around
with when i first tried oo-php:

function staticInstance($class) {
    // Declare a static variable to hold the object instance
    static $instance;

    // If the instance is not there, create one
    if(!isset($instance)) {
        $instance =& new $class;
    }
    return($instance);
}

which i got from a good website:
http://www.phppatterns.com/index.php/article/articleprint/6/-1/1/

i think the lack of static variables makes it impossible - something php5
will provide.

Actually I did just that..

class ActionHandler {
 
  function &ActionHandler($errorArray = '') {
   if (!is_array($errorArray)) {
    static $errorArray = array();
   } else {
    $this->errorArray =& $errorArray;
   }
  }

  function &getErrorArray() {
   static $instance;
   if (!isset($instance)) {
    $instance =& new ActionHandler($this->errorArray);
    $instance->setErrorArray($this->errorArray);
    return $instance->errorArray;
   }
   return $this->errorArray;
  }

  function &setErrorArray($additionalErrorArray) {
   if (is_array($additionalErrorArray)) array_merge($this->errorArray, 
$additionalErrorArray);
  }

}

This construct did not give me the results i wanted, for example, in the 
class FileGenerator, it does stuff and if something fails:

ActionHandler::setErrorArray(array('action' => 'Something broke'));

Which is fine.. I do a print_r(ActionHandler::getErrorArray()) from the 
FileHandler class object and this is what I see:

Array (action => Something broke)

HOWEVER... if I then go to ANOTHER class and IMMEDIATELY AFTER I have 
done my setErrorArray() from FileHandler class I do this:

print_r(ActionHandler::getErrorArray())

I see this

Array ()

FileHandler class succssfully sets the what-should-be-single-instance 
array $errorArray, but then the next class after it sees nothing in 
$errorArray.

The construct I want to create is what is in Java the singleton class: i 
want only ONE instance of ActionHandler to persist.. every single class 
can then add to the one single-instance array $errorArray whatever it 
wants and $errorArray will retain everything it gets.

Message-ID: <BCF799A6B63DD411985D00805F9F9033C79A58@mail.alexcommgrp.com>

I have run into a situation with arrays that I can't figure out why value
assigments are truncated down to one byte.

Consider the array

$question['1']=array('type'=>'radio','showresults'=>1,'required'=>0,'questio
n'=>'Does your community post signs on neglected properties with the
owner&#146;s name and address clearly visible to all passersby?',
'answer'=>array('Yes'=>array('Yes'=>'Yes','count'=>0),'No'=>array('No'=>'No'
,'count'=>0)));

$q_id=1;
$val='Yes';
$val1='No';

$question[$q_id]['answer'][$val]['count']=8888;

echo $question[$q_id]['answer'][$val]['count']."<br>";

$question[$q_id]['answer'][$val1]['count']=9999;

echo $question[$q_id]['answer'][$val1]['count']."<br>";


will echo correctly the numbers assigned to 'count' of 8888 and 9999

However for this array,

$question['1']=array('type'=>'radio','showresults'=>1,'required'=>0,'questio
n'=>'Does your community post signs on neglected properties with the
owner&#146;s name and address clearly visible to all passersby?',
'answer'=>array('Yes'=>'Yes','No'=>'No'));

$q_id=1;
$val='Yes';
$val1='No';

$question[$q_id]['answer'][$val]['count']=8888;

echo $question[$q_id]['answer'][$val]['count']."<br>";

$question[$q_id]['answer'][$val1]['count']=9999;

echo $question[$q_id]['answer'][$val1]['count']."<br>";

will echo back 'count' as being 8 and 9

I thought in PHP you could extend arrays with new elements dynamically on
assignment and if you can't, why wouldn't this error out rather than merely
truncating to one byte?

Or, perhaps, I am thinking about this all wrong???

What you want is:

class ActionHandler {
   function &getErrorArray () {
     return ActionHandler::setErrorArray ();
   }

   function &setErrorArray ($additionalErrorArray = NULL) {
     static $errorArray;

     if ( !is_array ($errorArray) ) {

     }

     if ( is_array ($additionalErrorArray) ) {
       $errorArray = array_merge ($errorArray, $additionalErrorArray);
     }

     return $errorArray;
   }

Sorry, Dan, that failed too.  It worked in FileGenerator class, but the 
next class does a print_r(ActionHandler::getErrorArray()) and the array 
value is null again.

It's not immediately clear what's going on in the code you presented, 
but I have extracted the relevant code, which is:

$answer = array (
   'Yes' => array (
     'Yes' => 'Yes',
     'count' => 0
   ),
   'No' => array (
     'No' => 'No',
     'count' => 0
   )
);

$val='Yes';
$val1='No';

$answer[$val]['count']=8888;
echo $answer[$val]['count']."<br>";

$answer[$val1]['count']=9999;
echo $answer[$val1]['count']."<br>";

$answer = array (
   'Yes' => 'Yes',
   'No' => 'No'
);

$val='Yes';
$val1='No';

$answer[$val]['count']=8888;
echo $answer[$val]['count']."<br>";

$answer[$val1]['count']=9999;
echo $answer[$val1]['count']."<br>";

As you can see, in the first case $answer[$val] is an array, whereas in 
the second case $answer[$val] is a string.

What's happening I think is that you are unwittingly invoking the 
(deprecated) syntax for accessing a string by character:

$mystring = 'hello';

echo $mystring{0};
echo $mystring[0];

both should result in 'h';

This syntax can also be used to assign into a string...which is what is 
happening here.

The 'count' is being to converted to the integer 0, and the first 
character in the string is being overwritten with the first character 
from the value you are assigning.

So in the second example:

$answer[$val] is 'Yes'

Then we do:

$answer[$val]['count'] = 8888;

which is equivalent to:

$answer[$val]{0} = 8888;

so $answer[$val] is now '8es'

then we do:

echo $answer[$val]['count'];

which is equivalent to:

echo $answer[$val]{0};

which results in '8'

An interesting little problem for sure.

Just a general question, the board is very nice but how come every board
package doesnt have the option to act as a mailing list (for example
subscribing to all topics in an area), I had to hack this into phpBB for a
group but in a user profile Id just like to be able to receive all posts by
topic:

For example:
[ x ] New York PHP -> Technical Discussion -> PHP

I know there is per thread notification, but if you simply changed it to per
forum notification w/ subscriptions it solves a mailing list problem doesn't
it?  Just a thought ... and thank you Charles Warner!

Hmm, I'm not sure exactly what you mean, could you try to post the 
minimum required code to demonstrate your problem?

Here is a slightly updated version of the code I posted before:

class ActionHandler {
   function &getErrorArray () {
     return ActionHandler::setErrorArray ();
   }

   function &setErrorArray ($additionalErrorArray = NULL) {
     static $errorArray = array();

     if ( is_array ($additionalErrorArray) ) {
       $errorArray = array_merge ($errorArray, $additionalErrorArray);
     }

     return $errorArray;
   }
}

You could also do this via a global variable:

class ActionHandler {
   function &getErrorArray () {
     return ActionHandler::setErrorArray ();
   }

   function &setErrorArray ($additionalErrorArray = NULL) {
     if ( !isset ($GLOBALS['errorArray']) ) {
       $GLOBALS['errorArray'] = array();
     }

     if ( is_array ($additionalErrorArray) ) {
       $GLOBALS['errorArray'] = array_merge ($GLOBALS['errorArray'], 
$additionalErrorArray);
     }

     return $GLOBALS['errorArray'];
   }
}

I found a rather tragic kluge to get my code working again:

class ActionHandler {

 function &ActionHandler() {
  static $errorArray = array();
 }

 function &getErrorArray() {
  return $GLOBALS[$errorArray];
 }

 function &setErrorArray($additionalErrorArray) {
  if (is_array($additionalErrorArray)) $this->errorArray =& 
array_merge($this->errorArray, $additionalErrorArray);
  if (!isset($GLOBALS[$errorArray])) $GLOBALS[$errorArray] = 
$this->errorArray;
 }

}

That produces the results I want every time, and I can't understand why 
I must use $GLOBALS[$errorArray] and not $GLOBALS['errorArray'], am I 
not mistaken that arrays can only take scalar string and/or integer 
values as keys?

That above code failed for me.  Say for instance you're in FileHandler 
class method getBackupFile():

if (!$fileID) ActionHandler::setErrorArray(array('action' => 'Backup 
file not found'));

Ok, right after this line, in the *very same method*, I do this for fun:

print_r(ActionHandler::getErrorArray());

I see

Array (action => Backup file not found)

OK?

Now I am out of the method and back in ActionPerformer::perform() method:

$fileGen =& new FileGenerator($db, $table);
$fileBackupContents = $fileGen->getBackupFile(); // THIS IS WHERE I SEE 
MY FIRST print_r() statement

..and have returned to my ActionPerformer::perform() method, the VERY 
NEXT LINE I do this:

print_r(ActionHandler::getErrorArray());

I see

Array ()

This happens if even I implement YOUR code into the mix.  Instead, were 
I to use $GLOBALS, everything works.  It's the PHP4 version of a 
"singleton" class w/o the singleton structure that I truly believe fails 
in PHP 4 at least 4.3.2 that I'm using at work.

Hmm, that is very similar to the GLOBALS kludge I posted, although it 
doesn't work on my machine.  Each subsequent call to setErrorArray is 
overwriting the error array.

Thus far the best I've got is:

class ActionHandler {
   function &getErrorArray () {
     return ActionHandler::setErrorArray ();
   }

   function &setErrorArray ($additionalErrorArray = NULL) {
     static $errorArray = array ();

     if ( is_array ($additionalErrorArray) ) {
       $errorArray += $additionalErrorArray;
     }

     return $errorArray;
   }
}

and for the $GLOBALS kludge:

class ActionHandler {
   function &getErrorArray () {
     return ActionHandler::setErrorArray ();
   }

   function &setErrorArray ($additionalErrorArray = NULL) {
     if ( !isset ($GLOBALS['errorArray']) ) {
       $GLOBALS['errorArray'] = array ();
     }

     if ( is_array ($additionalErrorArray) ) {
       $GLOBALS['errorArray'] += $additionalErrorArray;
     }

     return $GLOBALS['errorArray'];
   }
}

Both of those functions work 100% for anything I've thrown at them.

We're trying to get a bugtracking module installed on Mandrake 9.2 and the
installation requires the location of the PHP executable. We've got mod-php
installed into apache and all the service bindings for IMAP, etc installed
such that we can see them in the Mandrake system info panel. These were all
completed via plain-old package isntallation, no surprises there.

The crux of the problem is we aren't linux gurus (yet!), we need php at the
console - not through httpd, and we can't find a bloody exe to run or link!
find is not turning anything up either. Are we daft, or is there something
we're missing? Is there a default install location as a SAPI module or is it
just a CGI application?

It works on mine as well.  How it works is a mystery to me, how is it 
working?

Ok, now we have something that works!  Which one works?

Both should function just fine, in each case there should only ever be 
one instance of the $errorArray variable, whether it is a static or global.

The reason the code is much simpler than what you had previously is that 
it is not designed to try and store an instance of ActionHandler, but 
only an instance of the errorArray variable.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0402121932560.6294@thematrix.servequake.com>

Hello everyone,
I released PanamaSuite 0.8.0 - a system to localize web-applications
(for now).

http://panamasuite.sourceforge.net/

Thanks to Hans Zaunere for inviting me in New York City for the
presentation of this product. (I put this credit on the website also!) It
was difficult for me to find a free seat on December! (I live in Italy). I
hope to meet my NYPHP friends this summer!

Here is the ChangeLog:

v 0.8.0 - 2004/02/12:   Matteo Rinaudo
<rinaudomatteo at users.sourceforge.net>
Inheritance of database classes modified
Configuration file 'config.inc.php-dist' changed
Added HTTP Authentication to localeadmin (see config file for user/pass)
Panamasuite is now fully W3C compliant (HTML Strict DOCTYPE)
Error coding (e.g.: Error PAN-12345: error description.)
CSS modified
Minor bug fixes (code cleanup, JavaScript errors)

Try it and enjoy!
All suggestions ARE welcome and appreciated!
Matt

You will need to install either php-cgi or php-cli, your software 
probably expects php-cgi.

Once installed the location of php should be:

/usr/bin/php-cgi for cgi
/usr/bin/php for cli

This is what I wrote based on your code:

class ActionHandler {
 
  function &ActionHandler() {} // LEAVE IT EMPTY

  function &getErrorArray() {
    return ActionHandler::setErrorArray();
  }

  function &setErrorArray($additionalErrorArray = null) {
   static $errorArray = array();
   if (is_array($additionalErrorArray)) $errorArray += 
$additionalErrorArray;
   return $errorArray;
  }

}

so basically I am assuming that ActionHandler does not create a static 
instance of $this->errorArray but instead ActionHandler::setErrorArray() 
creates a static instance of a localized $errorArray which, since only 
one instance of ActionHandler exists, only one instance of the method 
exists, then only one instance of the localized variable exists and and 
that is that.  Am I off-base?

You shouldn't need the constructor, because the methods are only ever 
called as class methods, so it will never be executed.

But you are absolutely correct about the fact that that there is only 
ever one instance of the $errorArray created within the setErrorArray 
function.

Dan

PS, if you wanted to be able to extend this class, you could use:

class ActionHandler {
   function &getErrorArray() {
     return ActionHandler::_ErrorArray();
   }

   function &setErrorArray($additionalErrorArray = null) {
     return ActionHandler::_ErrorArray($additionalErrorArray);
   }

   function &_ErrorArray ($additionalErrorArray = null) {
     static $errorArray = array();
     if (is_array($additionalErrorArray)) {
       $errorArray += $additionalErrorArray;
     }
     return $errorArray;
   }
}

You could then do:

class myclass extends ActionHandler {
}

$myobj = new myclass ();
$myobj->setErrorArray (array ('test' => 'test'));

$myobj2 = new myclass ();
$myobj2->setErrorArray (array('hello' => 'tiger'));

print_r (ActionHandler::getErrorArray ());

Ran into a very weird problem now:

function &setErrorArray($additionalErrorArray) {
 static $errorArray = array();
 print_r("additionalErrorArray: "); print_r($additionalErrorArray); 
print_r(" is array? "); print_r(sizeof($additionalErrorArray); 
print_r("<P>");
 if (is_array($additionalErrorArray) $errorArray += $additionalErrorArray;
 return $errorArray;
}

If I happen to actually be passing an array into setErrorArray here is 
my output using:

ActionHandler::setErrorArray(array('willSelectFileArray' => 'Could not 
locate backup file'));

Output:

additionalErrorArray: Array ( [willSelectFileArray] => Could not locate 
backup file ) is array? 0

For some reason $additionalErrorArray lists as an array but has a 
"sizeof" of 0.  If I use is_array() instead of sizeof() I get false.  In 
short, the static method assumes the parameter is not an array, even 
though it is, thus, the entire method fails to add any additional items 
onto the static var $errorArray because it thinks everything it gets is 
not an array, even though.. it is.

Great... it's off to a great start already, and a very interesting

What version of PHP are you using Phil, also does the code I provided in 
my last email (below) work without modification?

The code you posted below is actually missing a few closing brackets, 
but other than that, adding a line to print details of 
$additionalErrorArray does not cause any issues for me.

I'm using PHP 4.3.2 on the development server box here at work.  Sorry 
about the mistakes, I had to copy over the code by hand as there are 
firewall issues right now between the boxes, so I can't just easily punt 
the code over, but it's pretty much verbatim.  I'll try the $GLOBALS 
code instead.

For one, $q_id is an integer, while the '1' element of $question['1'] is
declared as a string.  Thus, $question[$q_id] has a cast involved, and
it might not be clear how it's being casted, thus resulting in a
associative or indexed array.  Probably not the problem, but if you're
using a number, keep it without quotes.

> echo $question[$q_id]['answer'][$val]['count']."<br>";

> $question[$q_id]['answer'][$val1]['count']=3D9999;
>=20
> echo $question[$q_id]['answer'][$val1]['count']."<br>";
>=20
> will echo back 'count' as being 8 and 9

There's a strange cast happening.  When you declare the answer element,
it's being declared as an associative array, containing and Yes and No
elements.  These Yes and No elements contain strings - not arrays.  So,

$question[$q_id]['answer'][$val]['count']=3D8888

is trying to reference the element named by $val (in this case Yes) as
an array, when it's a string.  You'd need to declare the 'answer'
element something like:

'answer'=3D>array('Yes'=3D>array('Yes',0),'No'=3D>array('No',0));

Then

$question[$q_id]['answer'][$val]['count']=3D8888;

should work as expected.  All this said, I'd rethink using this level of
multidimensional arrays  :)

100% failure on $GLOBALS, even $GLOBALS['errorArray'] never even

function &setErrorArray($additionalErrorArray = '') {
  static $errorArray = array();
  print_r("additionalErrorArray = "); print_r($additionalErrorArray);

Here is a sample of the output:

additionalErrorArray = Array ( [willSelectFileArray] => Could not locate 
backup file ) is array? 0
errorArray = Array ( [willSelectFileArray] => Could not locate backup file)
GLOBALS['errorArray'] = Array ( )

MySQL training will be coming soon, and in fact, we plan to have a
presentation on it in the spring.

Stay tuned....   :)

Hi All:
	I am trying to setup my pop3 server, but port 110 is close.
Since this a FreeBSD machine, I can not find any clear direction on how
to open that port up.  Can someone help?

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Array handling - Why does this happen?
Message-ID: <BCF799A6B63DD411985D00805F9F9033C79A63@mail.alexcommgrp.com>

Dan,

Thank you very much for figuring this one out.  

It is clear to me now that one cannot extend the elements (structure?) of an
array by merely adding on a new element syntactically where elements already
have values. 

I think I was not really following what was going on because of PHP's array
handling flexibility like in this example:

$a=array();
$a['1']['2']['3']='the';
$a['2']['2']['3']['4']=' answer';

echo $a['1']['2']['3'];
echo $a['2']['2']['3']['4'];

Outputs:

the answer

Call me crazy, but I tend to build associative arrays on the fly and haven't
run into this issue until now, so this was of real interest to me.

Got it.. well, not the code working but I can copy and paste now (why I 
couldn't before I have no idea).. see below for your code and its 
results.. it's mixed.  I do populate $GLOBALS['errorArray'], but only 
once, in spite of $additionalErrorArray value which setErrorArray() 
still thinks is NOT an array even though it is!

Phil,

The code you posted below is not going to work, you are mixing the 
static and global approaches, which I don't see the point of at all.

I am happy to help you with this problem, however I don't see what I can 
do if you modify my suggested code and as a consequence it breaks.

Please try the following code without modification and let me know your 
results.  If it does not work, please also attempt to reduce your code 
to the minimum required to duplicate the error.  The reason I ask this 
is so that I can actually run the code on my machine and determine 
whether it is the code which is causing the error, or a problem with php 
on your server.

class ActionHandler {
   function &getErrorArray () {
     return ActionHandler::_ErrorArray ();
   }

   function &setErrorArray ($additionalErrorArray = NULL) {
     return ActionHandler::_ErrorArray ($additionalErrorArray);
   }

   function &_ErrorArray ($additionalErrorArray = NULL) {
     static $errorArray = array ();
     if ( is_array ($additionalErrorArray) ) {
       $errorArray += $additionalErrorArray;
     }
     return $errorArray;
   }
}

You have a typo in the sizeof call.

In addition, the reason you only ever get one entry in the $errorArray 
is that each key must be unique, otherwise you are just going to 
overwrite the old key.

I think you may want to use:

$errorArray[] = $additionalErrorArray;

instead of:

$errorArray += $additionalErrorArray;

or make the keys unique.

Hi Dan,

Doing the foreign key checking while parsing is a great idea. I've walked
through the redisigned process on paper and it seemed to work, until I
started hitting areas of multiple children nodes in the xml data structure.
For example, each article has <story>, <headline>, <issue>, and <images>
tags. The <images> tag can have may <image> children tags in it.

I have this designed so the tables have a 'records' property, which is an
array of 'record' objects. when looping through the records making the
inserts I can insure that the image lines up with the 'photographer' record
because they'd be at the same index in the 'records' across tables. However,
since there's only one record for the issue table, I can't know where to
look for the inserted id of the 'issue' table because the indexes don't
match.

However, when parsing the data, if I check the foreign keys needed for a
record, I can make a record at the index of the table where the foreign key
is so I can find it later....

Thinking about it, there's still a few gaps to fill in, but you're on the
right track in suggesting checking the foreign keys while parsing the data.
I'd like to avoid making the inserts during the parsing. I just haven't
wrapped my head around that yet. Sometimes doing everything makes for
troublesome code to debug.

The keys are supposed to be unique, but I can work on that a bit later. 
 Here is the most simplistic rendition of my code (using your code 
changes verbatim!!) and the results:

class ActionHandler {

	/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		This class will be a static class structure.  Is primarly used to reference a static instance of setErrorArray() method which instantiates
		a single instance of a localized $errorArray variable.  Since the localized variable is called as static only one instance of it will exist;
		since the method called by the class is referenced (prefixed with '&'), and since the class itself is called as "static" reference by 
		avoiding use of a constructor to ensure it is not meant to be instantiated, only one $errorArray will ever exist.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

	// NO CONSTRUCTOR NECESSARY

	//----------------------------------------------------* GETTER/SETTER METHODS *--------------------------------------------------------------


	function &getErrorArray() {												// STATIC ARRAY METHOD
		return ActionHandler::_ErrorArray();
	}


	function &setErrorArray($additionalErrorArray = NULL) {							// "VOID" METHOD (THROWS AN ARRAY CAUGHT BY getErrorArray())
		return ActionHandler::_ErrorArray($additionalErrorArray);
	}

	function &_ErrorArray($additionalErrorArray = NULL) {
		static $errorArray = array();
		print_r("additionalErrorArray = "); print_r($additionalErrorArray); print_r(" is array? "); print_r(is_array($additionalErrorArray)); print_r("<P>");
		if (is_array($additionalErrorArray)) $errorArray += $additionalErrorArray;
		print_r("errorArray = "); print_r($errorArray); print_r("<P>");
		return $errorArray;
	}

	//--------------------------------------------------* END OF GETTER/SETTER METHODS *-------------------------------------------------------------------------


}

class FileGenerator { 

	var $db, $table, $action, $choice, $fileName, $file	;							// PROPERTIES

	function FileGenerator($db, $table, $action, $choice) {						// CONSTRUCTOR
		foreach (array('db', 'table', 'action', 'choice') as $val) $this->$val = ${$val};
	} 

	//------------------------------ --* GETTER/SETTER METHODS *-- -------------------------------------------

	function getBackupFile($db) {					// STRING METHOD
		/*-----------------------------------------------------------
			This will obtain the specific backup file only
		-------------------------------------------------------------*/
		global $_POST, $backupFilePath;
		$postExemptionArray = array('db');
		if (is_array($_POST) && @sizeof($_POST) > 0) {
		 foreach ($_POST as $key => $val) 
		  if (!isset(${$key}) && !in_array($key, $postExemptionArray)) ${$key} = $val;	// SET ALL VARS EXCEPT THOSE WHOSE NAMES ARE IN EXEMPTION ARRAY
		}
		$fileID = @fopen("$backupFilePath/$db/" . $this->table . "/${file_year}-${file_month}-${file_day}_" . strtoupper($choice) . '.sql', 'r');
		if (!$fileID) {
		 ActionHandler::setErrorArray(array('willSelectFileArray' =>
										 "Could not locate backup file /$db/$table/${file_year}-${file_month}-${file_day}_" . strtoupper($choice) . '.sql')
										
								      );
		 return null;
		}
		$contents = @fread($fileID, filesize("$backupFilePath/$db/$table/${file_year}-${file_month}-${file_day}_" . strtoupper($choice) . '.sql'));
		@fclose($fileID);
		return $contents;
	}

}

class ActionPerformer {

	/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		ActionPerformer extends abstract class DBAction which, in turn, extends MethodGeneratorForActionPerformer.
		Not very OO but it works.  Used to override abstract method perform() necessary for all action classes
		as well as the getter/setter methods in the grandparent class to use for error handling, redirection, etc.

		Will either backup or restore database depending on value of globalized $action variable
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

	function ActionPerformer() {}									// CONSTRUCTOR

	function perform() {											// VOID METHOD

		$db = 'phil'; $originalDB = 'oldphil';
		$tables = array('table1', 'table2', 'table3', 'table4');
		$action = 'restore'; $choice = 'full';
	
		foreach ($tables as $table) {
		 $fileGen =& new FileGenerator($db, $table, $action, $choice);
		 $fileContents = $fileGen->getBackupFile($originalDB);
		}
	}

}

That problem right there plagued my XML work a few weeks ago. I ended up
doing it the "wrong" way and putting a CSV list in the tag. I didn't have
time to find/rewrite an XML parser to do that job, even though it's within
spec. It would be to my great advantage is one was located or built - I'm
certain I'm not the only one.

Thanks,

Forcing the keys to be unique fixed the problem and no need to use 
$GLOBALS.  But honestly, this will [probably] be easier in PHP5.

Thanx for your patience.

No problem.

In PHP5 you could just implement it a little differently with 
$errorArray being a static class variable instead of a static variable 
inside the function.

However, if you wanted to be able to have classes inherit from the 
ActionHandler class and be able to call the functions as object methods 
on instances of those classes, or instances of the ActionHandler class, 
the implementation we ended up with is the only way to go.

Hello,

All I did was cut and paste this bit of code from php.net and I get a 
parse error at the if statement.
I don't really see whycome... do you?


function loadjpeg($imgname)
{
	$im = @imagecreatefromjpeg($imgname); // Attempt to open
  ??
  	if (!$im)
  	{ // See if it failed
  ?? ? ?  $im? = imagecreate(150, 30); // Create a blank image
  ?? ? ?  $bgc = imagecolorallocate($im, 255, 255, 255);
  ?? ? ?  $tc? = imagecolorallocate($im, 0, 0, 0);
  ?? ? ?  imagefilledrectangle($im, 0, 0, 150, 30, $bgc);
  ?? ? ?  /* Output an errmsg */
  ?? ? ?  imagestring($im, 1, 5, 5, "Error loading $imgname", $tc);
  ?? }
  ?? return $im;
}

I would make sure you strip out any weird invisible characters and
replace them with spaces. Just select what looks like a space and use
that as the "Search" string.

I've had this problem before.

I saw that beta 4 is available for download

http://www.php.net/downloads.php#v5

I was considering downloading and installing 
a windows binary -- but then I though maybe 
tomorrow would be better (Saturday 14th)

I am not that superstitious (I mean I 
don't wear 'lucky' coding socks or 
anything) but I figure why tempt the

I just downloaded and gave it a test drive.  It's still very Alpha
quality software, but looks very promising... great interface, fast,

Would this be a tool that is comparable/competing with phpmyadmin?

In some respects, yes.  But it really goes further, IMO.

Because it's a client app, running on the local box, you get some
niceities that just aren't available via a web browser.  Nice charting,
uploading, managing, user interface, speed, etc.  The only downside, is
that you of course have to have MySQL listen on the network, which in
many cases, people don't do - MySQL often only listen on 127.0.0.1
(localhost).

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Unserializing big objects
Message-ID: <BC525363.1F980%jmusil@villagevoice.com>


Hi,

I have flat files with serialized generic objects that are quite large --
over 100k. These flat files are written as PHP scripts like so:

<?php 

$foo = 'O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"id";s:1:"2";s:5:"email";s:17:"email ...
 
... 100 kb of serialized data ...

?>

Once included I try to unserialize $foo and it doesn't work. Strangely, it
gives no error either. It works for shorter amounts of data, but there
appears to be a limit.

Is this a limit of unserialize or include?

Since all the data is on one very long line, I tried chunk_split but
unserialize doesn't like the new line characters being inserted into the
data.

Any ideas?

Jim

Sounds like they might be a nice compliment.  Being able to access 
phpmyadmin remotely from wherever I am is very desirable.  MySQL 
Administrator sounds like it has some nice features that can be 
available when one is on his/her local machine(s)...

I use PremiumSoft MySQL Studio (Navicat) which is really nice.  Imagine it
doesn't have all the admin/status info that the MySQQL administrator does (I
use the WinMySQL admin V1).  But it is a nice tool.

Hmmm, this does sound somewhat odd, I found a few reports of people 
using it on data ranging into megabytes without problems.  What version 
of PHP are you using?

Personally I would be looking at a more efficient form of storage for 
the data which would sidestep the problem you are experiencing.

Yeah, serialized data needs to be read as one chunk, you can't just 
split it and read it piece-by-piece.

If you mail me the code that produces the error off-list (zipped 
please!) I'd be glad to check it out for you.

Dan, one final happy footnote:

I was successfully able to convert my ActionHandler class into PHP4's 
closest thing to a Singleton Design Pattern:

class ActionHandler {

  // UNCOMMENT THIS LINE IN PHP 5
  // static $instance =& new ActionHandler();

  function &ActionHandler() {}

  function &getActionHandler() {
   static $instance;
   if (!isset($instance)) $instance =& new ActionHandler();
   return $instance;
  }

  function &getErrorArray() {
   return ActionHandler::setErrorArray();
  }

  function &setErrorArray($additionalErrorArray) {
   static $errorArray;
   if (is_array($additionalErrorArray)) $errorArray += 
$additionalErrorArray;
   return $errorArray;    // THROWS ARRAY BUT IS CAUGHT BY getErrorArray()
  }

}

And then in my main script, index.php, I simply do this:

$ah =& ActionHandler::getActionHandler();
// BLAH BLAH BLAH
$ah = null;

And then with all of my classes I use the "static" type class notations 
to use the class:

if (somethingBreaks) ActionHandler::setErrorArray(array('action' => 
'Oops you goofed'));

Tested it out and everything works perfectly!  Thanx for your help

I have a similar problem in that my DB server only has a local IP address
(and I'm not local). What I did to try this out is upload the MySQL admin
software to a server on my cluster, and run it from there.

After all these years of using Linux on the desktop and enduring the
slowness of X, it finally came in handy. :-)

So, I have an X client application running on a remote server that
connects to a remote MySQL database over a local network and sends its
graphical output to the X server running on my PC.

hi there.

i realize this is not really a PHP question, but it is related to me 
getting PHP working the way I need it to on a windows machine.  :/

on my OS X box, i have several dummy domains pointing at 127.0.0.1, 
so that i can use apache's virtual hosts to have virtual servers on 
my machine, for testing of php projects locally.

i have a project which needs to run on a windows box, and i'd like 
instructions on how i can accomplish the same on my windows box.  i 
already have apache and php runnins, but my messing with LMHOSTS has 
so far not been fruitful.  am i on the right track?

We have had some discussion that there should be an addendum to the
above article to include OS X.  I believe we put a draft article out but
there hasn't been any feedback (unless I'm forgetting something).  Marc,
since you have done this successfully with OS X, maybe we could get the
draft posted again and you could give a couple pointers?

sure...no problem...it's actually quite easy in OS X.

just email me off-list and tell me who to contact and i can send some

What is the exact error? I have had issues with these storing very large
arrays for neural nets.

>

You may have a limit set in your php.ini, remember for serialize, it
also needs to store a copy in memory, so you may want to not have it set
as a variable and read it directly into unserialize from a separate
file.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Question about variable variables
Message-ID: <E1Arja9-000480-00@gull.mail.pas.earthlink.net>

Is there a consensus about the use of variable variables?  I have a form
with multiple rows with the same fields that vary in name by a numeric
suffix.  It seems to me in the code example below that using a variable
variable is a little cleaner.   Is there a reason why I shouldn't use the
first method?


1) Using variable variables

foreach($array as $key => $value)
{

$field = $name . $key;
$$field = foo($_POST['$field']);

}

2) Using arrays

foreach($array as $key => $value)
{

$field = $name . $key;
$fieldarray[$key] = foo($_POST['$field']);

}

I don't think so. I know a lot of people who think it is bad practice.
Their reasoning is never technical; it's social. They argue that variable
variables are more likely to confuse another programmer who looks at your
code, sort of like when you cram too many operations on a single line.

In my opinion, there are situations where it just happens to be the most
elegant solution. But, I certainly feel outnumbered on this one. :-)

Daniel, here's a function from phpTest to illustrate:
(excuse the email formatting)

/**
* Registers global variables
*
* This function takes global namespace $HTTP_*_VARS 
variables from input and if they exist,
* register them as a global variable so that scripts can 
use them.  The first argument
* signifies where to pull the variable names from, and 
should be one of GET, POST, COOKIE, ENV, or SERVER.
*
*/
function pt_register()
{
     $num_args = func_num_args();
     $vars = array();

     if ($num_args >= 2) {
         $method = strtoupper(func_get_arg(0));

         if (($method != 'SESSION') && ($method != 'GET') 
&& ($method != 'POST') && ($method != 'SERVER') && ($method 
!= 'COOKIE') && ($method != 'ENV')) {
             die('The first argument of pt_register must be 
one of the following: GET, POST, SESSION, SERVER, COOKIE, 
or ENV');
         }

         $varname = "HTTP_{$method}_VARS";
         global ${$varname};

         for ($i = 1; $i < $num_args; $i++) {
             $parameter = func_get_arg($i);

             if (isset(${$varname}[$parameter])) {
                 global $$parameter;
                 $$parameter = ${$varname}[$parameter];
             }

         }

     } else {
         pt_exit('You must specify at least two arguments');
     }

}

On old pages built requiring 'register globals' to be on, I use these lines
for a quick fix when migrating to a system where register globals is off. Is
it right? Well, it might not be the best practice. Is it wrong? I DO feel
like I'm cheating when using it, but you can't beat the simplicity.

//first make the $_GET variables
foreach($_GET as $var=>$val){
    $$var = $val;
}
//$_POST variables override the $_GET variables
foreach($_POST as $var=>$val){
    $$var = $val;
}

Message-ID: <200402132150.i1DLoBJ14925@panix3.panix.com>


Based on my experience with Perl, I would have stayed away from
variable variables, since the same tool in Perl (using a variable
value as another variable's name) is Frowned Upon by Those in the
Know.

Here's a cogent summary of the issues the practice raises in Perl:

http://perl.plover.com/varvarname.html

Anyone care to explain what, if anything, is different in PHP?

The PHP site has good info at
http://us4.php.net/language.variables.variable

I don't use personally use them exactly like that.. But for forms when
you have an unknown number of items in say a radio group, they are
invaluable.

i.e.
<?
# to output
for($a=0;$a<5;$a++){
	echo "<input type='radio' name=radio_$a value=$a>\n";
}

#to read
for($a=0;$a<5;$a++){
	$reading = ${"radio_".$a}; // reading the variable variable
	#do something with $reading if it <> ""...
}
?>

That is just about the only way I ever use them, and commonly do use
them. However, the methods in the php.net examples would only serve to
confuse..

For starters, PHP doesn't let you shoot yourself in the foot quite as 
easily as perl does, with respect to special variables that you might 
accidentally overwrite.

I used this technique in cmacs, to allow code blocks that could be 
executed on a variety of different objects, where the objects themselves 
were dynamically named.

It's more complicated than this, but the essence is this:

$elementname = "element".$somelabel;
global $$elementname;
for ($count = 1; $count <= $vp[varcounter]; $varcount++) {
   $$elementname->add_subobject($vp[type], $vp[vname][$count], $vprop);
};

This is a small chunk of code that lets you set the name for an object 
according to a rule, then execute a method of that object. The array 
values passed to the method are also dynamically named.

I can't claim that this is a good idea, but it worked for me.

It's actually a classic TCL technique, which is where I learned it.

I just thought since I'm new here it would be polite to say hello.  I've
been tinkering with PHP for a few years, to the point now where I would even
call it "programming".  Currently working for a non-profit in Westchester
County, mostly managing a database which we moved to the Internet 3 months
ago (from MS Access) now using PHP/MySQL on RedHat 7.3

Thanks for having me.  I enjoy the reading already, and if I ever have
anything to say I hope it's useful.

Ok, but you can do all the above with array keys, so why not use
those?

It's also fairly common in shell scripting, but there you haven't much
of an alternative for namespaces.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] SQL COUNT() Question
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0402131759030.31190@miranda.org>

I am trying to generate some statistics based on basketball results. I
have a table that stores the id of the winning team and the losing
team, like so:

--------------
| win | loss |
--------------
|   1 |    2 |
|   1 |    3 |
|   2 |    3 |
--------------

I want to find the total number of wins and loses for a given team. I
can do this with two queries, like so:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS w FROM games WHERE win = $team;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS l FROM games WHERE loss = $team;

Is there anyway I can do this in a single query? I'm actually less
interested in the win and loss totals than a winning percentage, so
I'd really prefer to just make the database return that number to me
instead of requiring me to calculate this in PHP.

Right now, I'm using SQLite, but I'd switch to MySQL if some
MySQL-specific function (like IF()?) could help me out and there's no
way to do this in standard SQL92.

I feel that maybe I need to use a self JOIN, but I can't get that to
pan out.

You might prefer the simplicity of this:

http://www.php.net/import_request_variables

It's definitely worth looking into.

I believe the problem I had there was that the object already existed in 
the global context, and the above code was called as a callback from a 
function that I couldn't alter which didn't support passing arguments 
in. Possibly, I could have made the global named objects into an array 
of objects, which would have avoided this problem. I don't recall now if 
there's a reason why I couldn't do that.

Granted, this is a fringe case...

Thanks. Turns out IF() is a MySQL specific function (or it's not part
of SQLite at least), but it only took one line to emulate it as a
UDF. :)

Okay, I have two different situations to work through. The first is the 
home test box that I can mess up, er, control however I like. The second 
is a shared ISP box where I don't have a lot of control but the web 
pages are in a sub-directory of my home directory. Thus I can have, on 
both, a "php" directory for include files that is outside the docroot.

On one is it /var/www/php and on the other /home/$USERNAME/php. My 
solution so far, and I'd certainly listen to improvments, is:

   $DOCDIR = explode("/", "$_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]");
   array_pop($DOCDIR);
   array_push($DOCDIR, "php");
   $PHPDIR = implode("/" , $DOCDIR );

I can then:

   include("$PHPDIR/common_html.inc");

And it works on either machine. Are there ways to improve this?

ciao!

That's pretty convoluted.  Here's what I do.

if (getenv('HTTP_HOST') == 'localhost') {
    require '/development/location';
} else {
    require '/isp/location';
}

I tend to put my include info in a php.ini or .htaccess  and then when I
upload move everything but those files.  It's easier with the .htaccess as
you usually only need one.  If you're working with a local php.ini (cgi
installation of php), you need one for every directory.

But with this set, I can just 

include('config.files.php');

on every page without worrying about where things are so much.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] __call() in php5?
Message-ID: <002101c3f468$713dd680$6400a8c0@thinkpad>

i think im a little confused over the method ...

if its placed inside an object to intercept method calls the execution will
stop with the exit of the function being called ... i thought u could use
the function as an inbetween for an overloading function ... ex:

$obj = new Obj2(); // extension of Obj1
$obj->foo();

if Obj1 has a __call() without the function foo() it will work but if Obj2
contains foo() the method will run and stop, so __call() is never really
"called" .. just trying to understand this method ... the __set() and
__get() seem ok.

The __call() method is only invoked when PHP 5 can't find a method to
run. Since you've defined a foo() method in Obj2, __call() is not
invoked when you do $obj->foo(). (Or at least that's how it should
work.)

If you want to have both behaviors, then you need to do something like
this in Obj2:

function foo() {
    parent::foo();
    // new stuff for Obj2::foo()
}

The __call() method should also respect visibility levels, so if you
have a private function foo() in Obj1, and then make Obj2 extend Obj1,
then __call() *will* be invoked, since there's no longer a foo()
method in Obj2.

Of course, my answer would be a heck of a lot better if I saw some
code. Right now, I just have to guess at what you're trying to do. :)

well ... @ the moment just playing around w/ php5 *but* im trying to create
some "dynamic" objects that are tied to a database where you don't have to
crank out the schema at first or at all (or at least that is the idea) so
for example:

$player->setXXX(value) and $player->getXXX() ...

are trapped to something.  i can give the option of using internal static
variables, DB::PEAR, or simplexml just for the sake of testing the object.

sorry for the dumb questions ...

but where are the docs for the built in standard objects/interfaces in php5?
(like Iterator/Exception,etc) ... how many are there currently?

also why are they built-in vs. bundled (like a lib or PEAR)?

ok, not looking to get heckled just looking for explainations :-)

1. first, im really into the fact that you now can declare the type of
objects passed into function *but* why only custom classes?  i know the
beauty of loose type is nice but when reading code it would be nice to see
what i should be expecting + drop the redundancy to need to check variables
over + over:

function foo(String $bar)
function foo(Integer $bar)

i personally dont care if it doesn't do a type check (well would be weird if
it didnt) but would help make the code more readable.

2. will there be a complete generic exception handler built-in or is there
one - did i miss it?  for example this type of simple bad connection error:

try {
    mysql_connect("blah","blah","blah");
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}

is the TCF stuff mainly for new classes being built?  would it not be
helpful to have something like this built-in for older stuff (PHP4/5) or
something in the php.ini:

error_reporting(E_USER_ERROR);
set_error_handler("err");
function err($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline) {
  throw new Exception($errno . $errstr);
 }

like i said i probably missed something ...

For that, you'd just use __get() and __set(). I think __call() will be
used mostly with delegation. I'm still trying to come up with other
good examples. Everything else I have is somewhat trivial.

Alternatively, they're on my hard drive, in the form of soon-to-be
published chapters. There's no yet a lot of good documentation on PHP
5 because it's still shifting around.

> also why are they built-in vs. bundled (like a lib or PEAR)?

So you can rely on them existing in your programs. Alternatively,
because lots of bundled extensions use them.

I don't understand this commment. Doing
print_r(get_declared_interfaces()) generates:

Array
(
    [0] => Traversable
    [1] => IteratorAggregate
    [2] => Iterator
    [3] => ArrayAccess
    [4] => reflector
    [5] => RecursiveIterator
    [6] => SeekableIterator
)

And I get a 65-element array for get_delcared_classes(). I'm using a
recent CVS build (PHP 5.0.0RC1-dev (cli) (built: Feb 10 2004 16:43:19)
(DEBUG)).

Man, that's subtle ;) 

Seriously, I've meant to email you for awhile and let you know that PHP
Cookbook is the single best source of material on PHP that I've found;
so much so, that it's the only book that I own two copies of: one copy
stays at work and one copy stays at home.

I believe this logic is that passing an object of the wrong type is
usually "clearly wrong," while PHP's ability to automatically coerce
built-in variable types makes it less likely that passing in a string
instead of an integer is incorrect.

For instance, what should PHP do if you pass in a "string" that can be
coerced into an integer? This'll happen if your data comes from a form
or a database.

Exceptions only work for extensions (classes) that throw them. Legacy
extensions will not throw exceptions.

Right now, exception support on a language level (Zend Engine) may be
almost fully baked, but exception usage is not. Very few extensions
have been updated to take advantage of this feature. I don't think
you'll really see wide-spread exception usage in core extensions until
PHP 5.1.

Also, there's currently a debate on the internals list if all
exceptions should (a) be required to extend a base Exceptions class
(b) be any damn class they choose to be (c) should be implemented
using a Throwable interface. So, it's still being hashed out exactly
how exceptions should work.

This is just one example of PHP 5 being somewhat schizophrenic. On one
hand, there's a desire to add more advanced OO features and other
programming nicities. On the other hand, PHP wants to remain an
easy-to-use procedural language.

It's tough to create a balance where people who are really into OO can
go object-wild while "regular programmers" can just program and not
worry about all the extra baggage they don't care about.

I personally think this should all happen *before* it hits a signatured
method ... like I said even if there is no checking its nice for commenting,
something like function foo($bar) vs. function foo(String $bar) does not
have to throw a fatal error like a custom class does nor does it have to
cast acordingly - I guess everyone just takes it as a shortcut or names
their variables in a nice way :-)

To be honest the current error handling per PHP is fine, I think its mainly
in what third-party apps comes up with that should be handled neatly in a
standard way, I think its good because it at least *shows* that bad stuff
can happen w/ a method vs. never really checking for it to begin w/ and
helps with security.  Even if there is no real "sandbox" w/ PHP at least
having a trap be *mandatory* helps create better code I think.

Thanks for taking the time to answer the Q's.

Message-ID: <20040217051131.B67454BA73@ws1-3.us4.outblaze.com>

Hello,
I wanted to use a heredoc, because it was easy to send out formatted text.  So, I was using this function I created to print out an HTML form and reuse it on postback.  I know that in a heredoc, simple variables can be resolved.  But I ran into a situation where I need to display a different dropdown depending on the value of this dropdown on postback (or if the $_POST doesn't exist).

The example below is what I was trying to do.  Instead, PHP displayed the if statement as text.

Does anybody have suggestions?  I could try to check the dropdown value outside this function and fill a variable with an HTML string and then insert in the heredoc.

Thanks,
Stephen

One way that I would do it is break out of the print statement, and then
execute the if statement, print the appropriate menu, and then go back
into the heredoc.

Or you could execute a switch statement before hand, that handles the
$_POST variables, and then have a varaible of say $selectstatement set to
the appropriate select code that prints out in the heredoc.. so it would
be like

     I am submitting ...
     $selectstatement
     <br />

instead of that whole if statement.

Personally, I wouldn't use a heredoc for this purpose.  Instead, break =
out of PHP mode, like so...


function printForm()
{

global $errorMessage;

?>

<p>*denotes a required field.</p>

<form action=3D"<?=3D$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']?>" method=3D"post" =
enctype=3D"multipart/form-data">

....

<php

}



I always use this method outputting large amounts of text and it's =
worked very well, and with quite clean code.

I am writting my own site management system that sticks all files except
for index.php not in the public_html directory, and giving browser-based
access to edit files/sections/etc without having to give out ftp access or
anything (site with lots of content contributors) - but this is on a
dedicated server with multiple sites that use different method of
includes... If I would use this method instead of using a global variable
for the "content root" would I just do a
ini_set("include_path","/home/blahblah/content/"); for each of the sites
that is loaded in one of the global include files? or would it be better
to have a variable...

It's wildly ambitious in my humble quasi-lay opinion, and I wish them all
the luck in the world. PHP5 looks so Java-like that I sometimes think of
it as JHP. OTOH if we can have all that stuff if we want it, and ~still~

the best of Perl and Java brought together and optimized to the max for
web applications. Yum. (No offense to the Java-haters and Perl-haters

I'll just chime in that, at least as far as I understand, this is
exactly PHP 5.  All the
write-a-program-in-5-seconds-and-it-runs-perfectly-because-its-procedura
l benefits are still there - and in fact, refined and running better
than they did in the past.

On the other hand, more intricate OO features are available.  I'm for
this, too, since it certainly has its place.

I'm excited about PHP 5, and frankly, wish I had more time to really
play with it (my code over the last 6 months has been PHP 5 "ready" but
doesn't take advantage of it).

I'm heavily in favor or setting the include_path  -  that's what it's
for!  Another neat trick, especially if this is a dedicated server, is
to use .htaccess to set the include path, on a per directory basis.

Of course, I'm a big fan of leveraging Apache to set core aspects of my
PHP environment, and use .htaccess, <VirtualHost>, and <Directory>
directives considerably for this purpose.

Just to clarify, if I do this...

<?php 
function printForm()
{

  // CODE
?>

// HTML HERE

<?php 

} // end function

?>

Then, the stuff between the PHP blocks is considered part of the function and will only execute when the function is called.  Is that correct?

If that's the case, then thanks for the tips. I can rewrite this function using these tips.

Correct.

Remember, though, that the function is not returning anything... it's
going directly out to the browser or output buffer.  This has a subtle,
but possibly pertinent effect, ie:

<?php printForm(); ?>

and

<?=3DprintForm()?>

We'll see how it turns out. I'm worried that this will create a chasm
between first-time developers who are just starting out and the code
that's available online that's written by experienced
programmers. People will download stuff and have no idea where to even
begin to attack it.

My biggest problem with PHP 5 is that nobody is really using it. (I
don't have any hard numbers on this, just a gut instinct.) In many
ways, PHP 4 is "good enough," so people (like Hans) haven't felt the
need to switch their codebase over.

It'll only be once the community starts writing real applications that
we'll see how everything holds together. I suspect it'll take a PHP
5.1 for all the extensions to get onboard and to give us an
opportunity to refine the new feature semantics.

I'm having some trouble getting php to install properly on a new system
(debian installed via knoppix).
This is my first forray into the debian world (former RH user).

Using current stable releases of httpd and php and installing as indicated
in the manual
http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.apache.php
with a few extra configure options...
full configure statement:
./configure --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql --with-axps=/www/bin/apxs
--with-jpeg-dir=/usr/lib --with-png-dir=/usr/lib --with-zlib-dir
--with-ttf --with-freetype-dir=/usr/lib --with-t1lib --enable-ftp
--enable-exif

It's not putting libphp4.so in /www/libexec or anywhere for that matter.

So I can't update httpd.conf to AddModule... :(

ideas? am I missing something?
this worked on a RH system just a few weeks ago

thanks,

Brian

At the PHP conference in New York last spring I remember someone asked
Rasmus a question: which is more expensive, accessing a global or defining
a constant? He said without hesitation "defining a constant." There was
silence for a couple beats, then on to the next question.

I've since wondered if that was exactly the right question. For one tihng,
the guy who asked didn't specify if he meant "...accessing a global from
inside a function." If it's cheaper to access globals PERIOD, then what do
we need constants for? OTOH if it's faster/cheaper to *access* a constant
than a global, should we use constants *whenever* you have a variable that
ain't gonna change and that you want to be globally visible? If *defining*
a constant is indeed more expensive than *reading* a global, where's the
break-even point (in other words how many times do you need to read the
constant to make it more efficient than using a global)?

Or is it such a close call that it's mostly a matter of taste and style?

My specific case here is, I want to stick some parameterized SQL
statements into an included file and avoid hard-coding table/column names
all over the place, and pull in the file and use prepare/execute when
needed. So once again, I'm thinking, should I say

$THIS_SQL = 'select * from foo where boink = ?';

or

define('THIS_SQL', 'select * from foo where boink = ?');



"When To Define A Constant" might make a nice Phundies topic.

Many TIA,

Or perhaps a different format altogether. It's pretty trivial to write
some simple benchmarking code for these types of questions, and people
would much rather reference ours (and our results) than write their own.

This is similar to what these guys do here:

http://www.blueshoes.org/en/developer/php_bench/

I'm not sure what the answer is to your question, by the way. :-) I'm just
rambling.

Hi Brian,

I had some trouble building and installing PHP on debian maybe a month and a
half ago. I'm fairly new to debian as well (and linux too for that matter),
but its starting to warm up on me. Eventually, I did get php to build and
install from the source. However, I built it with a new build of apache2
(also from source) and I think this is how it worked:

When building apache2 I had to make sure to use the debian installed libtool
(/usr/bin/libtool), not the one that came with the new apache2. This was
something I had to do in the configuration of the build of apache2. After
that, the build and install went just fine. Although, I did find that I had
to do a LOT of library installations in order to get the features from php
that I wanted. Woody is quite stable, but has a bunch of older libs that the
current PHP needed... That was the difficult solution.

Here's the easy one:

put this line in your /etc/apt/sources.list file. This site has a package of
the current version of PHP.

deb http://debian.moolfreet.com ./

then do an
# apt-get upgrade

I think that's all you need to do. Restart apache and you should be set.
But keep in mind this advice is coming from a total linux nooobee. It worked
for me though. This let me upgrade to PHP 4.3.4 from the 4.1 that installed
with the general stable install about a week and a half ago.

Check out aptget.org for more non-standard packages you might want.

Thanks.
I should have specified that I am installing with apache 1.3.29
I also should have noted that I apt-get removed apache, php and mysql from
the knoppix dist.

I sorta prefer to do a manual install than to install a package. This way
I can be sure to get the features that I want (or have no success
installing it!!!) :)

How did you specify using the debian installed libtool? I haven't been
able to see any documentation regarding that.

Hi Hans,
Thanks for the tip.  I am aware of this, so I do have another part of this PHP page that will call this function.
I just wanted to make sure that as the PHP is loading, that this code between the PHP blocks doesn't automatically sent to the output stream until I call it.

Shoot, I was afraid you were going to make me remember what the details
were...

I just took a look at the configuration log files and I can't find anything
helpful. So instead here's what I remember. It was a sunday afternoon, and
there were many ./configure , make, makeinstall commands typed at the
console. I kept getting errors at the 'make install' of php4 relating to the
apxs of apache. I googled the error and searched the mailing list postings
that resulted. Eventually, I remember finding something related to libtool.
I also remember choosing to use the /usr/bin/libtool instead of the apache2
version, but I can't remember at what point, what for, or where I made the
configuration change. Nothing I have gives me any indication of what I did.
I should have been taking notes! Now *I* want to know.

Sorry this isn't more help. That's all I got. If I remember, I'll get back
to you.

Eric.

haha... I know what you mean. Half the time I figure stuff out, I forget
to write it down,,, or I think I've finally learned something and it's so
important, how could I possibly allow myself to forget it!

I installed using apt-get, partly to see what the ./configure options are
via phpinfo().
I don't necessarily like it as it's full of crap I don't particularly
need... also there are some weirdnesses in it.. like
--with-apxs=/usr/bin/apxs   but apxs is not in /usr/bin

also not showing mysql info in phpinfo(), but, I didn't install mysql via
apt-get.. is that a no-no when using apt-get?

maybe I'll trash the whole thing and try XAMPP instead, but I really would
like to install the old-fashioned way.

Yeah, apt-get is, eh hem, smart enough to install mysql support only if it
sees that it installed mysql too.

i highly doubt that ... im sure when a final PHP 5.0 is available people
will flock and install it, its when you have a change log a mile long with
each release that people get worried, in fact JSP was pretty much like that,
the spec stayed inside Sun for sooooooooo long and people were eager to use
the new features ... plus Im sure nyphp.org will be the first site to
showcase cool stuff w/ PHP5 ;-)

This is exactly my point. There are a lot of changes in PHP 5, but
they're not getting any real-life field testing before PHP 5 goes
final. This worries me because the time to find the big mistakes is
during the Beta period. (Or earlier, of course.)

IMHO, this is the biggest change to PHP since Ramsus combined PHP and
FI to create PHP/FI (aka PHP 2.). PHP 3 was pretty much PHP 2 with a
better parser and the ability to more easily write extensions (and
minor psuedo-object support). PHP 4 was PHP 3 with a better
parser. PHP 5 is PHP 4 + Real Objects + Exceptions + Interfaces +
Rewritten MySQL extension + All new XML extensions.

In other words, this is the first version of the language that adds
lots of language-level features instead of just concentrating on
behind-the-scenes improvements. (Well, except for PHP 3 changing the
string concatenation operator to "." from "+".) There's a lot of new
stuff and all of the changes materially affect your code.

For instance, do you know that you:

1) Can't run PHP 4 and PHP 5 on the same web server?
2) Need to port all your DOM and XSLT code to use it in PHP 5?
3a) Can *only* use the new MySQL extension, mysqli, with MySQL >= 4.1?
3b) Can *only* use the old MySQL extenion, mysql, with MySQL <= 4.0?
3c) The mysqli extension eliminates (and changes) some functions from
mysql, so porting code isn't just s/mysql/mysqli/g?
3d) Neither set of MySQL libraries are bundled anymore with PHP, so
you need to install these yourself?

PHP 5 has lots of cool new toys, but the transition process will mean
that you can't necessarily download some PHP 4 (or even PHP 5) code
and start using it because, for example, you're still running MySQL
4.0 and haven't yet upgraded because you don't want to modify your PHP
code. (And don't want to run two databases and two web servers.)

I don't want to sound negative because I think PHP 5 is really
cool. It's just that I wish more people were out there because I want
the new features to get some heavy duty stress testing.

Weird. The following gives me a parse error, not the literal text:

<?
echo <<< FOO

$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']

FOO;
?>

...but, this displays the contents of $PHP_SELF:

<?
echo <<< FOO

{$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']}

FOO;
?>

Aside from personal preference, is there a compelling reason to kick
back out to HTML, as Hans suggests?

Is it bad form to use the format below?  Instead of escaping all double
quotes to use single quotes for the tag attributes.

echo "<a href='http://www.nyphp.org'>Link Test</a>";

While that is technically legal HTML, until someone can prove it to me
otherwise, I've never trusted that some stupid browser won't barf on
it.

For XML, I'm willing to do this, since I usually have control over the
parser and I'm willing to trust (for some reason) that XML parsers get
this right.

The term 'technically legal HTML' is about as broad as you can get, but 
yes it is more or less acceptable.  However the convention is to use 
double-quotes to enclose attribute values in html/xhtml/xml.

Personally I prefer to use either a string concatenation or a sprintf 
method rather than embedding variables in double quoted strings in php, 
as to my mind it makes it much more apparent where the variables are.

For the example above, compare:

$link = 'http://www.nyphp.org';

echo "<a href=\"$link\">Link Test</a>";

echo '<a href="'. $link .'">Link Test</a>';

printf ('<a href="%s">Link Test</a>', $link);

Usually I use the second syntax, occasionally the third (especially if I 
were doing a loop), and almost never the first.

I can't really comment on how xml parsers would handle this, the w3c 
specs (at first glance) don't seem to specify the exact quoting method 
which is 'valid', but here again the generally accepted norm seems to be 
double-quotes.

I think it's acceptable... or at least it does work.
but when you encounter an img alt tag with an apostrophe you will have to
escape that...

echo "<img src='image.png' alt='brian\'s image'>";

Define "more or less acceptable."

All I'm saying that the specification allows it (hell, it even allows
you to omit quotation marks of any sort in some cases), but that I
don't trust that UAs correctly implement the spec.

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.2

Whether the convention is to use double quotes or single quotes is a
different issue.

Huh? It's pretty clear (or as clear as W3C specs get):

http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/

Literal data is any quoted string not containing the quotation mark
used as a delimiter for that string. Literals are used for specifying
the content of internal entities (EntityValue), the values of
attributes (AttValue), and external identifiers (SystemLiteral). Note
that a SystemLiteral can be parsed without scanning for markup.

Literals
[9]   EntityValue   ::=   '"' ([^%&"] | PEReference | Reference)* '"'
                          |  "'" ([^%&'] | PEReference | Reference)* "'"
[10]  AttValue      ::=   '"' ([^<&"] | Reference)* '"'
                          |  "'" ([^<&'] | Reference)* "'"
[11]  SystemLiteral ::=   ('"' [^"]* '"') | ("'" [^']* "'")
[12]  PubidLiteral  ::=   '"' PubidChar* '"'
                          | "'" (PubidChar - "'")* "'"
[13]  PubidChar   ::=   #x20 | #xD | #xA | [a-zA-Z0-9] | [-'()+,./:=?;!*#@$_%]

Like I said, if you squint you can see that you can use single or
double quotes.

Right. Half as much work. Unless, of course, you're using Unicode.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] installing mysql 4.1 (windows)
Message-ID: <20040218080330.GA20276@panix.com>

Hi Folks:

My Win2k test box is currently running MySQL 4.0.x.  I also want to be
able to run MySQL 4.1.x at the same time, though solely for testing
purposes.

I'm making progress.  Got the server installed.  Some important points 
were:

1) editing my.cnf to utilize the new mysqld-<version> section syntax and 
altering the relevant settings there...

[mysqld-4.0]
port=3306
basedir=c:/progra~1/mysql/
... etc ...

[mysqld-4.1]
port=3307
basedir=c:/progra~1/mysql41/
... snip ...


2) Installing the service under a different name:

mysqld-max-nt --install mysql41


Okay, now the trick is getting it to work with PHP.  I've got a recent 
snapshot of PHP 5.  Seems the mysqli extension isn't built in (though the 
mysql extension is).  So, am I going to have to compile PHP from scratch 
to get this functionality?

Saw the PHP docs for mysqli say 

   Note:  The mysqli extension is designed to work with the version 4.1.2
   or above of MySQL. For previous versions, please see the MySQL
   extension documentation.

Is that right?  4.1.2 isn't out.  I just tried connecting to 4.1.1 using
mysql_connect().  In order to get it to work,[1] I had to update the
Password column in the user table to "old_password(Password)."  Well, this 
is well and good, but I really need to be testing the mysqli extension.

Any leads to getting mysqli working are welcome.

Thanks,

--Dan

[1] The initial attempts to connect via mysql_connect() failed:
    "Client does not support authentication protocol 
    requested by server. Consider upgrading MySQL client"

As of MySQL 4.1, the MySQL client libaries are GPLed, so it is
*illegal* for PHP to bundle them due to license issues. (PHP is not
GPLed.) For all I know right now, due to MySQL's super loose
interpretation of the GPL, even using MySQL 4.1 in your PHP
application makes it GPLed.

(I will let others field that, see
http://www.omniti.com/~jesus/scriptures/archives/000111.html#more for
one view.)

Anyway, it does mean you need link PHP and MySQL yourself. On Unix (at
least Mac OS X), this requires downloading MySQL and doing something
like this:

--with-mysqli=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config

Note that this is different than what you'd need to pass to use the
mysql extension. I believe mysql_config may be new to MySQL 4.1.

Since I never use Windows, you're on your own to determine whether
this means you need to rebuild PHP, but I'm guessing the answer is
yes. Hopefully, Wez's super-kool build system will know how to do
this. :)

I am also interested in learning if this means that it is illegal for
people to distribute PHP binaries with build-in MySQL support and
packaged AMP installers, either for Windows or Unix. I think the
answer may be yes. If so, I think MySQL is really shooting themselves
in the foot with the GPL. Must talk to Zak.

4.1.2 is correct. According to the MySQL folks, you should be using the
latest bit keeper! (Yes, that's right, they don't use CVS.) I am
currently avoiding problem by downloading snapshots from
http://downloads.mysql.com/snapshots.php. (Don't want to install bit
keeper or upgrade auto tools / bison.)

Note that you cannot (currently) use MySQL 5.0 because not all of the
MySQL 4.1.x changes have been merged into that trunk. This was as of
last week, at least, when I last e-mailed by Georg; however, he said
that Monty promised to merge these changes "soon."

> Any leads to getting mysqli working are welcome.

Good luck. :)

Gah! No you **MUST** use mysqli to talk to MySQL 4.1 databases if you
want to use any of the special features like bound parameters.

You CANNOT use mysql with MySQL >= 4.1.2 and CANNOT use mysqli with
MySQL <= 4.0.x. (And you cannot use MySQL 4.1.0 and 4.1.1 at all with PHP.)

I don't know if your old_password() trick works completely, but it
will probably bork other unknown things. I would guess that the MySQL
folks would consider this a nasty hack. Of course, if it does work
100%, I will be pleasantly happy and will want to know about this. :)

-adam

PS: Please let me know if bound output parameters work correctly with
integers. Right now it is busted on my machine, but I don't know if
this is a fault with my set up or the extension.

PPS: This is what I mean by the fact that nobody is using PHP 5. :)

This may work, but I honestly don't know if it's legal to distribute
this.

I'm not a GPL guru, but I think this would contain linked in MySQL
headers and other files that are GPLed, making this GPLed. The
separation between this and just bundling the DLL with PHP seems
small.

I will try and discover the answer.

Yeah.  Familliar with that whole rigamarole.  Good point, though.  
Fortuantely for Windows PHP users, the mysql extension comes ready to roll
in PHP 5.

Yeah.  I'm not worried about that at this point, though.

Well, I can't say 100%, but at least it passes the PEAR DB test suite --
barring the PHP 5 object bugs we were discussing the other day.

The mysql extension should still be okay, since it's not GPLed. I just
e-mailed Zak to try and learn more about the mysqli extension. I don't
think that can be bundled with PHP 5, nor is it legal to provide a
pre-built binary. (I think this is why they have the LGPL.)

However, I am not a GPL guru, so if others are, I'm open to learning
more. (Note GPL *gurus only* need reply.)

But doing this would proclude me from using a MySQL 4.1 client with
that account, right? Because now the passwords won't match. Still, it
would be a way for people to migrate off of MySQL 3.x/4.0 to 4.1/5.0
without porting from mysql to mysqli. You'd just make a second account
for the mysqli connection.

Exactly.  Not sure about other versions, but I can say is it works with
4.1.1a-alpha.

It seems to me that 4.1 is able to understand 
the shorter passwords.

It looks like the asterisk in the password 
plays an important part here.
(I haven't verified this by looking at any code)

I think that the 4.1 client will take a look 
at the first character of the password and if it 
sees an asterisk, it knows it is going to be 
working with the new (41 byte) password
otherwise it uses the old (16 byte) style password.

I have a 4.1.1 alpha MySQL database for testing.
(running on Windows XP)

If I login from the command line, I can use a username 
with a short password or a username with a long password   
and see the (same) data in my tables.

In terms of migrating from 3.x.x I got the impression 
that you are supposed to use  '--old-passwords'
instead of making different accounts.

This is because if the 3.x.x account user changes his 
password it will be unreadable (being 41 bytes long).

Indeed, you are correct in that specification allows it, my point was 
that depending on whether you interpret 'HTML' as HTML 3.2, 4.0, 4.01, 
XHTML 1.0, or any of the flavours thereof, what is 'technically legal' 
can vary quite widely.

What I meant by 'more or less acceptable' is that while the (HTML 4.01) 
specs do allow it, but the convention seems to be to use double-quotes, 
and as you pointed out this has the greatest chance of being interpreted 
correctly by the majority of browsers.

The other thing I wanted to mention was that whatever style of quotes 
are used, they should be used consistently.  Mixing different quoting 
styles in your documents isn't as nasty as mixing upper and lower-case 
tags in HTML, but it's close.

Thanks for digging up the specs, I made an attempt but it was too late

Right, but in the context of a heredoc, that's moot.

Daniel's message makes me wonder what others think of Zend Studios.  I have
not used it but am considering.

I was disappointed with the only other IDE I tried (Maguma Studio) about a
year ago -- can't recall why, maybe I just couldn't get used to a new thing,
but I felt like the program kept inserting itself between me and my code,
and, perhaps too much a neophyte, I just went back to banging out code in
TextPad. Recently, though, my fingers and my clock are telling me it's time
to move on to a decent IDE.

Anybody want to tell us what you're using to write your PHP code, and why
you prefer that over other things you've tried?

I've used single quotes for precisely this reason off and on since
about 1995.  It never even occurred to me to worry about it.  I've
never once seen a problem with doing this, but then I've only had nine
years of sporadic experience with it so far.

I prefer Edit Plus myself :) http://www.editplus.com/. Very fast and can
open huge files when needed. Has php syntax highlighting and code completion
of most PHP functions. Of course it is not what you would call an IDE, but
my favorite text editor.

I believe, but am not certain, that either single or double quotes
have been acceptable continuously since HTML 1.0.  As I mentioned,
I've used single quotes widely since about 1995 and never noticed
trouble.  It never even occurred to me to give it a second thought
until this day.

I probably first learned the formal description of HTML by looking at
the HTML draft RFC from June 1993.  That RFC describes an attribute as
being included either between single quotes or double quotes.
Therefore, it seems that from day one of HTML single quotes have been
permitted, and were actually the first listed option.

I would be tremendously surprised to learn that some intermediate
version of HTML had broken backward compatability on this issue.

I use Modelworks JPadPro (www.modelworks.com) ... first and foremost because
it is so extremely flexible and worth the price because the guy that writes
it Chet Murphy literally responds to every email/request/bug/question about
the IDE.  I tend to like it better than having a forum to go through or a
company ...

On Linux it seems to be Bluefish (http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/) which
kinda offers the same thing ...

The one part about the Zend studio which is good is the variable tracking it
offers (albeit you need to install the server to get the functionality), so
stepping into functions is pretty clear and nice ...

What Id really like to find is an IDE that can play nicely with MySQL/Smarty
in a visual way :-\

This question comes up at least monthly (and that's fine; it's an
important issue).

But I bring this up because it might be time to start getting things
written.  An article that's just an archive of mail message?  A full

No no... no harm done.  I was just throwing out there that it's a hot

However, there is a slight PHP performance issue with this. Single 
quotes are MUCH faster for the interpreter to process, as there's no 
interpolation.

As a general rule, I understand that you should use single quotes to 
delimit PHP strings whereever you can, to cue the interpreter that no 
interpolation is necessary.

I'm pretty sure that there's a speed difference between this:

echo '<a href="http://www.nyphp.org">Link Test</a>';

and this:

echo "<a href='http://www.nyphp.org'>Link Test</a>";

But it should be easy enough to test.


More particularly, there should also be a performance difference between 
this:

$someurl = 'http://www.nyphp.org';
echo '<a href="'. $someurl .'">Link Test</a>';

and this:

$someurl = 'http://www.nyphp.org';
echo "<a href='$someurl'>Link Test</a>";

I can elaborate on a couple - Block Indent/Unindent has a nasty bug in it.
Once they get that pinned down and dead, then Zend's major difficulty is
that (being Java-based running in Windoze) it likes to freeze and not
repaint, but that honestly happens maybe once a week, tops... The debugger
is /par excellence/ and I really enjoy having it there to use.

When in Windows, Macromedia Studio (Dreamweaver for the PHP stuff)
When in Linux, a mix of vi/bluefish/quanta

I used to live exclusively in linuxland, but the needs to provide flash 
animation and quick layouts made it impossible to avoid Macromedia.  
These tools are quick, solid, and to the point - just how I like 'em!  
The code editor in Dreamweaver (from MX on, at least) has excellent 
indentation features, and the only thing I miss is code folding.  Other 
than that, thumbs up for me.  When in Linux now, the only stuff I am 
looking at is raw code, and usually on the server side, so vi does the 
trick.  When in X, I'll use what I can find, typically bluefish or quanta.

Not a big fan of commercial IDE's as I fear there are too many chefs in 
the kitchen to get what I need with reasonable performance and stability...

Hans, is this a subject for an article?  PHundamentals could work too, 
but it would be excellent to have a 'Top 20' list with a brief 
description of each, just like Fyodor's 'Top 75' of security tools at:

plus, it took me a long time to train myself to use it. Now so ingrained

Yes, in both HTML and XML single and double quotes have both been 
allowed since the dawn of time (basically because both are allowed in 
SGML).  My comment was meant in a broader sense in that it is not as 
simple as saying the a particular thing is 'valid HTML' as the language 
has evolved and what was valid HTML 3.2 may not be valid HTML 4.0, etc.

Indeed, on this particular issue as long as you use a form of quoting 
you should be safe in terms of adhering to the standard.  The major 
reason I tend to use double-quotes is that it makes it easier to include 
quotes within attributes.

In XML you can use the &apos; entity reference to include a literal 
single-quote (apostrophe) within a single-quoted string, however I 
cannot find any reference to this character being supported in any 
flavour of HTML, so you have to use &#39; to ensure that it is 
interpreted correctly by all browsers.

In contrast the &quot; entity reference has been included in both HTML 
and XML specs since at least HTML 2.0 
(<http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/rfc1866.txt> Section 9.7.1). 
This is supported by all known browsers and thus if double-quotes are 
used as the quote characters you can use a literal single-quote 
(apostrophe) or the &quot; entity reference to represent any required 
quotes in a somewhat readable manner.

I don't want to start a holy war over this, and agree that both 
notations are equally valid, I just think that this has turned into a 
rather interesting discussion.

I'll second Dreamweaver MX. I use it for all my web development
(ColdFusion and PHP) and it works great. I only have used the database
stuff (query builder etc) with CF/ODBC but I'm pretty sure you can get
it all set up perfectly with PHP/mySQL.

It has a great text editor, function completion and best of all... a
spell checker!

When in Windows, Macromedia Studio (Dreamweaver for the PHP stuff)
When in Linux, a mix of vi/bluefish/quanta

I used to live exclusively in linuxland, but the needs to provide flash 
animation and quick layouts made it impossible to avoid Macromedia. 
These tools are quick, solid, and to the point - just how I like 'em! 
The code editor in Dreamweaver (from MX on, at least) has excellent 
indentation features, and the only thing I miss is code folding. Other 
than that, thumbs up for me. When in Linux now, the only stuff I am 
looking at is raw code, and usually on the server side, so vi does the 
trick. When in X, I'll use what I can find, typically bluefish or
quanta.

Not a big fan of commercial IDE's as I fear there are too many chefs in 
the kitchen to get what I need with reasonable performance and
stability...

Hans, is this a subject for an article? PHundamentals could work too, 
but it would be excellent to have a 'Top 20' list with a brief 
description of each, just like Fyodor's 'Top 75' of security tools at:

Hi:

I have mixed feelings about Zend Studio.  It's great in concept, but needs 
some work -- at least on the Windows platform.

The user interface colors are messed up, using a combination of user 
defined system colors and hard coded colors.

The debugger much needed, but it causes PHP to segfault sometimes and one 
can't call command line scripts directly.

The code analyzer is quite cool.

Enjoy,

--Dan

Things I like about Zend:
paren and brace matching
function autocomplete, function argument prompting
integrated debugging
runs fine on a mac (dual G5 1GB RAM)
block comment/uncomment

Things I don't like about Zend:
it's contantly asking me if I want to save the current files as a 
project.  As far as I can tell the whole "project" implementation is too 
buggy to use.
It runs so slowly on a WinXP (Athlon 1.8, 512MB RAM) that it is totally 
unusable.  I'm talking "minutes to respond" not seconds.
Price.  In it's current configuration it's not worth the price.

Things I wanted in Zend but was unable to find, (it may or may not 
support these):
customize the default "new" page.
I wanted to create a tool bar with some of my favorite code snippets 
(like print_r())
I wanted more control over the keyboard, what key combinations did what.

In short, I really really wanted to like Zend.  It's almost there.  But 
it's not there in enough ways that it found it's way into my trash, not 
my heart.

I used to use jEdit.  Thought I would try some other tools. (BTW primary 
platform is a mac).  Now I'm playing with BBEdit.  It's incrementally 
better than Zend.

Normally I would have specficied a DOCTYPE to go along with my
statement, but since single and double quotes are valid in ALL versions
of HTML, I didn't bother to qualify my claim.

This is exactly the *opposite* of what I was claiming. I *know* the
standard has (and probably always will) allow me to use either form of
quotation marks. However, since when has it been safe to rely upon
browsers to correctly implement the HTML standards?

My point is that *I don't trust* browsers to actually respect single
quotes as correct *even though it's in the standard.* I'm sure that
I've been burned by this before, but I just can't remember if it was
by some random user-agent back in 1995 that only runs on Mac OS 7.1. :)

Based on James' comments, however, it's probably safe to start using
them again.

I'm a vim guy myself, but have to use HomeSite for my day job. 
There are things about HomeSite I like, which I'd like to see in an IDE that uses VIM, primarily search replace accross mulitple files, I suppose. I've seen you can use Kvim in Kdevelop. Anyone used Kdevelop?

Yes Adam, I am not attacking your statement, but merely commenting that 
this *type* of question can become complicated when dealing with the 
different versions of HTML.

I understand your point, which was why my statement was put in terms of 
conformance to the HTML standard, the issue of browser support is 
completely separate.  I am deliberately not commenting on that issue 
because personally I have never used single-quoted attribute values in 
any HTML or XML document.

What I was interested in was other possible reasons people had for 
choosing one quoting method over the other.

I'm a HomeSite and TopStyle Pro guy but prefer the Mac as my primary
machine at home.

I solved the problem by picking up Virtual PC for Mac last week and cranked
out a site using BBEdit and TopStyle in the PC VM while also testing on all
the browsers I needed to on a single machine.  This is particularly useful
when you can map the same external filesystem from the Mac and from the
Virtual PC.

The feeling of using my own Windows 2000 CD to install the OS (and all its
necessary Windows Updates) on my Mac in its own window was interesting to
say the least (the base edition of Virtual PC lets you use your own
existing copy of Windows or other OS).

It's not the fastest thing in the world (it emulates a Pentium II
processor, I believe) but it's closed the gap between the tools I need and
the platform I prefer.

slightly off-topic, but I just got off the phone with someone 
saying they were having trouble with mail and attachments (using 
Hotmail) with an "older MAC" running 8.1

are there any browser updates/issues I can mention to her?

thanks,

hehehe.  I always catch myself hitting ESC when I am done filling in a
text area outside of vi(m).  Which usually ends up clearing that text
area completely(ctrl-z gets it back) :)

I haven't used any of those programs, I like to hand code most of my 
stuff in BBEdit. But there are a few CSS editors available for the Mac, 
some shareware. Search for CSS on versiontracker.com.
I'm not sure where HomeSite falls in. Is it like GoLive or DreamWeaver? 
You can look for plugins for BBEdit to extend it's functionality. 
There's a lot you can do just with BBEdit. I find the File Grouper 
invaluable.

I do a somewhat similar thing:

On PC I use HTML-Kit, pretty nice for combining the need to do both 
front and back end stuff.  I also prefer Mac but haven't gone the 
virtual pc route yet.  On Mac I use BBEdit, but I've never been able to 
get it to color code php nicely.  Have any BBEdit folks been able to do 
this, am I missing something?

Just set the language to HTML and it should work correctly. Setting it
to PHP only works when you're not popping in and out of PHP.

I talked to the guys at LinuxWorld about MySQL Admin for the Mac. They 
are developing it using native tools for each platform to get the best 
performance and look and feel. Thus they will be using Cocoa on the 
Mac. The big downside, of course, is that you won't be able to just 
recompile it on another platform to use it. They said it will probably 
be available on the Mac about midyear.

Others have pretty much elaborated for me -- I second most of their
remarks. In addition, the server installation was painful on Windoze, and
when I upgraded it trashed my server installation and I haven't had the
fortitude to try it again.

The Project thing -- this has been said -- is either buggy or just plain
weird.

And I haven't figured out how to get Zend to use the PHP binary that *I*
want it to use as opposed to the one it shipped with -- though I might
find the solution with research &/or RTFM

One thing that's screwy on Linux is that if you use US-International
keyboard, as I do, because I sometimes write Spanish, then guess what. In
Zend you cannot, repeat CANNOT, type either ' or ". Try coding that way
sometime. Not fun. They say it's a bug in the Java implementation itself,
sorry.

It also has half-hearted-at-best support for plain HTML editing. If I'm
serious about marking up some HTML I switch to Homesite when on 'Doze,
Quanta on Linux.

On the plus side, love that code completion, love that debugger, cvs
integration is pretty nice (not bug-free however), love that file
inspector thing that outlines your functions... though other tools also
offer some or all of the above.

Yeah it's religious debate but it has to be aired from time to time.

I am now learning how to write PHP not necessarily as flat script but as 
an OO construct, that is, classes, "abstract" classes, "interfaces", 
Singleton Design Patterns, etc.  and it's really helping me out a lot 
toward understanding how to come close to implementing it in Java.

Except for one problem.  The various Java programming and online 
resources (and offline books I have) basically all inform me that 
understanding Java from a "scripter's perspective" is flat wrong, 
because Java is pure OO and involves concepts such as Polymorphism, 
Encapsulation, Inheritance, even things like Beans and Struts they claim 
you cannot know as a scripter but as a pure OO programmer.

So I'm asking the experts among me for advice: should I continue my 
persuit of PHP from what little OO knowledge I have?  Also, do any of 
you share a Java background along with PHP and see any symbiosis 
possible between the two and if even possible that a scripter such as 
myself could cross over into the OO Universe anytime?

Thanx
Phil

I'm sure more answers will be verbose and forthcoming but in short:
Never stop trying to learn more. Nothing about the "scripter's perspective"
makes PHP an unusable tool - in fact I'd bet most of what you'd deem
"experts" still use a lot of scripting (perl, if I had to guess) and code
OO-style all the same.

Objects are a nice, tidy package that allow your code re-use to become much
more efficient once you've got the knack of it. Yes, there are some things
that from a purely procedural approach would be quite annoying. The reverse
is also true - sometimes being strict about OO is "just too much stuff" to
complete a simple task.

To quote Larry Wall - TMTOWTDI: There's More Than One Way To Do It.

Welcome aboard, get a helmet - you'll want it for later. ;)

My background basically I been trained on c++ in college and I took
object oriented programming course and was encouraged to use OO in my
senior project. I now mainly rely on PHP. I had not done any OO myself
since school although I use PEAR which is OO itself.

There been alot of discussion of such things on www.sitepointforums.com 
Especially how OO can be done in PHP and weather MCV pattern is the
right way to do web application and such things. The answer basicaly is
yes and no.

You should focus on the requirements of the problem you are trying to
solve first and then decide which is the best techinique to apply to it.
For most simple web based stuff you will almost never need to code
objects yourself. Although it is almost always usefull to use objects
that others have created such as PEAR. If you are working on a large
scale project you may want to definatly look into OO.

Alot of this comes down to experience although it does not hurt to learn
about it from an academic point of view. Take a look at the book on the
subject "Design Patterns" by Gamma and others. 

On java in particular I rather not comment because I have not had to
much experience with it.

Ok, my formal training was in Java, and I believe that it is definitely 
possible (and with php5 much easier and more efficient) to program php 
in the same way that you program Java.

I initially took the view that php was a scripting language and attacked 
it from that perspective, but the more I code the closer I get to a 
Java-style approach (ie eliminating the majority of the procedural code 
and encapsulating everything in classes and objects).

I think in the current world of php there is room for everyone, from the 
pure procedural 'script' programmer to the OO guru, and everything in 
between.

I think it is more than possible, though personally I prefer PHP to 
Java, and for anything web-related I would almost certainly use PHP 
rather than Java, purely because it is so flexible and easy to use.  As 
for crossing over into OO, just take things one step at a time, once you 
grasp the concepts behind OO you will see plenty of situations where you 
could use OO design methods.  For example there are countless situations 
where you can encapsulate functionality into a generic object, then use 
inheritance to specialise that object for your particular needs.

The 'pure-OO' programmers amongst us may frown on this approach, but I 
think in the world of PHP it makes sense.

I guess I would agree that approaching Java from a scripter's 
perspective is wrong, but the whole topic is a little bizarre. Java is 
Java  and PHP is PHP.
Beyond getting a feeling for what a class is conceptually, I don't 
think PHP will help you learn Java.
I learned them both almost simultaneously.
Could a scripter cross into the OO universe? (where Spock has a Goatee)
Sure!! But can OO get back?

mysqlquery Object ( [sql] => Resource id #18 [mySQLConn] => Resource id

How on earth did that happen?? for some strange reason when I assigned 
the parameters to the MySQLQuery constructor everything is fine: the 
first parameter is a String, the second is a Resource Link Object from a 
previous DBConnection Object connect() method call.  Suddenly, in the 
constructor, BOTH parameters are the very same Resource Link Object; 
what happened to my String?

I might be missing something but I can't find it here, any suggestions?

I've been "trying" to cross over, or at least start writing OO code, for a
long time, but I never can seem to fully catch on.
I am pretty sure I could identify many instances where my code would
benefit from OO, and I've been told that my procedural code is written in
OO format, just without the use of objects.

This may be near impossible to answer, but, what would you say is the key
to "grasp the concepts behind OO" and to put it to use?

I suppose if I forced myself to use it, I would probably figure it out,
and I always feel a little "learning-disabled" for not having picked it up
yet, even after some tutorials, etc, but then Felix comes along and makes
me feel better about it...

Hmm, it is definitely tough to pin down, and I would be no means claim 
to be an expert on OO design.  I guess the turning point for me was the 
idea that rather than working with data you are working with objects 
which give the data structure and turn it into information.

For example, say you have a bunch of news postings to go on the front 
page of your website.  The standard (procedural) approach for php would 
be to view them as a set of rows in a table, and you would write a loop 
to go through them and for each row put each piece of data into its 
place in the output.

In an OO approach you would create a class to deal with the table as a 
whole, and take care of creating/deleting/retrieving news items, and 
another class for the individual items, so that in your application you 
can just ask your news system to display the news, and each piece of 
code is contained within its object.  If you want to change the way news 
is displayed, or add a new attribute, you can just make the changes to 
the news_item class and the rest of your code should work just fine.

Basically you can modularize the code into bite-sized pieces, rather 
than having it all strung together into one procedural blob.  The other 
advantage comes when you decide you want to be able to have reviews as 
well as news, so you create a basic class with all the functions common 
to both reviews and news items, then a class which inherits from the 
base for news items and one for reviews.  By using the OO approach you 
can effectively reuse your code, rather than the procedural approach 
which would have required you to copy and paste the news code and then 
modify it to try and work with reviews.

Mambo (<http://www.mamboserver.com>) is a damn good example of this kind 
of approach to coding, every type of object in the system has its own 
class, all of which inherit from a base class with the core functionality.

Personally I'm striving toward this kind of reusability and modularity 
in my own coding, though it is much easier in theory than in practice!

Felix is right, there are tons of useful bits and pieces of OO code out 
there, just ready to be taken and incorporated into your application 
(one of my favourites is ADOdb), so theoretically you could code a 
'crossover' app by stitching together existing OO objects with your own 
(procedural) code.

Heh.  You sound like where I have been. 
I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out OO, making myself crazy. 
Then it dawned on me that I hadn't had a need that OO would solve. 

Most of my code used functions.   Most of my code used the same functions. 
So I started moving the functions into an included file. 
Then I had two files; one a bunch of functions, and then the code file. 
Then I started organizing the functions into different included files. 
So I had 6 or so possible files and one code file. 
Then it dawned on me that I was creating the effect of OO. 
So I rewrote the files that contained the functions, so each file became 
a single class, with a collection of methods instead of a single file 
with a collection of functions.  (note, as far as I can tell there's no 
real difference between a method and a function in php)  I had to go 
through and change some stuff, like using $this-> all over the place. 
When I was done I had a bunch of different classes that were a bit 
harder to use than the different include files.  After grumbling for a 
while, someone suggested creating a single error handling method that 
all the methods within a class would use. 
So now each class has integrated error handling (error reporting), 
instead of every method. 
Then I could add in things like a timer, debugging information.  
Refactoring the code across all the class-methods is easier than if 
they're just functions.
So:
procedural -> OO is pointless unless:
1.  it makes it easier to maintain the code
2.  it makes it easier to improve the code
3.  it makes it easier to debug the code
4.  it makes it easier to pick up girls
5.  it makes it easier to show off at the users group (see #5)

Almost all the documentation about OO complicates the issue.  It's 
really not that difficult.  If you're not understanding it, it's not 
because you're missing the OO bone/gene/hair.  It's because whoever is 
explaining it to you doesn't understand it well enough to explain.

Relax, drink a beer.  It's not that complex.  If you're thinking hard 
about OO, you're doing the wrong thinking.  Save your hard thinking to 
solve the problem.  Once you've groked the problem the OO stuff will 
flow easily.

Where to start:  take any single function and convert it to a class:
function print_array($array)
{
    print_r($array);
}

becomes
class print_array
{
    function print_array($array)
    {
       print_r($array);
    }
}

Both produce the same output.

Hopefully this is clear and helpful.  Rather than obscure and annoying.

You missed the big supposed selling point for OO:

6. It makes it easier to reuse the code (whether in the same way as
originally intended or in a slightly different way than originally
intended, without having to substantially rewrite).

That's one the main goals, anyway.

I've been a huge fan of Homesite for years.  Love the regex search and
replace, code snippets, fairly stable built in ftp support (most stable of
ide's I've worked with).  I moved to DWMX after it came out, mostly because
it uses Homesite's code base for the editor (at least as far as I can tell,
it does).  The coloring of HTML, JS and PHP (and CF) is near perfect.  Makes
digging through a lot of code - especially other people's - much easier.

Their quasi CVS sucks, but the FTP for DW is pretty solid.  I generally
develop remotely, and I hit Ctrl+S every 5 seconds, and barely notice that
the file is actually uploading every time (they COULD make it even more
invisible, but it's not bad as is).  The php code completion is pretty
decent, the HTML code completion is perfect, and I miss it when I use
anything else. (Typing in a <td> and have the </td> appear immediately is
quite addictive).

My primary complaint with it is the overhead of the WYSIWYG stuff.  I'd
prefer to be able to disable them entirely.  I generally use it as my blunt
tool, esepecially when working on html / php pages, or on sites that
designers use, as a lot of the designers I work with use it, and I can 'see
it as they do'.

When working with more code heavy projects, I tend to go to Zend, but that's
more of a lesser of evils choice.  The code completion and code analyzer is
pretty good.  It gives you help with your defined vars and such, which I'd
like to see expanded to array elements.  I really like their object explorer
for digging through larger classes, although there is plenty of room in that
end for features, especially with php 5 rearing it's head.  I haven't been
able to get the cvs to work yet, but that's most likely due to my own
ignorance.  I'm dying to get into the debugger as I've heard great things
about it here and elsewhere (one day I will have that local dev server to do
so).  The Ftp support is pretty good, although seemingly buggy at times.
Oh, and the projects thing is just bad.

It could be a great resource to have a feature by feature comparison and
multiple reviews of the tools we use.  I know, I'm always looking for better
tools to make my code filled days more pleasant.

My opinion is that you have to look @ the project you have in front of you
and decide on whether its even possible to perform in a procedural fashion,
many of the OO tasks are really performed for having a "state" on objects, a
good example is threading, you cant really tend to develop a server without
some objects having a type of state that go off and do work on their own.

Then again the real PHP catch for me was doing alot more with alot less.
Like in Java do you really need like 5 classes to perform a DB query?  Some
things are a complete overload but they are neat and concise that you can
understand them, to me thats what objects and OO programming really do is
give you a well defined detail on how something works, I can give you a
generic object and you can see how it works and throw it into your app no
problem (like the concept w/ Beans - and the concept of an "interface") ...
however in the end its really all the same, whether you need to learn 1000+
classes in Java or 1000+ built-in methods in PHP youre still doing the same
thing.

I think OO is a much cleaner way to program.  When I first started PHP
before the OO my eyeballs would pop out debugging something.

OO is an abstraction layer, and it's a different way of looking at your 
code and what the component pieces are. When you use objects, you have 
some flexibility to work with and adapt your component pieces in ways 
that are less easy to do with a different abstraction model. The actual 
capabilities depend on the implementation of the object model. It's 
entirely possible to overlay a simple object model on a procedural 
language, and get some of the syntactic and organizational advantages, 
without some of the more complex patterns (which is what PHP's object 
model is).

However, some of Java's huge advantages aren't in the object model at 
all, they're in the virtual machine model. PHP scripts execute 
essentially in a vacuum. In contrast, all Java code runs in the context 
of the virtual machine and can communicate in various ways together (and 
if you extend it enough, across different VMs) - this way of thinking is 
really really different from PHP scripting. It's better for some things, 
overkill for others.

I don't use classes in my code unless I see a real benefit.

One benefit of putting your functions in a class is that it simplifies 
your namespace. For example, if you have a whole bunch of templating 
functions, you can create a class named "Templates" for them. A 
printing function would then be $templateObject->print() instead of 
templatePrint(). You have to be more careful about names clashing with 
the second approach as opposed to the first.

A second benefit is the ability to reuse variables instead of having to 
pass them each time a function is called. Let's say you're going to do 
a number of operations on a specific record in a database table. You 
could create a class called DbRecord that takes the table name and a 
name/value pair to identify the record:
$dbRecord = new DbRecord('color', 'blue', 'table_name');
You can then set up an update function to generate specific sql 
statements and send database queries.
$dbRecord->update('material', 'suede');
This function would set up the SQL statement, 'UPDATE table_name SET

I just want to thank you privately for your excellent response. After 
reading it, I almost feel like I've been through therapy. I've read a 
lot about OO programming, design patterns and conceptual stuff, but 
never sat down and gave OO programming my full effort. I feel I have a 
firm grasp on the concepts of OO, but every time I toyed around with 
it, it seemed more work than it should be, and certainly more work than 
procedural coding.

"Almost all the documentation... complicates the issue." Now I feel 
I've been just overthinking things. I've been looking for the bright 
light and angelic music, when I should have been looking for the cold 
beer next to the keyboard.

Many Thanks.

Thanks to all for your helpful responses.

Chris, I am exactly at that point where I have moved and separated (most)
everything out to functions in included files.

A lot of the stuff I have, I have been able to reuse across multiple sites.
For example, a whole collection of database functions, such that I never
actually call mysql_query directly in my code.
Or another that builds select menus for me.

When I have a chance, I will certainly try some of the suggestions that
have been posted. Between all the responses, it's as though new light has
been shed on the situation.

:)

Lastly, are there any performance gains with OO over proceedural?

I'm doing something similar to that in my PHP app structuring.  I will 
have one front-end PHP script, an "index.php", that will require and 
include .inc.php files that contain classes as well as one .inc.php that 
contains my global variables and functions.  Sort of a procedural - OO 
blend.  It's honestly the best way for me to do app development that, 
well, works for me and ultimately... works.

I built this chain of classes (which normally reside in different .inc.php files due to scope) to handle specific database connections and actions.  

However, I am noticing that were I to replace this line in ActionPerformer::add_dept():

$result = $query->getResult();

With:

$result =& $query->getResult();

All subsequent instantiations of any MySQLQuery objects result in wacky parameter assignments. 

For example, were I to do a print_r after the second line of:
$query =& new MySQLQuery($sql, $this->getDBConn());

The output becomes:

mysqlquery Object ( [sql] => INSERT INTO blah (name) VALUES ('foo') [mySQLConn] => Resource id #19 )

That's totaly ok.. but if I use this line instead: $result =& $query->getResult(); and then do the same actions below this is what I get:

mysqlquery Object ( [sql] => Resource id #19 [mySQLConn] => Resource id #19 )


So my question is this: When should I be using the reference pointer '&' for object instantiation and why?  Based on what you see so far,
hopefully you're able to figure this out.

Thanx
Phil

Brent,

There's nothing wrong with bright light and angelic music, as long as 
you can have a beer too.

My biggest complaint about the "technology" world is the great effort 
done by almost everyone to make things more obscure than they really are.

My description of OO is necessarily simplified.  When you've written a 
handful of classes you'll be ready for the next conceptual step.  It's 
not a conceptual leap.  But for now don't worry about it.   After you've 
refactored a class a couple times you get that elusive bright light, and 
all these weird OO concepts will start naturally, effortlessly making 
sense.  You'll get there, so enjoy the path, drink a beer, write some code.

Just wanted to throw in my 0.02 as well,

Adam makes some excellent points.
The subject of this thread says Java/OO but we really need to separate 
the two.
1. Java programming (and jsp pages for the sake of comparing to PHP)
2. OO programming.
Obviously there is overlap here, but as Adam pointed out, Java's JVM has 
nothing to do with OO per se.

I've done both OO and non OO PHP and have done some Java as well.

1. Pick the right tool for the job.
I know this is a cliche, but there is no one solution fits all in 
programming.
This also depends a lot on what you're comfortable with.

2. Think about the goals, not the means.
You can get most of the main advantages of doing OO even in non OO code 
if you plan it correctly and use functions and naming conventions 
correctly. Doing it OO "pushes" you to design your code in a certain 
way, but you can accomplish the same goals without OO.
You should always strive to write code that is:
- reusable
- maintainable
- expandable
- debug-able
- separation of business logic and presentation
- etc

I'm a Linux guy. I use Emacs with PHP mode and Quanta for the daily work.
I have also used vi(m) and mcedit for a long time.
I have tried Zend studio and Active State's Komodo, but I find them very
slow, although they are great IDEs.
I use BBEdit on MACs.

This might be "blasphemy" in the Java camp, but for me PHP is helping me 
understand how Java-structured OO works out and helps me in my simple 
Java coding as well, though complex Java-related stuff is beyond me.

At this point so is some PHP-related stuff too, like how on earth do you 
do this and not break:

||<? 
$deptName = $_POST["name"];  
$section = $_POST["section"];  
$action = $_POST["action"];  

$html .= "<a href=index.php?section=$section&action=$action&id=1 onClick=\"return isOKDelete('Are you sure you wish to delete Department 
"$deptName"?')\">DELETE</a>";

echo "$html"; // should give you the wrong link will break in PHP but if 
you do '$deptName' will break in Javascript -

$obj =& new Object();

as opposed to

$obj =& new Object();
$result = $obj->getResult();

Could someone please explain this to me in a very, VERY simple

fruitless, they might as well have been in Hungarian.  Sorry but this is 
a serious hindrance in my further PHP development because I always 
thought that by doing this you are saving memory:

$result =& $obj->getResult();

That means $result points the same value in memory as $obj->getResult(); 
thereby saving memory allocation and performance.  How off is that?

My quick and dirty answer is "don't worry that much about optimization for
space unless you a) know you must and b) have working code to optimize" :)

so if you read Passing By Reference and related information, it goes like
this:
Pass By Value is assumed unless you use & in the assignment such as "=&" or
"function &foo(){return &foo}"
Pass by Value is essentially copying all the apples from the apple cart,
leaving you with a cart full of apples, and the original cart full.

Pass by Reference (using &) makes a copy of the apple cart. That means that
if the original apple cart is unset, cleaned up, or changed, then your apple
cart *should* undergo the same rigor.

Pass By Reference is sometimes called "pass by handle" because the words
"Reference" and "Handle" are pretty synonymous to most people.
your snippets:

> $obj =& new Object(); // this is a new Object, looks ok!
> $result =& $obj->getResult(); // this provides you with the HANDLE to the
variable returned in getResult()

If &obj goes away, $result will probably react unfavorably, because $obj is
responsible for all of its members, and $result is actually an "alias" of
whatever getResult() kicks out.

> 
> as opposed to
> 
> $obj =& new Object();
> $result = $obj->getResult();

Simply, now anything can happen to $obj and $result will not change because
of it - you received the VALUE (not the HANDLE or REFERENCE) of the variable
kicked out by getResult()

......however -- and correct me if I'm mistaken here -- because of PHP's
copy-on-write behavior, you don't save any memory by passing or returning
by reference unless you change the data. Another reason not to worry about
it in many cases.

Further -- again, pls correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm just the bat boy
among the heavy hitters here -- PHP5 will pass/assign objects by reference
*by default*, so you have to clone off a copy if you *don't* want that.
The =& notation will become superfluous.

This is correct. In PHP 5, objects are passed and assigned by
reference and you need to use the clone operator to duplicate them.

$original = new van_gogh_painting;
$knock_off = clone $original;

You can control the cloning process by defining a __clone() method
inside the class; otherwise, you just get regular copy of all the
object properties.

Well, so as long as I do not have to change my code as I have always 
used "$obj =& new Object()" as my assignment operation of choice to 
assign by reference (using PHP 4.3.2 here)

I thought this topic was a nice dive in for me to introduce myself to
the list. I just joined yesterday.

My short intro: I'm a PHP hobbyist turned freelancer and student at
university in the netherlands. First PHP experience in 2000 for a
databases class, after that a lot of hobbying and since about a year
PHPing 'professionaly'.

I am not too well founded in the more advanced PHP topics but eager to
learn all I can and am hoping to make PHP programming my (main) source
of income in the near future.

My IDE (I am a windows user for the time being at least, you'll have
to forgive me)? I started out with UltraEdit with a favorite syntax
highlighting and recently have started using PHPEdit. I really like
PHPEdit though I must admit it's the first real (PHP) IDE I've used
and there are certain things I still use UltraEdit for, such as things
that require column mode (i.e. quick adaptions, like when I am porting
from phpBB's template system to patTemplate). And when I need to make
a fast change to a file on a remote server, since PHPEdit doesn't have
FTP support (though I have a peeve with UltraEdit's FTP support not
keeping connections alive and opening a new connection for all files
you save with save all even when all say 5 files are from the same
server, big pain when the server has a slow FTP login process).

Anyway, that's my ramblings, I hope to learn and perhaps even
contribute some in this list.

Best regards,

Can someone help me remember how to do this with chmod?

I have a directory in which I want all files or sub-directories (existing
and newly created/added) to be rwx by any member of the group which owns
the directory.

I thought it was something like
chmod g+s <dirname>
but that doesn't seem to be doing it right...

thanks

Hmmm, on BSD anyway, the sticky bit on directories causes them to be 
append only, restricting the deletion of files by anyone but their 
owners (and the owner of the directory).

What I don't know how to do is just the opposite: some way to create a 
directory that would cause all files added to it, by any user, to 
automatically be group-writeable. (That is, not relying on the user to 
chmod 775 the files they add.)

http://geodsoft.com/howto/harden/groups.htm

This site recommends changing the umask of the group users (about 3/5 of
the way down the article) in addition to setting the GUID bit for the dir
with
chmod g+s <dirname>

"By setting the user's umask to 002 rather than the more standard 022,
files they create will be group writable. If the user's primary group is a
unique group that matches their user ID, then umasks of 022 and 002 are
functionally identical, except in directories that are GUID. In these
directories newly created files will be owner and group writable and world
readable. In other directories, the files will still be group writable but
since there are no other members of the group, they will effectively be
only owner writable and group and world readable."

Thoughts anyone?
I tested and it does do the trick.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MySQL, MyISAM tables,
	<trigger> | <on delete cascade> - Help
Message-ID: <40362352.5090207@adnet-sys.com>

Taken from  
http://www-css.fnal.gov/dsg/external/freeware/mysql-vs-pgsql.html

Triggers:

 MySQL:  No triggers supported now and won't be added in the future.
 Oracle8:In PL/SQL. Possibility of writing triggers reacting on the events:
         BEFORE/AFTER DELETE/UPDATE/INSERT. INSTEAD OF triggers can be 
used for updating data through views.
 PostgreSQL: Declarative rules - extension to SQL. You can specify 
SELECT, INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE
          as a rule event. INSTEAD OF rules can be used for updating 
data through views.
          Procedural triggers in PL/PGSQL, PL/TCL, PL/Perl, C. CREATE 
CONSTRAINT TRIGGER creates
          a trigger to support a constraint.
          You can specify BEFORE or AFTER on INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE as 
a trigger event.

I am having to create a cascade delete effect on table "department" that 
is configured in the following fashion:

-- TABLE CONTAINING DEPARTMENTS FOR PERSONS
create table if not exists department (
 id int not null auto_increment,
 primary key (id),
 department_name varchar(50) not null,
 department_parent_id int,
 unique_key varchar(20) not null,
 record_entered datetime
);

department_parent_id is a "foreign key constraint" (table is MyISAM thus 
no actual foreign key) set up to be recursively
referring to another record (if not null) in the table.

I am having to delete a department; if I do so, I would naturally have 
to delete all child records associated with the department.
Best approach would be to do a "cascade delete" variation (deleting all 
child records first and then parent row), however, only
MaxDB seems to support that (see 
http://www.mysql.com/documentation/maxdb/94/c38409c20611d5993d00508b6b8b11/content.htm 
and
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/InnoDB_foreign_key_constraints.html ), 
however, that seems to be not possible since my tables are MyISAM
by default.  Therefore, I am offered the possibility of a trigger.  
However, the beforementioned article indicates triggers
aren't supported in MySQL. 

What would then be your best recommendation, based upon the need and the 
schema, for me to ensure that all related records are
deleted?  I would prefer not to have to write a PHP script to have to do 
so, but is that all I'm stuck with?

Thanx
Phil

By the way am I offbase by also assuming that in PHP version 5 I would 
be ensuring that if an object is to be a Singleton, I would have to 
"turn off" cloning:

 public function __clone() {
   trigger_error("Cloning of this object is not supported", E_USER_ERROR);
 }

MyIsam doesn't support foreign key constraints but InnoDB does. If you use
InnoDB tables you can have cascading deletes.

Alternatively, tho you said you want to avoid it, you can do it yourself
in the middle tier (PHP) -- it ain't that hard.

See, e.g., "MySQL" by Paul DuBois, 2nd edition.

I know I can't use foreign key constraints; my tables are MyISAM tables. 
 I was hoping for a back-end script (in TCL which I know natively)
that would mimic the behavior of a cascade function, that way it is not 
being done in the middle-tier and perhaps might be a performance-saving
option.

My recommendation is to look at using a more powerful structure to 
represent the relationship between your departments.  Specifically I 
would recommend Joe Celko's Nested Sets or a variation thereof.

You can find a lot of information in the archives of this list and the 
nyphp-dev list, and also plenty of resources on the net. A good place to 
start would be:

<http://www.intelligententerprise.com/001020/celko.jhtml>

This approach has many advantages, and would allow you to accomplish 
this type of delete quite efficiently, as well as offering additional 
ways to work with the data, such as a one-query answer to the problem of 
retrieving all ancestor or descendant departments.

Interesting! I'll let you know what I think as soon as I get done

Hehe, getting your head around the concept can be an 'interesting' 
experience, but the system can be very powerful indeed.

Personally I use a variation which retains the parent_id field, allowing 
easy retrieval of direct parents and children, and also the ability to 
rebuild trees should they become severely monged.

The biggest project I've applied this to has been phpGACL 
(<http://phpgacl.sourceforge.net/>), approximately doubling the speed of 
the program.

Interesting.. I'll look into that more, but the article does not 
indicate whether this approach works for a very simple MySQL 3.23 model 
MyISAM table.  If it doesn't implementing this would be fine, provided 
we tell every client that looks into our custom-built app to upgrade 
everything from PHP and MySQL on down before they can use our app they 
bought.

for now, using more "open source" tools, I built a TCL script to perform 
the recursive cascading action upon the table by doing an exec on a 
shell script I wrote to do command-line mysql commands.

I think you could have just said:

(without repeating so much of the thread)
and adding:
"Do you think that approach would work 
with a very simple MySQL 3.23 model ?"

The point being: your thought was not so

The differences between MySQL 4.x and 3.23.x are not that great when 
dealing with the simple SQL required for this type of system, and thus 
far in all my PHP work I haven't found a situation where you can't come 
up with a solution which will work with the 2 different flavours of 
MySQL.  Admittedly I try to restrict myself to code which will also 
function on PostgreSQL, Oracle and MSSQL, but my point is that the 
majority of problems can be solved without having to resort to vendor or 
release-specific SQL extensions, if that is what is required.

As for using a shell script to execute queries through the MySQL 
command-line client, my opinion is that it is a Bad Thing.  Admittedly 
you don't have the advantage of being able to use transactions anyway, 
but by designing your system this way you are not only breaking up what 
should really be an atomic database operation into several different 
parts, but also creating a solution which cannot be easily upgraded to 
take advantage of features such as transaction support.

Hi All-

Just want to lower the level of discourse on this list for a few 
minutes. I have a newbie question for youze.

I'm trying to build an extranet where "producers" can log in and create 
mini-sites where they can post pics and movs so their clients can view 
the progress of certain projects. Once a producer logs in he's greeted 
with a page that lists all his current active extranets. I want to make 
the list "hotlinked" so the producer can just click on the name of a 
mini-site and gets to the mini-site admin page where he can 
upload/delete movs and pics. If all the hyperlinks just link to a 
"mini_site_admin.php" file, how can I send the information pertaining 
to what link was actually clicked (hence identifying which mini-site is 
gonna get updated). Does it have something to do with $_SESSION[] 
variables?

I suppose I could build it as a form and have a little radio button 
select which mini-site i want to update and then have a "submit" 
button, but I think it would be more intuitive to just click on the 
name. Have any suggestions?

BTW, Adam, PHP Cookbook is pretty damn wicked.

Thanks,
Greg

you can string a GET argument into the URL:
href="mini_site_admin.php?site=my_site&foo=bar"...

Then use the $_REQUEST array in the target page to sort it out and display
the right content.

It's eeeee-z.

Any reason why linking to "mini_site_admin.php?site=$sitename" wouldn't 
work?

mini_site_admin.php checks for $_GET['sitename'] early on, and if found 
sets $_SESSION['sitename'], which is used for subsequent requests.

You do have a point.. I guess I just can't think of a solution that 
would fit the current environment.  However,  I would think that 
allowing for futuristic transactional support is in order by providing 
OO-level switches that determine the flavor of your MySQL and act 
accordingly.

Sorry, but I don't understand the term "atomic" in this case.

You might want to look into using wild card DNS and using the client 
name for the prefix for the host name.
Wild card DNS means that you can forward http://<blah>.mysite.com to 
your site where blah can be anything.

I'm assuming each mini-site has a unique string you could use.
You could then have URLs in the form of:
http://mini-site1.mysite.com/
http://mini-site2.mysite.com/
etc.

You then always know what client mini-site you are in solely from the 
host name.
Something along the lines of:

$host_array = explode (".",$_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]);
$mini_site_name = $host_array[0];

This way you always have the site name available.

You can't... the sticky bit (as a group) sets the files created within a
directory to be owned the group of the directory.  You could set a
umask, however (unless I'm missing something here).

Great!  Though why you would need separate SQL for the 2 versions of 
MySQL is still something of a mystery to me, what exactly are you trying 
to do that would cause problems with 3.23.x?

> Sorry, but I don't understand the term "atomic" in this case.

What I mean by 'atomic' is that the operation should (theoretically) be 
a single indivisible operation.  Unfortunately this is a dream which is 
almost always unattainable.

What transactions do is to try and 'fake' this by letting you either 
commit or rollback the entire transaction as one unit, effectively 
turning your sequence of SQL commands into a single entity.

On a side note, you can easily implement transaction support in your 
existing code (as well as support multiple databases) if you use the 
ADOdb database abstraction layer (I'm sure PEAR::DB can do it to, but I 
use ADOdb).  Using these systems you can write code which will take 
advantage of transaction support if it is available, but still work on 
databases which do not support transactions.

At that same conference I chatted with Zeev about this issue, too.  He
concured, and said that defining a constant is more expensive than
setting a variable.

However, somehow I knew he wasn't telling the whole story, so I asked
why... and why would anyone want a constant, aside from being static and
globally scoped.

He said that using constants, once defined, are less expensive than
variables.  So I said... "hah, thought you'd say something like that..."

Now that's a classic case of too narrow a scope for a question to be useful
and relevant.

...but at least you didn't get "Ummmmmm because Rasmus said it was, and I

Heh! Which raises the question, then, how many times to you need to read a
constant to break even on that up-front expense, as it were, as compared
to a variable?

Maybe this is angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin stuff.

But *parsing* the code that contains constants doesn't cost different from
parsing code containing variables, or does it? If not, and if the accesses
are wrapped in "if" blocks, whose execution depends on chance,then you'd
have to devise some sophisticated benchmarking to simulate the real world
and discover the answer..... ergo, I think it's time to go get a beer and
forget this.

Realistically when compared to all of the other possible optimisations 
you could perform, this is pretty low on the list.

Personally I use constants for data which is just that, something which 
is not going to be different depending on the time of day, direction of 
the wind, etc.  Anything else that I need either goes into the 
appropriate class or $GLOBALS['config'].

I am with Dan here. I rarely use constants, but when I do they're for
stuff like PI. (Okay, that's built in, but you get the point.)

Worrying about speed here is far less worrysome that accidentally
defining the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle. :)

Message-ID: <20040221215844.GA2362@uranus.faber.nom>

Hi Gang,

I'm new to the list and am in need of some expert advise.  I'm a Linux
consultant in New Jersey and PHP is one of my favorite languages
although I don't get to use it much.

One of my clients wants their website redone from scratch.  Nothing
fancy mind you, just your basic database-backed ecommerce with a
brochure-ware front-end but it does have two interesting specifications.

The one specification is the database back-end is a PICK database
implemented under Linux as jBASE.  For this reason, I can't use any
off-theshelf ecommerce packages since everyone I've come across save one
is more or less hardcoded for MySQL and or Postgresql.  There is one
person in CA that knows how to connect PHP to the jBASE database, but he
isn't talking. At least not yet.

But that's not why I'm writing to you today. The problem I'm asking you
guys about deals with the second spec.  I want the site to be easily
modified by a non-geek who knows/can learn simple HTML.  

You can see the test site by looking at http://www.trimline.us/test.

What I was thinking of doing was to take sections and put them in
separate HTML files.  The "What's new" section and the main content area
are done like that.  I simply do a  include("whatsnew.html") in the
index.php file and be done with it.  The non-geek can easily edit the
file with simple HTML.

The probelm I'm running into deals with the menu bar and the shortcuts
sections.  I'd like to be able to click on "FAQ" and have faq.html
appear in the main content area.

On my site (http://www.linuxnj.com) I've done this by passing the
variable $newpage back and forth, e.g. the URL for the  "Services" link
is "http://www.linuxnj.com/index.php?newpage=tech".  This requires
register_globals be turned on. BTW, the entire left sidebar is in a
separate file that is included().

I do NOT want register_globas on in my client's site. So I've registered
a variable called $_ENV["newpage"].  MY problem is I can't figure out
how to set the variable when a user clicks on the "FAQ" link.  On top of
that, I'm afraid I need to put PHP code in the shortcuts.html file,
which makes it more complicated for my end-user.

Hmmm, I didn't mean to ramble on so much, especially for my first post.
Sorry about that.  So does anyone have any ideas how to pull this off?
Or at least any good keywords to google with?

 I dont think that register_globals is your problem. register_globals
has to do weather you can access a variable from Query string in a
shortcut(possible insecure) way. You can alwasy get to Query string with
$_GET.

You want to keep state between requests but you dont watn to make a
Query string in the url.  You can use Sessions. I dont know how the ENV
works that you use, at first i thought that would not work because
apache may be running in deferent processes so not all php requests
would have access to the same environment.

I think you can potentialy do all kinds of stuff with mod_rewrite and
set ENV with the RewriteRules.  You can have different urls that all get
rewriten to the same php script and in the rewrite rule you can set the
original url into the ENV so the php script can access it.  I dont dont
have the code you would have to write it yourself or find it online.

I guess that's a better idea.  I can't see any harm in putting the page
name in the URL, but it is ugly. Let me go play with that...

Thanks.

To me this would be the big problem ... since it accounts for 90% of any
dynamic website, im interested too in how someone would connect to this db,
would it be JDBC/Java/PHP?  ODBC?  Pretty interesting problem ...

Well, there is an ODBC driver for it, but it's use is mainly from/to
Windows boxen.  There is a Python connector for it as well. 
There is a way to connect directly via PHP; I just have
to find out how.

Once I find out, I'll be happy to tell y'all.

Do you work much with PICK/jBASE?

I know several people, including myself, who have used PHP to speak to a
Pick database (jBase implementation included). I can put you in contact
with someone, if that's helpful.

I decided to go find out just what the heck a PICK database is.

Elegant system back in the day (TRW, 1965), as there is only one type of 
data: untyped, variable length string. The flexibility inherent in that 
approach led to what looks to me like an OO db.

Well, don't keep us in suspense, man!!  Tell us!  What is the Secret

Their other Major Point is the Multi-valued field.  AFAICT, it's a field
that can hold multiple values (DUH!).  I can see where that would be
quite handy, but as their sole claim to fame... :-?

>From what I can tell, they've "renamed" the PICK database(s) as a
"multivalued database".  There are several web sites/organizations
called www.multivalue.(net|org|com). I've also seen them called "fourth
normal databases".

The coolest thing IMO they seem to do is to hash all of the data which
allows for very quick retrieval.  I've yet to find the technical details
on how that works.

I do all my PHP work with BBEdit. I like it because it comes with a ton of tools
(markup tools, PCRE search, etc...), it has a spartan interface, and is highly
scriptable directly via Applescript or via  text filters with Perl, PHP
(php-cli), Python or any scripting languages that lives on the OS X shell. Also,
the support team rocks, and they are open to suggestions to improve the app.

For an example of scriptability see here (I'm the author of these):

BBEdit Disk Browser Suite
<http://www.scriptdigital.com/divers/bbeditdiskbrowserscripts.html>

BBEditLib: AppleScript Library
<http://www.scriptdigital.com/divers/bbeditlib.html>

The Zend IDE could be interesting for me, but only for debugging purpose. Other
than that, I don't see why in the world I would change my text editor.

Cheers

The people I consulted for were using regular TCP/IP socket programs for
communication, and they made up their own protocol, originally with
fixed-length strings as data and later with XML. It worked very well, but
they were using PHP "back in the day," so their original implementation
was a hack, and it's hard to apply evolutionary changes to a hack and have
it turn into a truly elegant solution.

They were in the middle of switching to jBase when I moved to NYC, and
supposedly they were going to be able to access data within Pick natively
from PHP.

Well, I try to be helpful, but this isn't my area of expertise at all. I
can explain how I was communicating with Pick, but I have friends who
should now be doing something much better with jBase. I didn't want you to
feel like that one guy was holding onto some sort of secret is all.

There's definitely more to them than that. As an example, most companies
that made heavy use of Pick wrote all of their business logic in Pick.
It's more than a database - it's like an operating system, programming
language, and database, all in one.

Pick is a brand that has sort of been diluted, just like Unix.
Multi-valued database is the generic term.

This reminds me of Frontier/Usertalk it's a scripting language baked
into an outliner baked into a object database with a web server front end.

Looks like the 4-5-6 to 23rd Street? confirm or correct, please!

Also, how warm/cold does the meeting space get? ie, Shirtsleeves or sweater?

How long does Monsieur Convissor plan to speak?

Any topics or tangents other than PEAR going on?

Looking forward to meeting, Chris.

Yeah, that works very well, but keep in mind only the 6 stops at 23rd
(the 4-5 is express from 14th to 42ns).  The N-R is in the area too
(23rd and 5th).

I've always found it be fairly warm in there.

We generally try to wrap things up by 8:30 - 8:45

> Any topics or tangents other than PEAR going on?

We're going to touch on briefly, at the beginning of the meeting,
NYPHP's effort to organize itself.  The NYPHP-Dev list
(http://nyphp.org/lists) has had a lot of this talk, but briefly we're
writing a charter, forming departments, organizing current projects, and
writing a mission statement.

Hi Folks:

I've got SQLite working fine in PHP from command line scripts.  When using
it via my webserver (Apache as CGI, Windows 2000) I get the following
error:

"Warning: sqlite_open(): unable to open a temporary database file for
storing temporary tables in"

The permissions on my system's temporary directory and the directory where
the SQLite file is to be stored are fine.  The requested SQLite file even 
gets created with 0 bytes.

Confounded,

First, I get a call time pass by reference is depricated warning.

Taking out the & then takes me back to the original error message I 
posted.

Something else is going on here.  I took a look at my security logs and
found attempts to create files such as "C:\WINNT\sqlite_5VwP2hmAcOMrUr1."  
Well, I run Apache as a restricted user, so of course it can't write to
that directory!  Now, WHY is it trying to write to that directory?  How is
one supposed to set the temp dir for SQLite in PHP?  It's ignoring the
system environment variables, that's for sure.

Thanks,

probably due to the fact that you're running php5 and I'm 
running sqlite built against php4

I have a file in my C:\winnt\temp called sqlite_llkjadjfk

Wasn't set.  Tinkered with it to see what happens.  Had to add a bunch of
paths to make it not produce open_basedir errors for normal operations.

Now I'm back to the inital error message about the sqlite_open() temporary
files.

I *know* this has to have been covered before, but when you have ostensibly
no data in MySQL (that damn single row full of nulls) what's the proven
method forresolveing the count as zero?
Obviously, as I'm sure most of you know, you get a result of 1 even if there
is no "real" data in a MySQL table.

The nerve!!

I assume you mean that mysql_num_rows() will return 1 when there is 1 row,
regardless of the data. This is good. Worse would be for the function to
be incorrect.

If you want to check whether a certain field is null, do it in your SQL
statement:

select foo from bar where blah is not null

Hope that helps.

Actually that was my first approach - somehow my result was still 1.

Current workaround code is:

	if(mysql_num_rows($result) >= 2)
	{
		// do something
	}
	else
	{
		$row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
		if(is_null($row['id']))
		{
			// do something else
		}
	}

probably kludge-tastic but it hasn't bombed in the hour since I put it in...

My answer to this is, well, yes and no ;^)

I've done it with Zope/Plone, but never from PHP.  The one thing that I 
remember is that there are two ports that an AD server listen to for 
LDAP, the 'official' one and the other for something like 'data 
services' or somesuch.  It is this second port that your PHP apps will 
have to bind to, as the 'official' port mangles all transmissions to an 
almost unusable state.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] MAC development environment
Message-ID: <BAY14-F48kJla9Gmv440000b5a8@hotmail.com>

Hi all,

I am a web designer/developer working on PC mainly but lately I have gotten 
a lot of client requests for MAC platform testing and compatibility issues. 
Therefore - I am getting a powerbook even though I have very vague idea 
about how development environment on the MAC is... the last time I worked on 
a Mac was probably 5 years ago! Can anyone give me some advise on how to set 
up a development environment on the Mac and what I should get in terms of 
hardware/software to do that? I intend to get a powerbook G4 and network 
with my PC laptop which I do development of PHP/CF/ASP sites currently.

Thanks in advance!

If your Intel laptop remains your dev environment why do you need a dev
environment on MAC. Just install IE for mac, Safari and test to see how
your web pages look on them.

May I also recommend Camino, http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/.
Real nice looking browser, native Cocoa interface.  I use mostly
Linux, but I have a Mac on my desk at work which I fire up when I want
to see really pretty things on my desktop, and Camino's one of them.

Anyway, if you need to develop in the Mac, you should have no problems 
with PHP or CF. After all, MacOS X is unix, actually BSD and it comes 
pre-installed with Apache, PHP and mySQL. ColdFusion is a commercial 
software, so you have to pay for it, but it does have a Mac version. If 
you need to serve ASP, you can use iASP (http://www.halcyonsoft.com/).

IMHO, the Mac is now the best platform for web development, bar none. 
It runs the standard Unix software, has versions of everything that 
Wintel has, the colors actually match what you print and it's really 
beautiful to boot!

Then again, I write for a Macintosh magazine in Brazil, so I might be a 
tiny bit biased ;-)

Cheers,
Mauricio

Well any Unix based environment is pretty much better then windows in my
opinion. I personally use Linux because its free and pretty much
anything is supported on the desktop and the server.  With Crossover
you can even have IE.

I second this -- OSX is Unix with a pretty interface. It ships with PHP 
installed, and it's supposed to be pretty easy to create native apps 
that call PHP scripts behind the scenes.

Setting up a dev environment is going to be different for everyone, but 
here's a few tips off the top of my head.

Install the X11 server from the OSX dvd if it isn't already installed.
Install Apple's Developer Tools
You can turn on Apache at the Sharing control panel
Visit O'Reilly to find out how to turn on the root account + a bunch of 
other Unix tips
Visit fink.sourceforge.net --  fink is an OSX version of Debian's 
package management system

Feel free to ask questions here, particularly as they relate to

I know I must sound like total Mr Obvious to most people on this list
but consider that not everyone knows of the alternatives at this time
especially students in colleges who are handed a laptop with XP
preinstalled. But if someone is taking a CS degree and still have not
heard that yes Linux/BSD is better then they must be living under a
rock.

There must be a helluva lot of rocks out there then.  

The people I know into Linux/BSD went out of their way to find it.  Most
college students/comp-sci people/humans don't go out of their way for
things they're not truly interested in.  Hell, most people don't go out of
their way, period.

Inertia is very powerful; that's what keeps [MAJOR CORPORATION] where they are.

I noticed someone asking about Active Directory authentication using
straight up php - so I

figured that I would send this along.

This is a snippet of a login script for a calendar scheduling ap that I
wrote in PHP for a

local intranet. You would make a login form, with post variables of
username and password,

and it will authenticate them to the AD server.

How this works: it connects to the LDAP server with a valid login - which
I created the

username ldap in active directory, to query the database, since it would
not allow anonymous

access. You would look up the correct username for that account by
querying the

smaaccountname field for the username that they entered. If that exists,
then get the

correct username to bind to the server with, disconnect, and retry to
connect with the users

proper username and their password. If it connects, you know that it is a
valid username.

I have used this script in their helpdesk application so that passwords
were being checked

vs active directory instead of the internal help desk application's
passwords.

This is just one way of doing it - if anyone else has comments or
questions, please feel

free to let me now!

Still having trouble understanding how to avoid the Lost Update Problem,
which was discussed here a couple months ago
(http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2003-December/006718.html etc).

An HTML form is populated with data from a db, including a field holding
my last_modified timestamp so I can compare it with the db before I write
the update.

How is using a transaction supposed to prevent another client from
sneaking in an update after I compare, but before I write?

I've read that you should either lock tables or use transactions. My
experiment (below) seems to suggest transactions alone is not enough and I
have to lock tables as well, or instead. But that doesn't sound right -- I
must be confused.

I've tried setting the isolation level to "read uncommitted" and it makes
no difference.

Here's the table.

CREATE TABLE test01 (
  id smallint(6) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  string varchar(75) default NULL,
  lastmod timestamp(14) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (id)
) TYPE=InnoDB;


INSERT INTO test01 VALUES (1,'bla bla bla', NOW());
--

Here's the experiment. When I load a copy into each of two windows and
submit both so they overlap in time, I expect the first to succeed and the
second to abort. Is there something stupid I'm doing wrong here? (btw I am
making sure to submit something in the 'string' field that's different
from what's in the db to ensure that my timestamp updates)

<?php

require('DB.php');
$db=DB::connect('mysql://joe_user at localhost/test');
$db->setFetchMode(DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC);

if($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']=='POST') {

        $db->query("set transaction isolation level READ UNCOMMITTED");
        $db->query("start transaction");
        // compare our timestamp with db
        $theirs = $db->getOne("select lastmod from test01 where id=1");
        echo "sleeping..."; flush();
        sleep(4);
        if ($theirs != $_POST['lastmod']) {
                echo "record has been modified by someone else.
reloading...";
                $db->query("rollback");
        } else {
                $db->query('update test01 set string ='  .
$db->quote($_POST['string']) . ' where id=1');
                $db->query("commit");
                echo "ok, $theirs = {$_POST['lastmod']}, updating... ";
        }
}
$formData = $db->getRow("select * from test01 where id = 1");
?>

<form action="<?=$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']?>" method="POST">
        Id <input type="text" size="2" name="id"
value="<?=$formData['id']?>" /><br />
        Last Mod <input type="text" size="24" name="lastmod"
value="<?=$formData['lastmod']?>" /><br />
        String <input type="text" size="30" name="string"
value="<?=htmlspecialchars($formData['string'])?>" /><br />
        <input type="submit" />
</form>

FWIW I've tried this with both 4.0.13-standard and 4.0.16-max-nt-log, both
with PEAR DB 1.6.0RC6


Many many thanks,

Transactions are guaranteed to be atomic. So, the database makes sure
there is no such thing as "sneaking in an update after I compare, but
before I write."

Hope that helps.

*Repost from DEV List*

Have any of you attempted to authenticate a user against AD using LDAP? I am
developing an application for a school district that will allow teachers and
students to use their existing usernames and passwords. However, we have a
user table in MySQL to authenticate parents.

Basically what I want to happen is when a user supplies a un/pw combination,
it will first attempt to authenticate against AD and then failover to MySQL.
It may actually be easier to have them choose what type of user they are,
but I wouldn't get to experience the joy of my original idea!

I am using a class that was developed for LDAP. I have worked on porting
most of the code to work with the nuances of AD. Before I get much further,
I would like to know if anyone has found a VERY clean and efficient way of
doing it.

Here is the setup that I am "working" with:

MS Windows Server 2003
IIS 6 w/ PHP 4.3.4
Active Directory
MySQL 4.0.16

I have complete access to the box(es) to install any modules, etc. that may
(or may not) be needed.

Thanks -- that's exactly why I don't understand why the test I've created
appears to show otherwise. I'm trying to figure out what I'm missing.

This link will not immediately answer the 
question you're asking.

It is from an outline for a course in 
operating system structures :
http://www.bridgeport.edu/sed/projects/cs503/Spring_2001/kode/os/sync.htm

I would suggest you compare 'locks' with 'semaphores' there.

Many operating system mechanisms are quite re-usable in applications.

I would like to know where you read:
"I've read that you should either lock tables or use transactions"

I think there are times when you want to lock down a table in part 
of a transaction -- i.e. do both.

When you start locking stuff down in transactions, it is beneficial to 
have some mechanism in place to avoid 'race' conditions.
(see the above link for ideas on that)

Hope this helps.

Thanks for tip Tim. I've just read it and plan to re-read it.

> "I've read that you should either lock tables or use transactions"

Maybe I oversimplified, and I don't mean to put words in anyone's mouth.
But there was this: "Obviously, you need to read the last_update value and
have your UPDATE occur with no other updates sneaking in between them. If
you're using InnoDB tables, use a transaction, otherwise, lock the table
for writing before you read the last_update value and then unlock it after
you either write the new data or decide that you can't write because it's
changed." in
<http://lists.nyphp.org/pipermail/talk/2003-December/006718.html>, and
there's a discussion in MySQL by Paul Dubois (2nd Ed; Sam's; pp 238 et
seq) that seems to imply that one either locks tables or uses
transactions. And I have some other books lying around... I'll spare you
the rest of the bibliography.

Most respectfully, I agree (-: I believe my scenario is a case in point.

Should not you be doing update of lastmod at the same time you update
string ? I think you may have a logical error that is why your script
does not work.

Thank you, that helps a lot! I have been working along the same lines with
the class that I found. However, it wasn't made specifically for AD. I'm
still open and looking for some more suggestions.

As soon as I test my method a little more, I will post it for critique.

AgainstMicroshaft's Active Directory

I posted this earlier today - you might want to take a look at it and see
if it can help you...

-------


I noticed someone asking about Active Directory authentication using
straight up php - so I figured that I would send this along.

This is a snippet of a login script for a calendar scheduling ap that I
wrote in PHP for a local intranet. You would make a login form, with post
variables of username and password, and it will authenticate them to the
AD server.

How this works: it connects to the LDAP server with a valid login - which
I created the username ldap in active directory, to query the database,
since it would not allow anonymous access. You would look up the correct
username for that account by querying the smaaccountname field for the
username that they entered. If that exists, then get the correct username
to bind to the server with, disconnect, and retry to connect with the
users proper username and their password. If it connects, you know that it
is a valid username.

I have used this script in their helpdesk application so that passwords
were being checked vs active directory instead of the internal help desk
application's passwords.

This is just one way of doing it - if anyone else has comments or
questions, please feel free to let me now!

// connect to LDAP server
$ldap = ldap_connect("172.17.1.11") or die("Cannot connect to the ldap
server :/");
$oudc = "cn=Users, dc=thompsonhealth, dc=org";
$searchdc = "dc=thompsonhealth, dc=org";
$dn2 = "cn=ldap, ".$oudc;
$password = "password";
$auth = false;
//look up OU
if (!($res = ldap_bind($ldap,$dn2,$password)))
{
  print(ldap_error($ldap) . "<br>");
  die("Could not bind to $dn");
}
else
{
  // set search critia for OU
  $filter = "samaccountname=".$_POST['username'];
  // search OU
  $sr = ldap_search($ldap,$searchdc,$filter);
  if (!$sr)
  {
    die("search failed\n");
  }
  else
  {
    // get fields from search
    $info = ldap_get_entries($ldap,$sr);
    if ($info["count"] == 0)
    {
      $auth = false;
    }
    else
    {
      $auth = true;
      $user_cn = $info[0]["cn"][0];
    }
    // disconnect from LDAP server
    ldap_unbind($ldap);
  }
}
if ($auth == false)
{
  die("Could not authenticate you to the Active Directory Server.");
}

$ldap = ldap_connect("172.17.1.11") or die("Cannot connect to AD server
:/");
$oudc = "cn=users, dc=thompsonhealth, dc=org";
$dn2 = "cn=".$user_cn.", ".$oudc;
$password = $_POST['password'];

Anyone have a recommendation on PHP based shopping carts?

I hear osCommerce is great "out of the box" but I'm sure my client isn't
going to want to use that layout. Supposedly it's a bear to modify.

I'm currently looking at FreeTrade
(http://share.whichever.com/index.php?SCREEN=freetrade).

A commercial solution will be okay, but only if I get source, can
modify it and support is as good as FOSS support.

You call it shopping cart but remember that the cart is only the
storefront you have a load of administrative interface to deal with.  I
think its better to call these e-commerce apps.

Have you taken a loot at interchange ? (even though not php looks very
good)

Heh. I wish. It's a TIMESTAMP, which "provides a type that you can use to
automatically mark INSERT or UPDATE operations with the current date and
time" when you're not running in Max-DB mode.
(http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/DATETIME.html). You could explicitly set it
to now() but you don't have to.

I've played with a couple.  I've implemented two vanilla osCommerce 
sites.  I've implemented one highly customized osCommerce (about 1/4 of 
the app rewritten).  osCommerce is a nightmare to customize/modify.  The 
community contributions are mostly dubious.  Sometimes the contributions 
require other contributions to work, I've never seen those dependencies 
documented.

At this point I've written two different ecommerce packages (mostly from 
scratch, the second based on the first).  It's faster to write from 
scratch than it is to do the kind of tweaks to osCommerce that customer 
usually request.

As a developer, if you can, stay away from osCommerce.
As an end user, osCommerce will probably meet your needs (60 - 80%).

I think OScommerce is great!  Implementing my first site now for a 
large scale art based site. Hitting the road with 1/2 million $ worth 
of inventory that we have to move.

I think to date it's one of the best written PHP applications out there.

Subject: [nycphp-talk] Working with recursive "single-referenced" methods and
	static variables
Message-ID: <403BC940.9090101@adnet-sys.com>

[CODE]
class DepartmentTree {

 function &buildTree($id) {
   static $html;
   if (!isset($html)) {
    // DO STUFF HERE TO $html
   }
   // DO MORE STUFF
   if ($condition_is_met) $this->buildTree($newID);
   $this->html = $html;
  }

}
[/CODE]

The above (and greatly paraphrased from the 100-line actual class) class 
and method, in its real form, totally works inasmuch as it successfully 
always creates an HTML hierarchial tree of departments mapped with child 
departments.  I have no problem with this.. as long as I only use the 
class once.

However, there is a case where I need the entire contents of the 
departments table dumped out into a resultset, and to do that I figured 
I would just loop through a query of records that have no parent ID; 
each id in each row I seed into $tree->buildTree():

[CODE]
for ($i = 0; $i < @sizeof($result); $i++) {
 $tree->buildTree($result[$i]->id);
 $this->deptArray += $tree->convert_to_array();
 $tree->clearTreeHTML();
 }
[/CODE]

The "convert_to_array()" method will convert the contents of $this->html 
from HTML content to an array, keeping the original hierarchial order; 
the "clearTreeHTML()" method will set $this->html to NULL or "".

Problem is, it does not do that, because apparently "static $html" keeps 
an instance of it running in the single-referenced instance of 
"buildTree" method.  

Based on how best I can explain my problem, and sorry I can't explain it 
any better w/o dumping the actual code line by line, how have you all 
figured out the best way to generate multiple, unique instances from a 
single-referenced method that uses a static local variable?

Thanx

you're kidding right...? IMO the code is overblown, messy and obtuse ... I
have spent many an hour trying to work out wtf they're doing sometimes with
all those tep_* functions and half baked classes ...

as an aside has anyone looked at http://www.zen-cart.com ? based on osc
apparently but better....

I had a similar problem once and never figured it out. I thought it was 
a deficiency in the object oriented aspects of PHP. Something that 
would be addressed in PHP 5.

Rich,
I'm betting that he hasn't tried to customize osc.

There's at least half a dozen osCommerce knock-offs.  As a general rule 
they don't address the problems with osCommerce.  For a while I was 
tempted to continue my rewrite of osCommerce (then TEP) and create a 
post-osc project.  But that would have been stupid.  Much better to 
start from scratch, and not deal with some of the weird logic sequences 
within osc.

If you are always going to use $tree as an object, and not call 
DepartmentTree::buildTree (), then just remove the 'static $html;' and 
'$this->html = $html;' lines and replace all instances of '$html' with 
'$this->html'.

This is the normal method for object oriented design, the only reason to 
use static variables is if you are trying to do something tricky like 
the singleton class.

Your code would then be:

class DepartmentTree {

   var $html;

   function &buildTree($id) {
     if (!isset($this->html)) {
      // DO STUFF HERE TO $this->html
     }
     // DO MORE STUFF
     if ($condition_is_met) {
       $this->buildTree($newID);
     }
   }

   function clearTreeHTML () {
     $this->html = NULL;
   }

   function convert_to_array () {
     // PUT YOUR ARRAY CONVERSION HERE
     return (array) $this->html;
   }
}

Which will perform as expected.

Thanx Dan, but that did not fix my problem.  I can only do ONE instance 
of buildTree() method regardless of it being "non-singleton" or "static" 
or anything.  If I call it once with a specific ID then all is fine; if 
I call with all IDs, then it only gets the first ID it finds and stops 
dead right there, even with a list of IDS.

Dan it worked, but as a result of a "kluged" hybrid between your 
solution and my original setup.  I removed "static $html" and set 
everything to $this->html instead, however, the method "buildTree" has 
to be "static" and I still have to use "static $dbAP, $kounter" for 
single-instance DB connection objects and counting integers.  It now 
works for a single DepartmentTree call:

$tree =& new DepartmentTree();
$tree->buildTree($result[0]->id);
$html = $tree->displayTree();
// OR TO GET ARRAY
$deptArray = $tree->convert_to_array();
$tree = null;

And works for multiple calls:

$sql = 'SELECT id FROM department WHERE department_parent_id IS NULL';
$query =& new MySQLQuery($sql, $dbAP->getDBConn());
$result = $query->getResult();
for ($i =0; $i < @sizeof($result); $i++) {
 $tree =& new DepartmentTree();
 $tree->buildTree($result[$i]->id);
 $this->deptArray += $tree->convert_to_array();
 $tree = null;
}
...

I've had many a moment when I wanted to rewrite OSC.  Give it a template
engine, divide the code more, clean things up, etc, etc.  There is some
great functionality in OSC and from what I recall, there was a really
helpful OSC community.  The main developers are updating constantly.  I've
made a few OSC sites, but it's far too much of a headache when keeping a few
clients.  These days I also sway towards rolling my own, unless a client
actaully needs a good deal of the things OSC offers.  

The intermingling of display and functionality is just far too thick to dig
through.  They've improved their classes, but overall they still work more
as function groupings than actual objects.  I can't emphasise enough how
much wasted time OSC maintainence can waste.

Hey folks,

Looking for a recommendation for an email class to handle polling a POP3

but I don't believe it handles attachments (I could be wrong, just getting
into this now), which is a definite requirement.  I found another class
there called 'clsImap.php', which I quickly installed and tried the test
script with no luck (it handles POP3 in addition to IMAP, despite the name).
This one looks promising however, so I will research it further.

However, what I am after is a recommendation from someone who has actually
done this (with attachments) and can recommend a reliable class (or code
sample) that I should go with.

Thanks,

Tom

Hi Folks:

Last night, someone asked what the method name was for the DB method that 
gets the list of tables, users, etc.  I just remembered what it is:
getListOf().

Hi there,

I'd like to know why in the world, starting with PHP 4.3.3, PHP need to throw an
error (E_NOTICE) when it encounter a second session_start (). 

I know that I can disable the display or errors.

I know that I could test first if $_SESSION exists before calling session_start
().

But really, I don't understand the logic behind this change. If the second
session_start is to be ignored, why then throw an error? Could session_start
work in the same logic as include_once ()?

I have some framework that need to be plug sometimes on other frameworks that
can contain a session_start OR not.

Sorry to vent like this, but I find this change undesired and need to understand
why sometimes PHP break compatibility like this between minor versions.

Am I missing something here?

TIA

Cheers
-Emmanuel

Google is your friend, just add 'site:lists.nyphp.org' to the search 
string and it will search the archives for you.

For example:

<http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=search+archives+site%3Alists.nyphp.org&btnG=Google+Search>

The only problem is that they won't be very up to date...though the more 
people using it the faster it will update.

This seems like the right thing for PHP to do, in my opinion.

I hate to sound unsympathetic, but a warning seems appropriate. PHP will
still do what you're wanting, but there's no reason to have multiple
session_start() calls, so it's just letting you know.

It seems like you have your error reporting set very strict, but you want
your code to be sloppy. You have to pick one or the other. If you don't
care whether your code is sloppy, set your error reporting differently.

produces NOT ONE ERROR/WARNING/ANYTHING, the page STILL locks up cold!! 
You can't click onto a link or press a form button and go ANYWHERE AT ALL...

However, if I do this:

[PHP]
class MyClass {

 var $isSQLFieldArray = array();

 function MyClass() {}

 function getIsSQLFieldArray($field) {
  if ($field && isset($this->isSQLFieldArray[$field])) return 
$this->isSQLFieldArray[$field];
 }

}
[/PHP]

Everything works just fine and STILL no errors reported by 
[PHP]error_reporting(E_ALL);[/PHP]

What do you all make of this one?  The following URLs provided me no 
information:

I just installed zen-cart to give it a try.
Here is my observations:
1. It seems to be a fork of osCommerce
2. It is still beta so I came across and unstable install scrip, one may
need to install manually.
3. Its administration seems to be well organized and though out.

I have not idea how its codebase differs or if its easier to maintain.

Thanks for the answer Chris. But I disagree with you. I could be wrong though
and willing to learn why.

Here's my scenario. I work for a learning institution that produce on-line
courses. They asked me to plug on the already existing courses an access control
framework. The control access framework is easy to plug on top of these courses,
it?s just two includes in the pages to be protected.

Some of these courses are starting a session and some not. Since the access
framework need to start a session and is called first, PHP will throw an error
when it will encounter a session_start in the courses that need a session.

Because these courses where produced by different programmers working for
different shops, I need to ask them to modify their code and check first if a
session already exists before calling session_start. This is not fun.

I can understand the point that for now on, I should  always in my code check
first if a session exists. But what about existing code base like in my
scenario?

Maybe my line of reasoning is wrong but I never heard that there was a penalty
when PHP encountered a second session_start (). What I know is that PHP will
disregard the second session_start, doing something similar I guess to
include_once when it encounter a file that was already included.

If there is no penalty calling multiple times session_start, why PHP should
throw an error when this behavior might break compatibilities with existing
code?

Cheers

This is absolutely correct, errors of level E_NOTICE are:

Run-time notices. Indicate that the script encountered something that 
could indicate an error, but could also happen in the normal course of 
running a script.

From: <http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.errorfunc.php#e-notice>

Trying to open a second session when one already exists falls squarely 
into this category.

Exactly, now if it was throwing an E_WARNING or E_ERROR there might be a 
case for arguing against it, but a notice is just there to let you know 
that you have some code which may be sloppy.

I am surprised myself, I have never heard of anyone running a production 
server with error_reporting set to E_ALL, and definitely not without 
some form of custom error handling routine.

Working around existing code can be tough, but it is also not a problem 
you are alone in facing.  There are many ways to avoid the problem, some 
of which are:

- Modify your error reporting level to something like:
   error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE);

- Write a custom error handler.

Just to be clear, the error is there as a notice to let you know you 
might be doing something silly, which is absolutely correct because in 
the vast majority of cases having multiple session_start calls is an 
indication of bad programming.

On a side note, if you are already editing these files to add include() 
calls for your password protection scheme, why not remove the 
session_start calls at the same time?

I hope this has helped to clear up the situation,

Sorry but that tells me little-to-nothing.  You haven't told me about 
ease of use, code manipulation to make it work for documenting, all I 
see is the results of using Doxygen.  I'd like to know how easy it was 
for YOU to use it, implement it, examples of *HOW* you used it in a case 
of like a flat script here or a class method there, anything.

I am struggling with PHPDocumentor because it seems, at best, impossible 
to use.

You asked for thoughts etc.

My thought is basically that 
doxygen can do a better job of 
generating documentation.

If you want to know how to use it 
I would suggest the following:
www.doxygen.com

In terms of what's easier to use
PHPDocumentor or Doxygen 
I think it is matter of personal 
preference as to which one is easier 
to use.

If you feel "PHPDocumentor seems, at best, 
impossible to use...". maybe Doxygen 
will seem easier to you.

Which is definitely not the case in my scenario. It?s not my code that is sloppy
since the access framework is called first and will start the session, it?s the
existing code base made by different programmers in different shops that is
sloppy because their application didn't implemented some defensive coding
against the case that they should check that a session already existed before
calling session_start ().

Why are you assuming that this on a production server? And why are you assuming
that there is no custom error handling routine?

>Just to be clear, the error is there as a notice to let you know you

I think you are wrong here. What I'm talking about is modularity and autonomy.

Some courses have a high level of abstraction and can be plugged in other
frameworks. That's why they need some level of autonomy and can assume that in
some scenario they will be called without a prior session existing. What I
understand now is to tell these programmers to always check if a session already
exists before calling session_start (). These programmers works on legacy code
that was done 1 to 2 years ago.

Now, I must confess that I'm totally taken off-guard by this and didn't know
that there was such a strong consensus on the question that multiple calls to
session_start () were a bad thing. I'll go reread the PHP books I have and check
the web.

But I still don't have an answer to my questions. What's the penalty for a
second call to session_start ()?

Is PHP running faster with defensive coding checking if a session already exists
and no call to session_start () is made?

Is a second call to  session_start () waste resources and make PHP slower?

Cheers

slightly OT but I know I can get the answer here!

I'm stumped on getting a MySQL table moved from one server to another. I was
under the (possibly false) impression that it's pretty much a straight copy.
Am I incorrect? I copied over the data folder and all the files contained
therein, bounced mysql on the new machine (both are W2K).

I'm missing something, and I can't sort out exactly what. Didn't want to try
to go through the hassle of dump and rebuild, either.

Hmmm...  63 tables sounds like a lot for your situation.  Sounds like you 
may have created multiple tables with the same kind of information rather 
than having one table with a column identifying the kind of information 
(and a second table defining the identification).

There are classes out there that'll dump database query results into XML.  
I know my SQL Solution does that.  There have got to be others, probably 
even in PEAR.

BUT, what's the point?  Databases are for handling data.  I see XML's role 
as being a means of transferring data between parties.

Were both servers off when you did the move?  Are they both the same 
version of MySQL?

Regardless, it seems safer to me to use mysqldump rather than doing file 
copies.

I don't see how you can justify multiple attempts to start a session with
modularity. If your application is truly modular, your session module
should take care of session stuff, and it should be trivial to make sure
this module only gets called once.

It sounds to me like the exact opposite is happening, as if session stuff
is buried within other, unrelated code. In this case, in fact, it sounds
like session stuff is buried in two different files with unrelated code,
both of which must be called. Of course, I admit to not really
understanding why this is an issue, so perhaps I'm making some erroneous
assumptions.

> But I still don't have an answer to my questions. What's the penalty
> for a second call to session_start ()?

You haven't received an answer, because:

1. You already know the answer, I think. There is no real penalty, because
PHP's session mechanism checks whether a session already exists. In fact,
this is when it lets you know of a potential problem. You're telling it to
start a session, it runs off to do so, and then it comes back saying,
"Uhhh, it looks like you already started one a while back. Did you mean to
do that?"
2. Your question is irrelevant.

It sounds as if you are arguing that a notice should not be given when "no
harm is done." If this were true, there would be no reason for different
level types. In fact, if this is your opinion, you should turn your
error_reporting level way down. Why should the PHP engine not grant
developers fine-grained control over their error reporting just because
some people:

1. Don't want to receive notices.
2. Don't want to bother turning their error reporting down to reflect
their preference.

I think your options are:

1. Turn error reporting way down, and worry no more about it.
2. Modularize your code better, so that your session mechanism is in its
own module, and you can include it only when you need to.
3. Check whether a session exists before telling PHP to start a session.

Hope that helps.

Chris

These are W2K installations all around - I mentioned the issue to my boss
and I got the "I don't care, dump and rebuild" response. So I will be doing
that! :)

Very VERY hard to use, even moreso than PHPDocumentor.. I can't figure 
out the tutorial online to understand how to find the configuration 
file, use the Doxywizard, basically, do anything with this tool 
whatsoever.  Could you perhaps tell me an example, a real-life "This is 
how I did it" story for a very simple PHP script using Doxygen?

I do that for some test servers both as backup and to keep them in sync.
Midnight crons tar (for backup) and move the data folder between servers
with no problem. The only catch I can remember: mysql has to be stopped
before copying the files. Attempting to copy data directory with mysql
running gives corrupt files.

This is done both linux -> linux and linux -> w2000, all servers running
the same mysql version.

I'm stumped on getting a MySQL table moved from one server to another. I

Am I incorrect? I copied over the data folder and all the files contained

I use phpDocumentor in all of my OOP projects and I document the code with phpDocumentor in much the same way as I use JavaDoc. I found the concept familiar, the syntax simple and the need clear so your statement that 'PHPDocumentor because it seems, at best, impossible to use' tells me little-to-nothing.

First, in order to use phpDocumentor, you need to read the 'phpDocumentor Guide to Creating Fantastic Documentation' at http://phpdoc.org/docs/HTMLSmartyConverter/default/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.pkg.html
In all honesty, if you read it an it didn't help you, read it again. Not suprisingly, the documentation for phpDocumentor is done very well. If you aren't familiar with structured code documentation (and many, many experienced programmers are not) you may have just skimmed the text because you trivialized the task. Good documentation is hard.

For another point of view on this type of code documentation, or 'literate programming' as people who need to call things something call this thing, read the 'The Design of Distributed Hyperlinked Programming Documentation' at 
ftp://ftp.java.sun.com/docs/javadoc-paper/iwhd.pdf  This will give you a perspective on what the developers of Javadoc, and thus by extension phpDocumentor, are trying to do.

I only document OPP code because I only write OOP code because that's the coding methodology that my projects are usually best served by. If you are a proceduraral programmer, I imagine phpDocumentor will still help by I can't speak from experience. Remember, since this is heavily inspired by JavaDoc, it natually lends itself to OOP.

Alway fully document each object with author, version, date tags, etc. (An example of etc might be copyright) For each class, provide scope and variable type tags as well as short and long description. A short description is one sentence followed by a period and a line break. Document methods like classes except provide parameter information. For each variable, provide scope and variable type tags.

If you just go this far, you will be able to produce suprisingly helpful documentation. Unless you are working for a company that already has existing documentation standards in place, you should be fine. Better than fine, actually.

The last step is to actually produce the phpDocumentor document. The command-line tool is very powerful. Use the web tool anyway. The docbuilder interface can be accessed via index.html in the install directory of phpDocumentor, or the docbuilder subdirectory. Its slick, easy and will do the job right the first time. You can save the command-line for those cold winter nights.

Once you have your code documented to this point, you have reached a milestone. Now you can explore more of the functionality of phpDocumentor. I recommend learning how to use templates for no ther reason than the typical reason one uses templates: less work = more gooder. Not that it isn't great fun copying the same scope and variable documentation on type of fifteen class-level variables, but templates are a good thing to learn. The same goes for packages. I'm still not sure why, but the @package tag usage does seem to cause some confusion. The same is true of the @see tag. But once you get these tags, you'll love them

Its a good idea now to look at ALL of the tags offerend by phpDocumentor. I'm a big fan of the @todo tag. Include the @version $Revision$ tag and udate it with CVS version.

Finally, experiment with outputting you phpDocumentor into different formats. I'm now a big fan of outputting my documentation into a PEAR template, but that's because I'm a big PEAR fan. If you prefer DocBook, that also makes perfect sense. If you like more than one, now it may be time to learn the command-line interface and write a script. There are many, many tags in phpDocumentor and you will probably like some of them and want to include them.

Tim,
Thanks for info on Doxygen, I like what it does to show the inner working
of clew in an easier way than I believe that phpDocumentor would.

Phil,
We used phpDocumentor last year on a large scale project that needed to
have its source transitioned from active development by a single hacker to
a globally dispersed team of several developers.   The effort to document
the code kind of petered out, but it did force us to write better
documented code.

I chose phpDocumentor over other tools because it had better features at
the time, but I later found it was recommended for PEAR development
(http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.comments.php and
http://pear.php.net/package/PhpDocumentor) which solidified our choice.

It's a good tool, and it's "endorsement" by its use by and availability at
PEAR makes it worth learning and using.  If you have any experience with
javadoc or browsing Java APIs, you'll find yourself at home.   Conversely,
it will enforce your ability to understand OOP and work with javadoc if the
need ever arises.

Implementing it requires you to extract it somewhere accessible by your web
browser, enter in a few options, and submit a form.   As for the code you
want to document, it needs to have comments added in a specific format to
be parsed correctly.   To end up with acceptable documentation, you'll be
adding the comments to your code, running the documentor, viewing the
results, and adding more comments to your code as necessary.   You'll go
through a few cycles of this before you get it right.

Please take some time to read the tutorial
http://phpdoc.org/docs/HTMLSmartyConverter/default/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.pkg.html

The solution I use for this is to have a cron job run bin/mysqldump nightly
or on demand to write the data and structure to an SQL file, transfer the
file, then run "source c:\data.sql" from the second machine's mysql command
line client.  It's not much of a hassle to do a dump and rebuild this way.

Admittedly, the SQL file I dump is only in the range of half a MB, but this
technique is good for grabbing the latest data on my Solaris 4.0.15 and
using it on my Windows 2000 workstation running 3.23 or Mac OS X machine
running 4.0.17.

Carlos' solution is much better for larger, server to server migrations.
Using mysqldump is better for getting a latest copy and bringing it to your
workstation quickly.

Thanx.. I'm at that page now and trying to figure it out is like trying

I am not sure what I am. The bastard child of OO and procedural code.  I 
create PHP scripts that are flat-procedure ("index.php") that require 
".inc.php" library scripts that contain a boatload of classes and 
subclasses.  My programming style which I don't think there is a 
category for.

I have a limited understanding of "javadoc" albeit new but way WAY 
easier than this!

each object, why?  I have one file containing 15 - 20 classes each, each 
class averaging about 5 methods per class, each method averaging 4 
globals and 10 - 15 local variables.  And about 5 files structured like 
that per project per client.  So why do each object, should I not just 
have one DocBlock with author, version and package and then each method 
I document vars, params and optional returns?

Just my luck my HTML interface throws PHP code all over the place along

thanx for the detailed tips.. this will take more than one day to be 
able to use just for one file, which I'm experimenting with.  I gave up 
on DOxygen, it's even harder for me to use than PHPDocumentor.

I ~can~ do this on the production box (FreeBSD 4.8/PHP 4.3.4/Apache

I'm grateful for any clues. Thanks.

All,

I'm trying this for the first time today. I downloaded and setup PHPDocumentor in under an hour. I commented a couple of classes, ran the web GUI and "Bing" there it was as beautiful as can be. 

I am very impressed and motivated to clean up and comment all my projects. I also tried the "DOxygen" and "PHPDocumentor" was by far better.

Cheers,
Peter

I am not sure what I am. The bastard child of OO and procedural code.  I 
create PHP scripts that are flat-procedure ("index.php") that require 
".inc.php" library scripts that contain a boatload of classes and 
subclasses.  My programming style which I don't think there is a 
category for.

I have a limited understanding of "javadoc" albeit new but way WAY 
easier than this!

each object, why?  I have one file containing 15 - 20 classes each, each 
class averaging about 5 methods per class, each method averaging 4 
globals and 10 - 15 local variables.  And about 5 files structured like 
that per project per client.  So why do each object, should I not just 
have one DocBlock with author, version and package and then each method 
I document vars, params and optional returns?

Just my luck my HTML interface throws PHP code all over the place along

thanx for the detailed tips.. this will take more than one day to be 
able to use just for one file, which I'm experimenting with.  I gave up 
on DOxygen, it's even harder for me to use than PHPDocumentor.

> >>>general response to all Phil Powell responses, top-posted for stand-alone convenience:
This is actually why I recommend taking phpDocumentor one step at a time: its very full featured! You can get pretty good results from just a very basic initial implementation. 

If something chokes, dump it until you get a clean output. Bad documentation is worse than no documentation. If you don't understand something, its probably because you don't need it right now. And later, as you get used to it, you'll start asking yourself 'why can't it ....'. Then you'll probably find out that it does. I had that [blank stare altogether] feeling many times with this tool (still do). But luckily, the advanced tags just aren't necessary right away, if ever.

Even if you had good result with Doxygen, which appears to be a fine tool, I would still recommend you stick it out with phpDocumentor, if for no other reason then its positioned to become something of a standard. If for no other reason than PEAR uses it.

One final thing. Most people find that their coding style changes once they start structured documentation. I make people in my team write out all the classes with all the documentation BEFORE they start coding. The end result is that we get good code complete faster.

Good luck!

A work around might be to use the realpath() function.

$path = realpath('./file.ini');
parse_ini_file($path);

cheers!

Patkins, save your fingers and your time.  Run while you still can.  As
you can see from the nature of Phil's questions and his leaving in over
200 lines of stuff just to say "help me," he needs more help than you, or
anyone on this list, can provide.

Odd question, possibly OT but the answer should determine that.

Anyone out there run into files like these?

-rwxr-xr-x  1 nobody  wheel  582254592 Jan 19 13:09 magicp8vAAg
-rwxr-xr-x  1 nobody  wheel  582254592 Jan 19 13:09 magicwcYIKc

Found these bad boys on /var/tmp/ on a FreeBSD box.  Not sure they are a
PHP (or an extensions) tmp file or what.  Google, PHP source, and log
files haven't shed any light on this as of yet.

Could this indicate an attack of some kind?  Any thoughts are welcome.

Don't have access to any BSD boxes at the moment, but here's my
thoughts.

Big files, and i think "nobody" is the default user for nfs shared
filesystems. Is the box an nfs server?

/var/tmp is usually used for various applications to store stuff, but
usually they clean up afterthemselves. Did the box have any problems
around the date/time? Maybe a core dump?

I wouldn't think it's an attack, more a miscreant application or system
burp. I must confess to not being the most knowledgeable on such things
though.

Two avenues to investigation. Run "strings" on the files and see what
comes up. Or look for other files of that same size on the machine.

ciao!

You can check for session existance manually
if(isset($_COOKIE[session_name()]) || isset($_GET[session_name()] ))
This does still miss one case where sid can be part of url
http://host/sessesion_name-session_id/...

What you got to realize is that these checks are the first thing done by
session_start() before it sets php internal session status to on or off.
There shoudl be no reason to write this session check code when it is
already done by php.

Also it does not make sence to use isset($_SESSION) before
session_start() is called.

What php really needs is an additional session_exists()  function.

Code like this:
 if(!session_exists()){ session_start(); } 
would not be useful because that is already what session_start() does.

Although this would be useful:
 if(!session_exists()){
   //do something without starting session
 }else{
  	session_start();
        //do normal session stuff
 }

YES.  It has ended up that way out of necessity more than design.  As I
understand it FreeBSD (can't speak to the other BSD's) are a poor choice
to serve NFS.

/var filled up, and I had thought due to those files.  No .core files on
the filesystem including NFS clients.

Knowing their origin (or at least a clue) makes me feel a little better.

This is a matter of preference, obviously, and perhaps I have an 
outdated notion of PHPDocumentor, but one of the things that I really 
like about Doxygen is that it links you right into the actual code.

It also strikes me as being more flexible -- you can use any or all of 
several different commenting styles, although this also seems to result 
in a configuration process that is relatively complex.

The impending introduction of PHP5 will change the auto-documentation 
landscape somewhat, as you'll be expressing a lot of important notions ( 
public vs private, parameter typing ) in the code rather in comments. It 
will be interesting to see which packages take the lead in this case.

If you'd like to have the data model reviewed I'd be happy to take a 
look for you.  That does sound like a lot of tables for not that much 
data.  I definitely agree with Dan about XML being used for the sharing 
of data, and a RDBMS for storage/retrieval.

You might search for other files on the box with the same size to see if 
that sheds any light on what they could be.

I'll second that, and again if you don't have any problems posting your 
database schema I'm sure you will find plenty of people more than happy 
to have a stab at helping you to streamline it.

PHP 5 also offers a complete set of reflection classes:

http://sitten-polizei.de/php/reflection_api/docs/language.reflection.html

This makes it much easier to write documentation programs because you
can ask PHP to describe the classes for you in far greater detail than
in PHP 4.

If you're interested in see these in action, check out the PHP 5
version of PHPUnit. I haven't spent too much time looking at its
source, but I know it uses reflection to simplify how to examine
classes so it can run unit tests.

I'll give that a shot. In the meantime I just got bored with the struggle
and decided to require('./config.php') instead and let config.php do the
configuring. TMTOWTDI!

You can also try running the "file" command on the files.  It does a pretty
good job of determining the type of file you feed it.

Tried that one, just got back "data".  This was paged last night so I
don't have the files any longer and strings took way too long to go
through that big file.

Seeing they looked to be owned by the web server setup I was concerned
it was malicious in nature.

Yesterday I was experimenting with PHP installed on 
a drive logically partitioned as 'L:'

I wanted to setup pear so I ran go-pear.bat.
At the end of the batch script I got:

PEAR_Config: bad data in L:\php\pear.ini

that seemed to be coming from config.php 
when calling something named version_compare.

I didn't worry about it to much at the time.
But today I want to run PHP 4.3.3 pear
and it was acting weird.

I decided to run go-pear.bat on the 
j: drive where the 4.3.3 pear stuff is.

Here is an excerpt:

 1. Installation prefix           : J:\php
 2. Binaries directory            : $prefix
 3. PHP code directory ($php_dir) : $prefix\pear
 4. Documentation base directory  : $php_dir\docs
 5. Data base directory           : $php_dir\data
 6. Tests base directory          : $php_dir\tests
 7. php.exe path                  : J:\php\php.exe

PEAR_Config: bad data in J:\php\pear.ini

came up again.

I ran PEAR_ENV.reg
which has the following:
REGEDIT4
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment]
"PHP_PEAR_SYSCONF_DIR"="J:\\php"
"PHP_PEAR_INSTALL_DIR"="J:\\php\\pear"
"PHP_PEAR_DOC_DIR"="J:\\php\\pear\\docs"
"PHP_PEAR_BIN_DIR"="J:\\php"
"PHP_PEAR_DATA_DIR"="J:\\php\\pear\\data"
"PHP_PEAR_PHP_BIN"="J:\\php\\php.exe"
"PHP_PEAR_TEST_DIR"="J:\\php\\pear\\tests"

Do I have to erase this J:\php\pear directory 
and reinstall (if that's the answer so be it) 

But is there an easier/quicker way?

Thanks in advance for anything on this

Hi all,

I'm looking to parse a CSV file and figured there must be a smooth regex
for the job.  I'm of course getting the data line by line.  Google seems
to think this is everyone's favorite regex for the job:

,(?=3D([^"]*"[^"]*")*(?![^"]*"))

And, I must say, it works pretty good, using, for instance, the
following command:

      $columns =3D
preg_split('/,(?=3D([^"]*"[^"]*")*(?![^"]*"))/',fgets($fp));

The only issue is it returns the double quotes with each column.  So, if
a column contains:

"D"

I get "D" back.  I'd prefer just D

Any tips?  Thanks,

H

Any reason why fgetcsv() doesn't work for you?

http://www.php.net/fgetcsv

I've always found it to do a fine job, plus it's very fast.

You could just strip off the quotes afterwards, of course, but that's 
maybe not what you were looking for.

Dealing with quotes in CSV is sort of a disaster waiting to happen. 
Remember that there may be quotes embedded inside fields, which are 
themselves quoted, and newlines inside fields may or may not be supported.

There's discussion of this in The Art of Unix Programming:

What Chris said, but if you really want a regex, I suggest the one
from Jeff Friedl's "Mastering Regular Expressions." The code examples
are available online at:

Well the 60 tables are a collaboration of packages ... (oscommerce, phpbb,
calendar, ai, etc) so much of it is reasonable, one is bh_player, which is
approx ~100 players per leagues, 5 leagues @ the moment:

CREATE TABLE bh_player (
  id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  team int(11) default NULL,
  first varchar(50),
  last varchar(50),
  jersey int(2) NOT NULL default '0',

  email varchar(50),

  position int(1) default NULL,
  captain tinyint(1) default '0',

And this charming individual has done this before and I asked him not to
do it again.  So much for my being omnipotent...

Anyway boys and girls, there are several ways to avoid this situation:

1) Set up your auto-responder to not send responses to mailing lists 
you're on.

2) Unsubscribe from mailing lists while you're gone.

3) Don't use auto-responders.

Thank you,

It turns out Windows XP was making 
daily snapshots of the system 

after restoring a snap from 3 days ago 
everything seems to have been set straight 
(it looks like it even restored 
some files from the 'recycled bin')

I think the next time I try an experiment, 
I'll create a manual snapshot just before.

Message-ID: <40401F73.3050005@reuel.net>

Okay, I'll try to make this understandable before I fall asleep. I'm 
setting a bunch of check boxes where each is a member of an array. So 
the first line is:

echo "<input name=\"Skill[]\" type=\"checkbox\" 
value=\"$skill_data[skillID] \" \n ";

$skill_data[skillID] was previously pulled from the database and is a 
unique identifier for each skill. Each checkbox has the skill name 
beside it so the user can check what skills they have and then submit 
the form.

However, php script calls another to load the database and I'm not sure 
how to get the data from a $_POST[] variable. Can I? I don't want to 
have to manually name each variable because there's a couple hundred of 
them all told.

Hope that's enough info to make sense. If not I can just post my code, 
though it is so ugly most sensible people avoid it.  :)

ciao!

Doing it this way you've got the problem, no doubt, where the Post var 
"Skill" is an array that starts with zero and has no relation to the 
skill itself.

 > echo "<input name=\"Skill[]\" type=\"checkbox\"
 > value=\"$skill_data[skillID] \" \n ";

However, nothing stops you from altering the "index" of the Skill 
array...so...instead of leaving it as <input name=\"Skill[]\"
you could do something along the lines of
<input name=\"Skill[$skillID]\"

For an obviously different programming project, I needed check box 
corresponding to different car models. Look at the item below. You'll 
see that the index of the model_array is identical to the value. So...if 
the user clicks on the checkbox...I know that they have selected the 
model 3.2CL (an Integra, btw).
<input name="model_array[3.2CL]" type="checkbox" value="3.2CL">3.2CL

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

Hey Tom,

Speaking POP (or any email protocol) isn't really related to =
attachments.  You could, for example, send HTTP packets over email if =
you really wanted to.  In fact, you could send IP packets if you have =
nothing to do.

For IMAP there's of course:  http://us2.php.net/imap

And for pop, phpclasses.org probably has you covered.  I haven't had to =
speak POP myself, so I'm lucky.

I have, however, had to parse email messages a lot, and this means MIME. =
 So much so, I wrote my own parser, which is actually generic to MIME =
(http/email/etc).  It's attached and I'd be happy for any feedback.  I'm =
using it in production and all has been happy, but I'm always ready for =
patches, etc.

It depends on the flavor of Unix and possibly the distribution.  Give me =
these details and I can point you to a couple possible locations.

All this said:  dump mysql data to an ascii format (mysqldump), use the =
binary log, or do it across the network by way of LOAD DATA FROM MASTER =
(if they're recent versions and I remember that as the correct name).  =
Copying raw binary data =3D Bad (endianess/disk caches/mysql =
caches/binary representations/etc).

Does anything make a good NFS server?  :)

They seem familiar, but I can't place them:  maybe truss or ktrace can =
help.

The CSV data is pretty nasty, so I'll see how fgetcsv() fares.  It's =

That's ok... it'd have no effect in this case since the replies are =

HI FIVE MY FRIEND!

I'm totally happy for you -- must be interpaternal/PHPistic solidarity or
something.

I never fully comprehended how trippy it would be until we deployed our
unit on May 16.

You know you're a geek when, as a grad school classmate of mine does,

This is kinda OT from the original question of 'moving' the files.  Even
though this is a backup solution it should be a short hop to a moving
mechanism.

A solution I have found that works very well for backing up LIVE MySQL
databases without having to take the DB offline is as follows.

-Take the list of DB's you want backed up/migrated.
	-For each table within each DB
		-- Lock that table
		-- Flush that table
		-- rsync that table to your backup location (filesystem|server)
		-- UnLock that table
	-Next Table
-Next DB

You lock the table to make sure it doesn't change during your backup.

You flush the table to make sure the table on the file system is
complete and doesn't have some parts of it only in memory(otherwise you
end up backing a corrupted table file).

Use rsync to copy only the file deltas (live vs. last backup copy) to
minimize the time the table must be locked.  The other option is to copy
over the whole file, but for a lot of my tables this takes way too long
and is redundant in my opinion.  The first rsync you won't see a speed
boost, without the destination file everything must be moved.  But the
subsequent ones have the potential to be MUCH faster.

I believe MySQL data files cannot be copied from one platform to
another, like Windows to UNIX without possible file corruption. 
Something to do with the format of the files on one system vs another. 
But from box 1:OS A to box 2:OS A you should not have a problem.

At the time I implemented this backup scheme I could not find a free
utility to backup a live MySQL DB WITHOUT having to copy the entire file
every time.  See below as to why it was necessary to find a better
method.

To give you an idea of the performance boost you can get.

A full copy of the DBs and all their tables was taking approximately 45
minutes to complete.  It was also locking everything in the beginning
and unlocking everything at the end.  Which made the site useless during
that time, which sucked a lot because site traffic is pretty constant
and very large.

The new solution takes less than 2 minutes almost all the time (never
more than 4 minutes in my case).

Hope this helps some folks out there in their travels through cyberspace
:)
